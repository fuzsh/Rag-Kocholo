        "text": "The daughter of the actor who played both 'The elephant' and 'Jackal' in the block busting movie, 'Hatari!' filmed here in the early 60s, was in Arusha this week. She rekindled the dramatic memories of that 'live' set in which real animals were used to wreck havoc in town.\n\nMarylin Porter, formerly known by her maiden name as 'Nee Read,' said her father, the late, Norman Read who was a professional hunter, had been enlisted to play the role of 'animal voice personification,' in which he trumpeted like an elephant and laughed like a hyena.\n\n\"Because as soon as the elephants were brought to town, they refused to make any noise.\" On the other hand though the animals did their best in displaying cross-country skills as they run round the town and into supermarkets, not to mention the Safari Hotel where they caused plenty of mayhem.\n\nDuring those days, Marylin alias Nee, was attending the Arusha school with her mates. After classes, she recalls, the girls used to cause as much tension as the elephants of Hatari did. \"We would normally go into supermarkets and steal candy, sweets and biscuits,\" she admits.\n\n\"Hatari!\" is the story of a group of men who lived around the Arusha Game Park and caught animals to be sent for overseas zoos. The actors include; John Wayne, who played the role of Sean Mercer, the head captor. Red Buttons who was \"Pockets\" the driver and Hardy Kruger, a German known in the film as Kurt.\n\nIn the movie, a photographer named Dallas (Elsa Martinelli) comes to spend a season and everyone is surprised (and delighted) to find that she is a woman, and a beautiful one at that. She goes out on hunts with the men and is attracted to Sean; he likes her, too, although he won't admit it. Pockets and Kurt fight over their old boss' daughter, Brandy, who is grown up now.\n\nThere is plenty of wild animal action (the actors really did catch the animals), plenty of fun, and innocent romance, too. John Wayne has one of his best roles as the rugged he-man who acts all dopey around a pretty girl. Miss Martinelli is very good as the Italian beauty who falls hard for Sean and is the object of two baby elephants' affections, as well.\n\n\"Elsa was horrible!\" Said Marilyn, explaining that the actor was as bad-tempered in real life as she was in the movie. After completing school, Marilyn worked part-time as a receptionist at The New Arusha Hotel, before leaving for Zambia then later on Zimbabwe and finally Botswana where she got married. Nee now lives in Australia.\n\n\"I constantly come to Arusha to visit my uncle who lives at Ngongongare location of Arumeru, around Momella,\" she said. Her uncle is none other than David Read, the brains behind the outstanding book titles: 'Barefoot over Serengeti,' ' Beating about the Bush,' ' Waters of the Sanjan' and the recently released, 'Another Load of Bull.'\n\nMarilyn had a few things to say about his uncle as well. \"He is always in a hurry, hardly settles.\" She reveals. But David Read remained unperturbed by such remarks.\n\nThe Duke's family jets into Arusha to retrace the legend's footsteps\n\nBy Valentine Marc Nkwame\n\n\"... Someday Pockets! Someday! I am gonna wring your neck.,\" fumed the soaked-to-the-skin, John Wayne, in one of the many animal-chasing scenes found in \"Hatari,\" a movie in which, he was playing the leading role as Sean Mercer, the head animal trapper of Momella (Now Arusha National Park).\n\nPockets (Red Buttons), on the other hand, was that clown-funny, little driver, who had just dipped the nose of his rugged, speeding truck into a river, thus splashing Mercer (Wayne), who had strapped himself on the car's hood, with muddy water. Pockets merely dismissed the \"threats\" with a laugh, \"Not today Bwana! Not today... !\"\n\nHe used to be the \"strong and silent\" type of a movie star, who became a role-model for other Action and Adventure film actors. Born on the 26th of May 1907 in Winterset, Iowa, USA John Wayne, was popularly known as \"The Duke!\", a title which \"Pockets\" comically translated into \"Bwana\" (Swahili term for \"Lordï¿½) in Hatari.\n\nDeclared the \"Greatest Male Star of all time,\" by the American Film Institute, The Oscar winning, John Wayne who died in June 1979 then aged 72 left behind hundreds of films in which he either played a lead role, co-starred or helped to produce. In Tanzania he is mostly remembered for his 1962 role in Hatari! Which was set in Arusha.\n\nNow the legendary American film icon, is just about to take onto a new role. John Wayne, is soon \"going out\" to \"showcase\" Tanzania, through a soon to be screened, new Television feature to be known as \"Beyond the list!\"\n\nThe 30 minutes feature is being produced by the Los Angeles based, Bennett Productions of California. The works involved include 10 days of going round specific sites, with more than 40 hours of filming. The feature will cover, Arusha town, Arusha National Park, Momella Wildlife Lodge, Serengeti, Ngorongoro and Lake Manyara Parks. Parts of Dar-es-salaam City and Zanzibar island may also be thrown in.\n\nBut wait! Isnï¿½t John Wayne dead? Oh! Yes, the legendary film star passed away in 1979, about 20 years after he came to Arusha to take the leading role (as Sean Mercer) in the classic Adventure and Comedy feature, \"Hatari!\" a film which since its debut release in 1962, remained an all-time family favorite and still gets rave reviews in most on-line movie sites.\n\nThe Duke has eyes!\n\nNow! If John Wayne died 28 years ago, how exactly then, is the prima donna expected to star in this new TV feature? Maybe Ian Woods can explain. This is the British producer in charge of \"Beyond the list\" project and who together with two film crews, comprising six people, jetted into Arusha last week, ready for the shooting.\n\n\"The theme behind the TV feature is \"Showcasing Tanzania through the eyes of John Wayne's Family!\" He explained. Right, because even if John Wayne had lived, he would have been 100 years old now, rather retired and too aged to face the cameras ... Star at the age of 100? \"Not today Bwana! Certainly Not Today.\"\n\nHowever, that was the whole purpose of the family of the late John Wayne, to visit Arusha in the course of last week; They jetted here to pay a centennial homage to the Duke. That took place at the exact remote location (Momella), where John Wayne once stayed while filming Hatari.\n\nSo the riddle has been explained! It wonï¿½t be the duke himself who will be facing the lenses, but rather his family. Yes, it will be through the eyes of this celebrated family, that the LA based, Bennett Productions want to explain Tanzania to the world ... in 30 minutes sharp.\n\nOnly half-an-hour? Considering Hatari's whooping 3 hours. Still, quite possible. I mean when taking into account the number of \"eyes\" that the producers will be using in \"seeing Tanzania!\" Patrick Wayne, the son of John Wayne and who is an accomplished actor himself, will provide the first pair of eyes.\n\nThere is also Patrick's own son, the stout Michael Wayne. He is the grandson of the legendary Duke. Mike came along with his wife, Christine and several children. (He should not be confused with the other Michael Wayne, the Duke's first born who however did not come to Arusha). Then again there is Melanie, Patrick's daughter and John Wayne's granddaughter ... \"Beyond the list \"seems to have adequate pairs of eyes.\n\nNow! Let the cameras roll. And the cameras in question are those giant HD types. \"We are shooting the movie clips in High Definition,\" Said Woods. \"This is in order to reproduce realistic theatrical effects.\" He added.\n\nNow looks like History is about to repeat itself. It took decades before copies of Hatari came to Tanzania (they are still few to date). It may take twice as long for \"Beyond the list\" to make scene here. If it ever will, because being a Television feature, chances are it may never be released commercially.\n\n... Two jeeps raced side-by-side in Momella, trying to outrun a large rhino that the trappers wanted to exhaust before harnessing it with giant ropes. After a session of such a breathtaking race, the animal turned and charged at one of the open-roofed jeeps. The Rhino hit the Indian (Bruce Cabot), who was seated next to the driver, fracturing his femur.\n\nWell! The \"hunt\" had to be halted since the excessively bleeding Indian must be rushed to Mount Meru Hospital for treatment. Even in the 60s the Regional Health Center used to have a shortage of blood in its banks and the Indian needed transfusion before operation ... or something. Whatever the case, it was such a gory opening for Hatari!\n\nNot so with \"Beyond the list!\" \"See these giraffes overlooking the Momella?\" Said Casey Bennet, the Managing Director of Bennett Productions, pointing at a footage of the tall animals, feeding on shrubs near the lodge, at sundown. \"This will be the opening scene in the feature film.\" He revealed. Mh! Rather tame, compared to the John Wayne's intro.\n\nUsing his palm held, Image viewer, Bennett reveals more stunning footage of what is likely to be \"an interesting documentary.\" Except it is not. \"I wonï¿½t consider it a documentary, but an adventure feature,\" said Bennett. Anyway, he is quite a cheeky fellow, that Casey Bennett. Among the \"collections\" on his portable image viewer, are pictures of ...eh... some beautiful ladies.\n\n\"Well I have also been taking pictures of Super-models, Miss World and Miss Universe Pageants.\" He revealed with a smirk. But he quickly remarks, \"beauties can also \"showcase\" a place. In fact for my next Tanzanian project, I plan to use super models to promote some of the countries\" attractions. To start with Mount Kilimanjaro, that will be next year.\"\n\nHowever, the \"beauty factor\" doesnï¿½t have to wait for next year. \"Beyond the list,\" features one such beauty personality. As it happens, Jenn Brown, a young attractive lady, is going to \"present\" the whole show. That should be okay. But was there a beauty in Hatari? Oh! You bet. After all, the movie had some smooch romantic episodes as well.\n\nBrandy (Michele Girardon), the beautiful daughter of a former hunter (according to Hatari storyline), finds herself the unwitting romantic pawn in what was to become a \"love triangle,\" pitting two of the youthful hunters and later on, Pockets as well.\n\nThere was also Elsa Martinell the main Co-Star, who played, Anna Maria Dallas, the moody \"photographer\" sent down from a Swiss Zoo, but who ...typically... ends up falling for the \"unconcerned\" Duke. Before that however, she adopts two baby elephants that later chase her around Arusha town as she tried to escape. In fact, the closing scene for Hatari (Swahili term for \"Dangerï¿½) is when the elephants climbs onto her bed and ... well... break it.\n\nCasey Bennett may have seen other Wayne's works, such as The Stagecoach, Rio Lobo, The Train Robbers, The Cowboys, The War Wagon, Hell fighters and The Undefeated! But before coming to Arusha, the director had never watched \"Hatari!\" He watched it for the first time during the special \"John Wayne Centennial\" reception, organized by the Tanzania Tourist Board at the Ngurdoto Mountain Lodge where the crew also stayed.\n\nNever mind, but as the legend of John Wayne gets revived in Arusha, through the eyes of his offsprings and 45 years after Hatari was filmed here, one wonders when exactly will this vicinity ever get the honor of hosting any major film production again ... Probably; Not today Bwana!"
