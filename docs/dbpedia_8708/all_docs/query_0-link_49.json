        "text": "Bruce Cabot Smith was born in Seattle, Wash., on May 6, 1955. He died at home in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, on June 13, 2024. Bruce was a sailor in the American Merchant Marine. With his father’s help, he shipped out as Ordinary Seaman on the SS Hawaii from Portland in the summer he turned 17. There was no going back to Beaverton High School after that. He had a “Permit” to ship in the Sailors Union of The Pacific. It took 15 years to get a “Book” in the union, which gives the first shot at the best shipping jobs. He called a mailbox in Seattle homeport as he shipped from Honolulu, San Francisco, Portland and Seattle.\n\nBruce was well known around the watering holes of West Coast sailors. He preferred Budweiser for breakfast, was free spending and enjoyed fist fighting. He was 6 foot 3 and settled many disagreements, paying for that with broken fingers and scars. American President Lines and Matson had the best ships and jobs; he worked them for 30 years.\n\nBruce was Bosun (lead sailor) on an APL ship when he met Lydia Conde in Manila in 1990. Lydia and Bruce married in 1992. Michelle was four when she first met her adoptive father. They lived in the mountain resort city of Baguio at a family compound. Bruce would take ships shuttling from Manila to Japan, Taiwan, Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore, not returning to the U.S. but instead staying in the Philippines. Bruce enjoyed family life with Lydia’s extended family and the companionship of 200 pound mastiff Dumbo, the first of several big companions for ten years.\n\nBruce injured his back on the APL ship MV Singapore in 2002, thus ending his shipping career. They relocated to Coeur d’Alene to be close to his parents and siblings and a good hospital. They had a nice home built and Bruce retired to the backyard and fishing. As mobility got harder, steelheading on the Snake River and long days of boating evolved into caring for a big tropical fish aquarium. Bruce enjoyed being in the company of his parents, Bill and Lynn, spending many afternoons at their home or at local taverns. Bruce totally avoided the frustration of computers and cell phones; he never wanted either. Reading books was always a favorite pastime when on ships or at home. He wanted a cigar, a book, a comfortable chair and dog to bark at. Lydia took care of that and everything else. He had what he needed most: the love of Lydia. His family and friends know how her devotion and care enriched his life and are thankful.\n\nBruce was preceded in death by his parents, Bill and Lynn Smith, of Coeur d'Alene. He is survived by his wife, Lydia Smith of Coeur d'Alene; his daughter, Michelle Conde Smith, and husband Leslie; nieces Nicole and Scarlet; nephews Zack and Sean in the Philippines; his brother, Bill Smith, and wife Lori of Walla Walla; nieces Willow Smith of Moscow and Jean Smith of Laramie, Wyo., sister Karen Smith and husband Rick of Port Townsend, Wash.; sister Karla Ngawaka; and nephew Nigel Ngawaka of Coeur d'Alene.\n\nTo Dr. Scarola for many years of care, the nurses and North Idaho Hospice who made it possible to pass at home as he wanted — Thank You."
