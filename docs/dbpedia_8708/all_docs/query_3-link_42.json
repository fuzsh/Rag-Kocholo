        "text": "In the summer of 2008 we were camping up in the Bruce Peninsula area. During our stay we went on several day trips and one of those led us to the Cabot Head Lighthouse which is located in the Cabot Head Nature Reserve on the shores of the Georgian Bay.\n\nThe lighthouse was named after the famous explorer, John Cabot and has been in operation, in one way or another, for over a hundred years.\n\nIf it looks like the lighthouse tower seems a little short, you’re right. Over 50 years ago the tower was ‘shortened’ and replaced with an automated light. Maybe the height of the existing tower was interfering with the line of sight of the new automated tower? I believe the original tower had two more floors than it does now.\n\nBack in 2008 the lighthouse was opened to visitors for free. We had Maya with us but this kind gentleman, who was a volunteer Lighthouse Keeper, offered to not only watch Maya, but he got her a big bucket of water to cool her off!\n\nInside the lighthouse they had antique items that would have been used at some point in the past by the lighthouse keeper and their families. Here’s an old washing machine with the manual wringer on top. I should have gotten a close-up shot of the name brand on the side of the tub.\n\nAbove you can get a good look at the narrow wood floor boards, plus two different stoves that might have been used throughout the lighthouse’s history. Both of the stoves were set in place as displays and were not hooked up and could not be used. Is that a floor vent I see off to the left of the image?\n\nMore washing and scrubbing boards and a modern outlet. This place was fascinating!\n\nThey had cut off the two middle floors to lower the tower but still made it accessible for visitors. It was a pretty steep climb and definitely not wheelchair accessible.\n\nThe climb up those stairs was definitely worth it. Check out the view of the shoreline! You could see for miles and miles, which is great considering this is a lighthouse and that’s the whole point. The original tower light was visible from 14 miles away in all directions, not including from land.\n\nAfter touring the lighthouse we thanked the gentleman for taking care of Maya and then headed down the trail toward a harbour and then along the shoreline. On our way back along the rocky shore we could see the lighthouse poking out from the tree tops. Now imagine two more full floors on the tower and just how visible and spectacular that would have looked!\n\nAs I am writing this I came across some news articles that stated that the lighthouse and grounds was closed in 2017 and will also be closed in 2018. Check their website to see if it’s open before making the trip to the lighthouse – Cabot Head Lighthouse website.\n\nSources:"
