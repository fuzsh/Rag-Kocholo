He quickly leaped to stardom and played leading roles in and/or directed 92 Egyptian films between the 1932 and 1955. He achieved particular success partnering with his wife, Egyptian legend Leila Mourad.

Youssef Wahbi directed his first film: "Defense" in 1934 and called "Anwar Wagdy" to take part in this film with him.
