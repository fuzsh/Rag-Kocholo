        "text": "Introduction\n\nLumpy skin disease (LSD), sheeppox (SPP) and goatpox (GTP) are economically important capripoxvirus (CaPV) diseases of domestic ruminants with substantial impact on the livelihoods of small‐scale farmers and poor rural communities in endemic regions.\n\nLSD, SPP and GTP are known to be present in Syria and Iraq. Since 2011, conflicts in these countries have promoted factors such as mass movement of refugees and farm animals, collapsed veterinary services and lack of available vaccines and medicines, leading to delayed or failed containment of epidemics of many infectious human and veterinary diseases.\n\nIn 2015, millions of civilians are looking for safety in Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon and Iran, being relocated to temporary settlements or dispersed among local communities. The need to support such a large number of people, in addition to the local population, puts these countries under immense economic pressure. Refugees may also travel with unvaccinated cattle, sheep and goats. As an example, in Lebanon there are currently 1.2 million registered Syrian refugees and a 60% increase in the quantity of livestock near the Syrian border (ProMed 20150527.3389044). The movement of farm animals without proper health checks has been associated with the current spread of LSD virus (LSDV), SPP virus (SPPV) and GTP virus (GTPV) in the Middle and Near East (ProMed 20150410.3290468).\n\nAs vaccination of cattle and small ruminants in the war‐torn areas is neither possible nor safe to perform, it is highly likely that the conflict regions will continue to serve as a source of infection, until reconstruction of basic infrastructure can be commenced. In addition, in any of those countries where LSD, SPP or GTP are currently endemic, culling of all infected and in‐contact animals is not an affordable or feasible disease control strategy.\n\nIt is also well known that CaPV diseases are extremely difficult to control using only total or modified stamping‐out, animal movement restrictions and quarantine. However, the experiences obtained from Israel and the northern part of Cyprus show that LSD outbreaks can be successfully contained by a well‐organized vaccination campaign, using sufficient coverage and effective vaccines.\n\nUntil recently, very little interest in CaPV research has been shown outside endemic regions, and funding opportunities have been scarce for these neglected infectious diseases. However, the significant emergence of CaPV in the Middle and Near East and the reported problems associated with the use of different CaPV vaccines, illustrate the pressing need for improved control strategies and have escalated CaPVs as a research priority. This shift also provides an opportunity to reassess control strategies and identify new opportunities for smallholder farmers who rely on livestock for their livelihoods and therefore have the greatest need for improved disease control.\n\nThe aim of this review is to highlight the current epidemiological status of CaPVs, scrutinize the vaccines available in affected regions and to investigate the resources and challenges facing CaPV control and the attempts to further develop safer and more effective vaccines."
