        "text": "I am beyond excited to announce that I have been appointed as the MENA Regional Leader at Girl Up, a UN foundation. This role holds immense meaning to me as a young Arab woman pursuing a career in engineering. It provides me with a platform to address the challenges faced by women and minorities in the field and work towards inspiring and encouraging youth, especially women, to embark on careers in STEM. Throughout my journey, I have witnessed the barriers and biases that can hinder the progress of women and minorities which fuels my passion to make a difference. I firmly believe that representation matters, and by actively engaging in various activities, I strive to be a source of inspiration and motivation for young individuals who may be hesitant to pursue their dreams in STEM. Mentoring and tutoring students have been an integral part of my mission to create a more inclusive and diverse STEM community. By sharing knowledge, expertise, and experiences, I aim to empower students to explore their interests, develop their skills, and realize their potential in science and technology. It is my firm belief that education and equal opportunities are transformative forces that can shape a more equitable and prosperous future. #sdg5 #sdg4 #sdg7 I am deeply grateful for this opportunity and excited to collaborate with like-minded individuals (Asma Rouabhia, Ayusha Pinidi and @Lina B.), organizations, and communities in the MENA region and beyond. Together, we can build a brighter future where everyone, regardless of their gender, can pursue their passions and make meaningful contributions. Let's break down barriers, challenge stereotypes, and empower the next generation of leaders to create a world where diversity and innovation thrive !! #GirlUp #UNFoundation #MENARegionalLeader #STEM #WomenInSTEM #YouthEmpowerment #GenderEquality #DiversityandInclusion #Innovation #Inspiration #Leadership"
