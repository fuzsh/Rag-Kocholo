The Commission considered agenda item 4 at its 1528th to 1534+th and its 1538th meetings, held from 6 to 11 February 1980 and on 13 February 198O.\n\n2. By its resolution 1 A (XXXV), the Commission had decided to place this item on the provisional agenda of its thirty-sixth session as a matter of high priority. For its consideration of this question, the Commission had before it the following documentation:\n\n(a) A note by the Secretary-General (E/CN.4/1352 and Add.1) submitted pursuant to the Commission's request for relevant information concerning Arabs detained or imprisoned as a result of their struggle for self-determination and the liberation of their territories;\n\n(b) A report of the Secretary-General (E/CN.4/1360) on the measures taken to bring resolution 1 A (XXXV) to the attention of all Governments, the competent United Nations organs, the specialized agencies, the regional intergovernmental organizations and the international humanitarian organizations and to give it the widest possible publicity ;\n\n(c) A note by the Secretary-General (E/CN.4/1361) listing all United Nations reports issued since the thirty-third session of the Commission that deal with the situation of civilians in the occupied Arab territories, including Palestine;\n\n' ,\n\n(d) A note by the Secretary-General (E/CN.4/1355) submitted pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 5 of resolution 2 (XXXV);\n\n(e) Report of the mission sent by the Director-General of ILO to examine\n\nthe situation of workers of the occupied Arab territories, circulated in accordance with a request made by the Permanent Mission of the Syrian Arab Republic (E/CN.4/1391);\n\n(f) A letter addressed to the Chairman of the Commission on Human Rights by the representative of Egypt (E/CN.4/1393);\n\n(g) A letter addressed to the Chairman of the Commission on Human Rights from the representative of Morocco (E/CN.4/1395);\n\n(h) A letter addressed to the Chairman of the Commission on Human Rights by the representative of Egypt (E/CN.4/1370).\n\n3. In addition, the Commission had before it a written statement submitted by the World Peace Council (E/CN.4/NGO/266), and a written declaration submitted by the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization (E/CN.4/NGO/270).\n\n4. The Commission heard statements by the observers for China (1530th meeting); Israel (1531st meeting); the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (1531st meeting); Democratic Yemen (1532nd meeting); the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (1532nd meeting);\n\nHungary (1533rd meeting) ; the German Democratic Republic (1533rd meeting); Czechoslovakia (1533rd meeting); the representative of the League of Arab States (1530th meeting); and the representative of the Palestine Liberation Organization (1528th and 1532nd meeting).\n\n5. The Commission also heard statements by the following non-governmental organizations in consultative status: International Commission of Jurists (Category II); Women's International Democratic Federation (Category I) (1528th meeting); and World Federation of Trade Unions (Category I) (1529th meeting).\n\n6. The report (A/34/63l) of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Population of the Occupied Territories, was referred to by most speakers; they considered it an important document that gave\n\nan accurate account of the serious situation of the civilian population of the occupied territories; the members of the Special Committee were commended for their objective and impartial manner in which they had carried out their mandate despite Israel's continuing refusal to co-operate. One speaker said that a report of his Government on the human rights situation in the occupied territories provided a different perspective from the report of the Special Committee.\n\n7. Most speakers expressed grave concern at the systematic and constant violations of human rights in the occupied Arab territories, including Palestine, which resulted in the continuous deterioration of the situation in the area, since the last session of the Commission. They endorsed the conclusions of the Special Committee that the fundamental violation of human rights lay in the very fact of occupation. The attention of the Commission was called to the continued refusal of the Israeli Government to implement the numerous resolutions adopted by the Commission and other United Nations bodies such as the General Assembly and the Security Council on the subject.\n\n8. It was pointed out that Israel persisted in taking measures aimed at changing the demographic structure of the occupied territories, by creating conditions which made the life of Palestinian inhabitants difficult or by direct measures, such as evacuation, eviction or expulsion of Arab inhabitants of the occupied territories, and denial of the right to return of those who had been forced to leave their homes and properties because of the hostilities. Such measures consisted of arbitrary arrest, intimidation and mistreatment, torture, confiscation of property, expropriation, obstruction of educational activities and policies aimed at securing the status of occupation and at maintaining the civilian population in a situation of continued deprivation of their right of expression, assembly and self-determination.\n\n9. A number of delegations condemned partial agreements and separate treaties such as the Camp David Agreement and the Washington Treaty which, in their view, would only encourage Israel to intensify its policy of colonization and annexation. Those agreements had done more damage to the Palestinian cause than 30 years of Israeli occupation and intimidation. As a result, the situation with regard to the human rights in this area would continue to worsen despite the struggle of\n\nthe people of Palestine. Those agreements violated international law, which rejected bilateral arrangements with an occupying Power alone, ran counter to the decisions and resolutions of the United Nations and disregarded the right of the Palestinians to self-determination and independence and their right to create a sovereign State in Palestine. They made a distinction between self-determination and administrative autonomy. The contracting parties to those agreements\n\nsquandered Palestinian rights and moulded international legitimacy. A few other delegations stated their support for the Camp David agreements which, in their view, could provide a step toward peace in the Middle East. One speaker said those agreements provided the most promising avenue for dealing with the issues in the Middle East and were thus important in creating a just and lasting peace which would include recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinians. A number of speakers condemned the Camp David agreements and the Washington Treaty as an act of treason against the Arab Nation in general and the people of Palestine in particular. Some delegations rejected such allegations as slanderous and stated that the road to enable the Palestinian people to exercise their right to self-determination was not through their massacre in their camps.\n\n10. Several members expressed the view that measures taken to Judaize Jerusalem\n\nand to annex it to Israel were null and void. They insisted that Jerusalem could\n\nnot be made the subject of bargaining, and called for the strongest measures,\n\nboth political and economic, against States which recognized the Holy City as the\n\ncapital of Israel. In that connexion they called the attention of the Commission\n\nto the decisions adopted in this regard by the General Assembly and the Security\n\nCouncil as well as by the 1979 Islamic Conference held in Fez (Morocco), the\n\nVI Conference of non-aligned countries held in Havana (Cuba), and the extraordinary meeting of Islamic Foreign Ministers held in Islamabad (Pakistan), in January 1980.\n\n11. Deep concern was expressed by many delegations about the continued measures taken by Israel to change the physical character, demographic composition, institutional structure and legal status of the occupied territories including Jerusalem.\n\n12. Many delegations drew the Commission's attention to certain grave breaches of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, and, in particular, to articles 27, 33, 47, 49 and 53 thereof, as evidenced by the continued policy and practice of annexation of the occupied territories, the establishment of new Israeli settlements and reports of ill-treatment of the civilian population. These illegal acts showed that Israel continued to violate the Convention.\n\n13. Some delegations referred to the cable of the Commission on Human Rights to the Government of Israel, sent during its thirty-fifth session, expressing deep concern about acts of torture and the policies of repression and collective punishment against the Palestinians in the Arab occupied territories which constituted a violation of this Convention.\n\n14. The establishment of Israeli settlements and the increasing number of Israeli settlers were exhausting the water resources of the West Bank. The Palestinians suffered hardship and several were being forced to abandon their land and become cheap labourers for Israeli industry.\n\n15. Another dangerous development brought to the attention of the Commission was the pattern of severe reprisals taken by the Israeli authorities and individuals taken against Palestinians who had attempted to express their resistance to the occupation. According to the Special Committee, the severity of such reprisals had increased in the period covered by its latest report. The Special Committee considered that the treatment of civilians in the occupied territories had become distinctly serious owing to the absence of any effective protection of the civilian population or any control over the conduct of the Israeli authorities.\n\n16. References were also made by some members to the conclusions of the Special Committee with regard to the situation of detainees in the occupied territories. The Special Committee had accumulated considerable evidence which proved beyond reasonable doubt that the prison conditions of security detainees were extremely poor and inferior to applicable international standards, and that interrogation procedures were often accompanied by physical abuse. On the basis of information made available to it, the Special Committee even suggested that there was indeed in Israeli prisons a systematic practice of torture.\n\n17. Many members of the Commission endorsed the conclusions of the Special Committee that the fact of occupation itself constituted a fundamental violation of the human rights of the civilian population of the occupied territories. A few delegations affirmed Israel's right to secure and recognized borders. Some delegations pointed out that Israel's policy in the occupied territories was based on the so-called \"homeland\" doctrine, which envisaged a mono-religious (Jewish) State established in the area including those territories occupied by Israel in June 1967. This doctrine was presented as being the basis for the decision of the Government of Israel to authorize Israeli citizens and entities to purchase land in the occupied territories.\n\n18. There was general agreement that the Commission should reaffirm that the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of Far was applicable to all the Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967, including Jerusalem, and that it should condemn Israel for its failure to acknowledge the applicability of that Convention to those territories.\n\n19. Most speakers insisted that the Palestine Liberation Organization was the sole representative of the Palestinian people inside and outside the occupied territories. A number of delegations drew a parallel between Zionism and apartheid and expressed the view that racist regimes should be excluded from the international community.\n\n20. It was stated that the Camp David Accords ignored the rights of the Palestinian people. As a result, since the signing of the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel the situation of Palestinians had deteriorated. Those Accords, for example, ignored the right of Palestinians who had been evicted and uprooted because of Israeli policies and practices. Nor was there any assurance that the Palestinian people would have the opportunity to free themselves from their present situation under which they were denied enjoyment of their very basic rights. It would have been better if the rights of the Palestinians had been assured through the appropriate international machinery since this would more accurately reflect the will of the international community, the majority of which had expressed its serious reservations about the effectiveness or utility of the Camp David Accords. Instead, as one delegation suggested, Egypt had harmed the Arab cause by co-operating with Israel.\n\n21. It was stated that Egypt remained firmly convinced that military occupation was the most fundamental violation of human rights and that only through total withdrawal of Israeli forces from all occupied territories and through the exercise of their right to self-determination could the Palestinians ensure enjoyment of their human rights. It was with this in mind that Egypt had signed the Camp David framework agreement as a first step towards the achievement of a comprehensive\n\nand durable peace in the area, based on the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law. It was stated further that the Camp David\n\nframework agreement was by no means the final settlement of the Palestinian problem. Its purpose was to break the stalemate that had immobilized the Palestinian problem for years and to obtain concrete commitments from Israel. The Camp David framework agreement was designed to establish transitional arrangements to serve as a bridge between the existing situation, namely, the military occupation, and a definitive solution of the Palestinian problem. Since the Palestinian problem was the core of the Arab-Israeli conflict, any solution which did not recognize the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination, to the recovery of its territory and to the establishment of a State of its own would not lead to a comprehensive, just and lasting peace. In its negotiations Egypt had not spoken on behalf of the Palestinian people. The Palestinian people alone had the final word so far as the solution of the Palestinian problem was concerned. Referring to the question of negotiations as a method of solving international problems, it was stated that at no period of history had any country, big or small, chosen to deny itself the right to negotiate with an adversary. Such an approach would call the entire present international system into question. Referring to the \"series of lost opportunities in the past, the hope was expressed that the present negotiating process and its prospects would not become another lost opportunity for everyone involved in the Palestinian problem.\n\n22. Reservations were expressed by the observer for Israel concerning the Special\n\nCommittee's mandate and constitution; he criticized the quality and the reliability\n\nof the Special Committee's methods of work and its conclusions. Regarding the\n\nallegation that Israel followed a policy of annexation in the occupied territories ,\n\nhe stated that the settlements were established for well known security reasons.\n\nHe rejected the allegation that Israel was a mono-religious State, stating that Israeli law recognized 12 religious denominations. With regard to the question of the expropriation of property, the report of the Special Committee gave a distorted picture based on inflated figures and the account of the judgements of the Israeli Supreme Court on the matter was inaccurate and confusing. He said that the report lacked sensitivity and objectivity with regard to the suffering caused by terrorism and to the threat it posed. He rejected the allegations that detainees were tortured and referred to reports prepared by \"Pax Romana\" and the United States State Department which did not find any proof of the existence of a deliberate Israeli policy in that regard. The allegations that prisoners were given injections against their will were also false, as was proved by the details of their interrogation given in the report. He stated that individual complaints had been thoroughly refuted by his Government at the last session of the General Assembly and gave the Commission a description of the essentials of the special agreement with the International Committee of the Red Cross on arrangements for visits to detainees and of the Israeli judicial system, which, he emphasized, was independent from the executive branch. He added that international law had always recognized the right of a military government to take adequate measures to ensure its security after an armed conflict. He referred to the social and economic advances achieved in the occupied territories. Israel believed in the rights of the individual and faithfully abided by international treaties. It was now earnestly engaged in an attempt to find a constructive solution of the Palestinian question, under the Camp David agreements.\n\n23.

QUESTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN CHILE\n\n29. The Commission considered agenda item 5 at its 1555th and 1559th and 1563rd meetings held from 25 February to 29 February 1980.\n\n30. By its resolution 11 (XXXV) of 6 March 1979, the Commission had decided to consider at its thirty-sixth session, as a matter of high priority, the question of the violation of human rights in Chile. The Commission had authorized its Chairman, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 33/175 of 20 December 1978, to appoint Mr. Abdoulaye Dieye as Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Chile, who on the basis of the mandate in Commission resolution 8 (XXXI) of\n\n27 February 1975 and in contact with Chilean authorities was to inquire into the present situation of human rights in Chile and report to the General Assembly at its thirty-fourth session and to the Commission on Human Rights at its thirty-sixth session.\n\n31. By the same resolution, the Commission authorized its Chairman to appoint as\n\nexperts, in their individual capacity, Mr. FÈlix Ermacora and Mr. Waleed M. Sadi\n\nto study the question of the fate of missing and disappeared persons in Chile.\n\nIn August 1979, Mr. Waleed M. Sadi resigned his appointment as expert to study the fate of disappeared persons.\n\n32. By resolution 33/174 of 20 December 1978, the General Assembly decided to establish a voluntary fund, called the United Nations Trust Fund for Chile, for the purposes stated in paragraph 1 of that resolution.\n\n33. The Special Rapporteur had submitted his report (A/34/583) to the General Assembly. The expert had also submitted through the Special Rapporteur, his report to the General Assembly.\n\n34. By resolution 34/179 of 17 December 1979, the General Assembly expressed its grave concern about the deterioration in the situation of human rights in Chile in certain areas and requested the Commission on Human Rights to study thoroughly at its thirty-sixth session the reports of the Special Rapporteur and the report of the Expert on missing and disappeared persons and to continue to give close attention to the situation in Chile. To that end, it invited the Commission to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur in accordance with paragraph 6 of Commission resolution 11 (XXXV).\n\n35. The Commission had before it the following documents:\n\n(a) The report of the Special Rapporteur to the General Assembly at its thirty-fourth session (A/34/583);\n\n(b) The report of the Experts on missing and disappeared persons to the General Assembly at its thirty-fourth session (A/34/583/Add.1);\n\n(c) The report of the Secretary-General to the General Assembly at its thirty-fourth session on the United Nations Trust Fund for Chile (A/34/558/Add.1);\n\n(d) A document sent to the Secretary-General by the Permanent Representative\n\nof Chile to the United Nations entitled \"Consideration of the Government of Chile\n\non the examination of the present situation of human rights in the country\"\n\n(A/C.3/34/112);\n\n(e) The report of the Special Rapporteur to the Commission on Human Rights at its thirty-sixth session (E/CN.4/1362);\n\n(f) The report of the Expert on the question of disappeared persons in Chile to the Commission on Human Rights at its thirty-sixth session (E/CN.4/1363 and E/CN.4/1391);\n\n(g) The report submitted by the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the United Nations Trust Fund for Chile on behalf of the Board to the Commission on Human Rights at its thirty-sixth session on the operation of the Fund\n\n(E/CN.4/1364);\n\n(h) A written statement submitted by the World Peace Council, a non-governmental organization in consultative status (Roster) (E/CN.4/NGO/261);\n\n(i) A written communication submitted by the Inter-Parliamentary Union, a non-governmental organization in category I consultative status (E/CN.4/NGO/267);\n\n(j) A report prepared by the International Commission for Jurists, a non-governmental organization in category II consultative status (E/CN.4/NGO/269);\n\n(k) A written statement submitted by the Women's International Democratic Federation, a non-governmental organization in category I consultative status (E/CN.4/NGO/274).\n\n36. The Commission heard statements by the observers for the German Democratic Republic (1558th meeting), Hungary (1558th meeting), and Chile (1558th meeting).\n\n3T. The representatives of the following non-governmental organizations in consultative status made statements: International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, International Indian Treaty Council, International Commission of Jurists, World Federation of Trade Unions, International League for Human Rights and International Union of Students.\n\n38. At the 1535th meeting, the Chairman of the United Nations Trust Fund for Chile, Mr. Ghulam Ali Allana, introduced the report of the Board of Trustees (E/CN.4/1364). He stressed the role of the Fund in assisting, free from political considerations, the victims of violation of human rights and their relatives, inside and outside Chile. He expressed the hope that the Commission would appeal to Member States for contributions.\n\n39. At the 1555th meeting the Special Rapporteur, Mr. Abdoulaye Dieye, introduced his report contained in document E/CN.4/1362, which updated the report submitted to the General Assembly (A/34/583). He expressed his regret that the Chilean authorities had refused to co-operate on the grounds that the special procedure was discriminatory, and rejected the reasons invoked by the Chilean Government, stating that the grave situation of human rights in Chile, recognized as such by various United Nations organs and expert committees, justified the special procedure.\n\nHe added that an investigation should be carried out in other situations giving rise\n\nto serious concern. He indicated that the situation of human rights in Chile had not improved and in a number of areas had even deteriorated, and referred in particular to the maintenance of the state of emergency, the lack of independence of the courts of law, the violations of the rights to life, personal freedom and security, physical and moral integrity, the wider powers given to the security forces as well as to legal and other measures designed to stabilize and legalize a situation that in many aspects is at variance with international instruments to which Chile is a party, particularly the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.\n\n40. At the same meeting, Mr. Felix Ermacora, Expert on the question of the fate of missing and disappeared persons in Chile introduced his report contained in documents A/34/583/Add.1, E/CN.4/1363, E/CN.4/1381. He also deplored the lack of co-operation\n\nfrom the Chilean authorities and explained that the study had been prepared taking into account only 669 - not all - of the cases of missing persons, in which information from reliable sources proved conclusively that the persons have been arrested by military or security forces and never seen again. He added that in his view the key to the fate of missing persons was to be found in the action of the governmental security agency, DINA. He stressed the responsibility of the State regarding disappearance, and listed a number of recommendations relating to measures that should be taken in national and international legislation and, more specifically, measures concerning missing persons in Chile.\n\n4l. Many speakers praised the reports submitted by the Special Rapporteur and the Expert for their impartiality and objectivity, and declared that their countries supported the recommendations contained in those reports.\n\n42. Most of the speakers expressed grave concern about a deterioration of the situation of human rights in a number of areas, compared with that described in the last report of the Ad Hoc Working Group. Statements were made by some speakers about the increase in the number of cases of arbitrary arrest and detention, the deaths reported to have occurred for political reasons, and the persecution to which many persons had been subjected. They mentioned the increasing powers of the security agencies, the existence of secret places of detention, the use of torture for the interrogation of detainees, and treatment during arrest and the detention. Some speakers said that there was a climate of intimidation and terror within the country and that irregularities and arbitrariness continued to be the general rule. Others stated that flagrant and massive violations of human rights, especially torture, were engaged in more as a matter of policy than as an exception. A number of speakers, however, did not agree with the view that the human rights situation in Chile had deteriorated but saw improvements in certain sectors. Some delegates also expressed reservations at the special procedure applied against Chile which was not being used against human rights violations of similar or greater importance in other countries.\n\n43. Mention was repeatedly made of the lack of fundamental civil and political rights, such as the right to vote and the right to express opinions without interference. Some speakers referred to the state of emergency that had remained in force since 1973, despite several United Nations resolutions requesting the Chilean Government to put an end to it.\n\n44. Some representatives drew the attention of the Commission to the denial, to\n\nmany Chilean citizens, of the right to live in their own country, as well as the right to enter, stay in and leave it. They mentioned several cases of persons deprived of those rights, even when urgent humanitarian reasons were invoked.\n\n45. Many speakers expressed their concern also about the situation with respect to the rights of assembly and association, trade union rights, and the economic and social situation of wide sectors of the population and the lack of effective legal remedies. They also mentioned the situation of the indigenous population, whose culture was threatened as a result of new legislation concerning their property and official policies concerning their status.\n\n46. Most of the representatives expressed their grave concern at the problem of thousands of missing and disappeared persons. Some welcomed the fact that no new disappearances had been reported during 1978 and 1979, although the problem remains, since the fate of over 600 persons is still unknown. Many representatives stressed that the international community must request the Chilean Government to give explanations concerning the fate of those persons. Some delegations suggested the use of the new procedure on disappearance as an alternative method of handling the problem in Chile.\n\n47. Many speakers expressed the view that the Commission should continue to give close attention to the question of human rights in Chile and urge the Chilean authorities to respect human rights, in accordance with international instruments. One representative indicated that the consistent activities of the United Nations must achieve a positive result. Another delegation stated that further work on missing persons in Chile should be carried out by the Special Rapporteur.\n\n48. The need for concrete measures aimed at alleviating the suffering of persons whose human rights have been violated was also emphasized. Appeals for contributions to the Trust Fund for Chile were made by several delegations.\n\n49. At its 1558th meeting the observer for Chile repeated the objections of his Government against special ad hoc procedures. He added that the Chilean Government had co-operated with the Ad Hoc Working Group for a long time, even after it had been convinced of its inefficiency. That inefficiency was attributable to the fact that its members came from different regions of the world and, therefore, were not aware of the particular conditions existing in Chile. In seeking information these persons interfered in matters reserved to the sovereignty of the State concerned, and created new problems instead of solving them. Such procedures created a dangerous precedent, serving as means for interference in the internal affairs of small countries. The report of the Special Rapporteur tried to show that the Chilean Government had destroyed the economic and cultural bases of the country, whereas the facts were quite different. The observer for Chile cited a number of statistics concerning economic and social achievements of the present Government and said that they were confirmed in reports and documents published by international organizations such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Interamerican Bank for Development, the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Organization of American States. He called attention to the fact that no cases of missing or disappeared persons had been reported since May 1977 and rejected the evidence contained in the report of the Experts on the fate of missing persons concerning the responsibility of the Government for disappearances. In conclusion, he stated that Chile would persist in its refusal to accept ad hoc procedures and special entities, created without the previous consent of the country involved but\n\nwould collaborate with an international organization or specialized institution of a technical or humanitarian nature which applied general procedures.\n\n50. At the 1559th meeting, replying to the statement made by the observer for Chile,\n\nthe Special Rapporteur Mr. Abdoulaye Dieye stated that the special procedure to\n\ninvestigate the situation of human rights in Chile had been established in full\n\nagreement with the Chilean Government, including the composition of the Ad Hoc\n\nWorking Group. He added that while in Chile, in 1978, the Group had investigated\n\nthe situation as thoroughly as it could. Therefore, the comments about inefficiency\n\nand ignorance of the conditions within the country lacked substance. He noted that\n\nthe' observer for Chile referred to actual human rights problems in his country in\n\na very vague manner, and had not in his reply refuted the findings contained in the report. Furthermore, the observer for Chile had merely cast aspersions on the report without bothering to provide specific answers to the serious charges made against his Government. He reaffirmed that he had prepared his report in the light of principles contained in the pertinent international instruments and in strict compliance with the mandate that had been entrusted to him by the Commission on Human Rights.\n\n51. At the 1556th meeting, the representative of Denmark introduced a draft resolution (E/CN.4/L.1486) which was co-sponsored by the Netherlands. Algeria, Cuba and Yugoslavia submitted amendments to the draft resolution (E/CN.4/L.1511).\n\n52. At the 1563rd meeting on 29 February 1980, Iraq introduced oral amendments to the revised draft resolution submitted by Denmark and the Netherlands (E/CN.4/L.1486/Rev.1). The sponsors of the draft resolution accepted the amendments.\n\n53. A statement on the administrative and financial implications of the draft resolution was brought to the attention of the Commission (E/CN.4/L.1487). 1/\n\n54. The representative of Costa Rica requested a roll-call vote on the draft resolution as amended, which was adopted by 29 votes to 3, with 10 abstentions. The voting was as follows:\n\nIn favour: Algeria; Australia; Bulgaria; Burundi; Byelorussian Soviet\n\nSocialist Republic; Canada; Cuba; Cyprus; Denmark; Ethiopia; France; Germany, Federal Republic of; Ghana; Greece; India; Iran; Iraq; Mongolia; Morocco; Netherlands; Poland; Portugal, Senegal; Syrian Arab Republic; Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland; United States of America; Yugoslavia; Zambia.\n\nAgainst: Argentina; Brazil; Uruguay.\n\nAbstaining: Colombia; Costa Rica; Egypt; Ivory Coast; Jordan; Nigeria; Pakistan; Panama; Peru; Philippines.\n\n55. Statements in explanation of vote were made by the representatives of Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Costa Rica, Cuba, Egypt, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and Uruguay.\n\n56. For the text of the resolution, see Chapter XXVI, section A, resolution 21 (XXXVI). .\n\n1/ A statement of the financial implications of the Commission's resolutions and decisions appears in Annex III.\n\nIV. VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN SOUTHERN AFRICA: REPORT OF THE AD HOC WORKING GROUP OF EXPERTS\n\n57. The Commission considered agenda item 6 together with items 7, 16 and 20 (see chaps. V, XII, XV) at its 1547th to 1553rd meetings, held between 19 and 22 February 1980, and at its 1556th meeting on 26 February 1980.\n\n58. The Commission heard statements by the observers for the German Democratic Republic (l548th meeting), the Republic of Zaire (1550th meeting), and for Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Democratic Yemen (1551st meeting). It also heard statements by the representative of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) (1550th meeting), by the observer for the Palestine Liberation Organization (1551st meeting) and by the observer for the Organization of African Unity (1552nd meeting).\n\n59. The Commission also heard statements by the observers for the following non-governmental organizations in consultative status: International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (l548th meeting), and Amnesty International (1551st meeting).\n\n60. By its resolution 12 (XXXV) of 6 March 1979, the Commission had decided that the Ad Hoc Working Group of Experts should continue to study the policies and practices which violate human rights in South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe, and that it should carry out a comprehensive study on the action taken to implement the recommendations made by the Ad Hoc Working Group of Experts since its establishment, with a view to improved assessment of the further efforts needed in the struggle against the system of apartheid and against colonialism and racial discrimination\n\nin southern Africa. The Commission had also requested the Ad Hoc Working Group of Experts to continue to institute inquiries in respect of any persons suspected of having been guilty of the crime of apartheid or of a serious violation of human rights in Namibia, and to bring the result of those inquiries to\n\nthe attention of the Commission on Human Rights. The Working Group had also been requested to submit a progress report to the Commission at its thirty-sixth session.\n\n61. By the same resolution (para. 17), the Commission had also requested the\n\nAd hoc Working Group, in co-operation with the Special Committee against Apartheid, to investigate the cases of torture and murder of detainees in South Africa contained in the report drawn up by the Special Committee against Apartheid contained in document E/CN.4/1327/Add.2, and to submit a special report on this investigation to the Commission at its thirty-sixth session.\n\n62. For its part, the Economic and Social Council, by its resolution 1979/39, adopted on 10 Majr 1979, had requested the Ad Hoc Working Group of Experts to continue to study allegations regarding infringements of trade union rights in South Africa, and to report thereon to the Commission and to the Economic and Social Council at such times as it may consider appropriate.\n\n63. The Ad Hoc Working Group of Experts, consisting of six members appointed in their personal capacity by the Chairman of the thirty-fifth session of the Commission, was composed of the following experts: Mr. Keba M'Baye (Senegal),\n\nChairman-Rapporteur; Mr. Branimir Yankovic (Yugoslavia), Vice-Chairman; Dr. Annan Arkyin Cato (Ghana); Mr. Humberto Diaz-Casanueva (Chile); Mr. Felix Ermacora (Austria); and Mr. Mulka Govinda Reddy (India).\n\n64. The General Assembly, by its resolution 34/24, adopted on 15 November 1979, and in particular paragraph 20 of the programme of activities annexed to that resolution, requested the Group to undertake a study in 1980 on the ways and means of implementing international instruments, such as the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid, including the establishment of the international jurisdiction envisaged by the Convention.\n\n65. The Commission had before it the following documents:\n\n(a) The progress report (E/CN.4/1365) of the Ad Hoc Working Group of Experts prepared in accordance with Commission resolution 12 (XXXV) and Economic and Social Council decision 1979/34;\n\n(b) The special report (E/CN.4/1366) prepared in accordance with Commission resolution 12 (XXXV), paragraph 17;\n\n(c) A written statement submitted by the Afro-Asian Peoples Solidarity Organization, a non-governmental organization in category II consultative status (E/CN.4/NGO/278);\n\n(d) A written statement submitted by the World Peace Council, a\n\nnon-governmental organization in consultative status (Roster) (E/CN.4/NG0/279)ï\n\n66. At the 1547th meeting of the Commission, the Chairman of the Ad Hoc Working Group of Experts, Mr. Keba M'Baye, introduced the two reports contained in documents E/CN.V1365 and E/CN.U/1366. In presenting the progress report, he stated that no changes had occurred in South Africa and in Namibia with respect to the human rights situation. The structure of apartheid continued to be as described in the Group's reports. The attitude of the South African authorities in persisting in their illegal policy of apartheid and their illegal occupation of Namibia was in defiance of the will of the international community and constituted a challenge to mankind. In his opinion, the people subjected to the oppression of apartheid had no other recourse than violence. As regards Zimbabwe, he stressed that the international community should maintain its vigilance even though the present situation permitted some hope. In connexion with the special report, it was the view of the Group that torture by the security police was common practice and that the Government seemed to acquiesce in it and cover it up by all possible means.\n\n67. Many speakers expressed their appreciation to the Ad Hoc Working Group and praised the reports which contained valuable information and an objective analysis. They stressed that the special report should be given the highest priority and suggested that the list of cases on murder and torture contained in the Group's report should receive a wide publicity in order to make it known to a large number of people in the world. Wide support was expressed for the recommendation made by the Ad Hoc Working Group of Experts to publish, in the greatest possible number of newspapers, the list of persons guilty of the crime of apartheid.\n\n68. Many speakers expressed indignation at the horror and inhumanity of the\n\nthat no sign of improvement had been reported so far despite repeated appeals by the United Nations. They stated that, as described in the report of the Working Group of Experts , South Africa continued to pursue its oppressive measures against the black people. It was stressed that the consistent and flagrant violation of human rights in South Africa and in Namibia could not be tolerated by the international community. They expressed deep concern at the reported death penalties, executions of members of liberation movements, mass arrests, torture and murder of detainees while in prison.\n\n69. A large number of speakers expressed great concern over the removal of the African population and condemned the systematic deprivation of citizenship through bantustanization and the so-called independent homeland policy. It was said that such practice constituted a destruction of black people's identity and unity and deprived them of real self-determination.\n\n70. Many representatives strongly condemned the South African military presence in Namibia. They stated that the illegal occupation by South Africa constituted a deliberate violation of United Nations resolutions and decisions. The racist regime of Pretoria, it was stated, had extended its abhorrent doctrine of racial segregation into Namibia, and concern was expressed about the repression and executions carried out against the freedom fighters. It was stated that South Africa carried out incursions into the territories of the neighbouring independent African States and threatened the peace and security of the region. Some speakers observed in that connexion that armed struggle by the people of Namibia was the only effective means of achieving self-determination. A number of representatives stated that their countries supported the liberation movements in Namibia and in South Africa and appealed to the international community to give moral and material support to SWAPO, the legitimate representative of the Namibian people.\n\n71. Most speakers expressed hope and satisfaction as regards the recent political development in Zimbabwe. They welcomed the consensus reached by all parties concerned at Lancaster House, which should lead to freedom and independence of the people of Zimbabwe.\n\n72. Several representatives stated that, if the international community had failed to eradicate the evils of apartheid in South Africa, it was because some member States, particularly Western countries and their transnational corporations, continued to supply the apartheid regime with economic and military assistance and because none of them has ratified or acceded to the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid.\n\n73. Other speakers stated that a peaceful solution through political pressure and dialogue should be aimed at. They expressed objection to violent measures such as armed struggle. The opinion was also expressed that the code of conduct for firms dealing with South Africa had a beneficial effect in eliminating apartheid.\n\n74. Some speakers drew the attention of the Commission to the problem of refugees from southern Africa and appealed to the international community for assistance.\n\n75. Referring to the trade union rights in South Africa, one speaker stated that new legislation now in force gave administrators discretionary powers to grant concessions to black trade unions or to refuse or withdraw concessions.\n\n76. At the 1553rd meeting, on 22 February 1980, the representative of Senegal introduced a draft resolution (E/CN.4/L.IU95) sponsored by Burundi, Egypt, Ghana, India, Iraq, Jordan, Morocco, Nigeria, Philippines, Senegal, Syrian Arab Republic and Yugoslavia.\n\n77. At the 1556th meeting the draft resolution was adopted by 32 votes to none.\n\n78. The representatives of Nigeria, Yugoslavia and Cuba stated that, had they been present at the time of the vote, they would have voted in favour.\n\n79. For the text of the resolution, see chapter XXVI, section A, resolution 9 (XXXVI).\n\n80. At its 158lst meeting on 14 March 198O the Commission decided to send the following telegram 1/ to the Prime Minister designate of Zimbabwe:\n\n\"The Commission on Human Rights wishes to congratulate through you all the people of Zimbabwe for the victory that they have just achieved. The Commission has always supported the just struggle of the people of Zimbabwe for the realisation of their right to self-determination independence and an equitable place in the international community as an independent nation. The Commission takes this opportunity to convey to the whole people of Zimbabwe its best wishes for their further success and prosperity.\"\n\n1/ See chap. XXVI, sect. B, decision 17 (XXXVI).\n\nV. THE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE ENJOYMENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS OF POLITICAL, MILITARY, ECONOMIC AND OTHER. FORMS OF ASSISTANCE GIVEN TO COLONIAL AND RACIST REGIMES IN SOUTHERN AFRICA\n\n81. The Commission considered agenda item 7 together with items 6, l6 and 20 (see chaps. IV, XII and XV), at its 1544th and 1547th to 1553rd meetings, held from 18 to 22 February 1980, and at its 1556th meeting on 26 February 1980.\n\n82. The Commission had before it a written declaration submitted by the Women's International Democratic Federation (E/CN.4/NGO/281);\n\n83. The Commission had before it the final report (E/CN.4/Sub.2Al5 and Corr.l and 2 and Add.1-6) prepared by Mr. Ahmed M. Khalifa, Special Rapporteur, pursuant to Commission resolution 9 (XXXV) and resolution 2 (XXXI) of the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities; the paper contained a revised provisional general list of banks, firms and other organizations which give assistance to the colonial and racist regimes of southern Africa.\n\n81. The Commission heard statements by the observers for the German Democratic Republic (l548th meeting), Zaire (1550th meeting), Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Democratic Yemen (1551st meeting), the representative of the Palestine Liberation Organization (1551st meeting) and the representative of the Organization of African Unity (1552nd meeting).\n\n85. A statement was also made, at the 1551st meeting, by the representative of Amnesty International, a non-governmental organization in category II consultative status.\n\n86. In introducing his report at the 1544-th meeting, Mr. Khalifa stressed that it might be considered as an annex to his previous report, which had already been published (E/CN.4/Sub.2/383/Rev.2). 1/ The first gave a general assessment of the role of assistance given to colonial and racist regimes in southern Africa. The second contained a detailed list of violators of United Nations resolutions and its goal should be their identification and exposure to the whole world community. He indicated that the list was not final; it did not contain judicial proof of its assertions and on no account was it intended to initiate judicial proceedings against those firms or organizations appearing on the lists. Responding to the argument that the list was rather arbitrary, he stated his willingness to incorporate changes or improvements in order to make it more balanced, and to include any information concerning any country of the world. In that connexion he drew attention to the replies of Governments. Some of them were constructive and had led, for example, to the deletion of one Danish firm from the list, but he was generally disappointed since only 8 out of 25 countries mentioned in the list had sent replies. His impression was that some of them, while verbally condemning violations of human rights in southern Africa gave precedence to free trade over action to eliminate such violations. He reiterated\n\n1/ United Nations publication, Sales No. E.79.XIV.3.\n\nhis profound conviction that the maintenance of trade and other relations with southern Africa constituted support for the racist and colonial regimes and encouragement for the violation of human rights.\n\n87. Many speakers expressed their thanks to the Special Rapporteur and congratulated him on his excellent and serious report, they agreed that the list should be published and widely disseminated through the mass media.\n\n88. The view was expressed that the list constituted prima facie evidence of the intensification of assistance and support aimed at perpetuating the crime of apartheid. Such support and assistance strengthened the power of the white racists; it did not contribute to improvement of living standards of the indigenous population, but rather to exploitation of cheap labour and further violation of human rights.\n\n89. Member countries of the Worth Atlantic Treaty Organization and Israel were described by some speakers as major accomplices of the racist and apartheid regimes. They were accused of hypocrisy because they verbally denounced violations of human rights but, in the case of southern Africa, used the pretext of free enterprise to tolerate mass and gross violations of human rights.\n\n90. The role of transnational corporations as the main supporters of the apartheid regimes was also highlighted by some members.\n\n91. Many speakers drew the Commission's attention to continuing military co-operation with, and nuclear build-up in, southern Africa, which endangered international peace and security. They stated that States and corporations extending such co-operation bore a grave responsibility.\n\n92. The need for strict application of United Nations resolutions concerning a boycott and sanctions against the racist and colonial regimes was expressed.\n\n93. Several delegations stated that their countries did not maintain any relations with those regimes.\n\n94. Others pointed out that they did not subscribe to the belief that all forms of contact with the Government of South Africa were detrimental to the enjoyment of human rights in South Africa. Certain forms of contact in the political or economic field helped to promote change and dialogue in South Africa. Trade between private firms could not be considered as constituting official or unofficial assistance to the Government. It was understood that countries associated with the South African economy had a responsibility to the people of South Africa and they discharged that responsibility with full regard for the fundamental rights of the people concerned.\n\n95. Those delegations stated that in their view the value of Mr. Khalifa's report was further reduced by its bias and by the fact that it failed to take into account the volume of trade between South Africa and some countries which had been active in the debate in making allegations against other countries. Commercial statistics published by international organizations showed that trade patterns between certain countries and South Africa provided evidence of important commercial and trade transactions which did not appear in the list.\n\n96. At the 1553rd meeting on 22 February 1980., the representative of Nigeria introduced a draft resolution sponsored by Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Nigeria, Senegal, Yugoslavia and Zambia (E/CN.4/L.1499) and a draft resolution sponsored by Algeria, Burundi, Democratic Yemen, Ethiopia, Ghana, Iraq, Jordan, Nigeria, Senegal and Zambia (E/CN.4/L.1497).\n\n97.
