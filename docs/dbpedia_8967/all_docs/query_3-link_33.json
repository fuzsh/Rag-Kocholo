We sequenced the exomes of three unrelated individuals with hereditary PCC (cases) and identified mutations in MAX, the MYC associated factor X gene. Absence of MAX protein in the tumors and loss of heterozygosity caused by uniparental disomy supported the involvement of MAX alterations in the disease. A follow-up study of a selected series of 59 cases with PCC identified five additional MAX mutations and suggested an association with malignant outcome and preferential paternal transmission of MAX mutations. The involvement of the MYC-MAX-MXD1 network in the development and progression of neural crest cell tumors is further supported by the lack of functional MAX in rat PCC (PC12) cells and by the amplification of MYCN in neuroblastoma and suggests that loss of MAX function is correlated with metastatic potential.\n\nTranscription factor mutations in myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms\n\nPubMed Central\n\nErnst, Thomas; Chase, Andrew; Zoi, Katerina; Waghorn, Katherine; Hidalgo-Curtis, Claire; Score, Joannah; Jones, Amy; Grand, Francis; Reiter, Andreas; Hochhaus, Andreas; Cross, Nicholas C.P.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nBackground Aberrant activation of tyrosine kinases, caused by either mutation or gene fusion, is of major importance for the development of many hematologic malignancies, particularly myeloproliferative neoplasms. We hypothesized that hitherto unrecognized, cytogenetically cryptic tyrosine kinase fusions may be common in non-classical or atypical myeloproliferative neoplasms and related myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms. Design and Methods To detect genomic copy number changes associated with such fusions, we performed a systematic search in 68 patients using custom designed, targeted, high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization. Arrays contained 44,000 oligonucleotide probes that targeted 500 genes including all 90 tyrosine kinases plus downstream tyrosine kinase signaling components, other translocation targets, transcription factors, and other factors known to be important for myelopoiesis. Results No abnormalities involving tyrosine kinases were detected; however, nine cytogenetically cryptic copy number imbalances were detected in seven patients, including hemizygous deletions of RUNX1 or CEBPA in two cases with atypical chronic myeloid leukemia. Mutation analysis of the remaining alleles revealed non-mutated RUNX1 and a frameshift insertion within CEBPA. A further mutation screen of 187 patients with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms identified RUNX1 mutations in 27 (14%) and CEBPA mutations in seven (4%) patients. Analysis of other transcription factors known to be frequently mutated in acute myeloid leukemia revealed NPM1 mutations in six (3%) and WT1 mutations in two (1%) patients with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms. Univariate analysis indicated that patients with mutations had a shorter overall survival (28 versus 44 months, P=0.019) compared with patients without mutations, with the prognosis for cases with CEBPA, NPM1 or WT1 mutations being particularly poor. Conclusions We conclude that mutations of\n\nG20210A prothrombin gene mutation identified in patients with venous leg ulcers.\n\nPubMed\n\nJebeleanu, G; Procopciuc, L\n\n2001-01-01\n\nThe G20210A mutation variant of prothrombin gene is the second most frequent mutation identified in patients with deep venous thrombosis, after factor V Leiden. The risk for developing deep venous thrombosis is high in patients identified as heterozygous for G20210A mutation. In order to identify this polymorphism in the gene coding prothrombin, the 345bp fragment in the 3'- untranslated region of the prothrombin gene was amplified using amplification by polymerase chain reaction and enzymatic digestion by HindIII (restriction endonuclease enzyme). The products of amplification and enzymatic's digestion were analized using agarose gel electrophoresis. We investigated 20 patients with venous leg ulcers and we found 2 heterozygous (10%) for G20210A mutation. None of the patients in the control group had G20210A mutation. Our study confirms the presence of G20210A mutation in the Romanian population. Our study also shows the link between venous leg ulcers and this polymorphism in the prothrombin gene.\n\nDeep mutational scanning identifies sites in influenza nucleoprotein that affect viral inhibition by MxA\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAshenberg, Orr; Padmakumar, Jai\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe innate-immune restriction factor MxA inhibits influenza replication by targeting the viral nucleoprotein (NP). Human influenza virus is more resistant than avian influenza virus to inhibition by human MxA, and prior work has compared human and avian viral strains to identify amino-acid differences in NP that affect sensitivity to MxA. However, this strategy is limited to identifying sites in NP where mutations that affect MxA sensitivity have fixed during the small number of documented zoonotic transmissions of influenza to humans. Here we use an unbiased deep mutational scanning approach to quantify how all single amino-acid mutations to NP affect MxA sensitivity in the context of replication-competent virus. We both identify new sites in NP where mutations affect MxA resistance and re-identify mutations known to have increased MxA resistance during historical adaptations of influenza to humans. Most of the sites where mutations have the greatest effect are almost completely conserved across all influenza A viruses, and the amino acids at these sites confer relatively high resistance to MxA. These sites cluster in regions of NP that appear to be important for its recognition by MxA. Overall, our work systematically identifies the sites in influenza nucleoprotein where mutations affect sensitivity to MxA. We also demonstrate a powerful new strategy for identifying regions of viral proteins that affect inhibition by host factors.

We aimed to screen the mutations of both genes in gastric carcinoma to detect the suitability of EGFR TKIs for patients with gastric carcinoma. We screened EGFR mutation in exons 19-21 and KRAS mutation in exon 2 in 58 gastric adenocarcinomas from China using high resolution melting analysis (HRMA). Positive samples were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Three EGFR missense mutations (5.2%) and 22 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP, Q787Q, 37.9%) were identified. To our knowledge, we report for the first time three mutation patterns of EGFR, Y801C, L858R and G863D, in gastric carcinoma. Two samples with EGFR mutation were mucinous adenocarcinoma. These three samples were collected from male patients aged over 75 years old. The frequency of KRAS mutation was 10.3% (6/58). The exclusiveness of EGFR and KRAS mutations was proven for the first time in gastric cancer. Gastric carcinoma of the mucinous adenocarcinoma type collected from older male patients may harbour EGFR mutations. The small subset of gastric adenocarcinoma patients may respond to EGFR TKIs.\n\nMutations of RNA splicing factors in hematological malignancies.\n\nPubMed\n\nShukla, Girish C; Singh, Jagjit\n\n2017-11-28\n\nSystematic large-scale cancer genomic studies have produced numerous significant findings. These studies have not only revealed new cancer-promoting genes, but they also have identified cancer-promoting functions of previously known \"housekeeping\" genes. These studies have identified numerous mutations in genes which play a fundamental role in nuclear precursor mRNA splicing. Somatic mutations and copy number variation in many of the splicing factors which participate in the formation of multiple spliceosomal complexes appear to play a role in many cancers and in particular in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Mutated proteins seem to interfere with the recognition of the authentic splice sites (SS) leading to utilization of suboptimal alternative splicing sites generating aberrantly spliced mRNA isoforms. This short review is focusing on the function of the splice factors involved in the formation of splicing complexes and potential mechanisms which affect usage of the authentic splice site recognition.

Genes studied in â¥15, and mutated in â¥10 samples of a cancer have been considered recurrently mutated, and pathways with recurrently mutated genes have been considered affected in the cancer. Novel doughnut plots have been presented which enable visualization of the extent to which pathways and genes, in each pathway group, are targeted, in each cancer. The 'organismal systems' pathway group (including organism-level pathways; e.g., nervous system) is the most targeted, more than even the well-recognized signal transduction, cell-cycle and apoptosis, and DNA repair pathway groups. The important, yet poorly-recognized, role played by the group merits attention. Pathways affected in â¥7 cancers yielded insights into processes affected. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The case-control study was conducted at the Department of Haematology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rawalpindi, Pakistan, from January to June 2012, and comprised women of 18 to 45 years of age who had a history of recurrent pregnancy loss, and controls with no history of pregnancy loss. All the subjects belonged to Punjabi ethnic group. Three ml blood was taken from cases and controls and deoxyribonucleic acid was extracted. In order to identify Factor V Leiden mutation, polymerase chain reaction method was utilised combined with the amplification refractory mutation system. Data was analysed using SPSS 17. Of the 112 subjects, 56(50%) were in each of the two groups. The presence of factor V Leiden mutation among the cases was 3(5.4%) while it was absent among the controls. The mutation was significantly associated with recurrent pregnancy loss (p=0.017).Recurrent pregnancy loss was higher in cases than controls (p=0.001).

Methods One hundred ninety-four (194) Japanese subjects from unrelated families were enrolled in the study. Targeted genomic enrichment and massively parallel sequencing of all known non-syndromic hearing loss genes were performed to identify the genetic causes of hearing loss. Results A novel mutation in the P2RX2 gene, that corresponded to c.601G>A (p.Asp201Tyr) was identified. Two patients carried the mutation, and had severe SNHL, while other members with MELAS (who did not carry the P2RX2 mutation) had normal hearing. Conclusion This is the first case report of a diagnosis of hearing loss caused by P2RX2 mutation in patients with MELAS. A potential explanation is that decreasing ATP production due to MELAS with mitochondrial 3243A>G mutation might suppress activation of P2X2 receptors. We also suggest that hearing loss caused by the P2RX2 mutation might be influenced by the decrease in ATP production due to MELAS, and that nuclear genetic factors may play a modifying role in mitochondrial dysfunction.

We identified a total of 323 mutations which were either non-synonymous (nâ=â238) or synonymous (nâ=â85). Furthermore, our analysis revealed genes in key cancer pathways (DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, immune response, lipid signaling) were mutated, of which those in the lipid-signaling pathway were the most enriched. We next extended our analysis on a prioritized sub-set of 37 mutated genes plus top 5 mutated cancer genes listed in COSMIC using a custom designed HaloPlex target enrichment panel with an additional 88 NPC samples. Our analysis identified 160 additional non-synonymous mutations in 37/42 genes in 66/88 samples. Of these, 99/160 mutations within potentially druggable pathways were further selected for validation. Sanger sequencing revealed that 77/99 variants were true positives, giving an accuracy of 78%. Taken together, our study indicated that ~72% (nâ=â71/98) of NPC samples harbored mutations in one of the four cancer pathways (EGFR-PI3K-Akt-mTOR, NOTCH, NF-ÎºB, DNA repair) which may be potentially useful as predictive biomarkers of response to matched targeted therapies.\n\nExome Sequencing Identifies Potentially Druggable Mutations in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChow, Yock Ping; Tan, Lu Ping; Chai, San Jiun; Abdul Aziz, Norazlin; Choo, Siew Woh; Lim, Paul Vey Hong; Pathmanathan, Rajadurai; Mohd Kornain, Noor Kaslina; Lum, Chee Lun; Pua, Kin Choo; Yap, Yoke Yeow; Tan, Tee Yong; Teo, Soo Hwang; Khoo, Alan Soo-Beng; Patel, Vyomesh\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIn this study, we first performed whole exome sequencing of DNA from 10 untreated and clinically annotated fresh frozen nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) biopsies and matched bloods to identify somatically mutated genes that may be amenable to targeted therapeutic strategies.

However, most approaches for identifying cancer mutations focus on either the entire-gene or single amino-acid level. We have bridged these two methodologies with a multiscale mutation clustering algorithm that identifies variable length mutation clusters in cancer genes. We ran our algorithm on 539 genes using the combined mutation data in 23 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and identified 1295 mutation clusters. The resulting mutation clusters cover a wide range of scales and often overlap with many kinds of protein features including structured domains, phosphorylation sites, and known single nucleotide variants. We statistically associated these multiscale clusters with gene expression and drug response data to illuminate the functional and clinical consequences of mutations in our clusters. Interestingly, we find multiple clusters within individual genes that have differential functional associations: these include PTEN, FUBP1, and CDH1. This methodology has potential implications in identifying protein regions for drug targets, understanding the biological underpinnings of cancer, and personalizing cancer treatments. Toward this end, we have made the mutation clusters and the clustering algorithm available to the public. Clusters and pathway associations can be interactively browsed at m2c.systemsbiology.net.

For some point mutations, specific neighboring bases are known to be mechanistically influential. Beyond these cases, numerous questions remain unresolved, including: what are the sequence motifs that affect point mutations? How large are the motifs? Are they strand symmetric? And, do they vary between samples? We present new log-linear models that allow explicit examination of these questions, along with sequence logo style visualization to enable identifying specific motifs. We demonstrate the performance of these methods by analyzing mutation processes in human germline and malignant melanoma. We recapitulate the known CpG effect, and identify novel motifs, including a highly significant motif associated with AâG mutations. We show that major effects of neighbors on germline mutation lie within Â±2 of the mutating base. Models are also presented for contrasting the entire mutation spectra (the distribution of the different point mutations). We show the spectra vary significantly between autosomes and X-chromosome, with a difference in TâC transition dominating. Analyses of malignant melanoma confirmed reported characteristic features of this cancer, including statistically significant strand asymmetry, and markedly different neighboring influences. The methods we present are made freely available as a Python library https://bitbucket.org/pycogent3/mutationmotif.

To date, three pathogenic genes (TCOF1, POLR1D and POLR1C) have been identified. In this study, we conducted mutational analysis on Chinese TCS patients to reveal a mutational spectrum of known causative genes and show phenotype-genotype data to provide more information for gene counselling and future studies on the pathogenesis of TCS. Twenty-two TCS patients were recruited from two tertiary referral centres, and Sanger sequencing for the coding exons and exon-intron boundaries of TCOF1, POLR1D and POLR1C was performed. For patients without small variants, further copy number variations (CNVs) analysis was conducted using high-density SNP array platforms. The Sanger sequencing overall mutation detection rate was as high as 86.3% (19/22) for our cohort. Fifteen TCOF1 pathogenic variants, including ten novel mutations, were identified in nineteen patients. No causative mutations in POLR1D and POLR1C genes and no CNVs mutations were detected. A suspected autosomal dominant inheritance case that implies germinal mosaicism was described. Our study confirmed that TCOF1 was the main disease-causing gene for the Chinese TCS population and revealed its mutation spectrum. We also addressed the need for more studies of mosaicism in TCS cases, which could explain the mechanism of autosomal dominant inheritance in TCS cases and benefit the prevention of TCS.\n\nTargeted next generation sequencing identifies novel NOTCH3 gene mutations in CADASIL diagnostics patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nMaksemous, Neven; Smith, Robert A; Haupt, Larisa M; Griffiths, Lyn R\n\n2016-11-24\n\nCerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a monogenic, hereditary, small vessel disease of the brain causing stroke and vascular dementia in adults. CADASIL has previously been shown to be caused by varying mutations in the NOTCH3 gene. The disorder is often misdiagnosed due to its significant clinical heterogeneic manifestation with familial hemiplegic migraine and several ataxia disorders as well as the location of the currently identified causative mutations. The aim of this study was to develop a new, comprehensive and efficient single assay strategy for complete molecular diagnosis of NOTCH3 mutations through the use of a custom next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel for improved routine clinical molecular diagnostic testing. Our custom NGS panel identified nine genetic variants in NOTCH3 (p.D139V, p.C183R, p.R332C, p.Y465C, p.C597W, p.R607H, p.E813E, p.C977G and p.Y1106C). Six mutations were stereotypical CADASIL mutations leading to an odd number of cysteine residues in one of the 34 NOTCH3 gene epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats, including three new typical cysteine mutations identified in exon 11 (p.C597W; c.1791C>G); exon 18 (p.C977G; c.2929T>G) and exon 20 (p.Y1106C; c.3317A>G). Interestingly, a novel missense mutation in the CACNA1A gene was also identified in one CADASIL patient. All variants identified (novel and known) were further investigated using in silico bioinformatic analyses and confirmed through Sanger sequencing. NGS provides an improved and effective methodology for the diagnosis of CADASIL. The NGS approach reduced time and cost for comprehensive genetic diagnosis, placing genetic diagnostic testing within reach of more patients.\n\nIdentifying RNA splicing factors using IFT genes in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.\n\nPubMed\n\nLin, Huawen; Zhang, Zhengyan; Iomini, Carlo; Dutcher, Susan K\n\n2018-03-01\n\nIntraflagellar transport moves proteins in and out of flagella/cilia and it is essential for the assembly of these organelles. Using whole-genome sequencing, we identified splice site mutations in two IFT genes, IFT81 ( fla9 ) and IFT121 ( ift121-2 ), which lead to flagellar assembly defects in the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii The splicing defects in these ift mutants are partially corrected by mutations in two conserved spliceosome proteins, DGR14 and FRA10. We identified a dgr14 deletion mutant, which suppresses the 3' splice site mutation in IFT81 , and a frameshift mutant of FRA10 , which suppresses the 5' splice site mutation in IFT121 Surprisingly, we found dgr14-1 and fra10 mutations suppress both splice site mutations. We suggest these two proteins are involved in facilitating splice site recognition/interaction; in their absence some splice site mutations are tolerated. Nonsense mutations in SMG1 , which is involved in nonsense-mediated decay, lead to accumulation of aberrant transcripts and partial restoration of flagellar assembly in the ift mutants. The high density of introns and the conservation of noncore splicing factors, together with the ease of scoring the ift mutant phenotype, make Chlamydomonas an attractive organism to identify new proteins involved in splicing through suppressor screening.

In contrast, heterozygous factor XIII deficiency is more common, but usually not associated with severe hemorrhage such as intracranial bleeding or hemarthrosis. In most cases, the disease is caused by F13A gene mutations. Causative mutations associated with the F13B gene are rarer. Design and Methods We analyzed ten index patients and three relatives for factor XIII activity using a photometric assay and sequenced their F13A and F13B genes. Additionally, structural analysis of the wild-type protein structure from a previously reported X-ray crystallographic model identified potential structural and functional effects of the missense mutations. Results All individuals except one were heterozygous for factor XIIIA mutations (average factor XIII activity 51%), while the remaining homozygous individual was found to have severe factor XIII deficiency (<5% of normal factor XIII activity). Eight of the 12 heterozygous patients exhibited a bleeding tendency upon provocation. Conclusions The identified missense (Pro289Arg, Arg611His, Asp668Gly) and nonsense (Gly390X, Trp664X) mutations are causative for factor XIII deficiency. A Gly592Ser variant identified in three unrelated index patients, as well as in 200 healthy controls (minor allele frequency 0.005), and two further Tyr167Cys and Arg540Gln variants, represent possible candidates for rare F13A gene polymorphisms since they apparently do not have a significant influence on the structure of the factor XIIIA protein. Future in vitro expression studies of the factor XIII mutations are required to confirm their pathological mechanisms.

Mitochondrial dysfunction is a common cause of this group of diseases, but the underlying gene defects have been characterized in only a minority of cases, because tissue specificity of the manifestation hampers functional cloning and the heterogeneity of causative factors hinders collection of informative family materials. We sequenced the exome of a patient who died at the age of 10Â months of hypertrophic mitochondrial cardiomyopathy with combined cardiac respiratory chain complex I and IV deficiency. Rigorous data analysis allowed us to identify a homozygous missense mutation in AARS2, which we showed to encode the mitochondrial alanyl-tRNA synthetase (mtAlaRS). Two siblings from another family, both of whom died perinatally of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, had the same mutation, compound heterozygous with another missense mutation. Protein structure modeling of mtAlaRS suggested that one of the mutations affected a unique tRNA recognition site in the editing domain, leading to incorrect tRNA aminoacylation, whereas the second mutation severely disturbed the catalytic function, preventing tRNA aminoacylation. We show here that mutations in AARS2 cause perinatal or infantile cardiomyopathy with near-total combined mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency in the heart. Our results indicate that exome sequencing is a powerful tool for identifying mutations in single patients and allows recognition of the genetic background in single-gene disorders of variable clinical manifestation and tissue-specific disease. Furthermore, we show that mitochondrial disorders extend to prenatal life and are an important cause of early infantile cardiac failure.

To date, less than 25 different mutations have been reported. So far, there are still little data on the key clinical diagnosis criteria and on the natural history of CDKL5-associated encephalopathy. We screened the entire coding region of CDKL5 for mutations in 183 females with encephalopathy with early seizures by denaturing high liquid performance chromatography and direct sequencing, and we identified in 20 unrelated girls, 18 different mutations including 7 novel mutations. These mutations were identified in eight patients with encephalopathy with RTT-like features, five with infantile spasms and seven with encephalopathy with refractory epilepsy. Early epilepsy with normal interictal EEG and severe hypotonia are the key clinical features in identifying patients likely to have CDKL5 mutations. Our study also indicates that these patients clearly exhibit some RTT features such as deceleration of head growth, stereotypies and hand apraxia and that these RTT features become more evident in older and ambulatory patients. However, some RTT signs are clearly absent such as the so called RTT disease profile (period of nearly normal development followed by regression with loss of acquired fine finger skill in early childhood and characteristic intensive eye communication) and the characteristic evolution of the RTT electroencephalogram. Interestingly, in addition to the overall stereotypical symptomatology (age of onset and evolution of the disease) resulting from CDKL5 mutations, atypical forms of CDKL5-related conditions have also been observed. Our data suggest that phenotypic heterogeneity does not correlate with the nature or the position of the mutations or with the pattern of X-chromosome inactivation, but most probably with the functional transcriptional and/or translational consequences of CDKL5\n\nA new mutation identified in SPATA16 in two globozoospermic patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nElInati, Elias; Fossard, Camille; Okutman, Ozlem; GhÃ©dir, Houda; Ibala-Romdhane, Samira; Ray, Pierre F; Saad, Ali; Hennebicq, Sylvianne; Viville, StÃ©phane\n\n2016-06-01\n\nThe aim of this study is to identify potential genes involved in human globozoopsermia. Nineteen globozoospermic patients (previously screened for DPY19L2 mutations with no causative mutation) were recruited in this study and screened for mutations in genes implicated in human globozoospermia SPATA16 and PICK1. Using the candidate gene approach and the determination of Spata16 partners by Glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down four genes were also selected and screened for mutations. We identified a novel mutation of SPATA16: deletion of 22.6Â Kb encompassing the first coding exon in two unrelated Tunisian patients who presented the same deletion breakpoints. The two patients shared the same haplotype, suggesting a possible ancestral founder effect for this new deletion. Four genes were selected using the candidate gene approach and the GST pull-down (GOPC, PICK1, AGFG1 and IRGC) and were screened for mutation, but no variation was identified. The present study confirms the pathogenicity of the SPATA16 mutations. The fact that no variation was detected in the coding sequence of AFGF1, GOPC, PICK1 and IRGC does not mean that they are not involved in human globozoospermia. A larger globozoospermic cohort must be studied in order to accelerate the process of identifying new genes involved in such phenotypes. Until sufficient numbers of patients have been screened, AFGF1, GOPC, PICK1 and IRGC should still be considered as candidate genes.\n\nWhole-genome sequencing identifies recurrent mutations in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPuente, Xose S.; Pinyol, Magda; Quesada, VÃ­ctor; Conde, Laura; OrdÃ³Ã±ez, Gonzalo R.; Villamor, Neus; Escaramis, Georgia; Jares, Pedro; BeÃ , SÃ­lvia; GonzÃ¡lez-DÃ­az, Marcos; Bassaganyas, Laia; Baumann, Tycho; Juan, Manel; LÃ³pez-Guerra, MÃ³nica; Colomer, Dolors; TubÃ­o, JosÃ© M.

Two major molecular subtypes can be distinguished, characterized respectively by a high or low number of somatic hypermutations in the variable region of immunoglobulin genes3,4. The molecular changes leading to the pathogenesis of the disease are still poorly understood. Here we performed whole-genome sequencing of four cases of CLL and identified 46 somatic mutations that potentially affect gene function. Further analysis of these mutations in 363 patients with CLL identified four genes that are recurrently mutated: notch 1 (NOTCH1), exportin 1 (XPO1), myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MYD88) and kelch-like 6 (KLHL6). Mutations in MYD88 and KLHL6 are predominant in cases of CLL with mutated immunoglobulin genes, whereas NOTCH1 and XPO1 mutations are mainly detected in patients with unmutated immunoglobulins. The patterns of somatic mutation, supported by functional and clinical analyses, strongly indicate that the recurrent NOTCH1, MYD88 and XPO1 mutations are oncogenic changes that contribute to the clinical evolution of the disease. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive analysis of CLL combining whole-genome sequencing with clinical characteristics and clinical outcomes. It highlights the usefulness of this approach for the identification of clinically relevant mutations in cancer.

Somatic mutation importance in the pathogenesis or disease progression of histiocytic sarcoma was largely unknown. To identify somatic mutations in histiocytic sarcoma, we studied 5 histiocytic sarcomas [3 female and 2 male patients; mean age 54.8 (20-72), anatomic sites include lymph node, uterus, and pleura] and matched normal tissues from each patient as germ line controls. Somatic mutations in 50 \"Hotspot\" oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes were examined using next generation sequencing. Three (out of five) histiocytic sarcoma cases carried somatic mutations in BRAF. Among them, G464V [variant frequency (VF) of 43.6Â %] and G466R (VF of 29.6Â %) located at the P loop potentially interfere with the hydrophobic interaction between P and activating loops and ultimately activation of BRAF. Also detected was BRAF somatic mutation N581S (VF of 7.4Â %), which was located at the catalytic loop of BRAF kinase domain: its role in modifying kinase activity was unclear. A similar mutational analysis was also performed on nine acute monocytic/monoblastic leukemia cases, which did not identify any BRAF somatic mutations. Our study detected several BRAF mutations in histiocytic sarcomas, which may be important in understanding the tumorigenesis of this rare neoplasm and providing mechanisms for potential therapeutical opportunities.\n\nNovel splice mutation in microthalmia-associated transcription factor in Waardenburg Syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nBrenner, Laura; Burke, Kelly; Leduc, Charles A; Guha, Saurav; Guo, Jiancheng; Chung, Wendy K\n\n2011-01-01\n\nWaardenburg Syndrome (WS) is a syndromic form of hearing loss associated with mutations in six different genes. We identified a large family with WS that had previously undergone clinical testing, with no reported pathogenic mutation. Using linkage analysis, a region on 3p14.1 with an LOD score of 6.6 was identified. Microthalmia-Associated Transcription Factor, a gene known to cause WS, is located within this region of linkage. Sequencing of Microthalmia-Associated Transcription Factor demonstrated a c.1212 G>A synonymous variant that segregated with the WS in the family and was predicted to cause a novel splicing site that was confirmed with expression analysis of the mRNA. This case illustrates the need to computationally analyze novel synonymous sequence variants for possible effects on splicing to maximize the clinical sensitivity of sequence-based genetic testing.\n\nMutations in the Kinase Domain of the HER2/ERBB2 Gene Identified in a Wide Variety of Human Cancers.\n\nPubMed\n\nWen, Wenhsiang; Chen, Wangjuh Sting; Xiao, Nick; Bender, Ryan; Ghazalpour, Anatole; Tan, Zheng; Swensen, Jeffrey; Millis, Sherri Z; Basu, Gargi; Gatalica, Zoran; Press, Michael F\n\n2015-09-01\n\nThe HER2 (official name ERBB2) gene encodes a membrane receptor in the epidermal growth factor receptor family amplified and overexpressed in adenocarcinoma. Activating mutations also occur in several cancers. We report mutation analyses of the HER2 kinase domain in 7497 histologically diverse cancers. Forty-five genes, including the kinase domain of HER2 with HER2 IHC and dual in situ hybridization, were analyzed in tumors from 7497 patients with cancer, including 850 breast, 770 colorectal, 910 non-small cell lung, 823 uterine or cervical, 1372 ovarian, and 297 pancreatic cancers, as well as 323 melanomas and 2152 other solid tumors. Sixty-nine HER2 kinase domain mutations were identified in tumors from 68 patients (approximately 1% of all cases, ranging from absent in sarcomas to 4% in urothelial cancers), which included previously published activating mutations and 13 novel mutations. Fourteen cases with coexisting HER2 mutation and amplification and/or overexpression were identified. Fifty-two of 68 patients had additional mutations in other analyzed genes, whereas 16 patients (23%) had HER2 mutations identified as the sole driver mutation. HER2 mutations coexisted with HER2 gene amplification and overexpression and with mutations in other functionally important genes. HER2 mutations were identified as the only driver mutation in a significant proportion of solid cancers. Evaluation of anti-HER2 therapies in nonamplified, HER2-mutated cancers is warranted.

The VMD2 gene encodes a transmembrane protein named bestrophinâ1 (hBest1) which is a Ca2+âsensitive chloride channel. This study was performed to identify diseaseâspecific mutations in 27 patients with BVMD. Because this disease is characterised by an alteration in Clâ channel function, patch clamp analysis was used to test the hypothesis that one of the VMD2 mutated variants causes the disease. Methods Direct sequencing analysis of the 11 VMD2 exons was performed to detect new abnormal sequences. The mutant of hBest1 was expressed in HEKâ293 cells and the associated Clâ current was examined using wholeâcell patch clamp analysis. Results Six new VMD2 mutations were identified, located exclusively in exons four, six and eight. One of these mutations (Q293H) was particularly severe. Patch clamp analysis of human embryonic kidney cells expressing the Q293H mutant showed that this mutant channel is nonâfunctional. Furthermore, the Q293H mutant inhibited the function of wildâtype bestrophinâ1 channels in a dominant negative manner. Conclusions This study provides further support for the idea that mutations in VMD2 are a necessary factor for Best disease. However, because variable expressivity of VMD2 was observed in a family with the Q293H mutation, it is also clear that a diseaseâlinked mutation in VMD2 is not sufficient to produce BVMD. The finding that the Q293H mutant does not form functional channels in the membrane could be explained either by disruption of channel conductance or gating mechanisms or by improper trafficking of the protein to the plasma membrane.

Sun-exposed melanomas had markedly more ultraviolet (UV)-like C>T somatic mutations compared to sun-shielded acral, mucosal and uveal melanomas. Among the newly identified cancer genes was PPP6C, encoding a serine/threonine phosphatase, which harbored mutations that clustered in the active site in 12% of sun-exposed melanomas, exclusively in tumors with mutations in BRAF or NRAS. Notably, we identified a recurrent UV-signature, an activating mutation in RAC1 in 9.2% of sun-exposed melanomas. This activating mutation, the third most frequentmoreÂ Â» in our cohort of sun-exposed melanoma after those of BRAF and NRAS, changes Pro29 to serine (RAC1{sup P29S}) in the highly conserved switch I domain. Crystal structures, and biochemical and functional studies of RAC1{sup P29S} showed that the alteration releases the conformational restraint conferred by the conserved proline, causes an increased binding of the protein to downstream effectors, and promotes melanocyte proliferation and migration. These findings raise the possibility that pharmacological inhibition of downstream effectors of RAC1 signaling could be of therapeutic benefit.Â«Â less\n\nExome capture sequencing identifies a novel mutation in BBS4\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWang, Hui; Chen, Xianfeng; Dudinsky, Lynn; Patenia, Claire; Chen, Yiyun; Li, Yumei; Wei, Yue; Abboud, Emad B.; Al-Rajhi, Ali A.; Lewis, Richard Alan; Lupski, James R.; Mardon, Graeme; Gibbs, Richard A.; Perkins, Brian D.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nPurpose Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is one of the most severe eye dystrophies characterized by severe vision loss at an early stage and accounts for approximately 5% of all retinal dystrophies. The purpose of this study was to identify a novel LCA disease allele or gene and to develop an approach combining genetic mapping with whole exome sequencing. Methods Three patients from King Khaled Eye Specialist Hospital (KKESH205) underwent whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping, and a single candidate region was identified. Taking advantage of next-generation high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies, whole exome capture sequencing was performed on patient KKESH205#7. Sanger direct sequencing was used during the validation step. The zebrafish model was used to examine the function of the mutant allele. Results A novel missense mutation in Bardet-Biedl syndrome 4 protein (BBS4) was identified in a consanguineous family from Saudi Arabia. This missense mutation in the fifth exon (c.253G>C;p.E85Q) of BBS4 is likely a disease-causing mutation as it segregates with the disease. The mutation is not found in the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) database, the 1000 Genomes Project, or matching normal controls. Functional analysis of this mutation in zebrafish indicates that the G253C allele is pathogenic. Coinjection of the G253C allele cannot rescue the mislocalization of rhodopsin in the retina when BBS4 is knocked down by morpholino injection. Immunofluorescence analysis in cell culture shows that this missense mutation in BBS4 does not cause obvious defects in protein expression or pericentriolar localization. Conclusions This mutation likely mainly reduces or abolishes BBS4 function in the retina. Further studies of this allele will provide important insights concerning the pleiotropic nature of BBS4 function.

The aberrantly spliced target genes and deregulated cellular pathways associated with the commonly mutated splicing factor genes in MDS (SF3B1, SRSF2 and U2AF1) are being identified, illuminating the molecular mechanisms underlying MDS. Emerging data from mouse modeling studies indicate that the presence of splicing factor gene mutations can lead to bone marrow hematopoietic stem/myeloid progenitor cell expansion, impaired hematopoiesis and dysplastic differentiation that are hallmarks of MDS. Importantly, recent evidence suggests that spliceosome inhibitors and splicing modulators may have therapeutic value in the treatment of splicing factor mutant myeloid malignancies.

Here, we describe an EGFR interactome of 263 proteins and offer a 14-protein core network critical to the viability of multiple EGFR-mutated lung cancer cells. Cells with acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) had differential dependence of the core network proteins based on the underlying molecular mechanisms of resistance. Of the 14 proteins, 9 are shown to be specifically associated with survival of EGFR-mutated lung cancer cell lines. This included EGFR, GRB2, MK12, SHC1, ARAF, CD11B, ARHG5, GLU2B, and CD11A. With the use of a drug network associated with the core network proteins, we identified two compounds, midostaurin and lestaurtinib, that could overcome drug resistance through direct EGFR inhibition when combined with erlotinib. Our results, enabled by interactome mapping, suggest new targets and combination therapies that could circumvent EGFR TKI resistance.\n\nTERT promoter mutation status as an independent prognostic factor in cutaneous melanoma.\n\nPubMed\n\nGriewank, Klaus G; Murali, Rajmohan; Puig-Butille, Joan Anton; Schilling, Bastian; Livingstone, Elisabeth; Potrony, Miriam; Carrera, Cristina; Schimming, Tobias; MÃ¶ller, Inga; Schwamborn, Marion; Sucker, Antje; Hillen, Uwe; Badenas, Celia; Malvehy, Josep; Zimmer, Lisa; Scherag, AndrÃ©; Puig, Susana; Schadendorf, Dirk\n\n2014-09-01\n\nRecently, TERT promoter mutations were identified at high frequencies in cutaneous melanoma tumor samples and cell lines. The mutations were found to have a UV-signature and to lead to increased TERT gene expression. We analyzed a large cohort of melanoma patients for the presence and distribution of TERT promoter mutations and their association with clinico-pathological characteristics. 410 melanoma tumor samples were analyzed by Sanger sequencing for the presence of TERT promoter mutations. An analysis of associations between mutation status and various clinical and pathologic variables was performed. TERT promoter mutations were identified in 154 (43%) of 362 successfully sequenced melanomas. Mutation frequencies varied between melanoma subtype, being most frequent in melanomas arising in nonacral skin (48%) and melanomas with occult primary (50%), and less frequent in mucosal (23%), and acral (19%) melanomas. Mutations carried a UV signature (C>T or CC>TT). The presence of TERT promoter mutations was associated with factors such as BRAF or NRAS mutation (P < .001), histologic type (P = .002), and Breslow thickness (P < .001). TERT promoter mutation was independently associated with poorer overall survival in patients with nonacral cutaneous melanomas (median survival 80 months vs 291 months for wild-type; hazard ratio corrected for other covariates 2.47; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.29 to 4.74; P = .006). UV-induced TERT promoter mutations are one of the most frequent genetic alterations in melanoma, with frequencies varying depending on melanoma subtype. In nonacral cutaneous melanomas, presence of TERT promoter mutations is independently associated with poor prognosis. Â© The Author 2014. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

Inherited thrombophilias further increase risk for deep venous thrombosis and adverse outcome in pregnancy. Factor V Leiden mutation is the most common inherited thrombophilia, occurring in approximately 5% of the White and 1% of the Black populations.

There have been no exome-wide examinations of genes mutated in seminomas or of overall rates of nonsilent somatic mutations in these tumors. The objective was to analyze somatic mutations in seminomas to determine which genes are affected and to determine rates of nonsilent mutations. Eight seminomas and matched normal samples were surgically obtained from eight patients. DNA was extracted from tissue samples and exome sequenced on massively parallel Illumina DNA sequencers. Single-nucleotide polymorphism chip-based copy number analysis was also performed to assess copy number alterations. The DNA sequencing read data were analyzed to detect somatic mutations including single-nucleotide substitutions and short insertions and deletions. The detected mutations were validated by independent sequencing and further checked for subclonality. The rate of nonsynonymous somatic mutations averaged 0.31 mutations/Mb. We detected nonsilent somatic mutations in 96 genes that were not previously known to be mutated in seminomas, of which some may be driver mutations. Many of the mutations appear to have been present in subclonal populations. In addition, two genes, KIT and KRAS, were affected in two tumors each with mutations that were previously observed in other cancers and are presumably oncogenic. Our study, the first report on exome sequencing of seminomas, detected somatic mutations in 96 new genes, several of which may be targetable drivers. Furthermore, our results show that seminoma mutation rates are five times higher than previously thought, but are nevertheless low compared to other common cancers. Similar low rates are seen in other cancers that also have excellent rates of remission achieved with chemotherapy. We examined the DNA sequences of seminomas, the most common type of testicular germ cell cancer.

In dominantly inherited diseases, mutations occur in only one allele and are often masked by the normal allele. Here we report the development of a sensitive and specific diagnostic strategy based on somatic cell hybridization termed MAMA (monoallelic mutation analysis). We have demonstrated the utility of this strategy in two different hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes, one caused by a defective tumour suppressor gene on chromosome 5 (familial adenomatous polyposis, FAP) and the other caused by a defective mismatch repair gene on chromosome 2 (hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer, HNPCC).\n\nMutational signature analysis identifies MUTYH deficiency in colorectal cancers and adrenocortical carcinomas: Mutational signature associated with MUTYH deficiency in cancers\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nPilati, Camilla; Shinde, Jayendra; Alexandrov, Ludmil B.\n\nGermline alterations in DNA repair genes are implicated in cancer predisposition and can result in characteristic mutational signatures.

This study aimed at identifying disease-causing variants in fifteen consanguineous Tunisian families. Full ophthalmic examination was performed. Index patients were subjected to IROme analysis or whole exome sequencing followed by homozygosity mapping. All detected variations were confirmed by direct Sanger sequencing. Mutation analysis in our patients revealed two compound heterozygous mutations p.(R91W);(V172D) in RPE65, and five novel homozygous mutations: p.R765C in CNGB1, p.H337R in PDE6B, splice site variant c.1129-2Aâ>âG and c.678_681delGAAG in FAM161A and c.1133â+â3_1133â+â6delAAGT in CERKL. The latter mutation impacts pre-mRNA splicing of CERKL. The other changes detected were six previously reported mutations in CNGB3 (p.R203*), ABCA4 (p.W782*), NR2E3 (p.R311Q), RPE65 (p.H182Y), PROM1 (c.1354dupT) and EYS (c.5928-2Aâ>âG). Segregation analysis in each family showed that all affected individuals were homozygotes and unaffected individuals were either heterozygote carriers or homozygous wild type allele. These results confirm the involvement of a large number of genes in RD in the Tunisian population.\n\nMutation screening of the HGD gene identifies a novel alkaptonuria mutation with significant founder effect and high prevalence.\n\nPubMed\n\nSakthivel, Srinivasan; Zatkova, Andrea; Nemethova, Martina; Surovy, Milan; Kadasi, Ludevit; Saravanan, Madurai P\n\n2014-05-01\n\nAlkaptonuria (AKU) is an autosomal recessive disorder; caused by the mutations in the homogentisate 1, 2-dioxygenase (HGD) gene located on Chromosome 3q13.33. AKU is a rare disorder with an incidence of 1: 250,000 to 1: 1,000,000, but Slovakia and the Dominican Republic have a relatively higher incidence of 1: 19,000. Our study focused on studying the frequency of AKU and identification of HGD gene mutations in nomads. HGD gene sequencing was used to identify the mutations in alkaptonurics. For the past four years, from subjects suspected to be clinically affected, we found 16 positive cases among a randomly selected cohort of 41 Indian nomads (Narikuravar) settled in the specific area of Tamil Nadu, India. HGD gene mutation analysis showed that 11 of these patients carry the same homozygous splicing mutation c.87 + 1G > A; in five cases, this mutation was found to be heterozygous, while the second AKU-causing mutation was not identified in these patients. This result indicates that the founder effect and high degree of consanguineous marriages have contributed to AKU among nomads. Eleven positive samples were homozygous for a novel mutation c.87 + 1G > A, that abolishes an intron 2 donor splice site and most likely causes skipping of exon 2. The prevalence of AKU observed earlier seems to be highly increased in people of nomadic origin.

Mucosal melanoma differs from cutaneous melanoma not only in terms of poorer clinical outcome but also on the molecular level having e.g. less BRAF and more frequent KIT mutations than cutaneous melanomas. For the majority of mucosal melanomas oncogenic driver mutations remain unknown. In our study, 75 tumor tissues from patients diagnosed with mucosal melanoma were analyzed, applying a targeted next generation sequencing panel covering 29 known recurrently mutated genes in melanoma. NF1 and RAS mutations were identified as the most frequently mutated genes occurring in 18.3% and 16.9% of samples, respectively. Mutations in BRAF were identified in 8.4% and KIT in 7.0% of tumor samples. Our study identifies NF1 as the most frequently occurring driver mutation in mucosal melanoma. RAS alterations, consisting of NRAS and KRAS mutations, were the second most frequent mutation type. BRAF and KIT mutations were rare with frequencies below 10% each. Our data indicate that in mucosal melanomas RAS/NF1 alterations are frequent, implying a significant pathogenetic role for MAPK and potentially PI3K pathway activation in these tumors.\n\nTargeted next generation sequencing of mucosal melanomas identifies frequent NF1 and RAS mutations\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCosgarea, Ioana; Ugurel, Selma; Sucker, Antje; Livingstone, Elisabeth; Zimmer, Lisa; Ziemer, Mirjana; Utikal, Jochen; Mohr, Peter; Pfeiffer, Christiane; PfÃ¶hler, Claudia; Hillen, Uwe; Horn, Susanne; Schadendorf, Dirk\n\n2017-01-01\n\nPurpose Mucosal melanoma represents ~1% of all melanomas, frequently having a poor prognosis due to diagnosis at a late stage of disease.

Four gain-of-function mutations that form a hyperactive or deregulated C3 convertase have been identified in Factor B (FB) ligand binding sites. Here, we studied the functional consequences of 10 FB genetic changes recently identified from different aHUS cohorts. Using several tests for alternative C3 and C5 convertase formation and regulation, we identified two gain-of-function and potentially disease-relevant mutations that formed either an overactive convertase (M433I) or a convertase resistant to decay by FH (K298Q). One mutation (R178Q) produced a partially cleaved protein with no ligand binding or functional activity. Seven genetic changes led to near-normal or only slightly reduced ligand binding and functional activity compared with the most common polymorphism at position 7, R7. Notably, none of the algorithms used to predict the disease relevance of FB mutations agreed completely with the experimental data, suggesting that in silico approaches should be undertaken with caution. These data, combined with previously published results, suggest that 9 of 15 FB genetic changes identified in patients with aHUS are unrelated to disease pathogenesis. This study highlights that functional assessment of identified nucleotide changes in FB is mandatory to confirm disease association.

In cancer, the splicing process is commonly disrupted, resulting in both functional and non-functional end-products. Cancer-specific splicing events are known to contribute to disease progression; however, the dysregulated splicing patterns found on a genome-wide scale have until recently been less well-studied. In this review, we provide an overview of aberrant RNA splicing and its regulation in cancer. We then focus on the executors of the splicing process. Based on a comprehensive catalog of splicing factor encoding genes and analyses of available gene expression and somatic mutation data, we identify cancer-associated patterns of dysregulation. Splicing factor genes are shown to be significantly differentially expressed between cancer and corresponding normal samples, and to have reduced inter-individual expression variation in cancer. Furthermore, we identify enrichment of predicted cancer-critical genes among the splicing factors. In addition to previously described oncogenic splicing factor genes, we propose 24 novel cancer-critical splicing factors predicted from somatic mutations.\n\nEpidermal growth factor receptor gene mutation as risk factor for recurrence in patients with surgically resected lung adenocarcinoma: a matched-pair analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nMatsumura, Yuki; Owada, Yuki; Yamaura, Takumi; Muto, Satoshi; Osugi, Jun; Hoshino, Mika; Higuchi, Mitsunori; Ohira, Tetsuya; Suzuki, Hiroyuki; Gotoh, Mitsukazu\n\n2016-08-01\n\nEpidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation is a robust prognostic factor in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (ADC). However, the role of EGFR mutation status as a recurrence-risk factor remains unknown because the presence of such mutations is associated with other background characteristics. We therefore conducted a matched-pair analysis to compare recurrence-free survival (RFS) in matched cohorts of patients with lung ADC. We enrolled 379 patients who underwent surgical resection for lung ADC between 2005 and 2012. We determined the EGFR mutation status of each tumour. Matching their age, gender, smoking history and pathological stage (pStage), we compared RFS between matched cohorts with and without EGFR mutation (n = 86 each). The median age was 67 years, there were 39 (45%) men, 39 (45%) ex- or current smokers and pStage I: 71 (83%), II: 5 (6%), III: 8 (9%), IV: 2 (2%) in each group. The 3- and 5-year RFS rates in patients with mutant and wild-type EGFR were 85 and 78%, and 74 and 60%, respectively, with significant differences between the groups (P = 0.040). Multivariate analysis identified vascular invasion and lymphatic permeation, but not EGFR mutation status, as independent risk factors for recurrence. EGFR-gene mutation might be a favourable recurrence-risk factor in patients with surgically resected lung ADC, but further studies in larger cohorts are needed to verify this hypothesis.

In this study, a total of 212 children with de novo AML were enrolled from a Chinese population and 50 (23.5%) of the patients were deemed CBF-AML. KIT mutations were identified in 30% of the CBF-AML cohort. The KIT mutations were clustered in exon 17 and exon 8, and KIT mutations in exons 8 and 17 were correlated with a shorter overall survival (OS) (5-year OS: 30.0âÂ±â14.5% vs. 73.0âÂ±â8.5%, pâ=â.007) and event-free survival (EFS) (5-year EFS: 30.0âÂ±â14.5% vs. 73.0âÂ±â8.5%, pâ=â.003). Multivariate analysis revealed KIT mutations as an independent risk factor in CBF-AML. Our results suggest that KIT mutations are a molecular marker for an inferior prognosis in pediatric CBF-AML.\n\nSevere vascular calcification and tumoral calcinosis in a family with hyperphosphatemia: a fibroblast growth factor 23 mutation identified by exome sequencing\n\nPubMed Central\n\nShah, Anuja; Miller, Clinton J.; Nast, Cynthia C.; Adams, Mark D.; Truitt, Barbara; Tayek, John A.; Tong, Lili; Mehtani, Parag; Monteon, Francisco; Sedor, John R.; Clinkenbeard, Erica L.; White, Kenneth; Mehrotra, Rajnish; LaPage, Janine; Dickson, Patricia; Adler, Sharon G.; Iyengar, Sudha K.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground Tumoral calcinosis is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by ectopic calcification and hyperphosphatemia. Methods We describe a family with tumoral calcinosis requiring amputations. The predominant metabolic anomaly identified in three affected family members was hyperphosphatemia. Biochemical and phenotypic analysis of 13 kindred members, together with exome analysis of 6 members, was performed. Results We identified a novel Q67K mutation in fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), segregating with a null (deletion) allele on the other FGF23 homologue in three affected members. Affected siblings had high circulating plasma C-terminal FGF23 levels, but undetectable intact FGF23 or N-terminal FGF23, leading to loss of FGF23 function. Conclusions This suggests that in human, as in experimental models, severe prolonged hyperphosphatemia may be sufficient to produce bone differentiation proteins in vascular cells, and vascular calcification severe enough to require amputation. Genetic modifiers may contribute to the phenotypic variation within and between families.

Severity of disease-based stratified samples may help identify new disease-associated mutant genes. We analyzed mRNA expression profiles from patient hippocampal tissue. Three of the seven patients had severe mTLE with generalized-onset convulsions and consciousness loss that occurred over many years. We found that compared with other groups, patients with severe mTLE were classified into a distinct group. Whole-exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing validation in all seven patients identified three novel SUN domain-containing ossification factor (SUCO) mutations in severely affected patients. Furthermore, SUCO knock down significantly reduced dendritic length in vitro. Our results indicate that mTLE defects may affect neuronal development, and suggest that neurons have abnormal development due to lack of SUCO, which may be a generalized-onset epilepsy-related gene.

Mutations and/or abnormal expression often lead to constitutive dimerization and kinase activation of FGFRs, and represent the primary mechanism for aberrant signaling. Sequencing of human tumors has revealed a plethora of somatic mutations in FGFRs that are frequently identical to germline mutations in developmental syndromes, and has also identified novel FGFR fusion proteins arising from chromosomal rearrangements that contribute to malignancy. This review details approximately 200 specific point mutations in FGFRs and 40 different fusion proteins created by translocations involving FGFRs that have been identified in human cancer. This review discusses the effects of these genetic alterations on downstream signaling cascades, and the challenge of drug resistance in cancer treatment with antagonists of FGFRs.

Blood samples were collected from four alkaptonuria patients, four carriers, and two healthy volunteers. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood. All 14 exons of the HGD gene were amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. The PCR products were then purified and analyzed by sequencing. Five mutations were identified in our samples. Four of them were novel C1273A, T1046G, 551-552insG, T533G and had not been previously reported, and one mutation T847C has been described before. The types of mutations identified were two missense mutations, one splice site mutation, one frameshift mutation, and one polymorphism. We present the first molecular study of the HGD gene in Jordanian alkaptonuria patients. This study provides valuable information about the molecular basis of alkaptonuria in Jordanian population.\n\nWhole-exome sequencing identifies recurrent AKT1 mutations in sclerosing hemangioma of lung\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJung, Seung-Hyun; Kim, Min Sung; Lee, Sung-Hak; Park, Hyun-Chun; Choi, Hyun Joo; Maeng, Leeso; Min, Ki Ouk; Kim, Jeana; Park, Tae In; Shin, Ok Ran; Kim, Tae-Jung; Xu, Haidong; Lee, Kyo Young; Kim, Tae-Min; Song, Sang Yong; Lee, Charles; Chung, Yeun-Jun; Lee, Sug Hyung\n\n2016-01-01\n\nPulmonary sclerosing hemangioma (PSH) is a benign tumor with two cell populations (epithelial and stromal cells), for which genomic profiles remain unknown. We conducted exome sequencing of 44 PSHs and identified recurrent somatic mutations of AKT1 (43.2%) and Î²-catenin (4.5%). We used a second subset of 24 PSHs to confirm the high frequency of AKT1 mutations (overall 31/68, 45.6%; p.E17K, 33.8%) and recurrent Î²-catenin mutations (overall 3 of 68, 4.4%). Of the PSHs without AKT1 mutations, two exhibited AKT1 copy gain. AKT1 mutations existed in both epithelial and stromal cells. In two separate PSHs from one patient, we observed two different AKT1 mutations, indicating they were not disseminated but independent arising tumors. Because the AKT1 mutations were not found to co-occur with Î²-catenin mutations (or any other known driver alterations) in any of the PSHs studied, we speculate that this may be the single-most common driver alteration to develop PSHs. Our study revealed genomic differences between PSHs and lung adenocarcinomas, including a high rate of AKT1 mutation in PSHs. These genomic features of PSH identified in the present study provide clues to understanding the biology of PSH and for differential genomic diagnosis of lung tumors.

Little is known about the mutational spectra of these tumor types and whether mutations may be of clinical significance with respect to therapeutic selection. In this study, we identified somatic mutations using the Ion Torrent AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2. Specimens consisted of 3 nonneoplastic retention cysts/mucocele, 15 low-grade mucinous neoplasms (LAMNs), 8 low-grade/well-differentiated mucinous adenocarcinomas with pseudomyxoma peritonei, and 12 adenocarcinomas with/without goblet cell/signet ring cell features. Barcoded libraries were prepared from up to 10 ng of extracted DNA and multiplexed on single 318 chips for sequencing. Data analysis was performed using Golden Helix SVS. Variants that remained after the analysis pipeline were individually interrogated using the Integrative Genomics Viewer. A single Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) mutation was detected in the mucocele group. Eight mutations were identified in the V-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) and GNAS complex locus (GNAS) genes among LAMN samples. Additional gene mutations were identified in the AKT1 (v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1), APC (adenomatous polyposis coli), JAK3, MET (met proto-oncogene), phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PIK3CA), RB1 (retinoblastoma 1), STK11 (serine/threonine kinase 11), and tumor protein p53 (TP53) genes. Among the PMPs, 6 mutations were detected in the KRAS gene and also in the GNAS, TP53, and RB1 genes. Appendiceal cancers showed mutations in the APC, ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated), KRAS, IDH1 [isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (NADP+)], NRAS [neuroblastoma RAS viral (v-ras) oncogene homolog], PIK3CA, SMAD4 (SMAD family member 4), and TP53 genes. Our results suggest molecular heterogeneity among epithelial tumors of the appendix.

In this study, we investigated a Chinese family segregating autosomal dominant nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss. We identified a missense mutation c.T275A p.V92D in the LCCL domain of COCH cosegregating with the disease and absent in 100 normal hearing controls. This mutation leads to substitution of the hydrophobic valine to an acidic amino acid aspartic acid. Our data enriched the mutation spectrum of DFNA9 and implied the importance for mutation screening of COCH in age related hearing loss with vestibular dysfunctions.

We studied the molecular basis of FXIII deficiency in patients from 10 unrelated families originating from Israel, India and Tunisia. Exons 2-15 of genomic DNA consisting of coding regions and intron/exon boundaries were amplified and sequenced. Structural analysis of the mutations was undertaken by computer modeling. Seven novel mutations were identified in the FXIIIA gene. The propositus from the Ethiopian-Jewish family was found to be a compound heterozygote for two novel mutations: a 10-bp deletion in exon 12 at nucleotides 1652-1661 (followed by 22 altered amino acids and termination codon) and Ala318Val mutation. The propositus of the Tunisian family was homozygous for C insertion after nucleotide 863 within a stretch of six cytosines of exon 7. This insertion results in generation of eight altered amino acids followed by a termination codon downstream. The propositus from Indian-Jewish origin was found to be homozygous for G to T substitution at IVS 11 [+1] resulting in skipping of exons 10 and 11. In addition to the Ala318Val mutation, three of the novel mutations identified are missense mutations: Arg260Leu, Thr398Asn and Gly210Arg each occurring in a homozygous state in an Israeli-Arab and two Indian families, respectively. Structure-function correlation analysis by computer modeling of the new missense mutations predicted that Gly210Arg will cause protein misfolding, Ala318Val and Thr398Asn will interfere with the catalytic process or protein stability, and Arg260Leu will impair dimerization.\n\nNovel mutation identified in severe early-onset tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome: a case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nRadhakrishna, Suhas M; Grimm, Amy; Broderick, Lori\n\n2017-04-20\n\nTumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Periodic Syndrome (TRAPS) is the second most common heritable autoinflammatory disease, typically presenting in pre-school aged children with fever episodes lasting 1-3Â weeks. Systemic symptoms can include rash, myalgia, ocular inflammation, and serositis. Here we report an unusual presentation of TRAPS in a 7Â month old girl who presented with only persistent fever. She was initially diagnosed with incomplete Kawasaki Disease and received IVIG and infliximab; however, her fevers quickly recurred. Subsequent testing revealed a urinary tract infection, but she did not improve despite appropriate therapy. As fever continued, she developed significant abdominal distension with imaging concerning for appendicitis, followed by hyperthermia and hemodynamic instability. Given her protracted clinical course and maternal history of a poorly defined inflammatory condition, an autoinflammatory disease was considered. Therapy with anakinra was initiated, resulting in rapid resolution of fever and normalization of inflammatory markers. She was found to have a previously unreported mutation, Thr90Pro, in the TNFRSF1A gene associated with TRAPS. This novel mutation was also confirmed in the patient's mother and maternal uncle. This report reviews a severe case of TRAPS in infancy associated with a novel mutation, Thr90Pro, in the TNFRSF1A gene, and emphasizes that autoinflammatory disease should be considered in the differential of infants with fever of unknown origin.\n\nEpidermal growth factor receptor mutations in adenocarcinoma in situ and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma detected using mutation-specific monoclonal antibodies.\n\nPubMed\n\nNakamura, Haruhiko; Koizumi, Hirotaka; Kimura, Hiroyuki; Marushima, Hideki; Saji, Hisashi; Takagi, Masayuki\n\n2016-09-01\n\nEpidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation rates in adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) were studied using both DNA analysis and mutation-specific immunohistochemistry. The peptide nucleic acid-locked nucleic acid polymerase chain reaction clamp method was used to detect mutations in exons 18, 19, 20, and 21 of the EGFR gene in DNA samples extracted from paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Simultaneously, immunohistochemical analysis with two EGFR mutation-specific monoclonal antibodies was used to identify proteins resulting from an in-frame deletion in exon 19 (E746_A750del) and a point mutation replacing leucine with arginine at codon 858 of exon 21 (L858R). Forty-three tumors (22 AIS and 21 MIA) were examined. The EGFR mutation rate in AIS detected by DNA analysis was 27.3% (L858R, 5/22; exon 19 deletion,1/22), whereas that detected in MIA was 42.9% (L858R,4/21; exon 19 deletion,5/21). Mutations detected by immunohistochemical analysis included 22.7% (L858R, 4/22; exon 19 deletion, 1/22) in AIS and 42.9% (L858R, 4/21; exon 19 deletion, 5/21) in MIA. Although some results were contradictory, concordant results were obtained using both assays in 38 of 43 cases (88.4%). DNA and immunohistochemical analyses revealed similar EGFR mutation rates in both MIA and AIS, suggesting that mutation-specific monoclonal antibodies are useful to confirm DNA assay results.
