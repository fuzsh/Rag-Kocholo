In his preachement, Sfeir said that freedom was the most precious value God gave to man. Without freedom, there is no responsibility, no judgment, no punishment, and no dignity. He added that religious freedom was very important. Religious groups must not be prohibited from broadcasting their doctrines, but they should do it in a responsible way, not by force. Authorities must protect the civil rights, and provide the enforcement of laws. These are the rules, he ended, that are implemented in most civilized countries.\n\nAfter the Holy mass, crowds of faithful people gathered in the big square of the Patriarch palace in Bkerki. They expressed their displeasure of the government decision to stop \"Voice of Charity\" and \"Tele Lumiere\" from broadcasting.\n\nA member of the board of directors of \"Tele Lumiere\", Antoine Saad, then spoke on behalf of the crowds saying it was crime against humanity to cease the church from communicating with its audience.\"Voice of charity and Tele Lumiere are means that never threatened the national security but worked for peace, freedom and love\".\n\nWe wouldn't let that happen, he said, and we're strong. Everybody should say no.\n\nSfeir then made of speech about freedom and the means of communication, in which he made it clear that freedom was essential, and that media should tell nothing but the truth.
