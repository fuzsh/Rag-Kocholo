Then, on Thursdays, Lisa is joined by York-Peter Klöppel, Head of Mental Performance at the Red Bull Athlete Performance Centre, for a breakdown of Lisa's conversation, with York providing expert insight and clear takeaways we can apply to our daily lives.\n\nIn previous seasons, the podcast has explored themes like resilience, focus, self-belief and decision-making, with guests including sporting greats like Lindsey Vonn, Max Verstappen and Ben Stokes.\n\nCheck out last season's Mind Set Win episodes\n\nContinuing the top tier guest list for Season 3 will be Formula 1 driver Liam Lawson, World Champion triathlete Kristian Blummenfelt, South Africa’s double World Cup winning rugby captain Siya Kolisi and Australia’s BMX medal contender Saya Sakakibara.\n\nThe season kicks off with a bang with RB Leipzig forward Xavi Simons and Dr Peter Schneider, a mental performance trainer with the Bundesliga club. The pair will talk about their close working relationship, the importance of getting the mental approach right in high-pressure environments like the Champions League, and even their many games of UNO.\n\nThe season will also feature returning guests in Siya Kolisi, fresh from leading South Africa to a second Rugby World Cup victory, and Kristian Blummenfelt, who this time is joined by his coach Olav Alexander Bu, for a conversation about their special relationship.\n\nLisa Ramuschkat, stepping up to the role of Mind Set Win host, will guide listeners through the season via one-on-one interviews with guests from different areas of life, and then in joint conversation with York-Peter Kloeppel.\n\nLisa herself is familiar with the world of sports and high performance, having played field hockey before switching to a career as a journalist and TV presenter. Lisa is particularly excited to introducing a new format that will provide even deeper insight into the mental tactics of her extraordinary guests.\n\n“The true power of a resilient mindset is something that has always been interesting to me,” Lisa explains. “So I couldn't be more excited to go down this path with York and these incredible personalities and grow a little bit more together with the audience.\n\nNew episodes of Mind Set Win will be released every Tuesday and Thursday on redbull.com, YouTube, Apple, Spotify or wherever you prefer to listen to podcasts."
