        "text": "May 20, 2010\n\nNOBLESVILLE, Ind. - Western Washington University's Patrick Boag (Jr., Yakima/Eisenhower) shot a 3-over par 75 on Thursday at the NCAA Division II Men's Golf National Championships being held at The Sagamore Club.\n\nThe fourth and final round takes place Friday.\n\n\"He played a real good round with a disappointing finish,\" said Western coach Steve Card (17th year). \"He gave himself a lot of chances and played very solid. He was feeling a lot better and was a lot more comfortable.\"\n\nBoag moved up seven spots to 93rd with a 54-hole total of 247.\n\n\"He had a good start with birdies on two of the first three holes and was even par at the turn and with three holes to play before finishing double bogey, bogey, par,\" Card said of Boag's play Thursday.\n\nThe medalist leader at 1-under 215 (71) is Abilene Christian's Cyril Bouniol, He is three shots in front of Chico State's Kyle Souza at 218 (74).\n\nChico State shot 5-over 293 for an 899 total, one better than Florida Southern (304=899). Defending national champion Sonoma State is third at 907 (303).\n\nBoag tied for seventh at the Super Central/West Regional two weeks ago and is one of two individuals from non-qualifying teams at that tournament competing at nationals. He placed fourth at the Great Northwest Athletic Championships and entered national play with a 74.7 scoring average.\n\nA total of 20 teams and eight individuals from non-qualifying teams are competing at nationals."
