The process-based model 4C (FORESEE) has been developed over the past 20Â years to study climate impacts on forests and is now freely available\nas an open-source tool. The objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive description of this 4C version (v2.2) for scientific users of the\nmodel and to present an evaluation of 4C at four different forest sites across Europe. The evaluation focuses on forest growth as well as carbon\n(net ecosystem exchange, gross primary production), water (actual evapotranspiration, soil water content), and heat fluxes (soil temperature) using\ndata from the PROFOUND database. We applied different evaluation metrics and compared the daily, monthly, and annual variability of observed and\nsimulated values. The ability to reproduce forest growth (stem diameter and biomass) differs from site to site and is best for a pine stand in\nGermany (Peitz, model efficiency ME=0.98). 4C is able to reproduce soil temperature at different depths in SorÃ¸ and HyytiÃ¤lÃ¤\nwith good accuracy (for all soil depths MEâ>â0.8). The dynamics in simulating carbon and water fluxes are well captured on daily and\nmonthly timescales (0.51â<âMEâ<â0.983) but less so on an annual timescale (MEâ<â0). This modelâdata mismatch is\npossibly due to the accumulation of errors because of processes that are missing or represented in a very general way in 4C but not with enough specific\ndetail to cover strong, site-specific dependencies such as ground vegetation growth. These processes need to be further elaborated to improve the\nprojections of climate change on forests. We conclude that, despite shortcomings, 4C is widely applicable, reliable, and therefore ready to be\nreleased to the scientific community to use and further develop the model.",

Due to their complexity, they require careful parameterization and evaluation to ensure that projections are accurate and reliable. The PROFOUND Database provides a wide range of empirical data to calibrate and evaluate vegetation models that simulate climate impacts at the forest stand scale to support systematic model intercomparisons and model development in Europe.\n\nIntegration of tree hydraulic processes and functional impairment to capture the drought resilience of a semiarid pine forest\n\nDaniel Nadal-Sala, RÃ¼diger Grote, David Kraus, Uri Hochberg, Tamir Klein, Yael Wagner, Fedor Tatarinov, Dan Yakir, and Nadine K. Ruehr\n\nBiogeosciences, 21, 2973–2994, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-2973-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-2973-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA hydraulic model approach is presented that can be added to any physiologically based ecosystem model. Simulated plant water potential triggers stomatal closure, photosynthesis decline, root–soil resistance increases, and sapwood and foliage senescence. The model has been evaluated at an extremely dry site stocked with Aleppo pine and was able to represent gas exchange, soil water content, and plant water potential. The model also responded realistically regarding leaf senescence.\n\nInferring the tree regeneration niche from inventory data using a dynamic forest model\n\nYannek KÃ¤ber, Florian Hartig, and Harald Bugmann\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 2727–2753, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-2727-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-2727-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMany forest models include detailed mechanisms of forest growth and mortality, but regeneration is often simplified. Testing and improving forest regeneration models is challenging. We address this issue by exploring how forest inventories from unmanaged European forests can be used to improve such models. We find that competition for light among trees is captured by the model, unknown model components can be informed by forest inventory data, and climatic effects are challenging to capture.\n\nScenario setup and forcing data for impact model evaluation and impact attribution within the third round of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP3a)\n\nKatja Frieler, Jan Volkholz, Stefan Lange, Jacob Schewe, Matthias Mengel, MarÃ­a del RocÃ­o Rivas LÃ³pez, Christian Otto, Christopher P.

The experiments are designed to test our understanding of observed changes in natural and human systems and to quantify to what degree these changes have already been induced by climate change.\n\nCHELSA-W5E5: daily 1 km meteorological forcing data for climate impact studies\n\nDirk Nikolaus Karger, Stefan Lange, Chantal Hari, Christopher P. O. Reyer, Olaf Conrad, Niklaus E. Zimmermann, and Katja Frieler\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 15, 2445–2464, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-2445-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-2445-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present the first 1 km, daily, global climate dataset for climate impact studies. We show that the high-resolution data have a decreased bias and higher correlation with measurements from meteorological stations than coarser data. The dataset will be of value for a wide range of climate change impact studies both at global and regional level that benefit from using a consistent global dataset.\n\nEstimating global land system impacts of timber plantations using MAgPIE 4.3.5\n\nAbhijeet Mishra, Florian HumpenÃ¶der, Jan Philipp Dietrich, Benjamin Leon Bodirsky, Brent Sohngen, Christopher P. O. Reyer, Hermann Lotze-Campen, and Alexander Popp\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 14, 6467–6494, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-6467-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-6467-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTimber plantations are an increasingly important source of roundwood production, next to harvest from natural forests. However, timber plantations are currently underrepresented in global land-use models. Here, we include timber production and plantations in the MAgPIE modeling framework. This allows one to capture the competition for land between agriculture and forestry. We show that increasing timber plantations in the coming decades partly compete with cropland for limited land resources.\n\nModeling gas exchange and biomass production in West African Sahelian and Sudanian ecological zones\n\nJaber Rahimi, Expedit Evariste Ago, Augustine Ayantunde, Sina Berger, Jan Bogaert, Klaus Butterbach-Bahl, Bernard Cappelaere, Jean-Martial Cohard, JÃ©rÃ´me Demarty, Abdoul Aziz Diouf, Ulrike Falk, Edwin Haas, Pierre Hiernaux, David Kraus, Olivier Roupsard, Clemens Scheer, Amit Kumar Srivastava, Torbern Tagesson, and RÃ¼diger Grote\n\nGeosci.

Therefore, we simulated net ecosystem exchange and aboveground biomass of typical ecosystems in this region with an improved process-based biogeochemical model, LandscapeDNDC. Carbon stocks and exchange rates were particularly correlated with the abundance of trees. Grass and crop yields increased under humid climatic conditions.\n\nThe PROFOUND Database for evaluating vegetation models and simulating climate impacts on European forests\n\nChristopher P. O.

Zeeman, and Masakazu Ota\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 1071–1085, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-1071-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-1071-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this paper, we demonstrate that high physiological activity levels during the extremely warm winter are allocated into the below-ground biomass and only to a minor extent used for additional plant growth during early spring. This process is so far largely unaccounted for in scenario analysis using global terrestrial biosphere models, and it may lead to carbon accumulation in the soil and/or carbon loss from the soil as a response to global warming.\n\nAssessing the impacts of 1.5â¯Â°C global warming â simulation protocol of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP2b)\n\nKatja Frieler, Stefan Lange, Franziska Piontek, Christopher P.

ISIMIP brings together over 80 climate-impact models, covering impacts on hydrology, biomes, forests, heat-related mortality, permafrost, tropical cyclones, fisheries, agiculture, energy, and coastal infrastructure.\n\nBAERLIN2014 â the influence of land surface types on and the horizontal heterogeneity of air pollutant levels in Berlin\n\nBoris Bonn, Erika von Schneidemesser, Dorota Andrich, JÃ¶rn Quedenau, Holger Gerwig, Anja LÃ¼decke, JÃ¼rgen Kura, Axel Pietsch, Christian Ehlers, Dieter Klemp, Claudia Kofahl, Rainer Nothard, Andreas Kerschbaumer, Wolfgang Junkermann, RÃ¼diger Grote, Tobias Pohl, Konradin Weber, Birgit Lode, Philipp SchÃ¶nberger, Galina Churkina, Tim M. Butler, and Mark G. Lawrence\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 16, 7785–7811, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-7785-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-7785-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe distribution of air pollutants (gases and particles) have been investigated in different environments in Potsdam, Germany. Remarkable variations of the pollutants have been observed for distances of tens of meters by bicycles, vans and aircraft. Vegetated areas caused reductions depending on the pollutants, the vegetation type and dimensions. Our measurements show the pollutants to be of predominantly local origin, resulting in a huge challenge for common models to resolve.\n\nUrban stress-induced biogenic VOC emissions and SOA-forming potentials in Beijing\n\nAndrea Ghirardo, Junfei Xie, Xunhua Zheng, Yuesi Wang, RÃ¼diger Grote, Katja Block, JÃ¼rgen Wildt, Thomas Mentel, Astrid Kiendler-Scharr, Mattias Hallquist, Klaus Butterbach-Bahl, and JÃ¶rg-Peter Schnitzler\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 16, 2901–2920, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-2901-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-2901-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTrees can impact urban air quality. Large emissions of plant volatiles are emitted in Beijing as a stress response to the urban polluted environment, but their impacts on secondary particulate matter remain relatively low compared to those originated from anthropogenic activities. The present study highlights the importance of including stress-induced compounds when studying plant volatile emissions.\n\nUnambiguous evidence of old soil carbon in grass biosilica particles\n\nPaul E. Reyerson, Anne Alexandre, Araks Harutyunyan, Remi Corbineau, Hector A. Martinez De La Torre, Franz Badeck, Luigi Cattivelli, and Guaciara M. Santos\n\nBiogeosciences, 13, 1269–1286, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-1269-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-1269-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe characterize the origin of carbon (C) in phytoliths (biosilica of higher plants) by a multi-isotope approach. We show that phytoliths occlude soil organic C adsorbed through the roots, making them unsuitable for paleo-proxy studies, 14C dating or atmospheric CO2 sequestration. Our findings are in parallel with recent soil paradigm shifts showing that soil microbes access old C and therefore call for further investigations on the role of old C in rootâplant interactions and biomineralization.\n\nEnvironmental change impacts on the C- and N-cycle of European forests: a model comparison study\n\nD.

Shuman, Rosie A. Fisher, Charles Koven, Ryan Knox, Lara Kueppers, and Chonggang Xu\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 4643–4671, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4643-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4643-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe adapt a fire behavior and effects module for use in a size-structured vegetation demographic model to test how climate, fire regime, and fire-tolerance plant traits interact to determine the distribution of tropical forests and grasslands. Our model captures the connection between fire disturbance and plant fire-tolerance strategies in determining plant distribution and provides a useful tool for understanding the vulnerability of these areas under changing conditions across the tropics.\n\nIn silico calculation of soil pH by SCEPTER v1.0\n\nYoshiki Kanzaki, Isabella Chiaravalloti, Shuang Zhang, Noah J. Planavsky, and Christopher T. Reinhard\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 4515–4532, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4515-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4515-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSoil pH is one of the most commonly measured agronomical and biogeochemical indices, mostly reflecting exchangeable acidity. Explicit simulation of both porewater and bulk soil pH is thus crucial to the accurate evaluation of alkalinity required to counteract soil acidification and the resulting capture of anthropogenic carbon dioxide through the enhanced weathering technique. This has been enabled by the updated reactive–transport SCEPTER code and newly developed framework to simulate soil pH.\n\nSimple process-led algorithms for simulating habitats (SPLASH v.2.0): robust calculations of water and energy fluxes\n\nDavid Sandoval, Iain Colin Prentice, and Rodolfo L. B. NÃ³brega\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 4229–4309, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4229-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4229-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNumerous estimates of water and energy balances depend on empirical equations requiring site-specific calibration, posing risks of \"the right answers for the wrong reasons\". We introduce novel first-principles formulations to calculate key quantities without requiring local calibration, matching predictions from complex land surface models.\n\nA global behavioural model of human fire use and management: WHAM! v1.0\n\nOliver Perkins, Matthew Kasoar, Apostolos Voulgarakis, Cathy Smith, Jay Mistry, and James D. A. Millington\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 3993–4016, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3993-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3993-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWildfire is often presented in the media as a danger to human life. Yet globally, millions of people’s livelihoods depend on using fire as a tool. So, patterns of fire emerge from interactions between humans, land use, and climate. This complexity means scientists cannot yet reliably say how fire will be impacted by climate change. So, we developed a new model that represents globally how people use and manage fire. The model reveals the extent and diversity of how humans live with and use fire.\n\nTerrestrial Ecosystem Model in R (TEMIR) version 1.0: simulating ecophysiological responses of vegetation to atmospheric chemical and meteorological changes\n\nAmos P. K. Tai, David H. Y. Yung, and Timothy Lam\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 3733–3764, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3733-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3733-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe have developed the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model in R (TEMIR), which simulates plant carbon and pollutant uptake and predicts their response to varying atmospheric conditions. This model is designed to couple with an atmospheric chemistry model so that questions related to plant–atmosphere interactions, such as the effects of climate change, rising CO2, and ozone pollution on forest carbon uptake, can be addressed. The model has been well validated with both ground and satellite observations.\n\nbiospheremetrics v1.0.2: an R package to calculate two complementary terrestrial biosphere integrity indicators â humanÂ colonization of the biosphere (BioCol) and risk of ecosystem destabilization (EcoRisk)\n\nFabian Stenzel, Johanna Braun, Jannes Breier, Karlheinz Erb, Dieter Gerten, Jens Heinke, Sarah Matej, Sebastian Ostberg, Sibyll Schaphoff, and Wolfgang Lucht\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 3235–3258, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3235-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3235-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe provide an R package to compute two biosphere integrity metrics that can be applied to simulations of vegetation growth from the dynamic global vegetation model LPJmL. The pressure metric BioCol indicates that we humans modify and extract > 20 % of the potential preindustrial natural biomass production. The ecosystems state metric EcoRisk shows a high risk of ecosystem destabilization in many regions as a result of climate change and land, water, and fertilizer use.\n\nModeling boreal forest soil dynamics with the microbially explicit soil model MIMICS+ (v1.0)\n\nElin Ristorp Aas, Heleen A. de Wit, and Terje K. Berntsen\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 2929–2959, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-2929-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-2929-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBy including microbial processes in soil models, we learn how the soil system interacts with its environment and responds to climate change. We present a soil process model, MIMICS+, which is able to reproduce carbon stocks found in boreal forest soils better than a conventional land model. With the model we also find that when adding nitrogen, the relationship between soil microbes changes notably. Coupling the model to a vegetation model will allow for further study of these mechanisms.\n\nOptimal enzyme allocation leads to the constrained enzyme hypothesis: the Soil Enzyme Steady Allocation Model (SESAM; v3.1)\n\nThomas Wutzler, Christian Reimers, Bernhard Ahrens, and Marion Schrumpf\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 2705–2725, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-2705-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-2705-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSoil microbes provide a strong link for elemental fluxes in the earth system. The SESAM model applies an optimality assumption to model those linkages and their adaptation. We found that a previous heuristic description was a special case of a newly developed more rigorous description. The finding of new behaviour at low microbial biomass led us to formulate the constrained enzyme hypothesis. We now can better describe how microbially mediated linkages of elemental fluxes adapt across decades.\n\nImplementing a dynamic representation of fire and harvest including subgrid-scale heterogeneity in the tile-based land surface model CLASSIC v1.45\n\nSalvatore R. Curasi, Joe R. Melton, Elyn R. Humphreys, Txomin Hermosilla, and Michael A. Wulder\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 2683–2704, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-2683-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-2683-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCanadian forests are responding to fire, harvest, and climate change. Models need to quantify these processes and their carbon and energy cycling impacts. We develop a scheme that, based on satellite records, represents fire, harvest, and the sparsely vegetated areas that these processes generate. We evaluate model performance and demonstrate the impacts of disturbance on carbon and energy cycling. This work has implications for land surface modeling and assessing Canada’s terrestrial C cycle.\n\nInferring the tree regeneration niche from inventory data using a dynamic forest model\n\nYannek KÃ¤ber, Florian Hartig, and Harald Bugmann\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 2727–2753, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-2727-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-2727-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMany forest models include detailed mechanisms of forest growth and mortality, but regeneration is often simplified. Testing and improving forest regeneration models is challenging. We address this issue by exploring how forest inventories from unmanaged European forests can be used to improve such models. We find that competition for light among trees is captured by the model, unknown model components can be informed by forest inventory data, and climatic effects are challenging to capture.\n\nOptimising CH4 simulations from the LPJ-GUESS model v4.1 using an adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm\n\nJalisha T.

Model Dev., 17, 2299–2324, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-2299-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-2299-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBy unlocking the mysteries of CH4 emissions from wetlands, our work improved the accuracy of the LPJ-GUESS vegetation model using Bayesian statistics. Via assimilation of long-term real data from a wetland, we significantly enhanced CH4 emission predictions. This advancement helps us better understand wetland contributions to atmospheric CH4, which are crucial for addressing climate change. Our method offers a promising tool for refining global climate models and guiding conservation efforts\n\nThe XSO framework (v0.1) and Phydra library (v0.1) for a flexible, reproducible, and integrated plankton community modeling environment in Python\n\nBenjamin Post, Esteban Acevedo-Trejos, Andrew D. Barton, and Agostino Merico\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 1175–1195, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-1175-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-1175-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCreating computational models of how phytoplankton grows in the ocean is a technical challenge. We developed a new tool set (Xarray-simlab-ODE) for building such models using the programming language Python. We demonstrate the tool set in a library of plankton models (Phydra). Our goal was to allow scientists to develop models quickly, while also allowing the model structures to be changed easily. This allows us to test many different structures of our models to find the most appropriate one.\n\nExploring the Potential of History Matching for Land Surface Model Calibration\n\nNina Raoult, Simon Beylat, James M. Salter, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Hourdin, Vladislav Bastrikov, Catherine OttlÃ©, and Philippe Peylin\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2996,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2996, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use computer models to predict how the land surface will respond to climate change. However, these complex models do not always simulate what we observe in real life, limiting their effectiveness. To improve their accuracy, we use sophisticated statistical and computational techniques. Here we test a technique called “History matching” against more common approaches. This method adapts well to these models, helping better understand how they work and therefore how to make them more realistic.\n\nAgriCarbon-EO v1.0.1: large-scale and high-resolution simulation of carbon fluxes by assimilation of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 reflectances using a Bayesian approach\n\nTaeken Wijmer, Ahmad Al Bitar, Ludovic Arnaud, Remy Fieuzal, and Eric Ceschia\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 997–1021, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-997-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-997-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nQuantification of carbon fluxes of crops is an essential building block for the construction of a monitoring, reporting, and verification approach. We developed an end-to-end platform (AgriCarbon-EO) that assimilates, through a Bayesian approach, high-resolution (10 m) optical remote sensing data into radiative transfer and crop modelling at regional scale (100 x 100 km). Large-scale estimates of carbon flux are validated against in situ flux towers and yield maps and analysed at regional scale.\n\nSAMM version 1.0: a numerical model for microbial- mediated soil aggregate formation\n\nMoritz Laub, Sergey Blagodatsky, Marijn Van de Broek, Samuel Schlichenmaier, Benjapon Kunlanit, Johan Six, Patma Vityakon, and Georg Cadisch\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 931–956, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-931-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-931-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo manage soil organic matter (SOM) sustainably, we need a better understanding of the role that soil microbes play in aggregate protection. Here, we propose the SAMM model, which connects soil aggregate formation to microbial growth. We tested it against data from a tropical long-term experiment and show that SAMM effectively represents the microbial growth, SOM, and aggregate dynamics and that it can be used to explore the importance of aggregate formation in SOM stabilization.\n\nUsing Deep Learning to integrate paleoclimate and global biogeochemistry over Phanerozoic time\n\nDongyu Zheng, Andrew Merdith, Yves GoddÃ©ris, Yannick Donnadieu, Khushboo Gurung, and Benjamin J. W. Mills\n\nGeosci. Model Dev. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2023-230,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2023-230, 2024\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for GMD\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study uses a deep learning method to enhance the time resolution of paleoclimate simulations to 1 million years. This improved resolution allows a climate-biogeochemical model for more accurate predictions of climate shifts. The method may be critical in developing new fully-continuous methods that are able to translate over a moving continental surface in deep time with high-resolution at a reasonable computational expense.\n\nA model of the within-population variability of budburst in forest trees\n\nJianhong Lin, Daniel Berveiller, Christophe FranÃ§ois, Heikki HÃ¤nninen, Alexandre Morfin, GaÃ«lle Vincent, Rui Zhang, Cyrille Rathgeber, and Nicolas Delpierre\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 865–879, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-865-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-865-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCurrently, the high variability of budburst between individual trees is overlooked. The consequences of this neglect when projecting the dynamics and functioning of tree communities are unknown. Here we develop the first process-oriented model to describe the difference in budburst dates between individual trees in plant populations. Beyond budburst, the model framework provides a basis for studying the dynamics of phenological traits under climate change, from the individual to the community.\n\nComputationally efficient parameter estimation for high-dimensional ocean biogeochemical models\n\nSkyler Kern, Mary E. McGuinn, Katherine M. Smith, Nadia Pinardi, Kyle E. Niemeyer, Nicole S. Lovenduski, and Peter E. Hamlington\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 621–649, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-621-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-621-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nComputational models are used to simulate the behavior of marine ecosystems. The models often have unknown parameters that need to be calibrated to accurately represent observational data. Here, we propose a novel approach to simultaneously determine a large set of parameters for a one-dimensional model of a marine ecosystem in the surface ocean at two contrasting sites. By utilizing global and local optimization techniques, we estimate many parameters in a computationally efficient manner.\n\nRadiocarbon analysis reveals underestimation of soil organic carbon persistence in new-generation soil models\n\nAlexander S. Brunmayr, Frank Hagedorn, Margaux Moreno Duborgel, Luisa I. Minich, and Heather D. Graven\n\nGeosci. Model Dev. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2023-242,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2023-242, 2024\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for GMD\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA new generation of soil models promises to more accurately predict the carbon cycle in soils under climate change. However, measurements of 14C (the radioactive carbon isotope) in soils reveal that the new soil models face similar problems as the traditional models: they underestimate the residence time of carbon in soils and may therefore overestimate the net uptake of CO2 by the land ecosystem. Proposed solutions include restructuring the models and calibrating model parameters with 14C data.\n\nThe community-centered freshwater biogeochemistry model unified RIVE v1.0: a unified version for water column\n\nShuaitao Wang, Vincent Thieu, Gilles Billen, Josette Garnier, Marie Silvestre, Audrey Marescaux, Xingcheng Yan, and Nicolas Flipo\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 449–476, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-449-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-449-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper presents unified RIVE v1.0, a unified version of the freshwater biogeochemistry model RIVE. It harmonizes different RIVE implementations, providing the referenced formalisms for microorganism activities to describe full biogeochemical cycles in the water column (e.g., carbon, nutrients, oxygen). Implemented as open-source projects in Python 3 (pyRIVE 1.0) and ANSI C (C-RIVE 0.32), unified RIVE v1.0 promotes and enhances collaboration among research teams and public services.\n\nEAT v0.9.6: a 1D testbed for physical-biogeochemical data assimilation in natural waters\n\nJorn Bruggeman, Karsten Bolding, Lars Nerger, Anna Teruzzi, Simone Spada, Jozef SkÃ¡kala, and Stefano Ciavatta\n\nGeosci. Model Dev. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2023-238,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2023-238, 2023\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for GMD\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo understand and predict the ocean’s capacity for carbon sequestration, its ability to supply food, and its response to climate change, we need the best possible estimate of its physical and biogeochemical properties. This is obtained through “data assimilation”, which blends numerical models and observations. Here, we present EAT, a flexible and efficient testbed that allows any scientist to explore and further develop the state-of-the-art in data assimilation.\n\nObservation-based sowing dates and cultivars significantly affect yield and irrigation for some crops in the Community Land Model (CLM5)\n\nSam S. Rabin, William J. Sacks, Danica L. Lombardozzi, Lili Xia, and Alan Robock\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 7253–7273, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-7253-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-7253-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClimate models can help us simulate how the agricultural system will be affected by and respond to environmental change, but to be trustworthy they must realistically reproduce historical patterns. When farmers plant their crops and what varieties they choose will be important aspects of future adaptation. Here, we improve the crop component of a global model to better simulate observed growing seasons and examine the impacts on simulated crop yields and irrigation demand.\n\nThe statistical emulators of GGCMI phase 2: responses of year-to-year variation of crop yield to CO2, temperature, water, and nitrogen perturbations\n\nWeihang Liu, Tao Ye, Christoph MÃ¼ller, Jonas JÃ¤germeyr, James A. Franke, Haynes Stephens, and Shuo Chen\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 7203–7221, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-7203-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-7203-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe develop a machine-learning-based crop model emulator with the inputs and outputs of multiple global gridded crop model ensemble simulations to capture the year-to-year variation of crop yield under future climate change. The emulator can reproduce the year-to-year variation of simulated yield given by the crop models under CO2, temperature, water, and nitrogen perturbations. Developing this emulator can provide a tool to project future climate change impact in a simple way.\n\nA novel Eulerian model based on central moments to simulate age and reactivity continua interacting with mixing processes\n\nJurjen Rooze, Heewon Jung, and Hagen Radtke\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 7107–7121, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-7107-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-7107-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nChemical particles in nature have properties such as age or reactivity. Distributions can describe the properties of chemical concentrations. In nature, they are affected by mixing processes, such as chemical diffusion, burrowing animals, and bottom trawling. We derive equations for simulating the effect of mixing on central moments that describe the distributions. We then demonstrate applications in which these equations are used to model continua in disturbed natural environments.\n\nAdaScape 1.0: a coupled modelling tool to investigate the links between tectonics, climate, and biodiversity\n\nEsteban Acevedo-Trejos, Jean Braun, Katherine Kravitz, N. Alexia Raharinirina, and BenoÃ®t Bovy\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 6921–6941, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-6921-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-6921-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe interplay of tectonics and climate influences the evolution of life and the patterns of biodiversity we observe on earth's surface. Here we present an adaptive speciation component coupled with a landscape evolution model that captures the essential earth-surface, ecological, and evolutionary processes that lead to the diversification of taxa. We can illustrate with our tool how life and landforms co-evolve to produce distinct biodiversity patterns on geological timescales.\n\nAn along-track Biogeochemical Argo modelling framework: a case study of model improvements for the Nordic seas\n\nVeli ÃaÄlar Yumruktepe, Erik Askov Mousing, Jerry Tjiputra, and Annette Samuelsen\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 6875–6897, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-6875-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-6875-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present an along BGC-Argo track 1D modelling framework. The model physics is constrained by the BGC-Argo temperature and salinity profiles to reduce the uncertainties related to mixed layer dynamics, allowing the evaluation of the biogeochemical formulation and parameterization. We objectively analyse the model with BGC-Argo and satellite data and improve the model biogeochemical dynamics. We present the framework, example cases and routines for model improvement and implementations.\n\nPeatland-VU-NUCOM (PVN 1.0): using dynamic plant functional types to model peatland vegetation, CH4, and CO2 emissions\n\nTanya J. R. Lippmann, Ype van der Velde, Monique M. P. D. Heijmans, Han Dolman, Dimmie M. D. Hendriks, and Ko van Huissteden\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 6773–6804, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-6773-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-6773-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nVegetation is a critical component of carbon storage in peatlands but an often-overlooked concept in many peatland models. We developed a new model capable of simulating the response of vegetation to changing environments and management regimes. We evaluated the model against observed chamber data collected at two peatland sites. We found that daily air temperature, water level, harvest frequency and height, and vegetation composition drive methane and carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nQuantification of hydraulic trait control on plant hydrodynamics and risk of hydraulic failure within a demographic structured vegetation model in a tropical forest (FATESâHYDRO V1.0)\n\nChonggang Xu, Bradley Christoffersen, Zachary Robbins, Ryan Knox, Rosie A. Fisher, Rutuja Chitra-Tarak, Martijn Slot, Kurt Solander, Lara Kueppers, Charles Koven, and Nate McDowell\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 6267–6283, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-6267-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-6267-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe introduce a plant hydrodynamic model for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)-sponsored model, the Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator (FATES). To better understand this new model system and its functionality in tropical forest ecosystems, we conducted a global parameter sensitivity analysis at Barro Colorado Island, Panama. We identified the key parameters that affect the simulated plant hydrodynamics to guide both modeling and field campaign studies.\n\nSedTrace 1.0: a Julia-based framework for generating and running reactive-transport models of marine sediment diagenesis specializing in trace elements and isotopes\n\nJianghui Du\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 5865–5894, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-5865-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-5865-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTrace elements and isotopes (TEIs) are important tools to study the changes in the ocean environment both today and in the past. However, the behaviors of TEIs in marine sediments are poorly known, limiting our ability to use them in oceanography. Here we present a modeling framework that can be used to generate and run models of the sedimentary cycling of TEIs assisted with advanced numerical tools in the Julia language, lowering the coding barrier for the general user to study marine TEIs.\n\nA high-resolution marine mercury model MITgcm-ECCO2-Hg with online biogeochemistry\n\nSiyu Zhu, Peipei Wu, Siyi Zhang, Oliver Jahn, Shu Li, and Yanxu Zhang\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 5915–5929, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-5915-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-5915-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we estimate the global biogeochemical cycling of Hg in a state-of-the-art physical-ecosystem ocean model (high-resolution-MITgcm/Hg), providing a more accurate portrayal of surface Hg concentrations in estuarine and coastal areas, strong western boundary flow and upwelling areas, and concentration diffusion as vortex shapes. The high-resolution model can help us better predict the transport and fate of Hg in the ocean and its impact on the global Hg cycle.\n\nImproving nitrogen cycling in a land surface model (CLM5) to quantify soil N2O, NO, and NH3 emissions from enhanced rock weathering with croplands\n\nMaria Val Martin, Elena Blanc-Betes, Ka Ming Fung, Euripides P. Kantzas, Ilsa B. Kantola, Isabella Chiaravalloti, Lyla L. Taylor, Louisa K. Emmons, William R. Wieder, Noah J. Planavsky, Michael D. Masters, Evan H. DeLucia, Amos P. K. Tai, and David J. Beerling\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 5783–5801, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-5783-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-5783-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEnhanced rock weathering (ERW) is a CO2 removal strategy that involves applying crushed rocks (e.g., basalt) to agricultural soils. However, unintended processes within the N cycle due to soil pH changes may affect the climate benefits of C sequestration. ERW could drive changes in soil emissions of non-CO2 GHGs (N2O) and trace gases (NO and NH3) that may affect air quality. We present a new improved N cycling scheme for the land model (CLM5) to evaluate ERW effects on soil gas N emissions.\n\nAssimilation of Carbonyl Sulfide (COS) fluxes within the adjoint-based data assimilation system–Nanjing University Carbon Assimilation System (NUCAS v1.0)\n\nHuajie Zhu, Mousong Wu, Fei Jiang, Michael Vossbeck, Thomas Kaminski, Xiuli Xing, Jun Wang, Weimin Ju, and Jing M. Chen\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1955,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1955, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this work, Nanjing University Carbon Assimilation System (NUCAS) was developed. Data assimilation experiments were conducted to demonstrate the robustness and to investigate the feasibility and applicability of NUCAS. The assimilation of COS significantly improved the model performance in gross primary productivity, sensible heat, latent heat and even soil moisture, demonstrating that COS can provide strong constraints on parameters relevant to water, energy and carbon processes.\n\nOcean biogeochemistry in the coupled oceanâsea iceâbiogeochemistry model FESOM2.1âREcoM3\n\nÃzgÃ¼r GÃ¼rses, Laurent Oziel, Onur KarakuÅ, Dmitry Sidorenko, Christoph VÃ¶lker, Ying Ye, Moritz Zeising, Martin Butzin, and Judith Hauck\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 4883–4936, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-4883-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-4883-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper assesses the biogeochemical model REcoM3 coupled to the ocean–sea ice model FESOM2.1. The model can be used to simulate the carbon uptake or release of the ocean on timescales of several hundred years. A detailed analysis of the nutrients, ocean productivity, and ecosystem is followed by the carbon cycle. The main conclusion is that the model performs well when simulating the observed mean biogeochemical state and variability and is comparable to other ocean–biogeochemical models.\n\nForcing the Global Fire Emissions Database burned-area dataset into the Community Land Model version 5.0: impacts on carbon and water fluxes at high latitudes\n\nHocheol Seo and Yeonjoo Kim\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 4699–4713, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-4699-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-4699-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWildfire is a crucial factor in carbon and water fluxes on the Earth system. About 2.1 Pg of carbon is released into the atmosphere by wildfires annually. Because the fire processes are still limitedly represented in land surface models, we forced the daily GFED4 burned area into the land surface model over Alaska and Siberia. The results with the GFED4 burned area significantly improved the simulated carbon emissions and net ecosystem exchange compared to the default simulation.\n\nModeling boreal forest’s mineral soil and peat C stock dynamics with Yasso07 model coupled with updated moisture modifier\n\nBoris Å¤upek, Aleksi Lehtonen, Alla Yurova, Rose Abramoff, Stefano Manzoni, Bertrand Guenet, Elisa Bruni, Samuli Launiainen, Mikko Peltoniemi, Shoji Hashimoto, Xianglin Tian, Juha Heikkinen, Kari Minkkinen, and Raisa MÃ¤kipÃ¤Ã¤\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1523,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1523, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nImproving representation of peatlands in Earth system models (ESMs) (e.g., in Yasso soil C model coupled with JSBACH model) is rare. We updated Yasso07 moisture dependency for applications on both the mineral soils and peatlands of boreal forest. Our moisture function improved the simulated peatland C stocks and CO2 dynamics. However, due to nature of the measurements used for Bayesian MCMC data assimilation, it contrasts with functions in other ESMs (see graphical abstract).\n\nModeling of non-structural carbohydrate dynamics by the spatially explicit individual-based dynamic global vegetation model SEIB-DGVM (SEIB-DGVM-NSC version 1.0)\n\nHideki Ninomiya, Tomomichi Kato, Lea VÃ©gh, and Lan Wu\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 4155–4170, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-4155-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-4155-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNon-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) play a crucial role in plants to counteract the effects of climate change. We added a new NSC module into the SEIB-DGVM, an individual-based ecosystem model. The simulated NSC levels and their seasonal patterns show a strong agreement with observed NSC data at both point and global scales. The model can be used to simulate the biotic effects resulting from insufficient NSCs, which are otherwise difficult to measure in terrestrial ecosystems globally.\n\nMEDFATE 2.9.3: a trait-enabled model to simulate Mediterranean forest function and dynamics at regional scales\n\nMiquel De CÃ¡ceres, Roberto Molowny-Horas, Antoine Cabon, Jordi MartÃ­nez-Vilalta, Maurizio Mencuccini, RaÃºl GarcÃ­a-ValdÃ©s, Daniel Nadal-Sala, Santiago SabatÃ©, Nicolas Martin-StPaul, Xavier Morin, Francesco D'Adamo, Enric Batllori, and Aitor AmÃ©ztegui\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 3165–3201, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-3165-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-3165-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRegional-level applications of dynamic vegetation models are challenging because they need to accommodate the variation in plant functional diversity. This can be done by estimating parameters from available plant trait databases while adopting alternative solutions for missing data. Here we present the design, parameterization and evaluation of MEDFATE (version 2.9.3), a novel model of forest dynamics for its application over a region in the western Mediterranean Basin.\n\nModelling the role of livestock grazing in C and N cycling in grasslands with LPJmL5.0-grazing\n\nJens Heinke, Susanne Rolinski, and Christoph MÃ¼ller\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 2455–2475, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-2455-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-2455-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe develop a livestock module for the global vegetation model LPJmL5.0 to simulate the impact of grazing dairy cattle on carbon and nitrogen cycles in grasslands. A novelty of the approach is that it accounts for the effect of feed quality on feed uptake and feed utilization by animals. The portioning of dietary nitrogen into milk, feces, and urine shows very good agreement with estimates obtained from animal trials.\n\nImplementation of trait-based ozone plant sensitivity in the Yale Interactive terrestrial Biosphere model v1.0 to assess global vegetation damage\n\nYimian Ma, Xu Yue, Stephen Sitch, Nadine Unger, Johan Uddling, Lina M. Mercado, Cheng Gong, Zhaozhong Feng, Huiyi Yang, Hao Zhou, Chenguang Tian, Yang Cao, Yadong Lei, Alexander W. Cheesman, Yansen Xu, and Maria Carolina Duran Rojas\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 2261–2276, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-2261-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-2261-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPlants have been found to respond differently to O3, but the variations in the sensitivities have rarely been explained nor fully implemented in large-scale assessment. This study proposes a new O3 damage scheme with leaf mass per area to unify varied sensitivities for all plant species. Our assessment reveals an O3-induced reduction of 4.8 % in global GPP, with the highest reduction of >10 % for cropland, suggesting an emerging risk of crop yield loss under the threat of O3 pollution.\n\nThe Permafrost and Organic LayEr module for Forest Models (POLE-FM) 1.0\n\nWinslow D. Hansen, Adrianna Foster, Benjamin Gaglioti, Rupert Seidl, and Werner Rammer\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 2011–2036, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-2011-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-2011-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPermafrost and the thick soil-surface organic layers that insulate permafrost are important controls of boreal forest dynamics and carbon cycling. However, both are rarely included in process-based vegetation models used to simulate future ecosystem trajectories. To address this challenge, we developed a computationally efficient permafrost and soil organic layer module that operates at fine spatial (1 ha) and temporal (daily) resolutions.\n\nCompLaB v1.0: a scalable pore-scale model for flow, biogeochemistry, microbial metabolism, and biofilm dynamics\n\nHeewon Jung, Hyun-Seob Song, and Christof Meile\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 1683–1696, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-1683-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-1683-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMicrobial activity responsible for many chemical transformations depends on environmental conditions. These can vary locally, e.g., between poorly connected pores in porous media. We present a modeling framework that resolves such small spatial scales explicitly, accounts for feedback between transport and biogeochemical conditions, and can integrate state-of-the-art representations of microbes in a computationally efficient way, making it broadly applicable in science and engineering use cases.\n\nValidation of a new spatially explicit process-based model (HETEROFOR) to simulate structurally and compositionally complex forest stands in eastern North America\n\nArthur Guignabert, Quentin Ponette, FrÃ©dÃ©ric AndrÃ©, Christian Messier, Philippe Nolet, and Mathieu Jonard\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 1661–1682, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-1661-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-1661-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSpatially explicit and process-based models are useful to test innovative forestry practices under changing and uncertain conditions. However, their larger use is often limited by the restricted range of species and stand structures they can reliably account for. We therefore calibrated and evaluated such a model, HETEROFOR, for 23 species across southern QuÃ©bec. Our results showed that the model is robust and can predict accurately both individual tree growth and stand dynamics in this region.\n\nGlobal agricultural ammonia emissions simulated with the ORCHIDEE land surface model\n\nMaureen Beaudor, Nicolas Vuichard, Juliette LathiÃ¨re, Nikolaos Evangeliou, Martin Van Damme, Lieven Clarisse, and Didier Hauglustaine\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 1053–1081, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-1053-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-1053-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAmmonia mainly comes from the agricultural sector, and its volatilization relies on environmental variables. Our approach aims at benefiting from an Earth system model framework to estimate it. By doing so, we represent a consistent spatial distribution of the emissions' response to environmental changes. We greatly improved the seasonal cycle of emissions compared with previous work. In addition, our model includes natural soil emissions (that are rarely represented in modeling approaches).\n\nForamEcoGEnIE 2.0: incorporating symbiosis and spine traits into a trait-based global planktic foraminiferal model\n\nRui Ying, Fanny M. Monteiro, Jamie D. Wilson, and Daniela N. Schmidt\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 813–832, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-813-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-813-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPlanktic foraminifera are marine-calcifying zooplankton; their shells are widely used to measure past temperature and productivity. We developed ForamEcoGEnIE 2.0 to simulate the four subgroups of this organism. We found that the relative abundance distribution agrees with marine sediment core-top data and that carbon export and biomass are close to sediment trap and plankton net observations respectively. This model provides the opportunity to study foraminiferal ecology in any geological era.\n\nFABM-NflexPD 2.0: testing an instantaneous acclimation approach for modeling the implications of phytoplankton eco-physiology for the carbon and nutrient cycles\n\nOnur Kerimoglu, Markus Pahlow, Prima Anugerahanti, and Sherwood Lan Smith\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 95–108, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-95-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-95-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn classical models that track the changes in the elemental composition of phytoplankton, additional state variables are required for each element resolved. In this study, we show how the behavior of such an explicit model can be approximated using an instantaneous acclimation approach, in which the elemental composition of the phytoplankton is assumed to adjust to an optimal value instantaneously. Through rigorous tests, we evaluate the consistency of this scheme.\n\nEvaluating the vegetationâatmosphere coupling strength of ORCHIDEE land surface model (v7266)\n\nYuan Zhang, Devaraju Narayanappa, Philippe Ciais, Wei Li, Daniel Goll, Nicolas Vuichard, Martin G. De Kauwe, Laurent Li, and Fabienne Maignan\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 9111–9125, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-9111-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-9111-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThere are a few studies to examine if current models correctly represented the complex processes of transpiration. Here, we use a coefficient Ω, which indicates if transpiration is mainly controlled by vegetation processes or by turbulence, to evaluate the ORCHIDEE model. We found a good performance of ORCHIDEE, but due to compensation of biases in different processes, we also identified how different factors control Ω and where the model is wrong. Our method is generic to evaluate other models.\n\nNon-Redfieldian carbon model for the Baltic Sea (ERGOM version 1.2) â implementation and budget estimates\n\nThomas Neumann, Hagen Radtke, Bronwyn Cahill, Martin Schmidt, and Gregor Rehder\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 8473–8540, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-8473-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-8473-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMarine ecosystem models are usually constrained by the elements nitrogen and phosphorus and consider carbon in organic matter in a fixed ratio. Recent observations show a substantial deviation from the simulated carbon cycle variables. In this study, we present a marine ecosystem model for the Baltic Sea which allows for a flexible uptake ratio for carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. With this extension, the model reflects much more reasonable variables of the marine carbon cycle.\n\nImplementation of a new crop phenology and irrigation scheme in the ISBA land surface model using SURFEX_v8.1\n\nArsÃ¨ne Druel, Simon Munier, Anthony Mucia, ClÃ©ment Albergel, and Jean-Christophe Calvet\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 8453–8471, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-8453-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-8453-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCrop phenology and irrigation is implemented into a land surface model able to work at a global scale. A case study is presented over Nebraska (USA). Simulations with and without the new scheme are compared to different satellite-based observations. The model is able to produce a realistic yearly irrigation water amount. The irrigation scheme improves the simulated leaf area index, gross primary productivity, evapotransipiration, and land surface temperature.\n\nSimulating long-term responses of soil organic matter turnover to substrate stoichiometry by abstracting fast and small-scale microbial processes: the Soil Enzyme Steady Allocation Model (SESAM; v3.0)\n\nThomas Wutzler, Lin Yu, Marion Schrumpf, and SÃ¶nke Zaehle\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 8377–8393, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-8377-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-8377-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSoil microbes process soil organic matter and affect carbon storage and plant nutrition at the ecosystem scale. We hypothesized that decadal dynamics is constrained by the ratios of elements in litter inputs, microbes, and matter and that microbial community optimizes growth. This allowed the SESAM model to descibe decadal-term carbon sequestration in soils and other biogeochemical processes explicitly accounting for microbial processes but without its problematic fine-scale parameterization.\n\nModeling demographic-driven vegetation dynamics and ecosystem biogeochemical cycling in NASA GISS's Earth system model (ModelE-BiomeE v.1.0)\n\nEnsheng Weng, Igor Aleinov, Ram Singh, Michael J. Puma, Sonali S. McDermid, Nancy Y. Kiang, Maxwell Kelley, Kevin Wilcox, Ray Dybzinski, Caroline E. Farrior, Stephen W. Pacala, and Benjamin I. Cook\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 8153–8180, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-8153-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-8153-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe develop a demographic vegetation model to improve the representation of terrestrial vegetation dynamics and ecosystem biogeochemical cycles in the Goddard Institute for Space Studies ModelE. The individual-based competition for light and soil resources makes the modeling of eco-evolutionary optimality possible. This model will enable ModelE to simulate long-term biogeophysical and biogeochemical feedbacks between the climate system and land ecosystems at decadal to centurial temporal scales.\n\nCited articles"
