        "text": "📣🆕ENC Analysis is out 👉🏽 “Film festivals and cities: A view for south-eastern Europe” by Dr. Eleni Sideri, ENC Academic Council Member and Assistant Professor at the Department of Balkan, Slavic & Oriental Studies of the University of Macedonia. In this ENC analysis, Dr. Sideri examines how film festivals in the southeastern European periphery contributed to the transformation of #Thessaloniki🇬🇷, #Sarajevo🇧🇦 and #Tbilisi🇬🇪 into regional film centers. The paper studies the ways film festivals, especially film markets, became a tool for cities to address economic and political challenges raised within the framework of #Europeanization 🇪🇺 but also, how the past through cultural memory seems to entangle with these changes and become an important factor for the transformation of these cities. Read the paper here 🔗 http://bit.ly/48Cw9nI\n\nIncredibly insightful thoughts about the current situation in the industry and the changes that need to be made. Take some time to read the latest Nostradamus report. If you follow Ted Hope’s newsletter, you’ll enjoy the insight he adds into this report. Film i Vast’s Tomas Eskilsson has enlightening thoughts on the current film funding models and the theatrical ecosystem. I enjoyed Robert Franke insight on the creator industry within the film/tv industry. Joanna Szymanska comments on choosing collaborators with smaller budgets because of their qualities as human beings as opposed someone not so friendly who gives you money. Hannah Reifgerst is spot on with her analogy of the opera for adults to the cinemas for teenagers. For many it’s only affordable for a once a year type of experience. There is so much more wisdom and insights to ponder in the report from: Angela Chan Fatima Djoumer Guillaume Esmiol TABITHA JACKSON Kjersti Mo Gaia Tridente I would have pulled quotes from everyone, but then I would have just copy & pasted the whole report on this post.\n\nRussian filmmaker advocates for holding Eurasian Oscars this year In the spring of 2022 Nikita Mikhalkov proposed creating the Eurasia Film Academy and an awards show to go with it, envisioned as an Oscars-type event Creating the Eurasia Film Academy and holding its awards show this year would be a best-case scenario, as the Filmmakers' Union has already provided the Russian Culture Ministry with its proposals on how to do this, a People's Artist of Russia and the Chairman of Russian Filmmakers' Union Nikita Mikhalkov told TASS. \"The committee has been established. The proposal came from me, it was supported by Presidents Putin and Xi, as well as Prime Minister Mishustin. It was sent to the Ministry of Culture. On behalf of the Filmmakers' Union, we have given our proposals regarding the regulations and are now waiting. The best-case scenario would be [to hold the awards] this year, and at the very least, to create this academy and get things moving,\" the director said. In the spring of 2022 Mikhalkov proposed creating the Eurasia Film Academy and an awards show to go with it, envisioned as an Oscars-type event. Mikhalkov views the creation of these institutions as necessary for \"the development of the Eurasian region.\" #business #finance #financialservices\n\nOne of the things I like most about consuming a ton of movies in a short period is that is a bit of cultural thermometer for themes and techniques. Why do we tell the stories that we do? Why do we tell them as we do? What is needed to break the status quo? What is it that people want, and how – if it takes three years or so to launch a production – do our movies ever align with those wants? Frankly, I am seeing these questions emerge as themes in a lot of work, although I also think it is a question of me wanting to see these themes expressed in work. To the hammer, everything looks like a nail, right? Come ponder this with me: https://lnkd.in/g6ucZwqZ\n\n66 experts from the European children's film industry as well as representatives from film and cultural policy bodies will meet in the German city of Erfurt to explore new strategies and policies aimed at strengthening the production, marketing and distribution of children’s film in Europe. The fourth edition of KIDS Regio Forum takes place 27-28 June under the patronage of both the European Parliament and the President of Eurimages - Council of Europe, Catherine Trautmann. The opening keynote is being delivered by Rikke Flodin, who will unveil key results of the new \"Keeping Up With Children as an Audience\" report. A joint project by KIDS Regio and Will & Agency / PUBLIKUM, this comprehensive qualitative study conducted over 12 European territories will provide valuable insights into the world of young cinema-goers. The findings will serve as a basis to positively shape the future of European film."
