        "text": "After the Second World War, plastics paved the way for an era of seemingly limitless consumption. Mass-produced, inexpensive and capable of being produced in almost any colour and shape, they stimulated product design and industrial production. While the private sector drove their spread in the Western world, politics did so in the countries of state socialism. There was a worldwide boom in promising synthetic materials that could no longer be stopped.\n\nAccording to the maxim “Chemistry provides bread, prosperity, and beauty”, the GDR set the course for “Plaste and Elaste” [Plastics and Rubber] in everyday life around 1960. But despite high investments, it found it difficult to keep up with Western innovations. In the middle of the decade, polyurethane appeared on the horizon, made ready for the market by the West German Bayer Group. It penetrated new areas of application such as furniture construction. This was spectacularly demonstrated by the “Panton Chair”, made in one piece. West German designers such as Ernst Moeckl and Peter Ghyczy also celebrated the feeling of life freed from conventions of the POP era with flowing shapes and intense colours.\n\nEnthusiastic about the modern way of being able to produce furniture from plastic instead of wood on a massive scale, the GDR bought machines and designs for the production of PUR furniture in the Federal Republic at the beginning of the 1970s. Soon, more plastic furniture was produced from polyurethane than in any other country in the world. They were staged as a sign of socialist progress, without naming the West German origins. In addition, creative original designs for furniture made of PUR were created at universities and in companies by East German form designers,\n\nsome of which, however, were not implemented.\n\nThe exhibition explores the production of PUR furniture up to the early 1980s and displays numerous iconic and hitherto little-known examples of furniture – designed in the Federal Republic and the GDR – alongside photos, advertising, and film excerpts. It addresses design-historical and economic-political aspects and asks about the future handling of the difficult-to-recycle material polyurethane.\n\nThe exhibition was co-created with the Kunstgewerbemuseum Dresden, Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresen and was supported by Bundesstiftung Aufarbeitung and BASF. The Museum of Utopia and Everyday Life is an institution of the district Landkreis Oder-Spree and is supported by the federal state Land Brandenburg.\n\nClose\n\nU5 deliberately refrains from extensive historical analysis and instead focuses on everyday anecdotes, personal memories and youthful longings.\n\nWhich stories are told, which are forgotten? How do our personal memories and ideas shape the perception of objects?\n\nTaking cues from the items’ materialities, colors and functions, U5 deliberately disrupt familiar attributions. An open space emerges from the supposedly bygone and closed past, which – also with the help of the audience – repeatedly gives rise to new narratives and contexts. In the entrance area, U5 allows collection objects and artworks to merge into one another following patterns of shapes and colors in an expansive installation. The arrangement is accompanied by an 89-piece tarot card set, the Tarot der kleinen Dinge. Instead of negotiating grand and abstract questions of life, the cards focus on the mundane and applicable.\n\nAmong the museum objects that have captured the artists’ attention is a box of photo slides from a GDR Antarctic expedition. The slides recount the history of the Georg-Foster Station, whose last expedition team commenced their service in October 1989, just before the fall of the Berlin Wall. These images inspired U5 to create several artworks: the video piece 1985, the series 6 Flags: Pictures from Antarctica, as well as six original Recreation Areas.\n\nAn open space emerges from the supposedly bygone and closed past, which – also with the help of the audience – repeatedly gives rise to new narratives and contexts. The artists invite the public on a witty, critical-feminist journey that evokes the magic of everyday life in an interplay between association and memory.\n\nThe Museum Utopie und Alltag’s concerns extend beyond contextualizing and coming to terms with the past academically; it also seeks to critically challenge contemporary discourse on remembrance through artistic methods. For several years now, the museum has regularly invited artists to creatively engage with its collection and to enrich the ongoing exchange of ideas.\n\nDer Reiniger, die Katze und der Mond is a follow-up to the exhibition I love Clark, presented at the beginning of the year at the Brandenburgischer Kunstverein Potsdam.\n\nFounded in 2007, U5 is an artists’ collective whose diverse artistic work involves selecting and exploring various media and materials based on interest and urgency. U5 explores traits of collective action and perception in artistic production, exhibitions as well as research initiatives.\n\nLea Schleiffenbaum is an art historian and independent curator. Her projects and exhibitions in public space are realized for the Neue Auftraggeber, among others. Helene Romakin is a cultural researcher, independent curator and author. In 2023 she successfully completed her doctoral thesis on the anthropocene and storytelling at the ETH Zurich.\n\nThe exhibition was made possible with the support of the Swiss cultural foundation Pro Helvetia and GeWi – Gebäudewirtschaft Eisenhüttenstadt GmbH.\n\nVenue\n\nMuseum Utopie und Alltag\n\nErich-Weinert-Allee 3,\n\n15890 Eisenhüttenstadt\n\nClose\n\nThe revolutions that artists have addressed in their prints include not only the October Revolution and the Peasants’ War, but also the November-, the French- and the Peaceful Revolution of 1989. The selected etchings, lithographs, woodcuts and silkscreens convey a complex, sometimes critical approach to historical events that can still be relevant.\n\nPortfolios of prints from the GDR\n\nAn exhibition in three places:\n\nRevolutions, Museum of Utopia and Daily Life in Eisenhüttenstadt, June 3 – October 8, 2023 (opening on June 2, 2023)\n\nPrometheus und Co., BLMK Cottbus, June 4 – August 20, 2023 (opening on June 3, 2023)\n\nBetween arcadia and residential area, BLMK Frankfurt (Oder), June 4 – August 20, 2023 (opening on June 4, 2023)\n\nA cooperation between the Brandenburgische Landesmuseum für moderne Kunst and the Museum of Utopia and Everyday Life.\n\nClose\n\nThe “project of the century” was accompanied by a major cultural campaign: the GDR brought artists to the pipeline to entertain the “Trasniks”, as the workers were known; artworks were also produced on-site, which were presented at touring exhibitions along the pipeline and in the GDR. The infrastructure project was also showcased in publications and numerous television reports. This exhibition focuses on the connection between culture and economic policy, investigating the image that was constructed for the general public and the role that art played in the process.\n\nExhibition venue: ehem. Selbstbedienungskaufhalle, Saarlouiser Straße 60a, Eisenhüttenstadt\n\nThe project is part of the theme year Kulturland Brandenburg 2021: “The future of the Past – Industrial culture in motion”\n\nThe theme year Kulturland Brandenburg 2021 is funded by the Ministry for Science, Research and Culture, as well as the Ministry for Infrastructure and State Planning of the State of Brandenburg.\n\nMit freundlicher Unterstützung der brandenburgischen Sparkassen.\n\nMit freundlicher Unterstützung der Investitionsbank des Landes Brandenburg.\n\nSpecial thanks to Holger Friedrich for kindly providing the project space for the exhibition.\n\nClose\n\nThe Beeskow Art Archive houses a special stock of artistic works from 40 years of the GDR that is of cultural and art historical interest. Owned by parties, mass organisations and state institutions of the GDR before 1990, the works have belonged to the new federal states since German reunification. The Beeskow depot holds the shares of the states of Berlin, Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. The exhibition “Zeitumstellung” is part of a reorientation whose aim is, among other things, to open up the collection even more to new perspectives through a contemporary approach.\n\nSchloss Biesdorf, as the municipal gallery of the district of Marzahn-Hellersdorf, has already worked together with the Beeskow Art Archive in recent years. Smaller presentations from the context there and also selected positioning of individual works in the current contemporary context have been shown several times.\n\nIn this exhibition, the focus is now on works from Beeskow.\n\nIn dialogue with contemporary works, this exhibition can offer a further contribution to the discussion about the artistic heritage of the GDR. he exhibition will be accompanied by an educational programme.\n\nArtists in the exhibition:\n\nJoachim Bayer, Claudia Borchers, Gudrun Brüne, Manfred Butzmann, Fritz Duda, Wolfgang Eckhardt, Bernhard Franke, Friedrich-Wilhelm Fretwurst, Peter Fritz, Ellen Fuhr, Gerhard Füsser, Dieter Gantz, Albrecht Gehse, Gerd Gombert, Max Görner, Bruno Griesel, Claas Gutsche, Ruthild Hahne, Monika Hamann, Harald Hauswald, Michael Hegewald, Hermann Hensel, Eberhard Hertwig, Christa und Günter Hoffmann, Martin Hoffmann/Reinhard Zabka, Frenzy Höhne, Jo Jastram, Doris Kahane, Susanne Kandt-Horn, Doris Karras, Achim Kircher, Konrad Knebel, Kurt-Hermann Kühn, Rolf Lindemann, Harry Lüttger, Maria Mateva, Harald Metzkes, Ingeborg Michaelis, Paul Michaelis, Rainer Muhrbeck, Barbara Müller-Kageler, Gudrun Petersdorff, Mario Pfeifer, Carla Pohl, Volker Pohlenz, Inken Reinert, Lothar Rericha, Gottfried Richter, Horst Ring, Gerhard Rommel, Gerti Schlegel, Rolf Xago Schröder, Werner Schulz, Maria Sewcz, Hartmut Staake, Daniel Theiler, Hans Ticha, Andreas Wachter, Norbert Wagenbrett, Malte Wandel, Christoph Wetzel, Walter Womacka, Axel Wunsch, Thomas Ziegler, Annett Zinsmeister, Christof Zwiener\n\nCurated by Elke Neumann\n\nA cooperation project between Schloss Biesdorf and the Kunstarchiv Beeskow.\n\nClose\n\nHardly any other photographer has shed light on East Germans and their livelihoods as intensively and from as many perspectives as Roger Melis (1940–2009). For three decades, the co-founder and master of East German photo-realism travelled from Berlin throughout the GDR, a country under SED rule that he often perceived as “silent” and petrified. In atmospherically dense, often symbolic photographs, he documents the everyday life of people in urban and rural locations, their working and living conditions, as well as more or less voluntarily executed political rituals in a real socialist environment.\n\nVivid photographs of writers and visual artists made Melis renowned in the 1960s both in the East and West. Many of his portraits of authors, including Anna Seghers, Heiner Müller, Christa Wolf, Sarah Kirsch and Wolf Biermann, subsequently became prominent in newspapers, magazines, books, calendars, posters and record covers, helping to shape the “face” of East German culture. Today, they are regarded as classics of the genre.\n\nMelis shows the same care in portraying people from almost all social fields: workers and managing directors, farmers and foresters, craftsmen and traders, children and teenagers, functionaries and dissidents.\n\nMelis preferred to seek out people where they worked, showing everyone the same respect. His portraits of East Germans refrain from depicting types, nor do they attempt to expose anyone. Instead they approach people gently and are open to the diversity of their experiences.\n\nThe empathetic portraits are complemented by a wide range of self-commissioned reports and striking milieu studies that combine to paint a multifaceted picture of the GDR. The images reflect the pride and confidence of East Germans, while also revealing signs of skepticism and resignation, as well as defiance and growing courage, which ultimately led to the system’s collapse.\n\nThe exhibition was produced in cooperation with the Roger Melis Archive and curated by Mathias Bertram. Two accompanying books entitled In einem stillen Land and Die Ostdeutschen have been published by Lehmstedt Verlag.\n\nClose"
