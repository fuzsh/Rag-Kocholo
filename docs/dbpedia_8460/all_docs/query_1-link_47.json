        "text": "One of the best and funniest co-workers any one could have. We spent a lot of days working together in all kinds of weather. He once pulled seniority on me and made me shovel snow to get our truck out of an ally after I told him he should not even try to make it through..He thought it was funny of course…but we had great times together…\n\nJim, Freeburg, Illinois, 62243\n\nPlease except our condolences.

No one sat in that chair but Joe and everyone knew that. He never seemed to age — always looked the same through the years. Peace be with everyone in the family. Rest in peace, Joe.\n\nKen Harris, Belleville, Illinois, 62226\n\nHaving gone through grade school and high school with Joe, I remember him as about the easiest person to befriend. He was kind, steady, reliable, and had a great sense of humor — a person you just liked to be around. God bless him and comfort those who mourn him. Our prayers and sympathy."
