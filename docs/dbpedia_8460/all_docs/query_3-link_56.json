        "text": "The Argentine Default and Debt Restructuring: The Economic Crisis and Dealing with Outstanding Debt, 1983-2012\n\nMario Buffalini, 2015\n\nThis paper explores the economic and political history of Argentina during the time period 1983-2014, which highlights the causes of Argentina’s economic crisis and 2001 default, the efforts to secure a favorable restructuring of its defaulted debt, and the current political and legal conflict with its outstanding creditors, the holdouts. A combination of historical research, graphs, models, cultural products, and analysis are used to explain this historical context as well as answer the central question: Why was Argentina’s negotiation process so prolonged and inefficient and why does it remain unresolved to this day?\n\nAfter observing the background of the crisis and aspects of the debt restructuring through individual chapters, the paper concludes that debt restructuring process has lasted so long due to hard-line positions from the Argentine government and holdout creditors. Additionally, the weak legal framework of the market-based sovereign debt restructuring have provided little ways for actors to hold each other accountable in honoring a deal. As Argentina’s crisis and debt restructuring constitutes a protracted and unresolved issue, final conclusions explain the need for future sovereign debt restructuring mechanisms in order to avoid long and costly negotiations such as the Argentina case.\n\nDouble Major: Latin America / Spanish\n\nProject Advisor: Dr. Simon Bilo\n\nLanguage Advisor: Dr. Graciela Maglia de Ferrari\n\nIncorporation of Bolivian Migrants in Argentine Society\n\nDanielle Frank, 2015\n\nHistorically North-South migration has been studied in the Americas. This means that Latin Americans were choosing to relocate north to the United States or Canada. However, this type of migration is no longer the most popular route. South-South migration has become the popular route for most Latin Americans, choosing Argentina, Brazil or Mexico instead. In this paper I examine Bolivian migrants in Argentina. I look at political, economic, and social factors to see if Bolivian migrants are incorporating into Argentine society. I go through the history of Argentina and examine why Bolivians choose Argentina over other countries. I discover that Bolivians are in fact not incorporating into Argentine society, but instead are incorporating into Bolivian migrant society in Argentina.\n\nMajor Track: Latin America\n\nProject Advisor: Dr. Shannan Mattiace\n\nLanguage Advisor: Dr. Graciela Maglia de Ferrari\n\nA comprehensive investigation of Senegal’s waste management system and its effects on human health\n\nAmanda Geary, 2015\n\nDuring my semester studying in Senegal, in the fall of 2013, I realized that the small West African nation was in dire need of a better system to deal with waste. In my paper, I examine several different aspects of life in Senegal which effect the waste management system. I investigate historical attitudes towards garbage, the economics of the current situation, the science behind Senegal’s garbage, and the response from the International community. I explore how religion and gender have shaped the industry. I also discuss the reality of foreign dumping, and why the Basel Convention and Bamako Convention are falling short of what they aimed to originally achieve. I explore the impact of different waste disposal methods on human health, the environment and marine biodiversity in the Atlantic ocean. The paper concludes with some suggestions for the Senegalese waste management sector and recommendations based on the successes of other nations.\n\nMajor Track: Middle East / Northern Africa\n\nProject and Language Advisor: Dr, Phillip Wolfe\n\nFraming Historical Memory: The Nanjing Massacre, Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands and The Yasukuni Shrine and their Historical Memory for China and Japan\n\nKathryn Goodman, 2015\n\nWhat is history? What are memories? And why are they collectively an important aspect of understanding a nation’s past, present and future? In Framing Historical Memory, the context of historical memory or how the past is viewed is analyzed in relation to China and Japan. Specifically, looking at the Nanjing Massacre of 1937 and how both nations have viewed the event and how memories of that event still affect relations between both nations. The Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo and the Senkaku (Japan) or Diaoyu (China) Islands are two case studies that are analyzed along with Nanjing, to emphasize the complex nature of historical memory for these two nations.\n\nOverall, this paper touches on each case study separately along with an analysis from the point of view from both China and Japan. Chapter 1 is an introduction to the subject of historical memory. Historical memory or collective memory for the sake of this paper is defined as the narrative orchestrated by a nation or a group in order to remember and never forget a past memory. Historical memory is important for creating an identity for a group or for creating an nationality or sense of unity within a nation. In Chapter 2, the Nanjing Massacre is described from a balanced point of view and then related topics such as textbooks, death toll statistics and the International Military Tribunal for the Far East are deconstructed for Japan and China. For both China and Japan, there is not a collective memory of the Nanjing Massacre. Even within Japan, there is a not a national consensus as to what occurred during that event. The author looks at the Massacre and its related topics f rom the viewpoints of China as a collective and then conservatives and liberals within Japan. Chapter 3 repeats the similar process for the Yasukuni Shrine but focuses on the enshrinement of Class A War Criminals and Japan’s Constitution. Similarly to the Nanjing Massacre, Japan has its own struggle with creating a narrative behind the Yasukuni Shrine within Japan currently. When the Yasukuni Shrine was created, it symbolized Japan’s beautiful prowess as a militaristic state. Now as Japan has denounced militarism, does the Yasukuni Shrine have the same meaning especially since 14 war criminals are honored within its facilities? Although the officials have been branded as war criminals, do they deserve the same respect to be honored as gods in Shinto tradition? In China, visits from Prime Ministers to the Yasukuni Shrine symbolizes Japan’s return to a militaristic state which can be labeled as a fear for the People’s Republic of China.\n\nChapter 4 discusses on the Senkaku or Diaoyu Islands, their ownership from the perspective of treaties, incidents that have caused negative responses from 1990 to 2012 within their relationship as well as the symbolic nature of the Islands for Sino-Japanese relations. The Islands represent the historical past of Sino-Japanese relations and its turbulent nature. The Islands also represent the misunderstandings that have happened over the course of time between Japan and China.\n\nIn conclusion, the author concludes that the Nanjing Massacre and its historical memory for both nations is a contributing factor to the debates surrounding Yasukuni. However, the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands relates to the historical memory China has of Japan since even before the First Sino-Japanese War. The Nanjing Massacre does not affect the territorial dispute as it does the commemoration of the war dead but all three events are still relevant in Sino-Japanese relations.\n\nMajor Track: East Asia\n\nProject Advisor: Dr. Sharon Wesoky\n\nLanguage Advisor: Dr. Xiaoling Shi\n\nInevitable Realities: Violence In Honduras And Nicaragua\n\nStefanie Gutierrez Cuadra, 2015\n\nDifferent models have been developed to explain the levels of violence in Central America, especially in the countries of the Northern Triangle and Nicaragua. Statistics and evidence in regards to the phenomenon of violence in the region do not offer a homogenous explanation but rather open debate for interpretation and questioning, since the concept itself is multifaceted. As a result, the objective behind this dissertation is to investigate how and why levels of violence differ in a qualitative and quantitative manner. The objective, however, is not concentrated on general violence but rather violence in relation to gang activity in Honduras and Nicaragua. The hypothesis guiding this study is that violence has an intricate relationship with the poverty levels of each country. However, such assertion is challenged given that Nicaragua, Central America’s poorest country, is the safest while Honduras is just as poor but stands as the world’s most dangerous country outside of a war-zone. San Pedro Sula, the Honduras’ second largest city, has remained the most dangerous city in the world for the past four consecutive years with an alarming rate of 171 homicides per 100,000 habitants just in 2014. In order to provide an answer to this paradoxical configuration, I examine closely how gangs in each country differ. I then form a comparative framework in which Nicaragua and Honduras are analyzed historically, politically and socioeconomically in order to extract the determinant factor responsible for the different levels of violence in each county – the police force.\n\nMajor Track: Latin America\n\nProject Advisor: Dr. Shannan Mattiace\n\nLanguage Advisor: Dr. Barbara Riess\n\nReassessing the Goals of the Past: A Reflection on the Development, Creation, and Outcomes of Plan Colombia\n\nKalyssa King, 2015\n\nThis project begins with exploring the causes of the hardships facing Colombia in 1999 through film and secondary sources. It transitions into the formal creation of Plan Colombia, outlining specific goals and initiatives including external influence of the United States. The study then examines the outcomes of the Plan in order to observe if the country met the goals of Plan Colombia.\n\nIn 1999 Colombia was facing an increase in economic problems, human rights violations, and participation in the illegal drug industry. While the country was experiencing these roadblocks it was also backed with a lack of judicial standing and minor social development. Plan Colombia, proposed by Colombia, created a comprehensive document to help better the condition of the country. In order for the Plan to be implemented, Colombia needed external assistance. The United States provided aid for the Plan but through doing so influenced the goals to be prioritized when implementing the Plan. Through examination of the outcomes it becomes apparent that there was a clear emphasis placed on the development of specific sectors, which did not equally meet all goals. It also provides for suggestions when approaching future policy.\n\nDouble Major: Latin America / Spanish\n\nProject Advisor: Dr. Shannan Mattiace\n\nLanguage Advisor: Dr. Graciela Maglia de Ferrari\n\nHitler’s Consolidation of Power via the Remilitarization of the Rhineland (1936)\n\nTimothy Kloeppel, 2015\n\nThe Remilitarization of the Rhineland in 1936 was a pivotal interwar event for Germany. The following thesis contends that the Remilitarization allowed Hitler to more fully consolidate his power, and also that it was Germany’s first legitimate move towards war. The process of remilitarization allowed Hitler a critical view of those he viewed as ‘weak’ within his command structure – principally generals who had doubts about the operation. This ultimately led to a Nazi command apparatus where Hitler considered his viewpoint as superior and assumed total control in military and political decisions. Additionally, a remilitarized Rhineland spurred Germany on towards a greater rearmament push which benefited the war industries largely at the expense of average citizens. Ultimately, the Remilitarization set a precedent for Nazi foreign policy wherein Hitler became more and more aggressive. This culminated in the Sudeten Crisis of 1938 and would later spell the outbreak of the Second World War. The significance of the Remilitarization of 1936 was that it represented Hitler’s assumption of hubris, which would lead 3 years later to the outbreak of war.\n\nMajor Track: Europe\n\nProject and Language Advisor: Dr. Peter Ensberg\n\nGroup Cohesion and Civil War Outcome\n\nPhil Powell, 2015\n\nWhat conditions favor insurgent victory in civil war? In the paper, I study two conflicts- the Nepalese Civil War (1996-2006), and the Algerian Civil War (1992-2002). I find that unity was important for the insurgent victory in Nepal, but fragmentation in Algeria led to the insurgent’s defeat. Rebel unity in Nepal eliminated the opportunity for inter-rebel violence and promoted consistent tactics that minimized civilian casualties and maintained civilian support for the war. Further, the parliamentary government was very divided. This facilitated inconsistent policies characterized by excessive police brutality. Rebel fragmentation in Algeria promoted competition between insurgent groups. This competition drained their material resources and reduced their legitimacy. Further, one of these groups, the GIA, began a campaign of indiscriminate terror against civilians to deter defection to opposing groups and the government. This strategy backfired, and greatly reduced support for all of the insurgents in Algeria. At the same time, the government acted decisively and implemented policies that strengthened the security apparatus and addressed grievances that had initially fueled the rebellion. These cases suggest that the level of cohesion among rebel groups and governments can significantly influence the strategies they pursue. Groups that are characterized by high levels of cohesion are more flexible in their responses to changes in the conflict.\n\nMajor Track: Middle East/Northern Africa\n\nProject Advisor: Dr. Shanna Kirschner\n\nLanguage Advisor: Dr. Briana Lewis\n\nWhat’s There to Learn?: The Diminishing Relationship Between Education and Economic Growth in the Middle East and North Africa\n\nTaylor Sherbine, 2015\n\nEducation throughout the Middle East and North Africa has made significant improvements since the 1960s; however, the higher level of investment in education has not been associated with economic growth when compared to East Asia and Latin America. There are many opinions as to the causes for the weak education-growth relationship in MENA. This paper reviews four frequently debated factors preventing growth – politicization, overcentralization, financial allocation, and unequal distribution – in order to do a comparative analysis to determine the more important factors. I find that politicization and unequal distribution are the two most significant factors preventing economic growth in the region.\n\nMajor Track: Middle East / Northern Africa\n\nProject Advisor: Dr. Shanna Kirschner\n\nLanguage Advisor: Dr. Briana Lewis\n\nThey Love U.S., They Love U.S. Not: Perceptions of the United States by the Modern Youth of France\n\nRandi Smail, 2015\n\nSince the liberation of France at the end of WWII, the nation has frequently found itself at odds with the United States over nearly every subject possible: foreign politics, movies, food, etc. The goal of this paper is to shed some light on modern French perceptions of the U.S., specifically those held by the younger generations. I suggest how certain opinions were formed and reinforced over time and how these same opinions resonate amongst the French youth today. Provided is a condensed history of Franco-American foreign policy issues spanning from immediately after the French Liberation to current events in 2013. There are also examples of cultural quarrels the two nations have engaged in, including the debate over the existence of McDonald’s, Euro Disney, and Coca-Cola in France. Highlighted are moments in which the French found themselves incorporating pieces of the foreign culture that they were at the same time trying to oppose. A final section is dedicated to personal observations from my time studying abroad in Angers, France. Despite the recurring bickering, the nations remain as Charles de Gaulle astutely remarked of France: “un ami, allié, pas aligné;” which is exactly how the French youth see the U.S. – friendly, an ally, but not quite aligned with the values of French society.\n\nMajor Track: Europe\n\nProject Advisor: Dr. Barry Shapiro\n\nLanguage Advisor: Dr. Briana Lewis\n\nThe Impact of Gaullist Policies on the Development of the French Nuclear Arsenal\n\nStephanie Walker, 2015\n\nThe use of nuclear weapons changed the way that world conflicts and politics were conducted. While nuclear weapons have only been used on one occasion, the two bombs detonated in Japan that ended the Second World War, their immense power has had impacts far beyond their use as weapons. Their impact can be seen within development of the French nuclear arsenal. In 1960, under French President Charles de Gaulle, the French program became operational. President de Gaulle desired to create an independent French nuclear arsenal that would increase France’s international status and diminish the influence of the American hegemony in European affairs. France was extremely limited by the size of their arsenal which created gaps between the stated and operational abilities of the arsenal to fulfill Gaullist doctrine. By examining the development of politics, technologies and doctrines of the French nuclear program, the prevalence of Gaullist policies and their short comings can be examined. The development of a specifically French doctrine shows how the political motivations were expressed through the elements of deterrence within the French program. The impact of Gaullist policies lasted beyond the Gaullist era and helped to create the strong, unified, Europe of today.\n\nMajor Track: Europe\n\nProject Advisor: Dr. Howard Tomashiro\n\nLanguage Advisor: Dr. Phillip Wolfe\n\nPollution In China and How It Altered the Relationship Between the Government and the People\n\nSamantha Wanko, 2015\n\nIn this paper I analyze how pollution altered the relationship between the government and people in China. I delve into the severity of pollution in China by discussing two water pollution cases, the Huai and Hai Rivers, and one air pollution case, Beijing. I also discuss Chai Jing’s recent documentary Under the Dome: Investigating China’s Smog, as it has attracted attention within and outside of China.\n\nThe relationship between the government and the people in China has changed in two areas: the government is more responsive, and the people are willing to act. Led by Xi Jinping, the government is undergoing internal changes. Based on his determination seen in his anti-corruption campaign and the new environmental law enacted on January 1, 2015, Xi Jinping has the potential to create a successful and sustainable China. However, these actions are meant to solidify the Chinese Communist Party in response to recent protests; the people, no longer willing to be silent, are demanding that their lives and environment be protected. Some claim that the stability of the Party is being threatened by the amount of social unrest due to pollution. To combat this dilemma, the Chinese government – in fear of losing power – has committed to pollution reduction. With the new environmental law, the government has demonstrated it is willing to enforce the laws it creates, and punish those who violate them. But what is unclear is whether the government is able to relinquish the dream of economic advancement for the improvement of the environment. Pollution has changed the relationship between the government and the people, and now the world waits to see how pollution will be handled and if the government will democratize.\n\nMajor Track: East Asia\n\nProject Advisor: Dr. Sharon Wesoky\n\nLanguage Advisor: Dr. Xiaoling Shi\n\nFrench Involvement in Syria and Lebanon: An Examination of the Indirect French Contributions to the Lebanese Civil War of 1975\n\nRosalie Woolf, 2015\n\nThe problems caused by Western powers through colonization and/or the maintenance of significant control in smaller, poorer nations around the world are vast and quite significant. In my senior project, I explore the issues that arose in Lebanon due to the French presence in the region, in particular those that arose under the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon. I sought to prove that the French, while in control of Lebanon, created many problems which resulted in a bloody civil war from 1975-1990. My research spanned from the initial French intervention of 1860 in Mount Lebanon to protect the Maronites, to the Mandate of 1920 and independence in 1943, until the eventual civil war in 1975. The results of this research show that the French had an impact, although indirect, upon the causing of the civil war through their policies of enhancing the separation of the various religious groups and showing extreme favoritism to the Maronites and other Christian groups. Through these two actions, the French unintentionally created an extremely tense situation in Lebanon that the Lebanese, once finally given independence, were left with. My overall conclusion is that the effects of Western, in this case specifically French, influence have been extremely damaging in Lebanon and that without this influence, there may have been peace in the now turbulent country."
