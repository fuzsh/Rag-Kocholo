        "text": "Matthew Todd Lauer (; born December 30, 1957) is an American former television news anchor. He was the co-host of NBC's Today show from 1997 to 2017, and a contributor for Dateline NBC. With NBC, he hosted the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade from 1998 to 2017 and co-hosted the opening ceremonies of several Olympic Games. He was also previously a news anchor for The Today Show from 1994 to 1997, anchor for WNBC in New York City and served as a local talk-show host in various cities (including co-hosting various local versions of PM Magazine) and entertainment news segments for HBO .Following allegations of his inappropriate sexual behavior, Lauer's contract was terminated by NBC in November 2017 after NBC reported receiving \"a detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace\" but added that the network had \"reason to believe this may not have been an isolated incident\".\n\nAl Roker, born Albert Lincoln Roker Jr., is an accomplished American weather forecaster, television presenter, author, and actor. He was born on August 20, 1954, in Queens, New York, showcasing a deep interest in broadcasting from an early age. His education at the State University of New York at Oswego, where he received a degree in communications, further solidified his passion for media. Roker's career has been marked by significant accomplishments in the world of television. His longstanding tenure as a weather anchor on NBC's The Today Show began in 1996, following an initial period as a fill-in. Roker's amiable personality and professionalism established him as a household name. He additionally gained recognition for reporting on some of the most destructive hurricanes in U.S. history. Beyond his weather-forecasting duties, Roker pioneered innovative programming as the CEO of Al Roker Entertainment, a leading producer of original TV content. In addition to his television career, Roker has made his mark as an author. He has penned several non-fiction books, including an acclaimed memoir titled Never Goin' Back: Winning the Weight Loss Battle For Good, which details his personal journey with weight loss and health. His noteworthy contributions have earned him multiple Emmy Awards, further attesting to his impact on the entertainment industry.\n\nMarv Albert, born Marvin Philip Aufrichtig on June 12, 1941, in Brooklyn, New York, grew into one of the most recognizable voices in sports broadcasting. His career was studded with significant moments that defined him as an unparalleled describer of sports action across various platforms, including television and radio. Albert's love for sports was apparent early in his life, with his first broadcasting gig at a local radio station while still attending Syracuse University. This marked the beginning of his illustrious six-decade-long career. Albert made a name for himself as a highly versatile commentator covering a variety of sports, but he became synonymous with basketball. His signature \"Yes!\" call during NBA games became a staple of American sports culture, establishing him as a legendary figure in the world of sportscasting. He served as the voice of the New York Knicks from 1967 to 2004, his dynamic style and energy adding an unforgettable vibe to the games. His work wasn't confined to the NBA; he was also a prominent presence in NFL broadcasts, boxing matches, and even the Olympics, demonstrating his vast range and adaptability. Despite a controversial personal life and temporary fallout from the broadcasting world in the late 1990s, Albert demonstrated resilience by bouncing back stronger. He returned to the broadcasting scene in 1999, resuming his role as a top-tier sports commentator and reaffirming his position in the industry. In 2015, he was rightfully inducted into the Sports Broadcasting Hall of Fame, a testament to his enduring influence and notable contributions to sports journalism. A true titan of his craft, Marv Albert's legacy is firmly etched in the annals of sports broadcasting history."
