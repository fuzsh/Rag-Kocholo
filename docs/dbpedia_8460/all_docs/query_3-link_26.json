        "text": "Be ready to immerse yourself in international affairs, diplomacy, and transatlantic relations. We’re thrilled to invite you for another year of celebrating German-American friendship. Regardless if you’re eager to make an impact on the global stage or are curious about stepping beyond borders, we are your platform to engage in US and German politics, international relations, and forecasts of our planet.\n\nConflict follows us around the globe spanning from the ongoing wars in Ukraine and Gaza, bipartisan division in the US, and the surge of extremist groups across Germany and Europe. Furthermore, combating climate change requires urgent action, and navigating AI in an increasingly connected and technology-focused society has strained cross-border relationships. This is not the time to shy away from silence, but to listen to those left out, treated unfairly, and with a different worldview. Global challenges mandate global solutions, making transatlantic collaboration and communal problem-solving more important than ever.\n\nAs always, we also have a dedicated topic for the 2024 conference. Introducing…\n\nHARD CONVERSATIONS\n\nWe believe this year’s theme is more relevant than ever! Conflict has become part of our everyday lives, and it’s crucial to keep the conversation going, even when it’s difficult to do so. Our goal is to tackle these hard conversations head-on to prevent further escalation and find common ground."
