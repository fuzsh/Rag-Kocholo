And the hard work that goes into presenting it reputably and successfully  Every evening Peter Kloeppel, Ulrike von der Groeben and their colleagues face the cameras. Whether for political headlines, business updates, or the latest sports scores, RTL Aktuell is the channel’s foremost news show. We accompany the team and show how much hard work goes into creating a few minutes of TV news. Exciting shows, popular docu- mentaries and happy winners in over 20 countries  Without American Idol pop star Kelly Clarkson would probably still be the girl next door from Texas. And without L‘amour est dans le pré many a French farmer would still be going to bed alone after mucking out the stables.This applies beyond France and America too, of course, as the most successful shows are one thing above all: worldwide audi- ence favorites! From draft manuscript to bestseller:The long road to producing a successful book  Random House is the world’s biggest trade book publisher, based in New York. The books of many international best- selling authors and Nobel Prize winners are published here –including The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg. We follow him and his editor on a book’s path from initial idea to market launch. Opening up growth markets: Corporate Centers in China, Brazil and India  On the fringes of Bertelsmann’s global management meeting we interviewed Annabelle Yu Long,Thomas Macken- brock and Pankaj Makkar –the heads of the Corporate Centers in China, Brazil and India –to discuss their interna- tional careers, their multifaceted roles and recognizing and tapping into the opportunity of growth markets, espe- cially in this age of new media. 06 14 3022 experience! 05 Radio & MusicDigital ServicesMagazines Clicking into the future: How a French radio station wins new listeners daily  Few media face such great challenges as radio at this point.The days of long radio programs are gone, as are those of endlessly repeating loops of hits. But what needs to be done differently today? What opportunities does Web 2.0 offer? The team of the French radio station Fun Radio knows what ideas will make them fit for the future –and are gaining new listeners in the process. We also take a look at BMG’s music rights manage- ment business –a response to the rapid changes in the music industry. Thomas Rabe: ‘An interplay of continuity and change’  The CEO of Bertelsmann talks about new strategies, internationality and growth. Success with new media: The young qeep team develops fresh ideas for mobile phones  When Bertelsmann invests several millions of euros in a Cologne start-up, it has good reasons for doing so.The young team of founders has made the right move at the right time with the idea of transferring gaming and friend networks from the Internet to cell phones. Tailor-made solutions for services and customers worldwide  More than 63,000 employees in 40 countries are hard at work serving business customers in many different industries. But what goes into producing a product and then shipping it to over 180 countries? Who is involved in the many different services behind this process? And how is it possible to coor- dinate such a huge logistics network? A behind-the-scenes look at a company that tends to stay in the background as a service provider. China, Spain, India, France: G + J magazines also have a strong international presence  It’s common knowledge that, with titles like stern, Geo and Brigitte, Gruner+Jahr is the home of fascinating magazines in Germany. But what does the publishing company have on the market in other countries? We spoke to readers world- wide about their favorite magazines and discovered a surprising diversity of titles –from an art magazine in India to China’s most popular fashion title. 36 46 68 52 60 experience!\n\n4. 06 Television 07 To the point– RTL Aktuell The news with Peter Kloeppel and Ulrike von der Groeben: relevant and close to the people, expert and easily understood. 20 minutes that involve many hours of work for correspon- dents around the world and an editorial team of 15 in Cologne Text: Steffi Kammerer. Photos: Arne Weychardt I t’s 5:53 p.m. Editorial Director Gerhard Kohlenbach broods over the schedule, tallying up the seconds. A young colleague hands him a report: A model has died following a beauty treatment. He glances at it, shakes his head, then he asks those around him: “Should we say, ‘Merkel stays’ or ‘Merkel stayed’? ‘Stays.’” An ordinary yet exciting news day in the RTL Aktuell news- room in Cologne, with a little over 45 minutes to go before the show goes on air. The German Chancellor is visiting Athens today, awaited by protesters bearing Molotov cocktails. And in Roswell, New Mexico, the Austrian Felix Baumgartner is poised to break the sound barrier in a free-fall jump from an altitude of 39 km. For hours, it has been unclear whether he can make the attempt as the wind is unfavorable. For the program, this means a potential hole of about two minutes. An alternative to the live report is prepared – a visit to Barack Obama’s grandmother in Kenya. A Television\n\n5. 08 Television As always, the editorial staff began plan- ning the news during the 10:30 a.m. conference call. Colleagues at the studios from Munich to Hamburg had proposed various items, and the foreign desk offered reports on Syria and Pakistan. As every morning, Kohlenbach had already read six daily newspapers, ten online news sites, and reviewed the headlines sent out by the newswires since midnight: “Otherwise I don’t feel I’m up to speed for the day.” His two chief editors arrive equally well pre- pared: Peter Kloeppel, who also anchors “RTL Aktuell,” reads the news online from 7:00 a.m.; Michael Wulf, Managing Director of infoNet- work and Managing Chief Editor of RTL Aktuell, has even installed a TV in his bathroom at home so he doesn’t miss anything while shaving. “News is my hobby,” says Wulf, adding he can’t imagine going a day without. “There’s no other way if you want to stay in the loop. Besides, I wouldn’t want it any other way; my work and personal interests overlap in that regard.” The next conference is at 2:00 p.m., and at this one the team more clearly defines the program’s look, the length of the items, and the overall structure. Kohlenbach takes his cue partly from how long his colleagues talk about a given item. Everyone is talking about Baumgart- ner’s jump through the sound barrier, so he gets 2 minutes 10 seconds. Rising electricity prices are given 1 minute 30 seconds. The Editorial Director’s desk is next to the conference table in the open-plan office. He sits facing three screens: on the right a live ticker, “The show has grown up. In some ways it has become more political and relevant” Peter Kloeppel, Chief Editor of RTL Television and RTL Aktuell anchorman Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland Facts and Figures  Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland includes the free-to-air TV channels RTL Television, VOX, n-tv and RTL Nitro, holdings in RTL II, Super RTL and the three digital channels RTL Crime, Passion and RTL Living. The morning starts with research online and in numerous print media.The morning conference starts after this at 10:30. All the external edito- rial staff participate remotely What are the latest news develop- ments? What’s happening in the world? And what are the results of the editorial team’s research in the newsroom? Topics that will be discussed at the conference at 2:00 p.m. 2:00 p.m. 10:30 a.m. 09 News & Magazines  RTL Aktuell, RTL Punkt 12, RTL Nachtjournal, VOX Nachrich- ten, news on n-tv. RTL Group’s German television channels of- fer a variety of news programs, plus tabloid-style magazine programs like Exklusiv, Explosiv and Prominent! The broadcast center in the Deutz district of Cologne is a state-of-the-art building with high-tech digital studios mounted on springs to protect them from vibrations. The building is equipped with emergency generators. Information everywhere: in the newsroom, news channels are running on countless screens as presenters and editors meet again to decide the main topics of the show on the left the incoming reports, in the middle his schedule, or running order. He quietly reads out the scripts to himself again and again. Every sentence has to sound good: “It’s a nerve-wrack- ing day today in Roswell, New Mexico.” He edits: “It is a truly nerve-wracking day.” Peter Kloeppel arrives and calls out: “Es- ther’s on the Web.” He has posted the news of a colleague’s early retirement on Facebook. One has to take the time to give people their due. As always, he was in make-up by 5:40 p.m. A quick four minutes is all it takes to prepare his face for television. Kohlenbach is also focused, but calm. “We never really start the show without still being short of reports,” he says. “6:30 to 6:45 p.m. is the most stressful time for me. Before that nothing’s really in yet. Then everything starts happening at once. Half of the reports still need some changes.” Even during the show, some- thing changes a little virtually every time, he says, but that is routine. “Of the team that are there today, 80 percent were here during our coverage of the Iraq war and 9/11. This puts me at ease, too – everyone here knows what’s important and what needs to be done.” Kohlenbach is responsible for the balance of the program. “We usually manage it by consen- sus, but in the end I have to make the decisions. From 5:30 p.m., we don’t discuss things much anymore. At that point there has to be one per- son in charge who says that a piece needs to be ten seconds longer or shorter. The next morning we can talk about everything – including wheth- er I made a mistake.” He has been Managing Editor since 2002 and also Editorial Director for five years, running a 15-strong editorial team. They are all on an informal first-name basis. Some of them have worked together for many years. Kohlenbach has been with RTL Televi- sion since 1994. When Peter Kloeppel’s 20th anniversary as anchorman of RTL Aktuell was celebrated in spring 2012 there were not only official speeches, but also a very private party where the editorial team treated their Chief Edi- tor to a rousing rendition of songs with rewritten lyrics, accompanied by weatherman Christian Häckl on the piano. When Kloeppel went down on bended knee in thanks and started a Mexican wave, many a tear was shed, says sports present- er Ulrike von der Groeben who has co-hosted thousands of programs with him. When she is out and about in Cologne, people often ask her to “Say hello to Mr. Kloeppel for me,” or ask “Is he really as nice in real life?” “Yes, he is,” she tells them. “He’s very well brought-up. And despite all his success he’s someone who’s not above saying thank you.” She has been married to her husband only a year longer than she has been sitting next to 2:45 p.m. A\n\n6. 10 Television Kloeppel in the studio. Both are rarely ever sick, and they’ve even run the New York Marathon together. Since Fall 2010, the RTL Television’s news programs have been produced in a broadcast center that is second to none. The light-filled building with a digitized high-tech studio is in the Deutz district of Cologne, just behind the railroad station. To minimize vibrations, the side away from the tracks was chosen, and the studios are mounted on metal springs. All risks have been hedged against, and all systems are backed up with emergency generators. The “newsdesk,” the editorial control center with close to 20 employees, coordinates all programs. This is where the central editorial calendar and the list of reporters who have been deployed hangs on the wall alongside a large map of the world. This is also where longer- term forward planning takes place, where major events like the election, the Olympics, or the starts of major lawsuits are entered in the calen- dar. A special hotline takes calls with breaking news that require a rapid response: Osama bin Laden has been killed. Or at 04:00 a.m.: Michael Jackson has died. Just a few doors down is the “newspool,” where all the footage is edited and audio is added, by several shifts of colleagues. In the senior editors’ section, Peter Kloeppel and Michael Wulf have offices next to each other with a view of the Rhine. The two make a good team, occasionally even finishing each other’s sentences. They have worked together since 1990, when Wulf was Managing Editor and Kloeppel was a New York correspondent. They have produced RTL Aktuell together since 2004. Asked why neither of them ever went elsewhere, Kloeppel says: “The workplace atmosphere. And we have great freedom when it comes to the realization of topics.” The hierarchies are flat, he says. “If a suggestion is good, we go ahead with it.” “News is my hobby. My work and interests overlap” Michael Wulf, Managing Director of infoNetwork In the newsroom, the first reports are edited and audio is added A camera crew in Bonn quickly procures original sound bites for a report RTL Anchorman Peter Kloeppel  Born in 1958, he studied agri- cultural science at Göttingen from 1978 to 1983 and trained at the Henri Nannen School of Journalism in Hamburg. After that, he was an editor and later studio manager at RTL-plus in Bonn and RTL correspondent in New York. Since 1992 he has been anchorman of RTL Aktuell and since 2004 also Chief Edi- tor of RTL Television. 4:00 p.m. 5:15 p.m. 11 Kloeppel won the Adolf Grimme Award for his coverage of September 11th, 2001. In 2007 RTL Aktuell won the German Television Award for best news program. For several years, the program has outperformed heute (ZDF) in the total audience ratings, and they’ve always been the most-watched news show among younger audiences. With a total of nearly four million viewers, RTL Aktuell is Germany’s second most popular news program, even overtaking Tagesschau (ARD) on some days. “The mix has to be right,” says Wulf. Domes- tic and foreign news, not only politics, but also coverage of services, medicine and sports. “We deliberately try to stay close to the people, which is probably what sets us apart from Tagesschau. We want to give the viewers news that plays a role in their lives. We call that ‘news to use.’ Each item has something special about it.” The two chief editors agree that a classic news item now initially reaches users via the In- ternet or the radio. “We’re here to provide more in-depth coverage. TV news should provide added value, selecting stories from the flood of information and putting them in context.” To gain orientation, the audience needs faces that present the news, says Wulf. Pointing to Peter Kloeppel, he says: “And he is a brand that view- ers have known for 20 years. When your brand is that good, you have to cultivate it.” RTL Aktuell’s Anchorman Peter Kloeppel only needs about four minutes in makeup before going on air The jacket’s been straightened.The mike is working.

Many reports aren’t completed until after the program has already begun. So when the red “on air” light goes on, it doesn’t mean that everything is done and dusted. The show is deliberately kept flexible to keep things as up-to-date as possible items Gerhard Kohlenbach has approved are marked in green. There aren’t many yet – only the start of the program is sorted. Kloeppel has taken off his jacket and is polishing his opening lines. 6:13 p.m. Not a sound is heard except the printer and the clatter of fingers on keyboards. 6:18 p.m. “Baumgartner gets 1:42,” says Kohlenbach. “He’s starting at around 7:15 p.m., we won’t be able to show that live, but at least the balloon should already be pretty full in the picture.” Kloeppel and von der Groeben have to get going soon. They are not allowed to use the el- evator in case it gets stuck. At the entrance to the ground floor studio the red “on air” lamp is illu- minated. The presenter of the previous program has just signed off. Changes are quickly made to the set. The texts that were being edited until just moments ago appear on the teleprompter. Dozens of spotlights shine from the ceiling and camera cranes are adjusted. The room is bright green, but the TV viewers at home will only see the usual studio background. Kloeppel and von der Groeben are hooked up with microphones. 6:42 p.m. Groeben plucks a bit of lint off her sleeve. Her face can be seen on one of the monitors. A dozen colleagues sit next door in the control room. In the next few min- utes the most common phrase heard here will be: “Why isn’t the item here yet?” The anchors are connected to the director by a small ear microphone. They both laugh. “Ten seconds,” shouts the floor manager. “Five.” The next morning it starts all over again. A new day with fresh news. Five days later, Felix Baumgartner is back on the news agenda.

Depending on the country, the names of these shows may be American Idol, Deutsch- land sucht den Superstar or L’amour est dans le pré, and they offer great enter- tainment and a lot of happy winners! Text: Tanja Breukelchen F or a long time, Kelly Clarkson was the girl next door with big dreams. Born in a small town in Texas, Kelly watched as her mother struggled to support her and her two older siblings – after her parents divorced when she was six. She very quickly understood the value of money – and the importance of a strong work ethic: “I’ve worked hard since I was seven years old: babysitting, tutoring, waitress- ing, baking pizza,” she said in an interview years later. Her talent for music was discovered at school, when teachers reportedly overheard her singing in the corridors and encouraged her to join the choir. Kelly did, and her goal in life suddenly became clear: she wanted to become a singer! She was determined to make her dreams a reality, so after graduating from high school, Kelly produced a demo CD at her own expense and moved to Los Angeles with a friend. Her first steps as a performer seemed auspicious. Kelly received A Shows\n\n9. 16 Shows The Company FremantleMedia is one of the world’s largest and most suc- cessful creators, producers and distributors of television enter- tainment brands, from prime time entertainment shows, to drama, reality formats, game shows,TV movies, soap operas, and kids and family enter- tainment programming.The company, a subsidiary of RTL Group, has three main business areas –production, licensing and distribution –and is also capitalizing on the digital world in many ways: by extending successful program brands on- line, by applying its distribution skills in a multi-platform world, and by creating original content initiatives for new platforms like YouTube and others. “I think I’ll always be entwined with Idol because it was such a great experience for me. I’m proud of everything I achieved with Idol, and away from Idol also” Kelly Clarkson, winner of the first season of American Idol Kelly Clarkson started her “Stronger”world tour in 2012. And at the end of the year, her first best-of album was released, Greatest Hits – Chapter One small television roles and worked with the songwriter Gerry Goffin for a short time. But then Goffin fell ill, and soon Kelly suffered yet another blow of fate. “It was the worst thing that had ever happened to me. On the day we had moved all the stuff we had bought with our hard-earned money into our apartment, we went out for a quick bite to eat. When we came back, everything was ablaze.” A neighbor had left a cigarette burning. For Kelly, then 19, it was seemingly the end of her career dreams – at least for the time being. Frustrated, she went back to Texas and worked various jobs, including as a waitress, a promoter and an usher, for several months. Then came the turning point. In 2002, Kelly’s friend Jessica Hugghins convinced her to audition for the TV show American Idol, which was being produced for the first time. The format, from Fremantle Media and 19 En- tertainment, had been a huge hit in the UK, on the country’s leading commercial broadcaster ITV during the winter months 2001 and 2002. From 10,000 candidates, Kelly emerged as one of the top 30 and received a record number of votes in the second round. On September 4th , 17 The Great Success American Idol started in 2002 and is, with an average 17.4 mil- lion viewers, currently the most successful entertainment series in the United States. In addition to Kelly Clarkson, many other participants have had national and international breakthroughs on this talent show, including Carrie Underwood, Chris Daughtry, Jennifer Hudson, Jordin Sparks, Clay Aiken and Adam Lambert. Over the past ten years, more than 60 singles from American Idol participants have reached top spots on the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S. Stars such as Paula Abdul, Jennifer Lopez, Steven Tyler and Mariah Carey have served on the judges’ panel. “I think I’ll always be entwined with Idol because it was such a great experience for me. I’m proud of everything I achieved with Idol, and away from Idol also” Kelly Clarkson, winner of the first season of American Idol A The six finalists of the first season (second from right: Kelly Clarkson) of the hit show American Idol, which remains at the top in of the ratings charts A friend convinced her to participate in the first season of American Idol. Good advice, because Kelly Clarkson (center, with Clay Aiken, left, and Ruben Studdard, right, the finalists of the sec- ond season) won the final round. It was the start of her international career she won the final round, becoming the first ever American Idol – and signed a contract with RCA Records. For Kelly Clarkson, winning American Idol meant the beginning of a spectacular interna- tional career. Her first hit single, Before Your Love / A Moment Like This, rose from number 52 to number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in October 2002, breaking the record for the big- gest leap to number one in a single week in the chart’s history. It went on to become the best- selling single of the year in the United States and her first album, Thankful, released in April 2003, went double platinum after selling more than 2.1 million copies in the United States. The album has since sold over 4.5 million copies worldwide. Great Britain, Australia, Canada... Kelly landed on the charts in more and more countries around the world, rising to superstardom. She had one hit after another from her albums Breakaway (2004), My December (2007), All I Ever Wanted (2009) and Stronger (2011), winning a string of awards along the way, including two Grammys, three MTV Video Music Awards, twelve Billboard Music Awards, and four American Music\n\n10. 18 Shows with an exciting judging panel featuring Randy Jackson, Mariah Carey, Nicky Minaj and Keith Urban. After all these years, the show that launched her spectacular career is never far from Kelly’s mind. Speaking about American Idol in an interview years after her win, she said: “I think I’ll always be entwined with Idol because it was such a great experience for me. I’m proud of everything I achieved with Idol, and away from Idol also.” It’s clear that through hard work, determi- nation, and incredible talent, Kelly has made her dreams a reality. For Kelly Clarkson, the working-class girl from Texas, participating in the show was a rags-to-riches story. “I used to have nothing. I was really poor,” Clarkson says today. “The fact that I have achieved so incred- ibly much is like a Cinderella story to me!” 2 Awards, along with countless nominations. In the ten years since she was crowned America’s first Idol, Kelly has sold more than 25 million albums and 36 million singles worldwide according to Billboard, solidifying her place as one of the best-selling solo performers of the decade. In 2012 she released her first great- est hits album Greatest Hits – Chapter One, dedicating the title track Catch My Breath to the family, friends and fans who have supported her through her journey from Idol winner to international superstar. Kelly’s turning point in life, American Idol, is still the most popular entertainment series in the United States and has now been shown in over 190 countries, airing throughout all major territories around the world. During its eleventh season, in 2012, it reached an average of 17.4 million viewers and its twelfth series launched “The fact that I have achieved so incredibly much is like a Cinderella story to me!” Kelly Clarkson, the most successful American Idol winner Kelly Clarkson sings the U.S. national anthem at the Super Bowl in Indianapolis Four of the winners: Alexander Klaws, Mark Medlock,Thomas Godoj and Luca Hänni (from top to bottom) A Decade of Success  The talent show Deutschland sucht den Superstar (“DSDS”) started in Germany the same year as American Idol launched in the U.S. Dieter Bohlen has been on the judges’ panel since the very beginning, first with Shona Fraser,Thomas Bug and Thomas M. Stein, and in the current tenth season with Bill and Tom Kaulitz from Tokio Hotel and Mateo from Culcha Candela. DSDS scored phenom- enal ratings –for example, 7 million watched the big DSDS finale, in which Tobias Regner was crowned the Superstar of 2006.The winners to date, by season, were: Alexander Klaws, Elli Erl,Tobias Regner, Mark Medlock,Thomas Godoj, Daniel Schuhmacher, Mehrzad Marashi, Pietro Lombardi and Luca Hänni. 19 High Ratings L’amour est dans le pré (“Love Is in the Field”) is having a suc- cessful run on M6, RTL Group’s flagship channel in France. More on this topic: www.m6.fr/emission-l_ amour_est_dans_le_pre L’amour est dans le pré: In the French incarnation of the TV franchise The Farmer Wants a Wife, dairy farmer Thierry Olive ends up marrying his beloved Annie. Presenter Karine Le Marchand (above) couldn’t attend the wedding, as she was busy filming new episodes of the enormously popular show I t was one of the most important weddings of the year 2012 in France, and Karine Le March- and – of all people – was unable to attend. Le Marchand, host of the French version of The FarmerWants aWife, had hoped to be a witness to the marriage of the good-natured dairy farmer Thierry Olive, and Annie, a dental assistant from a Paris suburb, at a September wedding in Olive’s hometown in Normandy, after the two had met on the show’s seventh hit season. It must have been the first time that the mayor of the small village of Ver, which has just 350 inhabitants, had to set up barriers in the street in order to keep control over the crowd of about 8,000 curious onlookers and a significant media presence, who came to celebrate the couple’s union. And Karine Le Marchand? She had a very convincing reason for only being able to congratulate them from afar: she was filming – preparing portraits of new farmers for the next season, so that more of them could find their own happiness over the next summer. The Farmer Wants a Wife – or, as it is called rather more romantically in France, L’amour est dans le pré (loosely translated as “Love Is in the Field”) – continues to score high ratings in the country. About six million television viewers watched the two-part retrospective of the sixth season, which was shown prior to the beginning of the seventh edition. With every new season, more French viewers tuned in. During the first season in 2006, M6 rejoiced over its record 3.5 million viewers; by late summer 2012, the epi- sode shown two days after Thierry and Annie’s wedding saw the number climb past 7 million. An average 6.4 million viewers followed the amorous developments that took place among the three women and eleven men from various rural areas and their suitors. L’amour est dans le pré repeatedly outperformed the public broad- caster France 2. Even the largest private French broadcaster, TF1, decided to change around its Monday evening programming – all in vain. Only the coverage of the London Olympics A L’amour est dans le pré In 2012, the French version of The Farmer Wants A Wife topped its time slot every single week, except for the one night it aired against the Olympics. It was the highest rated entertainment show on M6 for the year, and one of its stars has now found happiness like many others before him on the show Text: Andrea Freund\n\n11. 20 Shows was more popular than the farmers’ primetime courting activities. Perhaps, in these economically difficult times, post-modern France is fascinated by a longing for a simpler life – and certainly by the search for happiness with that special some- one. The magazine L’Express even wondered whether urbanites were in a sense “reconciling” with rural life, which is often much more dif- ficult but is also more grounded. Three-quarters of France’s population now lives in cities, while half of the country’s geographical area is still devoted to the production of grain and milk products, wine and champagne. The show touches people’s hearts, says Nicolas de Taver- nost, CEO and Chairman of the Management Board of Groupe M6, plus it presents agriculture “in a positive light.” Beautiful images from all over the country are depicted in the show, from Brittany in western France and Lorraine in the East of France, to Picardy in the north to the Pyrénées-Atlantique region near the southern- most stretch of the French Atlantic coast. So far, most of the candidates have come from there and from the Gironde region (which includes the city of Bordeaux) just a little further to the north. The previous season also featured an olive-oil producer from the island of Corsica. All in all, 71 poultry, cattle, goat and horse breeders, grape-growers, and dairy, grain and vegetable famers aged 24 to 60 have searched for love on L’amour est dans le pré to date. Each of them received letters from other singles before meet- ing with eight of the potential candidates at a speed-dating session in Paris and then inviting two of them to visit their rural home. So far 13 weddings, 37 relationships and 26 children have resulted from this highly popular television program. While not all the relationships formed onscreen have lasted, some participants have found true love through the show, which gives them the opportunity to get to know people they might never have otherwise met. This is certainly the case for Thierry, who comes from the backwaters of northern France and laugh- ingly calls himself a “country bumpkin.” He was filmed as he happily took the subway for the very first time in Paris, and his remarks have a cult following. He was the viewers’ favorite even prior to his wedding to Annie. Similar love stories abound worldwide and The Farmer Wants A Wife has gripped the imagination of people all around the globe. In the Netherlands, Boer Zoekt Vrouw (as the show is known locally) is watched by an incredible 35 percent of the population and has been the country’s high- est rated entertainment program since 1995. Including France, 29 countries have their own local versions of the format and over 100 series have aired internationally to date. In 2012 alone, farmers in Canada, Hungary and Latvia began their own search for love as new local versions of the show launched in their countries. And Thierry and Annie? After a romantic hon- eymoon in Senegal, they returned to France and spent their first Christmas together as a married couple. Annie is now living on Thierry’s farm, and they hope to start a family very soon. L’Amour est dans le pre enters its eighth season in France, with new farmers hoping to find romance, love and a partner to share their lives. As Thierry says, of his marriage to Annie: “It is the best gift I’ve ever received”. 2 Love in the German Countryside: The Hit Show Bauer sucht Frau  From an industrious Alpine pasture farmer to a taciturn Westphalian grower to an enterprising agriculturalist from the flatlands of Frisia –ever since the first season of Bauer sucht Frau ran in October of 2005, host Inka Bause has been bringing in all types in order to help farmers of both sexes find true love on TV. Fluttering hearts and happy endings – with up to 8 million viewers watching on TV. Happy loving couples: They send the show’s ratings sky-high. Like married couple Thierry and Annie (left), farmer Sylvain and Valerie (center) are also love-struck. Yoann and Emanu- elle (right) have even had a baby since they found each other.The rural dating show is so popular in France that about six million viewers watched the two-part retrospective of the sixth season alone 21 FremantleMedia As an innovative market pioneer, FremantleMedia, a subsidiary of RTL Group, develops, produces and markets outstand- ing entertainment brands and is among the most successful companies in the sector.

Books22 23 Virtuosos of the Word How a Random House bestseller is born: The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg. The path from initial idea to post-publication Text: Katja Guttmann. Photos: Jürgen Frank O ut on Broadway police sirens wail, traffic roars, an endless stream of people rush about. But once you walk through the revolving glass doors, into the tranquil atmosphere of Random House’s world head- quarters, all of that falls away. In the high-ceilinged lobby, it is impossible not to notice what matters here: books. Hundreds of paperbacks and hardcovers – winners of Nobel and Pulitzer prizes, brand-new publications and first-edition classics – fill the shelves, all the way up to the ceiling. And every day, the many occupants of this building work hard to ensure that future Random House titles will one day take up places of honor on these same shelves. The eleventh-floor office of Andy Ward, an Executive Editor in the Random House Publishing Group division, is small, A Books\n\n13. Books24 but a floor-to-ceiling window keeps it from feeling cramped. On three shiny gray shelves along one wall sit stacks of meticulously sorted manuscripts – the books on which he is cur- rently working. Each one is hand-labeled with the author’s name. “I have a huge amount of respect for the writing process, which is incred- ibly hard,” says Ward with a serious glance over his frameless glasses. He speaks thoughtfully, with concentration, occasionally displaying an impish smile. But behind his smile is an unwavering belief in his authors. He is known for his keen judgment and inexhaustible energy when working on their manuscripts, and for the obsessive attention to detail with which he drives projects forward. Inside the finished books he has edited, which are lined up next to his desktop computer, are glowing notes of gratitude from their authors: Andy Ward is a virtuoso of words. Charles Duhigg didn’t yet know any of this about Ward when they spoke for the first time, in the fall of 2009. Duhigg, an award-winning investigative business journalist for the New York Times, wanted to write his first book. The idea he was proposing, The Power of Habit, was to be an exploration of all the behaviors, good and bad, that we perform, every day, without thinking: Why do some people succeed with exercise routines, and thus manage to keep the weight off, while others don’t? Why are some companies so good at institutionalizing certain behaviors, while others never repeat the same process twice? Essentially, what are habits, and how do they work? Duhigg wrote an eighty-page proposal, and, together with his agent, went looking for a publisher. Ward was spending the day with his two daughters, when the respected literary agent Scott Moyers reached him. Moyers asked wheth- Author Charles Duhigg and his editor Andy Ward became friends while working on The Power of Habit Random House Inc., New York  The publishing group traces its roots to the C. Bertelsmann publishing house, founded in 1835 in Gütersloh, Germany. Currently, Random House Inc. includes 200 independent pub- lishing houses in 15 countries. In the U.S., Bertelsmann fully acquired paperback publisher Bantam Books in 1980, followed by its purchase of the Double- day publishing house in 1986, after which the U.S publishing company was known as Bantam Doubleday Dell. In 1998 Bertels- mann acquired the prestigious publisher Random House, and combined it with Bantam Doubleday Dell. And thus the new international publishing group Random House began. 25 “Back then I had no idea how important it was to choose the right editor” Charles Duhigg, Author A er Ward would like to take a look at Duhigg’s proposal. Although Ward was on vacation at his home just north of New York City, on the Hud- son River, he asked to see it immediately. Standing in his kitchen, as children romped around him, Ward began reading the proposal, and knew right away that it was good. Really good. Duhigg, he thought, had a talent for narra- tive storytelling and an ability to make complex ideas relatable. Above and beyond this, many potential readers would undoubtedly love to know how to get rid of bad habits in their work and personal lives. Ward jumped in. “Within a day I had the okay and I got on the phone with Scott and pre-empted it, that day, for Random House. It all happened so quickly,” says Ward. If several publishing houses are interested in a future manuscript, it is usually put forward for auction and sold to the highest bidder; “pre- empting” a proposal avoids all that, taking it off the market at a mutually agreed-upon price. By doing so, Random House was able to avoid a bidding war. “At the time, I really had no idea how impor- tant it was to choose the right editor. Andy just sounded like a nice guy,” says Duhigg about his first phone call with Ward, which lasted just fifteen minutes. When making his decision he relied on Moyers, his agent, who described Random House to him as a great and respected home for authors: At Random House, he said, there are decision-makers with the financial resources to publish books properly and to find them the right audience; they are professionals with real skills and experience – and, not to be overlooked, great enthusiasm. “I had no clue what that meant,” says Duhigg. “Today I know.” Charles Duhigg has bright blue eyes and a thick black beard. He likes to laugh, and laughs often, especially at his editor‘s dry sense of hu- mor. When the two of them sit at a conference room table and chat about Salman Rushdie’s new memoir, Jennifer Egan’s Twitter novella, or their families’ Christmas vacation plans, it’s as if nothing else exists around them. It’s clear at first glance that author and editor not only like one another, but have become close friends Charles Duhigg, Author, Brooklyn, New York  Charles Duhigg is originally from New Mexico, studied at Harvard and Yale, and has worked as an investigative journalist for the New York Times since 2006. In 2009 he was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize.The bestseller The Power of Habit is his first book. He is married, has two children and lives in Brooklyn (New York).

Books26 as well. “Charlie has a huge brain,” says Ward. “He is seemingly capable of everything.” “Andy is an incredible editor, but he’s also one of the most decent human beings I’ve ever met,” says Duhigg. (“This book is as much his as mine,” Duhigg wrote in the book’s acknowledgements.) It took two and half years, from that first phone call to the book’s publication in February 2012, for The Power of Habit to become a best- seller. (In the world of book publishing, this is considered fairly quick, for this type of editing- and-reporting-intensive project.) To speed things along, Duhigg took a year of leave from the Times, rented desk space near his Brooklyn apartment, and spent every day researching, outlining, and writing. The hardest part, he says, was finding his rhythm in the beginning. Holding the reader’s attention for 300 pages, he quickly learned, is very different from writing a relatively short newspaper or magazine article. “I think we worked on the first chapter for three months,” says Duhigg. “I had flown all over the country and conducted dozens of interviews, and Andy had edited it four or five times over. And in the end, we killed it completely.” Duhigg did, at the time, recognize the reasons the chapter had to be abandoned – the text was too personal, the subject not quite the right way to open the book. He is grateful to Ward for letting him recognize this and decide for himself to remove it, for that’s how he learned to build effective chapters that work. “Andy doesn’t lead through edict,” says Duhigg, describing the collaboration. “That’s not his style. He starts a conversation – and from this conversation come new ideas and assumptions.” “Editing is not a straightforward process. It’s not just one round of notes and we’re done,” says Ward, who prefers to work the traditional way, with pencil and paper. Duhigg would usually get the pages back covered with hand- written comments, edits, and suggestions. “Andy forces you to connect all your ideas. He forces you to use language that is as clear and as crisp as possible, and he forces you to find the Writing is not always a solitary activity–on the contrary, whenever Duhigg wrote a chapter at a sidewalk cafe (far left), it was never long until his next conversation with his edi- tor, Ward, during which they would reformulate passages or discuss the design for the book cover (above) “Andy forces you to connect all your ideas”Charles Duhigg, Author 27 best anecdotes and explanations,” says Duhigg. Even when Duhigg himself, on the verge of exhaustion, would have been content with 85 percent perfection, that was not good enough for his editor. “Being friends helps a great deal,” says Ward. Neither of them knows anymore how many pages, in the end, were revised multiple times and then thrown away. “It was a lot,” says Ward. Duhigg remembers two big black garbage bags sitting in his home office, filled with dis- carded pages from various drafts. Today, when Duhigg leafs through the pile of rejected drafts for the cover image of The Power of Habit, he has to laugh. One design, with circles and squares, looked to him like an intelligence test for preschoolers. Another, with a circle of arrows, like a company report from the 1980s. He is glad that Random House came up with an extremely clever visual, a striking red-and-yellow design in which a human figure is breaking out from inside a stylized hamster wheel and making playful use of the wheel. For him, it is simply the perfect metaphor for the book. Duhigg got the idea for this design during a trip to California, and the graphic artist Anton Ioukhnovets implemented it to perfection. “I have to think about a present for him,” says Duhigg. Andy Ward, Executive Editor at Random House, New York  Andy Ward began his career as an editor at Esquire and GQ magazines, rising to Executive Editor of the latter. He has been an editor at Random House since September 2009. He is married, has two children and lives in Dobbs Ferry (New York).

Books28 While Duhigg and Ward were still polish- ing the final version of The Power of Habit, the Random House marketing and publicity jug- gernaut was gathering steam. Months before the book was even finished, Sally Marvin and Maria Braeckel were busy stoking the curiosity of tra- ditional media, reaching out to television, radio, newspapers, and magazines. “We were already very excited about the manuscript, we just had to find the right pitch for all the different reader- ships: business audience, parents, consumers focused on lifestyle choices and nutrition,” says Braeckel. Erika Greber and her market- ing colleagues produced interactive content like animated videos and banner ads that they posted on YouTube and various social media sites. Duhigg launched his own website and a blog, and took a more active role in his Face- book page and Twitter profile. And the result of all this: “We were able to not only document the word of mouth that was happening online, but also gather valuable insights about who our readers are. It’s a good example of how quickly book marketing continues to evolve, and how we as a company are using these advantages more and more intensively,” says Greber. There were moments of nervousness, howev- er. “Shortly before our publication date on Feb- ruary 28, 2012, I became petrified that I would let down Andy, and I would let down Random House, which had invested so much in me and this book,” says Duhigg. But he didn’t have to hold his breath for long. In its influential Sunday Magazine, the New York Times featured an advance excerpt from the book as its cover story: it was culled from the book’s most provocative section, in which Duhigg describes how the Tar- get national retail chain is studying consumer habits in order to gain business advantages from its female customers when they are pregnant. Right after the excerpt was published, Random House received dozens of media inquiries, and the book took off. Duhigg spent much of the next two months giving interviews, enabling his book to debut at #4 on the bestseller list. In the U.S. alone, The Power of Habit so far has sold 300,000 copies in hardcover and e-book editions, and it remained on the New York Times national lists for thirty-one weeks. The success story continues internationally, as the rights have now been sold in 30 countries. One of his book’s happiest side effects is that he himself profited so personally from his re- search. Much to his wife’s delight, he lost several pounds because he consciously shed his bad habit of eating a chocolate cookie in the cafeteria every afternoon. For his break, he instead now chooses to chat a little with his colleagues before going back to work. Ward also admits to being more conscious of forming better habits since ed- iting the book. In the evening, for example, he lays out his running clothes so they are the first thing he sees the next morning. “The tip from the book really works!” Since then, he has been managing to go for a run three times a week before catching the train to Grand Central Station, he says. And because Duhigg would also like to make a good habit of his successful collaboration with his editor, he has already sold his next book idea to Random House; its working title is The Sci- ence of Productivity. As of yet, not a single word has been committed to paper. But Andy Ward and Charles Duhigg have already been talking up a storm about the project in their favorite Broadway coffee shop. 2 A perfect team, always in touch: Editor Andy Ward and author Charles Duhigg made The Power of Habit into a bestseller, with 300,000 copies sold in the U.S. alone “Since editing this book, I think more about my own habits” Andy Ward, Editor at Random House 29 Among its authors are John Grisham, Stephen King, E L James, and James Patterson, as well as Stefan Heym, Ernst Jandl, Richard David Precht, and Walter Kempowski; they also include Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, Dan Brown, Dean Koontz and Nigella Lawson, as well as Charlotte Link, Ian McEwan, Julia Navarro, Orhan Pamuk, Christopher Paolini, and Elizabeth George.

Photos: Arne Weychardt A nnabelle Yu Long, Thomas Mackenbrock and Pankaj Makkar are young, have impressive careers behind them, and big adventures ahead of them. As early as 2007, Long went to Beijing for Bertelsmann in order to run the China Corporate Center; in 2012, Thomas Mackenbrock and Pankaj Makkar also set out into the world – as heads of the Corporate Centers in Brazil and India. EXPERIENCE: The three of you represent Bertelsmann in the world’s growth markets. How did you, as young managers, get into these excit- ing positions? Ms. Long and Mr. Makkar, you graduated from the Ber- telsmann Entrepreneurs Program; maybe we can start there? PANKAJ MAKKAR: When I was working on my master’s at Harvard, I looked at companies that were involved in the growth markets. I noticed that many Western employers did not pay much at- A International\n\n17. 32 International tention to the specific local context; they simply wanted to transfer what they knew from their own countries. But at Bertelsmann I noticed right away that our entrepreneurial approaches were very similar. Plus, the Bertelsmann En- trepreneurs Program works in both directions. On the one hand, you get insights into Bertels- mann’s experience and expertise in all the dif- ferent regions of the world. On the other hand, the company is also very open to seeing what ideas the individual has, what local knowledge each person brings with him or her. ANNABELLE YU LONG: I agree with that, but I did not have as clear an idea as Pankaj when I start- ed the program. I had worked for a state-run TV station in China for many years, and when I was studying at Stanford I thought I would become a banker or consultant with my MBA, as most of my fellow students did. And then I came across Bertelsmann. During our first conversa- tions, I was already impressed by how much freedom the employees are granted in their work. This is my eighth year with the company, and the opportunities, the responsibility you are given early on, the trust that is placed in you as a young person, are truly wonderful. When I started in New York in 2005, we didn’t yet have a clear strategy for the new growth markets. Even “I am impressed by how much freedom the employees are granted in their work” Annabelle Yu Long, China Corporate Center On their way to the top Corporate Center Chief Executives (from left) Thomas Mackenbrock (Brazil), Pankaj Makkar (India) and Annabelle Yu Long (China) Corporate Centers  In its bid to enter growth markets around the world, Ber- telsmann is counting on people who recognize trends, supervise projects and pursue entrepre- neurial goals. So in addition to its headquarters in Gütersloh and its branches in Berlin and Brussels, the company has Corporate Centers in New York, Beijing, New Delhi and São Paulo (the latter two newly opened). 33 though we already employed over 1,000 people in China, the emphasis was on the book market, and the activities were not as focused as they are today. I was with BDMI (the “Bertelsmann Digital Media Investments” investment fund) in New York and so was intensively involved with digital media. A project that we did together with McKinsey took me back to China, at first just for short periods of time. Then, in 2007 I took over the Corporate Center in Beijing, which we had opened the year before. Mr. Mackenbrock, what took you from Gütersloh to São Paulo? THOMAS MACKENBROCK: I came to Bertelsmann in 2006 and worked on corporate development in Gütersloh. Prior to that I worked with McKin- sey, in the telecommunications, media and high tech area. In early 2011, I was in Brazil for a project, and I fell in love with the country right away. That fit well, because we had already set up Corporate Centers in China and India, yet there was still one gap: Latin America. At first glance, we thought that there were several barriers to entry: the dominance of local media groups and the limitations for foreign owners did not seem very promising. But then when we saw how successfully Annabelle was working in China, how she went in new directions by part- nering with other investors and addressing the digital media space, we began to rethink our ap- proach to Latin America as well. And it became clear that with a flexible investment approach and a focus on new growth areas like education and digital media, a wide range of attractive op- portunities awaited us. ANNABELLE YU LONG: When I arrived in Beijing at the time, the “big potential” was no more than a working hypothesis for us. With the knowledge I had acquired at BDMI in New York, I was of course very focused on digital media and was looking for opportunities in this area. And so I started talking to more and more colleagues, and the idea of starting a fund grew. That’s how BAI, Bertelsmann Asia Investments, was born in 2008. Why has digital media changed the situation so much? Can you explain that more concretely? THOMAS MACKENBROCK: Each geography has its own set of regulations. But generally speaking, digital media is often less restricted for foreign ownership than traditional media, especially in markets like China or Brazil. We can invest relatively freely in Internet assets. And in fact, sometimes we can’t even invest as much as we want to… ANNABELLE YU LONG: … because successful companies grow so quickly that their owners or founders just aren’t interested in selling. THOMAS MACKENBROCK: So you have to be more creative with regard to minority investments or possible partnerships. And when you look at what Annabelle and Pankaj have achieved, it becomes clear that you need a number of dif- ferent instruments. We had to find new ways for Bertelsmann to be involved in these markets. PANKAJ MAKKAR: In India the situation is a little different. It is certainly possible for foreign com- panies to own businesses there; Sony and News- corp have shown us that. But the fact is that there are a lot of companies active in traditional media. We are getting into the market with manageable building-blocks and can continue to expand from here on out. THOMAS MACKENBROCK: That helps limit the risk. Can you give some examples? THOMAS MACKENBROCK: In all three countries, we have a set of different approaches. One possibil- ity is to invest in a local fund to acquire exper- tise, a network and co-investment possibilities. There is limited risk, and it’s a great way to get established, to build a foundation. Then we also look for direct investments. This can result in very interesting portfolios. Let’s just look at what Annabelle has built up over the last years. The spectrum of companies in her portfolio ranges from small startups to Chinese firms that are listed on the New York Stock Exchange. PANKAJ MAKKAR: Above all, we need to be able to assess risks and try to minimize them as A “Most Chinese people have heard of Bertelsmann” Annabelle Yu Long has run Bertelsmann’s Corporate Center in Beijing since September of 2009 Corporate Center Beijing, China  With 1.34 billion peo- ple, China is the most populous country on Earth. Already in 1992, Bertels- mann set up its first subsidiaries there. By now, all the Group’s units are active there: FremantleMedia (RTL Group) brought TV shows like China’s Got Talent, X Factor, Hole in the Wall or Take Me Out to the Chinese market. Random House sells international bestsellers there and sells translation rights to Chinese publishers. Gruner + Jahr, with its partner Boda, publishes leading parenting, women’s, men’s and lifestyle magazines. And Arvato, the largest Bertelsmann unit in China, has a logistics net- work that spans the country, and partners with major international and Chinese corporations.The BAI investment fund was founded in 2008 and has 20 holdings.\n\n18. 34 International much as possible. Growth markets are always risky, especially for protagonists who are new to the market. Joint ventures with local partners are another tool. The partner brings the local expertise, is familiar with consumer behavior in that country, and knows, for example, how TV shows should be designed. We, Bertelsmann, then deliver the content. That is exactly what we did in India with our RTL joint venture, the first of its kind. Our adventure channel, Thrill, has been on the air since November 2012. What role does the Internet play in your respec- tive countries? What specific opportunities does it offer? THOMAS MACKENBROCK: Brazil is behind China in terms of development, but right now the Internet in Brazil is taking off at an incredible pace. Nowadays, nearly half the population has access to the Web, and the number is ris- ing. Many companies are still in their infancy. One interesting observation: Brazilians are crazy about social media. In fact, Brazil has just surpassed India in terms of Facebook user numbers and now is second only to the United States. It’s a very exciting time here. We are right where China was five years ago, and the next wave is building momentum. PANKAJ MAKKAR: In India the situation is similar to that in Brazil. The Internet is booming. But it’s happening via mobile devices, not via com- puters. Cell phones are ten times as common as computers. From the consumer perspective, this means new routes to information and en- tertainment. Even people living in villages can get connected now. It is a revolution that af- fects the entire country. It’s a great time for us to be involved. If we succeed in setting things up right, we can really leave deep tracks here. What does the fact that Bertelsmann is a European or German company mean in your countries? PANKAJ MAKKAR: I think that in India Bertels- mann is perceived not just as a big international company, but also, in particular, as a family business. That is very significant for our part- ners in India, because their values and way of thinking are similar. THOMAS MACKENBROCK: In Brazil most of our partner companies are owned by families. They speak the same language as Bertelsmann: long- term orientation and strong corporate culture. It should also be noted that these families often have a European background. In some cases, discussions involve partners whose grandfather or great-grandfather immigrated from Europe. This emotional connection usually makes things easier. ANNABELLE YU LONG: In China things are some- what different. In my country, people generally have a high opinion of European countries. That is especially true for Germany; quality and discipline are things we value highly. Most Chi- nese people have heard the name Bertelsmann; we are one of the first Western companies that entered the market here in the early nineties. How often do you three share information? How closely do you work together? ANNABELLE YU LONG: We communicate con- stantly. On the phone, via video conference, via e-mail, or we meet in person. THOMAS MACKENBROCK: Thanks to various projects in which we have been involved, we three really know one another well. I worked with Pankaj three years ago in New York; I was in China with Annabelle in 2007. It’s really a wonderful situation. Even though we are now all in different regions of the world, we have a solid personal connection. PANKAJ MAKKAR: Specifically, that means we all know we can pick up the phone anytime to say, “This is what’s happening here. Do you see a similar development there? Do you know some- one I could get in touch with?” And we visit each other’s countries, which is also very helpful. The Corporate Center in China opened in 2006, followed by the Centers in India, then Brazil, in 2012. How have you been able to benefit from one another? “If we succeed in setting things up right,we can really leave deep tracks there” Pankaj Makkar has run Bertelsmann’s Corporate Center in New Delhi since February of 2012 Corporate Center New Delhi, India  India, with over 1.2 billion inhabitants, is the world’s second- most populous country and is considered the world’s largest democracy. At the opening of the new Corporate Center in February 2012,Thomas Rabe, Bertelsmann Chairman and CEO, stated, “India is an important market for our international growth.The country’s demographic, economic and technological development offers a future-oriented company like Bertelsmann many opportunities.” All of Bertelsmann’s corporate units were already present in India prior to the opening:The RTL Group started two TV stations there with a national partner; FremantleMedia is involved with hit shows like Indian Idol, X Factor, and Got Talent; Random House India has been publishing books there since 2005. In 2011 Gruner + Jahr took over a majority share in the Indian magazine publisher Maxposure. And Arvato India has been working in the Customer & Marketing Services unit as well as in e-commerce since 2003. All the corporate units will expand their business in India significantly in the coming years. 35 PANKAJ MAKKAR: It starts with asking about employees: how many do you need? And then it moves to logistical challenges. And then to what types of projects make sense. What can you do to build up a brand as fast as possible? How much do we want to promise? That’s a tricky question – if you pledge too much, things can get difficult, but if the targets are too low, the brand won’t develop well. China really was the test vehicle for all these questions, and An- nabelle did an amazing job. When I started my Center, I got a lot of help from Annabelle. I was really lucky that she was able to come to India for this purpose. THOMAS MACKENBROCK: And then, it’s not just a learning process for us. It’s a whole new journey “We are now present with our own offices in all the growth regions” Thomas Mackenbrock, Brazil Corporate Center “Bertelsmann has set out on a global journey” Thomas Mackenbrock has run Bertelsmann’s Corporate Center in São Paulo since January of 2012 Corporate Center São Paulo, Brazil  Brazil, with over 192 million inhabitants and an area of 8.5 million square kilometer, is the world’s fifth-largest nation and South America’s most populous country. Bertelsmann had already been represented in South Ame- rica for quite some time prior to opening its own Corporate Center there in June of 2012. Among the shows marketed there by FremantleMedia were hits like Idol and The Apprentice. The Random House book publishing subsidiary is represented in Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Colombia and Uruguay. Three automotive magazine branches in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil as well as G y J Televisia in Mexico belong to Gruner + Jahr. In South America, Arvato works in the areas of distribution services, service centers and print. Overall, Bertelsmann has about 3,000 em- ployees in South America.The goal is to build on that in the future, as Thomas Rabe explained at the official opening of the Center: “It is important to be represented with a central anchor.The new Corporate Center will help us further develop our existing activities in this region and to build up new businesses – for example in the areas of educa- tion and digital media.” for Gütersloh as well. After all, a lot more is at stake than just establishing a Corporate Center in a particular location. Bertelsmann has set out on a global journey. Links of a chain are being joined together. We are now present with our own offices in all the growth regions. ANNABELLE YU LONG: And this development is based on a trim, flexible strategy. It’s very efficient. We can move quickly. I think we are really well positioned. I don’t see any other media company that is as well posi- tioned for a globally based digital regional strategy. 2\n\n19. 36 Magazines 37 I read because ...

In the late 1960s, Gruner sold his shares; Jahr and Bucerius each held 37.5 percent. The publisher Reinhard Mohn bought a 25-percent stake. By 1975, Mohn’s media group, Bertelsmann, had acquired 74.9 percent of the shares. Only one of the founders remained a shareholder –the Jahr publishing family.

A bold business venture? A start-up for the future? Young, innovative companies in the digital media field have a strong partner at their side in Bertelsmann Text: Anna Butterbrod.

Leventon from South Africa writes: “Hi, I’m new here. Looking forward to meeting you all!” The fact that these five people from the farthest- flung corners of the world interact with each other is due to two people from Cologne: Christian R. Schulte (40) and Cornelius Rost (37), who founded the online network qeep in 2006. Two years earlier, Facebook had revolutionized everyday life on the Internet, and they both anticipated that the mobile Internet would soon have an equally far-reaching effect. The two business economist friends added an application for their own amuse- ment – computer games. And with that a business idea was born: a mobile community where you can meet people and play games with them. A Digital\n\n25. Digital48 Schulte and Rost missed being their own boss. They had both already successfully founded and sold businesses, but were working full-time for other companies when they came up with the idea of qeep in 2005: Schulte was working at T-Mobile, Rost at Nintendo. “In large corporations, strategies and structure often eat up a lot of time, which results in momentum being lost,” says Schulte. “Being self-employed always appealed to us because good and bad decisions have a direct impact.” Rost was the first to quit his day job, and de- veloped qeep from a desk at a friend’s company. When Schulte followed suit, they moved into an office and finally, in 2007, into a 330m2 loft in a trendy office building in the Kalk district of Cologne. It looks like one of the cool open-plan offices you see on American TV: The walls are painted mint green, bicycles are parked next to a pink beanbag, and photos are tacked up on a magnetic wall, including one of a city run that “team qeep” took part in. The smell of chicken being fried for lunch by one of the company’s 18 employees comes from the kitchen. The rest are ordering pizza as today is Tuesday and the Ital- ian restaurant around the corner has a special offer.

Schulte founded qeep in 2006, they had nothing except an idea: transferring skill gaming and friend networks from the Internet to cell phones. After starting small, they now occupy a 330m2 office loft in the Kalk district of Cologne. qeep currently has more than 17 million members. Rost and Schulte employ 18 people aged between 20 and 40 years who have just as much fun with their work as the members do with computer games and mobile networks. The idea behind qeep is simple:To use the service, all you need is an Internet-ready cell phone–download the free software onto the device, set up a profile, and get started right away! ing racy photos that members try to upload to their profiles. The cleanup is necessary, or qeep would soon turn into an erotic portal. “In the beginning it was strange,” she says. “But now I don’t even notice that I’m looking at naked peo- ple.” At the next desk, product developer Guido Frohn (39) and Bjorn Fietz (32), a freelance writer, are talking shop. Actually Fietz is a labor and social rights lawyer, but writes screenplays for qeep adventure games as a sideline. Just now they’re discussing the new “Area 8”, where participants have to fight aliens in a destroyed city. “My job as a lawyer is very matter-of-fact; as a writer I can be creative,” he says. “It’s a nice balance.” Most of the team are between 20 and 40 years old, in other words close to the target 18 to 24 age group. Each employee receives a company cell phone. Many of them have three mobiles on the table – for gaming, trying things out, and making private calls. Everything looks stylish and clean, but it’s done on a budget. The large gray plant tubs came from a Lufthansa clear- ance sale; the desks and chairs were bought sec- ond-hand from other companies. Rather than have snacks delivered from expensive third-par- ty suppliers, the team stock a shelf themselves and keep a running tab of what people have to pay. Wherever possible, unnecessary extra costs are saved – possibly the most important lesson for a start-up. Shortly after qeep launched, each new client was celebrated as a sensation and cheers echoed through the loft. “Even if only one user per day was online, we gave it our all,” says Guido Frohn and laughs, recalling the days when the network consisted almost entirely of qeep employees. “We had to play and chat like mad so that customers didn’t feel like they were in an empty disco.” qeep thrives on diversity. “We are doomed to grow, as it were,” says founder Cornelius Rost. And the qeep community is indeed growing: It now has 17 million mem- bers, and success has become the norm. Serene calm prevails in the XXL office. All you can hear is the steady tap of computer keyboards – and a crunching sound: While Huu Ha Le (29) programs a new game on a screen, he nibbles breakfast cereal from a porcelain bowl. Behind the native Vietnamese is a poster of the sexy pop singer Shakira – a source of inspiration that Huu is denied from his regular sitting position. Meanwhile, Bernd, who sits opposite him, has an ideal view. Is he the secret Shakira fan who put the picture up? The programmer smiles and says nothing. One of the network’s most popular games is “Friend Zoo” in which your friends become A\n\n26. 50 Digital pets that you sell to other players. Each sale increases the value of the animal. The network’s currency is q-points. Customers can buy q- points (1,000 units cost $1) to use as stakes for games. This is how qeep makes 80 percent of its revenues. The remaining 20 percent comes from advertising. qeep employees are particularly in demand as pets because it’s as though you were friends with Mark Zuckerberg himself. Virtual gifts, which appear as small pictures at the top of the recipient’s profile, are also on offer. A $5 diamond ring is the most sought- after. Several times a day the $100 Infinity Diamond is also ordered. Neither of the two directors expected such a high-priced, purely virtual gift to sell so well. “You can’t test mem- bers’ reactions in advance – we have to rely on our gut instincts,” says Schulte. In the case of the Infinity Diamond it was a good one - 1,122 users have bought one since its introduction two years ago. “But you shouldn’t try to overdo things,” says Schulte. “Otherwise you can ruin things pretty quickly.” And that would be fatal, especially now that things are going so well. Every month qeep adds another 500,000 new customers, and the company will soon be turning a profit. It has only been able to keep going financially thanks to its sponsors, one of which is Bertelsmann Digital Media Investments. “They not only bring “We want people to feel virtually at home here“ Cornelius Rost, qeep Managing Director Cornelius Rost: Managing Director  Cornelius Rost studied Business Administration at the Beisheim School of Management (WHU) in Vallendar, the Ecole Supérieure de Commerce de Toulouse and the University of Western Australia. From 1999 to 2001 he established the Internet communities amiro and ciao as Founder and Marketing Director. From 2002 to 2006 he was European Brand Manager at Nintendo for Game Boy Ad- vance and Nintendo DS. He is married and has two daughters (aged 2 and 4). 51 money to the table, but also know-how and a network that has opened quite a few doors for us,” says Schulte. Bertelsmann owns shares in qeep, so important steps are coordinated beforehand. “What’s special about Bertelsmann is that we were assigned a kind of ‘uncle’ who knows the industry well and helps us out when we have questions.” Schulte and Rost presented their concept to Bertelsmann at the end of 2006 and were given the nod three months later. This For qeep employees, the digital challenge lies primarily in their own enjoyment of playing the games. They invented almost all of the games offered The BDMI investment Skimlinks, which helps website publishers to monetize their content, increased its revenues by more than 80 percent and scored more than three billion page views in December 2012 alone. Many of the Bertelsmann Digital Media Investments fund’s holdings are on an expansion- ist course. One example: in 2012, the shopping portal Mogujie expanded its leadership in the social e-commerce sector, increased its reach by 200 per- cent, and enabled transactions worth $30 million per month. More:→ www.bdmifund.com Discover opportunities Believing in the future also means investing in new ideas and innovations.This is what Bertelsmann Digital Media Investments (BDMI) puts into practice came as a big relief to the start-up directors. “You can’t fund this kind of company yourself indefinitely. Especially not if you want to suc- ceed globally,” says Rost. To keep revenues on the rise, qeep must constantly come up with new incentives. First it was “Sound Attacks” - loud noises that you can send to friends, that their cell phone will play to them. Attacks range from a high-pitched “happy birthday” to rude bodily sounds. Since last year, members can earn “badges” if, for example, they upload photos three days in a row or log in ten days in a row. While Nina Lentzen checks the work done by a photo administrator from Bangladesh, she and computer scientist Michael Landen (31), seated next to her, cultivate good customer relations, patiently answering questions and solving problems. They often get thank-you emails, some with wedding photos of couples who have met through the network. “qeep is more than a tool,” says Rost. “We want people to feel virtually at home here. We make it cozy for them.” This leads to very real friendships, such as the one between Cornelius Rost and Irfan Khan Afridi, 33, a mechanic from Pakistan. They bumped into each other online and have exchanged ideas on a regular basis since then. Recently, a package arrived at Rost’s desk from Irfan containing gifts and Pakistani trail mix - the perfect comfort food for the next chapter in the company’s history... 2 Christian R.
