In person: screenwriter and author Peter S. Beagle and producer Michael Chase Walker.

The producing and directing duo of Arthur Rankin, Jr., and Jules Bass, best-known for their beloved stop-motion holiday specials, helms a spellbinding adaptation of the beloved 1968 novel The Last Unicorn, adapted for the screen by author Peter S. Beagle himself.

On discovering that she may well be the last of her immortal kind, the Unicorn sets out on a long journey to discover what may have become of the other unicorns. On the way, she encounters a genuinely wicked witch and a village with a shameful secret. She also befriends a bumbling wizard and a bitter, disillusioned outlaw named Molly Grue, meets the mad King Haggard, and, at the last, must challenge the terrible Red Bull she so deeply fears to face.

Animated by some of the same team who would go on to work with Hayao Miyazaki at Studio Ghibli, The Last Unicorn is a jewel of a film that has been treasured for generations.
