        "text": "$5 tickets for kids under 18, redeemable at box office only.\n\nAfter learning from a talking butterfly that she may be the last of her kind, a brave young unicorn journeys to find out what happened to the others with the help of a middling magician. The unicorn encounters an evil witch and the Red Bull on her journey and is transformed into a young maiden to conceal her identity. This animated feature was one of the first to draw on top talent of the day for character voicing including Jeff Bridges, Mia Farrow, Alan Arkin, and Angela Lansbury. The film was directed by the duo of Arthur Rankin, Jr. and Jules Bass who were famous for televised stop motion Christmas specials like Frosty the Snowman, and their animated adaptations of J.R.R Tolkien’s works. The film’s soundtrack is performed by the classic rock band, America."
