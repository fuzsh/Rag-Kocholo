Masks are required and must be worn, even when seated, and when interacting with staff. We will also check your temperature upon arrival. With the current 50% capacity regulation in place, seating will be limited, and we encourage purchasing tickets online in advance to minimize contact. Thank you for helping everyone stay safe, and for helping us stay open!\n\nIn this animated musical, the villainous King Haggard (Christopher Lee) plots to destroy all the world’s unicorns. When a young unicorn (Mia Farrow) learns that she’s in danger and that she may soon be the last of her kind, she leaves the safety of her protected forest and enlists the help of Schmendrick (Alan Arkin), a gentle, albeit clumsy, sorcerer. Together, they embark on a long and dangerous journey with one goal: to defeat Haggard and save the unicorns from extinction."
