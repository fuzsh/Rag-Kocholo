Now, does it bother anyone else that Family Home Entertainment is marketing \"Frosty Returns\" as the sequel to \"Frosty the Snowman?\" That is so WRONG. The true sequel to \"Frosty the Snowman\" is \"Frosty's Winter Wonderland.\" \"Frosty Returns\" is an inferior story, has inferior songs, and inferior drawings. They look like mutated Peanuts cartoons. Obviously, \"Frosty Returns\" is NOT a Rankin/Bass Production.

I watch them year after year and I plan on introducing them to my children. I have two questions. What's the name of the special featuring Snow Miser and Heat Miser? I haven't seen that show for years. Also, is it possible to find lyrics somewhere, particularly for \"Put One Foot In Front of the Other\"? I'm hearing impaired and it's frustrating to not be able to fully enjoy the songs. Thanks and have a Shiny New Year!\n\nName:Rick Goldschmidt\n\nTo answer the Billie Mae Richards questions.... Location: Palos Hills, IL U.S.A.\n\nDate: Monday, December 27, 1999 at 21:43:38\n\nComments:\n\nGood Question...Where is Billie Mae Richards? Billie is alive and well in Ontario, Canada. She prefers not to talk about her RANKIN/BASS days as RUDOLPH and other characters. Why? Another good question. I have made repeated attempts to contact and help her out financially BUT her agent says she can't bare to look at the glow of RUDOLPH'S red-nose any longer. Apparently, she feels she should have gotten some of the risiduals from the many re-airings of the special BUT the fact of the matter is that all the Canadian actors who voiced the characters in RUDOLPH received a buyout for their work on the Special. Their union was very agreeable to this contract and that is why they were used in the first place. They were paid for the first three airings of the special and that was it. This was the common practice of the day. This was the way the GILLIGAN'S ISLAND cast was paid, BATMAN, etc. etc. No one had any idea how long these things would last and that includes Arthur Rankin, Jr. and Jules Bass. It's unfortunate that the one thing that Billie Mae will be remembered for is not cheerished and enjoyed by the actress. I HAVE TRIED! Not only did she voice RUDOLPH beautifully; She also voiced Willie McBean, Bobby Bond, Countless kids on FESTIVAL OF FAMILY CLASSICS and more for RANKIN/BASS! The same thing happened with Fred Gwynne and his character of Herman Munster (although it wasn't a money issue with him; it was a typecast issue). Maybe if she hears from some of her many fans, that might persuade her to do interviews. You can write her c/o C.O.R.E. GROUP, 3 Church Street, Suite 507, Toronto, Canada M5E1M2. Tell her Rick sent you!

I look forward to it every year. Also: Whatever happened to Billie Mae Richards? I know she did some Care Bear movies, but where is she now, if she's still alive? I sing and play guitar for a punk-rock band at home in Michigan, and we wrote a song about her. It's called \"Who's That Chick with the Throaty Voice\". Keep up the good work on this website!

I was soooo happy to find out about this fabulous website!!! Thanks to Rick and the Rankin-Bass folks, there's a website dedicated to these great shows!! I have seen the shows on TV since I was a tot. Since then, I've enjoyed their annual return year after year. I have always been interested in the voice actors who lent their marvelous talents to the creation of the characters we've all known and loved. Is there any hopes of getting an interview with Billie Mae Richards who voiced Rudolph? Are Paul Frees and Jackie Vernon (who voiced Frosty) still around? How about Shelly Winters who voiced Crystal? An interview with some of these actors would be a very nice addition to your great site!! Another idea: Is there any possibility of selling a few animation cels from the shows to the fans? Keep up the good work Rick!! Sincerely, Cathy Rivera\n\nName:Mindy\n\nLocation: Springfield, VA USA\n\nDate: Monday, December 27, 1999 at 03:30:03\n\nComments:\n\nHello everyone!!

Rankin-Bass was as much a part of my childhood as watching Three Stooges shorts, and just as timeless. With all the garbage currently on Tv these days, it is so refreshing to see these great Xmas classics over and over again. That Rankin-Bass holiday specials continue to outperform their competitors in the ratings is a reminder that quality still counts for some-thing. I thoroughly enjoyed the tribute you gave Romeo Muller, the gifted writer who vested so much heart into these timeless treasures. I was quite surprised to find out that he was born on the same day (8/7/28) as my father. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to buy Rick Goldschmidt's book yet, but I hope to eventually. Once again, thank you for having a great website, and for Arthur Rankin and Jules Bass, thanks for the memories. May your shows run forever.\n\nName: Rick Goldschmidt\n\nLocation: Palos Hills, IL U.S.A.\n\nDate: Friday, December 24, 1999 at 18:34:59\n\nComments:\n\nFirst of all, I want to wish everyone a Merry, White, Holly Jolly RANKIN/BASS Christmas! We have enjoyed bringing you this RANKIN/BASS website for the past few months and are glad that everyone is enjoying it! We are sorry that the Christmas pages are only half finished this Christmas Eve BUT we did our best to try to get them done. Perhaps, we'll have a few surprises before the end of the month! I have been told that Santa Claus has presented many copies of my book for Christmas presents this year and for this I want to THANK YOU! Our website is an extension of my book and we try not to repeat things that you already have in my book like Synopsis, Credit listings, airdates, many photos, etc. If you are trying to locate a title for a paticular R/B show or just can't place a character with a show you have seen in the past......PLEASE buy the book! My book was assembled with Arthur Rankin, Jr. and Jules Bass and we included all the information we could in the book! Unfortunately (or Fortunately depending how you look at it), our Hardcover edition is sold out BUT the softcover version at $18.95 is still available. Our website will SPOTLIGHT more of the individual talents who worked on the shows in the coming months! This month we SPOTLIGHT the wonderful talent of Romeo Muller! We look forward to hearing any constructive and intelligent comments you might have on our site! I want to wish everyone a Holly Jolly Christmas and a Shiny New Year!

Now I sit with all my grandchildren and watch them over and over and watch the same joy and happiness on their faces as my mother watched on mine. How wonderful they are. I collect all the beanies and stuffins etc. of all of them. They are great. My Granchildren go crazy watching the stories on TV and seeing each character in person. They can really relate to the story and each individual character and they have grown to love them all. Thank you SOOOO much R/B for coming up with all your wonderful stories. Christmas would not be the same if they didn't exist!! Thank you again, Janice\n\nName: William M.

I'm guessing it was someplace like Hyperborea (the Northern Paradise), and there was an old man in a white robe with antlers on his head. There were goblins and dragons amongst other things, and Santa's sleigh was big and blocky. Does anyone remember the name of this cartoon? I've been looking for it for years and would like to find it. -Thanks for the help.\n\nName: Harolde Woodman\n\nDate: Friday, December 17, 1999 at 04:58:01\n\nComments:\n\nWhen are the specials coming out on DVD?\n\nName: Lee Bach\n\nLocation: Leetonia, OhioDate: Thursday, December 16, 1999 at 11:38:41\n\nComments:\n\nExcellent R/B site!

I grew up with all of these Xmas specials and even now set aside time to watch them as often as possible during the holiday season. I can't even pick a favorite, because they are all so wonderful. I do, however, have one question that has haunted me for years. What is wrong with the little doll on the \"Land of Misfit Toys\"?

My wife and I are both baby boomers who grew up watching all the Rankin/Bass specials over the years. We were especially excited to see the misfit toys that cvs released this and last year. I remember watching those specials as a child and thinking how neat it would be to have a real misfit toy in my hands. Then with my wifes encouragement, we bought the whole collection. were hoping someday that other Rankin/Bass specials are released as ornmanents or something to the like to pass on to our children.\n\nName: Tiffany\n\nNY USA\n\nDate: Monday, December 13, 1999 at 11:33:55\n\nComments:\n\nHi.

I have never won anything in my life and this was better than winning the lottery. I received it the other day and immediately jumped to the \"Christmas Carol\" sung by Fred Astaire. It instantly brought a tear to my eye. I have always loved that song and it is my favorite scene from all the Rankin Bass specials. What a wonderful wedding that would truly be. Thank you all so much again for putting together such a wonderful tribute and keep up the great work with the website and all. I will continue to support your efforts in any way I possibly can. \"Merry Christmas\" and a very \"Happy, Healthy New Year\" to all.

For the past 20 years I have been looking for a record that my parents played EVERY Christmas Eve for my own children!!!!! Where is a copy of the story \"Island of Mifits\" or \"Christmas Rudolph almost missed\" It was a record with the original Rudolph story, Blue cover with Santa and Rudolph on the front, and the story was about a boy and a girl on the island of misfits. Their father had a circus but it was failing because of a cat who barked like a dog, a dog who meowed like a cat, etc. All Misfits. I laid and listened to it and it made me always be sure to love everyone and know that even if they didn't seem to fit in like we thought they should - everyone needs love and to not be left out. I would give anything to be able to find this recording!!! Can you help me!!!!! I really think it should be made into a movie like Rudolph - the moral story is so appropriate this day and time!!!! Great message to kids that Rudolph - looked for the best, wanted to help everyone, went out of his way to help, etc. Santa received a letter from the children trying to help their dad, etc. PLEASE HELP ME!!!!!\n\nName: Matt\n\nLocation: Australia\n\nDate: Friday, December 10, 1999 at 04:43:52\n\nComments:\n\nGreat site, if anyone know's of any R/B merchandise available in Australia, please let me know.

We have been so busy filling orders, doing interviews and working on various RANKIN/BASS related projects that we have been unable to get things up as quickly as we would like! Look for an article on Romeo Muller and for our Christmas pages to start going up this weekend! LOTS OF VERY GOOD NEWS.....The R/B RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER rated extremely high during the first week of December! It was the second most watched show of the entire week. Many other specials aired the very same week including A CHARLIE BROWN CHRISTMAS but none were close. In fact, many Christmas TV SPECIAL polls were taken this week by morning shows (CBS MORNING, KATHY & REGIS, etc.) and RUDOLPH was #1 in every viewer poll that I am aware of. The next time a critic rates the \"BEST ALL-TIME HOLIDAY SPECIALS,\" they should take a look at the ratings before they rank the #1 spot. Enough said! Mark Sykora and I will be featured on CLTV NEWS again sometime around the 16th or 17th. They will be sending a crew out to my studio to also shoot my collection. In addition to the segment being featured on the NEWS, it will also be included in a show called \"AROUND CHICAGO.\" Check your local listings. CLTV NEWS is the Chicago Tribune's 24 hour NEWS station and is basically available exclusive to what is now AT&T's cable service. There were some recent discoveries made in the VIDEOCRAFT archives and some RARE promos have been found on 35 mm IPM including one from MAD MONSTER PARTY and RUDOLPH. They will definitely be a part of future RANKIN/BASS clollector's DVD releases! The TAMPA TRIBUNE has recently done a RANKIN/BASS article featuring interviews with myself and Arthur Rankin. The KANSAS CITY STAR also did a wonderful piece on RUDOLPH/GRINCH/CHARLIE BROWN written by Aaron Barnhart. THANKS Aaron! WGN MORNING NEWS will once again be featuring our website on a segment called \"SURFIN' THE WEB\" sometime before Christmas. A few of the requests we have received for the AUTOGRAPHED (by Paul Coker, Jr.) MISER BROTHERS postcard have been slightly delayed. We are waiting for Paul to sign some more up for us and we should have them all out soon! Certainly before Christmas...probably in the next few days. There have been alot of e-mails about the Misfit Girl Doll, HERMEY and the 'ANIMAGIC' puppets, PLEASE read my previois MAIL page messages. I am more than happy to resolve these office bets BUT I am starting to hear these questions in my sleep. I am meeting with ENESCO very soon once again to discuss some exciting RANKIN/BASS figurine plans. If you haven't found their current line yet. I have seen them in OSCO DRUG stores lately. Look for them displayed out of the box in their figurine snow displays....they may be mixed in with other types of statues. OSCO takes them out of the boxes and sticky tags them right on the bottom. I have heard reports of the RUDOLPH ENESCO line at many of their stores. Well, lots of exciting RANKIN/BASS projects on the horizon! We will try to keep you up to date as best we can. In the meantime, don't hesitate to e-mail us with your questions/comments. We want to wish you a warm and safe Holiday season!

It just isn't Christmas without them. I was so glad when CBS rebroadcast \"the year without Santa Claus\" for years I remembered the Heat miser - Snow miser songs and people thought I had imagined them! Last year I got the last laugh. I agree with the website though - I wish Family channel didn't cut so many songs, I had forgetten about \"Fame and Fortune\" until I visted this site.

Chávez\n\nLocation: Kowloon, Hong Kong\n\nDate: Tuesday, December 7, 1999 at 11:54:23\n\nComments:\n\nI'm not sure anymore, but I think I first saw \"Rudolph\" when I was six or seven, and it was the Spanish version (except for the songs), back when I was growing up in El Salvador, of all places. They showed it every year. At first, it was only shown in black and white, but when color TV came, wow! It just wasn't Christmas without another showing of \"Rudolph\", and I'm talking about a country where it doesn't snow, so definitely no snowmen or reindeer either. Later, during my college years in the States, I would watch \"Rudolph\" on TV every holiday season, because it became a tradition and for nostalgic reasons. Christmas always seems more memorable when you're really young. Now, I live in Asia and unfortunately it isn't shown here. I missed it so much I bought the video a few years ago and now I can continue my annual holiday tradition. Thanks, Rankin and Bass, Christmas will always be special because of you and your magical creations!\n\nName:Paul Garth\n\nLocation: Ft.

Could you please tell me, what the background is on this page? It looks so farmilliar to me...it's has a reindeer but it's not the famous Rudolph, and it has a man with a huge chin. What is that? God, looking at all this stuff is like tapping into some sacred part of my psyche or something. The real reason I am here is because there was a movie that I adored when I was younger, I only seen it once, it was called the Last Unicorn, and it was that Japanamation and it was about a unicorn that turned into a human. I can't remember much about it except that it was excellent. I think maybe it was a creation of Rankin/Bass, but I'm not sure. Everything they create is a masterpiece. Anyways, if you could help me find a copy of the movie.

Every December for the last 30 years, I have always enjoyed the holiday shows such as Rudolph, Frosty, Jack Frost, etc. These specials are excellent classics. I enjoy the characters in these specials not only because they are funny and humorous but also because they can send good messages to people in real life. I think this is a very cool web page. Keep up the good work. If it were my choice, I would give both Arthur Rankin Jr. and Jules Bass stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Will there be any plans in the future to have a show about these two animators (ie: A&E's Biography or the E! True Hollywood Story). I believe it would be interesting to watch. Anyway, keep up the good work on this web site.

I know they have to make room for commercials but c'mon.... I could not believe the way they cut the songs in half and thought we wouldn't notice! I've been so happy in recent years to see footage RESTORED to these classics (i.e. Charlie Brown Christmas, Rudolph) that I was heartbroken to see this done to my favorite one of all! Their only saving grace was leaving Heat & Snow Miser's songs intact, otherwise I would have gone over the edge! There, I've vented. Great book, by the way!

I di with my daughter Sara (8) and it look like SAM THE BUTCHER edited the special for the network. It was laughable. Midway through the first three songs....they just stopped!(Ha, Ha) Instead of Santa landing in Southtown on his reindeer...he magically appears and is already in conversation with the cop. My daughter didn'ty notice these chops, so I guess it didn;t hurt the show's appeal too much BUT the purchase of the home video is now mandatory for collectors!

I did answer this in some detail in my CINEFANTASTIQUE Feb. 1999 article in their \"100 Years of Stop-Motion\" issue. For those of you that missed it, the 'ANIMAGIC' figures were made for animation puposes and not made to last or collect. The same can be said of RKO's KING KONG, etc. etc. The materials used were flexible and sprayed down with a type of flock to avoid reflection for filming purposes. The Spray had some acidity to it and eventually would cause the figure(s) to deteriorate over time. True, some do still exist in private collections (Arthur and Jules would give them to people they worked with), but all that I am aware of are barely hanging together. We will share some of the photos of these figures on our 'ANIMAGIC' web pages soon....Donner is already there in many poses. Jules Bass explained \"We did have a few re-creations made in lasting materials to display in our office, but the average life of a real 'Animagic' figure was about 6 months.\" I was given a Wood carved Salad Fork/Spoon set of FANG & DRACULA carved by head 'ANIMAGIC' tech Pinchon (during the making of MAD MONSTER PARTY) as a gift from RANKIN/BASS for Christmas last year! THANK god these were made with lasting material! I'll try to share some photos soon! If you are interested in collecting dead on likenesses of the characters in 3-D form, go out and buy the ENESCO figurine line! More planned for next year too! In other NEWS...David Letterman did another funny RUDOLPH parody last night! Last years was newly animated in CLAYMATION. This year he used the actual clips with overdubbed dialogue (as he did in 1997). His information on the special was wrong, stated the show has been on over 40 years. He knew it was wrong and joked about it. A BMW commercial aired during his show with a NEW version of the song \"We Are Santa's Elves\" in the background. In answer to one of our recent letters on the mail page, The R/B compilation CD was done for Promotional purposes and for the staff at RANKIN/BASS. In order to put it out as a legitimate release, we would have to obtain the rights from many sources. We would like to see this happen and will try to pursue it BUT unfortunately, based on our past experiences with things like this, COLLECTORS packages are frowned upon by the powers that be. We would all like to see them happen BUT for some reason, the companies that own the rights choose to use the opinions of focus groups (not fans) to develop a product and look for the biggest $! Take the RUDOLPH DVD for instance. Look at that awful cover, the lack of additional material and the lack of specific info on the liner notes. I suggested adding the additional \"Fame and Fortune\" clip, the 1966 promo and a special with interviews with all involved BUT instead, they put out a quickly assembled DVD for the $. Don't get me wrong, the print is beautiful and it is fully restored to it's 1964 version...so there something to be THANKFUL for, but I am sure this release disappointed most of the true R/B fans. I am told there are plans to turn this thing around next year with Photo packaging, additional material, etc.. This year, the cover alone tells the story! So, I agree with you, much more collectible material deserves to be released out of the RANKIN/BASS archives...now if we can only get the powers that be to understand this...they make make $ after all.\n\nName:Richard Washington\n\nLocation: New York, NY USA\n\nDate: Thursday, December 2, 1999 at 12:39:48\n\nComments:\n\nGreetings, Rick, and greetings, fellow Rankin/Bass groupies everywhere! I'm wearing my newly-acquired Santa Claus suit even as I type this, so I hope you've all been especially good this holiday. But now to business. R/B's \"Santa Claus is Comin' to Town,\" from 1970, will air on Fox Family Channel later this month; however, their advertising people apparently are unaware that it is indeed a Rankin/Bass Production. I hope that, in the future, some cable networks who dare to air the R/B shows understand that there are some of us --- principally Rick, and including myself --- who do expect the Rankin/Bass name to be treated respectfully. That, I believe, is a major reason for the existence of rankinbass.com; and I hope Rick can make that clearer to a good many of us as we come closer to 2000. Bottom line: Advertise any rerun of a Rankin/Bass series or special on any of the cable networks by identifying the specific program with \"Rankin/Bass'...\" Indeed, an example of this can be found in my Santa Claus movie timeline, at the aforenoted SCTM.com. The quote reads: \"Also in 1964: Rankin/Bass' One and Only, Original 'Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer' --- television's longest continuously aired animated Christmas special....\" I hope I made this suggestion clear to you. Sorry I can't send you pics of myself as Santa just yet; that's a little bit down the road. Anyway, happy viewing --- and remember: RANKIN/BASS RULES!\n\nName:Jen \"Herbie\" Kahler\n\nLocation: Long Island, NY USA!!!\n\nDate: Thursday, December 2, 1999 at 11:45:04\n\nComments:\n\nI LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the site, but I am devestated to find out that \"Herbie\" is really \"Hermey\". It has been a controversy in my family for a while now, especially ever since my friend's uncle has called me that as a nickname (kind of embarassing for a 27 year old woman!). It was always hard to tell because of Rudolph's very nasal voice, but now the mystery is solved. I guess he will always still be Herbie to me. SECOND POINT: I'm sure I speak for all the R/B fans out there when I say: WHY WONT THERE BE A WIDESPREAD RELEASE OF THE COMPILATION CD?????? I understand you wanting it to be a special gift for the R/B family, but just from a cost standpoint, it costs a lot of money in studio time, etc to make a CD of that quality to only make 59 or so copies. Will it ever go into widespread release? Even if you offer it exclusively through this website, many fans would jump at the offer! I know I would! ANYWAY, thanks for letting me rant and rave. I am definitely going out to buy the book. And my sister is getting her copy of Mad Monster Party-I never even heard of it until recently, because I'm too young. Seems only the Baby Boomers know about it! Will other old R/B productions be restored and re-released? Animagic is a lost art that needs to be preserved! Again, the site is GREAT and I cant wait to see more exciting things on it.\n\nName:Rick Goldschmidt\n\nA Message concerning ?s from Rick\n\nDate: Wednesday, December 1, 1999 at 22:11:42\n\nComments:\n\nFirst of all, WELCOME to all of you that found us in TV GUIDE! Well, CBS aired RUDOLPH tonight and once again cut the \"Peppermint Scene\"! Still hasn't aired on NETWORK television since 1964 BUT is on DVD and video version! Those commercials are more important than RARE clips! Oh well! So many of you have been e-mailing me with THE question about the Misfit Doll and the HERMEY vs. HERBIE question, that I had to post an \"end all\" answer! First of all, BOTH of these questions are discussed in my book (both on page 5)! If you haven't bought the book yet, Treat yourself for Christmas! HERMEY is definitely HERMEY! I have all the original Romeo Muller scripts and he named and spelled the character's name as HERMEY (never HERBIE). Why does all the merchandise say HERBIE? Good question! I advised the licensees of the proper name years ago! Check our HUMOR page for a bit of humor regarding this question and my TVPARTY.com article as well! As far as the Misfit Girl doll goes, Arthur Rankin jokes about her problem being psychological in my book! The fact of the matter is, she is barely mentioned in Romeo's scripts. He describes the important charcters in GREAT detail and the Misfit Girl doll wasn't even in the original 10-63 draft at all! Charlie is the only Misfit with lines, even in the revised script. The spotted Elephant and The Misfit Girl doll got a few extra lines in 1965 at the end when the return to the Island Of Misfit Toys was added in due to public response. She became a more important character in the second broadcast, but was not fully developed in the script....hence the mystery! I accept Arthur's explanation since he is the RANKIN in RANKIN/BASS and Produced the entire production. Try to tune in to my New York Radio Broadcast this Saturday (Info on our NEWS page!). Many THANKS to Larry Potash at WGN MORNING NEWS for the GREAT plugs today! WGN-TV is the BEST! May be going back on CLTV this month on a show called \"Around Chicago\"! Check out BLOCKBUSTER for a GREAT New FROSTY THE SNOWMAN motion ornament! (We'll try to get a photo up soon!) THANKS for all your kind e-mails! Lots going up this month so....keep checking!

I just finised watching Rudolf on CBS -- I've watched every year since I was a child -- and this question has perplexed me for years. ....\n\nName: John Bradshaw\n\nLocation: Fairfax, VA USA\n\nDate: Wednesday, December 1, 1999 at 14:45:36\n\nComments:\n\nI use to own the 33 1/3 LP Soundtrack of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer but lost it about 15 years ago. I have never been able to find a copy since. If ANYONE knows where to obtain this soundtrack, please email me."
