        "meta_description": "Rankin-Bass was another studio that was synonymous with 70s tv (though they started in the 60s), both for their holiday specials and their Saturday morning output. Formed by Arthur Rankin Jr. and Jules Bass, Rankin-Bass covered the gamut of animation outlets:  feature films, tv specials, network series, and syndicated programming.  They also ventured into the live action world, partnering with Japanese studio Toho for King Kong Escapes.  In fact, Japan factors into most of their productions as both their line animation and stop-motion works were created with Japanese studios.  They are best remembered for their Christmas specials, such as Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, Frosty the Snowman and Santa Claus is Comin' to Town; but, they also produced Saturday morning fare (Jackson 5ive, The Osmonds, Kid Power, several segments for the Saturday Superstar Movie); and syndicated powerhouses, such as Thundercats.  Their logo, a vertical bar and two stacked circles of different shades (combining the letters \"r\" and \"B\") is instantly recognizable by children of the 70s., though they also operated under the name Videocraft International, Ltd.  Let's take a look at their output:",

        "text": "This 150-episode series of shorts chronicles Dorothy's long stay in the land of Oz. The Munchkins are portrayed as tiny globs; the Scarecrow is a fool named Socrates; the Tin Woodman is a bully named Rusty; and the dandy Lion is called Dandy. The Wizard, who speaks like W.C. Fields, can perform little magic beyond card tricks. Nevertheless, Dorothy continually pressures the Wizard to send her home. A constant threat is posed by the solid-green Wicked Witch of the West, who tries to make the dragonette Desmond follow her orders and attack the group of friends, even though he has no malice toward them.\n\nThis is where Rankin-Bass truly made their name. Produced for CBS, it became a staple of the holidays for two generations. It created the structure for all of their future specials (a narrator who talks directly to the audience and relates the story, use of celebrity voices) and is beloved by millions. It's a thing of wonder, as it took a little novelty song and fleshed it into a larger story. Rudolph is the son of Donner, who tries to hide his glowing nose from the other reindeer. At the reindeer games, Rudolph's nose is revealed, to the ridicule of others, though a doe named Clarice, who appeared smitten with Rudolph, doesn't laugh. She tries to cheer up Rudolph, but her father forbids her to see him. Rudolph runs away to escape the ridicule and heartbreak. Meanwhile, an elf named Hermey wants to be a dentist, not a toymaker. He, too, runs away and the pair run into one another and set off on a journey. Along the way, they encounter Yukon Cornelius and a Snow Monster, before finding the Island of Misfit Toys. The special is filled with honest emotion and can't fail to tug at your heartstrings. Actress Billie Mae Richards provides the perfect voice for young Rudolph.\n\nThis was R-B's first feature film, done in stop-motion. It features the tale of a boy genius who travels through time to stop an evil inventor from altering history by turning himself into the creator of several great inventions. The boy is aided by the villain's talking monkey, who rebels against his master. The group go back to the Old West, Columbus' voyage, Arthurian Britain, and pre-historic times in an effort to stop the villain.\n\nThis special featured stop-motion and tells the tale of Smokey the Bear, with Jimmy Cagney narrating. I have never seen this one, so I don't really know much about it. I don't recall it circulating on the networks or syndication in the 70s, though that could have been related to rights for the character (just supposition on my part). It could also just be that it was outshined by later R-B specials.\n\nThis was Rankin-Bass' first full entry into live action, done in partnership with Toho, producers of Godzilla. It centers around the Toho version of King Kong, as seen in King Kong vs Godzilla. A scientist creates a Mechani-Kong (a robot version of Kong) to find the radioactive Element X, which is poisonous to humans. The robot short-circuits, so the scientist tries to find the real Kong. meanwhile, a submarine finds the real Kong, with scenes derived from the original King Kong. The villain captures Kong and hypnotizes him into completing the job. Kong eventually breaks control and swims to Japan to free a female naval lieutenant, with whom he is smitten (ala Fay Wray). The film features a climactic battle between Kong and MechaniKong, on top of the Tokyo Tower. If you enjoy Godzilla films, you'l enjoy this. The film features American and Japanese actors and is directed by Godzilla director Ishiro Honda.\n\nMore stop-motion in this feature film, which tells the tale of Baron Frankenstein's (Boris Karloff) nephew, who becomes heir ot the Baron's secret for total destruction. There is a romance between Felix (the nephew) and the Baron's assistant, as well as appearances by other monster legends. The script was from Harvey Kurtzman, with designs by Jack Davis, both of whom helped launch Mad Magazine to fame (as a comic book). The movie features Alan Swift impersonating actors such as Claude Rains, Peter Lorre, Charles Laughton, and others, while Phyllis Diller also lends her voice. This has been a cult hit since it was released, though for years it was only available in poor quality video. Eventually, a pristine 35mm print was uncovered and a new digital transfer was made. The film would later spawn an animated \"prequel,\" which was part of the ABC Superstar Movie: Mad, Mad, Mad Monsters.\n\nThis Rankin-Bass stop-motion special features a story based on the Christmas song. In this version, the boy, Aaron, likes to play his drum for his animal friends Samson, Babba, and Joshua (a donkey, a sheep, and a camel, respectively) who dance when he plays. The group are forced to join a travelling circus, but escape and join the caravan of the Three Magi. Babba, the sheep, is hit by a Roman chariot and is badly injured. Aaron takes him to the baby Jesus to be healed. Aaron is moved by the kindness of Jesus in healing the sheep, but he has no gift to give, so he plays his drum, leading to the song. Greer Garson plays the narrator, while Jose Ferrer is the voice of the circus owner. The Vienna Boys Choir sing the title song in this heartwarming story. The Rankn-Bass specials often allude to the religious aspects of Christmas, but this was the first that directly dealt with them.\n\nThis is my favorite of the three Rankin-Bass biggies. Fred Astaire narrates as a mailman, delivering letters to Santa, at the North Pole. He proceeds to tell the tale of Santa's early life, and how he came to deliver presents on Christmas Eve. Mickey Rooney voices Kris Kringle, Keenan Wynn is the Winter Warlock, Paul Frees is Burgermeister Meisterburger, and Joan Gardner is Jessica, the future Mrs. Claus. The special is a lot of fun, with origins for the elves, the suit, the beard, the toys, stocking hanging by the chimney, etc... The songs are wonderful, capped off by Astaire singing the title song. The bit where the Warlock captures Kris and the penguin, with trees, scared the bejeezus out of me as a kid.\n\nEaster has proven a tougher nut for Rankin-Bass to crack, as seen in this special. Peter vies with the evil January Q. Irontail to become Chief Easter Bunny. To do so, he must deliver more eggs than Irontail. Thanks to Irontail's treacher, and his own boasting, he loses. Dejected, he leaves the valley and encounters a peddler (voiced by Danny Kaye) who has a time machine, with which Peter can go back and correct things. Inortail sabotages it, though, preventing Peter from visiting Easter, though he can go to other holidays. He eventually delivers eggs on St Patrick's Day and changes the future for the better. Kasey Casem is Peter and Vincent Price is Irontail. I remember seeing this, but it was never one of the favorite specials.\n\nNow we are starting to get into the realm of memory (without rerun prompting). This featured the Jackson 5 in adventures and music, on Saturday morning. The music was theirs but the voices weren't. The premise was similar to Josey and the Pussycats, where the Jackson's manager got them all kinds of gigs, which led to the adventure. The cartoons featured two songs per episode and Diana Ross voiced her cartoon self in the debut. I watched this when I was pretty young and thought it was cool; but I haven't seen it since then."
