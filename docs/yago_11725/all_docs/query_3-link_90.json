        "text": "In celebration of Mongolian emperor Kublai Kahn’s birthday, young, Italian newcomer Marco Polo sails over the summer palace Xanadu on a kite. Although amused, Kublai is surprised when Marco’s merchant father Niccolo and uncle Maffio request that the emperor place the undisciplined young man under arrest in hopes of awakening his sense of responsibility. Kublai agrees to imprison Marco, but only for a single day. On his way to serve his sentence, Marco passes a procession of palace ladies that includes one of Kublai’s daughters, Kuklatoi, and is immediately smitten by her beauty. Upon his release, Marco returns home, where Niccolo chastises his son for refusing to give up his dreams of wandering foreign lands and accept that they have established their merchant business at Xanadu. Later, hoping to cheer up his nephew, Maffio cooks a special new dish he confides he has adapted from the Chinese, which he calls spaghetti. Soon, the gregarious Marco becomes a favorite with the emperor’s numerous younger children to whom he frequently tells colorful stories, including one about the Kingdom of the Trees where the inhabitants pacify a wicked giant with the juice from their trees’ peaceberries. After Niccolo again criticizes Marco for his inattention to the latest caravan preparations, Kublai summons the young man. Forbidding Marco to use red kites, Kublai roguishly points out he has not prohibited any other color of kites. When Marco admits that he has no interest in the life of a merchant and would rather travel and build roads in unknown lands, Kublai suggests he become his special envoy and make a trip to Madagascar. Delighted, Marco agrees and the men toast with several drinks. Afterward, Kublai acknowledges Marco’s growing interest in the ladies of the court and assures Marco that he will marry one day. Kublai then offers him a member of his family in order to unite the Polos with the royal house forever and, enthused, Marco agrees. Later, Kublai calls upon his niece, Princess Aigiarm, whose determination to be a warrior has put off several suitors. Although the princess initially refuses Kublai’s invitation to meet Marco, the emperor orders her to attend a special dinner the following evening. The next night while Marco and Kublai await Aigiarm, the princess refuses to dress in feminine clothes and arrives at the dinner in her battle garb. After Aigiarm refuses the meal, which Kublai has had spiked with an aphrodisiac, the emperor orders the couple to fall in love, but the princess again refuses. Marco asks to be alone with Aigiarm, who is pleased when, in private, he admits he has no wish to marry her either. When the emperor returns and misconstrues the couple’s agreement as indication that they will marry, he orders preparations for a wedding. After Kublai sends the protesting Aigiarm away, however, Marco insists that the emperor stop the wedding plans, confessing that he wishes to marry someone else. Kublai explains that Marco can have many wives, but Aigiarm must be the first. Marco reminds the emperor that Europeans have only one wife and confides that he loves Kuklatoi, which enrages Kublai. When Marco continues to refuse Aigiarm and demand Kuklatoi, Kublai has him confined to his room. The next day as Niccolo and Maffio bid farewell to their first caravan, Kublai has Marco brought to his private chamber where he feigns illness and undergoes acupuncture. Using Marco’s concern for his health, Kublai shows the young man a feather from a mysterious bird known as the giant rook. Implying that he is dying and that his last request is to find the bird, Kublai tricks Marco into going to Madagascar to look for it. Although hesitant to accept the emperor’s request to take Aigiarm and Maffio as chaperone, Marco finally agrees. That night, Marco scales the wall to Kuklatoi’s room where he declares his love and asks her to wait for his return. Although the princess does not speak, Marco is content and sets sail soon after with a crew that includes Aigiarm and Maffio. Chronicling their journey, Marco reports arduous progress when the oarsmen of the ship face 171 days without wind. Eventually the ship reaches the coast of Madagascar where Marco’s exploration party is soon lost until rescued by a genial farmer, Lomar. Amused at Marco’s search for a giant bird, Lomar reveals that the creature was invented to frighten invaders and demonstrates how the giant feathers are created and placed in visible places. Sadly returning to their boat, Marco, Maffio and Aigiarm come upon a whale carcass, and Maffio excitedly declares they can harvest its valuable oil. Just as the group completes gathering the oil, however, a group of soldiers attacks, then scatters when Marco sets off fireworks. During the journey home, Aigiarm and Maffio realize they have fallen in love. Returning to Xanadu almost one year after his departure, Marco asks to see Kuklatoi and is outraged when Kublai reveals she has wed the prince of Turkistan. Over the next year, a disheartened Marco dedicates himself to Niccolo’s business and refuses to engage with the royal children or the emperor. One day, Kublai summons Marco to meet him at the Great Wall and asks him to resume his journeys and visit Kalibalu, where they have introduced the use of paper money. When Marco refuses, the emperor admits that Kuklatoi is back at the court, having mysteriously returned from Turkistan. With Kublai’s reluctant assent, Marco joyfully goes to visit Kuklatoi, but moments after greeting her, is stunned when she prattles non-stop in a shrill, grating voice. Explaining that the Turkistan prince inexplicably rejected their wedding, Kuklatoi nags Marco for not seeing her sooner, then begins planning their future wedding. With his dreams of beauty shattered, Marco returns to Kublai and accepts his request to serve as the envoy of the Mongolian empire envoy and soon sets sail to travel the world."
