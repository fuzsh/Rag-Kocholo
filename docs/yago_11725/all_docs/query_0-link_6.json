She is eventually joined on her quest by Schmendrick, a second-rate magician, and Molly Grue, a now middle-aged woman who dreamed all her life of seeing a unicorn.

        "text": "So then there's the kind of representation you find buried in things like this.\n\nThe unicorn isn't trans or queer, but her coming-of-age tale resonates with those who have lived lives trapped as something else, locking away their identities, trying to find happiness in connections they will never be able to sustain. People who do queer reading or trans reading aren't wrong when they apply those characteristics to many of the old characters hidden in plain sight (at times, the intentions of the filmmakers are too obvious), but there are times it is applied where no intention or even reasonable interpretation could go--because in a representation-starved demographic, we latch onto anything that seems remotely familiar.\n\n\"Now that I'm a woman\"…\n\n\"There are no happy endings because nothing ends.\"\n\n- Schmendrick the Magician\n\nSo, I can't say for sure, but I can only imagine that this is one of those films that is appreciated far more by those who watched, spellbound, at a young age. I'm sure that if your first experience with this was as an adult, you'd probably dismiss it as some generic, Disney knockoff-looking, fairy tale relic from the early 80s. But who knows, maybe your experience would be every bit as magical as it was for me, watching it on LaserDisc for the first time in the mid-80s. All I can say with certainty is that every time I revisit this film, as an adult, it still…\n\n\"It's a very rare person who is taken for what he truly is.\"\n\nThere's a real serious cult following for The Last Unicorn out there, and it's not hard to see why. This movie features some truly great, old-school, hand-drawn animation full of vibrant colors and creative fantasy imagery (I've had a strange craving for FernGully recently, and this fulfilled some of that desire), and it manages a pretty powerful bittersweet climax if you successfully buy into the characters (I was about 60% sold on the characters, so it worked pretty well).\n\nIt also covers a lot of thematic ground without feeling too dense or overly contemplative: appearance vs. reality (\"I can't change anyone into something they're not.\"), coming of…"
