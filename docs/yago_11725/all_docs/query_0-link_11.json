        "text": "''THE Last Unicorn'' is an unusual children's film in many respects, the chief one being that it is unusually good. This animated fable also features a cast that would do any live-action film proud, a visual style noticeably different from that of other children's fare, and a story filled with genuine sweetness and mystery. Children, except perhaps for very small ones, ought to be intrigued by it; adults won't be bored. And no one of any age will be immune to the sentiment of the film's final moments, which really are unexpectedly touching and memorable.\n\n''The Last Unicorn,'' which opens today at the National and other theaters, casts Mia Farrow as the voice of the title character, who embarks on an epic journey to find out why her fellow unicorns have disappeared. As represented by Miss Farrow and a team of animators headed by Katsuhisa Yamada, this unicorn means to be the creature of myths and tapestries, not a cuddly kiddie version. Some of the story's other creatures, like a vicious harpy or a talking skeleton, are also far cries from the standard, sugary characters that inhabit children's movies.\n\nBut ''The Last Unicorn'' isn't harsh, even if its story contains scary situations and elements of tragedy. With a screenplay by Peter S. Beagle based on his novel, the movie takes the shape of a whimsical, picaresque adventure, preoccupied with the differences between myth and reality (Robin Hood is even seen walking blithely through the forest at one point, a figure of legend utterly impervious to the ''real'' people around him). The unicorn, who soon picks up a companion called Schmendrick the Magician, journeys over a interesting and changeable landscape until she reaches King Haggard, who holds the secret of the other unicorns' fate. That fate is finally resolved in one of the animators' most startling and lovely images.\n\nSchmendrick's voice is supplied by Alan Arkin, who does a most enjoyable job with the role, and Haggard is played by Christopher Lee. Among the other luminaries in the movie's large and excellent cast are Tammy Grimes, Robert Klein, Jeff Bridges, Angela Lansbury, Keenan Wynn and Rene Auberjonois, with Paul Frees doing a particularly amusing cat imitation and Miss Grimes most affecting in her first meeting with the unicorn. She plays an aging, disappointed wife who angrily exclaims ''It would be the last unicorn in the world that came to Molly Grue. It's all right. I forgive you.''"
