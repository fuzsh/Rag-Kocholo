        "text": "Adults of a certain generation would remember waiting with excitement and anticipation during the holiday season for the day their favorite Christmas movie would come on television. For the next five days, I will share my top ten in no particular order. Frosty The Snowman was one of those classics that even though its primary audience was children…most of the characters were voiced by adults, including voice legend June Foray. Directed by Jules Bass and Arthur Rankin.\n\nWhen it comes to holiday classics, there are few Christmas TV specials more beloved than the original Frosty the Snowman. The animated short has been delighting generations of viewers since it debuted in 1969. In this sweet holiday movie, a group of children bring Frosty to life with an enchanted hat and help him in his quest to reach the North Pole so he doesn’t melt\n\nBass was also responsible for several classics including The Little Drummer Boy (1968), The Year Without a Santa Claus (1974), Santa Claus is Coming to Town (1970), Here Comes Peter Cottontail (1971), Rudolph and Frosty’s Christmas in July (1979) and the ver popular Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer…most of which were based on classic Christmas tunes. The classics were done with an animation style called stop-motion, which is being used again in such current animation films as The Boxtrolls. Frosty comes to life when a discarded hat lands on top of the snowman, but the evil Professor Hinkle is determined to melt the good natured snowman in an attempt to prevent him from ever coming to life again. I know it sounds sinister and a little to evil for children to bond with, but I assure you, I would cry like a baby. When Frosty melted and he came back to life, I was just as elated as the children in the cartoon if not more!\n\nWith things being a little different this year due to the pandemic. Classics like Frosty can be streamed via CBS All Access, Freeform or HULU Live\n\nTake a look back with me at Frosty the Snowman…"
