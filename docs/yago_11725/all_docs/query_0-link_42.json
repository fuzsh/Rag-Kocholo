        "meta_description": "In this animated adventure classic, directed by Jules Bass and Arthur Rankin Jr. and written/based on a novel by Peter S. Beagle, a riddle-spewing butterfly (Robert Klein - Mixed Nuts) tells a unicorn (Mia Farrow - Rosemary’s Baby) that she is the last of her kind, and she sets off on a quest to find the truth, aided by low-rent magician Schmendrick (Alan Arkin - Slums of Beverly Hills). They must contend with conniving witch Mommy Fortuna (Angela Lansbury - Bedknobs & Broomsticks), evil unicorn-coveting King Haggard (Christopher Lee - The Man with the Golden Gun), and his adopted son, the naive and hunky Lir (Jeff Bridges - The Big Lebowski), from whom they hide through a weak spell that temporarily turns the unicorn into a lady, adding romantic complications. Ultimately, themes of identity, and being true to one’s real self, emerge as the message of the tale.",
