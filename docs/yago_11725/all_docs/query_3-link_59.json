        "text": "I would be an absolute nut(cracker) to consider my favorites history’s very best Christmas movies.\n\nTruth is, I had a tough time listing personal favorites in any permanently honest order; there naturally are times we lean toward older classics and other times when nothing but another look at “A Christmas Story” will do. Peter Billingsley telling us, “Oh my God, I shot my eye out” always will be as funny as Chinese waiters singing Christmas carols.\n\nHowever, while I may astonish some with Hogwarts holidays for Harry Potter, there are quite a few other films I admire or downright love that I could not bring myself to list, despite scenes taking place during the holidays. Consider my favorite: Billy Wilder’s “The Apartment,” in which Jack Lemmon comes to his senses on Christmas Eve and Shirley MacLaine delivers that memorable closing line. Bruce Willis sends a “ho ho ho” message with an automatic weapon after stumbling upon crime during a Christmas party at Nakatomi Plaza in “Die Hard.”\n\nOf course there is Francis Ford Coppola’s “The Godfather,” where Michael (Al Pacino) and Kay (Diane Keaton) are Christmas shopping, with “The Bells of St. Mary” on a theater marquee, unaware that Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) had been shot while buying fruit and may need protection from assassins. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover have different reactions to their jobs during the holidays in “Lethal Weapon,” which ends with Gibson finding Christmas peace with his partner’s family. Dan Aykroyd wears a Santa suit while falling on hard time in John Landis’ hilarious “Trading Places.”\n\nFor sheer violence at Christmas time, just try “Kiss Kiss Bang Bang” and “Reindeer Games.” More than a dozen titles deal with serial killers at Christmas. Mind you, there are many surprising titles set on or near Christmas. Would you believe Stanley Kubrick’s “Eyes Wide Shut?”\n\nPlus, not every real Christmas movie appealed to me. I’ve softened a bit, but I never was a fan of Chevy Chase’s “National Lampoon” comedies. And it took years for “Home Alone” to make my list; oh, I always loved the bandits, but Macauley Culkin’s Kevin had to grow on me. He did, though. It’s a well-directed holiday comedy.\n\nKerns’ Christmas movie choices:\n\n1. “Miracle on 34th Street” — 1947, directed by George Seaton.I even liked the color remake with Richard Attenborough, but the best always is the original with Edmund Gwenn, Maureen O’Hara, child actress Natalie Wood as Susan, and John Payne. An old man named Kris Kringle (Gwenn) fills in for an intoxicated Santa in Macy’s Thanksgiving Day parade. Hired as Macy’s Santa, he could wind up institutionalized unless lawyer Payne can help him convince O’Hara’s character and others he is the real Santa.\n\n“You’ve got them mixed up. You’re making a mistake. You’re making a mistake with the reindeer.”\n\n2. “A Christmas Carol” — 1984 made-for-television film directed by Clive Donner, and 1951 original directed by Brian Desmond Hurst.My favorite version is a television special with George C. Scott as Scrooge, but close behind and worth watching is the British original starring Alistair Sim. Surely everyone knows the Charles Dickens novella as source material with miserly Ebenezer Scrooge, warned by the ghost of former business partner Jacob Marley on Christmas Eve that he will be enlightened by three Christmas spirits that very night. Robert Zemeckis’ 1994 computer-animated stop-motion update of “A Christmas Carol” with Jim Carrey in multiple roles also is underrated.\n\n“It’s all humbug, I tell you, humbug!”\n\n3. “It’s a Wonderful Life — 1946, directed by Frank Capra.Repetition only makes one want to share this sentimental story with newcomers. Most know that angel-in-training Clarence (Henry Travers) has the tough job of convincing depressed, frustrated and suicidal businessman James Stewart that his life is still wonderful. Stewart is terrific throughout, even when promising to lasso the moon for Mary (Donna Reed).\n\n“Teacher says, every time a bell rings an angel gets his wings.”\n\n4. “A Christmas Story” — 1983, directed by Bob Clark.I sensed “instant Christmas classic” the first time I saw this comedy, based on the writings of author Jean Shepard. Peter Billingsley is wonderful as youngster Ralphie, who dreams of receiving an air rifle for Christmas. But the funniest performance may be delivered by Darren McGavin as his often cranky dad who actually orders a leg lamp, and is comforted throughout by wife Melinda Dillon.\n\n“I want an official Red Ryder, carbine action, 200-shot, range model air rifle.”\n\n5. “Elf” — 2003, directed by Jon Favreau.Perhaps Will Farrell’s most genuine, sensitive performance. He plays Buddy, accidentally transported to the North Pole as a toddler and raised to adulthood among Santa’s elves. In full elf regalia, the adult Buddy travels to New York City searching for his dad, who turns out to be cynical publisher James Caan. A film as sweet as it is absurd, a funny fantasy.\n\n“Santa! Oh my God! Santa’s coming! Santa’s coming! I know him! I know him!”\n\n6. “3 Godfathers” — 1948, directed by John Ford.Three thieves and rustlers in this western — John Wayne, Pedro Armendariz and Harry Carey Jr. — rob an Arizona bank and are on the run from a sheriff (Ward Bond) and posse who refuse to give up. The outlaws lose their horses and meet a stranded woman (Mildred Natwick), who dies during childbirth, but not before making them promise to carry her baby to safety. Carey likens their situation to Three Magi finding the baby Jesus, and he convinces his now repentant partners to head for New Jerusalem, almost certainly out of reach across a desert.\n\n“Hey, Bob. I just remembered what tomorrow is. Feliz Navidad.”\n\n7. “The Polar Express — 2004, directed by Robert Zemeckis.A delightful computer-animated adaptation of the beloved children’s book by Chris Van Allsburg finds Tom Hanks providing voices for six major characters. The story is about a doubting young boy who boards a train to the North Pole, embarking on a journey of self-discovery, learning about friendship, bravery and a Christmas spirit that never fades for those willing to believe. Superb sequences also involve dancing waiters and the train sliding on a sheet of ice.\n\n“Seeing is believing, but sometimes the most real things in the world are the things we can’t see.”\n\n8. “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone” — 2001, directed by Chris Columbus.Surprised? Oh come now, there are Christmas moments in several Harry Potter movies, and what is more beautiful than Christmas at Hogwarts? More might choose “Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire” because it includes the Yule Ball. But recall Christmas in the introduction, where we watch Hagrid drag a Christmas tree through the show, followed by a tree being decorated by Filius Flitwick, and Harry receiving his first-ever gifts, including the coolest present of all: an invisibility cloak.\n\n“There’s no name (on the gift). It just says, ‘Use it well.’”\n\n9. “We’re No Angels” — 1955, directed by Michael Curtiz.After escaping prison on Devil’s Island, Joseph (Humphrey Bogart), Albert (Aldo Ray) and Jules (Peter Ustinov) hide in a shop run by kind-hearted Felix (Leo G. Carroll) and his family. They plan to rob the store for money needed to escape. But after sharing Christmas dinner and learning of the family’s troubles, the convicts focus on good deeds instead.\n\n“Christmas has always been a wonderful time for me. In fact, that’s how I got into trouble. I came home and found my wife giving my friend a … present.”\n\n10. “Home Alone” — 1990, directed by Chris Columbus.The McCallister family plans to spend Christmas in France, forgetting in all of the chaos that they left 8-year-old Kevin (played by Macaulay Culkin) at home alone. Kevin believes a wish to make his family disappear has come true. With his mother frantic overseas, Kevin tries living on his own,then realizes it is up to him to protect the family home from a pair of hilarious con men portrayed by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern.\n\n“You guys give up? Or are you thirsty for more?”\n\n11. “White Christmas” — 1954, directed by Michael Curtiz. The title fits. This musical finds World War II buddies Bob (Bing Crosby) and Phil (Danny Kaye) becoming a top song-and-dance act. They join sisters Betty (Rosemary Clooney) and Judy (Vera-Ellen) for a Christmas show at an inn in rural Vermont owned by their former commander (Dean Jagger). But weather and romantic mix-ups could find both the inn and love failing.\n\n“We came up here for the snow. Where’re you keepin’ it?”\n\n12. “The Muppet Christmas Carol” — 1992, directed by Brian Henson.Jim Henson died in 1990, but his son Brian was convinced to pay tribute by using the Muppets — along with Michael Caine as Ebenezer Scrooge — to tell one of history’s favorite stories. Kermit the Frog plays Bob Cratchit, and friends Miss Piggy, Gonzo, Fozzie Bear and more weave in and out of the familiar story. Actually, I saw this at a New York premiere and was able to meet the Muppets, their operators and voice-actors. That made it even more special.\n\n“Christmas is a very busy time for us, Mr. Cratchit. People preparing feasts, giving parties, spending the mortgage money on frivolities. One might say that December is the foreclosure season. Harvest time for the money-lenders.”\n\n13. “Gremlins” — 1984, directed by Joe Dante. Hoyt Axton is a gadget salesman looking for an original Christmas gift and settles on a mogwai from a Chinese shop, even though it comes with warnings. When his son, a mild-mannered bank teller, breaks important rules, a growing number of malevolent monsters begin destroying the small town of Kingston Falls.\n\n“But the most important rule, the rule you can never forget, no matter how much he cries, no matter how much he begs, never feed him after midnight.”\n\n14. “The Santa Clause” — 1994, directed by John Pasquin.On Christmas Eve, divorced dad Scott (Tim Allen) startles a Santa on the roof, who falls to his death. Scott dons Santa’s suit, per instructions, and the reindeer help him deliver gifts and transport him to the North Pole, where elf Bernard(David Krumholtz) explains he must take the former Santa Claus’ place. Scott thinks he is dreaming, until his hair stays white and he quickly gains a lot of weight. Even if he accepts the new job, how does he keep it secret from his family?\n\n“If something should happen to me, put on my suit; the reindeer will know what to do.”\n\n15. “The Great Rupert” — 1950, directed by Irving Pichel. The simplistic story stars Jimmy Durante and Queenie Smith as former acrobats, now homeless at Christmas. They move into an apartment, not knowing Rupert is in the rafters, or that the squirrel busies himself with house cleaning whenever someone hides cash in is living quarters. Terry Moore and Tom Drake co-star. Predictable but charming.\n\n“Rosalinda needs new shoes.”\n\n* 16. “Edward Scissorhands” — 1990, directed by Tim Burton.Vincent Price is a scientist who dies before he finishes building an animated human, leaving a young man (Johnny Depp) with metallic scissors for hands. Even when saved by saleswoman Dianne Wiest, his kindness and artistic talent make him an outcast. Why a Christmas movie? The entire narrative is framed around a woman telling her grandchild why it always snows on Christmas.\n\n“Of course he had a name. His name was Edward.”\n\n“The Nightmare Before Christmas” — 1993, directed by Henry Selick.\n\nJack Skellington, pumpkin king of Halloween Town, is bored with doing the same thing. When he stumbles into Christmas Town, all bright colors and warm spirits, he tried to convince his resident bats, ghouls and goblins to help him stage Christmas, even if they must kidnap Santa. But they just can’t quite get it right.\n\n“There’s children throwing snowballs/instead of throwing heads. They’re busy building toys/and absolutely no one’s dead!”\n\n“The Bishop’s Wife” — 1947, directed by Henry Koster.Bishop Henry Brougham (David Niven) prays for help raising money to build a cathedral. Along comes Dudley (Cary Grant), claiming to be an angel. Henry is skeptical, then annoyed when Dudley becomes his assistant, and finally jealous when Dudley wins the attention of Henry’s long-suffering wife (Loretta Young.) Remade with Denzel Washington and Whitney Houston in 1996 as “The Preacher’s Wife.”\n\n“Sometimes angels rush in where fools fear to tread.”\n\n19. (Five-way tie for television specials, best when shown together):\n\n* “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer” — 1964, directed by Larry Roemer and Kizo Nagashime.\n\n* “A Charlie Brown Christmas” — 1965, directed by Bill Melendez.\n\n* “Dr. Seuss’s How the Grinch Stole Christmas” — 1966, directed by Chuck Jones.\n\n* “The Little Drummer Boy” — 1968, directed by Jules Bass and Arthur Rankin Jr.\n\n* “Frosty the Snowman” — 1969, directed by Jules bass and Arthur Rankin Jr.\n\nA tribute to an era when television produced holiday specials for families, even if filmmakers had minimal budgets.\n\n“He puzzled and puzzed till his puzzler was sore. Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn’t before. Maybe Christmas, he thought, doesn’t come from a store. Maybe Christmas, perhaps … means a little bit more!”\n\n* 20. “National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation” — 1989, directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik.Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase), looking forward to his Christmas bonus, pesters wife Ellen (Beverly D’Angelo) to help plan a perfect family Christmas, from the tree to outdoor decorations. Then hick cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) shows up with his family unannounced, setting up his camper on Clark’s property."
