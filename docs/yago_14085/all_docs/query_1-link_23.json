        "text": "Television actor Gauri Pradhan Tejwani, well known for her role as Nandini Virani, one of the most popular characters on Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi turns a year older today (born on September 16, 1976). The actor became a household name with her chemistry with now-husband Hiten Tejwani in the hit TV show Kutumb. Post embracing motherhood, Gauri Pradhan Tejwani took a sabbatical to return with an impressive stint in Meri Aashiqui Tumse Hi. On her 40th birthday, we got in touch with the gorgeous actress to speak about her birthday plans, her upcoming show Tu Aashiqui and 13 years of marital bliss with Hiten.\n\nWithout further ado, here's an excerpt from the interview of Gauri Pradhan Tejwani:\n\nWhat are your birthday plans?\n\nHiten is traveling on my birthday because of his play. Last week, we had a show in Goa so we holiday-ed there for three days. Since he wasn't going to be there on my birthday, we celebrated it last week. So on my birthday, it is just going to be chilling out with my kids and parents.\n\nHow do you spend your birthday usually?\n\nOnce you have kids, it is more about them then you. Even for your birthday, they are more excited than you are. Usually, my birthdays are very chilled out. I go out with very close friends for dinner or have a house party a day earlier and on the birthday spend time with kids and the family.\n\nBest birthday surprise by Hiten?\n\nHe has tried many-a-times but has failed miserably because I get to know about the plans every time and I pretend to look surprised. He has done a lot of romantic things; he has taken me out on holidays not as a surprise because but with kids - we have traveled a lot. The one birthday I remember is when we were doing Nach Baliye. He planned a party and of course, I knew that something was up, but didn't know that he is planning this huge party. He called my parents from Pune and my friends from all over, which left me overwhelmed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow has life changed post motherhood?\n\nNow our partying days are over. We have done that a lot earlier but now whatever little time we get we try to spend it with our kids.\n\nIt's been 13 years of marital bliss with Hiten. How has the journey been so far?\n\nIt doesn't feel like 13 years and the journey has been amazing. He is a great guy. I think everyone should have a husband like that so that life becomes easy for you and him both. He is very down to earth and extremely caring. He is very entertaining, which is very important otherwise it gets really boring. I tell people that we don't put the television on in our house because we don't need any other medium of entertainment when Hiten is around. He is like a child, an overgrown child. Whenever I am angry I can show my eyes at least to the kids but with this guy nothing works.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat has changed in Hiten ever since you guys have been together?\n\nNOTHING. Nothing. He is the same. I have changed in many ways. I have become a lot more calm. I used to be very quiet and reserved but now I am much better than before. He doesn't give you a choice to be quiet.\n\nHow do you keep the spark alive between the two?\n\nHis sense of humour is what keeps the spark alive. No matter what situations he has faced, you will always see him smiling. I think that is a great quality and I learnt a lot from that. His honesty and genuineness are what continues to attract me even today.\n\nHow do you manage to balance your personal and professional commitments now, given that you are back in the grind?\n\nIt is very tough, yaar. I also manage a company, so that is also demanding. But then I guess time management is important. My day starts at 5 in the morning and goes on till 12 in the night. Hiten tries to help me out, we take turns to be with the kids. If we are both busy, I call my parents over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou will next be seen in Tu Aashiqui. How excited are you?\n\nI am very excited for a reason that it is an out and out negative role, which I am doing for the first time. That is also the reason why I took it up in the first place. I am sure people will be shocked, I am already getting a lot of phone calls and on social media, fans are like why are you doing a negative role. I am sure once they see it they will see a different side of me acting wise.\n\nWhat about the role intrigued you?\n\nEven though I have done sweet and innocent kind of characters but they have all been really strong. That's how I am in real life and hence I have related to all of them. Again this character is extremely headstrong though in a negative way, she can go to any extent in quest of power and money. I guess that strength in the character is what attracts me, doesn't matter if it is positive or negative.\n\nIt's been over a decade since you made your debut on TV. Since then how do you think the content on the tube has changed?\n\nAdvertisement"
