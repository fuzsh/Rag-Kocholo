        "text": "It seems like Gauri Pradhan’s entry in Bigg Boss 11 house is going to change the dynamics among the housemates. Hiten Tejwani’ wife was on the show last night, where she turned to Hina Khan and politely put her in her place for calling her husband ‘spineless’. Gauri put her opinion forward that her message for her husband was meant for him only and not for others to analyze. Also, when Gauri came to the house at the end of the episode, she had a piece of advice for Hiten Tejwani. While sitting him down, she advised him to start taking stand for what he feels. He has taken her advise very seriously and the latest preview of Bigg Boss is a proof.\n\nIn the latest task, housemates will be asked to name three contestants who are the ‘least deserving’ to stay in the house. They also have to give a reason justifying their choice. When it came to Hina Khan, she named Hiten Tejwani for being a follower of mastermind Vikas Gupta and never playing for his own. The fun part was when Hiten was called out to name his choices. This began the fun part! He brazenly puts Hina Khan’s name on the list. And that’s not all! He took a dig at former Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai actress in the wittiest manner. He said, “Main Hina Khan ka naam isiliye le raha hu kyuki Vikas ne bola hai.” (I’m naming Hina Khan as Vikas Gupta said so). The housemates and host Salman Khan burst into laughter at his jibe.\n\nAlso, tonight at Weekend Ka Vaar, Fukrey Returns team including Pulkit Samrat, Richa Chadda and Varun Sharma will enter the show to promote their film. They will come with a set of questions where the contestants will have to chose between two options. Now here’s a catch! Both the options were tricky. Hiten was asked whom will he marry between Shilpa Shinde and Arshi Khan, to which he replies with Arshi’s name."
