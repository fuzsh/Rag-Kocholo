        "text": "When television's most popular couple got married earlier this year they made headlines. Lissom Gauri Pradhan and TV's favourite beta Hiten Tejwani are madly in love. And make no bones about it. Here's their take on their love story:\n\nHow we met:\n\n\"We first met in Hyderabad around four years ago for the shooting of the Breeze ad film,\" reminisces Hiten.\n\n\"I'm an introvert and take some time to become friends -- so it wasn't love at first sight for me,\" reveals the Virgo girl. However, Hiten admits to liking her from the first day itself. \"We hardly spoke during the shoot nor did we keep in touch later... but our paths crossed again,\" he says with a smile.\n\nDestiny had other plans:\n\nThe duo met again in July 2001 when they were paired opposite each other in the Balaji TV serial Kutumb. \"During the initial shooting of Kutumb, we were just on hi-hello terms. We would be shooting for long hours and since it was a family serial, there were loads of other cast members on the sets as well,\" tells Gauri.\n\nBut gradually they started becoming friends. \"He has a very caring nature and would really look after me on the sets. Since I'm a fussy eater he would cajole me to try out different things from his tiffin,\" says Gauri, getting nostalgic.\n\n\"A lot of people are in awe of her but that's just a shell; the real Gauri is very sensitive, loving and responsible. She goes out of the way for those she loves,\" says Hiten about his lady love.\n\nIt takes two to tango:\n\nGauri is a Virgo and Hiten is a Piscean. Both say that they balance each other. \"We may not gel on everything but have a lot in common and share the same values and are both very grounded and attached to our roots,\" remarks Gauri.\n\nWhile Hiten is emotional, Gauri is the more practical one. She loves Chinese and he can eat almost anything. \"He's very non-fussy and laidback, while I'm the hot headed one and can also be impulsive at times,\" says Gauri of her hubby Hiten.\n\nGauri loves reading, and going to the movies while Hiten enjoys working out and spending time with close friends.\n\nSaying \"I do\":\n\nBy mid-2002 television's most popular jodi were officially in love.\n\nAccording to Hiten, \"We wanted to tie the knot this year. Our families were really looking forward to it and both of us wanted to as well. We are both very simple people and wanted our wedding to be the same. Hence it was a very small affair with just close friends and family in attendance.\" The traditional Maharashtrian ceremony took place in Gauri's hometown Pune on April 29, 2004 and was followed by a reception in Mumbai for friends and well-wishers on May 9, 2004.\n\nWhile they are playing star-crossed lovers on-screen in the popular soap \"Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi\", in real life they are blissfully married.\n\n\"Marriage has given us the stability we needed. It has brought us even closer,\" confesses Gauri.\n\nWhat is the one thing that we don't know about Gauri, that Hiten can tell us? \"She is very accident prone,\" he says, \"During our honeymoon in Koso Mui (Thailand) she fell in the swimming pool and broke her toe. Her toe had to be operated and she was in so much pain that I couldn't bear it.\"\n\n\"I can't help it, accidents happen to me. Wasn't our meeting for the ad film also an accident?\" grins Gauri.\n\n\"Yes, but a very beautiful one!\" retorts Hiten in his trademark style."
