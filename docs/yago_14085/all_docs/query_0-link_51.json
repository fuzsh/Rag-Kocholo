        "text": "In this era of relationships crumbling every second day, it is always heartwarming to see loving couples with long-lasting relationships. Once such couple is Hiten Tejwani – Gauri Pradhan. They completed 14 years of togetherness and the actor took to social media to share a picture where they are seen kissing. Actors like Jaswir Kaur and Karishma Tanna wished the lovely couple. While Hiten was last seen on Bigg Boss 11, Gauri is seen on the hit daily soap, Tu Aashiqui. The couple won a lot of hearts on Bigg Boss 11 when they showed how much they were in love with each other. They met first for the shoot of a commercial for Breeze soap and later their chemistry grew on Kutumb. However, Hiten had to woo her a lot before she finally said yes. Hiten had a failed marriage and said it did not work as he could not give it his commitment due to work pressures. Talking about marriage, he said, “After a bitter experience, I’ve realised that it’s better to get married to a person you love. My marriage with Gauri (Pradhan) is the best thing that could ever happen to me. We know each other inside out. Also, since we’re in the same profession, it helps us understand each other better.”\n\nThe couple married in 2004 in Pune, which is Gauri’s hometown. They are proud parents to twins, Nevaan and Katya. Talking about his wife, Hiten once said, “She’s very caring and not just for me or the kids. If she knows you, she will go out of her way to help you. I love her the way she is. I don’t want to change anything. We have accepted each other the way we are.”"
