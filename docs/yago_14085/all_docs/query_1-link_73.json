In the coming episodes, we will witness husband and wife Hiten Tejwani and Gauri Pradhan battle it out with Kamya Punjabi and her designer friend Neerusha.\n\nOn the show, Gauri revealed that it took her fourteen years to get Hiten into the kitchen to assist her. She said this after host Arjun Bijlani, looking at Hiten’s confidence in the kitchen, asked Gauri Pradhan about Hiten’s love for cooking.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_221403\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"696\"] Hiten Tejwani, Gauri Pradhan[/caption]\n\nRecommended Read: Rashami Desai and Deepika Singh don the hat of a chef for Arjun Bijlani’s ‘Kitchen Champion’\n\nGauri said, “It took me fourteen years to bring Hiten inside the kitchen. He never enters the kitchen and has never made anything, not even something small. He loves giving orders at home, especially when he wants to eat. Right from his tea to his dinner everything is taken care of by me. Today, thanks to Kitchen Champion, I’m pleasantly surprised to see how confident he is in the kitchen and his knowledge about cooking.”\n\nIn Kitchen Champion, two celebs will be accompanied by one of their family members and will take on the challenge to win the title prize."
