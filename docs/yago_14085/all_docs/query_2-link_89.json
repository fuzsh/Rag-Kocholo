Apparently, he was accompanied by his wife Gauri Pradhan and some close friends to ring in his special day.\n\nHiten took to Instagram to share some cute photos with Gauri, cutting his birthday cake and also giving a romantic kiss to his wife. He captioned the photo album stating, \"About last night!\n\n#LifeofGHT #Hitentejwani\"\n\nHiten and Gauri’s kids Katya and Nevaan gifted him a handmade card, which reads as, \"Happy birthday, daddy.\" They also used the letters of his name to describe him. Hiten shared Katya and Nevaan's card and wrote, \"Best definition of Hiten by my kids. Gifts and moments like these are priceless. Thank you for this.\"\n\nLater in the day, he thanked his fans for all the birthday wishes and posted a video of himself. \"I'm so grateful for your messages, wishes. I will keep them all in my heart,\" Hiten wrote.\n\nOn a related note, Hiten celebrated the festival of Holi with Gauri and shared a colourful and beautiful picture with her. The couple looks adorable in the picture. Hiten's caption to the photo is really cute and shows how much he loves and adores his wife.\n\nThe actor captioned the picture, \"Life is colourful with you with me , besides me ..#colors #live #moments #happiness #this #lifeofht #ht #hitentejwani\".\n\nGauri too shared a video with Hiten in which the couple is applying colours on each other's face.\n\nHiten Tejwani and Gauri Pradhan have been married for over 13 years now. They fell in love on the sets of the TV show Kutumb. After years of togetherness, the duo continues to be madly in love with each other.\n\nOn the work front, Hiten Tejwani will next be seen in MTV's Box Cricket League along with other Bigg Boss 11 co-contestants like Akash Dadlani, Arshi Khan, Bandgi Kalra and Puneesh Sharma.
