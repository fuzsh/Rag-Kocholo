        "text": "Hiten Tejwani is undoubtedly one of the most loved contestants inside the Bigg Boss 11 house.\n\nDuring the family task last week, Hiten's wife Gauri Pradhan had entered the house and the husband-wife duo not only shared an emotional moment but the former actress also criticised Hina Khan on her face for calling Hiten a blind follower of Vikas Gupta.\n\nBigg Boss 11 to get an extension; will Salman Khan continue to host?\n\nThis week, although Hiten is nominated for eviction along with Shilpa Shinde, Luv Tyagi and Priyank Sharma, Gauri is positive on him continuing his stint inside the house. Speaking about who should win Bigg Boss 11, Gauri told SpotboyE that her husband will win the show.\n\nWhile her answer isn't surprising, when asked whom other than her husband is a potential winner, pat came a name, Shilpa Shinde. Not just Gauri, several viewers also feel the same. Even Bigg Boss 10 finalist Manu Punjabi believes that Shilpa is likely to emerge as the winner.\n\nBe it selflessly making delicious food for all the housemates or supporting her friends wholeheartedly, Shilpa has become viewers' favourite. Shilpa's fans have increased multiple folds after her stint inside the house and many have been calling her the righteous player on the show.\n\nIn fact, the former Bhabi Ji Ghar Par Hai actress has broken the record of the highest tweet count for any Bigg Boss contestant ever in all seasons till date."
