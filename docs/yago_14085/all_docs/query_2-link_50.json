        "text": "We witnessed the beautiful bond between the celebrated television couple Hiten Tejwani and Gauri Pradhan when the later visited the former inside the Bigg Boss house in the recent season. After years of togetherness, the duo continues to be madly in love with each other.\n\nFor those who don’t know, the two had met each other for the first time in Hyderabad while shooting for a soap commercial. And later, they ended up being paired opposite each other in the popular daily soap, Kutumb. Soon everyone started rooting for their on-screen chemistry while romance brewed between them off screen as well. They were also seen in the popular show, Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi.\n\nAfter two years of courtship, Hiten and Gauri tied the knot on 29th April in 2004 in Pune and then headed to the gorgeous islands of Koh Samui in Thailand for their honeymoon. They have been happily married for a decade and a half and are proud parents to two kids.\n\nYesterday, they went on a romantic date to celebrate Hiten’s birthday. Here are the photos that the birthday boy shared:\n\nAren’t they oh-so-cute?"
