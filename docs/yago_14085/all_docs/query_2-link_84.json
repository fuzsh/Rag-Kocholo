        "text": "Television actors Gauri Pradhan and Hiten Tejwani are television sweethearts. They are the OG couple of silver screen. And their love is what fairy-tales are made of.\n\nAfter keeping us hooked to the TV screens with their on-screen drama, the couple fell in love in real-life love, got married, started a family and have been enjoying marital bliss ever since…\n\nFirst Meeting\n\nAlthough the television couple first officially met at a commercial shoot for Breeze soap, Hiten and Gauri actually had seen each other first at an airport.\n\n“We first met each other, not exactly met but saw each other at the Mumbai airport. We were on our way to shoot for an advertisement and we didn’t even know that we were paired with each other. The agency introduced us at the Hyderabad airport after we landed.”\n\nFalling in Love\n\nThey once again met on the sets of ‘Kutumb’ and fell in love while working together. They say opposites attract, and it certainly worked in case of Gauri and Hiten.\n\nAlthough, Gauri was a little reluctant at first, Hiten did not lose hope and kept wooing her before she finally said yes.\n\nAfter Kutumb, they both worked together in Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi and later participated in Nach Baliye, a celebrity dance show.\n\nGetting Married\n\nA little unknown fact, Hiten Tejwani and Gauri Pradhan first had a registered court marriage in 2002. Two years later, they tied the knot in the presence of family and friends.\n\nThe wedding was a private ceremony and was held in Gauri’s hometown of Pune on 29th April 2004.\n\nAlso, Hiten was married for a brief period of 11 months before getting hitched to Gauri Pradhan\n\nFamily Life\n\nFive years into their happy married life, Gauri and Hiten were blessed with their twins, Nevaan and Katya on 11th November 2009. Both kids are now 10-years-old.\n\nUnlike most celebrity relationships that we see falling apart, Gauri and Hiten had the steadiest marriage of all.\n\nOnly we only wish see these TV sweethearts on telly again! Makers, are you listening?"
