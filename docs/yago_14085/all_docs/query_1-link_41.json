NazirRunning timeapprox. 24 minutesOriginal releaseNetworkSony Entertainment TelevisionRelease29 October 2001 ( ) â€“\n\n16 January 2003 (2003-01-16)\n\nKutumb is an Indian television drama telecast on Sony Entertainment Television. The show aired FROM 29 October 2001 to 7 February 2003. The show had two seasons but the seasons' plots were not related. However, both series revolve around the principal characters of Pratham (Hiten Tejwani) and Gauri (Gauri Pradhan), and their love and kutumb (family).[1][2]\n\nThe Mittal family is successful and rich but very grounded in their traditions and culture. Of the four Mittal sons, the eldest Umesh is married to Gayatri and has three children - Nandini, Pratham and Gautam. Rajesh is married to Archana and they also have three children - Samay, Tushar and Diya. Sanjay is a widower, who often has imaginary conversations with his late wife Maya and their three kids are - Siddharth, Riya and Richa. Ajay and Kavita have no kids of their own and instead dote on all the other kids. The other kids who are also part of the family are Sanskar and Sanskriti, who are Umesh's sister's children.\n\nPratham is revealed to be the spoilt brat in the family and dearly loved by everyone, much to his father Umesh's frustration.\n\nIn contrast, Gauri Agarwal, comes from a middle class nuclear family and takes no nonsense from anyone. Gauri's family includes her father, mother, sister Preeti and brother Shashank.\n\nPratham's own sister, Nandini married young as per her father's wishes but the marriage results in divorce. Her ex-husband also doesn't want anything to do with their son Shobhit. Nandini's father is remorseful for having chosen the wrong man for her and wants her to remarry but she decides marriage is not for her.\n\nAt the same college, Gauri hates everything Pratham stands for - a lack of principles and his being rich and entitled. Pratham loses the Class President election to Gauri and to teach her a lesson locks himself with her in a room insinuating they were fooling around. When the media gets whiff of this, the incident is blown out of proportion and their conservative families decide that the two must be married. Pratham takes this as an opportunity to make Gauri's life a living hell. Under family pressure, Gauri gives in and the two are married.\n\nHow the two cope with their differences, and eventually fall in love with another form the crux of the story.\n\nThe second season shows Pratham as a rich spoilt brat who is disinterested in studies. Gauri on the other hand is the college topper and actively participates in drama activities. Their opposite natures initially lead to fights but while practicing for a college play, they develop feelings for each other. However, Pratham's parents oppose the relationship as they feel Gauri is a middle class girl and does not fit in with their family.\n\nPratham and Gauri are very much in love and elope. They face financial hardships but eventually settle down in their new world. Everything is perfect, till Gauri is diagnosed with cancer and is given a few months to live by the doctors. Pratham is shattered but continues to take care of her during her treatment. Gauri is finally cured and Pratham's family also accepts her. But as fate would have it, Gauri soon dies in a car accident instead.\n\nHiten Tejwani as Pratham Mittal\n\nGauri Pradhan as Gauri Agarwal / Gauri Pratham Mittal\n\nAmita Chandekar as Anu\n\nSai Ballal as Umesh Mittal, Pratham's Father\n\nShama Deshpande as Gayatri Umesh Mittal, Pratham's Mother\n\nPoonam Narula as Nandini Mittal, Pratham's Sister\n\nManorama as Chhoti Dadi, Pratham's Grandmother\n\nLily Patel as Badi Dadi, Pratham's Grandmother\n\nBrijendra Kala as Sanjay Mittal, Pratham's Uncle\n\nSakshi Tanwar as Maya Sanjay Mittal\n\nRituraj Singh as Ajay Mittal, Pratham's Uncle\n\nJayati Bhatia as Kavita Ajay Mittal, Pratham's Aunt\n\nAli Asgar as Samay Mittal, Pratham's Cousin\n\nPooja Ghai Rawal as Natasha Samay Mittal\n\nMonalika Bhonsle as Shruti\n\nKishwer Merchant as Swati\n\nPracheen Chauhan as Tushar Mittal, Pratham's Cousin\n\nVaishali Saini as Riya Mittal, Pratham's Cousin\n\nVarun Badola as Advocate Rahul\n\nRohit Bakshi as Ketan\n\nShweta Basu Prasad as Vanshita, Anu Daughter\n\nHarsh Khurana as Manav\n\nManoj Bidwai as Gautam\n\nDheeraj Sarna as Yash, Pratham's Friend\n\nAbhijit Khurana as Hiten, Pratham's Friend\n\nHiten Tejwani as Pratham Mann\n\nGauri Pradhan as Gauri Pradhan / Gauri Pratham Mann / Shweta Chattopadhyay (after plastic surgery) / Shweta Pratham Mann\n\nMouli Ganguly as Shweta Chattopadhyay (before plastic surgery)\n\nMukul Dev as Abhijat Desai\n\nKavita Kaushik as Monica Malhotra\n\nSimple Kaul as Pratham's Sister\n\nGirish Jain as Shweta's Friend\n\nSheeba Akashdeep / Supriya Karnik as Kamini Aditya Mann\n\nRaju Kher as Aditya Mann\n\nPrithvi Zutshi as Mr. Pradhan\n\nDolly Bindra as Dolly Maasi\n\nTrack # Title Singer(s) Lyricist Music Composer(s) 1 \"Title Track\" Shaan, Jaspinder Narula Nawab Arzoo Lalit Sen 2 \"Title Track Sad Version 1\" Kumar Sanu Nawab Arzoo Lalit Sen 3 \"Title Track Sad Version 2\" Priya Bhattachariya Nawab Arzoo Lalit Sen"
