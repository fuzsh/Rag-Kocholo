        "text": "One of the most adorable and loved telly couples is Hiten Tejwani and Gauri Pradhan. The duo, make us believe that true love does exist. One needs to believe in destiny. The pair, who has been very famous in the 90s shell out pure love and relationship goals for everyone. The pair was seen in two popular serials Kutumb and Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi.\n\nOn April 29, 2020, the pair completed 16 years of marital bliss. During an exclusive interview with Times Now Digital, Hiten spoke about the secret behind his successful relationship with Gauri. He feels that, as he and his wife are from the same industry, so there is understanding.\n\n\"I would say that we are lucky that as we are from the same industry, so she understands my work. I understand her work and I know what goes on while working in the industry. You work for odd hours, outdoors, go on shoots. This all is a part of our work. There has to be understanding. I believe that there has to be faith and respect in a relationship. Of course, understanding should be there\", Hiten said.\n\nThe Kasautii Zindagii Kay star feels that when a pair is from a different industry, the chances of misunderstanding are more. \"There can be people who are not from our industry, as to why you are there for so many hours, outdoors for so many days. We have people who are not from the same industry, but it is easy for the partner to understand when you are from the same industry, what your job requires you to do\", Hiten further added.\n\nThe actor feels that there are examples where couples are not from the same industry but are rocking. \"I am lucky that I have a wife who is from the same industry, who understands my job. I understand, when she does not want to work. She does not like to do the same kind of roles when you do different jobs\", the actor said further.\n\nWhen asked about how the duo met, he said that they had gone to Hyderabad for an ad and had met at the airport. \"We came back, after doing the ad. Then came Kutumb, where we were cast. We did the show and got to know each other. Post that, love happened, we were together and love happened, and we got married\", the actor remarked.\n\nIndeed! Hiten and Gauri give relationship goals to the millenials."
