        "text": "Hiten Tejwani and Gauri Pradhan, the OG couple of Indian television, haven’t lost the charm which wooed us over a decade ago. The stars came into our lives with two popular serials, Kutumb and Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi and after keeping us hooked to their on-screen drama, they fell in love, got married and have been giving 90s kids’ #LoveGoals since then.\n\nHow They Met\n\nWhile the couple and their chemistry became famous while they were working together, the duo had met previously during the shooting of a commercial. In an interview, Hiten shared: “We first met each other, not exactly met but saw each other at the Mumbai airport. We were on our way to shoot for an advertisement and we didn’t even know that we were paired with each other. The agency introduced us at the Hyderabad airport after we landed.” The duo then kept in touch and eventually started dating. Hiten recalls, “She just said hi and bye to me for about six months, and then one day madam smiled at my jokes. We started talking after that, then we started going out and we knew that we are serious about each other.”\n\nSharing a detail about their first date (it’s hard to get this extremely private couple to open up), Hiten had said that one of his most memorable moments was, “our full moon date.”\n\nUnlike their onscreen alter egos, the couple did not rush into their relationship. Hiten explains that while they were in love, he took some convincing Gauri to marry him. Hiten had previously been married before he met Gauri but he was ready to learn from his mistakes and move on. While talking about it briefly in an old interview, he mentioned that his first marriage was an arranged one, and he couldn’t give enough time to his relationship, and they never did fall in love. “Yes, I was married once, before Gauri entered my life. I didn't want to talk about it. Divorce isn't the best thing that can happen to anyone,” he shared.\n\nFinding Love\n\nFor Hiten, that meeting at the airport and everything that followed is the best part of his life. Talking about finding love after a failed marriage he shared, “After a bitter experience, I've realised that it's better to get married to a person you love. My marriage with Gauri is the best thing that could ever happen to me. We know each other inside out. Also, since we're in the same profession, it helps us understand each other better.”\n\nLike much in their life, the couple got married in a private ceremony in 2004, in Gauri’s hometown, Pune. The couple hosted a reception for their friends in the industry the next month and then flew to Bangkok for their honeymoon. Sharing a teeny bit about the proposal, Gauri, in an interview, had once said, “One fine day he came to my shoot and slipped a ring on my finger. We had no engagement ceremony as such. That was it.”\n\nMaking Things Work\n\nDespite knowing each other for over 15 years now, the two haven’t let monotony set in. Talking about what they love about each other, in an interview, here’s what they had to say: “She’s very caring and not just for me or the kids. If she knows you, she will go out of her way to help you,” Hiten said. He added, “I love her the way she is. I don’t want to change anything. We have accepted each other the way we are.” Gauri on the other hand finds herself, like the rest of us, attracted to Hiten’s positive and entertaining personality. “He is a very happy guy, always positive and so entertaining that because of him I really don’t have to put on the television. But he can be taken for granted easily. I want him to learn to say no sometimes,” she shared.\n\nThe Pradhan-Tejwani Family\n\nHiten and Gauri are parents to eight-year-old twins, Nevaan and Katya. The family of four loves to hang out together (remember they even came to meet their dad on the sets of Bigg Boss) and for Hiten, life has never been the same after becoming a father. “It’s a wonderful experience. I think everyone should be a parent at some point in life. The respect for our own parents increases two-fold.”\n\n“Yes,” adds Gauri. “Our whole world is around the kids, it is bliss.”\n\nThat’s it; the adorable and simple love story of a couple who never fails to bring a smile to our face.
