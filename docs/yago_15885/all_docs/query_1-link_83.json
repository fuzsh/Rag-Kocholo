        "text": "Monarchies of Europe\n\nThe Fate of the Romanovs in 1918/1919\n\n(I freely acknowledge that the information on this Web page was reproduced from an article written by Professor Kent Sole, Department of Political Science at Georgia Southwestern State University in Americus, Georgia. It originally appeared in the Imperial Russian Journal, Volume Two, Number One, 1995 .This article was further edited and updated by Paul Gilbert, Web Site Administrator, Royal Russia â€“ the URL for the source of the article can be found at https://www.angelfire.com/pa/ImperialRussian/directory/survivors.html. The only amendment made to the information is in the production of the tables shown which link back to my Web Page on the genealogy of the Russian Royal family)\n\nThe fate of Russia's last Imperial Family is well known throughout the world. But what ever became of the other members of the Imperial House of Russia after the Empire was swallowed up by the Bolshevik Revolution?\n\nWhen Emperor Nicholas II abdicated the Russian Throne in March of 1917 there were fifty-three Romanovs living in Russia. One of these, the Grand Duke Nicholas Constantinovich died of natural causes at Tashkent in February 1918. Of the remaining fifty-two, seventeen were murdered by the Bolsheviks! The remaining thirty-five members of the family all escaped by various methods narrowly managing to escape the same fate as their relatives.\n\nIn addition to the thirty-five full-fledged members of the family, there were also a number of quasi-Romanovs resulting from morganatic marriages of various male members of the family. Of these, only Prince Vladimir Pavlovich Paley and the Prince Artemi Nicholaievich were murdered.\n\nSeveral notes of explanation are necessary before proceeding. Only the children and grandchildren of Emperors bore the title of Grand Duke or Grand Duchess while the great-grandchildren of an Emperor bore the title of Prince or Princess of the Imperial Blood. The second name of an individual simply indicates the name of his or her father. Therefore, Vladimir Kyrilovich means Vladimir son of Kyril; Marie Vlaidimirovna means Marie daughter of Vladimir.\n\nAt the time of the Revolution the Romanov family was divided into four large branches--the Alexandrovichi, including the Vladimirovich and Pavlovich sub-branches; the Constantinovichi; the Nicholaievichi; and the Mikhailovichi. Each was descended from the four sons of Emperor Nicholas I. This examination of The Survivors begins with those members of the family that did not survive the Revolution.\n\nThose Murdered\n\nREFERENCE (1)\n\nREFERENCE (2)\n\nTITLE\n\nNAME\n\nCOMMENTS\n\n1 4.9131 Emperor Nicholas II 2 4.9131 Empress Alexandra Feodorovna, Wife of Emperor Nicholas II and a former Princess of Hesse and by Rhine 3 4.91315 Tzarevich Alexis Nicholaievich 4 4.91311 Grand Duchess Olga Nicholaievna 5 4.91312 Grand Duchess Tatiana Nicholaievna 6 4.91313 Grand Duchess Maria Nicholaievna 7 4.91314 Grand Duchess Anastasia Nicholaievna 8 4.9135 Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich 9 4.917 Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna Wife of Grand Duke Serge and a former Princess of Hesse and by Rhine\n\n10\n\n4.986\n\nGrand Duke\n\nSergei Mikhailovich\n\n11 4.9641 Prince Ioann Constantinovich\n\n12\n\n4.9646\n\nPrince\n\nIgor Constantinovich\n\n13\n\n4.9644\n\nPrince\n\nConstantine Constantinovich\n\n14 4.918 Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich\n\n15\n\n4.965\n\nGrand Duke\n\nDmitri Constantinovich\n\n16\n\n4.981\n\nGrand Duke\n\nNicholas Mikhailovich\n\n17\n\n4.984\n\nGrand Duke\n\nGeorge Mikhailovich\n\n4.9183 Prince Vladimir Pavlovich Paley Prince Vladimir Pavlovich Paley is a quasi-Romanov due to the morganatic marriage of his father Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich 4.9611 Prince Artemi Nicholaievich Prince Artemi Nicholaievich is a quasi-Romanov due to the morganatic marriage of his father Grand Duke Nicholas Constantinovich 4.961 Grand Duke Nicholas Constantinovich Grand Duke Nicholas Constantinovich died of natural causes in 1918 -
