Legitimacy, in turn, means Legality, the faithful observance of both the spirit and the letter of the Law. Law, finally, is above and independent of human practice. Thus, Monarchical Legitimism must survive historical adversities, and the inalienable rights of a dynasty must continue to exist irrespective of whether that dynasty actually rules or has been forcibly prevented by historical circumstances from holdingpower.\n\nThe present volume contains the principal legal texts, as well as legal and historical arguments derived from them, relative to the position of the present Head of the Imperial House of Russia and to the rightful succession. This compila- tion is timely. At present when everything monarchist and traditional is under attack we are not surprised to find that there are those who dare to question and dispute the principle of legitimate succession and the right of the Head of Russia's Imperial House. This attack, like all such attacks on the obvious and the absolute, wields primarily the weapon of quotation out of context. When faced, however, with the full context, i.e. all the texts taken together and in light of the ascertainable intentions of the lawgivers, this weapon is revealed as totally deficient.\n\nAs a corollary to the principal thesis presented in this volume, the reader will find a penetrating and historically essential discussion of the position of the eldest surviving line of the Royal House of the Bagratids. This dynasty reigned in the Kingdom of Georgia and Imeretia prior to its incorporation into the Russian Empire at the dawn of the nineteenth century. Here a telling parallel is drawn between the House of Bagration and that of the Two Sicilies which reigned in an Italian kingdom prior to its annexation by the House of Savoy. Today both this royal Dynasty of Italy and the Bourbons of the Two Sicilies hold a similar status, in that they are both formerly reigning houses.\n\nOne hopes to see this study translated into other European languages.\n\nPrince Cyril Toumanoff, Professor of History, (+ 1997)\n\nEmeritus Georgetown University Washington, D.C.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThis work includes two parts with an appendix to the second part.\n\nPart One comprises (A) a list of the composition of the Imperial House of Russia in 1917, taken from the Court Calendar of that year (the last such calendar to have been published before the revolution) and (B) a list of the now liv- ing members of the Imperial House of Russia.\n\nPart Two contains a memorandum on the Russian laws on Succession to the Throne and on the present position of the dynasty in exile.\n\nThe Appendix to Part Two contains texts of the documents on the basis of which the analyses put forward in the memorandum have been made.\n\nPART ONE\n\nTHE IMPERIAL HOUSE OF RUSSIA\n\nA) COMPOSITION OF THE IMPERIAL HOUSE OF RUSSIA IN 1917, TAKEN FROM THE COURT CALENDAR OF THAT YEAR.\n\n*1.

The order in which the Members of the Imperial House are entered in this list is as follows:\n\n(a) Male members in order of succession, with their consorts immediately following the corresponding male member and with living widows of deceased male members, entered in the place held by the deceased husband in order of succession.\n\n(b) Female members in order of seniority. This order should not be taken as indicating the order in which they would succeed to the throne if the succession were to pass to the female line. According to the Russian law of succes- sion, male members succeed by right of primogeniture and the female members by right of substitution. Here they are entered in order of the seniority of the branches of which they are the issue, except that Imperial Highnesses have prece- dence over Highnesses and Highnesses over Serene Highnesses.\n\n(c) Female members married outside the Imperial House of Russia. In some cases in the past, at the discretion of the reigning Emperor, female members of the Imperial House, on marrying foreign princes, renounced their own right of succession to the Russian throne. This happened in the case of the Grand Duchess Olga, daughter of Nicholas I, who became Queen of Wurttemberg. In this case such renunciations were made by Princess Tatiana Konstantinovna, who married Prince Bagration of Mukhrani, of the Royal House of Georgia, and by Princess Irina Aleksandrovna, who married Prince Youssoupoff.\n\n(d) The Princes Romanovsky (origin explained in opening paragraph).\n\nSystem of transliteration. As the above was translated from an official document, it seemed best to use a sys- tem of transliteration of Christian names and patronymics which would make it possible to convert them back into Cyrilllic. For this reason the system followed was the one used in the majority of institutions in Great Britain engaged in the study of Russian affairs. This system has disadvantages in that familiar English names sometimes appear in forms which may appear odd or sometimes even unrecognizable to English speakers: for instance \"Yelisaveta\" for \"Elizabeth\", \"Yelena\" for \"Helen\", \"Pavel\" for \"Paul\". To prevent misunderstandings, the more familiar form has been given in parenthe- ses. In passages where the same name appears a number of times, the familiar name in parentheses is dropped, unless it is useful to retain it for later reference.\n\nIn the material that follows preference was given to the more familiar form of Christian names and patronymics, with the less familiar form given in parentheses in cases where it was desirable to indicate the form used in Russian.\n\nB) COMPOSITION OF THE IMPERIAL HOUSE OF RUSSIA TODAY [Ed. note: this was written in 1982]\n\n(1)Family of the Head of the Imperial House;\n\nHis Imperial Highness the Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich, Head of the Imperial House of Russia, son of the Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich (seventh in the 1917 list) , born 17/30 August 1917.\n\nHis Consort, Her Imperial Highness the Grand Duchess Leonida Georgiyevna, born 23 September/6October 1914.\n\nTheir Daughter, Her Imperial Highness the Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna, born 10/23 December 1953.\n\nHer Consort, His Imperial Highness the Grand Duke Mikhail Pavlovich (Michael), born 21 August/3 September 1943.\n\nTheir Son, the Grand Duke Georgiy Mikhaylovich, born 28 February/ 13 March 1981.\n\n(2) The other Members of the Imperial House.\n\nHis Highness Prince Vasiliy Aleksandrovich, (40th in the 1917 list), born 24 June / 7 July 1907.\n\nHer Highness Princess Vera Constantinovna, born 11/24 April 1906 (50th in the 1917 list).\n\nHer Highness Princess Nadezhda Petrovna, born 3/16 March 1898 (52nd in the 1917 list).\n\nHer Serene Highness Princess Yekaterina Ioannovna (Catherine), born 12/25 July 1915 (55th in 1917 list).\n\nPART TWO\n\nMEMORANDUM ON THE RUSSIAN LAWS OF SUCCESSION TO THE THRONE AND ON THE POSITION OF THE DYNASTY IN EXILE\n\nIntroduction\n\nA book by Senator N. Korevo, \"Succession to the Throne in Accordance with the Fundamental State Laws\", appeared in Paris in 1922. The publication of this work, described by its author as a \"reference manual\", was very timely. The consequences of the tragic events of February 1917 had already come full circle. The dynasty thus faced the problem of maintaining its position in the circumstances of long-term exile. In such conditions it became imperative that the Russian people be informed authoritatively about the principles underlying the laws of succession. Senator Korevo fulfilled this task admirably.\n\nHis manual moreover has lost none of its value over time. Since its publication, however, further questions have arisen, which were dealt with only indirectly in the manual. In 1922, for instance, there was a considerable number of young unmarried male members of the Imperial House, so that succession passing to the female line seemed unlikely. The manual does contain the relevant articles of the law providing for such an eventuality, but there is no detailed discussion or interpretation of them. And yet it is precisely this question that has today become so important.\n\nThe present memorandum reviews the bases of the Russian laws on succession to the throne and their relation to the position of the dynasty in exile. Attention is drawn to a number of misconceptions and misinterpretations preva- lent in certain circles of the Russian emigration which damage the cause of the monarchy.\n\nIn recent years one notices a growing interest in the monarchy as a result of the political, economic, and moral crises into which our country has been dragged by over half a century of communist domination. During this time also, the present Head of the Imperial House of Russia, the Grand Duke Wladimir, has taken a number of measures for ensur- ing the readiness of the dynasty to resume its historical task. More recently there have taken place the important events of the marriage of his daughter and the birth of her son.\n\nIn such circumstances it is essential that the Russian people, both at home and abroad, be correctly informed about the basic principles underlying the Russian laws on succession to the throne and that they should have access to the text of those laws. To this end an Appendix has been added to the present memorandum containing texts of the arti- cles of the Fundamental Laws referring to the succession to the throne, as well as texts of certain other documents illu- minating this question. These will enable the reader to assess the arguments put forward here on the basis of their orig- inal sources.\n\nBASES OF THE RUSSIAN LAWS ON SUCCESSION TO THE THRONE\n\nThe right of succession to the Russian throne was, by act of the Great All-Russian Assembly of 1613, vested for all time in the descendants of the Tsar Michael Romanov. The Russian laws of succession to the throne which remain in force today are based on legislation promulgated by the Emperor Paul I in 1797, at the beginning of his reign.\n\nLet us begin by saying a few words about the calling of Michael Feodorovich Romanov to the throne. Today this act is sometimes incorrectly interpreted as the \"election\" of an acceptable candidate for the throne by popular suffrage. From this interpretation deductions are made and applied to the question of a restoration of the monarchy in our days. The fact is that the Great All-Russian Assembly in 1613 set itself the task of calling to the throne the nearest next of kin to the extinct dynasty, and none other. According to the views on succession to the throne which were then held in Muscovite Russia and which were based on the Byzantine Nomocanon, close connection had an advantage over distant blood kinship. Boris Godunov, for instance, as brother-in-law of the deceased Tsar Feodor Ivanovich, was not regard- ed as a usurper (he was accused of other things) while Vasiliy Shuyskiy, a Rurikid, was considered a usurper. The per- sons who in 1613 were regarded as the rightful heirs were the descendants of Nikita Romanovich, brother of Ivan IV’s first wife Anastasia Romanovna. The senior among them, Feodor Nikitich, the future Patriarch Philaret, was at that time already in monastic orders and for that reason could not accede to the throne. After him the heir was his son Michael. He it was who was called to the throne.*\n\nIn the seventeenth century, long before the Emperor Paul I promulgated legislation on the royal succession, the Emperor Peter the Great's Statute on the Succession of 5th February, 1722, was in force in Russia. This statute gave the reigning sovereign the discretionary right both to appoint an heir and to bar an heir already appointed from succeeding to the throne. In practice this statute was not always applied. Neither Peter the Great himself nor his grandson Peter II appointed their heirs. Changes of reign were sometimes attended by palace coups, the result of factious struggles of family and class groupings. Whatever were the motives that prompted Peter the Great to promulgate this statute, whether or not he was convinced that this was the only way to ensure survival of his reforms, there can be no doubt that this statute had unhealthy consequences, depriving hereditary monarchy of its most precious advantage over other forms of government, namely independence from the influences of party interests and pressure groups.\n\nThis was clearly realized by the Caesarevich Paul before his accession, since he was himself under constant threat of being barred from succession. On 4th January, 1788, eight years before he became emperor, Paul drew up an Act or declaration of succession to the throne on behalf of himself and his consort, the Grand Duchess Maria, which was signed by both of them. The expected barring of the Caesarevich Paul did not in fact take place and in 1796 he suc- ceeded his mother, the Empress Catherine the Great. This act (declaration) which he had drawn up in 1788 was con- firmed into law on the day of his coronation in 1797.\n\nHere is how Senator Korevo describes this event: \"...after the conclusion of the coronation service the newly crowned Emperor Paul I, standing by the throne, read out the law on succession to the throne which he had drawn up, and which henceforward became a Fundamental State law. Descending from the throne, he entered the sanctuary and placed this act in a silver box especially made for it and laid it on the altar of the Cathedral of the Assumption...’Having established the regulations for the succession, I must explain the motives which prompted them,’ writes Paul in the Act of 1797. They are the following: That the State should never be without an Heir. That the Heir should be determined by the law itself. That there should never be the least doubt as to who is to succeed. That the rights of the branches to the succession should be maintained without violation of natural right and that difficulties which might occur in the pas- sage of the succession from one branch to another should be avoided.\"\n\nThe provisions of the Emperor Paul's Act, together with certain other supplementary acts, were included as arti- cles in the Fundamental State Laws in the first part of Volume I of the Code of Laws issued by order of the Emperor Nicholas I. Since that time several new editions of the Code of Laws were issued. In the Appendix the reader will find texts of the Act of Emperor Paul I of 1797 and of the corresponding articles of the Fundamental Laws, taken from the last edition of the Code of Laws of 1906. Let us now examine the principles underlying this legislation.\n\nWe begin with the question whose answer will help to solve most of the other questions that are likely to arise, namely who has and who has not the right of succession to the throne?\n\nIn the Act of 1797 it was the stated aim of the Emperor Paul I to ensure \"that the rights of the branches to the succession should be maintained without violation of natural right.\" Article 27 of the Fundamental Laws contains the pro- vision: \"Both sexes have the right of succession to the Throne; but this right belongs by preference to the male sex in order of primogeniture; with the extinction of the last male issue succession passes to the female issue by right of sub- stitution.\" This article is followed by others that indicate the order in which the succession passes from one member of the Imperial House to another. Article 53 states: \"On the demise of an emperor his heir accedes to the Throne by virtue of the law of succession itself, which confers this right upon him.\" In Article 126 it is laid down that \"all persons of the Imperial Blood who are the issue of a lawful marriage with a person of corresponding dignity authorized by the reigning emperor are recognized as Members of the Imperial House.\" In Articles 135-143, which laid down the procedure to be followed by parents of persons newly born into the Imperial House, there is an indication of the outward sign which manifests admission of the newborn to the \"Imperial issue\" (Article 137), namely, the inclusion of his or her name by the reigning emperor in the genealogical book of the Imperial House of Russia. This is again confirmed in Article 142: \"The inclusion of the name in the genealogical book is proof of admission to the Imperial issue.\"\n\n* From this one can deduce that, if an analogous situation were to arise today, the assembly of representatives of the peo- ple, whatever name it might bear, would have to be presented with the task of calling an available candidate to the throne, and not settling the disputes of warring sectarian groups. In the latter case it would probably end up by calling no candi- date to the throne.\n\nIt follows that all persons whose names have been entered into the genealogical book by the reigning emperor have been admitted to the Imperial issue and, consequently, have the right of succession to the throne, since the main purpose of these articles is to indicate who has the right of succession to the throne and in what order it is to pass from one person of the Imperial issue to another. Nowhere, in the Act of the Emperor Paul I of 1797 or in the articles of the Fundamental Laws, is there mention of Members of the Imperial House who have no right of succession to the throne. Such a category simply does not exist.\n\nThe right of succession does not belong to persons who have not been admitted to the Imperial issue : that is, the posterity of A) marriages contracted between members of the Imperial House and persons of unequal rank (Articles 36 and 188) , as well as B) marriages contracted by members of the Imperial House without the permission of the reign- ing emperor (Article 183). The names of such people are excluded from the genealogical book and they are not regard- ed as members of the Imperial House.*\n\nAnother important condition for accession to the throne is indicated in Article 63: \"The emperor who possess- es the Throne of All the Russias cannot profess any faith other than the Orthodox.\" The action of this article with regard to members of the Imperial House can be imagined only in theory, in the very unlikely case that any member of the Imperial House, male or female, should not be a member of the Orthodox Church. The article would, however, become operative in practice if the succession were to pass from the Imperial House of Russia to another dynasty which was reigning now or had reigned in the past on a foreign throne. This is provided for in Article 35, which establishes the order of succession if such an eventuality were to occur.\n\nThus any member of the Imperial House, whose name has been entered in the genealogical book by the reign- ing emperor, has the right of acceding to the throne when the succession comes to him or her in the established order. In conclusion of this chapter on the basic principles of the Russian laws of succession, it remains only to establish what, should be understood by the term \"reigning emperor\" when the dynasty is in exile.\n\nIn interpreting any legal term appearing in a legislative act, the point of departure should always be the establishment of the intention of the legislator. One should always begin by first establishing what the legislator had in view and what he could not have had in view. The Emperor Paul I who initiated the Russian laws on succession to the throne, by his Act of 1797 abrogated one law, based on the appointment of an heir by a reigning emperor, and replaced it with one by virtue of which the heir is appointed by the law of succession itself. This intent is reflected in the entire legisla- tion based on the Act of 1797 and it is impossible to interpret this legislation correctly without bearing this basic aim in mind.\n\nThe term \"reigning emperor\" cannot be viewed in contrast to some term such as \"non-reigning emperor,\" see- ing that a cessation of the reigning dynasty is not envisaged in the articles of the Fundamental Laws. The adjective \"reigning\" is added in those articles which require the emperor's sanction for their coming into force, such as articles on permission for marriage, in contrast to other articles which establish, for instance, degree of kinship between members of the Imperial House, where the term \"emperor-progenitor\" is used; or articles which deal with the succession passing to the female line, in which we find the term \"last reigning emperor\".\n\n* It is important to bear in mind that two distinctions are at issue here: that of the right of succession and that of permission of the reigning emperor to marry. The law lays down that permission of the reigning emperor is required for recognition of the law- fulness of any marriage contracted by a member of the Imperial House with a person of either equal or unequal rank. The law also lays down that right of succession to the throne belongs only to the issue of an equal marriage contracted with the permission of the reigning emperor.\n\nIn the past the attitude of reigning emperors to unequal marriages varied. Prior to Alexander III no obstacles were in prin- ciple placed in the way of members of the Imperial House contracting unequal marriages, without, of course, conferring the right of succession to the posterity of such a marriage. The Emperor Alexander III forbade all members of the Imperial House, both Grand Dukes and Princes of the Imperial Blood, to enter into unequal marriages. This ban was included in the Fundamental Laws in the form of a note to the corresponding article. By a Decree of 11th August 1911 the Emperor Nicholas II alleviated this ban, retaining it for Grand Dukes but allowing Princes of the Imperial Blood to enter into unequal marriages with his permission. On the basis of this decree a corresponding amendment was made in the note to Article 188. Article 188 itself, however, remained unaltered,continu- ing to make impossible the deduction drawn in circles today to the effect that, by virtue of the Decree of 11th August 1911 unequal marriages contracted by Princes of the Imperial Blood were placed on the same footing withequal marriages, with admission oftheir posterity to the Imperial issue.\n\nIn exile the Grand Duke Kirill established a pattern of providing titles for morganatic wives of members of the Imperial House. For example, Prince Dimitri Alexandrovich asked him to confer on his first wife the title of Her Serene Highness Princess Romanovsky-Kutuzov, a request which was granted. Following similar requests, the Grand Duke Wladimir conferred the title of Princess Romanovsky-Pavlovsky on the first wife of Prince Vsevolod and that of Princess Romanovsky Knust on his third wife.\n\nAccordingly, in the present conditions of the dynasty's exile, the term \"reigning emperor\" cannot be taken to refer to any other person than the one who would be reigning in Russia if the monarchy were in possession of sovereign power. For a legitimist this, naturally, presents no problem. But even to a person who does not hold legitimist monar- chist views, but who nevertheless considers it desirable that the dynasty should continue its existence in exile, it should be clear, that only such an interpretation is in accord with the true meaning of the law on which such continued existence can be based. With any other interpretation this law simply becomes inapplicable.\n\nOn the Succession Passing to the Female Line\n\nThe present position of the Romanov dynasty has been elucidated in the Message of the Grand Duke Wladimir, Head of the Imperial House of Russia, of 23rd December 1969, the text of which is included in the Appendix. In this Message the Grand Duke points out that, in view of the fact that all the present surviving male members of the Imperial House, except himself, are married morganatically and in view, also, of the fact that it can hardly be supposed that any of them, \"in view of their age, could now enter into a marriage equal in status of birth or have issue possessing the right of succession to the throne\", the right of succession on their demise will pass to the female line, to wit: to the Grand Duke's daughter the Grand-Duchess Maria.\n\nLet us now examine the relevant articles of the Fundamental Laws which deal with the succession passing in such a manner within the framework of the Imperial House of Russia (Articles 31-34) and the article dealing with the succes- sion passing from the Imperial House of Russia to a foreign dynasty (Article 35). Of course, we are here primarily con- cerned with the former eventuality, which affects the present position of the dynasty. We shall examine, nevertheless, the provisions contained in Article 35 which, in addition to the question of succession, touches upon other important ques- tions connected with the interpretation of other articles of the Fundamental Laws: for instance, the question of the reli- gious denomination of a person who might have the right of succession to the throne.\n\nThe main import of the law on succession passing to the female line is set forth in Article 30, which states that, with the extinction of the male issue, \"succession remains in the same branch, but in the female issue of the last reigning emperor, as being nearest to the throne, and therein it follows the same order, with preference to a male over a female, but the female from whom this right directly proceeds never loses this right.\" The Articles that follow deal with the sub- sequent order of succession in the female line, analogous to the Articles on the order of succession in the male line.\n\nArticle 30 establishes two basic principles. The first is that succession remains \"in the female issue of the last reigning emperor, as being nearest to the throne.\" This excludes any need to search for an heiress in the posterity of emperors who had reigned earlier when there is аn heiress of the last reigning emperor. The second principle requires that \"the female person from whom this right proceeds never loses this right.\" This establishes the fact that the female in question is not a kind of \"carrier\" who conveys her right to her male issue, but is a female heiress who herself has the right of succession to the throne.\n\nIn interpreting the term \"last reigning emperor\" in a situation where the dynasty is in exile, the same considera- tions apply as those propounded in the preceding chapter in connection with interpretation of the term \"reigning emperor.\" In view of the fact that, with the exception of the Grand Duke Wladimir, none of the present surviving male members of the Imperial House have issue who could by right succeed to the throne. On their demise the succession passes to the Grand Duchess Maria and to her issue.\n\nOne should note here that, even if we were to adhere to the erroneous interpretation which would make this term refer to the last emperor who possessed sovereign power in Russia, to wit: the Emperor Nicholas II, the succession would still pass to the Grand Duchess Maria. All the daughters of the Emperor Nicholas II were murdered. Next in order come the daughters of the emperor-progenitor, in this case Alexander III. His elder daughter was the-Grand Duchess Xenia, whose sons already have the right of succession. The other daughter of the Emperor Alexander III, the Grand Duchess Olga, has also left no heirs capable of succeeding legitimately to the Imperial throne. Next in order comes the female posterity of the Emperor Alexander II, namely the female posterity of the Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich. The senior person in this female line is exactly the Grand Duchess Maria Wladimirovna.\n\nSuch are the provisions of the law on the succession passing to the female line within the framework of the Imperial House of Russia, and such is the position of the dynasty today. Let us now examine what the law provides in case of extinction of both the male and the female issue of the Imperial House, with the succession passing to another dynasty. Such an eventuality is provided for in Article 35: \"When the succession reaches a female issue already reigning on another throne, it is left to the person who succeeds to make a choice of faith and throne and, together with that person's heir, to renounce the other faith and throne, if such a throne is linked to a religious denomination; if there is no renunciation of faith, the succession passes to the person next in order.\"\n\nTwo questions arise here: the question of faith and that of a possible dynastic union of two thrones. As regards the faith of a Russian sovereign, the stipulation of the law is clearly laid down in Article 63: \"The emperor who possess- es the Throne of All the Russias cannot profess any faith other than the Orthodox.\" Article 35, however, envisages the possibility, when the succession passes to another dynasty, of the right of succession devolving upon a person who does not profess the Orthodox Faith and lays down what such a person should do in such circumstances.\n\nIn a condensed form, Article 35 covers a number of eventualities. The question at issue is one in which \"the Succession reaches a female issue already reigning on a foreign throne.\" This passage can be paraphrased as follows: \"when the succession passes through a female line to a royal or ruling house which occupies (or, in present conditions, which has occupied) another throne.\" Succession in this way can pass to the head of that house or to one of its other branches. Let us imagine a few examples in the past when, if the position of the Imperial House of Russia had been dif- ferent from what it was in fact at that time, such a transfer of succession could have taken place.\n\nLet us imagine that the last heiress to the Throne of All the Russias was the daughter of the Emperor Paul I, Anne, Queen of the Netherlands. Succession would have passed to her and, after her, to her heir, a person of non-Orthodox denomination in the line of succession to the throne of the Netherlands . It is also possible to imagine that the last heiress to the Russian Imperial Throne was the daughter of the Grand Duke Constantine Nikolayevich Olga, Queen of the Hellenes. Succession would have passed to her and, after her, to her son and heir, King Constantine of Greece, an Orthodox sovereign. A third possible eventuality of this type might have occurred if the last heiress to the Russian throne had been the daughter of the Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich, Helen, wife of Prince Nicholas of Greece. Succession would have passed to her and, after her, to her three daughters, all Orthodox: Princess Olga of Yugoslavia, Countess Toerring and Marina, Duchess of Kent. Through Princess Paul (Olga)of Yugoslavia succession would have passed to her Orthodox issue. Through the Duchess of Kent it would have passed to her Anglican issue.\n\nHere we have examples of a possibility of (a) the succession passing to heads or future heads of foreign royal houses, in the one case non-Orthodox, in the other Orthodox; and of (b) the succession eventually passing to members of foreign royal houses, in the one case Orthodox and in the other non-Orthodox, who are not themselves direct heirsto the thrones of their countries. In the first two examples, in addition to other considerations, the question arises of a possible dynastic union of two thrones. An example of such a union in the past was the accession in 1603 of James VI, King of Scotland, to the Throne of England in succession to Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nArticle 35 makes two provisions relevant to this question. The first lays down that \"it is left to the person who succeeds to make a choice of faith and throne and, together with that person's heir, to renounce the other faith and throne, if such a throne is tied with a religious denomination.\" It is presumed that a person to whom the succession pass- es in such a manner might be faced with difficulties, in that he would have to make a \"choice\": it is thus presumedthat he might renounce his right of succession. Such difficulties may arise as a result of his faith and throne, especially if this throne is tied to a religious denomination. For instance, this person might be either the occupant of or heir to a throne tied by the law of that kingdom to the profession of the state religion, let us say Lutheran or Anglican, a profession which would prove an insuperable barrier to his succeeding to the Throne of All the Russias. If, on the other hand, the succes- sion passes to the occupant or heir to the throne of an Orthodox State, the question of faith no longer applies, but obsta- cles of another kind might nevertheless arise. His accession to the Throne of All the Russias would lead to a dynastic union of the two thrones. In itself, such a union is not excluded by the Russian laws of succession, which do not make any ref- erence to it, but in this case it might be subject to ratification by the legislative bodies of the state in question, which for one reason or another might not be granted. In such circumstances, a person to whom the right of succession to the Russian throne comes in this manner is faced with this choice: he must either, together with his heir, renounce the faith and throne (or throne only) of his State and accept succession to the Throne of All the Russias, or renounce succession to the Russian throne. In the latter case the second provision of the article becomes relevant: \"If there is no renunciation of faith, the succession passes to the person next in order.\" Naturally, the same conditions would apply. It is noteworthy that faith alone is mentioned here. One should remember that at the time of the Emperor Paul,Georgia and Imeretia were the only Orthodox kingdoms abroad and that the probable heirs envisaged in the Act of 1797 were members of non-Orthodox dynasties.\n\nIt follows from the above that (a) the Emperor of All the Russias must be Orthodox and that (b) the right of suc- cession to the Russian throne can pass to a non-Orthodox person but that, in order to succeed to that throne, the per- son in question must embrace the Orthodox Faith. No other impediments are envisaged by the law.\n\nOn Marriages of Members of the imperial House\n\nLet us now see what the fundamental Laws say about marriages contracted by members of the Imperial House, with special reference to the stipulations on the religious denomination of those members and their consorts. Before examining the relevant articles, we will define the aims which the legislator pursued when formulating enactments on this question.\n\nThe law posits that the Emperor of All the Russias must profess Holy Orthodoxy. It stands to reason that, in nor- mal conditions of succession a future emperor should be brought up as an Orthodox Christian. It is therefore natural to expect the lawto contain a provision for this requirement.\n\nThe law also lays down that the right of succession belongs only to the issue of marriages contracted with per- sons belonging to royal or ruling houses. It is common knowledge that the majority of these houses do not profess the Orthodox faith. One may expect that this circumstance, too, will be taken into account in the provisions of the law.\n\nFinally, the law declares that, in order to be lawful, the marriage of a member of the Imperial House must be con- tracted with the permission of the reigning Emperor.\n\nSuch are the requirements which serve as a point of departure for the legislator in formulating enactments on marriages of members of the Imperial House and on the religious denomination of their consorts. Guided by these requirements, the legislator will seek, on the one hand, to do everything possible to ensure an Orthodox upbringing for the future emperor. On the other hand, he will seek to avoid placing unnecessary and onerous obstacles in the way of members of the Imperial House entering into marriage with brides equal to them in rank. In formulating his enactments, the legislator will obviously take into account the current state of the dynasty. When members of the Imperial House are few in number, priority will be given to the first of the two aims stated above: that of ensuring an Orthodox upbringing for the future emperor. When the Imperial House has grown in numbers, the second aim acquires greater importance - that of not placing unnecessary obstacles in the way of equal marriages. Such obstacles could arise if it were made oblig- atory for all brides of the numerous members of the Imperial House to embrace the Orthodox faith before marriage.\n\nBearing all these circumstances in mind, let us now examine the provisions of the law on this question. Their sub- stance is contained in Articles 183, 184 and 185, and also, with regard to unequal marriages, in Articles 36 and 188. Although the reader will find these articles in the Appendix, we shall quote them here, for the sake of greater clarity.\n\nOn marriages and the religious denomination of those entering into marriage.\n\n183. Permission of the reigning emperor is necessary for the marriage of every member of the Imperial House, and a marriage contracted without such permission is not recognized as lawful.\n\n184. With the permission of the reigning Emperor, members of the Imperial House can enter into marriage both with persons of the Orthodox Faith and with persons of other denominations.\n\n185. The marriage of a male of the Imperial House who may have the right of succeeding to the Throne with a person of another faith may only take placeafter she has embraced the Orthodox Faith.\n\nOn unequal marriages:\n\n36. Children issuing from a marriage of a person of the Imperial Family with a person not having the correspon- ding dignity, that is to say, not belonging to a royal or ruling house, have no right of succession to the Throne.\n\n188. A person of the Imperial Family who has entered into marriage with a person of a status unequal to his, that is, not belonging to a royal or ruling house, cannot pass on to that person, or to any posterity that might issue from such a marriage, the rights which belong to members of the Imperial Family.\n\nNote. Henceforward none of the grand dukes or grand duchesses may enter into a marriage with a per- son of unequal status, that is, not belonging to a royal or ruling house.*\n\nArticle 183 leaves it to the discretion of the Emperor to permit or prohibit the marriage of any member of the Imperial House. Article 184, in allowing marriages with both Orthodox and non-Orthodox persons, is aimed at not plac- ing unnecessary obstacles in the way of members of the Imperial House entering into equal marriages. The object of Article 185 is to do everything possible to ensure an Orthodox upbringing of a future emperor.\n\n* Article 36 forms part of the articles on the order of succession(25-39) which every emperor swears both at his accession and at his annointing to maintain inviolate. Article 188, which at first sight might appear to be a repetition of Article 36, forms part of the Statute on the Imperial Family, which is included in the Fundamental Laws and which deals not only with the rights of succession but also with all other rights of members of the Imperial House. This explains the inclusion of the words \"to that person\", i.e. the person with whom the member of the Imperial House enters into marriage and who, as consort, would in any case have no right of succes- sion to the throne.\n\nThe meaning of Articles 183 and 184 is perfectly clear and requires little explanation. The formulation of Article 185, however, could easily mislead an uninitiated reader, especially when it is taken out of context. It is in fact on such a misunderstanding that the erroneous interpretation is based - an interpretation which has become widely circulated and is being skillfully exploited by enemies of the monarchist cause - according to which this article precludes the pos- terity of a marriage concluded with a non-Orthodox person from having the right of succession to the throne.\n\nSuch an interpretation does not hold water. In the first place, as we have established in the preceding chapter, the right of succession can belong not only to a person born of a non-Orthodox mother, but even to a person who, when the right of succession reaches him, does not himself profess the Orthodox Faith. In the second place, if this Article is so interpreted, how is it possible to explain the patent contradiction between these two consecutively numbered Articles? Who are the members of the Imperial House who, by virtue of Article 184, are allowed, with the permission of the reigning Emperor, to enter into marriage with both Orthodox and non-Orthodox persons?\n\nWhat of female members? The only stipulation is \"members of the Imperial House\" and, according to Articles 25 and 27, all members of the Imperial House have in principle the right of succession to the throne. It would appear, there- fore, that Article 185 introduces a new category nowhere else mentioned in the Fundamental Laws, a category of mem- bers of the Imperial House who do not have the right of succession. This category is introduced, it would appear, without any explanation whatsoever and also without, any sanction. How are we to explain this absence of sanction? Article 36 states that the posterity of unequal marriages has no right of succession to the throne. Article 183 states that a marriage contracted without the permission of the reigning Emperor is not recognized as lawful. In Article 185, how- ever, according to which, we are asked to believe, an impediment is put on all marriages of members of the Imperial House with non-Orthodox persons, not a word is said about the rights or lack of rights of the posterity of such mar- riages.\n\nThe right of such posterity to succession, however, has been witnessed in a number of Imperial acts issued after the inclusion of Article 185 in the Code of Laws as quoted above. In August 1911 Princess Tatiana, daughter of the Grand Duke Constantine and the Grand Duchess Elizabeth, with the permission of the Emperor Nicholas II, married Prince Constantine Bagration-Mukhransky. Her mother, the Grand Duchess Elizabeth, did not embrace the Orthodox Faith before marriage and remained a Lutheran all her life. Before marriage, Princess Tatiana renounced her rights of succes- sion to the throne. Similar renunciations on entering into marriage with foreign princes had previously been made by female members of the Imperial House. One instance was the case of the Grand Duchess Olga, daughter of Nicholas I Who became the Queen of Wurttemberg. We shall return below to the marriage of Princess Tatiana when dealing with the dynastic position of the House of the Bagratids. At present we are interested in what exactly are the rights of the Princess Tatiana, the daughter of a non-Orthodox mother, to succeed to the throne. Here is what was stated in the Decree of the Emperor Nicholas II to the Senate of 24th August 1911: \"Her Highness Princess Tatiana Konstantinovna has presented to Us, over her own signature, a renunciation of her right of succession to the Imperial Throne of All the Russias which belongs to her as member of the Imperial House of Russia. The Governing Senate will take the neces- sary steps to make this public.\"\n\nClearly, therefore, the words \"male person of the Imperial House who may have the right of succeeding to the Throne,” as used in Article 185, do not refer to all male members of the imperial House, but to a narrower circle of per- sons. The meaning of these words will become clear if we go back to the first instance of analogous use of these terms and if we trace the history of the article itself. We come across a similar use of these terms for the first time in the letter of the Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich to the Emperor Alexander I, dated 14th January, 1822, in which he sought the Emperor's permission to renounce his right of succession. \"Feeling that I lack the talents, the strength and the spirit that would enable me at any time to be raised to the dignity to which, by my birth, I might have the right, I venture to ask Your Imperial Majesty to hand over that right to the person to whom it belongs after me...\" The Grand Duke Constantine, who was the eldest of the brothers of an emperor without male issue, was at that time heir to the throne, but he did not describe himself as such and only stated that he \"might have the right\", thus not excluding the possibility of Alexander I having a son. The same way of thinking is reflected in Alexander I's manifesto confirming his brother's renunciation, in which he said that he could not proclaim his successor by name, \"still abiding in expectation that it might be acceptable within the inscrutable destinies of God to grant unto Us an Heir to the Throne in the direct line.\" In foreign countries, for instance in Britain, there exist the terms \"heir apparent\" and \"heir presumptive.\" The present Queen, Elizabeth II, was, up to the moment of her accession, an \"heiress presumptive\", as in principle the possibility was not excluded that a son might be born to King George VI. In the vocabulary of our Fundamental Laws and their sources these terms do not exist. Instead, we find such expressions as \"heir to the throne in the direct line\", \"the marriage of the heir to the throne and of the eldest male person in his issue\" (instead of the term \"heir apparent\") and \"a male person ... who may have the right of succeeding to the throne\" (instead of the term \"heir presumptive).\n\nThe correctness of such an interpretation of these words when used in Article 185 is borne out by the history of that article. The text quoted above, taken from the 1906 edition of the Code of Laws, is almost word for word the same as the text of the corresponding article in the first edition of the Code of Laws of 1832. Senator Korevo writes in this con-\n\nnection: \"The meaning of the expression used by the legislator - 'a male person of the Imperial House who may have the right of succeeding to the Throne’ - is elucidated when we bear in mind the composition of the Imperial Family in the first quarter of the XlXth century and at the time when the first edition of the Code of Laws was issued, and when we examine one of the-sources of the Fundamental Laws - the Manifesto of 12th December 1825 and the acts appended to it.\" At the time of his accession to the throne in 1825, the Emperor Nicholas I was the only member of the Imperial House who had male issue, Caesarevich Alexander (subsequently Alexander II), who was born in 1818. Nicholas I's other three sons were born in 1827, 1831 and 1832. In such circumstances there was no certainty as to which of these young persons would succeed to the throne in the male line, to say nothing of the possibility of the succession passing to the female line through the posterity of Nicholas I's brother, the Grand Duke Michael. It was expedient, therefore, to adhere to the term \"male person... who may have the right of succeeding to the throne.\"\n\nSubsequently the Imperial House increased in numbers. At the end of the reign of Nicholas I his heir already had four sons, and the position was roughly the same at the end of the reign of Alexander II. With this change of circum- stances the question arose of changing the text of the law. Such a change occurred in the new Statute on the Imperial Family, which was confirmed in 1886 and in which the corresponding article read: \"The marriage of the heir to the throne and of the eldest male person in his issue with a person of another faith may not take place until she has embraced the Orthodox Confession.\"\n\nIn this form, however, this article did not long remain in force. As early as 1889 the Emperor Alexander III, in a Decree to the Senate, commanded that this article in its new form should be withdrawn and that the old version should be restored. The reason for this will become clear when we take account of the position of the Imperial Family in the years 1886-1889. It is true that at that time the composition of the Imperial House was so numerically large that Alexander III limited the number of members of the Imperial House who bore the title of grand duke. Numerical strength of the dynasty, however, is not the only consideration in assessing the state of the succession and in ensuring an Orthodox upbringing of the heir. It is important to consider not only the position of the entire dynasty, but also that of the prob- able heirs. None of the three sons of Alexander III were yet married, and so they were all close to succession to the throne. The eldest, the Caesarevich Nicholas, married after his accession to the throne, and his son, the Caesarevich Alexis, was not born until 1904. In such conditions it was not prudent to require that only the bride of the \"heir appar- ent\" embrace Orthodoxy before marriage. It was desirable to require the same of the brides of the \"heirs presumptive.\"\n\nAs can be seen from the foregoing, our imperial legislation is very flexible in practice. It is not satisfied with a plain distinction between \"heir apparent\" and \"heir presumptive\" in the singular. In its efforts to ensure the Orthodox upbringing of the heir it looks further ahead. If there is an \"heir to the throne,\" it is important that there should also be an \"eldest male person in his issue .\" If there are no such heirs, the definition \"male person... who may have the right of suc- ceeding to the throne\" can refer not only to one person but to two or three. This flexibility in practice is made possible thanks to Article 183: the reigning Emperor can always take into account the state of the succession at a given time and accordingly give or withhold permission for the marriage, demand or not demand that the bride should embrace the Orthodox Confession before marriage. Once permission for such an equal marriage has been given, however, there can be no subsequent loss of right by those who have entered into the marriage or by their posterity.*\n\nIn concluding this chapter it remains for us to say a few words about divorce. This too is a question about which all sorts of legends are being circulated, alleging that divorced persons and their posterity lose their right of succession to the throne, and so on and so forth. In this case there is no parallel to Article 185 - an article that itself could be sub- jected to an analogous process of distortion. In the articles dealing with divorce (194-196) there is not a word saidabout loss of right by divorced persons. With the permission of the reigning Emperors, in the first case Alexander I andin the second case Nicholas II , the marriage of the Grand Duke Constantine was dissolved in 1820 and that of the Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna the Younger with Prince Vilhelm of Sweden, Duke of Soedermanland, in 1914. Equal marriages with divorced persons were contracted by the Grand Dukes Nicholas and Kirill. In the latter case the marriage was atfirst not approved by the reigning Emperor, not because the bride was divorced but because her first husband was the brother of the Empress Consort, Alexandra Feodorovna. Later, however, this marriage was approved by the Emperor, as can be seen from the Decree of 15th July 1907: \"The consort of His Imperial Highness the Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich is to be styled Grand Duchess Victoria Feodorovna, with the title of Imperial Highness, and the daughter born of the mar-\n\n* The absurdity of interpreting Article 185 as depriving of the right of succession all posterity of equal marriages contracted with non-Orthodox persons has evidently penetrated into the minds of some of its proponents. Recently they have voiced in the Russian emigre press a newly invented theory: to wit, that the posterity of such marriages does not lose its right of succession, but that it must, as it were, stand in line awaiting the right of succession to reach them after the extinction of the posterity of marriages con- tracted with Orthodox consorts. If this were indeed the case, one might have expected to see some indication in the articles of the Fundamental Laws or at least in the notes to them. There is none. Nothing is likewise to be found in the lists of Members of the Imperial House in order of succession to the throne available in Court Calendars and in the publications of the Holy Synod press. There is no such indication, no evidence of support whatsoever.\n\nriage of the Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich with the Grand Duchess Victoria Feodorovna, named Maria in holy baptism, is to be recognized as a Princess of the Blood Imperial, with the title of Highness belonging to great-grandchildren of an Emperor.\"\n\nThere is thus provision in the Fundamental Laws for divorce of members of the Imperial House, and divorce of and by itself bears no relation to the right of succession to the throne.\n\nPosition of the Dynasty in Exile\n\nThe fall of the monarchy in 1917 was attended by a number of unconstitutional acts. The Emperor Nicholas II was led by deceit into a situation in which he considered it to be his duty to abdicate on his own behalf and that of his son in favor of his brother the Grand Duke Michael. The constitutional validity of this act is subject to doubt. The act of the Grand Duke Michael, making acceptance of the Crown dependent on the decision of a constituent assembly, was unconstitutional. Kerensky's proclamation of Russia as a republic which followed a few months later, before the convo- cation of the Constituent Assembly, was completely unconstitutional and amounted to making all the previous acts null and void. The unsuccessful outcome of the Civil War can be regarded as the final act of this stage of Russian history.\n\nEarly in the twenties, there arose the urgent problem of ensuring the continuity of the Russian dynasty and of cre- ating conditions in which it would be able, for a period whose duration was impossible to foresee, to safeguard its rights and at any given moment fulfill its dynastic duty. This had to be done on a legal basis, applying the Fundamental Laws to conditions of life in exile. For obvious reasons these laws made no provision either for those conditions or for the revo- lution itself. It was therefore necessary to follow their spirit rather than their letter.\n\nIt is in the light of these considerations that one should examine the two acts that were undertaken by the Head of the Imperial House in the first years of exile. In 1922, when the outcome of the Civil War had beensettled and afterit became clear that the events of 1917 had lost all their dubious validity for solving the future destinies of Russia, the Grand Duke Kirill, senior among the surviving members of the Imperial House of Russia in order of succession, pro- claimed himself Curator of the Throne. The form in which this act was promulgated was conditioned by the uncertainty which still existed about the fate of the Emperor Nicholas II, the Caesarevich Alexis and the Grand Duke Michael. In the course of the following two years the reports on the dastardly assassination of the Imperial Martyrs were irrefutably con- firmed. Consequently, in 1924, the Curator of the Throne assumed the title of Emperor of All the Russias.\n\nThis act was accepted without reservation by the overwhelming majority of the Members of the Imperial House. A critical attitude to the act, however, was adopted by the Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna, on the grounds thatshe had not lost hope that her two sons and grandson were still alive; and by the Grand Dukes Nicholas and Peter and the latter's son Prince Roman, who considered that the question of sovereign power in Russia had to be decided by popular suffrage. None of them, however, questioned the Grand Duke Kirill's rights on the basis of the laws on succes- sion to the throne. All the other members of the Imperial House, who were then quite numerous and represented the three branches of the dynasty, namely the posterity of the Emperor Alexander II and his brothers the Grand Dukes Constantine and Michael, immediately expressed their acceptance of the act. The Grand Duke Alexander stated in a let- ter to the Grand Duke Kirill which was signed by himself and his sons, Princes Andrew, Theodore, Nikita and Rostislav: \"We pray that God may give you the strength to fulfill the onerous task which you have taken upon yourself in obedience to the Fundamental State Laws. We submit ourselves to you and are prepared to serve our beloved motherland in the way in which our fathers and grandfathers served it, following their behests.\" In a postscript it was added that the con- tents of the letter had been communicated to Prince Dimitry, who was then in New York. The youngest son of the Grand Duke Alexander, Prince Vasily, had not yet, according to the Fundamental Laws(Article 198), reached his majority.\n\nIn assuming the Imperial title the Grand Duke Kirill introduced no innovation to the legal history of the monarchi- cal form of government that abounds in precedents for his action which themselves aroused no objections. This act was expedient in the prevailing circumstances for securing the future of the dynasty. It was essential that throughout decades, perhaps many decades, there should always be available a rightful successor to the Emperors of All the Russias who had not lost his Russian identity and who had been brought up in awareness of his rights and duties. This duty has been ful- filled by the Grand Duke Kirill and the Grand Duchess Victoria; it is now being fulfilled by the present Head of the Imperial House and his August Consort, and by their August daughter and August grandson. This is the most important consider- ation, the highest priority.\n\nThere is also to be considered the prestige of the dynasty expressed in its titles. The loss of the title of grand duke would be a great deprivation for the future of the dynasty. And yet, without the act of 1924, such a loss would have taken place. By virtue of the Statute of 1886 promulgated by the Emperor Alexander III the title of grand duke belonged only to the emperor's sons and grandsons in the male line, while his great-grandsons and their posterity had the title of Prince of the Imperial Blood. Here it is also important to establish the intention of the legislator, which is clearly expressed by the Emperor Alexander III in the preamble to the Statute of 1886: \"Having established a firm order of suc- cession to the Throne, Our great-grandfather, the Emperor Paul Petrovich of blessed memory, confirmed on 5th April\n\n1797 a Statute on the Imperial Family in accordance with the then prevailing position of the Empire and composition of the Imperial issue, which guaranteed uninterrupted succession to the Throne. The increase in the Imperial issue which, since that time, by the grace of God has been continuing serves as a reliable guarantee for Our Motherland, secur- ing for the future a rightful inheritance of sovereign power. Deeming it right, in accordance with the present position of the Empire and composition of our Family, to make some changes in the Statute of 5th April 1797 in accordancewith directives which We have issued We have entrusted this task to a Special Commission...\" The legislator's intention here could not be clearer. The last thing that could have formed part of his intention, as is clear from the preamble tothe statute quoted above, was to lower the dignity of the dynasty by abolishing the title of grand duke itself. Like the other laws of the Russian Empire, the Emperor Alexander Ill's statute did not provide for the eventuality of a revolution. But after the revolution had taken place and there arose the pressing heed to preserve the dynasty for the future, an act was necessary to define the position of the dynasty in exile. Thus we have the Manifesto of 31st August 1924 on the assumption of the Imperial title by the Grand Duke Kirill.\n\nAfter the death of the Grand Duke Kirill in 1938, his successor, the Grand Duke Wladimir, the present Head of the Imperial House, issued a manifesto in which he declared that he had inherited all the rights and duties of his imperial ancestors. Nothing was said in this manifesto about title. The Grand Duke Wladimir’s Chancellery published two circu- lars. One stated that the Head of the Imperial House would retain for himself the title of grand duke; the other, that some persons had already sworn an oath of allegiance to him as emperor and that he had accepted their oath. This state of affairs was accepted without objection by all Russian emigres who were not hostile to Russia's historical tradition. There were no objections from foreign royal courts and the existing situation was reflected in official reference books. Thus, thanks to the act of the Grand Duke Kirill, the position of the Russian dynasty in conditions of exile was established. The Head of the Imperial House inherits all the rights and duties of his imperial ancestors, and this includes the title of emper- or. He can use, or not use, this title at his discretion. Regardless of whether he uses this title, its existence in his heritage confers the title of grand duke on his posterity in the order established in the Statute of 1886.\n\nOn the House of the Bagratids\n\nThe august Consort of the present Head of the Imperial House, the Grand Duchess Leonida Georgievna, was born Princess Bagration of Mukhrani, a member of the Royal House of Georgia. The Bagratids are one of the oldest dynas- ties in the world, and later in this chapter we shall say a few words about its history. Let us first examine its present dynas- tic position.\n\nIn 1946,before the. Grand Duke Wladimir was acquainted with his future Consort (whom he married two years later), he received an inquiry from a member of the Royal House of Spain, the Infante Don Fernando, Prince of Bavaria, whose contents the Grand Duke made public in an Act issued on 5th December 1946:\n\n\"His Royal Highness the Infante Don Fernando, Prince of Bavaria, when his daughter the Infante Mercedes was about to contract a marriage with Prince Irakly Bagration of Mukhrani, asked me whether, taking into account the independence of Georgia from 1918 to 1921 and the present position of her Royal Family, I would consider the proposed marriage to be an equal one.\n\n\"My reply, which was conveyed to the Infante through the intermediary of the Spanish Minister in Berne, the Conde de Bailen, was in the affirmative, inasmuch as, after prolonged and diligent study of the history of Georgia and of the Georgian question, and after consulting my uncle His Imperial Highness the Grand Duke Andrew, brother of my late Father, and my advisers, and after correspondence with the historian, Professor M. Muskelishvili, I consider it right and proper to recognize the royal status of the sen- ior branch of the Bagration family, as well as the right of its members to bear the title of Prince of Georgia and the style of Royal Highness. The present head of this family is Prince George.\"\n\nOne should recall here that the Grand Duke Andrew, who was a jurist by education, was then the best living authority on the Russian laws of succession. Both he and another member of the Imperial House with whom the Grand Duke Wladimir was in consultation, the Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna the Younger, were of the opinion that today the legal position of the Houses of Romanoff and of the Bagratids was identical, as both were former ruling dynasties.\n\nThus, when two years later the Grand Duke Wladimir himself decided to contract a marriage with a member of the House of the Bagratids, the question of the equality of this marriage was no longer raised. It had already been set- tled by his Act of 5th December 1946, an act obligatory for all members of the Imperial House by virtue of Article 219 of the Fundamental Laws: \"The reigning Emperor must in every case be regarded as Head of all the Imperial Family and as its trustee and protector.\"\n\nThis matter should by now be crystal clear. In view, nonetheless, of the fact that so many people are poorly informed about it, we shall add a few words about the history of the Dynasty of the Bagratids, both before and after the incorporation in 1801 of Georgia into the Russian Empire.\n\nFrom the remote past Georgia was an Orthodox kingdom in surroundings that were not Orthodox and, to a con- siderable extent, not even Christian. Times of prosperity and might were followed by periods of disintegration and decline. Like Russia, Georgia suffered the yoke of the Golden Horde, and later she was forced to endure ever persist- ent threats and invasions of the Shahs of Persia and the Sultans of Turkey. Through all of this, no matter whether they were the sovereigns of a united, independent, and mighty kingdom or the hapless vassals of Muslim overlords, the Bagratids always remained for the Georgians their kings who shared intimately with them their joys and their sorrows.\n\nGeorgia had very ancient ties to Russia which date from the Middle Ages and grew more intimate as the power of the Tsars of Moscow became greater. Let us consider more closely Georgia's relations with Russia in the eighteenth century. By this time Georgia had rid herself of the Persian yoke under the leadership of one of her most outstanding sov- ereigns, King Irakly II. Although Georgia was then independent, the ancient kingdom had, nonetheless, been split and another branch of the Bagratids occupied the throne of Imeretia. King Irakly had no illusions. He was clearly aware of the weakness of his position and was convinced that, sooner or later, Persia and Turkey would renew their efforts to con- quer Georgia. He realized that he could not withstand their invasion with his own forces. He decided, therefore, toseek the help of Russia and to concede to her certain of his suzerain rights. As a result, a treaty of alliance between Russia and Georgia was concluded at Georgievsk on 24th June 1783, by virtue of which the Empress Catherine II took Georgia under her protection and Russia was given control over Georgia's foreign policy. At the same time, Russia promised \"to respect the independence of Georgia and that henceforth Irakly II, as professing the same faith as Ours and as an ally of Russia, bears the title of King of Georgia, in which title and rights he and his issue are confirmed by Russia for ever and for all time...\"\n\nUnfortunately, this treaty was violated and Georgia was again invaded by the Turks and the Persians. They were firmly resisted by King Irakly, now an old man in failing health stricken with grief after the death of his favorite son Levani. He died at the beginning of 1798 and was succeeded by his son George XII, a weak and sick man. The Shah of Persia, Fath Ali, tried to woo him away from Russia, but King George did not fall into this trap. His brother Alexander, however, was an open enemy of Russia and acted in concert with Omar, Khan of the Avars, an ally of Turkey. In these circumstances the Emperor Paul I found it necessary to send troops to Georgia, and in 1800 two Russian battalions under the com- mand of General Lazarev arrived in Tiflis. King George's loyalty was not in doubt. In the previous year his sons loanne and Bagrat had inflicted a defeat on their hostile uncle Alexander. King George himself, however, was by now mortally sick with dropsy and dark clouds loomed on the horizon. The king tried to secure the succession for his son David, and the draft of a new treaty to replace the Treaty of Georgievsk of 1783 had already been drawn up. According to this draft Georgia was to be more closely tied to the Russian Empire, but the tenure of the throne by the Bagratids was neverthe- less guaranteed. King George, however, died in December 1800 before thedraft could become a treaty. Prince Daviddid not venture to proclaim his accession and in January 1801 the manifesto on the incorporation of Georgia into the Russian Empire was issued.\n\nThus the promise made by Russia at the conclusion of the Treaty of Georgievsk was not kept. We shall not engage here in criticism of the motives that prompted this change of policy. No doubt there were weighty reasons, but, speak- ing in plain human language, one is bound to say that this change of policy, bordering on breach of faith, can hardly be viewed by any Russian without a feeling of regret. In any case, one thing is certain: whatever considerations of expedi- ency made the Russian authorities regard it as essential to take the administration of Georgia under their direct control, these did not free Russia from her promise to the House of the Bagratids as a dynasty at the signing of the Treaty of Georgievsk. The Bagrations found themselves in the same position as later the dynasty of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies after the formation of the Kingdom of Italy and the dynasty of Montenegro after the formation of Yugoslavia, the position of a dynasty which has lost its throne. The Bagrations remain the members of an ancient dynasty that had ruled for many centuries and then by historical fortuity lost their thrones. In the future, whatever their prospects for regaining power, they could not be deprived by any acts of anyone of their position of having been a line of sovereigns that had once ruled.\n\nAfter the incorporation of Georgia into the Russian Empire the sons of King George XII settled in Russia. They themselves bore the title of Tsarevich, and their posterity and relatives held the title of Prince. King Irakly II's son Alexander continued to maintain a hostile position. He spent a long time in Dagestan and according to legend wide- spread in the area Shamil was his natural son. In Tiflis itself the embers of resistance smoldered for a long time, culminat- ing as late as1830 in the \"Nobles' Plot\" aimed at a restoration of the Bagrations.\n\nIn Russia the Bagrations took part in the social life of their Russian contemporaries and many of them served in the armed forces of the Russian Empire. From this some draw the conclusion that the Bagrations thereby forfeited their royal status and were equated as Russian subjects to the Russian nobility. And yet the future King of the Belgians, Leopold I and later Prince Jaime de Bourbon and Prince Napoleon Bonaparte, also served in the armed forces of the Russian Empire, without prejudice to their dynastic status. In fact, the position of the two last named princes was analogous to that of the Bagrations. Both belonged to dynasties that had lost their thrones. It is quite likely that there were people in Russia poorly acquainted with Georgia's past and unaware of the promise made by Russia to the House of the Bagratids, who equated the Bagrations with Russian nobles of non-royal status. One cannot, however, draw from such groundless opinions, no matter how exalted their proponents may have been, any deductions about what the status of the Bagrations really was.\n\nWhat is important is that the Bagrations themselves never renounced their royal status and that, on the part of the Russian authorities, no statements were ever made on this matter. The question simply did not arise, not even in 1911 when Tatiana Konstantinovna, a Princess of the Imperial Blood, entered into marriage with Prince Bagration Mukhransky. Before doing so, she renounced her right of succession to the throne. As has already been pointed out, no deductions can be made from this about the dynastic status of Prince Bagration Mukhransky, seeing that a similar renunciation was made by the Grand Duchess Olga before her marriage to the King of Wurttemberg. In each case such a renunciation was undertaken at the discretion of the reigning emperor and affected only the person making it. There was never any ques- tion of posterity, since, according to the Fundamental Laws, a member of the Imperial House could renounce only his own right of succession. The sole exception to this was the abdication of the Emperor Nicholas II for himself and for his son. The conditions, however, in which the misled and betrayed Emperor was compelled to sign this act of abdication excludes all possibility of regarding this act as a supplement to the Fundamental Laws.\n\nAs a result of the tragic consequences of this act by Emperor Nicholas II, both the Imperial House of Russia and the Royal House of Georgia found themselves in an identical position of being royal dynasties without thrones. The relations which had existed between them from 1801 to 1917, wherever they may have been, had receded into the past. At first the destinies of Russia and Georgia followed different ways. In Russia communism triumphed in October 1917. Georgia was an independent State from 1918 to 1921. In 1921 communism triumphed also in Georgia. At present Georgia is a Union Republic within the U.S.S.R and, by legal fiction a sovereign state possessing in theory the right of secession from the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 1946 an opportunity arose for the Grand Duke Wladimir to remove the injustice that lay on the conscience of the Russian State by publicly declaring his recognition of the royal status of the House of the Bagratids. By this act the legal side of this question was fully and finally settled.\n\nThis question, however, has not only a legal, but also a very important political significance. The new era in the history of the Russian monarchy must open with account being taken of new conditions which were unknown to the Russian monarchy in the past or which at that time were only faintly reflected. The national awareness which has now matured in every people of the Russian State will best be reflected and satisfied in a marriage between the successor of the Russian sovereigns of the past and a princess of the royal house of one of the other peoples forming the multination- al family of our empire. Such a marriage,in fact, took place when the Grand Duke Wladimir married the daughter of the Royal House of Georgia. This was a fitting initiation of a new era for the Russian monarchy. We, who believe in the future of the Russian monarchy, can only regard this marriage as providential.\n\nEnsuring the Future of the Dynasty\n\nWhen, on 23rd December 1969, the Grand Duchess Maria was sixteen years old and reached her dynastic majority, the Grand Duke Wladimir issued two Messages to the Peoples of Russia, the texts of which the reader will find in the Appendix. The first of these messages contains an act on the institution of a Curatorship of the Imperial Throne of Russia in the person of his daughter, to take effect on the demise of the Grand Duke. The second message is a public announcement of the oath of loyalty to the Grand Duke sworn by the Grand Duchess Maria, with the obligation of observ- ing the provisions on succession to the throne as propounded in the Fundamental Laws.\n\nThe first Message elucidates the present position of the Imperial House of Russia and the provisions of the law on the succession passing to the female line. It also contains the Act on the Institution of the Curatorship of the Throne : \"The institution of Curatorship of the Throne is being promulgated in accordance with, on the example of and with the prerogatives accruing to the Institution of Regency, provided for in the Fundamental Laws, with a Council attached to the Curatrix, the composition of which will be announced in due time.\" There can be various reasons for instituting a regency.\n\nIn the majority of cases it was instituted to function during the minority of a monarch. As examples of great mon- archs whose reigns were initiated by regencies, one could cite the Russian Tsars Ivan IV (wrongfully called the “Terrible”, where a better translation would be the “Thunderous” or the “Stern”), Ivan V and his brother, the Emperor Peter the Great, as well as King Louis XIV of France and Alfonzo XIII of Spain. There were also cases of a regency being instituted when a monarch became insane, as in the case of George III in England. In other cases a regency was instituted under circumstances in which, for one reason or another, the monarch was in fact deprived of the possibility of exercising his sovereign authority in his country; examples of this were the regencies of Admiral Horthy in Hungary and of Archbishop Damaskinos in Greece.\n\nAs should be expected, there is no enumeration of all these possibilities in the Fundamental Laws, for the simple reason that they cannot all be foreseen in advance. Who in the nineteenth century, for instance, could have foreseen the\n\ncircumstances in which the regencies of Admiral Horthy and of Archbishop Damaskinos were instituted? Even so these circumstances did arise and corresponding measures had to be taken. Circumstances of another kind, such as we can- not foresee at present, may arise in the future. In the Fundamental Laws we find no directives on the measures which should be taken in such circumstances, but we do find in them an indication of the spirit in which these measures should be taken. In Article 43 it is stated: \"The appointment of regent and guardian, either jointly in one person or separatelyin two persons, depends on the will and discretion of the reigning emperor who, for better security, should make this provision for the case of his demise.\" Article 52 states: \"Appointment of the council and selection of the members there- of are provided for in case of absence of other directives fromthedeceasedsovereign, towhomthecircum- stances and the persons should have been known.\" The words \"for better security\" and \"to whom the circumstances and the persons should have been known\" presume the possibility of the occurrence of an abnormal situation - a possibility of which the reigning emperor is aware and for the prevention of which he should take the appropriate measures.\n\nIt was in this spirit that the Act of the Grand Duke Wladimir of 23rd December 1969 was issued. The possibilityof the occurrence of an abnormal situation stems from the unfriendly attitude of certain members of the Imperial House to the Grand Duke and to his family. From some of their statements one could conclude that they had dissociated them- selves from the position taken by the late Grand Duke Alexander and expressed in his letter to the Grand Duke Kirill in 1924 quoted above, signed by the Grand Duke Alexander and four of his sons. The possibility was not excluded that, if any one of them were to succeed the Grand Duke Wladimir as Head of the Imperial House, he would not consider him- self bound to observe Articles 25-39 of the Fundamental Laws and would be prepared to infringe on the legitimate rights of the Grand Duchess Maria.\n\nThus arose a danger for the future of the dynasty and a danger also for the future of the monarchy itself in Russia which may legitimately be compared with the danger that arises when the heir to throne loses his reason. In such cases the reigning emperor, or in present circumstances the Head of the Imperial House, takes the necessary measures for averting this danger. This is what the Grand Duke Wladimir did in his Act of 23rd December 1969, thereby safeguarding the legitimate rights of his daughter and her posterity.\n\nIn recent years we have witnessed two important events: the wedding of the daughter of the Head of the Imperial House and the birth of her son. In September 1976 the Grand Duchess Maria married prince Franz-Wilhelm of Prussia, who became Prince Michael after embracing the Orthodox Faith before marriage and Grand Duke Michael of Russia after the marriage. This was not the first time that such an alliance had taken place between the Imperial House of Russia and the Royal House of Prussia. Born into that dynasty was the Empress Alexandra, Consort of the Emperor Nicholas I. An ability to associate their destiny with their adopted country has always been a noteworthy feature of those members of German royal and ruling houses who entered into marriage with members of other dynasties, especially with future monarchs. This applies not only to German princesses, but also to the princes who were destined to play their part in circumstances that were new to them, such as Prince Albert of Saxe Coburg-Gotha, the Consort of Queen Victoria and the ancestor both of the Grand Duchess Maria and of the Grand Duke Michael.\n\nThe august Consort of the Grand Duchess Maria embraced the Orthodox Faith before marriage, and he did this out of deep personal conviction, after study of the doctrine and practice of the Holy Orthodox Church. The spirit of the law was observed, moreover providing for an Orthodox upbringing of the future heir. This heir was born on 13th March 1981 and was named Georgy in holy baptism. Of this we can be fully assured: the young Grand Duke will be brought up in the Russian spirit and in full awareness of his position and duties. We are assured of this by the examples set bythe late Grand Duke Kirill and Grand Duchess Victoria in the upbringing of their son the Grand Duke Wladimir, and by the Grand Duke Wladimir and his Consort in the rearing of their daughter. On one occasion the headmaster of one of the best and oldest schools in England approached the Grand Duke Kirill with an offer to take his son into his school. This offer was declined, mainly at the initiative of the Grand Duchess Victoria, on the grounds that, however excellent was the secondary education offered at that boarding school, the young grand duke might lose his Russian identity there. Instead, he received excellent education in Russian at home and matriculated at the Russian gymnasium in Paris. The Grand Duke Wladimir and the Grand Duchess Leonida were guided by the same spirit in bringing up their daughter. Living in Spain and in Brittany, she was taught from childhood to speak faultless Russian and measures were taken to pro- vide her with a good knowledge of Russian history and with full awareness of the part which by her birth she was des- tined to play. Whenthe time came for her to matriculate into Oxford University, Russian language and literature ware the subjects which she chose to study.\n\nLet us then pray to the King of Kings that He may grant His good mercy in all things to the Head of the Imperial House and to all his august Family, and that He may grant many years of happiness and health to the young Grand Duke Georgy Mikhaylovich, for the good and prosperity of the sovereign House of Romanov. Let every one of us contributehis mite* to the cause of delivering our motherland from the yoke of the godless regicides, so that she may once again enjoy happiness and prosperity under the scepter of the Imperial House of Russia.\n\n*St. Mark XII:41-44\n\nAPPENDIX TOPART TWO\n\nI. RELEVANT ARTICLES OF THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS (On the supreme power of the Monarch:)\n\n4. Supreme sovereign power belongs to the Emperor of All the Russias. Obedience to this power, not only outof fear but for the sake of conscience, is ordained by God Himself.\n\n5. The person of the Lord Emperor is sacrosanct and inviolable.\n\n6. The same supreme sovereign power belongs to the Lady empress when succession to the Throne, in the order thereunto established, reaches a female person; but her consort is not regarded as emperor; he equally enjoys the honours and privileges available to consorts of emperors, except the title.\n\n(The inviolable articles 25-39 on order of succession to the Throne:)\n\n25. The Imperial Throne of All the Russias is hereditary within the Imperial House now happily reigning.\n\n26. Inseparable from the Imperial Throne of All the Russias are the Thrones of the Kingdom of Poland and of the Grand Duchy of Finland.\n\n27. Both sexes have the right of succession to the Throne; but this right belongs by preference to the male sex in order of primogeniture; with the extinction of the last male issue succession to the Throne passes to the female issue by right of substitution.\n\n28. Accordingly, succession to the Throne belongs in the first place to the eldest son of the reigning Emperor, and after him to all his male issue.\n\n29. With the extinction of this male issue, succession passes to the branch of the second son of the Emperor and his male issue; with the extinction of the second male issue, succession passes to the branch of the third son, and so on.\n\n30. When the last male issue of the Emperor's sons is extinct, succession remains in the same branch, but in the female issue of the last reigning Emperor, as being nearest to the Throne, and therein it follows the same order, with pref- erence to a male over a female person; but the female person from whom this right directly proceeds never loses this right.\n\n31. With the extinction of this branch succession passes to the female issue of the branch of the eldest son of the emperor-progenitor, wherein the nearest relative of the last reigning emperor in the branch of this son succeeds, the eldest in the descending lines, by a collateral line, or, when there is no such relative available, the male or female person who takes her place by substitution, with preference, as above, for a male over a female person.\n\n32. When these branches too are extinct succession passes to the female issue of the other sons of the emper- or-progenitor, following the same order, and after, that to the male issue of the eldest daughter of the emperor-progenitor; and when that too is extinct to her female issue, following the order established for the female issue of the emperor's sons.\n\n33. With the extinction of the male and female issue of the eldest daughter of the emperor-progenitor, succes- sion passes first to the male and then to the female issue of the second daughter of the emperor-progenitor, and so on.\n\n34. A younger sister, even if she has sons, does not take the right away from an elder sister who is not even mar- ried; but a younger brother succeeds before his elder sisters.\n\n35. When the succession reaches a female branch which is already reigning on another throne, it is left to the person who succeeds to make a choice of faith and throne and, together with that person's heir, to renounce the other faith and throne, if such a throne is tied with a religious denomination; if there is no renunciation of faith, the succession passes to the person next in order.\n\n36. Children issuing from a marriage of a person of the Imperial Family with a person not having the correspon- ding dignity, that is to say, not belonging to a royal or ruling house, have no right of succession to the Throne.\n\n37. In the operation of the rules on the order of succession to the Throne enunciated above, a person who has such a right of succession is free to abdicate from this right in circumstances in which such an abdication does not cre- ate any difficulty in the future succession to the Throne.\n\n38. Such an abdication, when it has been made public and acquires the force of law, becomes irrevocable.\n\n39. An emperor or empress succeeding to the Throne undertake, at their accession and at their anointment, solemnly to observe the aforesaid laws on succession to the Throne.\n\n(On the majority of sovereigns of both sexes and of the heir and on regency and guardianship whena minor emperor succeeds to the Throne:)\n\n40. Sovereigns of both sexes and the heir to the Imperial Throne reach their majority at the age of sixteen.\n\n41. When an emperor younger than this age succeeds to the Throne a regency and a guardianship are institut- ed to last until he has reached his majority.\n\n42. The regency and the guardianship are instituted jointly in one person or separately, in which case one per- son is entrusted with the regency and the other with the guardianship.\n\n43. The appointment of regent and guardian, either jointly in one person or separately in two persons, depends on the will and discretion of the reigning emperor who, for better security, should make this provision in the case of his demise.\n\n44. When no such appointment has been made in the lifetime of an emperor, regency of the State and guardian- ship of the minor emperor belong to his father or mother; but his father-in-law and mother-in-law are excluded.\n\n45. When there is no father or mother, regency and guardianship belong to the nearest in succession to the Throne among the minor emperor's major relatives of both sexes.\n\n46. The legal reasons disqualifying one for tenure of regency and guardianship are: (1) insanity, even if tempo- rary; (2) remarriage during tenure of regency or guardianship.\n\n47. A regent of the State must have a regency council; there can be neither a regent without a council or a coun- cil without a regent.\n\n48. The council consists of six persons of the first two classes selected by the regent, who can appoint othersas changes arise.\n\n49. Members of the Imperial Family of the male sex can attend sessions of this council at the choice of the regent, but not before reaching their majority . They are not included in the number of the six persons constituting the council.\n\n50. The regency council deals with all matters without exception which are subject to the decision of the emper- or himself and with all matters which are submitted to him and to his council; but the council is not concerned with guardianship.\n\n51. The regent has the casting vote.\n\n52. Appointment of the council and selection of the members thereof are provided for in case of the absence of other directives from the deceased sovereign, to whom the circumstances and the persons should have been known.\n\n(On accession to the Throne and oath of allegiance:)\n\n53. On the demise of an emperor his heir accedes to the Throne by virtue of the law of succession itself, which confers this right upon him. The accession of an emperor to the Throne is counted from the day of the demise of his predecessor.\n\n54. In the manifesto on accession to the Throne the rightful heir to the Throne is also named, if a person to whom succession belongs by law exists.\n\n55. Allegiance to the newly acceded emperor and to his rightful heir, even if the latter is not named in the man- ifesto, is confirmed by a nationwide oath.\n\n(Here follow articles; 56, on the oath and the procedure of taking it; 57-58,\n\non coronation and anointment; 59-61, on the title of His Imperial Majesty and the State arms.)\n\nOn faith:\n\n62. The leading and predominant faith in the Russian Empire is the Christian Orthodox Catholic faith of the Eastern confession.\n\n63. The emperor who possesses the Throne of All the Russias cannot profess any faith other than the Orthodox.\n\n64. The emperor, as a Christian sovereign, is the supreme defender and guardian of the dogmas of the predom- inant faith and watches over the purity of Faith and all good order in the holy Church.\n\n65. In church administration the sovereign power acts through the instrumentality of the Most Holy Governing Synod instituted by it.\n\n(Section Two of the Fundamental Laws - the Statute on the Imperial Family.) (On degrees of kinship in the Imperial House:)\n\n126. All persons of the Blood Imperial who are the issue of a lawful marriage with a person of corresponding dignity authorized by the reigning emperor are recognized as Members of the Imperial House.\n\n127. All members of the Imperial House consider their degree according to their kinship with the emperor from whom they are descended in direct line, without confusing it with their nearer kinship with subsequent emperors who acceded to the Throne after the progenitor of their family.\n\n128. The eldest son of the emperor and all the eldest issue of the eldest branch, as long as the Imperial Family exists, are respected and considered, in the eyes of the emperor, as heirs to the Throne and bear the name of children of the sovereign.\n\n129. All younger sons of the emperor or the issue of branches younger than him, that is to say, all except the firstborn, are regarded, at their birth, as sons of the sovereign.\n\n130. The second and all younger sons of elder branches, as sons of a person capable of substituting an heir to the Throne, are considered to be on an equal footing with the sons of the sovereign, with all the rights appertaining to them.\n\n131. All issue of the younger branches have and enjoy privileges according to their degree of kinship with the emperor from whom they are descended, even if a third person of an older branch were to be on the throne, and con- sequently they cannot expect, seek or demand any other privileges, except when succession to the Throne reaches them or when their brother accedes to the Throne.\n\n132. Persons of the female sex who are issue of a male branch, in their degrees of kinship, are considered on the same basis as persons of the male sex, that is to say: the daughter of an elder per"
