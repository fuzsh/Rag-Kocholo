        "text": "The Grand Duchesses in 1916\n\nLeft to right: Olga, Tatiana, Maria, Anastasia\n\nThe escape of the Grand Duchesses of Russia: Olga, Tatiana, Maria and Anastasia, was probably the single most talked about story of the late 1910’s. Four Russian royals had been run out of their homeland and into the arms of the English. They left behind their parents, their brother and everything that had been their lives in the early summer of 1917 when, fearing that the offer of asylum for their family would be withdrawn, Nicholas II, Tsar of Russia, and his wife, had sent their children in three parties to escape Russia: Olga and Maria travelled in one party of four (an older servant couple pretended to be their parents), Tatiana and Anastasia in a party of three (one man pretended to be their elder brother), and Alexey with a servant (serving as his father) charged with his care, although not one of great importance, which would prove the wrong choice. The first party managed to escape to a ship, which arrived on May 3rd in England. A week later, the second party arrived, also in England.\n\nThe third party made it as far as the coast of Russia, when the Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich was half recognised by an official, who questioned the two travellers. Reportedly, the Tsarevich kept to his story, claiming he was travelling with his father to America, first stopping in England, then a round trip to see the world before settling in California. However, the servant bungled his lies, and when he was tasked with explaining himself, he told the truth, and the two were roughly escorted to Tobolsk in the Urals, where the royal couple were effectively imprisoned. While happy to have one of their children with them, the royal couple were also distraught that their son had not made it to safety, and upon hearing the servant he had travelled with had been executed, the trio mourned what might have been.\n\nThe Grand Duchess Anastasia at her writing desk (circa 1918)\n\nIn England, with letters of proof and the recognition by the government, the Grand Duchesses were treated both with sympathy and suspicion. Yes, they were pretty and tragic and spoke English almost flawlessly, but they also brought potential war with a volatile Russia, and the expense of caring for a quartet of girls supposedly used to the finest Russia had to offer. However, the four were given lodging in London, where the King of the United Kingdom visited them regularly, often with the Prince of Wales, who’s popularity allowed the Grand Duchesses some lift in popularity in their new home.\n\nIn August of 1917, news was finally leaked from Russia surrounding the escape of the Tsarevich, and despite it’s assertion that Alexey was fine and healthy, the four girls refused visitors for almost a month in their grief, ending their self-imposed imprisonment when the government of Russia underwent yet another major shift, this time to the Bolsheviks. With this, they privately and publicly begged the King of the United Kingdom, with Anastasia penning the famous ‘Saviour Letter’.\n\nTo our friend The King of England,\n\nYou might be our saviour, if you help bring our family together once more. My sisters and I must humbly beg you, in your infinite mercy and kindness, to bring our father back to us, and our mother, and our dear brother. We have been degraded and humiliated by those who seek to blame us, but it was Russia that was at fault, not we.\n\nI know we are a burden, and our constant favours might seem unending, but we have seen ourselves lost to a civil war against the fabric of our monarchy, and as it spreads, do we not deserve the safety that any family might give it’s cousins.\n\nWe beseech you, to save us again, to be our saviour.\n\nTo those who love and respect you,\n\nThe Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna, your humble servant\n\nThe letter was a bomb to the English conscience and one that the King of the United Kingdom both felt moved and enraged by. He knew where it had come from, but he would never quite forgive the Grand Duchess for what he saw as a way to humiliate him to action. That being said, he did send instructions to treat with the new Russian Government for the release of the disposed Russian Royal family, with instructions that he expected at least the Empress to be released by the end of the year. It was a hard task and, as it turned out, almost impossible.\n\nBut while the King responded angrily but with action, the Prince of Wales was all sympathy, and in late September, he escorted the Grand Duchesses to a party, and in early October, did the same, but only for the Grand Duchess Olga. It was a move that meant rumours spread the two would be married sooner rather than later, with dates suggested for April of the next year, once, in theory, the Russian Royal family had arrived in England, to await the end of the Revolution and return to Russia as potential constitutional monarchs. There was a distinct lack of understanding by many as to the magnitude of the situation, but as the year passed and the Bolsheviks refused to release even the Empress, it soon became clear that things were not to be so easy.\n\nThe Grand Duchesses Olga (right) and Tatiana (left) in informal mourning while in the country. (1918)\n\nWith that news, the four Grand Duchesses fell into a chaos of grief. The four seemed mad to many that met them, and the Grand Duchess Tatiana was said to have clung the Princess Royale, who had begun making consistent trips to the sisters with her brother. Anastasia, the youngest, seems to have taken a leadership role within the family, as it was she, and not Olga, who ordered mourning clothes and sent statements to papers, effectively protecting her elder sisters from at least a portion of the real world issues. It was only on April 18th that the King and Queen of the United Kingdom visited the four girls, although it was not without ulterior motive. You see, with the Emperor and his son dead, the King wanted to see if the Grand Duchess Olga had any pretensions to the title of Tsar.\n\nIt was a second crushing blow for the eldest Grand Duchess, who had lost her parents and brother, to realise that she was now, for many, the new political figurehead of the Aristocratic Russian exiles. While she was not technically the next in line, news that her uncle had also been murdered reached the royal sisters in late April, and on May 3rd, 1918, she signed her own form of abdication, agreeing to give up any form of claim for her or her children to the Russian Throne. In her own words, “I have given up Russia. Let the monsters have it.”\n\nSympathy for the sisters in England was at an all time high, although the Grand Duchess Tatiana managed to spoil part of it by refusing to also abdicate, claiming that she thought the problem was with those now in power, and monarchy might reign again. However, with the abdication of her other sisters, the British press found themselves writing constantly of the Russian Princesses in their London House, beautiful in black, hidden and mysterious.\n\nThey held an informal funeral in their parlour on May 18th, with attendance from the Prince of Wales, the Princess Royale, Lord Mountbatten and his mother, their Aunt the Princess of Battenberg. Others who had known them were also invited, but all up, including the Grand Duchesses and their servants, there was 12 in attendance, small as it was. Three of the four girls said speeches, with the exception of the Grand Duchess Maria, who could not bring herself to, and instead was comforted by Lord Mountbatten and his mother. The Princess of Battenberg also spoke of her sister, and at the end, every attendant placed a flower at the portraits of the Tsar, Tsarina and the Tsarevich.\n\nThe Lord and Lady Mountbatten on their honeymoon in 1919.\n\nAnastasia continued her leadership position amongst the family, asking if, due to the continual attention by the public and press, they might be moved to a country house to mourn in private. It was a request that was granted, and the four girls left in early June for Hever Castle, offered to them by William Waldorf Astor, an American Millionaire who was sympathetic to the Grand Duchesses. He also insisted on paying for their expenses, saying “Those girls need a bit of pampering.”\n\nHe also seems to have seen the potential for some real royal blood for his family, and he frequently sent his grandchildren, particularly his eldest grandson, to entertain the girls. However, the Grand Duchesses were not of a mood to be entertained, and soon the visits became more infrequent. However, they never truly stopped, and many though the Grand Duchess Anastasia and William Astor Jnr. might make a match soon enough.\n\nHowever, few forgot the supposed engagement between the Prince of Wales and the Grand Duchess Olga, who became the subject of a series of stories entitles “The Princess in Exile”, which was ended at her request after a particularly brutal chapter was released in which the Princess “Elena” watched her brother beaten by rebels. It was an insensitive moment for the Press, and the paper that ran it would be heavily criticised for it’s callousness. However, it was soon forgotten was the love affair between the Grand Duchess and the papers continued, with her keeping a book filled with clippings from each and every story about her and her sisters. It seems to have been a way for her to cope with the losses of the past year, and while some worried for her dependency on the public’s love for her, one man encouraged it: The Prince of Wales.\n\nThe Prince, now called David by all four of the Grand Duchesses, now actually began to court the exiled Grand Duchess. The Grand Duchesses returned to London in late November for almost a fortnight, supposedly to meet with lawyers surrounding what to do about Russia, but also for Olga to come with the Prince for his grandmother’s birthday on December 1st, where she emphatically supported the two’s hopes for matrimony.\n\nBut Olga was not destined to be the first to marry. On January 4th, 1919, the Grand Duchess Maria begun the process through which she would convert to Anglicanism, relinquish all pretensions to the Russian Throne a second time for safety, and thus be able to marry the Lord Mountbatten. They were married in April of 1919, in a private ceremony.\n\nThe Grand Duchesses (left to right) Olga, Tatiana and Anastasia play dress up after Maria is gone, in 1919.\n\nThe Grand Duchesses were reunited with their grandmother and two aunts in May of 1919, when the HMS Marlborough brought the Dowager Empress and the Grand Duchesses Xenia and Olga. The arrival of family they had feared would die at the hands of the revolutionaries was something extremely special for the four girls, although the realisation that Maria had managed to get married in the meantime meant the Dowager Empress was less than impressed. However, there was an air of joy surrounding the reunited family.\n\nWith the Grand Duchess Maria married, Olga found herself stifled by her hopes to marry the Prince of Wales. By this point, the English royal family was coming around, but her grandmother and aunt, new to the situation, were only now learning of the situation. She wanted to be married, but her aunts wondered why she couldn’t marry a Russian Prince or a Danish Prince instead. However, the Grand Duchess found her newfound independence something she was unwilling to give up, and thus, in August, she officially converted herself to Anglicanism, and moved from Hever Castle, where her sisters Tatiana and Anastasia remained, to the London home Lord Mountbatten and her sister, now Lady Mountbatten, had bought to live in.\n\nSuch a break in the recently reunited family was saddening, and it’s said that this leaving placed Anastasia in the position she would be in when she married her cousin, Prince Feodor Alexandrovich of Russia, in January of 1920. The prevailing story, and the one she would tell herself in later years, was that with Olga away and Tatiana unwilling to even consider marriage, the Dowager Empress and her daughters smothered Anastasia, already of a mind to keep the family safe and together. Eventually, she gave in, and it’s said that she agreed on Christmas Day. Thus, the new couple would leave England in June of that year, arriving in France, where they began what would be 10 years of a horror marriage. With no money and no skills other than his ability to drive, he got work as a taxi driver, and the two lived with the Princess Irena Alexandrovna, his sister, and her husband the Prince Felix Yusupov.\n\nThat left the Grand Duchess Tatiana in Hever Castle, now in constant attendance by the Astor family. Where her sisters had all found beaus (although such a sweet word is unfair for such a marriage as the Grand Duchess Anastasia’s) she herself remained above such matters. Tatiana was, for many, the one who had inherited her mother’s coolness and, slowly, found herself isolated from her family. Her sisters would all be at least engaged by the end of 1920 (with the announcement of a March wedding for the Prince of Wales and the Grand Duchess Olga formally told to the public in November) but she herself found it easier to join the Astor family dynamic.\n\nThe Wedding Day: (left to right) Prince Feodor, Edward the Prince of Wales, the Grand Duchess Olga and the Grand Duchess Anastasia.\n\nThe birth of Lord Henry Mountbatten in early 1920 went surprisingly unnoticed, for the birth of the first child of the Grand Duchesses of fame and note. That being said, the Grand Duchess Maria, who would use her own title until her husband was raided in Earl Mountbatten of Burma in 1937, would have been a bigger deal if she had been in public more than she was. But the pregnancy was a hard one, and as they had feared, the little Henry was haemophilic. With that crushing blow, the two drew closer together, and hid from the limelight even further.\n\nThe marriage of the Grand Duchess Olga and the Prince of Wales was a public affair. A wedding of this opulence hadn’t been seen in England in centuries, and it seems to have been partially the bride’s idea. Stunning in her bridal gown, designed to invoke both English and Russian royal fashion, she travelled through most of London in an open carriage, waving and smiling to those around her. She sat alone, with the carriage behind her carrying the Princess Royale, the Grand Duchess Tatiana and the Grand Duchess Anastasia, returned from Paris for the wedding, but under a strict timeframe to return to her husband. She was miserable.\n\nThe wedding was lavish and the Grand Duchess’ portrait was handed out to every guest. However, few could fail to note the lack of attendance by her aunts, or the sour faces of some of the royal family, who felt it was all a bit…showy. But the people ate it up, and she herself basked in that glory.\n\nThe new Princess of Wales would enjoy a month-long honeymoon, before she returned to London and, with her husband, began her love affair with public works. She went to hospitals, read to orphans, and fed the homeless. She opened a house for widowed mothers and danced with veteran soldiers. She was a Princess for the public, and she knew exactly what to do to make them love her. She was, in short, the antithesis to her mother, and as she began to realise the power she had to make people love her, she seemed to realise this as well.\n\nThe Prince and Princess of Wales take their daughter Alice out in 1922.\n\nThe estrangement of the Grand Duchess Anastasia and the Prince Feodor might not have happened as it did, had he not sold her jewellery. It’s not known why he did so, except they were about as poor as royals can be and he needed money. But that jewellery, the rings and things she had managed to smuggle out of Russia, were her last things of beauty, and thus in March of 1922, only 2 years into her marriage, she left Paris and arrived at her sister Maria’s doorstep.\n\nNow the Princess of Wales was not amused by this. Of course she was sympathetic to Anastasia’s plight, but she had allowed herself to be sucked in by the wants of her family, and it was her job to keep quiet and not embarrass everyone. But Anastasia, who had played the responsible one after the exile, found herself back to her rebellious roots. She had done everything she could, she argued, and now she had nothing.\n\nThe Grand Duchess Maria sent a man herself to buy back Anastasia’s jewellery, but it wasn’t enough, and Anastasia instead stayed in the Mountbatten house, helping attend her sister with the birth of her second child, another son, named George William. Thankfully, this child was not haemophilic, and since the elder son was protected as well as he could be, the Grand Duchess Maria was sure she could see both survive to adulthood.\n\nThat wasn’t the only child for the Grand Duchesses, as the new Princess of Wales enjoyed her own miracle, giving birth to the Princess Alice in January. An heir for David, and heir for England, and for those who refused to believe she could abdicate, an heir for Russia. The English royal family was quick to squash rumours that the Princess Alice was to be given the title Tsarevich. However, the rumours continued to circulate, and as the year ended, Tatiana, still with the Astor family, made an announcement. She was the Tsar, she was the Empress of Russia, and she was engaged to marry William Astor Jnr., the 15 year old heir to the title Viscount Astor.\n\nIt was an astonishing moment for the entire cohort of the Grand Duchesses, and for the Princess of Wales, it was the final straw. She demanded that, as head of the sisters, Tatiana abdicate herself, as she should have years ago, come to court, and Olga would find her a suitable husband, of age as well as of stature. However, she was not to be moved. Tatiana found she liked the attention the Astors gave her, she liked knowing they would support her and she wanted retribution for her family that her sisters seemed not to care about.\n\nIt wasn’t that the sisters didn’t want retribution, but each saw how to get it a different way. Olga wanted to watch Russia collapse in on itself, to let petty in fighting and nastiness destroy the country that let her father, mother and brother die. Maria wanted them to apologise and beg forgiveness once the revolution ultimately, as she saw it, imploded. Anastasia was probably the simplest: she just wanted the bodies of their family to be found and to see them buried, for real.\n\nThe Grand Duchess (sometimes called Tsar) in her wedding gown in 1925.\n\nThe year 1925 was probably the worst year of the Grand Duchesses since 1918, when they lost their father, mother and brother. Firstly, both the Princess Alexandra and the Lord Henry Mountbatten died within a week of each other, midway through the Grand Duchess Anastasia’s preparations to return once again to her husband in an attempt to sort things out. This stress then caused the Grad Duchess Maria to go into labour almost a month early with her third child, giving birth to a small, haemophilic baby named James Mountbatten. Having just lost one child and highly likely to lose a second, with her sister also mourning the loss of her own baby, the two sisters were then asked to attend their elder sister’s wedding. The Grand Duchess Maria did not attend, but Anastasia did attend, only to get very drunk during the reception and start a fight with her sister, the bride, famously launching at the Grand Duchess (or Tsar, depending on who you asked) Tatiana when she announced her hopes “…to have a Tsarevich soon enough.”. The sisters would not see each other for almost ten years following the incident, and although sympathy ran high for the Grand Duchess Anastasia, she would always be followed by rumours she was a little crazy. Regardless, she then left England, returning to Paris in her own apartment, paid for by the Lord Mountbatten.\n\nThe Princess of Wales, meanwhile, would remain a highly loved and respected member of the royal family until 1927, when she faced her first physical collapse. It was suggested that the weakness of the heart her mother often complained of had been inherited, but more likely, the Princess of Wales had not had sufficient time to recover from the birth of the Princess Victoria, less than a month prior. Always one for good works, she had flown to Edinburgh less than a week after the birth to attend a charity function and had continued to work steadily until the July 17th collapse.\n\nWith this, the Grand Duchess Olga was forced to spend almost a year recuperating, and in that time, she realised that she was a stranger to her children, and her husband was a stranger to her. While she had busied herself with charity and philanthropy, Edward, Prince of Wales had continued on as a bachelor most of the time. He hid it well when they were together, and enough that the papers had had little to actually say, but it without the long breaks apart, she realised she had not really known him well, and that they had entirely different focuses. She knew England needed to know and love their monarch, he expected that they would. And thus, she attempted to fix the problem.\n\nThe two had a major blow out in April of 1928, when she gave him a calender filled with potential engagements he might like to try for the sake of his crown. Already popular with the public (although it might be argued that was in large part because people loved Olga) he refused to listen and instead, suggested that she do what she wanted with the children. And so she did.\n\nUnable to go to long events, she settled for the next few months to escorting her children to events, always ready to talk as long as there was a chair she could lounge on. And, as it turned out, the people loved to see the pretty Princess Royale and the handsome Prince Edward play amongst the regular children, and Olga was praised for being a hands on mother. Granted, she never actually held the children in public, but that was more because she was afraid she might drop them, particularly the restless Alice, who was similar in temperament to the rebellious Anastasia.\n\nKing Edward VIII of the United Kingdom upon his accession.\n\nQueen Olga of the United Kingdom with the Princess Alexandra and Prince Charles in 1934.\n\nIn less than a decade, the sisters had found themselves separated and each with their own unhappiness. Olga was less and less impressed with her husband, and in 1933 they welcomed their final child, a haemophilic son named Charles, who would die three years later, effectively ending the Prince and Princess of Wales’ relationship. It had started out so strong, but to lose a child can either destroy what was left of love, or like the Lord and Lady Mountbatten, it can infinitely strengthen it. For Lady Mountbatten would always find support from her husband, despite losing three of her six sons to haemophilia, with one further surviving despite it, and two more thankfully escaping the curse.\n\nAnastasia, Grand Duchess of Russia, would return to England in 1935, to celebrate the birth of the Grand Duchess Maria’s youngest son. While there she was invited to court and to the Astor estate, and with her she brought her husband and newborn son, John D. Rockefeller IV. The trip seems to have been almost a round of forgiveness, although the Grand Duchess Tatiana never remained close to any of her family in the coming decades.\n\nThe death of the King of the United Kingdom meant, in 1936, Olga become Queen Consort of the United Kingdom, and thus all her sisters, barring a heavily pregnant Anastasia, were required to attend the double coronation between herself and Edward. It was as massive and lavish as her wedding, but something was distinctly off. People weren’t impressed by the opulence, they were uncomfortable.\n\nThe Great Depression had managed to turn the public off to such displays of wealth and, for the first time in her public career, Olga had read the room wrong. She had hoped that such a display would lift the country’s spirits and, since it created so many jobs, might actually help some people. But it was a slap in the face for those not working for the royal family, and when rumours swirled that the new Prince of Wales had received gold and diamonds for his 12th birthday, people almost rioted. Then Wallis Simpson showed up.\n\nEdward VIII and Wallis Simpson enjoy an afternoon at the park in 1936.\n\nThe stylish, supposedly promiscuous wife of a Mister Simpson, this woman managed to become the mistress of the King almost immediately and with that, destroyed the last vestiges of the royal couple’s happy marriage. Over a decade together had stripped the Grand Duchess Olga of most of her illusions, but she had hoped to never be humiliated like this. The papers she had followed since arriving in England in 1917 now ran stories covering Wallis Simpson’s exploits with the King when they were seen out, and speculation as to why he was so interested in her when they were in private. One particularly cruel private pamphlet that made it into the Queen’s collection asked if she was too fat to arouse his interest.\n\nAnd there was nothing she could do. The King had his prerogative, and she was not of a mind to have her own in a similar vein. She, who had married so well compared to the other Grand Duchesses, now looked to have made the worst deal. Tatiana’s husband might be 10 years her junior, but he also worshipped the ground she stepped on and treated her with such kindness it was little wonder the Tsar of All Russias, as Tatiana was want to refer to herself, never felt neglected. Maria had married a man who kept her safe, and despite her own issues with her children’s health, she never faced a bad look from him (although what Olga didn’t know is Lord Mountbatten kept his own women on the side, but always discreetly). And Anastasia was the luckiest of them all. Having given birth to a second child named Nicholas Alexander, the Grand Duchess was at the centre of New York’s greatest entertainments, with a husband who loved her, an ex-husband who she now was amicable with, and more freedom than any of them had thought imaginable 20 years ago. And here was Olga, with a husband who was enamoured with another woman, a country suddenly against her, and apparently hips that were too wide.\n\nEdward George Nicholas William, Prince of Wales in 1941.\n\nThe 1941 Portrait of the Princess Royale.\n\nThe growing threat of a second World War prompted even further issues between the royal couple, and when Edward VIII, King of the United Kingdom, began to publicly sympathise with the Nazis against public opinion, the Queen Consort found herself unable to keep quiet. She knew where going against the public in a war with the Germans led, and it wasn’t to a stable and happy monarchy. And thus, she began to privately support campaigns against her husband’s politics, and in 1939, finally worked the courage to speak frankly to him, despite his growing distrust in her, supported by his mistress. But it was not Olga that would get through to him, but the fear that he might push the public too far that led him to begin support for the Allies against the Axis. France had fallen, Hitler was pushing towards Poland, when suddenly England entered the war, against him.\n\nIn England, the three Grand Duchesses still there began to work independently of each other to support the war efforts, each gathering supplies and money for the army. As Germany began an offensive against the Brits, the Grand Duchess Tatiana sent her three children to stay with their Aunt in New York, as did the Lady Mountbatten. Granted, a trip to America had been planned to happen eventually, but the war meant it was a thing of safety as well as fun, and Tatiana herself was meant to have joined her children, but illness and duty kept her at home.\n\nThe Princess Royale and the Prince of Wales would become major figures in the public eye during the war. The Princess Alice would debut in the month the war started for England, and young Edward George, with his father’s looks and his mother’s sense of duty, would write pamphlets himself as to how everyone could help the effort to win the war. His sister, meanwhile, became the patron saint for all young women who had a stake in the war. With her cousins Elizabeth and Margaret of York, she styled herself as the style at home, and her portrait from 1941 came to grace every girls school in England, where she was praised as the model for poise and elegance during a crisis.\n\nHowever much the children did, however, Edward VIII would forever be known as the King that almost let the Nazis win. As the war rushed to an end with American involvement in 1945, he was ridiculed for her stance, and even the famously quiet Duke of York is said to have shunned him in the days the war was over. He’d lost the respect of the public and that was something he’d never truly get back.\n\nNot that he didn’t try. But everything was stacked against him. In 1947, Wallis Simpson finally left England, in what was truly a tearful goodbye from the King and a harsh metaphorical shove by the Queen. The Grand Duchess Olga was happy to see the back of the woman she blamed for her husband’s worst qualities, but as it turned out, she didn’t exactly take them with her. Without Wallis, Edward VIII would be lost, and by the end of the 1940’s, he was drinking heavily. It was easy to hide for the first few years, but during the 1952 function during which the King and Queen hosted a lunch attended by every major member of both sides of the royal family, Edward VIII got up to say his speech, slurred his words and fell over. It was a major embarrassment for monarchy as an institution, and everyone knew it.\n\nHowever, nothing would top the embarrassment of the wedding of his daughter in 1956, to Wentworth Beaumont, 3rd Viscount Allendale. The Princess had struggled to find a man that would allow her the level of freedom she desired, and as her cousins and siblings found love, she waited until she felt she had found someone to be happy with. Her sister, the Princess Alexandra, had married in 1952 a painter, named Gerald Biggs, unremarkable in talent but apparently a very kind sould. The Princess Victoria had married Baudouin of Belgium in the last major political marriage for any major royal family, and her brother was engaged to a woman by the name of Helen Charleston, a British-American who was cousin to the Astor family, although distantly.\n\nThus, the Princess Alice was the last Princess to marry, and when her father had to be carted away and his stomach pumped, it was not a good way to end the reception. This would be the event that led to the King’s private ‘health treatments’, starting in 1957 and ending upon his death. These treatments would last months at a time, and during them, the Prince of Wales was able to step in as Regent, slowly preparing him for life as King of England.\n\nTHE EPILOGUE: It was 1978, and in Russia, it was announced the remains of the former Tsar, Tsarina and Tsarevich had been discovered, and the remaining Grand Duchesses were invited to attend the funeral, with full protection and an offer to enjoy a 3 month tour around the country. It was a spin at it’s finest, and only one of the sisters was able and willing to attend.\n\nThe Queen Dowager of the United Kingdom, having lost her husband and her son, was an old woman, who did not wish to relive the past. Edward VIII of the United Kingdom had passed away in 1962 due to his alcoholism, and in 1970, her son had lost his life to an assassination attempt, dying of a stab wound that become quickly infected. His elder son was not old enough to take his place, and until 1975, the United Kingdom was placed under a Regency via parliament. Olga, having lost so much, retired to a London House of her own, continuing to read the papers and, in 1977, she released her first and only book: The Newspaper Trail. In it, she detailed exactly how her relationship with the papers had gone, and despite the fact it was published under a pseudonym, it was commonly known who Alice Crowne was. Due to England’s political issues with Russia, she was unable to attend the funeral.\n\nTatiana, meanwhile, was extremely ill. It’s not known exactly which ailment killed the self-proclaimed Tsar of all Russias, but the Grand Duchess was a medical disaster. Her left leg had had to be amputated due to diabetes in 1971, her vision was all but gone and she had had to take to wearing wigs to hide her balding head. She’d lost her husband to a car crash in 1966, and since then had neglected to take care of herself. Her only joy seems to have been her three granddaughters, one from each child. Thus, she couldn’t attend the funeral.\n\nThe Grand Duchess Maria, after fighting a battle with breast cancer, had died in the late 1950’s. She left behind three seemingly healthy sons, although her youngest would, himself, die due to his own haemophilia in 1963. Maria would be buried with the three children she had lost young, in a gravesite in the country outside London. Her two children, in 1978, refused to attend the funeral, the elder for political reasons, the younger due to dealing with his own battle with cancer.\n\nThat left Anastasia Rockefeller, Grand Duchess of Russia, who agreed almost immediately. Her husband had died soon before, and still mourning that loss, she decided the best thing to do would be to deal with all her issues head on at once, and thus travelled to the land of her birth.\n\nIn Russia, she set down two rules: she wanted full access to the country, and she wanted to have a televised discussion with the nation. The first was denied, the second agreed to as long as it was pre-recorded and edits were allowed. Thus, the old woman sat in front of the camera and spoke her speech, which was never to air in Russia, but in America as well, although it might have had a lot more meaning for her homeland:\n\nHello,\n\nFor those of you that do not know, I am Anastasia Rockefeller, of New York City. For those of you really not in the know, I am Anastasia Romanov, Grand Duchess of Russia, and at one point in history my family ruled this country, and I have come to pay my final respects.\n\nIt’s not an easy visit, but this is my final chance to say: I forgive you. I forgive those who rose against us, I forgive those who killed my family, for they’re all dead. There will never be a time to forgive like the present.\n\nI recently lost my husband, and as it turns out, rich men make enemies, and when your enemies forgive you, they do it at your death, and today marks the death of myself as an angry woman.\n\nI know it is not in you to hold grudges. You’re a sensible people. But I have held a grudge. And now I let it go.\n\nPlease do not remember us as monsters. Please do not talk of Nicholas II as a tyrant, and his wife as a cold fish. I know what you said, and I know what you say. Remember us as a family, as a father, a mother, a brother and four sisters. Remember us playing in the snow, and eating a meal together. Remember us feeding the poor and tending the sick. We were nurses, cooks and carers before all else. We were good people.\n\nSo I forgive you.\n\nGoodbye.\n\nThat scene was eventually leaked to the Russian media sometime in the early 1980’s and thus would make it’s way onto television, angering many who had held sympathy for the Grand Duchesses over the years. But Anastasia had hit on something important: to let the grudges go. Many who felt her messaged asked why they could be so mad that a woman who had seen her family split and slaughtered had forgiven the people who had did it. But Anastasia would never be invited back to Russia, and would never want to return.\n\nThe Grand Duchesses had all passed as the year 2000 hit, but their descendants live on. And so do their stories."
