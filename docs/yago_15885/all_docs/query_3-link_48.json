        "text": "Frances and Jane Coster (Nurses to the Plaoutine Children)\n\nFrances and Elizabeth Jane were the daughters of William Coster and Mary Towner, known to their family and friends as Fanny and Jane (or Jennie).\n\nThe search for Frances and Elizabeth Coster is a continual one, and it is hoped that more information will be added to this page over time. These noteworthy sisters came from a large family in Eastbourne, Sussex, and, although ten years apart in age, were very close throughout their lives. Both went to Russia as nurses (or governesses) in the 19th century, loved children and spoke fluent Russian.\n\nFanny left England first, going to St. Petersburg in 1869 as nurse to the children of Colonel (later Lieutenant-General) Serge Plaoutine and his wife, Eleanor (nee Pringle), in whose service she would remain until her retirement. In 1884, fifteen years after Fanny's departure, her younger sister, Jane, joined her in Russia as under-nurse in the Plaoutine household. Exactly how long Jane stayed with them is unclear, but it is known that she spent some time back in England during the early 1890s while caring for her dying mother. Jane must have returned to Fanny (and the Plaoutines) for a short time after the death of her mother, though, because she is known to have once again (and finally) left the Plaoutines in 1895 to become nurse to Baby Irina, the first child (and only daughter) of Grand Duchess Xenia of the Russian Imperial family.\n\nJane quickly endeared herself to the Imperial family (particularly to her young charges, when she devised a flannel mat to line the cold porcelain bathtubs in the large Russian palaces, thereby making the dreaded bathtimes more endurable). The Empress (Alexandra) mentioned her in a letter to her brother (written around this time) saying, \"The English nurse is very nice. I have longer talks with her every day – she speaks Russian fluently, having been here eleven years . . . as undernurse to her Sister in an officer’s family.\" The following year, several months after the birth of Czar Nicholas and Alexandra's first child, Fanny was recommended to Xenia's brother as temporary nurse for the infant Grand Duchess Olga. Even though the new Tsar did not like her looks (because of her \"long nose\", he said), she was accepted and left the Plaoutines in May 1896. Fanny stayed with the Tsar and Tsarina long enough to accompany them to Moscow for their coronation, continuing on as part of their retinue during a tour through Germany, Paris and Great Britain (including a visit to Queen Victoria at Balmoral).\n\nMeanwhile, Jane remained as nurse in the household of the Grand Duchess Xenia, continuing on to raise all seven children. Jane nursed them through Typhoid Fever and accompanied them on their annual trips to their various palaces and summer homes (even joining them at King Edward's tent for the Battle of the Flowers at Biarritz in 1907). She stayed with Xenia's family through their exile from Russia in 1919, actually travelling as one of the fleeing Imperial party to escape aboard the H.M.S. Marlborough on 07 April 1919 (listed simply as \"Miss Coster\"). In her letters, \"Auntie Jennie\" appeared well-educated but untouched by her sojourn with the Imperials. She was proud of having \"raised seven children\" for the Grand Duchess Xenia but longed to return home to family.\n\nAt some unknown time (probably 1896-97), Fanny returned to the Plaoutines at their home at 24 Quai de la Cour in St. Petersburg. With the children grown, Fanny took up service as Housekeeper to the family, remaining with them until her retirement in 1912. Fanny returned to England (joined some years later by her sister) and settled near her remaining family at Eastbourne. After Jane's return, the sisters shared Fanny's home at 4 Crown-street, and it is there that Fanny died in 1933, Jane surviving her by a little more than nine years. Having spent their lives raising other's children, these much-loved sisters were laid to rest with their own parents in Ocklynge Cemetery, Eastbourne.\n\nFanny and Jane's sister, Mary Anne, had emigrated to New Zealand when the sisters were still quite young. Though they lost touch for many years, the sisters were later able to renew their acquaintance with their sister's daughter, Florrie. Several letters from the Costers survive and have been preserved by the family in New Zealand. While there are not a lot of personal details about the sisters or their work in Russia, the letters provide a lovely picture of two very caring and Christian ladies. Click on the links below to read transcriptions of these very sweet letters.\n\nCoster Sisters' Letters to Their Niece, Florence Mary Stilwell (nee Scott):\n\n1884: Partial Letter from Frances Coster\n\n05 May 1909: Letter from Jane Coster\n\n26 Oct 1909: Letter from Jane Coster\n\n17 Oct 1914: Letter from Jane Coster\n\n10 Oct 19??: Letter from Frances Coster\n\nCoster Sisters and Family Photo (c. 1923)\n\nThis photo shows the Coster sisters with other members of their family (c. 1923). Both sisters are seated in the front row, with Jane seen second from the left and Fanny on the far right.\n\nCoster Sisters Featured in \"Illustrated London News\" (3 Oct 1896)\n\nENGLISH NURSES AT THE RUSSIAN COURT.\n\nWhile the eyes of the nation turn to the imperial visitors at Balmoral, it is worthy of note that the nurse in charge of the infant daughter of the Czar and Czarina is an Englishwoman. Miss Frances Coster is a native of Eastbourne, where her ancestors resided long before that now popular seaside resort had begun to grow, and when the only traces of habitation were a few houses clustered round the venerable parish church, with a small fishing village two miles away. In 1869 she entered the family of General de Plaoutine — a Russian nobleman who had married an English lady of good family — as nurse, and took up residence in St. Petersburg, where she remained, except for short periods, until the arrangements were being made, early in the year, for the imperial coronation, when she was sent for by the Empress to take charge of the infant Grand Duchess Olga. She accompanied the royal party to Moscow during the festivities, and has now the honour of bearing her precious charge safely to the Highland home of her imperial great-grandmother. In figure she is rather tall and graceful, with a kindly disposition, a high sense of duty, while her experience with and great love for children render her peculiarly well fitted for the honourable post she now occupies.\n\nHer sister, Miss E.J. Coster, who is a few years younger, had previously been selected for a similar position with the amiable sister of the Czar, the Grand Duchess Xenia. In July of last year she was hastily summoned to St. Petersburg to take charge of the infant daughter of the imperial Princess. Like her sister, she has resided for some years in St. Petersburg, and is thoroughly conversant with Russian customs and speaks the language fluently. Always pleasant, kind, and thoughtful, she is, if possible, more fond of young children than her sister. Unselfish to a degree, she threw over everything a few years ago to sooth the declining days of her widowed mother.\n\nLINK WITH ROYAL RUSSIA\n\nDeath of Miss Frances Coster\n\n\"Eastbourne Gazette\" 03 Jan 1934, page 19:\n\nOne of the few remaining links with the Russian Royal family was broken on Christmas Day by the death of Miss Frances Coster. Miss Coster, who was 87 years of age, lived with her sister at Crown-street, Old Town. She had spent over 40 years in Russia.\n\nMiss Coster, who belonged to one of the oldest Eastbourne families, first went to Russia in 1872. She joined the Imperial household in 1896, the year of the coronation.\n\nMiss Coster was an intimate friend of the Tsar and his familiy and travelled about the Continent with them when they paid visits to royal relatives.\n\nIn 1912 Miss Coster returned to Eastbourne and settled down in Crown-street. She was of a shy and retiring disposition, and although she loved to talk of her association with the Russian Imperial household, and had a strong affection for the tragic family, she avoided all publicity.\n\nHer sister was at the same time in the household of the Grand Duke of Russia, and was there at the outbreak of the revolution. She spent two years in Russian during the height of the disturbance, and then escaped to England, and she joined her sister at Eastbourne.\n\nThe funeral took place quiely on Friday, the Vicar of Eastbourne (the Rev. F.P. Hughes) conducting a service at St. Mary's.\n\nMiscellaneous Notes about Fanny:\n\n— 1861 Census (Eastbourne, Sussex):\n\n15 year old Frances is living at 53 Puddle Docke, Eastbourne, as a house servant to her uncle, Frances Towner.\n\n— \"The Montreal Medical Journal\" Vol. 27, 1898, page xxxv:\n\n[Advertising \"Benger's Gold Medal Awarded Health Exhibition London Food for Infants, Invalids, and the Aged.\"]\n\nThe Following Letter is Published by Special Permission of the Russian Court:\n\n\"Balmoral Castle, Scotland, 25th Sept., 1896.\n\n\"Sirs,--- Please forward to Balmoral Castle one dozen 2/6 Tins of Benger's Food for H.I.M.
