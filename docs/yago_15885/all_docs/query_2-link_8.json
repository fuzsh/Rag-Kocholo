Manuscript. Shanghai, October 10/23, 1938.\n\nDear Pious and Right-Believing Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich,\n\nThe death of your august Father, Emperor Kirill Vladimirovich, has filled the hearts of countless Russians exiled from their homeland with genuine sadness, and they flock in large numbers to the memorial services for the Head of the Russian Dynasty.\n\nI offer prayers for your deceased Father, that the Lord God may grant him rest where there is no illness and sorrow, and that He reward him for all his labors for the good of Russia. I also pray to the Lord God that He give you wisdom and strength to free the Russian people from their oppressors and to unite them, once you have sat upon your ancestral Throne in the Assumption Cathedral and have placed upon yourself the Cap of Monomakh.\n\nYour most devoted servant and intercessor in prayer,\n\nJohn, Bishop of Shanghai (4)\n\nARID, f. 8, op. 1, d. 74\n\nNotes:\n\nJohn (né Mikhail Borisovich Maksimovich) (1896–1966) – saint, archbishop. Hierarch of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia. Bishop (from 1946, archbishop) of Shanghai (1934–1951). St. John graduated from the Poltava Cadet Corps (1914) and the Law School of Kharkov University (1918). He went into exile in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. In 1925, he graduated from the School of Theology of the University of Belgrade. Even before taking monastic vows, he was given the obedience by Metropolitan Antonii (Khrapovitskii) of researching and writing the book The Origin of the Law of Succession to the Throne in Russia, which provided one of the main spiritual, legal, historical, and theoretical justifications for legitimism. In 1934, he was elevated to Bishop of Shanghai and Vicar of the Beijing diocese. On July 16, 1939, the Head of the Russian Imperial House, Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich, awarded him the Imperial Monogram, First Class, depicting the letter “K” for Emperor-in-Exile Kirill Vladimirovich. He served as Archbishop of Western Europe and Brussels from 1951 to 1962 and as Archbishop of Western America and San Francisco from 1962 to 1966. He provided unfailing support to the legitimate Heads of the Imperial House of Russia in exile, Emperor Kirill Vladimirovich and Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich. In the last years of his life, he was persecuted by a group of bishops of the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad, led by Archbishop Vitalii of Montreal and Canada (from 1986 to 2000, Metropolitan and First Hierarch of the ROCOR). He was canonized a saint by the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad in 1994. St. John’s incorrupt relics were uncovered on September 28 (according to the Julian calendar) 1994, in San Francisco by Archbishop Laurus of Syracuse and Trinity (from 2000 to 2008, Metropolitan and First Hierarch of ROCOR) and other clergy. St. John of Shanghai and San Francisco was glorified by the Council of Bishops of the Russian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) in June 2008. He is commemorated on June 4/17 and July 2/15.\n\nThe text is handwritten by St. John of Shanghai and San Francisco.\n\n* * *\n\n1938-10-24 Statement of Members of the Russian Imperial House on the legal order of succession to the Throne after the death of Emperor-in-Exile Kirill Vladimirovich. Typescript. Paris, 11/24 October 1938.\n\nWe, the Members of the Imperial House of Russia, having assembled after the death of the Head of our House, Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich, consider it our most sacred duty solemnly to declare that the rights of each of the Members of the Imperial House of Russia are determined precisely by the Fundamental Laws of the Russian Empire and the Statute of the Imperial Family, that they are known perfectly to all, and that we must observe them faithfully, by virtue of a solemn oath, which is why the question of the order of succession to the throne has never caused the slightest doubt among us and still less a disagreement of any kind. We reject any departure from the order of succession provided by the law, because that would be an offense against the inviolability of our laws and of our family traditions.\n\nBy virtue of the laws indicated above, we recognize that the succession to the throne belongs by right of primogeniture to the senior Member of the Imperial House of Russia, the Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich, which he assumed by inheritance after the death of his father on 29 September/12 October 1938, with a profound awareness of the sacred duty which devolves upon him according to the law as Head of the Imperial House of Russia, bestowing upon him all the rights and responsibilities belonging to him by virtue of the Fundamental Laws of the Russian Empire and the Statute of the Imperial Family.\n\nThe members of the Imperial House of Russia appear as follows by primogeniture in the order of succession: Grand Duke Boris Vladimirovich (5), Grand Duke Andrew Vladimirovich, Grand Duke Dmitry Pavlovich (6), Prince Vsevolod Ioannovich (7), Prince Gavriil Konstantinovich (8), Prince George Konstantinovich (9), Prince Roman Petrovich (10), Prince Andrei Alexandrovich (11), Prince Fedor Alexandrovich (12), Prince Nikita Alexandrovich (13), Prince Dmitry Alexandrovich (14), Prince Rostislav Alexandrovich (15), and Prince Vasily Alexandrovich (16).\n\n11/24 October 1938\n\n[Here follows the signatures of the most senior Members of the Imperial House present for the signing of the Statement, in order of their rights of succession to the Imperial Throne:]\n\nBoris\n\nVsevolod\n\nAndrew\n\nDmitry\n\nGabriel (17)\n\nARID, f. 8, op. 1, d. 5\n\nNotes:\n\nBoris Vladimirovich (b. St. Petersburg, November 12, 1877; d. Paris, October 27/November 9, 1943). Grand Duke, third son of Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich and Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna the Elder; grandson of Emperor Alexander II. Born in St. Petersburg. Colonel-in-Chief of the 45th Azov Infantry Regiment. An officer on the rolls of the Semenovsky Life Guards and Life Guards Dragoons regiments, and of the 4th Life Guards Infantry Battalion of the Imperial Family. He graduated from the Nicholas Cavalry School. In 1896, he was appointed a Cornet of the Life Guards Hussar Regiment, and from 1897, an Aide-de-Camp to the Emperor. In 1903 he mustered out of the regiment and joined His Majesty’s Retinue. In 1904 he was appointed to the staff of the Governor of the Far East, Admiral E. I. Alekseeva. He then served under the Commander-in-Chief, General A. N. Kuropatkin in the Russo-Japanese War. For displays of heroism in combat he was awarded the Gold Sword for Bravery (later renamed the St. George Sword). In 1908, he returned to the Hussars Regiment and was promoted to Captain. In 1909 he entered the rolls of the Life Guards Combat Engineers Battalion. In 1911, he was promoted to Colonel. In that same year, he represented the Emperor at the coronation of King George V of the United Kingdom. In 1912, he represented the Emperor at the coronation of King Rama VI of Siam. In 1914, he was promoted to Major-General of His Majesty’s Retinue. In 1914-1915, he served as the commander of His Imperial Highness the Heir and Tsesarevich’s Life-Guards Ataman Regiment, and from September 1915, Field Commander (Ataman) of all Cossack troops. In 1916 he was appointed Colonel-in-Chief of the 5th Kuban Reconnaissance Battalion. In addition to the family Orders of the Imperial House, Grand Duke Boris Vladimirovich was awarded the Order of St. George, 4th class, and the Order of St. Vladimir, 4th Class with Swords, and the Order of St. Vladimir, 2nd Class. In February 1917 he worked to keep Nicholas II on the throne and was later arrested by order of the Provisional Government. In June he was released and in September he went to Kislovodsk where his mother was residing. In August 1918, he and his brother Grand Duke Andrei Vladimirovich were arrested by the Bolsheviks and both fled to Kabarda. In September 1918 he moved in Anapa, then later returned to Kislovodsk. He emigrated in 1919 through Constantinople to Paris. In that same year, in Genoa (Italy), he entered into an unequal marriage with Z. S. Eliseeva (née Rashevskaia). He did not seek permission to marry from the Head of the Russian Imperial House and did not apply to formalize the status of his wife and offspring in accordance with the family laws of the Russian Imperial House (on the basis of the decree of Emperor-in-Exile Kirill Vladimirovich dated July 28, 1935), because he knew that Kirill Vladimirovich considered his marriage “illegal and invalid.” From 1938 to 1943, by virtue of Article 29 of the Fundamental Laws of the Russian Empire, he was the Heir of the Head of the Russian Imperial House, Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich. He was a member of the Council of the Imperial House. He left no issue, and died in Paris. He is buried in Contrexéville, France.\n\nDmitry Pavlovich (b. September 6, 1891, in the village of Ilyinskoe in the Zvenigorod district of the Province of Moscow; d. February 20/March 5, 1942, in Davos, Switzerland). Grand Duke, only son of Royal Martyr Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich and Grand Duchess Alexandra Georgievna (née Princess of Greece), grandson of Emperor Alexander II. Colonel-in-Chief of the 11th Fanagoriisky Grenadier Regiment and the Life Guards of the 20th Infantry Battalion. He also entered the rolls of the Life Guards Horse Regiment. Grand Duke Dimitry Pavlovich’s mother died in childbirth, and his father was sent into exile in 1902 for contracting an unequal marriage. He and his sister, Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna the Younger, were raised by Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich and Royal Martyr Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fedorovna. From 1909 to 1911 he was enrolled in the Officer Cavalry School. In 1911, he was promoted to Cornet. In 1912 he was appointed Aid-de-Camp to the Emperor. He participated in the Olympic Games in Stockholm in 1912, and chaired the organization committee for the first All-Russian Olympic Games in Kyiv in 1913. With the rank of captain, he fought in World War I. In December 1916, he played a secondary role in the murder of G. E. Rasputin, for which he was exiled from the Court and sent to serve in the cavalry corps of General N. N. Baratov in Persia. After the Revolution, he continued his military service in the British Expeditionary Force in Mesopotamia. He moved to London, and then lived in Paris. Some circles in the Russian émigré community put forward his name as a pretender to the Russian throne, despite the provisions of the Law on Succession that pointed elsewhere, but Grand Duke Dmitry himself always fully supported the decree of Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich in 1924 assuming the title of Emperor-in-Exile. In 1926, in Biarritz, France, he entered into an unequal marriage with an American, Anna Audrey Emery. He approached Emperor-in-Exile Kirill Vladimirovich for permission to marry, which was immediately granted, and he received a princely title with the surname Ilyinsky for his wife and son. By a decree dated July 28, 1935, he received for his wife and offspring the title of Serene Highness Princes Romanovsky-Ilyinsky. In 1937, his marriage to Ms Emery was dissolved. He was a Member of the Sovereign’s Council of Emperor-in-Exile Kirill Vladimirovich, and served as His Imperial Majesty Emperor-in-Exile Kirill Vladimirovich’s representative in Paris. From 1935 to 1938 he served as Chairman of the Governing Council and the Office of Sport and Fitness of the Young Russian Party (Mladorossi).

Prince of the Imperial Blood, the only son of Royal Martyr Prince of the Imperial Blood Ivan Konstantinovich and Princess of the Imperial Blood Elena Petrovna (née Princess of Serbia), great-great-grandson of Emperor Nicholas I.

He was the personal representative of the Head of the Russian Imperial House to Great Britain, and in 1938 he was appointed a member of the Council of the Imperial House. In 1939 in London he entered into an unequal marriage with Lady Mary Lygon. He obtained permission to marry from the Head of the Russian Imperial House, Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich, and received the title of Serene Highness Princess Romanovskaia-Pavlovskaia for his wife. The marriage ended in divorce in 1956. That same year in London he entered into a second unequal marriage with Emilia de Gosztonyi (he was her fourth husband). The marriage also ended in divorce in 1961. In that same year in London he entered into his third unequal marriage with Valli Knust. He asked permission for the marriage from Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich and received the title of Serene Highness Princess Romanovskaia-Knust for his wife. None of his three marriages produced any children. From 1956 to 1973, by virtue of Article 27 of the Fundamental Laws of the Russian Empire, he was by right of male primogeniture the Heir of the Head of the Russian Imperial House, Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich. Up until the end of the 1960s he fully supported the Head of the Imperial House; for some time he was appointed executor in the event of Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich’s death. In 1970, however, he joined a dynastic “Fronde” and signed a statement challenging without foundation the legal status of Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich and his family and objected to the Decree of December 23, 1969, on the Guardianship of the Throne.\n\nGavriil Konstantinovich (b. July 3 [Julian], 1887, in Pavlovsk; d. February 15/28, 1955, in Paris).

In 1915 he was discharged from the Regiment of His Majesty’s Retinue. In 1916 he graduated from an advanced course of study at the Imperial Nicholas Military Academy and was promoted to Colonel. In 1917 in Petrograd he entered into an unequal marriage with Antonina Nesterovskaia. He was arrested in 1918 in Petrograd and kept in custody in the Sts. Peter and Paul Fortress along with his relatives, who were later executed—the Royal Martyrs Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich, Grand Duke Dmitry Konstantinovich, Grand Duke Nicholas Mikhailovich, and Grand Duke George Mikhailovich. He was released and received permission to leave Russia thanks to the efforts of his wife and the intervention of Maxim Gorky. Beginning in 1920 he lived in Paris. In 1935, he asked for and received from Emperor-in-Exile Kirill Vladimirovich the title of Serene Highness Princess Romanovskaia-Strelninskaia for his wife.

In 1977, he headed the newly formed “Romanov Family Association,” which comprised the Princes of the Imperial Blood who were alive at that time and morganatic descendants of members of the dynasty, ignoring the historical Fundamental Laws of the Russian Imperial House. Roman Petrovich died in Rome and was buried in the Testaccio Cemetery. He left issue, though none was a member of the Imperial House.

A. von Friederici, Elisabetta, daughter of Fabrizio Ruffo, Duke of Sasso-Ruffo (she died in 1940 as a result of German bombings). In 1924, Andrei Alexandrovich and 3 of his 5 younger brothers (these three had by then reached their dynastic age of majority; a fourth was in the United States and could not sign, and the fifth and youngest brother had not reached his dynastic majority and was not asked to sign) and his father signed a letter pledging their loyalty to Emperor-in-Exile Kirill Vladimirovich.

In 1938 he reaffirmed his recognition of the legal status of Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich as Head of the Russian Imperial House after the death of Kirill Vladimirovich. He was a member of the Council of the Imperial House under Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich. In 1942, Andrei Alexandrovich entered into a second unequal marriage with Nadine McDougall (1908-2000). In 1970, he signed a statement challenging, without foundation, the legal status of Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich and his family and objecting to the Decree of December 23, 1969, on the Guardianship of the Throne. From 1978 to 1981, he was, by virtue of Article 27 of the Fundamental Laws of the Russian Empire and by right of male primogeniture, the Heir to the Head of the Russian Imperial House, Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich. After the death of Prince Roman Petrovich in 1978, he became the President the “Romanov Family Association,” which comprised the Princes of the Imperial Blood who were alive at that time and morganatic descendants of members of the dynasty, ignoring the historical Fundamental Laws of the Russian Imperial House. Both of his marriages had issue, though none is a member of the Imperial House. He died in Provender House in Kent (UK).\n\nFedor Alexandrovich (b. December 11 [Julian], 1898, in St. Petersburg; d.

In 1924, he and three of his five brothers (those who had by then reached their dynastic age of majority and were living then in Europe) and his father signed a letter pledging their loyalty to Emperor-in-Exile Kirill Vladimirovich. He did not seek permission to marry from the head of the Russian Imperial House and refused to formalize the status of his wife and offspring in accordance with the Family Laws of the Russian Imperial House issued by Emperor-in-Exile Kirill Vladimirovich dated July 28, 1935.

He left morganatic offspring (who have since died out in the male line).\n\nNikita Alexandrovich (b. January 4 [Julian], 1900 in St. Petersburg; d. August 30/September 12, 1974 in Cannes, Alpes-Maritimes, France). Prince of the Imperial Blood, third son of Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich and Grand Duchess Ksenia Alexandrovna, great-grandson of Emperor Nicholas I. He emigrated abroad with his mother. In 1922 in Paris he entered into an unequal marriage with Countess Maria Illarionovna Vorontsova-Dashkova. In 1924, together with his father and adult brothers, he signed a letter of loyalty to Emperor-in-Exile Kirill Vladimirovich. Nikita Aleksandrovich was entrusted with various public engagements by Emperor Kirill Vladimirovich. Some circles in the Russian émigré community put forward his name as a pretender to the Russian throne, despite the provisions of the Law on Succession that pointed elsewhere. In 1932, he wrote a letter to Emperor Kirill Vladimirovich breaking with him over Kirill’s New Year’s Address of 1932, which contained a condemnation of not only Communism, but also of Capitalism. Nikita Alexandrovich was for this expelled from the Imperial Family, i.e. deprived of all his dynastic rights, except for the inviolable and inalienable right of succession to the throne. Because of this, in 1934 he was not invited to the wedding of Prince George of Kent with Princess Marina of Greece, and his change in dynastic status was reflected in the Almanach de Gotha. He subsequently wrote a letter of apology, and on December 31, 1934, he signed a statement: “Concerning reports that appeared in the Russian press and associated with My name, I am compelled to make the following statement: 1) I strongly condemn the contents of the brochure published by Mr. Sychev entitled ‘The Laws of Succession to the Throne in Russia’; 2) I never considered the issue of succession to the Throne in any way to be controversial and would never reject the rights to the Throne of the Head of the Russian Imperial House, Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich, to whom I am completely loyal. Nikita. December 31, 1934, London.” He was consequently forgiven and fully reinstated as a member of the Imperial Family. Later, he repeatedly changed his political position. He did not seek permission to marry from the head of the Russian Imperial House and refused to formalize the status of his wife and offspring in accordance with the Family Laws of the Russian Imperial House issued by Emperor-in-Exile Kirill Vladimirovich dated July 28, 1935. In the 1950s and 1960s, he made statements hostile to the Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich and his family. In 1970, he supported the statement issued by Princes Vsevolod Ioannovich, Roman Petrovich, and Andrei Alexandrovich challenging, without foundation, the legal status of Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich and his family and objecting to the Decree of December 23, 1969, on the Guardianship of the Throne. He left morganatic offspring (now extinct) and died in Cannes, France. He was buried in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin.\n\nDmitry Alexandrovich (b. August 2/15, 1901 at Gatchina; d.

He emigrated abroad with his mother. In 1924, together with his father and adult brothers, he did not sign a letter of loyalty addressed to Emperor-in-Exile Kirill Vladimirovich inasmuch as he was in New York at the time, but he did support Kirill Vladimirovich with sincere conviction. In 1931 he entered into an unequal marriage with Countess Maria Sergeevna Golenishcheva-Kutuzova. He was the only son of Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich to ask Emperor Kirill Vladimirovich for permission to marry and, on the basis of the decree issued on July 28, 1935, received for his wife the title of Serene Highness Princess Romanovsky-Kutuzov. The marriage ended in divorce in 1947. They had one daughter. In 1935, with the consent of Kirill Vladimirovich, he joined the Mladorossi Party. He was a member of the Council of the Imperial House under Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich. He served as an officer in the British Navy during World War II. In 1954 in London he entered into a second unequal marriage with Sheila MacKellar Chisholm. He did not ask permission to marry from the Head of the Russian Imperial House, Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich, and did not receive a title for his new wife. In 1970, he supported the statement issued by Princes Vsevolod Ioannovich, Roman Petrovich, and Andrei Alexandrovich challenging, without foundation, the legal status of Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich and his family and objecting to the Decree of December 23, 1969, on the Guardianship of the Throne. He subsequently played a leading role in the creation and leadership of the Romanov Family Association. He died in London. His daughter from her first marriage, Princess Nadezhda Dmitrievna Romanovskaya-Kutuzova, died in 2001.\n\nRostislav Alexandrovich (b.

In 1928, in Chicago, he entered into an unequal marriage (his first) with Princess Alexandra Pavlovna Galitzine. The marriage ended in divorce in 1944. He did not seek permission to marry from the head of the Russian Imperial House and refused to formalize the status of his wife and offspring in accordance with the Family Laws of the Russian Imperial House issued by Emperor-in-Exile Kirill Vladimirovich dated July 28, 1935. In 1945, again in Chicago, he entered into his second unequal marriage, to Alice Baker Eilken. The marriage ended in divorce in 1952. In 1954, in Chicago, he entered into a third unequal marriage with Hedwig Maria Gertrud Eva von Chappuis. In 1970, he supported the statement issued by Princes Vsevolod Ioannovich, Roman Petrovich, and Andrei Alexandrovich challenging, without foundation, the legal status of Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich and his family and objecting to the Decree of December 23, 1969, on the Guardianship of the Throne. He worked as an accountant. He left morganatic offspring from his first two marriages, and died in Cannes.\n\nVasily Alexandrovich (b. June 24/July 7, 1907, at Gatchina; d. June 11/24, in 1989 Woodside, California, USA). Prince of the Imperial Blood, youngest son of Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich and Grand Duchess Ksenia Alexandrovna, great-grandson of Emperor Nicholas 1. He emigrated with his family. His father and 3 of his 5 brothers signed a statement of loyalty to Emperor-in-Exile Kirill in 1924. Vasily was not asked to sign because he had not yet attained his dynastic majority. In 1931, in New York, he entered into an unequal marriage with Princess Natalia Alexandrovna Golitsyna (his only child, a daughter, was born from this marriage). He did not seek permission to marry from the Head of the Russian Imperial House and refused to formalize the status of his wife and offspring in accordance with the Family Laws of the Russian Imperial House issued by Emperor-in-Exile Kirill Vladimirovich, dated July 28, 1935. In 1970, he supported the statement issued by Princes Vsevolod Ioannovich, Roman Petrovich, and Andrei Alexandrovich challenging, without foundation, the legal status of Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich and his family and objecting to the Decree of December 23, 1969, on the Guardianship of the Throne. From 1981 to 1989, by virtue of Article 29 of the Fundamental Laws of the Russian Empire, he was the Heir of the Head of the Russian Imperial House, Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich. After the death in 1981 of his brother, Prince of Imperial Blood Andrei Alexandrovich, he became the President of the “Romanov Family Association,” which was comprised of, except for him, only morganatic descendants of Members of the Dynasty, who ignored the historical family laws of the Russian Imperial House. In 1981, after the birth of Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich’s grandson, Grand Duke George Mikhailovich, he added his signature to a statement groundlessly denying the membership of the newborn in the Russian Imperial House. He died in Woodside, California, and was buried in the Serbian Cemetery in San Francisco. With his death, the only other remaining male line of the Russian Imperial House, besides the senior line, had died out, and the direct heir to the Head of the House of Romanoff, Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich, became, by virtue of Article 30 of the Fundamental Laws of the Russian Empire, his daughter, Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna.\n\nHere appear the signatures of Grand Duke Boris Vladimirovich, Grand Duke Andrei Vladimirovich, Grand Duke Dmitry Pavlovich, Prince of the Imperial Blood Vsevolod Ioannovich, and Prince of the Imperial Blood Gabriel Konstantinovich—all members of the Russian Imperial House who were present at the meeting. The signatories were the most senior dynasts after the Grand Duke Wladimir, and they were, respectively, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th in the line of succession after Grand Duke Wladimir to the position of Head of the Russian Imperial House. By listing in the statement all the living male dynasts in the order of their place in the succession to the throne and by omitting the names of the morganatic sons of these dynasts, the signatories made clear that the then living morganatic sons born to these male dynasts were not dynasts and were not in the line of the succession. Those morganatic sons then living included the children of two signatories, Grand Duke Andrei and Grand Duke Dmitry, as well as the children of Prince Roman, Prince Andrei Alexandrovich, Prince Feodor, Prince Nikita, and Prince Rostislav.\n\n* * *\n\n1938-10-31/01 Manifesto of the Head of the Russian Imperial House, Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich, concerning the death of his father, Emperor-in Exile Kirill I, and his assumption of the rights and responsibilities of Head of the Imperial House of Russia. Typescript. Saint-Briac, 18/31 October 1938.\n\nIt has pleased the Lord God, on the 12th day of October this year, to call unto Himself my beloved Father, the Lord Emperor Kirill Vladimirovich. Humbly bowing before the Will of the Most High, I believe that all Russian people will share with me the new heavy sorrow that has been sent to me.\n\nMy unforgettable parents have bequeathed to me a love and sense of sacrifice for Russia and the Russian people. They showed me the way which I must follow in order to complete the great work which they had begun and I, in sacred and reverent memory of them, will steadfastly follow their instructions, devoting all my resources to service of the Motherland.\n\nFollowing the example of my Father, profoundly aware of the sacred duty incumbent upon me, I accept by inheritance, by the supreme right of Head of the Imperial House of Russia to which I have succeeded, all the rights and duties which belong to me by virtue of the Fundamental Laws of the Russian Empire and the Statute on the Imperial Family.\n\nAs a faithful son of the Holy Orthodox Church, now, at this crucial moment, I address myself to Her, seeking Her blessing and support in the arduous service which is in store for me.\n\nI also address myself to all those Russian people who hold dear the destiny of Russia and I call upon them to rally around me. I call upon them to follow me in close co-operation for the good of their people.\n\nI have one aim and one aspiration—to devote myself to the service of Russia, for the happiness and prosperity of the Russian people, which will only find its right and freedom under the protection of the Imperial Throne.\n\nBending my knees before the Lord Almighty, I pray that He may grant me strength to serve my people, and I believe that all Russian people will with one accord come to my help in their endeavour to free the Motherland from suffering and humiliation.\n\nWladimir\n\nIssued at S[aint]-Briac on 31 October 1938\n\nARID, f. 8, op. 1, d. 1 (ch. 2)\n\n* * *\n\n1938-10-31/02 Announcement from the Chancellery of the Head of the Imperial House of Russia concerning the decision of the Head of the Russian Imperial House, Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich, to continue to use the title Grand Duke.

(20) I am not signing it as I was not present at the family meetings and do not know what you have decided, and, in the second place, I do not see why the family needs to sign this statement at all as it is self-evident that after the death of Kirill as Head of the Imperial House his son takes over as Head. I personally recognized Kirill and in the same way now recognize his son.\n\nWladimir in his message will himself confirm his position as Head of the House.\n\nI embrace you warmly,\n\nYour Andrei\n\nGreetings from Andi, (21) and from us both to your wife (22) and Vova.

Typescript. October 22/November 4, 1938.\n\nYou Eminence, Reverend Archpastor,\n\nHaving accepted all the rights and responsibilities that have transferred to me by right of succession, I now turn to You, as the President of the Synod of Bishops, to request your assistance in uniting with Me all the Russian peoples, for the reestablishment of the former place and position of the Holy Orthodox Church, which is inseparably connected to the reestablishment of monarchy in Russia.\n\nKnowing, Your Eminence, of your convictions and of the sentiments of the members of the Council, which took place in September of this year, I am confident of your assistance, which is so necessary for the salvation of our homeland.\n\nEntrusting myself to Your Eminence’s holy prayers, I ask You, Eminence, to accept my expression of deepest respect.\n\n[The original is signed in His Imperial Highness’s own hand:]\n\nWladimir\n\n22 October/4 November 1938\n\nARID, f. 8, op. 1, d. 1 (ch. 2)\n\nNote:\n\nThis letter is essentially identical in content to the one sent by Grand Duke Wladimir to Metropolitan Eulogius (Georgievsky), administrator of the Patriarchal Exarchate for Orthodox Parishes of the Russian Tradition in Western Europe, under the Ecumenical Patriarch.\n\n* * *\n\n1938-11-05 Letter from St. John (Maximovitch), Bishop of Shanghai, to the Head of the Imperial House of Russia, Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich, expressing his loyalty and offering words of spiritual instruction. Manuscript. Shanghai, 23 October/5 November 1938\n\nMost Pious Great Sovereign,\n\nNot long before the death of your Most August Father, I sent to you, as Heir of the Russian Throne, a report, (25) and upon His death I offered you my most humble condolences. Now I consider it necessary to express once again my devotion to the Throne of the Russian Tsars and to you as Their Legitimate Successor.\n\nI do not use the title that befits a Russian Monarch, not because I doubt that you are its legitimate bearer, but in order to be faithful to your expressed intentions, to the extent that they became known to me before my departure from Europe, and also to be consistent with my previous report. The present time of wavering convictions requires particular wisdom so not to undermine the legitimacy of Your Imperial authority and, at the same time, to help attract to Yourself those who either have not yet woken up from the frenzy of rebellion, or who, in good faith, have not yet taken the path of submission to the Law. Succession by primogeniture imposes a duty to carry on the spirit of one’s predecessors.\n\nLike the Russian people abroad, scattered throughout all the countries of the world, the Russian people now languishing in the Fatherland will recognize you as their Tsar as soon as they see that you are the bearer of the spirit, and the one who continues the work, of your Imperial ancestors, the Grand Princes and Tsars of Russia. You must before all else have strong faith in Him, “In Whom Kings reign and the mighty write the truth,” [*] Who “makes and unmakes Kings.” [**]\n\nTo be a guardian of piety and a champion of Orthodoxy is the first duty of the All-Russian Tsar, who is the successor of the Byzantine Emperors.\n\nIf your heart is filled with piety and humility, the Lord will look upon you as he once did upon young David, and then will be fulfilled in you the prophecy and hopes of Metropolitan Antonii, who in a letter to your Father about 14 years ago, applied to you the verse in 1 Samuel, 24:21 (26).\n\nYou will not be the first of Russia’s rulers to come from afar to unite and exalt Rus’. From the Varangian lands, your Heavenly Patron Saint, Grand Prince Vladimir, returned to Rus’ in his youth, having previously been forced to hide outside his homeland; from remote corners also came His son Yaroslav the Wise (27) to destroy the power of the Accursed One (28); and from the forests of Kostroma, the Ipatiev Monastery, came the founder of the Romanoff Dynasty to ascend to the Throne (29).\n\nMay the Lord make you the restorer and rebuilder of Rus’.\n\nYour humble servant and intercessor in prayer,\n\nJohn, Bishop of Shanghai (30)\n\nARID, f. 8, op. 1, d. 74\n\nNotes:\n\n[*] Proverbs 8:21.\n\n[**] Daniel 2:21.\n\nThe “report” St. John references here has not been found in the Archive of the Russian Imperial House.\n\n1 Samuel 24:21: “Now I know that you will indeed reign and that the sovereignty in Israel will pass into your hands” (NJB).\n\nYaroslav I Vladimirovich, the Wise (in holy baptism, George) (b. 978 in Vyshgorod; d. on February 20/March 5, 1054). Grand Prince.The sixth son of the Holy Equal-to-the-Apostles Vladimir I and, according to some sources, Grand Princess Rogneda Rogvolodovna (a princess from Polotsk, known also by her monastic name Anastasia). He received the principality of Rostov from his father; and in 1010, after the death of Prince Vysheslav Vladimirovich, he succeeded to the principality of Novgorod. In 1014, he refused to pay tribute to his father, which sparked a conflict between father and son. War between the two was averted only by the death of St. Vladimir in 1015. Violence broke out in Novgorod in 1015 (including the murder by members of Novgorod’s elite of Varangian members of the prince’s retinue, and, in turn, revenge killings by Yaroslav against the members of the Novgorodian elite). The violence ended when Yaroslav learned of his father’s death, the assumption of the throne by Sviatopolk I, and the murder of St. Boris on Sviatopolk’s orders. Yaroslav attempted to warn his other brother, St. Gleb, of Sviatopolk’s treachery but failed to save him from death at Sviatopolk’s hands. In 1016, Yaroslav rose against Sviatopolk I and defeated him near the city of Liubech. Sviatopolk I fled to his father-in-law, Prince Boleslaw I the Brave of Poland. Yaroslav seized Kiev and became grand prince. In 1017, he concluded a peace treaty with Emperor Henry II of the Holy Roman Empire against Boleslaw and Sviatopolk. In the summer of 1018, Yaroslav was defeated by Boleslaw at the River Bug and fled to Novgorod. Yaroslav had thought to flee even further, into Scandinavia, but he was dissuaded by the people of Novgorod, who pleaded with him to continue the fight. In 1019, exploiting a rift between Boleslaw and Sviatopolk and the former’s departure from Kiev, Yaroslav defeated his brother Sviatopolk and assumed the grand-princely throne of Kiev. In 1019, Sviatopolk I was definitively defeated on the River Alta, on the very place where St. Boris the Passion-Bearer had been murdered on Sviatopolk’s orders. Yaroslav’s first wife was St. Anna, who evidently died in 1018. In 1019, Grand Prince Yaroslav married the daughter of King Olof Skötkonung of Sweden: Princess Ingegerd (who in Orthodox baptism took the name Irene), whom Yaroslav very much loved and respected. Yaroslav “translated” the holy relics of St. Gleb from Smiadyn to Vyshgorod, burying them next to the grave of St. Boris. In 1021, Yaroslav defeated his nephew, Prince Briachislav Iziaslavich of Polotsk, who had devastated Novgorod, then concluded a peace treaty with him. In 1023, a feud broke out between Yaroslav and his brother, Prince MstislavVladimirovich of Tmutarakan. Mstislav defeated Yaroslav near the town of Listven, but then he immediately negotiated a peace with him that divided the Kievan lands between them (the treaty was concluded in 1026). In 1023, Yaroslav suppressed a revolt led by members of a pagan cult in Suzdal. In 1030, Yaroslav captured the Polish city of Belz, defeated the Chuds, and founded the town of Iuriev on their lands. He also created a school in Novgorod. In 1031, he and his brother Mstislav of Tmutarakan captured several Cherven towns from the Poles, taking many prisoners and resettling them on the banks of the Ros River. After Mstislav’s death in 1036, Yaroslav united under his power the entireland of the Rus’. Having settled his disputes with Novgorod, he granted the city many new privileges and liberties. He attacked the Pechenegs, who were threatening Kiev, defeating them completely and putting an end to their planned invasion. In 1037, he began large-scale construction projects in Kiev, laying down the foundation of the Cathedral of St. Sophia, founding the monasteries of St. George and St. Irene, erecting the Golden Gate, and beginning or completing many other important architectural monuments in the city. In 1038, he went to war against the Yatvingians and also arranged for several important dynastic marriages: his sister, Maria, to the Polish Prince Casimir I the Restorer; and his daughter, Anastasia, to Prince Andrew of Hungary. In 1040-1041, he fought with the Lithuanians and Masovians. In 1043, after the murder of Russian merchants in Constantinople, Yaroslav began military operations against the Eastern Roman Empire, but was defeated. In 1044, he arranged the marriage of his daughter, Elizabeth, to King Harald Hardrada of Norway. In 1045, he helped his son-in-law, Andrew of Hungary, ascend the throne of Hungary. In 1046, he made peace with the Eastern Roman Empire, returned captured prisoners, and successfully negotiated a marriage between his son, Vsevolod, and Princess Maria, the daughter of Emperor Constantine IX Monomachus. In 1047, he aided his other son-in-law, Casimir I, against the Masovians. In 1049, he gave his daughter Anna in marriage to King Henry I of France. In 1050, he buried his much beloved wife Irene, who was his advisor on all important matters. In 1051, he attempted, for the first time in Russian history, to achieve autocephaly for the Russian Orthodox Church from the Patriarchate of Constantinople, raising to the Kievan Metropolitanate the native-born Russian hierarch Hilarion (the author of the famous “Sermon on Law and Grace”). Yaroslav earned the epithet “the Wise” for his learning, his patronage of science and education, and his law codes. He created the first compilation of Russian laws—the Russian Law (or Russkaya Pravda)—and issued his Charter on Ecclesiastical Courts (or Ustav o tserkovnykh sudakh). Before his death, Grand Prince Yaroslav I the Wise instituted a new system of princely succession: a “rota” or “ladder” system, according to which power in Russia belonged to the entire House of Riurikovich. The most senior member of the House by birth order would occupy the most senior and most important of Rus’ thrones: Kiev. The other princes in the House would rotate through the other principalities, from larger and more significant to smaller and less important, in accordance with their seniority overall in the ruling House. This system of succession would survive into the fifteenth century, though it was violated numerous times as the increase in the number of princes over time made calculating seniority much more complex, as internal conflicts between branches of the dynasty disrupted the hierarchy of principalities, and as usurpations of thrones complicated the orderly succession in the family—all leading to violence and confusion in the relationship among the princes of the House of Riurikovich. Yaroslav I died after falling ill in Vyshgorod. He is buried in the Cathedral of St. Sophia in Kiev, which he built. He lies next to his wife, Grand Princess Irene. He was venerated locally as a saint, then glorified by the entire Church in 1831. His feast day is the Synaxis of the Saints of Volhynia, October 10/23.\n\nSviatopolk I Vladimirovich (Yaropolkovich) (in holy baptism, Peter), the Accursed (b. 978; d. March 22/April 4, 1020). Grand Prince. Sviatopolk I was the only son of Grand Prince Yaropolk I Sviatoslavich and a former Greek nun, who had been among the prisoners brought back to Rus’ by Grand Prince Sviatoslav I Igorevich. Sviatopolk I was born after the death of his father, who died in the wars against Vladimir I. He was then adopted by his uncle. He received the principalities of Turov and Pinsk. In 1013, he married the daughter of the Polish King Boleslaw I the Brave. Sviatopolk and his wife were imprisoned by order of St. Vladimir I, who suspected them of conspiring against him. In 1015, after St. Vladimir I’s death, they were freed, and, as the senior member of the dynasty, Sviatopolk ascended the grand-princely throne of Kiev. He ordered the murders of the sons of St. Vladimir—the Holy Princely Passion-Bearers Boris, Prince of Rostov, and Gleb, Prince of Murom, despite the fact that they recognized Sviatopolk’s dynastic seniority over them. Sviatopolk I also ordered the murder of their brother, Prince Sviatoslav Vladimirovich, Prince of the Drevlianians. For this atrocity, Sviatopolk I is known to history by the epitaph “the Accursed.” Another of St. Vladimir’s sons, Yaroslav Vladimirovich, Prince of Novgorod, rose up against Sviatopolk and defeated him and his Pecheneg allies near the town of Liubech. Grand Prince Sviatopolk fled to his father-in-law in Poland, and his wife was taken prisoner by Yaroslav. In 1018, Sviatopolk I, with the support of Boleslaw I, defeated Yaroslav I and forced him to flee to Novgorod. Soon, however, Sviatopolk I and his father-in-law began to quarrel and he lost Boleslaw's support, who then withdrew his army and returned to Poland, seizing several towns in Chervon Rus’ (eastern Galicia) along the way. In 1019, fearing the approaching army of Yaroslav I, Sviatopolk I fled from Kiev to the Pechenegs. Forming an alliance with them, Sviatopolk attempted to return to the Kievan throne, but he was defeated in the Battle of the Alta River (on the very place and on the very day, July 24/August 6, where and when his assassins had murdered Prince St. Boris in 1015). He was possibly wounded in the battle. Sviatopolk I died at an unknown location, somewhere between Poland and the Czech lands.\n\nThe reference here is to Tsar Mikhail Fedorovich Romanoff.\n\nThe entire text is handwritten by St. John.\n\n* * *\n\n1938-11-10/01 Letter from the Chairman of the Russian Monastic Monarchist Organization of Mount Athos, Hieromonk Seraphim, and its members, to the Head of the Imperial House of Russia, Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich, expressing their condolences on the death of his father, Emperor-in-Exile Kirill I, and their loyalty to the Grand Duke.

Typescript. Belgrade, October 30/November 12, 1938\n\nYour Imperial Highness,\n\nIt has pleased God to entrust to you the rights and responsibilities of the Head of the Imperial House of Russia, which have transferred to you from your late Most August Father by right of inheritance.\n\nHeeding the call to the sacred duty that has been laid upon you, you now embark on the path of selfless service to the nation, calling on all Russia’s faithful sons to unite around you to help you in your noble, patriotic desire to “liberate Russia from suffering and humiliation.”\n\nAware of the weightiness and responsibility of the task that lies before Your Imperial Highness, you, following the example of your pious Ancestors, seek first the gracious help of the Holy Orthodox Church, asking for its “blessing and support for the difficult service that lies ahead of you.”\n\nThe Church, which, according to the words of your deceased Father, was the “original Leader and Organizer of the destinies of Russia,” cannot but welcome this pious desire of your Orthodox heart and is ready to bless your every good undertaking aimed at restoring the Russian Orthodox Kingdom, now lying in ruins, which had been nurtured, strengthened and sanctified by the Church. The Church fervently prays to the Lord that He will instill the spirit of harmony and unity in the hearts of the Russian people, so that they can all unite around you without exception and direct all our nation’s strength to fighting the dying Communism that has enslaved our country. Now is the right time for this: the night is already passing and the day is fast approaching. Bolshevism has outlived itself, and the Russian people, having paid for their willfulness and the seduction of Communism, are by the grace of God again returning to their Father’s house and to their ancient historical legacy. At the cost of unprecedented suffering, humiliation, and slavery, the people understand now more clearly than before all the benefits of rule by a hereditary monarchy, which has been anointed from Above, and again longs for those blessed times when, under the mighty scepter of their Orthodox Tsar, everyone lived freely and happily under his vine, like Israel in the days of Solomon.(32)\n\nIn their spiritual insight; and especially in their unshakable loyalty to Orthodoxy, which has been the cornerstone of our state from time immemorial; and in their strong faith and hope in God’s help, which the Church unfailingly supports in them, lies the main guarantee of their salvation. One cannot fail to recognize the significance of the fact that the Lord deigned to call you to this vital service to the nation at no other time than in the year of St. Vladimir, when, inspired by the 950th anniversary of the Baptism of Rus, the great image of your Heavenly Patron and Enlightener of Rus, the Holy Equal-to-the-Apostles Grand Prince Vladimir, and with him, the triumph of ancient Holy Rus, comes into view, as if emerging from the baptismal font. To connect with strong bonds the present and future with our glorious and sacred past, made bright by the rays of Holy Rus, is the high calling to which you have been called by Divine Providence.\n\nNothing can prevent a restored Russia from adopting in its revival the best and most practical of the achievements of modern culture, in order to be, in this respect, at the same level as other neighbouring nations. But in every aspect, Russia must also be imprinted with the spirit of the Orthodox faith, piety, and purity, in ways consistent with our history. There could be nothing more dangerous than if, under the guise of foreign customs and institutions legitimated by time, Russia assimilates something from the sad legacy left behind by debauched Bolshevism: everything touched by its corrupting, godless hand threatens to infect us again with its intrinsic leprosy.\n\nThe crown-bearing rulers of Russia from the House of Romanoff, beginning with their Ancestor (33) and down to the late Tsar-Martyr Nicholas II, tried tirelessly to follow the path set out by St. Vladimir, and to lead the entire Russian people along them. We paid for our deviation from this path with our current humiliations and exile. But those who have come out of Sodom and Gomorrah should never look back, as did Lot’s wife (34).\n\nMay the Lord grant you, as he did Solomon, a wise heart to judge everything in truth and to discern between what is good and what is evil.\n\nYouth itself always serves as a symbol of purity, sacrifice and the idealistic exaltation of the spirit. It is not surprising that your bright, clear visage, shrouded in the glorious traditions of our Dynasty, is looked upon with love by the true sons of Russia, inspired by the brightest and most joyful hopes. May God help you to vindicate these best hopes of the suffering Russian people, and strengthen you spiritually and physically, crowning you with wisdom, courage, the gift of fierce love for Russia, and mercy for all—which have from time immemorial been the crowning adornment of the Imperial Romanoff Dynasty.\n\nHaving been linked to it for the last three hundred years of history, the Russian people cannot help but treasure their Imperial House, and, especially, He who heads it in the order of succession. The more acknowledged and accepted this order is, the more confident we can look into the future, for it ensures the speedy restoration and establishment of Imperial rule in Rus.\n\nIt has now come to Your Imperial Highness to be both the Bearer and the Guardian of this sacred Imperial birthright, so that the historical candle does not go out in the darkness of our troubled and sorrowful days. With it, the Russian people, living in the diaspora, hope, with God’s help, to return to the liberated Russian land, where this candle will again be placed on the All-Russian candlestand, to shine its light not only on everyone who is in the church, but also before the entire world.\n\nIn this holy hope, we beseech God’s blessing for you, as the Head of the Imperial House of Russia, and with deep respect,\n\n/the following lines Metropolitan Anastasii wrote by hand:/\n\nwe remain Your Imperial Highness’s most faithful servant and fervent intercessor in prayer.\n\n+Metropolitan Anastasii\n\n1938\n\n30 October\n\n12 November\n\nBelgrade\n\nARID, f. 8, op. 1, d. 73\n\nNotes:\n\n(31) This version, based on the archival original, corrects a number of errors included in previous publications of this document.\n\n(32) [This line is drawn from Micah 4:4.] Solomon, King of Israel from 965 BC to 928 BC.

Many tears have been shed and even more Russian blood has been shed, and to this day our country suffers immensely, and there is no deliverer....\n\nAfter the death of your much-loved father, Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich, Your Imperial Highness was pleased to make the magnanimous decision, born of your selfless love for our suffering people, to accept, in accordance with the Fundamental Russian State Laws, the Head of the Imperial House of Russia, taking upon yourself all rights and responsibilities of that position.\n\nIn deep gratitude for your unconditional mercy and love, all Russian people must from now on set aside their party and personal grievances, all their disagreements and discords, which only play into the hands of Russia’s international enemies and torturers, and, in close cooperation with each other, making efforts both individually and collectively, offer their spiritual and material strength, experience, and knowledge, with faith in God’s help, to this common great work of bringing about the rebirth of Russia under Your Imperial Highness’s most gracious leadership.\n\nWe, the Russian monks of the Holy Mountain of Athos, the monasteries of the Holy Archangel Michael and the Three Hierarchs, in great joy, devotion and gratitude, humbly falling at your feet, express our sincere wish to Your Imperial Highness for every success in your selfless service to Russia, and we offer our fervent prayers to the Lord and His Most Pure Mother, that they place you under Their Protection, send down to you Their Grace, and deliver our suffering homeland from complete destruction, through the prayers and intercession of the Enlightener of the Russian Land, the Holy Prince Vladimir, your Heavenly Patron.\n\nWe humble Russian monks, your intercessors in prayer, in sincere devotion to Your Imperial Highness,\n\nAbbot of the Russian monasteries of the Holy Archangel Michael and the Three Hierarchs on Mount Athos\n\n/the signature is in Abbot Eugenius’s own hand:/\n\nArchimandrite Eugenius, and the brethren\n\nAddress:\n\n/the address is imprinted on the page by an ink stamp/\n\nReverend Archimandrite Eugene\n\nSuperieur De La Cellule\n\nSt. Michel Ange\n\nMont-Athos\n\nGrèce\n\nARID, f. 8, op. 1, d. 237\n\nNotes:\n\n(44) The reference here is to the Russian monastic community of the Holy Archangel Michael, an annex of the Stavronikita Monastery on Mount Athos. It was located near the road from St. Andrew’s Skete to the Iviron Monastery. It was revived by the Abbot, Hieromonk Eugenius (Zhukov). Holy relics at the monastery include a particle of the True and Life-Giving Cross of the Lord, and numerous saints’ relics. The brethren numbered 18 monks.\n\n(45) The reference here is to Russian monastic community of the Three Hierarchs (St. Basil the Great, St. Gregory the Theologian, and St. John Chrysostom), an annex of the Hilandar Monastery. It was located in Karyes, next to the monastery of the Holy Trinity. It was founded in the beginning of the twelfth century, and acquired in the mid-nineteenth century by a native of St. Petersburg, Fr. Sisoes, who built a new church and a three-story building. After Fr. Sisoes, Schemamonk Varlaam (a native of the Voronezh province, who arrived on Athos in 1864) became the Abbot. Holy relics at the monastery include the revered icon of the Mother of God “Joy of All Who Sorrow,” and numerous saints’ relics. The brethren in 1913 numbered 30 monks and 3 clergy.\n\n(46) Eugenius (Zhukov) (1887-1972). Archimandrite, Abbot of the monastery of the Holy Archangel Michael on Mount Athos. Father-Confessor, spiritual child of the Holy Venerable Silouan of Athos, and spiritual friend of Hieroschemamonk Theodosius and Archbishop Leontius of Chile. He was born in the village of Lestnitskoye, in Stavropol province, into a peasant family. He went on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and on the way back he went to Athos and received the monastic tonsure at the monastery of the Holy Archangel Michael of the Stavronikita Monastery. He was ordained a Hieromonk and became the Assistant Abbot. In 1914 he returned in Russia for his mother’s funeral and was unable to return to Athos due to the outbreak of World War I. He took up residence at the Lebiazhsky Hermitage in the Kuban. During the Civil War, he miraculously escaped death: he was in the parish church when a detachment of Red Army soldiers arrived and shot all the monks of the hermitage. He was an active opponent of Renovationism. He was elevated to the rank of Archimandrite (1924), but out of humility refused to accept the rank of bishop. He rejected the Declaration of Metropolitan Sergius of 1927. He was arrested many times and sentenced to death, but the sentence was commuted (probably because he was seen as a foreigner). He served as a priest in the village of Kavkazskaya in the Kuban, and maintained a correspondence with His Beatitude Patriarch Damian of Jerusalem. In 1933 he was arrested again and exiled to the Kemerovo detainment camps. On the advice of a lawyer, and citing his (alleged) Greek citizenship, he was deported in 1936 (in exchange for a certain Greek communist). He returned to Athos, where he again took charge of the monastery of the Holy Archangel Michael. He died in 1972.\n\n* * *\n\nLITERATURE AND SOURCES\n\n(Except for two of the titles listed below, these works have not been translated from Russian into English.)\n\nGrand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich, My Life in Russia’s Service: Then and Now.
