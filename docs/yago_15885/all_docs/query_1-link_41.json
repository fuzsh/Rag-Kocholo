        "text": "Prince Andrei Alexandrovich of Russia (24 January [O.S. 12 January] 1897 â€“ 8 May 1981) was the first son and second child of Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia and Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia. He was also the eldest nephew of Nicholas II of Russia, the last Tsar.\n\nBorn and raised in Imperial Russia during the reign of his uncle Nicholas II, his military career in the Russian navy and the Chevalier guards was cut short by the Russian Revolution. He escaped the fate of many of his relatives that were killed by the Bolsheviks by fleeing to his parents' estate in Crimea, where he was under house arrest with a large group of family members and got married after a couple of years."
