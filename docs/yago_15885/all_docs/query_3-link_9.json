        "text": "Template:Xenia I of Russia\n\nXenia I of Russia (April 6, 1875 - April 20, 1960) was the Empress of Russia from December 6, 1926 until her death. She countinued her brothers ambitions which he could not accomplish. Some of her reforms were based on womens rights, such as women being allowed to serve government positions, and allowing for women to vote and apply for the same occupations as men. During her reign, the wage gap in Russia was eliminated all together. She is remembered as an influential figure in modern Russian history. After her death in 1960, her eldest son took the throne as Andrei I of Russia.\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nXenia Alexandrovna Romanov was born to Alexander Alexandrovich Romanov (Later Tsar Alexander III) and Princess Dagmar of Denmark on April 6, 1875. She was the 4th out of 6 siblings. Her 5 other siblings are listed here:\n\nTsar Nicholas II (1868 - 1933) age 65 years old\n\nGrand Duke Alexander Alexandrovich (1869 - 1870) age 10 months old\n\nGrand Duke George Alexandrovich (1871 - 1899) age 28 years old\n\nTsar Micheal II (1878 - 1926) age 48 years old\n\nGrand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna (1882 - 1960) age 78 years old\n\nOn November 22, 1878, the family welcomed their 5th child and their 4th son, Micheal, to whom Xenia would remain very close with. In 1881, her paternal grandfather, Tsar Alexander II was assassinated, which led her father to become tsar. As of tradition, she was christened as Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna. On June 1, 1882, Xenia gained a sister, Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna. The early parts of Xenia's childhood were rough. At the time, Russia was dealing with terrorists. However, the situation was dealt with.\n\nMarriage & Personal Life[]\n\nOn August 6, 1894, Xenia married her first cousin, Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich, who was 9 years older than her. 11 months after the marriage, Xenia gave birth to her first child and only daugher, Princess Irina Alexandrovna on July 15, 1895. On January 24, 1897, She had her first son, Prince Andrei Alexandrovich (later Tsar Andrei I) This was followed by Prince Feodor Alexandrovich (born December 23, 1898) Prince Nikita Alexandrovich (born January 13, 1900) Prince Dmitri Alexandrovich (born August 15, 1901) Prince Rotislav Alexandrovich (born November 2, 1902) & Prince Vasili Alexandrovich (born July 7, 1907).\n\nRelationship with Micheal II[]\n\nXenia was very close with her youngest brother, Tsar Micheal II. After the 1905 Revolution, Her eldest brother, Nicholas II, was forced to abdicate in favor of Micheal. During his reign as tsar, Xenia was an important advisor to her brother. She was also great friends with his wife, Natalia Brasova. When Micheal's only son, George Mikhailovich was born, Xenia would often take on the position as a \"second mother\" when Micheal & Natalia were gone for different meetings. Xenia would often collaborate with Micheal on passing laws. This made Micheal more likeable amongst much of the population. However, there were still somewho disliked his policies. With this said, on December 6, 1926, Micheal II and his son were assassinated by a follower of Leon Trotsky. This left no male heir. However, it was decided that Xenia would be his successor, as she was an important figure who many thought would keep Russia strong.\n\nReign[]\n\nOn December 7, 1926, She was proclaimed as Xenia, Empress of Russia. She was the first Empress of Russia in 130 years, the last being Catherine II (1729 - 1796). In the beginning, a manhunt for Leon Trotsky begun. it wouldnt be long however, as in October 1927, Leon Trotsky was found living outside of St. Petersburg after his location was leaked by neighbors. He was executed on October 17, 1927, just 3 weeks before turning 48 years old. After Trotsky was executed, the Communist Party in Russia was banned from elections. Although much of the far left were furious, Xenia began to take a more Libertarian stance in government."
