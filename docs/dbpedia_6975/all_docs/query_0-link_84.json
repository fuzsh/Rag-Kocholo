        "text": "WithÂ Mary & George putting King James VI of Scotland and I of England front and center, I thought it was time to do a roundup on this important British monarch!\n\nJames (1566-1625) was the son of Mary, Queen of Scots, although he was taken away from her while still an infant so he could be raised Protestant and by Scottish nobles. His mother abdicated the Scottish throne in his favor in 1567, so he had regents controlling things until 1578-83ish. He married Anne of Denmark and they had three children who survived into adulthood.\n\nAs a great-great grandson of Henry VIII, James was in line for the English crown, and he ended up succeeding Elizabeth I when she died in 1603. He then moved to England and really ended up focusing on that country from there on out.\n\nJames’s reign included the Gunpowder plot (Catholics trying to blow up Parliament), English colonisation of Northern Ireland and the Americas, and witch hunts (of which he was a real proponent). He had close (likely sexual) relationships with male favorites.\n\nJames has been on screen many times; sadly, some of those are undocumented-by-photos-that-I-can-find, including:\n\nLucien LittlefieldÂ inÂ To Have and to HoldÂ (1916)\n\nJerrold Robertshaw in Guy FawkesÂ (1923)\n\nWilliam PodmoreÂ inÂ The King’s Author (1952)\n\nEverett SloaneÂ inÂ The King’s Bounty (1955)\n\nAngus MacDonaldÂ inÂ Kings and Queens of England Volume IIÂ (1994)\n\nWayne Opie in ElizabethÂ (2000)\n\nJeremy Irons (voice?) in Freedom: A History of UsÂ (2003)\n\nHere’s those that I can document!\n\nRaymond HattonÂ inÂ To Have and to HoldÂ (1922)\n\nOne of several adaptations of a novel about “an English soldier… turned Virginian explorer in colonial Jamestown” per Wikipedia. Sadly a lost film!\n\nJean Kircher &Â Judith KircherÂ inÂ Mary of ScotlandÂ (1936)\n\nBaby James is played by twin sisters in this biopic of his mother.\n\nManfred Mackeben in The Heart of a Queen (1940)\n\nBaby James apparently is in this Mary Queen of Scots biopic as well, but I can’t find pics!\n\nAnthony EustrelÂ inÂ Captain John Smith and PocahontasÂ (1953)\n\nHe’s SUPER quickly in the final scene of this no-doubt-romanticized story of English explorer John Smith and Native American Pocahontas.\n\n?? in Mary Queen of Scots (1971)\n\nBaby James shows up in this biopic of his mother, but doesn’t get credited on IMDB.\n\nBill Paterson in Will Shakespeare akaÂ Life of ShakespeareÂ (1978)\n\nHe watches one of Shakespeare’s plays, giggling with his boytoy, in this bio-miniseries about the bard.\n\nPatrick Malahide in Into the LabyrinthÂ (1981)\n\nA British TV show about dueling sorcerers, in which the protagonists end up in different historical time periods.\n\nHugh Ross in God’s Frontiersmen (1989)\n\nA docu-drama about the Scots who, in the 17th century, moved to Northern Ireland to participate in the plantation system. Kendra skimming through this on YouTube looking for James: “How can you tell he’s the king? He hasn’t got shit all over him!”\n\nDudley SuttonÂ inÂ OrlandoÂ (1992)\n\nA young English nobleman lives through several centuries. In the first portion, he’s in late Elizabethan England, and apparently James shows up in the (beautiful) ice skating scene.\n\nRobert Carlyle in Gunpowder, Treason & PlotÂ (2004)\n\nA terrible TV miniseries that first tells the story of Mary Queen of Scots, then follows with the story of James. It’s pretty homophobic and the costumes are atrocious.\n\nEwen Bremner in Elizabeth IÂ (2005)\n\nI have no memory of James appearing in this QEI bio-series, but apparently he does!\n\nJonathan PryceÂ inÂ The New WorldÂ (2005)\n\nAt the very end of this beautiful film about the Jamestown settlement, Pocahontas comes to visit the English court.\n\nMathew Baynton/Jalaal Hartley inÂ Horrible Histories (2009-24)\n\nOf course this British comedy show had to include James!\n\nJames ClydeÂ inÂ AnonymousÂ (2011)\n\nI have ZERO memory of James showing up in this terrible (but beautifully costumed) film focused on the stupid theory that Edward de Vere wrote Shakespeare’s plays.\n\nJake Foy in ReignÂ (2017)\n\nNO idea, it’s Reign!\n\nDerrek Riddell in GunpowderÂ (2017)\n\nGiven this TV miniseries focused on the Gunpowder plot, I’m guessing James was pretty central.\n\nAndrew RothneyÂ in Mary Queen of Scots (2018)\n\nOne of the final shots of this MQoS biopic shows James on the throne.\n\nAlan Cumming inÂ Doctor Who:Â “The Witchfinders” (2018)\n\nThe Doctor and his companions end up in the middle of a seventeenth century witch trial, and James shows up.\n\nTony Curran in Mary & George (2024)\n\nA TV miniseries about James and his affair with George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, particularly focused on the machinations of George’s mother.\n\nWhich is your favorite portrayal of King James VI & I on screen?"
