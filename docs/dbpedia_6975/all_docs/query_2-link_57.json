        "text": "Mary Tudor was the daughter of King Henry VIII of England and his first wife, the Spanish princess Catherine of Aragon. Mary’s early life was chaotic, as her father’s frequent remarriages threatened both her claim to the throne and her very survival. Henry’s pursuit of a male heir led to his split with the Roman Catholic Church, and Mary’s faith put her at odds with the Protestant Church of England. That clash came to a head when Mary became queen in 1553, and her efforts to restore Roman Catholicism to England would earn her the nickname “Bloody Mary.” Hundreds of Protestants were burned at the stake as heretics, and hundreds more were executed in the wake of a failed Protestant rebellion led by Sir Thomas Wyatt the Younger. Suffering from a series of illnesses, Mary died in 1558 at the age of 42, having ruled for just five years.\n\nMary’s most lasting contribution to history would be her unfortunate (if somewhat justified) nickname. According to some sources, the vodka and tomato juice concoction often touted as a hangover cure derives its name from her, although this is much disputed. Of even murkier origin is the childhood ghost story that suggests that repeating the words “Bloody Mary” into a mirror will cause some foul apparition to appear. However, there is nothing to suggest that Mary Tudor’s deeds or misfortunes would have inspired an eternal malice toward sleepover participants."
