        "text": "There's a scene in Derek Cianfrance's Blue Valentine where the Ryan Gosling character redecorates the room of an old gent in a nursing home, carefully personalising the institutional walls. The old man gapes as his circumscribed world is transformed by this small act of human kindness. I was reminded of this quietly devastating moment when, halfway through Melvyn Bragg's latest novel, the 71-year-old John coaxes his 92-year-old mother into a chorus of the Hokey Cokey. \"Their voices rose and the nurse who had stopped outside beckoned a fellow nurse and her patient in a wheelchair to listen.\" Slowly the song builds momentum: \"The audience and the chorus swelled along the corridors of the nursing home as they all sang.\" After the final Knees bend, arms stretch/ Rah! Rah! Rah! the mother, Mary, comments drily, \"'I don't think we can do the legs bit.'\" It's funny and sad and touching, like much of this novel about a man losing his mother to dementia.\n\nThe story is ripped from raw life – Bragg finished it just before his own mother died in a nursing home. John (from whose perspective much of the tale is told) is an intellectual, his mother a working-class Cumbrian, and the events of the book appear to trace history closely. Bragg should be applauded for choosing the form of a novel – scene of the universal – rather than the predictable particularities of the misery memoir to tell his tale. For it is in the act of imagining what he cannot know that John drags the stories of Mary (his mother) and Grace (his grandmother) out of the commonplace. At the end of the book John – mistakenly – mourns his lack of information about his grandmother's life. \"His own ignorance… was such a loss. He would have liked to know her: he would have loved her and she him. How good that would have been. Now he had to make it up.\" It is here, though, in John's imaginative engagement with the lives of Grace and Mary, that the affective power of the novel lies.\n\nThe chapters alternate between the present of John's visits to Mary and the past, which is the story of Grace reconstructed by John as a way of reconnecting his mother to her shattered history. As another novel about the ravages of ageing – Samantha Harvey's The Wilderness – reminds us, dementia is about the destruction of narrative, the dissolution of the past. Bragg, through John, is on a quest to recover what went before, to construct an edifice of story against the depredations of the disease: \"Mary now lived mostly in the constant present… Her past appeared to be an ocean of unknowing.\"\n\nBragg's In Our Time day job casts its shadow across Grace and Mary. Research – whether on the workings of the brain, Wordsworth, or Wycliffe's Bible – is unfurled as if before an audience. John's narrative is sometimes painfully interrogative – the rhetorical questions come with bludgeoning regularity, often in thick clusters, until we feel like an In Our Time guest who has strayed too far from the programme's subject. Even the prose style seems to have the incantatory beat of Bragg's mellifluous radio spiel, with descriptions rendered in rhythmic encyclopaedic lists.\n\nI'd read glowing reviews of Bragg's previous novels and written them off as mere toadying to his eminent Lordship, but there is some fine prose here. When mother and daughter meet by chance there is \"a glance of light\"; an old man feels his arthritis \"as if a sapling were growing inside him, one that could not be rooted out or cut down\". With regular echoes of Thomas Hardy, this quiet, unshowy, book proves that novels can tell truths that are deeper and truer than the mere fact of memoir."
