        "text": "Edited by Mary McGillicuddy. John Moriarty was a man who was gloriously indefinable – a writer, philosopher, teacher, gardener, poet, mystic, ordinary man – and ultimately, and surprisingly, a missionary in the tradition of the early Irish monks. He was a missionary for a newly-imagined Christianity, one that might go back to its roots to include Taoists, Hindus, Jews, Muslims, atheists, scientists, plants and animals, the Earth, the stars and the galaxies.\n\nThis Christianity could heal what he called ‘the bog sadness’ of the world; it could enable us to ‘walk beautifully on the earth’ and to be content with the Paradise that can be known in the here-and-now. is Christianity would help to grow and nourish a sense of soul. ‘What is wrong,’ he asked, ‘about emerging into a sense of wonder?’ Moriarty’s work can be daunting; Not The Whole Story is the attempt of Mary McGillicuddy to provide a key – to open the door into his genius, ensuring that his legacy will not be lost.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHORS\n\nOriginally from Cork, Mary McGillicuddy has lived and worked in North Kerry for the past forty years. During a long career in education she made the acquaintance of the extended family of John Moriarty, and eventually of John himself. Fascinated by both his story and his message she embarked on a voyage into his books, to aim to uncover the whole story."
