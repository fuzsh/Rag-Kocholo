When the book “The Thousand and One Nights” was translated into French, the word “djinn” was transformed into the existing word “génie”, because of the similarity in sound and the related spiritual meaning. This “génie” from the Arabian tale became confused with the Latin-derived “genius”, a guardian spirit thought to be assigned to each person at birth. Purely as a result of that mistranslation the word genie has come to mean the “djinn” that pops out of the bottle. A little hard to follow, I know, but still quite interesting …\n\n13 Arkin of “Argo” : ALAN\n\nActor Alan Arkin won his only Oscar (Best Supporting Actor) for his role in “Little Miss Sunshine” from 2006 (a movie that I just did not understand!).

Arkin chose the name “Newlander” in honor of his wife Suzanne Newlander.\n\n“Argo” is a 2012 movie that is based on the true story of the rescue of six diplomats hiding out during the 1979 Iran hostage crisis. The film was directed by and stars Ben Affleck and is produced by Grant Heslov and George Clooney, the same pair who produced the excellent “Good Night, and Good Luck”. I highly recommend “Argo”, although I found the scenes of religious fervor to be very frightening …\n\n15 __ kebab : SHISH\n\nThe term “kebab” (also “kabob”) covers a wide variety of meat dishes that originated in Persia.

The Circus Maximus was over 2,000 feet long and just under 400 feet wide, and could house about 15,000 spectators. There is very little of the original structure remaining and the site is now used as a major park. It was the Circus Maximus and similar “circa” that gave rise to our contemporary word “circus” describing an arena used by clowns, acrobats, etc.\n\n18 1492 craft : PINTA\n\nFamously, Christopher Columbus used three ships in his first voyage across the Atlantic: the Santa Maria, the Niña and the Pinta.

The Pinta’s real name has been lost in the mists of time.\n\nEuropean colonization of the Americas began when Christopher Columbus’ made landfall in Hispaniola in 1492. Even though Columbus was Italian, his voyage was sponsored by Spain, and it was the Spanish who were to become the first Europeans to settle and colonize the New World.

Cabot’s expedition was funded by King Henry VII of England.\n\n19 Barcelona bar bites : TAPAS\n\nBarcelona is the second largest city in Spain, after the capital Madrid.
