Tragedies involve people dying at a young age, many people dying at once or deaths that could have been prevented with better timing or choices. Keep reading for examples of tragedy in literature and film, as well as various works that are considered tragedies.\n\nElements of a Tragedy\n\nThe tragedy genre is one of the main branches of literary drama. Beyond having a sad ending, a tragedy features a main character known as a tragic hero. According to Aristotle's Poetics, literary tragedies must include the following elements:\n\nhamartia - the protagonist's tragic flaw\n\nanagnorisis - a tragic hero's change of heart (usually too late)\n\nperipeteia - a reversal of the tragic hero's fortune; the turning point toward tragedy\n\ncatharsis - the release of emotions for the audience of a tragedy\n\nClassical tragedies use this formula in a straightforward way. Later literary tragedies, including Shakespearean tragedies, use these elements to craft heartbreaking stories in unique ways.\n\nExamples of Literary Tragedies\n\nLiterary tragedies bring the audience through a journey through the tragic hero's journey. Having learned the hero's tragic flaw, the audience watches them make terrible mistakes or suffer insurmountable challenges, leading to an ending marked by unnecessary death and suffering. Take a look at these literary Greek tragedies, as well as Shakespearean and modern literary tragedies.\n\nGreek Tragedies\n\nIn Sophocles' Oedipus Rex, for example, Oedipus has a tragic flaw — hubris, or excessive pride — which makes him a tragic hero. He has unknowingly killed his father and married his mother, Jocasta, to take the throne, which he learns in a moment of anagnorisis. His good fortune of a beautiful wife and kingdom is reversed, leading to the tragic death of Jocasta.\n\nOther examples of Greek tragedies include:\n\nAgamemnon - Aeschylus\n\nAntigone - Sophocles\n\nThe Argonautica - Apollonius Rhodius\n\nThe Bacchae - Euripides\n\nEumenides - Euripides\n\nThe Frogs - Aristophanes\n\nHippolytus - Euripides\n\nThe Iliad- Homer\n\nMedea - Euripides\n\nThe Odyssey - Homer\n\nOedipus Rex - Sophocles\n\nThe Oresteia - Aeschylus\n\nPrometheus Bound - Aeschylus\n\nThough human tragedy existed long before the works of Sophocles, Aeschylus and Euripides, dramatic tragedy did not. Greek drama was the birthplace of the literary tragedy, using elaborate sets and Greek choruses to fully demonstrate the dramatic impact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShakespearean Tragedies\n\nWilliam Shakespeare's Hamlet is one of his most well-known tragedies. Hamlet's tragic flaw is self-doubt, which prevents him from acting quickly to avenge his father. Many characters suffer untimely deaths due to this flaw, especially in the final act, in which Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, Queen Gertrude, King Claudius, Laertes, and Hamlet himself die (Polonius and Ophelia die in the previous acts).\n\nAdditional Shakespearean tragedies include:\n\nAntony and Cleopatra\n\nCoriolanus\n\nHamlet\n\nJulius Caesar\n\nKing Lear\n\nMacbeth\n\nOthello\n\nRomeo and Juliet\n\nTimon of Athens\n\nTitus Andronicus\n\nWilliam Shakespeare wrote around 37 plays in his lifetime, 10 of which were tragedies. They differ from his comedies and histories due to their characters' tragic endings, tragic flaws, and dramatic irony.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther Literary Tragedies\n\nGreek drama started literary tragedies, and Shakespeare perfected them, but you can find many modern examples of tragedies in literature as well. Take The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, for example, Jay Gatsby's tragic flaw is his idealism and inability to face reality. It results in the death of Myrtle Wilson, George Wilson and Gatsby himself, as he finally gives up on his lovelorn dream.\n\nMore examples of tragedies in literature include:\n\nAnna Karenina - Leo Tolstoy\n\nA Series of Unfortunate Events (series) - Lemony Snicket\n\nAtonement - Ian McEwan\n\nDeath of a Salesman - Arthur Miller\n\nThe Diary of a Young Girl - Anne Frank\n\nThe Fault in Our Stars - John Green\n\nFrankenstein - Mary Shelley\n\nThe Great Gatsby - F. Scott Fitzgerald\n\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins\n\nThe Kite Runner - Khaled Hosseini\n\nLes Misérables - Victor Hugo\n\nLolita - Vladimir Nabokov\n\nLooking for Alaska - John Green\n\nLord of the Flies - William Golding\n\nThe Lovely Bones - Alice Sebold\n\nMadame Bovary - Gustave Flaubert\n\nThe Night Trilogy - Elie Wiesel\n\nOedipus Rex - Sophocles\n\nOf Mice and Men - John Steinbeck\n\nThe Pearl - John Steinbeck\n\nTess of the d'Urbervilles - Thomas Hardy\n\nThirteen Reasons Why - Jay Asher\n\nThe Time Traveler's Wife - Audrey Niffenegger\n\nWuthering Heights - Emily Brontë\n\nNote that these examples don't include novels that simply end sadly or include death. Little Women by Louisa May Alcott is a very sad story, for example, but it is not a tragedy because Jo's flaws do not result in Beth's untimely death. Instead, Beth's passing brings her family even closer together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTragedies in Movies\n\nThe modern age of cinema has brought stories to life on the screen. These stories include dramas and comedies as well as tragedies. For example, in the satirical tragedy Parasite (2019), the Kim family's tragic flaw is poverty. It dooms them to a life of living off wealthy families, Ki-jung's untimely death and Ki-taek's undetermined but likely tragic end.\n\nOther examples of film tragedies include:\n\n21 Grams\n\nAmerican Beauty\n\nAmerican History X\n\nBabel\n\nBrokeback Mountain\n\nChinatown\n\nCrash\n\nDancer in the Dark\n\nDead Poet's Society\n\nThe English Patient\n\nEx Machina\n\nLast Tango in Paris\n\nMoulin Rouge\n\nParasite\n\nRequiem for a Dream\n\nSophie's Choice\n\nV for Vendetta\n\nWest Side Story\n\nMany characters in these movies just needed to wait another moment to avoid their tragic fate, while others could do nothing but watch it happen. Like books and other tragic works, these films can be classified as literary tragedies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFilms Based on Real-Life Tragedies\n\nTragedy in real life and tragedies in literature have different definitions. Literary tragedies have a devastating ending based on a character's flaws and decisions. Real-life tragedies are senseless, unavoidable and not deserved. Many films depict these real-life tragedies in both heartbreaking and uplifting ways. They include:\n\n9/11 - based on the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center\n\nBrian's Song - based on the life and 1970 death of football player Brian Piccolo\n\nBoys Don't Cry - based on the 1999 murder of Brandon Teena\n\nElephant - based on the 1999 Columbine High School shooting\n\nEverest - based on the 1996 Mount Everest expedition\n\nFruitvale Station - based on the 2009 police killing of Oscar Grant III\n\nHotel Rwanda - based on the 1994 Rwandan genocide\n\nThe Killing Fields - based on the 1973 Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia\n\nMilk - based on the life and 1978 murder of gay rights activist and politician Harvey Milk\n\nMississippi Burning - based on the 1964 murder of three civil rights activists\n\nMunich - based on the killings of 11 members of the 1972 Israeli Olympic team\n\nPatriots Day - based on the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing\n\nThe Perfect Storm - based on the 1991 deaths of the Andrea Gail fishing crew\n\nSelena - based on the life and 1995 death of singer Selena Quintanilla-Pérez\n\nSchindler's List - based on the Jewish Holocaust during World War II\n\nTitanic - based on the 1912 Titanic ship collision and sinking\n\nUnited 93 - based on the hijacking of United Airlines Flight 93 on September 11th, 2001\n\nIf you've seen any of these movies, you know that they focus on life, love, and loss. They are a valuable way to honor those who have passed and to ensure that their stories are told, not to illustrate the failings of a tragic hero.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLiterature Reveals the Human Condition\n\nTragedies in Greek drama, Shakespearean plays and modern films capture what it means to be human. While they may not be as enjoyable to watch as a romance or action-filled adventure, they bring their audiences catharsis — a healing release from tension and worry.
