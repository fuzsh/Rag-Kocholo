        "text": "Gospel of John, Mary in the\n\nThe Gospel of John and the Mother of Jesus\n\nThe text of John gives us evidence of some of the historical events in the life of Jesus and his followers and his family. There are also remembrances of traditions about Jesus and his followers and family which were not recorded elsewhere. The text of John, therefore, is of primary importance for it is the foundation for the Incarnation, that Jesus is truly the Son of God.\n\nJohn 1:13, Born of God\n\n\"Who were born, not of blood or of the will of the flesh or the will of man, but of God.\" [In several ancient Latin manuscripts this reads: \"who was born not of blood or the will of the flesh or the will of man, but of God.\"]\n\nJohn 2:1-12, The Cana Account\n\n1 On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.\n\n2 Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding.\n\n3 When the wine gave out, the mother of Jesus said to him, \"They have no wine.\"\n\n4 And Jesus said to her, \"Woman, what concern is that to you and me? My hour has not yet come.\"\n\n5 His mother said to the servants, \"Do whatever he tells you.\"\n\n6 Now standing there were six stone water jars for the Jewish rites of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons.\n\n7 Jesus said to them, \"Fill the jars with water.\" And they filled them to the brim.\n\n8 He said to them, \"Now draw some out, and take it to the chief steward.\" So they took it.\n\n9 When the steward tasted the water that had become wine, and did not know where it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), the steward called the bridegroom]\n\n10 and said to him, \"Everyone serves the good wine first, and then the inferior wine after the guests have become drunk. But you have kept the good wine until now.\"\n\n11 Jesus did this, the first of his signs, in Cana of Galilee, and revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him.\n\n12 After this he went down to Capernaum with his mother, his brothers, and his disciples; and they remained there a few days.\n\nJohn 6:42, Jesus the Son of Joseph\n\nThey were saying, \"Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can he now say, 'I have come down from heaven?'\n\nJohn 7:3-5, The Unbelief of Jesus' Brothers\n\n3 So his brothers said to him, \"Leave here and go to Judaea so that your disciples also may see the works you are doing;\n\n4 for no one who wants to be widely known acts in secret. If you do these things show yourself to the world.\"\n\n5 (For not even his brothers believed in him.).\n\nJohn 7:41-43; 8:41, Division Among the People About the Origins of the Messiah\n\n41 Others said, \"This is the Messiah.\" But some asked, \"Surely the Messiah does not come from Galilee, does he?\n\n42 Has not the Scripture said that the Messiah is descended from David and comes from Bethlehem, the village where David lived?\"\n\n43 So there was a division in the crowd because of him.\n\nJohn 8:41 \"You are indeed doing what your father does.\" They said to him, \"We are not illegitimate children; we have one father, God himself.\"\n\nJohn 19:25-28a, Mary and the Beloved Disciple at the Foot of the Cross\n\n25 Meanwhile, standing near the cross of Jesus were his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.\n\n26 When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing beside her, he said to his mother, \"Woman, here is your son.\"\n\n27 then he said to the disciple, \"Here is your mother.\" And from that hour the disciple took her into his own home."
