        "text": "Not happy with her standing in society, Mary engineered a plot for her handsome son George to seduce King James - but it's not all fine and dandy in the land of complete power.\n\nLed by Julianne Moore and Nicholas Galitzine (Red, White & Royal Blue) as the mother and son, the pair chatted exclusively to RadioTimes.com and teased \"tragedy\" to come.\n\nMoore said: \"I think, as we move through time, we watch them both kind of ascend in terms of where they are in this particular society.\"\n\nMore like this\n\nGalitzine added: \"I think as the story goes on, their intentions and outcomes kind of darken and become maybe more tragic in some capacity, without trying to ruin anything.\"\n\nAnd if you think it's too good to be true, Mary & George is actually based on real-life historical events - derived from Benjamin Woolley's The Fatal Affair of George Villiers and James I.\n\nFor a full account, you can purchase the book on Amazon or from a local bookseller of your choosing. But for a short overview of some of the biggest questions the series raises, read on.\n\nMary and George true story: Shocking history explained\n\nWas King James VI and I really gay?\n\nThe sexuality of King James VI and I has been the subject of debate for a long time.\n\nDuring his life, jokes and rumours about his homosexuality were common, due largely to how he surrounded himself with handsome, young men, whom he quite openly kissed, wrote about lovingly and shared a bed with.\n\nAn opposing view, that these so-called 'favourites' were just good friends and that 'masculinity' was expressed differently in those days, has become less prominent in recent years.\n\nSome historians, such as Michael B Young, suggest that it was partly fuelled by society's negative attitude towards same-sex relationships in the 20th century, with these biases no longer clouding the evidence to the same extent.\n\nPublicly, King James condemned what was then known as 'sodomy' (ie the act of anal sex), which was used by some historians to counter claims of his own homosexuality.\n\nHowever, Young noted that King James's excessive alcohol consumption and swearing exposed him as a hypocrite, while there's also a chance that he felt the rules of the time simply didn't apply to him. The phrase 'do as I say, not as I do' comes to mind.\n\nTherefore, modern historians tend to believe that King James VI and I was either bisexual or homosexual, with his fathering of eight children with Queen Anne of Denmark and likely sexual relationships with his male \"favourites\" suggesting the former.\n\nWho was Mary Villiers, Countess of Buckingham?\n\nMary Villiers came from the noble Beaumont family, but her standing in the upper classes of early modern Britain was far from assured – which is why she went to great lengths to shore it up.\n\nAfter her first husband, Sir George Villiers, died in 1606, she found herself on the brink of financial ruin, hatching a plan to work her way back into a world of opulent wealth.\n\nThat relied heavily on her second son, also named George, who she sent to the English Court, having likely heard of the king's widely rumoured interest in handsome, young men.\n\nSure enough, he went on to become one of the king's \"favourites\", which lifted the Villiers out of their economic peril and gave them considerable influence over the running of the country.\n\nRead More: Mary and George cast: Full list of actors and characters in Sky drama\n\nWhat was King James and George Villiers' relationship like?\n\nIn just over a decade, George Villiers climbed the ranks of the royal court to become King James's closest advisor.\n\nHe used his influence to benefit himself and his family, with this corruption narrowly avoiding formal punishment but making him an unpopular figure among the court – but importantly, not with the king himself.\n\nOn the contrary, King James proclaimed to love Villiers, the duke of Buckingham, \"more than anyone else\". However, in a bid to quash rumours of homosexuality, he instead compared their relationship to that of Jesus Christ and his disciple, John.\n\nKing James told his Privy Council in 1617: \"I wish to speak in my own behalf and not to have it thought to be a defect, for Jesus Christ did the same, and therefore I cannot be blamed. Christ had John, and I have George.\"\n\nRead More: Nicholas Galitzine opens up on “exciting” representation in Mary & George\n\nHow did King James IV of Scotland and I of England die?\n\nDuring the last years of his life, King James VI of Scotland and I of England suffered from various medical conditions and was frequently unwell with teeth loss, arthritis, gout, and kidney stones - all likely worsened by alcoholism.\n\nAs James became a more remote figure, George Villiers focused his attention on being the favourite and mentor of James's son, Charles, instead.\n\nIn 1625, the King's conditions worsened and he suffered fainting spells and from an infection of malaria preceded a stroke.\n\nA violent incident of dysentery followed and James died at the age of 58 on 27 March 1625 with George at his bedside.\n\nRead More: Mary & George’s Tony Curran: ‘It was a riot playing King James’\n\nDid George kill King James VI and I?\n\nNo, George Villiers did not kill King James, although there were accusations of a potential poisoning in the weeks following the monarch's death. These were ultimately dismissed.\n\nThe king suffered poor health for some time leading up to his demise, with arthritis, gout and kidney stones thought to be just some of the conditions that plagued him.\n\nUltimately, he passed while suffering dysentery, mere weeks after a case of tertian ague (a form of malaria) and a stroke, which had left him severely weakened.\n\nRead More:\n\nWhat happened to Mary and George Villiers?
