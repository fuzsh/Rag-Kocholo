        "text": "The Lede\n\nThe Story That “Hillbilly Elegy” Doesn’t Tell\n\nLike many memoirs, J. D. Vance’s book misses a few details, some of which complicate the story upon which he has based much of his politics.\n\nFault Lines\n\nWhat Makes Nancy Pelosi So Appealing Now\n\nHer ruthless pragmatism and reliance on subtext are refreshing after years of lefty infighting and Donald Trump’s endless blather.\n\nThe Front Row\n\nHow Agnès Varda Became an Icon of Cinema\n\nAn enthralling new biography shows the boldness and the freedom with which the French director confronted professional obstacles and personal troubles.\n\nQ. & A.\n\nThe Historical Forces Behind the Student Rebellion in Bangladesh\n\nThe country has long seesawed between two dynastic political parties, both with autocratic tendencies. Is the current youth-led movement charting a third path?\n\nThe Warped World of the U.K. Rioters\n\nThe United Kingdom has become more multicultural, but a wave of anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant violence raises the possibility that it is also becoming more racist.\n\nThe Russian Prisoner Who Didn’t Want to Be Freed\n\nThe opposition figure Ilya Yashin was part of the exchange that led to the release of Evan Gershkovich. Now, in Germany, he dreams of returning to his cell in Russia.\n\nElon Musk’s Surging Political Activism\n\nThe X C.E.O. has been using his platform to sound off on topics including Venezuela’s election, Trump’s campaign, and racial violence in the U.K.\n\nCould Eric Adams Lose Next Year?\n\nThe hosts of a plugged-in New York City politics podcast wonder if the Mayor is really as weak as his political opponents believe.\n\nOpen Questions\n\nAre We Living in the Age of Info-Determinism?\n\nIncreasingly, our networks seem to be steering our history in ways we don’t like and can’t control.\n\nInfinite Scroll\n\nPopping the Bubble of Noise-Cancelling Headphones\n\nA new Japanese-designed device promises to “unmute the world,” as if it were no longer possible to do so simply by uncovering your ears.\n\nThe Sporting Scene\n\nTim Walz and the Lessons of High-School Football\n\nThe Vice-Presidential nominee was the defensive coördinator for a team that won the state title. His players say that he taught them more about togetherness than tactics.\n\nFault Lines\n\nHow Generic Can Kamala Harris Be?\n\nThe Vice-President has answered few direct questions since becoming the presumptive nominee. This is probably good for her campaign, but not for voters.\n\nThe Current Cinema\n\nWith “Close Your Eyes,” a Legendary Filmmaker Makes a Stunning Return\n\nIn his first feature in more than two decades, the Spanish director Víctor Erice tells a story haunted by the ghosts of cinema past.\n\nUnder Review\n\nA Frank Account of an Unequal Art-World Friendship\n\nOrlando Whitfield’s memoir of his fifteen-year friendship with the disgraced art dealer Inigo Philbrick gives a momentous relationship its due, with unusual directness.\n\nCritics at Large\n\nCharli XCX, Chappell Roan, and the Unstable Hierarchy of Pop\n\nThis summer’s releases have breathed new life into the genre—and underscored the challenges of staying relevant in a cutthroat music landscape.\n\nCultural Comment\n\nIn “The Texas Chain Saw Massacre,” Feeding Your Family Comes First\n\nFifty years on, the film reads like sociology: assembly lines make the working class deranged, technology makes them irrelevant, and unemployment makes them hungry.\n\nBooks\n\nIs the End of Marriage the Beginning of Self-Knowledge?\n\nIn “Liars,” Sarah Manguso presents divorce as a way for women to reassert an essential identity that’s been effaced by coercive social scripts.\n\nThe Art World\n\nThe Bad Dream of Surrealism\n\nA hundred years ago, the movement hoped to topple reality and reason. Its true achievements lie elsewhere.\n\nWhat Tweens Get from Sephora\n\nKids are mimicking the semi-professionals they see on their phones, imbibing ideas about beauty rooted in deep desires and capitulations.\n\nTwo Paths for Jewish Politics\n\nIn America, Jews pioneered a way of life that didn’t rely on the whims of the powerful. Now it’s under threat.\n\nHow a Rare Disorder Makes People See Monsters\n\nA mysterious neurological condition makes faces look grotesque—and sheds new light on the inner workings of the brain.\n\nHow Christian Fundamentalism Was Born Again\n\nNearly a century ago, a single trial seemed to shatter the movement’s place in America. It’s returned in a new form—but for old reasons."
