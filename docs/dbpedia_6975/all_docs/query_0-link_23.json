        "text": "The Leisure Seeker (2017)\n\nFilm legends Donald Sutherland and Helen Mirren, playing the roles of John and Ella Spencer, are off on a road trip from Massachusetts to Florida in their RV. They've been together more than 50 years. Ella has stopped treatments for cancer and John has Alzheimer's disease.\n\nTheir illnesses are evident as they make one last adventure together, running away from their doctors and their kids and stopping at roadside tourist attractions and diners.\n\n\"My John is charming, educated,\" says Ella one night in an RV park, dealing with her confused husband. \"You stole him from me and I want you to give him back.\"\n\nJohn reaches for her hand and answers, \"Whoever stole him from you, stole him from me, too.\" The film reflects their love and determination as they face end-of-life changes.\n\nThe Father (2020)\n\nOctogenarian actor Anthony Hopkins plays the role of Anthony, a man increasingly frustrated by his dementia as he seeks to maintain an independent life in the 2020 film \"The Father,\" directed by Florian Zeller.\n\nHis daughter Anne (Olivia Colman) moves to London to assist with his care. As the film evolves, though, it becomes clear that there are many aspects of his life that Anthony misperceives, and the audience experiences this confusion along with him.\n\n\"The Father\" captures both Anthony's pain at losing his sense of self through the lens of a blurred reality, and the sorrow of those who love him.\n\nFor his work, Hopkins won awards for the leading actor role from both the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) and the Academy Awards in the United States. The film has been used to educate medical students about dementia.\n\nWhat They Had (2018)\n\nActor Blythe Danner, playing the role of Ruth, first wanders off into the snow in the 2018 film \"What They Had.\"\n\nIt's what leads her daughter Bridget, played by Hilary Swank, to return home to Chicago to help care for Ruth as Alzheimer's disease claims her memory and independence.\n\nThe film, directed by Elizabeth Chomko, pays special attention to the impact on caregivers of those with dementia.\n\n\"What They Had\" was well-received by the AARP and other advocates of aging, and received recognition from several film festivals and awards programs, including a Humanitas nomination.\n\nRemember (2015)\n\nThe late Christopher Plummer starred in \"Remember\" as a man who survived the Holocaust at Auschwitz. But, in his twilight years in New York City, he realizes that dementia will prevent him from finishing a mission to avenge the World War II deaths of his family.\n\nSo he begins his quest to kill the man rumored to be responsible.\n\nThe 2015 film from director Atom Egoyan is a thriller rather than a \"feel good\" film. Yet that's partly why the film succeeds at capturing the complexity of Zev Guttman, whose mission is often as unclear as his thoughts.\n\nElizabeth is Missing (2019)\n\nGlenda Jackson stars as Maud, a woman living with dementia, in the 2019 film \"Elizabeth Is Missing\" from film director Aisling Walsh. It aired on BBC One in the United Kingdom rather than as a box office release.\n\nIt snagged numerous awards and nominations, including a 2020 International Emmy Award for Jackson and another leading actress award from BAFTA. The film follows Maud's journey as she tries to understand a mystery about her missing friend, and how the mists of memory about a long-lost sister shape her experience.\n\nPeople in the United States can catch \"Elizabeth Is Missing\" on PBS Masterpiece.\n\nStill Alice (2014)\n\nIn this American movie based on Lisa Genova's 2007 bestselling book of the same name, Julianne Moore stars as Alice Howland, a professor diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease, which affects people younger than 65 years old.\n\nHer husband is played by Alec Baldwin, and her children are played by Kristen Stewart, Kate Bosworth, and Hunter Parrish.\n\nWhile some critics found the movie powerfulâ€”especially since it's told by Alice herselfâ€”others criticized the movie for holding back when it came to how this familial type of Alzheimer's may have affected Alice's children.\n\nAway From Her (2007)\n\nIn \"Away From Her,\" Julie Christie was Oscar-nominated for Best Actress for her portrayal of Fiona, a woman with Alzheimer's who voluntarily enters a long-term care facility to avoid being a burden on Grant, her husband of 50 years.\n\nAfter a 30-day separation recommended by the facility, Grant visits Fiona and finds that her memory of him has deteriorated and that she's developed a close friendship with another man in the facility.\n\nGrant must draw upon the pure love and respect he has for Fiona to choose what will ensure his wife's happiness.\n\nChristie won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture (Drama) for her performance in this movie. It's among the films studied for their depiction of dementia diseases.\n\nLovely, Still (2008)\n\nThis 2008 romantic comedy-drama was directed by Nik Fackler and stars Martin Landau, Ellen Burstyn, Adam Scott, and Elizabeth Banks.\n\nIt tells the story of a lonesome older man named Robert (Landau) who is surprised to be asked on a date by his new neighbor, Mary (Burstyn).\n\nThe film takes place leading up to the Christmas season and goes through the couples blooming romance. However, it soon becomes clear that Robert is struggling.\n\nEventually, we find out that he has Alzheimer's, and we see a portrayal of \"the long goodbye\" that many loved ones of people living with the condition experience.\n\nAurora Borealis (2005)\n\nCritics considered this movie a well-crafted independent film that was released under the radar.\n\nStars Donald Sutherland (again) and Louise Fletcher steal the showâ€”Sutherland plays a grandfather with dementia who requires more care than his wife (Fletcher) can take on.\n\nThey get help from their grandson (Joshua Jackson) and a home health aide (Juliette Lewis). The two forge a friendship as Sutherland's character (who insists he can see the Northern Lights from his window) becomes increasingly impaired by the condition.\n\nIris: A Memoir of Iris Murdoch (2001)\n\nBased on the book \"Elegy for Iris\" by John Bayley, this movie tells the true story of English novelist Iris Murdoch developing Alzheimer's and the unconditional love of Bayley, her partner of 40 years.\n\nJim Broadbent won an Academy Award and a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Bayley in his later years.\n\nJudi Dench and Kate Winslet were nominated for Academy Awards and Golden Globes (Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress, respectively) for their portrayals of Murdoch at different points in her life.\n\nAge Old Friends (1989)\n\nIn this classic film, Hume Cronyn gave a great performance as John Cooper, who chose to live in a retirement home instead of with his daughter (played by Cronyn's real-life daughter Tandy Cronyn), as a symbol of maintaining his independence.\n\nWhile there, John befriends Michael (Vincent Gardenia), who starts showing signs of dementia. When John's daughter extends an offer to live with her again, he must decide between leaving the rigid structure of the retirement home and staying to help his friend cope."
