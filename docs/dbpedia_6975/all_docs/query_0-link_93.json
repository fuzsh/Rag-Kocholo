        "text": "The movie distributors compartmentalize the year by season -- summer, fall, holiday -- each season indicative of a certain kind of mood or movie. Summer is light and carefree, aimed at all the kids out of school with time on their hands; fall is for the heavier dramatic fare, aimed at the adults who've been patiently waiting their turn; and the holidays are reserved for the movies most likely to generate award nominations. Of course, this is a generalized outline, and there are many exceptions, as well as an increasing appreciation of the value of counter-programming.\n\nBut the spring has always been a no man's land, neither fish nor fowl to the quick-to-categorize movie industry. Holiday leftovers clog the movie theatres during the early months of each year, much as they clog your refrigerator at home. Theatre bookings are somewhat more porous since the hits are not always predictable. It's also a good time to bring back that Oscar nominee from earlier in the year. And the early part of the year can also serve as a dumping ground for movies whose distributors prefer they slip from the visible horizon.\n\nIt used to be that Memorial Day marked the official beginning of the summer season. Last time I checked, Memorial Day always fell on the last Monday of May. (To tell the truth, though, the last time I checked the holiday might have still been called Decoration Day.) Now the studios keep pushing up the launch of their summer movies as they try to outposition each other and get a jump on the season. Things have finally gotten out of hand this year. Universal has pushed up the opening date of The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas from May 12 to May 5 and now April 28.\n\nSo, how to make sense of such a hodgepodge of a season in which just about anything goes? There are, without question, movies here to satisfy all tastes: dramas, comedies, teen pictures, animation, re-releases, documentaries, and foreign. The selections are broad, and we hope that these previews provide a few pointers.\n\nOur survey covers approximately 100 films that are expected to open theatrically in Austin between the months of March and the end of May. Opening dates, when provided, are listed and reflect the specific dates movies are expected to first roll out locally. Movies that have no date by them are at least expected to open in the month they are listed. All dates and titles are subject to change. -- Marjorie Baumgarten\n\nMarch\n\nBEAUTIFUL PEOPLE\n\nD: Jasmin Dizdar; with Charlotte Coleman, Charles Kay, Rosalind Ayres, Roger Sloman, Heather Tobias, Danny Nussbaum, Gilbert Martin.\n\nFramed against the rich backdrop of modern-day London, this film by Bosnian filmmaker Jasmin Dizdar catalogs the random interactions between four inter-linked British families whose chance encounters with a troupe of refugees from the former Yugoslavia force them to deal with issues of heroism, prejudice, and death. (Mar. 10)\n\nTHE BIG TEASE\n\nD: Kevin Allen; with Craig Ferguson, Frances Fisher, Chris Langham, Mary McCormack, Donal Logue, Larry Miller.\n\nPress materials for this Scottish comedy describe the story as \"Rocky in curlers.\" The action kicks off when a misunderstanding lands Glasgow's wackiest hairdresser (Ferguson) on the shores of Los Angeles to compete in the World Freestyle Hairdressing Championship.

Writer-director Zhang Yimou (Raise the Red Lantern, Ju Dou) also takes a leave of absence from his typically opulent dramas for this more \"neorealistic\" modern tale about poverty, social systems, and peasant determination. (Mar. 31)\n\nRESTAURANT\n\nD: Eric Ross; with Adrien Brody, Elise Neal, Malcolm Jamal-Warner, Lauryn Hill.\n\nHollywood \"It Boy\" Brody plays a New Jersey waiter struggling to launch his playwrighting career and hold on to his relationship with African-American singer Jeanine (Neal). Ross' amiable comedy about relationships both interracial and intraracial has toured the festival circuit, and should get some added play since it marks R&B diva Lauryn Hill's feature film debut.

Petersen.\n\nIn this dramatic thriller, Jackson (Pacey on Dawson's Creek) plays a student at Yale, who discovers a decades-old secret society which purportedly spawned the CIA.

From the producer of Dumb and Dumber, and the co-writer of Friday, this tale of urban hijinks could hit home. (Mar. 1)\n\nTUMBLEWEEDS\n\nD: Gavin O'Connor; with Janet McTeer, Kimberly Brown, Gavin O'Connor.\n\nA wild and spirited mother (McTeer) totes around her only loyal companion, daughter Ava (Brown), from city to city, leaving jilted lovers behind.

With a soundtrack that dips into selections ranging from Tchaikovsky to the Red Hot Chili Peppers, the film offers a rarely exposed glimpse into the highly competitive world of stage performance. (Apr. 21)\n\nEAST-WEST\n\nD: Regis Wargnier; with Sandrine Bonnaire, Oleg Menchikov, Sergeui Bodrov Jr., Catherine Deneuve.\n\nPost-WWII film encapsulates Stalin's immense propaganda campaign, which aimed to lure Russian emigrants living in the West to return home with the promise of amnesty, a Soviet passport, and an opportunity to aid in the reconstruction of war-torn Mother Russia.

Figgis describes the story, all filmed in sequence and in real time, as a black comedy centering around a group of Los Angelenos involved in an affair, a murder, and a Hollywood mystery. (Apr. 28)\n\n28 DAYS\n\nD: Betty Thomas; with Sandra Bullock, Dominic West, Viggo Mortensen, Azura Skye, Steve Buscemi, Elizabeth Perkins.\n\nA drunk-driving accident lands a partying New York writer (Bullock) in rehab where a whole cast of eclectic characters prey upon her to examine her life. To be certain, this is edgier material than America's girl next door normally frequents, but with director Thomas (Private Parts) behind the camera, we can expect a fair share of comedy and romance as well. (Apr. 7)\n\nU-571\n\nD: Jonathan Mostow; with Matthew McConaughey, Bill Paxton, Harvey Keitel, Jon Bon Jovi.\n\nAustin's own McConaughey stars in this action-thriller from the producer and director of Breakdown.

(Apr. 21)\n\nWELCOME BACK MR. MCDONALD\n\nD: Koki Mitani; with Toshiaki Karasawa, Kyoka Suzuki, Masahiko Nishimura, Keiko Toda.\n\nThe American title of this Japanese film makes this comedy sound like the cheery bottom half of a double bill with Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence. The movie sets the stage for farce when a live radio drama goes haywire and begins a whole chain of events. (Apr. 7)\n\nWHERE THE HEART IS\n\nD: Matt Williams; with Natalie Portman, Stockard Channing, Simon Bennett, Joan Cusack, Ashley Judd.\n\nBased on Billie Letts' acclaimed novel of the same name, this edgy teen drama centers around a young pregnant girl (Portman), who is abandoned on her way to California at an Oklahoma Wal-Mart store where she bonds with local workers and residents.

After starring in the disappointing Message in a Bottle and Twilight, Newman should be due for a hit. (Apr. 14)\n\nX\n\nD: Rintarro.\n\nJapanimation by the director of Astro Boy is based on the manga of the same name. This 1996 animation features a millennial theme about about the future of the universe, and a popular musical score. (Apr. 14)\n\nTHE YARDS\n\nD: James Gray; with Mark Wahlberg, Joaquin Phoenix, Charlize Theron, Faye Dunaway, Ellen Burstyn, James Caan.\n\nDirector Gray (Little Odessa) returns to his beloved New York to lens a portrait of a family living at the edge of civilization and a place where the rules of a law-abiding society part company. Filmed with a purposefully gritty and dark cinematic quality, this modest story, told in the city's subway yards, promises yet another notable turn from Wahlberg.\n\nMay\n\nBATTLEFIELD EARTH\n\nD: Roger Christian; with John Travolta, Barry Pepper, Forest Whitaker, Kim Coates, Sabine Karsenti, Kelly Preston.\n\nBased on Scientology guru L. Ron Hubbard's bestselling tome of the same name, this sci-fi movie, championed by Travolta, centers around the invasion of Earth by an advanced alien species.

(May 12)\n\nTHE BIG KAHUNA\n\nD: John Swanbeck; with Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, Peter Facinella.\n\nWriter Roger Rueff translated his own play Hospitality Suite for this big-screen adaptation in which three men offer diatribes on a range of \"life issues\"over the course of one evening in a Wichita, Kansas, hotel room.

(May 5)\n\nDINOSAUR\n\nD: Ralph Zondag and Eric Leighton.; with the voices of D.B. Sweeney, Alfre Woodard, Ossie Davis, Max Casella, Hayden Panettiere, Samuel E. Wright, Julianna Margulies, Pater Siragusa, Joan Plowright, Della Reese.\n\nDisney takes the plunge into computer animation with this new work that capitalizes on kids' timeless fascination with those prehistoric creatures who ruled the earth in a \"land before time.\" The plot is timeless too.
