        "text": "Janet McTeer as Prue Sarn and John Bowe as Kester Woodseaves (1989 BBC Precious Bane)\n\nDear friends and readers,\n\nI watched this powerful two-hour film last night, partly because I’ve had it so long and it has Janet McTeer in the star role, the disabled heroine.\n\nWe read and discussed Mary Webb’s Precious Bane and Gone to Earth on WomenWritersThroughtheAges ast Yahoo some years ago. It’s a woman’s take or version of Hardy through Lawrentian-Freudian lenses. They were shallowly made fun of by Stella Gibbons in her famous Cold Comfort Farm.\n\nThe film is pre-1991 (turning point, the BBC Clarissa) and thus the old style BBC type in that the actors have been chosen for type (not against it), because they seem to embody the author’s conception physically as well as emotionally and intellectually. It’s not over-lavish, not over-produced. John Bowe made a debut as the loving tender sane man who rescues Prue Sam from the madness of a primitive world. Several actors made their debut here beyond Bowe: Clive Owen (rather chubbier than he is today) was Gidebon Sarn, the rigid cruel brother who exploits, bullies, frightens Janice Beguildy (Emily Morgan), his fiancee, Prue, his sister (who works selflessly for him), his mother too (whose death he engineers).\n\nJanice and Gideon against the wide seascape\n\nHe is not alone; the other older men beat their daughters and wives; Janice’s father tries to sell her more than once. The women have nowhere to turn and grieve intensely when they lose their tyrants to death or alcoholism. Jim Carter (an established character actor by this time, most recently Mr Carson the butler at Downton Abbey) makes a memorable brief appearance as Prue’s resentful damaging father who dies of heart failure at the film’s opening. Milton Johns ever the sneak, spiteful, vile (he was in the older Poldark films, as John Dashwood in the 1971 S&S) is good form here: he almost manages to have Prue drowned, and is shown up (yet again) for a coward.\n\nHere was a strong feminist thread — far stronger than the original novel — where we are shown how used and abused the women are, beaten, murdered, vilified and abused (the last two reminded me of the Republicans running for and in office around the US today). The woman are loyal to one another and quietly try to help one another, but as they must obey and follow the men their relationships are not primarily to be with and for one another but to and for and through the men — as in Webb’s desperate desolate book.\n\nJanet McTeer is one of the recent actresses who chooses her roles to embody this kind of agenda. The heroine comes near total destruction, nearly drowned as a witch. Her portrait reminded me of George Eliot’s heroines: Immolating herself before her family, conventions, brother, with the difference we see clearly she does it here out of desperation not because her feelings lead her that way totally. And she comes near drowning; as she is plunged in and struggles I remembered so many Eliot heroines (Romola pushing off into the sea, Maggie drowning herself trying to rescue her bully brother, Hetty in Adam Bede starring into a black pond.) Janet McTeer would make a fine Romola. Well here she was impeccable; a tall calf.\n\nIt’s also story of how people treat disability (and there we pick up Gaskell); how she becomes idiotic, becomes without power in herself, can be turned around to be so much more competent, hopeful pro-active when those around her change their attitudes towards her.\n\nMaggie Wadey also has had a career of feminist and woman-centered critical films. She did the remarkable 1987 Northanger Abbey, a kind of Anne Radcliffe film.\n\nThe film does not glorify or revel in this primitive world romantically the way I remember Webb’s book (and Lawrence) doing. The natural world is an ambivalent one: hard work, hard to make a living, easy for people to set on fire and destroy all one man makes as revenge. The women in this film may stand quietly but they are not abject (see critique of book). Stella Gibbons would not have satirized the book had it had the slant of this movie. It’s for education as a way up: Kester Woodseaves leaves Prue (and she is almost drowned without him) to learn a trade. This reminded me much of Hardy: indeed the film was made into a strong Hardy-type fable (rather like The Return of the Native than Webb’s original, though Webb’s work is rooted in Hardy.\n\nIt’s so tightly realized; the actors move so swiftly and live in one another’s flesh, blood, seem to dwell within the forces of nature, just are so thoroughly immersed.\n\nIt was a darkened Shropshire\n\nI can see too why the 1996 Poldark angered its audience; the way this film is done is the way the 1996 Poldark was and the original books and films were not about primitive nature, landscape and people, but an enlightenment political fable. John Bowe was the man chosen to do Ross Poldark — that I do understand.\n\nI recommend seeing Precious Bane; it’s more relevant than ever — and perhaps its book newly relevant as we seem to lurch backwards if some very harmful people get into power that’s what will happen in the US.\n\nEllen"
