        "text": "Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus\n\nnovel by Shelley\n\nRecent News\n\nJuly 30, 2024, 7:59 PM ET (BBC)\n\nFrankenstein gothic horror experience coming to Bath\n\nFrankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus, Gothic horror novel by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley that was first published in 1818. The epistolary story follows a scientific genius who brings to life a terrifying monster that torments its creator. It is considered one of the first science-fiction novels. An international sensation, the story has been adapted hundreds of times in different media and has influenced pop culture at large.\n\n(Read Britannica’s explanation of the science behind “Frankenstein.”)\n\nWriting and publication\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nFamous Novels, Last Lines Quiz\n\nMary Wollstonecraft Shelley’s personal story, much like the focus of her fictional masterpiece, was mired in the struggle of giving life while surrounded by death. Her mother was radical author Mary Wollstonecraft, a trailblazing feminist who advocated for women’s education. Wollstonecraft attempted suicide two years before her daughter was born and died just 11 days after the birth, from puerperal fever. Wollstonecraft’s husband and the infant’s father, William Godwin, was also a radical writer and an anarchist philosopher committed to Enlightenment ideals of rationality. Born to these parents and introduced to the circle of writers in which they moved—which included, at various times, Thomas Paine, William Blake, and William Wordsworth—Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin was uniquely positioned to make her own way in the literary scene.\n\nGodwin became pregnant at 16 and eloped with the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, who was 21 and frequently visited her father. The infant, a girl, would die soon after her birth in March 1815. Subsequently, Godwin wrote in her journal of a dream in which she coaxed her child back to life. She was pregnant a second time just weeks later and gave birth to William Shelley in January 1816. Percy Shelley was married to another woman who was pregnant at the time, and yet he fled with Godwin, their infant son, and her stepsister Claire Clairmont from the controversy of his situation. The travelers met the poet Lord Byron, who was dodging an extramarital scandal of his own, at a mansion known as Villa Diodati in Cologny, Switzerland, during the summer of 1816. The season was atypical—cold, gloomy, and rife with storms—possibly because of the 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora in what is now Indonesia, and 1816 became known as the “year without a summer.”\n\nOn inclement evenings when forced indoors by the weather, the group regaled themselves with Fantasmagoriana, an anthology of German ghost stories translated into French in 1812. These tales had a profound impact on Godwin, who would, 15 years later, recall several of them with considerable clarity, including “The History of the Inconstant Lover” and “The Tale of the Sinful Founder of His Race.” One evening, for sport, Byron suggested that each person present attempt to write a story that could rival those in Fantasmagoriana. Byron’s physician John Polidori attained some success with “The Vampyre,” which he produced during his stay in Villa Diodati; it would later influence Bram Stoker’s Dracula. Yet it was Godwin who pieced together an outline for what would be the most enduring work to come out of Byron’s contest—and out of her career. “I have found it!” she wrote in 1831, recalling the moment in 1816 when she realized what she was creating, “What terrified me will terrify others; and I need only describe the spectre which had haunted my midnight pillow”: a monster, created by a mad scientist blinded by ambition, that tortures its creator.\n\nThe months following that moment were full of challenges for Godwin, who was only 18 years old at the time. That same year, Shelley’s first wife took her own life, as did Godwin’s half sister. Godwin and Shelley married in December 1816. Mary Shelley, then living in Bath, England, became pregnant for a third time, although Percy Shelley was often absent. It was in these circumstances that she drafted the bulk of her novel.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nOn the first day of the year 1818, 500 copies of Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus were printed anonymously on the cheapest paper available by a largely unknown London publisher. Mary Shelley was 20 years old. She did not immediately claim authorship because of the novel’s controversial contents, but Frankenstein quickly exploded in popularity. By August a family friend of the Shelleys was telling them that Frankenstein “seems to be universally read.” The edition included a preface written by Percy Shelley and a dedication to Mary’s father, William Godwin, leading many to believe that either man was the author. While Percy Shelley did have some influence on the novel, Mary Shelley’s manuscripts show his role to have been that of an editor, not a creator. Four years later, after a popular theatrical production based on the story was staged, Mary Shelley released a new edition of Frankenstein, under her name and with minor edits likely from her father.\n\nIn 1831 she published a third edition of Frankenstein, including an introduction describing her inspirations. She credited Fantasmagoriana, her childhood years spent in Scotland, contemporary theories of galvanism, discussions among the three men at Villa Diodati concerning the “principle of life,” the experiments on spontaneous vitality by Erasmus Darwin, and, finally, a waking nightmare she experienced that conjured a student horrified by the result of his own vivification of assembled human body parts. Other, possible connections between Mary Shelley’s life and her novel include a trip she and her husband-to-be took along the Rhine in 1814, where she may have spied Frankenstein Castle. There, during the 18th century, theologian and alchemist Johann Konrad Dippel was rumoured to have been studying artificial life—even, supposedly, engaging in grave robbing as part of his research. (How much Shelley actually knew of Dippel is unknown.) William Frankenstein, the monster’s first victim, is thought to have been based on William Shelley—the Shelleys’ beloved second child, who died of an illness at three years old in 1819. In Shelley’s text, Victor Frankenstein discusses at length his admiration for the mountains and lakes of his homeland in Switzerland—a sentiment perhaps born of the Shelleys’ 1816 vacation.\n\nMuch like its eponymous character, Frankenstein was followed by tragedy: Polidori committed suicide in 1821; Percy Shelley drowned in 1822; Byron died of fever in 1824. Of Mary Shelley’s four children, only one would survive. Shelley herself died in 1851 at 53 years old. In her 1831 introduction, she wrote of Frankenstein:\n\nAnd now, once again, I bid my hideous progeny go forth and prosper. I have an affection for it, for it was the offspring of happy days, when death and grief were but words, which found no true echo in my heart. Its several pages speak of many a walk, many a drive, and many a conversation, when I was not alone.\n\nJust in 2016, nearly 50,000 copies of Frankenstein were sold—a testament to the novel’s enduring popularity, considering that this figure is 100 times the number of copies produced in the novel’s first printing. One of the original 500 copies of Frankenstein sold at auction in 2021 for $1.17 million, breaking the record for a printed work by a woman.\n\nPlot summary\n\nFrankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus opens with a series of letters from Robert Walton to his sister Margaret Saville in England. Walton describes his preparations for, and embarkation on, an exploratory sea voyage toward the North Pole. The trip begins easily enough, but the ship and crew are soon bogged down by impassable ice. As they wait for more-favourable conditions, they spy a hulking man on a dogsled speeding across the ice. The next day, another dogsled appears, this time beside the ship, bearing a haggard but gentlemanly European. A lonely Walton takes in the freezing traveler and nurses him back to health, finding the newcomer to be an intelligent, welcome companion, despite his concerning bouts of gloom.\n\nEncouraged by their growing friendship, the newcomer agrees to spill his tale of woe to Walton, who makes it his duty to record the story verbatim. The newcomer—Victor Frankenstein—goes on to tell his life story, beginning with his distinguished ancestry and the circumstances under which his father and mother came to be married. Victor is the firstborn of a wealthy Swiss family, and he describes an idyllic childhood. He had two brothers, Ernest and William, and a sister by adoption, Elizabeth, who was a dear friend to Victor and a natural choice for his future wife. His best friend, Henry Clerval, who spent nearly all his time with the Frankenstein family, was the son of a local merchant.\n\nIn his youth, Frankenstein was set to travel to Ingolstadt, Bavaria, to pursue an interest in natural science at the town’s university, but his departure was delayed by the death of his mother from scarlet fever. Once in Ingolstadt, Frankenstein impressed his professors with his intensive work ethic. During this unrelenting period of study, Frankenstein unraveled the mysteries of life and death. He then set his mind to animating a creature in a human likeness, albeit on a gargantuan scale. His frenetic pursuit of this goal left no room for thought of his family or even his own health. He plundered graves and morgues with a dispassionate eye, seeing only components for his future creation, and heartlessly employed vivisection for his experiments.\n\nThen, “on a dreary night of November” at one o’clock in the morning, Frankenstein imbued his humanlike creation with the spark of life. Frankenstein fled at the sight of the unnatural creature, wandering through the night before fortuitously running into his old friend Clerval, who had just arrived to attend the university. Not long afterward, Frankenstein suffered a nervous breakdown stemming from the horrible memories of his experiment. A fever incapacitated him for months. Frankenstein recuperated slowly, but then he received a letter from his father relating the murder of his youngest brother, William.\n\nWhile on his journey back home, Frankenstein spotted the 8-foot- (2.4-metre-) tall monster on an inaccessible mountainside and became convinced that his creation was his brother’s killer. But when he arrived at home, he found that all evidence pointed to a family friend named Justine, who was soon executed for the murder. Frankenstein was wracked with guilt, knowing that he had created the true murderer but that no one would believe him. A couple of months later, Frankenstein once again came into contact with the monster. The scientist attempted to attack his creation before finally deciding to hear out the eloquent creature’s tale.\n\nThe monster, after his inception, had survived in the woods with little knowledge of the world. It took time for him to understand his own senses, much less his environment. Early on, he ventured toward villages for shelter, but people chased him away with fear and violence. He ended up hiding in a hovel by a small cottage inhabited by a poor family. This family was teaching a foreigner how to speak and read French, and the monster followed these lessons diligently. He grew in knowledge but also in love for the good-natured inhabitants of the cottage, although they did not know of his existence. Finally, the monster decided to reveal himself to them and appeal to their compassion; disgusted and shocked by his appearance, one of the family members attacked him.\n\nThe monster, enraged after such a rejection, made humanity his enemy and set his mind on revenge. Successive violent encounters with humans only deepened the monster’s misanthropy, all naivete and kindness leaving him. He sought out Frankenstein, his creator, to right the injustices he faced as an outcast. In a hiding place on the outskirts of Geneva, the monster noticed a child nearby. He believed he could kidnap the child and raise it not to fear him. As he grappled with the child, the monster learned that it was a Frankenstein. Consequently, he delighted in strangling the boy—William—and he planted evidence of the crime on Justine.\n\nThe monster finished telling his saga with a request: that Frankenstein would create a female counterpart to the monster so that he would no longer suffer alone. Frankenstein reluctantly agreed after the monster swore to leave Europe with his mate and never return.\n\nIt was supposedly to raise Frankenstein’s spirits that he and Clerval began a tour of England and Scotland, during which Frankenstein secretly gathered and prepared materials for his second creation. Frankenstein then separated from Clerval for some time, despite the latter’s protestations, so that he could hide in a hut on the remote Orkney Islands to complete the new creature. Finally, as the body of the monster’s intended companion lay before the scientist, fit for animation, Frankenstein had second thoughts. He considered the female monster’s autonomy, that she might not willingly follow her counterpart away from Europe, and the monsters’ possible proliferation, which could result in a race that threatened all of humanity. Then he saw the monster at the hut’s window, grinning devilishly. At this, Frankenstein tore apart the inanimate female body. The monster fled, swearing revenge.\n\nFrankenstein dumped the remains in the ocean, and when he returned to land, the locals had him arrested for murder. Frankenstein was shown the cadaver of the victim: Clerval. Seeing the marks of the monster’s hands on Clerval’s throat threw Frankenstein into a period of suicidal madness. It was not until after Frankenstein’s father arrived that the court cleared his name. He was allowed to leave, his state of mind having only slightly improved during his three months in prison.\n\nFrankenstein and his father returned to Geneva, where Frankenstein prepared to marry Elizabeth. The two were in love, despite Frankenstein’s deep sorrow and unrest. He feared that the monster would attempt to kill him on the night of the wedding, but he resolved to make such an encounter a worthwhile battle and an end to the exhausting clash of wills. The ceremony having concluded, the couple shared a moment of rare happiness during a peaceful boat ride to the inn where they would spend the night. Wishing to spare Elizabeth the distress of the oncoming battle, he then bid his new wife to retire but did not explain what he expected to happen. Then he heard Elizabeth scream. He rushed into their bedroom to find her also murdered by the monster. After Frankenstein’s father heard the news of Elizabeth’s death, the tragedy was too much for the elder man to bear, and he soon died. Frankenstein then plunged into a stretch of insanity so severe that later he could not recall any moment of it. He learned that he had been chained in solitary confinement.\n\nOnce recovered, Frankenstein focused on revenge. He tracked the monster to the sea of ice around the North Pole. The monster sometimes left hints and taunts to ensure Frankenstein’s pursuit. As Frankenstein drew closer, the ice beneath him suddenly ruptured and left him and his sledge adrift. It was then that he happened upon Walton’s ship, and it is here that he concludes his history with a plea: if he should die before realizing his revenge, Walton must take any opportunity to slay his enemy.\n\nWalton’s letters to his sister resume. He tells of Frankenstein’s oratory and intelligence, which woo not only him but also his crew. Yet Frankenstein’s health continues to decline. After several days of danger at sea, the crew persuades Walton to turn the ship back south toward England. Frankenstein succumbs to his illness, reiterating his plea to Walton with his last words.\n\nHearing a voice in Frankenstein’s quarters, Walton discovers none other than the monster hovering over the dead scientist, expressing his grief and remorse. Walton is horrified at the monster’s unnatural appearance and colossal proportions. However, he composes himself and chastises the monster for the violence and heartlessness of his actions. The monster responds by lamenting his wretched state of loneliness and the immense guilt he feels for the murders he committed in revenge. Yet he feels that the death of Frankenstein, his final victim, means his work is complete. He wants to end his mental anguish, and death is the only possible relief. He tells Walton that he will ride to the furthest point north and burn himself, so that no person could ever find his remains and possibly manufacture another monster. Then he disappears into the cold and darkness.\n\nAnalysis and interpretation\n\nFrankenstein contains elements traditionally associated with both the Romantic and the Enlightenment eras. When Shelley’s novel was published, a Romantic sensibility was flourishing in Great Britain, and it was particularly apparent in the era’s poetry. Romanticism’s focus on subjectivity and the emotions of the individual are apparent in both Victor Frankenstein and his monster. Frankenstein is prone to intense bouts of despondency, his anxieties rendering him catatonic for months on end. Yet time spent with his loved ones or in the great expanse of European nature, which the novel describes with great vividness, induce feelings of elation in the young scientist. The monster, having lived outdoors for a significant period of his short lifetime, views nature more as an obstacle. However, he offers profound reflections on humanity from an outsider’s perspective, moved by people’s compassion and repulsed by their violence. Overflowing fits of rage, made fearsome by the monster’s physicality, belie his youth and naivete.\n\nAnother component of the Romantic movement was philhellenism. Many in Europe became enthralled with Greek culture and the aesthetic of classical antiquity during the early 19th century, and that admiration was intensified by the outbreak of theWar of Greek Independence in 1821. Both Percy Shelley and Lord Byron were adamant philhellenes; Byron died in Greece after fighting in the war, and he was lauded as a Greek national hero. A philhellenic strand runs throughout Mary Shelley’s novel: its subtitle, The Modern Prometheus, invokes Greek mythology by referring to the Titan who created mortals out of clay and is associated with the divine power of fire. Frankenstein is first enraptured by the writings of St. Albertus Magnus, a German theologian who promoted the theories of the Greek philosopher Aristotle. Furthermore, the monster fits the archetype of the “noble savage,” a Romantic convention with roots in ancient Greek literature that portrays an inherent good nature in uncivilized characters. The monster begins life as innocent as a child but is quickly corrupted by the violence in society.\n\nThe Enlightenment was an era that belonged more to the generation preceding Shelley’s. It valued reason, freedom, and skepticism. Frankenstein and his friend Henry Clerval are both scholars who are committed to the pursuit of knowledge. Shelley could have been critiquing Enlightenment ideology, since it is Frankenstein’s unrestrained appetite for progress—a hallmark of Enlightenment beliefs—that ultimately results in his own destruction. Frankenstein’s monster is considered by some to be an allegory for the French Revolution of 1789, in which Enlightenment philosophy was a crucial influence on the revolution’s early leaders. French philosophes such as Montesquieu, Voltaire, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau spread the ideals of liberty and equality, envisioning a rational societal structure instead of what they condemned as the arbitrary rule of the monarchy and nobility. Although the revolution began with a desire to improve upon society by using reason, it quickly devolved into rampant bloodlust that consumed even some of its principal originators.\n\nFrankenstein has also been interpreted as a metaphor for postpartum depression, especially in light of Shelley’s own struggles with motherhood. Although postpartum depression was not yet defined as such when Shelley was writing, its symptoms were explained by other means, and she would have been aware of contemporary theories that a pregnant woman’s lifestyle and even her state of mind could affect her baby. According to these theories, Frankenstein’s neglect of his own health during his “labours” in creating the monster would have influenced his creation. He also exhibits symptoms of postpartum depression immediately after the monster comes to life: he completely abandons his creation, sinking into a depression that includes suicidal thoughts or actions. The monster, in his own right, grows up without a parental figure and harbours a strong resentment toward his creator for having abandoned him, which in turn prompts the monster to question his own self-worth.\n\nThe manner in which Victor Frankenstein differs from the novel’s women sheds further light on Shelley’s complex representation of motherhood and female identity. He lacks Elizabeth’s delicacy and compassion as well as the selflessness of his mother, Caroline. He acknowledges that he is sometimes “selfish,” shortsighted, and infatuated with what he believes to be his greatness. Faced with these qualities in Victor, the monster says that he needs a nurturing presence, a companion, and for this reason he wants a female counterpart—a complicated mix, arguably, of wife and mother. In Shelley’s own life can be found meaningful echoes of the mothers and wives in her novel: Caroline, for example, dies of an illness contracted from her adopted daughter, Elizabeth, early in the novel, and Elizabeth’s birth mother also died in childbirth—a situation that resembles Shelley’s mother having died of complications stemming from her own birth. In addition, there was no shortage of contention between Shelley and her stepmother (also named Mary, whom Shelley’s father had married in 1801): Shelley described her as “a woman I shudder to think of.”\n\nThe characters in Shelley’s novel frequently debate the human condition, and traditional antithetical motifs are touted: male and female, good and evil, beauty and ugliness, love and hate, companionship and loneliness. Another common theme is religion: both Frankenstein and his monster liken themselves to Satan, and the monster addresses a “prayer” to Frankenstein, whom he calls his “creator”—only a majuscule away from his name for God, “Creator.” References to the biblical story of Adam and Eve and to Paradise Lost by John Milton—which is among the books that the monster reads—appear repeatedly. Some early readers of Frankenstein condemned it as a radical, immoral book: by giving life to a new being, Frankenstein seizes and then corrupts a power previously thought to be reserved for God. That accusation would seem to be well-suited for Percy Shelley, who was an atheist, but it fits awkwardly on Mary Shelley, whose diary reveals her devout Christian beliefs.\n\nFrankenstein has virtually limitless applicability, as one of its central messages is that excess, whether it be Frankenstein’s ambition or the monster’s rage, generates repercussions. The story of Frankenstein’s monster, for example, has been thought to represent the slave narrative, especially in the aftermath of the successful Haitian Revolution. (Both Shelleys were well-read on the emancipation debate and were staunch abolitionists.) The monster has also been identified as a metaphor for countless other people and developments, from Irish nationalists to the United Kingdom Independence Party to artificial intelligence to genetically modified “Frankenfood.” The novel can also be seen as summing up humanity’s relationship with the environment: ambition and progress have resulted in what many see as unsustainable production methods, and we may ultimately suffer from the machinations of our own hands.\n\nReligion battles science, passion begets suffering, reason clashes with madness, all across Shelley’s pages.\n\nAdaptations\n\nIn the centuries since his debut, Frankenstein’s monster has become one of the most recognizable characters in popular culture, spawning an extensive, ever-growing list of adaptations and spin-offs. As of 2017, characters from Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus had appeared in 177 television and film adaptations and in 58 plays listed in a comprehensive U.K. theatre database. These adaptations can diverge wildly from Shelley’s timeless tale: today the name Frankenstein is more often given to the scientist’s creation than to the scientist himself, and the monster is often depicted as a green, nearly inarticulate, bumbling brute with bolts in his neck rather than as a sallow eloquent giant imbued with supernatural speed and strength.\n\nFrankenstein first made the jump to cinema in 1910, in a silent film produced by Thomas Edison. But it was not until the appearance of James Whale’s 1931 classic, starring Boris Karloff as the monster, that Franken-mania spread through Anglo-American pop culture. The film was loved by critics, overperformed at the box office, and has been listed as one of the best movies of all time, although it has perhaps been outlived by just one line from it: “It’s alive! It’s alive!” Several sequels with Karloff followed, and numerous later variations and satires were strongly influenced by the series. Another notable group of film adaptations was launched in 1957 by Britain’s Hammer Films, which introduced a new focus on Victor Frankenstein’s character (played by Peter Cushing) in seven mostly nonserialized movies.\n\nComedic films based on Shelley’s novel include Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948) and Mel Brooks’s Young Frankenstein (1974). Children’s movies such as Igor (2008), Frankenweenie (2012), and the Hotel Transylvania series feature variations on Shelley’s characters. The cinematic retellings Frankenstein (2015) and Depraved (2019) have brought the novel to life in a modern setting. Frankenstein is beloved on screen as well as on the stage. Danny Boyle directed a theatrical adaptation of the novel at the Royal National Theatre, London, in 2011 starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Jonny Lee Miller, who alternated as Frankenstein and the creature from one show to the next. The two actors received an Olivier Award for their performances.\n\nNumerous authors have creatively resurrected Frankenstein in fiction for a wide range of audiences. Kenneth Oppel’s This Dark Endeavor (2011) is a prequel to Shelley’s original, following a teenage Frankenstein and his first dive into alchemy. Theodore Roszak’s The Memoirs of Elizabeth Frankenstein (1995), Kris Waldherr’s Unnatural Creatures: A Novel of the Frankenstein Women (2022), and Kiersten White’s The Dark Descent of Elizabeth Frankenstein (2018) all put a spotlight on the female characters surrounding Frankenstein and his creation.\n\nOther novels, such as Dr. Frankenstein’s Daughters by Suzanne Weyn (2013) and Man Made Boy by Jon Skovron (2013), envision a world where the offspring of Frankenstein or his monster, respectively, must navigate the legacies of their parents. Pieces of Shelley’s own history are infused, alongside those of her characters, into Peter Ackroyd’s The Casebook of Victor Frankenstein (2008). Dean Koontz wrote a five-novel Frankenstein series of supernatural mysteries, which are set in New Orleans. Frankenstein in Baghdad is a modern retelling by Ahmed Saadwadi; first published, in Arabic, in 2013, it repaints Shelley’s story in the context of the Iraq War and the lives destroyed in its wake.\n\nFrankenstein’s influence has not been limited to the media above: the General Mills cereal Franken Berry sports a pink steampunk monster on the box; Frankenstein & Bier Keller is a Frankenstein’s monster−themed bar in Edinburgh featuring an animatronic version of the fiend; the monster, who goes by his creator’s name, can be spotted alongside Batman in the colourful pages of DC Comics; and Eddie Van Halen’s quintessential homemade electric guitar was given the moniker “Frankenstrat.”"
