        "text": "Based on a non-fiction account by one of its subjects,\n\nreal-life journalist Michael Finkel, the movie “True Story” spends much of its\n\n90 minutes trying to figure out just what it is. Murder mystery, journalism\n\nexposé, courtroom drama, metaphysical inquiry into the secret-sharer nature of\n\ncertain American Bros, proof that James Franco and Jonah Hill can serious-act\n\nopposite one another—it seems to be going for any one of these at any given\n\nmoment, and in the end winds up being not a whole lot more than ostentatiously\n\nunpleasant and ugly.\n\nDirected by first-time feature filmmaker albeit apparently\n\nwell-acclaimed British stage director Rupert Goold, “True Story” opens with a\n\nslow-motion overhead shot of a teddy bear drooping into an open suitcase and\n\nlanding next to a child who’s lying in the suitcase in a fetal position. The\n\nchild turns out to be one of the alleged victims of Christian Longo (Franco)\n\nwho is soon arrested for killing his entire family—a wife and three kids. Cut to\n\nHill’s Finkel, in Africa at work on a major story—perhaps his eighth or ninth New York Times Magazine cover gig, he crows to his wife once he’s back in the\n\nStates—and he’s getting some of the detail work wrong, in a way that’s going to\n\nbite him in the ass, big time. Exiled from the Times in disgrace, he retreats\n\nto his VERY cozy modern cabin in wintry Montana and Very Concerned But Fairly\n\nUnderstanding Academic Wife Jill (Felicity Jones), where he soon hears from an\n\nOregon reporter about a multiple murderer who had been using Finkel’s identity\n\nat the time of his capture in Mexico. That would be Longo. Intrigued, Finkel\n\nrequests an interview with the accused. The accused accepts. He’s a long-time\n\nadmirer of Finkel’s work, it turns out. He makes Finkel an offer that any\n\nseasoned journalist would admit stinks to high heaven while at the same time\n\npresenting an undeniably potent temptation: If Finkel will keep the story to\n\nhimself until after the trial, and “teach” Longo how to write, Longo will give\n\nhis story exclusively to the writer whose identity he once pilfered.\n\nIt’s kind of amusing that in a week in which much of the\n\nmedia-engaged real world is howling in outrage that an instance of journalistic\n\nmalfeasance at Rolling Stone hasn’t resulted in a bunch of rolling heads, a\n\nmovie comes out that tries to make viewers feel bad about the entirely\n\njustified firing of a newspaper reporter who really did do the stuff he was\n\naccused by his bosses of doing. Man, King Crimson wasn’t kidding about that 21st-Century-Schizoid-Man\n\ncondition. In any event, as per the movie’s version of events, Finkel’s eager\n\nacceptance of Longo’s offer makes him look like an opportunist, and then the\n\nmovie goes on to make him look like a dumb opportunist. Marveling at the\n\nmacabre memoir Longo sends him on legal pad, Finkel is spooked by\n\ncorrespondences: Longo makes weird drawings in the margins of his pages, just like\n\nFinkel does. Jill raises an eyebrow at this, as one will, but the theme of\n\nHuman Duality And Darkness doesn’t get much play. The screenplay, by Rupert\n\nGoold and David Kajganich, means to plant verbal clues here and there that will\n\npay off big time by the end; suffice it to say that to use the phrase “when the\n\npenny drops” to describe the resultant instances would be to severely overvalue\n\nthem. (Also, the writers seem to have a poor grasp of what a “double negative”\n\nactually is.)\n\nThe film moves at a relatively clipping pace, but also has a\n\nweird sense of contingency, as if the filmmakers are filling in the required\n\ncomponents of this kind of scenario as they go along. For instance, about an\n\nhour into the movie, when all you’ve seen of Longo is in exchanges between him\n\nand Finkel, who’s trying desperately to milk a book deal out of his\n\ninvestigation of Longo, you’re liable to think, “Doesn’t this accused killer\n\nhave a LAWYER? And if so—because he probably should—why hasn’t Finkel had any\n\ncontact with him?” And sure enough, the trial gets underway and yes, Longo DOES\n\nhave a lawyer. Strangely enough, it’s about this time in the film that an\n\nofficial investigator, played by bullet-headed, active-jawed toughie Robert\n\nJohn Burke, leans on doughy, confused-looking Finkel—better tell what you know,\n\nkid, because this Longo’s trying to pull a fast one on the jury. This might\n\nelicit an uh-oh from viewers had the film presented any evidence that Longo\n\nmight not be guilty, except it doesn’t. Finkel thinks he might be innocent,\n\nbecause otherwise all that secret sharer stuff might mean something scary. But\n\nreally, he’s the only one. By the time Longo takes the stand to offer a story\n\nso preposterous on its face (not to mention probably actuarially\n\nunprecedented—I thought of Edward G. Robinson’s hole-punching insurance\n\ninvestigator in “Double Indemnity” and the fun he’d have with this tale, and\n\nalso how much I would have preferred to be watching “Double Indemnity”) that\n\nyou’re surprised the jurors don’t break up laughing at it—well, you have to\n\nwonder, if this Finkel had almost eight New York Times Magazine cover stories\n\nto his name, how hard can big-time journalism really be?"
