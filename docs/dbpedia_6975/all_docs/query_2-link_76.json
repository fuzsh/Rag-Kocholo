        "text": "“Brace yourself!” reads one of those memes going around Catholic Twitter that shows the actor Sean Bean as Tolkien’s Boromir looking into the wind. It continues, “Bad Mary Magdalene takes are coming.” Though I prepared for some very bad takes in Diane Apostolos-Cappadona’s new book Mary Magdalene: A Visual History, the ones that appeared did not overwhelm the rest of the book’s delightful history of this figure in literature, devotion, and art.\n\nThere are good reasons to await bad takes on the one known as “the Apostle to the Apostles.” After all, the last few decades of popular culture have brought the embrace of a good bit of early Christian and Gnostic schlock, along with a reversal of many of the values that went into earlier, most likely mistaken, Christian portraits of Mary of Magdala as a sexual sinner.\n\nThese days we get such treatments as Mark Adamo’s two-act opera The Gospel of Mary Magdalene (2013), in which, as Apostolos-Cappadona describes, the saint “is not a reformed prostitute but an independent, intensely intelligent, and sensual woman.” Given that the show begins with “five modern-day seekers” who “begin a journey to find the truth and voice their negative thoughts about contemporary Christian attitudes toward sex and the subservient place of women in the Church,” I can safely say I’ll be skipping it if it ever comes to town.\n\nIf she wasn’t a modern-day sex-positive feminist—and she wasn’t—what was she? What do we know of her from the Gospels and the Tradition? Apostolos-Cappadona’s book is divided into two parts. Part I is titled “Towards a Visual History” and Part II is “Motifs.” In both parts she uses gorgeous images (65 total) and sensitive artistic and literary readings to show how Mary Magdalene was understood and represented throughout the history of the Church. (An appendix at the end surveys some recent exhibitions focused on the saint and offers a bibliography for those interested in going further than this 150-page work.)\n\nIn Part I, Apostolos-Cappadona lays out the complex history of her identification in Scripture. We do know that Jesus cast seven devils from her (Mark 16:9; Luke 8:2-7), and that she was one of those close to Jesus, a witness to the Crucifixion, the empty tomb, and the Resurrection. In fact, she was the first witness, told to go tell the twelve the good news—hence the later title “Apostle to the Apostles.”\n\nWas she a sexual sinner? From fairly early on, there developed what the historian Marina Warner called a “muddle of Marys,” in which Mary Magdalene was conflated with other New Testament figures. The fact that even in the certain scriptural identifications she had had seven devils led easily to the notion that she must have been mixed up in sexual sin, given the common connection between spiritual, moral, and physical realities. Tertullian thought Mary Magdalene was actually Mary of Bethany (Luke 10:39) and the woman caught in adultery and nearly stoned (John 8:1-11). Ambrose was unclear on the question, Jerome thought this mistaken, and Augustine thought the identification was “open to question.” Pope Gregory I sealed the popular understanding, however, with his conflation of the Magdalene with both Mary of Bethany and the “sinful woman” of Luke 7:36-50 who anoints Jesus’ feet by Pope Gregory I in 591 A. D.\n\nGregory’s portrayal achieved a kind of canonical status in the West. The Gospel for the old rite Latin Mass on Mary Magdalen’s day is Luke 7:36-50, and she was identified on the General Calendar as “penitent.” But the questions did not abate. They continued in the Middle Ages with Bernard of Clairvaux, Albertus Magnus, and Thomas Aquinas all issuing opinions. And they became a point of debate in the sixteenth century, as John Fisher of Rochester publicly debated the topic (among other things) with the Protestant Jacques Lefévre d’Etaples.\n\nThe outcome in the Catholic Church was that Jerome won out over Tertullian and Gregory. In 1969, Paul VI changed the description of Mary Magdalene in the Roman Calendar from “penitent” and identifying her as “the disciple of the Lord.” This identification has been followed by both Popes John Paul II and Francis, the latter of whom introduced a new preface to her feast day and promoted her day from obligatory memorial to a feast equivalent to those of the Apostles.\n\nOf course, this history is interpreted at the end of the book by Apostolos-Cappadona, Professor Emerita of Religious Art and Cultural History at Georgetown, as itself sexist. In a chapter titled “Feminist Icon,” she tells us that the problem is that the early Church was corrupted by the Roman Empire’s “androcentric vocabulary” and “patriarchal exclusivity” such that “women like Mary Magdalene were no longer agents of religious discourse but simply saintly exempla as they suited the purposes of the ecclesiastical hierarchy.”\n\nWell, okay. This is a bit reductive (and also without footnotes). Tertullian, we might note, was confused long before Christianity was even legal, much less the official religion of the Empire. Thankfully, this chapter, the last one in the book, does not overshadow the rest of the history Apostolos-Cappadona tells, in which all the mistaken identity stuff is not simply attributed to bad hierarchs. In fact, the rest of Part I is of great interest not only for how this saint, supposedly wronged by the patriarchy, seems to have been loved by men and women of all types who not only confuse her with other New Testament figures but also the fifth-century Mary of Egypt—another sexual sinner who repented. They develop stories and legends about her that have to do with penitence but also many other subjects, including travels to India with Thomas, last days spent in Ephesus with John the Beloved and the Blessed Virgin, and traveling on to the south of France with two other Marys. Apostolos-Cappadona herself notes that Mary Magdalene went “from supporting actress to star of medieval dramas.”\n\nIn fact, though the identification (or misidentification) of the Magdalene with sexual sinners continued (no doubt until this day), what fascinated many of the great artists is precisely her role as the disciple at the foot of the Cross and the first witness. “Botticelli has created a devotional picture of the highest order,” Apostolos-Cappadona writes of the master’s “Mystic Crucifixion” (ca. 1500). And when the penitent part is present, it does not overwhelm but enhances the focus. In Bernat Martorelli’s altar painting of Mary in the Garden (Noli me tangere), the saint “has become the feminine symbol of penitence, humility, and love as communicated through her kneeling posture ad the Risen Christ’s feet and her eloquent gestures of prayer in relation to his right hand—both positioned directly above her golden unguent jar.” Even if her anointing jar was never used in sorrow for sexual sins, the understanding that it was does not undercut her role as disciple; instead, it enhances it.\n\nDespite Apostolos-Cappadona’s blessedly infrequent feminist lectures, the story she tells of this saint’s place in Christian thought and life is an inspiring one. Thus, the second part of her book, “Motifs,” brings out the varied ways in which Mary Magdalene was understood: not only as seductress, penitent, or feminist icon, but also as weeper of holy tears, witness, preacher, contemplative, reader, and patron. With the exception of the feminist icon, almost all of these images are found long before the twentieth century. One early-sixteenth-century French panel of an altarpiece, painted by an artist now known only as the “Master of the Magdalene Legend,” depicts our saint on an elevated dais preaching in an outdoor setting to a group of men and women. This painting clearly is based on the legend of the saint traveling to France and bringing the Good News there.\n\nWhile it might be argued that much of the Christian tradition was based on a bad historical take, what Apostolos-Cappadona’s book brings out is how to the pure, all things are pure—even misattributed sexual sins. It is fine to correct the legends with historical truth, but it is even better to see how the splendor of moral and spiritual truths can put a shine even on imperfect knowledge and inspire art and stories that captivate audiences centuries later.\n\nKnowledge can puff up, but love of the saints and the One they love will always build up souls, as well as a cultural legacy worth reading about in this informative and fascinating book."
