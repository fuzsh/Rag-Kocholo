        "text": "A comprehensive overview of all three Seminole Wars and the political, social, and economic forces that drove them. Intended for a general audience, the book covers not only the wars, but the genesis of the Seminole Nation, the periods leading up to the wars, and the factors that brought on these tragic conflicts. The tale of a long, bitter confrontation between cultures, the Seminole Wars teach us lessons that are surprisingly relevant in today's world.\n\nFrom the University Press of Florida, 2004.\n\n265 pages, with illustrations and maps\n\nISBN # 978-0-8130-6243-3\n\nThe Seminole Wars told through the perspective of a Seminole woman. Narrated primarily in the first person, the book follows Aheedja's life as she tells her story to a young Seminole girl. From her first encounters with white Americans as an adolescent in 1812, she recounts the grueling hardships and painful losses she suffered as the army relentlessly pushed her people south, from comfortable homes in North Florida to primitive camps in the Everglades. Covering a period that spans almost fifty years, this is a tale not only of burnt homes and loved ones sent away or slain, but of the determination and resilience of the Seminole people.\n\nCo-Authored with Willie Johns, Tribal Historian and Chief Justice of the Seminole Tribal Court System, the book not only focuses on the Seminole experiences during the wars, but also on the customs and traditions of Florida's native people. Also included is a 15-page timeline of the Seminole Wars.\n\nFrom the Florida Historical Society Press, 2020.\n\nSoftcover, 292 pages, $24.95.\n\nISBN # 978-1-949810-06-6"
