        "text": "Harlan Coben is one of the most prolific writers of our time. He signed a deal with Netflix back in 2018 (subsequently renewed in 2022) that has seen many of his best-selling novels become Netflix Original productions. As of April 2024, there are eight Harlan Coben shows on Netflix, with lots more on the way. Here’s your guide to Harlan Coben on Netflix.\n\nWhile we don’t have all the details of Harlan Coben’s deal with Netflix, we know it originally ran through 2023 but was renewed in 2022, meaning there’s plenty more Coben to come.\n\nCoben had stated on the record that he hoped to continue working with Netflix and that he currently has plans for another two shows, which would bring him up to the “nine of the planned 14 when the deal was struck”. After these remarks, two other British shows were announced.\n\nThe Myron Bolitar series, which ran from 1995 through 2016 across 11 releases, was notably excluded from the Netflix deal initially struck but will be included from 2022 onwards.\n\nCoben is very much involved with all the Netflix titles through his production company, Final Twist Productions and at the very least is listed as an executive producer on each project.\n\nWe should also note that The Five, adapted from Harlan Coben’s novel, departed Netflix US in 2021 as it was only licensed to Netflix for a fixed period of time but has since returned or remains in many regions.\n\nWhile we’ll list the Harlan Coben collection on Netflix below, you can also find them grouped within Netflix via a genre category. Use that link or type in 81180221 in your Netflix search bar.\n\nEvery Harlan Coben Series Available on Netflix\n\nNote: Listed in order of Netflix release (oldest to newest)\n\nSafe\n\nBook Release: N/A\n\nReleased on Netflix: May 10th, 2018\n\nLanguage: English\n\nEpisodes: 8\n\nIMDb Rating: 7.3/10\n\nAlthough Netflix was the international distributor for Safe, it’s believed that this falls outside the overall deal with StudioCanal distributing in France on channel C8 but remains on Netflix as an Original, so we thought we should include it nonetheless.\n\nThe limited series featured Michael C. Hall, known for his role on Showtime’s Dexter. The actor starred as a widow searching for his daughter and becomes increasingly uncomfortable after discovering truths about those around him.\n\nThe Stranger\n\nBook Released: 2015\n\nReleased on Netflix: January 30th, 2020\n\nLanguage: English\n\nEpisodes: 8\n\nIMDb Rating: 7.3/10\n\nThroughout this limited series, you’ll uncover a set of secrets and lies by multiple families after the appearance of a stranger in town.\n\nRichard Armitage (who will go on to appear in several other Netflix Coben projects) headlines, with Siobhan Finneran and Shaun Dooley also starring. Danny Brocklehurst, Mick Ford, Karla Crome, and Charlotte Coben wrote the project.\n\nThe Woods\n\nBook Released: 2007\n\nNetflix Release Date: June 12th, 2020\n\nLanguage: Polish\n\nEpisodes: 6\n\nIMDb Rating: 6.5/10\n\nThe original pact stated that Netflix would be adapting the array of Coben books into multiple languages, which kicked off mid-way into 2020 with The Woods. The limited series made headlines for being Poland’s second major Netflix Original production.\n\nStarring local talent, including Grzegorz Damiecki, Agnieszka Grochowska, and Hubert Milkowski, the series followed a prosecutor’s hope of finding answers for his sister’s disappearance 25 years prior.\n\nThe Innocent\n\nBook Released: 2005\n\nNetflix Release Date: April 30th, 2021\n\nLanguage: Spanish\n\nEpisodes: 8\n\nIMDb Rating: 7.8/10\n\nArriving on Netflix at the end of April 2021, it is the first Spanish-language production out of the Harlan Coben library. Oriol Paulo adapted the limited series, which starred Mario Casas, Alexandra Jiménez, Aura Garrido, and José Coronado.\n\nThe eight-episode series follows an accidental killing that leads a man down a dark hole of intrigue and murder.\n\nGone For Good\n\nBook Released: 2002\n\nNetflix Release Date: August 13th, 2021\n\nLanguage: French\n\nEpisodes: 5\n\nIMDb Rating: 6.3/10\n\nGone for Good is the first French-language adaptation of by Harlan Coben. The 5-part limited series began production in September 2020 and was released just under a year later. It’s helmed by Juan Carlos Medina, who notably directed The Limehouse Golem.\n\nGarance Marillier, Nicolas Duvauchelle, Guillaume Gouix, Finnegan Oldfield and Nailia Harzoune starred.\n\nHere’s what you can expect from the series:\n\n“Ten years after losing two loved ones, a man is plunged into another dizzying mystery when his girlfriend vanishes. Based on a Harlan Coben novel.”\n\nStay Close\n\nBook released: 2012\n\nNetflix Release Date: December 31st, 2021\n\nLanguage: English\n\nEpisodes: 8\n\nIMDb Rating: 6.9/10\n\nHeading back to the UK following three European productions was Stay Close. Daniel O’Hara directed the 8-episode limited series. The original book is set in a more American setting, so it was interesting to see how it adjusted to its new British setting.\n\nThe mystery thriller follows the subsequent actions after two men go missing within 17 years of each other.\n\nRegarding the talent picked for the new limited series, Coben said: “Talk about a dream-come-true cast – Cush Jumbo, an incendiary and awesome talent; Jimmy Nesbitt, a legendary actor I always wanted to collaborate with; and wow, Richard Armitage back again! And we have the incredible Sarah Parish, too.”\n\nHold Tight\n\nBook released: 2008\n\nNetflix Release Date: April 22nd, 2022\n\nLanguage: Polish\n\nEpisodes: 6\n\nIMDb Rating: 6.2/10\n\nThe second Polish-language adaptation of a Harlan Coben book came in early 2022 with the adaptation of Hold Tight.\n\nHere’s the official logline for the series:\n\n“When a young man goes missing soon after his friend dies, life in a tight-knit, affluent Warsaw suburb slowly unravels, exposing secrets and lies.”\n\nFool Me Once\n\nBook Released: 2016\n\nNetflix Release Date: January 1st, 2024\n\nCountry of Origin: United Kingdom\n\nEpisodes: 8\n\nIMDb Rating: 6.8/10\n\nAnnounced in February 2023, this limited series was the next Coben adaptation set in the United Kingdom, adapted from the 2016 novel of the same name.\n\nThe eight-part series will follow Maya Stern, who is trying to come to terms with the brutal murder of her husband but soon finds out that he may not quite be as dead as she’s led to believe.\n\nMichelle Keegan, Adeel Akhtar, Richard Armitage, and Joanna Lumley lead the cast for the series, with the show going on to have a huge premiere on the streaming service with over 32 million views in the first week alone.\n\nFollowing the series release, the show became a monster hit for the streamer and is currently among the most-watched English-language series of all time.\n\nUpcoming Harlan Coben Shows Announced for Netflix\n\nNote: Listed in order of likely release date either by production dates or priority at Netflix. Everything is subject to change.\n\nCaught\n\nBook Released: 2010\n\nNetflix Release Date: 2025\n\nEpisodes: 6\n\nLanguage: Spanish\n\nServing as the first adaptation of Harlen Coben’s works from South America, Caught has been filming in Argentina and is scheduled to hit Netflix in 2025 with Miguel Cohan and Ana Cohan adapting.\n\nHere’s the official synopsis of the new series:\n\n“Reporter Ema Garay gains visibility amongst digital journalism by catching criminals who tend to evade justice in Bariloche city, in Patagonia Argentina. Her life takes an unexpected turn when she meets Leo Mercer, a social worker and referent, who ends up being the main suspect of her investigation on the disappearance of a 16 year old girl.

It adapts the novel about a police detective who loses her fiance after he disappears. After swiping on dating apps, however, she finds him alive and well.\n\nVictoria Asare-Archer is writing the new project with Sean Spencer directing. The cast for the series includes Rosalind Eleazar, Steve Pemberton, Paul Kaye, Oscar Kennedy, Samantha Spiro, and Lisa Faulkner.\n\nRun Away\n\nBook released: 2019\n\nNetflix Release Date: TBD\n\nLanguage: English\n\nThis one was announced at the beginning of the Netflix pact and reconfirmed by Netflix in early 2024, with Danny Brocklehurst behind the script. Production is slated to begin in Autumn 2024 in the United Kingdom, with Quay Street Productions behind the show.\n\nPer Netflix, here’s what you can expect from the series:\n\n“Simon had the perfect life: loving wife and kids, great job, beautiful home. But then his eldest daughter Paige ran away and everything fell apart. So now when he finds her, vulnerable and strung out on drugs in a city park, he finally has the chance to bring his little girl home. But it turns out she’s not alone and an argument escalates into shocking violence that will shatter Simon’s life all over again.
