        "text": "Disclaimer* stars Cate Blanchett, Kevin Kline and Sacha Baron Cohen.\n\nLike many movie directors, Alfonso Cuarón (Gravity) has been lured to the long-form storytelling offered by streaming services.\n\nHis debut show for Apple TV+ is Disclaimer*, adapted from Renée Knight’s acclaimed novel of the same name.\n\nIt’s worth noting that the teaser for the show, or rather the “7-part event” as Apple bill it, is very much that – a teaser…\n\nIf you’ve not read the novel (and we haven’t), the show’s synopsis thankfully reveals a little more…\n\nAcclaimed journalist Catherine Ravenscroft (Blanchett) built her reputation revealing the misdeeds and transgressions of others. When she receives a novel from an unknown author, she is horrified to realize she is now the main character in a story that exposes her darkest secrets.\n\nAs Catherine races to uncover the writer’s true identity, she is forced to confront her past before it destroys both her own life and her relationships with her husband Robert (Sacha Baron Cohen) and their son Nicholas (Kodi Smit-McPhee).\n\nThe ensemble cast also includes Lesley Manville, Louis Partridge, Leila George and Hoyeon, and features Indira Varma as the narrator.\n\nDisclaimer* premieres at Apple TV+ on October 11th, 2024 with two episodes. The remaining five episodes follow weekly."
