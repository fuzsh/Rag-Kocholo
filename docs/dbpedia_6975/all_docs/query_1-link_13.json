        "text": "and one night stands in NYC. Not the most original, or flattering, either. Which is perhaps where the film and theme deserves credit.\n\nFarrow is understated, Dustin Hoffmman his usual self (think Kramer vs Kramer) However for the subject matter, the film does succeed on several levels.\n\nFarrow remembers her pointless affair with a politician (Michael Tolan) who often played these roles. Hoffman was in a previous relationship with Sunny Griffin (a has-been model) who takes him for granted.\n\nOveralll a time piece which shows some shallowness, awkwardness, and the hopes of those, still attempting relationships. The human factor is what redeems the story. 8/10.\n\nA single man and woman (Dustin Hoffman as John, Mia Farrow as Mary), having met in a bar the night before, wake up in bed \"the morning after\"; they go back and forth on where they should take their 'relationship'. The two charismatic leads try to enlighten a curiously flat screenplay from John Mortimer, adapting the novel by Mervyn Jones, and an uncharacteristically low-keyed direction from Peter Yates. It isn't easy: the sluggish narrative (often flashing back in time) and sterile atmosphere make it practically impossible. Still, Yates' work is fluid, with flights-of-fancy to help fill in the gaps, and the stars look just beautiful in their prime. Farrow's Mary is all over the place: guarded and vague (and a little rude), she then turns sheepish and huggable; Hoffman's John is suspicious and cynical, but yielding. Some of their thoughts and emotions ring true--and if finale is pure fantasy, at least it is well done and satisfying, breaking us out of the rut of fashionable cynicism that most of \"John and Mary\" occupies. **1/2 from ****"
