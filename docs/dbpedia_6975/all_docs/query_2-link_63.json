        "text": "Mary Bunyan\n\nA Tale of Religious Persecution and Heroic Faith\n\nOne of our finest historical fictions: the stirring story of Mary Bunyan. An outstanding gift book for that eager reader in the family, with a beautiful new cover.\n\nIt’s the deeply moving story of the home life of Mary, blind daughter of the John Bunyan family, and her devotion to her father. Mary sought to visit her father and meet any needs of his that she could, even while he was in prison; and worked to bring about his freedom. A convicting and challenging story of faith standing firm despite massive opposition from men.\n\nAs John, the pastor, languished in prison as a result of his preaching as a Baptist pastor in England during the 17th century. The account is historical fiction, told largely from the vantage point of his blind daughter, Mary, his first-born child and constant joy.\n\nMary became Bunyan’s loyal, constant companion on every occasion when the authorities would permit her to visit her father at the prison, and his persistent petitioner for mercy and release before King Charles. This stirring account of how a young girl’s faith in God grew, rather than diminished, during times of persecution, is an inspiring and beautiful example for all believers today.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nSallie Rochester Ford (1828-1910) was a prolific writer in the latter part of the 1800s. In addition to the story of Mary Bunyan, she also wrote Grace Truman: Or, Love and Principle; The Inebriates: A Story of Love, Suffering, and Triumph; and Ernest Quest: Or, the Search for Truth."
