Conclusion\n\nQuick Stock Overview\n\nTicker: 9024.T\n\nKey Data\n\nIndustry: Hotel / Railroad / Real Estate\n\nMarket Capitalization ($M): 3,530\n\nPrice to sales: 1.12\n\nPrice to Free Cash Flow: -\n\nDividend yield: 2.81%\n\nSales ($M): 3,130\n\nFree cash flow/share: -\n\nP/E: 4.87\n\n1. Executive Summary\n\nSeibu Holdings is a Japanese hotel, railway, leisure activities, and real estate conglomerate. It operates 167km of railway and 83 hotels, most of which are in Japan. It also owns a total of 474 km2 of land, most of which is underutilized and undervalued.\n\nThe group suffered during the COVID pandemic, reaching an all-time low in January 2021. It also had to sell some of its hotels in early 2022 to stave off a liquidity crisis. Consequently, the group is trading at a low valuation, assuming little to no growth.\n\nThis valuation ignores the fact that Japan is now reopening and coming back to normal. Even the inbound tourist numbers of January 2023, up x83 year-to-year, are still much below the 2019 levels. So Seibu's results should be coming back to a more normal level, in line with its historical performances.\n\nIn addition, the Japanese tourism sector is boosted by the short-term trend of the weak yen and the long-term trend of Japanese culture's increasing popularity with younger (and even not-so-young anymore) generations.\n\nSeibu's balance sheet is adequate, even if the group might need to roll over some short-term debt to stay liquid enough in 2023.\n\nIn the long run, Seibu's large land holdings are probably where most of the group's total value is locked. Even very conservative estimates indicate these lands could be worth as much as the entire current market cap and maybe several times more.\n\nSeibu will be most fitting for investors with a very long-term focus, willing to trade off liquidity for higher long-term returns."
