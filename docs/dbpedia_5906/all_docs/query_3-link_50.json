        "text": "New signage system introduced as a part of renovations timed for the 100th anniversary of the station's completion.\n\nThe Seibu Railway, which connects northwestern Tokyo with southwestern Saitama Prefecture, has been commemorating a century since the company's establishment with various projects and events collectively referred to as “Seibu Railway 100th Anniversary,” over four years from 2012 to 2015. One of the projects was a thorough renovation of Ikebukuro Station, one of the railway's hub stations, to mark 100 years since the station opened.\n\nPart of this renovation is the introduction of a new Panasonic digital signage system, based around our professional-quality 4K LCD displays.\n\nOur 4K displays, acclaimed for their high durability, have been installed at a train station, marking a first* in the Tokyo region.\n\nThus far the columns in Ikebukuro Station have featured advertisements on electrically lighted signboards, but as the advertising industry moves toward digital signage, the installation of this signage system was included in the station's renovation plan. After examining video system options with the goal of securing \"the largest, most state-of-the-art displays possible,\" Seibu Railway compared various companies' products, primarily large 4K displays, before selecting Panasonic's.\n\nWhen installing displays in a location like Ikebukuro Station with heavy pedestrian traffic, it is necessary to attach protective panels over the displays, meaning that what station users see are pictures with their resolution degraded by passing through the panels. However, Panasonic professional displays already have protective glass over their surfaces, meaning protective panels are unnecessary and station users can see super-high-definition 4K images without any degradation.\n\nWith the client appreciating Panasonic products' combination of durability and high definition, it was decided that TH-84LQ70 84-inch 4K LCD displays and TH-70LF50 70-inch full high-definition LCD displays would be installed, a first at a train station in the Tokyo region*.\n\nSeibu Railway has marked its 100th anniversary and is on track, full speed ahead for the next 100.\n\nSeibu Railway operates a 176.6km network of 12 rail lines linking northwestern Tokyo with southwestern Saitama Prefecture, and connecting the heart of Tokyo with the abundant nature of sites like Chichibu and Hanno. Ikebukuro Station, from which trains depart bound for Chichibu and Hanno, has served as a gateway between countryside and city since it opened a century ago in April 1915."
