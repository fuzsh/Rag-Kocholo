Under this circumstances, the efforts for smooth communications among researchers if different disciplines, which will contribute not only to vltalization of researchers' activi- les but also creation of new \"interdisciplinary\" studies, are extremely Important. Its mportance will continuously increase in the future. When each researcher needs Information of and cooperation with the other researchers of different disciplines for undertaking his own research, it is very useful for him to have such information which is systematically prepared as to be able to respond to the question \"Who is conducting what kind of research and in which research institute?\" and \"How one can contact with the researcher?\". These information will help researchers in the world to facilitate the communication among the researchers of different disci- plines. For responding to this demand. Research Development Corporation of Japan (JRDC) planed to publish a directory of researchers in the national research institutes In Japan. The directory containes those information such as research field, research theme, papers, academic society associated and contact points and so on. I wish that this directory will be used by researchers as many as possible and will con- tribute to the development of science and technology of the world as a result. At the end, I express my gratitude to many researchers and administrative staff of the national research institutes for their cooperation in completing this directory.

SJU01UO3 User's Guide The information contained in the directory is compiled based on a questionnaire sur- vey responded by individual researchers of each national research institutes. The infor- mation shows the situation of each researcher on November 1, 1992. The survey was made by the Department of International Research Exchanges, JRDC, under the coopera- tion of the national research institutes. 1. The directory covers 81 national research institutes in the fields of natural science and technology. The researchers are found in the institutes where they belong. The total number of researchers described in this directory is about 4,700 persons. 2. Data contained in this directory are: an official position and a title; educational career (higher education); name of laboratory where they work now; research field and theme; research papers and publication; academic societies associated with; academic prizes, and address. 3. \"Research field and theme\" has codes which are described In the attached classifica- tion list of science and technology field. When a researcher is engaged in more than two fields, a slash ( / ) is put between each of them. 4. The number in parentheses at the item \"Awards\" means the year they are given. 5.
