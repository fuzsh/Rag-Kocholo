        "text": "Sumitomo Corporation (President: Kuniharu Nakamura; head office: Chuo-ku, Tokyo) will be joining with Seibu Railway Co., Ltd. (President: Hisashi Wakabayashi; head office: Tokorozawa, Saitama Prefecture) and Seibu Properties Inc. (President: Hiroo Ando; head office: Tokorozawa, Saitama Prefecture), both affiliates of Seibu Holdings Inc. (President: Takashi Goto; head office: Tokorozawa, Saitama Prefecture) (all three hereinafter collectively referred to as “the Seibu Group”) to pursue the Tokorozawa Station East Side Building Plan (hereinafter, “the Plan”) in the area around Seibu Railway’s Tokorozawa Station in Tokorozawa, Saitama Prefecture.\n\nTokorozawa Station is a key Seibu Railway station on both the Seibu Shinjuku Line and the Seibu Ikebukuro Line that is used by about 96,000 people each day. The Tokorozawa area with its convenient access is an area expected to see further improvements in the residential environment and one well suited to commercial development.\n\nThe Plan comprises Phase I centered on the development of commercial storefronts, and Phase II centered on the installation of new ticket gates and the development of commercial storefronts within the station and above railway lines. The aim is to create commercial facilities that offer users of Tokorozawa Station as well as residents of the Tokorozawa area and along Seibu Railway lines greater convenience and higher quality of living.\n\nThere is also a plan for large-scale development on the west side of Tokorozawa Station centered on commercial facilities that will draw in customers from an extensive area (hereinafter, “the West Side Development Plan”), and Sumitomo Corporation intends to team up with the Seibu Group to implement these development plans as soon as possible to help substantially boost the appeal of the area around Tokorozawa Station.\n\nSumitomo Corporation has collaborated with its wholly-owned subsidiary Sumisho Urban Kaihatsu Co., Ltd. (President: Masaaki Okubo; head office: Chuo-ku, Tokyo) to help develop and revitalize communities by cultivating know-how on developing/operating commercial facilities across a broad range of sectors, such as Terrace Mall Shonan, one of the largest shopping centers in the Shonan district, and engaging in “community-made” development/operation tailored to the values and attributes fostered by the communities. In this latest development effort, too, Sumitomo Corporation will be utilizing its development know-how to support the Seibu Group’s commercial development efforts with an eye on future operation from the planning stage.\n\nBlending Sumitomo Corporation’s experience, know-how and networks with the Seibu Group’s know-how in developing/operating commercial facilities inside and underneath stations based on familiarity with the markets along Seibu Railway lines will produce a new hub for everyday interaction in front of Tokorozawa Station. The strong partnership between the two companies will strive to make Tokorozawa Station a landmark within the Seibu Railway network, and to enhance the appeal and prosperity of the Tokorozawa area and other areas along the Seibu Railway lines."
