        "text": "00:24\n\nWelcome to Japan Railway Journal.\n\n00:26\n\nIn this episode, we're featuring a roundup of exciting railway-related topics from the latter half of 2023.\n\n00:35\n\nYes, in 2023, as the pandemic emergency has been declared over and many people's lives are coming back to normal,\n\n00:43\n\nwe have seen the comeback of many railway related events which attracted many people either on board or along the railway line.\n\n00:52\n\nAnd those events have been happening all across Japan, so let's have a look.\n\n01:01\n\nOn July 15, Echizen Railway in Fukui Prefecture began operating a dinosaur train, called the \"Dino Liner.\"\n\n01:11\n\nThe \"Dino Liner\" began operation following the reopening of the Dinosaur Museum near Katsuyama Station.\n\n01:26\n\nThe two-car train was designed to reflect the period in which the dinosaurs at the Museum lived.\n\n01:39\n\nInside, the train features dinosaur figures and replica fossils.\n\n01:44\n\nThe passengers onboard are immersed in the world of dinosaurs.\n\n01:52\n\nIt's fun!\n\n01:54\n\nThey are very impressive up close.\n\n02:00\n\nThe passengers can't wait to arrive at the museum.\n\n02:11\n\nIn August, Nagaragawa Railway in Gifu Prefecture began operating a train decorated with model food,\n\n02:18\n\nwhich is made along the line in Gujo City.\n\n02:26\n\nIn Japan, model food is often displayed in restaurant windows.\n\n02:30\n\nGujo City is one of the largest producers of model food in Japan.\n\n02:41\n\nIn cooperation with a local manufacturer, Nagaragawa Railway decorated the train with 35 realistic looking food models.\n\n02:57\n\nBy the window, the miso soup and soft-serve ice cream really look like they have been spilled.\n\n03:07\n\nAs do the natto, fermented soybeans, and okra attached to the hand straps.\n\n03:15\n\nEven the ramen noodles look like they've been overturned.\n\n03:20\n\nI was surprised. They really look spilled.\n\n03:23\n\nIt's crazy! I didn't think they would look so real!\n\n03:30\n\nWe get calls from people almost everyday\n\nasking where they can ride the train.\n\n03:38\n\nIt's been well received.\n\n03:43\n\nThis train is scheduled to run until August 2024.\n\n03:52\n\nOn September 7, JR West trialed a special tour for foreigners,\n\n03:57\n\nwhich took them on a tourist train to experience the charms of Hiroshima Prefecture.\n\n04:09\n\nThe tour used the tourist train \"etSETOra,\" which usually runs from Hiroshima to Onomichi Station.\n\n04:18\n\nOn this day, the two-hour long train journey ran from Hiroshima Station to Takehara Station.\n\n04:28\n\nThe tour participants, all foreign residents living in Japan, arrive at Hiroshima Station wearing traditional Japanese \"yukata.\"\n\n04:37\n\nThe experience of dressing in \"yukata\" was included in the tour package.\n\n04:47\n\n\"etSETOra\" approaches the platform.\n\n04:50\n\nThe design of the car body was inspired by the calm Seto Inland Sea.\n\n05:01\n\nAfter the train departs, the participants experience calligraphy with Kumano brushes, a traditional craft in Hiroshima Prefecture,\n\n05:14\n\nand taste locally produced \"sake.\"\n\n05:21\n\nAs the train travels along the coast, the participants take pictures with their smart phones and enjoy the ride.\n\n05:33\n\nSome of the them even take a moment to share their experience of the tour on social media.\n\n05:44\n\nArriving at Takehara Station, it's time for lunch at the hotel restaurant.\n\n05:51\n\nThe participants enjoy a lunch course made using produce from along the line.\n\n06:03\n\nAfter lunch, they take a stroll through the preserved historical townscape of Takehara City, which is home to many old streets.\n\n06:16\n\nIt was a lot of fun, and I got to see places that I hadn't seen before even though I lived in Hiroshima a long time.\n\n06:24\n\nI liked wearing \"yukata\" and the restaurant was superb.\n\n06:30\n\nMaybe the \"sake,\" \"Nihonshu.\"\n\n06:33\n\nThe \"sake\" drinking was the best.\n\n06:35\n\nEverything was good.\n\n06:36\n\nI liked the train a lot.\n\n06:40\n\nI may come here with my husband or friends.\n\n06:48\n\nFollowing the trial, tours for foreigners on \"etSETOra\" were held three times a month until the end of December.\n\n07:03\n\nIn September, an event was held to ride a train known as the \"pumpkin train,\" which was discontinued 25 years ago.\n\n07:16\n\nThe beloved train was called the \"pumpkin train\" because of its green and orange color.\n\n07:22\n\nThe \"pumpkin train\" used to run on the 36-km Niigata Kotsu line, which connected Niigata and Tsubame Cities in Niigata Prefecture.\n\n07:42\n\nAfter the line closed in 1999, a local preservation group acquired three train cars, which they continue to maintain and repair.\n\n07:57\n\nOn this day, the \"pumpkin train\" slowly makes its way along a 50 meter section of rail,\n\n08:03\n\ntowed by a vehicle mover, carrying passengers who booked the experience in advance.\n\n08:13\n\nIt was fun.\n\n08:15\n\nIt was interesting. It has a different kind of\n\nfeeling to trains nowadays.\n\n08:27\n\nBeginning November 8, Mass-Trans Innovation Japan was held for three days at the International Exhibition Hall in Chiba Prefecture.\n\n08:39\n\nThis time, 569 companies and organizations from Japan and abroad, the largest number ever, participated in the event,\n\n08:48\n\ndisplaying the latest construction vehicles, rolling stock equipment, and other products.\n\n08:57\n\nAs part of a new initiative, a special area was set up to support regional railways that are suffering from declining passenger numbers.\n\n09:07\n\nThirty regional railway companies from across Japan participated, selling original goods and promoting tourism.\n\n09:26\n\nOn December 9 and 10, one of the largest railway festivals in Japan was held in Osaka for the first time in five years.\n\n09:35\n\nHere, railway companies and other organizations from across Japan gathered to hold railway-related exhibitions.\n\n09:45\n\nAround 110 companies and organizations, including railway companies and local governments, participated in the event.\n\n09:58\n\nHere, participants can interact with a real, working pantograph.\n\n10:02\n\nRaised by air pressure, the children try as hard as they can to pump it up.\n\n10:15\n\nIn this area, child-sized uniforms from various companies were available to try on.\n\n10:25\n\nAnd this area had a variety of railway goods for sale, attracting many families and railway fans.\n\n10:37\n\nNext is a new initiative from the railway industry.\n\n10:43\n\n\"Hello how can I go to Kawagoeï¼\"\n\n10:49\n\nIn July, a new real-time translation system was trialed at the counter of Seibu Railway's Seibu Shinjuku Station in Tokyo.\n\n11:04\n\nIt was developed to provide smooth interactions at the service counter as the number of visitors to Japan rapidly recovers.\n\n11:18\n\nThe system is available in 12 languages, including English and Chinese.\n\n11:30\n\nThe 40cm-high transparent screen between the customer and the station staff\n\n11:34\n\ntranslates and displays foreign languages spoken in Japanese and vice versa.\n\n11:46\n\nSince the pandemic, we've recovered around\n\n70-80% of your inbound passenger numbers.\n\n11:52\n\nThat's very rapid recovery.\n\n11:55\n\nBeing able to see people's faces is a big plus.\n\n12:01\n\nFollowing the trial, Seibu Railway began full-scale operation of the system from November.\n\n12:15\n\nOn August 31, a test run of a Class D51 steam locomotive was held on the JR Yamaguchi Line.\n\n12:29\n\nThe Class D51 that pulls the tourist train SL Yamaguchi has been undergoing repairs\n\n12:36\n\nafter the tender that loads coal and water malfunctioned in 2022.\n\n12:44\n\nThe test run on this day is to inspect the vehicle.\n\n12:54\n\nAt an intermediate station, maintenance staff inspect the train for any defects.\n\n13:03\n\nThe Class D51 hadn't been seen running on the Yamaguchi Line in a year and four months so it attracted many railfans.\n\n13:15\n\nI'm happy to see it running after such a long time.\n\n13:21\n\nJR West will continue to inspect the vehicle in order to resume the SL Yamaguchi service.\n\n13:34\n\nOn September 28, JR East, which is aiming to build a new logistics system using the Shinkansen,\n\n13:41\n\nconducted a full-scale trial run using the Hokuriku Shinkansen to transport agricultural products and other goods in bulk from Nagano Prefecture.\n\n13:54\n\nAt the rolling stock depot in Nagano City, agricultural products such as Shine Muscat grapes, as well as precision machinery,\n\n14:03\n\ntotaling approximately 700 boxes, were loaded onto the Shinkansen.\n\n14:11\n\nFor this trial, they checked the operation to see how much cargo can be handled efficiently.\n\n14:24\n\nJR East plans to begin running a commercial logistics system using the Hokuriku Shinkansen in or after April 2024.\n\n14:39\n\nOn November 10, Nagoya Railroad in Aichi Prefecture began operating a system that detects abnormalities at rail crossings.\n\n14:52\n\nWith this system, AI, artificial intelligence, analyzes images from surveillance cameras installed near railway crossings in real time.\n\n15:05\n\nThe system automatically detects when a person or vehicle is inside the crossing when a train is approaching.\n\n15:20\n\nWhen there is an abnormality, a signal beside the track in front of the crossing lights up to tell the driver to apply the emergency brake.\n\n15:33\n\nNagoya Railroad plans to install the system at 10 locations in Aichi Prefecture by March 2024.\n\n15:45\n\nThat dinosaurs train looked absolutely fantastic and I love how it brought together,\n\n15:50\n\nthe hobbies of big and little kids which are trains and dinosaurs.\n\n15:56\n\nAnd I loved the \"etSETOra\" trains with all those non-Japanese passengers wearing the \"yukata.\"\n\n16:03\n\nThey looked really really nice.\n\n16:06\n\nYeah, they looked really fun and I would've love to actually take part in that tour.\n\n16:09\n\nMentioning foreign travelers and tourists, I think that simultaneous translation system\n\n16:15\n\nthat they had at the station looked very interesting.\n\n16:18\n\nYes, indeed. And that, I think it's inspired by the latest developments of the Artificial Intelligence technology.\n\n16:27\n\nAnd, you know, it's definitely the possibility that railway companies should pursue,\n\n16:34\n\nand there's an ample possibilities that they will succeed.\n\n16:37\n\nYeah, we had say goodbye to some vehicles and we could say hello to some new vehicles.\n\n16:44\n\nLet's have a look.\n\n16:47\n\nOn October 17, the new Yakumo limited express train that runs mainly on the JR Hakubi Line\n\n16:54\n\nconnecting Okayama and Shimane prefectures was unveiled to the press.\n\n17:05\n\nThe bronze color of the car body was inspired by the setting sun on the surface of Lake Shinji\n\n17:11\n\nand the flimming torches at festivals in Shimane Prefecture.\n\n17:19\n\nInside the train, all of the seats are equipped with power outlets, and there is now space for suitcases and other large luggage items.\n\n17:32\n\nAnother major change is comfort.\n\n17:35\n\nThe new train is equipped with a device that tilts the car body as it rounds curves to improve the comfort of the ride.\n\n17:52\n\nWe hope the train will become an iconic part\n\nof the landscape along the Hakubi Line\n\n17:57\n\nand be loved by passengers and locals\n\nfor many years to come.\n\n18:03\n\nThis new Yakumo limited express is scheduled to begin service from April 2024.\n\n18:15\n\nOn October 27, the Transportation Bureau, City of Sendai, in Miyagi Prefecture invited elementary school students on a tour\n\n18:24\n\nto familiarize them with the new rolling stock that will be introduced in the fall of 2024.\n\n18:37\n\nRunning along the top of the aluminum car's brushed-metal bodywork\n\n18:41\n\nis a yellow-green and green line reminiscent of the lush green city of Sendai.\n\n18:52\n\nInside the cars, there are now more handrails along the bench seats,\n\n18:57\n\nand to ensure barrier-free accessibility there is a wheelchair space in each car.\n\n19:07\n\nThe new vehicle is very nice. It has more handrails\n\nthan before and the seats are very comfortable.\n\n19:18\n\nOn December 23, JR East's new tourist train \"Hinabi\" made its debut.\n\n19:27\n\nThis train will operate on routes in both Aomori and Iwate prefectures.\n\n19:32\n\nOn this day, the departure ceremony was held at Morioka Station in Iwate Prefecture.\n\n19:44\n\nThe exterior of the 2-car train is white, with red accents and designs depicting elements from nature\n\n19:51\n\nsuch as flower blossoms, mountains, and rivers.\n\n20:01\n\nEach car has an observation area with large windows so passengers can enjoy the scenery along the line.\n\n20:13\n\nThe train can carry up to 59 passengers.\n\n20:16\n\nThe Green Car has box seats for four people and two people, as well as single seats.\n\n20:29\n\nSeen off by rail fans and JR staff, \"Hinabi\" departs with 55 passengers onboard who reserved their seats in advance.\n\n20:45\n\nWhile 2023 saw the debut of several new vehicles, others, sadly, had to be retired.\n\n20:54\n\nOn July 21, many rail fans gathered at Okayama Station where the Series 117 that ran on the JR Sanyo Main Line\n\n21:04\n\nwas scheduled to depart for its final run.\n\n21:11\n\nThe popular Series 117, was introduced in 1979 back in the days of the Japanese National Railways.\n\n21:26\n\nI wanted to ride it one last time to send it off.\n\n21:29\n\nThe prominent face of the train is very nostalgic.\n\n21:34\n\nIt has a retro feel that goes back to the days of\n\nthe Japanese National Railways. It's very cool.\n\n22:24\n\nHowever, due to declining sales and labor shortages, the company decided to discontinue the service.\n\n22:34\n\nMany passengers expressed their regret that the onboard trolley service was coming to and end.\n\n22:43\n\nIt feels like we are turning a page in history.\n\n22:47\n\nIf I was running late, I felt safe knowing I could\n\nget something to eat and drink onboard.\n\n22:53\n\nI'll miss it when it's gone.\n\n22:58\n\nIn November, the Tokaido Shinkansen introduced a new service for Green Car passengers,\n\n23:04\n\nallowing them to order food and drinks from their seats using their mobile devices.\n\n23:14\n\nOn November 23, the \"Okuizumo Orochi\" tourist train that ran on the JR Kisuki Line\n\n23:21\n\nbetween Shimane and Hiroshima prefectures ended service.\n\n23:32\n\nThe train, which began service in 1998, attracted many tourists with its retro wooden seats, and peaceful country views.\n\n23:51\n\nHowever, due to the deterioration of the locomotive, the service was discontinued.\n\n23:59\n\nSince it's the train's last run, we want to\n\nmake a memory that will last forever.\n\n24:03\n\nThank you for 26 years. That's all I want to say.\n\n24:16\n\nThe train made its last round-trip watched over by a number of people who live along the line.\n\n24:26\n\nArriving at the terminal station a little after 4:00 p.m.,\n\n24:30\n\nwhere many fans waited to say goodbye, \"Okuizumo Orochi\" closed the curtain on its 26-year history.\n\n24:44\n\nIn Osaki City, Miyagi Prefecture, an old steam locomotive statically preserved near JR Nishi-Furukawa Station\n\n24:52\n\nwhich is now scheduled to be dismantled was decorated with lights.\n\n25:03\n\nThis steam locomotive is a former Japanese National Railways class C58, which ran in Miyagi Prefecture until the 1970s.\n\n25:16\n\nAfter it retired, the locomotive was stored outside in this park for nearly 50 years.\n\n25:22\n\nHowever, the body became so damaged it was set to be dismantled.\n\n25:31\n\nIt was inevitable, really. Sadly, it's just\n\ntoo hard to maintain.\n\n25:36\n\nAfter all, it's very old now.\n\n25:41\n\nTo send it off in style, a local residents' organization decided to decorate the locomotive with lights,\n\n25:47\n\nwhich could be seen from October 22 until the end of November.\n\n25:58\n\nThe locomotive was decorated with approximately 80,000 LED lights;\n\n26:03\n\na delightful spectacle for passengers passing by the park on the train.\n\n26:15\n\nThis Class C58 is set to be fully dismantled by the end of February 2024.\n\n26:31\n\nThere were definitely some sad goodbyes but also some promising new beginnings\n\n26:35\n\nlike the new Yakumo with that bronze colored body and it looked amazing.\n\n26:40\n\nYes, and those vehicles come with the latest version of the tilting system\n\n26:44\n\nwhich are designed to improve the ride qualities for the passengers.\n\n26:48\n\nI do hope that, in the near future, I can try those trains\n\n26:52\n\nand see how those systems work on that particular stretch of the railway.\n\n26:58\n\nAnother thing I'm sad that we had to say goodbye to is the onboard trolley service on the Tokaido Shinkansen.\n\n27:04\n\nI used to look forward to that lady coming down, the aisle with her cart selling drinks between Kyoto and Tokyo on my trips."
