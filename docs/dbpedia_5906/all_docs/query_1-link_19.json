        "text": "Post-quake power issues\n\nWhen the quake hit, most of the power plants that serve Tokyo went offline automatically. That was a very good thing because Tokyo is served with nuclear, thermal and hydroelectric power. Nobody wants a nuclear emergency due to an earthquake.\n\nUnfortunately, we are having one.\n\nTEPCO is handling it as professionally and safely as possible by evacuating 90,000 people in a 20 km radius of the the Fukushima 1 power plant, venting pressurized gas in controlled ways, and basically destroying reactor number one by pumping sea water and boric acid into the reactor to cool it and kill the reaction. Very likely, reactor number one will never be brought back online.\n\nReactor number three is experiencing a cooling system malfunction today as well, so the TEPCO folks are really hustling. I have confidence that they will keep things under control.\n\nNobody in Tokyo is at risk. Even if there is meltdown in either reactor, it is unlikely to affect Tokyo dwellers with radiation. Scare tactics aside, we are 200km away and the type of reactor that is in crisis isn't going to explode.\n\nBut the power plant shutdowns very may well affect us in another way. With so many sources of energy offline, TEPCO may not have enough electricity to meet peak demand. It said on Saturday morning that there might need to be blackouts and requested us to conserve energy as much as possible. But then they found some more electrons in a back closet or something and avoided having to cut any power. Today rumours of rolling blackouts and power loss are rampant and it's hard to find out the facts, so let's conserve as much as possible and hope for more back closets at TEPCO.\n\n10 ways to conserve electricity\n\nTurn off your TV.\n\nSame goes for stereo, game consoles, computers, printers, etc.\n\nDisconnect your heated toilet seat.\n\nMove your computer server to an offsite host outside Japan.\n\nUnplug appliances you aren't using. Lots of them draw power even when they are off.\n\nSwitch to compact fluorescent light bulbs.\n\nTurn off lights if you aren't using them.\n\nUse solar power to dry your washing.\n\nTurn down the heat and put on a sweater.\n\nStart a raw foods diet.\n\nI will be implementing #4 today, hopefully before any rumoured or real power disruptions. But I expect that this hosting transfer isn't going to go 100% smoothly as I am also upgrading my blogging software at the same time. So I apologise in advance for any ugliness, broken links, or other discombobulations on mediatinker. I will strive to have it all up and running beautifully again asap.\n\nPosted by kuri at 01:36 PM [view entry with 0 comments)]\n\nGrocery non-shopping\n\nThe supermarket in my neighborhood has a lot of empty shelves tonight.

At least there will be something to eat. We won't have to add \"famine\" to our list of apocalypses.\n\nPosted by kuri at 10:09 PM [view entry with 0 comments)]\n\nThe Big One, Bunkyo style\n\nWell, I think we just lived through the long-overdue, ever-feared \"Big One\" that seismologists have been predicting for decades. It didn't have its epicenter in Tokyo, but we sure as fuck felt it. I can't even imagine what it must have been nearer the epicenter. But let me tell you what it was like here.\n\nTod & I were together at home this afternoon when the quake struck at 2:45. It was scary. Our five story apartment building shuddered and rocked like a ship at sea.\n\nAfter the first few seconds, when the initial shake started getting worse, I opened an exit to the balcony and we stood together in the doorway watching the birds flap confusedly, trees sway and every local structure rattle and moan. It was disconcerting and eerily beautiful at the same time. I was fascinated and calm while it happened and very grateful that I wasn't alone. It seemed to last for an eternity, though it was maybe less than two minutes in reality.\n\nOur lucky boat capsized.\n\nEven when the shaking calmed to a rolling wave and it seemed safe to move, things were still swaying. It felt like stepping back onto land after a long voyage and we were both feeling sort of seasick. I ran around the house to see what had happened. Stuff had fallen off shelves, counters and surfaces over all over the house, though amazingly enough nothing really broke. I put most of it to right in a few minutes.\n\nThe city made an emergency announcement over the public address system - the first time they have ever done that in my memory - though with the flapity-flap of helicopters and the echoing distortion off buildings, I could barely make out a word. Our apartment was still standing, so I figured we were fine to stay in it. We checked Twitter for the first details, updated Facebook status and more or less calmed down for a few minutes.\n\nJapanese lanterns are stacked stones, now unstacked.\n\nThen I wanted to go examine the what was up. In the hallway, the first sign of trouble. A stone lantern had fallen over and cracked the floor-to-ceiling plate glass window. Oops. Another stone lantern was toppled on the first floor, but that seems to be the extent of problems in our building. Amazing considering how loudly it was creaking and the amount of sway it experienced.\n\nWe went out to see the world. Really not a lot of damage in our area. A few unhitched cable TV wires and some crumbled old plaster. We stopped into the flower shop on the corner to check in with the store owner. She said she could see the big apartment buildings swaying. From one of the 13th floor balconies, someone's stuff had fallen to the street.\n\nAfter the quake a beer to celebrate surviving.\n\nWe continued on to Kashiwaya, our local liquor store, to see how our friends there had fared and also to get a beer. Our friend and their shop were fine - two bottles of sake had toppled over and broken but that was all. We ordered two draft beers and sat at the table outside the shop to watch people go by. We got a lot of double takes and some envious smiles, the two of us calmly enjoying our drinks. The worse was over and we were safe together. It was going to be OK.\n\nThe sidewalk was crowded with commuters walking home because every train in the capitol was stopped. People were actually hurrying, unusual in a city where ambling is the norm. Kasuga Dori is a main emergency road and it was pretty much packed with people from the afternoon until well into the night.\n\nDetermined walkers head home.\n\nWhen it got cold after dark, I felt compelled to go out and give away my extra hats, gloves and scarves to all those people walking home a long way who needed them. I was oddly fearful to get too far from Tod so I pushed aside the feeling of needing to help and stayed inside. But the need to do something, anything to help people on this very strange day got too strong and I worked up the courage to go outside alone. It is hard to give stuff away in Tokyo, but I eventually found people who were cold enough to accept my mismatched accessories.\n\nNow it's almost 11 pm. We are listening to the Japanese news radio reporting on people trying to get home. At Shinjuku station the trains are still stopped, there is a 100 meter long queue for taxis...and no taxis. The streets are gridlocked with traffic. All the buses are completely crammed. Hotels are full. Convenience stores are running out of supplies in some places. Some people are in for a long, cold night. The aftershocks continue to make everything shake and sway in Tokyo.\n\nAnd we got off lightly in Tokyo. The worst happened more than 300 km north of here. The magnitude of the quake was 100 times stronger than the one in Haiti last year. It reached the highest level of the Shindo scale, 7, and was eventually given an 8.9 magnitude.\n\nEvery minute brings more horrible news from the north. There's a nuclear emergency in Fukushima with a reactor on the verge of melt down and people being evacuated; Kurihara, a town of 77,000, was entirely destroyed; 1800 people are taking refuge in an elementary school in Aomori; and the videos of the tsunami rolling inland are so disturbing that I can't watch them. The grisly discoveries of corpses are just beginning; the number will not be small.\n\nTomorrow some friends and I are getting together to hoop at Yoyogi to relieve our stress and brainstorm ways we can help even a little bit. Feel free to join us. 12:30 in the usual place.\n\nPosted by kuri at 07:01 PM [view entry with 5 comments)]\n\nTokyo Sky Tree\n\nI've been sort of poo-pooing the fuss over the newest, tallest structure in Tokyo, the Tokyo Sky Tree. It's been hyped since before it was even begun in 2008 and ever since it got big enough to photograph well, it's been featured on TV, in magazines and well, everywhere you turn. Yeah, yeah. It's just another big tower to broadcast media. Whatever.\n\nWell, today I caught a glimpse of it from the top of my street and suddenly, I just had to go there. I needed to make a pilgrimage to the Sky Tree and I couldn't stop myself. It didn't hurt that the day was almost 24 degrees, with blue skies and lots of fresh wind. I wouldn't be able to stay inside, even if I should be packing for Prague.\n\nDestination Sky Tree!\n\nSo after checking the level of the river after this morning's huge rainstorm (it had risen, but only 30 cm or so) I took the bus to Ueno and the subway to Tawaramachi and walked to Asakusa. I stopped in and said konnichiwa to the deities, then crossed the bridge and walked to Oshiage.\n\nThe tower is huge and exceedingly impressive. It's gorgeous, a pure white lattice with oversize bolts and handles running up as far as I could see. The construction site is in constant motion with trucks crisscrossing the area, which will be a giant commercial complex with several buildings when Tokyo Sky Tree opens in Spring 2012. The tower is enormous. It will be the second tallest structure on the planet when it's finished (I had no idea) and at 511 meters currently, it is taller than the Empire State Building and Petronas Towers.\n\nI wasn't the only one looking at the construction. There were dozens of sightseers taking pictures.I was surprised at home many people turned up to look at this unfinished tower. I can only imagine what it will be like when it is finished. Busy! I'll be there, for sure. I might skip opening day, though.\n\nThe surrounding neighborhood is taking advantage of this popularity. There are holiday lights in the shape of the tower, signs featuring the silhouette of the Sky Tree, and food specials in cafes'. A tiny storefront nearby selling calendars, keychains and other memorabilia was doing a brisk business today. I saw the manufactory where an old man was heat stamping wooden postcards with the Sky Tree logo. There seems to be a lot of secondary construction around, too - old buildings being rebuilt as money comes into the area.\n\nI walked all the way around the tower site, taking in the back streets and viewing it from different angles until I'd had my fill of Tokyo Sky Tree. Then I walked all the way back to Ueno and caught the bus home.\n\nIt was a great day out and I shall poo-poo no more. Tokyo Sky Tree deserves the adulations and attention it gets.\n\nPosted by kuri at 05:55 PM [view entry with 0 comments)]\n\nRemarkable Rain Storm\n\nWhen Tod crawled into bed last night at 1, he whispered to me, \"It's raining.\" I woke up and listened for a minute before being soothed back to sleep by the sound. When I woke again, it was dawn-dark but the clock said 7:30. I slipped out of bed to the crashing sound of a major deluge. Wow, it was going off!\n\nThe air was so thick with rain that it looked like a tap had been turned on. A slanted curtain of water veiled even the nearest building. There was thunder and lightning, but no rumble of trains or any traffic noise.\n\nWithin the hour, the rain had eased to a stop, the sky sported patches of blue, birds chirped an all-clear to their companions.\n\nNow the neighborhood maintenance men are surveying the floods. I hear the sounds of stiff bristled brooms and shopvacs. I hope they look up.\n\nPosted by kuri at 08:17 AM [view entry with 1 comments)]\n\nHaunted Tokyo\n\nHokusai's grave is specially protected with a roof.\n\nEarlier this week, Tracey invited me to join her on a walking tour with a special theme - Haunted Tokyo. Just the right season for it and a lovely grey day to add to the atmosphere.\n\nLilly Fields, our tour guide, has lived in Tokyo for 25 years and knows her spooky back streets and alleys of shitamachi, those lower lying areas on the east side of town where the working folks traditionally live. Shitamachi is full of spirits and weird energy - ancient and new. We started the tour at Inaricho station and meandered through the blocks visiting temples and shrines and hearing legends and scary stories all the way up through to Asakusa.\n\nI think my favorite bit of the afternoon was visiting the grave of Hokusai, one of Japan's most famous artists. It is tucked away down a narrow stone path in a postage stamp graveyard behind the side building of a really boring concrete temple. In addition to the famous wave woodblock print, Hokusai drew a lot of scary ghosts and demons. He believed that if he lived to 110, all of the lines and dots he drew would come alive. Fortunately for us, his demons live only on paper - he died at age 99.\n\nPosted by kuri at 09:45 AM [view entry with 1 comments)]\n\nNigouhan Zaka\n\nYesterday afternoon, Tod & I were enjoying one of our Sunday rambles through local but unfamiliar territory when we encountered Nigouhan Zaka äºååå, which translates to Two and a Half Measure Hill. Funny name. What could it mean? A historical marker gave us the answer.\n\nBack in the day when Tokyo's buildings were a lot shorter, you could see the upper half of Mt. Nikko from the top of the hill. The \"measure\" in the name is of mountains. Japan's tallest mountain, Mt. Fuji, is divided into ten gou from the base to the summit. Since Mt. Nikko is half the height of Mt Fuji, it is 5 gou tall, and you could see only half of it from Two and a Half Measure Hill.\n\nThe sign gave an alternate explanation, as well. The hill is purportedly so steep that if you drink one measure of sake and walk up the slope, by the time you reach the top it feels as though you've drunk 2 and a half measures. The hill didn't seem that steep to me and I had no sake to experiment. Maybe next time.\n\nPosted by kuri at 12:31 PM [view entry with 0 comments)]\n\nHaruna\n\nSunrise over Haruna\n\nI was dying for an interlude between projects, so we booked two nights in the mountains of Gunma to relax. As it turned out, it wasn't very relaxing at all for various reasons.\n\nWe started out after lunchtime on Thursday and missed the last bus to Haruna from the Takasaki train station. Tod was in tears as I was trying to stay calm and relatively positive. Fortunately we found a bus that got us about halfway along the 60 minute trip and the hotel rescued us at the terminal in Muroda. Thank you, Agatsuma Sou staff!\n\nOnce we were there, it was refreshing to breathe the fresh air and see perfectly blue skies, freshly rain-sprung mushrooms, flitting butterflies and gorgeous green trees. Haruna was once a very large volcano which has gone through several cycles of erupting and reforming itself. Today it has both a crescent-shaped caldera lake and a new cone. It's awesomely picturesque.\n\nStopping to smell the flowers\n\nWe filled our days with a lot of activity. On Friday, we circumnavigated the lake on foot, took a kitchy tourist lake cruise, rode the ropeway to the top of Haruna and hiked around the peak a little, rented a rowboat for half an hour so I could work my upper body after our long walk and simultaneously enjoy a beer on the lake, took a lot of baths and ate too much.\n\nSaturday hiking route from hotel to park\n\nOn Saturday after breakfast, we decided to check out the exposed rocks on the mountain near our hotel. The cartoon map we'd picked up at the tourist center said it was about a 20 minute hike. Seemed reasonable, even with a migraine messing up my balance and vision. It was a pretty simple walk up through the forest to the rocks. The view over the lake was lovely and once there we opted to continue hiking - only another 800 meters to the next spot on the map. Doable. When we looked more carefully at our tourist map later, that spot, Kamon-ga-take, is the tallest mountain in the area.\n\nMountain hiking with migraine. What am I thinking?\n\nThree hours later after several near misses on the trail, a bit of short temperage, and some mountain peak yoga, we slid our way out of the well-blazed, excessively steep, muddy, short but seldom used side trail that lead to a park we'd visited the day before. We washed out hands and feet, Tod rescued a butterfly from the museum/atelier, and we went off to have lunch. Only my head hurt so much that I couldn't eat. So we collected out bags, got an ice cream and set back to Tokyo on the bus we'd missed on Thursday.\n\nWe'll be back to Haruna when the lake freezes over and the ice-karting season starts.\n\nPosted by kuri at 05:45 PM [view entry with 0 comments)]\n\nDeanne and Masao's wedding weekend\n\nCongratulations, Deanne and Masao, on your wonderful weekend of celebrations.\n\nThe Kira Kira Circus at Inokashira Park brought together scores of well-wishers, including about 80% of my Japan-based friends. We costumed up in sparkly clothes and bright colors, gorged ourselves on popcorn, danced and hooped in the center ring, played with a parachute, had our bodies painted, kissed the bride at the kissing booth, and laughed the afternoon into an energetic frenzy. Sarah got some great photos of the circus picnic.\n\nSunday was the ceremony at FAB. The bride wore a simple outfit: white lace body stockings layered under a lace covered top and tap pants, with white boots, lace-encrusted spats and knee pad, a lace choker and a tall feather headpiece. An organdy over skirt with Polonaise draping and Japanese obi completed the ensemble. The entire outfit was covered in hundreds of clear Swarovski crystals applied by the bride herself. The groom wore a silver-grey suit with a mesh and lace shirt studded with crystals.\n\nIt was not a traditional wedding, by any stretch of the traditional imagination. The processional music was a live operatic version of Lady Gaga's Bad Romance by Akiko; the officiant was Guy, a professional vaudeville clown who performed magic, played a tune on the saw and kept the ceremony moving along with lots of laughs and help from his translation partner and beautiful assistant, Kana. The usual ring exchange was replaced by partner hooping. There was no veil to be lifted, but Kike dramatically removed the overskirt so that Deanne could hoop and dance. Later in the day, we enjoyed a burlesque fan dance by Cheery Typhoon and a dance number by Diana and Miki. And (of course) Deanne did a hoop performance, even though she did say it was her day off...\n\nThere were readings and speeches at the wedding - likely the most traditional part of the whole day - and every one of them was an original. We heard a welcome speech by Masao's father; two amazing poems from Jonathan and Melissa; the e-mail where Masao confided to his friend Maurice that he'd met a girl; a funny rant from Leila who couldn't make it.\n\nI did a reading, too. Deanne and Masao are positive and fresh people but most wedding readings are stale and negative, so I wrote a piece that reflects things that they believe in. It also had to be something that I could recite without crying. This is it:\n\nThe marriage of two people reveals an unexpected third being. You are still your familiar, individual selves and you now are also part of Deanne-and-Masao.\n\nDeanne-and-Masao is the sum of Deanne plus Masao. It is all the interactions that make up your life together. It is the energy that you create and the feelings that you have for each other.\n\nDeanne-and-Masao is fluid. It ebbs and surges like the tides. It flows to meet love. It expands and changes shape as you grow.\n\nDeanne-and-Masao exists in the present moment. It lives for here and now, and it accepts everything as it comes.\n\nDeanne-and-Masao offers astonishing freedom. It gives you all the space you need for exploration. Anywhere you wander, Deanne-and-Masao always guides you back when you're ready.\n\nDeanne-and-Masao is uplifted by love, compassion and caring. It draws on your generous spirits, and on the affection of friends, family and loved ones.\n\nAlong with everyone here today I wish both of you, and Deanne-and-Masao, a gorgeous, bountiful, and energized life together!\n\n[P.S. Yes, online friend, you have my permission to read this at your wedding. If you want to give credit, I'm Kristen McQuillin.]\n\nTod shot a 45 minute video of the whole ceremony (strong, steady hands!), but technical difficulties are hounding us. I'll post it soon.\n\nThe weekend was so full of smiles and love that I'm a little sad it's over. But I am looking forward to the next huge event that we create together.\n\nPosted by kuri at 07:06 AM [view entry with 1 comments)]\n\nShizuoka Surprises\n\nThis weekend I took a handful hoops on the Shinkansen to Shizuoka for a hoop picnic with Ellie and some of her local hooping crew. We had a fun afternoon getting silly in the spin. I had so much fun that I took no pictures or videos, as usual...\n\nOne of my Tokyo hooping friends, Arika, came up as well. Her family is from the area and it was a good excuse to visit. When she arrived at the park with her second cousins, Rina and Aki Ichikawa, she asked me if I'd like to come back to their house after for tea. Long story short, I ended up spending the night and crashing the family Obon feast the next day.\n\nThree generations of the Makino family and an interloper\n\nIt was a treat to hang out with an family. Being a half of childless couple is a situation I love, but there is joy in the bustle of a three generation household hosting guests where cousins and sisters drop in. There was lots of back chat about how we'd get from point A to point B, phone calls made to arrange things, consternation over whether anything had actually been arranged, discussion of drink supplies, lots of laughter and endless talk.\n\nThe Ichikawas are a very talented family. Yoshiharu is an architect, Mayumi paints, Rina plays piano and dances and Aki is a budding actress. Sachiko, at 79, keeps everything together. Her husband, Seiji, is currently in Cambodia visiting a aid project he's part of.\n\nEri, me and Rina with hoops in the rotary near Kusunagi station\n\nWe watched TV, played in the park, hooped in the rotary, and had conversations in Japanese and English (sometimes simultaneously). I was treated to a peach crepe in the family's cafe, ate four homecooked meals that I didn't have to prepare, borrowed pajamas from Mayumi, dried the dishes, and tried to participate as much as possible while simultaneously not causing any trouble. Ha!\n\nI learned all sorts of things over the weekend. Thanks to some entertaining and educational TV shows, I finally know the difference between atsuage and aburaage, which are both deep fried tofu. And I learned about the subtypes of DNA that Japanese have - none of which originated in Japan (Take that, Japanese racists, your genes were made in China and Korea).\n\nCousins Aki and Eri napping on the engawa after lunch\n\nOn Sunday, I was moved to tears when Rina played a valse on the piano for me. I had a session of Ito Thermie, which blends elements of moxibustion, shiatsu and acupuncture into one treatment. What a lovely and relaxing therapy practiced by Mayumi's twin, Hiromi. At the same time, I learned a new word that will be very useful for hooping - tanden ä¸¹ç° - the energy center just below the belly button that corresponds to the 2nd chakra.\n\nBuildings in the Makino family's farm complex\n\nThen we drove out to the center of the family love - a mikan farm currently owned by the 4th generation of the Makino family. I met more than 20 members of the family including Arika's parents and siblings, paid my respects at the family altar, ate delicious foods from farm fresh produce, and mapped out the Makino genealogy after the Obon feast.\n\nThe Makino butusdan with Obon offerings\n\nOn the way home on the Shinkansen with Arika and Haruki after one last dinner at the Ichikawa's, we made as much happy noise as possible by being frightened by ghosts outside the train and pulling faces. (Next time you see Haruki or Arika, ask them to show you buta megane, pig glasses.)\n\nIt was the sort of weekend where, on returning home, you wonder that only 36 hours have passed. It felt like a week. Thank you, Ellie for organising the hoop picnic and getting me out of Tokyo, and Arika for keeping me away. I was very happy!\n\nPosted by kuri at 03:44 PM [view entry with 3 comments)]\n\nBunkyo Eating Out Rally\n\nBunkyo-ku is having a restaurant rally from 7/1 - 12/28.

I didn't know it.\n\nThey are called ããªã«ã³ (barikan) after Barriquand et Marre, a French company that also made engines for the Wright Brothers and for early automobiles. They seem to have gone out of business a long time ago.\n\nClippers became popular in Japan at the beginning of the Meiji Restoration, when the Emperor decreed men must cut off their topknots and then started conscripting soldiers in 1873. Maruzen imported the first French \"barikan\" in 1874 and by 1888, Japan has its own clipper manufacturers in Osaka and Tokyo.\n\nSo now you know. And according to the box, Wahl is the world's #1 manufacturer of barikan.\n\nPosted by kuri at 12:53 PM [view entry with 0 comments)]\n\nMe and Jack\n\nJack and I practice our different forms of physical fitness at the local park. He's 84 and certainly in better shape than I am. After his daily 900 strokes with a wooden kendo sword, he runs up and down the slope several times. Today he did 20 swings on the chin-up bar; I managed about 5 before my arms gave out. But I was able to hang and hoop simultaneously, which was fun.\n\nJack has lots of stories to share when we take breaks from our exertions. He's been all over the world, traveling to construction sites in South America and Asia. He tells me all about his experiences during the war and on the job. We talk about exercise, the people around us, our families, Japanese culture, and whether or not I should be a famous hoop performer. Often we are silly together, like in this photo where I am trying to make Tod jealous.\n\nFor the past few months, I hadn't seen him around and I wondered if he'd fallen ill, but I think our schedules were just off kilter a bit. I am sure as the weather warms, we'll see each other more.\n\nPosted by kuri at 06:17 PM [view entry with 0 comments)]\n\nHoliday transition\n\nThe hardcover tree is back on the bookshelf.\n\nI am always keen to finish Christmas as soon as possible. I gather up my gifts the morning after and put them away, write thank you notes without delay, and take down decorations for storage until next time.\n\nJapan agrees with me and I love the change in the vibe of the city after December 25th as everyone moves on from Christmas romance to the family-oriented new year season. By the 26th, Christmas decorations are totally gone and replaced by pine and straw charms. For the next few days everyone is going to be cleaning, paying bills and tying up loose ends before the calendar flips to 2010. People in every situation are cheery and excited. The mood is festive and pleasant in a way pre-Christmas is not.\n\nI am looking forward to visiting the temple on NYE for some warm sake and a bit of soup, then strolling around a nearly deserted city on the first and second of the month. So quiet and peaceful. But for now, I have some cleaning to do!!\n\nPosted by kuri at 04:05 PM [view entry with 1 comments)]\n\nPlease do it at home\n\nMy interpretation of my own behaviour as part of the long-running series of train manner posters in the Tokyo Metro.

I have been hearing crickets since last week. Normally I notice them at the very end of August or the beginning of September. This year they have been chirping night songs since August 19th and early mornings for the last few days. I love autumn so this makes me happy, but it was a very short summer. What will this mean for food prices and winter weather?\n\nMatsutake are creeping into the produce aisles now. These fragrant fall mushrooms will become more prominent on the shelves with their other fungal brethren in coming weeks, but I am always happy to see the early ones. Late summer is wonderfully abundant time for vegetables and fruits. As the weather cools I get hungrier and there is all this marvelous food waiting for me. Thank you, Mother Nature.\n\nElection season is upon us as well. There are station-side rallies every day and loudspeaker trucks are driving around shouting out props to the people and politicians. Across the way a neighbor's pet beagle howls every time the female voiced trucks pass by. Poor puppy, I know how you feel. I want to scream at the political jargon and noise, too.\n\nPosted by kuri at 09:37 AM [view entry with 2 comments)]\n\nConfluence of Rattle and Rain\n\nNature's Scoreboard\n\nDayTimeEventSeverityReactionSunday8 pmEarthquakeM6.9; S4Surprise!Monday7 amFierce Rain65 mmWow.Tuesday5 amEarthquakeM6.6; S4Again?Tuesday??Typhoon #9Pfft...\n\nWe've experienced two big earthquakes in three days - a magnitude 6.9 on Sunday at 8 pm and one of 6.6 this morning at 5, both felt in Tokyo as a 4 on the Shindo scale. These were good shakers; in the stationery store on Sunday, pens rattled in their displays. This morning the bed rocked like a choppy ocean and I heard our glasses clinking together in their cabinet. No damage done in either quake in Tokyo, but there are some fires and collapses nearer the epicenter in this morning's quake. NHK says we should be braced for further quakes, but not the Big One.\n\nFollowing the quake Sunday we had a torrential rain yesterday morning. 65mm fell in under two hours. It was impressive. The river rose quickly at Iidabashi and I heard the flood warning sirens sound, though the river didn't flood.\n\nThis morning I am battening down for the main thrust of Typhoon #9. By battening down, I mean making a pot of coffee and turning on a light as the sky dims. The rain has started, but it's gentle so far. Despite that typhoons are equivalent to hurricanes, I rarely worry about them, which is probably completely insane. But so often the warnings come to nothing - the typhoon veers away before it reaches the city or it peters out. They are hard to predict accurately so there is a lot of wolf-crying. I think, though, this one might actually slam us.\n\nScience says no, but I still think there is a link between rain and earthquakes.\n\nPosted by kuri at 06:54 AM [view entry with 2 comments)]\n\nEdogawa Fireworks\n\nThe evening was unseasonably cool but our party staved off most of the chill with hooping, poi, and being silly. 14,000 fireworks were beautiful as always and we had a fun group of friends, old and new, to enjoy it with. Despite the other half a million people attending, we had a large space to spread out and run around.\n\nPosted by kuri at 04:37 PM [view entry with 0 comments)]\n\nFireworks parties\n\nIt's fireworks season, with dozen of elaborate explosive displays packed into a few hot summer weekends.\n\nOn Saturday, we attended Shinji & Chako's annual fireworks viewing party. From their apartment balcony, we enjoyed the Sumida River fireworks popping up above the buildings in the distance. When the balcony got crowded, we turned towards the TV, where yukata-clad TV personalities commentated the fireworks with jests and facts in a manner similar to the Macy's Thanksgiving parade TV coverage.\n\nChako spent the whole time in the kitchen, preparing and refreshing a feast of sushi, salad, fried chicken, croquettes of every type, desserts and fruit. Shinji flitted amongst the guests, cracking jokes and sometimes confusing us all with his unique blend of Japanese and English. And at the end of the night, one of my favorite parts of the party - rakugo and shamisen from Yoshida-san. Every year, Yoshida-san arrives dressed in a somber blue kimono with a small case in hand, has a chat with everyone, drinks a few beers then sits down in front of his audience and acts out comic skits while he plays music. It is always such a treat to have live entertainment at a home party.\n\nNext Saturday, I'm hosting a party for the Edogawa fireworks. No TV and no balcony, this one will be on the ground under the fire flowers themselves. If you'd like to come along, meet at Iidabashi station on the Sobu line platform at 4:30. We'll travel into the crowds together and find a place for a picnic & play before the show starts at 7:15. Bring some picnic foods to share, toys, and whatever else you think will make the evening fun (bug spray? sun screen? cameras?). A sense of camaraderie and goodwill towards strangers is a essential - these events are crowded.\n\nPosted by kuri at 08:15 AM [view entry with 0 comments)]\n\nHybrid Summer Fashion\n\nI wanted to dress up for the yukata festival in Nagahama, but even though I like the way summer kimono look, I really don't enjoy wearing them. They constrain my movement to mincing steps (or I face the consequences of flapping the bottom edges of the yukata and showing my legs) and geta - the traditional shoes - are so extraordinarily painful that I have vowed to never wear them again.\n\nSo I decided to make my own style. I cut an old yukata to tunic length and wore it with leggings. I tied my own obi and dressed it up with some flowers and cords. On top, traditional and pretty. On the bottom - freedom of movement!\n\nI wasn't quite prepared for the reactions from passersby. In Tokyo, nobody would have looked at me twice - or if they did, it would have been discreet. In Nagahama, people gawked, pointed and laughed. Ouch.\n\nA schoolgirl in sports uniform, leading a large team of similarly clad girls called back to them as we approached, \"That's not Japanese! Look, that's not Japanese at all!\" to which I replied - shouting across the intersection to her - \"No, I'm not Japanese, am I?\" in Japanese. She blanched and her friends tittered. Older ladies stopped me to ask if this was my original fashion. Yes, I told them, and it was so easy to walk in. They agreed with a smile. Some oddly coiffed teens looked askance at me, but I laughed because they were definitely more outlandish than I was. Maybe they will follow my trend for short yukata next summer in Nagahama.\n\nAfter a while (and a few beers from the festival) I stopped noticing if people were looking and just enjoyed myself.\n\nPosted by kuri at 01:56 PM [view entry with 6 comments)]\n\nWeekend in Nagahama\n\nWe enjoyed a summer get-away at Lake Biwa this weekend. I randomly selected a destination - Nagahama in Shiga-ken - from one of the travel websites and it turned out to be a great place to visit.\n\nThe town was bustling with tourism and activities, but not in the usual Japanese \"100 omiyage shops in a row\" way. This town was full of historical buildings and artisans' ateliers. There is an active hive of glass artists who have decorated part of the town with stained glass lights and kaleidoscopes. Shops around Kurokabe square sell wares ranging from lampwork beads to mouth-blown bowls and just about everything in between. I especially liked the etched constellation glasses, but didn't buy them. We enjoyed a lesson in burnerwork at the Kurokabe Glass Workshop, and made our own swirled glass drops.\n\nThere were interesting shops all along the fully occupied shotengai - a juice bar with handwritten illustrated signs touting the benefits of each ingredient, two independent clothing designers, two shops with minerals and stones, a bookstore where a writers group was meeting, a showcase of Senen-Q where a quick burn made me feel much better, a store selling nothing but tasty bean and nut snacks, a tiny old shop full of incense, a place with beautiful umbrellas, and of course a few omiyage shops for the unimaginative visitors.\n\nNagahama has good food specialties, too: red konyaku, biwa masu (trout) fresh form the lake, saba somen, and chocolate-filled mochi all of which were quite delicious. They also have a local brewery that makes some very respectable beers including a golden ale that tasted faintly of teaberry.\n\nSaturday night was a confluence of festivals (yukata, eco, & beer) and people were out having fun. We learned how to tie some new furoshiki wraps, watched awesomely costumed dance teams going through their paces in the street, met three young American men doing a summer program at the bunraku puppet school just outside town, and ran into a bunch of long-time Kyoto gaijin who were biking around Biwako. Drank with them at the beer festival before tottering our way back to the hotel.\n\nSunday morning we took the ferry over to Chikubushima to climb the stairs to the top of the temple complex. I had my hoop with me, but there wasn't any room at the temple to use it. When we got back down to the pier, I hooped for half an hour while we waited for the ferry. I got a lot of strange looks and eventually convinced some people to share the fun - members of the band I'd danced to at the festival the night before.\n\nIt really was a refreshing weekend away. When we left Nagahama on Monday morning, it felt like we'd been gone a lot longer than two days. What a treat.\n\nPosted by kuri at 10:47 AM [view entry with 1 comments)]\n\nRainy Season's over\n\nRainy season officially ended yesterday, as the summer high pressure systems moved in 6 days earlier than average. This year tsuyu lasted from 6/10 - 7/13 and we received 233.5mm of rain in Tokyo, about 16 mm more than average. Many places had less rain than average which is bad news for rice farmers who rely on the rain for their crops.\n\nSo now we begin true summer and the thermometer is already ridiculous. It was 33 yesterday...\n\nPosted by kuri at 12:11 PM [view entry with 0 comments)]\n\nHow to Find Your Lost Phone\n\nIf you lose your mobile phone in Japan, it is quite possible that someone will find it and turn it in to the police who run a very friendly lost and found system.\n\nBut what if you've lost your phone while commuting 30km on a bicycle? This happened to one of Tod's coworkers last week. First he called the police box nearest his home. They didn't have it but they helped him compile a list of all the koban along his route so he could call each one. But after a few fruitless inquiries, he discovered that the police take the SIM card out of the phone, get its number, and report the lost phone to the mobile phone carrier.\n\nSo when you lose your phone, call your carrier. If the phone was turned in, they can tell you which police box you need to contact to get it back. What a handy thing to know.\n\nTod's colleague's phone had been found near the office in Marunouchi but was turned in at a police box in Kiba, a suburb nowhere near the office or his home. He never would have been reunited with it just by calling around to the koban on his route.\n\nPosted by kuri at 09:46 PM [view entry with 2 comments)]\n\nTeru Teru Zouzu\n\nTomorrow is Tracey & Ashley's wedding and the weather forecast is calling for rain.

We are now advised to put our plastics, rubber, styrofoam and vinyl items in with our food scraps and paper rubbish for burning. This is due to a new incinerator system that they are calling \"Thermal Recycling.\"\n\nSo little material is now Unburnable (foil, metal lids, broken pottery, broken glass) that it feels like we aren't sorting our garbage at all. The Unburnable bin used to quickly fill with plastic bags and packaging. Now it sits there waiting for us to break a lightbulb or a plate.\n\nOf course we recycle bottles, cans, PET and paper as well, so there is sorting to be done. But wow, does the Burnables bin fill up fast.\n\nPosted by kuri at 08:43 AM [view entry with 1 comments)]\n\nHappy Year of the Ox\n\nPosted by kuri at 12:00 AM [view entry with 4 comments)]\n\n10K with Tod\n\nThis was not a 10K run, but a day-long walk around town last weekend. It was probably even 11 km or a little more, but who is really counting?\n\nWe left the house to get lunch at a nice shop that sells hand-made soba. I was feeling a cold coming on, so I had the kake-soba - simple buckwheat noodles in a hot broth. It was just what I needed.\n\nThen we walked through Hongo 4-chome, up a street we hadn't visited before, towards the zoo. Hongo has been part of Tokyo for a very long time and there are all sorts of historical markers and old walls and buildings to enjoy. The street we walked was part business, part residential in that lovely mix that older parts of Tokyo often have.\n\nWe wandered along the antiques market at Shinobazu Pond at Ueno. There are always lots of weird and tempting things there. Old coins, carvings, trinkets and toys of many kinds. I am not sure that we have ever bought anything, but it is great fun to browse.\n\nAt the zoo, Tod bought an annual pass, so now he can go visit the elephants any time he likes. We got to watch the elephants lying down to be brushed clean by their keepers before walking trunk-to-tail into their house for the evening. We love the elephants.\n\nWhen the zoo closed at 5, we headed off, but we weren't sure exactly where we wanted to go. So we meandered the back streets until we saw a jazz bar called La Cuji. We stopped for a Guinness (only to help the cold, honestly) and ended up staying for more than an hour, enjoying some of the owner's 2500 jazz records and talking to Crazy Terry, a jazz lover sitting next to us at the bar. I asked the owner if he had Errol Garner's Concert by the Sea, one of my Dad's favorites. I hated it as a kid and hadn't heard it in a long time. I like it better as an adult, but I understood why I didn't like it when I was young. Anyway, I sat there thinking about Dad and the music until I cried.\n\nAfter La Cuji, we traipsed tipsily toward dinner, but found ourselves outside Asahi no Yu, a beautiful old public sento. So we had a bath - an extremely hot bath - to ward off the incipient illness we both dreaded. My lungs were happily warmed and Tod chatted with the attendant on duty who told us all about the ghost stories associated with the bath. Spooky Halloween stuff.\n\nWe arrived at our dinner destination just in time for the dance show. Zakuro is a Persian restaurant with no tables or chairs, just carpets everywhere and some boards on the floor. The Uzbekistani dance performance was highly entertaining, with everyone dragged in by the maitre'd to dance in the middle of the room. After the dancing, we were brought a stunning array of vegetarian dishes. It was more than we could eat, though we did our best. I had forgotten the delights of Zakuro; we will have to go back soon.\n\nEventually we rolled ourselves away from the feast and walked the final leg of the day, passing by two of our old houses and many happy memories of places we used to live. It was a very good 10K (plus a bit), but we did end up spending the next two days sick and sleeping. The soba, Guinness, and bathing didn't do the trick.\n\nPosted by kuri at 12:15 PM [view entry with 1 comments)]\n\nYoshiwara today and yesterday\n\nOn Halloween, Jim & I went for a spooky walk around Taito-ku to visit some of the grim old landmarks he has been researching lately. He took me to see Jokanji, the Throw-Away Temple that he wrote an essay about earlier this week. It has a beautiful cemetery full of memorials and markers that note a sordid past. We paid our respects to the 25,000 prostitutes whose bodies were left anonymously at the temple over the years.\n\nThey had been carried there across the rice paddies from Yoshiwara, the \"licensed pleasure quarters\" where so many young women lived out their lives in debt. A few became classy courtesans with rich patrons who looked after them, but most did not. Many died in natural disasters when earthquakes toppled shoddy buildings and fire ravaged the walled precinct. Others died of natural and unnatural causes, but with no families to claim them, were dumped at the temple.\n\nI wanted to see how the old pleasure quarter looks in modern day Tokyo, so we wound our way over there - not through rice paddies, but via the city's busy roads and sidewalks.\n\nI was surprised to discover that the area is still a pleasure quarter. It is no longer walled and the licensing rules have changed, no doubt, but the boundaries haven't budged. There is the same square grid of streets, 400 meters on a side, exactly as it has been for hundreds of years. A winding road still leads into the district from the main road.\n\nMost of the streets within Yoshiwara (which isn't officially called that anymore) are lined with brothels. The buildings look like love hotels: garish exteriors in the shape of castles or fantasy villas, facades of old buildings, or glittering casino lights. The difference from love hotels is in the staffing and pricing. At a love hotel, you and your partner might choose a short \"rest\" for 5,000 yen, or an overnight \"stay.\" The Yoshiwara rooms ranged from 7,000 yen to 35,000 yen and include a companion for the duration of your 100 minute visit. At most entrances a man in a suit stands watching the passersby. As we walked by one brothel, the doorman/bouncer greeted a returning customer and ushered him inside. Where the doors were open, I saw head and shoulder photographs of the girls on display.\n\nAnd in the hours between 3 and 4 pm, the girls themselves could be glimpsed coming into work. Some were simply dashing down from the dormitories nearby. One group of three girls wearing velour mini dressed chatted as they passed in the alley. Another woman arrived on foot, but was preceded by a burly, dark-suited bodyguard carrying her designer purse and a shopping bag. At a tight corner, we gave way to a taxi carrying a beautiful young woman with a long lovely legs (Jim's observation) and a look of bored scorn (what I noticed). There were several women chauffeured in white SUVs. I imagine these girls are the equivalent of the classy courtesans of years past.\n\nWe walked out of Yoshiwara the back way towards the local shrine (which is not Jokanji), stopping first to take in the monument to an old pond and the people who sought refuge there after the 1855 earthquake. At Yoshiwara jinja, we discovered an extraordinary poster of local history, with four maps comparing the district during different eras, plus statistics, photographs, drawings and so much information it was impossible to take it all in.\n\nAfter studying the poster for a quarter hour or more, we wandered out to the street to decide where to go next. We didn't need to go anywhere because history seemed to come to us. Jim has a Hiroshige woodblock titled Yoshiwara (from one of his many \"53 Tokaido stations\" series) stored in his iPod and comparing it to the street we were standing on - could it be the same place? The curve in the road certainly looks right. We were excited. But I wonder now...was this Yoshiwara a station on the Tokaido road between Tokyo and Kyoto? If so, lucky travelers (I guess).\n\nPosted by kuri at 05:56 PM [view entry with 1 comments)]\n\nWinter started yesterday\n\nAfter a rather dull autumn, winter is here.\n\nYou might not think so, since the leaves are still mostly on the trees and the daytime highs peak around 20 (68F), but there is a certain chill in the air now that wasn't present last week. Yesterday I got out of bed and my feet quickly became icy as I sat barefoot at my desk. But more telling of the change of season: all the moisture is gone from the air. From now til May, I won't go without hand cream, hair oil, and lip balm.\n\nDefinitely time to change the wardrobe to winter sweaters and warmer things.

It was a total joy to be out of Tokyo and in beautiful, rural Japan.\n\nThis was our second time to pay our respects at Kompira-gu. We last visited in August 1999, well before we could converse with people. Being able to chat made the trip much more enjoyable.\n\nHooping at Kompira Temple\n\nI took my hula hoop with me (of course) and hooped at the temple at the top of the mountain (1368 steps up!) The hoop initiated a lot of conversations, especially with elderly shopkeepers who all wanted a demonstration and with younger citizens and pilgrims who all had a try. The hoop spreads its love anytime it comes out to play.\n\nAfter coming back down the mountain, we went to Nakano Udon Gakko to learn to make my favorite thick, chewy, wheat noodles. We learned two clever techniques and documented them.\n\nKneading Udon Dough\n\nRolling and Cutting Udon\n\nWe stayed at a lovely hotel with nice baths (to soak our aching legs after all those stairs), an evening enka show/bingo game, and a chef who had no trouble accommodating my vegetarian diet. For two days we feasted on seasonal vegetables in every form imaginable: tempura, salads, pickles, soup, grilled, fried, and simmered. He even made vegetable sushi for us. Vegetarians traveling in Shikoku, I recommend booking a room at Kotosankaku. I am sure it is equally great for omnivores. :-)\n\nIf you want to see a very long, unedited view from our train crossing over the Seto Inland see, I made a video of the Seto Ohashi Crossing.\n\nPosted by kuri at 06:54 AM [view entry with 3 comments)]\n\nCurry Bath\n\nBandai has been developing bath products based on popular snacks for a few years now - bath salts in the shape and scents of Lotte gums, GariGari ice cream bars, and so on. But starting October 14th they will be selling a new one worth noting:\n\nCurry flavored bath salts! Bandai claims \"Even if you hate bathing now you will like it for sure with this product!\"\n\nThey come in three levels of spiciness: Mild, Medium or Hot, and each contains chili pepper extract to warm your skin. The hot version is 20 times hotter than the mild one; medium clocks in at 5 times hotter than mild. Mild is enriched with honey and apples. If you prefer no chili at all in your bath, try the Cream Stew variety which is a soothing milk bath. I'm surprised they didn't make that one a lassi flavor.\n\nIf curry scented bath water weren't enticement enough, each package comes with a curry-related toy. If you collect all 12 of them, you will be able to cook and serve a tiny curry meal with miniature pots, dishes and utensils.

Japan will introduce \"lay judges\" to judicial system in May 2009.\n\nI was one of five American mock jurors. Most of us were long-term Japan residents and none of us had ever been on a jury before. We all agreed that this felt like discharging our civic duty and took it seriously.\n\nIt was hard work! The event, with an audience of about 300 lawyers and law students, lasted 5 hours. There were two witnesses on each side and each was examined and cross examined about various letters, contracts, e-mails and internal business communications. The witnesses/actors and lawyers were prepared, but nothing was scripted. Paying attention to two eminent and persuasive trial lawyers (William Price and John Quinn from Quinn Emmanuel) both going full-on at one another while trying to keep the facts straight and the point of the lawsuit in mind was boggling.\n\nDuring witness questioning, they highlighted sections of documents and enlarged them so that the rest of the page was obscured. What was the full context around the highlighted text? Sometimes the same document came up again and further detail could be gleaned with quick reading. But wow... There were a dozen key pages and I never managed to read one all the way through.\n\nIn addition soaking in details about the case, I was also meta-thinking about the trial system and the changes it will being to Japan's legal process. At the same time, I was noting how the personalities of the two lawyers affected the way I thought about their points. Mr. Price was very strict - he aggressively pushed semantic arguments and made lots of objections. Mr. Quinn was more personable; he engaged the witnesses gently and his questions usually aimed to help the jury understand the more difficult points. They both were able to sway my mind when they spoke.\n\nBy the time the closing arguments rolled around, I had completely forgotten what the opening ones were. I had formed an opinion, though, which I verified through my scribbled notes. The judge read us our instructions, a list of \"If you think A, then B must be false. If you think C, then you also must believe D, E & F are true.\" It was very complicated and not written down. I hope that is different in real life.\n\nWe deliberated in the open, so that the audience could hear what a jury thinks. There were actually two juries - the Americans and another panel of five Japanese jurors. We deliberated separately and although we reached exactly the same conclusion, our methods were different. The Americans each briefly stated their view, \"I'd find for the plaintiff because Y\", then we discussed our differences of opinion. \"You say X but did you consider Y? Because X seems to be an emotional argument, rather than law.\" Then we voted. The Japanese jurors each gave longer more detailed (it seemed) opinions, then they voted. No discussions. But that might have been a factor of time limitations.\n\nIt was a fascinating experience. But I am very glad this was only a mock trial and not a real one.\n\nPosted by kuri at 10:46 AM [view entry with 0 comments)]\n\nWeather Service SNS\n\nI am not quite sure why they've done this, but I am amused.

After he was beheaded for having misstepped in politics and family life, his head was brought to the fishing village that would later become Tokyo. Masakado's spirit and his head in a wooden bucket were enshrined on a little hill overlooking Tokyo Bay. The hill is located in what is now Otemachi, the heart of Tokyo's financial district. Tod passes by on his bike almost every day.\n\nMasakado is as powerful in death as he wanted to be in life. When his shrine is neglected or falls into disrepair, bad things seem to happen - businesses fail, natural disasters occur. Plans have been made to move him, but they are always canceled. People fear his spirit so much that the buildings around \"The Hill of Masakado's Head\" do not have windows opening towards it. In the surrounding offices, desks are oriented to face towards the shrine. In Tod's office the corporate services people have verified this and if you are unlucky enough to get a rare desk with your back to Masakado, they will give you a special amulet to attach to your chair to ward off any evil.\n\nShortly after Tod dug into this old legend, bad things began to happen to him. Someone ran into the street without looking just as Tod whizzed by on his bike. Both men went down, but only Tod was injured. It was quite dramatic as blood coursed down his arm while I patched him up at the convenience store.\n\nHe was halfway healed when he tumbled off his bike again. This second accident left him with another big scrape on his arm and a bruised imprint of the road the size of a dinner plate along his thigh.\n\nWhen he mentioned these incidents to his Japanese teacher at class the next week, she was well aware of Masakado and his abilities. She urged Tod go to a temple and get himself a yakuyoke charm and an exorcism. He paid his respects at Masakado's shrine, and made a visit to our local temple for a more formal and powerful cleansing.\n\nSince he bought his evil repellent charm and hung it on the bicycle, he's been safe. I hope that Masakado leaves him alone now and that telling this tale isn't going to get me into trouble.\n\nPosted by kuri at 05:52 PM [view entry with 0 comments)]\n\nEnoshima Aquarium\n\nMJ arranged an outing to Enoshima for Tracey's parents to meet Elliot Mason. We spent most of the day at the Aquarium, where Barbara took charge of the baby, Jim pushed the pram, Tracey figured out the show schedules, MJ shot still photos and I took a bit of video.\n\nPosted by kuri at 10:15 PM [view entry with 3 comments)]\n\nMagical Mushrooms\n\nOn Saturday, Tod & I went off to the edge of Tokyo to explore around one of the city reservoirs, Tamako. We wandered through a forested park and saw a surprising variety of mushrooms: the green one pictured above, a patch of bright red ones, a few shaped like snowmen, purple ones, orange ones, yellow ones, globular ones, and one as big as a dinner plate. They were delightful.\n\nThe rest of the exploration was mainly along 7km of long paved cycling route that runs around the reservoir. The lake itself is mostly drained as they shore up the dam, so that was a bit disappointing. Despite that, we observed nature on the boundary of the cycling road and the forest and had a good afternoon's walk.\n\nPosted by kuri at 03:39 PM [view entry with 1 comments)]\n\nPremium grapes\n\nNews is making the rounds about the bunch of Ruby Roman grapes sold at auction for $910. Many stories quote the price, but fail to explain why they fetched that amount.\n\nIt's really nothing to do with the quality of the grapes, though I am sure they are wonderful. It is partially to do with the novelty of them - Ruby Roman grapes are a brand new variety that has been under development for the past 14 years. But mainly the selling price of the grapes goes to two factors: promotion and marketing.\n\nThe man who purchased the grapes is an upscale hotelier whose property, Kagaya in Ishakawa, charges up to $800 per person per night and is located nearby the grape growers. He paid a lot for the privilege of promoting the local product and wishing the growers luck and success, but in exchange, he made headlines and the evening news (and a few blogs, too)\n\n$910 might be a lot for a bunch of grapes, but it is darn cheap nationwide (and international) advertising.\n\nPosted by kuri at 07:34 PM [view entry with 1 comments)]\n\nHa ããå «\n\nPosted by kuri at 11:55 AM [view entry with 1 comments)]\n\nCloudburst\n\nSince noon, Tokyo's received 108mm of rainfall, 73% of August's average, and experienced a series of intense thunderstorms. It feels as though the city is going to be washed away.\n\nAs the first storm began this morning, I decided to pull up a chair on the verandah and watch it. The lightning bolts behind my building reflected off the glass covered Toppan highrise across the way. Thunder echoed and rumbled and drew louder and nearer. Low yellow-grey clouds trailed scarves of rain in the middle distance. It was beautiful and awesome. Then I watched a bolt hit a lightning rod on a building nearby and scurried inside as the clouds opened up over me.\n\nNot everyone was able to find shelter. Five sewer workers were washed down a manhole earlier today. One has turned up in the Kanda River about 3 km from where he started. I heard the rescue sirens and helicopters a few blocks from here. He didn't live. The other four are still missing.\n\nPosted by kuri at 05:02 PM [view entry with 0 comments)]\n\nSummer Baseball\n\nTod settles into the game as the sun sets on Jingu Stadium.\n\nThe home team, the Tokyo Yakult Swallows, had a cheering section right behind us. They are chanting to encourage Aoki at bat, but in the end, he strikes out.\n\nThey were enthusiastic and hopeful, but in the slowly unfolding contest (here you can see that it's bottom of the 5th and almost 2 hours into the game), their team were behind most of the time. We left at 8:30 for dinner, and just missed a tremendous thunderstorm that halted the game in the 8th inning.\n\nBefore the rain started, the Hanshin Tigers' fans had a trick up their sleeve.\n\nPosted by kuri at 04:47 PM [view entry with 0 comments)]\n\nSlippery Eels\n\nI stepped off the plane to a morning that felt like swimming in my own blood. The air in the city smells vaguely of chlorine like walking into the lobby of an indoor pool. I ought to enjoy it because I know it won't be long before I catch a whiff of the stinky sewers.\n\nThe heat and humidity really knocked me out after Adelaide's winter chilliness, so at lunch Tod took me out for eel to increase our summer stamina. Today is åç¨ä¸ã®æ¥ (one of two this year), considered to be the height of summer. Fatty grilled eel fends off summer blah and weight loss, though the tradition of eating it on this day started as a marketing gimmick 200 years ago.\n\nDespite the dreadful weather, I am happy to be back in the city and at home.\n\nPosted by kuri at 11:24 PM [view entry with 0 comments)]\n\nLegitimize your Presence\n\nTwice a week, I walk to my Japanese lesson through busy lunchtime crowds and I've been people watching as I go. It is interesting that about 75% of the people I pass along the way are wearing ID/security badges on straps around their necks. Those cards are truly ubiquitous nowadays.\n\nI've been playing a game with the other 25% of the people on the street. If you hung a security card around their necks, how does my perception of them change? The guy in the black jeans and funky styled hair goes from \"college student\" to \"designer.\" Anyone moderately well dressed turns into an office worker if they have an ID badge.\n\nEven unlikely prospects can become legitimate with an ID badge. The old lady with the cane tottering down the sidewalk is professor or a volunteer of some sort. The woman with the toddler is a flex-time worker on a day-care run. The multi-pierced goth chick now works at the record store.\n\nWhat if as a tourist you wore a security card as a disguise? The perception of people passing you on the street would change. Not a tourist anymore, you become one of the crowd.\n\nIf you don't have an actual ID card from your current or former job, you can easily fake one. Since you aren't going to try to enter a building with it, nobody is going to look too closely, so make it neat but don't worry about being perfect. Use a computer, cut and paste, or draw the elements by hand.\n\n1) Buy a strap and card holder. I've seen them in the 100 yen shops here; I'm sure any office supply store would have them.\n\n2) The ID side of the card should include an image of you or someone else and a name printed underneath. It needs a company or building name and logo. It may have a decorative element like a colored stripe or a subtly patterned background. A barcode orreally long ID number is a nice touch.\n\n3) On the back side of the card, make a fake magnetic strip. A 1/2\" stripe in black pen will work fine. Add some tiny text as a disclaimer or \"if found return to\" section.\n\n4) Put the card in the holder and test your new identity.\n\nPosted by kuri at 05:39 PM [view entry with 1 comments)]\n\n3 Views of Ueno Skyline\n\nThe weather was terrific today, so I walked to Ueno with my sketch box and did a bit of drawing.\n\nThe Ueno skyline in pencil and watercolor\n\nI am not a very good watercolorist and so I decided to take a photo to work from later. Maybe make some improvements to the piece later on at home....\n\nThe skyline, photographed for reference\n\nAs it turns out, I did not too badly. My lines are not straight, but they never are. The perspective is off a bit, but overall, the painting is recognizable as that place.\n\nBut then I decided to play with the photo. I printed out a copy and used an oil pen to practice drawing the buildings in proper perspective and slightly straighter.\n\nDrawing on photo\n\nI like how the details and atmosphere of the three images differ, even though they are all the same place and time.\n\nPosted by kuri at 05:40 PM [view entry with 6 comments)]\n\nVegesh\n\nVegesh is pronounced \"veggie shu\"\n\nMeet Vegesh, a collaboration between brewer Asahi and vegetable/juice company Kagome. Yes, you guessed it, this is boozy juice. It is a \"Vegetable and Fruit Sparkling Cocktail\"\n\nWith 21 vegetables and 5 fruits in the juice mix, it tastes surprisingly like...juice. Juice with fizz and a kick, but almost healthy. Definitely better than the too sweet, artificially flavored chu-hi sparkling cocktails that are popular every summer.\n\nThe vegetables included are (in order from the label): carrot, spinach, asparagus, red pepper, komatsuna, cress, pumpkin, cabbage, broccoli, another kind of cabbage, beet, red shiso, celery, lettuce, chinese cabbage, kale, parsley, eggplant, onion, daikon radish, and a third sort of cabbage. The fruits are not the apple and grape juice that you might expect, but grapefruit, lemon, pineapple, banana and pear.\n\nOverall it has a tangy-sweet grapefruit and carrot flavor, but there are touches of everything present if you taste carefully.\n\nI bought it as a lark, but Vegesh is a lot better than I expected. I would drink it again. Unfortunately, it is way too easy to swig down like a big glass of juice, instead of the beer-strength cocktail that it is so I will have to be careful!\n\nPosted by kuri at 06:13 PM [view entry with 2 comments)]\n\nDream House for Sale\n\nWay back during one of our many house hunting periods, we saw a lovely old Japanese house in Taito-ku near Ueno Zoo. It had tatami rooms over looking a garden, a cedar lined bath, a sun room, and a total of 7 bedrooms. It was big and drafty and I fell in love with it the moment I walked inside.\n\nWe were all set to rent it, but the owner's mother disagreed. She didn't like foreigners and didn't want her son to approve us. So we didn't get the place. It was very disappointing, but how can you argue against an old woman's prejudices? We kept looking.\n\nYesterday I discovered that it is on the market. All 7 bedrooms, the garden, the bath and everything for 15,680ä¸å, or about 1.5 million US dollars. The house is around 160 sq meters (1725 sq/ft) on 172 square meters (0.04 acres) of land.\n\nThat's way over our budget, so I am destined to be disappointed once again. But seeing the floor plan flooded me with memories and for a few moments I daydreamed about living there. I could run a B&B. I could host an artist's colony. I could sit in the tatami rooms and gaze at my garden. Maybe someday, somewhere.\n\nPosted by kuri at 07:58 AM [view entry with 1 comments)]\n\nKasuga to Harajuku walk\n\nI am trying to make the most of the good weather between the rainy days in this early part of rainy season by getting out and walking. I know it will soon be more sodden and a lot hotter and I won't want to be moving around so much. So two of the last three days I have walked from home to Harajuku. It's about 90 minutes and just under 8 km.\n\nThe first 15 minutes from home to Iidabashi is a walk I make at least twice a week. It takes me though a formerly quaint neighborhood that has been ravaged by an 8 lane highway and a building project that ate an entire five blocks of housing. The building will be the tallest on in Bunkyo-ku and will block the view of Mt Fuji from the ward office. I am not a fan.\n\nAt Iidabashi, I walk along the Outer Moat down past Ichigaya Station to Yotsuya. If I walk on the canal side, with a view of the Chuo and Sobu lines across the canal, I am in Chiyoda-ku. If I walk on the building side of the street, I am in Shinjuku-ku. I prefer the tree-lined canal side as there aren't so many pedestrians so I can walk fast, and I like the shade. But sometimes it is too buggy over there and I walk on the building side of the street. I also have the option of crossing the canal and walking along a shady park path most of the way to Yotsuya. I usually don't do this unless I am with Tod.\n\nAt Yotsuya, I take the right fork towards the Akasaka Detached Palace. It is currently all covered in scaffolding and cloths, but usually the view of the palace through the black and gilt iron fence is quite regal. It's only a glimpse as I walk past and then I am on a green borderland. There is a stone wall and grassy embankment punctuated with guards posted at the palace gates, and various parks and planted buildings on the other side. The stretch of the road is a big dip so I get to walk downhill part of the way, then back uphill.\n\nAt the top of the hill, I am at the side of Jingu Gyoen. Although I'd like to be able to walk straight across the grassy park, I can't. I have to follow the road. The straightaway leading to Aoyama Itchome is lined with tall ginkgo trees. It's beautifully formal and upright.\n\nIt's quite a jolt to torn the corner onto Aoyama Dori. I'm back in the land of shopping and offices. From there, the route is new to me. The first day I walked it, I went straight down to Omotesando, then up to Harajuku. The route took me past all the insanely high-end shopping places and designer boutiques. The second time I walked this, I turned at Bell Commons and tried to thread my way through the back streets. But I didn't have a map, only a mental picture and I got lost! Not so lost that I missed my destination, but I was momentarily turned around and confused. Then I spied a streetside map and headed off in the right direction.\n\nPosted by kuri at 09:31 AM [view entry with 3 comments)]\n\nKasuga to Otemachi walk\n\nYesterday I walked from home to Otemachi to meet Tod for lunch. I've done this many times and it is a lovely little stroll through diverse neighborhoods. Let me describe them to you.\n\nThe main street in Kasuga is Kasuga Dori, a busy four lane road. It was a pilgrim route to Kawagoe and it still leads there. Once I tried to walk there. Yesterday I turned my back on Kawagoe and headed down to Korakuen station and Tokyo Dome.\n\nWithin ten minutes of leaving my apartment, I reached a bright and cheery entertainment and shopping area. Tokyo Dome itself hosts baseball games and concerts. It is flanked by LaQua, a shopping mall with a hot spring, roller coaster, and Ferris wheel on its roof. On the other end of the Dome, Meets Port has an event hall and many restaurants. \"Tokyo Dome City\" is a man-made, marketed, commercial destination. I walked through it as quickly as I could.\n\nAt the end of Tokyo Dome City is the Suidobashi JR station and the more down-to-earth Jimbocho neighborhood. Jimbocho is famous for used books and sporting equipment. The buildings are a mix of low tenements and 20 year old highrises, but all of them have street front shops. It seems like about a third of them are bookstores, but there are all sorts of things to buy and great places to eat at reasonable prices, too. I like Jimbocho; it is a human-scaled place in a city that is sometimes overwhelmingly glittery or depressingly sterile.\n\nBut it doesn't take long to walk through Jimbocho and after skirting around some slow moving office ladies out for lunch, I turned east onto Kanda Keisatsu Dori. This strip is a broad street with bigger, taller buildings: a couple of schools, some minor corporate headquarters and the Kanda police station that names the street. Even though the buildings are blockier and larger than the ones in Jimbocho, the street feels sort of cozy. There are sculptures near several of the buildings and the cross streets are one-way. The street makes a good transition between Jimbocho and Otemachi.\n\nTurning off Keisatsu Dori and crossing over the Kanda River (or is it the Nihombashi River at that point?) I reached Otemachi. This is where a lot of banking and business take place. Every building is a skyscraping office tower with a granite courtyard or a marble entranceway punctuated with a tree or two. It is modern and imposing and quite dull. I'm glad I don't work there anymore, but I am always happy to visit Tod for lunch.\n\nPosted by kuri at 12:45 PM [view entry with 5 comments)]\n\nThat funny smell again\n\nLast year in mid-May, I wrote about a strange smell in the air that none of us quite agreed about.

Rainy season started in Okinawa and it won't be long before its here. Summer is certainly on its way. Bummer.\n\nPosted by kuri at 08:39 AM [view entry with 2 comments)]\n\nHypocritical US Food Safety\n\nBecause of the tainted pet food fiasco and other issues with foods imported from China last year, China has recently agreed to follow the higher food safety standards of the US in several categories including pet food, fish, low-acid canned goods, and raw materials like wheat gluten.\n\nThis makes sense, right? Imported goods should follow the safety standards of the nation they are being brought into. Americans shouldn't have to worry about eating substandard food. Or buying harmful things from other nations. Nobody should.\n\nSo why does the US keep insisting that Japan lower its standards and import American beef that isn't acceptable here? In Japan all cows, 100% of them, are tested for BSE (mad cow disease). In America, not even 1% of cows are tested. Even if you want to test all your American cows, you can't. It is illegal.\n\nThis really annoys me. How dare the US insist that exporting countries following their standards, yet also insist that importing countries abandon any stricter standards. You can't have it both ways. That is hypocritical.\n\nBarak Obama lost any chance at my vote today when I read he told ranchers that Japan should lower its standards:\n\n\"You can't get beef into Japan and Korea, even though, obviously, we have the highest safety standards of anybody,\" he told a town hall meeting in Watertown, South Dakota. \"They don't want to have that competition from U.S. producers.\"\n\n\"Highest safety standards?\" Helloooooo? Test all your cows and you can export as much as you like to Japan. \"Don't want competition?\" No. Don't want disease. Honestly, Mr. Obama, get your facts straight here. You are wrong.\n\nThe US really makes my blood boil sometimes (lots of times). Do you know that they force Japan to buy rice it doesn't need? That's another post in itself. Maybe tomorrow.\n\nPosted by kuri at 02:53 PM [view entry with 6 comments)]\n\nStill morning\n\nThe city is so quiet this morning that I can hear wind through trees and chirping birds across the way. Everyone is still asleep. The highway is silent. The local roads are still. It even seems like the trains are rushing past less frequently.\n\nPost-holiday exhaustion? People must be resting after their golden week blow out. I'm sure it won't be too long before everything and everyone starts moving again so I will go outside and savor these few last quiet minutes.\n\nPosted by kuri at 06:17 AM [view entry with 0 comments)]\n\nFrom Camp\n\nTod says Niijima is a magical place and I think he is right. There were so many happy coincidences there this past week.\n\nOn the first day, Tod ran into some of his colleagues from UBS. They had sailed down from Tokyo and offered to take us sailing one day. Eight of us had a wonderful morning sail out into the ocean with Jason and Neil. They put us to work pulling lines and hoisting sheets, which was beyond fun.\n\nOn the last day, a convergence of stories brought two friends together. Our taxi driver had told Tod the day before about a guy who got off the boat mistakenly; he had no cash, his friend had the tent and all the gear and he had no idea what to do. The taxi driver gave him a room for the night. The next morning, a guy in our camp is talking to Tod about losing track of his friend on the boat. Voila! Two plus two = friends reunited.\n\nAnd in between those connections we had an outing with the entire local elementary school, an arts and crafts day in my tent with drawing and jewelry-making during a rainstorm, we tried our hand at blowing glass, and experienced the usual Niijima combination of beautiful weather, great food, socialising with new friends around the camp, and friendly interactions with all the locals.\n\nGoing to Niijima is always a treat. Thanks to everyone who came along with us. Let's do it again soon.\n\nPosted by kuri at 10:43 AM [view entry with 1 comments)]\n\nTokyo population rises again\n\nAs of the last census in October, Tokyo is home to 10% of the nation's population. 91,000 more people came to live in Tokyo during 2007. So if the trains seem more crowded, that's why.\n\nThis is the highest percentage it's been since 1979. The highest ever was 11.1% in the late 1960s.\n\nJapan's shifting population is interesting. 37 rural prefectures lost population last year. People over 75 outnumber people under 14 in a half dozen prefectures. Deaths outnumbered births by 2,000 nationwide. What will the next census tell us?\n\nPosted by kuri at 10:17 AM [view entry with 1 comments)]\n\nAsakusabashi Bead Town\n\nSome new members of my bead stash\n\nIf you want to buy beads in Tokyo, you must go to Asakusabashi. It's one stop east of Akihabara on the Sobu line. Where Akiba is all bright lights and electronics and men, Asakusabashi is low key shops with a decidedly feminine clientÃ¨le. There are dozens of shops, each one with a slightly different focus or catering to a different demographic: the older ladies, the kids, the fashionable hobbyists, the skilled bead masters. I encountered them all today.\n\nHere is a shop list and map to guide you and here are highlights at the shops I visited this afternoon:\n\nChoice specialises in stone beads. They have a very good selection at reasonable prices. There were some gemstones there I had never seen as beads before. It's all neatly arranged in row after row of racks by color.\n\nWest 5 seems to be the mecca of Toho beads and findings. They had some good sale items outside the shop (lots of shops had cheap beads out front).\n\nCraft Family Hint has a large selection of buttons and ribbon trims as well as beads. I will definitely come back here for the ribbons - everyting from velvet to leather and all sorts of fringes, lace and embroidered ribbons, too.\n\nBeads Shop J4 has a special section of Japanese style beads and parts. They also offer a 12-class lampwork bead course. The store feels a bit like an atelier with workspaces tucked into corners and behind screens. Upstairs they have an enormous amount of acrylic beads on strings.\n\nAccessory Hyotanya focuses on \"deco\" parts. They have lots of shaped pins and brooches that you can glue rhinestones to. Of course they have rhinestones and glue, too. They also sell some beads.\n\nParts Club has lots of parts, or as we call them in English, findings. All the shops have them, but Parts Club is nicely organised. And very large. They also have scads of beads and tools.\n\nKiwa got most of my business today. They had the nickel silver wire I was looking for, the nippers I needed, and a good selection of cords, too. And do I need to say they have a lot of beads? They do. And nice ones but oddly enough, I didn't buy beads there.\n\nIn four hours, I hardly scratched the surface of Asakusabashi's bead shops. I didn't even make it to Beads Factory, which is Miyuki Glass Beads's showcase. Fortunately, Asakusabashi is within walking distance of home, or a few stops on the train, so I can go any time.\n\nMust stop posting and start beading now.\n\nPosted by kuri at 04:59 PM [view entry with 3 comments)]\n\nAmbulances & Emergencies\n\nA few months back there were several news reports about ambulances in Osaka having so much trouble finding an ER to take their patients that the patients died before seeing a doctor. This week a survey by the Fire and Disaster Management Agency reported that nationwide in 2007, 24,089 ambulance patients were rejected by hospitals more than three times before being admitted somewhere. In 2006, a different agency reported only 667 such cases.\n\nThat is not good. But why is this happening and how can it be resolved?\n\nPartly because hospitals are facing budget and staff crises and closing or cutting back their ER facilities. That seems to be a perennial, or perhaps cyclical, problem with hospitals.\n\nPartly because hospitals rotate ER days. Not all ERs are open 24/7/365. The ambulances know the schedule and call ahead to confirm that there is a bed for the patient. If one ER is busy, or doesn't have the right kind of doctor on staff, they reject the request.\n\nPartly because many ambulance crews are not trained in medicine. Some have training beyond basic first aid, but it is not a requirement.\n\nSo how can this problem be fixed? From my armchair vantage point, I see a few obvious things that would improve the situation right away:\n\nStaff paramedics and other medically trained people in the ambulances. This would give the patient timely triage and accurate reporting of the situation to the hospital.\n\nMore hospitals on rotation in the ER schedule. This is a challenge due to budgets and staffing, but it is certainly the most immediate fix. No more ER holidays.\n\nEstablish local \"urgent care\" centers for non-traumatic emergencies, like earaches and food poisoning. Right now, you have to find an off-hours clinic or go to the ER (in an ambulance). This would free up the hospitals to handle trauma and more complicated issues.\n\nI am sure that people in power are thinking along these lines, and in Osaka earlier this year, this issue was at the heart of the gubernatorial campaign.. I just hope it gets fixed before I need to go to the hospital in a rush.\n\nPosted by kuri at 12:05 PM [view entry with 4 comments)]\n\nEco Future Fund video\n\nOne of the charities that we raised money for at the Australia Day Gala Ball is Eco Future Fund. They do reforestation and forest maintenance projects in Japan, and also run forestation and wood-alternative projects overseas.\n\nTo help sell their mission, I created a short video that we played on the big screens on the night of the ball. I'm sure nobody actually watched it - I only caught a glimpse of it from the back of the room as I was running an errand - and that might be OK. It was a challenge to put it together in the free moments between my other work and I didn't have much material to use. But since I recruited MJ to narrate and wracked my brains to tell a positive story about how our auction earnings would be spent, thought I would put the finished piece on YouTube. Maybe someone else will see it and get involved.\n\nOther videos from the ball are online, too, in my YouTube area\n\nPosted by kuri at 01:21 PM [view entry with 1 comments)]\n\nShuzenji Onsen, Shizuoka\n\nI love making little weekend trips to places in Japan. Every town has its charms and I am rarely disappointed, even when we choose at random. I wish I would remember this more often and make an effort to explore more of the country.\n\nThis weekend, I whisked Tod away for a Valentine weekend of \"athletics and adventure.\" We went to Shuzenji, a 1200 year old onsen town in the middle of Izu. On the outskirts of the city is the Cycle Sports Center, a weird pedal-powered amusement park that also has several real biking courses. Tod had a great time; I fell off my bicycle on the 5K course. The wheeled things have it in for me. I bruised my knee and my ego, but no permanent harm was done.\n\nI had a great time in the giant maze, though, and loved the \"Interesting Bicycles\" course where we tried out hand-pedaled bikes, an old fashioned big-wheel-in-front cycle, a sideways bicycle for two and a bunch of other novelties. The pedaled roller coasters and other rides were a kick, too.\n\nWe stayed at an Indonesian themed hotel called Yutorian. In addition to a lovely (but very chilly) rotenburo and the usual indoor bath, it has a mixed sex bath that is built in a natural cave. The story of the cave is an interesting one. One day in the late 80s, the owner of the hotel picked up a drill and started digging. After two years of daily drilling wit his family scoffing at him for being nuts, he broke through into the cave. He didn't know he would. I wonder what possessed him to start drilling the mountain outside his hotel?\n\nAfter a dinner that featured too many scallops for my liking, Tod & I went out to look at the stars. With the advice of the hotel staff we had scoped out a really dark spot in the middle of a field near the elementary school. I wanted to give my Christmas toy, the Celestron SkyScout, its first real outing. It was freezing cold and the half moon was so bright it cast shadows, but we had a good time pointing the SkyScout at things and asking it to tell us what they were. Until my fingers were too numb to work the buttons, we also located the various planets (most of which were on the other side of the earth) and stars whose names we remembered.\n\nToday we explored the onsen town, climbing the mountain to the ume forest-park at the top and enjoying a plum blossom festival, then descending to visit Shuzenji temple where I made my hatsumode (a little later than usual) and got a daikichi (big luck) fortune that tells me I will get ahead in the world. We stuck our feet in the legendary Dokko no Yu, climbed the tourist association's little tower, and just enjoyed wandering the village and seeing the sights.\n\nAt a shop near the train station, I scored a new teapot to replace the one we broke last year. The shopkeepers were wonderfully careful - unwrapping the brand-new pot and ringing the ceramic to make sure it was intact, then heating the rubber pour spout in hot water and adjusting the fit before running around to find a box for it. While we waited and watched the ceremony of the teapot preparations, I noticed that the couple's painted portrait hung above the door to the stockroom. Perhaps an anniversary gift... it was sweet.\n\nAll in all, we enjoyed a great weekend break from the big city.\n\nPosted by kuri at 07:18 PM [view entry with 0 comments)]\n\nIKEA\n\nYesterday I went to IKEA to help buy table decorations for the Ball.\n\nAlthough it's been more than a decade since I last shopped there (and that was in the US, not Japan), IKEA hasn't changed a bit. The strangely named products, the large displays in the meandering showroom leading to the easy impulse purchases of the Marketplace were as familiar as if it were 1991 and Tod & I were shopping for a kitchen table.\n\nAs Anna and I wove our way towards vases and dried foliage, I delivered a monologue to her 8 month old son. \"Look how happy everyone here is. They are having the best time of their lives; forgetting their cares by buying bright shiny things made by people with worse lives than their own. Someday, you might grow up to be one of these happy people. Isn't that great?\"\n\nI made him giggle and I don't know how much Nicholas understood, but the lecture worked for me; I escaped with only a potted plant (for my office) and some cookies (for my lunch).\n\nPosted by kuri at 08:32 AM [view entry with 0 comments)]\n\nRequired Japanese\n\nForeign Minister Masahiko Komura is considering making Japanese ability a requirement for long-term gaijin. Of course the ministry haven't said what level of proficiency would be needed, who would be required to prove their language levels, or how and when any of this might be implemented.\n\nWith my still limited Japanese, this strikes a certain amount of terror in my heart.\n\nBut like all of Japan's rules and regulations, it will be approached with a certain amount of flexibility and \"spirit of the law\" that will be in the hands of each bureaucrat. So ããã°ãã¾ãããï¼\n\nPosted by kuri at 11:16 AM [view entry with 1 comments)]\n\nJapan's unnatural resources\n\nJapan has a shocking amount of the world's precious and rare metals tied up in electronics, appliances and other consumer goods. Tokyo is an \"urban mine.\"\n\nA study by Komei Harada at the National Institute for Materials Science has uncovered that Japan has more gold than South Africa's reserves - 6,800 tons of gold, 16% of the world's reserves - and it's all in manufactured products that are likely to be discarded sooner or later.\n\nIt's not just gold. We have 22% of the world's natural reserves of silver, 8% of the world's copper reserves and a whopping 61% of indium, which is used for LCD displays. We've also got 5.6 million tons of lead, 38 million tons of copper and 1.2 billion tons of steel in small quantities scattered through out every household in the nation.\n\nFor example, according to an article in the Nikkei last week, \"Each mobile phone handset contains 3-4 grams of copper, 0.1 gram of silver and 0.01 gram of gold, and with Japan now having 100 million cell phones in use...\" Small bits here and there add up to a lot of useful materials.\n\nHow does one mine the metals after they are consumed? There are recycling programs for electronics here, but I don't know exactly what they extract. There's a 2005 report on the DTI Mission focused on electronics recycling in Japan, but it doesn't give many details.\n\nIt seems that there's a market for these metals, so it would be wasteful not to mine them. I want to do some digging and learn more..\n\nPosted by kuri at 10:51 AM [view entry with 1 comments)]\n\nThe ridiculous price of costume jewelry\n\nI escaped my duties today to shop a few hours for a necklace to go with my gown for the Australia Day Gala Ball (tickets still available, but not for long!). Yuka accompanied me as my guiding star but even with her help, I am a very poor consumer.\n\nAfter abandoning our first plan, we found a few options at one of the jewelry counters at Takashimaya in Shinjuku. I tried on at least six different necklaces, fell in love with one in purple and green (I *must* buy a green dress for the next event) and had good feelings about several black rhinestone pieces.\n\nUntil I turned over the price tags: 32,000 yen. 37,500 yen. 40,000 yen? This is glass. Pot metal. Plastic.\n\nNo way am I paying $400 for a piece of jewelry I'll wear only two or three times, no maker how nice it looks.\n\nI must find the $50 -100 jewels. I know they have to be out there, somewhere.\n\nPosted by kuri at 09:39 PM [view entry with 1 comments)]\n\nHappy 2008\n\nBest wishes for a prosperous and interesting year.\n\nPosted by kuri at 01:24 PM [view entry with 3 comments)]\n\nTod's Bad Christmas Joke\n\nIn Japan, Buddhists don't eat Christmas cookies, but Shintos love them.

What a contrast to the train I'd transfered from. On the Women Only car this morning:\n\nNobody was sneezing or sniffling and I heard only one muffled cough.\n\nEveryone in the car was awake and alert.\n\nThe women who were speaking (quietly) near me were talking about kittens.\n\nNo one had their newspaper or book spreading into another rider's limited space.\n\nI think I like the Women Only car.\n\nPosted by kuri at 10:22 AM [view entry with 0 comments)]\n\nAustralia Day Gala Ball 2008\n\nImagine the ochre red of desert sand dotted with grey-green gums and lit by a starry sky.

There are plenty of tutorials around on the 'net, (see EtsyLabs or Craftster or this video on YouTube for a start) but you really have to try it yourself to discover what works. I tested out three different kinds of plastic today.\n\nãã©PE - Polyethylene. Fusing point: 70 - 110°C. Unlike in the US, this doesn't seem to be divided into HD and LD types. It's all marked \"PE\" even though it is, of course high and low density plastic. Grocery bags are LDPE and should fuse at about 70- 90°C.\n\nMy High-Medium-Low iron's lowest setting must be well above 90°C because the PE started to shrink quickly almost as soon as I touched the iron to the layers of plastic and waxed paper.\n\nWrinkles in the fused PE indicate too much heat.\n\nSix layers of this heavier smooth LDPE bag worked better but I still wrinkled it .\n\nAnother wrinkly PE attempt, but this time oversewn as a test swatch.\n\nãã©1 - PET. Fusing point: 80 - 150°C. I played with the stiff PET labels from PET bottles. They shrink down to a small fraction of their size in no time and they do not fuse together. It's cute, but not very useful for making fabrics.\n\nA former 500 ml bottle label\n\nãã©PP - Polypropylene. Fusing point: 110 - 160°C. This worked much better for me, my hot iron isn't so hot as to totally melt PP. Tod's dry cleaning bags now have a second life as translucent fabric.\n\nThe completed 4-layer"
