        "text": "LIVE BOARD,INC. is excited to announce that \"Seibu Smile Vision\" screens in trains on the Ikebukuro, Shinjuku, Haijima, Toshima, Sayama, and Seibu Yurakucho lines, which are sold via SEIBU RAILWAY Co.,Ltd. will be connected to the LIVE BOARD Marketplace as of December 11, 2023. In addition to the conventional sales method that specifies the delivery period and number of ad plays, NTT DOCOMO's location data and analysis technology will be used to develop a model that provides an estimated number of passengers and viewers in each station, enabling a new and enriched method of selling digital media based on the estimated number of people who actually viewed the advertisement. Impressions (VAC)* sales based on the number of people who can be estimated to have actually viewed the advertisement will also be possible.\n\n* LIVE BOARD uses impressions that consider the visibility rate based on visibility surveys (VAC = Visibility Adjusted Contact / total number of people who saw the ad), as recommended in the OOH Global Measurement Guidelines. Of the number of people in the viewing area of a medium (OTS = Opportunity to See), the number of people who may come into contact with an OOH ad (OTC = Opportunity to Contact / takes into account the direction of movement within the viewing area and the presence of obstacles) is defined. The number of people who are likely to actually see the advertisement (VAC) is estimated by adding the visibility rate for each media to this number.\n\nLIVE BOARD will continue to create new value for the expansion of the OOH market by implementing effective and efficient operation of transportation advertising, and further promote the realization of advertising distribution tailored to diverse lifestyles.\n\nâAbout Seibu Smile Vision\n\nSmile Vision is a visual media using 15-inch or 17-inch LCD monitors installed above the doors of the 40000, 6000, and 30000 series trains that are compatible with interactive direct service. The perfect location and the impact of the moving images make it a medium that attracts a great deal of attention.\n\nâMedia Information\n\nMedia venueï¼Seibu Smile Vision\n\nService available on: 5,160 Screens\n\nSize: 17Inchesï¼16ï¼9ï¼ã15 Inchesï¼4ï¼3ï¼\n\nEffective on: December 11, 2023\n\nâLIVE BOARD screens across the country\n\nLIVE BOARD currently has more than 51,700 screens, and is continuing to expand its network every day, not only by installing their own new screens, but also by aggregating screens from partners across the country.\n\nURL: liveboard.co.jp/en/screen\n\nâAbout LIVE BOARD, INC.\n\nA digital OOH ad network operator achieving data driven targeting and effectiveness verification\n\nLIVE BOARD is the first company in Japan to achieve impression-based (VAC) advertisement delivery in OOH. We deploy advertisement delivery and billing systems in accordance with actual conditions that are based on the estimated number of viewers \"at that time, in that place, and for that specific ad,\" even during the COVID-19 pandemic, when people's movement patterns are prone to change. In addition, by combining big data from Japan's largest carriers with our own network, which includes a wide range of digital OOH across Japan, including outdoor, indoor, train, and station OOH ads, we have been able to deliver personalized ads, such as targeting by gender and age, that was not possible with traditional OOH."
