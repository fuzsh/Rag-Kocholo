        "text": "According to someone who was stationed in Singapore‚Ä¶ \"When asking for directions, speaking in grammatically correct English is too long. You have to convey it simply.\" To achieve the goal (knowing the way), only the minimum necessary means are required. If it's grammatically correct, it might not be understood. I thought this is the same for Spanishüí° ‚≠ïÔ∏è¬øC√≥mo puedo ir a la estaci√≥n? Of course, this will be understood. ‚≠ïÔ∏è¬øD√≥nde, estaci√≥n? Even this will be understood, and locals will kindly give directions. In other words, when it comes to practical use, don‚Äôt worry about the details. In practice, the important thing is the goal, not the means. #SpanishExpressions #LanguageLearning\n\nü•™ Ever tried #Subway while traveling in a foreign country?

It has been an adventure, with its ups and downs, as I strive to improve my Finnish for daily use in my job but I am glad to have supportive work environment. English was my initial safety net, but with time, I have increasingly turned to Finnish. Although I feel more comfortable to speak Finnish, there are still moments when joining work-related discussions feels like balancing on a thin rope, forming and organizing my thoughts while actively engaging. This experience has led me to reflect on how we internationals integrate into Finnish-speaking environment and develop fluency: slowly. My message to Finnish organizations and companies: I encourage you to support those who are still learning Finnish by creating a motivating environment for using Finnish at different levels of proficiency. Achieving fluency is a marathon, not a sprint. By providing opportunities to non-native or emerging Finnish speakers, you are not just investing in linguistic diversity but also using a supply of varied experiences and skills. These individuals offer more than just language skills to your team‚Äîthey bring unique insights and diverse viewpoints that could be key to achieving your organization's or company's objectives. #LanguageLearning #WorkplaceDiversity #FinnishLanguage #ProfessionalGrowth\n\nGetting to know the Swedish market: The Basics Have you ever considered expanding your products or services to the Swedish market?

The issue is still controversial until now. In the fourth cultural intelligence session by Dr. Catherine Wu, my classmates and I discussed Englishnization in the Rakuten case. The CEO of the firm mandated their current employees to pass the minimum requirement in TOEIC score (An English Proficiency Test) or to get demoted. When we discussed recommendations for the situation, it reminded me of how my colleagues in my previous company communicated with our foreign suppliers. Unlike most companies in Thailand, my company did not require any English proficiency qualification. Each of us could communicate and cooperate with our overseas suppliers well even though we do not have great English proficiency. From my perspective, I oppose the enforcement of English proficiency as the Rakuten firm did, but I prefer the corporation to create learning environments to help current employees improve their English skills over time. This would allow current employees to work efficiently in usual operations and enjoy learning English to communicate with foreigners. The elaboration is one of the takeaways from the previous session and I hope that I could learn more fascinating topics in the future.\n\nWhen I first stepped into the corporate world, I was hired not only because of my academic knowledge and technical abilities but also because of my linguistic ability. It was a skill that propelled my career in unexpected ways and helped shape my life into what it is today. Over the years and my experience working and living abroad, I learned to embrace language acquisition for richer global connections. üá®üá≥In China, grappling with the five tones of Mandarin Chinese was a challenge. But I discovered the art of counting to ten with just one hand‚Äîa handy trick at bustling markets! üáÆüá©In Indonesia, I was fascinated to find traces of Sanskrit in Bahasa Indonesian‚Äîa beautiful link to my mother tongue, Lithuanian. üá™üá∏And as I navigated South America, I was introduced to the delightful quirks of the Spanish language unique to each nation. Believe me, it led to many memorable moments! Language acquisition is a great way to expand your cultural knowledge and cultivate your Cultural Intelligence (CQ): - Deep Dive: Language isn't just words‚Äîit's a culture's essence. Learn a language, and you tap into its worldview. - Empathy Boost: Speaking another language deepens connections, signaling respect and understanding. - Cultural Nuances: Idioms and expressions reveal hidden cultural values. - Barrier Breaker: Proficiency reduces misunderstandings, paving smoother intercultural interactions. üó£Ô∏è\"Language is the road map of a culture. It tells you where its people come from and where they are going.\" ‚Äì Rita Mae Brown #culturalintelligence #cq #globalmindset #crossculturalcommunication #internationalbusiness #globalleadership #culturalawareness"
