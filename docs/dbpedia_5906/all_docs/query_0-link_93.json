Japan has not considered itself as a country of immigration until recently. Since Japan\\u27s prewar self-modernization period, conservative political discourse has conceptualized the modern nation-state as a racially homogeneous entity. This discourse established the cultural and political foundation for Japanese identity, and Japan\\u27s relationship with the outside world. Consequently, the incorporation of culturally and ethnically different Others has been deemed a threat to the harmony of Japan\\u27s homogeneous society. Yet, beginning in the late 1980s when the term internationalization began to be widely used in Japan as a political slogan for the rapid expansion of the Japanese economy the number of foreign workers legally and illegally entering into...\n\nTransnational labour migration has recently returned to the spotlight in Japan, due to its rapidly declining population and labour force. This paper argues that the tension between the (self-)illusion of Japan as a homogeneous nation-state and trans-border labour-importing to ensure the continued supply of the workforce has inherently characterized the process of Japan’s modernity since the Meiji Restoration of 1868. In doing so, it seeks to demonstrate how the synchrony of such ostensibly conflicting interests makes eminent economic sense to recruit migrant workers in order to ameliorate chronic labour shortages while keeping their labouring and living condition perpetually insecure and vulnerable.\n\nThis articlefocuses on a close reading of Rey Ventura's autobiographical narrative of his experience as an illegal migrant worker in Japan in or- der to unsettle the dominant paradigm of the overseas Filipino worker as herdine) and martyr. It examines the ways in which both the Philippine and Japanesestates have acted as apparatuses of labor capture; the vari- ous discourses of nationness which inform the political construction of the OFW as \"labor,\" 'yoreign,\" \"illegal\" and \"depoliticized\"; and the strategies of survival used by OFWs to negotiate with, and make claims on, the labor-sending and -receiving states.\n\nThis article aims to provide a basic understanding of the historical foundations of nationalism in contemporary Japan and the way the narrative of an “ethnically homogenous nation” has helped frame attitudes toward foreigners. While increasing immigration has been widely discussed as a potential strategy to combat population decline elsewhere, immigration and nationality laws have been very restrictive in Japan. The focus here is not on the complex details of currently operating Japanese legal frameworks but rather on the current state of Japan and future issues. By means of data analysis, the overall picture of immigration, including recent developments amidst changing demographics is painted. In the final section, needs and prospects for building a new consensus for Japan’s narratives on immigration and the nation-state are discussed.\n\nOn the surface, Japan continues to be a non-immigration country. Economic migrants are never admitted as permanent residents at the point of initial entry and rarely viewed as immigrants. At the same time, however, Japanese immigration policy has become markedly settlement-oriented since the mid-2000s. The government has managed to cobble together a series of initiatives which now has the appearance of integration policy mostly targeting co-ethnic migrants. The country has also introduced a new points-based system which confers immigration privileges, such as family sponsorship and expedited access to permanent residence, on highly-skilled migrants. By pointing at these policy examples, I demonstrate that Japan has become a de facto immigration country where some migrants are or are expected to become denizens. The present aim, then, is to explain why and how this shift has occurred despite the stasis which characterises the policy façade. I argue that these changes are best understood as reactive and incremental adjustments to unexpected outcomes of earlier policy decisions on the admission of both unskilled and highly-skilled workers as temporary migrants.\n\nThe object of this research has been to study the status of Asian and South American immigrants currently residing and working in Japan. Traditionally, Japan has made cultural and racial homogeneity a major element of the nation and has thought negatively of immigration. Japanese officials have not easily granted foreigners the right and opportunity to settle permanently. Thus, Japan has a very low immigration rate and the lowest proportion of foreign residents of any major industrialized country. With the current decline in birthrates, an aging population, and labor shortage, Japan’s economic success may depend on foreign residents. Therefore, the issue of arriving foreign workers and their status in society must be addressed. There is a prevalent concern among experts that xenophobic ideologies behind government policies, strict immigration laws, and negative media images have lead to the cultural belief that foreigners are an intrusion on Japanese national identity and a disrupti..."
