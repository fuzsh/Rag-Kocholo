        "text": "The Seibu 001 series is a Japanese limited express electric multiple unit operated by the Seibu Railway since March 2019.\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe 001 series trains were designed as a successor to the older 10000 trains. The first sets were constructed in 2018 by Hitachi and transported to the Seibu Railway the same year; operations began in March 2019 with the introduction of the revised timetable.\n\nThe 001 series sets reintroduced the x01 naming scheme to the Seibu Railway; it was last used in 1981. As with virtually all of Seibu's other limited express trains, the 001 series sets feature branding; the sets are branded Laview. Laview is a multi-part name of sorts; each of the portions of the name is sort of a backronym for Luxury, Arrow and View, the \"Arrow\" referencing the limited express trains of the past.\n\nA total of seven sets were produced, totaling 56 cars. The sets have since won multiple awards, such as the 2019 Kids Design Award, the 2019 Good Design Award, the 2020 iF Design Award and the 2020 Blue Ribbon Award.\n\nDesign[]\n\nThe 001 series sets use a curved front end with top-mounted headlights in circular casings recessed in the body. The sets were designed with the language of \"something that has never been seen before\". The sets were designed to be a train which could blend in with the landscape and nature, a train which creates value and can act as a destination and not just as a means of transportation and has a living room-type feel. The trains are painted a metallic silver with Dai Nippon Toryo \"Super Bright No. 2000\" paint to blend in with the surroundings; this is the first time this sort of paint has been used on railway vehicles.\n\nThe design of the train can be attributed to four people; Kazuyo Sejima for the train's general design, Yoko Ando for the train's upholstery and flooring design, Shozo Toyohisa for lighting and Juntaka Tanase for graphic design for the train's logomarks.\n\nThe LED headlights of the sets feature a secondary ring of LEDs around them; these can be configured to have various lighting patterns at events, the most common of which is that the top half of the ring is lit, simulating a smile. The patterns are changed by operating a switch in the cab.\n\nSpecifications[]\n\nConstruction is of a double-skinned aluminum alloy based on Hitachi's A-Train concept. The sets use Mitsubishi 2-level SiC-based MOSFETs for traction motors which create a soft hissing noise.\n\nGallery[]"
