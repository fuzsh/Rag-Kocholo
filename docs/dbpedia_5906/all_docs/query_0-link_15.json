        "text": "Company Name Ticker Proposal Text Vote Instruction Rationale 1st Source Corporation SRCE Elect Director Daniel B.

AAPL Report on Concealment Clauses For Having a mandatory training on conduct policy is a standard practice that has not prevented harassment cases at other companies. Although the Company has committed to incorporate language that will allow departing employees to discuss their experiences in US separation agreements going forward, supporting the proposal will encourage Apple to reach out to shareholders and further explore what the best practices are. The Coca-Cola Company KO Report on External Public Health Costs Against While we agree that product health and nutrition are a material ESG risk for Coca-Cola, the company is significantly addressing the asks put forward by the proponent. Coca-Cola is taking clear action around reducing the sugar content of its products, while quantifying and disclosing the results of its progress and setting robust, forward-looking goals related to health. Actions include introducing new products and making public commitments and pledges to considerably reduce sugar in its beverages. The company acknowledges that factors such as health-related concerns and evolving consumer preferences are impactful to its business and is accordingly taking meaningful steps to improve its product formulas and manage risks related to public health. Recognizing that KO has received similar proposals in prior years, AB will continue to evaluate the company's efforts as they relate to reducing the sugar content of its products. Amazon.com, Inc. . AMZN Commission Third Party Study and Report on Risks Associated with Use of Rekognition For We agree with the proponent that Amazon should perform a similar exercise for Rekognition as it has done with Ring. Simply because the Rekognition product isnâ€™t used as a surveillance tool or isnâ€™t intended as a surveillance tool does not guarantee the absence of misuse cases or potentially harmful impact on users and communities. We also note that the company isn't necessarily bound by the time line requested by the proponent, given the advisory nature of the proposal. Report on Risks Associated with Use of Concealment Clauses For In absence of any data to assess the impact of existing concealment clauses, including mandatory arbitration, on the Companyâ€™s employeesâ€™ ability to raise concerns on harassment and discrimination, greater transparency on the Companyâ€™s concealment clauses in all forms would add value for shareholders to understand the potential risks. Meta Platforms, Inc FB Report on Risks Associated with Use of Concealment Clauses For In absence of any data to assess the impact of existing concealment clauses on the Companyâ€™s employeesâ€™ ability to raise concerns on harassment and discrimination, greater transparency on the Companyâ€™s concealment clauses in all forms would add value for shareholders to understand the potential risks. Alphabet Inc. GOOGL Approve Recapitalization Plan for all Stock to Have One-vote per Share For The requested action enhances shareholder voice and aligns with ABâ€™s Proxy Voting and Governance Policy approach in promoting the one-share, one-vote principle. Similar to prior years, support is warranted on this proposal."
