The robot has to see what is happening as quickly as possible and notify the staff. Moreover, it notifies the staff if it notices some lost belongings at the station,\" Sone added.\n\nThanks to the robot, Seibu Railway employees will no longer have to repeatedly cruise around the station and check if there are any lost belongings or suspicious objects.\n\nThe results of the test are currently being studied. Following the research, decision will be made if it is reasonable to \"employ\" the robot or not.\n\nThe 2020 Summer Olympics is scheduled to take place on July 24-August 9, while the Paralympics will be held on August 25-September 6, 2020."
