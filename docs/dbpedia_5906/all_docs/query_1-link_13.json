        "text": "THIS IS A TEXT NUMBER 01\n\n—Yūto Tonokawa[22]\n\nRewrite was announced on April 1, 2008,[25] which led to some speculation whether it was an April Fool's joke or an actual announcement of Key's new game.[26] It was announced the following day on Key's blog that production on Rewrite had begun.[26][27] On April 1, 2010, Rewrite's official website was updated with the announcement that the game would be an adult game, but this turned out to be an April Fool's joke the following day.[26] It was later reported by Key in February 2011 that an adult version of Rewrite would definitely not be produced.[28] On April 1, 2011, Key released an anime video featuring the song \"Rewrite\" by Psychic Lover.\n\n1 Gameplay\n\nGameplay[edit]\n\n2 Plot\n\n2.1 Setting\n\n2.2 Principal characters\n\n2.3 Story\n\nMusic[edit] Main article: List of Rewrite soundtracks\n\nKey released a fan disc expanding on the game's story titled Rewrite Harvest festa! on July 27, 2012 for

the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction.\n\nTo advertise Harvest festa!, Good Smile Racing produced an itasha (a car featuring illustrations of anime-styled characters) of a 2008 Daihatsu Hijet Cargo decorated with images from the game, and drove it around Japan between May 30 and July 26, 2012.[56] The car was put onto the Japanese Yahoo!\n\nAkane also invites into the club Chihaya Ohtori, a second-year transfer student in Kotarou's class who is very strong, but clumsy.[12] Chihaya, who is also a heroine, has led a sheltered life and now lives with her butler Sakuya Ohotri,[13] who poses as her brother at school.\n\nSimilarly, to access Akane's scenario, Chihaya's must be done first.\n\nAn anthology published by Taibundo and illustrated by Zen titled Earth Star Comics Rewrite was published in September 2011.[76] Two volumes of an anthology series released by Ichijinsha under the title Rewrite Comic Anthology were released between September and November 2011.[77][78] Enterbrain released two volumes of a collection of four-panel comic strips under the title Magi-Cu 4-koma Rewrite between December 2011 and March 2012.[79][80] A manga anthology titled Rewrite Comic A La Carte: Okaken Katsudō Hōkokusho (Rewrite コミックアラカルト オカ研活動報告書?) appeared in Kadokawa Shoten's Comp Ace and a single volume was released in October 2011.[81]\n\nThe first ending theme is \"Yami no Kanata e\" (闇の彼方へ Beyond the Darkness?) by NanosizeMir, and it is used for Kotori's, Chihaya's and Lucia's scenarios.\n\nAfter the five heroine's routes are completed, the story shifts to a setting amid a ruined Kazamatsuri where Kotarou encounters Kagari in a world after re-evolution, still on the Moon.\n\nKotarou unwillingly stabs Kagari, and after a kiss, they evolve into an orb of light inside a tree.\n\nKotarou falls into a coma, and he is administered an amnesiac drug to forget about Gaia and Guardian.\n\nPrincipal characters[edit]\n\nThe purpose of the program is to test whether a given Windows computer will be able to play Rewrite or other games using the Siglus game engine.\n\nPrinted media[edit]\n\nGaia and Guardian came to Kazamatsuri in the pursuit of the Earth's familiar named Kagari, who manifests as a young, high school age-looking girl.\n\nKotarou, who is interested in the unidentified mysterious animals in the forest in and around Kazamatsuri, spends times with five girls in the occult research society at his school: Kotori Kanbe, Chihaya Ohtori, Sizuru Nakatsu, Lucia Konohana, and Akane Senri, who is also the club president.\n\n2.00, was released on Rewrite's official website on March 26, 2011.[37][38] A free benchmark program titled Chihaya Rolling became available for download at Key's official website on August 20, 2010.\n\nWhile Rewrite was originally planned to be released on April 28, 2011,[43] the game was later released on June 24, 2011 as a limited edition version, playable as a 2-disc DVD set on a Windows PC.[44] The limited edition came bundled with an approximately 80-page official guide book titled Rewrite of the Life, a remix album titled Soil, a CD containing recordings of the Internet radio show Radio Rewrite, three original cards from the Weiß Schwarz trading card game, an original card from the Lycèe Trading Card Game, three extra DVD case covers, and a mobile phone strap.[45] Over two dozen stores in Akihabara and online offered special promotional items if the limited edition version of the game was bought at their store.\n\nTherefore, he had the sort of feeling that if Ryukishi's taste was mixed in, the result would definitely be something deep and interesting, I heard him say.[23]\n\nComic sold between October 26, 2011 and April 26, 2013.[72][73] Two volumes of Okaken Blog were released: the first on July 27, 2012,[74] and the second on July 27, 2013.[75]\n\nPlot[edit]\n\nGaia wants to capture Kagari to ensure the destruction of humanity, but Guardian wishes to seek out Kagari to kill her, ensuring that human life continues.\n\nAuctions in July 2011 for 405,000 yen.[34] Promotional items that could be purchased at the event included a Rewrite introduction pamphlet, a Rewrite stationary set, a remix album titled Deejay Busters! featuring remixes of music from Little Busters! and Key's eighth game Kud Wafter, and a Kanon light novel titled Kanojotachi no Kenkai (彼女たちの見解 The Girls' Opinions?) written by Mariko Shimizu and illustrated by Zen.[35]\n\nThis hill appears again later on Earth in the forest of Kazamatsuri.[1]\n\nEach of the singles and albums released were on Key's record label Key Sounds Label.\n\nIn Rewrite Harvest festa!, the opening theme is \"Harvest\" by Tada, and the ending theme is \"Sasayaka na Hajimari\" (ささやかなはじまり?) by NanosizeMir.\n\nThe story follows the life of Kotarou Tennouji, a high school student with superhuman abilities who investigates supernatural mysteries with five girls from his school.\n\nShortly after Rewrite's release, Tonokawa approached Takahiro Baba with the proposal, who gave his approval for the production of a fan disc.[2] Titled Rewrite Harvest festa!, the fan disc was produced by the same staff as Rewrite, and was released on July 27, 2012, playable on a Windows PC.[51] It came bundled with the fan disc's original soundtrack titled Feast, a CD containing recordings of Radio Rewrite, an original booklet, two mobile phone straps, and one promotional card each from the trading card games Weiß Schwarz, Lycèe and Phantasmagoria.[52]\n\nMain article: List of Rewrite characters The player assumes the role of Kotarou Tennouji, the protagonist of Rewrite.\n\nStory[edit]\n\nThe names of the friends and the completed quests are recorded in the Memory function, which serves as an encyclopedia of events.\n\nOne is Kotori Kanbe, Kotarou's childhood friend in his class who has few friends[14] and starts attending school regularly after joining the club.\n\n(Rewrite オカ研へようこそ!!?), was serialized between the June 2011 and April 2014 issues of Ichijinsha's Manga 4-koma Palette.[69][70] The first volume of Okaken e Yōkoso!! was released on July 21, 2012.[71] A fourth manga, illustrated by Yayoi Hazuki and titled Rewrite: Okaken Blog (Rewrite ‒OKA☆KEN ぶろぐ‒?), was serialized between volumes 20 and 29 of ASCII Media Works' Dengeki G's Festival!\n\nOppai is a branch off Akane's scenario and serves as a comedic plot line not important to the overall story.[1]\n\nRewrite is also the first Key game to be developed on Visual Art's' game engine Siglus.[18] The project's planning was headed by Itaru Hinoue, who is also the art director and character designer for Rewrite.[19] During the time when Key was developing their fifth game Tomoyo After: It's a Wonderful Life in 2005, Hinoue had more free time since she was just helping Fumio with the character design, and that is when Hinoue got the initial idea for Rewrite.[20] Hinoue wrote a proposal for the basis of Rewrite's premise and passed it on to Takahiro Baba, the president of Visual Art's.[21]\n\nShe has a playful personality and has an extremely strong pet dog named Chibi-Moth.[15] Kotori, who is a summoner, is not affiliated with Gaia or Guardian, and instead follows in the path of an ancient sect of summoners called Druids who revered nature and protected Kagari with familiars.\n\nIf the player completes all 31 quests, a bonus scenario called Oppai (おっぱい Breasts?) is made available.\n\nKagari, the main heroine of Rewrite, has the power to initiate a period of re-evolution, which restarts the process of evolving another means of intelligent life.\n\nKey hosted a promotional event on May 8, 2011 called Rewrite Fes. in Akihabara.[31] Displayed in the event hall were various large illustrations of Rewrite characters by Hinoue, as well as illustrations of the characters by various artists that were originally posted on Rewrite's official website.[32][33] The event featured live performances by NanosizeMir and Psychic Lover, as well as on-stage discussions of Rewrite development staff members and voice actors featured in the game.\n\nOnce these three scenarios are completed, the routes for Sizuru and Akane become available, and after those two are completed, Kagari's scenario is made available.\n\nRewrite is Key's ninth game, and is the first of Key's visual novels to feature a 16:9 image aspect ratio instead of the previously-used 4:3 aspect ratio.\n\nHe is a second-year high school student who has a bright personality and is sociable to others.[10] Kotarou is a superhuman with two powers called Rewrite and Aurora.\n\nThe Moon's Kagari is trying to research a way so the Earth and humanity are not destroyed, and Kotarou attempts to buy her time while fighting a hoard of familiars summoned by Sakura Kashima of Gaia whose resolve is to annihilate humanity by killing Kagari.\n\nKotarou meets first-year student Sizuru Nakatsu, a shy girl on the public morals committee[16] who has excellent hearing, eyesight and can read lips.\n\nKotarou and the entire cast rejoin together to protect Kagari, who manages to finish her plan to allow the Earth and humanity to coexist by sending the Moon's life force back to Earth.\n\nRewrite's story revolves around the main protagonist Kotarou Tennouji, a male high school student living in Kazamatsuri, and the story begins on October 3, 2010 on the Moon.\n\nAs a result, Kagari praises Kotarou and shows gratitude for showing her satisfactory memories.\n\nKotarou invites three other girls into the occult research society who are also heroines in the game.\n\nKotarou is invited into his school's occult research society by the club president Akane Senri, who is one year older than him and is referred to as the \"School Witch\" by other students because of her mysterious nature.[11] Akane, a heroine in the game, is unenthusiastic towards Kotarou's pursuit of the supernatural, which she initially claims she does not believe in, but is later shown to be a high ranking summoner in Gaia.\n\nThe five heroines, now in high school, investigate the tree as members of the occult research society and transform Kotarou into a familiar, but he refuses to do what they demand.\n\nA manga adaptation, illustrated by Sakana Tōjō and titled Rewrite: Side-B, began serialization in the October 2010 issue of ASCII Media Works' Dengeki G's Magazine.[60] The manga ended serialization in the magazine's May 2014 issue and was transferred to Dengeki G's Comic starting with the June 2014 issue.[61] The first tankōbon volume for Side-B was released on April 27, 2011;[62] the sixth volume was released on March 27, 2014.[63] A second manga, illustrated by Shūichi Kawakami and titled Rewrite: Side-R, was serialized between the April 2011 and September 2013 issues of ASCII Media Works' Dengeki Daioh.[64][65] Five volumes of Side-R were released between June 27, 2011 and October 26, 2013.[66][67] Side-B and Side-R are meant to be read together as a pair.[68] A third, four-panel comic strip manga, illustrated by Miyura Yano and titled Rewrite Okaken e Yōkoso!!\n\nMarketing and release[edit]\n\nMartel itself used to be a church and contains within it a holy maiden group of girls with developmental disabilities.\n\nKazamatsuri is the setting for a secret war being waged by two main groups: Gaia and Guardian.[1] Gaia, an organization under the auspices of the environmental conservation group Martel, is populated by nihilistic and misanthropic people able to contract with familiars, which manifest as constructs fueled by the summoner's life force.\n\nSetting[edit]\n\nThroughout gameplay, the player encounters minigames accessed through an in-game GPS system called Mappie, which is rendered as a point and click map.[1] In most cases, the player can choose to automatically skip accessing Mappie, but sometimes the player is required to play through the minigame to move on to the next event.\n\nDevelopment[edit]\n\nRewrite marked the first time since Key's third game Clannad that Itaru Hinoue was staffed as the sole art director and character designer in a Key visual novel.[22] The school uniforms for the heroines in the game are old designs that Hinoue created and used before in dōjinshi (self-published work).[20] In particular, Hinoue spent much time on drawing the character art in Rewrite due in part to the design of the school uniforms, the fact that most of the female characters have long hair, and because of the increased aspect ratio.[21] Six more graphic artists worked on Rewrite: Torino headed the background art, Ryou Shigawa designed and illustrated the monsters, and the computer graphics in the game were done by Na-Ga, Shinory, Mochisuke, and Minimo Tayama.[1] The game's soundtrack was composed by Key's signature composers Jun Maeda and Shinji Orito, in addition to Maiko Iuchi of I've Sound, Sōshi Hosoi, and Ryō Mizutsuki.[19] Maeda also contributed on the quality control for the game.[19]\n\nAdaptations[edit]\n\nThese plot lines represent various timelines in which the conflict between Gaia and Guardian occurs, although it is hinted that humanity is inevitably destroyed in every timeline.\n\nKotarou at this point is a unified entity of all the Kotarous from all timelines where humanity was destroyed and he has memories of these events.\n\nSome decisions can lead the game to end prematurely, which offer an alternative ending to the plot.\n\nHumanity survives in the aftermath, but the world experiences an ice age outside of Kazamatsuri.\n\nFes. in Akihabara.[59] The event featured live performances by NanosizeMir and Aoi Tada, as well as on-stage discussions of development staff members Tonokawa and Orito, and voice actors featured in the game.[59]\n\nHowever, this is done with the use of the Earth's energy, and by the time the events of Rewrite occur, there is no more energy left to do another re-evolution.\n\nInternet radio show[edit]\n\nIn this secret world developed by Gaia, a sustainable environment exists to support life.\n\nGuardian is dedicated to the destruction of familiars and is composed almost entirely of humans who possess special powers.\n\nThe guitar was later sold on Yahoo!\n\nRewrite enables him to permanently restructure and modify any part of his body, including his blood, so as to make himself stronger or faster.\n\nA lengthy game demo of Rewrite came bundled with the limited edition version of Kud Wafter released on June 25, 2010.[36] Another slightly longer version of the demo, ver.\n\nUpon the completion of the Moon route, another scenario called Terra is made available, which serves as the true conclusion to the story; both Moon and Terra revolve around the main heroine, Kagari.[1]\n\nThere is just enough energy and resources left for a final re-evolution.\n\nWhen the game is completed at least once, a gallery of the viewed CGs and played background music becomes available on the game's title screen.\n\nBy the time he wakes up, Kotori is in junior high school, and Kotarou later graduates junior high with Kotori.\n\nAfter the plot lines for these five heroines have been completed, an additional scenario called Moon is made available.\n\nAfter the project was accepted, Hinoue consulted Key's former main scenario writer Jun Maeda on various game scenario writers to employ for Rewrite.[22] However, the one writer Hinoue wanted on the project was Romeo Tanaka, who she had become a fan of after she played FlyingShine's 2003 visual novel Cross Channel, written by Tanaka.[20] While he did not initially accept the offer, Tanaka decided to take the project when he was given the time he needed to do the job.\n\nAfter the completion of Kagari's scenario, a dungeon exploration role-playing minigame called Rewrite Quest becomes available.\n\nWhen on the Moon, a hill where daisies grow is prominently shown amid a ruined Kazamatsuri where the night is eternal.\n\nThe dial moves forward whenever this ability is used, and the outcome of certain scenes is determined by how much the dial has moved.\n\nLike Akane, Chihaya is in Gaia and is a summoner.\n\nLike Sizuru, Lucia is a member of Guardian and has the ability to produces poisonous miasma and pus as a result of an experiment by Guardian, which she takes medication for to suppress.\n\nIf a rank of D and above is shown, gameplay of Rewrite will be normal, but if E is shown, gameplay will be fairly normal other than a few exceptions.[37] Between April 21 and May 9, 2011, Visual Art's accepted orders for a \"Rewrite Note PC\" laptop in two versions: a normal version and an AKN version with higher specifications;[39] AKN refers to Akane.[40] The AKN version has one random signature from either Hinoue, Orito or Tonokawa, though Visual Art's also sold the AKN version without the signature.[41][42] The AKN version also contained 16 Rewrite wallpaper images, with the normal version having nine.[39] The laptops feature five separate themes of system sounds, which use dialogue of the voice actresses of five Rewrite heroines: Kotori, Chihaya, Akane, Sizuru and Lucia.[39]\n\nKotarou agrees to help her and he acts as a double agent, demolishing Gaia's and Guardian's infrastructure in Kazamatsuri and killing those on either side.\n\nKazamatsuri is partly destroyed when Gaia attempts to force Kagari to initiate re-evolution, but Kotarou manages to stop this from occurring.\n\nShe can also create vibrations within the objects she touches.\n\nComic anthologies, light novels and an art book were also published, as were several music albums.\n\nHe goes on to spend time in high school with the occult research society as shown before.\n\nKotarou becomes disillusioned with Guardian's tactics and returns to Kazamatsuri where he meets Kagari again.\n\nEight of the main characters from Rewrite have background music leitmotifs—the six heroines, Haruhiko Yoshino and Sakuya Ohtori.[96] Kagari's theme is \"Hinagiku\" (ヒナギク Daisy?); Kotori's theme is \"Nirinsō\" (ニリンソウ Soft Windflower?); Chihaya's theme is \"Asagao\" (アサガオ Morning Glory?); Akane's theme is \"Anthurium\" (アンスリウム Ansuriumu?); Sizuru's theme is \"Carnation\" (カーネーション Kānēshon?); Lucia's theme is \"Sunbright\" (サンブライト Sanburaito?); Yoshino's theme is \"DIS is a Pain\"; lastly, Sakuya's theme is \"Sanka\" (散花?).[96]\n\nThe program, which also came with the previously released demo, features Chihaya rolling down a hill and hitting boulders and Kotori's pet dog Chibi-Moth.\n\nThe next two ending themes are \"Koibumi\" (恋文 Love Letter?) and \"Itsuwaranai Kimi e\" (偽らない君へ?), both sung by Nagi Yanagi.\n\nOn the day of its release, two video game retailers in Akihabara opened two hours early for advance sales of Rewrite.[114] The main Gamers store opened at 7 a.m. to a line of about 200 people.\n\nPrior to the initial events of Rewrite, Kotarou had been a low-ranking member of Guardian posted in Kazamatsuri, where he encounters Kagari.\n\nThroughout most of the game, the text is presented in a dialog box on the lower portion of the game screen, but this is changed for the Terra scenario, where the text is overlaid across the entire screen.[1]\n\nEvery time Kotarou uses his Rewrite ability, he uses up some of his life-force and becomes closer to being a full familiar.\n\nIt was released on June 24, 2011 for Windows PCs and is rated for all ages.\n\nThe top three winners would each get a downloadable wallpaper, and first place would get original artwork for the wallpaper. A voter could vote one time for up to three characters per day.\n\nRewrite (リライト Riraito?) is a Japanese visual novel developed by Key, a brand of Visual Art's.\n\n\"Philosophyz\", \"Itsuwaranai Kimi e\", and \"Watari no Uta\" are used in the fan disc as insert songs.\n\nFan disc[edit]\n\nThe gameplay in Rewrite follows an interactive branching plot line with multiple scenarios, and focuses on the player character gaining the favor of the six female main characters.\n\nRewrite follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction.\n\nAverage dialogue and narrative in Rewrite depicting the main character Kotarou talking to Kotori.\n\nA single for \"Rewrite\" was released on May 27, 2011.[98] As with Key's previous works (excluding Planetarian: Chiisana Hoshi no Yume), a music album came bundled with the limited edition release of the game; the album, released on June 24, 2011, is titled Soil and contains arranged versions of ten tracks of the game's music.[99] Rewrite's original soundtrack was first released on August 12, 2011 at Comiket 80 containing 63 tracks; it was later released for general sale on October 28, 2011.[100] A remix album titled Branch was released on December 29, 2011 at Comiket 81.[101] The original soundtrack for Rewrite Harvest festa!, titled Feast, was released bundled with the fan disc on July 27, 2012.\n\nRewrite has seven pieces of theme music: two opening themes and five ending themes.\n\nThe scenario consists of spin-off stories which expand on Rewrite's story,[53] the harvest festival from Rewrite's story is expanded on in Harvest festa!,[2] and minigames are included during the course of gameplay, as in Rewrite.[3] The size of the scenario in Harvest festa! is roughly comparable in size to Tomoyo After.[3] The fan disc also features official character art of Inoue, a supporting character who was unillustrated in Rewrite.[2] Unlike Rewrite, Kotarou is fully voiced in the fan disc.\n\nWhen first playing the game, the scenarios for the heroines Kotori, Chihaya and Lucia are available.[1] To access Sizuru's scenario, Kotori's must be completed first.\n\nAuction website on September 3, 2012 and sold for 1,806,000 yen after starting the auction at 1 yen.[57][58] Like the previously held Rewrite Fes., Key hosted a promotional event on June 10, 2012 called Rewrite Harvest festa!\n\nRomeo's scenarios are very logical, and Key can do moe as a focus, so there was nothing that was \"scary\".\n\nA series of seven short stories titled Official Another Story Rewrite: Ha Yure Sasayaku Shōkei de (Official Another Story Rewrite -葉揺れささやく小径で-?), written by the scenario writers of Rewrite and illustrated by Zen, were serialized between the September 2011 and March 2012 issues of Dengeki G's Magazine.[82][83] Self-described as an official illustrated story for Rewrite,[83] the short stories were collected into a single volume released on July 27, 2012.[84] Three volumes of a short story compilation series by several authors titled Rewrite SSS were published by Harvest between October 2011 and January 2012.[85][86] Four volumes of a light novel anthology published by Paradigm under their VA Bunko imprint titled Rewrite Novel Anthology were released between November 2011 and February 2012.[87][88] A 224-page art book titled Rewrite Perfect Visual Book (Rewrite パーフェクトビジュアルブック?) was released on November 30, 2011 by ASCII Media Works.[89] The art book contains story summaries of the game's scenarios, information on the cast of characters, interviews from the production staff, and illustrations featuring art from the game.[1]\n\n\"Koibumi\" is used for Sizuru's route, and \"Itsuwaranai Kimi e\" is used for Akane's story.\n\nSizuru joins the club with her close friend Lucia Konohana, the class representative of Kotarou's class.[17] Lucia is easily agitated by the antics of boys and often punches Kotarou when he annoys her.\n\nSizuru is a member of Guardian who has the ability to produce various chemicals inside her body which can be used to heal herself and others, paralyze and cause amnesia.\n\nThe Sofmap Amusement store opened at 9 a.m. and used two floors in the eight-story building for sales of Rewrite: the fifth floor was used for general sale and advance orders of the game, while the eighth floor was used solely for those who had reserved their copy.[114]\n\nReception[edit] In 2011, Rewrite ranked five times in the top ten in national PC game pre-orders in Japan.\n\nContents\n\nThe staff members included Tonokawa and Ryukishi07 who discussed the game's scenario, and Orito and Hoshi who talked about Rewrite's music.[31][32] Orito also performed at the event on an electric guitar decorated with images of Rewrite including character images and the title logo.\n\n\"Itsuwaranai Kimi e\" is also used as an insert song during Lucia's route.\n\nDuring this time, Kotarou falls in love with each of them in separate plot lines determined by the choices the player makes.\n\nShe tells him she must initiate re-evolution, but since this would lead to a dead world, Kagari must find good memories brought out through the betterment of life on Earth, as opposed to bad memories caused by war and conflict.\n\nThe text in the game is accompanied by character sprites, which represent who Kotarou is talking to, over background art.\n\nKotarou takes the girls to the Moon where they are shown circled around a seedling (as the embodiment of the Moon's Kagari) sprouting on the otherwise barren regolith.\n\nThis ultimately leads him into the middle of a conflict between familiar summoners and superhumans searching for a familiar girl named Kagari who is the key to intelligent life and its destruction on Earth.\n\nTonokawa wrote Chihaya's and Sizuru's routes, and Ryukishi07 wrote Lucia's story.[1] Tanaka initially planned on the length of Rewrite's story to be on about the same scale as Key's second game Air, but as it increased in size, he later attempted to keep it close to the scale of Little Busters!.[22]\n\nAn Internet radio show to promote Rewrite called Radio Rewrite: Gekkan Tera Kazamatsuri Gakuin Shikyoku (ラジオRewrite 月刊テラ・風祭学院支局 Radio Rewrite: Terra Monthly Magazine - Kazamatsuri Academy Branch?) broadcast 70 episodes between May 27, 2011 and September 28, 2012.[90][91] The show was streamed online every Friday, and was produced by the Japanese Internet radio stations Hibiki and Onsen.[90][92] The show was hosted by Masakazu Morita and Chiwa Saitō, who voice Kotarou Tennouji and Kotori Kanbe from the game, respectively.[90] Seven CD compilation volumes containing all 70 episodes were released between September 30, 2011 and August 28, 2013.[93][94]\n\nAurora manipulates his energy to form weapons like a sword or claw.\n\nWhen accessing Mappie, the player meets various people who become Kotarou's friends, and certain people and items encountered will lead the player to do a quest.\n\nThe last two ending themes are \"Watari no Uta\" (渡りの詩?) used in the Moon route, and \"Canoe\" used in the Terra route, both sung by Aoi Tada.\n\nA remix album titled Dye Mixture featuring tracks from both Rewrite and Harvest festa! was released on December 29, 2012 at Comiket 83.\n\nThe rankings were at No. 6 in April, No. 3 in May, and No. 1 in June.[111][112] Harvest festa! ranked first in terms of national sales of PC games in Japan in July 2012.[113]\n\nThere are additional minigames and quests added into the gameplay, which are necessary to complete the game.\n\nThere are eight main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, three which are initially available and five more which can later become available.[1] Throughout gameplay, the player is given multiple options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made.\n\nIn a different timeline when he encounters Kagari, Kotarou lets her go.\n\nIn the city, a huge tree grows 500 meters tall in three years, which contains the orb of light from Kotarou and Kagari.\n\nKotarou's aging is also slowed as a consequence.\n\nThe gear and dial in the bottom left of the game screen is related to the Kotarou's Rewrite ability.\n\nThe single for \"Philosophyz\" was released on January 28, 2011.[97] The single contained \"Philosophyz\" and \"Yami no Kanata e\" in original, short and instrumental versions.\n\nThe game ranked as the best-selling PC game sold in Japan for the time of its release, and charted in the national top 50 twice more afterwards.\n\nRewrite is Key's ninth game, along with other titles such as Kanon, Air, and Clannad.\n\nIn the past, the Earth had sent this energy to the Moon so life could continue.\n\nIn one timeline, Kotarou is badly injured by Kagari, though he is healed into a half-familiar existence by a young Kotori with a piece of Kagari's ribbon.\n\nThroughout the game, the player encounters CG artwork at certain points in the story, which take the place of the background art and character sprites.\n\nThe club members spend fun, peaceful times together uncovering the supernatural mysteries of Kazamatsuri.\n\nIn Rewrite Harvest festa!, there are six separate scenarios, one for each heroine.[2][3] The player is initially given the choice to play the scenarios for Kotori, Chihaya and Lucia from a character selection screen.\n\nIn interviews before the release of Rewrite, Tonokawa expressed interest in expanding on the story if the game was well received.\n\nTo the president [of Visual Art's], if something like poison were injected into Rewrite, an interesting chemical reaction would take place.\n\nWhile Sizuru led at first,[115] Akane surged ahead near the end.[116] The top three winners were Akane with 18,042 votes, Sizuru with 16,839 votes, and Lucia with 15,047 votes.[117]\n\nThese items included telephone cards, gift cards, mobile phone straps, pin buttons, desk mats, posters, cushion covers, tote bags, tapestries, and bed sheets.[46] The regular edition of Rewrite was released on September 30, 2011.[47] Prototype released a PlayStation Portable port of Rewrite on April 17, 2014;[48] those who pre-ordered the game also receive an exclusive drama CD.[49] Prototype will also produce a PlayStation Vita version.[50]\n\nThe video was animated by White Fox,[29] and directed by Motoki Tanaka.[1] Again there was some speculation on its validity,[30] but Key confirmed the following day that the video and song would be used in Rewrite as the game's second opening theme song.[29]\n\nThe main part of Rewrite's story takes place in the fictional city of Kazamatsuri in Japan, where treeplanting and afforestation have caused the city to become overgrown with trees and vegetation.[1][4] The protagonist Kotarou and his friends in the occult research society attend a high school in Kazamatsuri,[5] and the characters also spend time in the society's clubroom.[6] Outside of the school, frequented locations include the forest around Kazamatsuri and Kotarou's house.[7][8] Throughout the story, Kotarou encounters an alternate dimension of Kazamatsuri where everything is silent and the sky is gray.[1][9] There are many entrances to this dimension throughout the city.\n\nRewrite is a romance visual novel in which the player assumes the role of Kotarou Tennouji.[1] Much of its gameplay is spent on reading the story's narrative and dialogue.\n\nThe five system sound themes included with the Rewrite laptops was released with the fan disc, with the addition of dialogue of Kagari by Kana Hanazawa.[54][55]\n\nThere have been four manga adaptations based on Rewrite published by ASCII Media Works and Ichijinsha.\n\nThere have also been several sets of manga anthologies produced by different companies and drawn by a multitude of different artists.\n\nShe has heterochromia, though wears an eyepatch over her golden-colored right eye as she is very self-conscious about it; her left eye is blue.\n\nShe is obsessed with cleanliness and always wears gloves.\n\nBoth Lucia and Sizuru have superhuman speed, agility, and reflexes in addition to their other abilities.\n\nThe first opening theme is \"Philosophyz\" by Runa Mizutani of the dōjin music group NanosizeMir.[95] The second opening theme is \"Rewrite\" by Psychic Lover.\n\nWhen he accepted it, Tanaka was still unaware that Maeda had stepped down as Key's main scenario writer, and he became more interested when he was told that he would write Rewrite's overall story.[22]\n\nAt the time, the only other scenario writer on the project was Yūto Tonokawa of Key, who previously contributed on Key's sixth game Little Busters!.[24] Tanaka was tasked with drawing up the entire scenario framework,[20] and during this time, Takahiro Baba suggested that one more heroine route be added to the story to bring the total to six, but to do that they had to hire another writer.[22] Ryukishi07 of 07th Expansion, the creators of the Higurashi no Naku Koro ni and Umineko no Naku Koro ni game franchises, was brought in as the third scenario writer after Baba suggested in late 2007 that Key ask him to join the staff for Rewrite.[20] Ultimately, Tanaka wrote the story leading up to the heroine's routes, Kotori's and Akane's scanarios, the Moon and Terra routes, and the bonus Oppai route.\n\nTHIS IS A TEXT NUMBER 02\n\nEinstein accepting U.S. citizenship certificate from judge Phillip Forman\n\nUS citizenship\n\nA dark-haired Bohr is

direction of motion) when measured in the frame of the observer.\n\nThis paper also argued that the idea of a luminiferous aether—one of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the time—was superfluous.[97]\n\nIn his paper on mass–energy equivalence, Einstein produced E = mc2 from his special relativity equations.[98] Einstein's 1905 work on relativity remained controversial for many years, but was accepted by leading physicists, starting with Max Planck.[99][100]\n\nAwards and honors\n\nEinstein, Albert (1905b), A new determination of molecular dimensions.

E. B. Du Bois, and in 1946 Einstein called racism America's \"worst disease\".[78] He later stated, \"Race prejudice has unfortunately become an American tradition which is uncritically handed down from one generation to the next.\n\nMuch of his work at the patent office related to questions about transmission of electric signals and electrical-mechanical synchronization of time, two technical problems that show up conspicuously in the thought experiments that eventually led Einstein to his radical conclusions about the nature of light and the fundamental connection between space and time.[41]\n\nIn 1922, he traveled throughout Asia and later to Palestine, as part of a six-month excursion and speaking tour.\n\nEinstein in New York, 1921, his first visit to the United States\n\nThe two would take long walks together discussing their work.\n\nThe following year, he quit the patent office and the lectureship to take the position of physics docent[47] at the University of Zürich.\n\nHead and shoulders shot of a young, moustached man with dark, curly hair wearing a plaid suit and vest, striped shirt, and a dark tie. Albert Einstein in 1904\n\nOn 17 April 1955, Albert Einstein experienced internal bleeding caused by the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, which had previously been reinforced surgically by Dr. Rudolph Nissen in 1948.[84] He took the draft of a speech he was preparing for a television appearance commemorating the State of Israel's seventh anniversary with him to the hospital, but he did not live long enough to complete it.[85]\n\nIn February 1933 while on a visit to the United States, Einstein decided not to return to Germany due to the rise to power of the Nazis under Germany's new chancellor, Adolf Hitler.[59][60] He visited American universities in early 1933 where he undertook his third two-month visiting professorship at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.\n\nDuring this period, Einstein tried to develop a unified field theory and to refute the accepted interpretation of quantum physics, both unsuccessfully.\n\nI will do it elegantly.\"[86] He died in Princeton Hospital early the next morning at the age of 76, having continued to work until near the end.\n\nIn the same article, Einstein also predicted the phenomenon of gravitational time dilation.\n\nHis father intended for him to pursue electrical engineering, but Einstein clashed with authorities and resented the school's regimen and teaching method.\n\nHe called himself an agnostic, while disassociating himself from the label atheist.[131] He said he believed in the \"pantheistic\" God of Baruch Spinoza, but not in a personal god, a belief he criticized.[132][133]\n\nThis was established by Einstein, Infeld, and Hoffmann for pointlike objects without angular momentum, and by Roy Kerr for spinning objects.\n\nFor the density to remain constant, new particles of matter must be continually formed in the volume from space.\"''\n\nIn 1895, at the age of sixteen, Einstein sat the entrance examinations for the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zürich (later the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule ETH).\n\nIn order to incorporate spinning point particles into general relativity, the affine connection needed to be generalized to include an antisymmetric part, called the torsion.\n\nThe effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white.\n\nThermodynamic fluctuations and statistical physics\n\nBose–Einstein statistics\n\nThe only remedies are enlightenment and education\".[79]\n\nAs a result of Einstein's letter and his meetings with Roosevelt, the U.S. entered the \"race\" to develop the bomb, drawing on its \"immense material, financial, and scientific resources\" to initiate the Manhattan Project.\n\nAnd: \"If one considers a physically bounded volume, particles of matter will be continually leaving it.\n\nAmerican youth has the good fortune not to have its outlook troubled by outworn traditions.\n\nThis idea only became universally accepted in 1919, with Robert Millikan's detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect, and with the measurement of Compton scattering.\n\nEinstein's sketches for this project may be seen in the Einstein Archive in the library of the Leiden University.[91]\n\nMarie Winteler moved to Olsberg, Switzerland for a teaching post.\n\nEinstein and De Haas demonstrated that magnetization is due to the motion of electrons, nowadays known to be the spin.\n\nAlbert attended a Catholic elementary school from the age of five for three years.\n\nDuring weekly visits over the next five years, he gave the boy popular books on science, mathematical texts and philosophical writings.\n\nThis paper introduced the photon concept (although the name photon was introduced later by Gilbert N. Lewis in 1926) and inspired the notion of wave–particle duality in quantum mechanics.\n\nWith the help of Marcel Grossmann's father Einstein secured a job in Bern at the Federal Office for Intellectual Property, the patent office,[38] as an assistant examiner.[39] He evaluated patent applications for electromagnetic devices. In 1903, Einstein's position at the Swiss Patent Office became permanent, although he was passed over for promotion until he \"fully mastered machine technology\".[40]\n\nMain article: Stress-energy-momentum pseudotensor\n\nHe told his inquirers \"Pardon me, sorry!\n\nEinstein collaborated with others to produce a model of a wormhole.\n\nWormholes Main article: Wormhole\n\nOrdinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density.\n\nGeneral relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics.\n\nIn Einstein's talk to the audience, he expressed his happiness over the event:\n\nLeft to right: Conrad Habicht, Maurice Solovine and Einstein, who founded the Olympia Academy\n\nEinstein argued that this is true for fundamental reasons, because the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates.\n\nPublications The following publications by Albert Einstein are referenced in this article.\n\nThen to each possible quantum motion of a particle in a box associate an independent harmonic oscillator.\n\nHe does not say much more, because he is not sure how the particles are related to the wave.\n\nTravels abroad\n\nEinstein 1921 by F Schmutzer.jpg Albert Einstein in 1921 Born 14 March 1879 Ulm, Kingdom of Württemberg, German Empire Died 18 April 1955 (aged 76)\n\nIn search of business, the Einstein family moved to Italy, first to Milan and then, a few months later, to Pavia.\n\nThis paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics, because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws.\n\nPeter Debye refined this model.[103] Adiabatic principle and action-angle variables\n\nIn 1900, Einstein was awarded the Zürich Polytechnic teaching diploma, but Marić failed the examination with a poor grade in the mathematics component, theory of functions.[27] There have been claims that Marić collaborated with Einstein on his celebrated 1905 papers,[28][29] but historians of physics who have studied the issue find no evidence that she made any substantive contributions.[30][31][32][33]\n\nEinstein saw this wave-particle duality in radiation as concrete evidence for his conviction that physics needed a new, unified foundation. Theory of critical opalescence\n\nThis absorption refrigerator was then revolutionary for having no moving parts and using only heat as an input.[123] On 11 November 1930, U.S. Patent 1,781,541 was awarded to Albert Einstein and Leó Szilárd for the refrigerator.\n\nIn June 1913, the Entwurf (\"draft\") theory was the result of these investigations.\n\nHe stated in the paper, ''\"In what follows, I would like to draw attention to a solution to equation (1) that can account for Hubbel's [sic] facts, and in which the density is constant over time.\"\n\nThis experiment needed to be sensitive, because the angular momentum associated with electrons is small, but it definitively established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for magnetization.\n\nIn order to show this, they reversed the magnetization in an iron bar suspended on a torsion pendulum.\n\nThus, the average density of the system never changed.\n\nMain articles: Statistical mechanics, thermal fluctuations, and statistical physics\n\nHe formulated an argument that led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible.\n\nIntroduction to special relativity\n\nTheir invention was not immediately put into commercial production, as the most promising of their patents were quickly bought up by the Swedish company Electrolux to protect its refrigeration technology from competition.[124]\n\nSo Einstein proposed that the path of a singular solution, like a black hole, would be determined to be a geodesic from general relativity itself.\n\nIn late 2013, Irish physicist Cormac O'Raifeartaigh, happened to discover a handwritten manuscript by Einstein which was since then overlooked by other scientists.\n\nEinstein worked in 1943 and 1944 as a $25-per-day consultant to the Research and Development Division of the U.S. Navy's Division of Ordnance.\n\nThis approach has been echoed by Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz, and others, and has become standard.\n\nBohr versus Einstein Main article: Bohr–Einstein debates Two men sitting, looking relaxed.\n\nErwin Schrödinger applied this to derive the thermodynamic properties of a semiclassical ideal gas. Schrödinger urged Einstein to add his name as co-author, although Einstein declined the invitation.[122]\n\nCollaboration with other scientists The 1927 Solvay Conference in Brussels, a gathering of the world's top physicists.\n\nEinstein at his office, University of Berlin, 1920\n\nEinstein's views about religious belief have been collected from interviews and original writings.\n\nEinstein developed an appreciation of music at an early age.\n\nEinstein conducted other investigations that were unsuccessful and abandoned.\n\nEinstein's political view was in favor of socialism and critical of capitalism, which he detailed in his essays such as \"Why Socialism?\".[128][129] Einstein offered to and was called on to give judgments and opinions on matters often unrelated to theoretical physics or mathematics.[130]\n\nMainstream physics, in turn, largely ignored Einstein's approaches to unification.\n\nAt the age of eight, he was transferred to the Luitpold Gymnasium (now known as the Albert Einstein Gymnasium), where he received advanced primary and secondary school education until he left Germany seven years later.[11] Contrary to popular suggestions that he had struggled with early speech difficulties, the Albert Einstein Archives indicate he excelled at the first school that he attended.[12] He was right-handed;[12][13] there appears to be no evidence for the widespread popular belief[14] that he was left-handed.\n\nArnold Sommerfeld identified this adiabatic invariant as the action variable of classical mechanics. Wave–particle duality\n\nAfter Ernest Rutherford discovered the nucleus and proposed that electrons orbit like planets, Niels Bohr was able to show that the same quantum mechanical postulates introduced by Planck and developed by Einstein would explain the discrete motion of electrons in atoms, and the periodic table of the elements.\n\nWhen the family moved to Pavia, Einstein stayed in Munich to finish his studies at the Luitpold Gymnasium.\n\nIn 1916, Einstein was appointed president of the German Physical Society (1916–1918).[49][50]\n\nIn May 1904, the couple's first son, Hans Albert Einstein, was born in Bern, Switzerland.\n\nEinstein was aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscillations would be different, but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics.\n\nHe gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations, and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only.\n\nIf one end of a wormhole was positively charged, the other end would be negatively charged.\n\nGeneral relativity (GR) is a theory of gravitation that was developed by Albert Einstein between 1907 and 1915.\n\n\"Einstein fell in love\" with Mozart's music, notes Botstein, and learned to play music more willingly.\n\nEinstein noted that Bose's statistics applied to some atoms as well as to the proposed light particles, and submitted his translation of Bose's paper to the Zeitschrift für Physik.\n\nUniversity of Zurich Charles University in Prague ETH Zurich Caltech\n\nCasual group shot of four men and two women standing on a brick pavement.\n\nIn another letter he writes, \"In my whole life I have never felt so Jewish as now.\"[58]\n\nThroughout his life, Einstein published hundreds of books and articles.[8][10] In addition to the work he did by himself he also collaborated with other scientists on additional projects including the Bose–Einstein statistics, the Einstein refrigerator and others.[91] 1905 – Annus Mirabilis papers\n\nBlack circle covering the sun, rays visible around it, in a dark sky.\n\nThese pertain to force, superconductivity, gravitational waves, and other research.\n\nWien had shown that the hypothesis of adiabatic invariance of a thermal equilibrium state allows all the blackbody curves at different temperature to be derived from one another by a simple shifting process.\n\nEinstein suggested to Erwin Schrödinger that he might be able to reproduce the statistics of a Bose–Einstein gas by considering a box.\n\nSimultaneously less elegant and more difficult than general relativity, after more than two years of intensive work Einstein abandoned the theory in November 1915 after realizing that the hole argument was mistaken.[107] Cosmology Main article: Cosmology\n\nMargot Einstein permitted the personal letters to be made available to the public, but requested that it not be done until twenty years after her death (she died in 1986[139]).\n\nI get most joy in life out of music.\n\nTo fix this, Einstein modified the general theory by introducing a new notion, the cosmological constant, which he called ''Lambda''.[108] The purpose of Lambda was to rectify the effects of gravity and allow the whole system to stay balanced.\n\nQuantizing these oscillators, each level will have an integer occupation number, which will be the number of particles in it. This formulation is a form of second quantization, but it predates modern quantum mechanics.\n\nBut he does suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results, notably the photoelectric effect.[102]\n\nEnergy momentum pseudotensor\n\nAs a physical principle, it was shown to be incorrect when the Aspect experiment of 1982 confirmed Bell's theorem, which had been promulgated in 1964.\n\nIn 1894, his father's company failed: direct current (DC) lost the War of Currents to alternating current (AC).\n\nEinstein concluded that each wave of frequency f is associated with a collection of photons with energy hf each, where h is Planck's constant.\n\nThe energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether's presecriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason.\n\nThis argument is called the Equivalence principle.\n\nIn 1917, Einstein applied the General theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe as a whole.\n\nAt the end of December 1894, he travelled to Italy to join his family in Pavia, convincing the school to let him go by using a doctor's note.[19] It was during his time in Italy that he wrote a short essay with the title \"On the Investigation of the State of the Ether in a Magnetic Field.\"[20][21]\n\nHe became a full professor at Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague in 1911.\n\nWhile developing general relativity, Einstein became confused about the gauge invariance in the theory.\n\nHe had shown that general relativity incorporates Mach's principle to a certain extent in frame dragging by gravitomagnetic fields, but he knew that Mach's idea would not work if space goes on forever.\n\nEinstein became an American citizen in 1940.\n\nHe wrote to Stephen Brunauer, the research chemist who recruited him, that he hoped to avoid visits to Washington, D.C., \"knowing that I would be very much molested by snobbish people\".[77]\n\nIn 1901, his paper \"Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen\" (\"Conclusions from the Capillarity Phenomena\") was published in the prestigious Annalen der Physik.[42][43] On 30 April 1905, Einstein completed his thesis, with Alfred Kleiner, Professor of Experimental Physics, serving as pro-forma advisor.\n\nWhat makes the new arrival devoted to this country is the democratic trait among the people.\n\nI consider this the greatest day of my life.\n\nEinstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications, among them the Bose–Einstein condensate phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures.[119] It was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by Eric Allin Cornell and Carl Wieman using ultra-cooling equipment built at the NIST–JILA laboratory at the University of Colorado at Boulder.[120] Bose–Einstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of bosons.\n\nAfter graduating, Einstein spent almost two frustrating years searching for a teaching post.\n\nTwo papers he published in 1902–1903 (thermodynamics) attempted to interpret atomic phenomena from a statistical point of view.\n\nThis modification was made by Einstein and Cartan in the 1920s. Equations of motion Main article: Einstein–Infeld–Hoffmann equations\n\nSee also: Principle of equivalence, Theory of relativity, and Einstein field equations\n\nThey confirmed that this leads the bar to rotate, because the electron's angular momentum changes as the magnetization changes.\n\nIn 1908, he became a Privatdozent at the University of Bern.[104] In \"über die Entwicklung unserer Anschauungen über das Wesen und die Konstitution der Strahlung\" (\"The Development of our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation\"), on the quantization of light, and in an earlier 1909 paper, Einstein showed that Max Planck's energy quanta must have well-defined momenta and act in some respects as independent, point-like particles.\n\nModern quantum theory Main article: Schrödinger equation\n\nEinstein believed a spherical static universe is philosophically preferred, because it would obey Mach's principle.\n\nThe photoelectric effect.\n\nHistorical Museum of Bern (Einstein museum) History of gravitational theory\n\nThe Einstein Theory of Relativity (educational film about the theory of relativity) Heinrich Burkhardt\n\nUncle Jakob challenged Albert with mathematical problems, which he solved with 'a deep feeling of happiness'.\"\n\nSticky bead argument P vip.svgBiography portal Stylised Lithium Atom.svgPhysics portal Nuvola apps kalzium.svgScience portal Notes\n\nJump up ^ \"Albert's intellectual growth was strongly fostered at home.\n\nThe theory of general relativity has a fundamental law—the Einstein equations which describe how space curves, the geodesic equation which describes how particles move may be derived from the Einstein equations.\n\nEinstein–Cartan theory\n\nNathan Rosen\n\nEinstein's light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists, including Max Planck and Niels Bohr.\n\nFor Einstein, \"war was a disease ... [and] he called for resistance to war.\"\n\nMarić returned to Switzerland without the child, whose real name and fate are unknown.\n\nEinstein received numerous awards and honors, including the Nobel Prize in Physics.\n\nThese properties led Einstein to believe that pairs of particles and antiparticles could be described in this way.\n\nHe apprehended that his equations predicted the universe to be either contracting or expanding.\n\nMain articles: Annus Mirabilis papers, Photoelectric effect, Special theory of relativity, Mass–energy equivalence, and Brownian motion\n\nOn 7 November 1919, the leading British newspaper The Times printed a banner headline that read: \"Revolution in Science – New Theory of the Universe – Newtonian Ideas Overthrown\".[51] Much later, questions were raised whether the measurements had been accurate enough to support Einstein's theory.\n\nOther investigations\n\nThese solutions cut and pasted Schwarzschild black holes to make a bridge between two patches.\n\nHe wanted the universe to be eternal and unchanging, but this type of universe is not consistent with relativity.\n\nWith so many other Jewish scientists now forced by circumstances to live in America, often working side by side, Einstein wrote to a friend, \"For me the most beautiful thing is to be in contact with a few fine Jews—a few millennia of a civilized past do mean something after all.\"\n\nHis mother played the piano reasonably well and wanted her son to learn the violin, not only to instill in him a love of music but also to help him assimilate German culture.\n\nHe failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the examination,[22] but obtained exceptional grades in physics and mathematics.[23] On the advice of the Principal of the Polytechnic, he attended the Aargau Cantonal School in Aarau, Switzerland, in 1895–96 to complete his secondary schooling.\n\nIt became the only country to successfully develop an atomic bomb during World War II.\n\nThis principle distilled the essence of Einstein's objection to quantum mechanics.\n\n\"He was greeted with great British pomp, as if he were a head of state rather than a theoretical physicist\", writes Isaacson.\n\nToday, I have been made happy by the sight of the Jewish people learning to recognize themselves and to make themselves recognized as a force in the world.[58]:308\n\nThe research paper was titled ''\"Zum kosmologischen Problem\"'' (\"About the Cosmological Problem\").[113][114] And Einstein proposed a revision of his model, still with a cosmological constant, but now the constant was responsible for the creation of new matter as the universe expanded.\n\nThis argument, which was made in 1913 in collaboration with Otto Stern, was based on the thermodynamics of a diatomic molecule which can split apart into two free atoms.\n\nGeneral relativity and the equivalence principle Main article: History of general relativity\n\nMach's principle has generated much controversy over the years.\n\nThe letter is believed to be \"arguably the key stimulus for the U.S. adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II\".[73] In addition to the letter, Einstein used his connections with the Belgian Royal Family[74] and the Belgian queen mother[69] to get access with a personal envoy to the White House's Oval Office.[69] President Roosevelt could not take the risk of allowing Hitler to possess atomic bombs first.\n\nEinstein, sitting at a table, looks up from the papers he is reading and into the camera.\n\nHole argument and Entwurf theory Main article: Hole argument\n\nIn that article, he argued that free fall is really inertial motion, and that for a freefalling observer the rules of special relativity must apply.\n\nHe then used a hypothesis of local realism to conclude that the other particle had these properties already determined. The principle he proposed is that if it is possible to determine what the answer to a position or momentum measurement would be, without in any way disturbing the particle, then the particle actually has values of position or momentum.\n\nIn 1926, Einstein and his former student Leó Szilárd co-invented (and in 1930, patented) the Einstein refrigerator.\n\nIn 1914, Einstein moved to Berlin, while his wife remained in Zurich with their sons.\n\nEinstein notation\n\nAccording to Isaacson, he recognized the \"right of individuals to say and think what they pleased\", without social barriers, and as a result, the individual was \"encouraged\" to be more creative, a trait he valued from his own early education. Einstein wrote:[58]:432\n\nThe Bohr–Einstein debates were a series of public disputes about quantum mechanics between Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr who were two of its founders. Their debates are remembered because of their importance to the philosophy of science.[125][126][127] Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox Main article: EPR paradox In 1935, Einstein returned to the question of quantum mechanics. He considered how a measurement on one of two entangled particles would affect the other.\n\nHis father once showed him a pocket compass; Einstein realized that there must be something causing the needle to move, despite the apparent \"empty space\".[15] As he grew, Einstein built models and mechanical devices for fun and began to show a talent for mathematics.[10] When Einstein was ten years old, Max Talmud (later changed to Max Talmey), a poor Jewish medical student from Poland, was introduced to the Einstein family by his brother.\n\nWith a few friends he had met in Bern, Einstein started a small discussion group, self-mockingly named \"The Olympia Academy\", which met regularly to discuss science and philosophy.\n\nTheir readings included the works of Henri Poincaré, Ernst Mach, and David Hume, which influenced his scientific and philosophical outlook.\n\nBy 1908, he was recognized as a leading scientist, and he was appointed lecturer at the University of Bern.\n\nIn 1980 historians John Earman and Clark Glymour published an analysis suggesting that Eddington had suppressed unfavorable results.[52] The two reviewers found possible flaws in Eddington's selection of data, but their doubts, although widely quoted and, indeed, now with a \"mythical\" status almost equivalent to the status of the original observations, have not been confirmed.[53][54] Eddington's selection from the data seems valid and his team indeed made astronomical measurements verifying the theory.[55]\n\nPhotons and energy quanta\n\nHis affiliation with the Institute for Advanced Study would last until his death in 1955.[68] He was one of the four first selected (two of the others being John von Neumann and Kurt Gödel) at the new Institute, where he soon developed a close friendship with Gödel.\n\nBefore, I have always found something to regret in the Jewish soul, and that is the forgetfulness of its own people.\n\nPortrait taken in 1935 in Princeton\n\nTitle (translated) Area of focus Received Published Significance\n\nEinstein–de Haas experiment Main article: Einstein–de Haas effect\n\nIn 1939, a group of Hungarian scientists that included émigré physicist Leó Szilárd attempted to alert Washington of ongoing Nazi atomic bomb research. The group's warnings were discounted.[69] Einstein and Szilárd, along with other refugees such as Edward Teller and Eugene Wigner, \"regarded it as their responsibility to alert Americans to the possibility that German scientists might win the race to build an atomic bomb, and to warn that Hitler would be more than willing to resort to such a weapon.\"[57]:630[70] On July 12, 1939, a few months before the beginning of World War II in Europe, Szilárd and Wigner visited Einstein[71] and they explained the possibility of atomic bombs, to which pacifist Einstein replied: Daran habe ich gar nicht gedacht (\"I had not thought of that at all\").[72] Einstein was persuaded to lend his prestige by writing a letter with Szilárd to President Franklin D. Roosevelt to alert him of the possibility.\n\nIn 1921, Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, as relativity was considered still somewhat controversial.\n\nIn October 1933 he returned to the U.S. and took up a position at the Institute for Advanced Study (in Princeton, New Jersey), that required his presence for six months each year.[64][65] He was still undecided on his future (he had offers from European universities, including Oxford), but in 1935 he arrived at the decision to remain permanently in the United States and apply for citizenship.[66][67]\n\nOver the next few years, Einstein and Marić's friendship developed into romance, and they read books together on extra-curricular physics in which Einstein was taking an increasing interest.\n\nHis travels included Singapore, Ceylon, and Japan, where he gave a series of lectures to thousands of Japanese.\n\nDuring 1911, he had calculated that, based on his new theory of general relativity, light from another star would be bent by the Sun's gravity.\n\nThey divorced on 14 February 1919, having lived apart for five years.\n\nDuring one reception given to him, the building was \"stormed by throngs who wanted to hear him\".\n\nHe noted, along with his collaborators, that by performing different measurements on the distant particle, either of position or momentum, different properties of the entangled partner could be discovered without disturbing it in any way.\n\nAcademic career\n\nThere was always with him a wonderful purity at once childlike and profoundly stubborn.\"[90]\n\nEinstein contributed to these developments by linking them with the 1898 arguments Wilhelm Wien had made.\n\nAlso in 1911, corrections of algebraic errors in his thesis brought Einstein's Avogadro constant estimate to 6.6×1023.\n\nThis included a cannon salute upon his arrival at the residence of the British high commissioner, Sir Herbert Samuel.\n\nEinstein's future wife, Mileva Marić, also enrolled at the Polytechnic that same year, the only woman among the six students in the mathematics and physics section of the teaching diploma course.\n\nI have done my share, it is time to go.\n\nIn 1924, Einstein received a description of a statistical model from Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose, based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles.\n\nEinstein refrigerator\n\nTheir second son, Eduard, was born in Zurich in July 1910.\n\nEinstein was awarded a PhD by the University of Zürich.\n\nHe became a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences.\n\nEmigration to U.S. in 1933\n\nMain article: Old quantum theory\n\nEinstein noted in 1911 that the same adiabatic principle shows

such as the deflection of light by massive bodies were predicted.\n\nThese included Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, and Euclid's Elements (which Einstein called the \"holy little geometry book\").[16][17][fn 1]\n\nHe and his wife Elsa returned by ship to Belgium at the end of March.\n\nEinstein and Marić married in January 1903.\n\nHis dissertation was entitled \"A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions.\"[44][45] This paper included Einstein's initial estimates of Avogadro constant as 2.2×1023 based on diffusion coefficients and viscosities of sugar solutions in water.[46] That same year, which has been called Einstein's annus mirabilis (miracle year), he published four groundbreaking papers, on the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity, and the equivalence of mass and energy, which were to bring him to the notice of the academic world.\n\n(Albert's sister Maja later married Wintelers' son Paul.)[24] In January 1896, with his father's approval, he renounced his citizenship in the German Kingdom of Württemberg to avoid military service.[25] In September 1896, he passed the Swiss Matura with mostly good grades, including a top grade of 6 in physics and mathematical subjects, on a scale of 1-6,[26] and, though only seventeen, enrolled in the four-year mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Zürich Polytechnic.\n\nHe went on to deliver several lectures at Columbia University and Princeton University, and in Washington he accompanied representatives of the National Academy of Science on a visit to the White House.\n\nZero-point energy Main article: Zero-point energy\n\nWhile lodging with the family of Professor Jost Winteler, he fell in love with Winteler's daughter, Marie.\n\nHe later wrote that the spirit of learning and creative thought were lost in strict rote learning.\n\nIn 1914, he returned to Germany after being appointed director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics (1914–1932)[48] and a professor at the Humboldt University of Berlin, with a special clause in his contract that freed him from most teaching obligations.\n\nAt the critical point, this derivative is

On her death, Liszt wrote his Elegy on Marie Kalergi.[1]\n\nDescendants[edit] Maria Kalergis' grandson, Jan Henryk Maria Count Coudenhove, with Emperor Franz Josef's permission, changed his surname to Coudenhove-Calergi.\n\nHe married a Japanese lady, Mitsuko Aoyama.\n\nTheir son, Count Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi, in 1923 founded the Paneuropean Union.\n\nTHIS IS A TEXT NUMBER 04\n\nUSS Tautog (SS-199), a Tambor-class submarine, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the tautog, a small edible sport fish, which is also called a blackfish.\n\nThe sound of approaching high-speed propellers and a closing patrol plane convinced the submarine that it was time to depart.\n\nThe submarine approached the wreckage and rescued one survivor who identified the ship as the motor torpedo boat tender Shuri Maru (1,800 tons),[37] en route from Tsingtao to Sasebo.\n\nTautog maneuvered to silhouette the target against the moon and attacked with two torpedoes and then watched the ship sink.\n\nHer score for the patrol was three ships for 8,500 tons (postwar, two for 3,300).[38]\n\nTautog completed her patrol at Midway on 1 February 1945 and was assigned to training duty.\n\nOne hit blew off the enemy's bow.\n\nShe fired another torpedo from a range of 700 yards (640 m); and the loaded troopship, Transport Number 15, disintegrated.\n\n1 Construction\n\nShe transferred to the Atlantic in November 1945, a few months after Japan's surrender, and was decommissioned in December.\n\nOn 11 January, Tautog intercepted two freighters and launched three torpedoes at the first and larger, and one at the second.\n\nOn 2 August, Tautog sighted several ships off Miki Saki.\n\nOn 11 November, she launched a torpedo at another passenger/cargo ship.\n\nEleventh patrol[edit]\n\nShe launched three torpedoes at a freighter from a range of 800 yards (730 m).\n\nThe submarine launched four torpedoes from a range of 2,000 yards (1,800 m).\n\nDuring the night of 2 November, Tautog laid mines off Haiphong, Indochina, with several exploding as they were emplaced.\n\nThe first hit caused a secondary explosion which obscured the target, and the second raised a column of black smoke.\n\nOn 13 March, Tautog tracked a freighter until she reached a good position for an attack and then launched three torpedoes from 1,500 yards (1,400 m), of which two hit and stopped Ryua Maru.\n\nOn 13 January 1942, she launched three torpedoes at a small minelayer, receiving a depth charging in return.\n\nThe next day, Tautog damaged a tanker but could not evaluate the damage as she had to evade enemy escorts that were approaching.\n\nOn her way back to Midway Island, the submarine sank a wooden trawler with her deck guns.\n\nOn 2 March, the submarine shifted her operations to Pearl Harbor to assist aircraft in anti-submarine warfare for one month before heading for the United States.\n\nShe attained a position and fired a spread of three torpedoes.\n\nOn 27 October, Tautog tracked a passenger-cargo ship until dark and launched two torpedoes into her.\n\nOn 8 May, amid \"swarms of ships\"[31] the submarine contacted a convoy bound for Esan Saki.\n\n2 Operational history\n\nThe next day, Tautog was patrolling on the surface near Simusu Shima, when she sighted a ship coming over the horizon.\n\nOn 20 May, she sank a sampan with her deck guns.\n\nOn 20 October, her lookouts spotted the dim outline of a ship through a rain squall.\n\nThe bright moonlight of 20 January disclosed an enemy ship at a range of 10,000 yards (9,100 m).\n\nTautog sighted two ships departing Truk on 22 May and made a submerged sound attack on the larger.\n\nOn 22 October, she surfaced near Fais Island to shell a phosphate plant.\n\nShe fired torpedoes at the largest ship.\n\nOn 9 April 1942, Tautog headed westward toward Hawaii and started her next war patrol upon leaving Pearl Harbor 15 days later.\n\nThree days later, Tautog made an attack from periscope depth against a cargo ship.\n\nTautog's first war patrol began on 26 December 1941 and took her to the Marshall Islands for reconnaissance work.\n\nAround 10:00 on 26 April near Johnston Island, while en route to her station, Tautog sighted the periscope of an enemy submarine, apparently maneuvering to reach a favorable firing position.\n\nOn 17 January 1945, Tautog sighted a ship heading toward her.\n\nOn 27 December, she fired a spread of three torpedoes at a freighter and made a similar attack on a passenger ship.\n\nThe Filipinos swam over to the submarine and later enlisted in the United States Navy.\n\nFifth patrol[edit]\n\nThe submarine ran up her periscope, but an explosion filled the air with debris and obscured Saishu Maru from view as the freighter sank.\n\n3 First patrol\n\nHer third war patrol, conducted from 17 July to 10 September 1942, took Tautog to the coast of Indochina, where (in part due to torpedo shortages) she laid mines.\n\nShe sank Submarine Chaser Number 30 on 4 November.[28] and subsequently damaged a tanker and three cargo ships.\n\n4 Second patrol\n\nFourth patrol[edit]\n\n5 Third patrol\n\nOn 5 January 1943, Tautog sighted a sail off her port bow and promptly closed the ship. It turned out to be a native craft with a dozen Muslim sailors, four women, several babies, some chickens, and a goat on board.\n\n\"Barney\" Sieglaff, on his first war patrol)[19] to the Java Sea, near Ambon Island, Timor Island, and Celebes Island.\n\nShe submerged, closed the range, identified the ship as a coastal steamer.\n\nOn 6 June, the submarine fired a spread of three torpedoes at a cargo ship off the entrance to Basalin Strait.\n\nSurfacing, the sub fired 21 5\" shells into the target, starting a fire and causing an explosion that blew off the target's stern.\n\nTautog's next patrol was conducted in Makassar Strait and around Balikpapan (where she again laid mines)[24] from 24 February 1943 to 19 April.\n\nOn 7 September, she headed for San Francisco to join the Pacific Reserve Fleet.\n\nTautog stood out of Fremantle on 11 May 1943 and headed for a patrol area that included the Flores Sea, the Gulf of Boni, the Molucca Sea, the Celebes Sea, and the Moru Gulf.\n\nOn 7 October 1943, Tautog departed Pearl Harbor to patrol in waters near the Palau Islands.\n\nShe then rescued six survivors from a swamped lifeboat who identified their ship as the Hokoriu Maru, en route from the Bonin Islands to Tokyo laden with coconut oil.\n\nOn 9 January at 08:38, Tautog (relying on ULTRA) sighted a Natori-class cruiser off Ambon Island, at a range of about 3,000 yards (2,700 m).\n\nTautog's ninth war patrol began on 12 December 1943 and took her to Japanese home waters, southeast of Shikoku Island and along the southern coast of Honshū.\n\nLater in the morning, Tautog sighted another submarine with the designation \"I-28\" clearly discernible on its conning tower.[12] Just as I-28 fired at Tautog, the American boat launched two torpedoes, then went to 150 feet (46 m) to avoid.[10] One torpedo missed,[10] the second sent the Japanese boat to the bottom,[12] making her the third sunk by Pacific Fleet submarines.[13]\n\nWhen Tautog returned to Pearl Harbor, she was credited with four ships sunk for 20,500 tons (postwar reduced to 16,100).[34]\n\nOn 21 October, she and Thresher (SS-200) stood out to sea, under sealed orders, to begin a 45-day, full-time, simulated war patrol in the area of Midway Island.\n\nShe called at Midway and Saipan before taking her patrol station (in company with Silversides)[36] in the East China Sea.\n\nHer spread of torpedoes sent Shoka Maru to the bottom. The patrol ended at Fremantle on 11 June.\n\nShe also laid mines off Haiphong and suffered through a depth charge attack in November 1942.\n\nTautog arrived there on 10 August, credited with a disappointing two ships for 4,300 tons (postwar reduced to 2,800);[35] she was routed to the United States for overhaul.\n\nTautog was officially credited with sinking Shirakumo (1,750 tons)[32] and the passenger/cargo ship Nichiren Maru, bringing her total for the patrol to five ships for 17,700 tons (reduced postwar to four for 11,300),[33] one of the most aggressive, and successful, of the war.\n\nAn hour later, Tautog fired two more and scored another hit. The 5,973-ton Army cargo ship Ryoyo Maru[31] settled in 24 feet (7.3 m) of water, decks awash.\n\nEighth patrol[edit]\n\nThe next morning, Tautog made radar contact in a heavy fog, closing the enemy ship and firing four torpedoes; two hit the target.\n\nThe Japanese were ordered to take to their boats but refused to do so. Three shells fired in the schooner's stern disabled her rudder and propeller.\n\nTwo hits sent Banshu Alaru Number 2 to the bottom.\n\nThe target refused to sink, even after Tautog fired four more torpedoes into \"the rubber ship\".[31] To avoid wasting more precious torpedoes, the submarine surfaced and finished the job with her 5\" gun.\n\nShe returned to New London, Connecticut and operated from that base until early February 1941 when she was ordered to the Virgin Islands.\n\nAfter calls at Coco Solo, Canal Zone, and San Diego, California, they arrived at Pearl Harbor on 6 June 1941.\n\nFor 38 consecutive days, the two submarines operated submerged for 16 to 18 hours each day.\n\nThird patrol[edit]\n\nThe submarine circled for a follow-up shot, but this was difficult as the water was covered with gasoline drums, debris, and life rafts.\n\nShe was launched on 27 January 1940 (sponsored by Mrs. Richard S. Edwards), and commissioned on 3 July 1940 with Lieutenant Joseph H. Willingham (Class of 1926)[6] in command.\n\nFirst patrol[edit]\n\nSecond patrol[edit]\n\nTautog expended three additional torpedoes on a freighter, but missed.[25] On 9 April in the Celebes Sea off Boston Island, Tautog contacted a convoy of five ships.\n\nOn 8 July, she stopped a small freighter dead in the water with one spread of torpedoes and followed with another spread that sank the ship.\n\nThe victim was later identified as Hasshu Maru, a former Dutch passenger-cargo ship which had been taken over by the Japanese.\n\nSold some months later, she was scrapped at Manistee, Michigan, during the early 1960s.\n\nA profligate spread of six torpedoes produced four hits which broke Usa Maru in half.\n\nAfter 26 days in the area gathering information, particularly of Kwajalein, she reported no enemy activity at Rongelop, Bat, Wotho, or Bikini.\n\nTautog was back in Pearl Harbor in early December and, on 17 December 1944, began her 13th and last war patrol.\n\nThe submarine was towed to Wisconsin and arrived at Milwaukee on 26 December 1947. She provided immobile service at the Great Lakes Naval Reserve Training Center for the next decade.\n\nLater in the patrol, in the Salajar Strait, Tautog spotted a second cruiser (again thanks to ULTRA), and launched four torpedoes in heavy seas; all missed.[21] She sighted a freighter on 22 January in the Banda Sea, and three of the submarine's torpedoes sent her to the bottom.\n\nOn 2 May, she sighted a cargo ship in a small harbor between Banjo To and Matsuwa To.\n\nTwo days later, on Sunday, 7 December, Tautog was at the Submarine Base when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor.\n\n8 Sixth patrol 9 Seventh patrol\n\n6 Fourth patrol 7 Fifth patrol\n\nThis patrol was no more successful; despite six torpedo and three gun attacks, she only sank two confirmed ships for 14,300 tons (reduced to 5,300 tons postwar).[27] The submarine was then routed back to the United States for an overhaul at Hunter's Point Navy Yard.\n\nShortly after her arrival in the Marshalls, Tautog was ordered to Truk to intercept ships returning from the Battle of the Coral Sea, especially the Japanese aircraft carriers Zuikauku and Shōkaku (the latter codenamed \"Wounded Bear\");[9] because Pearl Harbor underestimated Shōkaku's speed, Tautog and two compatriots arrived too late and did not see Shōkaku depart, on 11 or 12 May.[10] South of the harbor, Tautog launched two torpedoes at Goyo Maru, scoring one hit and suffering a circular run (typical of the erratic Mark XIV torpedo), forcing Tautog deep.[10] (Goyo Maru beached herself.)[11] Two days later, Tautog was alerted by ULTRA of four Japanese submarines in the vicinity, also returning from battle.[10] She was caught by surprise by the first, and failed to attack.[10] She detected and fired two torpeodes at the second.\n\nOne of the most successful submarines of World War II, Tautog was credited with sinking 26 Japanese ships,[5] for a total of 72,606 tons, scoring first by number of ships and eleventh by tonnage[6] earning her the nickname \"The Terrible T.\"\n\nWhile she was attempting this, another ship came over the horizon to rescue survivors.[25] Leaving the bait sitting, Tautog dived and began a submerged approach, firing a spread of three torpedoes; cargo ship Shojen Maru sank, more quickly than her inexplicably durable sister.[25] As the sub headed homeward on the night of 16 March, Tautog made radar contact on a convoy of seven ships off Hokkaidō.\n\nWith all torpedoes expended, Tautog tracked a convoy for two days while radioing its position back to Pearl Harbor before she returned to Midway Island on 18 November. Ninth patrol[edit]\n\n12 Tenth patrol 13 Eleventh patrol\n\nThe next day, Tautog made radar contact with a ship and tracked the target while working toward a good firing position.\n\nThe Japanese then launched a boat, were given water, and directed to the nearest land.\n\nFollowing an overhaul at San Francisco, California, Tautog resumed operations from Pearl Harbor in October 1943, sinking Submarine Chaser # 30 and damaging a tanker and three freighters during this cruise, her eighth of the war.\n\n14 Twelfth patrol 15 Thirteenth patrol 16 Fate\n\nTautog's assignment for her tenth war patrol took her to the cold waters of the northern Pacific near the Kuril Islands, from Paramushiro south to the main islands of Japan and the northeast coast of Hokkaidō.\n\n19 External links Construction[edit]\n\nShe returned to Pearl Harbor for a refit by Bushnell (AS-15) on 30 January, credited with two ships for 9,700 tons (postwar, 6,000).[29] Tenth patrol[edit]\n\nShe was credited with one ship of 5,100 tons; postwar, it was reduced to 4,000 tons.[18]\n\nWhen Tautog opened fire to sink the ship, several more Japanese emerged and scrambled into the boat. Ten more rounds left the schooner a burning hulk.\n\nWhen Tautog last saw Fushimi Maru (5,000 tons)[31] through the fog, her bow was in the air.\n\nHer next four patrols, in December 1943 - August 1944, took her to the Japanese home islands, including the chilly northern Pacific.\n\nHer keel was laid down on 1 March 1939 at Groton, Connecticut, by the Electric Boat Company.\n\nEscorts forced Tautog deep and depth charged her for seven hours without doing any damage.\n\nOne hit, slowed the target, and two more torpedoes left Miyazaki Maru (4,000 tons)[31] sinking by the stern.\n\nTautog was placed out of service and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 11 September 1959. On 15 November 1959, she was sold to the Bultema Dock and Dredge Company of Manistee, Michigan, for scrap.\n\nSixth patrol[edit] Isonami, sunk by Tautog 9 April 1943.\n\nOne hit obscured the target.\n\nShe was credited with six ships sunk for 19,500 tons; postwar, this was reduced to three for 7,500 tons.[14]\n\nA lone survivor, taken on board the submarine, identified the ship as Matsu Maru which was transporting a load of lumber from Tokyo to Muroran.\n\nFate[edit] Plans to use Tautog as a target during atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll in 1946 were cancelled, and she was assigned to the Ninth Naval District on 9 May 1947 as a reserve training ship.\n\nThe first torpedo scored a hit 20 seconds after being fired and a yellowish-green flash went up amidships of Shinei Maru as she went down.\n\nOn 17 March, she sighted a grounded tanker with topside damage from an air attack.\n\nFive explosions close aboard caused extensive minor damage. The submarine returned to Fremantle ten days later for repair and refit.\n\nAgain loaded with mines, the submarine put to "
