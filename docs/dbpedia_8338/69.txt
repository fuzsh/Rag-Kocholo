CHICAGO Randall Amplifiers, a division of US Music Corp., announced today that they have joined forces with Kirk Hammett of Metallica for a new line of guitar products which will include amps, heads, combos and preamp modules.

"Old-school tones and new-school technology attracted me to the potential that Randall amps have to offer," said guitarist Kirk Hammett. "These considerations are the answer to my continual quest for a well-rounded tonal palette and this flexibility also enables me to make modifications on the spot. I feel tonally emancipated."
