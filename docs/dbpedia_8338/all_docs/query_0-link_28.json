That's insane! My point is, their prices have more than doubled and in some cases more. The RD45 that is now nearly $1400, was $599 when it came out. The Thrasher was 1599, the 50 watt $999. The 50 watt Thrasher is $2034!\n\n667s were like $2600 new weren't they? I wonder a little bit about what their deal with Mike Fortin looked like, and whether he gets a cut of amps that are/were derived from his work with them. Not sure if that applies to any of these amps, but maybe Randall are still trying to recoup that. IDK.\n\n5 watts, made in China? $759? That's insane!

And what's the deal with Fortin?\n\nPoint about MIC is they do all levels of price/quality.\n\nWere previous Randalls not MIC?\n\nNow your post makes more sense.\n\nNew ownership?

I've been saying Randall will be out of business in the coming years. They went to real shit after the Fortin debacle.\n\nJebus! I'll say.\n\nView attachment 85492\n\nParker went out of business, and Washburn pretty much has, aside from acoustics. Eden? Do they still make bass gear? Jay Turdser? They make cheap garbage for beginners.\n\nParker went out of business, and Washburn pretty much has, aside from acoustics. Edin? Do they still make bass gear? Jay Turdser? They make cheap garbage for beginners.\n\nThe big prize is Marshall.\n\nSome of those other brands are probably just loss leaders.\n\nPoint about MIC is they do all levels of price/quality.\n\nIf the factory where said MIC is produced can be proven that the quality of components and work equals other builds in that price range AND, if it can be confirmed that said factory pays the employees a fair and comparable wage of employees of other builders in that price range, it makes a big difference.\n\nUntil then, shut the fuck up CCPDonald\n\nInevitable consequence of global capitalist/neoliberal policies. All of these “developing economies” and “emerging markets” can only be exploited for so long until labor and other costs start to rise. There’s a finite number of underdeveloped countries to jump to and try and keep this thing going.\n\nAt some point there will be no more cost savings or profit margins to squeeze out, either due to our standard of living falling enough or the third world’s rising - or most likely, both.\n\nJapanese stuff now costs what US stuff used to. Korean stuff costs about what Japanese stuff used to. Indo stuff is the new Korean, etc.\n\nJapanese stuff now costs what US stuff used to. Korean stuff costs about what Japanese stuff used to.
