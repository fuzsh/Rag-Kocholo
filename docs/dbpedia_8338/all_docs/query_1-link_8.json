        "text": "Randall Amplifiers will be launching a new Signature Series stack called the Ninja V2, which is designed and inspired by Arch Enemy lead guitarist Michael Amott.\n\nMichael Amott, born in England and raised in the south of Sweden, began playing guitar as a young teenager. Initially inspired by the furious sounds of the 80's thrash/speed metal scene, he has listed guitarists such as Frank Marino, Dave Mustaine, and Michael Schenker as his influences. Amott's style features a wide vibrato, memorable melodic lead lines, furious sledgehammer riffs, and a love for twin guitar harmonies. Said Amott of designing the V2 Ninja stack, \"Working with Randall on the Ninja V2 amp has been nothing short of amazing. These guys are as crazy about the search for crushing tone as I am. I believe I have found my ideal partners in crime!\"\n\nJody Dankberg, Director of Marketing and Artist Relations at Randall Amplifiers, who had the opportunity to work with Amott throughout the development process of the stack said, \"Michael Amott is an amazing player and a huge influence to younger generations. Working with Mike has been a great pleasure to all of us here at Randall. His limited edition half stack sounds and looks incredible. It is a huge honor to have him on our artist roster.\"\n\nThe V2 Ninja Head offers a three channel head which includes a classic solid state clear channel, a classic Randall overdrive channel and an all-tube pre amp channel with \"Attack\" & \"Bright\". It will also feature a midi assignable 6-band graphic EQ and parallel effects loop, a master volume control, power amp density and presence controls and RUBY 12AX7AC5HG pre amp tube. The V2 Ninja Head will retail for $1,599.00. The matching cabinet is a G12H-100 Celestion speaker cabinet and will retail for $1,199.00.\n\nPress Release\n\nSource: US Music Corp\n\nHmmmmm... I do like michael amott's tone quite a lot, but after having seen these guys rather a lot, well, suffice to say that it really does not matter what either of the amott brothers play through, hell, they could make a beat up no name practice amp with a broken metal zone sound good. With those two it's so in the fingers it's unreal.\n\nSo the jury in my case would be out on this one untill i actually hear clips of it played by someone who isn't an amott!\n\nwhats weird about this though is michael nor his brother play a v2 live. When I saw them on the black tyrany tour they both played RM100 modular heads. what modules? hell if i know, but i doubt that they are stock. theyre tone right now is very EL34 colored though. i imagine they could be using any of the marshall inspired modules or maybe even the bogner ecstacy module. still very nice tone, whatever theyre using. as for as tthe tones on ROTT, michael's tone kinda sucks...which is really too bad because i have always loved his tone. i read it some where and in one of the in studio videos he used a Randall V2 and ENGL Blackmore/Savage and an ESP Eclipse loaded with EMG 81/81. totaly not the warm full bodied tone he is known for. as far as chris, sounded like the same stuff he was using prior to his departure: dellinger-CA and Peavey JSX\n\nThe V2s fucking own, I wonder what if anything is different on this one though. It is kinda weird that his model is a V2 though because it's not really like \"his tone\" you know, I don't think of arch enemy when I think of bone-crushing Randall tone, lol.\n\nhaunted cereal: I think these are list prices, Randall's cabs are like $800\n\nI didn't mind the V2 at all. Pretty good setup, specially with the Celestion 100's cab to match. I just really wonder, if the Ninja V2 is that much different from the regular V2?? I assume they \"voice\" it maybe a little different, but from all I've read, they both have the same tubes and eveything in them...... Maybe just slap some new tolex and new colours and it's new?"
