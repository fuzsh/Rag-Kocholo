        "text": "Man-oh-man,\n\nI started a link page of guitar manufacturers for my new website. So far I think I have close to 80 names and I'm still not finished.\n\nI know some of the companies on the list are the Biggies, like fender, marshall, boogie, etc. But there are many, many more smaller guys out there too!!\n\nHow do these guys stay alive? A lot of times these amps are at least double to a Fender or a Marshall. Yea, I know a lot more time and quality probably goes into the making of their amps, but I can't see how they can make enough money to keep themselves a float!!\n\nMaybe it's being a little closed-minded, but I usually always go for a recognizable brand name!"
