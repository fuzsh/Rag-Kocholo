I am sure there are benefits of being part of a larger corporate entity (such as access to capital for expansion and renovations), however there are drawback as well.\n\nIt makes me feel sad that former American iconic factory is now in foreign hands, meaning foreign owners call the shuts at Heritage and can do the same to Heritage as they did to Hamer guitars (stopped US production and moved manufacturing to Asia).\n\nWe often talk about Gibson owning factories in China, well now we have Chinese owning Gibson factory in the US.\n\nIt also makes you think whether this an indication of what the future will be for Gibson and Fender...\n\nThis site may earn a commission from merchant links like Ebay, Amazon, and others.\n\nLeee\n\nExtremism in defense of Liberty is no vice\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 2, 2021\n\nMessages\n\n11,848\n\nReaction score\n\n33,065\n\nAug 6, 2024\n\n#2\n\nI read an article about the guy who was behind acquiring Heritage.\n\nHe’s a guitar guy.\n\nAnd he knows a thing or two about Western culture.\n\nI don’t like it, but it doesn’t creep me out as bad as the rest of the CCP shit does.\n\nStill - 225 Parsons owned by anyone outside the USA?\n\nGrrrrrrrrr…..\n\nNote Milker\n\nSenior Member\n\nJoined\n\nMar 27, 2023\n\nMessages\n\n1,380\n\nReaction score\n\n1,860\n\nAug 6, 2024\n\n#3\n\nScary, sneaky too.
