        "text": "sytharnia1560\":3iqeggt5 said:\n\nRandall are impossible to get in new zealand. Use to be an importer but their customer service was so appalling that now know one wants to deal with them so we can't get them. This was all before the fortin got involved....it appears things haven't changed sadly\n\nIt's pretty appalling here in the states as well, as is their marketing. I have yet to find a demo of the Thrasher 50, ANYWHERE, since it's inception. This Joe Delaney character seems to be a real douche. And if they had it together, I'm sure Fortin wouldn't have bailed. Now, I think they're fucked. No new products in 2 years.\n\nI've owned the RD45H three times, I love that amp and want another!\n\nRandall hasn't been able to really get the amp line off the ground sales wise. They Had Bruce Engater for a while designing their Modular Series (which was their more successful venture) and had Mike Fortin design a bunch of amps based off his more popular designs. But that has been a huge failure for them. And Mike took the hit for it when they let him go. And not Mikes fault at all. They basically took a great design and cheapened it and made it in China, and then charged US prices. No body is going to lay out 1500.00 to 2000 for a Chinese made amp. Jet City had the right Idea, and were priced accordingly. I think Randall tried to take advantage of Mikes name and charge a premium for it. and Randall was extremely pissed when Lynch was a big endorsement artist yet live was seen playing many other amps.\n\nEndorsement deals are simply a way of making income (living). Only reason Lynch still has a ESP endorsement is Matt who is the President of ESP, is George's best friend and former guitar tech.\n\nRandall's product line amp wise is too specific and marketed to the heavy Metal Genre, and the impression most have is Randall's are pure Metal amps and not even suitable for Rock. all though not true, the impression is still there. Who is going to bring the SATAN model to church in a Church band? Nothing at all wrong with Heavy Music, I love it. But from a business perspective, it is an extremely narrow Market and you can't make money on it. The other Amp companies like Marshall, Mesa, Peavey, Soldano, Fender, and others make amps that can be used by any Music genre, not that Randall can't, but they Market to a very small demographic and the cosmetics of their amps is designed for that market.\n\nOf course Randall is just a name, the original Randall amp company really doesn't exist anymore as it was sold of a few times. Randall's biggest hey day was in the early 80's with the fur covered solid state amps and that too faded away until Dimebag brought them into prominence again buy playing them."
