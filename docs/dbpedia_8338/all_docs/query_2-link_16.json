        "text": "I've had tube ( 2 bad ), fuse ( 5 blown ), tolex ( low adhesion ), and module delivery time ( 8 months and counting ) issues with the Lynch Box Head and SPKR Cab... more recently a flickering/dimming power light.\n\nThe spkr cab has been replaced with all tolex issues apparently corrected, the head shell was replaced with tolex issues still present.\n\nI recieved the Grail mod back in November of 06 when I bought and paid in full for the head, cab, and mods. It was 7 months later that I recieved the Mr.Scary and the Brahma mods with the Super V still not in my possession.\n\nOther small but annoying issues are the before mentioned power light issue and a spring retainer for the chassis hold down nut cracked into two pieces and feel inside the head chassis and I had to fish out... no biggie really but very annoying after all that has gone on with this amp.\n\nThe following are my fellings on the Randall MTS line of amps... not all the MTS line but the experience I have had with my Randall MTS product.\n\nFirst I do commend Randall on such an achievment. The Randall MTS line of amps are truely inspiring and well concieved ideas and all at a price that average players looking for a pro rig can afford. The amps look great and sound incredible in my opinion.\n\nBut is tone and good looks enough?\n\nI say no it is not. The truely unavoidable issues lie clearly in Randall's build quality and greatly effect the reliability of these amps.\n\nIf I as a player have a great looking amp that also sounds the biz but am unable to enjoy it because of poor build quality then what purpose does it serve.\n\nI will not take it to a live performance for many other potential Randall customers to see and hear because I feel I cannot rely on it. I cannot and will not talk of it in only good light on the forums. I cannot comment at the music shop as someone inquires about this line of amps and say it is an all around great product... unless I plan on not speaking the truth. If I am approached in any situation in any forum ( meant in the true meaning of the word ) and am asked about the Randall MTS line of amps then I must say it as I see it... I will comment on my experiences and not give this amp a high recommendation... and that is a truely unfortunate thing because these amps have so much potential.\n\nRandall has dropped the ball big time on this product.\n\nI'm hearing stories of guys having trace ccts dremmeled out of the PCB in an attempt to make this amp more reliable... to great success I might add.\n\nWhat happened there... in my opinion Randall fell short on their commitment to the end user by using a poorly designed protection cct.\n\nWhat about the Midi issues ppl are writting in about... more of what Randall is becoming known for... poor build quality.\n\nThen there is the now infamous wait time on the mods. Just tell us up front your having issues and let us know when we can expect to see the mods for real. Not this two weeks, two weeks, two weeks with the reasons not clearly defined and changing over and over.\n\nThere have been spkr cab issues aswell. Early shipped Lynch cabs went out with greenbacks instead of Super V's.\n\nWhats even more alarming is that these issues and some new ones seem to still be rearing their ugly heads while we the valued Randall customer sit and wait with no sound resolve.\n\nWhy are ppl waiting months and months to have a tube replaced under warranty?\n\nWhy are we having replacements done with items that still have issues?\n\nWhen will the mods arrive?\n\nWhy did Randall put so much into a product to only have it fail from a build quality standpoint?\n\nI understand that certain Randall employees have the best intentions and are trying their hardest to resolve the issues with the products and keep their customers happy. After all Randall is solely dependant on it's customers to sustain the life of their business. Bad product equals unhappy customers equals low profit margins and poor sales equals life's not so great at Randall.\n\nIn my opinion the issues lie at the core of Randall's business and it is here where the changes must be made and made very very soon. Customers who are not 100% happy with their Randall product and that have legitimate issues must be given a amicable resolve.\n\nHaving said all that a resolve will be met there is no doubt about that and all Randall's customers will be happy in the end... what I question is how many customers will move on to bigger and better things while Randall sorts out it's mess. Is the resolve moving on? Will there be fewer happy Randall customers?\n\nTo finish on a good note the MTS line of amps is a very cutting edge product with it's modular preamp all tube design that incorperates great tone and awsome looks all at a price that is affordable for what you get.\n\nI really do believe that the Randall Lynch Box is one of the greatest half stacks ever concieved. Much attention to detail has been given with input from inductry giants such as Bruce Egnater and George Lynch along with Randall's own team of Guru's. I consider the Randall Lynch Box to be one of the best sounding and looking tube amps on the market today.\n\nKhing\n\nI had 3 blown fuses and 2 power tubes blow, in the 1st week of owning an RM100. The dealer would NOT refund me nor replace any parts, I was lucky enough to have a family member whos partners with CMI to get someone to look at it, so for the 1st week of owning the amp I had a total of 2 days usage. I feel I cant rely on this amp for ANY gig, which is sad cos it sounds so good.\n\nThat sounds all to familiar...\n\nMy Randall LB will be in the shop again! having too much issues here...do really want to use it live!?... I am think on jumping ship and switching to a Splawn Quick Rod.\n\nI hear ya bro... I've been sent out a new cab which seems to be 99.9% but the new head shell suffers from the same tolex issue be it not as severe... I'm pricing my next amp right now... MCC said that the would be happy to cut me a cheque and refund the total amout for the Lynch Box Head and Modules.\n\nI'm looking at Budda Superdrive, Splawn Quick Rod, Fuchs OD Supreme, and a Soldano SLO. I may keep the cab as I really do love how all my amps sound thru it.\n\nUnfortunatly Randall is just not stepping up to the plate here and solving the problems. Some very good attempts were made and I do truely appreciate them but what good is a great sounding unreliable amp. I've told Randall what I want and it's been over two weeks now with no contact. RD/Rich has done what he can now it's up to Steve and Doug... and HELL NO I'm not gonna just go away.\n\nI agree a recall would be a good move on Randall's behalf. Or how about this... fix the fucking problems and send us all out amps that actually work and are not going to break down until they have seen some use!\n\nI was just offered a new head chassis/electronics... I'm weary of that because it will likely be the same can or worms as I allready have... there goes Randall not solving the true issues again... man it is frustrating.\n\nI cannot and will not accept a baindaid solution.\n\nKhing"
