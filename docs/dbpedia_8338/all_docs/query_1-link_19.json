        "text": "Randall Amplifiers, a division of US Music Corporation, announced today the general availability of the GEORGE LYNCH (ex-DOKKEN, LYNCH MOB) MTS Signature Series Preamp Modules, which allows guitarists to attain his classic tones, ranging from smooth and clean to the heavy rhythm tones characteristic of the Dokken and Lynch Mob eras.\n\nThe George Lynch MTS Series signature preamp modules integrate seamlessly inside Randall's MTS line of guitar amplifiers. Randall's MTS Series of amps includes combos, heads, rackmount units, as well as George Lynch's custom Lynch Box head and cabinet series. Guitarists can load their choice of preamps in any combination, making it simple and easy to capture George's tones with one Randall amplifier. The George Lynch's series includes four different preamp modules for a wide range of tones and flexibility - Super V, Mr. Scary, Grail and Brahma.\n\n\"For over 20 years, Randall has been instrumental in helping me attain the flawless tones I need,\" said guitarist George Lynch. \"Our partnership started during Dokken's 1984 US tour, and I'm proud to continue a relationship that will deliver my distinctive sounds to fellow musicians around the globe.\"\n\nThe Randall MTS Series makes it quick and simple for musicians to radically change their sound - without purchasing additional amps - by allowing them to easily swap different MTS Series preamp modules into their amp. MTS modules are based on tone circuits from Fender, Marshall, Vox and Randall amplifiers as well as the signature sounds of legendary guitar players such George Lynch.\n\n\"Many of us at Randall are huge fans of George Lynch, so we're honored to collaborate with such a respected and innovative guitar player,\" said Doug Reynolds, Randall Division Manager. \"The partnership enhances our MTS Signature Series by giving our customers the ability to capture the sounds and tones of one of rocks most influential artist.\"\n\nFor more details on the MTS Series visit this location."
