        "text": "Plugging two guitars into a guitar amplifier that is designed for one guitar at a time, can be done - but it's not recommended for reasons suggested in other answers.\n\nYou can find many guitar amps billed as \"two channel\" amps, but many of these are still intended to amplify only one guitar at a time. They might have a \"clean\" channel and a \"dirty\" channel and are intended for one guitar to be able to play through either one or the other. But they only have one set of controls so plugging a guitar into each channel is probably not a good solution for what you are trying to accomplish.\n\nHowever, there are amplifiers available that have two independent channels - each with its own separate preamp and each with its own set of individual controls for the intended purpose of amplifying two separate instruments. Most of these true two channel/two preamp combos are billed as \"acoustic\" amps but are fully capable of amplifying any electric guitar. They just won't have the \"dirty\" distortion/overdrive effect that an electric guitar amp might have, but you can use a distortion pedal to get that effect if desired.\n\nIf you choose this solution, be sure the amp has two instrument inputs. Many of the \"acoustic\" amps have an XLR input for one of the channels so you can use it for guitar and vocal. But many of these also have an instrument input available to use on the channel with the XLR (use one or the other). You also want to be sure each channel has its own dedicated volume and tone controls.\n\nUsing a two channel amp with dedicated controls for each of two guitars would allow you and your student to both plug in to the same amp and then adjust the tone and volume independently for each guitar.\n\nBelow are some pictures of a few examples of the type amp I am talking about.\n\nAnother option that might even be more space efficient if you don't mind spending a little more - would be a line array portable PA system such as the Fishman SoloAmp SA 220 (pictured below) which has two channels with dedicated controls. Either of the two channels on the Fishman SA 220 can be used for an instrument or a microphone. Something like this could also be used if you wanted to set up a public recital for an audience to showcase one of your students.\n\nGood luck!\n\nIt is possible to mix the signal of two guitars before going in the amp. You can even plug two simultaneously into a single input with a simple Y-adaptor; you can mix the relative loudness with the volume pots (though it will be fiddly). A small mixer gives much better control, but the impedance of the line input on such mixers is usually rather too low for passive guitars, so don't expect it to sound great.\n\nNote that, no matter how you mix the signals, if they pass the entire preamp together you will get some problems. Obviously, they'll share tone etc. controls; but a much worse issue is that, unless you're operating the amp completely clean, you'll get intermodulation between the two guitars (what papaklas calls “one guitar distorts the other”), and that sounds really weird.\n\nOne good solution, if applicable, is to use the effects loop as an extra point-of-entry. Plug one guitar normally into the amp, and the other into any digital amp simulator. Then route the amp's effect send into the amp-sim's aux in, and the amp-sims output into the amp's effect return. Because the effects loop is usually behind the preamp, you'll only mix the signals after most of the distortion, and thus get relatively clean seperation, as well as separate gain & tone controls: one guitar via the amp, the other via the amp-simulator.\n\nMost answers are focusing on the question as written, i.e can this be done, and the answer is of course yes, with the right equipment.\n\nIt is however, not a good idea, because (even if you avoid issues like distortion intermodulation) having the sound of both guitars coming from the same speaker makes it difficult to distinguish who is playing what. This is especially important for a student, because, without that separation, they may be completely unable to hear when they are playing right, and only hear any grossly out of place notes when they jar with the teacher's playing.\n\nI strongly recommend that the student buy their own practice amp. A quick Google search shows that Fender make a 10W model that retails for 42 GBP (approx 60 USD.) They can (and should) use this at home to practice playing to avoid bad habits such as making pickup noises, playing too hard or not palm muting correctly (playing through an amp is not the same as unplugged.) Once they have their own amp, the issue of playing two guitars through one amp goes away.\n\nThe main problem is that for both guitars to make their impact independently, all shared parts in the signal path need to be \"linear\". The easiest way to do this with a \"single\" amp is by having two independent amps, including power amp and speaker, in one case, like a Peavey Deuce. The problem with that kind of amp is that it doesn't really save space compared to two practice amps because one of its intended operation modes is as a humongous single-instrument amp.\n\nSo the next step is sharing a single power amp and speaker linearly, but having two separate preamps, a two-channel (or more) amp. Where is the problem with that?\n\nWell, it rules out a tube power amp because tube amps are being used exactly for their nonlinearities at higher gain. So you will need to go solid-state (at least for the power-amp stage). In addition, guitar speakers tend to have a comparatively small \"linear excursion\" region, about 10%-20% of their rated voltage range, so you'd want to angle for a large amp in order to then play it at a fraction of its capacity. Again, it will be hard to make this a better fit than two smaller amps.\n\nAll that being said, having two people fiddle around with the same amp is going to be a distraction mechanically and acoustically. Several small practice amps might just be the better sell here."
