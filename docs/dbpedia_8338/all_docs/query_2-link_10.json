        "text": "See I don't know how they couldn't easily revive themselves because as I understand it, the reason Fortin won't make any of his older amplifiers is because Randall now own them. They could easily re-badge the SATAN as nont Ola's signature amplifier or keep going with the Thrasher/667. The Diavlo line was pretty sick as well.\n\nExactly. When EVH left Peavey, it's not like they just stopped making the 5150. Same goes for their T2/V2 amps. They were fantastic hybrid amps but sadly I don't think they stayed in production long enough for them to really catch on. The last guitar amp I ever bought was a T2 and kinda-sorta wished I hadn't sold it but I didn't really have a choice at the time. I needed the cash for a bass rig and even if I did, I had no room in my place at the time to store both a 4x10 and 4x12 cab.\n\nThis is pretty much a crash course in what happens to the smaller, less profitable arms of large companies that are gobbled up by even bigger firms.\n\nAs we all know, Randall is owned by US Music Corp. Well, USMCorp is then owned by JAM Industries, which extends the focus of the business to consumer electronics, pro audio, and large scale distribution, all of those tend to make more money than some niche guitar amps. JAM is then owned by the huge Development Capitol Corporation conglomerate, which does anything from healthcare to petrochemicals.\n\nRight now, and likely for the foreseeable future, Randall (or Washburn or Parker or...) isn't going to be a focus for this business. At least not until someone offers to buy the brand from them or they choose to sell it.\n\nIt's sort of like what's happening to Digitech under the umbrella of Samsung.\n\nI really wish someone would buy Randall and bring back those mid-late 2000s hybrid amps\n\nYeah that would be sweet! And your comment about availability is spot on. I was so hyped for this comeback, and all the hype video demos, etc, and only ever played 2 brand new Randall amps. I've come across a few others in GC, Sam Ash, etc, but all used. I was never comfortable with them. I had a Satan 120 and 50 at one point, and I'd really like a Satan 50 again, although they are rare and starting to see the \"rare price flipper\" tag lines and markups. They had plans for a Meshuggah amp, plus had the Scott Ian, and the 667 KH... what the fuck did they do to screw that pooch?! Lack of distribution definitely hurt them. It wasn't the only thing, but it took all the wind out of my sails.\n\nI've turned to chasing down a Fortin Cali, among other smaller brands, and basically moved on.\n\nWith Boss & the Katana amps, Mooer/Joyo with all of their budget effects, etc.. I can see how it can be hard to stay competitive in today's market.\n\nAnd like Max said, with all of the smaller music companies like Digitech, Randall, etc.. all being scooped up by massive corporations, they basically just tank them and use them as a tax write off.\n\nRegardless of how 'devoted' a fanbase they have, unless the company is making 'x'% of a profit margin, head office will just weigh how much of an investment in R&D & promotion would be required to achieve said profit margin and most times they feel that it isn't worth it.\n\nYeah that would be sweet!

The only store even remotely close to my town that sold Randall kinda shrunk & shrunk until they were bought out by the big chain music store and now both Randall and Peavey amps are pretty much non-existant around here.\n\nThis is pretty much a crash course in what happens to the smaller, less profitable arms of large companies that are gobbled up by even bigger firms.\n\nAs we all know, Randall is owned by US Music Corp.

I find that fascinating, and hugely disturbing, all at once. It almost sounds like E corp from Mr. Robot. Only, I'm sure it's not the biggest conglomerate out there.\n\nI owned the T2 when they were being produced. Monster of an amp! Kind of a one trick pony but that pony could kick, hard.\n\nSame here. It was a complete fluke the store even had one at the time that I went looking to buy a new head. At the time the store was sponsoring thier summer music camp and they put the amps they had been using back in the store for a discount & the T2 was a lot cheaper than any of the tube heads that were available at the time.\n\nThey had the marketing and they had people interested.\n\nThey just didn't have the availability.\n\nFuck I need to find a T2 or one of the G3+ heads.\n\nNot sure what kind of budget you have or if you mean \"I need to find one\" means now but there is a G3 for sale on e-bay.\n\nhttps://www.ebay.ca/itm/Randall-RG3...721129?hash=item3d91a825e9:g:OVQAAOSwd3pdW8ka\n\nThere's also a T2 for sale but it's in Japan and they're asking WAYYYY too much.\n\nNot sure what kind of budget you have or if you mean \"I need to find one\" means now but there is a G3 for sale on e-bay.\n\nhttps://www.ebay.ca/itm/Randall-RG3...721129?hash=item3d91a825e9:g:OVQAAOSwd3pdW8ka\n\nThere's also a T2 for sale but it's in Japan and they're asking WAYYYY too much.\n\nI mean I need to find an amp and a cab. I got rid of all my amp stuff a year ago and I'm craving my hybrid goodness because no fucking modelers do hybrid amps like Randalls or Valvestates.\n\nAlso that's an RG3003. I mean lke the RH300G3+.\n\nI mean I need to find an amp and a cab.

I mean lke the RH300G3+.\n\nGotcha.\n\nIt funny, over the course of several years, Randall went from the regular \"G\" amps to the G2, then the T/V2 (and assorted variants), then the G3 and the KH amps. Then all of a sudden, they just stopped without any kind of notice. Last thing(s) I've seen them come out with were the G13, G-OD pedals and that red 'doom metal' amp and that was several years ago.\n\nIt's especially sad because they were basically the last 'flag bearers' for decent solid state (non-digital) amps."
