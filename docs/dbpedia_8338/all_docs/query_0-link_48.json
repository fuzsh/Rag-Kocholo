Eventually, Don decided to start his own company and develop new, more radical designs. This became the basis for the Randall Amplifier Company.\n\nStarting as a small shop in Corona, California, Randall amps steadily grew in popularity. Though the first several amp models were exclusively solid-state, Randall later started producing tube amps as well. The company was later purchased by U.S. Music Corp., and continues to manufacture products under the Randall name today.\n\nAmplifier characteristics\n\nKnown mostly for producing amplifiers and cabinets used for hard rock and metal music, Randall amplifiers are still quite versatile and some of the more popular models are emulated on many amp modeling products.\n\nAmong solid-state amplifiers, Randalls are widely regarded by many players as some of the best-sounding, dependable, and affordable models around. Some of the older solid-states that have since been discontinued (such as the RG series) are still quite sought after and have a cult following among some musicians, especially those looking to achieve the scooped-mids sound made famous by thrash metal acts such as Metallica and Pantera.\n\nCurrent Amplifier models\n\nRM100 series amplifiers contain Randall's innovative MTS technology which is the brainchild of Randall and Bruce Egnater (of custom amp maker Egnater Amps). These combos and heads come with removable all-tube preamp modules that can be replaced with different preamps for a staggering array of unique tones without relying on digital or hybrid technology.\n\nSignature RM series are RM amp heads with built-in preamp modules designed by various musicians as signature models. Randall worked very closely with these musicians, aiming to develop modules that sound very authentic, yet are still versatile enough to achieve a wide array of tones.\n\nXL series amplifiers contain Randall's Valve-Dynamic technology, which is a Mosfet power section powered by tubes. This is a different approach in the realm of budget tube tone, in that other hybrid technologies usually contain a tube preamp with a fully solid-state power section. Models include the V2 and T2 series amps.\n\nTube series models include the RH50 and RG50 (not to be confused with the discontinued solid-state RG models of the late 80's and early 90's). These amps are Randall's all tube selection of units. These amplifiers are available as a combo or as a head, and feature two channels with four modes of operation.\n\nG3 series heads and combos also contain Valve-Dynamic technology, but are higher powered than the XL series; these amps throw out up to 400 watts of Mosfet power.\n\nKH series units are a selection of Kirk Hammett (of Metallica) endorsed products including a 15 watt practice amp and 120 watt all tube head.\n\nRX series amps are Randall's solid-state budget line of amps, consisting of an extensive selection of combos and a couple variations of the KH120 amp head also.\n\nCurrent cabinet models\n\nXL series cabs are professional models constructed of void-free birch. These models range from 240 to 400 watts RMS power handling. Selections include flat or angled faces. Speakers are varying models from Celestion.\n\nMTS series cabs range from 1x12 to 4x12 void-free birch enclosures. Most models from this extensive line contain Celestion Vintage 30 speakers, except for the R112 cabinet, which contains Celestion Greenbacks.\n\nIsolation enclosure cabinets are designed for true instrument tone in a noiseless environment, mainly for recording purposes.\n\nG3 series cabinets are Randall's budget line, containing Eminence Legends, Eminence Jaguars, or Celestion Vintage 80's depending on model.\n\nDiscontinued Randall products\n\nRandall Amplification has a number of discontinued amplifiers that are still widely used by amateur and professional musicians alike. Due to Randall's extremely limited support for these models, there is a network of amp enthusiasts who communicate and supply parts, mods, schematics, and do-it-yourself kits."
