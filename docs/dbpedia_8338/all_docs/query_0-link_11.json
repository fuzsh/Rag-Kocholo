        "text": "By Washburn Guitars\n\nOctober 2, 2013 - 7:45 am\n\nWashburn Announces the M117SW 2-Point Double Cutaway Mandolin\n\nBuffalo Grove, Ill. — Washburn is pleased to introduce the new M117SW 2-point double cutaway mandolin.\n\nWith its distressed look, the M117SW has a broken in and well played feel. Only premium woods like solid flamed maple and solid spruce have been used in crafting this unique and striking instrument.\n\nLyon & Healy, before incorporating as Washburn, was the first American manufacturer of mandolins until Washburn began making mandolins in 1887.\n\nThe new M117SW echos the trends in mandolin styles of the early 20th century. Unlike many 2-point double cutaway mandos, Washburn has chosen to offer f-holes for a more traditional look and tone.\n\nThe M117SW features aged hardware including a distressed Allen style tailpiece and ebonite tuner buttons with a hand carved solid spruce top with rope purfling and book matched carved solid flamed maple back and sides.\n\nThe flamed maple neck supports a slightly wider (31mm at the nut) ebony fingerboard with wider string spacing for playing ease and comfort.\n\nFor players looking to stand out from the crowd, the M117SW is the perfect performance and road ready mandolin. It comes with a matching aged hard-shell case and retails for $1,426.90.\n\nAbout Washburn Guitars\n\nWashburn Guitars is owned by US Music Corp, located in Buffalo Grove, IL.
