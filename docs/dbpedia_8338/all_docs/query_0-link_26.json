George is working directly with Doug Reynolds, Division Manager, Bruce Egnater, Head of Engineering, and David Karon, Director of Artist Relations to develop a new series of Lynch Signature preamp modules that are used specifically in the Randall MTS Series line of products including heads, combos, and preamp.\n\nTo date, four new Lynch MTS modules are being finalized each representing his current tone, while also reflecting each era of the Lynch signature sound. Release date for the new preamps will be the upcoming Summer NAMM show in Indianapolis with production and availability soon to follow.

Throughout the next 10 years, George worked on and off with Dokken, while forming a band called LYNCH MOB.\n\nToday, George is still successfully touring and producing albums, both solo and with Lynch Mob.\n\nLynch began his relationship with Randall Amplifiers using 4 RG80 heads and cabinets loaded with 65-watt Celestion’s in 1984 for Dokken’s first US tour. The current partnership shares that same energy and excitement for the new products and we’re confident that fans of the\n\nLynch tone as well as guitarist’s around the world will be blown away.\n\n“Many of us here at Randall are and have been huge fans for a long time, really since his early Randall days on the Tooth And Nail album, so we’re very excited and honored to work with such a talented musician and legendary guitar player like George. With the growth and direction of our company and the growth of George’s style and tone it just seems like a great fit and a good time to rejoin our partnership.
