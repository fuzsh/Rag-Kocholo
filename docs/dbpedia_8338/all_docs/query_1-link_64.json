        "text": "“User-friendly and affordable valve tones…To the Randall dealer!”\n\nFor the first look at Randall’s new RT Series amplifiers check out Total Guitar magazine this month where the RT503 head gets it's first review, receiving four out of five stars.\n\nThe new Randall RT Series is an extremely affordable, flexible, all tube group of 50 and 100 watt guitar amplifiers offering a range of tones from clean Country & Jazz to Full Metal Shred. Each amp features black chrome steel grill and control panel, spring reverb, and an effects loop.\n\n“Randall is now offering its pure valve designs at a more affordable price with the RT Series, a family of traditional valve amps aimed at valve first-timers”.\n\n“It comes fitted with a pair of US staple 6L6 output valves, but these can be swapped for EL34s if you’re after a more British flavour. Biasing valve amps is usually best left to the experts, but the Bias control on the back of the amp lets you replace, swap and bias the valves yourself”.\n\n“Tipping OD1’s gain control just above zero results in a solid ‘in between clean and dirty’ tone. Above this things get progressively heavier with almost enough gain for metal at the top. Select the OD2 channel and you’re in ‘Tallica territory. It’s tighter, meatier and more scooped than OD1”.\n\nThe Randall RT503 is available now at £840.13 RRP. To read the full review, pick up the September Issue (Issue 205) of Total Guitar on sale now.\n\nFurther Links"
