        "text": "Just read the news:\n\nMarshall Announces Formation of Marshall USA\n\nMarshall and long-time distributor Korg split\n\n(September 15, 2010) -- Marshall Amplification has announced the formation of Marshall USA. The company recently split with long-time distributor Korg (who also distributes Vox). We don't have many details on what this will mean for future products or pricing in the United States, but the following is a press release we received announcing the new division:\n\nMarshall Amplification announced today the formation of Marshall USA. This new business unit will begin operation on October 1st, and shipments to dealers will begin October 18th. Jon Ellery, Marshall UK Co-managing Director announced that Marc Lee Shannon will assume the position of VP Sales for Marshall USA on October 1st. Marc Lee is a long term industry veteran, who spent the last 17 years heading sales with Audio Technica. Jon Ellery also announced that Ryan Rhodes has been named the Brand Director for Marshall USA and will lead the product direction and work closely with Marshall UK to insure a coordinated worldwide effort. Ryan is very familiar with the Marshall heritage, having worked in past Marshall distribution in the US for 15 years. More Marshall dedicated management will be added shortly, with announcements to follow.\n\nIn commenting on the company’s structure, Ellery stated \"we are very pleased to be able to create a US presence with experienced individuals such as Marc Lee and Ryan. It certainly is the right time for Marshall to launch this strategic effort in the US. This initiative will allow us to truly leverage the iconic position of our brand, and to provide the absolute best in customer service, marketing and promotion. We have also entered into logistics and service agreements to insure that we provide proper levels of technical and customer service, distribution and support.\" More details will be forthcoming.\n\nFor more information:\n\nMarshall Amps​\n\nThe comments on this post don't see this in a positive light, any input here from people in the know?\n\nI guess it is hard to say if it is good or not. Marshall had to struggle to get out from under Unicord in the seventies, and it was a good thing for them. I also perceive there is a big difference between Korg customer support and Marshall factory support (the folks at Marshall UK have never failed to be friendly and helpful to me).\n\nCould this possibly be Korg dropping Marshall due to the quality problems of the last few years? I don't have any evidence to support this, just thinking out loud. Korg can't be too happy with having to fix every new Class 5 and Haze 40 shipped to the US.\n\nBut again Marshall can't be too happy with Korg deciding to not offer so many of their products in the US (the Vintage Modern is getting phased out, you can't get a 20/20 in the US either).\n\nI just really hope that Marshall isn't getting inspiration from Gibson; Gibson has decided to make their brand a luxury name, trying to make it difficult to get an instrument with that name by limiting dealerships and driving up prices. Marshall has to get complete control to change their marketing in the US (probably their biggest market).\n\nIn any case I'd guess that big changes are afoot.\n\ni think it's better for people in the usa... if marshall themselves take care of importing amps overseas, that means, there will be no outside distributors anymore, who want to make money as well... i also think service will become better...\n\nwhen marshall finally ended their contract with rose morris in the early 80's, things went better as well...\n\ni don't think marshall has reliability problems... there are issues of course, but every company has to deal with that...\n\nThis is most likely a matter of quality control, better distribution channels and marketing. I believe they will have a stronger presence in the US as it will be Marshall USA and they will have a better handle on quality control. Korg was essentially a distributor, Marshall USA will be more focused on technical issues and customer service as the article suggests. I believe it will be a plus of US consumers.\n\nMarshall co-managing Director, Jon Ellery, commented, “The Marshall brand has been well-served by the efforts of Korg USA, and we would like to thank them for many years of loyal service, support and friendship. The time is now right for us to distribute and market our products in the U.S., taking the Marshall brand to the next level, ensuring that Marshall remains the world leader in guitar amplification”\n\nI wonder how that will affect any warranty issues prior to the change over ? Korg may not give a crap at this point and the poor consumer will suffer. I am in that positon now with a product under warranty that needs repair. Now I question whether to wait and not try to have my issued resolved until after Oct 1.\n\nI just went to Marshall's website and when I clicked on both \"US Service Centers\" and \"US Product Registration\", I got a message that said \"Contact [email protected] for a list of US service centers\", that link is for e-mail, but I don't know if that goes to Marshall now or Korg.\n\nAnyway, I just fired off an e-mail today (Sept. 16th) expressing my warranty concern. We'll see how far it goes and who (Marshall or Korg) responds...\n\nBy the way Pinto, in Canada is Erikson Music a store or a Marshall distributor ?\n\nThis is most likely a matter of quality control, better distribution channels and marketing. I believe they will have a stronger presence in the US as it will be Marshall USA and they will have a better handle on quality control. Korg was essentially a distributor, Marshall USA will be more focused on technical issues and customer service as the article suggests. I believe it will be a plus of US consumers.\n\nMarshall co-managing Director, Jon Ellery, commented, “The Marshall brand has been well-served by the efforts of Korg USA, and we would like to thank them for many years of loyal service, support and friendship. The time is now right for us to distribute and market our products in the U.S., taking the Marshall brand to the next level, ensuring that Marshall remains the world leader in guitar amplification”\n\n+1\n\nOrange USA......their service has been exceptional to me. I've called on stupid issues before, and always got a professional answer from them directly......no middle men like Korg who may or may not know the product well.\n\nIf Marshall USA is setup like Orange USA, it will be a good thing."
