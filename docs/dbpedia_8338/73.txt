Im really surprised by this.

Randall Amplifiers, a division of U.S. Music Corporation, announced today that they have joined forces with Kirk Hammett of METALLICA. Hammett and Randall will be working together to design an extensive line of signature products that emulates the distinctive tones of METALLICA's legendary guitarist. The full line of Kirk Hammett amps, heads, combos and preamp modules will allow guitar players around the world

Are they making an amp with teh wah built in?

We were all thinking it. Congrats on getting it out first.

Someone please photoshop an amp face that has one of the dials changed from "presence" to "wah", and it's permanently affixed to 12.

Kirk has actually been using Randall amps since 2005. He started by playing the Randall RM100 (loaded with the XTC module I think) at the Black Sabbath Hall of Fame Induction gig. Since then he's been working with Randall to make three MTS modules, one a clean tone, one based on older Metallica tones (called KH-2), and one based on his more recent tones (called KH-3).

lmao @ in-built wah-wah control & set permanently to 12

uhhhhhh... yeah. It's worked in the past. *insert amp maker jab here* :poke:

If they're really dead set on making Hammett products though, they hopefully will put in a pitch correcter for his god-awful vibrato, and an automatic feature that disconnects the wah from the signal after he's used it more than once.

It's the new trend.

Too many people got made fun of for using signature guitars that they switched their interests to signature amps. That way the owner can get their rocks off to the notion that they own "the same amp" as their hero, but not have to live with the ridicule of being called a fill-in-the-blank wanna-be.
