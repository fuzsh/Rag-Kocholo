Randall Amplifiers, a division of U.S. Music Corporation, announced today that they have joined forces with Kirk Hammett of METALLICA. Hammett and Randall will be working together to design an extensive line of signature products that emulates the distinctive tones of METALLICA's legendary guitarist. The full line of Kirk Hammett amps, heads, combos and preamp modules will allow guitar players around the world — from beginners to professionals — to harness the sound he uses both in the studio and on tour.

"Old-school tones and new-school technology attracted me to the potential that Randall amps have to offer," said Kirk Hammett. "These considerations are the answer to my continual quest for a well-rounded tonal palette and this flexibility also enables me to make modifications on the spot. I feel tonally emancipated."

"Everyone at Randall Amplifiers is truly honored to work with Kirk Hammett," said Doug Reynolds, Randall Division Manager. "His sound and playing style have inspired music fans for generations. With Kirk's collaboration and our continued dedication to create innovative, in-your-face amps, guitarists everywhere will be blown away with his new line of signature products."

Kirk Hammett is currently using Randall gear while recording METALLICA's ninth studio album — set to be released next year. The album is being produced by Rick Rubin and will be the bands' first release since "St. Anger" in 2003.
