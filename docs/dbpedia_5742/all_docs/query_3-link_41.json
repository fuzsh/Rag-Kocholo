        "text": "Today is throwback Thursday, and it’s time to dig a hopeful franchise out of Disney’s personal time capsule. While we have had a few franchise from the past such as Gargoyles and the Rocketeer. But I bet we can pull some more obscure franchise into the game.\n\nLet’s take a look at what we have this week\n\nDinosaurs\n\nThis week, we go way back in time to 60 million BC at Dinosaurs. Dinosaurs is the Muppets distant cousins as it take place in a time where Dinosaurs of pangea create a somewhat civilized community inspired by the late 90s. It’s follows the Sinclair family as the bumbling and not-so-bright patriarch, Earl, is just trying to keep his family safe from the primitive landscape they call home. But, the turn of the century makes it a bit challenging as it leads him on a series of misadventures. But, he learns to change with the world with his loving wife, Fran, socially inclined teenage son, Robbie, middle child teenage daughter, Charlene, and their mischievous infant son, Baby. Together, they go through the ups and downs of an ever changing society as they try to live in a world where tradition and progress can co-exist peacefully.\n\nNot as well known as the Muppets, Seasme Street, and Fraggle Rock (why the last two were not included when Disney bought Jim Henson’s assets is beyond me) but it’s a franchise worth looking into. With a cast of essentric and charming characters, they can make for a creative skillset.\n\nNow I want to hear from you, do you think that Dinosaurs have a chance of getting in the game on a scale of 1 to 5, 5 being they are really eligible and one being not eligible at all.\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0 voters\n\nMake sure you come back next Thursday for another throwback entry to this series.\n\nHappy Throwback Thursday.\n\nIt time for enough look inside of Disney’s time capsule for another throwback hopeful.\n\nWho Framed Roger Rabbit\n\nSet in a world where cartoons and humans co-exist, the story revolves around Eddie Valiant, a down-on-his-luck private investigatior who has an distain for toons after one killed his brother. His world soon turned upside down when Marvin Acme, owner of Toontown, a safe haven for toons, was mysteriously murdered and the blame was pinned on beloved cartoon characters, Roger Rabbit, who people believe was an act of jealousy after seeing pictures of him with his wife, Jessica. The mysterious Judge Doom was convinced that the rabbit was guilty and wants him killed using the only thing that would kill a toon, a liquid simply known as dip. It up to the reluctant Eddie to prove Roger’s innocence while being hunted down by the Toon Patrol, Doom’s wesael henchmen.\n\nWith Hocus Pocus, a fellow Touchstone film, already in the game, Who Framed Roger Rabbit is surely to get in as well. With it being requested time and time again and a wacky cast with the possibility to incorporate toon physics in their skills, this game was made for them.\n\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, how would rate their eligibility\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0 voters\n\nHappy Throwback Thursday\n\nThe Brave Little Toaster\n\nBefore toys and cars came to life, there was a toaster, a radio, a desk lamp, an electric blanket, and a vacuum cleaner. More than anything, they loved it when their master, Rob, would play with them when he was a child in the cottage where the appliances lived. But years passed, Rob has grown up and doesn’t visit any more. To add insult to injury, the cottage was put up for sale. Undeterred, Toaster rallies the others on a journey to go to him to the city. Together, they faced storms, waterfalls, and a climatic run in at the junk yard saving Rob in the process. Even though they have reunited with their master, Toaster and his friends adventure were far from over after rescuing animals from a research laboratory and even going to Mars to save Rob’s infant son.\n\nThis is rather unique. The obvious choice for this franchise is obviously Toaster, Radio, Lampy, Blanky, and Kirby, but this can go one to two ways, one is that they come individually and uses their functions against the creeps. Or they can come together as a singular unit and work together. Either way, this would be a welcoming addition given we already have living toys in the city.\n\nOn a scale of one to five, how would you rate their eligibility.\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0 voters\n\nHappy Throwback Thursday\n\nBonkers\n\nIn Hollywood California, we follow Bonkers B. Bobcat who also starred in Raw Toonage, an actual cartoon sketch show that premiered a year prior to this one. Anyway, he was fired after his other show He’s Bonkers (that is not a real show) got bumped off the first place in ratings. He was introduced to law enforcement after obliviously saving fellow toon star, Donald Duck from a park mugger. As fate would have it, police officer, Lucky Piquel was also working on the case and was given full credit for the arrest. Impressed, Chief of Police, Leonard Kanifky, decide to start a toon division with Lucky as the head of it as well as Bonkers’ partner, much to his jargon. Together, the solved zany mysteries all over Hollywood. Eventually, Lucky would get a job in the FBI leaving Bonkers under the care of fellow officer, Miranda Wright to take his place.\n\nWith Disney Afternoon Shows like Ducktales, Darkwing Duck, Chip and Dale Rescue Rangers, and Gargoyles in the game’s rosters. Bonkers would a more obscure addition to the game what with the franchise already in the game as a badge. Bonkers would be right at home in the CPD helping out the city using toonish weapons and antics against the creeps.\n\nOn a scale of one to five, how would you rate their eligibility?\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0 voters\n\nHappy Throwback Thursday\n\nAladdin\n\nIf you were a kid born in th 90s or early 2000s, you probably have seen your favorite movie turned into a TV show at one point. The first of these that will cover will be Aladdin. This follows the further of Aladdin as he goes on adventures with his betrothed, Princess Jasmine, pet monkey, Abu, wacky as ever Genie, and Iago, who had turned to the side of good (somewhat) after the events of The Return of Jafar as they battled everything from monsters to sorcerer and at one point even gods.\n\nSome of said villains would be perfect for the game. We have Mechanicles, the greatest of the great Greek genius with a knack for building insect themed war machines. Mozenrath, a sorcerer just about Aladdin’s age and ruler of the Land of Black Sand. Abis Mal, a bumbling theif who uses magical items to try to take over Agrabah (and get the Sultan’s hat) and Mirage, a cat like goddess of pure evil who wants nothing more than to cause havoc wherever she goes. Other good addition include Sadira, a young sorceress dealing in the art of sand magic and Eden, a genie in a bottle and Genie’s love interest.\n\nOn a scale of one to five, how would you rate their eligibility\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0 voters\n\nHappy Throwback Thursday\n\nBuzz Lightyear of Star Command\n\nAs many are well aware, Lightyear was not the first spinoff that Buzz had. Turn back the clock a decade or so and you will find that Buzz had his own TV show. It follows Buzz as he continue the fight against Evil Emperor Zurg (who is neither Buzz’s father or himself from the future).\n\nBuzz will not be alone in this fight. He is joined by character that would be great for the game including Mira Nova, the princess of Tangea with the ability to phase though solid objects. Booster Muddlefoot who dream of becoming a space Ranger had been realized and the Experimental Ranger (or XR for short), the small sarcastic do anything robot.\n\nHowever, Zurg is also not alone for he too has allies by his side including Warp Darkmatter, Buzz’s former partner who willingly turned to Zurg’s side as Agent Z. NOS-4-A2, an energy vampire who can feed on anything technology, XL, XR’s violent prototype, and Gravtina, the Mistress of gravity that has a crush on Buzz. All of which are also perfect for the game.\n\nOn a scale of one to five, how would you rate their eligibility.\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0 voters\n\nHappy Throwback Thursday\n\nJames and the Giant Peach\n\nBased on the book by Ronald Dahl (the same person who wrote Matilda, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and BFG), it tell the story of James, who lived under his cruel Aunts Spiker and Sponge after a rhino came out of no where and ate his parents. His grueling life changed when a man showed and gave him a bag of magic crocodile tounges, which he accidentally dropped making a peach grow to monumental size as well as the bugs that were feeding on it at the time. James teamed up with a spider, a grasshopper, a centipede, a ladybug, a earthworm, and a glow worm to use the peach to travel to New York City facing macanical sharks and skeleton pirates along the way.\n\nWow, on paper, that is just about the weirdest premise I have ever heard in my life.\n\nAnyway, while not as well known as TNBC but I can tell that there are at least a few fans of JATGP. Much like The Brave Little Toaster the obviously choices are James and his insect friends. The can utilize the peach as their basic attack while using their various talents against the creeps. They may not be a giant rhino, but it’ll due in a pinch.\n\nOn a scale of one to five, how would you rate their eligibility.\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0 voters\n\nHappy Throwback Thursday and Happy Thanksgiving\n\nThis week, I’m going to skip today’s entry to spend Thanksgiving with my family\n\nThank you and have a nice day.\n\nHappy Throwback Thursday\n\nOswald the Lucky Rabbit\n\nBefore Simba became the lion king. Before Elsa let it go. Before Mickey hopped on his steamboat. There was… a rabbit. Oswald the Lucky Rabbit to be exact.\n\nWhile working for Universal, Walt created Oswald after the Alice Comedies got discontinued. These shorts follow the misadventures of Oswald as a mischievous hero similar to the early take on Mickey. While not as famous as other silent era cartoons like Felix the Cat, Oswald grabbed the attention of audiences nonetheless. But that soon came crashing down when Walt left Universal and losing the right to his creation in the process. Without Walt’s influence, Oswald’s shorts began to decline in value and was eventually shelved. Oswald’s film career was at an end…\n\nOr was it?\n\nJump forward a few decades where Bob Iger traded sportscaster, Al Micheal, in exchange for the rights to Oswald. And the rest is history as Oswald made cameos in some Mickey shorts and even being made a main character in the video game series Epic Mickey where he was ruler of Wasteland, a place where all forgotten cartoons go returning the rabbit to his former glory.\n\nBeing the first big hit Disney ever made, it would only be right for Oswald to join into the fight. He would a composite character bring in elements from both his shorts and Epic Mickey as he brings his own brand of luck to your team.\n\nOn a scale of one to five, how would you rate their eligibility.\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0 voters\n\nI’m loving this. Do you think you could possibly do the silly symphonies? There is a vast collection of characters with different skills and personalities.\n\nHappy Throwback Thursday\n\nSilly Symphony\n\nWalt Disney’s Silly Symphonies were a hugely popular and influential series of Disney short subjects from The Golden Age of Animation, generally themed around music and lushly animated fairy tales. They were a very important part of Disney’s history, pioneering many of their animation techniques, as well as giving animators preparation for work in the feature-length animated films that the studio would later become famous for. The series would have a massive impact on the animation industry.\n\nMany characters can be consider for roster, including Big Bad Wolf, the Three Little Pigs (Fiddler, Fifer, and Practical), The ant and the grasshopper, Persephone and Hades (that’s right there was another Hades before the one already in game), the Skeletons from The Skeleton Dance, Max Hare, Toby Tortoise, Hobo Cookie and Sugar Cookie Girl from Cookie Carnival and Elmer Elephant and Tillie Tiger from Elmer Elephant to name few. Since there are so many of them, we have to pick the most prominent ones or fan favorites so as not to be overwhelmed by the shorts.\n\nOn a scale of one to five, how would you rate their eligibility?\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0 voters\n\nHappy Throwback Thursday\n\nTailspin\n\nIn an alternate universe, Baloo is a seaplane cargo-for-hire operator from the port city of Cape Suzette in a time not unlike the 1930s or The '40s. His twin-engine flying boat, the Sea Duck, is his most prized possession, and he favors his freedom over all else, including paying his bills. When the bank forecloses on his debts, a young entrepreneur/lady bear/single mother named Rebecca Cunningham snaps up his business, his plane, and his home, and opens the “Higher-For-Hire” air cargo service. Rather than abandon his “baby” to her and whatever low-rent pilot she may hire, he stays on, working for the day when he can buy back the Sea Duck and be rid of her.\n\nEarly on, he picks up a young stowaway, Kit Cloudkicker, who eventually earns the post of Baloo’s navigator and sidekick. A daring barnstormer and aspiring pilot, Kit uses a collapsible airfoil to glide behind the Sea Duck on a line, and is responsible for much of the derring-do of the series in contrast to his overweight chum.\n\nOutside the odd subtle occasion, there’s not a lot of romance between Becky and Baloo: their relationship smacks more of Sibling Rivalry. Baloo, Kit, Becky, and Becky’s adorable daughter Molly form a definite sitcom family dynamic, with the practical, strait-laced Becky faced off against her lazy, easygoing, roguish pilot.\n\nAllies of the crew include Louie who operates a seaplane truckstop of sorts out in the ocean that is Baloo’s favorite hangout; and Wildcat, a seemingly slow-witted mechanic with incredible skills.\n\nThere are three major antagonists: the Air Pirates, led by Don Karnage, who operate from a giant flying aircraft carrier called the Iron Vulture (and would have long ago plundered Cape Suzette, had it not been for all the anti-aircraft defenses on the nearby cliffs); the country of Thembria, a pseudo-Soviet totalitarian state full of snow and blue warthogs, home to the napoleonic Col. Spigot and his Sergeant Schultz-like sidekick, Sgt. Dunder; and Shere Khan who is a business executive and chairman of Khan Industries.\n\nWith the return of the costumes, this would be the perfect oppturnity to integrate Tailspin into the game. Starting with the obvious, Baloo and Louie’s outfits from the show, not much for Shere Khan due to conflicting skillsets. As for new characters, again very obvious, is Kit Cloudkicker and Don Karnage. With The Jungle Book version of Baloo and King Louie already in the game, it would make for some funny (and confusing on the Tailspin cast part) dialogue.\n\nOn a scale of one to five, how would you rate their eligibility.\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0 voters\n\nHappy Throwback Thursday\n\nThe Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad\n\nWhile the package era was not as popular due to being short on staff because of World War 2, thar didn’t stop for making something memorable. And The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad is one of them. This consists of two shorts.\n\nThe first one is The Wind of the Willow which follows the esscentric J. Thaddeus Toad who those his fortune away over his any that suits him fancy at the time. His latest? Getting a motorcar. This lands him in a heap ot trouble with his friends, Rat, Mole, and Angus McBadger as well as the law as he assumily steals a motorcar.\n\nThe second one is The Legend of Sleepy Hollow here Ichabod Crane became the new school teacher. It wasn’t long before he falls head over heels in love with town darling, Katrina Van Tassel, and fights with the town hero Brom Bones for her affection. This escalates as Brom tells the story of the Headless Horseman, who chops off the head to those unfortunate enough to go into the woods alone at night. That poor sap happens to be Ichabod as it leads to an climatic chase for safety.\n\nBoth having their share of popular characters (namely Mr. Toad and the Headless Horseman) despite it’s somewhat obscurity. But seeing as how we have the likes of The Rocketeer, there no doubt that character from this film and others of that era will join the roster.\n\nIn a scale of one to five, how would you rate their eligibility?\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0 voters\n\nHappy Throwback Thursday\n\nAdventures of the Gummi Bears\n\nAnother Disney Afternoon Show that tells the story of Cavin, a page who stumbled across the mythical Gummi Glen, home of the Gummi Bears, and race of small bears that were thought to be extinct for years.\n\nUsing the Gummi medallion, which was passed on from his grandfather, Cavin manage to open the Great Book of Gummi, which contain all the knowledge of Gummi Bear culture. This inspired the six remaining Bear to help defend the Kingdom of Dunwyn in secret, with the added help of the feisty princess Calla, from the threat of invasion by Duke Igthron and his army of ogres, who wants to rule take over the kingdom using the power of Gummi Bear Juice, a potion that give those who drink it bouncing capability that Tigger can be proud of.\n\nOn a scale of one to five, how would you rate their eligibility.\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0 voters\n\nHappy Throwback Thursday\n\nThe Fox and the Hound\n\nThis story revolves around a unlikely friendship. A fox named Tod and a hound named Copper. While their owners, Amos Slade and Widow Tweed, don’t see eye to eye, Tod and Copper became friends and vowed to be friends forever despite nature’s intentions. But as the years roll and Copper started actively participating in hunts with Amos, his friendship with Tod was tested as nature forces them to become enemy.\n\nOn a scale of one to five, how would you rate their eligibility?\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0 voters\n\nHappy Throwback Thursday\n\nOliver and Company\n\nPutting a twist on a old story (rimshot), we go to New York City where we meet Oliver, an orphan kitten who was swept out of his cardboard box during a rain storm and into the concrete jungle. I wasn’t long before he meets Dodger, a street-wise dog and leader of stray dogs owned by Fagin, who was in debt to the ruthless loan shark, Bill Sykes, and was taken in as one of their own. That did not last long as Oliver was found by Jenny Foxworth, a lonely girl who adopted him, leaving him with conflicting loyalty between his new friends or a new home.\n\nOn a scale of one to five, how would you rate their eligibility.\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0 voters\n\nHappy Throwback Thursday\n\nDumbo\n\nThe Rudolph of the Disney family.\n\nThe stork arrives at a circus to deliver a baby elephant. Things took a turn for the worst right away for the little guy when it was revealed that he had ears that were abnormally large even by elephant standards. This oddity landed him to be the laughingstock of the entire circus and earning him the nickname Dumbo with his mother as the only person who loves him unconditionally. That didn’t last long when she was forced to be separated from her baby after protecting her from bulling kids was mistaken as an attack of an wild animal. Now with the help of a unlikely source, a friendly mouse named Timothy, Dumbo sets out to prove his worth ultimately putting his ears to go use… using them to fly.\n\nOn a scale of one to five, how would you rate their eligibility?\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0 voters\n\nHappy Throwback Thursday\n\nRecess\n\nSometimes being a kid is no Sunday stroll especially in elementary school.
