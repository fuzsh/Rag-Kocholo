        "text": "Developer: KG Studio, hede, Restless Corp.\n\nRelease: November 2018\n\nGenre: Action, Platform\n\nArt Style: Drawing\n\nOfficial links: Website / Discord / Twitter / Instagram / Kickstarter / Steam\n\nJohnny Rocket was originally released on Steam in November 2018. Don’t worry, it didn’t go anywhere! It’s still there and waits for you to buy and play it, but the developers would love to port their 2D Comic Adventure to the consoles and improve many aspects of it. KG Studio and hede are collaborating with Restless Corp. and run at this very moment a small Kickstarter campaign. Andriy Davidyuk, Product Manager at Restless Corp, and Peter Gordien, Artist and animator at KG Studio, talked to Indie Game Picks about Johnny Rocket and their plans about the future of the game.\n\nWhat inspired you to start working on Johnny Rocket?\n\nPeter Gordien: All started with an animated cartoon about Johnny that got very popular on Reddit. It was supposed to be a black and white universe of little superhero men. In the style of the Avengers. Such a hypertrophied postmodern universe. Mixed on comics and retro stereotypes. The man is a hammer. The man is a drill. Rocket man. Man is anyone. One day after about half a year of the first animated cartoon about Johnny Rocket, my friend Alexander Colesnik came to visit me. We got into a conversation. And he said that he was just looking for new ideas for developing the game. He then strenuously stormed the gamedev. After drinking some Scotch whiskey with cola, we set to work. So the KG Studio team appeared.\n\nCan you tell me a bit more about the story of the game and the world behind it?\n\nP.G.: 3 people worked on the game. I am the Artist of Johnny Rocket (KG studio). Programmer Alexander Kolesnik (KG studio). And the programmer is Aleksey Hede / (Hede game studio). When it comes to soundtracks, all of it was handcrafted by us, after all, Alexander and I played in the same rock band. The console port and all of the publishing process is now on the shoulders of our Ukrainian partners – Restless Corp team.\n\nThe world of the game, Johnny Rocket, is a world of stereotypes about World War II and the mystic of Ahnenerbe. Game series – Wolfenstein, The Rocketeer – 1991 film. Indiana Jones. We have references for all of that. I can say that there is an alternative universe in which there is a bad guy Hitler. With alien technology and crazy scientists. Nazis craft monsters and laser guns.\n\nDave Perry had a big impact on the game: The creator of the Earthworm Jim. We wanted to make some kind of black and white crazy world in the style of Jimm Worm with Nazi dogs and mega hero Joni Rocket. A big surprise for developers was when Dave Perry commented on the game being great.\n\nIntroduce us to the character of Johnny Rocket… Who is he? What is he able to do to fight the enemies?\n\nAndriy Davidyuk: Initially, there was supposed to be a cartoon intro: Grandfather Johnny Rocket makes a discovery in his secret laboratory. Like in the movie “The Rocketeer”. Postmodernism!\n\nGrandpa Johnny calls young Johnny and speaks. “Johnny. It will help break Hitler’s strength. We must stop him. He went too far. “Angry Nazis burst in and immediately shoot at grandfather. Johnny grabs a laser prototype from the table and kills the Gestapo. Grandfather dies in his arms. Johnny promises him (As in Spider. Postmodernism. Cliché! More Cliché!) by all means revenge. But first you need to straighten the intestines. All adults know. Important things to do lightly.\n\nWhy did you choose the black and white cartoon art style for your Game?\n\nP.G.: The black and white styling was chosen by me for drawing long before the creation of the game. I tried myself as an animator. Parody the style of Don Hertzfield, Simon Tofield, Pencilmation. Until it turned into a promo Johnny Rocket animated film. In general, when you do not need to paint, it doubles the speed of drawing. Creates emphasis on animation. Gives a unique style and memorability. By the way, did you know that Cuphead was originally planned to be drawn in black and white style? But producers and money wallets were forced to decorate the game.\n\nWhich improvements can the gamers who have already bought and played Johnny Rocket on Steam expect to find in the newer version of the game?\n\nA.D.: We’ve been working for the last 4 month on game improvement and bug fixing. The Steam version of the game gave us a lot of feedback. The game already feels like a finished and polished product.\n\nExcluded all bugs and made following improvements:\n\nFalling under the flare and not dying is fixed\n\nJohnny Becomes invincible under certain conditions is fixed\n\nBeing attacked on the checkpoint fixed\n\nImproved controller support\n\nFully working UI for consoles and controller\n\nHardcore mode is not impossible anymore. Speedrunners should like it.\n\nSoftware reliability and stability improvement.\n\nA big chunk of in-game changes that were simply irritating and now are fixed.\n\nWhere could people find you in order to learn more about Johnny Rocket and keep up with future updates?\n\nA.D.: Our main place for interaction with the audience is Discord. We make regular giveaways and updates on the development of our own games and games that we publish. Developers and Gamers are welcome to join the discussion and share their work. We have a very friendly community.\n\nSocial media: Website, Twitter, Instagram, Discord\n\nWhat is the current status of the game? Do you expect to release it soon?\n\nA.D.: We are currently working on Xbox and Switch porting and finally getting some progress. We hope that the Kickstarter campaign will help a lot in this process as we’ve been operating on zero budget for the last 4 month working full time. Also purchasing development kits were very expensive for us and were the last money that we’ve given away to bring Johnny Rocket to consoles. We plan to release the game by the end of Summer 2020 and if it is successful, we want to continue working on a free DLC for the game as we already have an idea in mind.\n\n—"
