        "text": "Me and my friend were discussing games and I never really bought games way back when, would only really get them as gifts, so how much did for example NES, SNES and N64 games usually cost?\n\nNew PC games used to always be £30 or £35 here in the UK about 10 years ago. Now you can usually get them for ~£25, which is probably about half the price in real terms.\n\nI seem to recall N64 games being stupid expensive for a while.\n\nLaunch price for Super Mario 64 and Pilotwings was $70, but due to the way the competition between stores worked, you could find it for $60. I remember paying $80 for Turok, however.\n\nI believe I have the original boxes for Burgertime and Atlantis which I believe were $35 although I have no idea how standard the pricing was back before the Crash.\n\nAnt Attack and Scuba Dive on the Spectrum were £6.95. Ultimate Play the Game (now Rare) decided to change things and made the first ten quid game: Sabre Wulf. With it came a change to a larger carboard game box. This happened for Underwurlde, Knightlore, etc. It's them that drove up game pricing in Britain.\n\nEverything costs more in Canada. N 64 games were up to 60-70 beans. Our dollar has been equal to the USD for as long as I can remember, never off by more than a few cents. Yet we still pay more.\n\nDuring the 90's here in Canada the dollar was at an all time low compared to the US dollar (like 60 cents to the dollar) so games were ultra expensive. I remember WCW vs. NWO World Tour costing me $99.99 at retail. It was mental. I don't recall game prices before that because I never bought any for myself, they were always gifts and I was ultra young.\n\nThe first game I purchased with my own money was Super Mario Bros. 2. That game was around 70 dollars cdn., but I paid around 80 cdn for it being I purchased it in a grocery store. Yes, back then some of our grocery stores sold toys and games. Stepping a generation ahead, Final Fantasy III (US), was over 80 dollars cdn at release with the GST and PST factored in. I was so short on money to purchase what is to date my most anticipated game, I remember trading in a stack of very good SNES games in their original cardboard boxes (Ken Griffey Jr., Super Metroid, Legend of the Mystical Ninja, Pocky & Rocky, and a few others I don't remember). I'm not saying all games were that much here, I can't really remember, but I do remember those two very well.\n\nYeah, the prices people have been throwing around are off.\n\nLater era SNES games would run 70-80 dollars (Crono Trigger and other Square games, Ultimate MK3, etc.)\n\nN64 games would run 70-90 dollars. (Zelda 64, Star Fox 64 etc were almost 100)\n\nThis is LARGELY why PS1 became successful. It was drastically cheaper than N64 cartiidges.\n\nIt's worthwhile to say, however, that this price reduction was passed on to the consumer due to the fact that manufacturing costs for CD based systems were drastically cheaper tahn the propetary hardware Nintendo was pushing out in it's carts."
