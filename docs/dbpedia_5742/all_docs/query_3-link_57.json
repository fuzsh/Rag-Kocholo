        "text": "LOS ANGELES | As a small child, Danny Bilson played with rubber prop guns on the set of \"Hogan's Heroes\" and \"The Andy Griffith Show\" while his father directed episodes. Forty-five years later, Bilson is still playing games in Hollywood, but now hundreds of millions of dollars are at stake.\n\nAs executive vice president of core games at THQ Inc., the 54-year-old former screenwriter is overseeing a business upon which the Agoura Hills, Calif., video game publisher has staked its future. Once known for lightweight game adaptations of movies and TV shows such as \"Cars\" and \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" and World Wrestling Entertainment smackdowns, THQ is responding to market trends and a flagging stock price by transforming itself into a publisher of big-budget action titles.\n\nOn Tuesday, it released \"Homefront,\" an ambitious action game about America under North Korean occupation that's the first original project to be developed under Bilson. The game's fate will be a measure of the wisdom of THQ's decision to spurn veteran game industry marketers and product managers and put its fate in the hands of an executive whose professional achievements include screenwriting credits for \"The Rocketeer\" and the TV show \"The Flash.\"\n\n\"I'm bringing a totally new culture for this company,\" Bilson said. \"We're not making manifolds. We're making products to entertain people.\"\n\nBut disappointing reviews spooked investors Tuesday, who pummeled the game publisher's stock, pushing it down $1.25, or 21 percent, to $4.69.\n\nThe game garnered a relatively weak average score of 72 out of 100 from 28 reviews by Tuesday afternoon, according to Metacritic, a site that aggregates reviews. A score of 80 is considered the minimum required for a \"shooter\" game such as \"Homefront\" to be commercially successful.\n\nSo far, players seem eager to see for themselves. On Amazon, \"Homefront\" was the No. 1 selling game, trailed by \"Pokemon Black Version\" and \"Pokemon White Version,\" two popular titles from Nintendo. Strong preorders, or customers who paid in advance to have a copy of the game sent to them on the day it is released, have put \"Homefront\" on Amazon's top 100 list for 28 days.\n\nWith production costs of $35 million to $50 million and tens of millions more to advertise, \"Homefront\" is the most expensive video game THQ has produced. The company must sell 2 million copies just to break even, a company executive said.\n\nThat won't be easy. The video game market is flooded with similar \"shooter\" games from Activision Blizzard Inc., Electronic Arts Inc. and Sony Corp., all chasing the same young male gamers who spend their bottom dollar on food, rent and video games -- not necessarily in that order.\n\nIt's a demographic Bilson knows well. When he wasn't hanging out on set with his childhood friend Ron Howard, young Danny was home playing board games. When Bilson turned 21, his father gave him an Atari 2600 game console. \"I went crazy,\" Bilson recalled.\n\nBilson followed in the footsteps of his father, Bruce Bilson, and his grandfather, the late Hollywood film producer George Bilson, and became a scriptwriter. Then a chance meeting on a plane in 1997 changed his trajectory. The man in the seat next to him was Don Mattrick, the head of studios at EA who is now chief of Microsoft Corp.'s Xbox business.\n\n\"For me, getting to meet someone from EA was like someone at EA getting to meet someone from Hollywood,\" Bilson said. \"I was such a fanboy.\"\n\nMattrick persuaded Bilson to become a consultant on several EA titles, including the Sims. \"He's extremely insightful about game design,\" said Bing Gordon, who was Bilson's boss at EA and is now a venture capitalist.\n\nYet Bilson's business acumen remains unproven. An attempt to start his own game studio in 2004 failed, forcing him to return to writing scripts and comic books. In 2007, he got a call from THQ asking if he wanted to run the company's \"core\" game business, overseeing production and, soon, marketing as well."
