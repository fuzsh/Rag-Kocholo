        "text": "Angry Video Game Nerd (AVGN) episode 188: Shrek: Fairy Tale Freakdown. The Nerd just wants to watch Shrek... but he ends up reviewing one of the worst fighting games on the Game Boy Color based on Shrek... until he's eventually captured by some creepy Shrek cultists. There's a lot going on. Shrek is love, Shrek is life after all.\n\nWeiterlesen\n\nAngry Video Game Nerd (AVGN) episode 190: Fear and Loathing in Vegas Stakes. The Nerd has set out to Last Vegas with his trusted attorney to review some of the worst games imaginable... in a parody of the book/film Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. The Nerd reviews Vegas Stakes (SNES), Vegas Dream (NES), Caesar's Palace (GEN), Road Runner's Death Valley Rally (SNES), and of course the heaviest trip of all... LSD Dream Emulator (PS1).\n\nWeiterlesen\n\nAngry Video Game Nerd (AVGN) episode 191: 3DO Interactive Multiplayer. The 3DO gaming console has been talked about before on AVGN, in the Plumbers Don't Wear Ties episode. But, the Nerd is back to review some of the other awful games for the system, however, there are a few gems in there too. The \"REAL\" 3DO Interactive Multiplayer was a game console hardware platform originally released in 1993 (with the first models released by Panasonic and other models released by other companies in 1994.) Cheap production cost of CDs led to a large amount of shovelware being released for the system. In this review, the Nerd covers Gex, Road Rash, DOOM, Way of the Warrior, Crash N Burn, Soccer Kid, Battle Chess, Street Fighter II, Alone in the Dark, Cyberia, PO'd, Demolition Man, Virtuoso, a bunch of American Laser Games stuff (Mad Dog McCree and Crime Patrol), and more.\n\nWeiterlesen\n\nAngry Video Game Nerd (AVGN) episode 192: Corpse Killer (3DO). Corpse Killer is a game released for the Sega CD, Sega CD 32X, 3DO, Sega Saturn, Windows 95 and Macintosh computers that features live-action full motion video in a format similar to other games developed by Digital Pictures. It was later remastered for Steam, PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch. But the Nerd is playing it on the 3DO. In the game, an unnamed United States Marine is airdropped onto a tropical island on a top secret mission to stop the evil Dr. Hellman, who plans to release his army of zombies on the world. He is bitten by a zombie and also meets an attractive female reporter and a Rastafarian male driver. Four of the marine lieutenant's comrades are captured by Hellman and turned into zombies. To rescue them, the lieutenant infiltrates Hellman's compound and shoots each of them with bullets coated with extract from Datura plants, which can turn freshly-created zombies back into humans.\n\nWeiterlesen\n\nAngry Video Game Nerd (AVGN) episode 193: Sega Game Gear VHS Tapes. In the 1990's Sega and Howard Johnson's hotels teamed up for a weird promotion for the Game Gear. Kids could go \"HoJo with Sega\" during this summer promotion. Parents could rent a Game Gear the kids could play while on their vacation, or they could buy some of the Game Tips VHS tapes. These tapes are horrible, filled with basic walkthroughs, codes, and bull. They also have these wrap-around segments with a 90's surfer dude with a Foghorn Leghorn accent working at the Howard Johnson. He goes through almost every position on the hotel staff while making the life one of chubby businessman a living hell. The Nerd reviews this tape today and talks a little bit about the HoJo/Sega promotion.\n\nWeiterlesen\n\nCarmageddon is a vehicular combat video game released for personal computers in 1997. It was later ported to other platforms, and spawned a series of follow up titles. Carmageddon 64 was a port of Carmageddon II (originally for PC), and released for the Nintendo 64 in the year 2000. It was going to be published by Interplay, but Titus Interactive took it over (the same guys from Superman 64). It's a game where you race other cars... but it turns into mostly running over zombies, rather than people like in the original PC game. In the German version, you hit Dinosaur-like monsters rather than zombies. Go figure.\n\nWeiterlesen\n\nAngry Video Game Nerd (AVGN) episode 195: Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures. Also known in Japan as \"Hello! Pac-Man.\" Pac-Man 2 is a side-scrolling adventure game in the Pac-Man series. Instead of being a maze game like the majority of its predecessors, Pac-Man 2 incorporates light point-and-click adventure game elements. The Nerd is playing the Sega Genesis version. He joins Pac-Man exploring and interacting with the world and characters around him. Take on a task, and then take a wild ride on a mine cart or set off on an intense hand-glider flight while fending off some unrestful ghosts. This game was coined \"the first ever interactive cartoon\" by the game's manual.\n\nWeiterlesen\n\nThe Rocketeer is a 1991 film from Walt Disney Pictures, based upon the comic book character of the same name Set in 1938 Los Angeles, California, The Rocketeer tells the story of stunt pilot Cliff Secord who stumbles upon a hidden rocket-powered jet pack that he thereafter uses to fly without the need of an aircraft. His heroic deeds soon attract the attention of Howard Hughes and the FBI, who are hunting for the missing jet pack, as well as the Axis operatives that stole it from Hughes. Also in 1991, a game published by Bandai came out for the Nintendo Entertainment System. A year later the Super Nintendo game also came out. In this review the Nerd covers both games, dons his old Nerd Shirt, and builds the ultimate transportation device: the RocketBeer.\n\nWeiterlesen\n\nAngry Video Game Nerd (AVGN) episode 197: Greendog: The Beached Surfer Dude! (for Sega Genesis). Greendog is a platform game developed by Sega Technical Institute and Interactive Designs for the Sega Genesis console, and was published by Sega in September 1992.

But the real curse is The Nerd having to play this game!!\n\nWeiterlesen\n\nThis is episode 198 of the Angry Video Game Nerd (AVGN), a review of the Commodore 64 and a bunch of it's licensed and weirder games. The Commodore 64, also known as the C64 or the CBM 64, is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982 by Commodore International. The C64 took its name from its 64 kibibytes of RAM. With support for multicolor sprites and a custom chip for waveform generation, the C64 could create superior visuals and audio compared to systems without such custom hardware. Except, well, the software was kinda garbage.\n\nWeiterlesen\n\nThis is episode 199 of the Angry Video Game Nerd (AVGN), a review of the Commodore 64 horror games. Freddy and Jason are back with a review of Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th on Commodore 64!!

This is part 1 of 3, with the others coming very soon. LJN has been a thorn in the Nerd's side for 15 years now. With the sudden rights falling into his hands, the Nerd has decided to remake every LJN game as good as possible. However, he'll need to review every LJN game ever made (while Back to the Future gets re-developed.) Thankfully, the Nerd has already reviewed a lot of the LJN library... but, there's a lot of garbage he hasn't played yet to complete the 67 LJN titles released.\n\nWeiterlesen\n\nThis is episode 200 of the Angry Video Game Nerd (AVGN), a review of every game published by LJN. This is part 2 of 3, with the final coming next week. The Nerd has been gifted the rights to LJN and will start fixing the company by remaking Back to the Future on NES with a developer friend. Unfortunately, he also has to review every other LJN game to complete the catalog of his new company. Oh, and since he already reviewed the movie based games, he will now tackle the sports and Marvel games!!\n\nWeiterlesen\n\nThis is episode 200 of the Angry Video Game Nerd (AVGN), a review of every game published by LJN. This is part 3 of 3, the final part! Making a video game has been harder than the Nerd and even the developer thought. But, while that process rushes to the deadline, the Nerd will review the last batch of LJN games to complete their awful catalog. These being the wrestling and miscellaneous games.\n\nWeiterlesen"
