        "text": "The below are old episodes of \"Gamepro TV\" ..I thought you guys who enjoy classic gaming like me, would enjoy watching these episodes.\n\nThe description for each youtube episode is below the link! No I did not upload these!\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOZ7W94XeeE\n\nGamePro TV Episode 1 - \"Mag-net-o\" Edition\n\nMost likely not the \"first\" episode of GamePro, but it is the first one I recorded way back in 1991 when I was but a wee lad. Tons of classic footage of NES tips and cheats, Super Ghouls and Ghosts, Game Gear and Sega CD previews, Wolverine eating burgers, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Castlevania for the Game Boy and more! No one else seems to have this show on tape, so enjoy its Net debut!\n\nI recorded many episodes of this series from its original 1991-1992 run, the only season of GamePro TV ever produced. And I plan to show more in the future!\n\nStay tuned to Siliconera.com for import game coverage and for future episodes of GamePro!\n\nAnd thanks to GamePro for creating such an awesome/cheesy show!\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zw45mFfTY0\n\nGamePro TV Episode 2 - \"'Sup!\" Edition\n\nHere's the second recorded episode of GamePro TV!\n\nSWAT: The Rocketeer - NES, Shadowgate - NES, The Immortal - Genesis, Battletoads - NES, Batman - GameBoy, Gain Ground - Genesis\n\nAsk The Pros: The Immortal - Genesis\n\nPro Review: Bucky O'Hare - NES\n\nThe Cutting Edge: Game Action Replay - NES\n\n16 Bit Hits: John Madden Football - SNES\n\nViewer SWAT: Star Trek - NES\n\nThere is one missing clip, a preview of Eco-Quest for PC, but I recorded over it and the video was unwatchable, so I didn't include it.\n\nStay tuned for more GamePro TV!\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQMTXgTraKg\n\nGamePro TV Episode 3 - \"Do Me So Far, Do Me\" Edition!\n\nHere's the third recorded episode of GamePro TV!\n\nSadly, this and future episodes of GPTV are without Brennan \"B-man\" Howard as co-host. Guess the surfer speak didn't quite hold up. Also, due to a memory lapse (hey, this stuff aired 14 years ago, ok?) I can't remember if the show either went on haitus for a few months during the holidays or if I just missed a bunch of episodes, because this show apparently aired in February 1992, and the previous episodes I posted were from late 1991.\n\nEither way, it's all here, so enjoy!\n\nSWAT: S.C.A.T. - NES, Super Mario World - SNES, Bonk's Revenge - TG16, Play Action Football - NES\n\nAsk The Pros: StarTropics - NES\n\nPro Review: Mega Man IV - NES\n\nInside Info: Top 10 NES Video Game Rentals Feb. 1992 - Blockbuster Video, Final Fight (Ending) - SNES, Medieval History - Check your local library!\n\n16 Bit Hits: Joe Montana Sports Talk Football - Genesis\n\nStay tuned for more GamePro TV!\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfM6SSJpPKA\n\nGamePro TV Episode 4 - \"Cheese Bridge and Soda Lake\" Edition\n\nNOTE: When I label these videos \"Episode 4\" and such, I don't mean it is the actual fourth episode of GamePro TV produced. It just means that it's the fourth episode I recorded. Unless GamePro decides to put up episodes of their TV show on their Web site, or if someone else has a more complete collection of episodes than I do, then I will continue to label them as \"1, 2, 3, etc.\" up until the very last episode posted. And I still got a few hours left on the video tape, so there's more episodes to come!\n\n... but, yeah, there's still no B-man in the other eps. I must've missed a big chunk of episodes featuring him. Please tell me someone else recorded this show!\n\nSWAT: Battletoads - NES, Gradius III - SNES, Castlevania 2 - Game Boy, Super Mario World - SNES, Low G Man - NES\n\nAsk the Pros: Bionic Commando - NES\n\nPro Review: Treasure Master - NES\n\nInside Info: Top 10 NES Video Game Rentals Feb. 1992 - Blockbuster Video, Ninja Gaiden III (Ending) - NES\n\n16 Bit Hits: Super Adventure Island - SNES\n\nViewer SWAT: Legend of Zelda - NES\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um-y00_qd2c\n\nGamePro TV Episode 5 - \"THECRUSHEL\" Edition\n\nSWAT: ToeJam & Earl - Genesis, Mega Man IV - NES, Super Castlevania IV - SNES, Bonk's Revenge - TG16, Devil's Crush - TG16, El Viento - Genesis\n\nAsk The Pros: Bill & Ted's Excellent Video Game Adventure - NES\n\nPro Review: Tiny Toon Adventures - NES\n\n16 Bit Hits: Lemmings - SNES\n\nInside Info: Top 10 NES Video Game Rentals Feb. 1992 - Blockbuster Video\n\nViewer SWAT: Turrican - Genesis\n\nAlso, apparently this show is \"2 legit\" (you'll see at the end of the episode).\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msJ_ynFvcTA\n\nGamePro TV Episode 6 - \"007 373 5963\" Edition\n\nSWAT: Treasure Master - NES, Aero Blasters - TG16, Powerball - Genesis, Super Mario World - SNES, Maniac Mansion - NES, Operation C - Game Boy\n\nAsk the Pros: Dragon Warrior - NES\n\nPro Review: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: The Manhattan Project - NES\n\n16 Bit Hits: Smash TV - SNES\n\nInside Info: Top 10 NES Video Game Rentals Feb. 1992 - Blockbuster Video, Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! - NES, Captain Planet and the Planeteers (plus a lecture about environmental awareness from J.D.
