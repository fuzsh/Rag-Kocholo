        "text": "January\n\nSports!\n\nWhile EA’s John Madden Football and Take-Two’s “2K” games have dominated sports genres in the last couple of decades now, back in the late 80s and early 90s, sports video games were put out by all kinds of companies, whether they were licensed by a pro sports league or not!\n\nArch Rivals was basically a precursor to NBA Jam, maybe the most popular basketball of all time. Lakers vs. Celtics was the start of EA’s run of pretty great basketball sims on the Sega Genesis, which culminated with Team USA Basketball, a celebration of the 1992 Dream Team’s Olympic Gold Medal victory.\n\nSki or Die was essentially Skate or Die but for the downhill sport. Wrestlemania Challenge is my favorite WWF game on the NES. And Tecmo Bowl is still maybe the most famous NES Football game.\n\nI love the early 90s computer graphics that make up this cover. Pre-Photoshop digital work like this always fascinates me!\n\nFebruary\n\nCD Rom Games! Every disc-based game reviewed in this issue is for the TurboGrafx CD peripheral: Final Zone II, Magical Dinosaur Tour, Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective, and something called Murder Club, and there’s a preview for Valis III. I’ve never played any of those games.\n\nIn fact, the only games on this cover I’ve played are Mega Man for Game Boy, and Castle of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse on the Sega Genesis. Both were great sidescrolling platformers for 1991.\n\nI’m not sure who did this cover, but I think the June issue gives a hint.\n\nMarch\n\n“Comic Carts” is the headline, but the animation character Mickey Mouse is the main art piece. Odd.\n\nSilver Surfer and Dick Tracy on NES have become pretty infamous thanks to the Angry Video Game Nerd. Kabuki Quantum Fighter getting a shout-out on the cover is cool, that game is pretty underrated. Operation C is a Game Boy edition of Contra, and Shadow Dancer is the sequel to the Genesis classic, The Revenge of Shinobi.\n\nNot much to say about the art — It’s a recycled piece of Disney stock art.\n\nApril\n\nFrancis Mao returns to draw Bimmy Lee and Jimmy Lee from Double Dragon III: The Sacred Stones on NES. I appreciate that the entire piece is done in red-and-blue, to prevent any confusion about getting the colors of either Lee brother correct, since they’re both both colors!\n\nHey, a preview for the Super Famicon, the Japanese version of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. While the TurboGrafx-16 and Sega Genesis have been out for a couple years at this point, the 16-bit era is about to go into full swing!\n\nBonk’s Revenge (TG16) and Battletoads (NES) are the two highlighted titles in here that I can speak to: They’re both great, but hard as heck. And speaking of Battletoads…\n\nMay\n\nThese guys make Turtles look like pond scum! If you thought the water level on Ninja Turtles 1 was tough, it’s got NOTHING on the ‘Toads Turbo Tunnel stage!\n\nNot sure where this Battletoad art comes from. I think it might be Francis Mao, but he did a great job of getting all three toads — Rash, Zitz, and Pimple — On-model for this cover!\n\nGolden Axe Warrior is a Sega Master System game that’s basically a clone of the original Legend of Zelda on NES. It’s been over a decade since I’ve played it, but I remember enjoying it a lot.\n\nI don’t think I’ve played anything else on this cover… But Whomp ‘Em is maybe the least culturally-sensitive game title of the year.\n\nJune\n\nWill Sonic the Hedgehog leave Mario in the dust? Well, by 2023 we know the answer is emphatically no, but he did give Mario a pretty good run for his money in the 1990s!\n\nRight by the barcode box, there’s text that reads “Gary Yealdhall.” I tried looking that name up, and it looks like he was an illustrator from the Baltimore, Maryland area with a style pretty similar to that Sonic illustration. And, in fact, the Battletoads cover from last issue is a pretty similar style, too. And, that CD-Roms cover from the February issue also has a similar airbrushed style.\n\nI couldn’t find much about Mr. Yealdhall online. If you know more about him, post something in the comments!\n\nJuly\n\nBoy, that Rocketeer game sure was terrible. And this issue has so many baseball games I’ve never played! Valis III, which was previewed in the February issue gets a full review here. And the truly abysmal Who Framed Roger Rabbit game on NES gets covered, too.\n\nI wish I had this issue when I picked up my TurboGrafx-16 a couple of years later. I only ended up owning a couple of games for that console, and the pack-in game was pretty brutal.\n\nThis issue adds the “#1 Video Game Magazine” tagline under the logo, which would stay there for YEARS.\n\nI don’t know where this Rocketeer art comes from, but it’s pretty cool. I wonder if Bo Knows?\n\nSeptember\n\nI never owned this issue, but the cover became iconic, because it was used on the subscription ads for the magazine for a LONG time after this! I may have seen this American Gladiators cover more than I’ve seen episodes of the show.\n\nThe Sega CD gets previewed, even though it was still two years away. More reviews for games that were previewed in earlier issues: Ninja Gaiden III and Bonk’s Revenge, specifically.\n\nOctober\n\nI’m not sure where this cove art comes from, but it looks like someone trying to ape Drew Struzan’s posters.\n\nBill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure (NES) is a terrible game based on a fun movie. Bucky O’Hare (NES) is a great game based on a fun cartoon. Super Ghouls ‘n’ Ghosts (SNES) is solid but way too hard. Toejam & Earl is an underrated Genesis classic. Decapattack is a weird-ass Genesis game that’s not bad enough to be infamous, but not great enough to be considered a classic.\n\nThere are zero NES games listed on this cover! The Super Nintendo has been released, and Nintendo’s first home console is going to get less and less spotlight until the plug is quietly pulled in 1993…\n\nNovember\n\nI don’t know if I can ever express exactly how big and popular the two Addams Family movies were in the early 1990s. I guarantee you that they got the cover feature here for the movie, not for the game.\n\nSuper Castlevania IV is definitely the best game listed on this cover, although Super R-Type was a decent shoot-em-up launch title for the Super Nintendo.\n\nLook, I’m not a sports guy, but it’s weird that there were so many futuristic sports games all released at the same time, right?\n\nI’m pretty sure no TurboGrafx-16 games ever got the cover feature on GamePro after this!\n\nDecember\n\nAnd we finish off the year with the second Simpsons-based game for NES, Bart vs. the World… which isn’t very good. I’m a big fan of Mega Man 4, though! And the Batman game referenced on this cover is Return of the Joker, which is one of the most graphically-advanced games on Nintendo’s 8-bit console.\n\nAll three SNES games listed were bangers for 1991; UN Squadron is a shooter based on the anime series Area 88; Super Adventure Island is a solid platformer and the fourth game in that series (or more if you include the Wonder Boy games); and Final Fight is… not the best port of the game, but it certainly sold a lot of units!"
