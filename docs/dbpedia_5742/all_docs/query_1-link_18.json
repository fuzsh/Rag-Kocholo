The game in italics are runner-ups. The remainder are nominees.\n\n1991 is the first year computer and video games were included in the Games 100; in 1989 Games Magazine covered the best electronic games in a separate article in the December 1989/January 1990 issue.\n\nAs with the Games 100 lists from other years, this list includes items that were not necessarily produced in that year. Additionally, this year included some items that were not games such as solo puzzles.\n\nThe game designer names are typically not included with these lists. This information was researched from the Boardgamegeek website while designer names in parenthesis were determined exclusively from information from other websites."
