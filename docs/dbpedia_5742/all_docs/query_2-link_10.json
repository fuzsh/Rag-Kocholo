All these years, I'm coming to realize the NES has less games like Contra and more like The Rocketeer, and when you wanna add up all the really bad ones, it's a pretty shitty library. You know what? I can't believe I'm saying this, but the NES sucked.\n\nThe Angry Video Game Nerd: I wanna be the Rocketeer, not Cliff in a plane. I wanna be the Rocketeer!\n\n[cuts to the Rocketeer now playable in the plane racing stage]\n\nThe Angry Video Game Nerd: The game just mocked me."
