Play as the heroes or the villains in this action-packed strategy game for two players. Whether for good or evil, you will determine the fate of the future!Interesting Gameplay Features\n\nInspired by the 1991 Disney adventure movie.\n\nIncludes seven beautifully sculpted miniatures of the Rocketeer, Jenny, Peevy, Sinclair, Lothar, Valentine, and the Luxembourg, a high-flying zeppelin.\n\nA two-player strategy game that immerses the players into the events of the movie and the golden age of Hollywood.\n\nOriginal illustrations and design that evokes the art deco style of the 1930s.\n\nPlay a game of cat-and-mouse with the rocket plans and keep them hidden from your opponent.\n\nStay up-to-date and support the site by following Bleeding Cool on Google News today!\n\nAbout Gavin Sheehan\n\nGavin is the current Games Editor for Bleeding Cool.
