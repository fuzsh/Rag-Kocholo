They never made a sequel, but the Rocketeer will get a second chance.\n\nRe: Premium Format Rocketeer\n\nI am almost thinking of going for the Wolverine and Sabretooth PFs over this and get this down the road since it isn't turning into a hot seller. I want to get a PF which will be the easiest and cheapest to get down the road.\n\nBut I do like the Rocketeer PF more than the aforementioned two.\n\nRe: Premium Format Rocketeer\n\nI am almost thinking of going for the Wolverine and Sabretooth PFs over this and get this down the road since it isn't turning into a hot seller.

I honestly think you will have a better chance getting Wolv and Sabre over this, ex at least. I could be wrong but if this turns out like the prototype I see this one being hot after people have it in hand."
