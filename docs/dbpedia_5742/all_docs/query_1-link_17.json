More static games will still support EGA and some, even CGA. For these you can still get away with just an 8088 or 8086 with 640 KB. For sound, Roland MT-32 is still widely supported, but also General MIDI is starting to come in - both are great. Sound Blaster Pro for digital effects.\n\nThe Games"
