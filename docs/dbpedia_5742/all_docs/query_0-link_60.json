        "text": "Approximate Release Date: May 1, 1992\n\nGenre: Action\n\nDeveloper: NovaLogic\n\nPublisher: IGS\n\nI couldn’t get past the first level of The Rocketeer.\n\nThe game starts you off in a plane race on an oval course against a red plane and a blue plane. You have ten laps to finish in first place. Ten laps of the most boring gameplay you’ll ever experience.\n\nJust look at The Rocketeer in motion. It’s ugly and most of the screen is in a side view that is worthless. That little window at the bottom of the screen? That’s what you use to tell if you’re going to run into anything. I never looked at the top window. I quickly got a headache from focusing on such a tiny viewport.\n\nBut try as I might I couldn’t win the stupid race. Blue and Red were too good for me and, quite frankly, it was the opposite of fun or entertaining. Maybe the stuff in The Rocketeer after this first level is amazing and wonderful, but I’ll never know because I don’t want to keep trying to beat the first three minutes of garbage.\n\nThe Rocketeer seems badly thought out at a conceptual level. I don’t know anything about the movie or comic book it is based on, but I have to imagine it’s better than this. Do not play under any circumstance.\n\nTomorrow: If you know what Romance of the Three Kingdoms II is, you know why I’m not looking forward to figuring out how to play it."
