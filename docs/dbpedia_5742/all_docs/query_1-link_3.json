Facing loss of marketshare and an aging console, Nintendo reluctantly designed a new machine. Ten months after the Super Famicom was released in Japan, Nintendo replaced the Nintendo Entertainment System with the SNES in America. The system, which would go on to sell over 49 million units worldwide, included Super Mario World and retailed for US$199.\n\nNotable software releases[ | ]\n\nUnknown dates:\n\nStreet Fighter II (Arcade)\n\nThe mega-popular fighting series receives an overhaul.\n\nMarch:\n\nMarch 4 - Space Quest IV: Roger Wilco and the Time Rippers (PC)\n\nThe fourth Space Quest adventure sees Roger Wilco travel in time, both back to a prior game in the series and forward to a fictional future game.\n\nJune:\n\nJune 23 - Sonic the Hedgehog (game) (Genesis)\n\nA fast-paced side-scrolling platformer, Sonic was designed as Sega's new mascot to steal thunder from rival Nintendo's Mario character.\n\nJuly:\n\nJuly 19 - Final Fantasy IV (SNES)\n\nThis Japanese RPG finds Cecil Harvey uncovering a plot to steal the Crystals of the world.\n\nAugust:\n\nUnknown day - SimCity (SNES)\n\nThe wildly-popular city-building simulation receives a release for the new home console.\n\nAugust 13 - Super Mario World (SNES)\n\nNew to the classic Mario series were Yoshi and the Super Feather, a Raccoon Suit-like powerup giving Mario a cape and allowing him to fly.\n\nAugust 15 - Ninja Gaiden (as Shadow Warriors, NES)\n\nShadow Warriors was the European release of Ninja Gaiden.\n\nAugust 29 - Super Mario Bros. 3 (NES)\n\nThe final chapter of the Super Mario Bros. saga to grace the NES is released in Europe.\n\nNovember:\n\nNovember 1 - Ninja Gaiden (Game Gear)\n\nBeat 'em up action on the go was the focus of this Sega release.\n\nNovember 11 - Ax Battler (Game Gear)\n\nA spin-off of Golden Axe, this hybrid adventure/action RPG was seen as a refined clone of Zelda II, featuring random battles with a side-scrolling perspective.\n\nVideo game releases[ | ]\n\nName Release Date Category Region(s) Platform(s) 'Nam 1965-1975 1991 Video Game United Kingdom Atari ST, Amiga, MS-DOS 1941: Counter Attack August 23, 1991 Video Game Japan PC-Engine SuperGrafx 1943 Kai March 22, 1991 Video Game Japan PC Engine 64th Street: A Detective Story 1991 Video Game North America Arcade 64th Street: A Detective Story 1991 Video Game Japan Arcade 688 Attack Sub 1991 Video Game North America Genesis Abrams Battle Tank 1991 Video Game North America Genesis Acrobat Mission 1991 Video Game Japan Arcade Action 52 1991 Video Game North America Nintendo Entertainment System ActRaiser November, 1991 Video Game North America Super Nintendo Entertainment System Advanced Daisenryaku June 17, 1991 Video Game Japan Mega Drive Advanced Dungeons and Dragons: Heroes of the Lance 1991 Video Game North America Nintendo Entertainment System Advanced Dungeons and Dragons: Heroes of the Lance March 8, 1991 Video Game Japan Family Computer Advanced Dungeons and Dragons: Hillsfar March 21, 1991 Video Game Japan Family Computer Advanced Dungeons and Dragons: Pool of Radiance July 28, 1991 Video Game Japan Family Computer Adventure Island II February, 1991 Video Game North America Nintendo Entertainment System Adventure Island II April 26, 1991 Video Game Japan Family Computer Adventures of Lolo February 21, 1991 Video Game Europe Nintendo Entertainment System Adventures of Lolo 2 1991 Video Game Europe Nintendo Entertainment System Adventures of Lolo 3 September, 1991 Video Game North America Nintendo Entertainment System Ah Eikou No Koshien April, 1991 Video Game Japan Arcade Air Rescue 1991 Video Game North America Arcade Al Unser Jr.'s Turbo Racing 1991 Video Game Europe Nintendo Entertainment System Aldynes February 23, 1991 Video Game Japan PC-Engine SuperGrafx Alice: An Interactive Museum 1991 Video Game Undefined Undefined Alien Breed 1991 Video Game Undefined Undefined Alien Storm 1991 Video Game North America Genesis Alien Storm June 28, 1991 Video Game Japan Genesis American Gladiators October, 1991 Video Game North America Nintendo Entertainment System Andre Panza Kick Boxing 1991 Video Game International TurboGrafx-16 Another World 1991 Video Game Undefined Undefined Arctic Adventure October 9, 1991 Video Game North America DOS Arcus Odyssey June 14, 1991 Video Game International Mega Drive Arlington Horse Racing 1991 Video Game Undefined Undefined Armadillo August 9, 1991 Video Game Undefined Undefined Armed Police Unit Gallop 1991 Video Game Undefined Undefined ASO II: Last Guardian 1991 Video Game North America Neo Geo Astérix (1991) 1991 Video Game Undefined Undefined Asylum (1991) 1991 Video Game Undefined Undefined Atomic Punk 1991 Video Game Undefined Undefined Atomic Punk May 5, 1991 Video Game North America Game Boy Attack of the Killer Tomatoes 1991 Video Game Europe Nintendo Entertainment System Aussie Rules Footy 1991 Video Game Undefined Undefined Avenging Spirit 1991 Video Game International Arcade Ax Battler 1991 Video Game Undefined Undefined Bahamut Senki March 9, 1991 Video Game Japan Mega Drive Bakushou!!
