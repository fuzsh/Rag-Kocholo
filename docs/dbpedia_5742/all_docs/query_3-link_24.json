        "text": "I remember the first time I fell in love with video game art books. It was for one of the Resident Evil games, and it was every bit as glorious as the game. Art books are a must-have for any gamer who appreciates the intricacies of what goes into character and scene design. The credits are so long on games (which is great for employing so much talent!) that players often miss the names of the artists. Art books provide a deeper understanding of artists’ visions for the games while getting to know the artists themselves. They serve to enrich the gaming experience.\n\nOpen world games are one of my favorite to play. Being able to travel all over the map, getting stuck in areas that are meant for higher levels, and exploring the beautiful scenery is fundamental to some gamers for a in-depth journey. Assassin’s Creed games have long been my go-to when seeking out open world games. Assassin’s Creed Mirage, the latest entry into the popular series, is no exception. Set in 862 A.D. Baghdad, I cannot imagine the amount of research that went into bringing that world to life. The game feels so authentic, and it truly transports gamers back in time, all thanks to art director Jean-Luc Sala and a fabulous amount of creative talent in every corner of the art department.\n\nBecause there are so many layers to the game, The Art of Assassin’s Creed Mirage is a wonderful companion piece. Gamers can discover the roots of the game, the incredible research performed, and the painstaking task to make the game so authentic. Everything from jewelry to color choices to weapons and even doors are laid out with well-written explanations for the decisions of the artists. I especially love the explanations behind characters’ costumes and colors, along with all the intricacies that went into every decision about those outfits.\n\nAlong with all of these details is the gorgeous architecture of the city, the desert, and the Tigris River. Each area of the city is so different, and the art book does a fine job of diving into the background of it all. The captivating scenes of the desert, marshlands, and river are also drilled down into an amazing history lesson about ninth-century Baghdad. The last image of Chapter Seven is my absolute favorite. I desperately need a poster of that one.\n\nThe Art of Assassin’s Creed Mirage is a must-buy for any Assassin’s Creed fan. Just like the game, the book can be read and admired over and over and never grow old.\n\nCreative Team: Writer – Rick Barba; Editor – Ian Tucker; Assistant Editor – Anastacia Ferry; Designer – Sarah Terry; Digital Art Technician – Chris Horn; President and Publisher- Mike Richardson\n\nPublisher: Dark Horse Comics\n\nClick here to purchase."
