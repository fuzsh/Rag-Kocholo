        "text": "A transcript of the remarks I delivered today at the USPTO's annual Veterans Day ceremony. Many thanks for the kind comments of those who were there. I was deeply moved to hear that the speech struck a chord with so many who attended or tuned in. Wishing everyone a happy Veterans Day weekend. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸\n\nOur award-winning comms team is hiring more public affairs specialists. If you're interested in serving at the GS-11 grade in one of the best public affairs offices anywhere in the federal government, please consider applying and encouraging others to apply. We have multiple vacancies. This is the announcement for the general public; the one for current government employees, veterans, and others is posted in the comments below.\n\nLast week I made a long overdue pilgrimage to Springfield, Illinois to visit the tomb, home, and old haunts of our 16th (and my favorite) president. Not only did Lincoln own a patent, he also practiced patent law and represented a number of other inventors over the course of his legal career. In an 1858 lecture on discoveries and inventions, he famously declared that before the introduction of patent laws, \"any man might instantly use what another had invented; so that the inventor had no special advantage from his own invention. The patent system changed this; secured to the inventor, for a limited time, the exclusive use of his invention; and thereby added the fuel of interest to the fire of genius, in the discovery and production of new and useful things.\" Author David J. Kent has done a great public service describing Lincoln's passionate commitment to science, technology, and progress in his new book, \"Lincoln: The Fire of Genius.\"\n\nWorking remote this week at the National Summer Teacher Institute, organized by our talented education team at the USPTO. This yearâ€™s Institute has been graciously hosted by Saint Louis University, which, Iâ€™ve learned to my delight as a history buff, is the oldest university west of the Mississippi (though you wouldn't know it from their impressive, very modern campus). Itâ€™s been great fun meeting and hearing from so many passionate teachers who are out there inspiring the next generation of innovators and entrepreneurs in their classrooms around the nation. Our future is in great hands.\n\n\"Dietrick figured he lived so long because he ate well, did everything in moderation and thought ahead, right down to planning and paying for his own funeral. He began to exercise when he was 65 and made a point of never stressing over the small things.\" Yep, that was the Al I remember. His interment is June 21, 11 a.m., at Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery.\n\nRemembering my friend Al Dietrick, who passed away this weekend at the age of 101. A lifelong native of San Antonio, he served in the 141st Infantry Regiment, 36th \"Texas\" Division, during the Second World War: from North Africa to Italy, France, and Germany, all the way to the end. Touring the WW2 battlefields of central Italy with him in 2008 was one of the greatest highlights of my life. Al \"gave\" me this sketch of him, done by an Italian street artist in 1944, when I was writing several articles about him (one of which won a feature journalism award) after our trip. I gave it back to him at his 100th birthday in December 2021. We throw around the word \"hero\" too loosely these days, but I can honestly say that Al was one of the few true (and kindest) heroes I've ever met. May he rest in peace and honor."
