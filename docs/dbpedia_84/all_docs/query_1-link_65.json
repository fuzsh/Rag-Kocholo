        "text": "Congressman John Fleming, M.D., released the following statement about Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki:\n\n\"The end of the Obama Administration would be the best thing for our veterans; but, right now, Eric Shinseki should be fired from his post as VA Secretary.\n\n\"The death of even one veteran left waiting for medical care is one too many, but sadly we now know that dozens of veterans may have died waiting for an appointment. My office has also been contacted by nursing homes that are being forced to move veterans out of their good care because of new and unnecessary requirements by the Obama Administration. I introduced an amendment to this past week's National Defense Authorization Act, seeking to stop this removal of veterans from their nursing homes, but that amendment was not ruled in order.\n\n\"Earlier this week I voted for the VA Accountability Act, a measure that passed the House with overwhelming bipartisan support. Unfortunately, Senate Democrats have not yet allowed a vote on this bill that would at least offer the chance to hold accountable those at the heart of this scandal.\n\n\"My immediate concern for the VA scandal is that we get the proper care for our veterans, and I believe we need a new VA Secretary for that to happen. On a more long-term basis, my fear is that we are witnessing a microcosm of where Obamacare is taking our nation's health care. Expanding government control of your health care decisions, and when you may receive care, is a pathway to the kind of bureaucratic nightmares, long waiting lists, and delayed care that have already cost lives under the VA.\""
