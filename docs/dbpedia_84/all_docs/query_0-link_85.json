This paper presents the capabilities and limitations of a variety of EMP simulator models useful to the Army's EMP survivability programs. Comparisons among frequency and time-domain models are provided for two powerful US Army Research Laboratory EMP simulators: AESOP (Army EMP Simulator Operations) and VEMPS II (Vertical EMP Simulator II).\n\nBurden sharing or burden shifting Armaments cooperation within NATO\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSmith, R.W.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nThis study has explored the nature of decision-making under conditions of conflicting political and economic imperatives. The participants want the cooperative program to succeed. They also want to bear the least burden necessary for success by shifting it to others. The concepts of burden sharing and burden shifting have been explored in the context of armaments cooperation through analysis of six armaments cooperation cases. The cases ranged from the NATO Sea Sparrow Missile System to the 155MM Autonomous Precision Guided Missile. Ideal models of burden sharing and burden shifting were developed to aid the analysis. The resultant theoretical framework ofmoreÂ Â» armaments cooperation within the NATO alliance has been used to explain success or lack of success in cooperative programs. Each case study addressed the categories of: Political Environment, Program Inception, Management Structure, and Results. Comparative analysis between programs was facilitated by using similar criteria for success or failure throughout. Each of the hypotheses making up the ideal models for burden sharing and burden shifting were examined considering the individual cases. An assessment of validity was made. Comparative analysis of selected case pairs facilitated isolation of factors that may have contributed to different results. These assessments were combined and formed the basis for the final conclusions on each hypothesis and their respective importance. This study adds to the theoretical understanding of alliance politics by examining in depth these concepts. It also supports future efforts to understand alliance politics by providing a framework for examining and testing deductively derived propositions against experience.Â«Â less\n\nUS Army Research Laboratory (ARL) Robotics Collaborative Technology Alliance 2014 Capstone Experiment\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2016-07-01\n\nARL-TR-7729 â JULY 2016 US Army Research Laboratory US Army Research Laboratory (ARL) Robotics Collaborative Technology Alliance...TR-7729 â JULY 2016 US Army Research Laboratory US Army Research Laboratory (ARL) Robotics Collaborative Technology Alliance 2014 Capstone...National Robotics Engineering Center, Pittsburgh, PA Robert Dean, Terence Keegan, and Chip Diberardino General Dynamics Land Systems, Westminster\n\n49.

J.; Gallant, A. L.; James, D. L.\n\n2001-12-01\n\nIn 2000, the President of the United States (US) and Congress directed Department of Interior (DOI) agencies to develop a program for monitoring trends in amphibian populations on DOI lands and to conduct research into causes of declines. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) was given lead responsibility for planning and implementing the Amphibian Research and Monitoring Initiative (ARMI) in cooperation with the National Park Service (NPS), Fish and Wildlife Service, and Bureau of Land Management. The program objectives are to (1) establish a network for monitoring the status and distribution of amphibian species on DOI lands; (2) identify and monitor environmental conditions known to affect amphibian populations; (3) conduct research on causes of amphibian population change and malformations; and (4) provide information to resource managers, policy makers, and the public in support of amphibian conservation. The ARMI program will integrate research efforts of USGS, other Federal, and non-federal herpetologists, hydrologists, and geographers across the Nation. ARMI will conduct a small number (~20) of intensive research efforts (for example, studies linking amphibian population changes to hydrologic conditions) and a larger number (~50) of more generalized inventory and monitoring studies encompassing broader areas such as NPS units. ARMI will coordinate with and try to augment other amphibian inventory studies such as the National Amphibian Atlas and the North American Amphibian Monitoring Program. ARMI will develop and test protocols for the standardized collection of amphibian data and provide a centrally managed database designed to simplify data entry, retrieval, and analysis.

Therefore, the Vehicle Technology Directorate requested the reactivation of Glenn's Engine Components Research Lab, Cell 2B, (ECRL 2B). They wanted to test a T700 engine that had been used previously for turboshaft engine research as a partnership between the Army and NASA on small turbine engine research. ECRL 2B had been placed in standby mode in 1997. Glenn's Testing Division initiated reactivation in May 2002 to support the new research effort, and they completed reactivation and improvements in September 2003.\n\nThe Joint Tactical Aerial Resupply Vehicle Impact on Sustainment Operations\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2017-06-09\n\nArtificial Intelligence , Sustainment Operations, Rifle Company, Autonomous Aerial Resupply, Joint Tactical Autonomous Aerial Resupply System 16...Integrations and Development System AI Artificial Intelligence ARCIC Army Capabilities Integration Center ARDEC Armament Research, Development and...semi- autonomous systems, and fully autonomous systems.

Research goals are to reduce weight and noise while increasing life, reliability, and safety. These research goals are achieved by the NASA/Army Mechanical Systems Technology Branch through both in-house research and cooperative research projects with university and industry partners. Some recent significant technical accomplishments produced by this cooperative research are reviewed. The following research projects are reviewed: oil-off survivability of tapered roller bearings, design and evaluation of high contact ratio gearing, finite element analysis of spiral bevel gears, computer numerical control grinding of spiral bevel gears, gear dynamics code validation, computer program for life and reliability of helicopter transmissions, planetary gear train efficiency study, and the Advanced Rotorcraft Transmission (ART) program.\n\nEnergy Engineering Analysis (EEA) program for Red River Army Depot, Texas. Executive summary. Final report\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNONE\n\nThe objectives of this Energy Engineering Analysis (EEA) for RRAD were three fold: Develop a systematic plan of projects which will result in reducing energy consumption. Consider renewable energy sources with the objective of establishing an orderly procedure for reducing use of non-renewable energy sources. Determine the feasibility of Total Energy (TE), Selective Energy (SE), and Central Heating Plant (CHP) concepts using alternative fuels. In essence, an assessment of the entire energy picture at RRAD was undertaken. This report is a summary of that effort. RRAD was originally built during 1941 and 1942 as a reserve ordnance depot for themoreÂ Â» Army. Since then, the missions and activities at RRAD have broadened to the point that it is now one of the largest Army depots in the continental United States. Located just west of Texarkana, Texas, RRAD encompasses an area of approximately 19,886 acres. The primary missions at RRAD are general supply and maintenance of vital Army equipment and ordnance material. The supply activities constitute the stocking, distribution, storage and supply of general Army supplies for the central region of the United States. Supply of vehicles, ammunition and guided missiles from RRAD encompasses a much larger region. The maintenance and repair functions at RRAD consists of the overhaul, modification, conversion and repair of automotive equipment and combat vehicles, missile systems and components, armament, and ammunition. Approximately 5500 people are currently employed at RRAD to carry out its mission.Â«Â less\n\nA Method of Evaluating Laplace Transforms with Series of Complete or Incomplete Beta Functions,\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1982-12-01\n\nDEVELOPMENT COMMAND BALLISTIC RESEARCH LABORATORY ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND , MARYLAND A i ’:-Approved for public rlease; distribution unlimited. c...BLI Aberden Provin Ground 100161102.143 I.

Tip leakage and secondary flow losses have a much greater performance impact on small engine aero-components than on large engines. A brief survey and critique of presently employed sealing concepts is presented. Some recent new research thrusts that show promise for substantial improvement are discussed. An especially promising approach for small engine applications is brush seals. Brush seal concepts are being considered for outer air seal and secondary airflow system seal locations.\n\n76 FR 56406 - Science and Technology Reinvention Laboratory Demonstration Project; Department of the Army; Army...\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2011-09-13\n\n...

Earl\n\n2005-01-01\n\nMost research to assess amphibian declines has focused on local-scale projects on one or a few species. The Amphibian Research and Monitoring Initiative (ARMI) is a national program in the United States mandated by congressional directive and implemented by the U.S. Department of the Interior (specifically the U.S. Geological Survey, USGS). Program goals are to monitor changes in populations of amphibians across U.S. Department of the Interior lands and to address research questions related to amphibian declines using a hierarchical framework of base-, mid- and apex-level monitoring sites. ARMI is currently monitoring 83 amphibian species (29% of species in the U.S.) at mid- and apex-level areas. We chart the progress of this 5-year-old program and provide an example of mid-level monitoring from 1 of the 7 ARMI regions.\n\nAn Assessment of Drug Education-Prevention Programs in the U. S. Army.

Toward that end, tremendous successes have been realized in resuscitative surgery, critical care, rehabilitation, preventive medicine, and in our collective ability to project effective medical care into the most austere locations throughout the globe. Innovation in the care rendered outside of theater hospitals or strategic air evacuation conveyances, however, has not kept the same pace. The US military experience in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam served as a prime source for the development of the tactics, techniques, and procedures which spawned modern civilian sector trauma care and emergency medical services. But this ascendance was driven by the dedicated medics, corpsmen, physicians, nurses, and allied health practitioners from those conflicts who left the military for the civilian sector, leaving their replacements, in many cases, to repeat the same mistakes, and to relearn hard lessons that otherwise might have been assimilated had they been effectively captured and integrated into doctrine and training. A prime example of this phenomenon is the recent acknowledgement of the \"en route care gap\" existing in tactical medical evacuation. The US Army Institute of Surgical Research (USAISR) and the Army emergency medicine community have made a significant commitment toward elucidating the requirements, capability gaps, and a way-forward in search of the development of an integrated prehospital combat casualty care system, nested within the Joint Theater Trauma System.

This article reviews its history, evolution, and transition of its research programs as well as its scientific and military accomplishments, emphasizing the past 25 yr. During the 1990s, USARIEM published a series of pocket guides providing guidance for sustaining Warfighter health and performance in Southwest Asia, Somalia, the former Republic of Yugoslavia, Rwanda, and Haiti. Issues identified during Operation Desert Storm elicited research that improved nutritional guidelines for protracted desert operations; safer use of nuclear, chemical, and biological protective clothing; equipment, development, and fielding of efficient microclimate cooling systems; and effective evaluation of pharmaceuticals to protect soldiers from chemical and biological threats. During the first decade of the 21st century, USARIEM and the Department of the Army published official medical/performance doctrines for operations in the heat and cold and at high altitude. The current Global War on Terrorism focused research to improve doctrines for hot, cold, and high-altitude operations, reduce musculoskeletal training injuries, provide improved field nutrition, more efficient planning for operational water requirements, and improve both military clothing and materiel. This article also describes the critically important interactions and communications between USARIEM and deployed units and the benefits to Warfighters from this association. This report presents USARIEM's unique and world-class facilities, organizational changes, scientific and support personnel, and major research accomplishments, including the publication of 2,200 scientific papers over the past 25 yr.\n\nThe Center for the Army Profession and Ethic (CAPE) Annual Survey of the Army Profession (CASAP FY16)\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2016-12-30\n\nTechnical Report 2016-01 The Center for the Army Profession and Ethic (CAPE) Annual Survey of the Army Profession (CASAP FY16...REPORT TYPE Report of CASAP FY16 Findings 3.

Plans for research programs to support the development of future military rotorcraft are also described. The crew of a combat helicopter must, in general, perform two major functions during the conduct of a particular mission: flightpath control and mission management. Accordingly, the research programs described are being conducted in the same two major categories: (1) flightpath control, which encompasses the areas of handling qualities, stability and control, and displays for the pilot's control of the rotorcraft's flightpath, and (2) mission management, which includes human factors and cockpit integration research topics related to performance of navigation, communication, and aircraft systems management tasks.\n\nForce Reduction Impacts on Resourcing Army Operational Requirements\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2017-03-10\n\nscenarios involving parametric changes to demand for and supply of manpower and equipment from the institutional Army.

Because almost 100% of the proposed building site is located on an uncontrolled landfill that was thought to possibly contain medical, toxic, radioactive, or hazardous waste, it was assumed that remediation of the site might be necessary prior to or in conjunction with excavation. To assess (1) the need for remediation and (2) the potential hazardsmoreÂ Â» to construction workers and the general population, the Baltimore District contracted with Argonne National Laboratory to undertake a site characterization and risk assessment and to develop a foundation-excavation plan.

The PS3 console proved to be ideal for doing precisely the kind of heavy computational lifting HS based algorithms require, and the fact that it is a relatively open platform makes programming scientific applications feasible. The PS3 HADA is a unique parallel-random sampling based anomaly detection approach that does not require prior spectra of the clutter background. The PS3 HADA is designed to handle known underlying difficulties (e.g., target shape/scale uncertainties) often ignored in the development of autonomous anomaly detection algorithms. The effort is part of an ongoing cooperative contribution between the Army Research Laboratory and the Army's Armament, Research, Development and Engineering Center, which aims at demonstrating performance of innovative algorithmic approaches for applications requiring autonomous anomaly detection using passive sensors.\n\nHomeland Security, A Primary Army Function\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2002-01-01\n\nwww.efilmqroup.com/nowhere.html>; Internet; accessed 27 January 2002 . ൕ Ibid., 1-4. 14 Gannon , John C., \"The US Intelligence Community and Biological...Release.
