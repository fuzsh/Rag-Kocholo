        "text": "Yes the VA has really messed up this time, but when you look at the way things are run in this environment, it’s no wonder. The problem is not with the head of the VA, Eric Shinseki..\n\nYou have to look at the way the local VA leaders a hired. Most of them have no training or education in how to manage anything. If anyone need replacing it is not Shinseki. The local administrators should be held accountable.\n\nThis activity has been going on long before Shinseki showed up. The way things work in civil service is to not make waves. Refer any and all problems to first-line supervisor. The local head of the facility only wants positive responses from lower-level managers. Now he has something positive to show his Washington, D.C.\n\nA reward or promotion is probably in order.\n\nA new top administrator will take a year or more to get organized to take any positive corrective action. Meanwhile, more of us veterans get less and less care and some may even die.\n\nGo after the right person and get the job done!\n\nDave Cole, U.S. Army veteran, Cathedral City"
