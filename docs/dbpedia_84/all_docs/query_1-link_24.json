        "text": "VA secretary: I'm committed to restoring integrity\n\nThe findings of the interim report of VA's Office of Inspector General on the Phoenix VA Health Care System are reprehensible to me and to this department, and we are not waiting to set things straight.\n\nI immediately directed the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to contact each of the 1,700 veterans in Phoenix waiting for primary care appointments in order to bring them the care they need and deserve.\n\nI had previously directed an independent site team to comprehensively assess scheduling and administrative practices in Phoenix. This team began its work in April, and we are already taking action consistent with the recommendations of the interim inspector general's report. We will fully implement his remaining recommendations.\n\nEarlier this month, I had also ordered Veterans Health Administration to conduct a nationwide audit of all other major VA health care facilities to ensure understanding of, and compliance with, our appointment policy. More than 200 senior staff are conducting that audit now, and we expect to announce the initial results of that audit in the coming days.\n\nOn May 1, I placed members of the Phoenix leadership on administrative leave. The Office of Inspector General has since requested that VA take no additional personnel actions in Phoenix until its independent, objective review is complete.\n\nWe are doing all we can to accelerate access to care throughout our system and in communities where veterans reside. I've challenged our leadership to ensure we are doing everything possible to schedule veterans for their appointments. We, at the Department of Veterans Affairs, are redoubling our efforts, with commitment and compassion, to restore integrity to our processes to earn veterans' trust.\n\nAfter 38 years in the Army, I am honored and privileged to serve veterans as the secretary of Veterans Affairs, and I remain committed to providing the high-quality care and benefits that veterans have earned and deserve. And we will.\n\nEric K. Shinseki is secretary of Veterans Affairs."
