        "text": "Barack Obama put his embattled Veterans Affairs secretary Eric Shinseki on notice on Wednesday, warning that he may be held personally accountable if forthcoming reports prove officials in his department covered up backlogs in hospital waiting lists.\n\nAppearing alone after a 45-minute meeting with Shinseki at the White House, the president told reporters he expected preliminary results from the first of several investigations into the scandal next week and would then decide whether further personnel changes are necessary.\n\nRobert Petzel, the department's top health official, stood down last week after a stormy Senate committee hearing heard allegations that long-running resource strains in treating veterans and their families at the public network of hospitals had been compounded when staff deliberately falsified data to hide how they were missing waiting list targets.\n\nAsked if the VA secretary had offered to resign during their meeting on Wednesday, Obama paused and replied: “Rick Shinseki serves this country because he cares deeply about veterans and I know that if he thinks he has let our veterans down then he is not going to be interested in continuing to serve.\"\n\n“At this stage Rick is committed to solving the problem and I am going to do everything in my power to help … but I am also going to be waiting to see what the results of all this review process yields.\"\n\nIn his first public intervention since the scandal began to emerge several weeks ago, Obama insisted that if the cover-up allegations were proven, he would take action. “It is dishonourable, it is disgraceful and I will not tolerate it,” he said.\n\nA preliminary report from Shinseki in expected next week, said Obama, followed by a fuller study by White House emissary Rob Nabors next month and a third ongoing investigation by the department's independent inspector general.\n\nThe spiralling scandal erupted a month ago when a whistleblower alleged that secret wait lists were linked the deaths of as many as 40 veterans waiting for care at a Phoenix hospital. The reports have been bolstered by evidence that officials fraudulently manipulated data to hide the size of the waiting list to avoid breaching internal rules. An inspector general for the VA told a Senate panel last week that his office has inspected 17 of the cases and has not found evidence yet that links patient deaths to long wait times.\n\nBut Obama pushed back at claims by veterans groups that delays in treating patients at a VA hospital in Phoenix had contributed to 40 deaths, saying the inspector general had found many of these were chronically ill patients whose deaths may not have been connected to the treatment delay.\n\nIn a 15-minute briefing with reporters, the president also stressed that reports from other whistleblowers around the country still needed to be investigated further before wider lessons could be drawn. “I don't yet know how systemic this is, are there a lot of other facilities cooking the books or is this just an episodic problem,” said Obama.\n\nNevertheless, the president offered only limited support for the VA secretary and said he had urged him to take action on waiting lists even before the reports were completed. “Nobody cares more about our veterans than Rick Shinseki … but I have said to him I want to see what the results of these reports are and there is going to be accountability,” said Obama.\n\n“I am going to expect even before the reports are done that we are seeing significant improvement in how the admissions process takes place in all our of VA facilities.”\n\nThe White House has been under growing pressure to respond to the crisis, particularly ahead of Memorial Day on Monday, when the president typically addresses the need to care for former troops and their families.\n\nThe VA is second-largest bureaucracy in the nation, after the Department of Defense. More than 10 million US veterans are cared for under the VA's expansive public healthcare system, which operates roughly 1,700 hospitals, clinics and other facilities.\n\nThe number of VA facilities being investigated nationwide has expanded to 26 facilities, the VA's Office of Inspector General told the Associated Press on Tuesday – a jump from last week, when acting Inspector General Richard Griffin told a Senate committee that 10 facilities were under investigation.\n\nThe VA benefits system has long been plagued by criticism over extended delays and access to care, and was further strained by the admission of two million new patients since 2009 following the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and policy changes recognizing new post-traumatic stress cases and Agent Orange victims from the Vietnam war\n\nShinseki had promised in March of last year to eliminate the backlog – claims pending for more that 125 days – by the end of 2015. Shinseki also set a target goal for providing medical care to veterans within 14 days.\n\nThe brewing scandal threatens to undermine one of Shinseki greatest achievements as VA secretary: reducing the backlog of compensation cases by nearly half.\n\nSince March of last year the number of cases stuck in the processing system for more than 125 days has fallen dramatically. The number of backlogged claims dropped from 611,000 in March 2013 to 292,300 in May 2014, a decline of roughly 52%, according to VA data."
