Shinseki to be Chief of Staff of the United States Army. If confirmed by the Senate, General Shinseki will succeed General Dennis J. Reimer, who will be retiring later this year after 37 years of distinguished active duty service.\n\nGeneral Shinseki currently serves as the Vice Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army. Immediately prior to assuming his present position, he served as Commander-in-Chief of United States Army Europe and concurrently as Commander of NATO's Stabilization Force in Bosnia. He brings to the position of Chief of Staff extensive operational and joint experience as well as proven leadership ability and a deep concern for the soldiers, civilians and families of the United States Army.\n\nDuring his distinguished career, General Shinseki served two combat tours in Vietnam and has commanded at every level from company through theatre army. As Commander of the Stabilization Force, he directed the operations of the three Multinational Divisions in Bosnia, promoting implementation of the Dayton Accords.\n\nGeneral Shinseki assumes the post of Chief of Staff as the U.S. Army proudly celebrates 224 years of dedicated service to our nation in war and peace. With General Shinseki as Chief of Staff, I am confident that the total Army - Active, Reserve and National Guard -- will continue its tradition of excellence, dedication and professionalism as it enters the 21st century.\n\n# # #"
