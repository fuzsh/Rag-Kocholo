        "text": "#ICYMI Our latest epsiode sees Christian L. sitting down with John Vintar, a Canadian Army | Armée canadienne officer who has served in the Canadian Armed Forces | Forces armées canadiennes for over 30 years and author of the recently published book, 'A Swamp the Size of Belgium,' which details Vintar's experiences in South Sudan. They discuss the history of Sudan and South Sudan, the challenges of peacekeeping missions, the impact on returning soldiers, the perception of peacekeeping in Canada, and the importance of history for military leaders. Takeaways The book 'A Swamp the Size of Belgium' provides a unique perspective on the experiences of a peacekeeper in South Sudan. Peacekeeping missions are often invisible to the majority of Canadians, leading to a lack of understanding and appreciation for the work of peacekeepers. Returning from a peacekeeping mission can be challenging, and veterans may struggle to convey the full extent of their experiences. History plays a crucial role in shaping military leaders and providing valuable lessons for the present and future.

Developing master innovators takes time and discipline. Cleo and Johnny have both made the commitment and are passing on their lessons to others! Cleo built out the #Gemini program for innovators at the ROTC Jr. level. She is developing mastery with project-based learning and innovation ecosystems to empower problem solving. Cleo is dedicated and driven. She loves a challenge! Say it can't be done, and watch her make miracles happen! Johnny is a powerful story-teller, narrative wizard, and leadership guru following the model laid out by Bob Quinn in the #FundamentalStateOfLeadership. His mastery of the Competing Values Framework for understanding organizational effectiveness is second to none!\n\nDoing 🇫🇮 military service this week in the ”Freezing winds” operation with the 🇫🇮Marines, 🇺🇸US Marines & the 🇬🇧Royal Navy + 6 other🇸🇪🇫🇷 NATO entities. I think the strength in the Finnish hard security system, with the military, police, border guard and rescue services included, is the strong support and trust within the people. Mainly this is because the system is built on that everyone is or can be involved and engaged. My first leadership education and training was in the Marines early in my career. Later I have been growing these skills in training, education and 20 years of civillian practice of leadership in different roles. Now I am happy that these accumulated skills and experience are appriciated in the military. Both worlds can gain something from the other. 🇫🇮#military #business #leadership\n\nI think this is an important paper that anyone who cares about our military and our nation should read. Some of my thoughts: 1. I completely agree with the Culture Shift of Mission Command and \"disciplined disobedience.\" Easy to say - tough to do but we have to embrace it. 2. Agree on all points of technology and the need to operate routinely dispersed, disconnected, and in multi-domain including commercial. 3. The idea of a move towards partial conscription is interesting but I think unworkable. It is not the American Way of War to have a large standing Army and even when we had conscription it was short. Even FDR on the eve of Pearl Harbor would not have been able to get support for the draft and today there is no support. So what do we do? I would have liked to see an embracing of Coalition/Allies. America's super power is that we have friends and our threat does not.\n\nThough not a U.S. Army School of Advanced Military Studies (SAMS) text, this book contains useful insights. The Roman military took 14 years to adapt to the warfighting methods of an innovative and resourceful enemy. The successful (if unpopular) approaches of Fabius and Scipio Africanus compensated for much less effective leaders. Roman success was ultimately due to its ability to continually regenerate capability and its strategic and operational endurance. A key passage: \"The factor which, in the end, defeated the invader was not the ability of Rome's generals, but the strength and vitality of her political institutions.\" How ready is our system, both internal and external to our Armed Forces, to sustain and prosecute a protracted, large scale conflict? The Army University Marshall Scholars at the US Army School of Advanced Military Studies U.S. Army Combined Arms Center US Army TRADOC\n\nFriday morning we hosted our first LPD (Learning Professional Development) program with the US Army CASCOM command group (including Major General Simerly and Brigadier General Allen) and the US Army logistics schools at Fort Gregg-Adams. There were even British and German officers present. We lead a tour of our Breakthrough Battlefield (I'm pictured at our Breakthrough site along the park's two miles of defenses) then their instructor and garrison commander led a classroom presentation. The training compared the American Civil War to the Russo-Ukraine War taking place today. The topic of breaching enemy defenses was germane to our Breakthrough Battle and it was interesting to hear about modern Russian/Ukrainian capabilities and breaching/supply doctrines. This illustrates how history is relevant today. Learning from past military failures and successes can help shape military doctrine and lead to victory on the battlefield."
