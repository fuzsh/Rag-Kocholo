I respect his decision to step down if he and President Obama have determined that his departure is necessary for the next steps of reform at Veterans Affairs to take place. I commend Secretary Shinseki for his leadership and his service and respect his difficult decision today.\n\nI am disappointed that someone of his unquestionable character, integrity, love of veterans, and ability to manage large organizations was unable to prevent this situation. It is absolutely essential that any and all steps must be taken to ensure that the unconscionable acts that denied veterans care at the Phoenix Veterans Affairs Health Clinic have not occurred elsewhere, that those responsible are held accountable, and that this never happens again. I have confidence in our President that he will do all that is necessary toward this end.\"\n\n###"
