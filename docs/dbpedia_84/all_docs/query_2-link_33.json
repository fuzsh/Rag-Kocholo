        "text": "As the war drew near, the dispute about how to conduct it became public. On February 25 [2003] the Senate Armed Services Committee summoned all four Chiefs of Staff to answer questions about the war--and its aftermath. The crucial exchange began with a question from the ranking Democrat, Carl Levin. He asked Eric Shinseki, the Army Chief of Staff, how many soldiers would be required not to defeat Iraq but to occupy it. Well aware that he was at odds with his civilian superiors at the Pentagon, Shinseki at first deflected the question. \"In specific numbers,\" he said, \"I would have to rely on combatant commanders' exact requirements. But I think ...\" and he trailed off.\n\n\"How about a range?\" Levin asked. Shinseki replied--and recapitulated the argument he had made to Rumsfeld.\n\nI would say that what's been mobilized to this point, something on the order of several hundred thousand soldiers, are probably, you know, a figure that would be required.\n\nWe're talking about post-hostilities control over a piece of geography that's fairly significant, with the kinds of ethnic tensions that could lead to other problems. And so, it takes significant ground force presence to maintain safe and secure environment to ensure that the people are fed, that water is distributed, all the normal responsibilities that go along with administering a situation like this.\n\nTwo days later Paul Wolfowitz appeared before the House Budget Committee. He began working through his prepared statement about the Pentagon's budget request and then asked permission to \"digress for a moment\" and respond to recent commentary, \"some of it quite outlandish, about what our postwar requirements might be in Iraq.\" Everyone knew he meant Shinseki's remarks.\n\n\"I am reluctant to try to predict anything about what the cost of a possible conflict in Iraq would be,\" Wolfowitz said, \"or what the possible cost of reconstructing and stabilizing that country afterwards might be.\" This was more than reluctance--it was the Administration's consistent policy before the war. \"But some of the higher-end predictions that we have been hearing recently, such as the notion that it will take several hundred thousand U.S. troops to provide stability in post-Saddam Iraq, are wildly off the mark.\"\n\nThis was as direct a rebuke of a military leader by his civilian superior as the United States had seen in fifty years. Wolfowitz offered a variety of incidental reasons why his views were so different from those he alluded to: \"I would expect that even countries like France will have a strong interest in assisting Iraq's reconstruction,\" and \"We can't be sure that the Iraqi people will welcome us as liberators ... [but] I am reasonably certain that they will greet us as liberators, and that will help us to keep requirements down.\" His fundamental point was this: \"It's hard to conceive that it would take more forces to provide stability in post-Saddam Iraq than it would take to conduct the war itself and to secure the surrender of Saddam's security forces and his army. Hard to imagine.\""
