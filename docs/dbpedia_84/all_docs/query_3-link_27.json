        "text": "WASHINGTON, DC — Ret. Gen. Eric Shinseki, West Point class of 1965, will try to convince congress Wednesday that he’s the right pick for Secretary of Veteran Affairs under President-elect Barack Obama.\n\nShinseki, 66, made waves several years ago when he clashed with Donald Rumsfeld, then secretary of defense, over the number of troops the United States would need to invade Iraq. Shinseki was Army chief of staff when he testified to the U.S. Senate Armed Services committee that several hundred thousand soldiers would be required in postwar Iraq – an estimate far higher than Rumsfeld’s.\n\nIf appointed, Shinseki will take the reigns of another force whose needs were severely underestimated under the Bush administration. The Veterans Affairs Department has been lambasted for being ill-equipped and under-funded to serve troops injured in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nObama said his pick will build a 21st century VA. “No one will ever doubt that this former Army chief of staff has the courage to stand up for our troops and our veterans,” he said at a press conference. “No one will ever question whether he will fight hard enough to make sure they have the support they need.”\n\nBorn in Hawaii to Japanese-American parents, Shinseki served in Vietnam and Bosnia and became the first Asian American promoted to four-star general in the U.S. military and the first to hold the Army’s top position. He retired in June 2003, a few months after the U.S. invasion of Iraq.\n\nAs head of veterans affairs, Shinseki would become the principal advocate for veterans and direct the nation’s second largest cabinet department. He'd oversee the nationwide system of health care services, benefits programs, and national cemeteries for veterans and their dependents. Shinseki would succeed Dr. James Peake, West Point Class of 1966, who was nominated by President Bush in October 2007.\n\nWatch Shinseki's congressional testimony live online Wednesday at www.c-span.org.\n\najames@th-record.com"
