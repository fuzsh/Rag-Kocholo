You can certainly command without that sense of commitment, but you cannot lead without it.\n\nQuoted in \"Forever Young: Ten Gifts of Faith for the Graduate\" - Page 156 - by Pat Williams, Karen Kingsbury - Religion - 2005\n\nI do not want to criticize while my soldiers are still bleeding and dying in Iraq.\n\nGeneral Eric K. Shinseki to associates; quoted in Shanker, Thom (January 12, 2007). \"New Strategy Vindicates Ex-Army Chief Shinseki\". The New York Times .\n\nIt has been very humbling and gratifying to have these men as our role models... Your generation enabled America to close out the twentieth century as the greatest nation in the history of mankind, the only remaining superpower, the world's leading economy and the world's most respected and feared military force in the world- respected by our friends and allies, feared by our adversaries.\n\nAbout the Medal of Honor awardees. Quoted in \"Rising Sons\" - Page 260 - by Bill Yenne - History - 2007\n\nQuotes about Shinseki\n\n[edit]\n\nGeneral Keane is, as is General Shinseki, they're outstanding Army officers. There's just no question about it. And they say what they believe, and they tell the truth. And they're honorable people and talented people.\n\nDonald Rumsfeld, \"Testimony by Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld on Crusader Artillery System before Senate Armed Services Committee (transcript)\". United States Department of Defense (May 16, 2002).
