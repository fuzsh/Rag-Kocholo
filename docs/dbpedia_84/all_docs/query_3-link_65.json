        "text": "LIHU’E — Retired Gen. Eric Shinseki, a Lihu‘e native and former Army chief of staff and Veterans Affairs secretary, is the 2023 recipient of the Association of the U.S. Army’s highest award, states the AUSA website.\n\nThe George Catlett Marshall Medal, awarded for distinguished and selfless service, is presented annually during the association’s annual meeting and exposition in Washington, D.C.\n\nShinseki, a Kaua‘i High graduate and 1965 graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, was chosen for AUSA’s annual award for his decades of selfless service to the United States, and particularly because of his many efforts to support the Army and its soldiers and veterans.\n\nHe is currently chairman of the Army Historical Foundation board.\n\n“Gen. Eric Shinseki has dedicated his life to serving his country and others,” said retired Gen. Bob Brown, AUSA president and CEO.\n\n“He is the epitome of a selfless servant, a leader of character and intellect, and a tireless advocate for our service members and their families,” said Brown. “His deep commitment to America’s Army and the nation’s veterans has had a lasting impact, and I am proud the Association of the U.S. Army is recognizing him with our highest award.”\n\nBorn less than a year after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Shinseki was inspired to join the Army by his uncles, who served in the famed 442nd Regimental Combat Team during World War II, according to Britannica.\n\nUpon graduating from West Point, Shinseki served two combat tours in Vietnam, first as an artillery forward observer, and then as commander of A Troop, 3rd Squadron, 5th Cavalry, according to the Army Historical Foundation.\n\nShinseki was wounded twice in combat, including an injury during his second deployment that cost him part of his right foot, according to Britannica and his Veterans Affairs bio. He spent almost a year recovering, but returned to active duty in 1971.\n\nShinseki, who has a master’s degree in English from Duke University, served as an instructor at West Point before moving on to assignments in the Pentagon and Europe, according to Britannica.\n\nIn June 1997, Shinseki became the first Asian American to achieve the rank of four-star general, assuming duties as commander of U.S. Army Europe, Allied Land Forces Central Europe and the NATO Stabilization Force in Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\nHe served as the 34th Army chief of staff from June 1999 to June 2003.\n\nHe retired from the Army in August 2003.\n\nIn 2008, Shinseki was nominated to serve as VA secretary, serving from January 2009 to May 2014."
