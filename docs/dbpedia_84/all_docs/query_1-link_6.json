SHINSEKI, TO BE SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS ---------- WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 14, 2009 U.S. Senate, Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Washington, DC. The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:07 a.m., in room 106, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Daniel K. Akaka, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. Present: Senators Akaka, Rockefeller, Murray, Tester, Webb, Sanders, Burr, Specter, Isakson, Hutchison, and Wicker. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL K. AKAKA, CHAIRMAN, U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII Chairman Akaka. The U.S. Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs hearing will come to order. Today's hearing is to consider the nomination of Eric Shinseki to be Secretary of Veterans Affairs. I have known General Shinseki and his family for many years. Indeed, I had the honor and privilege of participating at his promotion ceremony, way back when he became a Colonel. I look forward to working with him in the latest chapter of his notable career as Secretary of Veterans Affairs. I am delighted to welcome with much aloha this distinguished native of Hawaii. His wife, Patty, is here, and Tim, their son-in-law, is here. Following the inauguration next week, President Obama intends to formally nominate those individuals he has selected for cabinet positions, including General Shinseki. The plan is for most, if not all of those nominations, to go directly to the Executive Calendar and to be voted on later that day. Thus, it is my hope that General Shinseki will be confirmed by the Senate on January 20. This is the same process that was followed in connection with the nominees to head VA during the last two changes in Administration. My friend, Senator Inouye, and former Senator Bob Dole will elaborate on General Shinseki's long and distinguished career in the Army, which culminated in his service as the Army's 34th Chief of Staff. I will simply note that he graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1965 and that he served two combat tours in Vietnam, where he was wounded twice in combat. It was the second injury that could have ended his promising Army career. It did not end because then-Captain Shinseki fought to remain on active duty, and in an inspired decision, the Army agreed. Throughout his 38 years of service in uniform, he gave his personal best, serving with great pride and dignity. This distinguished and decorated soldier set a new standard for the Army. He transformed the Army into an agile, lean, flexible, and lethal fighting force. He set a higher standard for those to follow, while keeping the spirit of aloha. With his pride and dedication to service, he made our Army stronger. General Shinseki, you will have tremendous challenges facing you. Heading VA is a challenging job, and that is even more true in a time of war. VA must not only meet the needs of those from prior conflicts, but also quickly adapt to address the needs of those newly injured or disabled. Each war brings different challenges and different demands. With Iraq and Afghanistan, VA is responding to new challenges: Veterans needing state-of-the-art prosthetics or age-appropriate long-term care for injuries that will last a lifetime. The Department must also confront less obvious and visible wounds, such as PTSD and TBI. Another area that needs prompt attention is the system for compensating servicemembers and veterans for in-service injury. The frustrating lack of timeliness and the challenge of coordinating DOD and VA's systems are some of the areas that must be addressed quickly. This Committee stands ready to work with the administration on this effort. If you are confirmed, this must be one of your highest priorities. You will also need to focus on the transition for injured servicemembers from active duty to veteran status. A lot of work has been done over the last 2 years, and I am hopeful that your long experience in the Army will enable you to continue these efforts. For returning servicemembers, especially those who are seriously injured, there must be a truly seamless transition from DOD to VA. VA has a strong and dedicated workforce of employees who seek to do what is right. The Secretary, with the backing of the Congress, must give those employees the leadership, the tools, and especially the resources they need to carry out their jobs. If confirmed, one of your first responsibilities will be to ensure that the 2010 budget is adequate for the coming fiscal year. When VA is doing its best, few notice. But things are not perfect within VA. Few human endeavors ever are. If a veteran receives less than what is expected, it can lead to an indictment of the entire VA system. Complaints must be investigated and problems must be fixed; but, individual failings should not lead to the indictment of the entire system. In closing, I am confident that you have a strong sense of empathy for those served by VA and a deep commitment to VA's mission. This will serve you well as Secretary. I applaud your effort to avoid even the appearance of any conflict of interest in connection with your stock portfolio, your private consulting firm, and the boards on which you serve. I trust that all fair-minded individuals will appreciate the steps you have taken to preclude even an appearance of any conflict of interest. With respect to the rest of your team, this Committee has a strong history of bipartisanship and this is especially true with respect to nominations. As quickly as the administration can send forward other advice and consent positions for VA, I promise that the Committee will take action. I look forward to your testimony, your responses to questions from Committee Members, and to any post-hearing questions. It is vitally important that the position of Secretary of Veterans Affairs be confirmed as soon as possible. There is a roll call vote, by the way, which is scheduled to start at 10:30. My hope is that we can continue the hearing with some Senators voting at the start of the roll call and then returning, at which time other Senators would leave to vote. If we reach a point where there is no Senator available to continue the hearing process, there will be a brief recess. So, let me call on our Ranking Member for his statement. STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD BURR, RANKING MEMBER, U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH CAROLINA Senator Burr. Good morning, Mr. Chairman. Aloha. And to our colleagues, let me say to you and them how much I look forward in the 111th Congress--to us working together to improve the lives of our Nation's veterans and their families. I want to welcome General Shinseki and congratulate you on your nomination to serve as the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs. I have personally had the opportunity to sit down with General Shinseki and to review his extensive credentials. It is clear to me, and I think it is clear to all Members, that you have the experience, you have the leadership skills, you have the determination needed to serve in a very important and challenging position as Secretary of Veterans Affairs; and I certainly welcome you and your family here today. Let me take a slightly different tack than what the Chairman took. The Chairman has to say, ``if you are confirmed.'' Let me say this, General, ``When you are confirmed as the head of the VA,'' you would be entrusted with one of the most noble missions of the Federal Government, and that is caring for the men and women who have served and sacrificed on behalf of our entire Nation. That means providing veterans and their families with a broad range of benefits and services that they need to live full and productive lives and making sure that our fallen heroes are honored and memorialized. But, as we will discuss today, the next Secretary will face many serious challenges in carrying out that mission. With our Nation continuing to fight conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, we have men and women returning home with the physical and psychological wounds of war. For those who leave the military, the goal must be to ensure they are quickly and effectively provided with the benefits and services that they need to return to civilian life as closely as possible as to how they left. Unfortunately, too many wounded servicemembers do not experience a seamless transition from active duty to civilian life. General, I look forward to hearing your thoughts on how we can prevent these wounded warriors from falling through the proverbial crack. Our Nation is also facing the highest unemployment rates in nearly 16 years, which may lead veterans who lose their jobs to seek health care from the VA for the very first time. General, as Secretary, your charge would be to ensure that as more veterans come into the system, the quality of the health care provided by the VA does not deteriorate. This challenge will be even greater in States like mine of North Carolina, where the number of veterans is growing and where VA capacity is already stressed beyond its capable means. In addition, the next Secretary will be responsible for implementing the new Post-9/11 GI Bill. At a minimum, that means making sure veterans and their families receive the correct amount of benefits on time. But it also means providing user-friendly benefits that allow veterans and their families to make the educational choices that best meet their needs. General, considering all the challenges that lie ahead, I appreciate your willingness to serve our Nation in this very important role. I congratulate you again on your nomination and, more importantly, I look forward to working with you on behalf of our Nation's veterans and their families. I thank you, General. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Akaka. Thank you very much, Senator Burr. Before we continue with opening statements of the Committee, I would like to call on our two distinguished World War II veterans, my esteemed senior Senator, Dan Inouye, and our former colleague, Senator Bob Dole, for their introduction of General Shinseki. I will leave it to the two of you to decide on the order of your introductions. [Laughter.] Senator Inouye. You are older. [Laughter.] Chairman Akaka. Senator Dole? PRESENTATION OF GENERAL ERIC K. SHINSEKI, U.S. ARMY (RETIRED), PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE TO BE SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS, BY HON. BOB DOLE, FORMER UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF KANSAS Senator Dole. Well, you know, like everybody on this Committee, we are all concerned about our veterans. There are 25 million-plus veterans, so this is no small job that you are undertaking. I have read all the material I could find. I don't know of anything you haven't done. You have been twice wounded. You have been on that side. You have been a patient. You understand the needs of patients. You know that, obviously, priority number 1 are deserving veterans; and the great majority are. But, there are always some who may be gaming the system. I am honored to be here, not only with you but with my former colleague, Senator Inouye. A little trivia. We were wounded a week apart, a mile apart, or a hill apart in Italy near the close of the war. We wound up in the same hospital, along with Colonel Hart, who the Hart Building is named after. So, here are three of us--we don't know whether it is politics or whatever--who found ourselves together in the U.S. Senate. They were both wonderful men; and the Hart Building is named after Phil Hart because he was the conscience of the Senate. I never heard him utter a bad word about any other colleague on or off the board. He was just a great mentor for me because before I decided to run, I came to Washington and had a long visit with Phil Hart. Dan, as an aside, was the best bridge player at Percy Jones General Hospital. We had nothing else to do, so we stayed up all night, and I think he won the championship. I don't know how many entries there were, but he won the championship. I think one thing that ought to be noted here, we have General Shinseki succeeding General Peake and these guys have been long-time friends. It will be a seamless transition and they will be working together whenever they need each other. I don't know what General Peake has in mind, but I want to personally thank him for what he has done. I particularly want to thank General Shinseki for all he has done from Vietnam to Bosnia to Afghanistan and Iraq to the present day: for his willingness, again, to offer his dedication, knowledge, and experience to this country. I know his assignment will take time away from his cherished grandchildren, which is not easy, particularly when General Shinseki has already given so much to his country. As I said, when Senator Inouye and I had the pleasure of introducing the current Secretary, it is good to have a Secretary who is impatient and who knows what it is like to have been in the system succeeding General Peake. He has lived with disability since his service in Vietnam and I cannot believe a day does not go by where he is not inconvenienced in some way in his life because of the sacrifices he has already made for his country. He is a West Point graduate, as was General Peake. That doesn't mean he won't care for those in the Navy and all the other branches---- [Laughter.] Senator Dole [continuing]. But it is just another indication that this is a man of quality. We are lucky to have him. I think he was--you were the Army Chief of Staff when Peake was appointed Surgeon General, which I am certain you had something to do with. But anyway, as I said, they are long-time friends and this will be one of the easiest transitions there is. He will be a strong voice for veterans in the new administration. He has a profile, and I don't condemn anybody who was VA Secretary in the past, but when you have a General with a record like his--he is going to have young men and women who are patients or looking for help after they are out of the hospital knowing that they have confidence in the leader of the VA system. This means a lot to people. They may never get to meet the General, but they have got to think in their mind, ``here is a man who has been through it, here is a man who understands it, and I feel better about what is going to happen.'' I was on a flight--I think we were going to Kyrgyzstan. I wasn't certain I knew where it was. But on the way to the flight, a colonel who happened to be from Kansas came over to me and said, ``I just want to visit a while.'' When he left he said, ``Before you get off the plane or sometime,'' and he gave me his card. And on the back was a quote by John Stewart Mill and this is a quote. ``War is an ugly thing,'' it read, ``but it is not the ugliest of things. The decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse. The person who has nothing to which he is to fight for which is more important than his own personal safety is a miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made so and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself,'' end of quote. This is something that I know our friend General Shinseki understands. As a free country, America honors its commitments, and the first of those commitments is to support men and women in uniform and their families who risk everything in most cases. We will meet our commitments because we have a committee such as we have, and we have men like the new Secretary who will serve and do everything that should be done for our deserving veterans and promised them by a grateful Nation. As the Members of this Committee know, I joined former HHS Secretary Donna Shalala on a Presidential Commission examining the care we provide our warriors in VA and DOD facilities. I think it is fair to say there were nine of us on the Committee, of which five had disabilities. And whatever you think about President Bush, we had several meetings with the wounded veterans and the only thing he ever told us was that he was responsible for what happened to each one of these young men and young women. He said, ``Do whatever it takes.'' Nobody was asked the cost, nobody was asked the politics; and that is the way it should be, and that is the way it will be with the new Secretary. So, I think I was pleased, President Bush was pleased, and many Members of Congress were pleased with the recommendations of the Dole-Shalala Commission. And if not, I know Congress will make changes. We made recommendations where we thought if somebody lost an arm, for example, even though it is indirectly compensated, there should be a separate compensation because that quality-of-life has gone from a ten to a two or three or four, and the same for anybody else with a serious injury. It doesn't have to be physical. It can be TBI or those very bad cases of PTSD. That is just one example that we think Congress should take a hard look at. When I called General Shinseki to offer help, I learned that being Secretary of VA is not considered a political appointment, and I compliment President-elect Obama for keeping the VA that way. Of any cabinet I can think of in the government that should not be political, it is the Veterans Administration. Nobody knew when we went to war whether we were Democrats, Republicans, Independents. Nobody knows. It doesn't make much difference to the veterans today. They are just looking for some decent, honest person like General Shinseki to provide them leadership. The President-elect has made a wise choice and his appointment is yet another powerful indicator of how we care for and respect our men and women who serve our country. I cannot think of a better person to look after our 25 million- plus veterans than this true American hero, who has done about everything one can think of for his country. I wish I were still in the Senate so I could vote for his confirmation. God bless America, General Shinseki, and our men and women whose service has kept us free. I ask that my statement be made a part of the record. [The prepared statement of Senator Dole follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Bob Dole, Former U.S. Senator from Kansas Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee. I'm pleased to be here with my former colleague and dear friend, Senator Dan Inouye, to introduce an American hero. General Shinseki has an outstanding, impeccable record of service and personal sacrifice for our country. I personally thank him for all he has done from Vietnam, to Bosnia, to Afghanistan and Iraq, to the present day for his willingness again to offer his dedication, knowledge and experience to this country. I know he his assignment will take time away from his cherished grandchildren, which is not easy, particularly when General Shinseki has already given as much as he has. As I said when Senator Inouye and I had the pleasure of introducing the current Secretary, General James Peake: it is good to have a Secretary who has been a patient and who knows what it is like to have been in the system. General Shinseki has lived with a disability since his service in Vietnam. A day does not go by that he is not inconvenienced in some way or his life affected because he sacrificed for his belief in his country. General Shinseki is a West Point graduate as was General Peake. He was Army Chief of Staff when the President appointed Secretary Peake Army Surgeon General. Both men were wounded twice in Vietnam. They are long time friends. With General Shinseki following General Peake the President-elect is doing the right thing by ensuring continuity for our veterans--who deserve the best and they will get it with this appointment. General Shinseki will be a strong voice for vets in the new administration and an individual who truly knows what our commitment to deserving veterans should be. About two years ago I was on a flight with a colonel who was headed to Afghanistan for a second time. He handed me a card and on the back was a quote by John Stewart Mill: ``War is an ugly thing,'' it read, ``but it is not the ugliest of things. The decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse. The person who has nothing for which he is willing to fight, nothing which is more important than his own personal safety, is a miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself.'' This is something General Shinseki understands. As a free country, America honors its commitments, and the first of those commitments is support to men and women in uniform and their families who risk everything in most cases. We will keep our commitment because we have men like General Shinseki who will serve and do everything that should be done for our deserving veterans and promised them by a grateful Nation. As the Members of this Committee know, in 2007, I joined former HHS Secretary Donna Shalala on a Presidential Commission examining the care that we provide to our warriors returning home from our recent and ongoing wars. We found excellent care within the DOD and VA systems, but we also found many challenges that needed to be addressed so that patients and families were not burdened more than they already are when a loved one in the service faces serious injury or a lifelong disability. I was pleased that President Bush and many Members of Congress in both parties took many, if not all, of our recommendations to heart. They were recommendations that we constructed through what we believe was rigorous examination and broad input from many people that know the system inside and out, what its strengths and what its weaknesses are. When I called General Shinseki and offered to help, I learned he does not consider being Secretary of VA a political appointment and I compliment President-elect Obama for keeping the VA that way. The VA certainly should be free of politics. The President-elect has made a wise choice and his appointment is yet another powerful indicator of how we care for, and respect, our men and women who serve our country. I cannot think of a better person to look after our 25 million plus veterans than this true American hero who has done about everything one can think of in serving his country. I wish I were still in the Senate so I could vote for his confirmation. God Bless America, General Shinseki, and our men and women whose service has kept us free. Chairman Akaka. Thank you. Your statement will be included in the record and thank you very much, Senator Dole. Now, Senator Dan Inouye. PRESENTATION OF GENERAL ERIC K. SHINSEKI, USA RETIRED, PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE TO BE SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS, BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF HAWAII Senator Inouye. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, Senator Burr, and distinguished Members of this Committee. I am grateful for this opportunity to appear before you with my very dear friend, Bob Dole, Senate Majority Leader, to present General Shinseki, President-elect Obama's nominee to serve as Secretary of the VA. In Hawaii, our favorite word is aloha, but second to that is the word ``ohana,'' and that word means family. But a Hawaiian family includes men and women not necessarily of blood kinship, but united by shared concerns and shared beliefs. Yes, that is ohana. I had the great honor of standing with Senator Oren Long, Hawaii's first elected Senator, to nominate General Shinseki to the United States Military Academy at West Point. Since that appointment and his acceptance, I have naturally followed his career. In his initial tour of duty in Vietnam, he did well, but he suffered a grievous injury. Most Americans are not aware of this, but he has an amputated foot. Any other man would have justifiably resigned himself to civilian life and retired from the military. It would have been an honorable thing to do. However, General Shinseki pleaded to remain on active duty despite the hardship and physical pain. Well, this is just one measure of the man who appears before you today, an unflinching devotion to our country and to his duty. His plea was granted. General Shinseki's service encompassed both further study. He got his Master's from Duke University and later at the United States Army Command and General Staff College and National War College. These studies, together with an astute grasp of the pragmatic, and the quality of his leadership, supported a steadily spiraling course upward through the ranks of the Army. That is another measure of General Shinseki: the stamina required for sustained excellence. During my service as a Senator, I had the occasion to go to Kosovo and I was so proud when I met General Shinseki, Commanding General of Kosovo Operations. At that time, I was certain that his career would blossom further. In June 1999, General Shinseki became the Chief of Staff of the United States Army. His tenure in that high post included the onset of the Iraq War. As we move from the emotional frenzy of commencing hostilities, Members of Congress began to have questions, most notably whether we had adequate resources to succeed in this war, and obviously General Shinseki was called upon to testify at hearings. I think most of us expected the General to give the standard line that any administration would favor. But as we all know, he did not. He told the truth. It wasn't easy, and in so doing took a position contrary to his Commander-in-Chief. His honest assessment that more troops would be needed cost him his job, but it is the surest measure of his fitness to serve as a member of the cabinet. To speak the truth in the face of enormous pressure is not to take the easy way out. This is the kind of man I want to see as Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Members of the Committee, I am proud to know him, but I am prouder still to be in his ohana. I thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Senator Inouye follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Daniel K. Inouye, U.S. Senator from Hawaii, in Support of the Nomination of General Eric Shinseki Mr. Chairman, Senator Burr, Members of this distinguished Committee, I am grateful for this opportunity to stand before you with my dear friend, Senator Bob Dole to present General Shinseki President- elect Obama's nominee to serve as the Secretary of Department of Veterans Affairs. In Hawaii, we use a word almost as frequently as ``aloha,'' and that word is ``ohana.'' Ohana means ``family,'' but a Hawaiian family includes men and women not necessarily of blood kinship, but united by shared beliefs and concerns. I had the great honor of standing with Senator Oren Long to nominate General Shinseki to the United States Military Academy at West Point. Since that appointment and his acceptance, I have followed his career. In his initial tour of duty in Vietnam he did well, but suffered a grievous injury to his foot. Any other man would have justifiably resigned himself to civilian life and retired from the military. Instead, General Shinseki pleaded to remain in active duty despite the hardship and physical pain. That is one measure of the man who stands before you today: an unflinching devotion to country and duty. His plea was granted, and General Shinseki's service encompassed both further study--first at Duke University where he received his Masters, and later at the United States Army Command and General Staff College, and at the National War College. These studies, together with an astute grasp of the pragmatic, and the quality of his leadership, supported a steadily spiraling course upward through the ranks at the Army. That is another measure of General Shinseki: the stamina required for sustained excellence. I was so proud when I met with him face-to-face in Kosovo, where he served as the Commanding General. At that time, I was certain that his career would blossom further--and in June 1999, General Shinseki became the Chief of Staff of the United States Army. His tenure in that high post included the onset of the Iraq War. As we moved from the emotional frenzy of commencing hostilities, Members of Congress began to have questions--most notably whether we had adequate resources to succeed. When General Shinseki came to testify at Congressional hearings, many expected him to give the standard line the Administration favored. He did not. He told the truth, and in doing so took a position contrary to the Administration. His honest assessment that more troops would be needed cost him his job, but it is the surest measure of his fitness to serve as a cabinet member. To speak the truth in the face of enormous pressure to take the easy way out . . . this is the kind of man I want to see as Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs. This is the kind of man I am proud to know--and I am prouder still to be in his Ohana. Chairman Akaka. Thank you very much, Senator Inouye, for your statement and for presenting with Senator Dole our nominee. Senator Dole. Mr. Chairman, could I just add one word? Chairman Akaka. Senator Dole? Senator Dole. I want to agree with the Chairman. There is much good about the VA. There have been a lot of negative stories, but I think we all agree that in most cases, they do a good job. It has just gotten better in the last 10, 15, 20 years; and it is going to get better because of men like this. Chairman Akaka. Thank you. Thank you very much for your statements. Now I will continue with opening statements from the group here. Let me call on Senator Specter, who told me he has to leave, for his opening statement. STATEMENT OF HON. ARLEN SPECTER, U.S. SENATOR FROM PENNSYLVANIA Senator Specter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am pleased to be here to join in the accolades for General Shinseki. I was interested to hear the opening statements of Senator Dole and Senator Inouye. Senator Dole and I have a common heritage, coming from the same little town in Kansas--4,998 people. They used to have 5,000 until Dole and I left town. I moved there when I was 12, and he was away at college. He was a much older man at that time, but I have pretty much caught up with him. [Laughter.] To hear Senator Inouye's recitation of General Shinseki's illustrious career really tells it all, a West Point grad. I had the opportunity to meet General Shinseki about a decade ago in Bosnia. I was very much impressed with his record then and impressed to have a chance to sit down and talk to him a few days ago. He has a very, very difficult job. The United States has become a great, powerful Nation because of what our fighting men and women have done, from the Revolutionary War on. I have a special interest in veterans' affairs which led me to select this as a first committee, and I had the honor to chair it for some 6 years. My interest arose because of my father, who was a veteran of World War I. My dad was born in Russia and he was 18 in 1911 and the czar wanted to send him to Siberia. He didn't want to go to Siberia. He learned it was cold there. He wanted to go to Kansas. It was a close call, but he got to Kansas---- [Laughter.] Senator Specter [continuing]. Where I was born, and he served in World War I and he was wounded in action. He carried shrapnel in his legs from the Argonne Forest until the day he died, including the days when he drove a big truck full of junk onto the scale of Doran Dole, who ran the grain elevator in Russell, Kansas, Bob's father, the only scale big enough to weigh the truck. But the Federal Government promised the veterans a bonus, $500, a lot of money in those days--still a lot of money. The government broke the promise--which the government too often does to the veterans--and there was a march on Washington. My father couldn't participate. He couldn't walk that far. He didn't have the train fare. And on that day, they killed veterans right out here on the Mall--one of the blackest days in American history. And when I heard about that as a toddler--I think it is hard to know what motivates a person--that made up my mind to come to Washington to get my father's bonus, figuratively speaking. I haven't gotten it yet, so I am running for reelection. [Laughter.] But we have a lot of work to do to provide adequate funding. We tend to forget about the veterans after they have done their job, and I have urged General Shinseki to be a tough advocate for the Office of Management and Budget, and I am pleased to support you, General. We have the Holder hearing tomorrow, so regrettably, I am not going to be able to stay, but nothing could change my mind anyway. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Rockefeller [presiding]. Thank you, Senator Specter. There are lots of dots on that clock and I have got to go vote and I will be right back. The distinguished Senator from Montana--where is Montana? [Laughter.] Senator Tester. Just west of West Virginia. Senator Rockefeller. Just west of West Virginia. He is here to act as Chairman, and---- Senator Dole. It is cold out there, too. Senator Rockefeller [continuing]. And I just wanted to say that it was very moving to me when General Shinseki walked into my office. I was for him before he came in. I was so much for him, even more so when he left--just to know the man in the sense I sort of knew the man when he came in. But to have both of you introducing him--Senator Dole, it was an incredible privilege and a very emotional experience for me because of all that you have done in your life. Senator Inouye, well, he is my boss still, so I have to be nice to him, but it is not very hard because he has sacrificed. The only thing I really resent about him is the fact that in the movie that Ken Burns did on the war--seven minutes left, and I have time to say this--that you were so incredibly handsome, and I have always held that against you. [Laughter.] But times since then have sort of evened things out, so I feel better. [Laughter.] So I am going to go vote and Senator Tester will chair. I will be right back. Senator Tester [presiding]. Thank you, Senator Rockefeller. Senator Rockefeller. And I still want to give my statement. Senator Tester. Without objection. Senator Rockefeller. Thank you. STATEMENT OF HON. JON TESTER, U.S. SENATOR FROM MONTANA Senator Tester. I appreciate the kind comments. That typically isn't always the case, so thank you. Senator Inouye and Senator Dole, thank you for being here. I appreciate you guys being here and---- Senator Dole. Thank you. Senator Tester [continuing]. Thank you. I think it is entirely appropriate as we approach the confirmation of General Shinseki to give thanks to General Peake for the work that he has done over the last short while that he has been in that office. He has done a nice job and we need to thank him for that, because this is an important job. I want to welcome General Shinseki. From my perspective, your reputation, as all have said, is impeccable and your biography absolutely is top flight. I quite honestly am very, very happy that a man of your capability and your stature is willing to tackle this very, very important position as the head of the VA; because in Montana, we have about 100,000 veterans. That might not sound like a lot, but it means that 11 percent of our State population are veterans. It is a large group of people, a very deserving group of people that deserve good people working for them, and so you fit that mold in all the areas. So thank you for being here. I believe you will be confirmed. I intend to support you, barring something catastrophic that might come up, but that isn't going to happen. As I said when you came to my office, I appreciate your willingness to serve. I look forward to having you come out to the great State of Montana to take a peek around about the challenges that our veterans face every day. I don't think we are different than any other rural State. It is a challenge for veterans to get to health care in some cases; and to be honest, it is a challenge for them even to navigate through the benefits system in others, which we will all try to work together to get fixed. I have had many, many hearings in the State of Montana over the last couple of years and one of the things that a veteran told me early on was that he had had some problems with the VA. He said, ``It is apparent that they are trying to outlive me and they will get it done.'' We need to eliminate that kind of frustration as much as possible. These are folks that have served this country, in some cases literally put their lives on the line for this country, and I know you are committed to making things right by them and fulfilling the promises that we have made to them. I look forward to this Committee, and particularly myself, working with you to make sure that happens. I am frustrated, to say the least, about the fact that the VA and the DOD don't have a seamless electronic medical record--record sharing. I have great hopes that with your past positions you can have some influence on the DOD. Right or wrong, I put most of the focus on them in this particular situation. I think the VA has done a great job developing the system. We need to get the DOD to buy into it and then we need to work together with them--I am saying the VA when I say ``we''--to see that we can make progress on that front because I think it will help down the line in a number of different areas. We also have the issue of mental health that is the signature injury coming out of Iraq and Afghanistan. There are some campaigns beyond the Yellow Ribbon Campaign that the Montana National Guard has been developing and utilizing, as well as a number of other States. I think it is very successful--for Guardsmen. Do Reservists have the same kind of support? They have the same deployment schedules, for the most part, same kinds of issues. Do they have access to those same kinds of programs? The issue--in more rural areas--of contracting out and how we deal with that without destroying the VA, because it does provide some of the best health care in the world. But still, with distance and economy of scale, it may be good to look at that in certain instances. And then, finally, with vocational programs for veterans-- how we can work better; how the VA can work better with Labor Department programs to help veterans find meaningful employment while helping turn the economy around in this country--because they are some of the best people on earth. Senator Murray has rejoined us, and so I would just say in closing--and we will follow up on some of this stuff with the questions and answers--but in closing, I would just say I am very happy you are here. I had a very good relationship with General Peake. I told you that in my office. I anticipate we will have a better relationship. Thank you very much for being here and I look forward to your confirmation. Senator Murray? STATEMENT OF HON. PATTY MURRAY, U.S. SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON Senator Murray. Thank you very much, Senator Tester. General Shinseki, welcome to this Committee and thank you for being willing to take on this incredibly important task. You have been nominated to what I believe is one of the most challenging and rewarding positions in our government and I applaud your willingness to take on this critical position. I look forward to working closely with you once you are confirmed. I have always said that we need a VA Secretary who will be honest about what our veterans need and have the backbone to stand up and ask for it. Too many of the problems that we have seen at the VA have been brought to light by GAO reports, news organizations, investigations, or whistleblowers. We had a GAO report following the VA's $3 billion budget shortfall back in 2005 that showed that the VA had actually misled Congress, concealed funding problems, and based its projections on inaccurate models. A television network uncovered disturbing veterans' suicide numbers, while an internal e-mail from the VA's own head of mental health expressed a desire to cover up the data. McCarthy News found that the VA had repeatedly exaggerated the past successes of its medical system, and the list just goes on. General Shinseki, I worked in the Seattle VA during college and I have seen the incredible dedication and work of staff and doctors and nurses on the ground, and these everyday heroes are working very, very hard to make sure that America's veterans are receiving the kind of care that they deserve. But both veterans and VA staff have been done a disservice by a top-down bureaucracy that has failed to be honest with Congress and has been very resistant to change. Under Secretary Peake's leadership, progress has been made, and I am very glad for that. I believe he is leaving the VA a better agency than he found it. But there is a lot of work ahead of us. Veterans are still waiting too long for benefits. Female veterans are returning to a system that is not prepared to care for their unique needs. Facilities are in desperate need of renovations. And 20 percent of our veterans are returning home with serious mental health needs to a VA that still doesn't have the mechanisms in place to take care of them. I know you have been out talking to veterans and VSOs and hearing about those challenges and listening to veterans themselves. That is a key part of this job. America's veterans deserve a truthful advocate who will break through the red tape and make veterans, not the bottom line, the priority of VA management. Having sat next to President-elect Obama when he sat on this Committee--right next to me--I know his dedication to those who served our Nation and to their families and I very much appreciate his pledge to reverse the current administration's flawed decision to close the doors of the VA to Priority 8 veterans. As you know, I sponsored legislation to reopen access for all those who have served and I applaud your commitment to achieve that goal responsibly, as well. As you wrote in response to one of this Committee's pre- hearing questions, ``The overarching challenge that the VA faces is its transformation into a 21st century organization as called for by the President-elect.'' That is no small task. But given your history of tackling complex problems and your record of speaking truth to power, I think you are up for this challenge. Change is not going to happen overnight. We know that we are going to continue to face challenges at the VA no matter who is in charge. But with transparency, with honesty, with energy, the next VA Secretary can begin to tackle these challenges and make a difference for our veterans. I want you to know I stand ready to work with you to make that happen with as much energy, honesty, and transparency as I can, as well. And I hope that you view Congress as a partner, not an adversary, in your work to ensure that our veterans get the care and compassion that they have earned. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Akaka [presiding]. Thank you very much, Senator. Now, we will hear from Senator Wicker. STATEMENT OF HON. ROGER F. WICKER, U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSISSIPPI Senator Wicker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, General Shinseki, for your service, for your willingness to serve again on behalf of the United States of America. I learned this morning when we were shaking hands and visiting before the hearing convened that you have a distinguished record on the faculty at the United States Military Academy. I noticed that Representative John Shimkus of Illinois was here to shake hands and enthusiastically greet you and wish you well. He was an English student of yours at the Academy, and I wanted that to be reflected on the record, that Representative Shimkus came over to offer his support from the other body. General, you have been before the Senate for confirmation on five occasions already. You surely must realize that during this process, you will eventually be allowed to speak for yourself---- [Laughter.] Senator Wicker [continuing]. But we are going to make sure that we talk, too. And so, by way of opening remarks, I want to thank you for coming by earlier and speaking to most of us in our offices. I read with interest your prepared testimony and I noticed that you outlined three general principles that you would be striving to achieve during your tour of duty in the Department of Veterans Affairs. One would be that veterans would be the centerpiece, and you mentioned in that regard that the workforce in the VA would be standard-setters in their field. I very much applaud that. Certainly, it is reasonable to expect that the specifics and your specific program will come later, but I applaud that as a goal. Second, you mentioned the timeliness and excellence of service by your Department. The third general principle is to look for ways to do things smarter and more effectively and to use the world's best practices. I think that is a very healthy beginning to setting principles, Mr. Chairman, and I applaud our nominee for those today. I would just like to say during my opening statement that I hope we can employ those principles when it comes to two specific things that I mentioned to you earlier in our private conversation. One would be with regard to veterans' nursing homes--not only those that are run by the VA alone, but also in partnership with the various States. We have close to 300 in both categories and there is a proposal to build two more VA nursing homes during 2009. There is a new concept in the area of nursing homes and it is called the greenhouse approach. We haven't used this yet in the government. Basically, it strives to put groups of eight or ten patients, if you will, in a nursing home together in a pod or in a separate building and ask them to participate in the decisionmaking as to what sort of activities and what sort of food and what sort of other decisions that they are capable of making, even though they are housed in a nursing home. I am a veteran myself. My father is a World War II veteran. My son will soon enter the United States Air Force. I would like to think that if it ever came to the point where I had to go into a nursing home, I could go into the best, the most modern type of nursing home; one that exercises, as you said, doing things in the smartest way, that exercises the best practices. So I mentioned to you privately and I will mention to you publicly on the record that I hope in that regard that we can work together with this Committee and with the Congress to make sure that when it comes time for our veterans to move into a nursing home, if that should be required, that they can move into the very best possible kind of nursing home care. I would also hope that we could apply those three principles in the area of electronic medical records. I believe it was the Chairman who earlier mentioned the desire of this Committee to have a seamless transfer from DOD to the Department of Veterans Affairs. Certainly coming from DOD yourself and now moving into this new area of responsibility, you are uniquely positioned to work in that regard. But I know that if it were an easy task--to have this seamless process of medical records moving from DOD to VA when the time comes for our members to transition--if that were easy, we would have done it already. It is difficult and we have asked the Departments to do this. I hope that the three principles that you outlined: of using the best practices in the world; excellence in service; and being a standard setter, that--with regard to the electronic medical records and also veterans' nursing home care--that we can be a standard setter. And I look forward to being your teammate in this regard. I thank you and congratulate you on your nomination and your certain confirmation. Thank you, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Akaka. Thank you very much, Senator Wicker. Senator Webb, your opening statement. STATEMENT OF HON. JIM WEBB, U.S. SENATOR FROM VIRGINIA Senator Webb. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and General, welcome. I have to say, first of all, it was really moving to see you sitting there flanked by Senator Inouye and former Senator Bob Dole. First of all, I was thinking about the kind of services these individuals have given our country; and the other was, you and I are both Vietnam guys and there aren't many opportunities left in our lives to be around people who are going to look at us and call us ``young fella.'' And also, Mr. Chairman, if I may, there is an individual out here who I would like to personally recognize. John Fales, who is over at the press table, was wounded as a Marine in Vietnam, lost his sight as a result of his wounds. I have been knowing John and working with him for more than 30 years, since I was a counsel on the Veterans Committee. General, if you don't know him yet, you are going to. He is rather famous as Sergeant Shaft in the Washington Times. So John, if you could take a quick bow, I would appreciate it. Semper Fidelis and thank you for all that you have been doing for veterans over the years. [Applause.] I think your selection, General Shinseki, is an inspired act of leadership by the incoming President. I look forward to your tenure. When I look at the VA now, having been involved with it in a lot of different capacities--as a recipient, as a committee counsel, and now here in the Senate, and having spent 5 years in the Pentagon--I really believe the greatest challenge for the VA is simple leadership. Just getting the right people in the positions, understanding how to break the logjams that have created so many problems, and getting the benefits that have been voted out by the Congress into the hands of the veterans who deserve them. And I think that your background, particularly as having been Chief of Staff of the Army, is particularly suited to trying to solve those problems. I have a special interest, as you know, in the G.I. Bill and how we are going to put that program online in a timely way and in a way that is going to have as few administrative difficulties as possible. But I would like to make one other point here at the outset of your testimony. You are the fourth consecutive Academy graduate, by my count, to be serving in this position, as you will. On the one hand, that has an up-side, obviously, with the type of leadership preparation and the service that goes along with that. I say this as someone who also went to a service academy. But also, it is a challenge that I have watched in some of your predecessors in the sense that I would hope you will keep your eye on the notion that veterans' programs really do have a different character than military programs and sometimes this seems to get lost in how they are administered. I hope you will pay special attention to the way that we are now going through these disability evaluations. In my mind and in my experience, there is a marked difference between assigning a disability for someone saying that they are not fit for active duty and therefore should leave the military as opposed to how that disability is measured throughout someone's life as a veteran. And sometimes, that gets lost even in the discussions that we have been having over the past couple of years with the Dole-Shalala Commission and these other things. So the bottom line, really, on this, my personal request to you as a leader is I hope you will do everything you can to reach out to the veterans' groups. There are people who have spent their entire lifetimes, adult lifetimes, working on these issues and understanding the different characteristics of them; and also the many, many talented people inside the VA who have done the same thing--devoted their professional lives to this distinct environment of the aftermath of military service--and to really be sensitive to the different personality between the Department of Defense and veterans' benefits. With that, I wish you well. As I said, I think this is an inspired choice and my door is always open. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Akaka. Thank you, Senator Webb. We will continue with opening statements from Members. Next will be Senator Rockefeller, followed by Senator Sanders and Senator Isakson. Senator Rockefeller? STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER IV, U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA Senator Rockefeller. I sort of gave one, Mr. Chairman, so I am cheating a little bit, but there is no way for me to express how proud I am that you are the President's nominee. In one sense, it shouldn't have surprised me. I am not trying to be partisan about this. I am overwhelmed by the people that have been nominated for cabinet positions and confirmable positions that come to my office and their quality is just beyond belief; one after another--scientists, veterans, administrators to be-- all of them. Everybody is going to make mistakes and what I've always liked about you (before I even met you), was that I had a feeling that you wouldn't know how not to tell the truth, regardless of the consequences. I got that from television and newspapers and I got it full bore yesterday. Like Senator Webb was just saying, I think the Veterans Administration--although I think it is the best hospital system in the United States of America, which most people don't give it credit for--it has so many problems still. Two hundred twenty thousand people that you have to lead, and then this whole question of how do you make veterans--Bob Dole was speaking to that--how do you make veterans feel like their future is good in terms of their rehabilitation, whether it is physical, psychological, or inside the body in some other way. I think it is almost simplistic that sometimes just the right person at the top becomes a symbol. It just inspires people on down the line to do twice the job they were doing. I told you yesterday when we were talking about a person that Patty Murray will remember very well named Dr. Ken Kizer-- we have these frequent meetings, panels that go on forever, members come and go--and he wasn't any different from any other Director of Health, it seemed to me as I listened to him, that had come before us before. And then suddenly, 4 years after he had left, we found that the entire VA system had been computerized, everything was databased, unlike DOD. There were a lot of problems in syncing with DOD, and he had done it. He hadn't said anything about it. We hadn't had the oversight to know it, which is our fault. There is so much oversight that we have to do in this Committee, which I think needs to be constructive and will cause our members to want to come to hearings and to listen to testimony and to learn more. But I am just--I think you have to start with the guy at the top or the woman at the top and I just can't imagine a better choice than you. I just absolutely cannot imagine a better choice; not just the experience and the wounding and the fighting and the commanding and the decisionmaking under, quote, fire, your tough stance, standing up for the truth, but your nature. You inspire confidence in people and you do in me. I am still going to ask you some tough questions, but I think you probably have some sense that I am probably going to vote for you---- [Laughter.] Senator Rockefeller [continuing]. But I just want you to understand that it is going to be--it will be one of the best votes I have made in the 24 years that I have been on this Committee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Akaka. Thank you, Senator Rockefeller. Senator Sanders? STATEMENT OF HON. BERNARD SANDERS, U.S. SENATOR FROM VERMONT Senator Sanders. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and welcome, General Shinseki. I know you are going to be a great leader and the VA certainly needs the kind of leadership that you are going to be providing. You know, it is a funny thing in this body. We have differences and the American people have differences about the wisdom, for example, of the war in Iraq. But what I have been very happy to see is that there has been a coming together, despite the opinions that one might have about the wisdom of Iraq, with the understanding that we do not blame the men and women who are fighting that war for the decisions that were made here in Washington. That we have a solemn obligation to make sure that every man and woman who has fought in that war, when they come home, they get all of the care and the benefits they have been promised. I think we have made real progress in differentiating our differences with regard to the war with our understanding that we take care of our veterans and we do for them what we promised we would do. General, I am happy to say that under Chairman Akaka's leadership and Bob Filner in the House, we have made some progress in the last couple of years. The good news is we have begun to make some progress. The bad news is that we have a long way to go, in my view. We have passed, and Senator Webb helped us move forward on this, the most comprehensive and significant step forward in terms of G.I. education, a real step forward for millions of men and women. We have made progress on VA funding. We have made progress on Priority 8 veterans, of mileage reimbursement, of VA counseling for family members. That is the good news. The bad news is that much remains to be done. Some of the issues, General, that I hope we can pay attention to in the coming years are advanced appropriations. You can't run a system as large as the VA if you do not know what your budget is going to be, and it really is a disservice to all of our veterans if the VA does not have that knowledge. I come from a State where we have suffered very heavily from the war in Iraq through our National Guard, and I hope very much that we make sure that the VA properly cares for our citizen soldiers that have given so much. Let us not forget about the Guard and the Reserve. Clearly, many of the men and women who are coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan are suffering from PTSD and TBI and this is a little bit outside of the culture of the VA in placing a priority on those needs. I think we can all agree the VA has done a tremendous job and it is leading the world in taking care of people who have lost arms, lost legs, hearing, eye problems, and so forth. But somehow when the issue becomes emotional or mental health problems, that has been a little bit outside of the traditional culture. But those wounds are as real as any other wounds many of our soldiers have suffered and we need the research and the treatment to take care of those people. One of the areas that I have focused on and it is of great concern in the State of Vermont is the issue of Priority 8s. Now, I think we all agree that the most pressing needs are those people who are coming home wounded today. We have to take care of our older veterans. That goes without saying. But especially in this economic crisis, there are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of veterans who may make $35,000 a year who are pushed out of the VA. I think you can't bring them all back in overnight, but I think the goal must be that any person who wore the uniform of this country, regardless of income, should be able to come back into the VA. So, I look forward to working with you to do that. I am sure my colleagues have discussed with you the claims system. We are somewhere back in the 19th century, I think, in that regard. It is just incredible that in this age of computer technology that people submit claims, they don't hear for months and months, and it goes on and on. That is just grossly unfair, so we want to update and improve our claims system so that when people put in a claim, they get a timely response. One of the real successes of the VA in recent years has been the growth of the CBOCs--the community based outpatient clinics--which in Vermont work very, very well; and the Vet Centers, as well. Vet Centers, as you know, are places where there is no bureaucracy; where the veterans run those centers, people feel really comfortable walking in. I think that is a great investment and I hope we can expand that whole area. Last, for many, many years, ever since I first came into the Congress in the House, I have been working on Gulf War Illness. While we are all dealing with the problems of Iraq and Afghanistan and our older veterans, let us not forget those people who are still suffering from Gulf War Illness. So General, I am going to strongly support your nomination. We have a system which is, I believe, the largest provider in America. So, what we do impacts the whole health care system in our country. It is profoundly important and we have a moral obligation to our veterans to make sure we provide them the best care that we possibly can. So, I very much look forward to working with you and thank you for your years of service to our country. Chairman Akaka. Thank you very much, Senator Sanders. Senator Isakson? STATEMENT OF HON. JOHNNY ISAKSON, U.S. SENATOR FROM GEORGIA Senator Isakson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. General Shinseki, I first of all want to thank you and commend you on your service to the country and thank you very much for being willing to assume the responsibilities of the VA. You are eminently qualified. I have studied your resume and we are somewhat contemporaries from my period of service and yours. I think we are probably about the same age, and I really appreciate your taking it on. You have got a life of experiences that will help the VA quite a bit. The VA has been making some great progress in some of the areas that were mentioned by Senator Sanders and I want to comment on two, which I sent some earlier prepared questions to you about. One is the Augusta Uptown VA and Fort Gordon's Eisenhower Hospital. General Schoomaker established a seamless transition there for those soldiers coming home, leaving DOD, and going into VA care which has been described as a great success by many, including Secretary Peake. In a number of places in the country, a lot of our veterans who have come home and are released from DOD kind of fall through the cracks between DOD and VA. It is very important that we see to it that that is a seamless transition. What the Department of Defense has done with the Warrior Transition Centers has been a tremendous step forward in dealing with the types of difficulties, in terms of PTSD and TBI, for those who are coming back from Iraq or Afghanistan. Equally, we need the transition from DOD to VA to be as seamless and easy as possible for our veterans. So, I have been able to get Secretary Peake down to Augusta to see it firsthand. I know you are going to have a world on your plate for the time being, but I hope sometime during the next year you can pay a visit to that facility because we can replicate it around the country. It will make service to our veterans, I think, much, much better than it already is. And then second, I want to echo what Senator Sanders said about the community based clinics. Those are extremely important. Our State has one of the largest veterans populations of any State in the country and some of them have to go long distances to get to the VA hospital in Atlanta or Augusta; and Georgia is the largest State east of the Mississippi River geographically. So those clinics, some of which we have been able to open in the last 2 years, have made it a lot easier for our veterans to get the health care they deserve in a much more convenient and accessible way and I look forward to working with you in any way I can to support you in your efforts to support our veterans who have served our country so well and I thank you for the time today. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Akaka. Thank you very much, Senator Isakson. Now, for an opening statement, Senator Hutchison. STATEMENT OF HON. KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON, U.S. SENATOR FROM TEXAS Senator Hutchison. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and welcome, General Shinseki. I want to tell you that I admire and respect you as much as anyone I have ever known in the Armed Services; and I am going to support your nomination. You have been a Purple Heart recipient, so you will know what veterans go through; and you were a great Army Chief of Staff. I also want to say that your predecessor is one of the finest Veterans Secretaries we have ever had, and I know you worked with him because he was your Surgeon General. I know that the transition will be a very good one. His emphasis on health care has been so positive. He has understood the problems. He has been an action taker, and I just know that you will stay on that same track. We are opening our fifth trauma center--Class 1 trauma center--that has already been authorized and I look forward to bringing that to fruition. As you know, I am the Ranking Member of the Veterans Affairs and Military Construction Subcommittee on Appropriations, as well as serving on this Committee. There are a few areas that I know you will address, but I just want to point out from my experience what I think are priorities. First, the claims processing wait is about half-a-year and that is just unacceptable. We started working on it, and with the great help from some of our Members here--especially Senator Murray and Senator Akaka--we have tried to add the supplemental appropriations to add claims processors. But that is something that will need your urgent attention to assure that people don't have a hiatus when they go from active duty to the veteran status in those adjustments. Second, electronic medical records. I know that has been mentioned. That is an area where the VA has performed exemplary. I think it is known that after Hurricane Katrina, not one veteran's record was lost. That is what we need to put in place that will match the Department of Defense. But frankly, it is the Department of Defense that needs to match the VA so that that seamless transition of medical records occurs, and I hope that--it was started under Secretary Peake-- I hope that you will continue and bring that home. I was so pleased that you support the research that we know is necessary for the kind of war that we have and the kinds of injuries that we have that are somewhat different from past wars, and particularly Gulf War research, which my colleague, Senator Sanders, also has mentioned. He has been a champion of that, as have I. I talked to the researcher at UT-Southwestern who is doing that work over the Christmas holidays and he said that now that they have the bigger base to test their initial results, they are finding that there are effects from chemicals. It is showing in the brain scans of people who have had these Gulf War Syndrome symptoms. So we are going to be able to now take the next step to see how we can add the antidote to the lack of an enzyme in a person's brain that makes them susceptible to those chemicals. I am very excited about it and want to make sure that we go forward with this research that is just on the cusp now of showing the results that can be verified so we can protect our warriors who are going to be potentially subject to those. I thank you for taking this job and I look forward to working with you. Chairman Akaka. Thank you very much, Senator Hutchison. Under the rules of the Committee, the testimony of all Presidential nominees appearing before the Committee shall be taken under oath. General Shinseki, would you now stand for the administration of the oath. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you, God? General Shinseki. I do. Chairman Akaka. Thank you. General Shinseki, will you please begin with your statement. STATEMENT OF GENERAL ERIC K. SHINSEKI, U.S. ARMY (RETIRED), PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE TO BE SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS General Shinseki. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Akaka, Senator Burr, and distinguished members of this Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I am deeply honored by President-elect Obama's nomination for me to serve as the Secretary of this Department, this Department of Veterans Affairs. I want you to know that I am fully committed to doing the best I can in this job and of fulfilling the vision--the charge--that he passed to me, and that is to transform Veterans Affairs into a 21st century organization. Over the last several weeks, I have had the opportunity to meet with many of you individually and I want to express my deep appreciation for sharing your concerns with me, and what came very clearly through those conversations were your concerns for and your unwavering support both of our veterans and the good people who go to work every day in the Department of Veterans Affairs. I listened carefully to your concerns and your advice and I benefited from your counsel and I look forward to delivering on the promises that we arrived at. Mr. Chairman, let me just take a moment and thank you for the courtesy of--although it has been a little while now-- introducing my family: my wife, Patty; and my son-in-law, Tim Heaphy, who are here this morning. The Shinsekis are usually 13 in strength when we gather as a family and today we are a little unrepresented. That is because my daughter, Lori, is taking care of her three children in Charlottesville. My son and his wife, Barbara, and their four daughters are in New Jersey. But the rest of the family is here and we are very proud of all of them. I just want you to know, 43 years ago, my wife, Patty, married a soldier, and that is about all she understood she was doing. Not having come from a military background, we weren't quite sure where things were going to lead, but here 43 years later, we are still sitting side-by-side and looking to serve our country. She has changed our family addresses 31 times in my 38 years in the military, something on that order, so she has an appreciation for what spouses and families of our military personnel go through. She is as caring and as devoted to soldiers today as she was when I married her. She has stood at my bedside and helped me to learn to walk again and gave me back the confidence to put my professional life back on track when I faced a service-disqualifying injury. And so I just wanted to take a moment to register for all of us, as the Members of this Committee know so well, that none of us has the privilege of doing what we do without the love and support of families who sacrifice far more than most understand; who sacrifice so that we have our opportunities to serve. It was that way for my 38 years as a soldier and it will be that way again, if I am confirmed--to serve both our veterans and the good people at the Veterans Affairs Department as their Secretary. Again, I am playing a little catch-up here, but I would like to also express my great honor of having had the rare privilege of being introduced to the Committee by two of our Nation's premier public servants, Senator Inouye from my home State of Hawaii, and former Senator Dole from Kansas, both veterans, and both distinguished themselves in battle during World War II. Both, as they related, suffered through long and painful recoveries under the nurturing care of the VA, and then returned to public service to help lead our Nation in its rise as a global leader in the last half of the 20th century. I am humbled by their presence here this morning, I want you to know that, that they took the time to introduce me and to publicly display their trust and confidence in this nomination. I would also like to acknowledge the presence of representatives of many of our Veterans Service Organizations here today. They are essential partners to assure the best possible service and support for those who, in President Lincoln's words, shall have borne the battle, and for his widow and for his orphan. And so, to all veterans present this morning--those in this room sitting either there on the dais with you or those here in the audience, and those who may be watching these proceedings from distant and remote locations in the country--I want to express my thanks for their service, their sacrifice for our country. I would be honored to be their Secretary and their advocate at the Veterans Affairs Department, if confirmed. Mr. Chairman, distinguished Members of the Committee, transformation is always challenging for any organization and I use the particular term here ``transformation'' rather than incremental change, transformation, and looking at all of our fundamental and comprehensive processes that make up any organization of the size and complexity of the Department of Veterans Affairs. So, transformation is always challenging for any organization, particularly ones with complex missions which are steeped in tradition, as is this particular Department. I would suggest that we faced similar challenges about 10 years ago as we began the transformation of the United States Army; a process that continues today. We found that positive leadership, dedication, and teamwork on the part of all in the organization allowed what was considered to be challenges when we began to be redefined for all of us as opportunities for innovation and increased productivity, and it is up to leadership to help with that redefinition. With your support, I am confident we will succeed. If confirmed, I intend to articulate a concise strategy for pursuing a transformed Department of Veterans Affairs reflecting the vision of President-elect Obama. I have much to learn about the Department and I look forward to gaining the valuable input and insights from its dedicated employees as well as from the veterans they serve and the organizations who serve those veterans. As Senator Wicker mentioned earlier, there are three fundamental attributes for me that mark the start point of framing a 21st century organization for Veterans Affairs. It will be people-centric. It must be results-driven. And by necessity, it must be forward-looking. First, about people, veterans will be the centerpiece of our organization, our clients, as we design and implement and sustain programs which serve them. Through their service in uniform, veterans have sacrificed greatly, investing of themselves in the security, the safety, and the well-being of our Nation. They are clients, and I use that term particularly, not just customers of our service. They are clients whom we represent and whose best interests are our sole reason for existence. It is our charge to address their changing needs over time and across a full range of support that our government has committed to providing them. Equally essential, the Department's workforce will be leaders and standard-setters in their fields. There is a long tradition of the VA having exercised that leadership role, and my interest is ensuring that we continue where we lead and regain the leadership where we do not today. From delivering cutting-edge medical treatment to answering the most basic inquiries, we will grow and retain a skilled, motivated, and client-oriented workforce. Training and development, communications and team building, continuous learning will be components of that culture. Second, results. At the end of each day, our true measure of success is the timeliness, the quality, and the consistency of services and support we provide to veterans. We will set and meet objectives in each of those performance areas--timeliness, quality, consistency. We will all know the standards and perform to them. Our processes will remain accessible, responsive, and transparent to ensure that the differing needs of a diverse veteran population are addressed. Success also includes cost effectiveness. As stewards of taxpayer dollars, we will ensure that appropriate metrics are included in our quality assurance and our management processes. Finally, third, forward-looking. To optimize our opportunities for delivering best services with available resources, we must continually challenge ourselves to look for ways to do things smarter and more effectively. We will aggressively leverage the world's best practices, its knowledge base, its emerging technologies to increase our capabilities in areas such as health care, information management, and service delivery. If confirmed, I will focus on the development of a credible and adequate 2010 budget request as soon as I arrive in the office, and that will be an immediate priority in the first 90 days. The overriding priority will be to make the Department of Veterans Affairs a 21st century organization, singularly focused on the Nation's veterans as its clients. I thank this Committee for its long history of unwavering commitment to those veterans, and if confirmed, I look forward to working closely with you in that commitment. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I look forward to your questions. [The prepared statement of General Shinseki follows:] Prepared Statement of Eric K. Shinseki, Secretary-designate of Veterans Affairs Chairman Akaka, Senator Burr, Distinguished Members of the Committee on Veterans Affairs: Thank you for scheduling this hearing so expeditiously. I am honored to be before you today seeking your endorsement to become the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Over the last several weeks, I have had the opportunity to meet with many of you individually and deeply appreciate the Committee's concern for and unwavering support for our Veterans and for the mission of the Department of Veterans Affairs. I've listened carefully to your concerns and advice, and have benefited from your counsel. I deeply appreciate the confidence of President-elect Obama in this nomination and am fully committed to fulfilling his charge to me--that is, transform the Department of Veterans Affairs into a 21st Century Organization. I am acutely aware that transformation is a challenging task--particularly in an organization as complex and as steeped in tradition as is the Department of Veterans Affairs. We faced similar challenges nearly 10 years ago in beginning the transformation of the United States Army. Leadership, commitment and teamwork enable the challenges of transformation to become opportunities to innovate and better serve our Veterans. With your support, I am confident we will succeed. If confirmed, I will quickly finalize and articulate a concise strategy for pursuing a transformed Department of Veterans Affairs, reflecting the vision of President-elect Obama. I have much to learn about the organization and look forward to gaining valuable input and insights from its civilian workforce as well as from the Veterans Service Organizations. However, three fundamental attributes mark the starting point for framing a 21st Century Organization: people-centric, results-driven, forward-looking. First, Veterans will be the centerpiece of our organization--our client, as we design, implement, and sustain programs. Our support to veterans and their enrolled family members must go beyond that of servicing customers to a relationship based on trust and positive results over a lifetime. Through their service in uniform, Veterans have sacrificed greatly, investing of themselves in the security, safety, and well-being of our Nation. They are clients, whom we represent and whose best interests are our sole reason for existence. It is our charge to address their changing needs over time and across the full range of support that our Government has committed to provide to them. Equally essential, the Department's workforce will be leaders and standard-setters in their fields. From delivering cutting-edge medical treatment to answering the most basic inquiries, we will grow and retain a skilled, motivated, and client-oriented workforce. Training and development, communications and teambuilding, and continuous learning will be key components of our workforce culture. Second, at the end of each day, our true measure of success is the timeliness and excellence of services and support provided to Veterans. Thus, we will continuously strive to set and meet sound performance benchmarks in these areas. Workforce leaders and providers alike will know the standards and perform to them. Our processes will remain accessible, responsive, and transparent to ensure that the many needs of a diverse Veterans population are met. An integral part of measuring success includes assessing cost- effectiveness. As stewards of taxpayer funds, this issue will be central to our quality and management processes. Third, to optimize our opportunities for delivering best services with available resources, we must continually challenge ourselves to look for ways to do things smarter and more effectively. We will aggressively leverage the world's best practices, knowledge, and technology, which are providing ever-increasing capabilities in health care, information management, service delivery, and other areas. We already know that a portion of today's youth will be tomorrow's servicemen and women, and the next day's Veterans. Thus, we will seek to identify and embed transformational initiatives as part of our culture as we care for Veterans, present and future. While developing a strategy for transforming the VA into a 21st Century Organization, we will address immediately a set of complex, near-term challenges that face us, as well: 1. Successfully implement the New GI Bill (Post-9/11 Veterans' Educational Assistance Act). 2. Streamline the disability claims system, increase quality, timeliness and consistency of claims processing, and update the Disability Rating Schedule, while maintaining veterans' rights. 3. Ensure adequate resources and access points to meet the health care needs of all enrolled Veterans, as well as those OEF/OIF Veterans and Priority Group 8 Veterans, who will be joining the system. 4. Leverage the power of Information Technology to accelerate and modernize the delivery of benefits and services. If confirmed, I will focus on these issues and the development of a credible and adequate 2010 budget request during my first 90 days in office. The overriding challenge, which I will begin to address on my first day in office, will be to make the Department of Veterans Affairs a 21st Century Organization focused on the Nation's Veterans as its clients. I thank this Committee for its long history of unwavering commitment to Veterans. If confirmed, I look forward to working closely with you in fulfilling that commitment. ______ Response to Pre-Hearing Questions Submitted by Hon. Daniel K. Akaka to General Eric Shinseki, Nominee to be Secretary, Department of Veterans Affairs Question 1. What do you see as the biggest challenges facing VA at this time? What will be your emphasis in the first 90 days? Response. The overarching challenge that the VA faces is its transformation into a 21st Century organization as called for by the President-elect. I am acutely aware that transformation is a challenging task particularly in a complex organization, steeped in tradition; we faced similar challenges in the transformation of the United States Army. I believe that the biggest challenges the VA faces are: 1. Successfully implementing the New GI Bill (Post-9/11 Veterans' Educational Assistance Act). 2. Streamlining the disability claims system, increasing quality, timeliness and consistency of claims processing and updating the Disability Rating Schedule while maintaining veterans' rights. 3. Ensuring adequate resources and access points to meet the health care needs of all enrolled Veterans as well as those OEF/OIF Veterans and Priority Group 8 Veterans, who will be joining the system. 4. Utilizing cost effective Information Technology to improve and modernize the delivery of benefits and services. If confirmed, I would focus on these issues and the development of a credible and adequate 2010 budget request during my first 90 days in office. However, the overriding challenge which I will start addressing the first day in office is to make the Department a VA for the 21st Century, a VA in which Veterans truly are the centerpiece of the organization Question 2. Former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld said, in describing you and General Jack Keane, ``they say what they believe, and they tell the truth.'' Is it safe to expect that you will bring the same honest and outspoken forthrightness, about both the good and bad, to your role as Secretary? Response. Yes. If confirmed, I'll always provide my best, professional judgment on the requirements of the Department to the President, the Congress, the public, and the Veterans the Department is charged to serve. Question 3. What is your view on the role of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs? If confirmed, would you seek to be an independent advocate for veterans or would you be the executor of the Administration's policies relating to veterans? Response. I do not believe these roles as described in the question will be in conflict. If confirmed, I intend to be a forceful advocate for Veterans. The President-elect charged me to ensure that Veterans receive the benefits and services they earned and that the Nation expects. Question 4. One of the Secretary's major roles on an annual basis is developing and then defending VA's budget for a given year. Do you anticipate working within the limits established by the Office of Management and Budget or going to the President to advocate for the level of funding that is needed to fully fund the Department in the coming year? Response. I will be an aggressive advocate for the fiscal needs of the Department. I anticipate that the OMB will offer advice and assistance in fulfilling the vision and direction of the President- elect with respect to the needs of and promises to the Nation's Veterans. It is my expectation that OMB will be prepared to assist me in presenting to the President a proposed budget in any given year that is consistent with those needs and promises. I will not hesitate to inform the President of any serious concerns that I have. Question 5. What lessons did you learn as Chief of Staff of the Army that you plan to apply to leading VA? Do you anticipate that you will have to change your leadership style to manage a civilian department? Response. The Army taught me the value of leadership and strategic thinking. It trains its leaders to focus on goals and measurable results, while performing under pressure. I understand that there may be inherent differences between military and civilian organizations. The President-elect has made very clear the need to modernize the VA and to make it an organization that is more effective in meeting the needs of all Veterans. I share that view and, if I am confirmed, the strategic direction I set for the Department will focus on that goal. In order to transform the VA, I will draw on my experience, and I will seek the experiences of the professionals in the VA, as well, to collaborate on approaches for addressing our most challenging issues quickly. Both the VA, as an institution, and I, as its Secretary, will go through a period of teambuilding and adaptation. At the end of that period, I expect we will be a cohesive organization serving the needs of Veterans with an elevated sense of urgency. Question 6. Are you more of a ``hands-on'' manager or do you tend to rely on significant delegation? Do you seek to achieve consensus with those on your management team before making a decision or do you generally gather relevant information and input, and then make a decision? Response. Depending on circumstances, either style might be appropriate. I understand that organizations as large as the VA require the delegation of certain authorities. I expect the management team to exercise initiative, demonstrate competence in doing so, innovate as appropriate, and ensure that matters of policy are brought to my attention. Again, the President-elect has made very clear the need to modernize the VA and to make it an organization that is more effective in meeting the needs of all Veterans. In order for any organization to achieve the kind of rapid change that approaches being transformational, competence, collaboration, and innovation are important. More important, however, is trust--trust that is built on the integrity and accountability of every member of the team. Trust is foundational to achieving the kind of excellence in every as"
