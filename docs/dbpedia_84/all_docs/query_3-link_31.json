        "text": "When Eric. K. Shinseki was a cadet at West Point, he was forced to repeat his first academic year because an athletic injury landed him in the hospital and caused him to miss too many classes. Asked if he considered coming home to Hawaii instead â where he could have earned an ROTC commission at the University of Hawaii â Shinseki replied: âNo, I went back to West Point because I was going to finish what I had started.â\n\nFour decades later, Gen. Eric Shinseki found himself under pressure from then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld to resign as Army chief of staff well before the end of his four-year term. The two had quarreled over Shinsekiâs program for reforming the Army, and the general was in disrepute among the hawks in the Bush administration for frankly telling Congress that Iraq would require many more troops than anyone wanted to admit. Asked later why he refused to go, Shinseki said: âI intended to finish what I had started.â\n\nIn between, Shinseki was wounded twice in Vietnam, losing half of a foot when a landmine exploded under him. Instead of taking the veteranâs pension to which he was entitled for life, Shinseki petitioned the Army to remain in the service. He promised to learn to walk and to run again so that he could pass the physical exam. The Army said OK.\n\nToday Shinseki is again being asked to quit before heâs finished. Six years into his tenure as secretary for veterans affairs, he is the target of unrelenting criticism over an inspector generalâs interim report documenting âsystemicâ problems in the VA, including an average of 115 daysâ wait for treatment. A growing number of Democrats facing tough election challenges have joined Republican critics in calling for Shinseki to resign.\n\nAnd yet, Shinsekiâs personal history suggests that if he does leave any time soon, it will violate every tenet of his career. Nor has Shinseki given much indication that resigning is on his mind, writing in an op-ed in USA Today on Thursday that he is already moving to âset things straight.â Shinseki suggested he wants to oversee the needed fixes at least for a while, saying that he expects to announce the initial results of a nationwide audit he ordered earlier this month. âI remain committed to providing the high-quality care and benefits that veterans have earned and deserve,â he wrote. âAnd we will.â\n\nShinseki and his supporters know that, whatever his personal responsibility for the VAâs problems, many of those issues also predate his time there. Heâs been saddled with an underfunded agency and what some critics say is a dysfunctional bureaucracy, one that is being forced to deal not only with the human toll of two wars in the last decade but with the aging of the Vietnam and Korean War generation of warriors as well. Congress wants to dramatically reduce waiting times â but will it provide the money to make that happen?\n\nIn any case, soldiers and civilians who know Shinseki well have asserted that he is just not the type of person who will resign under fire, and he knows that he need only keep the confidence of President Barack Obama to remain on duty.\n\nLong known for being a man of quiet determination whose taciturn nature may not be well-suited for the media age, Shinseki was born and brought up on the island of Kauai, the most remote island in Hawaii, the nationâs most remote state. His grandparents on both sides of his family immigrated in the late 1800s from Hiroshima, then among the poorest prefectures in Japan. Several of his family served in the U.S. Armed Forces during World War II. Asked what of his Japanese heritage did he think had influenced his personality and style of leadership, General Shinseki, whose name in Japanese means âNew Fort,â hesitated for a moment, then said: âI think maybe humility, which I learned from the soldiers of the 100th Battalion and the 442nd RCT.â\n\nThe 100th Infantry Battalion was the first Japanese-American unit formed in WWII and was followed by the 442nd Regimental Combat Team some months later. Those soldiers distinguished themselves against the Nazis in Italy and France, fighting by the thousands and dying by the hundreds to prove their allegiance to America.\n\nMany people with whom Shinseki served, military and civilian alike, agreed with his self-assessment, stressing that he was a warrior of few words who sought to avoid the limelight. On changing the Army, for instance, Shinseki himself said: âI wanted to be the voice and the pen of change but I did not want to be the poster child for it.â\n\nOver his years in the Army, Shinseki became an avid student of the art of leadership. Officers who served with him were nearly unanimous in viewing his qualities besides humilityâa concept of duty and hard work, determination and tenacity, patience and perseverance. Said one officer: âRic has a presence. When he walks into a room, you know heâs there.â\n\nThey point to his erect posture, his deep and calm voice, his measured way of speaking. âHe is serious and he is not a back slapper,â said a general. Shinseki walks with a slight but distinct limp, the consequence of his wounds. âThat,â said another general, âis his badge of courage.â\n\nA mark of Shinsekiâs leadership has been his trust in subordinates. John S. Brown, who as a colonel was brigade commander under Shinseki when he was the First Cavalry Division commander, said: âGeneral Shinseki was a great believer in empowering his subordinates, and went to great lengths to make sure we understood the latitude and initiative we hadâand the responsibility that went with it. He got in the habit of calling his weekly meeting with the brigade commanders the âBaronâs Meeting,â a term used tongue-in-cheek to communicate the relative autonomy we each enjoyed.â\n\nDespite his reputation for quiet resolve, Shinseki can be candid and forceful. Shortly after he became chief of staff, he disclosed plans for making the Army lighter and more easily deployed and at the same time more lethalâand ran into a good bit of resistance within the Army. He told one audience, however: âIf you donât like change, youâll like irrelevance even less.â\n\nTo an audience of officers and defense contractors, he both pleaded and cautioned: âWork with us, help us; soldiers are counting on us to get it right, and quickly. And if you canât help, get out of the way. Weâre on the move.â\n\nAfter skeptics criticized the Armyâs program to acquire the Stryker armored vehicles, Shinseki allowed himself some heated words. âI appreciate the debate,â he said. âLook at our numbers, challenge our metrics, question our analyticsâtheyâre all on review. But donât question our honor or our integrity.â\n\nWoven through Shinsekiâs exercise of leadership is a mastery of language that belies his reputation for reticence and derives from several sources. One was a high-school teacher on Kauai who told the students, many of whom grew up speaking a lilting dialect known as âpidgin,â that they must speak standard English if they were to succeed outside of Hawaii.\n\nThen, just before he left Kauai for West Point, someone told him: âUp on the mainland, they discriminate. But they donât discriminate so much by race as they do by language. So if you speak standard English, they will accept you.â Shinseki said he found that to be true.\n\nAt West Point, Shinseki soon learned that if he was to lead soldiers, he must be able to communicate with them simply, clearly and quickly.\n\nShinseki said a highlight of his West Point years was to have been in Washington Hall on May 12, 1962, to hear Gen. Douglas MacArthur, the World War II commander in the Pacific, deliver his stirring farewell address on duty, honor, country. Shinseki said: âI can still picture this proud, deep-voiced old soldier speaking in the measured cadence of a Shakespearian actor on stage for a final performance.â He said MacArthurâs words âhave truly been rallying points for me in good moments and bad, when it was time to take stock and ask why.â\n\nDespite his strengths, Shinseki has a serious vulnerability in the Washington arena and that may be a strong distaste for partisan politics. As a soldier who has lived his professional life in the best American tradition as a stalwart warrior out of partisan politics, he is ill-suited to the divisive, bitter political warfare that rages through Washington today.\n\nEver since he left the Army after 38 years of service, Shinsekiâs name has been bandied about in the politics of Hawaii as a possible gubernatorial or senatorial candidate. But he has done nothing to encourage that possibility. In the eyes of a local friend: âRic has no stomach for that.â\n\nIn any case, he may have a lot more to do yet at the VA."
