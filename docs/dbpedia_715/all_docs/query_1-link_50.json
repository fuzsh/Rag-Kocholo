        "text": "Selzer History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nGermany\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the surname of Selzer was used in Germany. While the patronymic and metronymic surnames, which are derived from the name of the father and mother respectively, are the most common form of a hereditary surname in Germany, occupational surnames also emerged during the late Middle Ages. Many people, such as the Selzer family, adopted the name of their occupation as their surname. However, an occupational name did not become a hereditary surname until the office or type of employment became hereditary. The surname Selzer was an occupational name for a person who sold or extracted salt. A variety of similar German surnames are derived from the Old German word \"salt,\" meaning \"salt.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Selzer family\n\nThe surname Selzer was first found in the ancient province of Thuringia, where the name was closely identified in early mediaeval times with the feudal society which would become prominent throughout European history.
