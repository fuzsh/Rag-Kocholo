Cartoons.\n\nBiography[]\n\nAfter Leon Schlesinger sold his cartoon studio to Warner Bros. in 1944, Eddie was assigned as studio head by Jack Warner. Unlike his predecessor, Selzer did not want credit in the shorts, hence the byline \"A WARNER BROS. CARTOON\" was created.\n\nMuch of what is known about Eddie's life comes from Chuck Jones' biography, Chuck Amuck: The Life & Times of an Animated Cartoonist, in which the director indicates that the producer was an interfering bore with no sentiment or appreciation towards animated cartoons.\n\nSome historians also claim that Friz Freleng nearly quit after an argument with Eddie, who didn't think that pairing Sylvester with Tweety was an ideal decision. The argument culminated when Friz reportedly slammed his drawing-pencil on Eddie's desk, telling the producer that if he thought he knew so much about cartoons, then he should do the work instead. Eddie backed off on the issue and apologized to Friz later that evening and \"Tweetie Pie\", the very first Tweety/Sylvester pairing, went on to win WB's first Academy Award For Best Short Film (1947), with the duo proving to be one of the most endearing of Looney Tunes pairs.\n\nAccepting the Short Subject (Cartoon) award for \"Tweetie Pie\" from Shirley Temple at the 20th Academy Awards ceremony on 20 March 1948, Selzer said:"
