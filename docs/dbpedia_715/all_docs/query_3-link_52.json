        "text": "Warner Brothers had been distributing cartoons for other entities, but they wanted an in-house Animation Department.\n\nIn 1929, the team of Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising (shown on the left) had left Walt Disney and had created the first sound cartoon called Bosko, the Talk-Ink Kid. Leon Schlesinger at Warner Brothers wanted to use Bosko as a new talking character in a new series that WB dubbed as Looney Tunes. This started the Warner Brother Animation Department.\n\nHarman and Ising began hiring former Disney animators including Isadore \"Friz\" Freleng. Warner Brothers started releasing their animation as a 'Vitaphone Short Subject'\n\nSchlesinger then presented the creation of another series using WB's musical scores as a background to compete with Disney's Silly Symphonies and in 1931 Merry Melodies was born.\n\nIn 1933, a disagreement over funds caused Harman and Ising to leave WB and go to MGM to start their Animation Department. With this departure, a new character, Buddy, was created to replace Bosko.\n\nPorky Pig makes his debut in 1935 in the Merry Melodies release 'I Haven't Got a Hat' and became their main character. Schlesinger hired Fred \"Tex\" Avery, a Dallas cartoonist who had been working for Walter Lantz, as a supervisor for Merrie Melodies. The following year, radio actor Mel Blanc and musical director Carl Stalling join the WB animation team. 'Tex' Avery created his magic for WB from 1935 until 1941. Mel Blanc stayed with Warner Brothers until he died in 1989.\n\nIn 1939, a change came with Vitaphone ending and being replaced by Leon Schlesinger Productions. Leon Schlesinger Productions lasted until 1944 when Schlesinger sold his interests to Warner Brothers and Edward Selzer was placed in charge of the Animation Department. Schlesinger died in 1949.\n\nIn 1952, with dwindling budgets, the Animation Department had a complete make over and changed the look of the Warner Bros. cartoons.\n\nThe Animation Department was flying high through out the 1950s but by early 1960s theater attendance, and with it.. the demand for theatrical cartoons, dropped as television strengthened its foothold in American homes.\n\nIn 1964, WB closed the Animation Department and leased the studio to Fritz Freleng and David DePatie (DePatie-Freleng Enterprises Inc.). They make 37 cartoons under the Warner Bros. shield.\n\nIn 1967, the success of DePatie-Freleng got Jack Warner's attention, and he reopened the cartoon studio, but off the Warner lot. But in 1969, Warner Bros. decided to discontinue distribution of all short subjects, and the revived studio was.\n\nThere was such a demand in the 1970s that WB turned to doing Festivals utilizing complilations of older shorts and then tried some full length features.\n\nFull Feature Animated Films released by WB:\n\nBugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie (1979)\n\nLooney Looney Looney Bugs Bunny Movie (1981)\n\nBugs Bunny's 3rd Movie: 1001 Rabbit Tales (1982)\n\nDaffy Duck's Movie: Fantastic Island (1983)\n\nDaffy Duck's Quackbusters (1988)\n\nBatman: Mask of the Phantasm (1993)\n\nSpace Jam (1996)\n\nCats Don't Dance (1997) (with Turner Feature Animation)\n\nQuest for Camelot (1998)\n\nIron Giant (1999)\n\nKing and I (1999)\n\nPokemon: The First Movie (1999) (with 4Kids Entertainment and Nintendo)\n\nPokemon: The Movie 2000 (2000) (with 4Kids Entertainment and Nintendo)\n\nPokemon 3: The Movie (2001) (with 4Kids Entertainment, and Nintendo)\n\nLooney Tunes: Back In Action (2003)\n\nYu-Gi-Oh!
