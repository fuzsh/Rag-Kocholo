Freleng\n\nMusical Score ~ Norman Spencer\n\nAnimation ~ Paul Smith & Bob Clampett\n\nMPAA Certificate No. 1737\n\nNotes: The very first Warner cartoon to use the three-strip Technicolor process. It has been argued that this may have been the first to feature the rings--but considering how the music is cut short in the ending of the re-issue, it was most likely the last to feature the \"curtain\" titles.\n\n1936\n\nTHE CAT CAME BACK\n\nRelease Dates: 1936-02-08 (original), 1944-07-15 (reissue)\n\nVitaphone release no. 7138\n\nProduction no. 1361 (reissue)\n\nSeries: Merrie Melodies\n\nSupervision ~ I.

Freleng\n\nMusical Score ~ Bernard Brown\n\nAnimation ~ Jack Carr & Riley Thompson\n\nMPAA Certificate No. 1737\n\nNotes: The Blue Ribbon copy has a very abrupt and odd cut at the very end of the cartoon, right as it's beginning to iris out.\n\nLET IT BE ME\n\nRelease Dates: 1936-05-09 (original), 1944-09-16 (reissue)\n\nVitaphone release no. 7260\n\nSeries: Merrie Melodies\n\nSupervision ~ I.

Stalling\n\nMPAA Certificate No. 4936\n\nNotes: While a print of such does not exist as of February 2023, the original opening cue (and much of the film's score) can be heard in a Termite Terrace gag reel.\n\nPREST-O CHANGE-O\n\nRelease Dates: 1939-03-25 (original), 1949-02-05 (reissue)\n\nVitaphone release no. 8833\n\nSeries: Merrie Melodies\n\nSupervision ~ Charles Jones\n\nStory by Rich Hogan\n\nAnimation ~ Rudy Larriva\n\nMusical Direction ~ Carl W.

FRELENG - One of two appearances of the Jimmy Colonna-esque worm.\n\nINKI AND THE LION - MERRIE MELODIES - 1941-07-19, 1950-05-20 - SUPERVISION...CHARLES JONES\n\nSNOWTIME FOR COMEDY - MERRIE MELODIES - 1941-08-30, 1952-04-12 - SUPERVISION...CHARLES JONES\n\nTHE BRAVE LITTLE BAT - MERRIE MELODIES - 1941-09-27, 1952-03-15 - SUPERVISION...CHARLES JONES - As late as 2008, a 35mm of this short with original titles was known to exist.\n\nBUG PARADE - MERRIE MELODIES - 1941-10-11, 1952-07-12 - SUPERVISION...FRED AVERY (uncredited) - Final cartoon to be finished by Avery entirely before leaving.

JONES- The only short at WB animated by legendary animator/director Shamus Culhane.\n\n1944\n\nSWOONER CROONER - LOONEY TUNES - 1944-05-06, 1949-02-12 - DIRECTION...FRANK TASHLIN - Academy Award nominee. Notable for being George Cannata's sole onscreen credit (as animator) for Warner Bros. An original print exists at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and said print was screened at the Nitrate Picture Show in 2019.\n\nDUCK SOUP TO NUTS - LOONEY TUNES - 1944-05-27, 1951-01-06 - DIRECTION...I. FRELENG - An original print exists at UCLA, though no photos have been obtained.\n\nGOLDILOCKS AND THE JIVIN' BEARS - MERRIE MELODIES - 1944-09-02, 1951-12-01 - DIRECTION...I.

FRELENG - Most likely the last short to feature the shorter credits.\n\nFRESH AIRDALE - MERRIE MELODIES - 1945-08-25, 1952-08-30 - DIRECTION...CHARLES M. JONES - This film originally started production as \"For He's A Jolly Good Fala,\" and would've been Stan Freberg's very first voice role in a cartoon. However, President Roosevelt died during production, and much of the cartoon was re-worked, most likely so it would not be considered in bad taste. In addition, the film has some wartime related lines that were cut out for the Blue Ribbon re-issue, due to being irrelevant.\n\nTHE BASHFUL BUZZARD - LOONEY TUNES - 1945-09-15, 1953-02-07 - DIRECTION..ROBERT CLAMPETT - Like The Good Egg The original opening cue survives, but as of now no corresponding visual element exists.

JONES - Promotional material suggests the original title was just \"Eager Beaver.\"\n\nWALKY TALKY HAWKY - LOONEY TUNES - 1946-08-31, 1953-10-17 - DIRECTION...ROBERT McKIMSON - This cartoon most likely opened up with \"Henery Hawk in.\" Rumour has it that an original print was seen on local television as late as the 1970s and/or 80s.\n\nFAIR AND WORM-ER - MERRIE MELODIES - 1946-09-28, 1955-10-22 - DIRECTION...CHARLES M. JONES\n\nROUGHLY SQUEAKING - LOONEY TUNES - 1946-11-23, 1954-02-27 - DIRECTION...CHARLES M. JONES - As late as 2008, a 35mm of this short with original titles was known to exist.\n\n1947\n\nONE MEAT BRAWL - MERRIE MELODIES - 1947-01-06, 1954-07-10 - DIRECTION...ROBERT McKIMSON - Considering 9/10 animators worked on this short, the credits might've been a little all over the place.\n\nTHE GOOFY GOPHERS - LOONEY TUNES - 1947-01-25, 1955-07-23 - DIRECTION...ARTHUR DAVIS - First appearance of Mac & Tosh. Planned by Bob Clampett before he left the studio (he made it as far as the voice acting.)\n\nTHE GAY ANTIES - MERRIE MELODIES - 1947-02-15, 1954-04-24 - DIRECTION... I. FRELENG\n\nSCENTIMENTAL OVER YOU - LOONEY TUNES - 1947-03-08, 1953-12-26 - DIRECTION...CHARLES JONES - The reissue title is unique for being the only one to highlight the starring character, beginning with \"Pepe Le Pew in.\" Working title was \"Forever Ambushed.\"\n\nBIRTH OF A NOTION - LOONEY TUNES - 1947-04-12, 1953-11-07 - DIRECTION...ROBERT McKIMSON - Planned by Bob Clampett before he left the studio.\n\nALONG CAME DAFFY - LOONEY TUNES - 1947-06-14, 1954-07-24 - DIRECTION... I.
