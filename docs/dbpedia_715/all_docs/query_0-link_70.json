The author has essayed to briefly sketch such points of antecedent history as are necessary to explain the city's industrial growth and indicate the steps in her progress, and to present such a view of the present as will convey a faithful idea of the greatness of St. Louis as a commercial and manufacturing center.\n\nIn the pursuit of this result, information has been sought from the best available sources, and every endeavor has been made to secure accuracy. It is therefore believed that the statements and statistics contained in the book are in every instance as nearly correct as careful scrutiny could render them.\n\nTrusting that the utility of the book may be regarded as sufficient to compensate for whatever may be the shortcomings of its literary style, the author leaves its merits to be judged by the discriminating public.\n\nJ.

LOUIS FROM A FRENCH TRADING POST TO A GREAT METROPOLIS.\n\nThere is no lack of evidence of the fact that the spot upon which St. Louis now stands, and the country contiguous to it, formed the habitation, centuries ago, of races now extinct or represented only by a debased progeny, long since transplanted to other climes. The inquiry into the traits and characteristics of the Mound Builders and the measure of their advancement from barbarism, while interesting to the ethnologist or antiquarian, has no material bearing upon the history of St. Louis, which began, so far as the present has any important connection with it, one hundred and twenty-three years ago.\n\nThe record of the city since then has been one of steady and sturdy growth. Originally established as a fur trading post, and aspiring to nothing greater for nearly half a century, the town began to develop, after the American occupation, a position as an important distributive point, and to assume, as population and productiveness increased in the vicinity, the place for which she was so eminently fitted by her incomparable location and the physical advantages which had been so bountifully bestowed upon her by Nature. Later, by deliberate but sure and substantial advancement, the manufacturing interests of the city grew from small beginnings to gigantic proportions, and the city of to-day, one of the greatest, wealthiest and most prosperous on the continent, and the undisputed metropolis of the Mississippi Valley, is the result of the patient but sanguine industry, the sagacious improvement of opportunities, the energy and enterprise of her progressive citizens.\n\nAs an appropriate introduction to the presentation of the facts and statistics of the present, it will be proper to briefly sketch a few of the salient features of the city's early history, showing the progressive stages of the wonderful development of a primitive hamlet into a city of the first class.\n\nPIONEER DAYS.\n\nDeSoto crossed the Mississippi in 1541; Marquette sailed down it to the mouth of the Arkansas River in 1673, and La Salle explored its entire length in 1682. All these events, with the inspiring narratives of those who participated in them, offered the stimulus and prepared the way for the settlement of the Mississippi Valley and, as a consequence, of St. Louis, its center and metropolis.\n\nSt. Louis had its origin in the adventurous and enterprising spirit of a business man, bound on a business errand. The firm of Maxent, Laclede & Co., of New Orleans, obtained in 1762, from the Governor General of Louisiana, a grant of exclusive control of the fur trade with the Missouri and other tribes of Indians inhabiting this region. The youngest member of the firm, Pierre Laclede Liguest, commonly\n\n10\n\ncalled, after the French fashion, by his middle name of \"Laclede,\" was sent to choose a site for a trading post in what was then known as Northern Louisiana. He selected and named St. Louis, returning to Fort de Chartres for the winter. In February, 1764, Laclede sent his young companion and clerk, Augusts Chouteau, ahead of him, and the latter arrived with his men on the 14th of February, and the following day the trees were felled for the first log huts which were the germs of a great city. SPANISH DOMINION.\n\nAlthough the portion of Louisiana west of the Mississippi had been ceded to Spain by Louis XV two years before, the new colony had not heard of it, and it was not until 1770 that Spanish authority was asserted by the arrival, with a small body of Spanish troops, of Don Pedro Piernas, who took charge as governor. He was succeeded by Cruzat, who was followed in 1778 by Fernando de Leyba. During the latter's administration, on the day of the feast of Corpus Christi, May 25, 1780, the town was attacked by Indians. The war of the Revolution was then in progress, and the attack was charged to English influence. Governor Leyba was suspected, perhaps unjustly, of complicity in the affair, and was shortly afterward removed, his place being taken by Cruzat, who had been his predecessor. After Cruzat's second term, the governorship was successively held by Manuel Perez, Zenon Trudeau and Charles Dehault Delassus. In the latter part of 1803 the Territory of Louisiana was ceded back by Spain to France, but the same year Jefferson's purchase of Louisiana took place. Formal possession was taken by the United States Government, represented by Captain Amos Stoddard, March 10, 1804.\n\nTERRITORIAL TIMES.\n\nFrom the time of the change of government the growth of the village was more rapid, and its industries became more numerous. In 1808 Joseph Charless issued the first newspaper, the Missouri Gazette, the name of which was afterward changed to the Missouri Republican. In the same year the first incorporation of the town occurred, the municipal government being vested in five trustees.\n\nUp to 1811 the peltry and fur trade was almost the sole industry of the people. There are feeble records of small beginnings in other directions, but they were entirely confined to supplying the local needs. Laclede had established a small grist mill, a small brew house began to make porter and ale in 1810, and a few tradesmen supplied the simple wants of the town in other directions, but the fur trade was still the principal object of the existence of the place.\n\nIn 1811 the first brick house, a two-story structure at the corner of Main and Spruce streets, was built for the mercantile firm of Berthold & Chouteau. Soon after a small trade began to develop in lead and hemp. In 1812 the first shop for the manufacture of saddles, bridles and harness was opened; nails were manufactured in 1814, and in 1816 pottery was made. The same year saw the incorporation of the Bank of St. Louis. In 1817 there were twenty-one business houses in St. Louis and manufactures of copper and tin and of tobacco were begun. In 1819 the first foundry and first saw mill were started.\n\nThe first steamboat to reach St. Louis was the \"Zebulon M. Pike,\" from Louisville, which landed at the foot of Market street August 2, 1817. In a year or two, however, the steamboat ceased to be an object of curiosity, and the principal commerce of the city found its outlet and inlet by the Mississippi and its tributaries. The first boat for New Orleans, the \"Franklin,\" left in June, 1818, and the same year the first steamboat went up the Missouri River.\n\nThe population of the town grew from 1,100 in 1810 to 2,000 in 1815 and to 4,000\n\n11\n\nin 1820. The latter year saw the end of the struggle which had agitated the country in regard to the admission of Missouri to the sisterhood of States, the Missouri Compromise Bill being approved March 6, 1820, and the State Constitution being adopted July 19, following. ST. LOUIS AS A CITY.\n\nIn 1822 St. Louis became a city, a charter being granted by the Legislature and Dr. William Carr Lane being chosen as Mayor. From that time the pursuits of the citizens became more diversified. All kinds of tradesmen began to establish their shops, coal and lead sought a market in the city, and it had become the most important point in what was then \"The Far West.\" A branch of the Bank of the United States was opened in 1829; meat packing for local consumption was inaugurated in 1832, and in 1833 a marine railway for repairing steamboats was put in operation. In 1835 the Missouri Republican was first issued as a daily, and in 1837 gas was in use, the steamboat \"North St. Louis\" was successfully launched, and fire-brick manufacture was commenced.\n\nThe panic of 1837 here, as elsewhere, prostrated business for a time. Some of the banks suspended payment, and the Bank of the State of Missouri passed a resolution \"that the bank will in future receive from and pay only to individuals her own notes and specie on the notes of specie-paying banks.\" This resolution caused great financial stringency and severe loss to many. St. Louis, however, showed great recuperative power and was not so badly injured by the panic as were the majority of the cities of the country.\n\nThe growth of the city from its incorporation was steady and continuous. In 1839 a new charter was granted to the city, and at the next election Dr. Lane, who had been the first mayor of the city under its original charter from the State in 1822, was elected to a second term. In 1840, the population of the city was 16,469.\n\nINDUSTRIAL GROWTH.\n\nA contemporary writer summarizes the manufacturing industries of the city in 1841 as follows: Two foundries; twelve stove, grate, tin and copper manufactories; twenty-seven blacksmiths and housesmiths; two white lead, red lead and litharge manufactories; one castor oil factory; twenty cabinet and chair factories; two establishments for making linseed oil; three factories for the manufacture of lead pipe; fifteen tobacco and cigar manufactories; eleven coopers; nine hatters; twelve saddle, harness and trunk manufactories; fifty-eight boot and shoe shops that manufactured; six grist mills; six breweries; a glass-cutting establishment; a brittania manufactory; a type foundry; an oil cloth factory; a sugar refinery; a chemical and fancy soap manufactory; a pottery and stoneware manufactory; an establishment for cutting and beautifying marble; two tanneries, and several establishments for the manufacture of plows and other agricultural implements.\n\nIn the next ten years the advance of the city in industrial matters was very great. A cotton factory was started in 1844, and in 1846 glass, woolen, soap, candle and starch manufacturers had been introduced. About eighteen foundries were then in operation, and a number of flouring mills, machine shops, etc. The next year saw the completion of the first telegraph line connecting St. Louis with the Atlantic coast, and the first establishments for the manufacture of wood and willow ware and furniture; and in 1849 the first saw factory was started.\n\nYEARS OF DISASTER.\n\nOn the night of May 17, 1849, the greatest calamity that had yet befallen St. Louis occurred. A fire, believed to be incendiary, broke out on board the steamboat\n\n12\n\n\"White Cloud,\" lying between Wash and Cherry streets. The flames were quickly communicated to other boats, many of them the largest and finest engaged in the St. Louis trade, and some just arrived and others ready to depart with full loads. Freight was piled up on the levee, and this was soon in a blaze. A row of frame shanties between Vine and Locust streets were ignited, and the fire spread until fifteen blocks were destroyed in whole or in part. Twenty-three steamers were destroyed, and the aggregate loss of property was estimated as follows by the City Assessor: Stock and merchandise in store and on wharf. $5,000,000; steamboats and merchandise on board, $600,000; buildings burned, $502,290, a total of $6,102,290. Thousands were thrown out of employment by the fire and the indirect damage could not be calculated.\n\nThe same year St. Louis suffered from the cholera epidemic to an alarming degree. It had escaped from the visitation of the same disease in 1832 with comparatively light mortality; but, in the period beginning in December, 1848, and continuing through 1849 and 1850, a total of 5,157 deaths from the disease occurred. The disease was at its height in the summer of 1849, the deaths in June of that year amounting to 1,259, and in July, to 1,804.\n\nA DECADE OF PROGRESS.\n\nIn spite of these calamities the population of the city increased steadily, and in 1850, the government census placed the population of the city at 56,803, and two years later a sheriff's census made it 94,819. Much of this increase was the result of the heavy German immigration which followed the revolution of 1848. In three years 34,218 Germans arrived in St. Louis, about two-thirds of whom remained here. This acquisition has been an important factor in the development of the industries of the city, and has proved a valuable element of its citizenship, contributing largely to its progress and stability.\n\nThe first ground for railway construction was broken July 4, 1851, and a train was run from St. Louis to Franklin, over the First Division of the Missouri Pacific, July 19, 1853. Prosperous years followed, and in 1860, with a population of 160,773, St. Louis was the largest, as well as the most prosperous of all the cities of the West.\n\nTHE CIVIL WAR.\n\nThe outbreak of hostilities in 1861 was regarded as a severe blow to St. Louis. The South was her best customer, and the cutting off of communication with the lower Mississippi deprived her of a large and lucrative trade. Later on, however, the strategic advantages of the city's location served to open to its commerce other channels of activity. It became the supply point for the Union army operating in Missouri, Arkansas and Tennessee.\n\nThe times of the war were particularly exciting and full of dramatic incident in St. Louis. Her proximity to the scenes of conflict, and the fact that the city became the base of the operations of the armies of the Southwest made it the theatre of important events. Many of the citizens of St. Louis took part in the struggle, and acquitted themselves with distinction upon the field.\n\nIn 1863, the territory occupied by the Union army had widened, and the steamboats were given employment and many new ones built to supply the increased demand for their services. The wholesale merchants sought their supplies in New York, instead of in New Orleans, and manufacturers in most lines found an increased demand for their products. The suspension of trade relations with the South led to the extension of the business territory of St. Louis to the West, and when peace was restored, the population of the city had greatly increased, the\n\n13\n\nmarket for her goods and products had been considerably enlarged, her steamboat interest had expanded, her manufacturing establishments had increased in number and become more diversified, and all the fields of industry and commerce had been widened. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS.\n\nIt is in the years of peace that have elapsed since the close of the war that St Louis has made the most rapid strides. The city had at the time of the cessation of hostilities about 200,000 inhabitants. Its population has steadily increased until it is now about 500,000. The great and unprecedented development of the Mississippi Valley, with its wealth of agricultural, mineral and industrial resources, has given an impetus to the trade of the city, which has advanced, step by step, to its present proud and commanding position as a busy center of distribution and production.\n\nThe great Mississippi Bridge, begun in 1865, was completed in 1874, and is a monument to the skill and ingenuity of one of St. Louis' most distinguished citizens, the late Capt. J. B. Eads, whose work at the mouth of the Mississippi, in deepening the channel, has also proved of immense benefit to St. Louis by facilitating the means of direct export by that route. The great bridge gave the city a direct connection with the entire railway system of the East.\n\nThe means of communication with the entire country have been greatly improved in the past twenty years. The Pacific Coast has been brought into connection with the city by several rail routes. Railroads to Texas and Mexico have made them tributary, in a commercial sense, to St. Louis, and they now are an important part of her trade territory.\n\nThe greatest advancement has been in the direction of manufactures, which have become more varied. Old establishments have grown, and new ones have been successfully introduced, making the city a great productive as well as a distributive center.\n\nA marked improvement is apparent in the character and value of the buildings and in the general appearance of the city. The new Chamber of Commerce, the Custom House, the Exposition Building and nearly all the fine business blocks and handsome residence structures which are the leading architectural features of the city have been erected within the last twenty years. Improvements in paving, in water supply, in sanitation and in all the elements which go to constitute a metropolitan city of this advanced age, have been introduced, and in all the conveniences and refinements of business and social intercourse the history of the recent past has been one of constant progress.\n\n14\n\nThe Present and Future.\n\nSTATUS OF THE CITY OF TO-DAY — HER PROSPERITY, ADVANTAGES AND PROSPECTS.\n\nVOLUMES full of incident and interesting narration might be written, portraying scenes and events of past history in which St. Louis has been concerned, but they would be foreign to the purpose of this work, which is to present the facts showing her standing in commerce and the productive industries.\n\nThe city in area embraces 61.37 square miles, or 39,276Åº acres. It is 17 miles in length from north to south and 6 5/8 miles from the river to the western boundary; and it has 19.15 miles of river front. It is situated as to natural advantages more favorably than any interior city of the continent. The Missouri flows into the Mississippi twenty-one miles above the city, and the junction of the Illinois River with the Father of Waters is only twenty-four miles above St. Louis. The city is centrally located both as to the Mississippi Valley and the country at large, and has waterways to the north, south and west as well as to the sea. It is in the heart of the greatest food-producing region of the continent, and is central to a boundless wealth of minerals. Around it, within a radius of fifty miles, are vast supplies of coal, iron, granite, building stone, and earths adapted to the manufacture of glass. Productive lead mines are in the vicinity and seek St. Louis as a point of manufacture and distribution.\n\nThe greatness of St. Louis in the present, and her brilliant prospects for the future do not, however, depend upon any geographical accident. The favorable location of the city is a great advantage, of course, but the genius of the age is one that surmounts obstacles, and since the introduction of railways many places otherwise hopelessly beyond the possibility of becoming important, have been developed into thriving and populous municipalities.\n\nRESULTS OF ENTERPRISE.\n\nThe citizens of to-day have made St. Louis great by supplementing her natural advantages with all the aids of modern progress. As a railway center she has connections with all parts of the continent. The West, the Southwest, Mexico, and all the Southern States within the reach of the Mississippi sell their products and buy their supplies in her markets. In the Northwest she combats Chicago on its own ground with increasing success, and in many lines of industry has a lucrative trade with the country to the East.\n\nThe merchants and manufacturers of St. Louis have all the enterprise and push necessary to prosperity in this age of competition, and have made the city prominent in every important line of industry, and the leader in many. It is one of the greatest grain, flour and hay markets, and the largest horse and mule market on the continent,\n\n17\n\nthe leading cotton market of all the interior cities and a most important center of distribution for wool, hides and every description of agricultural produce. It leads all American cities in the manufacture of tobacco, of saddlery, of fire clay products, of chemicals and in many other lines of productive industry. It is the largest in hardware dealings, and only second to New York in the drug and grocery trade; and it is not surpassed by any city of the West in the volume of its transactions in all important jobbing lines.\n\nThe trade of the city grows from year to year, each season showing a material gain in trade territory acquired, and an increase in the aggregate of business transacted. Steady progress is made in the acquisition of trade facilities and the inauguration of new enterprises of commercial importance.\n\nELEMENTS OF SUCCESS.\n\nIn the past attempts have been made to arouse a national sentiment favorable to the removal of the federal capital from Washington to St. Louis. While the central position of the city gave great plausibility to the arguments of the enthusiastic and well-meaning gentlemen who were the advocates of the measure, it met with no great favor in the country at large, and has ceased to be seriously discussed.\n\nNo such expedient, however, is necessary to insure a steady increase in the already matchless prosperity of the city. Her merchants and manufacturers have long since learned that natural facilities are not all the prerequisites to the city's commercial and industrial progress; and they are waging a successful war with the business men of competitive cities, and combating for every inch of disputed trade territory. They are making a valiant fight against the many freight discriminations which have proven the greatest obstacle to their energetic and earnest endeavors to promote the city's commercial growth, and with the aid given them by the recent passage of the Interstate Commerce Bill by Congress will doubtless win the battle. The building of the Merchants' Bridge will remove the obstacle of excessive tolls across the Mississippi, and there is every prospect that, at no distant day, the city will be free from all unnatural checks imposed upon her commerce.\n\nA material point that has been gained is the general acquiescence of the business community of St. Louis in the fact that physical and geographical advantages are only a factor in the commercial progress of a city, and that enterprise and push are necessary to utilize them for the benefit of business. There was a time when St. Louis was charged with an ultra-conservatism amounting to inertness in her business methods. Her business men are still conservative in the sense of refraining from rash, reckless or dubious speculations, and conducting their affairs upon a basis which comprehends the payment of dollar for dollar, owning what they pretend to own, and operating upon capital not encumbered by mortgages. But whatever justification there may have been in the past for a charge of slow methods against any portion of her business community, there is none now, and progressiveness and energy are conspicuous in the business life of the city.\n\nA PRODUCING CENTER.\n\nThe main point of advantage in the present situation, and the brightest promise for the future, is found in the fact that recent development has been most conspicuous in the line of manufactures. St. Louis is not only a mart — it is a vast and busy workshop. Each succeeding year records an increase in its mills, it forges and its factories. The products of industry are not only bought, sold and handled in the city — they are made here. Old manufacturing establishments are enlarging their facilities and increasing their output; new ones are springing up almost daily. For\n\n18\n\nprogress in this direction, this city has more abundant resources than any location in the West. Every description of raw material for any line of manufacture which is to be found in North America can be procured in abundance within easy reach of St. Louis.\n\nAs a center of production the advantages of the city as a market for the purchase of materials and the distribution of the manufactured product are emphasized and given assurance of stability; and more encouragement for the future of the city is to be found in the steady increase and the expanding diversification of her manufactures, than from any other fact.\n\nA writer, about five years ago, after enumerating the States and Territories forming the commercial back country of St. Louis (to which Mexico has since been added,) said: \"When it is considered, therefore, that this city has such surroundings as have been here described; that she is the very center of the most productive agricultural region of the earth; that she is in immediate proximity and of convenient access to an inexhaustible deposit of the purest iron ore in the world; that she is at the head of navigation from the South, and at the foot of navigation from the North; that she is sustained and impelled forward by the immense illimitable trade of the Father of Waters and his tributaries; that she has the material around her for building up the most extensive and profitable manufacturing establishments that the world has ever known; that all the necessaries of life, the cereal grains and pork particularly, are produced in all the region round-about in such profusion that living must always be cheap, and that, consequently, she can support her population, though it should increase to almost indefinite limits; when all these facts are considered, who can feel disposed to set boundaries to her future progress?\n\n\"It will be seen in view of the territory thus tributary to St. Louis that she draws from a greater variety of resources, from a greater extent of country, that she is the center of more mineral wealth, more agricultural resources, and that she has the opportunity and is fast endowing herself with the instrumentalities for obtaining a vaster internal commerce than any city of the Union. Her manufactures are varied in kind and character, and conducted with less expense than those of any of her sister cities. Her population has been steadily swelled by the influx of immigration; her wares and merchandise find their market in every hamlet of the country, and compete in Europe with those of older countries.\"\n\nPRESENT PROSPERITY.\n\nIn the past few years many gratifying signs of increased business and material gain in commercial importance have become apparent. Among these is the steady growth of the city as a market for cotton, a business almost wholly acquired in the past twenty years, the gross receipts of the staple having increased from 19,838 bales in the season of 1866-67 to 244,508 bales in 1875-76, and 472,471 in 1885-86, while the through shipments have quadrupled and the net receipts nearly doubled in the past ten years. Increased facilities for reaching the cotton fields and the great inducements offered by St. Louis factors have combined to bring about this gratifying result, and the city has advanced to a position far in advance of any other interior city as a market for cotton.\n\nIn another important direction St. Louis has recently shown great activity. This is as a mining center. It is natural and in accordance with the necessities of the situation that the vast mining regions of the West should center their operations in the market at some point nearer to the mines than New York; and this business is rapidly being transferred to St. Louis. The building of railways throughout the mining regions has rendered them accessible, and the vast improvements in machines\n\n19\n\nand implements for mining and reduction works have greatly cheapened the cost of production, and many mines which a few years ago, on account of the low grade or refractory nature of their ores, were considered practically valueless are now productive and good paying properties. Much St. Louis capital is invested in the mines themselves, interesting the city in stocks of the mining companies; but it is not only in this direction that the commerce of the city is benefited by this enhanced development. In the manufacture and sale of improved machinery, tools and supplies for mining and reduction works, and in the general trade which is intimately connected with those industries, the city profits by the increased intimacy of the business relations of St. Louis with the mining camps of the West.\n\nSt. Louis has had to deal with injurious discriminations against her commerce in freight rates, but the prospects for the future are bright. Computing lines with equal terminal facilities will bring rates to a fair basis, and with an equal show in the race for trade, she need fear no competitor in commerce or manufacture.\n\n20\n\nTrade and Commerce.\n\nORGANIZATIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF THE BUSINESS INTERESTS OF THE CITY.\n\nSt. LOUIS, like all other important business centers, has a number of organizations which exert an influence for the welfare of the city in its trade relations. Some are intended to regulate and benefit specified industries, while others, having a wider scope, are devoted to the interests of the entire mercantile community, to adding to the facilities for business in all directions, and to shaping the commercial policy of the city.\n\nThese organizations are numerous, and it is only possible here to mention the larger and more important of them. All, however, the smaller as well as the larger, are aids to the business progress and development of the city.\n\nThe Merchants' Exchange. — This important commercial organization, having a total membership of 3,312, exerts a powerful influence for the good of the business community. Daily market reports are received by wire not only from all the important trade points in the United States but also from those of Europe. Through its committees the exchange attends to the classification and inspection of grain, flour, provisions and other commodities; represents the mercantile community in matters relating to transportation, river improvement and the extension of trade; and exerts its influence for the procurement of such State and federal legislation as is found to be necessary in behalf of the business interests of the country at large and the city in particular.\n\n21\n\nThe first exchange organized in St. Louis was the Chamber of Commerce, which formed in 1836. In 1849 an organization known as the Merchants' Exchange was organized, and in the same year the Millers' Exchange was formed. Later the two were united and acted in conjunction with the Chamber of Commerce, occupying the same building.\n\nA new exchange building was erected on Main street and formally opened in 1857. When the time of war came, dissensions which had been engendered by political excitement caused a rupture and led to the organization of \"The Union Merchants' Exchange of St. Louis\" in 1862, and in the same year the Chamber of Commerce went out of existence. In course of time the Union Exchange absorbed the members of the others, retaining its title until 1875, when the name was changed to that of \"The Merchants' Exchange of St. Louis.\" In the preamble to the rules and by-laws then adopted the object of the association is declared to be \"to advance the commercial character and promote the manufacturing interests of the city of St. Louis; to inculcate just and equitable principles of trade, establish and maintain uniformity in the commercial usages of the city, acquire, preserve, and disseminate valuable business information, and to avoid and adjust, as far as practicable, the controversies and misunderstandings which may arise between individuals engaged in trade.\"\n\nThe need of more commodious quarters for the exchange led to the organization, in 1871, of the St. Louis Chamber of Commerce Association, under the auspices of which the present spacious and elegant structure fronting on Third, Pine and Chestnut streets, was built and formally opened, with imposing ceremonies, on 21st of December, 1875. Mr. Rufus J. Lackland has been President of the Chamber of Commerce Association from its organization; the Vice-Presidents are Messrs. Charles Green and Adolphus Meier and Mr. George H. Morgan is Secretary and Treasurer.\n\nThe Merchants' Exchange has exerted great influence in behalf of the trade of the city. It has been managed by merchants of the highest order and standing, and it justly occupies a prominent position among the commercial bodies of the country.\n\nIn the compilation and dissemination of valuable trade information and statistics, the Secretary of the Exchange, George H. Morgan, has shown a rare discrimination, thoroughness and ability which fully justify his retention in his honorable position for the twenty-two years during which he has discharged the duties of the Post. The statistics used in this work are for the most part compiled from his complete and exhaustive statement of the trade and commerce of St. Louis.\n\nThe following are the officers of the Exchange for the year 1887: President, Frank Gaiennie; Vice-Presidents, Louis Fusz and Thomas Booth; Directors 1887, Henry C. Haarstick, Charles W. Isaacs, E. P. Bronson, Peter Nicholson, M. M. McKeen; Directors 1887-8, S. W. Cobb, P. P. Connor, Wm. T. Anderson, A. Nedderhut and S. R. Francis; Secretary and Treasurer, Geo. H. Morgan; Caller, Joseph P. Carr; Doorkeeper, James P. Newell.\n\nThe Cotton Exchange. — Another organization which has exerted an important influence in extending the trade and commerce of St. Louis is the Cotton Exchange. This body, which was originally known as the Cotton Association, was organized at a meeting held on October 17, 1873, the name, however, being changed to its present style of the \"St. Louis Cotton Exchange,\" on its incorporation in the allowing year. At the first regular meeting of the directory, held in 1875, the present Secretary, C. W. Simmons, was elected to the position which he has filled since with marked efficiency, securing the respect and commendation of all who have had dealings with him.\n\nSince the organization of this important body, and as a direct result of its earnest and intelligent efforts, the cotton trade of the city has developed from comparative\n\n22\n\ninsignificance to primary importance. The Exchange occupied rented premises until May 4, 1882, when with appropriate ceremony the present handsome and imposing structure was formally opened and occupied. This building, which is located at the southwest corner of Main and Walnut streets, was erected by the Cotton Exchange Building Company, is live stories in height, and fronts 85 feet on Main street and 135 feet on Walnut street.\n\nAs a result of the efforts of the Exchange and its members, the cotton trade of St. Louis has been brought to its present gratifying position of the largest in volume of any interior city in the country. In 1870-71 the receipts of cotton in this city were only 20,270 bales. In the season of 1885-86 the receipts amounted to 472,471 bales, while the present season gives promise of a still larger aggregate.\n\nThe membership of the Cotton Exchange embraces nearly all the cotton factors and dealers of the city. The organization has been managed from its inception upon enlightened and intelligent methods, by officers having the interests of the market at heart. The present executive of the Exchange, President George Taylor, is a very large handler of the staple, thoroughly informed as to the details of the trade, and possessed of ripe judgment and great administrative ability. The statistical labors of Secretary Simmons are an important aid to the carrying out of the purposes of the organization. The figures in regard to the cotton trade of the city, found elsewhere in this work, are compiled from his report. The officers of the Exchange for 1887 are: President, George Taylor; Vice-President, George B. Emmons; Secretary and Treasurer, C. W. Simmons; Directors: John M. Gilkeson, Jerome Hill, Thomas H. West, R. F. Phillips, John A. Senter, L. Frank and C. S. Freeborn.\n\nIntimately connected with the Cotton Exchange, and acting in harmony with it, is the St. Louis Wool and Fur Exchange, of which August Taussig is President and Julius Rashky, Secretary and Treasurer. This Association was established in 1880 to regulate the methods of transactions in wool and furs in this city, and to promote harmony and good fellowship among the members of the trade. The organization is not incorporated, but those belonging to it hold their meetings in the Cotton Exchange, of which they are all members.\n\nLive Stock Exchange. — The St. Louis Live Stock Exchange, which has its offices at the National Stock Yards, was organized October 20, 1885, and has a membership of about one hundred. The object of the organization is the promotion and development of the live stock industry in all its branches, the promulgation and enforcement of correct and uniform principles in all transactions pertaining to the buying and selling of live stock, and the protection of the interests involved.\n\nThe organization of the Exchange has proved a great benefit to the live stock trade of this market, and indirectly to the feeders and shippers of stock who patronize St. Louis. It has reformed a great many local abuses in the care and manner of handling stock, and by the influence which naturally followed a consolidation of the trade in this Association, has procured a great many advantages for the country shipper. It has also, by a strict enforcement of its rules, eliminated from the business everyone and everything of a suspicious or disreputable character, and placed the trade on a sounder and more reliable basis than ever before. Since its organization, nearly all the principal live stock markets have formed similar associations, all of which, as far as can be learned, have been equally successful in benefitting the live stock interests of the country.\n\nThe present officers of the Exchange are: President, W. L. Cassidy; Vice-President, C. M. Keys; Secretary and Treasurer, W. J. Broderick; Directors, Samuel Scaling, W. D. Little, E. J. Senseney, T. J. Daniel, C. C. Daly, R. P. Lindsay, J. G. Cash, C. C. Brown and R. H. Mann.\n\n23\n\nThe Mechanics' Exchange. — Several attempts, more or less successful, had made in the direction of the organization of an exchange for mechanics and artisans before 1856, in which year was formed an organization known as \"The Mechanics' and Manufacturers' Exchange,\" of which the present \"Mechanics' Exchange,\" incorporated September 20, 1875, is the development and outgrowth.\n\nThe objects of the association are declared by its constitution to be \"the promotion of mechanical and industrial interests in the city of St. Louis, to inculcate just and equitable principles of trade, to establish and maintain uniformity in the commercial usages of said city, to acquire, preserve and disseminate valuable business information, and also to adjust, as far as practicable, controversies and misunderstandings arising between individuals engaged in the various industrial pursuits.\"\n\nThe membership of the Exchange, which is large, includes many of the leading builders, mechanics, dealers in builders' supplies, etc., of the city, and the organization has been of great benefit and enjoys a steady prosperity. The office and rooms of the Exchange are located at No. 9 North Seventh street, and its executive officers for the present year are: President, James H. Keefe; First Vice-President, Mark Hudson; Second Vice-President, Thos. F. Hayden; Treasurer, Wm. S. Stamps; Secretary, Richard Walsh; Directors, Daniel Evans, James Duross, F. C. P. Tiedemann, P. J. Woodlock, P. Nagle, Thos. J. Kelly, Henry E. Roach, Thos. H. Rich, Jos. F. Nuelle, J. H. Daues, P. Kirby and W. B. Philibert.\n\nThe Associated Wholesale Grocers. — This corporation, comprising thirty members engaged in the wholesale grocery business, was organized in 1884 for the purpose, as recited in the preamble to its constitution, of promoting good fellowship among themselves, and for mutual benefit in their business affairs. These purposes have been subserved and the association has been useful in advancing the interests of the trade. The officers for the present year are: President, Peter Nicholson; Vice-President, Jacob Furth; Secretary and Treasurer, W. E. Schweppe; Directors, Peter Nicholson, Jacob Furth, W. E. Schweppe, J. R. Holmes, E. G. Scudder, F. H. Beims and L. J. Peck.\n\nSt. Louis Real Estate and Stock Exchange. — The premises occupied by this association are at Nos. 14 and 16 North Seventh street. It was organized in 1877 and incorporated in 1881. The object of the organization is to provide facilities for agents to meet and discuss matters pertaining to real estate; to provide and keep on bulletin boards, for public inspection, a record of houses, rooms and stores for rent and property for sale, and to furnish the housekeeper, real estate buyer and public generally with information regarding realty in the city. The Exchange furnishes to its members an institution where public and private sales of real estate, stocks, and other property can be conducted.\n\nThe Exchange is one of the most prosperous business organizations in the city, and has a large and steadily increasing membership, comprising many of the most prominent dealers in realty. The present officers of the Exchange are: President, James S. Farrar; Vice-President, Leon L. Hull; Secretary and Treasurer, these gentlemen, with the following four others, composing the Board of Directors: J. T. Percy, T. F. Farrelly, John G. Priest and Marcus A. Wolff.\n\nMerchants' and Manufacturers' Association. — This important organization, which was formed some three years ago, has exerted a wide influence in behalf of the general interests of the business of the city, and to promote the welfare of the commercial and manufacturing community in all legitimate ways. A special subject in which it takes an active and abiding interest is the correction of discriminations by railroads in rates to the injury of the commerce of the city,\n\n24\n\nexerting a potent influence toward securing from the State and National Legislatures such corrective action as may secure to the city a just and equalized tariff on all common carrier lines.\n\nThe officers of the Association are: President, John R. Holmes; First Vice-President, Wm. M. Senter; Second Vice-President, V. O. Saunders; Third Vice-President, E. F. Williams; Secretary, J. J. Wertheimer; Assistant Secretary, John G. Shelton. The office of the Association is at 518 Washington avenue.\n\nThe St. Louis Furniture Exchange. — This Association, organized in 1879, has forty members connected with the furniture trade and kindred occupations. The objects of the organization are stated to be to \"secure and promulgate among its members the best information obtainable regarding the standing, habits and reliability of the various dealers to whom the goods of its members are likely to be sold, and thus not only protect the interest of its members, but also advance the interest of well-meaning and prudent dealers. It also aims to secure just and equitable rates of transportation and insurance.\" Jacob Kaiser is President; A. H. Dreyer, Secretary, and J. G. Koppelman, Treasurer of this organization.\n\nSt. Louis Furniture Manufacturers' Association. — This organization was formed in 1886, about the time that extensive strikes had been inaugurated, in order that those engaged in the manufacture of furniture and chairs might meet and discuss matters for their mutual benefit and protection, the Furniture Exchange being largely composed of gentlemen belonging to other trades. The Association has twenty-one members, and Alb. Bornmueller is President; Daniel Aude, Treasurer, and J. W. Tremayne, Secretary.\n\nImplement and Vehicle Manufacturers' Association. — This organization is devoted to the interest of the manufacturing industries mentioned in its corporate title, and serves a useful purpose in facilitating the discussion and adjustment of matters of mutual concern among those engaged in these lines. The officers of the Association are: A. Mansur, President; D. W. Haydock and Wm. Koenig, Vice-Presidents; T. W. Haydock, Treasurer, and G. K. Oyler, Secretary.\n\nOTHER BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS.\n\nAlthough there have been and now are a number of other organizations, all useful in their way, the foregoing comprise the principal ones now in active existence, having for their object the extension or protection of trade and manufacture.\n\nBoard of Fire Underwriters. — The membership of this useful organization embraces three local joint stock insurance companies, fifty-eight other domestic companies and twenty-four United States branches of foreign companies. The officers of the Board are: President, James A. Waterworth; Vice-President, John R. Triplett; Secretary, C. T. Aubin; Assistant Secretary, A. C. Acton, and Treasurer, James E. Cowan.\n\n25\n\nBoard of Underwriters (Marine.) — The companies represented by this Board are the Marine Insurance Company and the Citizens' Insurance Company, of St. Louis; Boatman's Fire and Marine, Pittsburgh; St. Paul Fire and Marine, Minnesota; Enterprise Fire and Marine, Cincinnati; Louisville Underwriters, Kentucky; Phenix Fire and Marine, Brooklyn; Boston Marine, Massachusetts; Insurance Company of North America, Philadelphia; Commercial Fire and Marine, San Francisco; Western Assurance Company, Toronto, Canada; and the Greenwich Insurance Company, of New York.\n\nThe present officers of the Board are: President, Howard A. Blossom; Vice-President, John P. Harrison; Secretary and Adjuster, James Barnard; Inspector of Hulls, Silas Adkins. The Board, which was incorporated in 1860 by an act of the legislature, maintains a well disciplined Salvage Corps, and has performed valuable service in the protection of property and the adjustment of marine losses.\n\n26\n\nTransportation Facilities.\n\nRAILROAD SYSTEMS AND WATER ROUTES ACCELERATING THE CITY'S COMMERCE.\n\nIN facilities for transportation by rail and river, St. Louis is the most advantageously situated city on the continent. Fifteen railroads enter this city, which, with their connections give its commerce easy access to every railroad point in all directions. Converging from St. Louis as a center, vast trunk lines stretch out in every direction; and other railroads recognize the central importance of the city by their anxiety to secure terminals here. The river affords great facilities for and greater possibilities of aid to the commerce of the city, is a convenient outlet for a direct export trade, and must remain a permanent source of profitable and expanding business.\n\nTHE RAILWAY LINES.\n\nEach year marks a distinct gain in the shipping facilities of St. Louis by rail routes. By their aid even Mexico has been made tributary to her commerce, and in every direction these vast arms of trade stretch out and radiate from the city, which is so situated on the track of traffic between the East and the West, that it must ever maintain its central point of vantage. Every enterprise in the direction of new East and West lines must necessarily consider St. Louis as an important factor in its plans, and the future gives certain promise of an increase in railroad facilities from year to year. Every railroad built in the West must tap one or more of the trunk lines centering at St. Louis, and add to the trade facilities of the city.\n\nThe Missouri Pacific. — This road, with its leased and operated lines, includes more than six thousand miles of railway located in Missouri, Arkansas, Texas, Indian Territory, Kansas and Nebraska; and connecting St. Louis with those States and Colorado, Old and New Mexico, and all the States of the West. Included under the Missouri Pacific management are the Missouri Pacific proper, the Missouri, Kansas and Texas, and the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railroads, with a number of branches and leased lines connected with each of these. It forms a part of the Gould system, and is one of the most prosperous and important routes in the country.\n\nThe Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific. — This system, which has passed into the control of the Courts, has recently been divided, the lines between St. Louis and Kansas City, Council Bluffs and Des Moines, west of the Mississippi, and the lines between Detroit and Logansport, and Indianapolis and Michigan City, east of the Mississippi, being still operated by the Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific Railway Company in connection with the Gould syndicate, with the headquarters at St. Louis.\n\n29\n\nThe other portion of the road, east of the Mississippi, is operated separately, with Gen. McNulta as Receiver, and extends from East St. Louis to Chicago, 286 miles and to Toledo, 436 miles. The Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific operates about 900 miles west of the Mississippi.\n\nThe St. Louis and San Francisco. — One of the most important routes to the business of the city is the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway, which also operates the Central Division of the Atlantic and Pacific Railway, completed to Sapulpa, I. T. The company has a line via Fort Smith, Ark., to Paris, Tex., which only lacks a few miles of completion, at this writing, and will be ready for business, through to Paris, in June of the present year. The company also has lines to Halstead and Bluff City, Kansas, and a number of smaller branches. The Texas line will be pushed from Paris to a connection with the Houston and Texas Central, which will give St. Louis a route able to compete with those now controlling the bulk of the Texas business. The country traversed by this line is of the greatest importance to the commerce of the city, and the St. Louis and San Francisco does an immense business in the transportation of cotton, grain and the other valuable products, vegetable and mineral, of Texas, Arkansas, Kansas and Indian Territory. It is ably and aggressively managed, and its interests being identical with those of St. Louis, has maintained liberal relations with the merchants and manufacturers of the city.\n\nThe Chicago and Alton. — This road makes an air line connection between St. Louis and Chicago, and has a Missouri Division from St. Louis to Kansas City. It forms one of the most important items in the shipping facilities, is under enlightened and efficient management, and has one of the finest tracks and most complete equipments, both for freight and passenger traffic, in the country.\n\nThe Vandalia Line. — This is the name by which is known the St. Louis, Vandalia, Terre Haute and Indianapolis Railroad, and which is the connection of the Pennsylvania Railroad system. It is the shortest route from this city to Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and New York, and also a favorite route for Cincinnati via the Cincinnati, Indianapolis, St. Louis and Chicago Railway; and, in addition, has a line to Chicago, via the Illinois Central. It is over this line that the fast mail from the East arrives.\n\nThe Ohio and Mississippi. — This road was the first to reach the Mississippi River from the East, having been completed from Cincinnati to St. Louis in 1857. It has branches to Shawneetown and Springfield, Ill., and Louisville, Ky. In connection with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, it forms a direct line to Washington and Baltimore, and by its Erie connection to New York. It is a valuable aid to the commerce of St. Louis in freight traffic with Southern Illinois and Indiana.\n\nThe Indianapolis and St. Louis. — This line, which extends from St. Louis to Cleveland, Ohio, is under the control of the Columbus, Cincinnati and Indianapolis Railroad, known as the \"Bee Line.\" Its eastern connections are with the Lake Shore and New York Central systems.\n\nThe Chicago, Burlington and Quincy. — This extensive system comprises a mileage in Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota and Illinois of over 5,000. It forms a valuable outlet for the trade of St. Louis, west to Denver and north as far Paul. The system embraces the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy proper; the Hannibal and St. Joseph; Chicago, Burlington and Northern; Burlington and Missouri River, and a number of leased and operated lines. It reaches St. Louis the east by the Indianapolis and St. Louis track, and on the west by the St. Louis, Keokuk and Northwestern.\n\n30\n\nThe St. Louis, Keokuk and Northwestern. — This road is a part of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy system, and extends from Keokuk, Iowa, to St. Peters, Mo., where it connects with the St. Louis, Wabash and Pacific, over the tracks of which road it reaches St. Louis. During 1888 it is contemplated to complete the road from St. Peters to St. Louis, giving the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy system a complete and independent route into the city.\n\nThe Cairo Short Line. — This is the best known name of the line extending from East St. Louis southward to Du Quoin, Ill., with a branch thence east to Eldorado. The corporate name of the company is the St. Louis, Alton and Terre Haute Railroad Company, the main line of which, from St. Louis to Terre Haute, Ind., is leased to the Indianapolis and St. Louis Railroad Company. The former company has recently acquired the St. Louis Southern Railroad, formerly known as the St. Louis Coal Road, branching from the Cairo Short Line at Pinckneyville, Ill., and crossing the Illinois Central at Carbondale. This connection is a very important one, as the St. Louis Southern reaches the Big Muddy and Cartersville coal fields. The Cairo Short Line is the Illinois Central connection for St. Louis, and part of the Great Jackson Route for the South.\n\nThe Mobile and Ohio. — This line extends from St. Louis to Mobile, Ala. Its main line is from Mobile to Cairo, Ill., and connection is made with St. Louis over the St. Louis and Cairo, which was changed last year from a narrow gauge to a standard gauge road and leased by the Mobile and Ohio. It is an important outlet for the trade of St. Louis with the Southeast.\n\nThe Louisville and Nashville. — This system is the greatest in the section southeast of the Mississippi River, reaching from St. Louis, via Evansville, Nashville and Montgomery to Mobile and New Orleans, and having leased lines and connections covering all the Southern States east of the Mississippi. It affords St. Louis an additional route to the Atlantic seaboard through its connection, at Lexington, Ky., with the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad, to Newport News.\n\nThe St. Louis, Arkansas and Texas. — This road, which was originally a narrow gauge, known as the Texas and St. Louis, or \"Cotton Belt Route,\" was changed to standard gauge during the past year. At present its business in and out of St. Louis is done under traffic agreements with the Mobile and Ohio, between St. Louis and Como, the Iron Mountain between St. Louis and Belmont Crossing, and the Cairo Short Line and Illinois Central via Du Quoin, Ill. The company, however, is preparing to secure an independent entrance to St. Louis by extending its road from Maldon, Mo., to this city. Southward the line extends to Mount Pleasant, Tex., from which point construction is in progress to Sherman, Tex. Other projected extensions of this road are from Magnolia, Ark., to Shreveport, La., and from Cotton Center, Ark., to Little Rock. This line is a valuable adjunct to the cotton trade of St. Louis, and important for the facilities it offers for the shipment of every description of merchandise from this city to a large portion of its most important trade territory.\n\nThe Toledo, Kansas City and St. Louis. — This road, forming an important part of the transportation systems centering in St. Louis, is a direct line from this city to Toledo, Ohio, 450 miles, and reaches many portions of Illinois. Indiana and Ohio by the shortest routes.\n\nThe Illinois and St. Louis. — This road extends from the east side of the river to Belleville, 15 miles, and has branches, including the Venice and Carondelet Belt Line, which are 28 miles in length. Notwithstanding its restricted mileage, it is of great importance to St. Louis, as it taps the principal coal fields in the territory in Illinois adjacent to St. Louis. This road, with its connections, is operated by the Wiggins Ferry Company, and does an immense business.\n\n31\n\nOTHER RAILROAD ENTERPRISES.\n\nWith the exception of a few local and suburban roads, and the bridge and tunnel line, the roads above enumerated comprise the railways now completed, and through which the vast trade and traffic of St. Louis finds its outlet and inlet by rail routes to every point of the compass. Through them every part of the continent is brought into close connection with its most central city. Other definite railroad enterprises of interest to St. Louis are in a tangible shape, which affords immediate promise of an important augmentation of the railroad facilities of the city. Among these is the St. Louis, Kansas City and Colorado Railroad, now extending from the western limits of the city, and rapidly being constructed to Union. It is intended to push this road far into Kansas, with a branch to Kansas City. Consolidated with this road is the Central Railroad of Missouri, which has concluded to abandon the \"Alton\" route and build direct. This system will be of great benefit to St. Louis, opening to its market easy access from the valley of the Missouri and points on the Central Railroad of Missouri.\n\nThe St. Louis and Edwards County Railroad will tap an important coal region in Illinois, and form a most useful addition to the means of obtaining a cheap coal supply.\n\nThe Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe will soon, it is expected, extend its lines to this city, forming another important link between St. Louis, the Southwest, and Mexico. The St. Louis and Central Illinois, running from Springfield, Ill., to Grafton, Ill., contemplates an extension to Alton, Ill., from which point it will connect with St. Louis, either by traffic arrangements with existing lines, or by an independent route of its own.\n\nSt. Louis Merchants' Bridge Company. — A sketch of the railroad facilities and prospects of St. Louis would be incomplete without a reference to this company, which was incorporated in May, 1886, under the auspices of the Merchants' Exchange, and secured from Congress, at its recent session, a franchise for a high bridge. Back of the company are ample resources, and the construction of the new bridge at the earliest practicable date is assured, when the necessary terminal facilities are obtained. This bridge will be a great boon to the interest of St. Louis, affording relief from excessive bridge tolls and an easy means for the entrance into the city of any railroad desiring to reach St. Louis from any direction.\n\nThis city has suffered in the part from injurious discriminations in freight rates in favor of competing cities. It is believed that the Interstate Commerce Bill, passed at the last session of Congress, will operate favorably to the interests of St. Louis, and tend to remove the arbitrary barriers interposed in the path of her commercial progress.\n\nRIVER TRANSPORTATION.\n\nIn convenient situation as to inland water routes, St. Louis is more favorably seated than any other city on the continent, being practically at the junction of the Missouri and Illinois rivers with the Mississippi. The commerce of the upper river terminates at St. Louis, and that of the lower river originates here. Even prior to the advent of railroad building in the West the city became important because of its facilities for transportation by the rivers.\n\nThe work done under the direction of the late Capt. J. B. Eads at the mouth of the Mississippi gave a new impetus to river traffic by making feasible a connection with ocean navigation, and opening up the grain movement via New Orleans and the jetties, giving an outlet by the way of the Gulf of Mexico for the exporting\n\n32\n\nof the products of the great West. For the complete accomplishment of this great work upon a scale commensurate with the necessities of the situation, further improvement of the river channel by the Government is needed; but when it is done it will reduce the cost of transportation, of the surplus product to foreign markets to a minimum, and add to the business importance of St. Louis, which will be the natural point of shipment for this immense exported surplus.\n\nThe rivers serve a most useful purpose in behalf of the commerce of the city by restricting discriminations in freight rates between St. Louis and all those points easily reached by water, and rail rates must, so far as competing points are concerned, be kept within reasonable bounds by the competition of steamboats and barges.\n\nThe rapid and constant increase of railroad lines in every direction took away from the river lines the monopoly of the carrying business they formerly enjoyed, but the more bulky freights, and all those which will not justify the extra expense of rail transportation still seek the water routes.\n\nThe Missouri River trade has most felt the effect of the competition of the railroads, and the only regular traffic up that river from St. Louis, is that carried on by seven steamboats and three tow boats, none of which go higher than Kansas City.\n\nA prosperous trade is still carried on to points on the Upper Mississippi from St. Louis to St. Paul by packet lines, raft boats and tow boats. Besides this traffic, the rafting of lumber down the river from the Upper Mississippi above Minneapolis, the Minnesota, St. Croix, Chippewa, Black and Wisconsin Rivers, is of immense value to the Mississippi Valley. During 1886 the amount received at St. Louis reached 140,000,000 feet of lumber, nearly 7,000,000 feet of logs and 86,500,000 pieces of shingles, laths and pickets.\n\nOn the Lower Mississippi shipments are increasing as a result of the enhanced facilities for through grain trade. There is also a considerable traffic with Ohio River points and a steadily increasing one with the Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers.\n\nThe volume of the river business of St. Louis cannot be better exhibited than by the following table, showing the amount of freight in tons received at and shipped from St. Louis in 1886 by the rivers:\n\nRECEIVED. SHIPPED. Upper Mississippi River 140,880 46,190 Lower Mississippi River 173,610 431,945 Illinois River. 88,010 5,175 Missouri River. 32,620 24,255 Ohio River. 116,885 26,060 Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers. 18,200 25,075 Red and Ouachita Rivers — 3,195 Total tons 1886 570,205 561,895 \" \" 1885 479,065 534,175 \" \"1884 520,350 514,910\n\nThe extent of the direct export trade of this city via New Orleans and the jetties is shown in the fact that last year the shipment of bulk grain by river to New Orleans for export amounted to 8,834,924 bushels.\n\nThe principal steamboat and barge lines running out of St. Louis are: The New Orleans \"Anchor\" Line, from St. Louis to Vicksburg, New Orleans and intermediate points; the St. Louis and Mississippi Valley Transportation Company, steamers and barges, also between this city and New Orleans; the \"Diamond Jo\"\n\n33\n\npackets between St. Louis and St. Paul; the St. Louis and St. Paul Packet Company; the St. Louis and Kansas City \"Electric\" Packet Company; the St. Louis and Clarksville Packet Company; the Naples Packet Company, to Illinois River points; Gray's Iron Line and Brown's Line, to Pittsburgh and Wheeling, on the Ohio River; and the St. Louis and Tennessee River Packet Company, and the Evansville, Paducah and Tennessee Packet Company, on the Cumberland and Tennessee rivers.\n\nExports and Imports.\n\nAs before stated, the bulk grain exported from St. Louis via New Orleans in 1886 amounted to 8,834,924 bushels. In addition to this the exports to foreign countries by Atlantic seaports were very large. It is not possible to give a fair idea of the amount in figures, as much is shipped to seaboard cities on local bills of lading; but even the amount sent abroad on through bills of lading makes an important showing for the commerce of St. Louis. Included in the commodities thus shipped were: Corn, 105,410 bushels; flour, 173,840 barrels; cotton, 146,467 bales; tobacco, 1,952 hhds.; meats, 3,153,872 lbs.; tallow, 912,000 lbs.; lard, 23,803 lbs.; walnut lumber, 1,008 tons, bran, 542 tons; grease, 44,800 lbs.; beer 670 casks; dried apples, 430,976 lbs.; bone black, 200 tons; live hogs, 9,010; sundries, 1,990,369 lbs.\n\nThe direct importations of the city from foreign countries in 1886 were worth, in foreign values, $3,315,187, upon which duties were paid amounting to $1,517,905.73, these amounts being exclusive of packages remaining in bond. Leading among the imports were articles with foreign values as follows: Chemicals, $105,705; china and earthenware, $131,547; glass and glassware, $124,259; hops, $142,803; manufactures of iron and steel, $554,910; of cotton, $184,138; of linen, $90,297; of wool, $165,165; sugar, $711,766; tobacco and cigars, $118,354; wines and spirits, $101,737; cutlery, $86,986; fire arms, $68,765. In addition to these articles the direct importations included ale and beer, anvils, art works, books and printed matter, bricks and tiles, barley, breadstuffs, brushes, cements, lime and plaster, cork, dairy and meat products, druggists' sundries and fancy goods, files, fish, glue, gunpowder, percussion caps, hair and manufactures of hair, jewelers' merchandise, manufactures of leather, india rubber, metals, paper, silks and wood, musical instruments, nuts and fruits, oils, paints, colors, philosophical instruments, rice, seeds, spices, varnishes, vegetables, etc.\n\nOf course the figures given above do not convey anything like an approximate idea of the amount of imported goods brought to St. Louis. Many of the large importing houses in this city have branches in eastern seaports, where the duties are paid, and the articles so received do not figure in the returns of the Custom House in this city. So with exports, much of the traffic of St. Louis is carried on through agents in Atlantic ports, from which goods are shipped to Europe and elsewhere.\n\n34\n\nMerchants and Traders.\n\nBUSINESS TRANSACTED BY THE WHOLESALE DEALERS AND JOBBERS OF ST. LOUIS.\n\nIT IS NOT possible to distinguish, with anything like accuracy, between the transactions of merchants and manufacturers. In the majority of cases manufacturers sell their own product to a greater or less extent, and have traveling men representing them on the road, selling direct to the wholesale or retail trade. Many business houses originally started for the purpose of doing a wholesaling or jobbing, trade have found it to their interest to add a manufacturing department in some of the lines they handle.\n\nIn treating of the various industries of the city, the several lines which are connected with the business of the city as a point of distribution will be first noticed.\n\nTHE GRAIN TRADE.\n\nThe central position of St. Louis in the most productive section of the country gives it great importance as a center of distribution for grain and other products of agriculture, and causes its transactions in the various cereals to reach an enormous volume. All the necessary facilities for a great grain market are to be found in the city. With an elevator capacity increased to 13,000,000 bushels in bulk and about half a million in sacks, and the Mississippi river and a vast railroad system as feeders, the only drawback to a steady and continuous annual increase in the transactions of the city as a center of receipt and distribution for grain has been the discriminations in freight rates from the West in favor of other markets. An import of ant step in the correction of these discriminations has been taken by the passage of the Interstate Commerce Law. The building of the new Merchants' Bridge, by admitting competing lines to equal terminal facilities with those already in the city will also, in all probability, prove a great benefit in this direction.\n\nIn regard to the grain trade for the year 1886, the report of the Merchants' Exchange makes a favorable showing, with the single exception of corn, in which there was a decrease in receipts. The total receipts of grain for the year aggregated 39,100,923 bushels, and the shipments 17,595,754 bushels. Including flour reduced to wheat, the receipts equaled 42,918,799 bushels, and the shipments 27,690,878 bushels.\n\nThe year 1886 was marked by an interruption to traffic in the spring season by strikes, first on the Missouri Pacific system and afterward on the roads terminating in East St. Louis, and trade in all lines was considerably affected, and both receipts and shipments of all commodities were doubtless decreased by the partial suspension of traffic.\n\n35\n\nWheat. — The wheat crop of 1886 was very large, and the business of the St. Louis market in that cereal increased in a ratio corresponding with the increase in the crop over that of 1885, the receipts of wheat for the past year being 12,309,364 bushels, against 10,690,677 bushels received in the preceding year. The States from which St. Louis draws her principal supplies of wheat are Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas and Nebraska, and the increase in receipts was general from all sources, but especially from Tennessee and Kentucky. The shipments of the year were 2,429,462 bushels. They were less to Eastern seaboard points, but greater by 700,000 bushels for export via New Orleans. The demand from city mills took 8,133,055 bushels, in the manufacture of 1,807,956 barrels of flour.\n\nCorn. — The corn crop of 1886 fell off considerably from that of the preceding year, and the decrease in receipts at St. Louis was in still greater proportion, the discrimination in freight rates in favor of competing cities diverting much of the supply to other points. The removal of this obstacle will doubtless regain to St. Louis its leading position as a corn market. The receipts for the year were 16,387,071 bushels, of which 11,859,405 bushels came from west of the Mississippi. The shipments for the year were 11,848,995 bushels, of which 7,501,730 bushels went to New Orleans by the barge line for export, while 103,550 bushels went to Europe direct via Atlantic cities, 1,693,160 bushels went east for a market, 1,614,979 went south by rail for consumption, 875,649 bushels went south by river to local points, 48,315 bushels went north by rail and river, and 11,612 bushels went west by rail and the Missouri river. A large amount was required for the manufacture of the 415,420 barrels of corn meal, and 70,869 barrels of hominy and grits turned out by the city mills in 1886.\n\nOats and Rye. — The oat crop of 1886 was not so large as in the previous year, but there was an increase of 43,386 bushels in the receipts at St. Louis, which amounted to 7,420,915 bushels, received about equally from the west, north and East. The shipments amounted to 2,764,922 bushels, most of which went to the Southern States for consumption.\n\nThe receipts of rye for the year were 726,798 bushels, an increase of 90,158 bushels over the preceding year, the bulk of receipts being from the West. The shipments, which were mostly to the East and local points for consumption, amounted to 636,640 bushels, an increase of 299,622 bushels over the shipments for 1885.\n\nBarley. — The receipts of barley for the year were 2,529,731 bushels, nearly all of which was taken by maltsters and brewers in this city for the manufacture of beer and ale. Most of the receipts were from Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Canada.\n\nAt the close of the year the stocks of grain in store in public elevators amounted in bushels to: Wheat, 4,411,912; corn, 1,254,818; barley, 100,982; oats, 578,220; rye, 23,973.\n\nCotton. — St. Louis is the largest interior cotton market in the Union, its accessibility by both rail and river, and the superior facilities it possesses for handling the staple being recognized as the main factors in securing for it its prominence in the cotton trade. The cotton year ends August 31, and the figures for the season of 1885-86 showed a gratifying increase in receipts over those for the preceding year. The gross receipts for the year were 472,471 bales, and the gross shipments 464,156 bales, an increase in receipts of 181,517 bales, and in shipments of 173,299 bales, as shown by the report of the Cotton Exchange. The present season gives Promise of an equally prosperous cotton business, the gross receipts for the seven months from September 1, 1886 to April 1, 1887, aggregating 404,120 bales, and the shipments during the same period 380,336 bales.\n\n36\n\nThe sources of supply for cotton corning to St. Louis are Arkansas and Texas, from which States 90 per cent, of the cotton shipped to this market is received, the remainder coming from Mississippi, Tennessee, Missouri, Indian Territory, Kentucky and Louisiana, in the order named.\n\nIn the direction of shipments there has been a steady annual increase in the amount shipped eastward by rail for consumption, while the amount for export shows a corresponding decrease. The stock of cotton on band at the close of the year was 9,924 bales, a larger stock than was ever before carried over into a new cotton year.\n\nThe annual report of the Cotton Exchange for 1885-86 sums up the advantages which this market holds out to the planter and merchant of the South for the consignment of his cotton as follows: \"The certainty of liberal and fair dealing by the factors, the competition of buyers from all the manufacturing centers, favorable freight rates to and from all points, freedom from expense at the warehouses, and their superior facilities for handling the fleecy staple, its protection from fire and the elements, and from pilferers; and last, but not least, the planter and merchant can here lay in his supplies of flour, meats and groceries, clothing, agricultural implements, bagging and ties, mules, and all other necessary articles at a far greater advantage than at any other cotton market.\"\n\nWool. — In setting forth the condition of the wool market in St. Louis, no clearer statement can be made than that embraced in the report of the Secretary of the Cotton Exchange, which says: \"In the Spring of 1885, efforts were made by the Cotton Exchange and parties interested largely in the wool business for the development of St. Louis as a wool market, and a committee was appointed to invite the National Wool Growers' Association to hold their next annual convention here, and the effort was successful and the convention was held here May 27th and 28th, and was presided over by Hon. Columbus Delano of Ohio, the President of the association, and attended by a large number of gentlemen interested in that great industry.\"\n\n\"Stimulated by the success of this meeting, the Association of Missouri Wool Growers appointed St. Louis as the place to hold their annual meeting, and in connection with the National Sheep Shearing Association held a very successful meeting from April 7th to 10th, (1886), which was an occasion of great interest, and gave universal satisfaction to the large number of the friends of the wool interest who attended. These meetings have had the effect intended, and St. Louis to-day is attracting the attention of the trade from all parts of the country, and has become the leading wool market of the West.\"\n\nThe total receipts of wool for 1886 were 18,563,614 pounds, and the shipments 17,825,630. This was somewhat less than the business for the previous year, in which, the wool clip was much larger, but with that exception is largely in excess of the annual aggregate of transactions in wool for the past eight years.\n\nHides, Furs, Etc. — When Laclede first located St. Louis, he chose it as the best place in which to carry on a trade in furs. This was the earliest industry of the city, and still remains an important one. The receipts of peltries and furs in 1886 amounted to 18,889 bundles, which is a larger number than any recorded in the Merchants' Exchange report for any previous year.\n\nThe hide business of St. Louis is of great importance, the volume of annual transactions in this line being very large. In 1886 the receipts amounted to 19,978,698 pounds, received from Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, Kansas, Arkansas and other States tributary to the St. Louis hide market. This amount was augmented by the slaughtering of cattle here to such an extent that, in addition to the large amount consumed by local tanneries, etc., there were shipped from this city, principally eastward, a total of 23,407,160 pounds.\n\n37\n\nSt. Louis steadily maintains her lead as a hide market, being favorably situated within easy reach of the centers of production, and having every facility for handling, shipping and warehousing. In addition to hides, St. Louis, during 1886, received 49,894 rolls of leather, most of which went into consumption by local factories of boots and shoes, saddlery, etc.\n\nLIVE STOCK.\n\nSeveral causes combined to make the receipts of live stock at the Union and National stock yards somewhat less in 1886 than in the preceding year, among which may be named the strike upon the railroads of the Southwest, which shut off the supply for nearly three months, and the severe drouth that prevailed so generally throughout the range country, which had a serious effect in materially reducing the runs of grass cattle.\n\nCattle. — The total receipts of cattle for 1886 amounted to 377,550 head, a falling off of 8,770 head as compared with the receipts of the preceding year. The shipments were 212,958 head, or 20,291 less than in 1885, this decrease, however, being largely due to the increase in the dressed beef industry at the National yards, which, while it reduced the comparative shipments of cattle on the hoof, assisted materially in keeping up values and making a ready market for cattle. On the whole the falling off in receipts was not serious, and was the result of exceptional causes not affecting the future of St. Louis as a live stock market.\n\nHogs. — The receipt of hogs for 1886 amounted to 1,264,471. This was a falling off of 191,064 head from the figures for the preceding year, but was largely due to a material shortage in the crop. The railroad strikes also diverted many thousands of hogs from this market. The shipments were 520,362, a decrease of 269,125 head from 1885, in which the shipments reached the largest figure since 1881. But while the shipments of hogs were decreased the demand from packers was heavier, and the provision trade was very prosperous, as will be seen by reference to the article on the subject elsewhere, and the summer packing season of 1886 consumed 125,996 more hogs than that of the previous year.\n\nSheep. — The receipts of sheep for the year amounted to 328,985 head, the falling off of 33,873 head from the figures for 1885 being due to the abandonment of the business of wool growing by many owing to the low prices that it obtained in that year. Prices for sheep averaged somewhat higher in 1886, and the demand of the dressed beef works for good, fat stock had a tendency to keep them up and make an active market. The shipments for the year amounted to 202,728 head.\n\nHorses and Mules. — St. Louis is the leading horse and mule market in America, and the trade shows a steady increase. During 1886 a total of 42,032 head were received by rail and river, but this fails to exhibit the total volume of this important trade, as vast numbers of horses and mules are raised within driving distance of the city, and are brought to market on the hoof. The government purchases of mules are made in this city, and buyers from all points make their headquarters here. The shipments to all points last year reached an aggregate of 39,798 head, an increase of 4,188 head over the figures for 1885. The situation of St. Louis is admirably adapted to the continuance and increase of its foremost position as a market for horses and mules. It is located in the center of the region of production of the largest and best animals in the country, and its rail and river routes give the city an unapproachable advantage as a point for their receipt, sale and distribution.\n\n38\n\nProduce. — As a market for the sale and shipment of all products of the soil. St. Louis is not surpassed by any city of the continent, and in all the leading articles coming under this head its receipts and shipments are very large. In dried fruits the receipts in sacks and barrels for 1886 were 99,567, and the shipments 114,979, an increase over the previous year of 3,505 sacks and barrels in receipts, and in shipments of 57,572 sacks and barrels. This is an industry for which St. Louis has unrivaled facilities and in which she is steadily gaining an increased trade.\n\nIn potatoes the ascertained receipts in bushels amounted to 812,950, and the shipments to 1,789,544 bushels. The large discrepany in the comparative amount of receipts and shipments is explained by the fact that fully one-half of the potatoes received in the market come by wagons, and that no account is taken of produce received in that way. The principal market for potatoes is found in the Southern States.\n\nThe receipts of onions in 1886 in sacks and barrels amounted to 33,732, and of bushels in bulk to 134,500. The shipments were 73,602 sacks and barrels.\n\nIn green apples the receipts were 240,934 barrels, and the shipments 191,299 barrels. Large quantities of apples are brought in by wagons, of which no data can be obtained. Large amounts are dried in the city and shipped in that form. The shipments are mostly Southward.\n\nIn dairy products the receipts of butter for the year 1886 were 8,605,230 lbs., and the shipments 2,557,238 lbs. Of cheese 128,882 boxes were received, and 99,883 boxes were shipped.\n\nOf white beans 45,420 sacks and barrels were received, an increase of 8,242 over the previous year, and 56,239 sacks and barrels were shipped. Of hay the receipts were 85,078 tons, and the shipments 30,006 tons. Of bran 110,763 sacks and 366 cars in bulk were received, and 767,856 sacks and 335 cars were shipped. Of buckwheat the receipts were 1,274 sacks, and of buckwheat flour 2,906 barrels. Hops were received to the amount of 8,834 bales; cranberries 5,728 barrels; oranges and lemons 103,812 boxes. Besides these articles a number of others amounting to a considerable trade, but of which no account is kept, were received and shipped in large quantities, such as feathers, peanuts, ginseng and other roots, etc.\n\nLeaf Tobacco. — St. Louis being the largest of all cities in the manufacture of tobacco, as will be seen by reference to the statistics given elsewhere in this work, her market for leaf tobacco is a very important one, about 75 percent, of the receipts going into manufacture here. Thus, in 1886 the receipts were 32,113 hhds. and the shipments 8,135 hhds. Of the amount received 15,715 hhds. were consigned to manufacturers direct, in addition to which 8,997 bhds. were delivered to manufacturers from warehouses. The receipt for 1886 were larger than in any previous year, being 632 hhds. more than in 1885, and larger by several thousands than in any year before that.\n\nCoal and Coke. — There is no surer way of gauging the growth of a city's population and manufactures, than by comparison of its receipts of coal. Tested by this standard, the showing made by St. Louis is very gratifying. Thus, the coal received in the city, including anthracite reduced to bushels, amounted in 1881 to 44,720,175 bushels; in 1882, 47,750,375 bushels; in 1883, 50,687,225 bushels; in 1884, 52,349,600 bushels; in 1885, 53,387,064 bushels, and in 1886 the receipts were 61,258,525 bushels, included in which were 70,000 tons of anthracite. In addition to this there were 5,463,950 bushels of coke received during the year. Thus it will be seen that there has been a steady gain, year by year, in the receipts of coal, indicating an increase of population and an expansion of productive activity in the line of manufactures.\n\n39\n\nLumber. — The situation of St. Louis is peculiarly adapted to fill, in an advantageous manner, the requisites of a prosperous lumber market. From the great white pine producing regions of Wisconsin and Minnesota, the upper Mississippi acts as a feeder to the St. Louis market, while from the south the lower Mississippi and its tributaries perform a similar service in supplying the diversified timber products of the extensive forests in that section. The railroad lines centering at St. Louis from timber paints in every direction, also bring a vast amount of lumber, and the aggregate receipts by all these various routes foot up an enormous total.\n\nThe railroad strikes in the early part of 1886 had a depressing effect on the lumber trade, but later in the year it recuperated, and the demands for building and railroad construction became active. Stocks were greatly reduced by a prolonged low water season and by a fire in one of the largest yards which destroyed about forty million feet in one day. The total receipts of white pine by the upper Mississippi river were 124,154,170 feet, and of cottonwood lumber by the same route, 3,925,500 feet, and by the lower Mississippi the receipts of poplar were 8,420,462 feet, and of other lumber 2,788,422 feet, including yellow pine, ash, oak, cyprus, gum, hickory, sycamore and walnut lumber, part of the latter coming from the Missouri River. The total amount of lumber of all kinds received by rail was 391,908,000 feet, swelling the total of receipts of lumber from all sources to 531,196,554 feet. To this must be added logs, received by river in rafts, the superficial measurement of which was 6,609,930 feet, equivalent to about 26,000,000 feet of board measure. In other lumber products the receipts were: Shingles, 55,136,000; lath, 37,254,000; pickets, 862,330.\n\nOTHER PRODUCTS.\n\nIn many other lines besides those above enumerated St. Louis is a leading market of receipt and distribution. In lead, one of the prominent articles in which St. Louis is a heavy handler, the receipts for 1886 exceeded those of any previous year except 1882, aggregating 1,138.854 pigs. The shipments were 561,544 pigs, the remainder being used in the manufacture of white lead, etc., of which mention is made elsewhere in this work.\n\nIn salt the receipts were 51,992 sacks, 400,358 barrels and 247,160 bushels in bulk and the shipments 11,658 sacks, 396,437 barrels, and 56,924 bushels in bulk, of which 14,948 sacks, 327,701 barrels and 45,360 bushels came from Michigan direct and the remainder from various points.\n\nThis city is a prominent market for flax seed, the receipts for 1886 being 5,578 sacks and 353,651 bushels and the shipments 3,165 sacks and 50,163 bushels. The difference between the receipts and shipments represents an important industry, the remainder being consumed in the mills. In cotton seed the receipts were 7,697 tons and of cotton seed meal 883 tons, and 6,179 tons of cotton seed meal were shipped. In grass and other seeds the receipts were 85,892 sacks.\n\nOther dealings in important articles were 81,612 packages of fish received; nails, 908,817 kegs received, 583,628 kegs shipped; oils, 139,814 barrels and 5,058 tanks received. In ores 164,199 tons of iron were received and 263,574 shipped; 32,425 tons of zinc arrived and the shipments amounted to 12,050 tons as well as 595,481 slabs of zinc and spelter. Other receipts were rosin, 33,742 barrels; railroad iron 193,069 tons; staves 5,095 cars and 460,000 pieces; tar and pitch 5,096 barrels; turpentine 18,912 barrels; tin 110,977 boxes.\n\n40\n\nTHE JOBBING TRADES.\n\nThe importance of St. Louis as a central source of supply for the entire Mississippi Valley and the great West is shown in an immense volume of transactions in all jobbing lines. The jobbers of St. Louis are prospering and steadily adding to their trade territory and the volume of their transactions. A brief review of the more important branches of mercantile industry carried on in this city will doubtless prove interesting.\n\nGroceries. — A recent writer estimates the volume of the sales of groceries in 1886 from this city at $75,000,000, an increase of $15,000,000 over the sales of 1885. Part of this increase was due to the general advance in prices which occurred in the latter part of the year. The early part of the year was marked by the occurrence of the great railroad strikes, which had a discouraging effect upon business in all lines, and in none more than in the grocery trade. In the last part of the year, however, a general revival was noticed in all lines of goods handled, which has been continued through the Winter and Spring, with every prospect that the present year will be the most prosperous for grocers in the history of the city.\n\nThere has been a notable extension of the trade territory of the city in the last few years, and Texas, Illinois, Missouri, Arkansas, Mississippi, Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado, Indian Territory, New Mexico and Arizona all deal largely with the grocers of St. Louis. The trade to Mexico is steadily increasing, and is especially heavy in canned goods of every description, and Iowa and Minnesota to the Northwest, and Georgia and Alabama to the Southeast also add to the volume of the business of the city.\n\nAs a coffee market St. Louis does a much larger business than any other interior city of the country, and probably of the world, the receipts of last year amounting to 240,685 bags, and the shipments to 205,135 bags. In sugar 32,887 hhds., 242,075 bbls., 792 boxes and 105,580 bags were received, and 771 hhds., 330,349 bbls., and 2,463 bags were shipped. In molasses the receipts were 27,720 bbls. and 3,281 kegs, and the shipments were 24,141 bbls. and 18,810 kegs. In rice 72,079 sacks and barrels were received and 41,571 packages were shipped. Of tea 43,518 packages were received during the year, In the year's shipments were 75,417 boxes of candles and 345,303 boxes of soap.\n\nIntimately connected with the grocery trade of the city are many establishments engaged in canning, the manufacture of vinegar, baking powders, soap and household preparations, which do a large and steadily increasing business, as well as a great many commission dealers who handle lines coming under the head of groceries.\n\nThere are about thirty large exclusively wholesale grocery houses in the city, none working on a less capital than $100,000 and many possessing several times that amount, besides a number of thrifty smaller concerns and dealers in special lines such as provisions, flour, etc. This market offers to purchasers of groceries advantages not equaled by any other in the West, in the large number of houses and the heavy and diversified stocks carried, the amount invested in the business in St. Louis being larger than in any other western city.\n\nDry Goods. — The vast territory covered by the jobbing house of St. Louis in the line of dry goods makes the demand upon its resources very heavy, but it is met by an investment of $15,000,000 in the business and annual sales amounting to about five times that figure. The past year, which began unpropitiously in this as in other lines, developed into the best ever known in the history of the trade in St. Louis.\n\n41\n\nThis activity has been more pronounced during the Spring season of the present year, which promises even better results than its predecessor.\n\nThe wholesalers of St. Louis have of late years made an aggressive fight for trade territory with competing cities with the result of a rapid extension of their business. In addition to the large trade from the West and Southwest, the South is yearly becoming a better customer for goods in this line, the rapid improvement going on in the Southern States tending to an increase in purchases.\n\nThe dry goods trade of St. Louis is steadily growing and country merchants who formerly bought their stocks in New York have abandoned that market, as the goods can be purchased to equal advantage in this city and a great saving in time and freight expenses is made. The houses engaged in the business in this city have ample capital and keep fully up with the times in the selection and assortment of their stocks, carrying full lines of all the latest novelties in fabrics as well as in staple goods.\n\nIn notions, millinery and other lines intimately related to the dry goods trade the city has a vast business and many houses with large resources are engaged in these branches of trade. In the number of houses engaged in the dry goods and kindred trades St. Louis is ahead of all western cities, and all are doing a prosperous business.\n\nHats and Caps. — In this department of trade St. Louis leads all western cities. Over $1,000,000 in capital is invested in the business and the annual transactions will aggregate in the neighborhood of $4,000,000. Larger and better stocks are carried in this city than in any other in the western country, and the aggressive methods of the merchants engaged in the line have secured for it the custom of an extensive business territory, and a trade that is expanding in volume with each successive year.\n\nHardware. — The business done by the hardware trade of St. Louis is very large, over $3,000,000 being invested, while the volume of annual transactions in the line is not less than $15,000,000. In the Southwestern States this city has almost a monopoly of the hardware business, its central location and facilities for distribution throughout this region giving it an advantage with which other markets are unable to compete. The establishments engaged in this line in St. Louis are for the most part large and well stocked. The hardware merchants of the city are very aggressive in their efforts to increase the trade of St. Louis in this branch of commercial enterprise, and have invaded territory claimed by competing centers and made it their own until this city now sells hardware north to the Lakes, west to the Pacific and south to the Gulf on both sides of the Mississippi, the Republic of Mexico also being a customer of growing importance.\n\nThis vast trade, won by St. Louis merchants in the face of strong competition, the city has every facility for retaining. A very large quantity of the goods pertaining to the line are manufactured here, the raw material being abundant in the immediate vicinity. The year 1886 marked a material increase in the hardware trade of the city, the volume of transactions for the year being fully 20 per cent. greater than in 1885. This prosperous state of things has been continued through the Winter and Spring seasons, and the prospects are favorable for the present year to prove better than any ever before experienced in this market. Intimately connected with this trade are a number of manufactures of iron, steel, etc., which are mentioned in a special manner elsewhere in this work.\n\nProvisions and Packing. — St. Louis occupies an important position as a packer and dealer in hog products, ranking third among the important packing points of the country. The total shipments for 1886 amounted to 174,907,899 lbs., which includes barrels of pork reduced to pounds, hams, meats and lard. The\n\n42\n\npacking of the season of 1885-6 was 300,130 hogs of average gross weight of 257.21 lbs. The summer packing of 1886 was 370,000 hogs averaging 245 lbs. gross, the largest packing, with one exception, ever done in the summer season in this city. In detail the receipts of hog products for the year were pork, 6,667 bbls.; hams, 4,564,875 lbs.; meats, 62,288,459 lbs.; lard, 11,924,131 lbs., and the shipments 46,816 bbls. pork; 35,748,854 lbs. hams; 81,553,875 lbs. meats, and 48,710,130 lbs. lard.
