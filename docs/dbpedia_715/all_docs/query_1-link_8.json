I'm accepting this Oscar in the name of Edward Selzer for the best cartoon of the year called \"Birds Anonymous.\" And I want to pay my tribute to Friz Freleng, the director of the picture; Warren Foster, the story man; and about a hundred wonderful, talented people at Warner Bros. Cartoons. Thank you.\n\n[Ed. note: Winner envelopes for the short film categories were mistakenly switched between the presenters. Live Action Short Subject was announced first with Jennifer Jones reading the nominees and Rock Hudson announcing the winner, but the information in his envelope was for the Cartoon Short Subject category, which he read. After the acceptance speech for Cartoon Short Subject was given, Rock Hudson then read the nominees for Cartoon Short Subject and Jennifer Jones opened up her envelope and announced the winner in the Live Action Short Subject category.]"
