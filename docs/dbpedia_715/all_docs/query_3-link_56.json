The name and part of the story is a direct parody of Robinson Crusoe.\n\nDirected by Friz Freleng. Produced by Edward Selzer. (uncredited) Story by Warren Foster.\n\nYosemite Sam\n\n[edit]\n\n[narrating, from his journal] A low tide and a high rock caused my predicament. The ship's supplies used up, my only food supply was a lowly coconut tree. Gatherin' coconuts was a problem, 'cause of a dangerous, man-eatin' shark named Dopey Dick.\n\n[whacking Dopey Dick with a hammer] Back! Back! Back! Down, ya shark-livered varmint! [Dopey Dick retreats to the water] Danged ol' fin-flappin' flounder.\n\n[after outsmarting Dopey Dick once again] Twenty years tryin' and ya missed me again! Ya shovel-nosed mackerel! No-good bushwhackin' barracuda!\n\nHuh! Missed again, ya hammerhead halibut!\n\n[fighting and whacking Dopey Dick with a bat] Down! Down! Down, ya shark-toothed salmon!\n\nDialogue\n\n[edit]\n\nBugs Bunny: What's the big idea? What's up, Doc?\n\nYosemite Sam: I'm gonna make rabbit stew!\n\nBugs Bunny: Rabbit Stew? Mmm, sounds good. But, uh, where are you gonna get the rabbit?\n\nYosemite Sam: We've already got the rabbit. Get the idea? [laughs]\n\nBugs Bunny: Yeah, I get the idea. [laughs nervously] How long will it be before dinner's ready?\n\nYosemite Sam: Just a few minutes, barrin' accidents.\n\nBugs Bunny: [drops water onto the flames, extinguishing them] Whoops, foist accident.\n\nYosemite Sam: Ooh, ya stupid idjit rabbit! Don't ya know matches is scarce on this island?! Now I gotta go all the way to the ship to get another match!\n\nVoice cast\n\n[edit]\n\nMel Blanc as Bugs Bunny / Yosemite Sam / Dopey Dick.\n\nWikipedia has an article about:"
