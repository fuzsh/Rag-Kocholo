        "text": "Feed the Kitty, directed by Chuck M. Jones (also, he designed the characters), gave us the first appearances of bulldog Marc Antony and Pussyfoot the kitten; 3 follow ups were made: Kiss Me Cat, 1953; Feline Frame-Up, 1954, and in 1958, Cat Feud. This truly is a funny animated short (7 minutes long) film, and heart-touching, with a message of tolerance; Jones and company did themselves proud.The animation chores fell to: Ken Harris, Phil Monroe, Lloyd Vaughan and Ben Washam. The story was written by Michael Maltese, Carl W. Stalling composed the music and filled the duties of musical director, Milt Franklyn was musical-orchestrator while Treg Brown was the film and sound effects editor. Kitty was produced by Edward Selzer, voices by Mel Blanc and Bea Benaderet provided the voice of Marc Antony’s Mistress. As with most animated shorts the film was ready well in advance of its planned (Marc-ed day) release date (ready to knead the back of the public), the copyright was filed for in 1951; for a cartoon, Feed the Kitty was well represented in advertising.\n\nThank you Warner Bros., Merrie Melodies and Chuck Jones for another great cartoon, and for adding more wonderful thoughts and pictures to our mind’s memory bank. If you need a full refresher (or just for the cookie baking scene; a true classic), watch Feed the Kitty again.\n\nCel Notes:\n\nIf you have a very good memory of Monsters, Inc. from 2001 (or the DVD at hand), then you will see that the reactions by Sully when he thinks that Boo is in the garbage compactor, shot for shot duplicates Marc Anthony’s reactions, when he thinks that Pussyfoot is being made into cookies.\n\nBy the way if you thought that Chuck Jones being a Square-Dance enthusiast was just rumors, or a simple hobby interest, think again…\n\nBehind the Scenes:\n\n.\n\nBy C. S. Williams"
