        "text": "Things were not looking good for Disney at this point. It was bad enough that they had to scale down from their \"true\" feature films to package films in order to make ends meet - that alone would have been a blow to Walt's pride as a filmmaker, sure, but his entrepreneur side said that this had to be done in order to make sure the studio survived during the war, and he could've at least taken comfort in knowing that, package or not, his studio was the only one that was still actually producing animated features... except that wasn't the case at all.\n\nWalter Lantz and his studio had released their own venture into the animated film market, Aladdin and His Lamp, in 1944 to much acclaim and financial success, no doubt helped by the established star power of its leading actors - Abbott and Costello. With the duo providing their comedic touch to the Arabian Nights tale, the film proved that pure comedies were just as viable a genre for animated features as the dramedies that Disney and the-studio-formerly-known-as-Fleischer had produced. Speaking of the latter, Famous Studios decided to conclude their run on the Superman series with a bang, or rather, a feature film - Superman premiered in the summer of 1945 and would feature the Man of Steel taking the Axis Powers head-on (and winning, of course), no doubt resonating with Americans who were certain that the Allies' victory over the Axis Powers in World War II was near (and indeed it was - not long after this movie dropped, Japan would officially surrender to the United States, bringing the Second World War to a close).\n\nTo make matters worse, neither of these movies were a package deal, making Disney's The Three Caballeros look pathetic in comparison (though it still managed to break even, for all that's worth). Thus, Disney had to make a choice: either continue with the financially secure but artistically lacking package films or take a gamble by producing another full-length animated feature. Walt decided to split the difference - though the studio's next feature in 1946, Make Mine Music, would be a package feature, the one following it, Mickey and the Beanstalk in 1947, would be a true feature film (as suggested by the title, it'd be a spin on Jack and the Beanstalk featuring the iconic Disney trio of Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, and Goofy), with Walt himself taking over as director to ensure its success. This calculated risk ends up paying off, with both movies turning a profit at the box office and setting Disney back on the path to success... for now, anyway.\n\nMeanwhile with MGM, Tom and Jerry have been on a hot streak with Academy Award wins, managing to claim the 17th and 18th Best Animated Short Subject awards for the cartoons Mouse Trouble and Quiet, Please!, respectively. This was bad news for Warner Bros. Animation - since they currently didn't have any animated features in the works, they had to rely on the acclaim of their short subjects - and if they kept falling short at the most renowned film award ceremony in America, what does that say about them? Things came to a head with MGM at the 19th Academy Awards, where both studios submitted shorts with very similar premises - one of their film's stars trying to perform Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 in front of a live audience, only to be constantly impeded by a troublemaking mouse residing within the piano they were using (The Cat Concerto featuring Tom and Jerry for MGM, Rhapsody Rabbit featuring Bugs Bunny and an unnamed mouse for Warner Bros.) - naturally, both studios were quick to accuse each other of plagiarism. Much to the dismay of Warner Bros., the Academy Award committee ruled in favor of MGM, and The Cat Concerto would go on to net the cat-and-mouse duo their fourth Academy Award in a row (naturally beating out the short that Warner Bros. did manage to get nominated, Walky Talky Hawky, in the process). The staff at Termite Terrace needed something that could beat MGM, and they needed it soon.\n\nEnter veteran animation director Isadore \"Friz\" Freleng. Already renowned at Warner Bros. for his creation of Porky Pig (the studio's 3rd mascot, and a mainstay of the Looney Tunes cast even well after Bugs Bunny had supplanted him in the mascot role), Freleng would end up being the one to come up with the solution to halting Tom and Jerry's winning streak - namely, by using their own chase formula, but with a Warner Bros. spin. To that end, he employed the Tweety character created by Bob Clampett (who had left Warner Bros. in 1945, with animator Art Davis taking over his unit - though, enough of Clampett's finished cartoon storyboards were left over that the last Warner Bros. cartoon he directed, The Big Sleep, aired late into 1946), but with some changes - not only did Tweety now have a full coat of yellow feathers rather than a lack thereof, but he also lost most of the overt maliciousness (key word being overt) that the Clampett version of the character had. This wasn't the only time Freleng edged a Looney Tunes mainstay toward a more heroic (or at least sympathetic) position - in the 1945 short Hare Trigger he introduced the short-tempered (and short-statured) outlaw Yosemite Sam as a more antagonistic replacement to the dopey Elmer Fudd as Bugs Bunny's main recurring adversary, having felt that Bugs came off as too unsympathetic when squaring off against the relatively harmless Elmer.\n\nFor the Tom analogue, Freleng went with another character that he introduced in 1945 - a neurotic black-and-white cat with a red nose and a noticeable lisp, introduced in the short Life With Feathers. In the first short pairing him with Tweety, he was even named Thomas - though, likely realizing that keeping that name would've made the copying/riffing of the Tom and Jerry formula too obvious, Freleng would quickly settle on the permanent name of Sylvester for the cat. It should be noted that, while his conflicts with Tweety would be the most notable use of the character, Sylvester would quickly prove to be one of the most versatile members of the Looney Tunes cast, with him filling a variety of roles (both as protagonist and antagonist) throughout his tenure in the Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies theatrical shorts, with each of the major directors at Termite Terrace having used him at least once (even Clampett prior to his departure, in the 1946 short Kitty Kornered alongside Porky Pig). To give an example, here are two of Sylvester's most notable non-Tweety outings from 1948: Back Alley Op-Roar (directed by Friz Freleng), in which he annoys a sleeping Elmer Fudd with a fence-top concerto, and Scaredy Cat (directed by Chuck Jones), in which he protects a hapless Porky Pig from a cult of murderous mice.\n\nOn May 3rd, 1947, the first Sylvester and Tweety cartoon (and the fourth overall appearance for both characters), Tweety Pie, was premiered.\n\nOn March 20th, 1948, at the 20th Academy Awards ceremony, that same cartoon was awarded the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Subject, beating out Tom and Jerry's entry for that year (Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Mouse) and ending the cat-and-mouse duo's winning streak.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe've got another multiple-years-in-one situation here, folks. I do worry that I may be going a bit too fast - I'm trying to skim past parts where there aren't any divergences (if I don't mention something, then it's most likely the same as OTL) or that don't play a part in the Warner Bros. vs. MGM narrative (and even then, I've mainly restricted myself to their animated output so far). I also wonder if maybe it was a mistake to sort these entries by year; I was trying to emulate King Krazy's timeline, but while he covered every major debut and event in American movies (both animated and live-action), TV shows (same), comics, and (as of his most recent entries) video games, I'm primarily focusing on the major events that connect to my timeline's narrative, including any divergences that are important enough to facilitate those events. Though, even if I do decide to stop directly sorting the entries by year, they'll still be in roughly chronological order (though I will backtrack to previous years if I need to cover information that I'd previously skimmed over).\n\nJust to clarify, the Superman shorts created by Fleischer/Famous still end at about the same time they do IOTL (possibly a bit later, with about 3-5 more shorts), but ITTL it's because they've decided to switch gears from just short subjects to a full-on feature film, and relocated the budget planned for the next batch of Superman shorts toward the film instead.\n\nDisney's Song of the South is butterflied ITTL... at least as an individual movie. They instead do a series of animated shorts based on the tales of Brer Rabbit.\n\nOh, and Terrytoons still exists. That's literally all I've got to say about them... for now, at least.\n\nUp next, Chuck Jones finally reaches the point in his career where he doesn't want to burn the negatives of the animated shorts he's created! And he's about to show the world exactly what he thinks of the chase cartoon formula that Tom and Jerry popularized...\n\nWith the United States now fully involved in World War II, it was naturally expected that their animated characters would follow suit. Thus, new cartoons were produced featuring the likes of Popeye, Donald Duck, and Bugs Bunny duking it out with the Axis Powers.\n\nThe top talent at Termite Terrace would be tasked with turning out training films for the troops. Thus was born the Private Snafu (acronym for Situation Normal, All Fouled Up) series of cartoons, in which the titular private demonstrates what not to do when serving in the U.S. military (often getting killed as a result of his ineptitude). Not that their main brand of Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies produced during this time were anything to sneeze at, either - in particular, director Charles \"Chuck\" Jones had finally joined the rest of his colleagues in breaking away from the Disney style of directing cartoons and had brought his own innovations to the wacky cartoon world at Warner Bros. with cartoons such as The Draft Horse and The Dover Boys at Pimento University. Meanwhile, Bob Clampett brought his A-game to the table during this time, with his most notable contribution being the introduction of Tweety in the cartoon A Tale of Two Kitties. This seemingly harmless little bird would go on to not only have the most longevity out of all the Looney Tunes characters created by Clampett, but also play a key role in Warner Bros. securing a major victory over MGM a few years down the line.\n\nSpeaking of MGM, Tex Avery had come in swinging with the Academy Award-nominated short The Blitz Wolf, a World War II propaganda take on the tale of The Three Little Pigs. It wouldn't even be his most notable spin on a classic fairy tale at MGM - that honor would go to 1943's Red Hot Riding Hood, a Hollywood-style sendup of Little Red Riding Hood that featured Red herself as an attractive nightclub singer. The wolf character from both shorts would go on to serve a number of antagonistic roles in several of Avery's MGM cartoons, often being paired up against another of Avery's recurring MGM characters - a melancholic yet incredibly competent basset hound by the name of Droopy (introduced in the 1943 short Dumb-Hounded). Between these and several other successful cartoons down the line, it was clear that MGM's decision to hire Avery was paying off - which was fortunate, as another of the studio's veteran animators, Rudolf Ising, would leave the company after being drafted to fight in the war.\n\nBill Hanna and Joe Barbera, meanwhile, were continuing to refine the Tom and Jerry formula, producing several of their most noteworthy shorts during this period - one of which, The Yankee Doodle Mouse, would net the first of many Academy Awards for the cat-and-mouse duo. Though, much to the frustration of Bill and Joe, they wouldn’t be the ones to claim those awards - that honor was given to the producer of the cartoons, in this case Fred Quimby, who to add insult to injury would not even thank or credit the duo for their work when accepting the awards.\n\nDisney is… well, surviving, at least. The war had already more-or-less closed off overseas market for his feature films even before the US got fully involved in it (a major factor in his 1940 pictures bombing at the box office), and now that the US was involved it was bleeding them domestically as well, as evidenced by his next feature (an adaptation of Felix Stalen’s novel Bambi, regarded by Walt as his personal favorite of the films his studio had produced) being another financial failure despite positive critical reception. The studio was able to make ends meet despite the employee exodus and film financial failures by producing wartime propaganda pictures (one of which, Der Fuehrer's Face, managed to claim another Academy Award for Best Animated Short Subject for Disney - their last one for a long while) and “package” feature films that showcased a selection of animated shorts connected via a framing device. The first of these efforts, the 1943 film Saludos Amigos, was originally intended as a series of 12 shorts meant to promote goodwill between the US and South America, but four of those shorts were instead linked with live-action footage from Disney’s own goodwill tour to South America (both real and faked) to form the “movie” because Disney felt that it’d be more marketable that way (four more of these shorts would be subject to a similar approach for the studio's next package feature, The Three Caballeros, in 1945).\n\nFleischer Studios seems to be doing alright on the surface - the Superman cartoons are still astounding audiences with their impressive animation, while Popeye adapted quite well into the wartime propaganda pictures as a member of the US Navy, a position that he would maintain for the remainder of his theatrical cartoon tenure. Behind the scenes, though, things were far from smooth sailing, as the Fleischer brothers were at odds with each other over, among other issues, what direction they wanted the studio's creative efforts to go in (Dave was particularly livid about Max's desire to end the Popeye series after the license from King Features ran out, despite Popeye being the studio's primary moneymaker). This would culminate in Dave Fleischer resigning from the studio in 1942 to sign a deal with Columbia Pictures to make cartoons for their animation unit Screen Gems, leaving his brother Max with his stake in the studio. Paramount, who'd been hoping to claim full control over Fleischer Studios, saw this as their moment to strike, and tried to pressure Max into resigning, even using his son-in-law Seymour Kneitel's position as creative head of the studio in an attempt to blackmail him. Eventually in the summer of 1943, an agreement was reached - the studio would become a full subsidiary of Paramount, but Max would retain creative control over the studio's output (the exception being that Paramount would decide whether or not to renew their licensed properties - which, unsurprisingly, they already did in the case of Popeye), and none of the staff would be fired (for now). To cement this shift in control over the studio, both parties agreed to a rebrand - and thus, what was once Fleischer Studios became Famous Studios.\n\nLastly, there’s one other animation studio that’s flown under the radar so far - Walter Lantz Studios (named after the founding animation director), at the service of Universal Productions. Lantz had recently found success back in 1941 (if not to the same extent as his contemporaries) with the studio's latest star - the screwball Woody Woodpecker, who quickly displaced the studio's former mascot Andy Panda. Yet now that Disney and Fleischer had proven that animated films were a viable source of revenue and were in a turbulent period that left them vulnerable, Lantz felt that the time was right to make his own move in the animated feature film business. And he had just the right idea in mind for his feature debut - a comedic take on the story of Aladdin, featuring the famous comedic duo Bud Abbott and Lou Costello.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nI decided to cover 1942 and 1943 together because there really isn't anything that's too radically different ITTL in the field of animation in either of these years, and the major events from OTL in the field of animation that happened in those years tend to bleed into one another (hence why I also decided to address The Three Caballeros here, as it was part of the same \"animated shorts turned package film to increase marketability\" deal that Saludos Amigos was). The major divergence so far is that Paramount's absorption of Fleischer Studios (and subsequent rebrand into Famous Studios) happens under slightly different circumstances - namely, Dave leaves the studio immediately after signing a deal to make cartoons at Columbia rather than trying to work at both studios behind Paramount’s back, while Max and many of the other Fleischer employees who were fired IOTL during the rebrand get to stay on board provided that they agree with said rebrand. Also, it happens a year later than OTL. If anyone has some IRL facts about the history behind the Fleischer-to-Famous rebrand that would complicate or contradict my take on the events (keeping in mind the divergences already made regarding the success of Gulliver and Mr. Bug ITTL), I'd be happy to revise them in turn!\n\nNext up, Walter Lantz steps up to the plate with his Abbott and Costello animated feature. Will it be a home run, or will Lantz strike out? I don't know! (\"Third base!\")\n\nI wish the best for them.\n\nMore ideas:\n\nScreen Gems could take over the Popeye license and become King Feature’s new animation partner.\n\nParamount can continue to make cartoons based on DC Superheroes.\n\nScreen Gems could revive Scrappy after seeing the success of Little Audrey at Paramount.\n\nRight.\n\nIt's the Aladdin feature alright. Although I haven't decided if Lantz will release it during or after the war (the latter option would probably be more profitable, but if Lantz releases it in 1944, he won't face competition from other animated films). I might also have Fleischer (now Famous) Studios do another animated feature within the 1944-1946 timeframe - I've noticed that them doing a Superman movie is a notably recurrent idea, but I also haven't decided if their Superman cartoons are ceased after 1943 like IOTL or if they'll go on for a while longer (regardless, I do already have plans in place for Paramount to drop the Superman license before the 1950s).\n\nAlso, given that neither of these two films will be package deals, I'm not sure how Disney's upcoming package feature will fare at the box office ITTL. Will it be another box-office flop for the company, or will it at least manage to break even? Maybe it'll even be the success that they're looking for?\n\nAs for Screwy, he'll still meet the same fate in his short theatrical run as IOTL, but he will make a comeback of some kind in the 90s. What kind of comeback that'll be, I haven't fully decided on yet.\n\nCool, but I think it would be a LOT more beneficial if Paramount was to just acquire DC Comics.\n\nThings were not looking good for Disney at this point. It was bad enough that they had to scale down from their \"true\" feature films to package films in order to make ends meet - that alone would have been a blow to Walt's pride as a filmmaker, sure, but his entrepreneur side said that this had to be done in order to make sure the studio survived during the war, and he could've at least taken comfort in knowing that, package or not, his studio was the only one that was still actually producing animated features... except that wasn't the case at all.\n\nOuch...\n\nWalter Lantz and his studio had released their own venture into the animated film market, Aladdin and His Lamp, in 1944 to much acclaim and financial success, no doubt helped by the established star power of its leading actors - Abbott and Costello.

Also, how good and successful would the Superman movie be?\n\nTo make matters worse, neither of these movies were a package deal, making Disney's The Three Caballeros look pathetic in comparison (though it still managed to break even, for all that's worth). Thus, Disney had to make a choice: either continue with the financially secure but artistically lacking package films or take a gamble by producing another full-length animated feature. Walt decided to split the difference - though the studio's next feature in 1946, Make Mine Music, would be a package feature, the one following it, Mickey and the Beanstalk in 1947, would be a true feature film (as suggested by the title, it'd be a spin on Jack and the Beanstalk featuring the iconic Disney trio of Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, and Goofy), with Walt himself taking over as director to ensure its success. This calculated risk ends up paying off, with both movies turning a profit at the box office and setting Disney back on the path to success... for now, anyway.\n\nDamn...\n\nMeanwhile with MGM, Tom and Jerry have been on a hot streak with Academy Award wins, managing to claim the 17th and 18th Best Animated Short Subject awards for the cartoons Mouse Trouble and Quiet, Please!, respectively.

It should be noted that, while his conflicts with Tweety would be the most notable use of the character, Sylvester would quickly prove to be one of the most versatile members of the Looney Tunes cast, with him filling a variety of roles (both as protagonist and antagonist) throughout his tenure in the Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies theatrical shorts, with each of the major directors at Termite Terrace having used him at least once (even Clampett prior to his departure, in the 1946 short Kitty Kornered alongside Porky Pig). To give an example, here are two of Sylvester's most notable non-Tweety outings from 1948: Back Alley Op-Roar (directed by Friz Freleng), in which he annoys a sleeping Elmer Fudd with a fence-top concerto, and Scaredy Cat (directed by Chuck Jones), in which he protects a hapless Porky Pig from a cult of murderous mice.\n\nOn May 3rd, 1947, the first Sylvester and Tweety cartoon (and the fourth overall appearance for both characters), Tweety Pie, was premiered.\n\nOn March 20th, 1948, at the 20th Academy Awards ceremony, that same cartoon was awarded the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Subject, beating out Tom and Jerry's entry for that year (Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Mouse) and ending the cat-and-mouse duo's winning streak.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe've got another multiple-years-in-one situation here, folks.

Come the 60s, though, another film studio will obtain the license for all of DC's comic characters (and DC Comics as a whole, for that matter), and they're going to make the most of it (Paramount/Famous Studios will also have a comic publisher that they'll merge with - if you know the animation history behind the characters involved, you should be able to figure it out).\n\nOh. Will they get King Features and Harvey Comics?\n\nAlso, is there a DM for this story I can join?\n\nYes."
