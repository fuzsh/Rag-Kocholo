        "text": "Plot\n\nOpening with the newspaper headlines \"Scientists to Launch First Rocket to Moon\" and \"Heroic Rabbit Volunteers as First Passenger\" the scene changes to Bugs literally being dragged on to the launching pad as he frenetically protests, but becomes cooperative when he sees the rocket being loaded with carrots. The rocket then launches off into space. Shocked by the sudden acceleration of the rocket, Bugs attempts to exit it, but when he opens the hatch, he sees that the rocket has already left Earth. When he lands on the moon he goes to pieces, but regains his composure. He realizes that he is the first living creature to set foot on the moon, overlooking a large rock with the words \"Kilroy was here\" on it. Another rocket soon lands called the Mars to Moon Expeditionary Force from planet Mars, and from it emerges an unnamed Martian (later known as Marvin the Martian) set to blow up planet Earth using a Uranium PU-36 Explosive Space Modulator, a small device which resembles a mere stick of dynamite. Bugs is initially curious until he realizes the severity of the situation and steals the Uranium PU-36 but soon has to deal with Marvin's Martian dog, named K-9, who retrieves it while Bugs is distracted attempting to send an SOS to Earth. In one of Bugs Bunny's classic word switcharoos, he successfully gets the Uranium PU-36 Explosive Space Modulator back.\n\nThis prompts an angry Marvin to berate and scold his dog. Bugs quickly arrives disguised as a Martian with a \"special delivery from Mars\" and hands Marvin the Uranium PU-36 Explosive Space Modulator now wired to a detonator. While Marvin is celebrating the return of the Uranium PU-36, Bugs activates the detonator, blowing up the moon in the process, reducing it to a crescent. Bugs hangs precariously from the edge of the moon, with Marvin and the dog holding on to him. Earth contacts Bugs Bunny, asking for a statement to the press. Bugs yells out (in his typical Brooklyn accent), \"Get me outta here!\"\n\nProduction\n\nThe cartoon was directed by Chuck Jones and written by long-time accomplice Michael Maltese. It was animated by Ben Washam, Lloyd Vaughan, Ken Harris and Phil Monroe, with effects animation by A.C. Gamer. The music was scored by Carl Stalling and the backgrounds painted by Peter Alvarado, with layouts by Robert Gribbroek. In retrospect, Chuck Jones considered this one of his animated shorts which managed to \"turn the corner\" towards strange, new, and enchanting directions. In this case, because it was the first in the series to be set in outer space, the first appearance of Marvin the Martian, and the first appearance of his Illudium Q-36 Space Modulator.\n\nAvailability"
