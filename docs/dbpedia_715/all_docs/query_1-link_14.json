        "text": "Actually, I can't really defend Eddie Selzer because I know very little about him. But that's the thing -- not much is known about Eddie Selzer (producer of WB cartoons from the mid '40s to the mid '50s), and what little is known about him comes from Chuck Jones, who mocked and belittled Selzer in his autobiographies.\n\nObviously, Selzer was not a creative person; he had no role at the cartoon company other than producer stuff -- making sure the cartoons came in on time and on budget. But I strongly suspect that Jones was unfair to the guy, portraying him as some sort of detestable tyrant when my impression is that he was probably just a run-of-the-mill company man who did the job he was assigned to do. I've never heard a story about Selzer that makes him out to be as annoying as, say, Fred Quimby at MGM (and Selzer didn't have himself credited on the cartoons themselves, as Quimby did).\n\nThe most famous story about Selzer, the \"Bully For Bugs\" story, actually presents him in a surprisingly good light. First, he comes in fuming about all the bullfight cartoons the studios had been turning out recently (i.e. \"Senor Droopy,\" that Goofy cartoon where he was a bullfighter, etc), and saying \"I don't want another cartoon about bullfighters, bullfights aren't funny.\" This actually suggests that Selzer was bothering to follow the output of other cartoon studios (because he apparently recognized that there had been a stream of bullfight cartoons recently) and that the bullfighting-cartoon genre had been done to death. Then Jones and Maltese decide to see if they can breathe some life into this tired storyline, and they do it -- and the cartoon makes it to the screen even though the producer had just said he doesn't want any bullfight cartoons. Doesn't this suggest that Selzer knew enough to know that he wasn't a creative person and shouldn't interfere with the animators' choices of stories, even if he personally didn't like them?\n\nWell, maybe I'm giving him too much credit, but honestly, my impression of Selzer is of a guy who had a tough job -- being a go-between between Warner Bros. and a cartoon unit that had been semi-independent (remember, Leon Schlesinger sort of set up the cartoon division separately, distributing through Warners) -- and kept it going strong for ten years, until the big mid-'50s layoff (did Selzer come back after that? I don't think so). I don't see the problem, frankly.\n\nOh, and Selzer's name does turn up on signs in a few cartoons (i.e. \"Edoaro Selzeri, Michele Maltese, Carlo Jonzi\" in \"Rabbit of Seville\"). I would tend to think he couldn't have been that detested if the animators sometimes included his name on a sign with their own, but maybe I'm reading too much into that.\n\nJones wasn't the only one with stories of a clueless and meddling Selzer...\n\nMcKimson once said that Selzer didn't like the Tazmanian Devil character and told McKimson not to direct anymore cartoons starring the marsupial after his debut cartoon had already reached theaters. McKimson claimed that it was Jack Warner who liked the character and wanted McKimson to direct more cartoons featuring it. Thus, the Tazmanian Devil lived on after his debut.\n\nFriz Freleng also stated that Selzer didn't want Freleng to team up Sylvester with Tweety, instead he wanted him to star with the woodpecker from Peck Up Your Troubles in his next cartoon. Freleng supposedly told Selzer if he knew so much about making cartoons then he should direct it and handed him his pencil and walked out of the studio. That night Freleng got a call at home from Selzer who relented and let Frelelng direct the cartoon the way he wanted to.\n\nI agree, though, that Jones probably did tell some apocryphal stories about Selzer.\n\nI agree, you'd probably do better defending Schlesinger than you would selzer. The idea I get from reading books about WB cartoons is that Jones disliked both of them, but on the whole Schlesinger was easier to tolerate because he left the animators alone. Jones seemed to really resent, and rightfully so, Edward Selzer coming in and giving criticism, constructive or not. Judging by the McKimson, Jones and Freleng incidents (see posts above) Selzer was deficient in the sense of humor department but still wanted to run things his way. There's a funny account in Jones' \"Chuck Reducks\" book about Selzer coming into a story session for \"Fast and Furry-Ous\", and fussing about how they misspelled \"furious\", not getting the pun at all.\n\nLeon Schlesinger was a producer, he owned the studio in the beginning. He was not a creative talent and he knew that, so he hired the best folks he could find and left them alone. And apparently he was no saint by any means, judging by Jones' opinions of him, though those are a little harsh. He was a force to be reckoned with. Still, you don't hear stories of an individual cartoon being interfered with creatively by Leon. He'd let them finish a film, and then he'd critique the finished product in a screening room right alongside the whole staff. In fact, the camera and equipment operator at the studio was a guy named Smokey Garner...if you didn't realize that, remember the name and then watch \"What's Cookin', Doc?\".\n\n-Matthew\n\nRe: Oh, Bull!\n\nOriginally posted by Jaime_Weinman\n\n[...]The most famous story about Selzer, the \"Bully For Bugs\" story, actually presents him in a surprisingly good light. First, he comes in fuming about all the bullfight cartoons the studios had been turning out recently (i.e. \"Senor Droopy,\" that Goofy cartoon where he was a bullfighter, etc), and saying \"I don't want another cartoon about bullfighters, bullfights aren't funny.\" This actually suggests that Selzer was bothering to follow the output of other cartoon studios (because he apparently recognized that there had been a stream of bullfight cartoons recently) and that the bullfighting-cartoon genre had been done to death. Then Jones and Maltese decide to see if they can breathe some life into this tired storyline, and they do it -- and the cartoon makes it to the screen even though the producer had just said he doesn't want any bullfight cartoons. [...]\n\nOr, perhaps Selzer also had a hunch about what would soon become of that hapless co-starring bull after he was whupped by ... let's see ... Bugs, Droopy, Popeye, Goofy, Woody, and Heckle & Jeckle (how many others did I miss? never mind!), then found himself obsolete in the one role he played best. Geezil's Bull Story 101 (IIRC): His next stop was back at Famous Studios, where for a good number of years, he could always count on being the target of a painful cameo and punchline (wherever and whenever the gag called for \"Ye Real Bull's-Eye!\" or some such). Finally, when even that schtick was drained dry in the classic Famous way, our hornmeister wearily wended his way upstate to the Terrytoons plant, for his final bow in a one-time 1957 starring role as \"Beefy.\" After that (heavy sigh) ... well ... don't tell me you never heard about the Great New Rochelle Roast Beef Disaster of 1958?!?!!?? Class dismissed.\n\nHey, even though they shot one in the eye with an arrow, Famous wasn't totally bearish about its bulls -- the co-star of 1956's \"Pedro and Lorenzo\" made out OK, even if it was weird to see Famous trying to do some sort of Silly Sympohnies-Color Classic-Happy Harmonies-UPA Bobe Cannon type thing that was decidedly not what Paramount was used to churning out.\n\nThey get points for going against type, anyway, though when this used to play repeatedly in TV in the Harveytoons package, the slow pace and gentile tone usually left me bull-dozing.\n\n(And getting this back to Seltzer, if you look though the Warner's library, the only bullfighting cartoon done before Chuck's \"Bully For Bugs\" that Eddie would have been the producer on is Art Davis' \"Mexican Joyride.\" If that's what made him hate bullfighting plotlines, then he really was a bad judge of comedy, because that was a great Daffy cartoon.\n\nI think Eddie may have had some earlier bad reaction to a bowl of borscht and the short brought back bad memories. That's why he hated bullfighting cartoons...)"
