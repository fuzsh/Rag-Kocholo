Park Bakery will be hosting the event in Seaside Park on Saturday and Sunday 7 am-2 pm.\n\nA recent Park Bakery Facebook post states:\n\nThis weekend!! Join us for a frightfully fun weekend at Park Bakery’s first-ever Halloween event! Get your cameras ready for some fantastic Halloween-themed photo ops and a host of spooky activities at our Seaside Spooktacular. Come say “trick or treat”, receive a FREE gift (costumes optional), and enjoy our free craft table for kids of all ages. Scooby Doo will also be making an appearance, and get your photo with the Mystery Machine!\n\nDon’t miss out on this eerie-sistible event that’s perfect for the whole family! This will also be our last event of the season, so you won’t want to miss this!\n\nAbout Park Bakery\n\nThe Park Bakery is located at 408 South East Central Avenue in Seaside Park. It opens every May and stays open weekends through the beginning of Summer, after which it is open daily. Besides the Seaside Spooktacular, the Park Bakery is famous for other themed events, such as Christmas In July, Splash Into Summer, Autograph signings by famous television starts like The Munsters Butch Patrick, and appearances of famous television cars, like the Scooby-Doo Mystery Machine, The Flintstones car, the Back To The Future Delorean, The Munsters’ Dragula and more! Besides that, Park Bakery makes some of the freshest, tastiest 100 percent homemade baked goods around, including crumb cake and doughnuts.\n\nThe Seaside Spooktacular is this Saturday and Sunday, August 10th and 11th from 7 am until 2 pm, and the event is free and open to the public, so don’t forget to bring your phones and cameras!\n\nMeanwhile, if you are a sucker for baked goods, especially doughnuts check out my story on the new Krispy Kreme coming to Ocean County here.\n\nBelieve it or not, Jimmy’s first job was overnights at a Christian Radio Station. He claims he got into radio because like Rocky Balboa once said, “cause I can’t sing or dance.” Jimmy loves to write about all local happenings, especially around his town of Toms River. Favorite Pastime (other than masturbation, of course): Cheering for the Yankees, and crying for the J-E-T-S!!! Favorite Food: Hot Sauce…I collect ’em! Favorite Drink: PRUNO…look it up, if you dare! Favorite Movies: The Exorcist, Planet of The Apes (the original), To Kill a Mockingbird, Annie Hall, and of course GF 1 & GF 2…I heard that’s how the real fans refer to them. Favorite Movie Line: easy…Murry-Caddyshack-“big hitter, the Lama”…f#$*in’ riot! Best Rat Rock Bands: STP, VH, ZEP, PEARL JAM, FOOS, PEPPERS,AC/DC Favorite New Bands: Glorious Sons, Rival Sons, Dirty Honey Most Embarrassing Moment: the moment my mother reads this shit! Best Day: I know a lot of folks say this, but it’s true: the day my little girl Jynell and my boy Big D were born! Next to that, it would have to be the day I was baked on earth day in Central Park and met Keefer Sutherland…baked too, I believe.\n\nSign me up for the WRAT email newsletter!\n\nJoin ClubRAT for access to all the perks delivered right to your inbox from Jersey's Concert Connection!
