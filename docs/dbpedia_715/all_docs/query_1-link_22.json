        "text": "You notice how 80% of LB is a big circle of movie aficionados that are just prepping for whatever new release is around the corner?\n\n(Sort of like a coyote chasing a road runner?)\n\nGood news, bad news, who am I to say?\n\nIt's the little things like the Coyote raising his fist in defiance as he plummets off a cliff that make these great. An absolutely perfect final gag as well.\n\n8/10\n\nStarring Coyote (Famishius fantasticus) and Road Runner (Dig-outius tid-bittius).\n\nCoyote doesn't use any ACME brand products or traps in this short and still fails.\n\nThis short is available on the Golden Collection Vol 2.\n\n\"In heaven's name what am I doing?\"\n\nMe staying up past midnight binge watching these cartoons\n\nLet me be honest. I watched The Bugs Bunny Road Runner Movie. Which includes 30+ Loney Tunes shorts intercut by Bugs narration. When the movie gets to the Road Runner segments they are all jumbled together into one huge 20-minute piece where there's often as little as one gag from one short cut into it. Yet I will log all of them because I have watched them at some point in my youth as I remembered virtually every gag (and I'm cheat).\n\nWe’re eight shorts in, so I guess this is the time to grind my axe that this disc of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection is called “Road Runner & Friends.” The friend is always the coyote. When is the guy opposite the Road Runner ever not the coyote? Why can you not give my main man just one shred of dignity?"
