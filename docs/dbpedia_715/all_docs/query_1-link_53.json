However, certain temptations result in him starting to lose over his addiction of consuming Tweety.\n\nDetailed summary\n\nMemorable quotes\n\nClarence: I wouldn't do that if I were you. If I were you, I put him back. It can only lead to self-destruction. It only takes one bird to start you, and before you know it, it's two birds, then three. Suddenly, without realizing it. You're the victim. Then one day, the end of the road. If you want to beat this, look us up. We will help you.\n\nSylvester: Fellow memberths. from now on, my motto iths \"birdths iths strictly for the birdths!\"\n\nTweety: Oh, Mr. Puddy Tat. Don't you like me anymore?\n\nSylvester: I... I... I think... I think... I think you're... I think you're... DELICIOUTHS!\n\nSylvester: One little bird... Just one... Just one... No one will know the difference... No one, no one! Just one! Then I'll quit. I'll quit after one. Just one! Yeah! JUST ONE! I'll get one little bird! Just one! One, one!\n\nTweety: Like I said before, once a bad ol' puddy tat, always a bad ol' puddy tat!\n\nCharacters\n\nOrganizations\n\nBirds Anonymous\n\nLocations\n\nEarth\n\nUnited States\n\nSylvester's apartment\n\nHalligan's Alley\n\nObjects\n\nVehicles\n\nNone\n\nProduction\n\nDevelopment\n\nFilming\n\nMusic\n\nThe music was composed by Milt Franklyn.\n\nCrew credits\n\nLayouts: Hawley Pratt\n\nBackgrounds Boris Gorelick\n\nFilm editor: Treg Brown\n\nRelease\n\nDates are in order of release:\n\nUnited States: August 10, 1957 in theatres\n\nBehind the scenes\n\nThe title and its titular organization are a parody of Alcoholics Anonymous.\n\nThe working title for this cartoon was \"Twee-Teetotaler.\"\n\nThe MPAA certificate number is 18063\n\nErrors\n\nLegacy\n\nThe short was featured in the third and final act of The Looney Looney Looney Bugs Bunny Movie, during the Oswald Awards ceremony.\n\nIt was also featured in the following TV Specials: Bugs Bunny's Easter Funnies and Bugs Bunny's Thanksgiving Diet\n\nAlthough initially unnamed, the red cat who appears in this short would be retroactively named Clarence in the Looney Tunes comics series by DC.\n\nCritical reception\n\nIn The 100 Greatest Looney Tunes Cartoons, Shannon K. Garrity writes, \"Mel Blanc's amazing vocal performances — it was reputedly the Warner Bros. short of which he was proudest — rank high among the many joys of this lovingly crafted, hilariously self-aware cartoon. Freleng and his team went all out to give Birds Anonymous a film noir look, with dramatic camera angles drawn by layout artist Hawley Pratt and moody backgrounds by Boris Gorelick... Above all, Birds Anoymous [sic] satirizes Warner Bros. cartoons themselves. The structure of the standard Sylvester and Tweety cartoon — and all chase cartoons — is threatened by Sylvester's resolution to walk away from the conflict and be a better cat. In the Looney Tunes world, of course, this can't be allowed.\"[1]\n\nAccolades\n\nAward Date of ceremony Category Recipient Result Academy Award March 26, 1958 Best Animated Short Film Edward Selzer Won[2]\n\nIn other languages\n\nLanguage Name Meaning\n\nHome availability\n\nIn the United States:\n\nOctober 25, 2005: Warner Home Video releases Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 3 on DVD.\n\nNovember 30, 2010: Warner Home Video releases Looney Tunes Super Stars' Tweety & Sylvester: Feline Fwenzy on DVD.\n\nAugust 12, 2014: Warner Home Video releases Looney Tunes Platinum Collection: Volume 3 on Blu-ray."
