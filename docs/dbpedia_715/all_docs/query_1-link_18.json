Coyote (here given the ersatz Latin name Carnivorous Vulgaris) tries to catch Roadrunner (Accelleratii Incredibus) through many traps, plans and products, although in this first cartoon not all of the products are yet made by the Acme Corporation.",

Pull out keystone. 2/3 Rock falls on Roadrunner. 4. Roadrunner crushed. (ha-ha)'\n\nThe classic repeated comic formula of Wile E. Coyote going after The Roadrunner, only for his plans to blow up in his face every time. I don't think I have ever rooted for that obnoxious bird in this scenario.\n\n\"Meep, meep!\"\n\n(Quick Hits)\n\n- I wonder if he realizes that if he does manage to blow the bird up, there will not be anything for him left to snack on\n\n- The Coyote did a great job on that 3D tunnel picture, and it is…\n\nThe best of the Murphy's Law gags in the debut cartoon of the popular Wile E. Coyote/Roadrunner series (which established the basic chase format for it), and probably of all cartoons ever made, is the tunnel painting; that's the one where the ever-hungry Coyote (Latin name: Carnivorous Vulgaris) diverts the road path into a dead-end rock disguised as a tunnel to knock the super-fast Roadrunner (Latin name: Accelleratii Incredibus) unconscious, but to his astonishment the bird simply zips right through it, and when Coyote pursues, he smashes into the rock and falls flat on his back, only to have the Roadrunner come back out of the tunnel and trample over him. My second favourite gag would be the last; Coyote,…\n\nI don't know if he had the name \"Wile E. Coyote\" at this point. He says it out loud in his second appearance, a Bugs short (he speaks in the Bugs shorts), so possibly he already did. To be frank, I kind of hate that he has a name. To me the rich artistic merit of this series is linked to its mythic qualities: it's about two very distinct, consistent personalities, yes, but it's also about two entities locked in primordial conflict, rendered strangely modern through the sleek midcentury modern backgrounds (though that doesn't happen yet), and through the jokes about ordering post-war consumer goods from a catalog - along with Peanuts, I think this cartoon series is one of…"
