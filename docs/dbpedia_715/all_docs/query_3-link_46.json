        "text": "A Chuck Jones masterpiece, a one of kind hilarious comment on human nature, the search for our hopes, the quest for our dreams and the pursuit of the happiness that we find in them; all told in just 7 minutes. I don’t know about you but every time I have a tech look at my PC (or for that matter a mechanic at my car, repairman at my washer or dryer, and so on, and so forth) I just can’t seem to reproduce the issue, which is now a called a “Dancing Frog”, a terminology for a computer problem that will not appear when anyone else is watching, due to our Froggy friend. By the way, lest we forget, the song “The Michigan Rag” was written (by One Froggy Evening writer Michael Maltese) solely for this short-film. And further, (I understand that cartoons take on a life of their own, but they are not real, at least that is what my mom told me) Hollywood nightclub singer Bill Roberts (popular in Hollywoodland during the 1950’s) provided the singing voice of the frog.\n\nFor everybody that loves the “Michigan Rag” here are the words for your perusal:\n\nEverybody do the Michigan Rag\n\nEverybody likes the Michigan Rag\n\nEvery Mame and Jane and Ruth\n\nFrom Weehawken to Duluth\n\nSlide, ride, glide the Michigan\n\nStomp, romp, pomp the Michigan\n\nJump, clump, pump the Michigan Rag\n\nThat lovin’ rag!\n\nBy C. S. Williams\n\nFeed the Kitty, directed by Chuck M. Jones (also, he designed the characters), gave us the first appearances of bulldog Marc Antony and Pussyfoot the kitten; 3 follow ups were made: Kiss Me Cat, 1953; Feline Frame-Up, 1954, and in 1958, Cat Feud. This truly is a funny animated short (7 minutes long) film, and heart-touching, with a message of tolerance; Jones and company did themselves proud.The animation chores fell to: Ken Harris, Phil Monroe, Lloyd Vaughan and Ben Washam. The story was written by Michael Maltese, Carl W. Stalling composed the music and filled the duties of musical director, Milt Franklyn was musical-orchestrator while Treg Brown was the film and sound effects editor. Kitty was produced by Edward Selzer, voices by Mel Blanc and Bea Benaderet provided the voice of Marc Antony’s Mistress. As with most animated shorts the film was ready well in advance of its planned (Marc-ed day) release date (ready to knead the back of the public), the copyright was filed for in 1951; for a cartoon, Feed the Kitty was well represented in advertising.\n\nThank you Warner Bros., Merrie Melodies and Chuck Jones for another great cartoon, and for adding more wonderful thoughts and pictures to our mind’s memory bank. If you need a full refresher (or just for the cookie baking scene; a true classic), watch Feed the Kitty again.\n\nCel Notes:\n\nIf you have a very good memory of Monsters, Inc. from 2001 (or the DVD at hand), then you will see that the reactions by Sully when he thinks that Boo is in the garbage compactor, shot for shot duplicates Marc Anthony’s reactions, when he thinks that Pussyfoot is being made into cookies.\n\nBy the way if you thought that Chuck Jones being a Square-Dance enthusiast was just rumors, or a simple hobby interest, think again…\n\nBehind the Scenes:\n\n.\n\nBy C. S. Williams\n\nAh… the aroma of success! For decades dear reader we have been told that the malodorous Casanova was first seen on Saturday, January 6, 1945, which would have been in Troy, New York at the Warner American Theatre. Even the Chuck Jones website states the same; who are we to disagree with the venerable Mr. Jones? Yet, the facts are inescapable, Pepé did not depew debut when first thought.\n\nBut something smells afoul! This iconic Merrie Melodies received its copyright on December 26, 1944 and was ready for distribution. This then leads us to one other verifiable first viewing of Odor-able Kitty: Sunday, December 31, 1944 at the midnight showing at the State Theatre, in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.[1] The odiferous animated cartoon opened for, Hollywood Canteen.\n\nSo, 70 years ago today, 70 years and 6 days ago little “Stinky” (as first known) was born in Odor-able Kitty; conceived and directed by Chuck M. Jones. Mel Blanc provided the voice for the (a myriad of vocality) tainted-odor-diffusing Pepé, based on Charles Boyer’s Pépé le Moko from Algiers (1938), which in turn was a remake of the 1937 French film Pépé le Moko. Pepé Le Pew was perpetually prancing, prattling pitifully, practically put, pestering persistently, passionately pursuing after the purring Penelope; ah, love in the spring and winter too!\n\nPepé Le Pew’s film resume in chronological order:\n\nOdor-Able Kitty (1945)\n\nScent-imental Over You (1947)\n\nFor Scent-imental Reasons (1949) Oscar winner for Best Short Subject, Cartoons\n\nScent-imental Romeo (1951)\n\nLittle Beau Pepé (1952)\n\nWild Over You (1953)\n\nDog Pounded (1954)\n\nThe Cats Bah (1954)\n\nPast Perfumance (1955)\n\nTwo Scent’s Worth (1955)\n\nHeaven Scent (1956)\n\nTouché and Go (1957)\n\nReally Scent (1959)\n\nWho Scent You? (1960)\n\nA Scent of the Matterhorn (1961)\n\nLouvre Come Back to Me! (1962)\n\nBy C. S. Williams\n\n[1] Evening News (Harrisburg, Pennsylvania) December 30, 1944\n\nDirector, Tex “Fred” Avery (Tex seems and sounds so much better for this merrie-looney guy) and crew appropriated the Aesop (Dave Monahan wrote the story and screenplay, leaving Aesop, un-attributed… poor Aesop) fable, “The Tortoise and the Hare,” and along the way made one of the most memorable animated short-films in moving-picture history. Mel Blanc voiced the characters (introduction of Cecil Turtle), Carl W. Stalling directed the music but went uncredited for his musical composition, while Treg Brown edited the cartoon (uncredited) and handled the sound effects, again going uncredited. The usual suspects brought to life with their pencils and paint, this watershed toon: Charles McKimson (animator), Robert Givens (character designer, uncredited), John Didrik Johnsen (background artist uncredited), Robert McKimson, Virgil Ross, Rod Scribner and Sidney Sutherland animated but went uncredited.\n\nWhat great moments were created in 1941 when frustration, anger, slyness, intelligence, ingenuity, execution and more played significant roles (yes turtles everywhere) in a ‘roller-coaster’ ride of emotions in this short-subject; the feelings generated by the delicate sure-handed professional (are you kidding me? I just had a lapse in my train of thought and began to write about the abilities and style of director George Cukor) bold, hyper-active direction of Avery was stellar! Here for your viewing pleasure is Tortoise Beats Hare compliments of YouTube. I caution you though, that the watching of Tortoise Beats Hare does leave one inclined to blurt out such bunny-ite and turtle-ish idioms as: “Big bunch of jerks, I oughta know, I work for ‘em,’” “give ‘him’ the works!” It’s a possibility,” “how did you get up here anyway?” “Oh sorry, pardon me, wrong story;” the excuses for such inappropriate outbursts are solely the responsibility (which may include one or more of the following in required restitution: financial, emotional, familial and or professional) of the reader along with any accompanying apologies that might (most likely will) be needed.\n\nBy C. S. Williams\n\nSaturday, February 23rd, 1935, saw the blustery opening of Disney’s animated short-film, The Band Concert; the first Mickey Mouse cartoon in color.\n\nThe first Disney cartoon in color was released on July 30th, 1932, “Flowers and Trees;” hmm, I wonder if Tolkien saw Flowers and Trees? Ent, Ent. Uh (insert in your mind an elongated pause here), I mean, hint, hint.\n\nPost Script: I hope at the least that my attempt at “talking and walking tree” humor brought a smile to your face, and was not completely lost or misunderstood, nor my post script with further explanation becoming overkill, or taken as insult if you did not get my joke at all. If any of the aforementioned (beginning with Ent, Ent.) is true, please accept my apology now, and forgive me, please. Thank you, this post is not over, it continues below…\n\nFriday, February 23rd, 1940, had the distinction to premier Walt Disney’s Pinocchio, a full-length feature film, in Multiplane Technicolor. Oscar winner for Best Song (When You Wish Upon A Star) and Best Music Original Score. By the way, Pinocchio was the first animated movie to win an Oscar in a competitive category, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs won an honorary Academy Award in 1937.\n\nBy C. S. Williams\n\nFeed the Kitty, directed by Chuck M. Jones (also, he designed the characters), gave us the first appearances of bulldog Marc Antony and Pussyfoot the kitten; 3 follow ups were made: Kiss Me Cat, 1953; Feline Frame-Up, 1954, and in 1958, Cat Feud. This truly is a funny animated short (7 minutes long) film, and heart-touching, with a message of tolerance; Jones and company did themselves proud. The story was written by Michael Maltese, Carl W. Stalling composed the music and filled the duties of musical director, Milt Franklyn was musical-orchestrator while Treg Brown was the film and sound effects editor. Kitty was produced by Edward Selzer, voices by Mel Blanc and Bea Benaderet provided the voice of Marc Antony’s Mistress. Thank you Warner Bros. and Looney Tunes for another great cartoon, and for adding more wonderful thoughts and pictures to our mind’s memory bank.\n\nNote on the side:\n\nIf you have a copy (or a very good memory) of Monsters, Inc. from 2001, then you will see that the reactions by Sully when he thinks that Boo is in the garbage compactor, shot for shot duplicates Marc Anthony’s reactions, when he thinks that Pussyfoot is being made into cookies\n\nBehind the Scenes:\n\n.\n\nBy C. S. Williams\n\nA Chuck Jones masterpiece, a one of kind hilarious comment on human nature, the search for our hopes, the quest for our dreams and the pursuit of the happiness that we find in them; all told in just 7 minutes. I don’t know about you but every time I have a tech look at my PC (or for that matter a mechanic at my car, repairman at my washer or dryer, and so on, and so forth) I just can’t seem to reproduce the issue, which is now a called a “Dancing Frog”, a terminology for a computer problem that will not appear when anyone else is watching, due to our Froggy friend. By the way, lest we forget, the song “The Michigan Rag” was written (by One Froggy Evening writer Michael Maltese) solely for this short-film. And further, (I understand that cartoons take on a life of their own, but they are not real, at least that is what my mom told me) Hollywood nightclub singer Bill Roberts (popular in Hollywoodland during the 1950’s) provided the singing voice of the frog.\n\nFor everybody that loves the “Michigan Rag” here are the words for your perusal:\n\nEverybody do the Michigan Rag\n\nEverybody likes the Michigan Rag\n\nEvery Mame and Jane and Ruth\n\nFrom Weehawken to Duluth\n\nSlide, ride, glide the Michigan\n\nStomp, romp, pomp the Michigan\n\nJump, clump, pump the Michigan Rag\n\nThat lovin’ rag!\n\nBy C. S. Williams"
