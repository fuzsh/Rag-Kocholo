        "text": "I was going to post this in the Retro cartoon section, but seeing how it talks about WB themselves I'm going to post it on here. Now we all know that during the golden age of animation, Warner Bros and Disney were known by its audiences. However Disney made feature length movies while Warner Bros just made theatrical cartoons. Now I've often asked myself why Warner Bros themselves never bothered into making feature length animated films(meaning films outside of LT stuff).\n\nI think it would have been interesting to see an animated film directed by Bob Clampett among others from WB during the golden age. So why didn't WB didn't give a try other than not wanting to compete with Disney?\n\nWarner Bros. was known to have notoriously low budgets for their cartoon shorts, and full-length feature films are pretty darn expensive. After Walt Disney's runaway success with Snow White, folks often asked the infamously penny-pinching Leon Schlesinger about the possibility of doing an animated feature film as a way for Warner Bros. to compete with Disney. His response was usually a much more rude version of the phrase \"I need an animated feature like I need a hole in my head.\"\n\nSpeaking of Bob Clampett, rumor had it at one point that his 1943 Merrie Melodie \"Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs\" was originally conceived as a two-reel mini-feature, along the same vein as the Fleischer studio's Technicolor Popeye specials. But there's no truth to that, either, as apparently even a two-reeler was outside the boundaries of what Schlesinger was willing to pay for.\n\nIt's probably for the best in the end. After Disney's success, other animation studios during that period tried animated features as well. None came close to being successful like Disney, so other didn't bother at all.\n\nIt's just too big a financial risk back then. And in some cases it's the same now.\n\nit was a big risk even for Disney, too. Pinocchio, Fantasia and Bambi flopped hard on their original releases and put Disney in debt, which combined with World War II necessitated a slate of less-ambitious anthology features in the 40's that could be animated (relatively) cheaply.\n\nIt also worked out for the best in that the greatest and most talented WB directors and animators got to stay working on the actual shorts. The best of the best Disney and Fleischer staff were pulled to work on those studios' features, leaving less talented and competent second-stringers to work on Mickey, Donald, Goofy, Betty Boop, Popeye, etc.\n\nI think it also didn't help that the animation department wasn't that high up on WB's priority list, to the point of almost ignorance. Wasn't there that line from Jack Warner where he said \"All I know is we make Mickey Mouse\"?\n\nI think it also didn't help that the animation department wasn't that high up on WB's priority list, to the point of almost ignorance.

I'm pretty sure Jack Warner knew which cartoons his own studio was releasing.\n\nIt's widely believed now that Chuck Jones said that simply as a joke, and it's blossomed into an urban legend since then. I'm pretty sure Jack Warner knew which cartoons his own studio was releasing.\n\nI'm inclined to agree. Legend has it that it was Jack Warner who, for example, asked for more Tasmanian Devil cartoons after Eddie Selzer tried to put them on permanent moratorium.\n\nThanks for the correction. It does seem rather silly a studio head would be ignorant of what his animation department was putting out, since the shorts would've appeared in front of the feature films and such.\n\nIf I may ask, what were the circumstances that led to Chuck Jones saying that as a joke?\n\nThanks for the correction.

He was the only Termite Terrace employee who ever had anything negative to say about Leon Schlesinger, and he supposedly made \"Bully for Bugs\" purely to spite Eddie Selzer (who, according to legend, barged into Jones' office at random one day and exclaimed \"I don't want any bullfight pictures, bullfights aren't funny!\").\n\nIt's worth noting that the one studio that did try to follow Disney's lead in the feature film business, the Fleischers, didn't exactly do well for themselves. I don't know the chronology, so I may be completely wrong, but Schlesinger may have had that in mind when he made the famous \"'nother 'hole\" quote.\n\nAlso, while Jack Warner probably DID know that he didn't own Mickey Mouse, I wouldn't find it that surprising if he was less concerned with his animation department than he was with others.\n\nAs others noted, while Disney was built on animation for their survival, Warner Bros. treated the animation division as just a relatively unimportant subdivision. Good as the Looney Tunes shorts were, I'm sure the Warner brothers (the actual ones, not Yakko, Wakko and Dot ;-) ) just viewed the shorts as filler to put bodies in theater seats for the *real* attraction (Casablanca, Westerns, etc.), and no more important than, say, their newsreel division (another division many major studios had up through the 50s/60s, when television news replaced such)...\n\nThis got me thinking, if Warner Bros. did produce full-legnth features in the '40s and '50s, would they have had the shorts star it's characters, or would the films have just contained original characters? And if the films were all original characters, would they have been billed as \"Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies\" (somehow I'm guessing not)?"
