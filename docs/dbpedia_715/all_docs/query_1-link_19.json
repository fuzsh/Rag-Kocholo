        "text": "The Ducksters is a Warner Bros. Looney Tunes theatrical cartoon short animated in 1949 and released in 1950. It was directed by Chuck Jones and written by Michael Maltese.\n\nTitle[]\n\nThe title is a pun on The Hucksters, a 1947 film.\n\nPlot[]\n\nPorky Pig is on a radio quiz show called \"Truth or AAAHHH!!\", a parody of the popular quiz show Truth or Consequences hosted by Daffy Duck and sponsored by \"Eagle Hand Laundry\", in which the object is answer near-impossible questions (such as \"Who, mind you WHO, was the referee for the New Zealand heavyweight title fight in 1726?\" or \"At what latitude and longitude did the wreck of the Hesperus occur?\") or \"pay the penalty\". These penalties include Porky being crushed by the Rock of Gibraltar, rained upon by Niagara Falls, tied up and blown up with dynamite, severe pounding with a mallet, thrashing by a gorilla, threatened by a buzz saw, crushing by safes, and other forms of abuse. In the end, however, Porky wins $26 million and three cents which he uses to buy the Ajax Radio Network (costing exactly $26,000,000.03!) and then submits Daffy to the same \"penalties\" that he had received earlier. Daffy is then tied to a long plank being cut by the same buzz saw Porky was on to begin the cartoon, quickly irising out after Daffy screams at his studio audience, \"Have you got a doctor in the balcony, lady?!\" (This line was a takeoff of another radio quiz show, Doctor IQ, where the announcer would note \"I have a lady in the balcony, doctor\" to introduce a new contestant.)\n\nGallery[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThe boulder that falls on Porky appears in the Boulder Museum.\n\nOn the game show Porky Pig won: 1. The Rocky Mountains, 2. A 17-Jewel half Nelson, 3. The La Brea Tar Pits, 4. The Rock of Gibraltar, 5. 600 gallons of genuine Niagara Falls, 6. $26,000,000.03.\n\nThe \"Miss Shush\" Porky is asked to identify by the sound of brushing her teeth is actually, as Daffy tells the audience, \"Mamie the 600-Pound Gorilla who appears in Obnoxious Pictures' 'Jungle Jitters'\". Both the character and film are fictitious; as the original cartoon did not feature a gorilla.\n\nThere are several references to well-known people in this cartoon, such as Eli Whitney, George Washington, and even Lauren Bacall.\n\nThe identification of the Ajax Broadcasting Company was an unusual name for Warner Bros.; Ajax was a name more commonly used by rival studio Disney, whereas Warner Bros. would more commonly use Acme Corporation in its later productions.\n\nThis is the last screwball Daffy Duck cartoon, as all of the directors eventually stuck with the greedy, self-centered Daffy that emerged in Rabbit Fire.\n\nCensorship[]\n\nOn Nickelodeon the entire scene where the off-screen audience member says \"You'll be sorry!\", along with Daffy shooting that off-screen audience with a gun is cut.[1]\n\nAvailability[]\n\nVHS - The Looney Tunes Video Show, Volume 1\n\nDVD - Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 1, Disc Two\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nThe Ducksters\n\nThe Ducksters\n\n1930s I Haven't Got a Hat • Gold Diggers of '49 • Plane Dippy • Alpine Antics • Boom Boom • The Blow Out • Westward Whoa • Fish Tales • Shanghaied Shipmates • Porky's Pet • Porky the Rain-Maker • Porky's Poultry Plant • Porky's Moving Day • Milk and Money • Little Beau Porky • The Village Smithy • Porky in the North Woods • Porky the Wrestler • Porky's Road Race • Picador Porky • Porky's Romance • Porky's Duck Hunt • Porky and Gabby • Porky's Building • Porky's Super Service • Porky's Badtime Story • Porky's Railroad • Get Rich Quick Porky • Porky's Garden • Rover's Rival • The Case of the Stuttering Pig • Porky's Double Trouble • Porky's Hero Agency • Porky's Poppa • Porky at the Crocadero • What Price Porky • Porky's Phoney Express • Porky's Five & Ten • Porky's Hare Hunt • Injun Trouble • Porky the Fireman • Porky's Party • Porky's Spring Planting • Porky & Daffy • Wholly Smoke • Porky in Wackyland • Porky's Naughty Nephew • Porky in Egypt • The Daffy Doc • Porky the Gob • The Lone Stranger and Porky • It's an Ill Wind • Porky's Tire Trouble • Porky's Movie Mystery • Chicken Jitters • Porky and Teabiscuit • Kristopher Kolumbus Jr. • Polar Pals • Scalp Trouble • Old Glory • Porky's Picnic • Wise Quacks • Porky's Hotel • Jeepers Creepers • Naughty Neighbors • Pied Piper Porky • Porky the Giant Killer • The Film Fan\n\n1940s Porky's Last Stand • Africa Squeaks • Ali-Baba Bound • Pilgrim Porky • Slap Happy Pappy • Porky's Poor Fish • You Ought to Be in Pictures • The Chewin' Bruin • Porky's Baseball Broadcast • Patient Porky • Calling Dr. Porky • Prehistoric Porky • The Sour Puss • Porky's Hired Hand • The Timid Toreador • Porky's Snooze Reel • Porky's Bear Facts • Porky's Preview • Porky's Ant • A Coy Decoy • Porky's Prize Pony • Meet John Doughboy • We, The Animals - Squeak! • The Henpecked Duck • Notes to You • Robinson Crusoe, Jr. • Porky's Midnight Matinee • Porky's Pooch • Porky's Pastry Pirates • Who's Who in the Zoo • Porky's Cafe • My Favorite Duck • Confusions of a Nutzy Spy • Yankee Doodle Daffy • Porky Pig's Feat • Tom Turk and Daffy • Tick Tock Tuckered • Swooner Crooner • Duck Soup to Nuts • Slightly Daffy • Brother Brat • Trap Happy Porky • Wagon Heels • Baby Bottleneck • Daffy Doodles • Kitty Kornered • Mouse Menace • One Meat Brawl • Little Orphan Airedale • Daffy Duck Slept Here • Nothing But The Tooth • The Pest That Came to Dinner • Riff Raffy Daffy • Scaredy Cat • Awful Orphan • Porky Chops • Paying the Piper • Daffy Duck Hunt • Curtain Razor • Often an Orphan • Dough for the Do-Do • Bye, Bye Bluebeard\n\n1950s Boobs in the Woods • The Scarlet Pumpernickel • An Egg Scramble • Golden Yeggs • The Ducksters • Dog Collared • The Wearing of the Grin • Drip-Along Daffy • The Prize Pest • Thumb Fun • Cracked Quack • Fool Coverage • Duck Dodgers in the 24½th Century • Claws for Alarm • My Little Duckaroo • Jumpin' Jupiter • Dime to Retire • Rocket Squad • Deduce, You Say • Boston Quackie • Robin Hood Daffy • China Jones\n\n1960s Daffy's Inn Trouble • Corn on the Cop\n\n1970s-present Duck Dodgers and the Return of the 24½th Century • Superior Duck • My Generation G...G...
