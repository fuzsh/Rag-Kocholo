Cartoon Studio. It might interest you to know that in production of this \"Tweetie Pie,\" 85 percent of our personnel were directly connected with its construction. However, the one man who really should be up here getting this award and not me, is the director of the picture, Friz Freleng, who is in the audience. I can't pay him too great a tribute. Thank you."
