GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Shawn Marion had 13 points and eight rebounds, leading the Dallas Mavericks to an 89-83 victory over the Charlotte Bobcats on Saturday night.

Jose Calderon contributed 13 points and five assists for the Mavericks, who never trailed in the second half and built a lead of as many as 16 points in the fourth quarter.

The Bobcats' three-game winning streak was snapped despite 14 points and 10 rebounds off the bench from rookie Cody Zeller.

Bobcats guard Ben Gordon sat out as he recovered from a procedure to relieve soreness in his right knee. Gordon will miss the remainder of the preseason.

Dallas forward Dirk Nowitzki did not play, getting a night of rest despite occasional "We want Dirk!" chants from some of the 7,678 fans at the Greensboro Coliseum.
