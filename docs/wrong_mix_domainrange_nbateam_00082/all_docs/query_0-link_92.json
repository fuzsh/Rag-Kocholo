        "text": "8:04pm:Â The chatter around the league is that the Mavericks will explore a deal for Turner, tweets Sam Amico of FOX Sports Ohio. Â The name of Shawn Marion, who is sidelined due to injury, has also been mentioned.\n\n7:29pm:Â The Bobcats have looked into acquiring 76ers forward Evan Turner, an NBA source tells Rick Bonnell of the Charlotte Observer. Â The 76ers are reportedly pushing to move Turner before the deadline and are looking for draft compensation in a deal. Â However, Bonnell cautions that nothing appears to be imminent between them and the Bobcats.\n\nThe 6-foot-7 forward, who is averaging 18.1 points and 6.0 RPG this season, could potentially add the scoring punch the Bobcats need to reach the playoffs for only the second time in club history. Â However, it’s not clear what Charlotte would give up to get the former No. 2 overall pick since he’ll be a restricted free agent at the end of the season.\n\nThe Bobcats are an intriguing match for Philly as they could have as many as three first-round picks in the 2014 draft between their own and picks potentially to owed them by the Blazers and Pistons. Â However, the Bobcats might owe their own pick to the Bulls to complete the Tyrus Thomas trade. Â As for the outside selections, Charlotte is more likely to see the Portland pick come in than the Pistons one thanks to protections. Â The Bobcats can also offer Ben Gordon‘s expiring $13.2MM contract in a deal.\n\nOther suitors mentioned in the past for Turner include the Thunder, Suns, Clippers, and Hawks."
