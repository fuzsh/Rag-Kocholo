That was before we found out half the team had overeaten all summer and the other half would spend all season crapping all over the floor. Dwyane Wade is a great player, but he couldn’t revive the Heat’s season even when he was on the floor, let alone the 31 games he was injured. Way to make me look good, Miami. Then again Miami didn’t make anybody look good last year. Well, except their opponents, that is.\n\nThis year everybody’s high off of the D. Wade Olympics buzz and predicting the Heat are back. Back to what, I wonder. On paper they look like they have some talent. Shawn Marion is a fine athlete. Michael Beasley is said to be the most NBA-ready player from this year’s draft. Along with Wade they should make a formidable scoring threat. But it feels like a weird fit, as if Miami is just throwing more scorers at the problem…a classic way to go down in flames in the NBA. (Though there’s not much more “down” for Miami to explore.) Mark Blount is also a scorer, by the way, and Marcus Banks would like to be. Furthermore, while the Heat definitely did themselves a favor by getting rid of chronic Froot Loop Ricky Davis, they have a bunch of players who, for whatever reason, have not fit in smoothly with prior teams. These would include…hmmm…every name we’ve mentioned so far except for Wade. James Jones should be a nice fit and Yakhouba Diawara was not a bad pick-up, but they’re not the kind of players to turn a team around.\n\nMiami’s huge difficulty last year was offensive production. A big part of the problem was chemistry and continuity. Rookie coach Erik Spoelstra is going to have to come up with a system that lets these players play nice and then hope he can convince them to accept it. Sharing was not a strong point last year. Neither was percentage shooting, free throw shooting, or anything that would indicate that there are extra points to be had beyond what the Big Three can score with brute force talent.Miami’s rebounding was pitiful last year and I don’t see anybody on this roster who will change that immediately. That will cut down on the number of easy buckets they can get. Their defense was poor also.\n\nWith the addition of Beasley, Wade healthy, and at least a couple former players now causing headaches for other teams Miami should be able to win more than 15 this year. There’s not much reason to forecast an amazing leap forward, though. The storylines in Miami will not be about playoff chases but about Wade’s stamina, Beasley’s attitude and adaptation, and whether Shawn Marion fits this team’s future well enough to bother retaining him.\n\nCHARLOTTE BOBCATS\n\nRecord: 32-50, 4th in Southeast Division, 12th in Eastern Conference\n\nStatistical Comparisons\n\nNotable:\n\n29th in free throw percentage\n\nOthers:\n\n19th in the league in scoring (97.1 ppg)\n\n20th in opponent scoring (101.4 ppg)\n\n22nd in ppg differential (-4.4 ppg)\n\n17th in field goal %\n\n22nd in opponent field goal %\n\n12th in three-point %\n\n11th in free throw attempts per game\n\n16th (tie) in assists\n\n13th in steals\n\n10th in blocks\n\n16th in turnovers\n\n22nd in opponent turnovers\n\nPoor offensive rebounding team\n\nVery Poor defensive rebounding team\n\nMovement\n\nSignificant Additions: D.J.

Augustin\n\nSG: Jason Richardson, Matt Carroll\n\nSF: Gerald Wallace, Jared Dudley, Adam Morrison\n\nPF: Emeka Okafor, Sean May,\n\nC: Nazr Mohammed, Ryan Hollins, Alexis Ajinca\n\nComments\n\nThe Bobcats have an interesting roster. Gerald Wallace and Jason Richardson make for one of the more athletic wing combos in the league, even with Richardson playing slower than he did when he was younger. You don’t see a 20 ppg pair at shooting guard and small forward that often. Raymond Felton can also score and he racks up dimes like a retro pay phone. This frees up the frontcourt to concentrate on defense and rebounding. Emeka Okafor is one of the best in those areas…another scary dude. So why doesn’t this work better? It’s like artichokes, orange juice, twinkies, and pork chops in the same pot. They’re all great tastes, but they don’t necessarily go together. Their defense is uncoordinated, their rebounding shoddy, and they have trouble creating points and opportunities for anybody besides those wings. In short they struggle with anything requiring actual teamwork. Make the game easy on them and they’ll run all over you. Make the game difficult and they can’t pull it together.\n\nMichael Jordan’s instincts seemed right on this off-season. They needed another point guard with starting potential in case the Raymond Felton experiment comes to an end. D.J. Augustin could develop into the Felton mold of scoring/passing. Alexis Ajinca is nobody’s banger, but he doesn’t have to be with Okafor on the roster. He can use his seven-foot frame for finishing and work the mid-range game otherwise, letting Okafor have the block. The problem is, neither of these players is likely to blossom fully this year. Also neither helps with defense and rebounding. Okafor can’t hold the fort alone. The Bobcats weren’t able to acquire significant veterans. You’d almost wish James Jones ended up here instead of Miami.\n\nIf Larry Brown has one more great coaching run in him then perhaps he can pull these guys together and maximize their talent. If Larry Brown throws up his hands after a month and a half and quits this team is going to fall to pieces. Either way, it’s hard to see them moving up the standings chart immediately. They’ll remain a team nobody likes to see, but a team most other teams expect to beat."
