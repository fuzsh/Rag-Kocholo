        "text": "DALLAS — O.J. Mayo scored 30 points and the Dallas Mavericks remained unbeaten against the Charlotte Bobcats with a 126-99 victory on Saturday night.\n\nMayo made a career-high seven 3-pointers, including one that put the Mavericks ahead for good late in the second quarter and another that capped a 24-8 run that made it 76-61 in the third.\n\nDallas improved to 16-0 all-time against Charlotte.\n\nChris Kaman made his Mavericks debut as a reserve, but the spark off the bench came from Vince Carter. The 14-year veteran got the crowd going with a powerful dunk and did it again later with a spectacular blocked shot.\n\nRamon Sessions led Charlotte with 22 points.\n\nCoach Rick Carlisle earned his 200th victory with Dallas. He’s the third Mavericks coach to reach the mark behind Don Nelson (339) and Dick Motta (329).\n\nDallas, the only NBA team that hasn’t lost to Charlotte, trailed 53-52 when Mayo hit a left-wing 3-pointer to start a 9-0 run over the final 1:01 of the first half.\n\nDarren Collison started the second half with another 3-pointer, and Mayo connected again to finish the 24-8 run with 7:47 left in the third. Mayo was 7 of 10 from long range.\n\nKaman got off to a slow start after missing two weeks with a strained right calf, but he was a different player in the second half. He made all five of his shots in the third quarter, including an alley-oop dunk on one of Collison’s 10 assists, and finished with 16 points on 8-of-9 shooting.\n\nFormer Charlotte coach Larry Brown, now at SMU after he was fired by the Bobcats two years ago, watched courtside as the Bobcats fell behind 31-19 after the first quarter before going on a 17-4 run for a 36-35 lead. Sessions had eight points during the spurt, including the go-ahead bucket.\n\nCarlisle wasted no time going to Kaman, calling on him less than two minutes into the game. Carter’s entrance about five minutes later had a much bigger impact. He got the crowd going with a powerful dunk and hit a 3-pointer in the final seconds of the first quarter for a 31-19 lead.\n\nCarter got the crowd off its feet again in the second quarter by chasing down Kemba Walker and blocking his breakaway layup attempt out of bounds. Carter did his share offensively, too, finishing with 18 points and hitting 4 of 8 from 3-point range.\n\nWalker had 10 points and was held to 10 shots a night after scoring a career-high 30 to lead the Bobcats past Indiana in their opener.\n\nNOTES: Mavericks G Rodrigue Beaubois was inactive after twisting his left ankle in practice Friday. . Shawn Marion had two blocks on former Dallas teammate Brendan Haywood in the first quarter. The Mavericks used the amnesty clause to dump Haywood in the offseason. . Bobcats G Gerald Henderson left in the third quarter with a left foot sprain and didn’t return. . Mavericks TV announcer Mark Followill is out indefinitely after getting injured in a bike accident Saturday in Dallas. He’s been with the Mavericks for 12 seasons."
