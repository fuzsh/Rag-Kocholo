        "text": "Rookie\n\nOVR: 1\n\nJoin Date: Sep 2011\n\nRe: NBA 2K12: The Official Association/Online Association Thread\n\nTrying to revive the Charlotte Bobcats, basically blew up their whole team.\n\nAll-Star Sim, play one game a week, 12 min quarters, etc.\n\nTeam is 18-16 so far\n\nTEAM SO FAR\n\nPG: Walker/A. Miller/J. Fredette (not a crazy Utah Fredette fan btw)\n\nSG: T. Allen/C. Brewer\n\nSF: J. Dudley/A. Thornton/D. Brown\n\nPF: D. West/D. Arthur/T. Outlaw\n\nC: A. Bargnani/D.J. White/T. Mozgov\n\nI first of course blew up the team, and 5 games in Tyrus Thomas got injured and would be out for 6-8 weeks, we did better without him, and decided to trade him for a temporary PF in West when he recovered.\n\nTeammates and my thoughts.\n\nSpoiler\n\nKemba Walker: 31 Min. 11.8ppg 3.5rpg 5.3apg 1spg 46%FG 49%3P\n\nOf course I kept Walker, who is the unofficial captain of the team. just doing a great job, but needs to either raise his assists or points for each game.\n\nAndre Miller: 22 Min. 8.8ppg 2.3rpg 5.2apg .9spg 43%FG 50%3P\n\nSince I acquired him later in the season, he has shown himself to be a great back up point guard, he requested an extension, and while Fredette develops, Miller will be my primary back up with a 2 year, 3 mil extension.\n\nJimmer Fredette: 10 Min. 3.7ppg .9rpg 1apg 35%FG 39%3P\n\nHis points per game are actually a bit skewed, since he is inconsistent, but yeah, not much to see here.\n\nTony Allen: 21 Min. 8.3ppg 2.5rpg 1.6spg 45%FG 10%3P(ahahaha)\n\nTony Allen is a man who starts at SG, but in my system he and Brewer are getting the same minutes. Most of his points come from either drives to the basket or free throws, since he draws fouls often. Mildly surprised at what I got out of him though.\n\nCorey Brewer: 20 Min. 7.6ppg 3.5rpg 1spg 42%FG 30%3P\n\nMore of a defender as well, Brewer always creates a mismatch, he needs to work on his 3 point shooting, but he has a few more years to grow. He provides energy off the bench.\n\nJared Dudley: 28 Min. 12.4ppg 4.4rpg 1.5spg 43%FG 43%3P\n\nInconsistent... Some nights, he scores 4 points a game, and others, he leads the team in scoring with 23. He is simply inconsistent, if he could become more consistent, his minutes, and his points each game would go up.\n\nAl Thornton: 15 Min. 4.6ppg 2.2rpg 41%FG\n\nSigned when Tyrus Thomas got injured, and his position was changed to SF/PF for this. Thornton will stay with the team for the season, more for his athleticism and hustle, but won't be resigned.\n\nDerrick Brown: 13 Min. 4.6ppg 3rpg 50%FG\n\nCertainly due for an increase in minutes, Derrick Brown however wants to test free agency after this season, expect him to be traded soon.\n\nDavid West: Has yet to play in a Bobcats uniform\n\nHis Pacers stats were solid, we expect him to be a great temporary Power Forward for us.\n\nDarrell Arthur: 19 Min. 10.4ppg 4.3rpg 59%FG\n\nDarrell Arthur is going to be a PF of Charlotte for years to come, recently getting signed to a 4 year contract extension. He also has a great shot selection, being one of the league leaders for Field Goal Percentage.\n\nTravis Outlaw: 13 Min. 4.5ppg 3rpg 43%FG\n\nOutlaw is trying to revive his career, but the energy he brings the Bobcats off the bench is invaluable, and he is certainly productive on his time on the floor.\n\nAndrea Bargnani: 31 Min. 19.2ppg 8.4rpg 1.4bpg 46%FG 42%3P\n\nYeah, Bargnani is playing like a beast in Charlotte, with several 30+ point games on the season so far. with 4 years of contract left, don't expect him to go anywhere.\n\nD.J. White: 17 Min. 6.3ppg 4.8rpg 50%FG\n\nChanged his position to C after lack of C's on my team, he is now a C/PF\n\nD.J. White has been a pleasant surprise, being a competent back-up to Barg, while also having great games, such as his 17 point game. Needs to get more consistent with his scoring however.\n\nTimofey Mozgov: Has yet to play a game in a Bobcats uniform\n\nCurrently in the D-league.\n\nFormer Bobcats traded later in the season. (there are a lot of them)\n\nSpoiler\n\nGerald Henderson (traded 12/3)\n\nBeing outplayed by Tony Allen and Corey Brewer, Henderson was the odd man out, and was part of a trade to acquire Andre Miller.\n\nReggie Williams (traded 12/3)\n\nAnother piece of the Andre Miller trade. Reggie Williams wasn't producing for the Bobcats, and was traded to free up minutes for Derrick Brown and Jared Dudley.\n\nC.J. Watson (traded 12/3)\n\nTraded to acquire Darrell Arthur, since Tyrus Thomas was out, and Bobcats were struggling against bigs.\n\nSolomon Alabi (waived 12/7)\n\nD-Leaguer acquired in the Bargnani trade. Waived after he was struggling to even produce in the D-League.\n\nPape Sy (waived 1/10)\n\nSigned for a small contract while we were suffering injuries to our PG's and SG's.\n\nTyrus Thomas (traded 1/10)\n\nWe were doing a lot better without Thomas, and now that we had Darrell Arthur, we decided to trade him for a contract that would expire sooner, so Arthur wouldn't have to compete for a start in the future.\n\nRookie\n\nOVR: 0\n\nJoin Date: Mar 2012\n\nRe: NBA 2K12: The Official Association/Online Association Thread\n\nGot inspired to start a brand new association and I did so with the Lakers, simulated the entire of the first season, barely made it for the playoffs and got 16th pick for the draft.\n\nHalfway through, Hornets traded their first pick 14th for World Peace and my 2nd round pick\n\nI snapped up a PG and PF who are rated 3 stars and seem to have a lot of potential\n\nDuring the second round, pistons traded me Prince for Walton and next year's 2nd round pick, needlessly to say I said yes, finally unloading a major salary cap liability.\n\nSigned Shannon Brown and Jermaine O neal during FA\n\nAnd my team at the end of it was\n\nPG: Tony Wroten(Rookie)/Steve Blake\n\nSG: Kobe/Brown\n\nSF: Prince/Barnes\n\nPF: Gasol/McRoberts/O Bryant(Rookie)\n\nC: Bynum/O Neal\n\nPretty happy with the depth in the team, and played my first game at home against Jazz\n\nThe game started well with me getting a 8 point lead during the first quarter, mainly through my bench as my starters were underperforming especially Kobe.\n\nBrown came off the bench to drop 10 points. During the second quarter, I lost the lead and the Jazz were soon up by 10 points and I struggled badly to recover, by the middle of the 4th quarter, I was doing well defensively and converting possessions into points, last minute buzzer beat by Kobe was not good and I lost to the Jazz 93-91\n\nAfterall, I was happy with my bench performance especially Brown who dropped 3s for me to make it a close game, as well as Blake and Barnes.\n\nDisappointed with O neal and Prince who made no contribution whatsoever. Kobe was shooting below 25% but managed to end the game with 29 points after the first half.\n\nTony Wroten took some time to get started up and ended with 4 points and 5 rebounds\n\nMy best duo was perhaps Kobe and Gasol who managed 50-odd points between them as well as 20 rebounds and 15 assists\n\nNext game against Warriors at their turf, will be giving Prince another chance and if it doesn't work out, then I'm going to trade him off for a 3pt SF"
