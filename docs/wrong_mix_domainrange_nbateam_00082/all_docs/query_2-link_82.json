        "text": "Kemba Walker is a top Mavericks target this coming summer. He’s an unrestricted free agent for the first time in his career, which spanned eight years with the Charlotte Bobcats and now Hornets. And he’s polarizing as hell: I must have heard a dozen different opinions about him in recent weeks from Mavericks fans who like, dislike, or just don’t have much faith in the planned pursuit of Walker when July 1 arrives.\n\nWhat Walker exhibits to me, to be honest, is how hard team building really is. Make no mistake, he would provide so many positives on the court as well as good will toward this team. Yet there’s also a legitimate argument that Dallas shouldn’t offer him a deal, even if he was amenable to it. We’re here to examine all of that, starting now.\n\nWould Walker be the best free agent Dallas has ever added?\n\nYes, and it wouldn’t be close. Right now, the candidates are Shawn Marion (technically a sign-and-trade), Chandler Parsons and Monta Ellis. Since Mark Cuban assumed control of the team, Dallas has almost exclusively succeeded in building its teams through trades and draft picks. Free agency, meanwhile, is the organization’s greatest source of failure. But Walker would be a bona fide success, a three-time All-Star who just made his first All-NBA team this past season and checked in as the league’s 12th-leading scorer.\n\nEven Walker didn’t expect himself to hit the level he ascended to in 2018-2019. “I never saw myself playing at this level, and shooting the ball like this,” he told ESPN’s Zach Lowe late last year. In his first four seasons, Walker was a small speedster whose shot constantly let him down. Lowe’s profile details how meticulously Walker worked with shooting coach Bruce Kreutzer to move his release to the right and to the tips of his toes, making for a more repeatable motion. Eventually, it worked. Last season, James Harden led the league in pull-up 3-point attempts. But Walker was second with 6.0 per game – ahead of Damian Lillard, Luka Doncic, Chris Paul and Stephen Curry. That’s an essential shot in 2019.\n\nIn a loaded free agency class – Kevin Durant (ugh), Kawhi Leonard, Kyrie Irving, the Anthony Davis trade sweepstakes – Walker might fall into the second tier, glossed over by those with more star power. But there’s no questioning how talented Walker is and how fraught with failure Dallas’ free agency expeditions have been in the past. Those two, combined, would make Walker the best.\n\nBut what are the odds they do sign him?\n\nWalker’s All-NBA nod – and his play, which led to that recognition – is what makes him such an attractive free agent. But that All-NBA nod also made Walker eligible for a supermax contract, which in turn makes it harder for him to re-sign anywhere except Charlotte. Money isn’t everything, of course, and Walker has already banked $58 million in his career. But the gap between what the Hornets can offer and what anyone else can has become much more severe.\n\nHere’s what the supermax actually does: Charlotte can offer Walker a deal worth 35 percent of their cap this summer instead of 30. They can also offer him five years – something no one else can do – and eight-percent yearly raises while opposing teams are limited to five percent. A five-year max deal this summer would be worth about $220 million overall, topping out at $50.4 million in the 2023-24 season. The most money any other team could offer – over only four years – would be around $140 million.\n\nIt’s not certain the Hornets want to offer $220 million, of course. They could offer him the supermax without the fifth year or with that year only partially guaranteed. They could try to sway him with a flat offer, one missing the eight-percent raises, which would still pay him better than the alternatives. Walker has spent eight seasons in Charlotte; they have made the playoffs just twice, both first-round exits. But Walker didn’t seem uncertain about his future there last month.\n\n“Oh no question, Charlotte’s definitely my first priority,” he told The Athletic’s Jared Weiss. “That’s where I’ve been for eight years and that’s all I know. Not many people get a chance to play for one NBA team throughout their career. When I go on my Instagram, I see, ‘Kemba leave! Kemba get out of Charlotte!’ People don’t understand, when they say you need to go ‘here’ and win, that winning is not guaranteed anywhere.”\n\nThat last sentence certainly rings true for Dallas, at least from a player’s perspective given that the team won just 33 games last season. Yes, obviously, they have two bright young stars, and fans are right to be optimistic. Those within the league generally approach these things with more pessimism. But maybe, if Charlotte low balls and Dallas sweet talks, this becomes more interesting. That’s where this currently stands.\n\nWould he take a shorter deal?\n\nHere’s the argument: Walker has been in the league eight years. When he reaches 10 years of service, his max cap slot rises to the 35 percent mark. What if he signed a three-year deal worth $103 million with a player option that could allow him to recoup any money lost from leaving Charlotte? (In this scenario, he’s either passing up on Charlotte’s supermax or, more likely, they aren’t offering it.) The plan would then be to opt out in 2021 and sign another max contract, this one with that 35 percent max slot and an even higher salary cap – meaning more base money. (If the salary cap rises to, say, $120 million, then Walker’s first year could start at $42 million.)\n\nBut, boy, this would be a gamble; Walker would be 31 years old in 2021. If he hadn’t stayed three years in college, maybe. If small guards didn’t have such a tragic history of aging poorly, maybe. Last season was his career year, and there’s no guarantee he will ever play that well again for an extended period of time. Walker is reliable, at least, playing 82 games last season and only missing 34 games over the entirety of his career. But he still relies heavily on athleticism, even with his new and improved jumper.\n\nBesides, that doesn’t seem like Walker. He begged his agent to stop playing hardball with Charlotte during his first extension. “Walker threatened to call the team and do it himself,” Lowe wrote last year, over a difference of just $2 million. Even Walker now, more confident and coming off his best-ever season, probably isn’t planning to juggle short-term contracts for maximum financial gain. That wouldn’t jive with a player who is so vocally loyal to Charlotte, one who doesn’t see much appeal in larger markets.\n\nA shorter deal would fit Dallas. A two-years-plus-one that Walker would likely opt out of would give the Mavericks a superstar for the interim, avoid the danger of signing him long-term and keep the team’s free agency plans open for 2021. But it doesn’t matter if Walker wouldn’t entertain it.\n\nWhat’s the argument against pursuing Walker?\n\nIt’s essentially spelled out above: Are we certain that the smartest move for the Mavericks is offering a four-year, $140 million deal to a small point guard who’s already 29?\n\nThere’s also the matter of how he fits next to Doncic. For starters, Walker is ball dominant. After the All-Star break last season, Doncic finished first overall with 96.5 touches per game. Walker was third, at 90.2 per outing. Like Doncic, he’s a poor defender; unlike Doncic, there’s no hope for Walker, who always puts in good effort but stands only 6’1.\n\nIf Dallas committed four years to Walker, it would lock him up with a core much younger than him – his deal wouldn’t expire until Doncic’s presumed extension kicks in. Right now, the Mavericks’ free agency window can remain relatively open until Doncic’s rookie-scale contract graduates to a full-fledged maximum-salary deal. They could sign complementary pieces this summer, next summer and, frankly, even the summer after that as they hunt for the right player who fits the Doncic-Porzingis duo. Walker, however, would zap any creativity and flexibility Dallas might have.\n\nWalker, again, is incredibly good at basketball. Doncic and Walker led their respective teams in touches because they were surrounded by mediocre talent and non-ball-handlers. Walker, especially, could adjust to spot-up shooting and weak side pick-and-rolls. He only attempted 2.6 catch-and-shoot 3s last season in Charlotte, but he knocked them down at a fine clip. Even if Doncic develops into a LeBron James-like talent, we know James never won anything without a ball handling sidekick, be it Dwyane Wade or Kyrie Irving. You could also stagger those two like Houston does with James Harden and Chris Paul; both could still receive 75 touches or more every game.\n\nYou would, however, give up on any dreams of an elite defense. Doncic may be below average, but at least he’s highly versatile by virtue of standing 6’8 and unlocking massive lineups when he’s playing the 1. Walker would be an easier target for opponents, especially because he’s limited in who he can guard. What happens as he ages into his 30s?\n\nWould it be dumb not to pursue Walker?\n\nWalker might not be the perfect fit, but then again, who is? There are only 450 NBA players at any given time and 30 stars. Maybe five or six of the latter are available each summer. Meanwhile, there are 30 teams vying for those stars, and five to 10 each summer with the realistic means of obtaining them. And of those five to 10, several are often glamour markets with long histories signing these types of players. Dallas has no such history.\n\nImagine this scenario. Dallas doesn’t pursue Walker even when he announces he’s willing to leave Charlotte. They punt next offseason with one-year rentals because the star free agency crop is thin. They chase Giannis Antetokounmpo and Bradley Beal in 2021, but Antetokounmpo re-signs, and Beal joins the Knicks or maybe the Lakers. Suddenly, it’s 2022, Doncic’s extension is nearing, and the Mavericks have almost nothing to show for cap space and their most promising young core since the Three J’s.\n\nUgh. Do you see how damn hard this is? Let me ask this another way: What is the ceiling of a Doncic-Porzingis-Walker team? Could they become a top-four team in the Western Conference? Could they contend for titles? If you think they can, then it’s worth pursuing Walker, no matter how inconvenient it might be to pay him $40 million in 2023.\n\nWhat actually happens?\n\nMy hunch is that Walker will re-sign in Charlotte. Maybe Dallas provides him the necessary leverage to get more money, or maybe he really considers the Mavericks, dreaming about the Doncic-Porzingis future before ultimately deciding that Charlotte is home. I would prefer an age-appropriate star to pair with Doncic-Porzingis, but I could set that hesitation aside pretty easily if he were to come aboard. It’s hard enough to plan for one offseason, much less several in advance. It’s a league with fleeting chances and fragile opportunity. If you can add an All-Star to this young core, even if he can’t stick with them for the next decade, I understand why you would just do it and figure the rest out later.\n\nBut we don’t know, and won’t, until the Hornets play their hand.\n\n(Photo Credit: Raj Mehta-USA TODAY Sports)"
