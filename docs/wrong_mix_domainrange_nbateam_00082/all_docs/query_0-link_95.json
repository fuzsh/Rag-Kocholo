        "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Laron Profit tipped in Juan Dixon’s miss with 3.1 seconds to play to give the Washington Wizards an 86-84 victory over the Charlotte Bobcats on Saturday night.\n\nThe Bobcats missed twice before Washington’s final possession. Jason Kapono’s shot was off, and Gerald Wallace’s shot was blocked by Brendan Haywood. The Wizards called timeout and ran down the clock before getting the ball to Dixon in the left corner. His shot bounced off the rim, but Profit was under the basket and tipped it in.\n\nHaywood scored 22 points for Washington, which broke its six-game road losing streak.\n\nJason Hart scored 18 of his career-high 20 points in the fourth quarter to lead Charlotte.\n\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) — Steve Francis scored 26 points and rookie backcourt mate Jameer Nelson added a career-high 22 as the Orlando Magic took an early lead and blew out the Nets.\n\nKelvin Cato added 16 points for the Magic, who had four players in double figures. Nelson, further entrenched in the Orlando starting lineup after Doug Christie was placed on the injured list, shot 7-of-9 and had three assists.\n\nRookie Dwight Howard had 11 points and 11 rebounds for the Magic.\n\nVince Carter led New Jersey with 20 points, the 18th straight game he’s reached that mark.\n\nATLANTA (AP) — Marc Jackson hit a pair of free throws with 1.2 seconds remaining, and Allen Iverson stole Atlanta’s ensuing inbounds pass as Philadelphia extended the Hawks’ losing streak to 11 games.\n\nIverson, who hit all 13 of his free throw attempts, scored 33 points but was just 3-for-19 from the floor in the second half.\n\nThe Sixers won two straight for the first time since acquiring Webber in a Feb. 23 with Sacramento. Webber finished with 18 points and a team-high eight rebounds.\n\nAl Harrington led Atlanta with 19 points.\n\nMILWAUKEE (AP) — Desmond Mason scored 20 points, Maurice Williams and Michael Redd added 16 points each and the Bucks defeated the Chicago Bulls in Milwaukee for the 14th consecutive time.\n\nThe Bulls’ losing streak at the Bradley Center dates to March 29, 1998, the year Michael Jordan led the team to the last of its six NBA championships.\n\nJoe Smith added 10 points and a season-high 16 rebounds for the Bucks, whose last 16 points came from the free throw line. Milwaukee hit 17 of 21 free throws in the fourth quarter.\n\nKirk Hinrich led Chicago with 24 points and rookie Ben Gordon added 20 as the Bulls lost their third consecutive game.\n\nPHOENIX (AP) — Shawn Marion had 26 points and nine rebounds, and the Phoenix Suns routed the Portland Trail Blazers for the third time this season.\n\nCoach Mike D’Antoni rested starters Marion, Amare Stoudemire and Steve Nash for the entire fourth quarter after the Suns went ahead 102-78 after three.\n\nStoudemire contributed 20 points, but Nash saw his string of 11-assist games snapped at 12. Nash, who finished with eight, was trying to become the first player with 11 or more assists in 13 consecutive games since John Stockton in 1990-91.\n\nDamon Stoudamire had 30 points and Shareef Abdur-Rahim had 25 points and 13 rebounds for the Blazers, who dropped their fourth straight and second under interim coach Kevin Pritchard.\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) — Earl Boykins scored 12 of his 22 points in the fourth quarter as the Denver Nuggets continued their push for the playoffs under new coach George Karl with their sixth straight victory.\n\nBoykins, a 5-foot-5 guard who spent two seasons with the Clippers, has scored in double figures in 20 of his last 23 games and has four 20-point efforts during that stretch.\n\nCarmelo Anthony had 21 points for the Nuggets, who equaled their longest winning streak since a seven-game stretch from Nov. 18-Dec. 2, 1989. They improved to 30-29 and went over .500 for the first time since Dec. 21 (13-12).\n\nThe Nuggets have made up 61/2 games on the Lakers for the eighth and final Western Conference playoff berth, and have tied them with 23 games remaining."
