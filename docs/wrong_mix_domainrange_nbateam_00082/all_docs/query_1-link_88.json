        "text": "If you missed the Western Conference or need an explanation about what the heck’s going on with these predictions, click here.\n\nYesterday, we looked at the Western Conference and what it would be like if their records were drawn from a hat. Today brings the Eastern Conference and scenarios for each team according to the record they drew. Let’s begin:\n\nTeam #1: Chicago Bulls\n\nI’m just assuming my first time playing basketball in over a year will be the same as Derrick Rose’s:\n\nRecord from a hat: 46-36\n\nThis is a little weird when Chicago, if anything, has been terrific in the regular season compared to the playoffs.\n\nScenario: In what’s an improved Eastern Conference, coach Thibs swings the other way from his usual allocation of minutes and chooses to rest players to the point of surrendering some tail ends of back-to-backs. Also, Chicago has a little trouble playing around Derrick Rose, who (hopefully) attacks a little less in order to save his body in the long run.\n\nBut Carlos Boozer and Luol Deng regress. Their PERs drop by .1 for every trade rumor they’re involved in.\n\nTeam #2: Orlando Magic\n\nThe winners of the Dwight Howard trade one season later.\n\nRecord from a hat: 43-39\n\nSo much for tanking with Victor Oladipo at point guard.\n\nScenario: The front office flirts with benching the starters for lottery picks but screw it, winning is fun. Orlando gets in a trade with Atlanta:\n\nOrlando receives: Al Horford, Lou Williams\n\nAtlanta receives: Nikola Vucevic, Tobias Harris, Hedo Turkoglu’s expiring contract\n\nThat might be too much to give Atlanta or too little; we won’t know for another season or two when we know more about Harris and Vucevic. Orlando’s offense was terrible without Glen Davis and with Harris though, good for dead last in offensive rating and fifth worst on defense. It’ll be a tad bit better with Al Horford, even if the Hawks were just an average team on offense last season. I’m a pretty terrible trade constructor and player evaluater anyway. It’ll make more sense when Atlanta’s hat drawing comes around.\n\nOladipo at point guard turns out to be a smart decision via the additional wins versus additional lottery balls, Moe Harkless takes his game to another level, Glen Davis will pass on a few mid-range jumpers for once, and everyone will be dancing like Big Baby at the thought of this team making the playoffs:\n\nTeam #3: Milwaukee Bucks\n\nThe most mediocre team in the NBA after getting out of Tankapalooza 2014. In the process, they avoided becoming so bad the motto ‘Tears for the Deer’ won’t be reserved until the next time they trade a blue chipper for an above average veteran.\n\nRecord from the hat: 33-49\n\nScenario: The Bucks struggle when Ersan Ilyasova is taken out of games, O.J. Mayo does O.J. Mayo things (play well for one month and erratic for the rest of the season), and Brandon Knight progresses only ever so slightly.\n\nThey become a League Pass favorite, however, when John Henson and Larry Sanders wreak havoc on defense and whenever Giannis Antetokounmpo steps onto the floor. It’s mandatory the Greek Freak plays for 40 minutes in the Rookie-Sophomore game.\n\nTeam #4: Brooklyn Nets\n\nQuite the contender for my 2014 Time Machine Champion. My next post regarding that fake award will also include 2013’s champ.\n\nRecord from a hat: 19-63\n\nScenario: For all the teams I said would start out bad, Brooklyn actually goes 16-0 before Prokhorov rewards his starting lineup for their strong performance. He gives them a paid vacation around the world. The starting lineup gets lost in South Korea somewhere. All of them become Starcraft whizzes and never return to Brooklyn. The Nets falter. Reggie Evans averages the least-efficient 20 points per game outside of ‘Monta Ball’. Kevin Garnett becomes the most prolific trash talker Starcraft has ever seen.\n\nMeanwhile, Boston and Atlanta lick their chops while looking at the draft picks Brooklyn owes them.\n\nTeam #5: Boston Celtics\n\nTo tank or not to tank?\n\nRecord from a hat: 41-41\n\nScenario: The Celtics keep Rajon Rondo, Jeff Green becomes more consistent with the added responsibility, Gerald Wallace isn’t awful, and Kris Humphries has an F-U season after hearing the news of Kanye proposing to Kim Kardashian. Also, Jordan Crawford becomes eerily similar to his older brother (not the 2012 version of him while in Portland) and Bill Simmons has 8,472 orgasms at the thought of this team making the playoffs.\n\nIn all seriousness, if this happens then Brad Stevens should be a favorite for Coach of the Year. That, or Jeff Green makes the All-Star team or Rondo is a dark horse for the MVP.\n\nTeam #6: Charlotte Bobcats\n\nNot sure how they’ll do here, especially without Al Jefferson for some time.\n\nRecord from a hat: 40-42\n\nScenario: EWING THEORY! Not because of missing Jefferson though — they lost Byron Mullens in the off-season.\n\nAlso, they get in the trade with Memphis I hinted about in the post concerning the Western Conference.\n\nMemphis receives: Ben Gordon ($13.2M expiring), Cody Zeller, and Charlotte’s second round pick\n\nCharlotte receives: Zach Randolph\n\nCharlotte plays themselves out of their own protected draft pick but they still own Portland’s and Detroit’s. Two first round picks plus Kemba Walker, Bismack Biyombo, MKG, Al Jefferson, Zach Randolph, and Jefferson’s and Randolph’s contracts that could both expire after 2015; that’s not the road to a title but it isn’t a terrible one to take for both the short and long-term.\n\nGiving up their first round pick also kills a lot of potential trades for Chicago.\n\nTeam #7: Detroit Pistons\n\nJoe Dumars hopes the free agent splurge of 2013 is more effective than that of 2009.\n\nRecord from a hat: 59-23\n\nSuccess!\n\nScenario: I mentioned a Dirk Nowitzki trade in the Western Conference post. Detroit jumped in on that. Here’s my terrible trade idea to get them to 59 wins:\n\nDallas receives: Greg Monroe (assuming he signs an extension), Charlie Villanueva ($8.6M expiring), Rodney Stuckey ($8.5M expiring), Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Jonas Jerebko, Detroit’s 2018 first-round pick.\n\nDetroit receives: Dirk Nowitzki, Shawn Marion\n\nThat could be too much for Detroit to give when Dirk’s prime is winding down and Monroe is just getting started, but one’s a former MVP while the other may become an All-Star though not as frequently as Nowitzki. One is a rental for a title run and the other is a building block that’s about to get expensive to keep.\n\nMonroe is looking to get near the max in his next contract, which is kind of a problem if Andre Drummond is in their long term future with Josh Smith. Predicting a trade isn’t that outlandish, though getting Nowitzki in return is a bit of a stretch. But that’s what the hat predicts in order for Detroit to win 59 games and Dallas to win 16.\n\nThe Pistons are going to be all right with Monroe, but Dirk makes them a top-5 offense. Fab Melo could start at shooting guard for all I care, but Chauncey Billups may get the nod. Meanwhile, Andre Drummond logs 30 minutes for 75 games and destroys the Rookie-Sophomore game.\n\nAnd this all works out because Brandon Jennings buys in. If that’s not believable I don’t know what is.\n\nTeam #8: Miami Heat\n\nThree straight Finals appearances, back-to-back championships and Mario Chalmers hasn’t even hit his prime.\n\nRecord from a hat: 55-27\n\nScenario: The Heat coast a ton, possibly too much for their own good as they lose home court advantage throughout the playoffs. With a stronger Eastern Conference, winning around 60 games isn’t that big of a stretch.\n\nDwayne Wade has another 20-5-5 type season, but he’ll play 70 games (good for 75 if he doesn’t rest in April) whereas some may predict more around 60. Chris Bosh and Shane Battier might break in half if Miami plays two straight series versus any combo of Indiana, Chicago or Brooklyn but they’ll survive the regular season.\n\nWith the crazy records being predicted, this is the most vulnerable LeBron James has been concerning winning the MVP.\n\nTeam #9: Philadelphia 76ers\n\nIn the Western Conference post, the hat foresaw a trade sending Russell Westbrook, Kendrick Perkins, and Hasheem Thabeet to Philadelphia in exchange for Evan Turner, Thaddeus Young, Spencer Hawes, Kwame Brown, and the Pelicans’ first round pick.\n\nRecord from a hat: 55-27\n\nScenario: Russell Westbrook goes in total F-U mode, flirting with the top five in MVP voting, and Royce White plays every game and is awesome, like a 15-8-4 line every night. That’s just one of several reaches.\n\nJason Richardson loses 30 pounds when he realizes this team is going to make the playoffs. Also, Nerlens Noel DOES come back to play this season when the Sixers go from tanking to not only chasing the playoffs but nabbing home court for a round or two. A Noel-Thabeet-Perkins rotation somehow doesn’t turn out to be terrible.\n\nBut to win 55 games the 76ers will also have to sign a couple players to ten-day contracts who end up as possible all-stars. That’s about as likely as anything else I’ve said about this team.\n\nTeam #10: Indiana Pacers\n\nLast season the Pacers had a bench thinner than Rip Hamilton yet were one game away from playing in the Finals. Was it all a fluke?\n\nRecord from a hat: 46-36\n\nScenario: Danny Granger has trouble fitting in with the Pacers’ offense, Roy Hibbert isn’t exactly the one we saw in the Eastern Conference Finals, and Luis Scola—one of their best additions this summer—continues to regress even though he’s not starting anymore.\n\nThat all could happen, or there’s this: The Pacers miss Tyler Hansbrough. So much. And just aren’t the same without him.\n\nTeam #11: Toronto Raptors\n\nNew management and a new global ambassador in, um, Drake. Will it be enough to make the playoffs?\n\nRecord from a hat: 60-22\n\nScenario: Inspired by Drake, the 2016 All-Star bid, and dedicating the season to Raptor, the Raptors come out smoking through a tough November schedule. Struggling early on might lead to Rudy Gay and DeMar DeRozan being shipped, but both turn into mid-range gods. (With consistent three-point shooting too!)\n\nRudy Gay has the most notable improvement of the two though as he can, like, finally see the damn hoop now after eye surgery. This leads to his first appearance in the All-Star Game.\n\nToronto’s starting lineup has been notoriously effective and it will have another huge season, but the bench steps up as well. Terrence Ross continues to be an intriguing talent despite the limited time available to him and another guard Toronto trades for.\n\nThat’s where Vince Carter comes in! Getting shipped to Toronto in exchange for Steve Novak. He won’t play much, but is along for the playoff run that Toronto is headed for. Will he jinx the franchise he tanked for in his last season there or will the reigning boos whenever he plays there turn into heaps of joy in the postseason? Is that trade my biggest reach yet despite 90% of these predictions never happening?\n\nTeam #12: Atlanta Hawks\n\nAfter trading Al Horford for Nikola Vucevic, Tobias Harris, Hedo Turkoglu’s expiring and a first round pick, Atlanta scores a record of…\n\nRecord from a hat: 28-54\n\nScenario: Atlanta just can’t go 28-54 without a trade or injury occurring. Because I hate predicting injuries I went with the former. Trading Horford in any scenario is a sign to build towards the future than present. It also helps when Paul Millsap is on such a fair, short deal. He, Harris, Vucevic, and Elton Brand make for some intriguing possibilities in their frontline, at least on offense.\n\nTrading only Horford is pretty generous if the Hawks rebuild. Their entire roster should be on the plate this season regardless if things go south.\n\nSince Atlanta also owns Brooklyn’s pick, the hat’s predictions puts the Hawks in the race for Andrew Wiggins.\n\nTeam #13: Washington Wizards\n\nRecord from a hat: 28-54\n\nScenario: It doesn’t help that Emeka Okafor is going to miss a good chunk, if not all of this season with a herniated disc in his neck. And then there’s Nene, whose feet might fall off at any moment. The options to replace them are dicey with Jan Vesely, Kevin Seraphin and Al Harrington (even if he made my 2014 Dream Team).\n\nBut there’s major upside in their backcourt. John Wall and Bradley Beal will be terrific with Wall chasing his first All-Star Game, but there’s not much else there if the frontline is depleted with injuries. Randy Wittman will be on the hot seat and probably fired if the Wizards do indeed go just 28-54.\n\nTeam #14: Cleveland Cavaliers\n\n(Deep breath.)\n\nRecord from a hat: 60-22\n\n!!!\n\nIt’s like they won the lottery.\n\nScenario: Bynum and Irving, lots and lots of healthy Andrew Bynum–the one Shaq thought was the best center in the NBA–and Kyrie Irving.\n\nTristan Thompson becomes something of a switch hitter: Shooting left-handed jump shots on the right side of the court and righties on the left side. Dion Waiters scores in an odd, efficient way and becomes more of an appetizing prospect than, say, Harrison Barnes. Anthony Bennett makes the best of the times Jarrett Jack passes to him and C.J. Miles makes his threes like he’s paid to do, which has been b a rarity throughout his career.\n\nAll of this and the hat’s prediction on the Cavs makes Kyrie Irving a favorite to win MVP.\n\nTeam #15: New York Knicks\n\nSo many weird ingredients in the hot steamy bowl that is the Knicks.\n\nRecord from a hat: 54-28\n\nScenario: I have to bullet this:\n\nSomehow, this whole squad gets along which helps Mike Woodson resist the temptation to have a flask in his inner suit pocket.\n\nTyson Chandler stays healthy and remains a top-three candidate for Defensive Player of the Year.\n\nAmar’e Stoudemire plays more than 15 games for 15 minutes per game. His per-36 numbers, at least on offense, will be good stat porn.\n\nEvery time Andrea Bargnani scores 20 points, every fan at MSG gets free pasta at a nearby, um, pasta restaurant. We’ll find out which one Bargnani stars in a commercial for soon enough.\n\nRaymond Felton resists the temptation to eat as many Knicks fan’s pasta bowls as possible, chooses to stay in shape.\n\nRecap\n\nCleveland Cavaliers 60-22\n\nToronto Raptors 60-22\n\nDetroit Pistons 59-23\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers 55-27\n\nMiami Heat 55-27\n\nNew York Knicks 54-28\n\nChicago Bulls 46-36\n\nIndiana Pacers 44-38\n\nOrlando Magic 43-39\n\nBoston Celtics 41-41\n\nCharlotte Bobcats 40-42\n\nMilwaukee Bucks 33-49\n\nAtlanta Hawks 28-54\n\nWashington Wizards 28-54\n\nBrooklyn Nets 19-63\n\nSo many sites are coming out with their own rankings of NBA players and teams. Now, it’s time for Chicken Noodle Hoop to join in.\n\nI did plenty of homework on each team before realizing a more accurate prediction could be done from the drawing of a hat, so that’s what I did. I put 30 different folded pieces of paper with all the teams listed in one hat and 30 different win-loss records in another. Most of the records come from my first stab at the 2014 standings, though those predictions are no match for ones from a couple of hats.\n\nAfter knowing every record of every team, I created a scenario for how each team’s season would play out according to the record they drew. Most of the time it caused me to throw logic out the window, which was shocking. I had higher hopes. Maybe a simulator from a computer program would’ve been the better choice, maybe not.\n\nIt’s too late now. The results from the hats are in and here they are, starting with the Western Conference.\n\nTeam #1: Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nHow ironic. My local team is drawn first.\n\nRecord from a hat: 41-41\n\nScenario: This is a likely result with their current roster, which is nice because I don’t have to predict any wild trades or injuries right off the bat. The latter is something I hate doing in general. The former is something I flat-out suck at.\n\nBut the Wolves should get what looks like a healthy, dominant 23-point 13-rebound Kevin Love back with a collection of wings who can, like, actually shoot the ball. They could perform a handful of wins better or worse depending on:\n\nTheir health, especially from Love, Ricky Rubio, and Nikola Pekovic.\n\nWhether they keep from becoming a bottom-5 defensive unit.\n\nWhether or not they score at a top-10 mark.\n\nEven if they only manage an eighth seed, Minnesota should be a pain to take out in the playoffs with their high-octane offense.\n\nTeam #2: Oklahoma City Thunder\n\nHeading into 2014, the Thunder find themselves with a depleted bench and an increasingly crowded Western Conference.\n\nRecord from a hat: 25-57\n\nTwo teams in and the shit hits the fan.\n\nScenario: Despite a soft schedule without Russell Westbrook, the Thunder stumble. The bench is worse than Portland’s last year, Kendrick Perkins gets eviscerated on both sides of the court, the young upstarts for Oklahoma City take a step back in their progression, and Serge Ibaka takes three steps back in his own progression. The more OKC slumps, the more weight Ibaka gains and he gains A LOT of weight (so does Hasheem Thabeet). He also burns his shooting hand one halftime trying to eat a hot pocket with his bare hands. The mid-range jumpshot he worked so hard to master falters. Oklahoma City goes 8-23 heading into 2014.\n\nThe chemistry on this team becomes a mess, a far cry from what it was like two seasons ago. Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook, who’ve performed just fine, complain to the media about the moves made over the last two years, the lack of a sophisticated offense, and Ibaka’s Get-Heavier-than-Washed-Up-Shaq diet. Management flirts with amnesty candidates until Russell Westbrook requests to be the one let go, even though that’s not really possible. He wants to start all over in Philadelphia, creating this poo-poo trade:\n\nOklahoma City sends: Russell Westbrook, Kendrick Perkins, Hasheem Thabeet.\n\nPhiladelphia sends: Thaddeus Young, Evan Turner, Spencer Hawes, Kwame Brown, and New Orleans’ 2014 first-rounder (top 5-protected). (Miami owns Philly’s protected 2014 first-rounder and Orlando owns their protected #1 in 2016.)\n\nTo make the trade somewhat fair, let’s say Turner and Young were pretty damn good with their opportunity in Philadelphia. You’ll see how this all plays out for the 76ers later.\n\nFor the Thunder, their offense suffocates. Durant averages 35 per game but on so-so (for him) splits of 46-37-85. Hawes and Ibaka don’t mesh well, Turner and Young can’t adapt to the role as OKC’s sixth and seventh men even with a pick-and-roll partner in Nick Collison, and Scott Brooks elects Kwame Brown to become his assistant coach rather than let him drag his ass up and down the floor 30 seconds per game. When Brooks gets fired for starting both Hawes and Ibaka, Kwame becomes the head coach. It’s a disaster. Well, you already know that since they finish 25-57.\n\nBut they do have their draft pick and New Orleans’. Also, there’s a pretty good chance none of this ever happens.\n\nTeam #3: Dallas Mavericks\n\nMark Cuban went through another summer of whiffing on prized free agents but landed a haul that at least wasn’t terrible. Is it enough to put Dirk Nowitzki and the Mavericks back into the postseason?\n\nRecord from a hat: 16-66\n\nScenario: After a really, really bad start, Dallas decides to blow it up by shopping Dirk Nowitzki and Shawn Marion. A team out East (to be revealed in the Eastern Conference post) will get in a trade, sending a blue chipper, expirings, another young prospect, and a draft pick back to the Mavs. Also, Vince Carter will be shipped to a former team of his in exchange for an aging spot shooter. Unfortunately, nobody bites on Jose Calderon‘s contract.\n\nTank Mode is engaged as Dallas rests Monroe and Calderon, among others, and emphasizes Monta Ball in order to put them in pole position for Andrew Wiggins. It works. Monta Ball is a resounding “success”.\n\nTeam #4: Memphis Grizzlies\n\nRecord from a hat: 42-40\n\nThe West is going to suck this year.\n\nScenario: Memphis does have a new coach, and they’re probably asking for too much of Mike Miller at this stage of his career, but that shouldn’t lead to a 14-win drop off. Other explanations could be nagging injuries and/or a desperation trade to get out of a large, guaranteed contract in exchange for expirings and draft picks.\n\nIn that case, a trade will go down with a team out East who, over the summer, made a surprising ascension from the bottom of the standings to possibly chasing a playoff bid. For Memphis, it doesn’t work out as planned and it doesn’t put their trading partner in the playoffs either. Shucks. More details about it in the post devoted to the Eastern Conference.\n\nRegardless of Memphis’ trade that emphasizes the future, 42-40 will be just enough to make the playoffs out West.\n\nTeam #5: Houston Rockets\n\nWill the Rockets blast off into contention?\n\nRecord from a hat: 52-30\n\nThey will! Finally, a sane pick from the hat that doesn’t force me to explore trades or stoop low enough to predict injuries.\n\nScenario: Dwight Howard will get his post ups, but sooner or later will have to run pick & roll. (Just put up with it, Dwight, and you can shoot as many free throws with your eyes closed as you want.) Omer Asik will definitely be trade bait but for the love of God please don’t trade Chandler Parsons he’s so hot right now.\n\nIt’s too bad New Orleans is in a race to get good right now. They don’t need a center like Asik right this minute but it’s a good fit if they want to make the playoffs versus rebuilding. More on this when the Pelicans are drawn.\n\nFor Houston, 52-30 seems about right in real life, give or take a few wins.\n\nTeam #6: Portland Trail Blazers\n\nA (cheaply) revamped bench, two potential all-stars in Damian Lillard and LaMarcus Aldridge; where will the hat place them this year?\n\nRecord from a hat: 54-28\n\n!!!\n\nScenario: The Blazers shore up their defense with Lillard and Batum making the most vast improvements on that end. Part of that also comes with an improved bench, even if C.J. McCollum misses a couple months.\n\nThomas Robinson becomes a candidate for the Sixth Man and Most Improved Player of the Year awards. Pairing him with Aldridge and Dorell Wright in the frontcourt becomes ridiculously effective on offense and not a massacre on defense. Portland also gets more out of Meyers Leonard in his second year, as well as every ounce of Mo Williams that he has left. McCollum comes back from injury and is efficient right off the bat. Also, they benefit from the hat’s predicted downfall of Dallas, Oklahoma City, and Memphis.\n\nIn real-life, Portland will be an exciting team to watch. Clearly the hat thinks so too.\n\nTeam #7: Sacramento Kings\n\nNew ownership, new arena in the future, and new bad contracts!\n\nRecord from a hat: 36-46\n\nScenario: As bad as this team was last year, they still won 28 games. Now, DeMarcus Cousins plays up to his raise. There’s also the addition by subtraction in Tyreke Evans and the progression in Isaiah Thomas that injects some much-needed success from a franchise that hasn’t had much to cheer for since…um…did Metta World Peace really lead this team to the playoffs in 2006?\n\nTeam #8: Phoenix Suns\n\nWill Eric Bledsoe trick the hat into believing the Suns are a 64-18 squad?\n\nRecord from a hat: 17-65\n\nScenario: Eric Bledsoe will be a statistical freak, but it won’t translate to running a team well enough to even get over 20 wins. Also, the Suns keep Goran Dragic. Hm.\n\nMarcin “Too Hot To” Gortat, on the other hand, is a more complicated matter. The teams who need a guy like Gortat don’t have the most desirable players who match up salary-wise. He ends up shipped to New Orleans for Ryan Anderson instead of the Pelicans trading Anderson to Houston. This way, Anderson gets dealt to a rebuilding team versus a contender and the Suns have several picks to offer. I doubt they’d throw one of their first rounders in the deal, but they could pony up a second round pick.\n\nTeam #9: Los Angeles Clippers\n\nA favorite of mine to dominate the regular season only to flame out in the second round. Will the hat think the same?\n\nRecord from a hat: 56-26\n\nPossibly.\n\nScenario: Jared Dudley and J.J. Redick fit in just fine and losing Bledsoe isn’t that big of a blow when the Clippers signed Darren Collison on the cheap.\n\nThe problems lie in their frontcourt. Who can be trusted in the fourth quarter in a Game 7? Who’s going to stop Marc Gasol, Tim Duncan, or Dwight Howard? B.J. Mullens sure isn’t. DeAndre Jordan had an impressive pre-season, but that’s nothing new. In the hat’s scenario, Doc won’t be able to get more consistency out of Jordan or Mullens, even though it would’ve gone a long way, possibly past the second round.\n\nTeam #10: New Orleans Pelicans\n\nAh, the Pistons of the West as far as crazy off-seasons are concerned. Will their gambles work out?\n\nRecord from a hat: 33-49\n\nBummer. Anthony Davis has been awesome in the pre-season too. The progression to an All-Star from Year 1 to Year 2 is a lot to ask for, but if anyone can do it it’s the lock for the #1 pick in the 2012 Draft before the lottery balls even played out.\n\nBut there’s the defense and the backcourt to worry about. If Tyreke Evans, Eric Gordon, and Jrue Holiday don’t work out together they could end up with what Chris Paul had to deal with in his last two years: An overpaid, mediocre supporting cast. There’s also the chase for a center when the Pelicans could keep Ryan Anderson and wait another year before searching for a big man to play alongside Davis, but they need to win now.\n\nIt’s too bad. There was a lot to be excited for when the Pelicans landed the first pick in the 2012 Draft, but then everything after drafting Anthony Davis happened. They can still be dangerous down the road, but so much needs to go right.\n\nScenario: The Brow’s progression from Year 1 to Year 2, from Rookie of the Year candidate to All-Star, is just one step in the right direction. However, the hat predicts a step back for Holiday, Evans, and Gordon. I actually think all three of those guys are better than what they’ve shown so far in their careers, but to have them all on the same team could be a bit much.\n\nTeam #11: Los Angeles Lakers\n\nUh oh.\n\nRecord from a hat: 45-37\n\n…\n\nScenario: Kobe Bryant throws in his best performance since 2006? Wes Johnson resembles something of a basketball player? Nick Young is a candidate for the Sixth Man of the Year? Pau Gasol goes back to being Pau Gasol even with Mike D’Antoni at the helm? Steve Nash excels in D’Antoni’s system? Chris Kaman makes a few jump shots? The Lakers stay out of the bottom five in defensive efficiency? And Kobe remains content around the media and on Twitter? Of course he would if he’s playing like it’s 2006 and they make the playoffs?\n\nHopefully the hat doesn’t predict a title?\n\nTeam #12: Golden State Warriors\n\nRecord from a hat: 43-39\n\nThis isn’t the most ridiculous prediction ever. The Warriors went 47-35 last year and a lot of this season depends on Bogut’s health. There still isn’t much behind him in terms of solid offense and rim protection, though a Jermaine O’Neal resurgence would be nice.\n\nScenario: (Sigh) Nagging injuries from both Stephen Curry and Andrew Bogut, stalled progression from Harrison Barnes and Klay Thompson, and missing the likes of Jarrett Jack and Carl Landry from last year’s squad is enough for the Warriors to underwhelm in 2014.\n\nBut, 43-39 is enough to make the playoffs in the hat’s NBA world. The real-life Warriors should duplicate their 2013 record if not snag home court advantage for at least one round of the playoffs.\n\nTeam #13: Denver Nuggets\n\nOne of the most unpredictable teams in the league this season thanks to their reliance on JaVale McGee. If only Kenneth Faried was seven feet tall with a jump shot.\n\nRecord from a hat: 52-30\n\nCome. On. This is the same team that allowed 36 points to Kevin Durant and then 40 to Chris Paul. It’s only the pre-season, but still.\n\nClearly, the friggin’ hat disagrees.\n\nScenario: JaVale makes the major improvements we’ve hoped for all these years, becoming a consistently feared rim protector for 36 minutes in the process. It would also help Denver if they got the really good version of Nate Robinson instead of really bad, but this could be a game-by-game thing.\n\nTeam #14: Utah Jazz\n\nThe new home for Andris Biedrins and Richard Jefferson!\n\nRecord from a hat: 18-64\n\nScenario: This seems close enough to their real life record, but the Jazz should be better than Phoenix. They’re like the Western Conference’s version of the Orlando Magic: a lot of young intriguing pieces, only the Jazz have to make decisions soon on who they want to keep long-term. They already locked up Derrick Favors. How that dictates how much Enes Kanter makes will be intriguing. Can they keep them both past next season?\n\nTeam #15: San Antonio Spurs\n\nLet’s see if the hat is more kind to the Spurs than Ray Allen was to them in the Finals:\n\nRecord from a hat: 37-45\n\nDid everyone retire halfway through the season?\n\nScenario: Everyone retired halfway through the season.\n\nRecap\n\nLos Angeles Clippers (56-26)\n\nPortland Trail Blazers (54-28)\n\nHouston Rockets (52-30)\n\nDenver Nuggets (52-30)\n\nLos Angeles Lakers (45-37)\n\nGolden State Warriors (43-39)\n\nMemphis Grizzlies (42-40)\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves (41-41)\n\nSan Antonio Spurs (37-45)\n\nSacramento Kings (36-46)\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans (33-49)\n\nOklahoma City Thunder (25-57)\n\nUtah Jazz (18-64)\n\nPhoenix Suns (17-65)\n\nDallas Mavericks (16-66)\n\nStay tuned for even more bizarre predictions featuring the Eastern Conference."
