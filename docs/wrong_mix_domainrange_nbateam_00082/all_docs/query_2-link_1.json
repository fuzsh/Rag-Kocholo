        "text": "1. Where are the points going to come from?\n\nGerald Wallace (16.6), Boris Diaw (15.1), and Raymond Felton (14.2) led the Bobcats last season, who averaged an NBA low of 93.6 ppg.\n\nI don’t think Felton will be the starter at point on opening night. I doubt if he will even be in Charlotte.\n\nCharlotte needs more from the shooting guard position, and Bell can be the answer. But he was injured a lot last season.\n\nThere is a lack of quality free-agent shooting guards this offseason, so I see them getting a SG through the draft.\n\n2. What positions to focus on this offseason?\n\nShooting Guard and Power Forward. There are plenty of PF available through free agency, and some good quality SG through the draft that will be available at the 12th spot.\n\nCharlotte should use the first round of the draft to focus on the best player that fits their system. If it fills a needed position, then that is great. There aren’t many centers available and that is not one of their needs, so they should go after the best player.\n\n3. Who are some free agents Charlotte should be targeting?\n\nBobby Jackson, PG Sacramento – If Felton is traded, Augustin will need some help.\n\nMatt Barnes, F Phoenix – Could help at both the SF and PF position\n\nDrew Gooden, PF San Antonio – Add some much needed depth at PF. He would be a banger behind Diaw.\n\nShawn Marion, F Toronto – Would add instant offense, but I'm not sure Diaw would want to play behind Marion again.\n\nCarlos Boozer, PF Utah – Duke grad who would be a great addition to this team.\n\nIme Udoka, SF San Antonio – I would go after Udoka if the Outlaw trade doesn’t happen.\n\nSheldon Williams, PF Minnesota – Another Duke grad to have a presence at the Four.\n\nAntonio McDyess, PF Detroit – A Larry Brown favorite would be a role player.\n\nBrandon Bass, F Dallas – Would be a good fit at a low cost.\n\nWally Szczerbiak, G Cleveland – Added insurance in case Bell gets injured.\n\nBen Gordan, SG Chicago – Add instant scoring, solid defender.\n\nJoe Smith, PF Cleveland – Another good depth player.\n\n4. Who should Charlotte target with the 12th pick?\n\nIf they win the lottery on Tuesday, they should take Blake Griffin (PF), Ricky Rubio (PG), and Jordan Hill (PF)—in that order. But the chances of landing one of the top three is less than one percent, so they are likely going to be drafting at the 12th position.\n\nHere are some options for the Bobcats:\n\nGerald Henderson, SG, Duke\n\nTerrence Williams, SG/SF Louisville\n\nDejuan Blair, PF Pittsburgh\n\nJames Johnson, F Wake\n\nStephen Curry, SG Davidson\n\nTyreke Evens, SG Memphis\n\nWayne Ellington, SG North Carolina\n\n5. Will Charlotte’s off-season lead to its first playoff?\n\nCharlotte can fairly close before falling back the last week of the season. They are coming off the best season in team history.\n\nDepending on what happens during the offseason, I think Charlotte will be playing in the postseason next year.\n\n6. What offseason moves should they make?\n\nPG – Re-sign Raymond Felton, draft a third point guard.\n\nSG – Sign Ben Gordon\n\nSF – Sign Ime Udoka\n\nPF – Sign Shawn Marion, re-sign Sean May.\n\nC – Trade Nazr Mohammed for a draft pick.\n\nDo whatever it takes to draft Tyreke Evans or Stephen Curry with the first round draft pick.\n\nDraft some international players to keep in Europe with the second round picks, unless they are used to trade up.\n\nThis would give them an opening-day lineup of:\n\nPG – DJ Augustin / Raymond Felton / Evans or Curry\n\nSG – Raja Bell / Ben Gordon\n\nSF – Gerald Wallace / Vladimir Radmanovic / Ime Udoka\n\nPF – Shawn Marion / Boris Diaw / Sean May\n\nC – Emeka Okafor / Diop / Ajinca\n\nPotential players traded at the trade deadline include Felton, Radmanovic, May.\n\n7. What offseason moves are likely to take place?\n\nRaymond Felton will either be re-signed or traded.\n\nMy projection is that Felton, along with the second-round pick, will be traded to Portland for Travis Outlaw, Sergio Rodriguez, and their second-round pick.\n\nSean May will re-sign for a year or two, if nothing else to be traded in the near future.\n\nSingletary, Jefferson, Howard, and Martin will not be re-signed.\n\nWith the 12th pick in the 2009, the Charlotte Bobcats will select Gerald Henderson out of Duke University.\n\nPG – DJ Augustin / Sergio Rodriguez\n\nSG – Raja Bell / Gerald Henderson\n\nSF – Gerald Wallace / Vladimir Radmanovic / Travis Outlaw\n\nPF – Boris Diaw / Antonio McDyess / Sean May"
