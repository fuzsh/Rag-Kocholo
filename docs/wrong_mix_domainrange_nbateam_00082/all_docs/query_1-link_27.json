        "text": "Antoine Walker hasn’t had a job in the NBA for nearly 21 months. He doesn’t have a known invite to an NBA training camp, either, with just two weeks to go before most teams are scheduled to assemble for Practice No. 1 of the new season. But Walker does have a former college teammate and very close friend that plays for the Charlotte Bobcats, whose new owner isn’t just a living legend but another longtime Walker pal. So it certainly made some sense when word reached Stein Line HQ on Sunday night that Toine is expected to arrive in Charlotte this week to stay with Bobcats center Nazr Mohammed, his buddy and fellow Kentucky Wildcat, and join in daily pickup games at the Bobcats’ facility leading up to the start of camp on Sept. 28.\n\nChico estimates Antoine has dropped between 18 and 25 pounds as he continues to improve his conditioning under Pitino‘s watch. “Four to six” teams, he said, have already expressed interest in the forward, who is fighting to land an NBA roster spot for the first time since 2008 when he received a buyout from the Grizzlies. Antoine Walker is also fighting to shed a negative image, one that led to being released from his most recent team, the Mets de Guaynabo in Puerto Rico. “Initially it was extremely, extremely tough for him,” Chico said. “He tried to go to Puerto Rico, try to get away from it, but it followed him there as well. That wasn’t good for his surroundings over there. … It was just a little bit too much negative publicity that the team didn’t want to deal with, and he understood that.”\n\n“He’s definitely looking to go into training camp, but he knows it’s not going to be a guaranteed contract,” said Chico. “He’s going to have to go in and make a team, and he understands that. That’s where he is in terms of his conditioning. He knows he has to go in there and earn a spot. Nothing’s going to be given to him regardless of what he’s done in the past. “I think the main concern is that this other stuff is going to follow him around. Is that going to be a deterring factor for a lot of teams? Hopefully not because basketball-wise, I still think he has a little bit to give to the game. But he has to go in and he has to show that. Nothing’s going to be given to him at this point.”\n\nChico Walker saw a different side of his nephew this Fourth of July weekend. It wasn’t a three-time All-Star shimmying on the court. It wasn’t the centerpiece of several legal troubles, either. Instead he saw Antoine Walker, a humbled athlete fighting to overcome his lapses in judgment and restart his NBA career at age 34. “He said, ‘I made a lot of mistakes,’” Chico Walker, a former member of the Red Sox, recalled during Alumni Day at Fenway Park. “[He said,] ‘I made a lot of mistakes and I trusted the wrong people. I realized going forward I have to have positive people around me, just in life period. I have to have a lot of positive people around.’ And I think now he gets it.”"
