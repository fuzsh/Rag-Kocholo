Marion finished his career as a four-time NBA All-Star and a one-time NBA champion, helping the Dallas Mavericks win their maiden title in 2011. Nicknamed \"The Matrix\" by former NBA player Kenny Smith during the preseason of his rookie year, he was widely regarded as one of the most versatile players in the league because of his athleticism and ability to play and defend many positions. He was also known for his unorthodox shooting form. On December 18, 2012 against the Phoenix Suns, Marion eclipsed the 16,000-point plateau, becoming the 95th player in league history with at least 16,000 career points. He joined Hakeem Olajuwon, Karl Malone and Kevin Garnett as the only players in NBA history with at least 16,000 points, 9,000 rebounds, 1,500 steals and 1,000 blocks. On January 27, 2013 against Phoenix, Marion played in his 1,000th NBA game, becoming the 107th player in NBA history to reach the milestone. On March 6, 2013 against the Houston Rockets, Marion passed Rod Strickland for 25th place on the NBA's all-time steals list. On January 3, 2014 against the Los Angeles Clippers, Marion passed the 17,000-point mark and joined Olajuwon, Malone and Garnett as the only players with at least 17,000 points, 9,000 rebounds, 1,500 steals and 1,000 blocks. For the 2013â€“14 season, Marion posted a career-low 13.4 PER, struggled with consistency on offense, and struggled defensively at times."
