        "text": "The Suns traded guard Raja Bell and forward Boris Diaw to the Charlotte Bobcats on Wednesday as part of a deal that brings high-scoring swingman Jason Richardson to Phoenix.\n\nRookie point guard Sean Singletary also went to Charlotte, while the Suns got small forward Jared Dudley and a 2010 second-round draft pick.\n\n\"We felt like we needed to shake things up a little bit,\" said Suns general manager Steve Kerr, whose team is 13-9. \"We wanted to add a great scorer in the backcourt to give us better balance to take some of the pressure off of Steve [Nash].\"\n\nRichardson is averaging 18.7 points this season, just below his career maker of 18.8. A two-time winner of the NBA's slam dunk contest, the six-foot-six Michigan State product is shooting a sizzling .458 from three-point range, a big improvement on his career rate of .365.\n\n\"When you try to get better, you're going to lose some assets,\" Charlotte coach Larry Brown said. \"We're losing a pretty darn good player and the way Phoenix is trying to make their team, they just added an unbelievable piece.\"\n\nBell, who earned NBA first-team all-defensive honours in 2006-07 and made the second team last season, wasn't happy with the Suns' switch from the high-flying style of former coach Mike D'Antoni to the more deliberate approach of Terry Porter.\n\nThe hard-nosed guard is averaging 9.6 points this season, down from 11.9 in 2007-08 and 14.7 in each of the two previous campaigns.\n\nThe versatile Diaw had seen his playing time dwindle behind Amare Stoudemire. Averaging 8.3 points, he's making $9 million US this season and has three more years left on his contract.\n\nWednesday's trade is the latest move by Kerr in remaking a team that reached the Western Conference final in 2005 and 2006 but hasn't made it past the second round since. Last season, Kerr dealt versatile forward Shawn Marion to the Miami Heat for mammoth centre Shaquille O'Neal in an effort to give fast-paced Phoenix a more physical presence."
