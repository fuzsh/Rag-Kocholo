        "text": "The Charlotte Bobcats were just a blip on the radar for the Phoenix Suns.\n\nThe Suns jumped all over the Bobcats, beating them 120-105 last night for a franchise record 28th road victory.\n\nNow, it's on to Miami, for a Friday night showdown with the Heat with the NBA's best record at stake.\n\n\"This is a game we've been waiting for,\" Phoenix coach Mike D'Antoni said. \"It's big for us, because if we win it, we get the tiebreaker.\"\n\nThe Suns beat Miami 122-107 in Phoenix on Jan. 11.\n\nShawn Marion had 26 points and 10 rebounds to lead the Suns, who are now 28-7 on the road. That bests the mark of 27-14 set in 1993 and 1995. The victory was also Phoenix's ninth straight on the road, which tied the club record.\n\nTo make it 10 in a row, the Suns will have to win in Miami. So even though they were playing the Bobcats, it was hard not to look ahead.\n\n\"It's going to be a big-time game,\" said Amare Stoudemire, who had 23 points and 14 rebounds. \"Even though we take it one game at a time, that game has definitely been lingering in the back of our minds.\"\n\nJoe Johnson scored 26 points for the Suns. Jim Jackson scored 15 and Steve Nash finished with 11 points, 10 assists and no turnovers.\n\nIt was clear from the opening tip that the Suns are a far better team than the expansion Bobcats, who trailed by double digits less eight minutes into the game.\n\nBULLS 94, RAPTORS 85: Eddy Curry scored 16 points and Chicago defeated Toronto for the eighth straight time, beating the Raptors.\n\nRookie Andres Nocioni added 10 points and eight rebounds for the Bulls, who have won three straight overall.\n\nChicago led by as many as 21 points, but Toronto got back in contention by taking advantage of seven turnovers in the fourth quarter. The Raptors used a 12-1 run to close within eight points, but Antonio Davis' three-point play pushed the Bulls advantage back to 91-80 with 3:56 left.\n\nTyson Chandler pumped his fist after giving the Bulls an 11-point lead with 2:12 left. Jalen Rose scored 30 points for Toronto, which shot a season-low 32 percent.\n\nPACERS 100, SPURS 93: Reggie Miller continued his late-season resurgence by scoring 21 points and becoming the 13th player in league history with 25,000 career points, and Austin Croshere added 18 points and four rebounds to lead the short-handed Pacers past San Antonio 100-93.\n\nSan Antonio (50-18) lost its third straight despite having five players reach double figures. The Spurs were led by Brent Barry with 17 points but clearly missed Tim Duncan who is out with a sprained right ankle.\n\nTIMBERWOLVES 107, HORNETS 102: Kevin Garnett had 24 points and 13 rebounds and Eddie Griffin came up with some key plays down the stretch to help Minnesota hold off pesky New Orleans.\n\nAfter New Orleans scored six straight points to pull within five in the fourth quarter, Griffin hit two free throws and converted a three-point play to give the Wolves a 97-89 lead with just over four minutes to play.\n\nGriffin finished with 12 points and 10 rebounds for the Timberwolves, who didn't trail for the second straight game, though New Orleans did make things interesting for most of the second half.\n\nJamaal Magloire led the Hornets with 20 points and 17 rebounds and J.R. Smith added 20 points and seven assists, but it wasn't enough to keep New Orleans from losing for the seventh time in nine games."
