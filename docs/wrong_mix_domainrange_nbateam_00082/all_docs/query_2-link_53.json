        "text": "Slim as the chance might be, the Phoenix Suns aren't giving up on catching Dallas for the best record in the NBA. Of bigger concern, though, is their sluggish, uninspired play of late.\n\nThe Suns are 8-1 since the All-Star break, but they are not playing with the trademark pedal-to-the-metal style they know they need to win an NBA title.\n\nAnd the Phoenix motto for this season, plastered on billboards around the city, is \"Eyes on the Prize.\"\n\nPhoenix Suns guard Steve Nash, right, is fouled by Charlotte Bobcats forward Gerald Wallace, left, in the fourth quarter of a basketball game Wednesday, March 7, 2007, in Phoenix. The Suns defeated the Bobcats 115-106 in overtime. [AP]\n\n\"I think we got a little fat and happy lately,\" coach Mike D'Antoni said after the team's light workout Thursday. \"We need to get a little leaner and meaner and understand that to win a championship is going to take a little bit more dedication.\"\n\nWith 21 games to play, Phoenix (47-14) trails the Mavericks by 4 1/2 games.\n\n\"I don't think they're out of reach,\" Steve Nash said. \"We play them twice. Who knows what happens?\"\n\nThe Suns won't beat Dallas playing the way they have lately. They had to go to overtime Wednesday night to beat Charlotte team that was without its best player and at the end of a winless six-game road trip.\n\n\"I don't think we have a swagger, that pep in our step or whatever,\" D'Antoni said.\n\nNo one has been more critical than Nash, the NBA's two-time defending MVP who is deadly serious about winning his first league title.\n\n\"We've said it time and time again this year, that we're playing to improve so in the playoffs we're ready to win,\" Nash said. \"If that doesn't sink into guys' heads, then we're not going to win anyway. But our goal every day should be for June.\"\n\nNobody is naming names.\n\n\"I think it's everybody,\" Nash said, \"but obviously some more than others.\"\n\nTalking about revving it up is easy. Translating that onto the court is the Suns' challenge.\n\n\"It's just desire really,\" Nash said, \"just desire, discipline and commitment. If we commit to the goals we've set and have the desire to keep up with that ¡ª if we play like that every night ¡ª we'll be fine. But right now for whatever reason it's not important to us.\"\n\nAnother concern is Amare Stoudemire's growing collection of technical fouls. He drew two in Wednesday night's game and was ejected with 8:10 left in the third quarter. Stoudemire has 14 technicals. Two more and he must set serve a one-game suspension. The penalty grows after that.\n\nStoudemire's technicals are not for blatant abuse of the referees, but officials are under orders to tame on-court behavior. He got one Wednesday for kicking the ball toward the seats just as the first half ended and another for throwing the ball at a Charlotte player. Neither the kick nor throw were at high speed.\n\n\"It's just small-time techs,\" Stoudemire said. \"It's not like I'm cursing or using profanity toward them. They are just small-time techs and they really want to crack down on them.\"\n\nHe knows he must curb his emotions, even though he said that takes the fun out of the game.\n\n\"I heard guys curse at the ref and say all kinds of things to them and don't get a technical,\" Stoudemire said. \"I get a tech for just rolling the basketball. It happens that way. I've got to do a better job of holding my emotions back. I'm such an emotional player my passion comes out at times. It's going to be tough but I can manage.\"\n\nD'Antoni traces the team's funk to the shoulder injury that sidelined Nash for three games heading into the All-Star break. Phoenix lost all three and saw streaking Dallas pulling away. Since then, there have been other lineup changes, with Shawn Marion missing two games with a bruised right hand and, on Wednesday night, Boris Diaw returning after sitting out nine games, and most of a 10th, with back spasms.\n\nDiaw said his back was fine Thursday, finally leaving D'Antoni with his full complement of players.\n\n\"Everybody coming in and out of the lineup has kind of messed us up a little bit,\" D'Antoni said, \"and we just have to get over it. It's not an excuse, it's reality. We need to start playing better. I think guys understand the urgency.\""
