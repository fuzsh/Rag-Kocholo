        "text": "Dwyane Wade scored 41 points, 10 in the final 8 minutes to help the Heat rally in the fourth quarter and beat the Charlotte Bobcats, 100-96, last night in Miami.\n\nMario Chalmers scored 15 and Shawn Marion added 13 points for the Heat, who extended their winning streak to four – their longest in nearly two years.\n\nJason Richardson scored 24 for Charlotte, but missed two free throws that would have tied the game with 32.3 seconds remaining. Emeka Okafor added 19 points and 12 rebounds for the Bobcats, who lost to Miami for only the second time in the teams’ last eight meetings.\n\nThe Bobcats were without starting forward Gerald Wallace, who missed the game because he was in Alabama to mourn the death of his grandmother. Charlotte coach Larry Brown said he expected Wallace to return to the team Friday – meaning the 15.3-point scorer likely will miss games at New Orleans and Dallas later this week.\n\nWithout Wallace, the Charlotte bench did its part to pick up the slack.\n\nD.J. Augustin scored 14 points and Adam Morrison added 13, including a long 3-pointer from the left wing with 6.7 seconds left that drew the Bobcats to 98-96.\n\nBut Wade sealed his night – and the win – with two free throws a half-second later.\n\nMiami was down by seven with 8:21 remaining when Wade went to work, driving the lane for dunks that even left the Bobcats’ bench speechless, leaping over players for rebounds, and finding Marion for a short jumper with 1:01 left that put the Heat ahead to stay.\n\nWarriors 112, Thunder 102 – Andris Biedrins has 17 points and 21 rebounds, and Golden State ended its nine-game losing skid by holding off a late surge led by Kevin Durant and host Oklahoma City.\n\nTwo of the Warriors’ top scorers, Stephen Jackson (20.1 points per game) and Corey Maggette (19.1), sat out with injuries but it didn’t slow their offense. Jamal Crawford scored 19 points, and Brandan Wright and Anthony Morrow each had 15 as Golden State shot 50.6 percent from the field in leading from the opening tip.\n\nDurant scored a season-high 41 and helped Oklahoma rally from 21 down in the fourth quarter, making consecutive 3-pointers to pull the Thunder to 105-102 before dropping their fourth straight.\n\nGrizzlies 109, Rockets 97 – Rudy Gay scored 20 points, Hakim Warrick and O.J. Mayo added 18 points apiece against Houston as Memphis won its second straight at home.\n\nMemphis made its first six 3-pointers to build an early lead and shot 51 percent overall. Gay made 8-of-14 shots and Mayo was 7-of-13.\n\nKyle Lowry had 11 points and five assists, while Mike Conley and Marc Gasol each had 10 points. Gasol and Warrick had eight rebounds apiece for Memphis.\n\nLuis Scola had 16 points and 15 rebounds, and Rafer Alston had 16 points and eight assists for the injury-depleted Rockets. Von Wafer added 15 points, and Yao Ming and Aaron Brooks finished with 14 apiece. Carl Landry had 12 points."
