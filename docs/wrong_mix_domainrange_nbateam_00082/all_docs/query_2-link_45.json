        "text": "Since today is the last day of the regular season, I thought I’d share my postseason awards ballot. This will be my second year voting, and for the second year in a row I’ve found it to be more of a chore than an honor. The actual process is quick and easy. The NBA e-mails you a document that already has the awards separated by category with the spaces for you to type in your vote. Then you e-mail it back. Simple.\n\nBut I’ve stressed over my votes these last two years because there is always someone deserving that ends up left out. For example, they ask you for your top five picks for MVP. Well, my last slot came down to Tim Duncan and LeBron James. Both are deserving. Both mean everything to their teams. After going back and forth for days, I ultimately picked Duncan over James.\n\nWith all that said, here’s how I voted. I welcome your feedback.
