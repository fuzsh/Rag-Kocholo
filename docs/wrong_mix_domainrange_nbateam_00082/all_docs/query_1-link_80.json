        "text": "THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nPHOENIX — When the three-pointers start falling for Phoenix, it’s bad news for the opposition.\n\nLeandro Barbosa scored 30 points and Raja Bell added 24, including a season-high seven three-pointers, to help the Phoenix Suns stay unbeaten against Charlotte with a 118-104 victory over the Bobcats.\n\nBarbosa hit five three-pointers as the Suns improved to 8-0 against Charlotte since the Bobcats’ franchise was established in 2004. Amare Stoudemire added 24 points and Shawn Marion 14.\n\nOverall, Phoenix made 16-of-36 three-pointers.\n\n\"Those guys can shoot, man,\" said Charlotte’s Raymond Felton. \"Barbosa and Raja, those guys were putting that thing up in the air.\"\n\nJason Richardson scored 25 for the Bobcats, who lost the last four on a five-game road trip. Felton scored 19 and Emeka Okafor had 18 points and 13 rebounds for Charlotte. The Bobcats were without leading scorer Gerald Wallace for the second game in a row because of a right foot sprain.\n\nThe Suns led 54-51 at the half thanks to Marion’s 30-foot bank shot at the buzzer, then never trailed again. Bell sparked a 33-point third quarter, hitting four three-pointers.\n\n\"We weren’t real sharp,\" said Suns guard Steve Nash, a Victoria native. \"We missed a bunch of shots and never had that killer instinct to take them out of their zone. Eventually we did, but it took us longer than we would have liked.\"\n\nPhoenix made 22-of-35 shots (63 per cent) in a 64-point second half.\n\nCharlotte coach Sam Vincent said the zone defence worked for a half.\n\n\"But Phoenix is a good team. They figure out how to win games,\" he said. \"They figured our zone out and they started making shots.\"\n\nBell’s seven threes — in 12 attempts overall — were one shy of his career best. He was 7-for-9 from behind the arc after missing his first attempts.\n\n\"I felt good, it just wouldn’t go in,\" Bell said, \"but it was pretty obvious that they were going to be in their zone and I was going to get the opportunity to shoot a lot more. You just shoot. Sometimes they do and sometimes they don’t but you try to stay confident and keep shooting the ball.\"\n\nThe Suns, winners of eight of their last 10 but coming off an 84-81 home loss to San Antonio last Thursday, struggled through the first half.\n\n\"We were sleeping out there a little bit,\" Phoenix coach Mike D’Antoni said. \"It was not bad. It was just one of those games. We got it over with, and we have a great game coming up Wednesday.\"\n\nPhoenix, 2-1 halfway through a season-long six-game home stand, play New Orleans on Wednesday. The Hornets are 2-0 against the Suns this season.\n\nCharlotte was up 46-41 after Raymond Felton’s two free throws 3:54 before the break, but a 10-2 run gave Phoenix a 51-48 lead. Bell sank threes two during the spurt.\n\nNazr Mohammed’s three-point play on a rebound basket tied it at 51 with 32.1 seconds left in the half.\n\nThe Suns made 6-of-11 threes to take control in the third quarter.\n\nBell was fouled by Jared Dudley on a three-point attempt and made the free throws to give Phoenix a 63-54 lead with 9:26 to go in the third.\n\nThe lead reached 87-72 on Bell’s three-pointer with 23.2 seconds left in the third.\n\nBarbosa led the Suns with 19 first-half points in 11 minutes on 7-for-10 shooting. But overall Phoenix shot just 44 percent in the half compared with 53 percent for the Bobcats."
