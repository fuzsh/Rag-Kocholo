        "text": "The 36-year-old Marion informed the Cavs this weekend that he will take a minimum deal and play for them next season, said the person who spoke condition of anonymity because the contract has not been finalized.\n\nThe Cavs can only offer Marion a deal worth $1.4 million because they’re out of room under the salary cap.\n\nA four-time All-Star, Marion gives Cleveland another veteran with postseason experience to compliment James, who is returning to the Cavs intent on winning the city’s first pro championship since 1964. The team has previously signed shooters Mike Miller and James Jones, who won two NBA titles with (LeBron) James in Miami."
