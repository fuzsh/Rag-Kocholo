        "text": "AP\n\nDwyane Wade scored 41 points, 10 in the final eight-and-a-half minutes, to help the Miami Heat rally in the fourth quarter and beat the Charlotte Bobcats 100-96 on Monday.\n\nMario Chalmers scored 15 and Shawn Marion added 13 points for the Heat, who extended their winning streak to four — their longest in nearly two years.\n\nJason Richardson scored 24 for Charlotte, but missed two free throws that would have tied the game with 32.3 seconds remaining.\n\nEmeka Okafor added 19 points and 12 rebounds for the Bobcats, who lost to Miami for only the second time in the teams’ last eight meetings.\n\nThe Bobcats were without starting forward Gerald Wallace, who missed the game because he was in Alabama to mourn the death of his grandmother. Without Wallace, the Charlotte bench did its part to pick up the slack.\n\nD.J. Augustin scored 14 points and Adam Morrison added 13, including a long 3-pointer from the left wing with 6.7 seconds left that drew the Bobcats to 98-96.\n\nWARRIORS 112, THUNDER 102\n\nAt Oklahoma City, Andris Biedrins had 17 points and 21 rebounds as Golden State ended its nine-game losing skid by holding off a late surge led by Kevin Durant and Oklahoma City.\n\nTwo of the Warriors’ top scorers, Stephen Jackson (20.1 points per game) and Corey Maggette (19.1), sat out with injuries but it didn’t slow their offense. Jamal Crawford scored 19 points, and Brandan Wright and Anthony Morrow each had 15 as Golden State (6-15) shot 50.6 percent from the field in leading from the opening tip.\n\nDurant scored a season-high 41 and helped Oklahoma rally from 21 down in the fourth quarter, making consecutive 3-pointers to pull The Thunder (2-20) to 105-102 with about 33 seconds left before dropping their fourth straight.\n\nGRIZZLIES 109, ROCKETS 97\n\nAt Memphis, Tennessee, Rudy Gay scored 20 points, while Hakim Warrick and O.J. Mayo added 18 points apiece as Memphis downed Houston for its second straight win at home.\n\nMemphis made its first six 3-pointers to build an early lead and shot 51 percent overall. Gay, who did not start after arriving late for the shootaround, made eight of 14 shots.\n\nKyle Lowry had 11 points and five assists, while Mike Conley and Marc Gasol each had 10 points. Gasol and Warrick had eight rebounds apiece for Memphis.\n\nLuis Scola had 16 points and 15 rebounds, and Rafer Alston had 16 points and eight assists for the injury depleted Rockets.\n\nMAGIC 95, CLIPPERS 88\n\nAt Los Angeles, Dwight Howard had 23 points and 22 rebounds to lead Orlando past the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nHoward hit 20-20 for the second game in a row and it was his 17th double-double of the season. He also had six blocks and four assists.\n\nHoward had 21 points and 23 boards in a 98-89 over Oklahoma City his last game.\n\nRashard Lewis added 18 points for Orlando and Jameer Nelson had 15.\n\nZach Randolph had 21 points and 12 rebounds for Los Angeles, and Marcus Camby had 17 rebounds in the loss."
