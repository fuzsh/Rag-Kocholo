Abstract

Golden Gate University School of Law is proud to announce that The Morrison & Foerster Foundation has selected Golden Gate Law as its Bay Area partner in awarding its annual Stephen S. Dunham Scholarship. The scholarship—named for Steve Dunham, a former firm-wide chair of Morrison & Foerster and now Vice President and General Counsel of The Johns Hopkins University—is intended for an incoming law student from a group historically underrepresented in the legal profession.
