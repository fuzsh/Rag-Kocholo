This design breakthrough, with its accompanying cyclone chaff collection system, produces clean tasting coffee, without the harsh edge present in most coffees (a result of tar, which often occurs in drum-type roasters, coating the beans).\n\nCafe del Sol roasted in the basement at home for the first few years, and is now located on the south end of Iowa City, in our third commercial location.\n\nKeep checking back as more of our story is told, and thanks!\n\nPractices"
