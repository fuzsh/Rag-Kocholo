He is an awesome, knowledgeable and helpful handyman. He is a trained carpenter and worked for a construction company for years. He has a solid reputation throughout the east bay and I know that his business has taken off lately. He's been doing his own thing ever since his daughter was born a few years ago. He's a skilled craftsman who is also very nice. He works through out the East Bay and I've seen his name pop up on BPN a number of times through various people. He has worked on a number of projects for me and my family, including: deck work, patch work, roofing, building custom shelving, putting together annoying Ikea furniture, fixes bathroom appliances and fixtures, etc. He also can do landscaping and small electrical. He really can do everything. He also offers cost effective solutions and alternatives. Lastly, he's one of the nicest people I've ever had working on my home before.

I think the roof seal needs attention, and we may need some new wallboard in the light well. (Skylight is approx. 24' x 48' with relatively easy access; I can do the interior repainting.) I also need someone to clean the gutters. The hitch is that I need to hire someone with their own license and insurance - and who does great work! We live near the Dimond District/Oakland. Thanks\n\nI have used Thomas Banks on several occasions. Recently he replaced nearly all the fluorescent lights in my store. He repaired an exterior wood structure and he has performed minor repairs. He has a contractors license; ask him about insurance. Here is his info Thomas Banks BanksTown Builders 510 978 5679 stu\n\nI needed to respond to the person who recommended Thomas Banks. DO NOT let him do more than change your lightbulbs. I can not even express the mess he made of our deck, and it's our fault--we read a nice review on BPN, he was cheap and available. I doubt he's licensed. He demolished our deck and then didn't come back for weeks. Then he did come back, but it was clearly after his day job (I'm sure my neighbors loved him working from 4-8pm). He ran out of money (spent it on other jobs, so couldn't buy materials for our job) and then instead of buying the correct lumber, he bought cheap stuff and tried to cover it by PAINTING. We should've sued him, but honestly, we just wanted him out of our lives.

He has done all of the above for me, as well as replaced water heater, hung shelves, regrouted shower, and is dependable and very reasonable. Anon\n\nMargarito has worked on our house since 2007. We first met him when he was with our contractor's crew, to re-do one of our rooms, roof to floor. Since then, we have hired him for simpler jobs such as painting (outdoors and indoors), caulking, bamboo floor installation, etc. He will tell you how long a job might last and charges a very reasonable hourly rate. If it's a bigger job, he will have his partner work with him, so double the rate but still VERY reasonable with two. Margarito, 510-334- 7502.

I would like a referral to someone reliable, efficient, honest.\n\nbest handyman in the bay area! Builds customized play structures too! (he can help out from San Jose California all the way to Berkley California or SAn Francisco. Also around PA, MP, RWC, SC, MV, Atherton, ETC.) Hello folks, this year I set out to completely remodel my torn down home in Palo Alto. The home looks almost brand new and with the help of George Jimenez looks more beautiful than I ever imagined my home to look like. I have been so happy with George's work that I have recommended him to many of my friend's as well. He is also great with customized children's play houses and customized furniture, beds, and counters, etc. George Jimenez first came to my family by rec from a coworker of my husband's, he first came, assessed the work, ripped out the rotting boards, bought the new lumber, replaced the rotted boards, reinforced the supporting beams and then applied a mildew killer to the finished and repaired deck. He also moved the plants on my deck carefully and replaced them too. I liked the carpenter/handyman very much. He was professional, punctual, honest and a careful and hard worker. Please consider hiring this amazing does-it-all handyman! You can call him at his cell phone 650-646-1776\n\nWe have had a handyman for 7 years now - his name is Andy Mirske. Andy managed apartments for years professionally, including helping with major renovations. He is humble and clearly capable. He has helped us with everything from installing a window screen on a bathroom door to a complete renovation with an IKEA kitchen. He recently found the source of a leak in our house, and repaired it, including repainting the ceiling. Also, he is simply a good guy, willing to work hard and at a fair price. His phone number is (925)577-4990 and his email is czornyj [at] gmail.com. Good luck! Elizabeth\n\nI would HIGHLY recommend Larry Gray as an all around superb handyman.

He is very knowledgeable, and just has a 'good eye' for coming up with solutions for difficult problems. He is dependable and honest, and really just a nice guy. He can be reached at lrgray629 [at] gmail.com and 510-524-1510. -Scott\n\nI already posted this recommendation under Handymen. I am also recommending him for fence building because in addition to doing plumbing and handyman work for me he also built a fence for me on a very challenging lot. The fence was built on an extremely steep, rocky area with trees and bushes in the way. Al Hugon is such a treasure of a handyman that I almost want to keep him a secret (he is already busy and might get too busy). He is competent (and will tell you if he does not feel qualified for certain projects), super nice, extremely reliable, dependable, respectful and very honest. Plus his rates are not just reasonable but low for the quality of his work. He will come up with creative solutions for problems, suggest ways to save money and and he cleans up the work area at the end of the day. The attribute that sets him apart from most is how caring and thoughtful he is. I highly recommend Al as an excellent handyman, plumber and fence builder and exceptional human being. The only thing is, he has no crew so not sure if he does big jobs. Contact him at 510-917-6415. Nancy\n\nI would like to recommend a great handyman I used for the past year: Octavio Moreno, who lives in Concord, but worked for me 6 days/week in Oakland, Berkeley and Emeryville doing all rental property maintenance work for past year: leaky faucets; electrical work; installing toilets; repairing running toilets; restoring dry rotted window sashes; painting (he has his own paint machine); building fences; installing locks; getting rid of raccoons in attics; getting locks re-keyed; installing sliding closet doors; installing cultured marble surrounds in bathtub enclosures; installing new faucet sets; replacing rotted subfloors; installing vinyl flooring; installing mini blinds; plus has own jet sprayer for removal of vegetation from sidewalk cracks/ paint removal; also fabricated and installed window screens; these are just to name a few things.

Maksuda\n\nLooking for Handy Man/Carpenter to fix Cabinets\n\nApril 2012\n\nWe have very cheap plywood kitchen cabinets that may be original to our 1946 home. They are falling apart (doors won't stay shut, hinges falling out due to deteriorating wood, etc). We do not have the cash for a kitchen remodel, and want to find out whether there is any way to repair the existing cabinets as a 'good enough for now' option. We are looking for a handy man/carpenter who can take a look and recommend a inexpensive way to make our cabinetry functional again. This may involve replacing some wood, replacing hardware, repairing problem areas, and probably new paint. Or maybe it means finding salvage cabinetry and replacing whole sections. We do not want anyone who will suggest a wholesale kitchen remodel or brand new cabinetry. Any recommendations BPN? Lia\n\nI have been using a handyman for the last 2 years and this is exactly the kind of work he does. He has helped to remove cabinets, fixed my front steps, reset my garden path and lots of other things. Ken is a very nice person to work with and he is always trying to save me money. His rate is very reasonable, he's very organized and works efficiently. Ken Norris 925-682-5805 geapman [at] gmail.com Joyce\n\nMy husband and I have an old North Oakland Craftsman and needed a handyman for repairing our window frames and trim. A neighbor recommended Brendan Montgomerie. He had just finished plenty of work over there that we were able to view and discuss with that homeowner. Brendan did a good job on our place (stripped off the old paint and refilled the wood with penetrating epoxy to stop and solidify dry-rot, and then filled with epoxy filler, sanded and primed it so that it's ready for painting).\n\nBrendan lives in Richmond, but commutes via bike and carries his tools with a bike-trailer (or leaves them at a job site until that job is done). He is affordable and conscientious. He is a bit laid back though, not always punctual, partially because he may have other jobs going at the same time. He's generous when it comes to accounting for his hours (for example, he would usually not charge for trips to the hardware store to get supplies). He has worked for us on and off over the last 4 months, and we have been very satisfied with the results. Brendan can be reached at 510-235-4673 Kathleen\n\nAlbert Cano, my neighbor, is a very versatile handyman. He's very experienced with electrical and plumbing problems, has done just about everything - roofing, painting, gardening, tile, concrete, and remodeling like your cabinets. He does the little stuff with a fine hand. He recently fixed a very fussy antique lock for me, and rebuilt a window that I wanted to save. His wife Lola does his scheduling and she is a very sweet lady. Albert is at 510-593-3334. linda\n\nI highly recommend Mark Feinberg. I have used him for a number of projects. He is a fine finish carpenter who also does handyman work. He is creative in non-expensive workarounds, meticulous and extemely reasonable and honest. Mark Feinberg Mobile: 510-282-7472 mark [at] there.net cjs\n\nOver the years, I've hired various handymen to help me with my North Berkeley house. I've found such a treasure now that I wanted to share with BPN members. Mike Zinser is fabulous: friendly, fast, skilled, and very reasonably priced. He charges $25 - $50 an hour for him and/or members of his small crew. They can do a range of handymen jobs: Excellent painting, decks, fences, dryrot repair, doors, windows and siding, remodeling of kitchen and baths. They do not do addition, foundation or roofs. His team has painted the interior and exterior of my house - no drips, they cleaned up all the debris and are super fast. They have also built my backyard fence, installed new windows, rebuilt rotten window sashes, and showed up once in 15 minutes when I had a flooding emergency. He is great at thinking through options and providing detailed estimates. I actually feel like he is a partner in keeping my house in good condition. I can't recommend him enough: Mike Zinser, phone: (510) 684-0053 and 548-7497, Mike's Remodeling and Home Repair, CA License # B 842502 Annie\n\nI want to highly recommend Julio Juarez of JJ's Handyman. Julio has done several jobs (electric, cement, carpentry) for us at our North Berkeley home.

Julio is highly skilled, highly professional and always delivers excellent work per the agreed time and money arrangements. His prices are very fair and he's a pleasure to deal with. He can be reached at 510-851-0071. His English is excellent. Far and away the best experience our family has had with renovations and repairs ever! Jenny\n\nLooking for a great reliable handyman\n\nJan 2012\n\nHello, I'm looking for recomendations for a handyman for siding repair, we also need someone for a few other odd jobs like installing a new front door, please let me know if you can recommend anyone. Thanks! mom of two\n\nI recommend HIGHLY that you use a licensed contractor. Berkley requires a permit for siding repair -- CAN YOU BELIEVE IT!! I use Greg Watson. He's been in the business for years, and has license and insurance. I've used a lot of workers in the past, and every time I used an unlicensed person I've been disappointed. I guess if you know how things should be done correctly, and can oversee what the guy is doing it would be OK, but - heck - I don't know whether it's being done correctly or not until there's a problem. Well, anyway Greg's number is 510-223-1541 (office) and 510-374- 8070 (cell). I have recommended him to lots of people on the BPN, and now they all brag about him. Good luck! Marilyn\n\nWe can highly recommend Ignacio Arechiga for any household project- He and his team are trustworthy, and have done many projects for us and our neighbors. His specialities include concrete, decks, electrical, floors, plumbing, stucco and outdoor hardscape project. You can reach him at 510-827-7518. He speaks excellent English and employs only family or close friends. Nancy\n\nI have used a wonderful handyman. He can do mostly everything and is very creative with solutions. His name is Ken Norris , geapman [at] gmail.com and 925-787-2800 Ken is reasonably priced, very easy to work with and a great guy. Joyce\n\nI can highly recommend Jaime Fletcher for all household repair and handyman services. He is a father of two in Oakland and is about as honest as they come. He was a carpenter for years and switched to doing small jobs and handyman work in 2011. He is incredibly thorough, kind, detail oriented and really knows his stuff. He will explain all of his work to you as well. For me he has worked on a range of jobs from putting up pictures to building a security fence. He can be reached at fletcher.jaime [at] gmail.com or 510-418-3128. anita\n\nOver the last several years we have really come to rely on Tom Boynton, a very capable and careful handyman. I don't know the full range of his skills, but he seems to be able to do everything we have needed him to do, including painting, minor finish carpentry, drywall repair, door installation, minor electrical, etc.\n\nOnce, in the midst of a winter storm when our sump pump gave out and our basement suddenly flooded, Tom dropped what he was doing and rushed out to an equipment rental place in Oakland and within an hour he was at our place with industrial fans and space heaters to help dry the basement and limit the water damage. He was a real lifesaver.\n\nMost recently we asked him to replace our front door, which had started to bow. He spent a lot of time on the phone with people at Home Depot, Ashby Lumber, etc getting prices and sizes. And he even made a trip to Home Depot to check the quality of the fiberglass doors before making a recommendation to us. He provided us first with a detailed explanation of material and labor costs so we could choose the best option. He really goes above and beyond. Highly recommended.\n\nHis contacts: Thomas Boynton tomcboynton [at] yahoo.com (510)390 6455 jason\n\nJust had a great experience with Jaime Fletcher, a father of two who works as a handyman 3 days a week and on week-ends. He's overqualified for the job. He's also a finish carpenter and can do minor plumbing and electrical work, and works with an electrician and plumber, if you wish. He helped us find the source of a leak, which was amazing. He also helped us, for a fee, check out someone who could do a bigger project than he had time for. His recommendation was terrific, too. We recommend him wholeheartedly. 510-418-3128 fletcher.jaime [at] gmail.com Judith B\n\nMarco Florian, is a great handyman. He has done numerous jobs in our home and properties as well. He has done plumbing,tiling,carpentry, etc. He has also experience remodeling bathrooms and kitchens. He can work on weekends or evenings if needed; Marco always goes the extra mile and his rates are very reasonable. He is reliable, polite, creative, good nature man. You can reach Marco directly at 510-301-5629 or marco.a.florian [at] gmail.com Ana\n\nDanny Beltram (Diamond Handyman) does great work, and is very reliable! 510-414-1032. laura\n\nI highly recommend Mark Feinberg. Mark has done a large number of jobs for me including building a new floor under the sink, helping remove old flooring, installing lights and curtain rods, patching holes in a ceiling and other jobs. Mark is a finish carpenter so he is highly skilled at carpentry but can do a lot more than that. He is meticulous, honest to a fault and (this is important given past experience with handymen) will tell you if he is not the best person for a job. Mark Feinberg Mobile: 510-282-7472 mark [at] there.net carol\n\nVery prompt, conscientious and self reliant, Darryl Pulley is a handyman who listens to your need(s), proposes options that address them and gets the job done without disrupting your schedule. He can be reached by calling (510) 379-0152 tomye\n\nHandy man/woman for earthquake proofing + odd jobs\n\nJan 2012\n\nLooking for someone who can install straps on our tall furniture (bookshelves, bunk, etc.) as well as finish/do various other odd jobs such as install curtain railing and wall hooks and paint a small amount of trim that is peeling. Need someone who knows what to do as far as the earthquake proofing is concerned (secure to studs, etc.) and who is precise enough that curtains and hooks etc. will be straight on the wall! Anon\n\nThe Handychick is the best for these types of jobs. I've used her services to build a storage unit as well as for small electrical jobs, painting, and the like. She is courteous, on-time, and reasonable. Contact her at 415-713-6974. Monique\n\nNeed skilled handyman\n\nOct 2011\n\nWe need the contact information of someone we can call to replace a broken window, fix a light fixture, do various handyman tasks that come up, on an as- needed basis. Someone multi-skilled and calm. We're in North Berkeley near Arlington Circle.\n\nI have to recommend Peter Gill (510-387-0103), whom I found on BPN several years ago. His carpentry skills are amazing! He is very conscientious, ensuring that each job, no matter how small, is done correctly and to my satisfaction. I am very pleased to have found such a talented handyman. And... his prices are very reasonable! Happy Homeowner\n\nI would try Amir of Integral Home Improvements at (510) 904-2786. He is wonderfully skilled, trustworthy, sensible and reasonably priced. We have used him over the years on smaller projects of window replacement and repair, as well as larger projects including a complete master bedroom and bath remodel. Christine\n\nHandy Person for Small Jobs\n\nSept 2011\n\nHi. I'm moving and need someone to help with small things around the house, like fixing picture hook marks on the wall, touch up painting and small jobs like that. Thanks\n\nI recommend Diane Dring at diane2543 [at] comcast.net or 510- 915-4039. She is cheerful, reliable and can do all sorts of carpentry, painting, and fix-its. Isadora\n\nHandyman/Carpenter\n\nAugust 2011\n\nWe are looking for recommendations of a handyman/carpenter to do various medium-sized projects, like enlarging and improving a small attic space, creating a door into a closet, etc. Thank you for your referrals.\n\nI highly recommend Marco Florian, he is a great handyman, carpenter, painter, plumber, tiler etc. He has done numerous jobs in our home. He can work on weekends or evenings if needed; Marco always goes the extra mile and his rates are very reasonable. He is reliable, polite, creative, good nature man. YOu can reach Marco at 510-301- 5629 or marco.a.florian [at] gmail.com adf\n\nI can highly recommend Mark Feinberg (Mobile: 510-282-7472 mark [at] there.net) as a handyman/carpenter. He recently rebuilt a cupboard for us in our garage. It was a miserable job. He had to work in a very tight space that required much measuring and realigning. Mark diligently tackled the project, giving us a space that we now are very happy with at a reasonable rate.\n\nHis skills include general interior repair (plaster, drywall, painting and all related carpentry); trim carpentry (installing decorative moldings, hanging/correcting/trimming doors and windows, installing baseboards); installing cabinetry in kitchens and baths (general ''remodeling'' so long as the projects are not too large for him to do alone); building and repairing stairs and decks; hanging mirrors and paintings; working with plumbing and electrical fixtures but those that are ''in the room'' as opposed to installing new plumbing systems or rewiring inside the walls (both of which should be done according to code by licensed/insured contractors). Feel free to contact me if you have questions about Mark and his work. lmac\n\nReliable handyman needed\n\nJune 2011\n\nI have tried to get a reliable handyman to do some work at our Berkeley house, and have not had any luck. We are getting frustrated as a few 'highly recommended' folks have either not called us back, have come over and then said they were to busy or come over done work and then disappeared. Can someone recommend a handyman that would be reliable. We have an old craftsman with potentially a lot to do, and definitely a few bigger projects to start. They will have to be somewhat skilled. Anon\n\nI don't know if my recommendation was posted about Arturo Arreola. Anyway, is is amazing. He is a train in tiling, has completed all sorts of work including complete kitchens, baths, fences, roofs, etc. Call him, great price, honest: 510-725-5920. Steve\n\nOur friend and contractor Nick Ridge of NM Ridge Construction (nmridgeframing.com -510-860-0391) is a highly talented contractor, now starting to get his name known as a 'handyman extraordinaire,' due to a decrease in large jobs during the economic downturn. He can design (Nic used to be a drafter for the city of Berkeley) do small projects, decks, arbors, outbuildings, do window installs or repairs, leak investigation and repair, garage doors replacement or customization, tile, plumbing, cabinet installs, etc. He is unbelievably hard working and honest and has a great 'bedside manner,' always willing to problem solve and discuss options, never treating people like they don't know the industry and don't deserve to know all their options. He is smart, creative and fair. He is the best! Feel free to email me for more info. Louisa\n\nI highly recommend Danny Beltram of Diamond Handyman Service. He does great work and is very reliable! 510-414-1032\n\nMarc Lencl recently did some fine handiwork at my home. He replaced and repaired French doors and threshold, painted, replaced doorlocks, and changed a lighting fixture. He is prompt, reliable, fair, and can do almost anything. Find him at 510763-7438 and tell him Bonnie sent you! bonnie\n\nI highly recommend George Takash. He is experienced,he has been working in the El Cerrito-Berkley area for over 35 years, and has good references.He is a talented ,honest reliable, responsible person.George has wonderful work ethics. He has not worked for me because I rent but he has worked for 3 of my landlords and many people I know or have worked for(babysitting, house sitting).I've only heard rave reviews. He keeps a really clean work site.He does almost all handyman work. He also is a professorial carpenter,he does fences, decks etc,excellent painter, he also does tile work, bathroom and other remodeling, doors and windows. He does it all extremely well and creatively. As you are looking for someone good and reliable, he is also looking for good clients who treat him honestly and fair also. Please don't call him if you are looking for the cheapest work and just want as many bids from a bunch of different workers,or just want to take and use his ideas, and shine him on. He works so hard when he does bids and runs around checking on prices. It really goes both ways. If you are interested in his contact information please email me Thank You. Wendy\n\nAbraham Lubaton is a licensed contractor who is great at handyman type work. No job is too small.

He is also available for larger remodeling and building projects. Give him a call. He is responsive, reliable and reasonably priced. You can reach him at 510.715.0448. AC\n\nBen Conrad is an excellent and reliable handyman. He has rebuilt a number of things in my home, including a craftsman porch pillar that had completely rotted. He has experience with all aspects of home building and repair. He even built an entire cottage for my neighbor, plumbing and foundation included. In addition, he has advised me on home repairs that I ended up being able to do myself. I know a lot of people who have hired Ben and they've all been really satisfied. 510-517-9488 conradben [at] hotmail.com happy customer\n\nVery reliable, prompt, hard working, fair priced, skilled and creative . . . highest recommendation for Ben Conrad 510-517-9488. Mike B.\n\nWe've had a great experience with handyman and contractor Juan Vazquez. While we're homeowners, we're definitely not do-it-yourself people, or even very handy. Luckily, we found Juan and he's done a number of different sized projects for us: from carpentry to pluming to electric work. The work has been great, he talks through the project with us so we understand our choices before he starts, and he and his crew are great to have around the house, mellow and courteous. Now we're happy to know we have someone we can call for that long list of house projects! Call Juan at 510-472-9334, or his business partner Glen Larsen at 510-232-9122. Christa D.\n\nI would recommend Bebe Construction, (510) 566-6685. Bebe has done several jobs for us in and around our old house, including emergency plumbing work, non-emergency plumbing work, building a new fence, and he's about to help us install a new floor. On every job, he has been reliable and professional. His work has been excellent, and he has stuck by his quoted price for the work despite running into numerous problems along the way on several jobs (it's an old house!) that created a lot more work than anticipated. He has also been incredibly generous - while building our new fence, he found himself with some spare time while his helper cleaned up, so he took the opportunity to re-level the patio doors that had been sticking! He's been a true find, and I will be relying on him for all our general contractor/handyman jobs in the future. Bebe construction - (510) 566-6685. Eben\n\nNazario Medina (510) 712-3506, is far more than handyman. He is a very honest worker who could probably build you house. He'll work on small jobs or large, inside and outside the home. Nazario is great at repairing and reusing, and treats your house with respect. He's done sturdy decking and patio work for me, and I've seen really nice wallboard and perfect wall and trim painting he's done for others. I believe he can also tile and build you a bathroom! He was available for work when I asked him recently, so give him call! InAlbany\n\nI highly recommend Tomas Guindon, for all types of home maintenance, as well as landscaping design, installation (including carpentry) and repairs. Tomas has worked multiple times for us on our current, and former home, in Piedmont/Oakland. Tomas Guindon recently designed and built a beautifully constructed fence for us, and the three neighbors who border our property. Working with so many parties, as well as managing the permitting with the local planning commission, would normally be tricky. Tomas not only satisfied our needs, but was highly praised by our neighbors as well.\n\nTomas has done the following work for us at two locations: fence design, permitting and construction, poured concrete pads and built concrete retaining walls, built rock pathways, installed outdoor lighting and electrical boxes, moved and improved the sprinkling system, rebuilt wood decks, and designed and built planter boxes. Tomas is particularly good at listening to, and understanding the goals of his clients, and problem solving when new things come up during a project.\n\nTomas is knowledgeable and conscientious about sustainable building techniques. He is careful to maximize the longevity of the project by safeguarding that the correct materials are used. I have found that Tomas, and his crew (all very skilled) can always be reached if there is a question, never cut corners on our projects and take pride in their work. I encourage you to contact Tomas Guindon: (510 520-0204, tomasguindon [at] hotmail.com - Jean\n\nWe would recommend Ben Conrad (510-517-9488). He's helped us fixed several things around the house: replacing window panes, extending roof drains, and stripping/painting window sills. Each task was done neatly and with attention to detail. He's organized and easy to work with, gives us a rough estimate and timeline at the beginning, and follows through to the end of the project. We would definitely work with Ben again. Carrie\n\nHandy Man posting. Although Travis is a licensed general contractor and quite skilled at bigger jobs, I've also used him for some smaller projects around the house. Travis was even thoughtful enough to lower his rates to reflect the fact that the work didn't really require a licensed contractor so I ended up getting the skill and craftmanship of an experienced contractor for the price of a handyman. Travis fixed some areas on my porch as well as sanded and beautifully restored my large mahogany front door. I know that he is interested in taking on smaller projects these days due to the fall in the economy and the simple reality that the big contractor jobs simply aren't as plentiful and receive multiple bids. Sometimes Travis will even bring extra lunch to share with you! You can contact Travis at 925-899-7438 or by email at traviseaton76 [at] gmail.com.

Chris\n\nWhy look for a handyman-I know a great handywoman! Shazam has maintained my home for over twenty years with ingenuity and good humor. An outstanding problem solver. Everywhere I look in my house I can see her improvements, repairs, and upgrades. Everything from gate design and installation, a new front door, a bathroom fan/heater ceiling fixture, major fence and deck repairs, to building closet shelves, painting and dry wall repair. She is also an experienced landscaper and installed an excellent drip system for my garden. She has given me lots of simple plumbing and curtain hardware assistance and she replaced a major part on my washer very efficiently. She even designed and built my tap dance floor!

She really can do anything and save you money on the way with her ecological approach of preserving the functional and replacing only what is necessary. Highly recommended!

I don't remember the exact rate he charged, but it was the lowest I had found. He has been reviewed on Yelp, and last time I checked the reviews were good. My only complaint is that he was significantly late on one occasion. His number is 510-517-1561.

Brian is very reliable, very thorough, and even creative to help figure out unexpected challenges or unique solutions.

He's grouted, put up pictures, secured a tall pantry cabinet to the wall for earthquake safety. He's even willing to assemble IKEA furniture so it's done right. He's also very upfront about what he won't do. He said he would not install the dishwasher, for example. Please call him! Three of my neighbors use him and love him, too.

Any ideas? Thanks Lee\n\nHello Lee, I highly recommend Ben Conrad 510-517-9488. He recently turned my falling down carport into a beautiful little cedar shingle cottage complete with tiled bathroom, kitchen, and laundry room. At my request, he used recycled windows, doors, and sinks, and found a beautiful recycled old redwood beam for the living room area. He did basically everything with the exception of some of the electrical himself. His work was immaculate. He was thorough, personable, and full of ideas on how to get creative in order to save money and space. Hope this helps! Marie\n\nAntonio Toro, more than just a handyman. A Handyman, Interior Designer, Organizer, and Helper par excellence, all in one. I have worked with many other organizers, repair people, carpenters and what-not.

He is trustworthy, reliable, creative and afordable.Very easy to work with. You can contact him directly @ 510-301-5629 Ana\n\nI am writing to recommend Mark Feinberg( 510-282-7472) as handyman, with a specialty in carpentry (he tells me that he doesn?t know plumbing or electricity well enough to specialize in them). Off and on I have used recommendations from the BPN, always with good success till the last time. Given my experience I looked for recommendations through friends. Mark worked for many years as a finish carpenter for a firm that restored Victorians. He transitioned to sales of building materials but was recently laid off. He decided to return to his original specialty of home repair. I did not use him for fine carpentry, so cannot speak to that.\n\nHe helped me paint a kitchen plus assorted other home repairs. I have nothing but good things to say. He arrived on time, initially established work spaces that would not interfere with my use of the home, and cleaned up after our work each day. He did not mind my helping him to save money (I did the easy stuff) and instructed me as we worked.\n\nBecause of his long history in home renovation, he made multiple suggestions about things I could do at various levels of cost. More importantly, he because he was a part of a renovation company, he understands how a house works, so is able to ?see? things I would not think of. He was meticulous in his work, and his rates were appreciably below other estimates that I got.\n\nAnd finally, since he was an undergraduate English major, he recommended a couple of authors that I haven?t read. carol\n\nApril 2009\n\nVarious things in my condo home are now in need or repair or replacement - triple electric switch in bathroom, interior door lock/handles, recaulking the bathtub, towel rack loose, painting trim on frame etc... it seems to be IMPOSSIBLE to get a handyman with so few jobs!! I have tried rounding up some more but really that is all there is - except for future patio tiling etc when I have more $$! I have called various handyman from UC parents network also yelp and google generally but either they don't call back when I say what the jobs are or want to charge $100's or are min 4 hours! It's at least 2+ hours of work. Can anyone please help me with the name and contact information for a handyman willing to come to Alameda and do some small jobs in my home? I will contact them as soon as this appears in my email. Thank you so much!! Mary\n\nI highly recommend Diamond Handyman, (Danny Beltram) 510-633-1488. He has done outstanding carpentry, painting, and repairs in my home, and he is extremely reliable and personable. lauraanne\n\nMary, you need small fixit jobs on a bathroom electric switch, a door handle, bathtub recaulking, painting trim, screwing down a towel rack...\n\nAny one of these could be a 5 minute job or a 2 day job ... it depends on what's wrong and how well you'd like the repair done.\n\nExample: Bathtub recaulking. Maybe you just need some caulk on top of the old stuff? Or do you want the old caulk removed first? Or do you just need cleaning of some black mold growing on the existing caulk. Is the tub separating from the wall, such that it needs tile repairs as well? Might there be a caulking opening around the faucets which, in turn, has allowed water to leak into the framing of the wall behind the tile ... this means a great deal of work if the framing is gotten rotten.\n\nSeldom can a good worker give a reasonable estimate until they've spent at least a few minutes (and often longer!) thinking through what needs to be done and discussing it with you. Now, think about how long it takes to drive from my place in Berkeley to your house in Alameda. (I guess it's half an hour each way ... so just to visit you will cost an hour of my day)\n\nNaturally, you want to spend as little as possible - especially since these jobs address annoyances, not severe problems. Realize that while one person may want the absolute minimum cost on a job; another may want to spend more so as to minimize dust from lead paint or to have the smoothest caulking job or the most assurance that nothing else is wrong.\n\nSuggestion: Learn how to do minor jobs around the house. Tell schools that we need to teach basic handiwork skills (like how to use a screwdriver, how to measure voltage, how to organize a kitchen, and how to cook a meal) Respect those who have spent time honing these skills. A guy that fixes things\n\n*For the three Handyman requests:* I recommended Glen Larsen in the last Home & Garden digest, when others wanted the same thing. It's still current in my mind because I just had him do many follow-up/remaining tasks:\n\nFor a Handyman, and all those repairs and projects that pile up, call Glen Larsen. He will make your home work well and save you money in the process.\n\nHere's my very recent experience: I just prepared my house to rent out. There were innumerable tasks ranging from small to large, e.g.: * replace the bathroom overhead fixture * touch-up all the chipped paint in the entire house (matching old paint colors) * build a wall in the garage for a storage space * clean/paint the kitchen (a big job!)\n\nGlen has a crew of wonderful guys whom I enjoyed having around (very pleasant and helpful). Clearing out and preparing my house to rent was stressful enough for me. If there had been problems with workers and the repairs, I would have been a basket case.\n\nWhat was very much appreciated by me were Glen's suggestions, e.g., I would say ''We need to paint this.'' and Glen said, ''No, we can clean this and touch up here.'' And Glen designed a much better way to configure the storage area than the one I presented, giving me much more space. Do I sound satisfied? What a relief!

Thank you Mouna\n\nFor all of these handyman postings, I cannot recommend Andres Jara enough. We found him on BPN so you can search previous postings of mine and others on here, but he is fabulous (and has a great personality). His work is flawless and prices reasonable. He is also quite versatile and can do many different types of things well (e.g. tile, decks, fences, painting, plumbing). My only hesitation in recommending him is that we may soon need him for some things and we are afraid he may get too busy! But don't let that deter you, seriously, Andres is a gem. His phone number is 510-693-0007. Good luck! Alison in El Cerrito\n\nI recommend Alberto Martinez (393-2541)for many small household repairs (patching, painting, tilework, outdoor maintenance) as well as larger jobs (retaining walls, bathroom remodel).

He's helped me with everything from toilet leaks, subpump failures, to even remodeling my backyard. He really is a Jack of all trades and easy to work with. Best of luck!
