Stephen Morse\n\nWebsite:\n\nResearch Page\n\nDudley Professor of Electrical & Computer Engineering\n\nRoom / Office: Dunham 508\n\nOffice Address:\n\nMailing Address:\n\nPhone: (203) 432-4295\n\nEmail: as.morse@yale.edu\n\nDegrees:\n\nPh.D., Purdue University\n\nInterests:\n\nProfessor Morse's research deals with problems involving the control of dynamical systems of all types. He is especially interested in control using logic-based switching, in hybrid systems, in vision-based control, and in the development of new algorithms for controlling very imprecisely modeled processes. Currently his research is focused on a variety of problems in the area of network science including sensor network localization, multi-agent consensus and rendezvous, and the distributed control of formations of mobile autonomous agents.\n\nSelected Awards & Honors:\n\nFellow of the International Federation of Automatic Control (2014)\n\nAmerican Automatic Control Council's Richard E.
