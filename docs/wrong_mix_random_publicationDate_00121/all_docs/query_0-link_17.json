        "text": "When they were 15 years old, Let the Right One In director John Tiffany and associate director/movement director Steven Hoggett met near Huddersfield, England and bonded over a love of watching horror films. This childhood bond grew into a robust artistic collaboration that has spanned decades and includes the hit shows Once, Black Watch, and Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.\n\nIn 2013 they began collaborating on an adaptation of the Swedish novel and film, Let the Right One In. The production, which premiered at the National Theatre of Scotland, went on to tour the world and is currently at Berkeley Rep featuring an American cast for the first time.\n\nBerkeley Rep’s associate artistic director, David Mendizábal, sat down with John and Steven in the rehearsal room to discuss their longtime collaboration, translating horror to the stage, and what it means to revisit this play today.\n\nDavid Mendizábal: Let the Right One In was originally a novel and a screenplay by John Ajvide Lindqvist, but whose idea was it initially to adapt it into a stage play, and how did this creative team come together?\n\nJohn Tiffany: I’d seen the film Let the Right One In back in 2009 when it came out and I loved it. I absolutely adored it. And there’s a producer who works in Britain, Marla Rubin, who I’d known for quite a while. Marla came to me a couple of years later and said that she’d acquired the rights for a stage version of it and I was like, “Oh my God, that’s the best idea in the world.” I was working at the National Theater of Scotland at the time as the associate director, and I thought it would work very well with a Scottish cast, even though it’s set in Sweden, since Scotland and Scandinavia used to be joined and they share a lot of geographical features. One of my first strong visual ideas was that it would be set in a forest of silver birch trees, which is the iconic image from the beginning of the film. In terms of how this team came together, Steven and I have known each other since we were 15, and one of the things we bonded over.... Well, first of all, we bonded over Kate Bush’s Hounds of Love album.\n\nSteven Hoggett: Correct.\n\nJT: But also, Stephen King’s novel It, which came out just as we met. That led us to a lifetime love of watching horror films together. So, I knew that Steven would love the challenge of putting a vampire on stage, and to create what the physicality of that was, the kill and the violence. Then there was the playwright Jack Thorne, who Steven and I had known for a while, though I hadn’t had the opportunity to work with him on a full production at that point. I knew Jack would really connect with the story of a bullied teenager who finds it difficult to connect with people around him. Next was scenic designer Christine Jones, who Steven worked with on American Idiot, which started life at Berkeley Rep. Then sound designer Gareth Fry. Sound design is incredibly important in this. Jeremy Chernick came on to do the special effects, all the blood, et cetera. And a lighting designer Chahine Yavroyan, who’s sadly no longer with us, but who I’d worked with for many years. And so that was the team, wasn’t it?\n\nSH: There was also an album Ólafur Arnalds had just released, For Now I Am Winter. It was one of those albums where I was thinking, “Every single track on this album is amazing.” So, we just approached Ólafur, and he was very much like “Yeah, I’m not sure what you’re doing but go ahead. It sounds lovely and weird.” So, we brought that music into this play. Practically the whole album is in the show. So yeah, that was a lovely little addition to the crew, just because his music is very much right at the heart of the show.\n\nDid you always know that movement was going to be such a central part of the storytelling?\n\nJT: It always is in the work that we do together.\n\nSH: Yeah, it falls into two categories. There’s movement direction, which is how do you get somebody to play 200-year-old vampire? And then there are the sequences. Those are closer to being archetypally choreography, and the show kind of flirts between those two. The film is incredible. In fact, even Let Me In, the American remake, is a rare event where the American remake is a really good film as well. There were some tonalities in the film that we really enjoyed, and while we couldn’t have exactly that, we wanted to incorporate some of it into our world. I remember you [John] talking about wanting to know how this town feels having somebody slaughtering their own. And if it’s happening in the forest, what do they feel like in the forest? So, in lots of ways that was an absolute starter for us. Instead of describing these feelings with words, we decided to show it with movement. There was a moment where Jack was writing a scene for Oskar and Eli, and he wanted us to know they were having a fun time together. He wrote something, and we then started playing with it physically. After seeing the movement, he went, “Oh, sod it,” and he just went —\n\nJT: “You’ve just made it.”\n\nSH: “I’ve been trying to write this for three days, but this is better!” So, it’s very useful to work with somebody like Jack who is not precious about the words at all. It’s a very happy crew of people where we are happy to get in each other’s back pockets. And it’s not even a best idea wins, it’s like, throw all ideas in and let’s all of us collectively think about what we’d like to see on stage. And what also is innovative, what’s new and —\n\nJT: And vote for the best one.\n\nST: Absolutely vote for it, yeah. Democracy.\n\nHow does one go about exploring the movement of a 200-year-old vampire? What inspirations are you drawing from in the physical vocabulary that you’re building?\n\nSH: A lot of the time, when you draw on references for movement vocabulary, you want to play to your audience. You need to look at who’s in the rehearsal room, which can be complicated when the actors are half your age and must carry a lot of the physical responsibility of characterization. I think this is a very filmic piece that’s also absolutely theatrical. That’s what we love about going back to it. We’re reminded that we went cinematic on it, but we insisted on theatricality. We have some really smart actors and performers in the room. If you start saying words like “insect-like” and “vertebra-first” and ask “Can you put that into the movement?” they are able to do that. There are quite a few moments where Eli’s on the climbing frame and all we say is, “Get yourself to the top, and now do it as if it’s a rewound piece of videotape.” It’s really shocking how quickly people get excited and start making good results. Yesterday, I said to some of the boys, “You’re a splattered puddle on the floor. Over the next two minutes, you have to stand up, but you can’t use your hands or fingertips.” They’re all making weird shapes, trying to stand up and falling over. That’s the world we love being in, and it’s a bit strange and funny during rehearsals. It has to be funny.”\n\nJT: Would you like me to demonstrate —\n\nSH: No.\n\nJT: Coming up and down there? [Points to rehearsal climbing frame]\n\nSH: Really, no.\n\nJT: Hard no?\n\nSH: No, strong no.\n\nHorror is a genre that we seldom see on stage. John, we talked about movement as an articulator of horror, but what other tools are you using as a director?\n\nJT: Putting horror on stage is very rare, and it’s been a fascinating project to research and work through with regards to Let the Right One In. I’ve thought about putting horror moments, or at least very disturbing moments, on stage before and have worked with illusionists and special effects people. It often ends up being funny. When audiences jump at something, they often laugh to balance it out, which is a natural reaction. For example, if there was a decapitated head and its eyes were open, the audience would probably laugh instead of being scared. In film, it’s easier to make things scarier. So, we were just very economical and efficient about what moments we chose. We were like, “We’re going to have three moments.” Obviously in the film there’s many more, but we were like, “We’re going to do three moments and we’re going to do them really, really well.” So that involved us working with our designers. There’s a blood one which is more disturbing than horror, but you really don’t know how it’s done. The audience isn’t sure if what they see is real, even though it’s right in front of them. And there’s a big jump scare moment, which is completely influenced by an adaptation of a Stephen King book. And a couple more things like that. We didn’t want to turn it into a horror-fest. But we drew and referenced lots of different genres of horror. And actually, what’s interesting is that the most horrible thing on stage is the bullying. So, despite all the special effects we’ve got, by far the thing that stays with me and disturbs me most is the manmade bullying.\n\nCan you talk more about that? How is the idea of bullying more present now?\n\nSH: I think the film was not afraid to tackle loneliness and bullying in young people, which made it all the more frightening. Given how we now exist post-2020, we’re way more aware of environments and places. A workplace is an example of that. It’s somewhere that behavior has gone unchecked for years and years. And certainly, that’s a lot to bring with us. Even though we were never in those rooms specifically, to think that it was going on around us does start to make you feel much more wary and aware of what people are coping with on a day-to-day basis. So, I personally feel, and I think I share this with John, that it’s been far more upsetting looking at certain moments. There’s a scene in Act One and a scene in Act Two that are both a lot harder to put on their feet because I think we just know more. People have been able to speak up, speak out, come forward and that has been incredible. Now we just know more about what people have been coping with quietly. We are definitely looking at all that stuff in a rehearsal room. They’re very delicate rehearsal sessions. They were before, and it’s not that we were blasé about it, but it’s definitely got an extra sensitivity to it. With knowledge comes power and responsibility. So, I think that’s what we’re acknowledging.\n\nJT: I completely agree with Steven. When we look at lonely, bullied, alienated teenagers, which Oskar and Eli both are for different reasons, you think about the last 10 years and how we’re all supposed to be beautifully connected through social media, et cetera, et cetera. But it has actually had the effect of making people feel lonelier and has really been challenging people’s mental health. All of that is very relevant to what we’re doing. Hopefully, people in the audience will see that that’s been acknowledged and feel slightly less lonely themselves.\n\nSH: But it is also interesting to talk about loneliness. There’s a moment in the show where Eli says, “I’ll be back here tomorrow night.” And I remember when we first met when we were 15, and we wanted to see each other all the time. So, we had to go to each other’s houses, and we couldn’t text. And you couldn’t even call cause the phone’s in the middle of the house and you don’t want your call listened to all the time.\n\nJT: Well, our dads wouldn’t let us use the phone.\n\nSH: No, you couldn’t call after seven o’clock.\n\nJT: No.\n\nSH: But it’s interesting, we are aware, we are more in line age-wise with the characters in the film. Some of the younger cast members were laughing at a line in the play the other day, I was like, “What’s funny about that? That’s my life there, thank you very much.”\n\nI can completely relate! This is the first time you have produced this show with an American cast. What does that feel like? Is there something different? Is there a different approach to the storytelling working with an American cast?\n\nJT: Yeah, absolutely. It’s sitting beautifully with an American cast. We had to do bits and bobs of word replacement. So instead of “sweet shop” it’s “candy store.” And “hooligan” has become “punk,” which I love the fact that we’ve got the word “punk” in the show, makes us feel like we’re doing West Side Story. But yeah, it sits very beautifully because it is about creating a community. And these actors have brought a huge amount to that. But they also know that, yes, they’re speaking in their own voices and their own dialects, but they are in a suburb north of Stockholm. So, all the chocolate bars, the candy bars have got Swedish names on. We are still in that world. But that’s like if you were to do a Chekhov play and keep it set in Russia, you would still do it with American voices. It’s working really, really well.\n\nSH: I think there’s something quite exciting as well about an American company, particularly the younger performers, because the show really focuses on the kids. We’ve absolutely upheld Scandinavian traits. Things like hope and optimism, they’re hard purchases in Scandinavia because you haven’t got much daylight, and you’re not by the beach and you aren’t surrounded by light. That’s not the country that they’re in. So, it’s working with them to play kids that are hard to break. But we’re getting a really lovely tonality, somewhere between a really front-footed American performance style and a Scandanavian one. They’re just starting to bleed into each other —\n\nJT: That was a terrible pun. You can edit that out. I’m kidding.\n\nSH: I’m saying, there’s a performance style that’s starting to come together in this third week that we’re feeling is very exciting for us. It’s got a little bit more color and...I was about to say bite. Honestly, I just can’t stop myself now.\n\nYou just spoke to how the story is centered around young characters, and while that is true, the play feels relevant to all ages. Why do you think that is? What observations have you made between how older and younger audiences are receiving the piece?\n\nSH: I think the audience response to it has gone across the ages and the demographics because there’s a very, very solid story about how the adults are trying to hold this together but aren’t capable. We’ve been talking about this endlessly the last few weeks about the Gen Z experience. They’ve come into the world in a digital age and have never known anything different. Parents and children do not speak the same digital language. We live in a world where it’s tricky for parents because there are deficiencies in their knowledge and experiences that they need to support their kids. You can see that reflected in this script. It’s done very quietly but the layers that have been built are expert. So, this is a show for older audiences as well.\n\nJT: And at the same time, young audiences love it in a way that they don’t. And we try and do a lot of work aimed at young audiences. My nephews who would’ve seen it in 2014-15 at the Royal Court, so they would’ve been in their early teens to late teens, they’re still like, “That’s the only show of yours that we’d see again.” I’m like, “Okay, I’ve done quite a few shows.” They’re like, “No, it’s the only one we want to see again.”\n\nHard to blame them! It’s an amazing show and we’re so honored to have it and the both of you here at Berkeley Rep to share this with our audiences!\n\nScreenshot of Steven Hoggett (left) and John Tiffany"
