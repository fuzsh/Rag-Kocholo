        "meta_description": "Author Summary The human genome is structurally dynamic, frequently undergoing loss, duplication, and rearrangement of large chromosome segments. These structural changes occur both in normal and in cancerous cells and are thought to cause both benign and deleterious changes in cell function. Many of these structural alterations are generated when two dispersed repeated DNA sequences at non-allelic sites recombine during non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR). Here we study NAHR on a genome-wide scale using the experimentally tractable budding yeast as a eukaryotic model genome with its fully sequenced family of repeated DNA elements, the Ty retrotransposons. With our novel system, we simultaneously measure the effects of known recombination parameters on the frequency of NAHR to understand which parameters most influence the occurrence of rearrangements between repetitive sequences. These findings provide a basic framework for interpreting how structural changes observed in the human genome may have arisen.",

        "text": "A genome-wide system to study NAHR events between Ty1/Ty2 families of repeats\n\nTy1 and Ty2 represent the most abundant families of dispersed repetitive elements in S. cerevisiae. Our system to study Ty-mediated NAHR relies on three components: (1) knowledge of the sequence and position of all Ty1/Ty2 elements in the genome, (2) strains with genetic features for the recovery of Ty-mediated NAHR events, and (3) a protocol to measure these events out of all possible outcomes. Below we provide a brief description of each component.\n\nAs a first step, we completed the sequence of the S. cerevisiae unannotated chromosome III Ty elements (Figure S1). With the completed sequence, we generated a map of the distribution of 37 full length Ty1s and 13 full length Ty2s [which includes 98 Ty-associated 5′ and 3′ long terminal repeats (LTRs)], and 208 solo LTRs (Figure 1A). The sequence and positional information is critical since it defines all potential Ty1/Ty2 recipients and donors in the S. cerevisiae genome, allowing us to determine whether some repeats are used and others are not in NAHR.\n\n(A) Diagram showing the insertion sites for Ty1/Ty2 families of long terminal repeats (LTR) retrotransposons on S. cerevisiae sixteen chromosomes, aligned by their centromeres (white circle). Insertion sites for full length Ty1 (black flag) and Ty2 (white flag) are shown as perpendicular lines above chromosomes while insertion sites for solo Ty1/Ty2 LTRs (also called deltas) are perpendicular lines below chromosomes. Continuous lines above and below chromosome show the same insertion site for full length Tys and solo LTRs. Ty1 and Ty2 are the most abundant of the Ty families and closely related, sharing almost identical LTR sequences. Note that the diagram is drawn to scale except for chromosome XII where 1–2 Mb rDNA array position is noted. Heat map representing the longest block of uninterrupted identity of pairwise comparisons between 50 Ty1/Ty2 in (B) and 306 LTRs (C) in the S. cerevisiae genome. Length of blocks are binned and colored in intervals of 250 base pairs (bp), as indicated in key below. Binning analysis based on MEPS of ∼250 bp, the minimal length of identity empirically determined for efficient NAHR in yeast [15]. Note that most comparisons are above this MEPS value (blue-shaded), predicting that the majority of Ty1/Ty2 pairings are competent for efficient NAHR. Details for (B) in Table S4 and (C) in Table S5.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1001228.g001\n\nThe potential for Ty elements to act as recipients and donors in NAHR depends in part on their sequence identity. The average percent sequence identity is 95.7±2.4% between Ty1s, 95.9±4.8% between Ty2s, and 73.9±3.4% between Ty1 and Ty2 (Table S3). Previous work has determined that recombination between model repeats decreases 9-fold with 99% identity and 50-fold with 91–94% identity relative to identical model repeats [11]. Thus the sequence divergence of the Ty1/Ty2 family could dramatically reduce the pool of potential Ty recipients and donors, limiting the number of elements that participate in NAHR.\n\nHowever, if the mismatches are clustered, rather than distributed evenly within the full length of Ty1/Ty2 (5.9 kb), then long stretches of identity may allow efficient NAHR. With this in mind, we analyzed the longest block of uninterrupted identity between all pairwise alignments of Ty1/Ty2, a parameter that has not been previously assessed for Ty elements. To evaluate the significance of these blocks, we categorized them according to the previously determined MEPS value of about 250 bp for NAHR [14], [15]. Recombination rates are predicted to significantly drop when lengths are below MEPS and proportionally increase when lengths are above MEPS [13].\n\nUsing our binning analysis, 73% of all Ty1/Ty2 alignments (891 out of 1225) have blocks of identity ≥250 bp (Figure 1B and Table S4). All pairwise comparisons between repeats within either the Ty1 or Ty2 family are above the MEPS value while 31% of pairwise comparisons between Ty1 and Ty2 repeats have a block of identity ≥250 bp. Thus, for the full length Ty1s and Ty2s, the shared blocks of uninterrupted identity strongly predict that a given Ty1/Ty2 recipient can undergo NAHR with many potential Ty1/Ty2 donors, thereby establishing a competition among donors. In contrast, only 1% of all LTR pairwise comparisons (544 out of 46,665) have a block of uninterrupted identity ≥250 bp (Figure 1C and Table S5). This limited length of uninterrupted identity between the LTRs predicts that they may be inefficient substrates for NAHR. In addition, sequence identity amongst pairwise comparisons of the 306 LTR elements widely range between 3%–100%, with an average of 59.6%±22.7% (Table S6). Thus the poor sequence identity between LTRs suggests that solo LTRs will be unfavorable substrates for NAHR.\n\nThe second component of our system is the use of specific strains to optimize the recovery of Ty-mediated NAHR events. In order to recover all possible NAHR events, we use diploid yeast where loss of genetic material can be complemented by homologs. In contrast, Ty-mediated rearrangements that occur in haploids may delete genes necessary for viability. Along with S. cerevisiae diploids (referred hereafter as “purebred”), we generated synthetic hybrid diploids by mating S. cerevisiae with a sequenced relative, S. bayanus (referred hereafter as “hybrid”) (Figure 2), which is largely devoid of Ty1/Ty2 elements [24], [25]. The diploids are genetically marked to allow identification of all cells that suffer an I-SceI site-specific DSB as well as the subset of cells in which the broken chromosome is repaired or lost (Figure 2 and see below). Like the purebreds, viability remains high after induction of an I-SceI-induced DSB in the hybrid diploids (Figure 2). In addition, the hybrid diploids grow well and are competent in DNA maintenance and repair like the purebred diploids (Figure S2). Since S. bayanus complements almost all the genes in S. cerevisiae [26], S. bayanus can also balance S. cerevisiae by suppressing any loss of gene function due to NAHR of the S. cerevisiae genome. However, in contrast to the purebred diploids, the hybrid diploids have three important advantages. The significant sequence divergence between the two genomes (62% intergenic, 80% genic) [27] suppresses AHR, favoring NAHR between the more homologous Ty1/Ty2 elements and thus enhancing the recovery of Ty-mediated NAHR events. The sequence divergence also facilitates the analysis of S. cerevisiae rearrangements by array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and PCR. Finally, the comparison of NAHR between the purebred and hybrid diploids allows the assessment of NAHR with and without AHR competition (Figure 2).\n\nTop: NAHR between S. cerevisiae Ty elements may be determined with or without allelic competition in S. cerevisiae purebred and S. cerevisiae/S. bayanus hybrid diploids, respectively. LEU2, HYG, URA3 are heterozygous in both diploids to classify events that occur on the S. cerevisiae chromosome III homolog containing the I-SceI cut site (cs, scissors). For more detail, see Figure 3 below. Bottom: Viability after a DSB in hybrid diploids (MH3360) and purebred diploids (MH3359). Relative viability assayed by colony forming units (CFUs) on –ade +2% galactose plates (continuous induction of I-SceI-induced DSB) compared to CFUs on –ade +2% glucose plates (no induction of DSB). Error bars indicate SD performed on four independent experiments.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1001228.g002\n\nThe third component of our system is an unbiased clone-based assay to determine the frequencies of NAHR events among all possible outcomes (Figure 3A). An I-SceI recognition sequence [referred to as the I-SceI cut site (cs)], along with a Hygromycin-resistance gene (HYG), is integrated at different positions on the S. cerevisiae chromosome III homolog. We choose to initiate a DSB on the S. cerevisiae chromosome III since this chromosome has the highest density of Ty1/Ty2 elements relative to all other chromosomes (see Figure 1A), making it a good model for the repetitive-rich chromosomes of higher eukaryotes. We initiate the DSB with the addition of galactose to the media for two hours in exponentially growing cultures to induce expression of the I-SceI endonuclease fused to the galactose promoter. Galactose induction of I-SceI expression leads to formation of a DSB at the 163cs position on one S. cerevisiae chromosome III homolog (Figure 3B), which activates recipient sequences adjacent to the break site to undergo a homology search. The cells are then plated onto nonselective YEPD media for individual colonies (referred to as clones). These clones are then phenotyped to determine whether the I-SceI-induced DSB occurred (HygS, see Figure S3) followed by chromosome repair (Leu+Ura+ or Leu+Ura−) or loss (Leu−Ura−). We find that the majority of I-SceI-induced DSBs are repaired in both the purebred (99±2%) and hybrid (79±5%) diploids, although the hybrid diploids exhibit a significant increase in chromosome loss (20±5%) compared to the purebred diploids (1±2%) (Figure 3C). HR mediates almost all of this DSB repair in both diploids since repair is nearly abolished when the essential HR protein Rad52 is absent (Figure 3C).\n\n(A) Flow chart showing the nonselective characterization of clones after galactose induction of I-SceI endonuclease (see text for details). Top: Map of S. cerevisiae chromosome III showing the I-SceIcs (scissors) at position 163cs (number refers to chromosome III SGD coordinates in kb); centromere, white circle; left telomere, black triangle; right telomere, white triangle. Tys are represented as open rectangles flanked by solid triangles (LTRs). Five Ty insertion loci are highlighted in red, left arm transposition hotspot (LAHS); orange, YCRCdelta6 (∂6); yellow, YCRCdelta7 (∂7); green, right arm transposition hotspot (RAHS); blue, far right arm transposition hotspot (FRAHS) (see Figure S1 for more detail of Ty elements). Bottom: Clones were scored for heterozygous genetic markers (LEU2, HYG, URA3) to determine whether the founding cell had experienced an I-SceI-induced DSB (Hygromycin-sensitive, HygS) followed by repair (class I, Leu+HygSUra+; class II, Leu+HygSUra−) or loss of the broken chromosome (class III, Leu−HygSUra−). Ty-mediated NAHR rearrangement structures from these repair classes (details in Materials and Methods) show recipient-donor partners at the recombination junctions according to Ty locus color in map above. (B) Southern blots showing that the majority of cells initiate the I-SceI site-specific DSB at 163cs after galactose induction in purebred (MH3359) and hybrid (MH3360) diploids. YCR024C probe also hybridizes to the other homolog in purebred diploids (smaller size than uncut band due to the absence of the 1.6 kb I-SceIcs/HYG construct). (C) Frequencies of S. cerevisiae chromosome III repair (class I+II) or loss (class III) after DSB in wild-type (MH3359) and rad52 (MH3475) purebred diploids, and wild-type (MH3360) and rad52 (MH3476) hybrid diploids. Error bars indicate SD. At least two independent experiments assayed for each strain. (D) PFGE/Southern analysis on representative repair clones in purebred (MH3359) and hybrid (MH3360) diploids. Note that, in purebred diploids, the uncut homolog contains leu2Δ1 allele which also hybridizes with the LEU2 probe and, in hybrid diploids, allelic HR occurs at a low frequency between the divergent homologs.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1001228.g003\n\nTo assess the structure of the repaired chromosome in the two genetic repair classes, a random subset of clones in each class are further analyzed by pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)/Southern analysis (Figure 3D). An I-SceI-induced DSB at the 163cs position that is repaired by AHR results in an unchanged chromosome III size whereas repair by NAHR results in a rearrangement with a changed chromosome III size (Figure 3D). Further aCGH and PCR characterization of the genetic repair classes reveals four types of chromosome III rearrangement structures with Ty elements localized to the recombination junctions (Figure S4 and see Materials and Methods). The Leu+HygSUra+ repair class I contains internal deletions, and the Leu+HygSUra− repair class II includes isochromosomes, rings, and translocations (see schematics in Figure 3A). The recovery of these distinct Ty-mediated NAHR rearrangements from one site-specific DSB reveals a competition between recipient and donor Ty elements for NAHR, validating our system as a means to study NAHR between complex families of natural repeats.\n\nRecipient competition revealed by break-distal recombination (BDR)\n\nA site-specific DSB in unique DNA allows us to assess the likelihood that break-distal repeats are activated as recipients in a homology search to facilitate NAHR. HR events that use a break-distal recipient for recombination are termed here as break-distal recombination (BDR). With 163cs positioned inside 18.1 kb of unique DNA on chromosome III (see map in Figure 3A), we tested the possibility for BDR by monitoring three potential Ty recipient loci (YCRCdelta6, YCRCdelta7, RAHS) at various distances distal from the break site. Because our assay employs no selection, we are able to calculate the frequencies of I-SceI-induced Ty-mediated rearrangements among all possible outcomes after the DSB (see Materials and Methods). Below we highlight the major points from the data compiled in Table 1 and Table 2.\n\nIn purebred diploids, 17% of cells after DSB at 163cs undergo NAHR through BDR to mediate rearrangements. Despite a sufficient length of unique sequences that can facilitate AHR with the identical homolog after the DSB, 15±6% of cells use the RAHS recipient, 0.3±0.3% of cells use YCRCdelta7, and 2±0.7% of cells use the YCRCdelta6 recipient located 11.7 kb, 28.9 kb, and 47.5 kb distal from the DSB, respectively (Figure 4A). To test the robustness of BDR, we changed a number of parameters. We eliminated the nonhomology immediately at the DSB ends (1.6 kb I-SceIcs/HYG construct) to test whether BDR is due to the presence of nonhomologous ends, which may inhibit the coordination of two-ended strand invasion events during GC [28]. However, with identity at the DSB ends, BDR is still observed, generating rearrangements (Figure S5). We further tested if BDR was specific to the 163cs position by moving the position of the DSB more centromere-proximal. With the I-SceI-induced DSB at 147cs, BDR-mediated Ty rearrangements occur in 3±3% of cells after DSB (Figure 4A). Interestingly, the frequency of YCRCdelta6/YCRCdelta7 usage is similar to when a DSB initiates at 163cs, suggesting that the usage of these LTR recipients is not determined by their distance from the break site. Lastly, we tested if BDR occurs when the I-SceI-induced DSB initiates on a different chromosome. BDR still occurs in 8±4% of cells after formation of a DSB on S. cerevisiae chromosome V to generate Ty-mediated rearrangements (Figure S6). Thus distal repeats mediate BDR despite the presence of break-proximal unique DNA that can effectively facilitate AHR. This result suggests that unique and repetitive recipient sequences at least 47.5 kb distal to a DSB can participate in recombination.\n\n(A) Top: Map indicating the distance of Ty recipients (orange, δ6; yellow, δ7; green, RAHS) from the I-SceIcs at two different positions, 147cs and 163cs. The distance indicates the minimal distance from a DSB that recipient sequences are used for recombination. Bottom: Frequencies of δ6, δ7, and RAHS recipients localized to recombination junctions of Ty-mediated rearrangements (BDR events) in purebred diploids with a DSB at 147cs (MH3469) and 163cs (MH3359). (B) Frequencies of outcomes after a DSB at 163cs in purebred (MH3359) and hybrid (MH3360) diploids. (C) Frequencies of δ6, δ7, and RAHS recipients localized to recombination junctions of Ty-mediated rearrangements (BDR events) in hybrid diploids with a DSB at 147cs (MH3471) and 163cs (MH3360). Note that RAHS and FRAHS generate internal deletions through single-strand annealing (SSA, see text below) and the RAHS assignment of “recipient” for these rearrangements aids in comparisons. Error bars indicate SEM.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1001228.g004\n\nTo test whether AHR competes with BDR, we analyzed BDR in the hybrid diploids. In the hybrid diploids, AHR is mostly suppressed compared to purebred diploids (3±4% of cells after DSB in hybrid compared to 82±6% of cells after DSB in purebred, Figure 4B), as expected from the extent of divergence between S. cerevisiae and S. bayanus genomes. Under these conditions of suppressed AHR, the frequency of BDR increases 4.5-fold compared to purebred diploids (increasing from 17% to 76%, Figure 4B), indicating that BDR competes with AHR. Furthermore, the distribution of different BDR-mediated rearrangements remains the same between hybrid and purebred diploids (compare Figure 4C to Figure 4A, and Table 1). Thus the presence of a divergent homolog at the break site enhances BDR-mediated rearrangements but does not alter preferences of Ty recipient and donors on chromosome III. This aspect of hybrid diploids makes them an excellent model to investigate the features of the recipients and donors that give rise to their preferred use.\n\nTo begin to define the parameters that influence the preferred use of recipient sequences to repair a DSB, we determined the largest block of uninterrupted identity between the recipient and its donor. The DSB at 163cs is positioned in the right arm of chromosome III distanced 57.4 kb from the centromere and 165.6 kb from the right telomere. Thus for AHR in purebred diploids, there is >50 kb of identity with the homolog on both sides of the DSB. In contrast, among the BDR events, the largest block of uninterrupted identity with the donors is 1,877 bp for the RAHS recipient, 29 bp for YCRCdelta7 recipient, and 98 bp for the YCRCdelta6 recipient. This reveals that the homology search in purebred diploids can be efficiently directed by 0.1%, 0.2%, or 3% (29, 98 or 1,877 bp out of 57,453 bp) of the potential recipient sequences activated by the DSB, and that this small fraction very distal to the break site generates rearrangements in a total of 17% of cells after DSB. In addition, the smaller and more break-distal solo LTRs, YCRCdelta6 and YCRCdelta7, compete effectively with the larger and more break-proximal RAHS cluster in both purebred and hybrid diploids (see Figure 4A and Figure 4C). These data are consistent with our analysis of AHR in hybrid diploids, where the recombinant junctions occur both proximal and distal to the break site (data not shown). Moreover, these hybrid allelic junctions do not coincide with the longest length of uninterrupted identity (138 bp) found between potential recipients through S. cerevisiae and S. bayanus chromosome III alignments. Thus the relative effectiveness of repetitive and unique recipient sequences competing next to the DSB is not solely predicted by length of uninterrupted identity or distance from the DSB.\n\nDonor competition dictated by an intrachromosomal position bias\n\nOur characterization of Ty-mediated NAHR events also allowed us to investigate the preferred usage of Ty donors with a DSB at 163cs. Intrachromosomal Ty sequences are used as donors in 75±4% of hybrid and 17±6% of purebred cells after DSB at 163cs, generating internal deletions, isochromosomes, or chromosome rings (intra-NAHR in Figure 5A and Table 1). In contrast, only 1±0.7% and 0.3±0.3% of cells after DSB at 163cs produce Ty-mediated interchromosomal translocations in hybrid and purebred diploids, respectively (inter-NAHR in Figure 5A and Table 1). Thus despite the greater number of potential inter- than intrachromosomal Ty donors (see Figure 1A), Ty donors on the same chromosome are preferred approximately 50 times more than Ty donors on a different chromosome.\n\n(A) Frequencies of intra- and interchromosomal NAHR events after a DSB at 163cs in wild-type (MH3360), msh2 (MH3699), msh6 (MH3692), sgs1 (MH3455) hybrid diploids. Internal deletions, isochromosomes, and rings are ‘Intra-chr. NAHR’, translocations are ‘Inter-chr. NAHR’, and remaining outcomes (allelic and loss) are ‘Other’. Percentages for Inter-chr. NAHR and Intra-chr. NAHR indicated in white and black, respectively. (B) Top: Ranking of sequence identity of chromosome III recipients (δ6, δ7, and RAHS) with intrachromosomal donors (LAHS and FRAHS) out of all donors in the S. cerevisiae genome (out of 305 LTRs for δ6 and δ7, out of 49 Ty1/Ty2 for RAHS). Since multiple Ty elements are present at RAHS, LAHS, and FRAHS, only the highest ranking through local identity (BLAST) comparisons are indicated. *#3 donor ranking for RAHS recipient is attributed to the oppositely oriented YCRCTy1-4 at FRAHS. However, YCRCTy1-5 (#15 out of 49) at FRAHS likely mediates internal deletions due to its direct orientation with RAHS. Bottom: Position of the top three potential interchromosomal donors (#1–3 based on local identity) with chromosome III recipients (orange, yellow, and green correspond to δ6, δ7, and RAHS recipients, respectively). Since YCRWTy1-2 and YCRWTy1-3 are both present at RAHS, top three potential interchromosomal donors for each are indicated as #1a–#3a (green triangle) and #1b–#3b (green square), respectively. Symbols are as Figure 1A. Details of the ranking lists are in Table S7 and Table S8.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1001228.g005\n\nAgain as a first assessment, we wondered whether the NAHR biases for intra- over interchromosomal donors and amongst the two intrachromosomal donors (LAHS and FRAHS) are dictated by sequence identity between the donors with its Ty recipient. We generated a ranked list of sequence homology, comparing the three Ty recipient elements distal to 163cs (YCRCdelta6, YCRCdelta7, RAHS) with all potential Ty donor elements in the genome. We find that the intrachromosomal Ty donors (LAHS and FRAHS) are not among the most identical by either percent sequence identity or the longest block of uninterrupted identity (Figure 5B and Table S7, Table S8). Of the intra-NAHR Ty partners, we also find no correlation with the extent of sequence homology between the chosen Ty donors and their frequency of usage. For example, in the hybrid diploids, 61±3% of cells after DSB generate internal deletions between RAHS and YCRWTy1-5 at FRAHS (97% identity, 1,635 bp largest block of uninterrupted identity) whereas only 3±1% of cells after DSB generate a chromosome ring between the same RAHS recipient and the LAHS donor (97% identity, 1,877 bp largest block of uninterrupted identity). Furthermore, relaxing the stringency for sequence identity in NAHR using msh2Δ/msh2Δ, msh6Δ/msh6Δ, and sgs1Δ/sgs1Δ mutants in hybrid diploids does not abolish the intrachromosomal donor preference (Figure 5A), further suggesting that the preferred usage of donors is not due to sequence identity [29], but donor position. Similar to the findings for the usage of recipient sequences for NAHR, the preferred usage of Ty donors is neither dictated nor can be predicted by sequence homology. Thus the primary determinant of Ty donor choice during NAHR is genomic position, with ∼50-fold preference for intrachromosomal over interchromosomal donors.\n\nIntrachromosomal position effect is due to the inefficiencies of NAHR pathways\n\nSequence homology between the Ty1/Ty2 families failed to dictate the recipient and donor competition during NAHR. One explanation is that each Ty-mediated rearrangement requires different genetic factors (Table 1), suggesting that they are generated through distinct NAHR pathways. Since HR pathways are known to compete after a DSB, we examined how this competition affected recipient and donor choice. In the hybrid diploids with the I-SceI-induced DSB in unique sequences at 163cs, 61±3% of cells form internal deletions between the RAHS recipient and the FRAHS donor (Table 1). These deletions form independent of RAD51 suggesting they occur through SSA (Table 1). RAHS also mediates isochromosomes (3±1%) and rings (3±1%) with the LAHS donor, and translocations with interchromosomal Ty donors (1±0.7%), all of which have Rad51-dependencies (Table 1). Thus the same RAHS recipient mediates internal deletions 20–40 fold higher than isochromosomes, rings, or translocations, suggesting that SSA dominates the NAHR pathway choice to generate Ty-mediated rearrangements when a DSB occurs in unique sequences.\n\nWith at least four NAHR pathways operating after the DSB at 163cs (suggested by the different genetic dependencies of the Ty-mediated BDR rearrangements, see Table 1), we then asked if these NAHR pathways were in competition with one another. To address pathway competition, we attempted to abolish or enhance particular NAHR pathways by removing their intrachromosomal donors and/or repositioning the I-SceIcs in the hybrid diploids. We then compared changes in the frequencies of the Ty-mediated rearrangement product as a readout of their NAHR pathway, where compensatory effects indicate competing pathways. In addition, since Rad51-independent SSA and Rad51-dependent pathways have been shown to compensate for each other after a DSB and hence compete [22], [30], our analysis groups the NAHR pathways into these two distinct HR mechanisms.\n\nWe first eliminated the dominant SSA pathway by deleting the FRAHS donor (FRAHSΔ, B in Figure 6) and looked for compensation through the remaining rearrangements. These rearrangements are grouped as Rad51-dependent NAHR since rings show full Rad51-dependency while isochromosomes and translocations have partial Rad51-dependency (Table 1). While some Rad51-dependent rearrangements show a modest increase (rings increase 3±1% to 11±3%, Table 2), the majority of cells cannot repair the DSB at 163cs without SSA, resulting in chromosome loss (71±3% loss, Figure 6). One possibility for this repair inefficiency is that the DSB is too far from the Ty recipients (at least 11.7 kb from the break site) to effectively activate the recipients in Rad51-dependent NAHR pathways. This would be consistent with evidence that Rad51 binding is limited to about 5 kb on either side of a DSB [31]. We then repositioned the I-SceIcs at 151cs, within 0.1 kb of the RAHS recipient in the FRAHSΔ strain (C in Figure 6), in order to enhance Rad51 presynaptic filament assembly onto RAHS. Although a modest increase in Rad51-dependent rearrangements was observed, the majority of cells after the DSB at 151cs with FRAHSΔ cannot efficiently repair the chromosome in the absence of SSA (58±2% loss, Figure 6). These data reveal that Rad51-dependent NAHR pathways induced by a DSB in unique sequences (163cs or 151cs) are inherently inept at repairing the DSB using Ty1/Ty2 elements. Taken together, for a DSB in unique DNA, the efficiency of the SSA pathway coupled with the inefficiency of Rad51-dependent NAHR pathways generates the intrachromosomal position bias and preferential usage of Ty recipients and donors.\n\nTop: Schematic of three S. cerevisiae chromosome III configurations (A–C) analyzed in hybrid diploids. A = 163cs (MH3360), B = 163cs with FRAHSΔ (MH3524/MH3572/MH3573), C = 151cs with FRAHSΔ (MH3551). Ty-mediated BDR products for configuration A are shown below map for A. BDR recipients that mediate each rearrangement are connected with a dashed grey line to the BDR product, with intrachromosomal recipient (left of dashed grey line) and intrachromosomal donor (right of dashed grey line) partners at the recombination junctions indicated by color. Bottom: Frequencies of NAHR pathways (SSA and Rad51-dependent) and chromosome loss after a DSB in hybrid diploids strains with configuration A–C. Inter-Ty deletions are ‘SSA’; rings, translocations, and isochromosomes are ‘Rad51-dependent NAHR’; chromosome loss is ‘Loss’, and remaining outcomes (other and allelic in Table 2) are ‘Other’.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1001228.g006\n\nMutagenic potential of DSBs in the genome\n\nOur findings show that the I-SceI-induced DSB in unique DNA (147cs, 151cs, or 163cs) generates substantial NAHR between Ty repeats, giving rise to a broad spectrum of rearrangements through BDR in the purebred diploids. This is in contrast to current models that propose that break-proximal sequences determine the outcome, where DSBs in unique DNA lead to AHR (between sisters or homologs) and DSBs in repetitive DNA can lead to NAHR [32]. To assess the relative consequence of DSBs in unique versus repetitive DNA, we repositioned the I-SceIcs into the RAHS locus (called RAHScs, Figure 7) and used our nonselective assay to measure all possible outcomes after the DSB at RAHScs in hybrid and purebred diploids. From the repair clones generated in our assay, we further characterized two Ty-mediated products that exclusively arise with the DSB at RAHScs, intra-Ty deletions and Ty GC. These Leu+HygSUra+ repair clones are distinguished from each other by assaying RAHS locus size using PFGE/Southern analysis (Figure S7). In comparison to the wild-type RAHS size, we observe a smaller RAHS size for intra-Ty deletion events and a similar RAHS size (with only the removal of the small nonhomologous 1.6 kb I-Scecs/HYG ends) for Ty GC events.\n\nTop: Schematic of S. cerevisiae chromosome III with I-SceIcs inside YCRWTy1-2 of RAHS (referred to as RAHScs). Two main repair products resulting from a DSB at RAHScs are shown below. (1) Intra-Ty deletion likely occurs through SSA within RAHS, indicated by the presence of only one black arrow at RAHS (referred to as ‘intra-Ty’ to distinguish from ‘inter-Ty’ deletions that occur between RAHS and FRAHS). (2) Ty GC likely occurs through a Rad51-dependent pathway and maintains RAHS size, indicated by two black arrows present at RAHS and grey Ty repair patch. Bottom: Frequencies of Intra-Ty deletion and Ty GC events after DSB at RAHScs in hybrid (MH3768) and purebred (MH3764) diploids. ‘Other’ refers to inter-Ty deletions, isochromosomes, rings, translocations, other NAHR, allelic, and loss (see Table 2).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1001228.g007\n\nSimilar to results with the DSB at 163cs, SSA dominates the NAHR pathway competition, with 66% and 61% of cells after DSB at RAHScs generating Ty-mediated deletions in hybrid and purebred diploids, respectively (Table 2). SSA again imposes a strong intrachromosomal position bias, dictating recipient and donor preferences. The internal deletions from RAHScs, however, can be generated between the RAHS recipient and two different Ty donors, sequences within RAHS itself (referred to as intra-Ty) and FRAHS (now referred to as inter-Ty). All of the internal deletions in purebred diploids are intra-Ty events (61±9%) whereas in hybrid diploids, 59±9% are intra-Ty and 7±5% are inter-Ty (Figure 7 and Table 2). This is consistent with previous work describing a proximity effect during SSA using model repeat donors, with break-proximal donors preferred over break-distal donors [7].\n\nIn addition to the events observed with a DSB at 163cs, we find that the second most frequent event after DSB at RAHScs is Ty GC. 22±8% and 33±10% of cells after DSB at RAHScs lead to Ty GC events in hybrid and purebred diploids, respectively (Figure 7). The lower frequency of Ty GC relative to intra-Ty deletions measured in our diploids are in agreement with those events measured using an HO-induced DSB inside Ty1 in S. cerevisiae haploids [33]. Ty GC occurs through the coordination of a two-ended strand invasion event into a Ty donor, which is not a possibility when the DSB initiates in unique DNA (as for 163cs). These GC events in the hybrid diploids must be mediated by a non-allelic Ty donor from the S. cerevisiae genome (since S. bayanus lacks Ty1/Ty2), which likely occurs in purebred diploids as well [16]. Thus, paradoxically, NAHR efficiently mediates conservative repair when a DSB occurs in repetitive DNA.\n\nHaving completed our analyses of a DSB within a Ty1 repeat, we can now compare its impact to a DSB in unique DNA on genome integrity. We categorized the outcomes of the I-SceI-induced DSB at RAHScs and at 163cs into two groups: (1) change in gene copy number (inter-Ty deletion, isochromosome, ring, translocation, and chromosome loss) and (2) no change in gene copy number (intra-Ty deletion, Ty GC, and allelic). This comparison reveals that the DSB in unique DNA is 3 to 5-fold more likely to cause a change in gene copy number than the DSB in repetitive DNA (increases from 19% to 97% in hybrid diploids and 6% to 19% in purebred diploids, Figure 8). Thus, distinct from models that highlight the role of DSBs inside repeats in mediating genome rearrangements, our results suggest that the relative mutagenic potential of a DSB in the genome actually decreases when the break occurs within repetitive DNA. Furthermore, this finding suggests that DSBs in unique DNA are more likely to lead to mutagenic rearrangements than DSBs in repetitive DNA.\n\nFrequencies of outcomes after DSBs in repetitive DNA (at RAHScs) in hybrid (MH3768) and purebred (MH3764) diploids versus DSBs in unique DNA (at 163cs) in hybrid (MH3360) and purebred (MH3359) diploids. Outcomes are categorized into two classes: (1) ‘Change in gene copy number’ (black) are inter-Ty deletions, translocations, chromosome rings, isochromosomes, other NAHR, and chromosome loss (percentage indicated in white text), (2) ‘No change in gene copy number’ (white) are intra-Ty deletion, Ty GC, and allelic HR.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1001228.g008"
