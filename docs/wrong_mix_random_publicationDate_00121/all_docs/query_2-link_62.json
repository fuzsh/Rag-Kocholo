        "text": "Ida Mae Dunham, passed away peacefully at The Home of the Good Shepherd on March 28, 2024 at the age of 99 years and 9 months. She was born in Moline, Illinois to Guy Rodgers and Bertha Simcox Rodgers.\n\nIda’s life had many chapters: sadness, sorrow and happiness. She was a fighter and proved to be very resilient. Losing her father as a teen was the first of many losses, all contributing to a strong sense of empathy. Her first marriage in 1944 was to Robert Eng who had just enlisted in the Marine Corp and went on to fight in Iwo Jima. They had three children; Mary, Robert and Carol. The marriage ended due to the trauma of war, leaving her to raise the children in Moline while working various jobs.\n\nIn 1956, she married Charles Dunham who provided a stable home life for her and her children. Charles adopted her three children, and together they had a son, Richard.\n\nThe family relocated to Orange County, California in 1966. Ida’s greatest heartbreak came in 1970 with the unexpected loss of her 19-year-old daughter, Carol.\n\nIda’s varied occupations included managing a candy store, operating a small motel in the Mojave Desert, owning a café in Northern California, and cooking at a nursing facility. Upon retirement she and Chuck had many happy years of traveling throughout the country, eventually settling in Texas. For the past twelve years, they have resided in Saratoga Springs to be closer to their son, Richard, and his family.\n\nIda enjoyed simple pleasures: needle point, bingo, conversation, and cooking for others.\n\nIda was preceded in death by her brother Loyal and her sister Verna Beckman, daughters Carol and Mary, and husband of 67 years, Charles.\n\nShe leaves behind her sons Robert and Richard (Siobhan); three grandchildren, Bill and Steve Willard and Deirdre Dunham; one great-grandchild, Connor Willard; son-in-law Jess Willard (Mary); and many loved nieces and nephews.\n\nThe family wishes to thank the caring staff at The Home of the Good Shepherd and The Wesley Nursing Center, as well as the doctors and nurses of Saratoga Hospital.\n\nCalling hours are planned for Thursday, April 4 from 6:00 to 8:00 at Compassionate Care Funeral Home, Saratoga Springs, NY. Burial will occur on Friday, April 5 at Saratoga National Cemetery.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations can be sent to The Wesley Foundation, the Saratoga Hospital Foundation, or The Community Hospice."
