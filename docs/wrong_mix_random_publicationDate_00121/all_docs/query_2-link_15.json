        "text": "These are the five overarching philosophies and beliefs that encompass how we should approaching educational leadership at the classroom, building and district level. THE POWER OF WE: There is a solution to every challenge. If WE collaborate and work together, we can accomplish anything. Nobody should be working in isolation and we should all strive to bring people together to be a partner in the important work that we are all doing. Before we make decisions we are going to ask; WHAT IS BEST FOR KIDS?: There will be difficult decisions that we have to make each and every day. Sometimes adults may not like the decisions. Sometimes parents may not like the decisions. Sometimes you won’t like the decisions yourself. That’s ok. If we are making decisions based on what is best for kids, we are going to be just fine. WE VALUE EVERYONE: We want everyone who comes into our school buildings or shows up at any of our facilities or events to feel welcomed, safe, supported and that they belong. We have a lot of different job titles, but nobody in any organization is more important than anyone else. Everyone brings value and everyone is a critical piece of our overall success. KAIZEN. Kaizen is Japanese for ‘continuous improvement.’ Most organizations do a lot of things really well, but there is always room for improvement. Embracing continuous improvement isn’t a weakness, it’s actually a strength acknowledging that we can improve. If WE are willing to evolve, grow and improve as a district and community, the sky’s the limit in terms of what we can achieve. HAVE FUN. Never underestimate the importance of having fun! Fun is a key to vitality, which gives us energy, strength and hope. I’d argue that if you aren’t making the time to have fun each day, you’re probably never going to reach your full potential. #school #success #people #energy #community #educationalleadership"
