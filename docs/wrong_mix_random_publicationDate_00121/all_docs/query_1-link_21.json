Contact Ms. Huang at m.huang@phillipsblack.org.\n\nStephen Lazar is a legal apprentice at the Philadelphia Office, and a formerly incarcerated person who was sentenced to die in prison for a crime he did not commit. While incarcerated he worked in the prison law library assisting fellow prisoners with their legal woes and became a certified legal reference aide by the state of Pennsylvania. He also participated in numerous criminal justice think tanks as well as the Inside/Out program earning credits towards a degree. In March of 2023, Mr. Lazar was fully exonerated and released after serving sixteen years of his death by incarceration sentence. Mr. Lazar regularly speaks at colleges about the horrors of the criminal justice system, and he and a group of other exonerees work to help recently released prisoners adjust to society. Contact Mr. Lazar at s.lazar@phillipsblack.org."
