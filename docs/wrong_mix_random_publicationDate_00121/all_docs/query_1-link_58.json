        "text": "Sue Biggins, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center\n\nLee Hartwell Lecture\n\nThe Lee Hartwell Lecture is given by a noted researcher in the field who has used yeast in a way that has had an obvious impact on other fields\n\n2024 Lecture: Sue Biggins is a Professor at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center and an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute who studies the mechanisms that ensure accurate chromosome segregation and regulation of the cell cycle. Her lab achieved the first isolation of kinetochores and has been applying structural, biophysical and biochemical techniques to elucidate the mechanisms that assemble kinetochores and ensure accurate kinetochore-microtubule interactions and spindle checkpoint regulation. Her lab also works on the mechanisms that ensure centromeric chromatin composition and identity.\n\nPrevious Lectures:\n\n2022: Michael Desai, Harvard University\n\n2020: Doug Koshland, University of California, Berkeley\n\n2018 – Fred Winston, Harvard Medical School\n\n2016 – Susan Gasser, Friedrich Miescher Institute\n\n2014 – George Church, Harvard Medical School\n\n2012 – Stan Fields, University of Washington, Seattle\n\n2010 – Randy Schekman, University of California, Berkeley\n\n2008 – Mitsuhiro Yanagida, Kyoto University\n\n2006 – Kim Nasmyth, Oxford University\n\n2004 – Susan Lindquist, Whitehead Institute\n\n2002 – Leland Hartwell, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center\n\nMaitreya Dunham, University of Washington, Seattle\n\nIra Herskowitz Award\n\nThe Ira Herskowitz Award is given for outstanding contributions in the field of yeast research in the last 20 years.\n\n2024 Recipient: Maitreya Dunham is Professor and Interim Chair of Genome Sciences at the University of Washington. Her lab studies genome evolution in yeast using a variety of genetics and genomics approaches. Particular interests include mechanisms and consequences of copy number variation; how yeast evolve in the lab, the classroom, and the brewery; and using yeast to characterize genetic variants from other species, including humans.\n\nThis award is usually given to scientists under 50.\n\nPast Recipients:\n\n2022: Maya Schuldiner, Weizmann Institute of Science\n\n2020: Jonathan Weissman, University of California, San Francisco\n\n2018 – Mike Cherry, Stanford University\n\n2016 – Lars Steinmetz, Stanford University\n\n2014 – Olga Troyanskaya, Princeton University\n\n2012 – Angelika Amon, MIT\n\n2010 – Brenda Andrews, University of Toronto\n\n2008 – David Drubin, University of California, Berkeley\n\n2006 – Charles Boone, University of Toronto, Canada\n\n2004 – Jef Boeke, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine\n\n2002 – Mark Johnston, University of Colorado\n\nJim Haber, Brandeis University\n\nLifetime Achievement Award\n\nFor lifetime contributions in the field of yeast genetics and outstanding community service.\n\n2024 Recipient: Jim Haber is Professor of Biology and Director of the Rosenstiel Basic Medical Sciences Research Center at Brandeis University. His lab pioneered the physical monitoring of the repair of chromosomal double-strand breaks (DSBs) in budding yeast, both in meiosis and in mitotic cells. They have described in detail several pathways of nonhomologous end-joining and homology-dependent recombination. Recent work has focused on: the regulation of the DNA damage checkpoint; the high rate of mutation accompanying DNA synthesis during DSB repair; and the roles of DNA damage-associated chromatin modifications.\n\nPast Recipients:\n\n2022: Tom Petes, Duke University School of Medicine\n\n2020: Nancy Kleckner, Harvard University\n\n2018 – Steve Oliver, University of Cambridge\n\n2016 – James Broach, Penn State University\n\n2014 – Jeremy Thorner, University of California, Berkeley\n\n2012 – John Pringle, Stanford University\n\n2010 – Paul Nurse, The Rockefeller University\n\n2008 – Elizabeth Jones, Carnegie Mellon University\n\n2006 – Fred Sherman, University of Rochester Medical School\n\n2004 – Ron Davis, Stanford University\n\n2002 – Gerald Fink, Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research\n\nMichael Knop, Zentrum für Molekulare Biologie der Universität Heidelberg (ZMBH)\n\nWinge-Lindegren Address\n\nThe Winge-Lindegren Address is a thought-provoking perspective, given by a leader in the field of yeast genetics\n\n2024 Address: Michael Knop is a Professor at Heidelberg University in Germany. His lab is interested in developing new methods, reporters, and instruments for molecular biology imaging and systems biology. His research uses quantitative approaches and focuses on dynamic intracellular processes, such as the regulation of the cytoskeleton and developmental processes through protein diffusion and gradient formation, as well as the regulation of protein turnover and homeostasis.\n\nPrevious Addresses:\n\n2022: Trisha Davis, University of Washington, Seattle\n\n2020: Mike Snyder, Stanford University\n\n2018 – Virginia Zakian, Princeton University\n\n2016 – Rodney Rothstein, Columbia University\n\n2014 – Anita Hopper, Ohio State University\n\n2012 – Andrew Murray, Harvard University\n\n2010 – Jasper Rine, University of California, Berkeley\n\n2008 – The Cold Spring Harbor Yeast Group: Jeff Strathern, NIH; Amar Klar, NIH; Jim Hicks, Cold Spring Harbor Lab\n\n2006 – Chris Guthrie, University of California, San Francisco\n\n2004 – André Sentenac, CEA/Saclay\n\n2002 – David Botstein, Princeton University"
