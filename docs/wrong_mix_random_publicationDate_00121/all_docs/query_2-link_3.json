        "text": "The purpose of the Foundation is to enhance the quality of education of the students of Washington County School District by providing the resources necessary through private funding that are not provided through the traditional sources.\n\nThe students we serve are the future leaders of our communities, our state and our country. They may be our doctor, our lawyer, our home builder or our grocery store manager. What ever their dream is, we can help them accomplish it. If our students are given a more enriched education and are learning stronger skills, they will help our country to remain strong. We invite you to help us with this effort. Your donation to any of our programs will assist us in helping our students and teachers."
