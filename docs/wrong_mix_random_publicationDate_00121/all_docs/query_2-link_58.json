        "text": "Will Dunham served for seven years as former Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy’s (R-CA) top policy director and liaison to House committees, the Senate and executive branch, through every type of political terrain—House majority and minority, and Democrat and Republican administrations.\n\nAs the lead House Republican staffer in bipartisan, bicameral negotiations, Will developed a deep understanding of the legislative process. His negotiating experience spans from perennial NDAA and appropriations endgames, to crisis legislation including emergency COVID packages, to more granular issues like international sanctions and California water issues. Drawing from these case studies, his intuition and expertise helps clients sort between advocacy strategies that just make noise and those that make law.\n\nDuring his more than 13 years in Congress, Will also served as executive director to now-House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA) at the Republican Study Committee, where he worked to provide tools to over 160 Republican House members to craft, analyze and advance policy. This is in addition to his time working in the office of Rep. Tom McClintock (R-CA) where he handled budgetary issues. Will’s first job in Washington was as a staff writer for the Heritage Foundation."
