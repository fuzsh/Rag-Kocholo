        "text": "CHEMISTRY\n\nChair: Stephen Dunham\n\nProfessor: Salter\n\nAssociate Professors: Shari Dunham, Stephen Dunham, Holliday\n\nAssistant Professors: Fianu\n\nAdjunct Professors: Floyd\n\nInstructor-Lab Coordinator: Farina\n\nMission: The Department of Chemistry provides a student-centered academic environment in which students discover, engage with, and reflect on concepts and techniques central to Chemistry and Biochemistry. Our curriculum integrates liberal arts and professional education. Students will develop skills that are essential to the practice of science: general reasoning, critical thinking, problem solving, leadership and teamwork, written and oral communication, and self-assessment and reflection.\n\nThe chemistry major at Moravian University provides you with a fundamental understanding of chemical concepts and their application to current problems. Beginning in the general chemistry course and throughout the curriculum, you'll explore chemical principles by carrying out experiments using modern chemical instruments. You'll receive hands-on experience with analytical techniques such as optical and infrared spectroscopy, gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. You may choose to work with faculty members on research projects in theoretical, analytical, physical, organic, inorganic, or biochemistry. The department's courses, equipment, and resources have been reviewed and approved by the American Chemical Society, and we offer coursework and research experiences that lead to an ACS-certified B.S. degree in chemistry.\n\nThe Moravian University chemistry major provides a foundation for graduate study in chemistry, biochemistry or medicine, and for careers in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. In conjunction with the teacher certification program in our education department, chemistry majors can qualify for secondary school teaching certificates in general science.\n\nThe Major in Chemistry\n\nThe major in chemistry consists of nine courses: CHEM 113, 114, 211, 212, 220.2, 222, 331, 332 and 370.2. The remaining course is selected by the student with the approval of the major advisor. Chemistry majors also must take MATH 170 (or its equivalent sequence MATH 106 and 166), MATH 171, and PHYS 111 and 112.\n\nThe Minor in Chemistry\n\nThe minor in chemistry consists of five course units: CHEM 113, 114, 211, 222, and either 212 or 331.\n\nThe Interdepartmental Major\n\nThe six courses that compose Set I of the interdepartmental major in chemistry include CHEM 113, 114, 211, and 222. The remaining courses in chemistry and the six courses of Set II are selected by the student with the approval of the advisor.\n\nDepartmental Recommendations\n\nStudents planning graduate work in chemistry are advised to take additional advanced courses in chemistry, mathematics, computer science, physics, or biology.\n\nStudents wishing to obtain a bachelor's degree certified by the American Chemical Society are required to take a total of 13 chemistry courses. These must include those required for the basic major, plus CHEM 311, CHEM 327, CHEM 341, and one additional 300-level CHEM course. Students are encouraged to use independent study (CHEM 381) or Honors (CHEM 400) to fulfill the final course requirement.\n\nStudents seeking certification to teach chemistry in secondary schools complete the requirements for a departmental major and the requirements for certification described under education and science education. Students interested in combining chemistry and general science certification should consult the requirements for general science certification under science education.\n\nCourses in Chemistry\n\nCHEM 100.
