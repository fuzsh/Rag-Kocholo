        "text": "The Baton Rouge State Fair Foundation presented a $10,000 check to The Dunham School on Monday, April 17, 2023, in honor of Roy Carnegieâs years of volunteer service to the organization, including his tenure on the Board of Directors of the Greater Baton Rouge State Fair.\n\nThis donation is the first installment of a gift from the foundation that will establish The Roy Carnegie Greater Baton Rouge State Fair Scholarship Fund, which will underwrite an annual tuition grant awarded to a Dunham Upper School student who demonstrates excellence in scholarship, leadership, and community service.\n\nThis is the second scholarship fund started at Dunham by the Baton Rouge State Fair Foundation. In 2016, the Foundation established the Warren J. Wilson Greater Baton Rouge State Fair Scholarship Fund in honor of Warren Wilsonâs 40 years of service to the State Fair. In 2020, the foundation presented Dunham with an additional donation to endow the scholarship for a total value of $50,000 in honor of Mr. Wilson's 50 years of service. Mr. Wilson is the father of Dunham alumna Loret Wilson â89.\n\nBaton Rouge State Fair Foundation Board Chair Greg Edwards joined Mr. Carnegie to present the check to Head of School Steve Eagleton and Director of Development Kelly DeRossette. Teri and Warren Wilson, Loret Wilson, Cliff Barton, and Grayson Atol â29 were also in attendance.\n\nThe Greater Baton Rouge State Fair will hold its 2023 event from October 26-November 5. Details about the 2023 event can be found on the State Fair website, www.gbrsf.com."
