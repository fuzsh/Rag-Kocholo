        "text": "Staff\n\nCurrent\n\nPaul Burnett is the director of the Oral History Center. He joined OHC in 2013 from the Science and Technology Studies Programme at St. Thomas University in New Brunswick, Canada, where he was an Assistant Professor. Before that, Paul spent a year in Philadelphia researching and producing museum exhibits for the American Philosophical Society. He completed his PhD at the Department of History and Sociology of Science at the University of Pennsylvania in 2008, where he developed his research on the politics of expertise—how scientists and experts of all kinds establish their credibility, and how people choose between different kinds of expertise to try to solve complex social, political, scientific, and technical problems. He is currently writing a book on agricultural economics, neoliberalism, and development.\n\nDavid Dunham is the technology lead for the OHC and serves as website manager, video editor, and project interviewer. Since 2002, David has overseen the OHC website, leading efforts to digitize sixty years of oral history transcripts; he also coordinates transcription, equipment, and audio/video production and editing. He is OHC’s primary liaison with the Library Systems Office, coordinating preservation, digitization, and online content. David manages the Rosie the Riveter / World War II Home Front Oral History Project in collaboration with the National Park Service. He has participated in and contributed to numerous project-related community events, including talks recruiting narrators, programs sharing results of the interviews, video presentations, tours, and exhibits. He is a documentary film maker and editor, film festival manager, teacher, and “Entotainment Guru” of the Bay Area.\n\nRoger Eardley-Pryor earned his Ph.D. in History from the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) in 2014. At UCSB, he became a National Science Foundation graduate fellow in the Center for Nanotechnology in Society. Prior to that, Roger earned his B.Phil. in Interdisciplinary Studies from Miami University in Ohio. As a historian of science, technology, and the environment, Roger taught courses at Portland State University, at Linfield College in Oregon, and at Washington State University in Vancouver, Washington. From 2015-2018, Roger held a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in the Center for Oral History at the Science History Institute (formerly the Chemical Heritage Foundation). His work there explored ways that twentieth and twenty-first-century scientists and engineers, culture-makers, and political actors have imagined, confronted, or cohered with nature at various scales, from the atomic to the planetary. In 2018, Roger joined the Oral History Center of The Bancroft Library at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nShanna Farrell is a Historian/Interviewer and Associate Academic Specialist. She joined OHC in 2013 and her background is in environmental history and now specializes in cocktail and food history.

Todd earned a BA and MA in history from California State University, Sacramento, and a PhD in history from Yale University. From 2013 to 2016 he was a postdoctoral scholar with the Bill Lane Center for the American West at Stanford University, where he has served as the lead historian and researcher on the Center’s Rural West and California Coastal Commission initiatives. He joined OHC in April 2016. A native Californian, he has written extensively on the history of California and the American West, and is the author of the forthcoming book on Ronald Reagan’s governorship, The Fruits of Fracture: The Corporate West, The United Farm Workers’ Movement, and the Rise of Reaganism in American Politics.\n\n​Jill Schlessinger likes to help people learn and grow, share what they have to offer, and organize stuff. That’s how she ended up working for many years in communications and higher education management at UC Berkeley, the UC Office of the President, and Kaiser Permanente. Throughout her career, Jill has had the opportunity to teach and train young talent, work on issues like access to higher education and equitable health care for underserved communities, and provide people (including students, parents, health care workers, philanthropists, and politicians) with the information they needed to make informed decisions. Since Jill joined the Oral History Center in 2019, she’s worked to improve workflow and processes, mentor undergraduate editorial assistants, and share the marvelous work of the Center’s interviewers with scholars and the public. Jill received her PhD from UC Berkeley in U.S. history, with a focus on social history and women’s history at the turn of the 20th century.\n\nElizabeth Semler is a medical and business historian who joined the Oral History Center in October 2023. She received her PhD from the University of Minnesota’s Program in the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine, where her academic work focused on the relationship between food and chronic diseases in the United States and the Nordic countries. Her dissertation interrogated the intersections of epidemiological research, American business interests, and the development of public health prevention policies in the twentieth century. During her time at the University of Minnesota, Elizabeth taught undergraduate and adult-education courses on medical and technological history. She also participated in numerous public-facing history projects, including museum exhibits, educational websites, and film documentaries. Taken together, this work has fed Elizabeth’s passion for collecting, preserving, and making history accessible to broad audiences.\n\nAmanda Tewes is a Historian/Interviewer and Associate Academic Specialist. She joined the OHC in February 2018. She earned her BA from University of California, Santa Barbara; MA from California State University, Fullerton; and PhD in history from University of Massachusetts, Amherst, where she studied modern US history, public history, and the history of the American West. Her dissertation examined Old West theme parks in California as sites of public memory and historic preservation. She previously worked as an oral historian at the San Diego History Center and the Center for Oral and Public History at California State University, Fullerton.\n\nRetired\n\nCaroline Crawford is a part time interviewer with OHC. A native Californian, she received a BA from Stanford University, an MA from the University of Geneva, and a keyboard degree from Royal Colleges of Musicians, London. From 1972 to 1981 she was the staff writer for the San Francisco Opera, managed the San Francisco Contemporary Music Players from 1981 to 1985, and that year joined the OHC staff as music interviewer. Among the nearly forty music projects she has carried out are a jazz/blues series of histories, including subjects Dave Brubeck, John Handy and Norma Teagarden, and a series on contemporary American composers. Her blues documentary film entitled “Jimmy Sings the Blues” won the first jury prize at the Marin County Film Festival in 2005. Since 1975 she has written music reviews and published photographs in a number of newspapers and magazines, including Christian Science Monitor, New York Times, San Francisco Chronicle, and Opera News.\n\nSally Smith Hughes (retired) is a Historian of Science and Academic Specialist, Emerita. Over her thirty-plus year career at the OHC, she was project director and interviewer for several hundred oral histories in basic science, biotechnology, public health, and AIDS history. A major research interest is the complex process through which basic science is commercialized, as featured in interviews with scientists at UC San Francisco, UC Berkeley, and Stanford, and with administrators and scientists at Genentech, Chiron, and Amgen. An interview series with early Bay Area venture capitalists extends the theme of commercializing science. She also conducted interviews on the response of the San Francisco medical and nursing professions to the early AIDS epidemic. With a University of London doctorate in the history of science and medicine, she published The Concept of the Virus: A History and Genentech: The Beginnings of Biotech, as well as articles in Isis, The Bulletin of the History of Medicine, and The Oral History Review, as well as numerous book reviews.\n\nAnn Lage (retired) is an affiliate scholar and Academic Specialist, Emerita. She retired in 2011 as a research interviewer in the fields of natural resources and the environment; California political and social history; and the history of the University of California. She directed projects on the disability rights movement, the Department of History at Berkeley, the Berkeley Office of the President, the Sierra Club, and the Point Reyes National Seashore. Ann served as associate director of the Regional Oral History Office from 1994 to 2000 and acting director in 2000-2001. She holds a BA and MA in History from Berkeley.\n\nMartin Meeker (retired) was with OHC from 2003, when he was a Social Science Research Council postdoctoral fellow, until his retirement in 2022. Between 2004 and 2012, Meeker served as an interviewer/historian with the center and conducted interviews in several areas, including the history of politics and public policy, health care delivery systems and medical research, and wine and foodways. Between 2012 and 2016, Meeker was associate director of the center and from 2016 to 2022 he served as the center’s fifth director. After receiving his doctorate in U.S. history from the University of Southern California, Meeker taught at San Francisco State University and at UC Berkeley. He has published numerous reviews and encyclopedia articles and has essays published in Pacific Historical Review, Journal of the History of Sexuality, and Journal of Women’s History. Meeker’s books include The Oakland Army Base: An Oral History (2010) and Contacts Desired: Gay and Lesbian Communications and Community, 1940s-1970s (2006).\n\nLisa Rubens (retired) is a Historian and Academic Specialist, Emerita. While at OHC, she worked on a wide range of projects including Women at UC Berkeley, social movements and community politics in the Bay Area [Berkeley’s 1964 Free Speech Movement; The Oakland Army Base; and Affordable Housing], and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Her own research has centered on the interpretation and reception of mass culture and the role of women, labor and students in social movements and politics. Rubens taught for ten years at the community and state college levels before receiving her PhD in U.S. history from UC Berkeley in 1997. Her dissertation on San Francisco’s 1939 World’s Fair is a cultural and political history of race and regionalism, currently under review for publication by the University of Pennsylvania Press.
