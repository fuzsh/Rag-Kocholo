        "text": "The West Hartford-based Ron Foley Foundation will host its Kentucky Derby event on May 4, raising funds to fight pancreatic cancer.\n\nSubmitted\n\nIt’s time to don your Derby Day best for the 15th annual Ron’s Run for the Roses!\n\nThe Ron Foley Foundation is thrilled to announce its annual Derby Day fundraiser will take place on May 4, from 2:30 to 7:30 p.m. at the Farmington Polo Club. All proceeds from the event will benefit the Foundation’s mission to promote early detection, awareness, and raise funds for pancreatic cancer research and patient aid.\n\nGuests at Ron’s Run for the Roses can expect an afternoon filled with southern fare, refreshing mint juleps, lively music, and an array of exciting activities, including live and silent auctions with unique items and experiences up for bid. The highlight of the evening will be a live viewing of the Kentucky Derby on a big screen.\n\n“We are thrilled to celebrate our 15th annual Ron’s Run for the Roses fundraiser,” said Barbara Foley, founder and president of the Ron Foley Foundation. “This event holds a special place in our hearts as we honor the memory of my late husband, Ron, and continue our mission to make a difference in the fight against pancreatic cancer.”\n\nThe Foundation is thrilled to welcome Joe Furey, co-chief meteorologist at News 8 WTNH and meteorologist at iHeart and WZBG Radio, as the Master of Ceremonies for the event. Also in attendance will be Steve Dunham and his team from New Country Mercedes-Benz, the Presenting Sponsor of the event, as well as this year’s Honorary Chair, Mike Mahoney, owner of RLM Co., West Hartford’s oldest family-owned commercial real estate company.\n\nThe Foundation was started by Barbara Foley to honor the memory of her husband, Ron, who lost his battle with pancreatic cancer in 2005. Ron was a respected business leader who had just retired from The Travelers Insurance Company. His loved ones were determined to make a difference in the fight against pancreatic cancer. The Ron Foley Foundation, Inc. was granted 501(c)(3) status in 2010. Its mission is to promote early detection through awareness and education and to raise funds for medical research and direct patient aid.\n\nPancreatic cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. The American Cancer Society estimates that approximately 66,440 Americans will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2024, and about 51,570 will die from the disease. Pancreatic cancer has the highest mortality rate of all major cancers, with only 13% surviving more than five years.\n\n“We are grateful for the ongoing support from our sponsors, donors, and the community,” added Barbara Foley. “Together, we can make a meaningful impact in the fight against pancreatic cancer.”\n\nTo purchase tickets to Ron’s Run for the Roses or to donate to the Foundation, please visit their website, www.ronsrun.org."
