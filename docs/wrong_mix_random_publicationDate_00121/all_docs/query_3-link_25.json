These students walk in the footsteps of creative greats such as Andy Warhol, Truman Capote, Richard Avedon and Sylvia Plath, all of whom won Scholastic Awards when they were teens. More recently, Stephen King, Myla Goldberg, Zac Posen and Lena Dunham have become celebrated alumni of the program.

The Scholastic Art & Writing Awards empower students, giving them an outlet to show their passion for the arts and grow their individual talent. As a creative professional myself, I am inspired by each and every one of these students.”\n\nKay WalkingStick, renowned artist, 1947 Scholastic Art & Writing Award winner and 2014 Alumni Achievement Award Recipient, shared, “The memory of winning a Scholastic Art & Writing Award as a teenager is one I have drawn upon throughout my career as an artist. A creative path is one of hills and valleys and having that reassurance early on added to my strength to see through any challenges to persevere and evolve. I hope each student who wins remembers and cherishes the moment no matter what they choose to be in their careers.”\n\nVirginia McEnerney, Executive Director of the Alliance for Young Artists & Writers noted, “The 2014 Scholastic Art & Writing Award winners have once again blown us away with their talent and vision. There is so much promise in the room when we have them gathered together in New York City. We know we are meeting tomorrow’s leaders and problem-solvers, so while they are here, we are honored to celebrate their creativity, treat them as professionals by displaying their work and encourage them to share their talent and learn from each other.”\n\nThe 2014 National Celebration calendar of festivities includes:\n\nJune 5 – The First-Ever Maker Prom: The Roosevelt Hotel will be transformed for this teen-only event that will mix dancing with interactive stations in line with the Maker Movement.
