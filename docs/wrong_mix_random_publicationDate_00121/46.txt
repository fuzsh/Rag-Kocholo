Jonathan Dunham alias Singletary

The story of Jonathan Dunham alias Singletary is a complicated one. There is a lot of information available concerning him, but it appears that there is also much that is unknown. What is known has been the subject of a range of speculation and different interpretations. There is no question that he was a prominent man, who was held in high esteem by many for much of his life. Some of the records are very harsh and critical of Jonathan and his actions, and they have led to the speculation that there were two very different sides to him and his life. My personal interpretation is that it is doubtful that he was a "dual personality" as has been speculated. It seems much more likely to me that he was a forceful and prominent personality, who was deeply involved in the political and religious dynamics of his time, and who was seen as very controversial by his detractors. There is evidence that he was involved with the Quakers, who at the time were seen as bizarre by the Puritans and were persecuted by them. It seems very possible that this is the root cause of much if not all of his controversy.

The records show that he was born as Jonathan Singletary on January 17, 1639/40, in Salisbury, Essex County, Massachusetts. His father was Richard Singletary and apparently his mother was Susanna Cooke. There is speculation that he might have been the child of an earlier and at this point unknown wife of Richard. What is known is that he after he moved with his wife's family to Woodbridge, New Jersey, he called himself Jonathan Dunham alias Singletary. The speculation about his mother is that perhaps her name was Dunham, and Jonathan began to use it in deference to her. It has also been speculated that he changed his name to flee from or in some way hide from his controversial past in Massachusetts. The biggest problem with this explanation is that he doesn't seem to have broken his ties with Massachusetts and he does not seem to have made any effort to lose the Singletary name completely. In many records, he and his family members identified themselves as Dunham alias Singletary.

Another explanation came from the following story, which has been passed down through the family for many years. Although it seems perhaps farfetched, in many ways it also seems more plausible. As passed on to me by Bea Webb, she related that her grandmother told her that Jonathan's father Richard Singletary, was actually a son and heir of the House of Dunham in England. There were apparently two branches of the Dunham family and Richard was reportedly the last male heir of the older branch. Reportedly, if he were to die, the title and estates would pass to the nearest relative in the younger branch. According to what was told by Richard's former nanny on her deathbed, she was hired to murder the child, but could not bring herself to do it. She said that instead she took the child on an arduous trip on a ship to New York, and she that left the child in New York with the Captain of the ship, and she returned to England. She stated that because the child was alone and separated from all family ties, she had given him the name of 'Single-Tarry.' Reportedly the Captain adopted Richard and kept the name the nanny had given him. The conclusion of the story is that Jonathan reverted to the name of Dunham because he felt that this was his true family name.

Jonathan grew up in Essex County, Massachusetts, which is where he met and married Mary Bloomfield, daughter of Thomas and Mary Bloomfield. The date of their marriage is apparently not known, but it must have been before 1662. There is a record in that year of Jonathan's parents conveying a piece of land to Mary, identified as the wife of Jonathan. It was about that time that Jonathan seems to have been involved in his first controversy. He was apparently drawn into in a series of legal disputes with a John Godfrey. At one point he was jailed for a time and at another point he reportedly accused Godfrey of witchcraft. Sometime around 1665, Jonathan and Mary left Essex County, Massachusetts and relocated to Woodbridge, Middlesex County, New Jersey, apparently with Mary's parents. It is not clear why they did this, but apparently Thomas Bloomfield was one of a number of prominent men invited to emigrate there by the newly appointed Governor of New Jersey. As noted above, with this move Jonathan began to call himself Jonathan Dunham alias Singletary.

Jonathan became a prominent citizen in Woodbridge. In 1670 "Jonathan Dunham, alias Singletary, and Mary his wife, formerly of Hauesall in ye Massachusetts colony" are given a 213 acre grant of land in consideration of Jonathan building the first grist mill in Woodbridge Township. He later acquired a number of other tracts of land also. The old mill that he built was apparently used for many generations and was reportedly still standing in 1870. The millstone itself is still in existence, and can be seen on display at the Trinity Episcopal Church in Woodbridge, New Jersey. The house that Jonathan built in 1671, adjacent to the mill, was reportedly built of brick from Holland that was used a ballast in ships. Although it has apparently been significantly refurbished, it is still standing. It currently serves as the Rectory of the same Trinity Episcopal Church. In 1671 Jonathan was listed as acting as the foreman of a jury, and also as the overseer of the highways. In 1673 he was elected as member in the New Jersey Assembly. In 1675 he served as the Clerk of the Township Court. As mentioned above there are some controversial and somewhat disturbing records concerning Jonathan. In 1677 he was called a "mad man" by the Council of War for the Achter Colony and apparently punished in some manner. Later that same year he was arrested for removing goods from Governor Phillip Careret's house and he was condemned for the act.

There were a couple of stories from about 1681 involving Jonathan and apparently several Quakers, which were recorded by Cotton Mathers about 20 years later. The first apparently took place in Long Island, New York and involved Jonathan and a group of Quakers, one of whom was brutally and mysteriously murdered. The second apparently occurred in Plymouth, Massachusetts and involved Jonathan and a couple Quaker women, including a Mary Ross. They reportedly engaged in some bizarre behavior, including the killing of a dog. There is a Court record from Plymouth from 1683, which apparently concerns this later incident. Jonathan was condemned by the Court for his actions, and ordered to be publicly whipped and to leave town.

It is hard to make sense of these controversial records, particularly in light of all the good things that Jonathan seemed to have been involved in during this period. A number of researchers have reported the derogatory statements made against Jonathan as if they were completely objective reports, and then filled in the blanks with what amounts to conjecture. In all likelihood there is a great deal of bias and prejudice in these records, and there is much that is unknown about them. I think that there could be a political explanation for the earlier incident and a religious explanation for the later one. It was suggested that

Jonathan left Woodridge and abandoned his family as a result of the problems from 1677, and that he later became involved with the Mary Ross in some very inappropriate way. There is nothing to support this. In a document from 1689, Jonathan writes, "being frequently abroad in parts remote." It seems clear that whether it was for business, religious, or personal reasons, Jonathan seems to have traveled between New Jersey, New York, and Massachusetts. In 1702 he was given the power of attorney to dispose of the lands given him by his parents in Massachusetts. This seems to indicate that despite the problems he had there, he still maintained ties. There is nothing to support that he ever abandoned his family and responsibilities in Woodbridge. The same Mary Ross from the incident in Plymouth, was in Woodridge in 1689, and involved in some sort of legal transaction with both Jonathan and his wife Mary. The fact is, the dynamics of these events and relationships are not at all clear from the information that is available.

Jonathan's wife Mary reportedly died in Woodbridge in 1705. Jonathan is reported to have lived there another 18 years. He was involved in several more land transactions in 1717, 1720, and 1721. I am not aware of any record of his death, but there was document dated April 24, 1724, in which his son Jonathan noted that his father Jonathan Dunham had lately deceased. Reportedly Jonathan is buried near his house in Woodbridge. Oliver B. Leonard reports that a Woodbridge historian named Mr. Dally, wrote of Jonathan, "This Dunham was a man of great energy. When he determined upon an enterprise he pushed it forward to success with indomitable perseverance. So many of his relatives settled in the north of the Kirk Green that the neighborhood was known as Dunhamtown for many years."

There are two known DUNHAM lines of early colonial ancestry. One line descends from Deacon John Dunham of Plymouth, Massachusetts (ca 1630). Another line descends from Richard Singletary (born 1599 England, died 1687 Haverhill, Massachusetts).

Richard Singletary's eldest son, Jonathan Singletary, for some unclear reason, changed his name to "Jonathan Dunham alias Singletary." This change came about when he moved his family from Massachusetts to Woodbridge, Middlesex County, New Jersey about 1674. He became one of the early founders of that community. He and his children signed their names as "alias Singletary" in a known deed record. Thus all DUNHAMs (and its variants of DONHAM, DUNNAM, etc.) who descend from Jonathan are actually SINGlETARYs according to genetic link and only DUNHAM by surname. Jonathan is the only son of Richard Singletary who took the surname DUNHAM. All of Richard's other children continued to bear the surname of SINGLETARY, as do their descendants.

A recent (2002) DNA testing of one bearing the SINGLETARY surname and one bearing the DUNHAM surname proved a common ancestor...that being Richard Singletary. Thus this SINGLETARY-DUNHAM genetic line does not match with the other DUNHAM line out of early Massachusetts. Just why Jonathan changed his name from Singletary to Dunham is unknown, and at this time various theories, stories, & legends arise to its evolution.

(3) Benjamin Dunham (son of Jonathan Dunham alias Singletary and Mary Bloomfield) was born 22 Aug 1681 in Woodbridge, Middlesex, NJ, and died 31 Dec 1715 in Woodbridge, Middlesex, NJ. He married Mary Rolph on 1706 in Woodbridge, Middlesex, NJ, daughter of John Rolph and Mary Scullard.

Children of Jonathan Dunham and Mary Smith were-Benjamin Dunham, born 17 Nov 1738, Woodbridge, Middlesex, NJ, died 18 Jun 1765, Woodbridge, Middlesex, NJ., Elizabeth Dunham, born Bet. 27 Dec 1739 - 1740, Woodbridge, Middlesex, NJ, died date unknown, Samuel Dunham, born 11 May 1742, Woodbridge, Middlesex, NJ, died 18 Feb 1824, Back Creek Valley, Berkeley, VA., Asher Dunham, born 15 Jul 1744, Woodbridge, Middlesex, NJ, died date unknown, Parrsborro, N.S. Canada, William Smith Dunham, born 24 Nov 1746, Woodbridge, Middlesex, NJ, died 03 Aug 1799, Woodbridge, Middlesex, NJ., and Hannah Dunham, born 05 Oct 1748, Woodbridge, Middlesex, NJ, died date unknown, Woodbridge, Middlesex, NJ.

(5) Samuel Dunham (son of Jonathan Dunham and Mary Smith) was born 11 May 1742 in Woodbridge, Middlesex, NJ, and died 18 Feb 1824 in Back Creek Valley, Berkeley, VA. He married (1) Unknown. He married (2) Hannah Ruble on Abt. 1770 in Pa?, daughter of David Ruble and Sarah Malin.

(Note) Samuel Dunham probably was born in 1752 probably in Piscataway, Middlesex, NJ, and died February 18, 1824 in Back Creek Valley, Berkeley Co. VA. 1783 tax records of Berkeley County: Samuel Dunham: 1 w tiltable 3 horses and 3 cows. 1787 Virginia Census, Berkeley County: Samuel Dunham: Four horses, five cattle. He first bought land (117 acres) in Berkeley County on June 13 1791. He settled in Back Creek Valley Co. VA about 1776. This area in Frederick Co. later became part of Berkeley Co. VA (now WV). Back Creek Valley was first settled in 1721-1735. Jeremiah Smith and two friends explored Black Creek in 1730 and returned to their homes in New Jersey to prepare families to emigrate. He is placed in this family line as the son of Samuel Dunham and Mary Lucas without complete proof of such relationship, but given this connection as his most probable parentage. There is very strong circumstantial evidence supporting this parentage. Nine generations of his descendants have lived continuously in Berkeley County since 1783 when he is first recorded as living there. Many of them are still farmers. He was a farmer all his life, having a total of 611 acres of land in his estate. In 1810 he owned 2 slaves (shown on Census). It is rumored that his ancestors came to America in 1671. SOURCE: The Dunham Family in America 1752-2000,Second Edition Pg. 1 by David Lee Dunham.

Hannah's maiden name is believed to be Ruble, the daughter of David Ruble and Sarah Malin of Washington Co. PA. In the deed from Berkeley County in 1791 where David Ruble sold to Samuel Dunham his first land for 100 lbs. "and other just causes". This was a common wording in that time that there was a relationship between the two parties. Also her first child was named Sarah and her second child was named David.

Emily (Dunham) Briggs's husband William Briggs's obituary - William Briggs died at home in Fieldon, Sunday, April 27, 1902, age 63 years. The funeral was held from the Presbyterian church in Fieldon, Rev. I. D. Crawford officiating. He was born in Greene County and was the 15th of 16 children. William Briggs was a Lieutenant in Company E, 6th Mo. Inf volunteers. Burial was in Fieldon Cemetery. Among one of the earliest ones to enlist for the service of his country, under the Union banners, at the breaking out of the Civil War. A company was formed composed of men from Greene, Jersey and Calhoun counties, but their services were not accepted by the government, as it was thought that no more assistance would be needed. They were determined to enter the service, and enlisted as a body in the 6th Missouri regiment, under Colonel Bland at St. Louis. They began service in Missouri and their first fighting was at Pilot Knob. From there they went up the Missouri River to Jefferson City, thence to Tipton, and were in the famous forced march of General Fremont from Tipton to Springfield. After finishing service there they went to Shiloh, and then to Corinth, which they captured. From there they went to Memphis, Tennessee, then to Chickasaw Bayou, where the regiment lost 85 men in ten minutes. Then to Arkansas Point, and settled down to the seige of Vicksburg, where our subject assisted in making the famous canal, while in charge of a fatigue squad. He was in the whole seige there and participated in the capture of the city. He was left in charge of the sick in his regiment for awhile and joined it later on at Camp Sherman on Black River. They came up the river to Memphis and marched to Chattanooga where they participated in the celebrated crossing of the river on pontoons, then went to Knoxville to relieve General Burnsides. They wintered in Bridgeport, Alabama, and in the spring of 1864, Mr. Briggs re-enlisted and came home on veteran furlough. After 60 days he joined Sherman at Dalton, Georgia, and from that point was with him on his world-renowned march to the sea, participating in all the engagements. His regiment went with Sherman up through the Carolinas to Washington, and participated in the last grand review of Sherman's army at the National Capitol. His regiment then went to Louisville, Kentucky thence to Little Rock, Arkansas where they were discharged, and afterwards were mustered out at St. Louis, Mo., only 30 men being left out of 110 who enlisted. Mr. Briggs was 1st Lieutenant of Co E, 6th regiment of Missouri, when mustered out. He had been orderly sergeant from the end of his first year's service until the time of his promotion. At the close of the war he came home, and in 1867 was married to Emily Dunham, daughter of Amos and Mary (Barr) Dunham. From Jerseyville Republican, May 1, 1902.

-------------------

Benjamin Dunham was born in Berkeley county, Va. on the 30th day of Oct. 1822. He is the son of David and Catherine (Burkhammer) Dunham. His father was born and raised in the state of Virginia, his mother was a native of Pennsylvania. Benjamin was the youngest of a family of 10 children. When he was four years of age his parents moved to Hamilton county, Ohio, locating about 18 miles from Cincinnati. After they had lived there about eight years, his father died. They lived in Ohio 10 years, then came by wagon to Illinois, in the month of October 1836, and located in Macoupin county, northeast of Greenfield. While living there his oldest brother, Samuel, who had consumption, died during that winter. Benjamin and his mother remained in that county one year, and then moved to English township, Jersey county, and raised on crop on the farm now owned by John Garrel. From here, Benjamin and his mother moved in with his next older brother, Amos Dunham, and lived with him until Benjamin purchased 40 acres of land from Mr. Eastwood, about 1844, where his present residence now is. Benjamin's mother lived here with him until her death in 1853. She is buried in what is called Armstrong cemetery, in English township. Benjamin was married on the 30th of Oct. in 1850 to Ann Eliza Reddish, born Jan. 10 1831 in what is now Jersey county. She is the daughter of Stephen and Sallied Reddish. Mr. and Mrs. Dunham have been the parents of 14 children, 11 whom are living: Henry C., born Aug. 30, 1851; John, born May 8, 1853, died March 18, 1873; Walker, born Aug. 2, 1854; Juliette, born Feb. 28, 1856; Virginia Ann, born April 22, 1857, died June 24, 1869; Stephen A. Dougles, born June 11, 1858; Emmer, born Dec. 3, 1859; Lloyd, born March 30, 1861; an unnamed infant born Sept. 25, 1862, died Mary 3, 1863; Benjamin F., born Jan. 20, 1864; Charles H., born Feb. 6, 1866; Oscar, born Oct. 16, 1867; Oliver P., born Nov. 18, 1869; Hattie Belle, born Sept. 8, 1871. Mr. Dunham's farm at first contained 40 acres, but he has added to this until it now contains 213 acres, and on this he built a new residence in 1884. He raises stock, as well as grain. The extent of improvements on his and neighboring farms may be seen by comparing the present condition with what it was when he first located there. It was then a wild country, with deer and wild game to be found in abundance. He has seen as many as 15 deer at one time, and has killed numbers of them. The last one killed in this neighborhood was shot by him, it being in among the sheep. He has also killed great numbers of wild turkeys and other choice species of game, which were then more plentiful than the most common kinds now are. It is difficult to imagine the changes that have taken place in that time, but Mr. Dunham, in the half-century that he has spent here, has witnessed its transformation from a wilderness to a continued series of cultivated fields and the homes of hundreds. In those early days, like other pioneers, he had to haul his grain to a mill and grind it himself, with his own team.
