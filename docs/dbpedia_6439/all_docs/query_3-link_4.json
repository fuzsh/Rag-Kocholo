        "text": "Take your film inside, plug it in your VCR, hit the Play button and sit down. Listen to the sound of your footsteps on the film as you look at the visual images you recorded.\n\nThere's nothing like the sound of footsteps to build suspense. And pretty soon listening to the sound of your footsteps, as you walked around carrying the camera, will drive you nuts. The suspense leads to no insight, no point, no realization about what you were recording, except that maybe your yard has chinch bug. Or your dog needs a bath.\n\nWe humans have a natural thirst to find answers to questions that are raised by no more than just hanging out. And Booth Tarkington knew exactly on what he was going to hang the plot climax in his classic, \"The Magnificent Ambersons.\"\n\nRight from the beginning he raises implied questions. As Gainesville reader Odetta MacLeish-White points out, the novel asks, \"How do the established members of a community accept newcomers? Do they have a choice? What happens to those who blindly refuse 'progress'?\"\n\nThe ending of this novel is so carefully chiseled that it is clear to me Tarkington had the plot all worked out in his head before he even wrote the first sentence. The danger of this is that the plot will feel forced. And I do think the ending of this novel feels that way. Yet, when the main character, George Minafer, is run over by one of those new-fangled automobiles, which he earlier predicted would never last, such delicious irony results, the forced feeling is forgivable.\n\nAnd therein lies the answer to the novel's implied question - that only those who \"roll with the punches\" survive to keep punching. It's almost as if Booth Tarkington is doing what Charles de Gaulle once said at a news conference: \"Gentlemen, I am ready for the questions to my answers.\"\n\nGainesville reader Matt Coleman says, \"A fitting end came to the Ambersons because they were a family mired in the culture of a bygone era.\" Yes, it is only George Minafer who survives when he makes enormous changes at the last minute. I guess we could even say that Georgie had his new mindset knocked into him. The reason this book has stuck around and is considered a classic is that it gives us a picture of America as the automobile entered our landscape and changed our culture.\n\nIf Booth Tarkington were still here, I'd ask him if I am right on the money with my read, or if I am out to lunch in thinking he had the whole novel worked out before he began.\n\nOther writers prefer to have a map to where they are going but not to know exactly all the turns and detours. This gives the plot more of an organic feel. And when I asked Ellen Wittlinger, author of \"Gracie's Girl,\" if she had the plot all worked out before she wrote the first line, she said: \"No. I like to see where my characters will lead me.\"\n\nI also asked Ellen about my favorite part - when the narrator, Bess, dresses in vintage clothes to start middle school. And where did this idea come from?\"\n\nEllen spills the beans: \"I did for many years wear vintage clothes and still enjoy poking around a good thrift store. But my daughter Kate wore outlandish outfits when she was in middle school. When I asked her why, she said, 'If I don't dress this way, I feel invisible.' I understood that, although I wasn't sure she was becoming visible in the best way. But I stole that idea directly from Kate and gave it to Bess.\"\n\nThis week, steal some minutes to begin our new novels, which raise a whole new set of questions. In each of these books there is a narrator who asks us to join him in finding answers to questions he can no longer live with. Reuben in \"Peace Like a River\" and Lafayette in \"Miracle's Boys\" are each haunted by a different traumatic event.\n\nWatch how skillfully Leif Enger raises a compelling question at the end of the first chapter in \"Peace Like a River\": what was the worst night of Reuben's life?\n\nIn \"Miracle's Boys,\" the narrator Lafayette raises several questions, but the main one is why he feels responsible for his mother's death.\n\nYes, these are intriguing novels. So dig in, follow the trail with us as we read together to discover the answers."
