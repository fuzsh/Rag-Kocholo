        "text": "With only two pictures to his credit, last year's extraordinary \"Citizen Kane\" and now Booth Tarkington's \"The Magnificent Ambersons,\" Orson Welles has demonstrated beyond doubt that the screen is his medium. He has an eloquent, if at times grandiose, flair for the dramatic which only the camera can fully capture and he has a truly wondrous knack for making his actors, even the passing bit player, behave like genuine human beings. And yet, with all his remarkable talent, Mr. Welles still apparently refuses to make concessions to popular appeal. The Capitol's new film, however magnificently executed, is a relentlessly somber drama on a barren theme.In a world brimful of momentous drama beggaring serious screen treatment, it does seem that Mr. Welles is imposing when he asks moviegoers to become emotionally disturbed over the decline of such minor league American aristocracy as the Ambersons represented in the late Eighteen Seventies. While one may question Welles' choice of theme, as well as his conception of the Tarkington novel, it must be admitted that he has accomplished with marked success what he set out to do. For \"The Magnificent Ambersons\" is a dignified, resourceful character study of a family group, which incidentally reflects the passing of an era.This time Welles does not participate as actor, but he does lend his impressive voice as an off-screen narrator, setting the scene and introducing the characters in much the same manner as he used to do on the radio. As the film opens, town gossipers are busily passing around word that beauteous Isabel Amberson is giving up fun-loving Eugene Morgan, because he imbibed too much and crashed through a bass fiddle, to marry the stuffy but more socially acceptable Wilbur Minafer.Their marriage produces one son, George Amberson Minafer, a devilish, spoiled brat for all his beautiful golden curls, who imbues the elder townspeople with one burning desireâ€”to witness the day that George gets his \"come-upance.\" With the collapse of his grandfather's fortune George gets his \"come-upance\" with a vengeance in young manhood. But before fate delivers its humbling blows, the vain, arrogant youth cruelly wrecks the tender bittersweet romance that has been renewed between his now widowed mother and her old suitor, himself a widower and father of the girl whom George loves.Tim Holt draws out all of the meanness in George's character, which is precisely what the part demands. As the mother, Dolores Costello proves that she is too beautiful and capable an actress to remain inactive for such long periods. Agnes Moorehead, playing the role of a romantically frustrated aunt, is splendid. Other fine performances are contributed by Ray Collins, Anne Baxter and the veteran Richard Bennett as the grandfather. Joseph Cotten, who has shown fine promise, gives an adequate though not distinguished performance as Eugene Morgan, a role which is not too well written.All in all, \"The Magnificent Ambersons\" is an exceptionally well-made film, dealing with a subject scarcely worth the attention which has been lavished upon it.\n\nTHE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS, screen play by Orson Welles; based on the novel by Booth Tarkington; produced and directed by Mr. Welles for RKO Radio Pictures.Eugene Morgan . . . . .
