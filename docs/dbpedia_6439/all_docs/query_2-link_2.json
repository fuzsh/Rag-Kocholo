        "text": "It may seem that a comparison of Citizen Kane and The Magnificent Ambersons is a bit of a cheat as they may, to a casual observer fall under the umbrella of somewhat depressing films from the golden age of Hollywood. However, Orson Welles is a film auteur who was able to blend the existing world cinema genres, notably German Expressionism and French Poetic Realism; as well as story telling techniques from the previous mediums mastered by Welles, such as theatre and radio to create a new and unique avant guard feel that has never been recreated (Bordwell and Thompson 316-317). In his first film, Citizen Kane, we can see Welles throw himself into cinema with abandon as he unquestionably masters the medium. His follow up film, The Magnificent Ambersons shows a greater degree of harnessed talent as Welles uses all that he has learned in cinema, radio and the stage to spin his nostalgic tale of Booth Tarkington’s popular novel. In many ways The Magnificent Ambersons should have gone down in history as a film equal or greater to Citizen Kane. It is the earlier masterpiece’s natural successor. However, an unfortunate reedit by the studio left us with the shell of what Welles envisioned (Higham 126).\n\nMise-en-Scene\n\nOn the surface it would be easy to perceive the cursory similarities in the miss-en-scene Welles presents in Kane and Ambersons creates two basically identical cinematic worlds. However, a deeper viewing of the films will create a more nuanced understanding that though they are both in same time period and in the unmistakable Welles directorial style the miss-en-scene has been manipulated in both films to serve the message and create the unique atmosphere for the individual stories. Both stories address the change in American culture in the early part of the 20th Century. Kane addresses the change in media and how access to information has effected culture and the limits to how far opinions can be shaped. Ambersons focuses on the the changes wrought by America’s industrialization and the loss of the niceties of bygone days as symbolized by the downfall of the Amberson family (Higham 127).\n\nThe world created in Kane is modern and at time advent guard to the audiences of 1941. However, Ambersons has a more sombre lilt to it, and all encompassing sense of nostalgia. The difference in feels is created in the very opening shots of the films. Kane opens with the abrupt death of the main character cutting swiftly into a news reel. A completely modern and fresh means of storytelling. In contrast, Ambersons opens with a nostalgic look into the past. Narrated by Welles employeeing some radio technique into his film, he provides us with a prosaic story time that introduces us to the glory days of the Amberson family, Eugene and Isabelle’s somewhat humorous failed courtship, and the fashions and frivolities of a world gone by. The entire sequence is shot with the edges of the frame all hazy furthering the dream like sense of the world that was, until we abruptly move to the puckish adventures of the young George Minifer. Through his treatment Welles takes the same historical era, but sets two completely different backdrops against which the rest of the films take place.\n\nCinematography\n\nIt is difficulty to discuss the cinematography of these two films in this forum, if only because to truly do justice to the cinematography of either film an entire masters thesis would be needed. I have had the privilege of experiencing Kane in 35mm and I hope someday I will be able to experience Ambersons as intended as well. I would like to use what little space I have to highlight how characters are framed in these films. Especially in windows such as when we see the young Charlie Kane playing in the snow framed by the cabin window as his mother signs papers to grant him his life of privilege. We later see Kane framed in a window as a reflection as he dances with the chorus girls, while Lealand questions whether he will be changed by the new staff of the Inquirer. We see similar framing devices in Amberson as well. While George watches Eugene leave the mansion after banning him from seeing Isabelle. Eugene’s exit is viewed from the window with the reflection of George’s face superimposed to almost create the impression of George as an omnipotent being overseeing and controlling the proceedings of the poor mortal Eugene and Isabelle. Finally another uniquely framed shot is when we see George standing in front of a mirror talking with his Uncle, although technically the Uncle is “out of the shot” he is seen in the bath in a reflection in the mirror behind George juxtaposing the images to make George seem a good deal larger than his uncle as the uncle appears quite small due to the optical illusion of the reflection creating the impression that the uncle is in another spacial location than he actually is.\n\nEditing\n\nThe use of editing is possibly one of major distinctions between the two films. Kane is a little zippier featuring multiple montage sequences. Kane is choppy and modern it it’s editing technique for a good deal of the film. In many ways one can see the influence of Russian Soviet Montage in the way that editing is used to create meaning and drive story, notable as we see the Kane marriage crumble through the use of editing in the breakfast sequence. Conversely, Ambersons slowly unfurls before us. The cinematic influence is clearly that of Poetic Realism as scenes are allowed to play out in long takes. An example of this that is an excellent counterpoint to the Kane breakfast sequence is the scene where Fanny and George talk in the kitchen after he returns home from college following his fathers death. This shot is essentially a single take with the camera panning slightly to follow Fanny as she occasionally goes to get the strawberry shortcake or jug of milk for George. This shot’s lack of editing speaks to Welles bringing some of his theatrical background to the film, it is known that he rehearsed his actors prior to filming like it was a play and this sequence as beautifully as it is filmed could very easily have taken place on a stage.\n\nOn a final note toward editing I would like to note Welles’ use of jarring cuts to surprising images often accompanied with a loud noise. This could be characterized by the bird screeching in Kane as the butler begins his story of Charlie’s reaction to Susie leaving him and the cranking of the early Morgan automobile in the snow from Ambersons. I find these edits interesting because they are such a break from the rather dreamy seamless editing that is employed for the majority of the film. Here we get to see Welles experiment with a more modern, experimental style of filmmaking.\n\nLighting\n\nThe lighting in both films is a crucial piece in the puzzle, if you will, that is a vital part of creating the atmospheres of the worlds of Kane and the Ambersons. In both both films use similar lighting techniques, notably the use of outlined figures completely in the dark. This is scene with the death of Charles Foster Kane in the opening moments of Kane occurs frequently throughout Ambersons notably as George and Fanny talk on the stairs. Also significantly when a broken hearted Isabelle stands in the darkness after reading the letter from Eugene and she is completely in darkness with only light illuminating the tears in her eyes.\n\nAnother incredibly similar use of lighting in the two films is the scene in the screening room and Thatcher Library in Kane and the lighting of the train station as Uncle Joe says goodbye to George. In all three instances we find the actors in various outlined in a environment that is primarily dark with the exception of a an extremely bright and focused source of light (the projector in the screening room, the window in the library, and the skylight in the train station), this leads to some very striking images that create interest in some otherwise duller moments of the film.\n\nAlthough on the whole there is not a great deal of difference between the lighting techniques of the two films. There is an identifiable lighting look that Welles seems to prefer in his films, that is impart highlighted by his use of deep focus. The use of deep focus. This allows Welles to have the scene lit in multiple ways for a single shot, some characters and the set will be in utter darkness while others will stand in the light. However, there is a major change in lighting techniques with his second film Ambersons, on the whole it is a much darker film in appearance as well as mood. While Kane goes through periods of light and dark we are generally pledged into literal darkness in the low key lighting of the Ambersons.\n\nSet Design\n\nThe sets in both films are intricate pieces that allow the ground breaking technical aspects of the film to shine while also serving a greater narrative purpose. Namely the choice by Welles to construct sets that are authentic with ceilings to allow for freer camera movement and low camera angles. I would categorize the most significant sets in Kane to be the newspaper offices and the magnificence of Xanadu. The low ceilings in the newspaper allows for Charlie to dominate the environment and look larger than life as he directs his empire. Although it is flipped when he enters the newspaper after loosing the gubernatorial election. Shot from a jarringly low angel Charlie looks larger there ever as the low ceilings of the office are also emphasized. The result is Charlie looks like a grown man in a child’s playhouse. Through set design Welles is able to create meaning as he visually shows us that Charlie is intact only a big man in the small world of his own creation. After the election loss, the dominant set featured in Kane is that of the legendary Xanadu. Here we see a reversal. We have Charlie being dwarfed by his cavernous interiors. Suddenly Charlie is in a space that he cannot dominate, as he finds himself in a world that has moved past him. His one audience member in this palace Susie cannot even hear him and when she does she does not understand or accept his statements as the public no longer thinks what he tells them. In these two stages of Charlie’s life Welles is able to communicate significant shifts in the narrative through the set design.\n\nWith The Magnificent Ambersons it is easier to see the importance of set design in story telling as the significance of the Amberson mansion is explicitly highlighted in the opening scenes as the “greek chorus” of townspeople list the modern luxuries of the Amberson abode. Our first true introduction into this space comes with the long dolly shots as the camera travels through the ball. We first experience the mansion as a crowded place of celebration and elegance. As the film progresses the mansion becomes increasingly empty and increasingly dark. The high ceilings create an eery sense of weightlessness as it appears those staircases go on forever in the dark. It is known that before the studios reedit Welles ended the film with the camera moving through the empty Amberson mansion, echoing the earlier ball scene (Higham 128). This illustrates the way Welles was using the house to symbolize the decline of the Amberson family and by extension the old founding families across America. Once again Welles insisted on an elaborately constructed set, built as a real home so that the camera had the freedom to move throughout. This provides us with the fantastic movement of the the camera up the staircase as Fanny and George discuss the consequences of George’s ending her relationship of Isabelle and Eugene.\n\nActing Style\n\nWelles prowess as a director can be easily seen in his ability to pull amazing performances from absolutely every member of his cast. I am always struck when watching Citizen Kane by the memorable performance of the reporter. A actor’s whose face we never see, whose name I can never recall turns, in a performance that acts as a glue that holds together one of, if not the, greatest movie ever made (Pickard 30). To characterize the acting style directed under Kane I would say that it is incredibly naturalistic. There are moments of actors talking over each other and tripping over there world. This is done by Welles himself magnificent effect in Kane when Thatcher goes to lecture him at the newspaper office and Kane instructs his reporter that “you provide the prose poetry, I’ll supply the war”. Also later when Welles, calls out to his cook as he, Lealand, and Bernstein discuss making over the front page.\n\nHowever, it would be impossible to do any discussion of these two films without mentioning the performance of Agnes Moorehead. Her heartbreaking performance of as Mrs. Kane leaves an indelible memory of her that allows you to understand the fondness in Kane’s voice when he speaks of going to see her things to Susie, wishes to make Susie’s mother’s ambitions for her daughter come true, and holds on the Rosebud and the memory of his childhood with his mother. Moorehead delivers a quiet and nuanced performance as Mrs. Kane that allows her motives to be open to the audience’s interpretation. The portrayal of Fanny is truly a thing to be reckoned with swinging from a silly old maid to an object of great sadness. Moorehead is able to alter her appearance by her facial expressions at some points managing to look sweet and lovely and others horribly beaten down and aged. Her breakdown with her back against the now cold water heater is one of the most authentic portrayals ever recorded on film (Higham 129).\n\nIn conclusion, the surface of these films and the filmmaking technique of Orson Welles has not even been scratched here. However, I hope that I have been able to illustrate the variety of techniques that Welles employed to create his on unique style of filmmaking.\n\nBibliography\n\nBordwell, David, and Kristin Thompson.
