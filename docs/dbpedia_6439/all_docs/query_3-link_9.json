Two of his closest associates in the golden years of the Mercury Theatre, William Alland and the late Richard Wilson, freely shared their recollections with me. Robert Wise extended the courtesy of several interviews to me and never failed to respond to additional inquiries. Other former RKO employees associated with The Magnificent Ambersons provided valuable firsthand information: Amalia Kent, John Mansbridge, James G. Stewart, Linwood Dunn, the late Howard Schwartz, and the late Maurice Seiderman. Vernon Harbin, Archivist Emeritus of RKO, instructed me in innumerable ways, especially on legal issues and on matters of studio history and politics. John Hall, RKO West Coast Manager, was a tireless champion of the book, especially where it mattered most, with the New York corporate hierarchy. These two steadfast custodians of the studio's legacy have both since passed away, and I feel their loss deeply. It is always a pleasure to express appreciation to dedicated professionals such as the following: Saundra Taylor and Rebecca Campbell Cape, Lilly Library, Bloomington, Indiana; Lois Bader-Stein, Kenosha Historical Society; Brigitte Kueppers, Theater Arts Library, UCLA; Ned Comstock, Archives of Performing Arts, University of Southern Calfornia; and Emmet Chisum, Western Heritage Center, Laramie, Wyoming. I owe a special debt to: Bette LeVine, former business manager of RKO Pictures, for the original approval of this project; the Booth Tarkington Literary Properties, for clearance on the underlying story rights; Alan Rose, who spent countless hours attempting to instruct a novice like me in the mechanics of book production and the vagaries of the world of book publishing; Bill Simon, who presented me with the opportunity to read an early draft of the \"Oedipus in Indianapolis\" essay at the International Orson Welles Conference at New York University in May, 1988; and the Graduate Research Board, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, for supplementary financial assistance. Chick Callenbach, my editor at the University of California Press, treated my less inspiring ideas with gentle forbearance and always tried to help me find a better way. James Naremore and A1 LaValley, specialist readers for the Press, wrote conscientious,\n\nimmaculately reasoned, and eminently fair reports; they will discover that I did not take their counsel lightly. Michelle Nordon was an exemplary production editor. Sharon Decker heroically typed the manuscript. I am also grateful to my research assistants, Kim Worthy, George Scheetz, and Mark Cummings, to fellow Welleseans Richard France and Charles Higham, and to Ruth Warrick, Christopher Husted, Kathryn Kalinak, and Grace Blum. This project was underwritten by a grant from the Research Programs Division of the National Endowment for the Humanities.\n\nX\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nT H E FATE of The Magnificent Ambersons is one of film history's great tragedies. From the studio's standpoint, it was a risky proposition from the beginning—a downbeat regional period drama, expensive to produce, and with no star attraction. Indeed, it had been necessary for Welles to grant additional dispensations on his obligations to the studio to get RKO President George Schaefer's permission to proceed in the first place. Shooting on the film began on October 28, 1941, at the RKO-Pathe studios in Culver City, RKO's second lot across town from its main operation on Gower Street in Hollywood. Exactly one month later, Welles arranged a special screening for Schaefer of the work in progress. Three especially powerful sequences had been completed by this time—the Ambersons ball, the dinner for Eugene Morgan, and George and Aunt Fanny on the stairs afterwards. The preview left Schaefer considerably relieved. Although the film continued to represent what in the trade is called a \"hard sell,\" with careful handling it might show a respectable return. Schaefer, a veteran distributor, took charge of the marketing strategy himself. To maximize box-office potential, The Magnificent Ambersons would have a major opening at RKO's flagship theater, Radio City Music Hall, during Easter week (one of the best times of the year for the picture business) followed by a quick saturation playoff in RKO theaters around the country. Shooting was completed on The Magnificent Ambersons on January 22, 1942, in sufficient time to make possible the implementation of Schaefer's plan. Almost immediately after, Welles departed for South America (at the urging of the State Department and with Schaefer's blessing) to make a film on local customs and themes, leaving postproduction on The Magnificent Ambersons in the hands of the film's editor, Robert Wise. A completed version of the film, edited according to Welles's precise instructions, was put into preview at Pomona, a small town on the edge of the desert forty-five minutes east of Hollywood, on March 17, 1942. Schaefer attended, expecting to see the promise of October fulfilled. To the contrary, the Pomona preview was an unmitigated disaster. Schaefer wrote to Welles in South America that it was the most painful experience in his twenty-eight years in the industry. \"I have never been present in a theater where the audience acted in such a manner. They laughed at the wrong places, talked at the picture, kidded it, and did everything that you can possibly imagine.\"\n\nA second preview at Pasadena on March 19 went better (a less rowdy audience, and only about a fourth of the preview cards negative vs. three-fourths at Pomona), but this was small comfort to Schaefer. Pasadena, with its rarefied, upscale audience, was the exception. If the picture would not play in Pomona, it could not even come near to recouping its extravagant $ 1,000,000 cost. Reluctantly, Schaefer ordered the studio, independently of Welles, to take whatever action was necessary to make the film more palatable to a mass audience. (The additional time entailed now made an Easter release out of the question.) T h e task was entrusted to Wise, who removed almost fifty minutes of Welles's footage and arranged for several scenes to be rewritten and reshot. Wise's original cut had run 131 minutes, 45 seconds. The recut version ran 88 minutes, 10 seconds. In the meantime, Schaefer was deposed as head of the studio in favor of a new regime that was openly hostile to Welles. The short version received a perfunctory release, and the picture was retired to the vaults showing a loss of $625,000 (roughly 7 5 % of the total cost of Citizen Kane). As a protection against possible legal complications, the negative trims and outtakes were held for a time in the vaults, but were eventually burned because of a shortage of storage space. (The leftover material from Hitchcock's Suspicion was destroyed at the same time, making it unlikely that this was a selective act of vindictiveness toward Welles.) The duplicate print sent to Welles in South America was deemed useless and was also destroyed. As a consequence, not even a frame of the extracted footage is known to survive. T h e only complete record of the 131-minute version of the film which does survive is a cutting continuity (a script transcribed from what appears on the screen) of March 12, 1942. The cutting continuity is the basis for the reconstruction undertaken in this volume. It is supplemented with various materials pertaining to the missing footage, including storyboards (cartoon-like drawings which are preliminary visualizations of a shot), detailed sketches, blueprints of the sets, still photographs representing the film's action, the script supervisor's editing notes made during the shooting, cues for the musical score, information in studio documents, and recollections of several of the original participants in the shooting. A graphic and annotational network correlates the shots and scenes which are lost to the portion of the film which survives. A cutting continuity is a technical document containing shot and footage counts, dialogue, and extremely scant descriptions of the action. T h e first necessity in preparing the reconstruction was to convert a purely functional document of this sort into a readerly one. This involved such matters as rearranging the format, correcting errors, making the text internally consistent, and rewriting for clarity and, sometimes, for accuracy. This process has been carried out in accord with, I would hope, editorially responsible principles. These are explained in \"A Note on Textual Practice.\" T h e survival of crucial records related to the production has made possible a lengthy addendum, \"Editing Ambersons: A Documentary History.\" There are also a chronology of the story events, an extensive cast list (including players in deleted scenes), and a critical introduction, \"Oedipus in Indianapolis.\"\n\n2\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe critical introduction is likely to be controversial. The Magnificent Ambersons has traditionally been considered a prime instance of the Hollywood system's total disdain for mature artistry and its unrelenting commitment to its destruction. To the contrary, I argue that Welles himself must bear the ultimate responsibility for the film's undoing. While it is undeniable that Schaefer's decision to recut The Magnificent Ambersons was primarily a business judgment, I believe it was a string of questionable judgments and rash actions on Welles's part that predisposed this outcome. If events had turned out differently, it might well be that The Magnificent Ambersons, rather than Citizen Kane, would be regarded as \"the greatest film of all time.\" Even in the film's truncated form, it is clear that one of Welles's primary motives was to outdo the achievement of his first film. This book has two goals: to account for the failure of the film's execution, and to bring the reader into as close touch as possible, from such materials as survive, with a masterwork that might have been.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\nOEDIPUS IN INDIANAPOLIS\n\nAfter a thunderous beginning like Citizen Kane, Welles's choice of a serene and elegiac story like The Magnificent Ambersons for his second film may appear something of a puzzle. In fact, The Magnificent Ambersons came about almost as an afterthought. Welles had originally intended to follow up Citizen Kane with The Way to Santiago, an espionage thriller set in Mexico which would co-star his current inamorata, Dolores Del Rio. The script was almost completed and production plans were well under way when the Mexican government announced its objection to the project. With most foreign markets already shut off because of the war, RKO was unwilling to risk jeopardizing any of the few territories remaining and withheld its assent. Once again, Welles was in the same situation he had been faced with at the inception of Citizen Kane— several months of preproduction activity without even a story idea in hand. To help things along, RKO studio President George Schaefer ordered a search of the files for available properties that might be suitable for Welles, and this produced a list of more than three dozen items ranging from Hemingway's To Have and Have Not to a life of Beethoven. Welles dutifully reviewed each item with an RKO story editor but could find nothing that ignited a spark. When the situation was at its bleakest, Welles suddenly hit on the idea for the Tarkington novel, which the Mercury Theatre had done as a radio show. From Welles's point of view, it seemed an eminently sensible choice. Virtually forgotten in the postwar era, Tarkington once had a wider following than probably any other writer in American history and could provide the commercial drawing power the studio was demanding from Welles. The radio production was considered one of the Mercury's best, and the experience gained from it would help to speed the progress of the film and make up for lost time. There were also deeper currents of attraction: although Welles probably did not fully sense it at this early stage, one of the central preoccupations of the Ambersons story is the same as that in Citizen Kane. The Magnificent Ambersons, however, is not the kind of property one associates with RKO. Recognizing that he faced a difficult selling job, Welles took a phonograph and a re-\n\nThe gestation of a legend: a 1925 precocious schoolboy item from a local paper, reprinted in the 1940 Saturday Evening Post \"How to Raise a Child\" series.\n\nCartoonist, Actor, Poet and only 10\n\nOrson G.

In later years, Welles took a certain mischievous glee in relating that during his presentation, one of the finest performances of his career, he quipped, Schaefer fell asleep. In any case, he came away with the necessary permission to proceed. 1 It was André Bazin who first put the matter in clear perspective. Citizen Kane and The Magnificent Ambersons are so profoundly interrelated as to constitute a distinct phase in Welles's film output. Indeed, Bazin suggests, it may justifiably be considered the major phase. The two films are centrally related by such general traits as the long take, deep focus style, and a somewhat Balzacian view of American life, but there is a more elemental link. In Kane's attachment to Rosebud and in George Minafer's extreme solicitousness toward his mother, we see manifestations of the same \"egotistic fixation\"—\"the obsession with, or, if one prefers, nostalgia for childhood.\" The impetus, Bazin felt, was Welles's own childhood. Not, however, because it was troubled—quite the opposite, \"it was a happy childhood par excellence\"—but because it was too brief. \"Too many good fairies hovered over his cradle, not leaving the child time enough to live his childhood.\" 1 \"A happy childhood par excellence\"—that is exactly the conclusion Welles would have expected Bazin to draw. Matters had been carefully contrived so that he would. Welles had been feeding glorified accounts of his childhood to the press for so long that they had come to be accepted as fact. It was a conspicuous feature of what critic Kenneth Tynan called his \"lifelong task . . . of inventing himself.\" 2 It involved embellishment, outright fabrication, and selective concealment. It may be seen at its most characteristic in the portrait of the boy genius astonishing and confounding the adult world that is presented in the Saturday Evening Post feature series, \"How to Raise a Child\" (1940), 3 which was to be a fountainhead of Welles biography for decades. Attempts to get behind the mask were invariably brushed aside, though with the insouciance and utterly disarming politeness of which Welles was master. To Tynan, who had remarked on the anomaly that Welles heroes usually have no fathers: I had a father whom I remember as enormously likable and attractive. He was a gambler, and a playboy who may have been getting a bit old for it when I knew him, but he was a marvelous fellow, and it was a great sorrow to me when he died. No, a story interests me on its own merits, not because it's autobiographical.4 T o British reviewer Dilys Powell: Is Citizen Kane autobiographical? Not for a minute. I can't think why that legend persists. Kane was born poor. I was born rich and became poor about the time in life Mr. Kane came into a fortune. His childhood was lonely and starved for love. Mine was the opposite. I had no \"Rosebuds.\"5\n\n1 André Bazin, Orson Welles, translated by Jonathan Rosenbaum (New York: Harper and Row, 1978), pp.\n\n65-66.\n\n2\n\nKenneth Tynan, \"Portrait: Orson Welles,\" in Show (November 1961), p. 60.

When Welles was a baby, a second male adult entered the family circle. Welles's mother encouraged the outsider's attentions and before long he had effectively supplanted Welles's real father as head of the household. His father went into a professional and personal decline that was undoubtedly precipitated by the presence of the male rival, and he never recovered. When Welles was six, his parents separated and thereafter he was shuttled back and forth between them. When with his father, he had ample opportunity to observe firsthand the elder Welles's boozing and philandering. He was living with his mother when she contracted a debilitating illness and she died in agony when he was nine. When he was thirteen, his father had his older brother committed to a mental institution. When he was fifteen, his father died of alcoholism. As a young man, Richard Head Welles (1872-1930) was a small-town entrepreneur with spectacular promise. He liked to tinker with mechanical things and apparently had genuine talent. One of his early inventions, a solar bicycle headlamp that generated its own gas, earned him a modest fortune. He married Beatrice Ives (1882—1924), an exquisite beauty from a once-prosperous Springfield, Illinois, mercantile family that had fallen on hard times. She had well-developed artistic tastes, some musical talent, and a mind of her own. Dr. Maurice Bernstein, a Kenosha physician of some repute, came into their lives when he was summoned to care for Beatrice Welles's mother, who was dying of cancer. On his visits to the house, he began to take special notice of the baby, Orson, whom he recognized as a prodigy. Bernstein was well connected in Chicago's cultural community and represented an opportunity for Beatrice Welles to further her musical ambitions. In 1919, Richard Welles, then in his forties, disposed of his business interests and spent the rest of his life indulging his weaknesses. Around the same time, Beatrice Welles arranged for the family to relocate to Chicago, where she was soon presiding over a salon that catered to the musically and otherwise artistically gifted. Inevitably, permanent separation came. If Kenneth Tynan's characterization of the relationship was tasteless, it was nonetheless correct: \"where mother had her sabn, father favored the saloon.\"7 The family spent the summers at the resort town of Grand Detour, an hour's drive west of Chicago, but Beatrice lived in a rented house while Richard stayed at the town's famous old hotel. On May 10, 1924, at forty-two, Beatrice Welles died of hepatitis, for which there was then no effective cure. According to her wishes, Welles was placed under the joint guardianship of his father and Bernstein, but it was the latter who assumed chief responsibility, and with whom he lived, because of Richard Welles's instability. After Beatrice's death, Richard Welles moved to Grand Detour and bought its famous hotel, which he managed and ran for a time until it was burned to the ground through an employee's carelessness. His drinking grew worse, and Bernstein enjoined his young charge, now away at boarding school, from associating with his father in this condition. Richard Welles died alone of acute alcoholism in a Chicago hotel room on December\n\n6\n\nThe following account of Welles's parentage and childhood is taken principally from Barbara Learning, Orson Welles: A Biography (New York: Viking, 1985); Charles Higham, Orson Welles: The Rise and Fall of an American Genius (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1985); conversations with Lois Bader-Stein, archivist of the Kenosha Historical Society, and documents compiled by her, unpublished letters of Todd School headmaster Roger Hill; and original materials in the Charles Higham Welles Research Collection, Archives of Performing Arts, University of Southern California (hereafter HRC). HRC is of special interest for its public and legal documents pertaining to the Welles family, clippings from Kenosha, Milwaukee, and Chicago newpaperc, and a family scrapbook kept by Welles's governess Sigrid Jacobsen. 7\n\n8\n\nTynan, Show, October 1961, p. 68. Reprinted in Profiles, p. 155.\n\nO E D I P U S IN INDIANAPOLIS\n\n27, 1930. As Welles remarked in reaction to Rita Hayworth's characterization of her life with him, \"If this was happiness, I wonder what the rest of [it] had been.\" 8 It is understandable why anyone might want to keep family skeletons of this sort securely locked in the closet. Nor would there be anything out of the ordinary in altering an occasional fact to protect the concealment. What makes Welles's case unusual is the matter of degree. H e went to extraordinary lengths to control the story of his childhood. This trait persisted to the end of his life. Joseph Cotten, his friend of fifty years, identified, probably unwittingly, one of his principal strategies. \"I know little about Orson's childhood,\" Cotten wrote in his autobiography, \"and seriously doubt that he was ever a child.\" 9 If it had been left up to Welles himself, he never would have been. His accounts of childhood events almost never involve peers and usually present him in the company of adults who accept him as one of their own. In a familiar variant, he proves himself their superior. The \"How to Raise a Child\" series, subtitled \"The Education of Orson Welles, Who Didn't Need It,\" is a compendium of such anecdotes repeated without any discernible trace of skepticism: Welles escaped kindergarten by feigning appendicitis; resisted being sent to ordinary school because it would interfere with his works in progress, a universal history of the drama and a critical analysis of Thus Spake Zarathustra; was singled out as a special subject of study by an eminent psychologist but faked his answers because of his disdain for what he regarded as a pseudoscience; and, at twelve, wrote a series of papers refuting the work of one of the world's leading Egyptologists. \"His main ambition was to escape from childhood,\" the authors editorialized. \"From the first, Orson was a fullfledged member of [his mother's] circle . . . of artists and intellectuals.\" One such anecdote is especially enlightening. Th ePost authors report that when Dr. Bernstein first encountered Welles on a professional call to the family home, the \"infant Confucius\" was \"uttering wisdom in polished sentences.\" 10 Bernstein himself gave a very different account: \"Orson at that time didn't talk, as since reported, like a college professor. He talked like a 2 year old, somewhat precocious.\"\" Welles preferred the more flattering story and constantly repeated it. Late in his life, he would even recount it in precise detail: One day, at eighteen months, he was alone in his nursery when Bernstein happened to look in on him. From his crib, he addressed an observation to the startled doctor: \"The desire to take medicine is one of the greatest features which distinguishes men from animals.\" Bernstein rushed to announce the news to the family.12 While it may seem a typical Welles whopper, its symbolic implications are profound. It is a fable of personal origin, an account of the birth of the version ofWelles he wished himself to be. Its psychological dynamic is that the prelapsarian child is enabled to advance directly to adulthood, bypassing the painful developmental phases in between. In this respect, it is significant that only the baby and his \"Dadda\" (Welles's childhood name for Bernstein), and none of the disruptive forces from Welles's real childhood, are present in the fable.\n\n8\n\nBarbara Learning, If This Was Happiness: A Biography of Rita Hayworth (New York; Viking, 1989), prefatory inscription.\n\n9\n\nJoseph Cotten, Vanity Will Get You Somewhere (San Francisco: Mercury House, 1987), p. 30.\n\n10\n\nAll the preceding examples are from the first installment of The Saturday Evening Post scries, January 2 0 , 1 9 4 0 .\n\nKirk Bates, \"When Welles Loses Sleep He Makes It Up, and How!\" Milwaukee Journal, February 7, 1940, p. 1.

In the center are an elderly neighbor couple, smiling. Next, to the left, is Sigrid, the boy's governess, turned sideways to cast a solicitous glance at her charge. At the far left, behind and apart from the others, is Richard Welles, 50, taut a n d unsmiling.\n\nOne such force would be Beatrice Welles. In her artistic cultivation, singlemindedness, and disdain for conventional values, she was so positive a model for her son that one might expect he would have reveled in being so fortunate. 13 Yet he remained impassively silent in regard to her for much of his life. Actor William Alland, production assistant, chief aide, and personal fixer for Welles from his early days in theater through Citizen Kane and, some say, closest of all to him in these years, told me that in all that time he cannot recall a single instance when Welles even mentioned his mother. 14 The occasional obligatory commentary to the press had all the feeling of an encyclopedia entry: \"My mother was a famous beauty, active in politics, a champion rifle shot and a gifted concert pianist.\"' 5 Not until late in life did he begin speaking more freely. A propos his own status in her Chicago salon, he told an interviewer, \"children could be treated as adults as long as they were amusing. The moment you became boring, it was off to the nursery.\"16 In 1982 he published the first (and only) installment of his memoirs. It was in two parts, one devoted to Richard Welles (\"My Father Wore Black Spats\") and one to Beatrice (\"A Brief Career as a Musical Prodigy\"). The latter is without question the most moving piece he ever wrote. On his ninth birthday, he was called to his mother's deathbed. The room was dark except for the faint glow from the tiny candles on the cake which flickered in her strong green eyes. She fixed him in a piercing look (\"these could be quite terrible—I'd seen my father wither under them into a crisp, brown, winter's leaf'), addressed him as \"Georgie-Porgie\"—the dread nickname his playmates taunted him with, and recited lines from A Midsummer Night's Dream, the primer she had used to teach him to read. Then she turned to the purpose of the visit: That stupid birthday cake . . . is just another stupid cake; and you'll have all the cakes you want. But the candles are a fairy ring. And you will never again in your whole life have just that number to blow out. She was a sorceress. \"You must puff hard,\" she said, \"and you must blow out every one of them. And you must make a wish.\"\n\nWelles continued: I puffed very hard. And suddenly the room was dark and my mother had vanished forever. Sometimes, in the dead watches of the night, it strikes me that of all my mistakes, the greatest was on that birthday just before my mother died, when I forgot to make a wish.17\n\nWelles undoubtedly intended it as a pristine image; he was probably unaware that his portrait of Beatrice Welles strikes some readers as truly frightening. It would be difficult to imagine a less exemplary role model than Richard Welles. But once again, expectations are reversed: his father served a role in his everyday adult life one might think his mother would occupy. Rather than suppressing information about his father, Welles delighted in proliferating it. He was especially fond of stories 13 As, for instance, Preston Sturges does in his posthumously published memoir, Preston Sturges, adapted and edited by Sandy Scurges (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1990). 14\n\nInterview with William Alland, October 28, 1987.\n\n15\n\nPowell, \"The Life and Opinions of Orson Welles,\" p. 21.\n\n16\n\nLearning, Orson Wellts, p. 13.\n\n17\n\nOrson Welles, \"A Brief Career as a Musical Prodigy,\" Vogue (Paris) December 1982, pp. 186-187.\n\nO E D I P U S IN INDIANAPOLIS\n\n11\n\ninvolving them as companions—knowing fellows in the ways of the world, international travelers, and so on. This is undoubtedly related to his wish to be thought an adult, but there are other equally important considerations. Just weeks before Welles's death in 1985, two extensive and ambitious biographies appeared. Welles granted Barbara Learning virtually unlimited interview privileges for her Orson Welles: A Biography. She reciprocated by allowing practically everything he said to pass unchallenged, including obvious fabrications and more than a small amount of the most patent nonsense. Nevertheless, her work is indispensable as the fullest account on record of Welles's reminiscences and views. Charles Higham's Orson Welles: The Rise and Fall of an American Genius had an unusual provenance. In an earlier book, The Films of Orson Welles, Higham had aroused Welles's fury with his \"fear of completion\" theory, actually more a charge, that Welles was chronically selfdestructive and that \"all his blame of others for wrecking his work is an unconscious alibi\" for his own recklessness and irresponsibility.18 Welles retaliated by writing Higham into his uncompleted autobiographical film The Other Side of the Wind as a prissy critic whose name is emphatically mispronounced. In the new book, Higham displayed his own chronic inability to resist a salacious tidbit or to slant matters in the most insidious way possible, but his account of Welles's ancestry and childhood is exhaustively and masterfully researched, and this alone makes it one of the great contributions to Welles lore. For all their fundamental differences, the two books open with the same phenomenon: Welles making up stories about his father. Welles says to Learning that his father died at a \" 'great age.'\" She interjects that, to the contrary, he was only fifty-eight. \"No sooner do I blurt [that] out,\" Learning continues, \"than I realize that I certainly ought to have refrained from correcting Orson on so delicate a subject. Orson is perplexed. He has always thought of his father as being very old when he died\" (p. 2). Higham begins with a quotation from the Paris Vogue memoir. Welles wrote that his father \"lived to be a great age before setting himself on fire.\" Higham establishes that \"there is not a word of truth in it\"; not only did his father die at a relatively early age, but \"the fire to which Welles refers was in fact caused by the servants in his father's hotel, who were testing a new flue by wafting the flames up it with newspapers.\" Welles describes the hotel as small; in fact, Higham asserts, it was very large. Welles says that the fire took place after \"we'd just returned from China, and there was a nice Christmasy fall of snow on the ground the night of the fire.... The few old cronies my father had invited were yet to arrive, and most of the hotel staff had been given the night off to go to Dixon, six miles away, for the movie show.\" In fact, Higham establishes, the fire took place in the late spring of 1928, \"almost exactly two years before Welles went to China and Japan with his father, and it was already unseasonably hot in that part of Illinois.\" The Grand Detour hotel was impressive but hardly \"America's most exclusive,\" as Welles characterized it. Also, his father did not own other residences in Jamaica and Peking, as Welles claimed (p. 2). Welles continues in the same vein—around the time\n\n18\n\n12\n\nCharles Higham, The Films of Orson Welles (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1970), p. 190.\n\nOEDIPUS IN INDIANAPOLIS\n\nof Kitty Hawk, his father invented an airplane of his own that flew while its engine remained on the ground, and so on—until he reaches what must be his all-time whopper: His father's mother was a practicing witch who performed sacrificial rites on a bloodstained altar in an upper story of her house and managed to insert diabolical lore into the text of the minister's funeral sermon for her son.19 Welles loved making up stories about his father and his father's relatives. There were the often-repeated tales of his father's nine great-aunts and their outlandish doings: one wore an enormous red wig on the streets of Kenosha and waved it at acquaintances, another exercised by tying herself to the back of her limousine and running along behind it, another fell out of a rickshaw in China and disappeared from the face of the earth, another was courted by a famous magician, another refused to be rescued from the Johnstown flood because of a party in progress, and another regularly bathed in ginger ale. Actually, there were only five aunts, one slightly eccentric, but all the rest is apparently untrue. 20 Perhaps the single image Welles most enthusiastically promoted was that of his father as world traveler accompanied by his young son to all sorts of exotic locales. Even though this characterization is taken almost universally at face value, there are grounds for serious doubt. Richard Welles's former Kenosha friends insisted that \"he went abroad once\" in his whole life and that his son's stories were pure fabrication.21 After hearing Welles hold forth on the subject on a television talk show, Roger Hill once wrote in exasperation to another former Todd pupil that Welles had taken one single foreign trip with his father, to China, after his fourth year at Todd School.22 Undoubtedly the Kenoshans understated the facts (it is unlikely they would have been in constant touch after Richard Welles left Kenosha) but it is also clear that Welles's account goes wildly to the opposite extreme. Is it possible that travel was a cover story used by the family for prolonged binges and periods of drying out in a hospital or sanitarium?23 He also promoted his father's reputation as a wastrel and philanderer. He told the Post authors how he used to sit up all night with his father absorbing his wisdom over a bottle of Holland gin.24 He once told a youthful audience that he never used drugs himself, but his father had regularly smoked opium—\"about once a month.\" 25 He often repeated the story, with a certain amount of ribald satisfaction it is said, that when he was still in short pants, his father used to take him along with him to brothels and \"park him with the babes\" while he conducted his business upstairs.26 Welles's tales of his father present him as a colorful, sometimes ribald Dickensian eccentric, a comic anachronism who continued to wear black spats even after light colors had come into fashion when automobiles eliminated horse droppings from the streets. But the comedic feature also clearly serves to screen out latent anxieties, as with the child in the brothel story. Or with this one: I once asked Welles how he first developed an interest in films. From his father, he replied, who saw everything that came\n\n19\n\nFor the record, Higham also discredits the grandmother story in every respect.\n\n20\n\nSee: \"How to Raise a Child,\" October 20, 1940, p. 96; and Bates, \"Kenosha Is Indignant,\" p. 3.\n\n21\n\nBates, \"Kenosha Is Indignant,\" p. 2.\n\n22\n\nRoger Hill to Dwight Whitney, undated [c.

Warrick told me she too was struck by the extraordinary resemblance between them the first time she saw a picture of Beatrice Welles. Warrick added that her personal relationship with Welles was motherly. She petted and consoled him, she said, when he went to pieces after the studio had a truckload of withered, rotting flowers delivered to the set with the message that they had been fresh when the picture was supposed to have started shooting. Warrick was the actress first considered for the role of Isabel Amberson.\n\nout, at least until the advent of sound. When the first talking image appeared on the screen, Welles continued, his father rose at once, railed in abomination, pulled the startled child from his seat, stalked out with him in tow, and never entered a movie theater again in his life.27 It is, of course, an often-told tale, to which Welles added his own special twist, the father-son companionship motif. In his telling, an ordinarily benign comic anecdote provides cover for a primal fable of discord—the eruption of an unbridgeable gulf between father and son, instigated by the father, over the thing the son values most. Although it too is apparently harmless, Welles's insistence on his father's superannuation may indicate a wish for his death. In fact, he raised this possibility himself in the \"Black Spats\" memoir, but in a teasing manner, remarking almost casually that he was convinced he had killed his father, promising to \"try to write about this later,\" and never coming back to it. In his baroque fantasy Mister Arkadin (1955), Welles's protagonist contrives to obliterate all traces of his past in order to guard the dark secret of his origins. Remove the sinister overtones, and Arkadin's story is not unlike Welles's own. Undoubtedly he was a prodigy, but his wildly exaggerated accounts of his accomplishments may be as significant for what they suppress as for what they reveal. Of his mother he said too little. Did the thought of her trigger associations too painful to contemplate? Of his father he said too much. Could the extreme ambivalence apparent in many of Welles's characterizations of him be symptomatic of a more deep-rooted conflict? Bazin attributed these idiosyncrasies to \"egotistic fixation.\" In view of the foregoing account, \"Oedipal\" seems the more appropriate modifier, so long as this term is understood in the most general sense, as the entire bewildering complex of ambivalent and conflicting feelings toward the parents (including the sexual) with which an offspring struggles to come to terms throughout life.28\n\n2 Citizen Kane has only one substantial scene of childhood, of course, but it is the center from which all else in the film radiates. Charles Foster Kane, age eight, is seen playing in the snow outside his mother's boarding house. A miraculous turn of events has occurred: a seemingly worthless piece of mining stock has become immensely valuable, and Kane's mother has determined to secure her son's prospects by making an arrangement which will place him and the assets in trust to one of the country's leading financial figures. (His father is allowed no say in the matter.) It will turn out to be the most significant event in Kane's life; although it guarantees his future financial success, he will (somewhat unaccountably) be separated from his mother for good. The trauma of his aborted childhood will leave a permanent emotional scar; it is symbolized by an object named at the beginning of the film but not identified until the end. As we know, Welles also lost his mother at a tender age. (Nine. Intriguingly, he usually spoke of it—as in his deathbed memoir—as having occurred at Kane's age,\n\n27\n\nWelles, interview with the author, August 9, 1979.\n\n28\n\nIn this essay I trace a generalized pattern of compulsive behavior originating in Welles's childhood which proved unsettling and destructive to his later creative efforts. While I make use of certain basic Freudian concepts, I have not cast this phenomenon in terms of Freudian theories of psychosexual development. My approach is derived from the transactional model of psychological development, which avoids specific, all-encompassing explanations originating in childhood and holds that behavior is modifiable across the life span. For a brief discussion, see: William McKinley Runyan, Life Histories and Psychobiography: Explorations in Theory and Method (New York: Oxford University Press, 1982), pp. 209-214. For a survey of work in developmental theory, see: David G. Perry and Kay Busey, Social Development (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1984).\n\nO E D I P U S IN INDIANAPOLIS\n\n15\n\neight.) There are numerous other parallels that give the scene an autobiographical dimension. Beatrice Welles was also headstrong and very much in charge of the family. (Kane Sr., an ineffectual dotterer, is modeled on Richard Welles.29) She insisted that her young son be raised her way and even dictated the terms of his guardianship after her death. (In both circumstances, like Mary Kane, she took special pains to see that the boy was kept at a distance from his father's influence.) Re-reading Welles's deathbed remembrance with the film's childhood separation sequence in mind will make abundantly clear how nearly Mary Kane resembles Beatrice Welles—in the icy stares by means of which she withers the elder Kane, for instance, but especially in her alternation between steely remoteness and loving solicitude in her relationship with her son. Mary Kane signs the boy over to a bank, without apparent remorse; minutes later she speaks to him lovingly and tenderly enfolds him in her arms. The most common interpretation of Rosebud—as the loss of a mother's love in the traditional sense (warm, total, unconditional)—simply does not square with the portrait of Mary Kane. Kane's immediate reaction to the news of the change in his status divulges his foremost concern. \"You goin' Mom?\" Whatever else it may represent, Rosebud stands first and foremost for a deep-seated fear of maternal rejection. Was this fear what had been behind Welles's silence during all those years? If so, there can be no surprise that it would come to the fore so insistently in his first major original work. (Before Citizen Kane, Welles had been an adapter and producer of the work of others.) But unusual care had to be exercised—journalists and critics were a relentless lot, and there was no stigma that could be attached to a serious artist more devastating than \"mother fixation.\" Not even a hint of an autobiographical implication could be allowed. It was in furtherance of this end that Welles discovered a special role for screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz, with whom he had grudgingly consented to share the writing credit on the film. He would use Mankiewicz as a cover and reserve the high road for himself. With uncharacteristic magnanimity Welles would proclaim, \"Everything concerning Rosebud belongs to him,\" while maintaining that he himself originally had something more lofty in mind (\"a line from a Romantic poem perhaps\") but had allowed himself to be dissuaded. Welles also disclosed crucial information about his feelings toward Richard Welles in the film, but for this he needed no special diversionary tactic because it was already in foolproof disguise. During the course of shooting, Welles was disturbed that some vital element was lacking in the story. In a move that was rash even for him, he feigned an illness, closed down production, and went into seclusion for three days. He emerged with a new scene he had written entirely by himself—the one in which Kane formally relinquishes control over his newspaper empire to his lifelong nemesis. The resultant symmetry is unerring—Kane's ascendancy and decline are both marked by formal ceremonies involving Thatcher and the signing of documents. But this was a byproduct; Welles's unease had been driven by something much stronger than concern for story structure. The following exchange early in the scene provides a vital clue:\n\n29\n\nIn the early drafts of the script he appeared again in Kane's later life, \"a dandy as ever was,\" in the company of \"a very obvious and very young tart\" whom he has just married—allusions to Richard Welles's sartorial affectations and inclination toward certain types of women. First rough draft 4 / 1 6 / 4 0 and first draft continuity 5/9/40. See: Robert L. Carringer, \"The Scripts of Citizen Kane,\" Critical Inquiry 5, no. 2 (Winter 1978), pp. 3 6 9 - 4 0 0 .\n\n16\n\nOEDIPUS IN INDIANAPOLIS\n\nTHATCHER\n\nYou're too old to call me Mr. Thatcher, Charles. KANE\n\nYou're too old to be called anything else. You were always too old.\n\nKane's first line is comic understatement: it is now fifty-eight years since Colorado and Thatcher has to be at least a hundred years old. But the followup line is puzzling: the antagonisms between these two have always involved matters of principle; age has never been at issue. T h e charge of perpetual superannuation only makes sense when it is understood as being directed at someone other than Thatcher: the person Welles always incorrectly remembered as being very old. Richard Welles had recently been very much on Welles's mind. O n May 15, 1940, just two weeks before the film went into the major phase of preproduction, Welles had come into his inheritance from his father. T h e event had been delayed for ten years by the terms of Richard Welles's will, and at this crucial time in the film's gestation, Welles would have been forced to confront the whole painful experience of his father's life all over again. T h e result of this psychological upheaval is crystallized in Welles's special scene. Since there had been no advance preparation, a standing set had to be used. Welles chose a courtroom and the scene as played suggests the reading of a will. Kane's retorts to Thatcher should be understood as in the \"always too old\" exchange— as asides to an absent antagonist. THATCHER\n\nThere's always the chance that you'll die richer than I will. KANE\n\nIt's a cinch I'll die richer than I was born.\n\n\"A very rich banker\"—that, Welles confided late in his life, is what his father would have liked to have been. He \"was born with more money than he had when he died,\" Welles went on, \"and to him, I believe, that was a great shame''30 Based on this information, Kane's line takes on a new dimension—it is Welles reproaching his father for his lifetime's failure and vowing to succeed where he had failed. The way it is put is unusually nasty, but not so much so as the maledizione with which the scene ends: THATCHER\n\nWhat would you like to have been? KANE\n\nEverything you hate.\n\n30\n\nLearning, pp. 5-6.\n\nOEDIPUS IN INDIANAPOLIS\n\n17\n\nTransposed into the operative context, Kane's line becomes Welles saying to his father, \"I hate everything you ever were.\" Welles's Dickensian caricatures masked an overpowering animosity toward his father for the dismal mess he had made of his life. What appears to have galled him most was Richard Welles's betrayal of his remarkable talent. Welles would redeem the legacy: not only would he succeed, but he would succeed phenomenally at whatever he put his hand to. In the decade after his father's death, Welles had a string of accomplishments that were truly extraordinary. After graduating from Todd School in the spring of 1931, he embarked on a walking tour of Ireland and, upon arriving in Dublin, presented himself at the celebrated Gate Theatre. There he talked his way into the role of the onerous Duke Karl Alexander in JudSiiss and was, at sixteen, a minor sensation. Back home, he was able to secure a coveted position in Katharine Cornell and Guthrie McClintic's touring repertory company for the 1933-1934 season. In 1935, at nineteen, he had his Broadway acting breakthrough in Panic, Archibald MacLeish's experimental free verse play about the Wall Street crash. In 1936 he directed the legendary \"Voodoo Macbeth,\" and in 1937 Marc Blitzstein's leftist political opera The Cradle Will Rock. In 1937, when he and John Houseman founded their own repertory company, the Mercury Theatre, he had, at twenty-two, already established a reputation as the enfant terrible of American theater. His work in the fledgling medium of radio followed a similar trajectory. H e was on the air as an actor as early as 1934. When the Mercury Theatre expanded into radio, it fundamentally altered the nature of broadcast drama. In 1938, it achieved international notoriety for what is undoubtedly the single most famous radio program ever aired. In 1939 Welles negotiated a Hollywood contract with unprecedented creative guarantees, and at twenty-four, he was at work on what would turn out to be the great American film. Welles thrived on the marathon pace, the amphetamine highs, and the constant living on the edge that characterized these years. What excited him most was the sheer omnivorousness of it all. To those around him, he seemed driven. By what, John Houseman thought was obvious: Those of us who were close to Orson had long been aware of the obsessive part his father continued to play in his life. M u c h of what he had accomplished so precociously had been done out of a furious need to prove himself in the eyes of a man who was no longer there to see it. N o w that success had come, in quantities and of a kind that his father had never dreamed of, this conflict, far from being assuaged, seemed to grow more intense and consuming. 31\n\nApparently Houseman knew as little about Welles's childhood as Cotten. (This is also evident in the fact that the information about Welles's early years in Houseman's memoirs is taken from a 1938 New Yorker profile.) Rather than feeling compelled to live up to his father's legacy, Welles's real motivation seems to have been to escape it. Ironically,\n\n31\n\n18\n\nJohn Houseman, Run-Through: A Memoir (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1972), pp. 414-415.\n\nO E D I P U S IN INDIANAPOLIS\n\nhis relentlessness and constant overreaching were curses of excess on the same scale as Richard Welles's, with predictable results. For every triumph in the remarkable decade after his father's death, there was a comparable failure. (The lows are conveniently banished from the authorized version of the boy genius.) Unable to capitalize on the Gate Theatre experience, Welles returned in ignominy to the refuge of Todd School. He tried his hand at playwrighting, with dismal results, and worked on amateur dramatic productions. A chance meeting got him an introduction that led to the Cornell tour, but nothing more came out of it than the promise of a minor role in Romeo and Juliet on Broadway the following season, and he returned once again to Todd, where he organized a summer festival with the Gate Theatre stars. Romeo and Juliet did bring him to the attention of Houseman. Except for Doctor Faustus, their collaborations under the auspices of the Federal Theater Project offered more spectacle than dramatic substance, and Horse Eats Hat was a resounding flop. For all its lofty ambitions, the Mercury Theatre stage operation survived scarcely more than a year, a victim of political differences with backers, chronic underfunding, and above all, Welles's reckless extravagance. 32 Five Kings, his grandiose Shakespearean adaptation sponsored by the Theatre Guild, was a colossal disaster in the making and it closed out of town, burying Welles's credibility as a stage entrepreneur in the wreckage. Welles spent his first four months in Hollywood on an ill-conceived adaptation of Heart of Darkness which finally had to be abandoned, and briefly on a second project that never got beyond the scripting stage. Citizen Kane and The Magnificent Ambersons constitute another episode in the alternating pattern of success and failure that Welles's career entailed.\n\n3 Booth Tarkington was once considered the equal of his Midwestern contemporaries such as Sherwood Anderson and Sinclair Lewis. His literary mentor was William Dean Howells, and stylistically his work represents an amalgamation of the new realism of Howells and Dreiser and the older chronicle tradition of Thackeray and Trollope. The Magnificent Ambersons (1918) was the second novel in his so-called \"Growth\" trilogy, which dealt with the transformation of a fictionalized Indianapolis from its nineteenthcentury agrarian and mercantile roots into a modern, smokestack metropolis. In this novel, the historical theme is embodied in the framework of a simultaneous decline and ascent: the patrician Ambersons, unable to adapt to new ways, lose their fortune and stature while the enterprising Eugene Morgan achieves distinction in the thriving new field of automobile manufacture. T h e story's emotional center is an interlinking of romantic relationships between the Ambersons and the Morgans. T h e story begins in 1873. Isabel Amberson is the town beauty. Eugene Morgan, the foremost suitor for her hand, has too much to drink one night and loudly trips over the bass viol he has brought to serenade her. Regarding it as a mark of disrespect, Isabel henceforth spurns Eugene and marries a rival suitor, the feckless and dull Wilbur Minafer. Isabel and Wilbur have a single child, George, who is shamelessly indulged\n\n32\n\nSee Richard France's introduction to Orson Welles on Shakespeare: The W.P.A. and Mercury Theatre Pkyscripts (New York: Greenwood Press, 1990) for a revisionist view of Welles's accomplishments in theater.\n\nO E D I P U S IN INDIANAPOLIS\n\n19\n\nWelles and Mercury Theatre business manager Jack Moss in October 1941, shortly before shooting began on The Magnificent Ambersons.

Twenty years later Eugene Morgan returns, a widower with a marriageable daughter, Lucy. Isabel has maintained her exquisite beauty into middle age; Eugene is handsome, elegant, socially graceful, and self-possessed—the very opposite of Wilbur. Ancient passions are rekindled. George takes an instant disliking to Eugene. At the same time, he becomes romantically interested in Lucy. Wilbur has made a series of bad investments and his financial worries contribute to his early death. Eugene continues to call—on his spinster aunt Fanny Minafer's account, George thinks—but when George learns that Eugene's true interest is in his mother, he finds this situation unbearable. He begins to profess a deep reverence for his father that was never evident before, and he hypocritically invokes his father's memory to play on his mother's guilt. When Eugene calls to take Isabel for a drive, George orders him to stay away and slams the door in his face. After George rejects his mother's plea for reconciliation, she submits to his wishes, and the two of them go abroad alone. Isabel, always physically frail, falls ill. Shortly after their return, she worsens. Once again Eugene is prevented from seeing her. George is called to her bedside, and shortly afterward she dies. George, left penniless and with a spinster aunt to care for, forsakes a career in law to take a high-risk, high-pay job handling explosives. One day he is run down in the street by an automobile and has both legs broken. Lucy goes to him at the hospital and they are reconciled. After appropriate reflection, Eugene follows. Tarkington openly acknowledges one of his primary story sources. Shortly after George has succeeded in forcing Isabel to give Eugene up, he is in his bedroom preparing to dress for dinner. He is wearing a long black velvet lounging robe. He catches a glimpse of himself in the mirror and lingers for a moment on his reflection. In an instant of realization, a literary quotation enters his head. He recites the lines to himself: 'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother, Nor customary suits of solemn black . . . But I have that within which passeth show; These but the trappings and the suits of Woe.\n\nThe central conflict in The Magnificent Ambersons—a son's almost pathological jealousy of his widowed mother's suitor—is borrowed from Hamlet. A number of incidental story elements also seem to have been suggested by Shakespeare's play, although Tarkington has freely transposed circumstances and characterizations—such things as the death of the hero's father, the widow's putting aside her mourning habits (so some think) all too soon, an Ophelia figure whose father opposes her courtship by the hero, the son's taunting of his mother and impertinence to her suitor, and the mother's emotional perplexity and untimely death. Tarkington has also changed the fundamental disposition of the story—from tragedy to a tragical romance with an affirmative outcome.\n\nO E D I P U S IN INDIANAPOLIS\n\n21\n\nContinuity sketches for George's Hamlet scene, drawn by Joe St. Amon from Welles's first draft screenplay. The scene was deleted before shooting began.\n\nWith the arrival of Eugene, Isabel's loyalties become divided; for the first time in his life, George is faced with a lessening of his mother's unconditional devotion. What upsets him most is this implied maternal rejection. For Welles, the personal dimension of the situation was compounded: It has long been a family assumption that the author had my father in mind when he created the character which I will always think of as the Joseph Cotten role in The Magnificent Ambersons.31\n\nSurely Welles had some idea of the potential danger this kind of subject matter held for him. Possibly the success of the radio version, in which he played George, bolstered his confidence. If so, it was a serious miscalculation. Radio adaptation as he practiced it was very largely a gathering of dramatically incandescent and exceptionally sonorous passages strung together with clever transitional devices. The production of a film would involve a relentlessly painstaking working through of the story material extending over several months' time. Welles's extreme personal investment in the dramatic issues involved virtually insured that the process would be psychically divisive. In Citizen Kane Welles had toyed with the notion of a sexual component in the maternal relationship. In The Magnificent Ambersom Tarkington forced him to confront the issue directly. The occasion is the Amberson ball. George, his mother, and his grandfather are in the receiving line; Wilbur Minafer is inexplicably absent. George is about to meet Eugene for the first time. Standing beside his mother, George was disturbed by a sudden impression, coming upon him out of nowhere, so far as he could detect, that her eyes were brilliant, that she was graceful and youthful—in a word, that she was romantically lovely. He had one of those curious moments that seem to have neither a cause nor any connection with actual things. While it lasted, he was disquieted not by thoughts—for he had no definite thoughts—but by a slight emotion like that caused in a dream by the presence of something invisible, soundless, and yet fantastic. There was nothing different or new about his mother, except her new black and silver dress: she was standing there beside him, bending her head a little in her greetings, smiling the same smile she had worn for the half-hour that people had been passing the \"receiving\" group. Her face was flushed, but the room was warm; and shaking hands with so many people easily accounted for the pretty glow that was upon her. At any time she could have \"passed\" for twenty-five or twenty-six— a man of fifty would have honestly guessed her to be about thirty but possibly two or three years younger—and though extraordinary in this, she had been extraordinary in it for years. There was nothing in either her looks or her manner to explain George's uncomfortable feeling; and yet it increased, becoming suddenly a vague resentment, as if she had done something unmotherly to him. 34\n\nThat Welles comprehended the import of this is clear from George's behavior once he learns that Eugene has a romantic interest in his mother. In the bathroom scene with Uncle Jack, George is hysterical at the prospect of their marriage; in lines cut from the\n\n33\n\n\"My Father Wore Black Spats,\" p. 185.\n\n34\n\nBooth Tarkington, The Magnificent Ambersom (New York: Doubleday Page, 1918).

Freud's theory of an Oedipal subtext in Hamlet would have been available to Tarkington (Ernest Jones's famous elaboration of it was originally published in American Journal of Psychology in 1910), though there is no reason to believe he was familiar with it. Freud himself felt that writers had an instinctual understanding of this dynamic.\n\nO E D I P U S IN INDIANAPOLIS\n\n23\n\nrelease version, he called it \"unspeakable,\" \"monstrous,\" \"horrible.\"35 \"That you can sit there and speak of it!\" he screams. \"Your own sister!\" Though he takes a somewhat gentler tone with his mother, he makes the same perfidious insinuation; in a scene also removed from the release version (George and Isabel are discussing Eugene's letter), George asks, \"Do you suppose it ever occurs to him that I'm doing my simple duty?. . . That I'm doing what my father would do if he were here?\"36 In yet another scene removed from the release version, Isabel informs George by letter that she has acceded to his demands and given up Eugene. She writes, \"My darling, my beloved. I think I shouldn't mind anything very much as long as I have you all to myself.\"37 Shortly after, the two of them go abroad alone, almost as if on an extended honeymoon. On their return, George carries her in his arms to a waiting carriage. That there is an autobiographical implication in their relationship becomes evident in George's visit to Isabel on her deathbed, a scene that attempts the same aura of enchantment as in Welles's own maternal deathbed memoir. The association of Eugene Morgan with Richard Welles posed an even more perplexing difficulty. Richard Welles had once been such a person—a dashing and stylish entrepreneur who, at age twenty-three, founded the Badger Brass Company of Kenosha and was its general manager when he met Beatrice Ives. He was, according to report, \"largely responsible for its phenomenal success. The company grew from the original $25,000 capital to a concern worth $1,000,000\" when it was sold in 1906.38 But this was a different Richard Welles from the one his son knew. In his treatment of Eugene, Welles was coerced into an elaborate aesthetic fraudulence: he had to suspend his personal animus and, as it were, to reinvent his father as a double of his own exalted vision of himself. Adaptation necessities intensified the process. Tarkington's Eugene Morgan is a dimly realized and relatively minor character, an obligatory presence in a few showcase scenes functioning principally to deliver material of a homiletic nature. In casting a player of Joseph Cotten's stature as Eugene, Welles had made it obligatory to greatly expand the role. The Amberson ball provides a good illustration. In the novel, George and Lucy meet and engage straightaway and it is well into the evening before Eugene's identity is even revealed. In Welles's version, the action begins with an enraptured renewal of acquaintance between Eugene and Isabel as George, shut out for the moment, looks disdainfully on. Tarkington's ball ends with the general dancing in full swing. Welles's ends with Eugene and Isabel, oblivious to George and Lucy's presence, dancing alone like lovers after everyone else has gone. He added other new scenes for Eugene, such as the one in the arbor when Eugene urges Isabel to reveal their relationship to George. One effect of such changes is to intensify the Oedipal character of George's hatred for Eugene. In Hamlet, in Freud's view, the continued presence of the Oedipal rival drove the young prince into a form of extreme self-abasement. A similar process occurred in Welles's adaptation: in the same way that he amplified Eugene's character, he diminished George's. Tarkington's George is much more rounded. For all his lofty arrogance, he has a number of redeeming virtues. He is brighter and cleverer by far than his peers.

His refusal to pursue a career is motivated not by indolence or lassitude but by a sincere belief that he belongs to an aristocracy of privilege. He takes pride in the family and, within the family circle, is generous to a fault. H e genuinely loves Lucy and reveals a tender and vulnerable side to her that he shows to no one else. Lucy is not the only one to recognize that George appears at his best when he is most transparent: her father observes that \"in all my life, the most arrogant people I've known have been the most sensitive\" (p. 73), and Uncle Jack (Uncle George in the novel) tells his nephew at their final parting, \"the stuff of the old stock is in you. It'll come out and do something\" (p. 208). George's most sympathetic moment is when he unflinchingly faces up to the truth: that he ruined his mother's life and hastened her death to no end; the gossip would have died down soon enough of its own accord, and besides, the town had ceased to care about the Ambersons and their doings anyway. Welles eliminated most of these subtleties and shadings in George's character, with the result that he comes off in the film as merely an arrogant, obnoxious snob. Welles's original ending radically amplified his vilification of George and corresponding elevation of Eugene. In the novel, Eugene reads of George's accident as he is traveling east by train. W h e n he arrives in New York, he visits a medium and through her establishes communication with the spirit of Isabel, who seems to be asking him to forgive her son. When he arrives home, he goes immediately to George's hospital room—Lucy is there already—and reconciliations abound. T h e supernatural element is not one of Tarkington's finer displays of creative imagination. When Welles was preparing the radio version of The Magnificent Ambersons in 1939, he wisely dispensed with it and had Eugene come around in a more conventional manner, as a result of Lucy's urging. H e eliminated direct representation of the scene in George's hospital room, however, and instead had Eugene read an entry in his diary addressed to Isabel describing it to her. In the shooting script, Welles had the film ending in this same way. But just before shooting began he suddenly instituted an even more extreme departure from the novel. As originally shot, the film ended with Eugene visiting Fanny at the decrepit boarding house where she now resides. As Fanny rocks away and (a recurring motif) stares coldly into the distance, Eugene, oblivious to her feelings as always, rattles on about how he distinctly felt Isabel's presence in the hospital room. Welles thought it \"the best scene in the picture.\" 39 Even in the bland language of the cutting continuity, there are intimations of how powerful it must have been. Joseph Cotten, however, wondered if it might not be too Chekhovian for its own good. Preview audiences, accustomed as they were to upbeat and overwrought Hollywood endings, certainly found it so. In any case, the boardinghouse ending provided a means of eliminating George as a presence in the story. While this is a total reversal of expectations and an almost perverse denial of closure, it can nevertheless be seen as the ultimate culmination of Welles's reversal of stature of the two characters. The process itself can be seen as having an actual correspondence to Welles's life. For just as Welles methodically debased his alterego George, in the course of making The Magnificent Ambersons 35\n\nThe Orson Welles Story, Arena (BBC television series), broadcast May 18 and 2 1 , 1 9 8 2 .\n\nO E D I P U S IN INDIANAPOLIS\n\n25\n\nhe devalued himself artistically, often behaved in a manner that seems almost calculatedly detrimental, and eventually withdrew himself from direct participation in its realization. For the only time in one of his major productions, Welles declined the leading role in The Magnificent Ambersons. The reason usually advanced is that he had grown up too much to be convincing as a college boy. This explanation has always been accepted at face value. Close scrutiny reveals its inadequacy. For one thing, Welles did not exhibit such fastidiousness with the other roles in the film. Early in the story, for instance, he asks us to accept Joseph Cotten, then in his middle thirties, as an ardent swain of twenty, and Dolores Costello, the same age as Cotten but showing it much more, as a girl of eighteen (a singularly ludicrous presentment in the shot of her puffy, middleaged face in the window when Eugene trips over and smashes the bass viol). As the story progresses, he asks us further to accept that both could reappear twenty years later still looking almost the same. As George, Welles, who was then twenty-six, might have strained credulity somewhat in his younger scenes—a club meeting when he is supposed to be seventeen (a scene shot by Welles but later removed) and the Amberson ball and the snow ride, when he is supposed to be nineteen, but nowhere to the extent of Cotten or Costello earlier. Besides, Welles still had his baby face, and there were technical means of making him appear younger, such as makeup and lighting. (Makeup wizard Maurice Seiderman, who had performed virtual miracles with the age requirements on Citizen Kane, also worked on The Magnificent Ambersons.) Welles's height was not really a problem, since Tarkington's George is described as unusually tall. He is also exceedingly handsome, as Welles was in his twenties. As the story progressed and George aged, any perceived problem of this sort would have vanished of its own accord. When George returns from abroad with Isabel, he is only a year younger than Welles actually was, and at the time of his automobile accident he is a year older. Tim Holt has the sole advantage of a slightly more youthful appearance for the early scenes (he was then twenty-two), but for the most part the dramatic and physical requirements of the role are beyond his capabilities, and he comes off as something of a dunce. On the other hand, George Minafer could have been one of Welles's great roles. Welles seems to have been aware of this; \"I was planning to play the part,\" he told an interviewer at the time, \"but I decided [Holt] was the logical person for it. It wasn't an easy decision for me to make.\" 40 The conclusion seems inescapable that, rather than being extremely scrupulous in casting the role of George, Welles was deliberately avoiding it himself. For the first month the film was in production, there were high spirits all around on the set. The ballroom scene, the film's great virtuosic tour de force, was completed, as well as two other key scenes, the dinner for Eugene and George's encounter with Fanny afterward on the stairs. But as shooting proceeded, the atmosphere changed. Welles himself grew increasingly moody and irritable. Those around him were accustomed to his flareups and constant swings in temper. But nothing before had persisted for so long or been as dark. Some detected what they thought a streak of outright meanness. 41 That Welles was more overextended than usual undoubtedly contributed, but a more 40\n\nQuoted by Cyril Vandour in \"Holt ic Sons,\" Photoplay 21, no. 6 (November 1942), p. 90.\n\nRichard Wilson and Amalia Kent, two of those who worked with him most closely on the production, recall the peculiarity of Welles's conduct at this time.\n\n41\n\n26\n\nOEDIPUS IN INDIANAPOLIS\n\nlikely clue to his behavior is that the film's story elements that were personally most vexatious to Welles were being shot during this time. It was at this point, when Welles was at his most vulnerable, that the South American opportunity arose. As part of an effort to foster hemispheric relations, the U.S. State Department section on Inter-American Affairs approached R K O with a proposal for a film to be shot on location in Brazil accentuating native customs and themes; the Department would partially underwrite the venture. With the concurrence of Nelson Rockefeller, Coo r d i n a t o r of Inter-American Affairs, RKO President George Schaefer offered the assignment to Welles.42 Welles accepted—out of genuine enthusiasm, unquestionably, but it was also a way of distancing himself from The Magnificent Ambersons. The centerpiece of the South American film was to be the Carnival in Rio. In order to be in place in Rio by Carnival time in mid-February, he would have to speed up shooting on The Magnificent Ambersons and would barely have time to complete it; postproduction would be left in the hands of others. In yet another display of moody excitability, he replaced cinematographer Stanley Cortez (who worked slowly but with scintillating results) with a reliable but totally commonplace RKO studio cameraman for the duration. Robert Wise, the film's editor, was placed in charge of postproduction. He had edited Citizen Kane and enjoyed Welles's full confidence, although his ultimate accountability was to his employer, RKO. Jack Moss, business manager for the Mercury Theatre operation, was left behind as general overseer and liaison between Welles and the studio. Moss had no experience in film production and was never taken seriously by the studio hierarchy. Duplicate footage was to be sent to Welles in Rio and he would supervise the editing by cable, telephone, and shortwave radio. W h e n the impracticability of this arrangement became evident, Welles asked for Wise to be sent to Rio, but this proved unworkable because of wartime travel restrictions. Wise proceeded according to the editing plan Welles had laid out just before leaving the country and subsequent instructions coming in from Rio. After he had completed a final cut and was readying a print for shipment to Rio, Welles suddenly ordered an extraordinary set of changes. All the footage between Isabel's receiving Eugene's letter and the family gathered in the hallway outside Isabel's room just before her death was to be removed. This would involve the following scenes: George and Isabel discussing Eugene's letter, Isabel's letter slipped under George's door telling him she will renounce Eugene, George's walk with Lucy on the street, the drugstore and poolroom, Fanny and the Major on the veranda one evening discussing their bad investments, Jack's visit to the Morgans, and Isabel's return. 43 In place of the cut would go a single new scene to be shot by Wise in which George enters his mother's room to find her unconscious. The new sequence of events would be: Isabel receives Eugene's letter, falls unconscious, and dies shortly after. Wise's original cut was shipped to Welles on March 11 as scheduled. Meanwhile, Wise proceeded quickly with shooting of the new scene and the substitution was made in time for the first preview on March 17 in Pomona. As is well known, the Pomona 42\n\nSchaefer to Welles [?April 29, 1942], undated transcription in George Schaefer Collection, Western Heritage Center, Laramie, Wyoming. 43\n\nC u t t i n g continuity, reel 5A shot 4 through reel 5B to second lap dissolve in shot 7, approximately 13 minutes 4 0 seconds.\n\nO E D I P U S IN I N D I A N A P O L I S\n\n27\n\npreview was disastrous. A raucous, largely teenage audience had just been treated to a rousing wartime musical. Now they found themselves confronted with a complex, slow-paced, and generally downbeat period drama. Worse, its dramatic center was truncated. It is difficult to imagine how the impact of what Moss came to call Welles's \"big cut\" could have been anything other than devastating for the story. Having Isabel collapse and die as an immediate consequence of George's turning Eugene away is pure melodrama. The subtle Chekhovian quality Welles was said to be aiming for resided largely in the fragile emotional balance between Isabel and George: however reprehensible he was, Isabel partly bore the blame. She was freely complicitous in her fate; taking away this mitigating circumstance would leave George irredeemably venomous. One likely explanation for an action so rash is that Welles was being driven by a private motive. The Oedipal character of George's relationship with his mother was most apparent—indeed, virtually explicit—in the deleted footage. Whether out of guilt, dread of personal self-exposure, or simply a generalized unease, Welles had second thoughts and wanted it taken out. That Welles's own reediting was partly to blame for the extreme hostility of the reaction at Pomona seems an inescapable conclusion. Wise and Moss quickly restored all of Welles's big cut except for the scene of Fanny and the Major in time for a second preview in Pasadena on March 19. This time the audience reaction was much more favorable, not an unexpected outcome at an upscale location like Pasadena. But demographics are only part of the explanation. In his scene by scene account of the preview reactions, Wise emphasized that each of the restored scenes had been received favorably. George and Lucy's walk, he reported, had even played \"beautifully.\" Clearly, Schaefer had on his hands what the industry (usually with some derogation) called a \"special\" picture—one with appeal for only a limited segment of the filmgoing audience that stood no chance of recouping anywhere near its $1,000,000 cost. Schaefer forlornly delivered the bad news. Welles liked to depict Schaefer as something of a buffoon, as with the story that he had fallen asleep when The Magnificent Ambersons was first pitched to him. Perhaps he had, but Welles always neglected to mention that when Schaefer did give his assent for the film to proceed, it was with a major condition. Welles would give up the right of final cut which he had enjoyed in his original contract; after the first preview of The Magnificent Ambersons, the film could be edited at RKO's sole discretion. Schaefer avoided precipitous action for a time, perhaps a sign that he was considering some form of accommodation. But increasing signs of deep trouble on the South American venture, combined with lackluster box-office results on Citizen Kane, gradually eroded his confidence, and the order came: take whatever steps are necessary to make the film more attractive to a mass audience. Once again, Wise was put in charge. Instructions continued to flow in from Welles—he still wanted the big cut and other changes that may, to some, seem even more questionable—but Wise had been granted authority to act on his sole discretion; Schaefer himself would be final arbiter. The version cleared for release by Schaefer on June 8 ran eighty-eight minutes ten seconds, forty-three minutes shorter than the original version\n\n28\n\nO E D I P U S IN INDIANAPOLIS\n\nof March 11. It was test-marketed in July to spotty results and was in effect abandoned by the studio. Welles's verdict: \" They destroyed Ambersons and it destroyed me.\"44 To the contrary, Welles himself must bear the ultimate responsibility for the affair's outcome. It was a string of questionable judgments and rash actions on his part that paved the way to the film's undoing. In adapting the story, he pitilessly denigrated the central character, forfeited the opportunity to appear in this role himself, and impulsively assigned it to an inferior performer. Welles himself might have redeemed the part, but preview audiences were unrelentingly hostile to Tim Holt. Regardless of how one views Welles's premature withdrawal from the film's production, the fact remains that he took no special precautions to safeguard its welfare in his absence. To the contrary, he entrusted the film's fate entirely to lower-level subordinates who would be powerless to defend his interests if the need arose. At the last minute, he had second thoughts and insisted on a drastic alteration that would almost certainly imperil the film's prospects with an audience. When serious difficulties did arise, there was no one to take charge on Welles's behalf, and his surrender of the right of final cut left the studio free to act as it chose. This is not to say that Welles acted irresponsibly; that he behaved evasively would be a more accurate characterization. Regarding each action, a vexatious personal involvement in the material was at play, and this factor overrode Welles's aesthetic judgment. He was divided against himself: engaged on one side of his nature in the creation of (judging from what does survive) one of the most visually brilliant films ever made in Hollywood, a formidable rival even to Citizen Kane, but on another side almost at the mercy of an elemental disquietude that impaired his artistic responsibility and detachment.\n\n4 The South American project ended in disaster. Schaefer was deposed as studio head largely on account of Welles, and Welles's contract with RKO was terminated. Welles returned to Hollywood and remained visible through his involvement in entertaining troops but it soon became clear that he would never be entrusted with a major production again on his own terms. After directing and starring in two thrillers, the tedious The Stranger (1946) and the stylish but impenetrable The Lady From Shanghai (1948), he returned to Shakespeare and for the following decade committed his principal energies to Shakespearean tragedy. Macbeth (1948), made for a studio that specialized in serials and B westerns, was an adaptation of a stage production put on at the Utah Centennial Festival the previous year; it is characterized by typically outrageous Wellesean interpolations and by touches of dazzling visual brilliance. Othello (1952) was the first of his international productions, released to widespread critical acclaim in Europe but generally ignored in the United States. During a hiatus in the shooting of the film, he appeared in a London stage version of the play produced by Laurence Olivier, to mixed reviews. In 1953, he\n\n44\n\nThe Orson Welles Story.\n\nO E D I P U S IN INDIANAPOLIS\n\n29\n\nWelles at 30, physically an ideal specimen for Hamlet.\n\nappeared on American television in a highly acclaimed King Lear directed by Peter Brook, and in 1956 he returned to New York in a controversial stage version of the play he directed himself, in which he was forced to perform from a wheelchair because of a leg injury sustained during rehearsals. There is a conspicuous absence: Why is there no Hamlet? The omission is all the more puzzling when we recall what a formative role it had occupied in Welles's early career. In 1932, at age sixteen, he made his debut in classical theater at the Gate in Dublin as the ghost of Hamlet's father. The following year, when he took dramatic lessons in preparation for the road tour with the Katharine Cornell company, his primer was Hamlet—indeed, it was said, the personal signed copy of John Barrymore, who had studied with the same dramatic coach.45 In 1934, his dual appearance as Claudius and his brother's ghost in the Todd School summer festival earned him a string of superlatives in a Chicago newspaper review.46 His first directorial credit on network radio was for a two-part Hamlet in which he also starred for the Columbia Workshop series in the fall of 1936. A second Hamlet for radio to be produced, directed, adapted by, and to star Welles was announced for the Mercury Theatre \"First Person Singular\" series for August 18, 1938, but was dropped from the schedule without explanation.47 After this, he never did the play again in any medium. An explanation sometimes advanced is that Welles was too old and physically ungainly for Hamlet by the time of his major Shakespearean phase. Actually, in 1947 he was as trim and physically attractive as at any time in his adult life. Also, he was thirtyone—only one year older than Hamlet at the time of his father's death. (The current presumption that Hamlet is a younger man is probably most attributable to Laurence Olivier's interpretation in his 1948 film, the most widely seen of modern productions. Incidentally, Olivier was forty at the time.) I asked Welles's two closest associates (next to Houseman) in the heyday of the Mercury Theatre to comment on the anomaly. Richard Wilson said that Welles had spoken of doing Hamlet many times but just never got around to it.48 William Alland conjectured that the explanation lay in the personal dimension of the material. Hamlet's \"great scream,\" all his \"anguish\" about his parental relationships—\"it's like Orson.\" Hamlet's a very disturbed young man. Very mixed u p in his feelings. . . . I think that Orson understood H a m l e t — I mean, there's many Hamlets you know, but I think O r s o n had a particular idea of his Hamlet, and I think it would be very similar—he would look very similar to Orson. . . . I think O r s o n could have played Hamlet, but I have a h u n c h he was intimidated inside. . . . I think it would expose . . . you k n o w his childhood, d o n ' t you? 49\n\nIn a sense, Welles did produce a vernacular version of Hamlet in The Magnificent Ambersons. One lesson he might have learned from the experience of that film was that parental relationships were too disruptive a force in his psychological life to be brought under creative control. Perhaps he did, and that is why there is no actual Hamlet. In any case, with The Magnificent Ambersons the egotistic, or Oedipal, fixation on childhood 45\n\nCharles Collins, \"Eighteen Years O l d , Scores H i t in Shakespeare\" and J u n e Provines, \" F r o n t Views a n d Profiles,\" unidentified newspaper c o l u m n s , HRC.\n\n46\n\nH e r m a n Davies, Chicago Daily News, u n d a t e d ,\n\nHRG\n\n47\n\nFor the radio i n f o r m a t i o n I a m indebted to Professor Michael O g d e n , a u t h o r of a f o r t h c o m i n g b o o k on Welles's career in radio.\n\n48\n\nInterview with Richard W i l s o n , O c t o b e r 29, 1987.\n\n49\n\nInterview with William Alland, O c t o b e r 28, 1987.\n\nO E D I P U S IN INDIANAPOLIS\n\n31\n\nceased to be a primary motivating force in his work. (Artifacts of it still occasionally appear, as in Mr. Arkadin, where the Welles character is excessively, almost incestuously protective of his daughter—played by Paola Mori, whom Welles would later marry— and extravagantly jealous of her potential lover.) In a rare moment of candor, Welles once told an interviewer that doing The Magnificent Ambersons had been a mistake. The reason he gave was that the film did nothing for his reputation as an actor. Instead, he said, \"I should have gone back to New York and played Hamlet.\"50\n\n50\n\n32\n\nThe Orson Welles Story.\n\nOEDIPUS IN INDIANAPOLIS\n\n2\n\nA NOTE ON TEXTUAL PRACTICE\n\nCutting and continuity axe film studio terms for editing and story events. A cutting continuity is a written transcription of the contents of the final edited version of a narrative film in the form in which it is intended for release to theaters. In general terms, it is an alternative representation of a film's text in a variant medium. In the studio system, a cutting continuity was prepared for each film released. It provided the following information in the order indicated: number of the reel holding the contents indicated, duration of individual shots expressed in feet plus additional frames, sequential number of each shot, abbreviated descriptions of the images that appear on the screen and of noise effects or music on the soundtrack, and all dialogue or voiceover narration. The nature of the information suggests the primary use for which cutting continuities were intended: to allow discrete segments of the film to be easily located on the 35mm reels on which they were mounted. The cutting continuity was mimeographed and copies were included with prints of the film sent out to the regional distribution exchanges. If cuts were ordered after a film was put into release, or if replacement footage was needed for a damaged print, the cutting continuity was the basis for transactions with the exchanges. In any other circumstances requiring the perusal or manipulation of a portion of a film's contents (excerpting, for instance), the cutting continuity served as the point of reference. In the studio's day-to-day operations, a file copy of the cutting continuity would be used as a guide to the film's contents wherever possible to get around the cumbersome procedure of having to consult the film itself. Finally, in those days a facsimile such as a cutting continuity was usually deposited for copyright registration in place of an original copy of a film. Cutting continuities were prepared by technical assistants in the studio's editorial department and sent to the typing pool, where different secretaries each worked on a single reel simultaneously. The procedure was usually handled with breakneck speed, since the time between completion of a finished cut of the film and its first showing requiring backup material (a sneak preview, for instance) might be as little as three\n\ndays. The technical information in the continuities was flawlessly precise, since an error in a footage count could result in faulty instructions to the film laboratory and costly delays. The descriptions of the images were prepared with considerably less care. They were extremely sparse and written in a kind of staccato prose shorthand. These qualities reflected their primary function: to identify just the essential features of the shot (setting, camera and figure location and movement, sounds) without regard for stylistic values or story context. Following is the cutting continuity description of the shot in The Magnificent Ambersons of Eugene and Isabel dancing alone after the ball is over, perhaps the single most visually exhilarating moment in the film: INT. HALL LS - Musicians standing a r o u n d in F G by Xmas trees - Playing - Eugene and Isabel in BG dancing -\n\nIn fact, there is only one Christmas tree in the shot, and Eugene and Isabel are actually dancing in the extreme background. The transcriber is jotting down rough first impressions and letting it go at that. Working in this manner actually encouraged imprecision if not outright inaccuracy, and the more complex a film's narrative system, the higher the rate of misrepresentation. The cutting continuity of The Magnificent Ambersons is filled with incorrect or misleading information, such as factual errors concerning the images, faulty dialogue transcriptions, and attributions of dialogue to the wrong speaker. It also has a tendency to bypass situations that inhibit speed, giving a single phrase such as talk indistinctly for dialogue faintly heard (as when spoken at a distance from the camera) or all talk at once for overlapping (but nevertheless decipherable) dialogue. In addition, there is considerable variation among transcribers in spelling, punctuation, hyphenation, and grammatical usage, as well as in such matters as degree of familiarity with the story material and sometimes even standardized scripting conventions (for instance, in the designations given to shots in the range between medium shot and closeup). The secretaries in the RKO typing pool worked more scrupulously, proofreading the mimeographed masters aloud in teams and turning out highly accurate copies of the material as received, but they too displayed individual vagaries of usage. Indeed, one suspects it would have been possible to identify certain typists solely on the basis of their patterns of use of spaces, dashes, and periods. But minor errors and inconsistencies of these sorts rarely mattered. So long as the description was correctly matched with its corresponding shot number and footage count, the stripped down, first impression version adequately served the studio's purpose. The only complete surviving record of an original, long version of The Magnificent Ambersons is the RKO cutting continuity of March 12, 1942. This version of the film was assembled by Robert Wise according to a precise set of instructions given him by Welles when the two screened a rough cut at the Fleischer Studios in Miami in early February as Welles was en route to South America. It ran 131 minutes, 45 l A seconds. It is the text used for the reconstruction plan in this volume. Actually, the film was never\n\n34\n\nTEXTUAL PRACTICE\n\nshown publicly in this form. Welles ordered cuts and at least one major change before the first preview o n March 17. Most of the cuts were restored by others for the second preview on March 19, but other scenes were left out. After the second preview, the massive reediting ordered by the studio began. Apparently no full transcription of the early changes by Welles was prepared, but even if one had been, the March 12 cutting continuity would in all likelihood still be the preferred master plan. After all, Welles had not yet seen the March 12 version when he ordered the changes, and his impulsive second guesses were not always improvements. Indeed, those of March 17 may even have contributed to the extremely negative reactions to that preview. T h e March 12 version is in close accord with the plan of shooting and is a full representation of Welles's original intention. T h e aim of the reconstruction of The Magnificent Ambersons undertaken in this volume is to enable the reader to gain as clear an impression of the original film as is possible from the materials which survive. T h e first step toward achieving this goal was to provide a clear and consistent foundation text. In effect, this meant transforming the cutting continuity f r o m a somewhat offputting technical-functional document into a reader-oriented one. Since the cutting continuity was prepared wholly by others and had no directorial authority, the necessary changes could legitimately be made so long as certain proprieties were observed. Following is the cutting continuity treatment of the shot showing how Wilbur Minafer n o w has the upper hand over Eugene in the courtship of Isabel (reel 1A): 21-7\n\n34.\n\nE X T .

Wilbur Minafer? I never thought he'd get her. Well, what do you know. Following are explanations for the changes:\n\nTEXTUAL PRACTICE\n\nGiving footage count before shot number serves a film editor's needs; a reader typically refers to shot numbers much more often than to footage counts. Setting this technical information apart should make reading of the written text more congenial. So too should the substitution of a more familiar typeface. Shot descriptions in cutting continuities are so formulaic that a reader adjusts to them without much effort. This one is unusually detailed, but the transcriber has fuzzied the sequence and logical relation of events. T h e material has been rewritten for clarity, specific details have been added, and run-on phrasing (\"Turn hurry down walk\") has been eliminated through rewording. Before changes of any sort were made in the cutting continuity descriptions of shots, however, the length of the corresponding shot in the release version was calculated on a Steenbeck viewing table to ensure that the two versions exactly matched. (Variations were treated on a case-to-case basis and are usually indicated in the footnotes.) Although the writing has been considerably revised, the elemental syntactic features of the shot descriptions have been maintained. T h e first of these is the staccato prose rhythm. T h e second may not be immediately discernible. In the cutting continuity, when a shot opens with action in progress (as in the example above), participles are used to set the scene.
