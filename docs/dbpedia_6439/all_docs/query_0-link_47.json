        "text": "Orson Welles sure knew what he was doing when he commissioned Norman Rockwell to design the original poster art for The Magnificent Ambersons. The same foolish, fatuous nostalgia for an era that never really existed — and that, if it had existed, would hardly be worth preserving — also pervades this work of Welles’.\n\nBut then you get to the issue of whether Ambersons is even really Welles’ work. The man himself would tell you it’s not — that the essence of his work got left on the cutting-room floor and destroyed — and of course we should take him at his word. But so much of what Welles owned up to and claimed to be proudest of in Ambersons are precisely those things that make it unwatchable today.\n\nOf course, many claim to love the movie — with some of those even having the gall to call it better than Citizen Kane — and we should probably assume that at least some of them are being honest, and not just angling for contrarianism.\n\nThe movie is a mess from beginning to end, thematically, philosophically, stylistically — in pretty much every -ally possible. Why is it that Ambersons continues to be revered, in spite of its terrible and fundamental flaws? I think I know some of the answers.\n\nThe story of The Magnificent Ambersons long ago passed into legend: Welles’ first movie after Kane. Melodramatic adaptation of Booth Tarkington’s family saga. After receiving Welles’ rough cut, RKO insists on further cuts following a disastrous preview in Pomona, California. But there’s a problem, at least if you’re Orson Welles: you’re in Brazil, making a movie called It’s All True in an attempt to help foster wartime goodwill among nations. RKO cuts a further forty minutes and reshoots the ending. Welles’ attempts to supervise the editing are virtually impossible by telegram, and wartime travel restrictions prevent the nominal editor, Robert Wise, from going to Brazil to collaborate with him on the job. Welles is terribly upset over what he considers the butchering of a masterpiece. The cut footage is destroyed, ostensibly to make room in the storage vaults, and so is lost forever.\n\nBecause of this lost footage, and because of the footage shot in Welles’ absence, the film has become the object of a longing as irrational as the longing for the Ambersons’ way of life. And let’s talk about that ending, which Welles would spend the rest of his days complaining about to anyone who would listen. Not only is it the same ending as in the Tarkington novel that Welles claimed to admire so much; it’s the same ending Welles himself had used in the radio adaptation he’d done for The Campbell Playhouse just a few years earlier.\n\nThe truth is, the movie makes a mess of itself long before it reaches that Hollywood ending of reconciliation between its two male leads. As the film opens, the narrator — Welles himself, expressing sentiments much like his own — rues the disappearance of the Ambersons’ way of life, in those days before “their Midland town spread and darken[ed] into a city.”\n\nThis was Indiana in 1873, and “In that town in those days, all the women who wore silk or velvet knew all the other women who wore silk or velvet, and everybody knew everybody else’s family horse-and-carriage.”\n\nSuch a pity.\n\n“The only public conveyance was the street-car. A lady could whistle to it from an upstairs window and the car would halt at once and wait for her while she shut the window, put on her hat and coat, went downstairs, found an umbrella, told the girl what to have for dinner and came forth from the house.”\n\nAh, the indentured servitude of post-slavery Reconstruction, when everyone had a “girl.” Those really were the days….\n\n“Too slow for us nowadays, because the faster we’re carried, the less time we have to spare.”\n\nIn other words: The Automobile Ruined Everything. It destroyed a way of life, and in the doing it destroyed this particular family. This is what Welles wants us to believe and wants us to feel, and yet the man in his film who is the automobile’s signal proponent, the man who brings the automobile to Indianapolis — Joseph Cotten as Eugene Morgan — is by a good measure the most decent character in the movie.\n\nAnd anyway, it’s neither Morgan nor his automobile that destroys the Ambersons; the Ambersons destroy themselves, or at least are destroyed from within, by George Amberson Minafer (Tim Holt), the young man of the family, who simply can’t abide his mother’s passion, in her widowhood, for Eugene — a fair-minded, agreeable man who simply wants to bring technological progress to this town, and love to this family, but who is rejected at every turn for his beneficence and benevolence by people too ignorant to see love and progress for the gifts they are.\n\nThat’s what Ambersons is about — both in Welles’ original script and in the finished film — whether he knew it or not, or was willing to acknowledge it or not.\n\nIt’s easy to see why cinephiles have fallen for such clumsily handled, philosophically confused mawkishness. The film is steeped in legend — is positively saturated with it — and has been for decades. RKO’s meddling with the final product — with what should have been the final product — is generally held responsible for destroying not just The Magnificent Ambersons but Welles’ entire career to follow — that refuse-strewn road of projects partially finished and then discarded. It’s as if the filmgoing community is just as reluctant to acknowledge Welles’ own complicity in his downfall as Welles is to acknowledge the Ambersons’ complicity in theirs.\n\nThose less forgiving ofWelles attribute the film’s mauling to Welles’ carelessness. It’s well-known that in Rio he’d become enchanted with the women of Brazil, but so what? Welles had been enchanted with women wherever he went, and that didn’t stop him from satisfactorily completing all sorts of ambitious projects, up to and including the film that created cinema as we know it today.\n\nIt’s apparent that Welles cared to some degree what was happening to his film, that he was trying to stop it, and that, due to the restraints of the day’s technology, he was failing to do so. There’s a special irony in this, since Ambersons purports to be a film about how technology ruins life’s authentic pleasures — those of sleigh rides and dress balls and nighttime serenades. Coming from a man whose technical innovations had invented modern filmmaking, this is pretty rich. Coming from a man whose masterpiece — and hence, many believe, whose career — was ruined by an absence of technology, this is doubly rich.\n\nSo what would have happened, then? What would have happened if Welles and his editor Robert Wise had been able to swap files digitally or at least talk on the telephone (or if wartime restrictions hadn’t prevented Wise from traveling to South America to work with Welles in person)? We’d certainly, at the very least, have a film that knows how to make room for itself to breathe — a film whose narrative isn’t so ridiculously compressed, you can’t even tell what’s supposed to have happened in the transitions.\n\nWe’d still have the problem of the Ambersons themselves, however, and of Welles’ incomprehensible inclination to idealize their world. And that’s a dual-headed problem fierce enough to ruin any picture.\n\nAmbersons is justly celebrated for its cinematography, so very obviously masterminded by Welles himself. It’s of the same bravura, try-anything style of that found in Kane, except with Stanley Cortez instead of Gregg Toland as the man behind the camera. This isn’t to dismiss Toland, who taught Welles so much about the craft of photography in Kane (or even Cortez, whose technical expertise was required to realize Welles’ vision here); it’s just to give Welles his due. If it’s true that Welles doesn’t deserve our pity, it’s also true that he doesn’t deserve our neglect.\n\nThe best shots in Ambersons are conspicuous, and they stay with you. There’s Eugene’s face reflected prominently in the window as he looks down disapprovingly, contemptuously, on his mother.\n\nThere’s the mansion interior in the ballroom scenes.\n\nThere’s Major Amberson (Richard Bennett) experiencing an existential crisis at the moment of his death.\n\nThere’s the Amberson mansion in the end, looking haunted and abandoned, its furniture covered, its parlors empty.\n\nThere’s Eugene praying bedside in his long-predicted (by others) moment of comeuppance.\n\nThere’s the mansion exterior during a nocturnal thunderstorm.\n\nThere’s George’s silhouette darkening the door at the funeral parlor where his father lay.\n\nMost beautifully of all, there’s the Amberson sleigh pulled gliding by its horse through a winter wonderland, spied fleetingly in the reflection of a clear stream cut through the snow, luminous and lucid. This shot, and the scene it sets up, tells us so much about the movie, what’s right and what’s wrong about it, and could almost serve as a synecdoche for the whole.\n\nOn its journey, the Ambersons’ horse-drawn sleigh passes the horseless carriage, broken-down in the snow, of Eugene and his daughter Lucy. George gloats to Eugene about the failure of his automobile and continues on his merry way. Or he starts to, but the sleigh tips over near an embankment and the horse keeps on running, its passengers deposited roadside. Eugene pulls up in his automobile — his “horseless carriage” — and offers the Ambersons a ride. George’s mother is grateful. When Eugene asks George for some help in the form of a push from behind, this embarrassing episode becomes for George altogether humiliating.\n\nWhat is this scene trying to tell us? Quite obviously it’s trying to tell us that the Ambersons’ way of life, once a source of superior self-identity, is being overtaken and then passed up by the automobile. But who is the symbol for this outmoded way of life? It’s George, the unequivocal rascal of the piece. If Welles wanted us to long for what the Ambersons long for, why did he frame his story in these terms? And why did he make Eugene such a fair-minded fellow, willing to concede of his nemesis George that “he’s still only a boy. There’s plenty of fine stuff in him”? What’s more, when George later confronts Eugene at the dinner table by proclaiming that automobiles will “never amount to anything but a nuisance,” Euegene, pleasant and reasonable as ever, says, “I’m not sure George is wrong about automobiles. With all their speed forward they may be a step backward in civilization. It may be that they won’t add to the beauty of the world, nor to the life of men’s souls. I am not sure. But automobiles have come, and almost all outward things are going to be different because of what they bring.”\n\n“You see, the basic intention,” Welles told Peter Bogdanovich in the 1970s, “was to portray a golden world — almost one of memory — and then show what it turns into. Having set up this dream town of the ‘good old days,’ the whole point was to show the automobile wrecking it — not only the family but the town.” This is what Welles claims was stolen from the movie by the studio edit, but the truth is, this basic narrative is still very much there, albeit in disastrously abbreviated form. The even-more-disastrous thing about the movie as it stands isn’t the studio edit but an ill-conceived premise that, like the Ambersons’ way of life, was hardly worth salvaging in the first place.\n\nFortunately, there are a few willing to defy orthodoxy and call out Ambersons for the fundamental mess that it is. Sometimes, you find them in the strangest places. When Vanity Fair visited the set of the 2002 remade-for-television miniseries (another disastrous piece of filmmaking), James Cromwell — cast as Major Amberson — told the writer David Kamp, “I think Welles knew he had a bad film. It’s a horrendous film! It was horrendous before the edit! As a follow-up to a film that essentially rewrote all the rules? C’mon! I just don’t believe the performers are compelling. There’s no magic between Costello and Cotten. It looks like a second-rate Hollywood period melodrama. I think Welles knew he didn’t have anything.”\n\n“I think, someplace down the line, he got tired of dealing with [Ambersons],” said Wise in that same Vanity Fair piece. “He loved the partying, he loved the women, and he kind of forgot about the film, lost interest. It was pretty much ‘You take care of this, Bob. I have other things to do.’”\n\nWe need to be cautious about trusting the testimony of Wise, who benefited more than anyone from the RKO edit, landing himself in the good graces of the studio while launching a successful directorial career of his own (The Day the Earth Stood Still, West Side Story, The Sand Pebbles, The Sound of Music). It’s hard to imagine Welles would have been so cavalier about a film he eventually claimed to care so much about. The only explanation that seems to make sense is that he didn’t know just how dire the situation was — how thorough were the edits being imposed on his work, or how serious RKO was about going through with them. He never did forgive Wise.\n\nBut another anecdote of Wise’s brings us back to our ironical theme of the way technology affected the completion of the picture, except this time it’s about transportation itself. Wise was able to meet with Welles, briefly, in Miami, to go over a three-hour rough cut. Together they sculpted that rough cut into something Welles could apparently live with. They had plans to work on it some more in Brazil, but shortly after that is when word came that Wise could not get authorization to travel there. “[T]he last I saw of Orson for many, many years is when I saw him off on one of those old flying boats that flew down to South America one morning.”"
