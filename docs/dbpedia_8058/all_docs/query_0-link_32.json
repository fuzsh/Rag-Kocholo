She also contributed to many other protocols, such as link-state routing.\n\n[Source: Internet Hall of Fame]\n\n#1. Grace Murray Hopper (1906-1992): One of The First Computer Software Programmers in The World\n\nWhat makes Grace Hopper famous?\n\nGrace Hopper was a computer scientist who served as US Navy rear admiral. She was born in 1906 in New York City and graduated with a master’s degree from Yale University.\n\nHopper joined the US Navy in 1943, where she became involved with programming computers during World War II. She programmed the Harvard Mark 1 computer used during this period. As one of the best computer programmers of her time, Hopper also helped create a link editor so people could work on multiple computers simultaneously.\n\nGrace Hopper is well-known for being one of the first women in the United States to receive this position and for what she achieved in her career.\n\nShe developed FORTRAN and COBOL, important programming languages.\n\nShe received the National Medal of Technology and the Presidential Medal of Freedom and had a military vessel, the USS Hopper, named after her.\n\nWhat’s the best Grace Hopper quote?\n\n“A ship in port is safe, but that’s not what ships are built for?”\n\n[Source: Encyclopedia Britannica]\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nAt first, we were a little hesitant to write this article. However, after some research, we decided to look at the facts. We discovered that there had been famous female computer scientists throughout history who did incredible things for our planet.\n\nThey gave birth to concepts and devices that have changed humanity for the better—and we need more people like them. Where did you think we would be without the efforts of these female computer scientists?\n\nWhat did you think of this list? Did we miss anyone? Let us know in the comments below."
