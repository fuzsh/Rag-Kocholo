        "text": "\"I went to college at UC Berkeley. I had always been interested in math and science and ended up with a major in math and a minor in physics.When I graduated in 1961 I decided I wasn't ready to go to graduate school. Instead I decided to move to Boston, where my father came from, and look for a job. I wasn't able to find anything interesting in math, but I was offered a job as a programmer. I knew nothing about computers; in fact I didn't even know there were computers. But that didn't prevent me from getting a job offer; at that point there were no computer science majors, so companies were hiring untrained people like me if they thought they could do the work.My first day on the job I was handed a Fortran manual and asked to write a program; I forget what the program was supposed to do. I discovered the work was very interesting and I was good at it. I think what was especially appealing to me was the combination of math and engineering: abstract reasoning and making things work. And thus started my career in Computer Science.\n\nAfter a year at my first job, I switched to work at Harvard, where I was in charge of maintaining a very large program that was being used in a language translation research project. This program was written in machine language, which gave me a chance to learn the details of what the hardware was doing.During the fall of 1962 I applied to graduate school. At that point I was entirely self taught and I thought I could learn a lot faster in a graduate program. I was accepted at Stanford where they didn't yet have a computer science major; the department came into existence a couple of years after I arrived.I did my PhD thesis in AI, working with John McCarthy. I knew part way through my graduate studies that I wanted to switch to computer systems but I decided to stick with AI for the time being, since that was the fastest way to complete my thesis.\n\nWhen I finished my PhD in 1968, I wasn't able to find a good job as a faculty member, so I returned to Mitre, the company where I had my first job, but this time as a researcher. All my research at Mitre was in computer systems, including work in machine architecture, operating systems, and programming methodology.In 1971 a paper I wrote on my operating system work was one of the prize papers at SOSP, the premiere conference in systems. As a result of that paper, and the talk I gave on the work, I was invited to apply for a faculty position at MIT. By then, conditions were changing and MIT was looking for women.\n\nWhen I joined MIT in the fall of 1972, there were about 900 faculty members but only 10 were women. I was the first woman in computer science and the second in my department.When I look back on my career what I see is a random walk where doors opened and closed. I couldn't get a job as a mathematician, but that led me to computer science. Later I couldn't get a job as a faculty member but that gave me the freedom to switch into computer systems. Plus as I decided what step to take next, I was paying attention to what I was good at and what I enjoyed. Both properties are important if you're going to have a happy and successful career.\""
