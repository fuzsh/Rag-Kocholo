        "text": "Major computer events in 1958\n\nThe integrated circuit developed by Robert Noyce of Fairchild Semiconductor and Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments was first demonstrated on September 12, 1958.\n\nNew computer products and services introduced in 1958\n\nControl Data Corporation introduced the Seymour Cray's 1604 for $1.5 million, half the cost of the IBM computer.\n\nNEC released its first computer, the NEAC 1101.\n\nWilliam Higinbotham created the first video game called: Tennis for Two.\n\nALGOL (ALGOrithmic Language) 58 was introduced in 1958.\n\nJohn McCarthy introduced LISP (LISt Processor) in 1958.\n\nWilliam Higinbotham credited with creating one of the first computer games, Tennis for Two (Like Pong). He created it on an Oscilloscope in 1958 to entertain visitors during visitor days at the national laboratory.\n\nIBM introduced the 632 Electronic Typing Calculator for card output.\n\nIBM introduced the 7070 intermediate data processing system.\n\nIBM introduced the IBM 7090 high-capacity computer.\n\nComputer and technology-related events in 1958\n\nThe Russian satellite Sputnik burned up as it reentered Earth's atmosphere on January 4, 1958.\n\nThe programming language FORTRAN (Formula Translation) II was created. Later, FORTRAN III was created but never released to the public.\n\nThe initial installation of SAGE, the first U.S. large-scale computer air defense network, was declared operational.\n\nPresident Eisenhower's Christmas address was the first voice transmission from a satellite.\n\nDr. Leo Esaki, an IBM Fellow, discovered the phenomenon of electron tunneling. He'd later win a Nobel Prize for this discovery in 1973. His discovery of the semiconductor junction called the Esaki diode finds wide use in electronics applications. More importantly, his work in semiconductors lays a foundation for further exploration of the electronic transport of solids.\n\nComputer companies and organizations founded in 1958\n\nJEDEC (Joint Electron Device Engineering Council) was founded in 1958.\n\nKeltec was founded in 1958.\n\nGoldStar was founded in 1958. The company became LG Electronics.\n\nComputer company events in 1958\n\nHewlett-Packard got into the plotter and printing business after making its first acquisition and acquiring FL Moseley Company in 1958.\n\nThe National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics was renamed to NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) in 1958.\n\nIBM sold the Time Equipment Division to Simplex Time Recorder Co., exiting one of its original lines of business.\n\nComputer pioneers born in 1958\n\nJeffrey Raikes was born on May 29, 1958.\n\nMark Cuban was born on July 31, 1958.\n\nSergio Verdu was born on August 15, 1958.\n\nSteve Case was born on August 21, 1958.\n\nMartin Odersky was born on September 5, 1958.\n\nCher Wang was born on September 14, 1958.\n\nUrsula Burns was born on September 20, 1958.\n\nNeil deGrasse Tyson was born on October 5, 1958.\n\nMichael Muuss was born on October 16, 1958.\n\nPhil Farrand was born on November 5, 1958.\n\nDon Libes was born in 1958.\n\nShafi Goldwasser was born in 1958.\n\nValerie Landau was born in 1958.\n\nComputer pioneer deaths in 1958\n\nClair Lake passed away in 1958 (Age: 70)."
