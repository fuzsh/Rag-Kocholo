        "text": "Leveraging a phrase from the #TBOY podcast, “Guac is always extra,” I reflect on Brian Niccol’s remarkable leadership at Chipotle. Under his guidance, the company’s market value soared from $9 billion to over $75 billion. This growth was not just in market value but also in sales and brand trust, a significant turnaround from the E. coli crisis in 2015. Now, Niccol is set to apply his transformative expertise to another company in need of a ‘rescue.’\n\nMental wellness is the secret formula for sustainable success. I stumbled upon a quote today that resonated deeply with me, and I felt compelled to share it in hopes that it might be as impactful for others as it has been for me: \"You will continue to suffer if you have an emotional reaction to everything that is said to you. True power is sitting back and observing things with logic. True power is restraint. If words control you that means everyone else can control you\"\n\nNice marketing. Rovo is promising, especially with all their integrations to other ecosystems such as Microsoft, Figma, Slack, GitHub, Zephyr, and LaunchDarkly. A solid statement, Atlassian: \"Rovo helps your teams find information across all their selected SaaS apps, learn and iterate on knowledge as they work, and act faster with virtual agents.\" I can't wait to experiment with it, especially to generate more robust and integrated backlogs in JIRA. Has someone used it?\n\nIt is okay to not have all the answers... In the dynamic world of Product Development, we often find ourselves expected to have all the answers to a specific domain or topic. However, I’ve discovered that sometimes, the most empowering phrase we can utter is, “I don’t know, tell me more...” Admitting that we don’t have all the answers is healthy, especially in key positions. When we say “I don’t know,” we’re not displaying weakness or incompetence. Instead, we’re acknowledging that we’re embarking on a journey of discovery. We’re inviting our teams to join us on that journey and to collaboratively find creative solutions. The journey becomes even more productive when we apply our known experience, best practices, processes, and standards to the newly acquired knowledge. Not knowing is acceptable; not wanting to know is not.\n\nI’ve been closely monitoring Abercrombie & Fitch’s stock performance, and it’s impressive to witness its consistent ascent. While the A&F Wedding Shop has undoubtedly contributed to this success, it’s the brand’s strategic pivot that truly captures my attention. Abercrombie has undergone a remarkable transformation, shifting its focus to an older demographic and embracing inclusivity, which has resonated well with consumers. It’s inspiring to see a company thrive through robust market validation and product development that’s deeply rooted in understanding user needs. As A&F CEO Franz Horowitz puts it, “Getting close to the customer and understanding what they are looking for is the win. Put out there great product, fashion and an equation that they are excited about. They’re willing to spend.” This approach is a testament to the power of identifying and addressing pervasive customer problems with solutions they value and are willing to pay for. The result? A staggering 102% growth YTD in their stock. Abercrombie’s journey is a prime example of how intentional business strategy and customer-centric product definitions can lead to remarkable outcomes.\n\nAs a recently appointed permanent resident of the United States, I’ve embarked on a journey through the history of the Founding Fathers and the enduring principles they championed. Inspired by their vision, I’ve sought to draw parallels between these principles and the creation of successful digital products and share them with you all: - Innovation: Just as the Founding Fathers laid the groundwork for a new nation, we must lay the foundation for products that push the boundaries of what’s possible. - Excellence: They pursued excellence in every endeavor, a standard we should mirror in our product quality and user experience. - Collaboration: Their collaborative spirit enabled great achievements, reminding us to foster teamwork and collective problem-solving in our projects. - Integrity: Upholding the highest ethical standards, as they did, ensures our products respect user privacy and provide true value. - Adaptability: Embracing change and remaining flexible allows us to evolve our products to meet future challenges and opportunities. - Long-term Vision: The Founding Fathers had a long-term perspective; similarly, we should develop products with a sustainable future in mind. By integrating these timeless principles, we can build digital products that not only satisfy current market and user demands but also possess the resilience to endure, much like the legacy of the Founding Fathers. Happy 4th of July, from a proud Mexican who has found his place in Arizona.\n\n\"To win, you have to lose. To be successful, you've got to have something that’s not successful. To be happy, you have to have disappointment. All of those things have evolved & happened to make me who I am.\" - The one with the number 23 (and briefly 45)"
