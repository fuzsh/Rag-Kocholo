I was planning to be a Math teacher, but in 1965 (the summer before my senior year), I was arrested in a civil rights sit-in, and was not allowed to do my student teaching because the Houston Unified School District and the University of Houston did not believe that people with arrest records should be allowed into the student teaching program. So in my senior year I took a computer programming course, and when I graduated I got a programming job at Texaco. When I had my first child (in 1969) I quit the job at Texaco, but was too bored just taking care of a baby at home, and enrolled in the MS program in CS at the University of Houston. I fell in love with research...so at the age of 29 and by that time a single parent of two small children, I entered the PhD program at UC Berkeley. While at UCB I was a co-founder (along with Barbara Simons & Sheila Humphreys) of the UCB Re-entry program, a program to help women and other under-represented groups obtain the backgrounds they need to successfully enter a CS graduate program. I graduated with my PhD in 1979.\n\nSince then I have held various research and management positions. I am currently the Vice-President of Engineering at Illustra, a database system company. Previous to this, I was manager of the operating systems research department at Hewlett Packard Laboratories; before that, Vice-President of Software Engineering, ShareBase (formerly Britton-Lee), a database machine company.\"\n\ne-mail: paula@illustra.com\n\nProf. Mary Hayes\n\nAssistant Professor, Math/CS Dept., Mercer County Community College, Trenton, NJ\n\nM.S., C.S. 1985, Monmouth College\n\nMary Hayes is an Assistant Professor in the Math/CS Department at Mercer County Community College in Trenton, NJ.

John\n\nAssistant Professor, Departments of Computer Science and Psychology and Human-Computer Interaction Institute, Carnegie Mellon University\n\nPh.D., Psychology, 1988, Carnegie Mellon University\n\nBonnie John has an engineering background (BEngr, 1977, The Cooper Union; MS, 1978, Stanford University) and direct experience with the inadequacy of psychology to really help in the design of computer interfaces (designing tele- and data-communication systems at Bell Laboratories, 1978-1983). With a strong desire to beat psychology into a useful shape, she obtained a Ph.D. in cognitive psychology (Carnegie Mellon, 1988). Her thesis work developed models of immediate response behavior (e.g., choice Reaction Time tasks and Stimulus-Response compatibility) and of expert transcription typing, involving aspects of perceptual, cognitive and motor behavior. This work has continued, spanning the range from quite theoretical (Soar models of learning and memory) to absolutely applied (evaluating telephone operator workstations with GOMS).\n\nBonnie E.

She received both her Ph.D. (1977) and B.Sc. (1973) in Mathematics from the University of Alberta. Becoming interested in computer science, Maria joined the department at the University of Toronto as a graduate student (1978) and then as an assistant professor (1979). In 1980, Maria married Nick Pippenger, and they moved to California to join the new 'theory group' at what is now the IBM Almaden Research Center. During eight years at IBM, Maria's primary goal was to stimulate interaction between the computer science and mathematics communities. She created a discrete mathematics group, and managed this as well as a department containing several computer science groups with strong ties to mathematics. She led the creation of SIAM's activity group and journal in discrete mathematics. Her own research focused on problems in computer science involving discrete mathematics, yielding results in circuit complexity, data-structures, computational geometry, distributed algorithms, and circuit layout. Her best known contributions from this period are in matrix searching, a group of techniques used to provide fast algorithms for a broad range of problems in computational geometry, operations research and protein sequencing. While at IBM, Maria and Nick had two children, now 12 and 9, a boy, Janek, and a girl, Sasha.\n\nIn 1988, Maria and Nick joined the University of British Columbia. Maria's mandate as Professor and Head of the Department of Computer Science was to build one of the world's best departments. During her first term as Head, the department more than doubled in all respects including the recruitment of 17 new faculty. Maria's second term as Head started in 1993. Recently, Maria created E-GEMS, an international consortium of scientists, education researchers, teachers and game designers, whose goal is to understand how to build electronic learning environments that encourage and help children (especially girls) learn math and science. The partners in the E-GEMS project include, in addition to researchers in computer science and education at UBC, Electronic Arts, Queen's university, Science World, Apple Canada, and several schools. The Vancouver schools include Kerrisdale, Trafalgar and University Hill elementary schools. The first E-GEMS commercial product, a math CD-ROM game called Counting on Frank, was released in October 94.\n\nMaria continues to serve on many scientific boards and advisory councils, including as Vice-Chair of the Board of the Computing Research Association, as a Trustee of the American Mathematical Society, and on the Premier's Advisory Council on Science and Technology. Last, but not least, Maria is a dedicated artist, long distance runner, and ocean kayaker.\n\nDr. Susan Landau\n\nResearch Associate Professor, University of Massachusetts\n\nPh.D. 1983, MIT\n\nDr. Landau's main interest is in algorithms, particularly those of an algebraic flavor. Her Ph.D. was a polynomial time algorithm for determining solvability by radicals; the previous best algorithm was exponential time. She also gave a polynomial time algorithm for the problem of polynomial factorization over algebraic number fields. She has worked on algorithms for polynomial decomposition, again improving the work from exponential to polynomial time. This algorithm, joint with Dexter Kozen, is implemented in the symbolic computation system AXIOM. It also showed that cryptography schemes based on polynomial composition were insecure. More recently Dr. Landau has worked on nested radicals; she has provided the first general results on the problems of denesting.\n\nDr. Landau has also worked on lower bounds for various algebraic problems. Some of her research is in computational geometry: finding embeddings of linkages in integer lattices, and ``shrinking'' polyhedrons. These latter problems find applications in robotics.\n\nDr. Landau has interests in cryptography. She has worked in the complexity of various number theoretic problems, including computing ``square-freeness.'' She has written several articles for the Notices of the American Mathematical Society (AMS) on cryptography, and she is co-author on the ACM report ``Codes, Keys, and Conflicts: Issues in U.S. Crypto Policy.''\n\nShe has served on the NRC Evaluation Panel for NSF Graduate Fellowships (1987-89, chair, 1989), and on NSF panels for Scientific Computing Equipment in the Mathematical Sciences (1987), and for PYI grants (1990).
