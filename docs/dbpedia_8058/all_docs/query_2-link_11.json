        "text": "Like many women tech professionals of her generation, Barbara Bluestein Simons, the first woman to become a UC Berkeley Distinguished Engineering Alumni, took an indirect route to a career in computer science. She got married at the end of her sophomore year at Berkeley and dropped out as a junior, in 1961, to become a wife and mother full-time for nine years. At the age of 30, she returned to Stony Brook University in New York as a part-time undergraduate and, without completing her Bachelor’s, earned a Master’s degree in CS. When she transferred to the graduate program at Berkeley, she brought with her a wealth of practical experience which she applied to the challenges of attracting more women to the fields of EE and CS. She co-founded the student organization Women in Computer Science and Engineering (WiCSE) and the CS Reentry Program for women and minorities (along with fellow “firsts” Paula Hawthorn and Susan Eggers). She also embarked upon an influential career guiding U.S. government policy on technology.\n\nSimons earned her Ph.D. in 1981 under the supervision of Richard Karp, focusing on compiler optimization, scheduling theory, and algorithm analysis and design. She spent her early career working as an IBM researcher and founded ACM’s US Public Policy Committee (USACM) in 1993. She retired from IBM to serve as President of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), the nation’s largest educational and scientific computing society. She has been advocating to end electronic voting since 2002, which she says is poorly designed and easy to exploit, and has been a member of national workshops and government projects studying the issue. She currently serves as a Board Chair of the Verified Voting Foundation, a non-partisan and non-profit organization that advocates for legislation to promote safe and transparent voting.\n\nLearn more about Barbara from her 2002 oral history and a 2017 article about her in The Atlantic.\n\nDeborah Estrin earned her B.S. in EECS from Berkeley in 1980 and her Ph.D. from MIT in 1985. She is a highly influential researcher who is known for her work on sensor networks, mobile health, and small data, and is a pioneer in the development of embedded networked sensing (ENS). She is also the first Association for Computing Machinery ACM-W Athena Lecturer ever (2006), an honor which recognizes “outstanding women researchers who have made fundamental contributions to computer science.”\n\nEstrin’s research focuses on novel techniques for chronic disease management using smartphone data capture and analytics. She was a professor at both USC and UCLA, and was the founding director of the NSF-funded Center for Embedded Networked Sensing (CENS). In 2012, she was the first academic hired to work at Cornell Tech in New York City, where she is currently the Associate Dean for Impact and the Robert V. Tishman ’37 Professor of Computer Science. She co-founded a non-profit called Open mHealth, which creates open data sharing standards and tools that allow developers of health applications to store, process, and visualize data.\n\nLearn more about Debora in the Encyclopedia of World Biography."
