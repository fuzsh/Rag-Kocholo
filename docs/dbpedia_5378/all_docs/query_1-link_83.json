This damage can lead to it being weaker and less efficient, and ultimately to major\n\nheart problems. There are some drugs currently available which help prevent remodelling and\n\nare used for treatment post-MI. However, there is still a high rate of remodelling and major\n\nheart problems in people post-MI. NP202 works in a different way to the drugs that are\n\ncurrently approved, and has been shown in animal studies to prevent post-MI remodelling.\n\nThis study will assess NP202 versus placebo on remodelling over a 3 month treatment period,\n\nwith 1 month follow up\n\nTreatments and/or Procedures\n\nNP 202\n\nActive\n\nPlacebo\n\nPlacebo\n\nOutcome Measures\n\nOutcome measures are the tests that investigators perform to prove whether or not a treatment being tested in a clinical trial is having any effect.\n\nPrimary\n\nEfficacy as measured by Change from baseline in left ventricular end systolic volume index (LVESVi)\n\nChange from baseline in left ventricular end systolic volume index (LVESVi) as assessed by MRI at 3 months\n\nSecondary\n\nEfficacy as measured by Change from baseline in relative infarct size\n\nChange from baseline in relative infarct size as a percent of LV mass as assessed by late contrast enhancement MRI at 3 months.\n\nSecondary\n\nEfficacy as measured by Change from baseline in LV diastolic function\n\nChanges from baseline in LV diastolic function based on LV peak filling rate as assessed by MRI at 3 months.\n\nSecondary\n\nEfficacy as measured by Change from baseline in LV ejection fraction (LVEF)\n\nChange from baseline in LVEF as assessed by MRI at 3 months.\n\nSecondary\n\nEfficacy as measured by Change from baseline in LV end diastolic volume index (LVEDVi)\n\nChange from baseline in LV end diastolic volume index (LVEDVi) as assessed by MRI at 3 months.\n\nOther\n\nEfficacy as assessed by laboratory biomarkers\n\nAbsolute values and changes from baseline in serum biomarker levels (Troponin I, Troponin T, high sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP) and N-terminal of the prohormone brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)\n\nOther\n\nTrough levels of NP202 in plasma\n\nConcentrations of NP202 in plasma in a subset of 30 subjects.\n\nOther\n\nSafety as assessed by changes in 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs).\n\nChanges in ECG intervals\n\nOther\n\nSafety as assessed by changes in physical examination\n\nChanges in physical examination finding including vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature)\n\nOther\n\nSafety as assessed by occurrence of adverse events (AE)\n\nAll AE occurring during the study will be recorded\n\nOther\n\nSafety as assessed by changes in laboratory results\n\nBiochemistry, haematology, prostate specific antigen (PSA), urinalysis"
