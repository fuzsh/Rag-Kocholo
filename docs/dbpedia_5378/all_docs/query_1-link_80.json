[more]\n\nDrawing inspiration from the natural process of photosynthesis found in plant leaves, scientists are exploring the use of photocatalysis to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) into valuable products using solar light and water. Photocatalytic CO2 conversion has emerged as one of the efficient green approaches to revitalize the environment from greenhouse gas pollution. Owing to its visible-range band gap, non-toxicity, ease of synthesis at economic costs and stability under light irradiation, g-C3N4 has emerged as the most explored photocatalyst. However, due to rampant exciton recombination owing to poor electrical conductivity, the efficiency of CO2 reduction falls short for g-C3N4 in its pure/pristine form. Therefore, the structural engineering of g-C3N4 materials using N-rich configurations, heteroatom/single-atom doping, and hybridization with various functional materials including metal oxides/sulfides, perovskite halides and metal complexes has been adopted, thereby overcoming their inherent drawbacks in photocatalytic CO2 reduction. In this timely review, we present an overview of the recent advances in surface/interface engineering of carbon nitrides for the conversion of CO2 to fuels and useful chemical by-products. More importance is given to the critical evaluation of surface manipulation in carbon nitrides and how it amplifies and affect their photocatalytic properties in CO2 reduction. Finally, we provide a comprehensive outlook into the future directions of these functionalised carbon nitrides for various applications. We strongly believe that this unique review will offer new knowledge on the surface property relationship of carbon nitride-based materials and their impact on enhancing their performance in photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction and further create new opportunities for them in various areas.\n\nNova 2024 Chahal S, Bhushan R, Kumari P, Guan X, Lee JM, Ray SJ, et al., 'Microwave nanoarchitectonics of black phosphorene for energy storage', Matter, 7 237-254 (2024) [C1]\n\nXenes are increasingly pivotal in various applications; particularly, black phosphorene (BP) has recently drawn profuse attention for its tremendous potential in electronics, spin...

However, its direct synthesis via bottom-up approaches remains elusive, largely burdened by cumbersome chemistry protocols. Herein, we report a novel large-scale, solution-phase synthesis approach of BP, in which concentrated orthophosphoric acid quickly turns to BP when exposed to microwave irradiation (~800 W, cumulative ~10 min consisting of 20 s pulses). While graphene/BP and MoS2/BP heterolayers exhibit metallic and diodic behaviors, respectively, graphene/boron nitride/BP sandwich device displays excellent tunneling (~20 mA). Interestingly, MoS2-BP hybrid delivers a capacitance of 1,698.8 F g-1, whereas graphene-BP exhibits a larger volumetric current density and a high capacitance of 2,863.5 F g-1 with sustainable reversibility, high load, and high rate capability up to 50 mV s-1.

Detection of heavy metal ions by photoluminescence quenching attracts significant attention. This study demonstrates the synthesis of fluorine-doped triazole-based g-C3N5 quantum dots (FQDs) with reduced photoluminescence emission intensities and enhanced excited charge lifetimes. The excited electrons of these FQDs are withdrawn by fluorine ions with high electronegativity, thereby inhibiting photoluminescence emission. FQDs are used for the detection of Fe2+, Fe3+, and Hg2+ ions through photoluminescence (PL) quenching, and the excited electrons are transferred between the F-doped QDs and these transition metal ions, reducing the PL emission. The LOD (limit of detection) values of Fe2+ and Hg2+ ions for CNQD were 0.423 and 0.438 ppm, respectively, whereas 3FQD exhibited an LOD value of 0.262 ppm for Fe2+, and 10FQD had an LOD value of 0.218 ppm for Hg2+ ions. Computational calculations suggest that the divalent cations contribute considerably to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of C3N5-Fe2+, C3N5-Zn2+, and C3N5¿Hg2+, and the low-lying excitations of these C3N5-M2+ (M = Fe and Hg) complexes show strong charge transfer features. Most of the excited electrons are situated around the Fe2+ and Hg2+ ions in the C3N5-Fe2+ and C3N5¿Hg2+ complexes. As a result, Fe2+ and Hg2+ ions induce extensive PL quenching of the triazole-based C3N5 QDs.\n\nNova 2024 Britto JSJ, Guan X, Tran TKA, Lei Z, Bahadur R, Patel V, et al., 'Emerging Multifunctional Carbon-Nanomaterial-Based Biosensors for Cancer Diagnosis', Small Science, 4 (2024) [C1]\n\nDespite significant advancements in medical technology, cancer remains the world&apos;s second-leading cause of death, largely attributed to late-stage diagnoses.

While traditional cancer detection methodologies offer foundational insights, they often lack the specificity, affordability, and sensitivity for early-stage identification. In this context, the development of biosensors offers a distinct possibility for the precise and rapid identification of cancer biomarkers. Carbon nanomaterials, including graphene, carbon nitride, carbon quantum dots, and other carbon-based nanostructures, are highly promising for cancer detection. Their simplicity, high sensitivity, and cost-effectiveness contribute to their potential in this field. This review aims to elucidate the potential of emerging carbon-nanomaterial-based biosensors for early cancer diagnosis. The relevance of the various biosensor mechanisms and their performance to the physicochemical properties of carbon nanomaterials is discussed in depth, focusing on demonstrating broad methodologies for creating performance biosensors. Diverse carbon-nanomaterial-based detection techniques, such as electrochemical, fluorescence, surface plasmon resonance, electrochemiluminescence, and quartz crystal microbalance, are emphasized for early cancer detection. At last, a summary of existing challenges and future outlook in this promising field is elaborated.\n\nNova 2024 Li Z, Guan X, Pandey G, Chahal S, Bandyopadhyay A, Awasthi K, et al., 'Microwave Doping of Sulfur and Iron in ß\n\nBorophene, a 2D material exhibiting unique crystallographic phases like the anisotropic atomic lattices of ß12 and X3 phases, has attracted considerable attention due to its intri... [more]\n\nBorophene, a 2D material exhibiting unique crystallographic phases like the anisotropic atomic lattices of ß12 and X3 phases, has attracted considerable attention due to its intriguing Dirac nature and metallic attributes. Despite surpassing graphene in electronic mobility, borophene's potential in energy storage and catalysis remains untapped due to its inherent electrochemical and catalytic limitations. Elemental doping emerges as a promising strategy to introduce charge carriers, enabling localized electrochemical and catalytic functionalities. However, effective doping of borophene has been a complex and underexplored challenge. Here, an innovative, one-pot microwave-assisted doping method, tailored for the ß12 phase of borophene is introduced. By subjecting dispersed ß12 borophene in dimethylformamide to controlled microwave exposure with sulfur powder and FeCl3 as doping precursors, S- and Fe doping in borophene can be controlled. Employing advanced techniques including high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, confirm successful sulfur and iron dopant incorporation onto ß12 borophene is confirmed, achieving doping levels of up to 11 % and 13 %, respectively. Remarkably, S- and Fe-doped borophene exhibit exceptional supercapacitive behavior, with specific capacitances of 202 and 120¿F¿g-1, respectively, at a moderate current density of 0.25¿A¿g-1.\n\n2024 Kumar P, Singh G, Guan X, Roy S, Lee J, Kim IY, et al., 'The Rise of Xene Hybrids.', Adv Mater, 36 e2403881 (2024) [C1] 2024 Guan X, Zhang X, Li Z, Deshpande S, Fawaz M, Dharmarajan NP, et al., 'Sulfoxide-Functional Nanoarchitectonics of Mesoporous Sulfur-Doped C\n\nWhile carbon nitrides have emerged as leading materials in photocatalysis over the past two decades, innovative and facile approaches for porosity engineering (to enhance effectiv...

We herein report the first synthesis of mesoporous sulfur-doped C3N5 (mesoporous sulfur-doped carbon nitrides (MSCNs)) with sulfoxide-functionalization via pyrolysis of 5-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-thiol, utilizing nanoporous silica templates with 2D and 3D porous structures (KIT-6 and SBA-15). Morphological and physicochemical properties of MSCNs have been systematically evaluated. We demonstrate that highly ordered mesoporous structural features with high effective surface areas, sulfur doping, and generated defects significantly dampen exciton recombination. In addition, adequate doping and functionalization yielding a sufficient number of catalytically active sites constitute the favorable set of conditions, eventually resulting in a remarkable hydrogen generation rate of 1370 µmol g-1 h-1 and effective pollutant remediation (>97% degradation rate in 150 min). Spectroscopic investigations and density functional theory calculations reveal that the sulfoxide functionalities generate efficient charge-transfer pathways on the catalyst¿s surface, thereby catalyzing the reaction and impeding charge carrier recombination. The implications of this research offer insights into the development of surface/interface engineering and atomistic doping for enhanced photocatalysis, which will inspire superior futuristic catalytic design.\n\nNova 2024 Bahadur R, Singh G, Li Z, Singh B, Srivastava R, Sakamoto Y, et al., 'Hybrid nanoarchitectonics of ordered mesoporous C60 BCN with high surface area for supercapacitors and lithium-ion batteries', Carbon, 216 118568-118568 (2024) [C1] Nova 2024 Bahadur R, Wijerathne B, Vinu A, 'Multiple Heteroatom Doped Nanoporous Biocarbon for Supercapacitor and Zinc-ion Capacitor.', ChemSusChem, e202400999 (2024) [C1] 2024 Dharmarajan NP, Fawaz M, Sathish C, Talapaneni SN, Ramadass K, Sadanandan AM, et al., 'Insights into Atomic Level p-Electron Modulations in Supramolecular Carbon Nitride Nanoarchitectonics for Sustainable Green Hydrogen Production', ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS, 14 (2024) [C1] 2024 George NS, Singh G, Bahadur R, Kumar P, Ramadass K, Sathish CI, et al., 'Recent Advances in Functionalized Biomass-Derived Porous Carbons and their Composites for Hybrid Ion Capacitors', Advanced Science, (2024) [C1]\n\nHybrid ion capacitors (HICs) have aroused extreme interest due to their combined characteristics of energy and power densities.

The performance of HICs lies hidden in the electrode materials used for the construction of battery and supercapacitor components. The hunt is always on to locate the best material in terms of cost-effectiveness and overall optimized performance characteristics. Functionalized biomass-derived porous carbons (FBPCs) possess exquisite features including easy synthesis, wide availability, high surface area, large pore volume, tunable pore size, surface functional groups, a wide range of morphologies, and high thermal and chemical stability. FBPCs have found immense use as cathode, anode and dual electrode materials for HICs in the recent literature. The current review is designed around two main concepts which include the synthesis and properties of FBPCs followed by their utilization in various types of HICs. Among monovalent HICs, lithium, sodium, and potassium, are given comprehensive attention, whereas zinc is the only multivalent HIC that is focused upon due to corresponding literature availability. Special attention is also provided to the critical factors that govern the performance of HICs. The review concludes by providing feasible directions for future research in various aspects of FBPCs and their utilization in HICs.\n\n2024 Ali S, Ismail PM, Khan M, Dang A, Ali S, Zada A, et al., 'Charge transfer in TiO2-based photocatalysis: fundamental mechanisms to material strategies.', Nanoscale, 16 4352-4377 (2024) [C1] Nova 2024 Davidraj JM, Sathish CI, Selvarajan P, Fawaz M, Perumalsamy V, Yu X, et al., 'Aminotriazine derived N-doped mesoporous carbon with a tunable nitrogen content and their improved oxygen reduction reaction performance', NANOSCALE, [C1] 2024 Davidraj JM, Sathish CI, Benzigar MR, Li Z, Zhang X, Bahadur R, et al., 'Recent advances in food waste-derived nanoporous carbon for energy storage.', Sci Technol Adv Mater, 25 2357062 (2024) [C1] Nova 2024 Chahal S, Sahay T, Li Z, Sharma RK, Kumari E, Bandyopadhyay A, et al., 'Graphene via Microwave Expansion of Graphite Followed by Cryo-Quenching and its Application in Electrostatic Droplet Switching.', Small, e2404337 (2024) [C1] 2024 Ruban AM, Singh G, Bahadur R, Sathish CI, Vinu A, 'Almond skin derived porous biocarbon nanoarchitectonics with tunable micro and mesoporosity for CO\n\nThe careful selection of carbon precursors for chemical activation is critical in obtaining cost-effective and efficient porous activated biocarbons with multifunctional propertie...

These excellent features allowed ASPC5-4 to adsorb a record amount of CO2 at 0 °C/30 bar (39.81 mmol g-1). Another material ASPC5-2 exhibited a high content of micropores and adsorbed 5.92 mmol g-1 of CO2 at 0 °C/1 bar.

Herein, we report on the temperature-controlled synthesis of ordered N-rich mesoporous carbon nitrides (MCNs) via pyrolysis of aminoguanidine by using SBA-15 as a hard template. The properties and the nitrogen content of the materials were tuned by varying the carbonization temperature in the range of 350¿500 °C. At 350 and 400 °C, higher amounts of N could be retained in the MCN framework with the predominant formation of C3N6 having a six-membered aromatic ring with diamino-s-tetrazine moiety, whereas C3N5 with 1-amino/imino-1,2,4-triazole moieties was produced at 450 and 500 °C. The base catalytic activity of MCNs in Knoevenagel condensation of benzaldehyde with malononitrile revealed that the MCN-400 exhibited the highest catalytic performance by displaying a 96.4 % product yield with toluene as a solvent. The superior catalytic activity of MCN-400 is attributed to high N content (62.6 wt%), high surface area (235 m2 g-1), and large pore volume (0.74 cm3 g-1). The optimum temperature for obtaining the highest yield of the products is 80 °C, and the catalyst showed good cycling stability for 5 consecutive cycles.\n\n2023 Ahmed S, Murmu PP, Sathish CI, Guan X, Geng R, Bao N, et al., 'Co- and Nd-Codoping-Induced High Magnetization in Layered MoS\n\nMagnetic 2D-layered materials are promising for the applications of spintronic devices and compact magnetic devices.

There are only a few reported intrinsic 2D-based magnetic materials. Therefore, introducing magnetic element into 2D-layered materials is an effective strategy to synthesize 2D-layered magnetic materials. Recently, ferromagnetism has been realized by doping single transition-metal or rare-earth element, whereas, there is no report by codoping of both transition-metal and rare-earth elements. Herein, Co and Nd are codoped into MoS2-layered crystals by ion implantation. An extremely high magnetization of 6916.3 emu cm-3 at 10 K and 80.3 emu cm-3 at 300 K is achieved. The high magnetization is attributed to the contribution from both transition-metal and rare-earth elements as well as defects, such as vacancy of cation ions, anions, or interstitials.

Zinc(Zn)¿ion incorporation is shown to play an important role in promoting bone regeneration and also providing antimicrobial activity to the scaffold materials. In this work, the role of pore size, geometry, and ordered structure on the Zn loading and release performance of two different mesoporous silica, SBA-1 and SBA-15, are compared. Zn loading is varied from 2.5 to 10 wt% for both samples, and its effect on the antibacterial and osteogenic activity is evaluated. Zn loading up to 10 wt% has a negligible effect on the morphology and textural properties of the mesoporous silica samples. The inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis reveals that SBA-15 exhibits significantly higher Zn release in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth as compared to SBA-1 that is reflected in the higher antibacterial activity of SBA-15 against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Various assays show that 5 wt% Zn loading is sufficient to produce both bactericidal and inhibitory effects on bacterial cells. The 5 wt% Zn-loaded samples induce osteogenic differentiation ofavianized bone marow-derived stromal cells (TVA-BMSCs) though SBA-15 samples show better compatibility compared to SBA-1, suggesting that Zn incorporation can produce sufficient antibacterial effect and osteogenic differentiation of TVA-BMSCs.\n\nNova 2023 Ban S, Nie X, Lei Z, Yi J, Vinu A, Bao Y, Liu Y, 'Emerging low-dimensional materials for nanoelectromechanical systems resonators', MATERIALS RESEARCH LETTERS, 11 21-52 (2023) [C1] Nova 2023 Ding X, Cui X, Tseng L-T, Wang Y, Qu J, Yue Z, et al., 'Realization of High Magnetization in Artificially Designed Ni/NiO Layers through Exchange Coupling.', Small, e2304369 (2023) [C1] 2023 Guan X, Fawaz M, Sarkar R, Lin CH, Li Z, Lei Z, et al., 'S-doped C\n\nGraphitic carbon nitrides (g-C3N4) with unique physicochemical properties are promising candidates for photocatalysis applications.

However, pristine g-C3N4 often suffers from narrow absorption ranges and high carrier recombination rates, which result in mediocre catalytic performance. In this work, we prepare novel sulfur-doped high nitrogen containing carbon nitrides, C3N5 (SCNs), with a combined thiadiazole, triazole, and triazine framework by facile self-assembly of 5-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-thiol (5-ATDT). Their structural, morphological, and optical properties, and photocatalytic activities are investigated in detail. From density functional theory calculations and spectroscopic characterization studies, we construct thermodynamically stable molecular structures of SCNs composed of one triazole and two triazine moieties with small ratios of thiadiazole on the edge, in which the sulfur atoms are ionically connected with carbon/nitrogen atoms and gradually detached on increasing the calcination temperatures. Remarkably, the resultant SCNs exhibit a significantly enhanced H2-generation rate of 486 µmol g-1 h-1, about 60% higher than the average value derived from typical g-C3N4 synthesised by conventional precursors thanks to the enlarged light absorption range and enhanced charge carrier transfer rate. Our work provides a unique approach for designing novel sulfur-doped carbon nitrides with unprecedented functionalities.\n\nNova 2023 Patel V, Ramadass K, Morrison B, Britto JSJ, Lee JM, Mahasivam S, et al., 'Utilising the Nanozymatic Activity of Copper-Functionalised Mesoporous C3 N5 for Sensing Biomolecules.', Chemistry, 29 e202302723 (2023) [C1] Nova 2023 Shah R, Ali S, Raziq F, Ali S, Ismail PM, Shah S, et al., 'Exploration of metal organic frameworks and covalent organic frameworks for energy-related applications', Coordination Chemistry Reviews, 477 (2023) [C1]\n\nMetal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent-organic frameworks (COFs) are constituting two new classes of highly crystalline advanced permeable materials that have purchased sign...

However, the main hurdles to their various applications in photocatalytic activity and novel energy storage/conversion devices are their low structural stability and electrical conductivities. Therefore, substantial research has been directed to maximize their advantages and mitigate the shortcomings of these fascinating materials. In this review article, we first introduced the background and brief timeline of COF/MOF development and notable milestones followed by a systematic overview of the different synthetic procedures and recent achievements and milestones of their applications in CO2 reduction, hydrogen production, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), and supercapacitors (SCs).

[more]\n\nThe development of versatile mesoporous silica nanomaterials (MSNSs) with suitable textural properties is essential for the targeted and precise delivery of therapeutic drugs for the treatment of various diseases. Especially, loading of highly toxic platinum-based drugs is essential to reduce their toxic side effects. However, loading platinum-based drugs such as carboplatin in high quantity in porous materials is extremely challenging owing to the high hydrophobicity and lack of functional groups for interacting with surfaces of MSNS. In this study, we report a facile synthesis of core-shell MSNS by employing a unique combination of triple surfactants - pluronic P123, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and fluorocarbon-4 (FC-4) for targeted delivery of the carboplatin for the treatment of lung cancer. The highly hydrophobic FC-4 plays a vital role in tuning the self-assembly and thereby controls the size, morphology, textural properties and uniform pore size distribution of the MSNS. The optimised MSNS with the size range of 300¿320 nm, uniform size distribution, high surface area and ordered structure was successfully synthesised. A high drug loading of 26.7% was achieved on both bare and amine functionalised MSNS with a steady release of up to 60% and 37%, respectively, in PBS. The targeting efficiency of the folic acid functionalised particles was established by confocal microscopy, which showed higher cellular uptake of these particles in A549 cells. The high carboplatin loading and targeting ability resulted in high cytotoxicity from the folic acid functionalised and drug-loaded MSNS samples in PC9 cells compared to non-targeted and bare MSNS samples. Overall, this study proposes a new single-step synthesis of core-shell MSNS with high drug loading capacity that can be used to deliver drugs in treating different types of cancers.\n\nNova 2023 Tabish A, Ruban SM, Joseph S, Indirathankam SC, Bezingar M, Ramadass K, et al., 'The isopropylation of naphthalene over ordered mesoporous aluminosilicate AlSBA-1: The formation of diisopropylnaphthalene and triisopropylnaphthalene isomers', Molecular Catalysis, 547 (2023) [C1]\n\nWe report on the catalytic activity of ordered mesoporous aluminosilicate, AlSBA-1 with 3D cage type porous structure, in the isopropylation of naphthalene (NP).

The higher isopropylates: triisopropylnaphthalene (TriIPN) and tetraisopropylnaphthalene (TetIPN) isomers were formed over AlSBA-1 in addition to isopropylnaphthalene (IPN) and diisoprpylnaphthalene (DIPN) isomers. The higher isopropylates were started to form at 225 °C as primary products, which were produced by multi-step isopropylation from NP occurred during one stay on the catalytic site cooperated with the propene adsorbed neighbor acid sites. TriIPN isomers were composed of four isomers (1,3,7-. 1,3,5-, 1,3,6-, and 1,4,6-) formed from DIPN isomers. These formations of TriIPN isomers are controlled by the distribution of DIPN isomers. ß,ß-DIPN isomers lead to a,ß,ß-TriIPN isomers, and a,a-DIPN to a,a,ß-TriIPN, respectively. However, a,ß-DIPN isomers give both of a,a,ß- and a,ß,ß-TriIPN isomers depending on the reaction conditions. The distribution of TriIPN isomers is operated by their kinetic and thermodynamic properties. Bulky and unstable a,a,ß-TriIPN isomers (1,3,5- and 1,4,6-) were predominant at low temperatures, 175¿250 °C, and at low NP/Cat ratio at 250 °C, where the catalysis mainly proceeded under kinetic control. However, the formation of slim and stable a,ß,ß-TriIPN isomers (1,3,7- and 1,3,6-) increased with raising the temperatures, and was primary at 300 °C, where the catalysis occurred under thermodynamic control. From these results, it is concluded that the isopropylation of NP over AlSBA-1 occurs under kinetic and/or thermodynamically controls based on the reactivity of the reactants and the stability of the products, and no steric control concerns by mesopores.\n\nNova 2023 Geng X, Singh G, Sathish CI, Li Z, Bahadur R, Liu Y, et al., 'Biomass derived nanoarchitectonics of porous carbon with tunable oxygen functionalities and hierarchical structures and their superior performance in CO\n\nBiomass-derived nanoporous carbons (BNCs) are attractive materials for CO2 capture and energy storage due to their unique surface properties and the availability of low-cost and a...

However, the order of the carbon atoms, the nature of the porosity and surface functional groups are critical in dictating the performance of BNCs for such applications. Herein, a solid-phase activation strategy is introduced to prepare O-functionalized BNCs with embedded graphene-like structures using D(+)-glucose as a precursor. The optimised material shows a high surface area (3572 m2 g-1), and surface oxygenated functional groups, which lead to a high CO2 adsorption of 5.28 mmol g-1 at 1 bar and 31.5 mmol g-1 at 30 bar at 0 °C. Moreover, as an electrode material, the optimised sample exhibits an impressive specific capacitance (Cs) of 305 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 and 207 F g-1 at 10 A g-1 in a three-electrode supercapacitor. It also shows high specific capacitance (250 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1), a high energy density (58 Wh/kg), and stable cyclic performance in a two-symmetric electrode system.

For example, reaction of copper nitrate with dtbppH2 and dmpz at 60 °C leads to the isolation of the mononuclear copper phosphate [Cu(dtbppH)2(dmpz)(MeOH)2] (1) as the only product. However, the use of copper acetate in place of copper nitrate and conducting the reaction at the room temperature leads to the formation of both dinuclear [Cu(dtbpp)(dmpz)2]2 (2) and tetranuclear [Cu2(dtbpp)(dmpz)2(OAc)(MeO)]2 (3) from the same reaction mixture.

Despite promising results shown by combination therapies, there remains a need for efficient drug delivery materials capable of combining various drugs, imaging agents, and targeting agents to enhance treatment efficacy. In this study, we present the synthesis of novel core-shell hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles (@MSN) with bimodal porosity and a large surface area (694 m2/g) to facilitate targeted drug delivery for NSCLC treatment. The hollow core-shell structure enables the loading of a substantial quantity of the pemetrexed drug, up to 839 µg/mg, with a sustained release of 20% within 48 h. The MSN is surface functionalised with amino and carboxyl groups to accommodate an imaging agent and facilitate the attachment of the targeting drug bevacizumab. These particles exhibit rapid uptake by both A549 and PC-9 cells. Moreover, the targeting by bevacizumab leads to higher cytotoxicity within 48 h and induces apoptosis more effectively than the non-functionalised samples. As a versatile drug delivery platform, the hollow core-shell MSN demonstrated in this study holds great potential for various drug delivery applications.\n\nNova 2023 Bahadur R, Singh G, Li M, Chu D, Yi J, Karakoti A, Vinu A, 'BCN nanostructures conjugated nanoporous carbon with oxygenated surface and high specific surface area for enhanced CO\n\nPorous carbons, owing to their fascinating properties, are materials of high interest in several fields including gas capture and energy storage.

The conjugation of nanostructures such as BCN and surface functionalization is a creative approach to enhance their application potential. However, maintaining high porosity along with the creation of such features is rather complicated. Herein, we report on BCN conjugated nanoporous carbons with the high specific surface area through a unique approach of integrating the synthesis method of BCN and nanoporous carbon with chemical activation. In this approach, the high nitrogen containing precursor, aminoguanidine was mixed with boric acid, casein, and potassium acetate at 900 °C. The characterization data revealed the existence of BCN nanostructures in nanoporous carbon with a high specific surface area (2991 m2 g-1) and oxygen functional groups. The BCN content and the physicochemical properties of the hybrids can be easily tuned by varying the amount of AG in the synthesis mixture. The optimized sample exhibited a high CO2 adsorption capacity of 23.25 mmol g-1 at 0 °C and 30 bar and a high specific capacitance of 182.5 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 with exceptional stability and low resistance in a three-electrode supercapacitor system. The superior performance of synthesized materials for intended applications can be attributed to the synergetic effect of unique porous characteristics, BCN conjugation, and oxygen functionalization in nanoporous carbon. These exceptional results make this facile method of BCN conjugation of porous carbon a highly useful pathway to synthesize a variety of hybrid nanoporous carbon nanostructures for adsorption using such materials, the use of which can further be extended to more applications.\n\nNova 2023 Roy S, Philip FA, Oliveira EF, Singh G, Joseph S, Yadav RM, et al., 'Functional wood for carbon dioxide capture', Cell Reports Physical Science, 4 (2023) [C1]\n\nWith increasing global climate change, integrated concepts to innovate sustainable structures that can multiaxially address CO2 mitigation are crucial.

Here, we fabricate a functional wood structure with enhanced mechanical performance via a top-down approach incorporating a high-performance metal-organic framework (MOF), Calgary framework 20 (CALF-20). The functional wood with 10% (w/w) CALF-20 can capture CO2 with an overall gravimetric capacity of 0.45 mmol/g at 1 bar and 303 K that scales linearly with the MOF loading. Interestingly, the functional wood surpasses the calculated normalized adsorption capacity of CALF-20 stemming from the mesoporous wood framework, pore geometry modulation in CALF-20, and favorable CO2 uptake interactions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidate strong interactions between CALF-20 and the cellulose backbone and an understanding of how such interactions can favorably modulate the pore geometry and CO2 physisorption energies.

Notably, the NCW-2//rGO AHSC device delivers an ED of 43 Wh kg-1 at PD of 1.33 kW kg-1 and excellent electrochemical stability over 10,000 charge¿discharge cycles. Moreover, NCW-2//rGO SSHSC exhibits an ED of 34 Wh kg-1 at PD of 1.32 kW kg-1 with capacitance retention of 86% after 10,000 cycles. These results highlight the excellent electrochemical functionality and advantages of the Ni-Cr-LDH-POW nanohybrids as a cathode for hybrid supercapacitors.\n\nNova 2022 Lei Z, Sathish C, Liu Y, Karokoti A, Wang J, Qiao L, et al., 'Single metal atoms catalysts-Promising candidates for next generation energy storage and conversion devices', ECOMAT, 4 (2022) [C1] Nova 2022 Ramadass K, Sathish CI, Singh G, Ruban SM, Ruban AM, Bahadur R, et al., 'Morphologically tunable nanoarchitectonics of mixed kaolin-halloysite derived nitrogen-doped activated nanoporous carbons for supercapacitor and CO\n\nWe report an integrated approach by combining in-situ activation, doping and natural nanotemplating to design low-cost and highly efficient N-doped nanoporous carbons for energy s... [more]\n\nWe report an integrated approach by combining in-situ activation, doping and natural nanotemplating to design low-cost and highly efficient N-doped nanoporous carbons for energy storage and carbon capture applications. N-doped nanoporous carbons are prepared by impregnating sucrose, 3-amino 1,2,4-triazole and the ZnCl2 into the nanochannels of the mixed kaolin-halloysite nanotube nanoclay, followed by carbonization and clay template removal. The prepared materials exhibit micro and mesoporosity, high specific surface areas (1360¿1695 m2 g-1), and nitrogen content (7.73¿12.34 wt%). The optimized material offers the specific capacitance of 299 F g-1 (0.3 A g-1) and 134 F g-1 (10 A g-1) with excellent cycling stability (91% capacity retention after 4000 cycles/5 A g-1). N-doping together with the interconnected micro and mesoporous structure, offers a more ion accessible surface and further provides enhanced charge transfer, hydrophilicity, and the interaction of the electrode-electrolyte ions. The optimized material adsorbs 24.4 mmol g-1 of CO2 at 30 bar pressure and 0 °C. The synthesized materials performed better as supercapacitor and CO2 adsorbent than halloysite clay, kaolin clay, activated carbon, nanoporous carbons, and mesoporous silica. The method presented here will provide a unique platform for synthesizing a series of advanced nanostructures for electrochemical and carbon capture applications.\n\nNova 2022 Tiburcius S, Krishnan K, Patel V, Netherton J, Sathish C, Weidenhofer J, et al., 'Triple Surfactant Assisted Synthesis of Novel Core-Shell Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles with High Surface Area for Drug Delivery for Prostate Cancer', BULLETIN OF THE CHEMICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN, 95 331-340 (2022) [C1] Nova 2022 Jamaluddin MFB, Ghosh A, Ingle A, Mohammed R, Ali A, Bahrami M, et al., 'Bovine and human endometrium-derived hydrogels support organoid culture from healthy and cancerous tissues', Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 119 (2022) [C1] Nova 2022 Saleem H, Zaidi SJ, Ismail AF, Goh PS, Vinu A, 'Recent advances in the application of carbon nitrides for advanced water treatment and desalination technology', DESALINATION, 542 (2022) [C1] Nova 2022 Radhakrishnan D, Mohanan S, Choi G, Choy J-H, Tiburcius S, Trinh HT, et al., 'The emergence of nanoporous materials in lung cancer therapy', SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF ADVANCED MATERIALS, 23 225-274 (2022) [C1] Nova 2022 Ahmed S, Cui XY, Murmu PP, Ding X, Chu XZ, Sathish CI, et al., 'Doping and defect engineering induced extremely high magnetization and large coercivity in Co doped MoTe2', JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS, 918 (2022) [C1] Nova 2022 Guan X, Lei Z, Yu X, Lin C-H, Huang J-K, Huang C-Y, et al., 'Low-Dimensional Metal-Halide Perovskites as High-Performance Materials for Memory Applications.', Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany), 18 e2203311 (2022) [C1] Nova 2022 Li M, Zhou Z, Hu L, Hu L, Wang S, Zhou Y, et al., 'Hydrazine Hydrate Intercalated 1T-Dominant MoS Nova 2022 Geng X, Chang T, Fan J, Wang Y, Wang X, Sun Y, et al., 'Tuning Phase Transition and Thermochromic Properties of Vanadium Dioxide Thin Films via Cobalt Doping.', ACS applied materials & interfaces, 14 19736-19746 (2022) [C1] Nova 2022 Patel V, Jose L, Philippot G, Aymonier C, Inerbaev T, McCourt LR, et al., 'Fluoride-assisted detection of glutathione by surface Ce Nova 2022 Sathish CI, Kothandam G, Selvarajan P, Lei Z, Lee J, Qu J, et al., 'Ordered Mesoporous Boron Carbon Nitrides with Tunable Mesopore Nanoarchitectonics for Energy Storage and CO Nova 2022 Lei Z, Sathish CI, Geng X, Guan X, Liu Y, Wang L, et al., 'Manipulation of ferromagnetism in intrinsic two-dimensional magnetic and nonmagnetic materials', MATTER, 5 4212-4273 (2022) [C1] Nova 2022 Ding X, Li M, Chen P, Zhao Y, Zhao M, Leng H, et al., 'Bi2O2Se: A rising star for semiconductor devices', MATTER, 5 4274-4314 (2022) [C1] Nova 2022 Yang J-H, Mohanan S, Ruban AM, Li Z, Joseph S, Karakoti A, Vinu A, 'Calcination-free nanoarchitectonics of mesoporous conducting polymer@silica hybrids with ultra-large pores and their enhanced protein adsorption capacity', MICROPOROUS AND MESOPOROUS MATERIALS, 346 (2022) [C1] Nova 2022 Guan X, Wan T, Hu L, Lin C-H, Yang J, Huang J-K, et al., 'A Solution-Processed All-Perovskite Memory with Dual-Band Light Response and Tri-Mode Operation', ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS, 32 (2022) [C1] Nova 2022 Kansara K, Bolan S, Radhakrishnan D, Palanisami T, Al-Muhtaseb AH, Bolan N, et al., 'A critical review on the role of abiotic factors on the transformation, environmental identity and toxicity of engineered nanomaterials in aquatic environment', Environmental Pollution, 296 (2022) [C1]\n\nEngineered nanomaterials (ENMs) are at the forefront of many technological breakthroughs in science and engineering.

The extensive use of ENMs in several consumer products has resulted in their release to the aquatic environment. ENMs entering the aquatic ecosystem undergo a dynamic transformation as they interact with organic and inorganic constituents present in aquatic environment, specifically abiotic factors such as NOM and clay minerals, and attain an environmental identity. Thus, a greater understanding of ENM-abiotic factors interactions is required for an improved risk assessment and sustainable management of ENMs contamination in the aquatic environment. This review integrates fundamental aspects of ENMs transformation in aquatic environment as impacted by abiotic factors, and delineates the recent advances in bioavailability and ecotoxicity of ENMs in relation to risk assessment for ENMs-contaminated aquatic ecosystem. It specifically discusses the mechanism of transformation of different ENMs (metals, metal oxides and carbon based nanomaterials) following their interaction with the two most common abiotic factors NOM and clay minerals present within the aquatic ecosystem. The review critically discusses the impact of these mechanisms on the altered ecotoxicity of ENMs including the impact of such transformation at the genomic level. Finally, it identifies the gaps in our current understanding of the role of abiotic factors on the transformation of ENMs and paves the way for the future research areas.\n\nNova 2022 Yadav N, Patel V, McCourt L, Ruppert M, Miller M, Inerbaev T, et al., 'Tuning the enzyme-like activities of cerium oxide nanoparticles using a triethyl phosphite ligand.', Biomater Sci, 10 3245-3258 (2022) [C1] Nova 2022 Chinh NT, Manh VQ, Hoang T, Ramadass K, Sathish CI, Trung VQ, et al., 'Optimizing the component ratio to develop the biocomposites with carrageenan/collagen/allopurinol for the controlled drug release', Journal of Drug Delivery Science and Technology, 68 (2022) [C1]\n\nIn this paper, biocomposites were prepared with carrageenan/fish scale/allopurinol collagen by solution method.

Carrageenan fish scale collagen and allopurinol were used at different ratio and the effect of varying the component ratio was investigated by studying the shape, morphology, thermal behavior, and drug release ability of the biocomposites. By varying the carrageenan/collagen ratio, the shape of the biocomposites can be modified. When high amount of carrageenan was used, biocomposites were obtained in film whereas higher content of collagen produced powder form of biocomposites. The characteristics of the biocomposites were studied by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray Diffraction Analysis (XRD), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM), Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA), and Differential Scanning Calorimetric (DSC) techniques. The drug (allopurinol) release ability of the biocomposites was evaluated with Ultraviolet¿Visible Spectroscopy (UV¿Vis). Biocomposites in the powder form are different from the biocomposites in the film form by having different shape, morphology, thermal behavior, and drug release ability. However, both are sensitive to pH of solution in drug release process. In addition, the cell toxicity of allopurinol and these biocomposites was evaluated with Vero cells by MTT method.

Different weight ratios of KOH (VBC-urea mixture: KOH=1:0, 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3) have been used to optimize the porosity of NHPCs. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of the high porosity and N doping, the synthesized material with a high specific surface area of 687 m2/g and the N content at ~11 at% exhibited a high specific discharge capacity of 604.6 mAh/g at a current density of 0.1 A/g after 100 cycles and a high-rate performance of 245 mAh/g at 3 A/g. The developed material delivered a reversible capacity of 707.7 mAh/g at 0.05 A/g at the end of rate performance.

Lack of magnetic ordering limits its dream spintronic chips applications. Phosphorus and sulfur being large and electron-rich atoms, if adequately doped to graphene, will enable carrier injection (worth for electronic chips) and net spin-polarized electrons (worth for spintronic chips) in it. However, in-plane (preferentially) ultra-doping of graphene by phosphorus and sulfur is extremely challenging by conventional techniques. We report microwave doping of graphene by phosphorus and sulfur atoms up to record doping level of 15 and 12.5 % respectively which render graphene room temperature ferromagnetism with a saturation magnetization as high as 0.13 emu/g and 0.15 emu/g for phosphorus and sulfur doping ¿respectively¿. Spin-polarized DFT band structure calculations suggest vivid spin asymmetry caused by doping which supports our experimental findings of primarily graphitic doped samples. Microwave doping of graphene by phosphorus and sulfur brings in dramatic changes in its magnetic behaviour and thus the present research establishes it as a novel doping strategy with excellent efficiency, scalability, and reproducibility, and will inspire new generations of graphene-based spintronic chips.\n\nNova 2022 Liu Y, Yang M, Lu J, Liu Y, Liu H, Zhang E, et al., 'Tuning photoresponse of graphene-black phosphorus heterostructure by electrostatic gating and photo-induced doping', Chinese Chemical Letters, 33 368-373 (2022) [C1]\n\nMetal-semiconductor diodes constructed from two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals heterostructures show excellent gate electrostatics and a large built-in electric field at the tunne...

Here we demonstrate a metal-semiconductor photodiode constructed by the monolayer graphene (Gr) on a few-layer black phosphorus (BP). Due to the presence of a built-in potential barrier (~0.09 ± 0.03 eV) at the Gr-BP interface, the photoresponsivity of the Gr-BP device is enhanced by a factor of 672%, and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) increases to 648% from 84% of the bare BP. Electrostatic gating allows the BP channel to be switched between p-type and n-type conduction. We further demonstrate that excitation laser power can be used to control the current polarity of the Gr-BP device due to photon-induced doping. The versatility of the Gr-BP junctions in terms of electrostatic bias-induced or light-induced switching of current polarity is potentially useful for making dynamically reconfigurable digital circuits.\n\nNova 2022 Gujral HS, Singh G, Yang JH, Sathish CI, Yi J, Karakoti A, et al., 'Mesoporous titanium carbonitride derived from mesoporous C3N5 for highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction', CARBON, 195 9-18 (2022) [C1] Nova 2022 Wang R, Lee J-M, Rish SK, Bahadur R, Vinu A, Tahmasebi A, Yu J, 'One-pot synthesis of N-doped carbon nanosheets from Victorian brown coal with enhanced lithium storage', FUEL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY, 238 (2022) [C1] Nova 2022 Gujral HS, Fawaz M, Joseph S, Sathish CI, Singh G, Yu X, et al., 'Nanoporous TiCN with High Specific Surface Area for Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution Reaction', ACS Applied Nano Materials, 5 12077-12086 (2022) [C1] Nova 2022 Sugi Y, Premkumar S, Joseph S, Ramadass K, Sathish CI, Dasireddy VDBC, et al., 'Substitutional isomerism of triisopropylnaphthalenes in the isopropylation of naphthalene.

This method offers a convenient approach to induce porosity in the synthesized carbons without the need for an activating agent. The textural parameters including the specific surface area, pore volume, and pore size can be controlled by the simple adjustment of the carbonization temperature from 700 to 1000°C. The CNSs prepared at 700°C showed a low specific surface area, whereas the higher carbonization temperatures (800¿1000°C) supported the rise in specific surface area of the products (433.6¿1001.4 m2/g). The carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen (CHN) analysis revealed that the CNSs exhibited a high purity with the carbon percentage ranging between 96 and 99%. The synthesized materials were tested as adsorbents for CO2 gas, and it was found that the CNSs with the highest specific surface area of 1001.4 m2/g registered the CO2 adsorption capacity of 14.1 mmol/g at 0°C and 30 bar, which is a reasonably high value among reported porous carbons prepared without activation. This value of CO2 adsorption also stands above the activated carbon and multiwalled carbon nanotubes. The excellent CO2 adsorption capability of these adsorbents along with their low-cost synthesis offers a feasible pathway for designing such materials for other applications as well.\n\nNova 2022 Bolan N, Kumar M, Singh E, Kumar A, Singh L, Kumar S, et al., 'Antimony contamination and its risk management in complex environmental settings: A review', ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL, 158 (2022) [C1] Nova 2022 Ilbeygi H, Kim S, Kim IY, Joseph S, Kim MG, Vinu A, 'Super-reductive mesoporous phosphomolybdate with high crystallinity and its excellent performance for Li-ion battery application', JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A, 10 12132-12140 (2022) [C1] Nova 2022 Naikoo GA, Arshad F, Hassan IU, Awan T, Salim H, Pedram MZ, et al., 'Nanomaterials-based sensors for the detection of COVID-19: A review', Bioengineering and Translational Medicine, 7 (2022) [C1]\n\nWith the threat of increasing SARS-CoV-2 cases looming in front of us and no effective and safest vaccine available to curb this pandemic disease due to its sprouting variants, ma... [more]\n\nWith the threat of increasing SARS-CoV-2 cases looming in front of us and no effective and safest vaccine available to curb this pandemic disease due to its sprouting variants, many countries have undergone a lockdown 2.0 or planning a lockdown 3.0. This has upstretched an unprecedented demand to develop rapid, sensitive, and highly selective diagnostic devices that can quickly detect coronavirus (COVID-19). Traditional techniques like polymerase chain reaction have proven to be time-inefficient, expensive, labor intensive, and impracticable in remote settings. This shifts the attention to alternative biosensing devices that can be successfully used to sense the COVID-19 infection and curb the spread of coronavirus cases. Among these, nanomaterial-based biosensors hold immense potential for rapid coronavirus detection because of their noninvasive and susceptible, as well as selective properties that have the potential to give real-time results at an economical cost. These diagnostic devices can be used for mass COVID-19 detection to understand the rapid progression of the infection and give better-suited therapies. This review provides an overview of existing and potential nanomaterial-based biosensors that can be used for rapid SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics. Novel biosensors employing different detection mechanisms are also highlighted in different sections of this review. Practical tools and techniques required to develop such biosensors to make them reliable and portable have also been discussed in the article.

The presence of nitrogen functionalities in the porous carbon matrix not only helps to reduce the Cu ions but also stabilizes the nanoparticles and offers redox sites, which are beneficial for adsorption and electrochemical applications.

[more]\n\nOne of the key focuses of the agricultural industry for preventing the decline in crop yields due to pests is to develop effective, safe, green, and sustainable pesticide formulation. A key objective of industry is to deliver active ingredients (AIs) that have minimal off site migration and non-target activity. Nanoporous materials have received significant attention internationally for the efficient loading and controlled, targeted delivery of pesticides. This is largely made possible due to their textural features including high surface area, large pore-volume, and tunable pore size. Additionally, the easier manipulation of their surface chemistry and stability in different environments are added advantages. The unique features of these materials allow them to address the solubility of the active ingredients, their efficient loading onto the porous channels, and slow and controlled delivery over time. One of their major advantages is the wide range of materials that could be suitably designed via different approaches to either adsorb, encapsulate, or entrap the active ingredient.

[more]\n\nWith the ever-increasing demand for lithium (Li) for portable energy storage devices, there is a global concern associated with environmental contamination of Li, via the production, use, and disposal of Li-containing products, including mobile phones and mood-stabilizing drugs. While geogenic Li is sparingly soluble, Li added to soil is one of the most mobile cations in soil, which can leach to groundwater and reach surface water through runoff. Lithium is readily taken up by plants and has relatively high plant accumulation coefficient, albeit the underlying mechanisms have not been well described. Therefore, soil contamination with Li could reach the food chain due to its mobility in surface- and ground-waters and uptake into plants. High environmental Li levels adversely affect the health of humans, animals, and plants. Lithium toxicity can be considerably managed through various remediation approaches such as immobilization using clay-like amendments and/or chelate-enhanced phytoremediation. This review integrates fundamental aspects of Li distribution and behaviour in terrestrial and aquatic environments in an effort to efficiently remediate Li-contaminated ecosystems. As research to date has not provided a clear picture of how the increased production and disposal of Li-based products adversely impact human and ecosystem health, there is an urgent need for further studies on this field.\n\nNova 2021 Palliyarayil A, Selvarajan P, Prakash PS, Sathish CI, Dasireddy VDBC, Vinu A, et al., 'An Experimental and Theoretical Investigation on the Oxidation of CO over Pd/C Derived from the Spent Pd Catalyst', CHEMCATCHEM, 13 1326-1339 (2021) [C1] Nova 2021 Lei Z, Lee JM, Singh G, Sathish CI, Chu X, Al-Muhtaseb AH, et al., 'Recent advances of layered-transition metal oxides for energy-related applications', Energy Storage Materials, 36 514-550 (2021) [C1]\n\nIn order to overcome the current energy and environment crisis caused by fossil fuels depletion and greenhouse gas emission, it is indispensable to introduce new, eco-friendly, hi...

However, their innate poor electronic conductivity greatly restricts their applications in energy conversion and storage. This review discusses and summarizes the developed strategies to overcome the limitation through surface modification including defect engineering, heteroatom incorporation and interlayer doping, as well as hybridization with conductive materials. In addition, a detailed summary of their synthesis and applications in supercapacitors, lithium ion batteries and electrocatalysis is included.

[more]\n\nThe isopropylation of naphthalene (NP) was carried out over a BEA zeolite (BEA38; SiO2/Al2O3 = 38) focused on the selectivities for diisopropylnaphthalene (DIPN) and triisopropylnaphthalene (TriIPN) isomers. The isopropylation gave possible eight DIPN isomers including ß,ß- (2,6- and 2,7-), a,ß- (1,3-, 1,6-, and 1,7-), and a,a- (1,4- and 1,5-). The catalysis over BEA works two types of controls: kinetic control operates to form predominantly bulky and unstable a,a-DIPN at low temperatures, and thermodynamic controls work for the predominant formation of the slim and stable ß,ß-DIPN at high temperatures, although the intermediately bulky and stable a,ß-DIPN are the major products through both controls. The enhanced selectivities for ß,ß-DIPN were observed at the early stages of the catalysis in the range of 200-300 °C, which operate under new type of thermodynamic control over fresh catalyst through thermodynamically preferred transition states; however, they decreased with the increase in the selectivities for a,a- and a,ß-DIPN, and converged after prolonged reaction period. The isopropylation of DIPN isomers gives TriIPN isomers: unstable and bulky 1,3,5- and 1,4,6-TriIPN with a,a,ß-substitution, and stable and slim 1,3,7- and 1,3,6-TriIPN with a,ß,ß-substitution. The low temperatures favor the former isomers, whereas the selectivity for the latter isomers increases with increasing reaction temperature. These results indicate that TriIPN isomers principally form under kinetic control at low temperatures, and thermodynamic controls participate in the catalysis at high temperatures. The selectivities for TriIPN isomers kept constant during the reaction at all temperatures: 200, 250, and 300 °C. The catalysis occurs inside the BEA channels and allow even the formation of bulky 1,3,5- and 1,4,6-TriIPN; however, all isomers cannot be isomerized to the others in the channels and on the external surfaces. Severe coke-deposition occurred during the catalysis, particularly in the early stages; however, the catalyst is recovered by the calcination with a small change in catalytic activity.\n\nNova 2021 Palliyarayil A, Selvarajan P, Prakash PS, Sathish CI, Dasireddy VDBC, Vinu A, et al., 'Cover Feature: An Experimental and Theoretical Investigation on the Oxidation of CO over Pd/C Derived from the Spent Pd Catalyst (5/2021)', ChemCatChem, 13 1248-1248 (2021) 2021 Singh G, Bahadur R, Ruban AM, Davidraj JM, Su D, Vinu A, 'Synthesis of functionalized nanoporous biocarbons with high surface area for CO\n\nNanoporous biocarbons derived from biomass have attracted significant attention owing to their great potential for energy storage and conversion and water purification.

However, the fabrication technology for these materials requires high cost and corrosive activating agents such as KOH or ZnCl2 which is a huge hurdle for their potential commercialization. In this study, a low-cost synthesis strategy is introduced for the preparation of O and N functionalized nanoporous biocarbons using non-corrosive and low-cost potassium citrate as an activating agent and casein as a biomass source via a single-step solid-state procedure. The presence of O functional groups in the activating agent and a large amount of N in the biomass precursor facilitated the successful incorporation of both O and N atoms into the final nanoporous biocarbons. A series of O and N functionalized nanoporous biocarbons with tunable porosity, specific surface area, and pore volume was prepared by varying the amount of the activating agent and casein. The optimized material CPC-3, which was synthesized using a 1¿:¿3 ratio of casein to potassium citrate, showed a high surface area (2212 m2 g-1), a large pore volume (1.11 cm3 g-1), and an appreciable amount of surface oxygen-containing functional groups. With the advantages of excellent surface parameters and the O and N functionalities on the porous surface, the functionalized nanoporous biocarbons achieved a high CO2 adsorption capacity of 25.4 mmol g-1 at 0 °C and 30 bar and showed an impressive specific capacitance of 177 F g-1 in a three-electrode and 95 A g-1 two-electrode system at 0.5 A g-1 using 3 M KOH as an electrolyte. Interestingly, the functionalized nanoporous biocarbon with a high amount of micropores displays a CO2 adsorption capacity of 5.3 mmol g-1 at 1 bar/0 °C, which is much higher than that of the reported activated porous carbon materials and ordered mesoporous carbons. It is surmised that the reported unique fabrication approach and the multifunctionality nature of these fascinating materials offer exciting opportunities for cost-effective CO2 adsorption systems and highly efficient energy storage devices.\n\nNova 2021 Kim S, Singh G, Sathish CI, Panigrahi P, Daiyan R, Lu X, et al., 'Tailoring the Pore Size, Basicity, and Binding Energy of Mesoporous C\n\nWe investigated the CO2 adsorption and electrochemical conversion behavior of triazole-based C3N5 nanorods as a single matrix for consecutive CO2 capture and conversion.

The pore size, basicity, and binding energy were tailored to identify critical factors for consecutive CO2 capture and conversion over carbon nitrides. Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) analysis of CO2 demonstrates that triazole-based C3N5 shows higher basicity and stronger CO2 binding energy than g-C3N4. Triazole-based C3N5 nanorods with 6.1 nm mesopore channels exhibit better CO2 adsorption than nanorods with 3.5 and 5.4 nm mesopore channels. C3N5 nanorods with wider mesopore channels are effective in increasing the current density as an electrocatalyst during the CO2 reduction reaction. Triazole-based C3N5 nanorods with tailored pore sizes exhibit CO2 adsorption abilities of 5.6¿9.1 mmol/g at 0 °C and 30 bar. Their Faraday efficiencies for reducing CO2 to CO are 14¿38% at a potential of -0.8 V vs. RHE.\n\nNova 2021 Singh G, Lee JM, Kothandam G, Palanisami T, Al-Muhtaseb AH, Karakoti A, et al., 'A Review on the Synthesis and Applications of Nanoporous Carbons for the Removal of Complex Chemical Contaminants', BULLETIN OF THE CHEMICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN, 94 1232-1257 (2021) [C1] Nova 2021 Joseph S, Lee JM, Benzigar MR, Yi J, Karakoti A, Vinu A, 'Milk derived highly ordered mesoporous carbon with CaF\n\nHere we report on the synthesis of highly ordered nanoporous carbon decorated with CaF2 nanoclusters along the pore wall structure using dairy milk as a carbon and calcium source ... [more]\n\nHere we report on the synthesis of highly ordered nanoporous carbon decorated with CaF2 nanoclusters along the pore wall structure using dairy milk as a carbon and calcium source through nano-hard templating approach wherein mesoporous silica SBA-15 with different pore diameters are used as template. CaF2 is introduced during the removal process of silica template and can help to enhance the charge transfer. Nitrogen adsorption results reveal that the prepared materials exhibit high specific surface area with bimodal porous structures which act as a media for the rapid ion transports through the regular and interconnected micro- and mesoporous structure. The mesoporous carbon samples also exhibit hexagonally ordered pores with rod shaped morphology, which is similar to that of the template, confirming that the templating process is successful. Finally, the optimised electrode is highly stable and offers the capacitance of 182 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 with almost 100% retention rate even after 5000 cycles due to a strong intimate coupling generated by the CaF2 nanoclusters within the wall structure. The electrode performance of milk derived carbon samples is much better than that of activated carbon, multiwalled carbon nanotubes and the mesoporous carbons without CaF2.\n\nNova 2021 Baskar AV, Ruban AM, Davidraj JM, Singh G, Al-Muhtaseb AH, Lee JM, et al., 'Single-step synthesis of 2D mesoporous C Nova 2021 Sugi Y, Joseph S, Ramadass K, Indirathankam SC, Premkumar S, Dasireddy VDBC, et al., 'The isopropylation of naphthalene over USY zeolite with FAU topology.

[more]\n\nThe isopropylation of naphthalene (NP) over USY zeolite (FAU06, SiO2/Al2O3 = 6) gave all eight possible diisopropylnaphthalene (DIPN) isomers: ß,ß- (2,6- and 2,7-), a,ß- (1,3-, 1,6-, and 1,7-), and a,a- (1,4- and 1,5-). The catalyses were operated under kinetic and/or thermodynamic controls depending on the reaction temperatures since the cavities of FAU topology are wide enough to form all DIPN isomers. Enhanced selectivities for ß,ß-DIPN were observed at the early stages at 200°C, 250°C, and 300°C although the selectivities decreased with the increasing periods, accompanying the increase in a,a- and a,ß-DIPN. The enhancement occurred under new types of thermodynamic controls through thermodynamically preferred transition states to ß,ß-DIPN. Triisopropylnaphthalene (TriIPN) isomers were also formed in the isopropylation. Unstable a,a,ß-TriIPN (1,4,6- and 1,3,5-) was predominantly formed at lower temperatures, however, decreased with the increased of stable a,ß,ß-TriIPN (1,3,6- and 1,3,7-) at higher temperatures. The predominant formation of 1,4,6-TriIPN was also observed in the initial stages in the range of 200°C, 250°C, and 300°C, as reaction period was increased, while the selectivity for the isomer was decreased with concomitant increase in the selectivities for the other isomers. These changes of the selectivities operated under kinetic and/or thermodynamic controls. Large cavities of the zeolite allowed the formation of all TriIPN isomers without steric restriction.\n\nNova 2021 Sathish CI, Premkumar S, Chu X, Yu X, Breese MBH, Al-Abri M, et al., 'Microporous Carbon Nitride (C3N5.4) with Tetrazine based Molecular Structure for Efficient Adsorption of CO2 and Water', Angewandte Chemie, 133 21412-21419 (2021) 2021 Ruban SM, Sathish CI, Ramadass K, Joseph S, Kim S, Dasireddy VDBC, et al., 'Ordered Mesoporous Carbon Nitrides with Tuneable Nitrogen Contents and Basicity for Knoevenagel Condensation', ChemCatChem, 13 468-474 (2021) [C1]\n\nWe report on the preparation of ordered mesoporous carbon nitrides (MCN) with a 3D porous structure, tuneable nitrogen contents and basicity and their basic catalytic activities o... [more]\n\nWe report on the preparation of ordered mesoporous carbon nitrides (MCN) with a 3D porous structure, tuneable nitrogen contents and basicity and their basic catalytic activities on the Knoevenagel condensation of benzaldehyde with malononitrile. The chemical structure and the nitrogen contents of the materials are finely tuned with the simple adjustment of the calcination temperature from 350 to 550 °C. The samples prepared at 350 and 400 °C exhibit C3N5 structures with 1-amino/imino-1,2,4-triazole moieties, whereas the samples synthesised at 450, 500, and 550 °C possess C3N4 structures with 2-amino/imino-1,3,5-triazine moieties. The materials prepared at the temperature lower than 400 °C show much higher activity than those of the samples prepared at 450, 500 and 550 °C. The change in the catalytic activities of these materials is linked with the change of the structure, nitrogen contents and the functional groups on the surface of the materials prepared at different temperatures. CO2 temperature programme desorption study reveals that 1-amino/imino-1,2,4-triazole moieties in C3N5 samples provide high basicity due to the strain in 5-membered 1,2,4-triazole rings; however, the samples with 1,3,5-triazine moieties have limited basicity which significantly affects the catalytic activity of the material. The optimised C3N5 catalyst shows an enhanced catalytic activity when compared to other mesoporous basic catalysts and C3N4. It is also found that the optimised catalysts are highly stable and can be recycled several times and no major change in the activity is observed.\n\nNova 2021 Ilbeygi H, Sawant DP, Ruban SM, Reshma KS, Umbarkar SB, Halligudi SB, Vinu A, 'Direct Synthesis of Mesoporous Siliceous Phosphotungstic Acid and Its Superior Catalytic Activity on the Cyclohexylation of Phenol', Journal of Physical Chemistry C, 125 6723-6734 (2021) [C1]\n\nThe synthesis of highly active and reusable mesoporous siliceous phosphotungstic acid materials (mPTA-Si) which are prepared through a simple self-assembly between phosphotungstic... [more]\n\nThe synthesis of highly active and reusable mesoporous siliceous phosphotungstic acid materials (mPTA-Si) which are prepared through a simple self-assembly between phosphotungstic acid (PTA), the polymeric surfactant, and the silica precursor assisted by KCl for cyclohexylation of phenol is reported. The surface area and the acidity of these materials are tuned with a simple adjustment of PTA in the silica framework. The prepared samples exhibit mesoporous structure with a high surface area, but the structure is collapsed when the loading of PTA is high. It is established that the Keggin structure of PTA is retained on the final mPTA-Si. mPTA-Si with different loadings of PTA are employed as the catalysts for the cyclohexylation of phenol under liquid phase conditions. Among the catalysts studied, 10.0-mPTA-8.3Si calcined at 350 °C is found to be highly active, selective, and recyclable and offers 100% conversion of phenol with the highest selectivity for p-cyclohexylphenol (96.8%).\n\nNova 2021 Selvarajan P, Fawaz M, Sathish CI, Li M, Chu D, Yu X, et al., 'Activated Graphene Nanoplatelets Decorated with Carbon Nitrides for Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction Reaction', Advanced Energy and Sustainability Research, 2 (2021) [C1] Nova 2021 Bodhankar PM, Chunduri A, Patel N, Dhawale DS, Vinu A, Aljohani H, Sarawade PB, 'Fine-tuning the water oxidation performance of hierarchical Co3O4 nanostructures prepared from different cobalt precursors', SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS, 5 1120-1128 (2021) [C1] Nova 2021 Bodhankar PM, Sarawade PB, Singh G, Vinu A, Dhawale DS, 'Recent advances in highly active nanostructured NiFe LDH catalyst for electrochemical water splitting', Journal of Materials Chemistry A, 9 3180-3208 (2021) [C1]\n\nHighly efficient, low-cost electrocatalysts having superior activity and stability are crucial for practical electrochemical water splitting, which involves hydrogen and oxygen ev...
