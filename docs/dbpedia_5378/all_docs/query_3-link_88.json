        "text": "A series of \"small but severe\" thunderstorms have dumped a huge amount of hail on Newcastle and the New South Wales Central Coast.\n\nPictures posted online show grassed areas in Newcastle covered in snow-white hail, with residents sharing images of golf ball-sized hailstones.\n\nThe Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) issued a severe thunderstorm warning for the Hunter Region, with the wild conditions expected to move north.\n\nThe first of the thunderstorms formed near the Central Coast around 10.30am, while another system hit Newcastle closer to noon.\n\n\"A series of small but intense thunderstorms swept over the Central Coast and Newcastle area in NSW on Friday, producing heavy rain, copious lightning and hail,\" Weatherzone said.\n\n\"The thunderstorms formed near a southerly change that swept up the NSW coast on Friday, causing cold air to undercut warmer air, forcing the warm air to rise and produce storms.\"\n\nThe storms have since weakened as they move north, however a severe weather warning for hail and heavy rain remains in place for the region just north of Newcastle.\n\n\"Severe thunderstorms are likely to produce large hailstones and heavy rainfall that may lead to flash flooding in the warning area over the next several hours,\" the BoM said.\n\nAdelaide hit with city's wettest November day in nearly 60 years\n\n\"Accumulations of small hail are also possible.\n\n\"Locations which may be affected include Forster, Seal Rocks, Bulahdelah, Nelson Bay and Dungog.\"\n\nAn update on that warning is due at 4.30pm.\n\nSign up hereto receive our daily newsletters and breaking news alerts, sent straight to your inbox."
