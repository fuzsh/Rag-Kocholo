Observations at this station [ ] are 24-h 09-09 GMT, some others { } occasionally refer to other 24-h periods, extremes (first indications) are usually 21-21 GMT. When averages are referred to (.) compares with the last decade and [.] with the new 30-y climatological average [1981-2010]. All data are subject to verification and amendment.\n\nJanuary 2023\n\nJanuary 1 - a fine morning and becoming brighter at the 0900 GMT observations after recent showers of rain. Visibility was very good there was not much in the way of snow on the Eryri Mountains except a few high patches and a sprinkling of fresh ice precipitation on the very tops. A red squirrel was at a feeding box and a raven was croaking on the tallest Scots pine no doubt having a good view of the surrounding countryside. The temperature was 6.1C an overnight minimum and on the grass there had been a minimum of 3.7C. Pressure 1001 mb was rising with low pressure over the UK with 994 mb over the North sea just off Tayside. The sky was darkening in the W with towering cumulus clouds developing over the mountains and to the NE over Liverpool Bay, cumulonimbus were in the vicinity. Llyn Tegid at Bala after much rainfall was full and overflowing flooding the carpark at the visitor centre [Max 8.5C Min 6.1C Rain 5.4 mm]. The 2nd began with little cloud in the sky and though the sun had not risen above cloud huggng the mountaintops brightness was increasing. There was little wind, smoke was drifting from the NW. Visibility was good, there had been a fresh fall of snow and was lying at 2500 ft. Pressure 1016 mb was rising in a ridge from Azores high 1030 mb. A skein of geese flew noisily overhead moving in a north-westerly direction. Rain at Bala (32.4 mm) helped to swell the water in Llyn Tegid keeping the car park underwater. Cloudier around noon, the afternoon had sunny spells turning cloudier with the SW'ly breeze picked up during the evening. The temperature rising reached 4.7C by midnight [Max 9.6C Min 1.2C Grass -1.7C Rain 0.8 mm]. The 3rd was mild overnight and began dull and wet the temperature at 0900 GMT in warm sector air 9.6C highest of the past 24h. A frontal wave was over SW Ireland associated with low 985 mb to the W over the Atlantic. At noon low 998 mb was over Shannon with a warm front over the Irish Sea. Spells of light occasionally moderate rain of 13h duration. Sunless. Wet in Snowdonia (Capel Curig 44.4 mm) [Max 11.4C Min 2.2C Rain 12.4 mm]. On the 4th pressure 1008 mb was rising with low 987 mb over the N North Sea with a cold front over the English Channel. Rain amounts continued to be substantial over North Wales with (40.4 mm) recorded at Lake Vyrnwy. We were in a strong moist SW'ly airflow as depressions pass over northeastwards. Patches of standing water were seen on the Cefni Marsh. Another sunless day [Max 10.8C Min 9.4C Rain 1.2 mm]. Another sunless day on the 5th continuing very mild began with poor misty visibility and intermittent slight drizzle. Pressure 1015 mb was falling with low 990 mb Shannon and a warm front over Anglesey,a cold front was situated off SW Ireland. With the jetstream over Britain another depression 951 mb was over the Atlantic to the W. The cold front passed over during the evening producing a 4C temperature fall as the low 975 mb approached the Western Isles of Scotland. At 1619 GMT the wind reached 40 mph and rain fell at up to 21 mm/h at 1836 GMT [Max 11.3C Min 8.7C Rain 11.8 mm]. The morning of the 6th began with an ugly red sky in the east then was overcast and dull, but it was dry though the ground was very wet even soggy. The last three days had been very mild, today was cooler after a minimum of 6.9C it was 8.2C at 0900 GMT. Red squirrels were running about the garden and visiting the feeding boxes helping themselves to monkey nuts or hazel nuts and hiding away or burying a number. If they don't return for them a few small hazel trees appear from time to time. Deep low 952 mb was to the W of Ireland and warm air returned between 18 and 23 GMT, maximum 11.2C at 2100 GMT, as a wedge of warm sector air passed through, followed strengthening wind and a spell of light rain through the night [Max 11.2C Min 6.9C Rain 6.0 mm]. At midnight on the 7th deep pressure 988 mb was falling with low 949 mb to the W with a cold front over the Irish Sea. The temperature was 10.1C at 0051 GMT before falling erratically and had reached 3.6C by 0900 GMT the wind also moderating. With low 955 mb W of Ireland pressure continued to fall. It was dull and wet the light rain and drizzle continued until 0930 GMT. Some weak sunshine then bright sunshine for a while before the afternoon turned dull with rain at times the temperature reaching a minimum of 6.8C at 1627 GMT. Pressure was lowest 986 mb at 1830 GMT. During the evening the temperature began rising and the wind strengthened again reaching 36 mph at 2145 GMT (Libanus 50.6 mm) [Max 9.5C Min 8.2C Rain 9.0 mm]. The 8th began wet with moderate to heavy rain and poor visibility. Pressure falling again was on 986 mb with complex low 955 mb to the NW. A frontal band over the Irish Sea was moving away by noon when the rain eased. The afternoon remaining cool and quite dull I spent it in the greenhouse cutting back the chrysanthemums that had finished flowering [Capel Curig 16.8 mm] [Max 6.5C Min 3.6C Rain 7.4C]. Showery rain with small ice pellets after midnight on the 9th brought the rainfall total at 0900 GMT to 12.4 mm for the past 24h. The sky was slowly clearing the moderate visibility improving with cumulus clouds developing by 0930 GMT. The sea was rough around the coast and there were pools of water on Cefni Marsh. The sun appeared around noon the temperature 7.3C at 1630 GMT [Valley 21.6 mm 3.6h] [Max 9.6C Min 3.6C Rain 12.4 mm].\n\nThe first snowdrops of the season were spotted on the 9th in the garden here at Gadlys a bit later than usual. The median date of flowering (data set 1994-2022) is the 4th of January. Last year they appeared on the 3rd of January. It's always nice to see the first ones pop up, sometimes we see them in snow, but not recent years.\n\nThe 10th was wet and windy with no sunshine. At 0900 GMT conditions were drenching and dark with zero solar radiation recorded a headlight was needed for the obs. It was milder with strong to gale force winds with gusts of 47 mph here at 1154 GMT and 50 mph at Gorwel Heights, Llanfairfechan. Warm sector air until 1700 GMT when a cold front that was over Ireland moved across (Capel Curig 60.6 mm) [Max 11.7C min 5.0C Rain 15.6 mm].\n\nEarly on the 17th the ground was covered white with a rare form of small soft hail. It was cold, below freezing -1.4C at 0900 GMT and the hail had not melted. Overnight the air temperature was at a minimum -2.4C at 0700 GMT and on the grass it had fallen to -5.7C, the soil surface was frozen hard with the temperature at 5 cm depth 1.0C. There was some hoar frost on vegetation and rime on the rims of copper raingauges. It was then sunny with 5 oktas of cumulus and cirrus with cumulonimbus over the Eryri mountains. Pressure 990.5 mb was rising with a complex of lows around the UK. Over the S Norwegian Sea 969 mb and 982 mb over the coast of Brittany. Pressure was high 1037 mb NW of the Azores and 1030 mb E of the Black Sea. The snowline on the Carneddau was at 2000 ft with a 30% cover at 1500 ft. The fall of soft hail had not marked the well covered hailpad, usually even small snow pellets leave a fine etching of the aluminium surface. Examination of the still frozen hail under a lens and photograph (left) revealed that the hail was an aggregation of ice crystals of the ordered of 1 mm diameter each composed of tiny diamond shaped crystals of the order of a tenth of a millimetre (100 micrometres). Usually such small ice crystals would have melted before reaching the ground. Later larger conical shaped snow pellets fell at 1400 GMT followed by some small snow flakes and again from 1500 GMT with large flakes of snow enough to cover the ground. The wind was NNW'ly and wintry showers were coming off the North Channel and Irish Sea on to North Wales and sometimes through the Cheshire gap.

Similar samples of dust were collected at 1200 GMT, 1700 GMT and 0900 GMT the following day 1 July, in all 3.4 mm of rain was measured over the 24-h period. Backward trajectory analyses using the HYSPLIT air transport model on the NOAA ARL website indicated that air arriving at many levels over Llansadwrn today from 0500 GMT onwards originated in north-east United States, Canada and over Nova Scotia. Wildfires had been raging in Canada in recent days with smoke drifting east and south to New York where orange coloured smoke obscured visibility, Massachuseetts and Connecticut where particulate levels in the air were very high exceeding health threshold limits. On 7 June New York reported PM 2.5 particulates of 245 µg per m-3 . To date 2,765 fires have occurred in Canada this year, many out of control, with eleven times the average area in recent previous years burnt. NASA's GEOS-FP model indicated Black Carbon particles crossing the Atlantic Ocean first to Portugal and Spain before moving to Europe. Smoke could be seen on the EUMETSAT 0600 GMT satellite image over the Celtic and Irish Seas. The Met Office on the 29th tweeted an annotated image of the smoke (left). The graphic (above right) shows that parcels of air arriving over Llansadwrn between 2500 m and 3500 m above ground level (AGL) at 0500 GMT today, when the rain began, originated in North America from 26-29th June before travelling over 5200 km across the Atlantic. Similar trajectories were obtained hourly through the day. The dust washed out of the air today is likely to be dust known as Black Carbon originating from the Canadian wildfires [Max 15.2C Min 12.6C Rain 3.4 mm] [Hawarden 18.5C Sennybridge 8.6C & 11.6 mm Aberdaron 0.2h Valley nil]\n\nThe month ended with rainfall of 39.1 mm (54%) & [53%] of averages, largest since 2018 ranked 16th least since 1929.

There was a trace deposit of dust appearing a mixture of greyish black and light reddish colour. Backward trajectory analyses using the HYSPLIT air transport model on the NOAA ARL website indicated that parcels of air arrived over Llansadwrn between 2000 m and 3000 m above ground level (AGL) from a pool of air over the Atlantic that had origins in North America and the Sahara. The darker coloured dust was probably from the ongoing wildfires in Canada and the light reddish coloured from heavy duststorms in the Sahara from the 9th of August that had blown over the Atlantic. The ensuing 24-h continued wet with 17 wet-hour duration recorded. Pressure was on 1020 mb with low 1006 mb over the Norwegian Sea and high 1022 mb Belgium The rain that was moderate at 1344 GMT was associated with a slow-moving frontal wave over the Irish Sea associated with low 1013 mb NE Azores off Iberia.

Trace amounts of a light coloured dust were observed at 09 GMT on the mornings of the 5th and 6th were dry deposition when a milky sky was observed dust pooling over Britain with little air movement. On the 7th the dust collected as wet deposition was more obvious. Backward trajectory analysis using the HYSPLIT model, courtesy of the NOAA ARL READY website, indicated that parcels of air arriving over Llansadwrn between 2000 and 3000 m AGL originated passing over north Africa. Most deposition was on the 8th when vehicles were obviously covered with a heavy deposition, on drying the dust was a light reddish brown colour MUNSEL® 2YR 6/3.
