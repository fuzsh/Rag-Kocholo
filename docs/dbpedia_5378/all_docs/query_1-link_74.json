The daily average here is higher than in most cities around the world.\n\nForecast\n\nIn Newcastle, Australia, the barometric pressure often fluctuates throughout the year. During the summer months, the barometric pressure is generally higher, bringing stable weather with warm temperatures. In the winter, the pressure tends to be lower, leading to more unsettled weather and cooler temperatures.\n\nThe landscape around Newcastle plays a role in influencing the atmospheric pressure. The city is located by the coast, which means it is affected by coastal winds and pressure systems. The nearby mountain ranges further impact the air flow, causing variations in the pressure. These geographical features contribute to the ever-changing weather patterns experienced in Newcastle.\n\nDisclaimer\n\n* The barometric pressure information for Newcastle, Australia on this page is for educational purposes only.
