We have no information as to whether it is valid and what flights it receives or sends.\n\nNewcastle: weather forecast\n\nThe weather forecast is shown in local time in Newcastle\n\nTODAY\n\n22:00\n\n16.7°C\n\n7km/h\n\nfeels like 16.9°C, Rain (light rain)\n\nhumidity: 95%, clouds: 78%\n\nAUGUST 16\n\n01:00\n\n16.3°C\n\n7km/h\n\nfeels like 16.4°C, Clouds (broken clouds: 51-84%)\n\nhumidity: 92%, clouds: 68%\n\n04:00\n\n15.9°C\n\n7km/h\n\nfeels like 15.9°C, Clouds (scattered clouds: 25-50%)\n\nhumidity: 91%, clouds: 50%\n\n07:00\n\n16.0°C\n\n7km/h\n\nfeels like 16.0°C, Clouds (scattered clouds: 25-50%)\n\nhumidity: 90%, clouds: 29%\n\n10:00\n\n17.2°C\n\n8km/h\n\nfeels like 17.2°C, Clouds (broken clouds: 51-84%)\n\nhumidity: 86%, clouds: 51%\n\n13:00\n\n19.2°C\n\n7km/h\n\nfeels like 19.1°C, Clouds (broken clouds: 51-84%)\n\nhumidity: 74%, clouds: 71%\n\n16:00\n\n17.9°C\n\n6km/h\n\nfeels like 17.9°C, Rain (light rain)\n\nhumidity: 83%, clouds: 58%\n\n19:00\n\n16.1°C\n\n13km/h\n\nfeels like 16.1°C, Rain (light rain)\n\nhumidity: 91%, clouds: 45%\n\n22:00\n\n15.2°C\n\n15km/h\n\nfeels like 15.2°C, Rain (light rain)\n\nhumidity: 93%, clouds: 67%\n\nAUGUST 17\n\n01:00\n\n14.7°C\n\n11km/h\n\nfeels like 14.5°C, Clouds (few clouds: 11-25%)\n\nhumidity: 88%, clouds: 13%\n\n04:00\n\n14.0°C\n\n18km/h\n\nfeels like 13.7°C, Rain (light rain)\n\nhumidity: 88%, clouds: 27%\n\n07:00\n\n14.2°C\n\n19km/h\n\nfeels like 13.9°C, Rain (light rain)\n\nhumidity: 88%, clouds: 97%\n\n10:00\n\n17.8°C\n\n28km/h\n\nfeels like 17.3°C, Rain (light rain)\n\nhumidity: 61%, clouds: 59%\n\n13:00\n\n19.2°C\n\n30km/h\n\nfeels like 18.5°C, Clear (clear sky)\n\nhumidity: 51%, clouds: 1%\n\n16:00\n\n18.4°C\n\n33km/h\n\nfeels like 17.6°C, Clear (clear sky)\n\nhumidity: 51%, clouds: 3%\n\n19:00\n\n16.3°C\n\n32km/h\n\nfeels like 15.4°C, Clear (clear sky)\n\nhumidity: 57%, clouds: 4%\n\n22:00\n\n14.7°C\n\n37km/h\n\nfeels like 13.9°C, Clear (clear sky)\n\nhumidity: 61%, clouds: 2%\n\nAUGUST 18\n\n01:00\n\n13.3°C\n\n36km/h\n\nfeels like 12.4°C, Clear (clear sky)\n\nhumidity: 66%, clouds: 0%\n\n04:00\n\n13.1°C\n\n32km/h\n\nfeels like 12.2°C, Clear (clear sky)\n\nhumidity: 67%, clouds: 4%\n\n07:00\n\n12.5°C\n\n26km/h\n\nfeels like 11.6°C, Clear (clear sky)\n\nhumidity: 72%, clouds: 3%\n\n10:00\n\n14.7°C\n\n25km/h\n\nfeels like 13.9°C, Clouds (scattered clouds: 25-50%)\n\nhumidity: 65%, clouds: 36%\n\n13:00\n\n16.1°C\n\n24km/h\n\nfeels like 15.4°C, Clouds (broken clouds: 51-84%)\n\nhumidity: 64%, clouds: 76%\n\n16:00\n\n16.8°C\n\n21km/h\n\nfeels like 16.3°C, Clouds (scattered clouds: 25-50%)\n\nhumidity: 68%, clouds: 44%\n\n19:00\n\n15.0°C\n\n15km/h\n\nfeels like 14.7°C, Clear (clear sky)\n\nhumidity: 79%, clouds: 0%\n\n22:00\n\n14.4°C\n\n10km/h\n\nfeels like 14.0°C, Rain (light rain)\n\nhumidity: 83%, clouds: 1%\n\nAUGUST 19\n\n01:00\n\n14.5°C\n\n11km/h\n\nfeels like 14.2°C, Rain (light rain)\n\nhumidity: 83%, clouds: 64%\n\n04:00\n\n14.8°C\n\n13km/h\n\nfeels like 14.4°C, Rain (light rain)\n\nhumidity: 79%, clouds: 84%\n\n07:00\n\n14.6°C\n\n12km/h\n\nfeels like 14.1°C, Rain (light rain)\n\nhumidity: 77%, clouds: 100%\n\n10:00\n\n15.0°C\n\n9km/h\n\nfeels like 14.6°C, Rain (light rain)\n\nhumidity: 76%, clouds: 98%\n\n13:00\n\n15.8°C\n\n8km/h\n\nfeels like 15.3°C, Rain (light rain)\n\nhumidity: 72%, clouds: 88%\n\n16:00\n\n15.9°C\n\n11km/h\n\nfeels like 15.4°C, Rain (light rain)\n\nhumidity: 70%, clouds: 77%\n\n19:00\n\n14.3°C\n\n12km/h\n\nfeels like 13.8°C, Clouds (few clouds: 11-25%)\n\nhumidity: 76%, clouds: 15%\n\n22:00\n\n14.1°C\n\n16km/h\n\nfeels like 13.6°C, Clouds (few clouds: 11-25%)\n\nhumidity: 80%, clouds: 18%\n\nAUGUST 20\n\n01:00\n\n13.6°C\n\n16km/h\n\nfeels like 13.2°C, Clear (clear sky)\n\nhumidity: 85%, clouds: 2%\n\n04:00\n\n13.0°C\n\n15km/h\n\nfeels like 12.7°C, Clear (clear sky)\n\nhumidity: 89%, clouds: 4%\n\n07:00\n\n12.3°C\n\n14km/h\n\nfeels like 11.9°C, Clouds (few clouds: 11-25%)\n\nhumidity: 90%, clouds: 15%\n\n10:00\n\n16.7°C\n\n8km/h\n\nfeels like 16.2°C, Clouds (scattered clouds: 25-50%)\n\nhumidity: 69%, clouds: 42%\n\n13:00\n\n20.2°C\n\n14km/h\n\nfeels like 19.8°C, Clouds (overcast clouds: 85-100%)\n\nhumidity: 59%, clouds: 91%\n\n16:00\n\n19.7°C\n\n23km/h\n\nfeels like 19.5°C, Clouds (scattered clouds: 25-50%)\n\nhumidity: 69%, clouds: 49%\n\n19:00\n\n16.5°C\n\n18km/h\n\nfeels like 16.4°C, Clouds (scattered clouds: 25-50%)\n\nhumidity: 85%, clouds: 36%\n\nBooker Bay, Australia | © Tom&#39;s channel\n\nFind out the temperature of sea water in more than 12000 cities and resorts around the world. Water surface temperature values are available in real time. There is a forecast of water temperature changes for the next few days, as well as historical data of sea surface temperature are available for all days of the last years.\n\nWe use data from various sources, including National Centers for Environmental Information (NOAA), meteorological services of different countries, data received from more than a thousand buoys around the world, satellite systems for scanning the surface of the oceans and seas.\n\nAll supported languages:"
