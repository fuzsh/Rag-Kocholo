        "text": "BBC weather: Highs of 30C set to sweep south-east England\n\nUK weather is showing no signs of cooling down as forecaster Carol Kirkwood told BBC Breakfast viewers temperatures will continue to skyrocket this week.\n\nShe said: “It is going to be a hot one, in fact the temperature at the moment in the Isle of Wight is 21.8 degrees Celsius and here in London it’s 18.6.”\n\nYesterday the temperatures went back up to 32 degrees Celsius after a weekend of thunderstorms and heavy rain in some places.\n\nToday there is a chance a few areas in the south coast and far south west could be hit with one of two showers.\n\nHowever, forecasters expect most of the downpours to remain in the English Channel or close to the near continent.\n\nCloud is possible in south east Scotland, where it could also feel cooler in the afternoon.\n\nBut again temperatures are likely to hit 31 or 32 degrees Celsius in England and Wales and mostly sunny in southern counties as showers move away.\n\nThere will be a bit of cloud across north sea coasts this evening, but temperatures still on the high side; perhaps humid in southern parts of England and Wales.\n\nNot a lot of rain in the forecast this week, instead sunny and bright for most with the small chance of outbreaks in the far south west on Tuesday.\n\nTemperatures are to rise in Scotland and Northern Ireland tomorrow, where figures could at worst be in the mid 20s.\n\nMeanwhile, 30 degrees or higher across inland parts of England and Wales also largely dry with lengthy spells of sunshine.\n\nLight winds on Wednesday mean more sunshine around, but cloudy across the east coast in places such as Edinburgh, Newcastle and Hull.\n\nThere will be little or no showers in the south west and temperatures remaining in the mid to high 20s on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nOn Thursday a cold weather front will loom to the north of Scotland which will drag in a bit more cloud across Northern Ireland and Scotland.\n\nRisk of showers in the Grampians, but dry further south where temperatures could peak close to 30 degrees Celsius.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.
