        "text": "Sydney has shivered through its coldest June morning since 2010, with temperatures plummeting to 5.2 degrees.\n\nIt comes as a slow-moving high pressure system resulted in clear skies, combining with a lingering cold and dry air mass.\n\nThe pattern created colder than usual conditions stretching from Tasmania to southern Queensland.\n\nIn the southwest suburbs, the mercury went even lower, with Campbelltown registering -1.6 degrees.\n\nAs cold as Sydney was, its icy temperature was beaten by Newcastle, with the city registering its coldest morning in 23 years, at 4.3 degrees.\n\nBut Canberra trumped them both, with its -7.2 low the coldest since 2018, and the coldest June morning since 1986.\n\nFive-year lows were also recorded in Bathurst, Mudgee, Orange, Dubbo, Casino and Gayndah.\n\nAnd Perisher Valley recorded Australia's lowest June temperature since 2018, getting down to -10 degrees.\n\nIn Victoria's Mount Hotham, temperatures got down to -7.2.\n\nIn Queensland's Applethorpe, the mercury slumped to -3.5.\n\nLiawenee recorded Tasmania's lowest temperature at -6.3.\n\nTomorrow also marks the winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, with the sun returning for longer and longer stretches in the sky.\n\nMeanwhile, South Australia is bracing for moderate to heavy rain from tomorrow as a system rolls east over Western Australia, Weatherzone reported.\n\nAdelaide is e xpected to receive up to 40mm of rain between 9am Thursday and 9am Friday, with isolated falls of up to 70mm.\n\nWinds of up to 75-85km/hr are also expected, which could be dangerous in combination with the rain loosening the roots of trees, Weatherzone warned.\n\nAdelaide hit with city's wettest November day in nearly 60 years\n\nSydney today is forecast to range from six to 16 degrees, with clear skies.\n\nMelbourne will be cloudy, ranging from four to 12 degrees.\n\nSunny Brisbane will have a minimum of eight degrees and a maximum of 21.\n\nThere is some rain still forecast for Perth, which will range between eight and 16 degrees.\n\nAdelaide will run the gamut from nine to 15 degrees, and Hobart from three to 12 degrees.\n\nDarwin is once again the only well-warmed capital, with forecast temperatures of 20 to 31 degrees.\n\nSign up hereto receive our daily newsletters and breaking news alerts, sent straight to your inbox."
