        "text": "January 1999 February 1999 March 1999 April 1999 May 1999 June 1999 July 1999 August 1999 September 1999 October 1999 November 1999 December 1999\n\n(Note: figures in parentheses give an indication, from first reports, of the spread of daily max and min temperatures, min daytime temperatures (occasionally), rainfall and sunshine in the 24 hours ending 1800 GMT.)\n\nBritish Isles weather, January 1999\n\n1999 started with a spell of unsettled weather. On the 1st a southerly wind brought warm and bright conditions to much of the UK, although there were some showers and longer spells of rain, especially in the north. (Torquay 12C, Clacton 6.1h, Tulloch Bridge 21mm.) Blustery showers were more widespread on the 2nd with hail and thunder in parts of south Wales and southern England. At Euston, London, hail up to 15mm diameter was reported. In between the showers it was sunny over much of England (Leeds 5.9h, Tulloch Bridge 36mm) while avalanche warnings were issued in parts of central Scotland as temperatures rose after recent snowfall.\n\nOn the 3rd a rapidly eastward-moving depression brought a spell of heavy rain, with gusts over 50kn in exposed locations, to much of southern England by lunchtime, and heavy snow over the Peak District made driving difficult, while the rest of the UK again had a mixture of sunshine and showers. Later in the day another area of rain with gales approached western districts. Strong winds brought down trees in parts of southern England, and the Whitstable lifeboat capsized in rough seas. 2 people died in West Susses and Somerset. A combination of high tide and gale force winds, caused a breach in the sea defences of the west beach at Selsey, West Sussex, which resulted in local flooding. (Torquay 12C, Loch Glascarnoch 19mm, Swanage 4.6h). At Cardiff Weather Centre there was a pressure rise of 13.7mb in the period 0800 -1100 GMT and gusts over 70kn were recorded in places.\n\nThe 4th saw cloudy but mild conditions (13C was reported at many places at 0600GMT) in the south and southwesterly gales (and gusts over 70 kn) across Scotland, Northern Ireland and N England disrupting flights and ferries (Herne Bay 15C, Lusa 30mm, Aberdeen 2.9h). A severe thunderstorm hit the Western Isles in the early hours of 4th. On Lewis and Harris this caused the entire island to lose power from 0200hrs for two hours. The lightning display was noted as spectacular on Lewis and North Uist, and was one of the most severe thunderstorms to have hit the islands in recent years.\n\nOn the 5th and into the 6th there was some heavy rain over S Scotland and N England with falls of over 100mm in 24 hours in Cumbria leading to local flooding. It was again mild in southern Britain (cloudy on the 5th but sunnier on the 6th) in a SW airflow, but Scotland was colder with some snow falling on higher ground. Extremes on the 5th included Hawarden 15C, Windermere 114mm, Capel Curig 102mm and Jersey 7.3h, and on the 6th Gravesend 16.3C, Eastbourne 7.1h. Later on the 6th a cold front brought an end to the mild spell with sharp temperature falls occurring - 6degC falls in 1 hour at Gloucester and Coventry, and 4degC falls in 30mins at Birmingham and Manchester. Before the temperature fall, 16C was recorded at Kensington and 15.7C at the rooftop site of London Weather Centre - the highest January readings in London since 1841.\n\nThe 7th was a cooler day, with a band of rain moving eastwards across Ireland, then England and Wales, before becoming almost stationary over N England and S Scotland. Northern Scotland was cool and cloudy. (Guernsey 11C, St. Bees Head 22mm, Cromer 3.6h.) Once the rain passed skies cleared giving a widespread ground frost and icy roads, especially over parts of Scotland and Wales early on the 8th. The rain area moved generally SE during the 8th, introducing northerly winds over the British Isles. There were snow showers over a cool Scotland and down the east coast (Penzance 11C, Glascarnoch -5C, Leeming 14mm, Margate 6.1h).\n\nPressure rose on the 9th, which began with sub-zero temperatures in Scotland, N England and Northern Ireland, and icy roads in places. It remained cold with northerly winds, with snow showers over Scotland, Northern Ireland and down the east coast; Cornwall, however, was relatively mild (Penzance 9C, Glascarnoch -6C, Loftus 7mm, Torquay 8.0h). The 10th started cold everywhere; freezing fog all day in parts of Northern Ireland kept temperatures below freezing there in places all day, and there were further falls of snow in the north and down the east coast (many associated with the passing of troughs, including reports of 5cm in east Kent). (Tiree 8C, Belfast -2C max, Glasgow -8C min, Herne Bay 9mm, Newquay 7.7h.)\n\nThe 11th dawned with a widespread air frost over much of the British Isles and with freezing fog in places; in many parts of Ireland the fog lingered until early afternoon. There were further snow showers over Scotland and E England and it was another cold day away from extreme W coastal areas (Penzance 8C, Aviemore -8C, Folkestone 9mm, Torquay 7.8h); At Wilmington (Kent) the temperature did not rise above 3.1C. A southerly airstream bringing rain began spreading from the W over Ireland and W Scotland later in the day, turning to snow over Northern Ireland and mainland Scotland. By dawn on the 12th 9cm of snow had fallen over parts of Northern Ireland; as the front moved east snow fell over England and Wales before turning to rain as the temperature rose. The snow was heavy in parts of Wales, Scotland and N England. (Torquay 11C, Redesdale -7C min, Scarborough 1C max, Capel Curig 34mm, Edinburgh 5.1h).\n\nAfter a cold start in places, rain spread eastwards across the British Isles on the 13th with gale force winds in W and N Scotland. Peak gusts included 60kn at Malin Head, and it was generally cloudy (Torquay 11C, Tulloch Bridge 13mm, Folkestone 1.6h). Following the clearance of the rain, skies cleared and the 14th dawned bright in most places with some snow showers on high ground in Scotland. Frontal rain spread rapidly across the British Isles from the W, followed by squally showers; peak gusts included 64kn at Malin Head and 61kn at Tiree. Snow closed some main roads in Scotland (Torquay 12C, Sella Ness 42mm, Eastbourne 7.2h).\n\nAfter a warm night over England and blustery rain over S Scotland, the 15th saw rain spreading to most parts of England. There were wintry showers over high ground in Scotland giving moderate to heavy falls of snow, and it was windy in S England and Wales with gusts to 60kn. Flooding of roads occurred in Cumbria and S Wales. (Hawarden 13C, Aviemore -6C min, Aviemore -1C max, Eskdalemuir 45mm, Kinloss 1.4h.) In the 24 hours starting at 0900 GMT on the 15th between 50 and 70 mm fell over the mountains of N Wales, while on the island of Harris a severe SW gale in the morning caused widespread minor damage.\n\nAfter heavy rain in S and SE England overnight, the 16th dawned with roads flooded in Worcestershire, S Wales, Herefordshire and Cumbria. Roads were also blocked by snow in Derbyshire and parts of the Scottish highlands. At Weston Coyney (near Stoke-on-Trent) the temperature fell from 8.8C in heavy rain at 0000GMT, to 1.1C at 0200 GMT in heavy snow. There were frequent heavy snow showers leading to blizzards in the Scottish Highlands, with gusts to 60kn leading to road closures and drifting of snow. Lying snow depths of about 30cm were reported at Aviemore. Snow also fell in Northern Ireland, Wales and the Pennines. Rain finally cleared much of SE England by midday, leading to a bright day over England and Wales with a few showers in the W. Six people were rescued from cars near Machynlleth in Powys. Melton Mowbray was cut off for most of the night 15/16th, and blocked storm drains flooded homes in Cranleigh, Surrey. The Leeds to Carlisle train was derailed by a landslide near Kirkby Stephen in Cumbria, and lightning strkes knocked out power in N Scotland and Western Isles. (Shoeburyness 11C, Aviemore 0C max, Aviemore -2C min, Coleshill 29mm, Oxford 6.7h.)\n\nA southwesterly airstream brought some thundery showers to parts of the British Isles on the 17th, with rain in parts of S Scotland, and snow showers over higher ground in the N. (Southampton 10C, Moyola -1C, Loch Glascarnoch 24mm, Bristol 7.5h.) After largely clear overnight skies over England and Wales, the 18th dawned cold. Cloud and rain quickly spread from the W across the British Isles with gusts to 60kn in many places in the W. There was more flooding along River Severn in Herefordshire and Worcestershire. (St Marys 11C, Brize Norton -2C, Capel Curig 24.2mm, Norwich 4.2h.)\n\nThere was more heavy rain in mid and S Wales early on the 19th, spreading to much of W and S England during the day. There were blustery showers in N England and Scotland, although it was generally a mild day. (Hawarden 14C, Aviemore 1C, Eskdalemuir 22mm, Belfast, Newcastle 4.1h.) On the 20th a mild SW wind brought showers to Scotland, with more rain over England moving E. There was some flooding in Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire, and the rain took all day to clear East Anglia and SE England. There were also reports of localised flooding in Towcester, Northamptonshire. The ground was heavily saturated throughout that county, particularly in clay areas, after the recent rains. (Torquay 13C, Aboyne -3C, Little Rissington 25mm, Newquay 6.9h.)\n\nA weak ridge began building over S Britain from the W on the 21st. It was bright and sunny over much of Britain, with some freezing fog patches in SE England at first, and wintry showers over 300m in Scotland. In parts, the fog lingered all day. (Torquay 12C, Shoeburyness -4C, LerwicK 11mm, Fishguard 7.6h.) The 22nd began with a cold, icy, foggy start in England and E Wales. The fog again persisted all day in places, disrupting air traffic over much of SE England. An area of rain moved across Scotland later in the day. (Guernsey 11C, Marham 0C max, Shawbury -7C min, Lusa 24mm, Torquay 8.2h.)\n\nThe fog finally began to clear on the 23rd, which was a dull day with rain spreading from the W over most of the British Isles. (Torquay 12C, Larkhill -5C, Lusa 33mm, Herne Bay 2.5h.) Fog reformed around dawn again on the 24th in parts of S England; however this soon cleared as rain spread over Ireland from the W, and into S Scotland and England. Precipitation amounts were small in S England, with moderate/heavy rain and blustery winds in S Scotland and N England. (Torquay 12C, Pembrey Sands -1C, Castlederg 17mm, Stornoway 3.5h.) In Corsock (Kirkcudbrightshire) 33.2 mm fell in the 24 hours starting 0900 GMT on the 24th, with most of this falling between 1700 and 2300 GMT. During the evening of the 24th, moderate to heavy rain turned to snow and continued into the night over many parts of lowland Scotland, in particular Fife and the Lothians. For example, several cm accumulated in the Lochgelly areas of central Fife at about 150m asl, where roads were impassable.\n\nThe 25th began with a moderate falls of rain in parts of S England. Further bands of showery rain spread to most areas later in the day with falls of sleet and snow above about 300m in the N. It was mild in S England before the rain cleared with 13.5C at Buxton (Norfolk). (Gravesend 14C, Tain Range -3C, Eskdalemuir 43mm, Aberdeen 3.9h.)\n\nThere was rain over Ireland and S England during the morning of the 26th. Later in the day a line of heavier (in places thundery) rain crossed the S, with reports of ball lightning near Winchester around 1630 GMT and heavy hail in Reading during the passage of an active cold front. Gusts reached 60kn at Shoreham. It is also reported that something `just like a tornado' removed the roof from a house near Petersfield with trees and power lines being brought down, while sleet fell around Birmingham. (Littlehampton 12C, Redhill -1C, Bristol 16mm, Stornoway 6.8h.)\n\nAs the rain passed the sky cleared and the 27th saw a cold start in many parts of the N with subzero temperatures and icy roads. Further frontal rain spread across Ireland, and later across all of Britain, with snow on higher ground in Scotland. (Penzance 13C, Shap Fell -3C, Cromer 11mm, Bognor Regis 6.1h.)\n\nThe 28th saw early morning flooding in Staffordshire after overnight rain. A frontal band of rain moved southwestwards during the day over England and Wales, gradually decaying and introducing clearer and cold air from the N, as pressure rose under the growing influence of an anticyclone to the SW of the British Isles. There were a few showers in Scotland, while much of Ireland was rather cloudy with drizzle for much of the day. (Penzance 14C, Baltasound -2C, Capel Curig 43mm, Leeds 7.4h.)\n\nThe final three days of January were anticyconic in nature, and generally cloudy. On the 29th a band of light rain and drizzle crossed Britain from W to E, and there was little sunshine except in the Channel Islands. It was warmer in the W, and relatively cold in the E. (Penzance 12C, Benson -2C, Loch Glascarnoch 5mm, Jersey 5.0h.) The 30th began with patchy fog in places from central Scotland to southern England. Pressure continued to rise, reaching 1041.2 mb at Manston (Kent) by 2100 GMT. There was some sunshine in E Scotland, but elsewhere it was dull with light rain and drizzle in places. (Aberdeen 12C, Manston 1C, High Wycombe 5mm, Aberdeen 6.7.)\n\nThere was further patchy fog around dawn on the 31st, which was cloudy except in the Channel Islands and parts of E Scotland and extreme SE England. Pressure rose to 1042.9 mb at 1200 GMT around Southampton. (Tain Range 12C, Manston -2C, Colwyn Bay 4mm, Jersey 7.9h.)\n\nBritish Isles weather, February 1999\n\nFebruary began with a large anticyclone centred over the SW of England. After a frosty start in parts of Cornwall, NE England and parts of SE Scotland, the 1st was a mainly dry day. It was sunny over Eire, Wales and the SW of England, but the SE was cloudy and there was some light rain over parts of Scotland; fog persisted for a while during the morning in Yorkshire. (Boulmer 12C, Altnaharra -2C, Lerwick 0.7mm, Penzance 8.7h.) 1043.5 mb was recorded over Cornwall during the day.\n\nThe 2nd dawned clear over much of the British Isles, but with cloud over SE England< Northern Ireland and Scotland. The were icy patches on untreated roads, especially in the Midlands. Cloud pushed E to cover most of the country by lunchtime with light rain and drizzle over Scotland and Ireland. (Tain Range 12C, Shawbury -4C, South Uist 4mm, Herne Bay 5.8h.)\n\nThe 3rd was a mainly cloudy day. Rain over Scotland was accompanied by gale force winds along W and N coasts (including gusts to 55 kn at 1500 and 1800 GMT at Kirkwall). It was mild day generally. (Aberdeen 14C, Redhill -1C, Isle of Skye 31mm, Herne Bay 1.8h.)\n\nA mild and cloudy night followed in most parts of the British Isles (overnight minima above 9C were widespread with 11.1C at Dyce), but in N Scotland temperatures began to fall in the early hours of the 4th as the cold front producing the rain moved S. The windy conditions moved S too: gusts of 74kn at Kirkwall and 56kn at Whitby were reported at 0900 GMT. Other gusts included 85kn at Fair Isle at 1745 GMT, 82kn at Kirkwall at 1200 GMT and a gust of 84kn at North Rona. The newspaper flight (a Cessna F406) en route to Stornoway had to turn back to Inverness after encountering a 145 knot headwind. In Yorkshire gusts of 71kn occurred at Leeming and Dishforth and 25km of the A1 road were closed due to 20 overturned lorries. In N and W Scotland 8000 homes were without power and flights and ferries were cancelled. As the front moved S the rain along it decreased and very little was observed in S England. (Hawarden 15C, Lerwick 4C max, Altnaharra 1C min, Altnaharra 16mm, Newcastle 6.7h.)\n\nThe winds died down a little overnight but there were still gales in N England and Scotland as the 5th dawned. There were wintry showers in a brisk NW wind during the day (of snow and/or hail) over Scotland and some northern districts. In the S temperatures fell after a S-moving cold front brought some rain showers. (Littlehampton 12C, Lerwick 3C max, Lerwick -1C min, Capel Curig 11mm, Leuchars 6.7h.)\n\nOn the 6th S-moving troughs brought snow and rain showers to Scotland, while over Ireland, Wales and S England fronts brought some rain. Driving conditions were difficult due to the snow in parts of Scotland, where a fresh wind made it feel very cold. (Torquay 12C, Baltasound 2C max, Lerwick -1C min, Capel Curig 23mm, Cromer and Lowestoft 4.4h.)\n\nSkies cleared rapidly following the passage of the fronts in the S, and overnight temperatures fell to give a widespread frost over the Midlands, northern areas and Scotland. The 7th saw widespread snow showers over many parts of the British Isles, including S England, but more particularly over Scotland and coastal districts as far S as Norfolk and Lancashire. In Scotland some of the higher roads (e.g. A939 and A882) were blocked by snow, although much of the Central Lowlands, including Fife and Dundee areas, escaped the snow showers completely. Many parts of S England were very sunny. Dew points were low during the afternoon over parts of England, e.g. 1500 GMT reports from Leeming (temperature 3C, dewpoint -8C), Herstmonceux (4C, -9C) and Heathrow (5C, -7C). (Torquay 10C, Inverbervie -1C, Spadeadam -5C min, Lerwick 23mm, Hove 9.1h.)\n\nSnow depths reported at 0600 GMT on the 8th included 2cm at Stornoway, 13cm at Dyce and 4cm at Hemsby and Orkney; Fair Isle schools were closed as a result. About 50 schools were also closed in NE Scotland, and many roads in the area were blocked by snow. There were further snow showers in N Scotland and down the NE coast to East Anglia during the day. Buxton (Norfolk) reported a minimum temperature of -6.2C and a grass minimum reading of -15.2C with 5cm of lying snow shortly after dawn. Up to 15cm of snow fell in parts of Wales as an active low crossed S Ireland, SW England and the Channel Islands towards France - it remained mild with rain to the SW of this low centre, but snow fall along its NE flank across S England. During the evening another swathe of snow fell over a wide area from the Thames Valley to Suffolk; the FA Trophy football match Stevenage - Cheltenham was abandoned due to snow at half-time. (Culdrose 11C, Glascarnoch -3C max, Aboyne -11C min, St Mary's Scilly 21mm, Newcastle 8.5h.)\n\nThe 9th dawned with a widespread air frost following the clearance of cloud after evening snowfall. Untreated roads in the Midlands, Wales and S England were reported to be treacherous during the morning rush hour, while in the N road closures included the A171 and A173 in Teeside, the A941 near Aberdeen, and the A9, A836 and A837 in Highland. All schools in Aberdeenshire and outer lying areas of Grampian Region were closed, as were those in other areas (e.g. Withernsea, E Yorkshire). One woman died in Broxburn, near Edinburgh, after she fell on icy pavements. Snow depths at 0600 GMT included 5cm at Kirkwall, 22cm at Kyle of Sutherland, 18cm at Aberdeen, 1cm at Heathrow. The snow depth at Fair Isle was considered impossible to measure, varying from less than 1cm to approx 2m. In Norfolk, very heavy snow showers were reported as reducing the visibility to less than 100m at times. Away from the snow showers in N Scotland and down the coasts the prevailing anticyclone gave quite a lot of sunshine, although the extreme SW was cooler than in recent days with snow showers in Plymouth and evening snow in other parts of the SW and S Wales. At Fair Isle the observer reported that at 1140GMT the wind suddenly increased from 26 kn (gusting 46 kn) to 010 deg 37 kn (gusting 57 kn); visibility fell to virtually zero in a heavy snow and hail shower, with blowing snow. At the same time there was a brilliant blue flash of lightning and crack of thunder. (Penzance 7C, Loch Glascarnoch -1C max, Saughall -8C min, Lerwick 15mm, Bognor Regis 9.0h.)\n\nSnow depths reported at 0600 GMT on the 10th included 25cm at Aberdeen, 10cm at Stornoway and 3cm at Aberporth. Clear skies meant a widespread frost for most parts of the British Isles and most areas then had a sunny day. There was some snow over high ground in Scotland while cloud over Ireland and W Wales gave some light precipitation. Snow showers were reported down the E coast of England too. Belfast Harbour received 3 hours of snow grains during the afternoon, ahead of an approaching warm front. By the evening, snow still lay to a depth of 10 to 20cm on non-S facing slopes of the Mendips, above 200m, and there was a thin covering on the Cotswolds. (Guernsey 9C, Loch Glascarnoch 0C max, Saughall -8C min, Pembrey Sands 10mm, Teignmouth 9.2h.)\n\nCloud, and warmer temperatures, spread to the SE over Scotland, N England, Wales and Ireland by dawn on the 11th, although with lighter winds that recently SE England had a frosty start. By dawn rain was widespread over Scotland and the depth of lying snow at Aberdeen was down to 18cm. The warm front bringing the rain gradually spread E, turning the winds to the SW and giving some sleet, rain and drizzle. (Penzance 10C, Benson -8C, Altnaharra 14mm, Eastbourne and Jersey 8.7h.)\n\nThe 12th dawned with some rain (and occasional sleet) in SE England and a new frontal system over W Scotland giving further rain. In between these two there was a frosty start over England and Wales, although in Scotland the snow was continuing to thaw - the 0600GMT snowdepth at Aberdeen had decreased to 10cm. The rain in the SE soon died out, while that in the W moved slowly SE to reach parts of SE England by midnight. (St Mary's 11C, Shrewsbury and Birmingham -5C, Dundrennan 7mm, Stornoway 5.8h.)\n\nThe 13th began with light rain and drizzle over parts of Central and N England. Patchy fog and frost led to icy roads across parts Northern Ireland and Scotland, with visibility less than 200m in places. The rain spread W to Wales and moved gradually S, to give a sunny day in SE England and East Anglia. In parts of Central and S Scotland mist and fog lingered for much of the day. Air pressure rose to 1037 mb over Central and SE England later in the evening. (Penzance 12C, Aboyne -5C, Cardinham (Cornwall) 8mm, Eastbourne 9.2h.)\n\nThe weather on the 14th was dominated by the SE-ward passage of frontal systems over the British Isles, the effects of which still lingered over S counties of England at midnight. Clear skies before dawn led to a widespread frost over East Anglia, SE and Cent S England. Rain was heavy over Scotland early in the morning, before it turned showery there. (Penzance 11C, Farnborough -7C, Lusa (Skye) 17mm, Lerwick 4.8h.)\n\nRain cleared S England before dawn on the 15th, and clearing skies under a weak ridge led to slight frost in sheltered areas of S England. A warm front spread cloud and rain across Scotland by dawn, and then moved over N England. Temperatures rose to 10C over Scotland, before a following cold front brought more rain. Most of the British Isles remained cloudy during the day. (Poole 12C, Benson -3C, Lerwick 12mm, Jersey 7.2h.)\n\nA NW airstream behind the cold front affected the whole of the British Isles by dawn on the 16th. Passing troughs brought heavy snow over Scotland with gales; gusts over 50 kn were recorded there. Scottish ferry services were disrupted due to the winds. One person died on the Cairngorm Mountains after spending the night in the open, and one person died on Ben Nevis as a result of weather conditions. Snow reports included drifts to 40cm at Fair Isle at 1415GMT (where at 1515GMT a wind gusting to 50kn with nil visibility at times in blowing snow was also reported), and a depth at 1800GMT of 10cm at Aviemore. Ireland, Wales and England had sunny intervals with a few showers, the latter mainly over Ireland and other W districts. (Southsea 11C, Baltasound 0C max, Lerwick -3C min, Lerwick 15mm, Hunstanton 8.6h.)\n\nDuring the 17th a warm front pushed W, over Ireland in the morning and passing all but NE Scotland and extreme E districts of England by midnight. Rain (and sleet/snow on high ground) fell as the warm front passed. One person died near Drumochter after being lost overnight on the hills there. Snow depths at 0600GMT included 7cm at Kirkwall, 12cm at Aviemore, and 4cm at Aberdeen. (Guernsey 11C, Aviemore 1C max, Lybster -4C min, Lerwick 9mm, Norwich 5.6h.)\n\nThe front lingered over E districts of Britain early on the 18th, then moved E as further frontal rain spread E over Ireland and into Wales and W districts of Scotland and England by midnight. As the temperature rose any lying snow began to thaw rapidly, even over high ground in Scotland. (Poole 13C, Baltasound -4C, Warcop 12mm, Bognor Regis 4.2h.)\n\nCold fronts moved S on the 19th introducing a colder W airflow over all of the British Isles by midnight, but not before some mild conditions had been experienced in the southern half of England. There was some heavy rain in SW England, while later in the day snow showers were reported in parts of N and W Scotland. In Wells (Somerset) there was drizzle or rain for most of the day (with a break of only about an hour during the morning); in the 24 hours ending 1900GMT, the total fall was 32.3 mm. (Wittering 15C, Loch Glascarnoch 1C, Cardinham 37mm, Aberdeen 8.5h.)\n\nSunny spells in between bands of rain affected N areas, while England, Wales and S Ireland were mainly dry on the 20th (Guernsey, Torquay 13C, Stornoway 11mm, Eastbourne 8.7h.)\n\nDuring the morning of the 21st an area of rain crossed S parts of Ireland, Wales and England; showers followed and these included reports of hail and thunder (with sleet observed at Chalfont St. Giles during the evening). Over Scotland and N parts of England showers of snow and hail were frequent, with gusts over 50kn being reported. There were moderate to heavy accumulations of snow in places, with roads in the Scottish borders reported to be treacherous in places by the end of the day. At Emley Moor (nr. Huddersfield) heavy snow showers with 50kn gusts produced blizzard conditions with level snow 10cm deep on many roads by midnight. (Poole 13C, Wick 2C max, Lerwick 0C min, Eskdalemuir 14mm, Leuchars 6.9h.)\n\nBy dawn on the 22nd there were numerous reports of snow-caused road closures in the Scottish borders, Cumbria, Pennines and N Scotland. The snow depth at Aviemore was 13cm at 0600GMT, with 3cm at Eskdalemuir. In Central Scotland some places had their first snowfall of the winter overnight, with about 1 to 5cm lying over the Forth Valley, around the Callander, Stirling and Falkirk area. At Wolverhampton snow lay over 1cm deep during the morning and there were reports of 7mm diameter hail there later in the day. Fresh, blustery N to NW winds brought frequent wintry showers to parts of the British Isles, mainly over Scotland but also as far S as S England. In between the showers there was plenty of sunshine; gusts over 30kn were widespread with gusts over 40kn across many parts of Scotland. (Torquay 11C, Tulloch Bridge 2C max, Drumalbin -1C min, Lerwick 13mm, Glasgow 9.6h.)\n\nThe winds gradually decreased overnight and became more westerly (and then southerly over Ireland) by dawn on the 23rd, as warm frontal cloud, rain and rising temperatures began affecting Ireland and W Wales. The 0600GMT snow depth at Aviemore was 12cm; in Moray and Aberdeenshire there were still some closed roads and driving was difficult in many areas of Scotland and N England due to icy conditions. By midday rain was falling in SW England, while it remained sunny in parts of East Anglia and SE England until late afternoon. There were reports of snow/sleet from Cent S England to S Scotland during the evening as the rain band advanced slowly E across the whole of England and wales, and S scotland by midnight. In the extreme SW England temperatures continued to rise (above 10C) during the evening. (St. Marys 10C, Tulloch Bridge 2C max, -3C min, Lough Fea 7mm, Folkestone 9.2h.)\n\nThe rain and sleet turned to drizzle over the S half of England by dawn on the 24th, with some light snow over N England and parts of East Anglia; clear skies over Scotland led to some icy roads there with temperatures being particularly low in the Highlands, although it was relatively mild over Ireland, SW England and S Wales by dawn. It remained cloudy over S Wales and SW England all day; cloud initially over NE England and East Anglia cleared slowly during the afternoon. Wales, much of Ireland, and England had a mainly dry except for some morning drizzle over S England, while increasing cloud brought rain and rising temperatures to N and Cent Scotland and N Ireland. Many parts of Ireland were cloudy and misty all day. (Guernsey 14C, Aviemore -9C, Isle of Man 19mm, Anglesey 9.3h.)\n\nBy dawn on the 25th it was cloudy over all the British Isles, with rain and drizzle over Scotland, N England and N Ireland. Parts of SE England and East Anglia had a frost under clear skies that existed for a while overnight. The 0600 GMT snow depth at Aviemore was 4 cm, and was falling rapidly. The rain remained for much of the day over almost all of the British Isles with some light rain and drizzle over Ireland, Scotland and N parts of England and Wales. With winds from the SW it was mild everywhere, especially in Scotland. (Kinloss 13C, Marham -4C, Lusa 18mm, Ross-on-Wye 4.6h.)\n\nA band of rain associated with a SE-moving cold front crossed the British Isles on the 26th, although the rain was still falling in S England by midnight; a trough brought another area of rain and showers following the cold front, and although it was cloudy over much of England and Wales, parts of E Scotland were quite sunny. (Coltishall 13C, Redesdale 1C, Chivenor 14mm, Aberdeen 8.1h.)\n\nThe 27th was a showery day over the British Isles, once rain over S England had largely cleared by midday. Some of the showers were thundery over Ireland, W Scotland and parts of E Wales and N England, with falls of snow over high ground in Scotland; it was gusty, with gusts of 40kn, over Scotland. There were reports of a localised severe hailstorm in the Dublin area around 1630 GMT, while near Fife heavy snow in the evening brought the snow line down to 200m. (Torquay 12C, Topcliffe 0C, Lusa 26mm, Aberdeen 9.3h.)\n\nFresh to strong SW and W winds were the main feature of the 28th. Moderate to heavy rain over Scotland at first turned to sleet and snow later in the day. Ireland, Wales and England began dry, but rain moved E to affect most areas by midnight, with some thunder over NW extremities of Ireland. Gusts up to 60 kn were reported from NE England, and by the evening bridges in Cumbria and Newcastle, along with the Forth Road Bridge, were among those closed to high-sided vehicles. (Guernsey 13C, Aviemore 0C, Strathallan 39mm, Hastings 8.1h.)\n\nBritish Isles weather, March 1999\n\nMarch got off to a mild start over S England, S Wales and S Ireland on the 1st as a depression and trailing fronts, moving E, brought wet weather to many parts of the British Isles. Temperatures of 11C were reported from many places in S England at 0600 GMT. Scotland remained mostly dry (apart from rain in the S during the morning), and was very sunny in places. The rain over the remainder of the British Isles turned to drizzle later in the day under a warm sector, and although readings of 14 to 16C were reported in places in the Midlands, East Anglia and Lincolnshire, it remained much cooler in Scotland and parts of N England. (Barbourne 16C, Aviemore and Aboyne -1C, Capel Curig 41mm, Kinloss 9.1h.)\n\n2ndFollowing overnight rain and drizzle across almost all the British Isles, roads in the Welshpool (Powys) area were affected by flooding, while the River Afan was running high at Cwmavon. In Wells 32 mm of rain fell on the 1st and 2nd combined. It was a warm night in S England, Wales, the Midlands and Ireland with 1800 - 0600 GMT minima including Shawbury 10.0C, Heathrow 11.1C, Manston 10.2C, Yeovilton 11.3C and Cork 11.2C, although minima in Scotland were much lower. At Forest Hill (London), the minimum of 11.3C was higher than any March value for the past 25 years with the exception of 1981,1990 and 1998. It was a mainly cloudy day in most places, with widespread rain (heavy over Wales and W parts of England) and sleet and snow in addition over high ground in Scotland. It was very mild in S England, with maxima including 15.4C Reading University AWS site, 15.3C Maidenhead, 15.1C Heathrow, 14.8C Brize Norton; gusts of 30 to 40 kn were reported from SW England for much of the day (44 kn at Valley at 2100 GMT). (Aboyne -4C min, Capel Curig 47mm, Tiree 3.2h.)\n\nThe morning of the 3rd brought reports of a blockage along the A5087 Ulverston to Barrow coast road due to floodings, and of river flood alerts in S Wales and along the English-Welsh border. Heavy rain and blustery showers affected many areas of the British Isles at some time during the day, and it turned cooler in the W later as SW winds turned to a NW direction. Snow and sleet fell over high ground in N England and Scotland. (Guernsey 12C, Aboyne -3C, Sennybridge 29mm, Guernsey 8.4h.)\n\nFollowing some heavy snowfalls on high ground in Scotland several roads there were blocked by the morning of the 4th, including the A939 between Cockbridge and Tomintoul, and between Ballater and Corgraff, and the A9 at Slochd. In addition, rescue teams were searching the Cairngorm and Ben Nevis mountains for walkers stranded in whiteout conditions. The SW wind over the SE corner of the UK turned northerly during the morning giving a cool day with some rain in the E and showers in the W, these being blustery in Scotland. Snow and sleet fell over high ground in Scotland, N England and N Wales. (Jersey 9C, Aviemore 0C, Newcastle 26mm, Lerwick 7.5h.)\n\nFollowing clearing skies, the 5th began with icy roads in areas of S Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. Sleet and snow fell over the Pennines, E England and the Midlands at times during the day, where is remained fairly cloudy, while there were occasional rain showers over Ireland and Scotland with snow over high ground. (Torquay 9C, Buxton 2C max, Trawscoed -2C min, Scarborough 31mm, Lerwick 8.6h.)\n\nA northerly airflow with embedded troughs continued to blow on the 6th. It was dull over much of the E half of England and Scotland, with snowfall in many E areas and over the highlands; falls were heavy at times in N England and over the Pennines, leading to the curtailment of sporting fixtures such as the FA Cup 6th round match at Barnsley. Flooding occurred in Pickering (N Yorkshire). Wintry showers were widepread, with hail in Jersey and Penzance, for example, although in some W areas, including much of Ireland, it was very sunny. On Dartmoor some heavy snow showers led to a covering of snow by the evening although on the Marlborough Downs snow fell without settling above 200m; in Stoke-on-Trent snow accumulated to a depth of 5cm at midday before thawing during the afternoon, while at Keyworth an accumulation of 3cm after two hours of heavy snow also subsequently melted rapidly. (Bognor Regis 10C, Birmingham 2C max, Biggar -5C min, Aultbea 15mm, Weymouth 9.2h.)\n\nClear skies over Ireland clouded over by mid-morning on the 7th and the remainder of the day was generally cloudy over the entire British Isles. Rain and drizzle was widespread over much of England and Wales, heavy at times in NE England. Ireland was mainly dry, while there were some wintry showers over Scotland. Snow led to the blocking of some roads in Yorkshire and NE England. (Penzance 11C, Buxton 2C max, Sennybridge -1C, Topcliffe 22mm, Penzance 10.0h.)\n\nLittle cloud over much of Scotland led to an early air frost in many places there by dawn on the 8th, followed by a day with sunny spells. England, Wales and Ireland were mainly cloudy, with rain and drizzle falling in the NE and E, under an easterly wind. There was also some light rain in SW England around midday, which moved slowly E in the evening. Snow caused the closures of the A6024 between Holmfirth and Glossop, and the A689 at Killhope (Durham) during the morning. (Herne Bay 9C, Saughall -6C, Guernsey 9mm, Tiree 7.6h.) Following heavy rain over a period of several days in North Yorkshire (e.g. 130mm in 5 days at Fylingdales Moor), a red flood alert continued in effect for the River Derwent in North Yorkshire between Stamford Bridge and Elvington; flooding was worst in Malton where the river was 3.5m above normal levels. The geographical extent can be seen in this figure, provided by the York Evening Press. The flooding by the river was the worst since 1931. Several roads in the area were impassable due to floodwaters, including the A64 at Malton, the A66 between South Bank and Grangetown (Cleveland) and the A1046 in Stockton (Cleveland).\n\nThe 9th was another generally cloudy day over England and Wales, with early-morning rain in the S clearing to the E by early afternoon. There was rain over E Scotland, NE England, the Midlands and East Anglia for most of the day, with sleet and snow over parts of NE England, the Pennines and the Midlands for a while; two hours of snowfall led to 5cm of lying snow in Sheffied by midday. W Scotland was sunny following a moderate frost in places, as was N Ireland, although S Ireland remained mainly cloudy. (Guernsey 11X, Buxton 2C max, Loch Glascarnoch -5C, Coningsby 12mm, Stornoway 9.0h.)\n\nThe persistent area of low pressure to the E of the British Isles that was the reason for the persistent rainfall during the previous week can be seen in these maps. At Marton (Cleveland) the rainfall total for the 10-day period 28 February to 9 March was 123.6mm, compared to the March average of just 26.7mm for 1991 to 1998.\n\nSome roads in Cleveland and North Yorkshire remained severely flooded on the 10th while recent heavier rains further south (10mm in 12 hours at Lincoln and 34mm in 24 hours at Keyworth) led to flooding of the A610 in Nottinghamshire. Overnight snow on the A1 S of Grantham led to a slippery road surface (with 3cm of snow cover) that caused some minor accidents early in the day. In E parts of England there was further precipitation overnight 9/10th, although in other areas clearing skies for a while before dawn led to air frost, mist or fog in places. There was rain/sleet/snow in East Anglia during the morning; elsewhere it was mainly dry although in the evening rain spread from the W to parts of W Scotland. (Lee-on-Solent 11C, Bournemouth -5C, Watnall 19mm, Weymouth 9.7h.)\n\nThe 11th saw a frosty start in places, with icy conditions on some roads in Lancashire leading to early morning accidents. There were morning mist and fog patches in eastern England. Scotland and Ireland were generally cloudy with rain and showers, especially in the W, while England and Wales clouded over from the SW, the cloud being followed by light or moderate rain. (Jersey 13C, Leconfield -4C, Stornoway 21mm, Skegness 7.1h.)\n\nRoads in North Yorkshire and Cleveland remained flooded by the morning of the 12th, and rain over England cleared in the S and Midlands to be followed there by mist and fog patches in places. Eastward moving fronts gave rain during the day to Scotland, N England and Northern Ireland, while rain (and rather misty conditions) pushed into S England around midday. This rain was heavy in places, e.g. in Yate (Gloucestershire) 22mm fell in 7 hours, leading to some local road flooding; there were also reports of thunder. At Forest Hill (London) the afternoon maximum of 15.7C was in contrast to values below 10C during the previous 8 days. (London 16C, Redhill 1C, South Uist Range 14mm, Colwyn Bay 9.3h.)\n\nThe wet and misty conditions (e.g. 23mm fell during the night at Wells) cleared from S England overnight, and here the 13th was a mild day. After a cold start with icy patches on some roads in N Scotland, rising temperatures led to melting of lying snow and an avalanche in the Ben Nevis range that killed one climber. It was very sunny in many areas. (Gravesend 15C, Loch Glascarnoch -4C, Exmouth 24mm, Colwyn Bay 10.2h.)\n\nA ridge built over S parts of England on the 14th, where early morning clear skies led to a widespread ground frost before another mild afternoon developed. Cloud in Scotland and N England was accompanied by some light rain, while over the remainder of the British Isles there were sunny spells. (Poole 15C, Bournemouth -1C, Loch Glascarnoch 13mm, Bognor Regis 10.7h.)\n\nAnticyclonic conditions persisted over southern areas on the 15th while in the N eastward-moving fronts brought spells of rain. Most of England and Wales had a warm and sunny day (after early ground frost in places), although parts of NE England and East Anglia were rather cloudy. Ireland was generally cloudy with rain in the N, and rain in Scotland was heavy at times. (London 16C, Bournemouth -2C, Lusa (Skye) 46mm, Bognor Regis 10.6h.) Pressure rose to around 1030 mb during the late morning in SE and cent S England.\n\nThe 16th was another mild day over S England, N Wales, the Midlands, East Anglia and S Ireland, although clear skies before dawn led to a ground frost in parts of Cent S England. N England, the Midlands and Wales had some overnight rain which persisted in some parts of N England and N Wales until early afternoon. Scotland and N parts of Ireland were generally cloudy, with rain and drizzle (especially in the W). (Hawarden 18C, Bournemouth -2C, Isle of Skye 34mm, Bognor Regis 10.5h.) Later in the evening it turned cloudy over most parts of the United Kingdom.\n\nFollowing the clearance of cloud over most of England and Wales overnight, the 17th dawned with fog patches in parts of S England, Yorkshire, N Wales and Cheshire. Persistent cloud (with some light rain) over Scotland meant a warm night there - overnight minimum temperatures included 8.7C at Kirkwall, 9.1C at Stornoway and 10.2C at Dyce. At 0000 GMT pressure readings of 1032 mb were reported from Devon. Once the fog had cleared it was a warm and sunny day over S Wales, S England, East Anglia and the Midlands; in E Scotland temperatures rose to as high as 18.6C (at Dyce) once the cloud cleared, although it remained cloudy and therefore cooler in N England and S Scotland. At Bristol (Totterdown) the maximum temperature of 20.6C was reported to be the first reading above 20C in the area since 1965. In the south there were some large diurnal ranges, e.g. 15.9C (max 19.1C, min 3.2C) at Cirencester. (Shobden 21C, Leconfield 1C, Kirkwall 4mm, Penzance 10.8h.)\n\nThe 18th saw a slight drop in temperatures over England compared to recent days, the wind now blowing from a NW direction over the entire British Isles. Early morning fog patches in S England cleared to give some sunshine before cloud spread to much of the area by lunchtime. Over N parts of Ireland, N England and Scotland overnight light rain cleared by mid-morning to give sunny spells with a few showers, while the Midlands and much of Ireland was genarlly cloudy all day. (Bournemouth 16C, Shoreham 2C, Tulloch Bridge 9mm, Newcastle 10.5h.) Low relative humidity were recorded during the afternoon in S England, with 1500 GMT temperatures/dew points of (10.8C, -2.5C) at Brize Norton, (12.2C, -1.3C) at Boscombe Down and (12.8C, 0.0C) at Dunkeswell, for example.\n\nThe 19th was another day with fresh NW winds over the British Isles. Scotland had a mixture of sunshine and showers, while over England and Wales clear conditions overnight were followed by developing cloud during the late morning in most places. Ireland was mainly dry with sunny periods. (Great Malvern 14C, Yeovilton -1C, Lerwick 4mm, Scarborough 10.4h.)\n\nThe 20th dawned cloudy in most parts of the British Isles, with the exception of a relatively cloudfree area over SW and Cent S England at dawn. This area, too, rapidly clouded over and it then remained generally cloudy over the British Isles with the exception of the Channel Islands. There was light rain and drizzle over Scotland for most of the day, while an area of frontal rain pushed into Ireland, then to Wales and W England, during the afternoon and evening. At Cirencester the first 16 days of the month resulted in just 2 air frosts, but a ground frost occurred every morning from the 4th to 20th. (Poole 14C, Benson -2C, Kirkwall 11mm, Guernsey 8.7h.)\n\nPressure fell rapidly (falls of 5 to 7 mb in 3h were common) over most of the British Isles during the morning of the 21st as a depression tracked from W of the Outer Hebrides to the S North Sea; this was accompanied by an area of rain that subsequently cleared SE England around midday. As pressure started to rise, the wind veered from a southerly to a N or NW direction, and the remainder of the day saw blustery showers almost everywhere - these being of hail and snow in Orkney and Shetland. There was a report of a thunderstorm with hail near Canterbury around 1400 GMT. There were gales in exposed areas, with gusts to 50 kn in N areas. (Poole 14C, Loch Glascarnoch 2C, Capel Curig 23mm, Torquay 8.2h.)\n\nThe winds moderated overnight, and clear skies over S Scotland led to a widespread air frost there by dawn on the 22nd; much of the rest of the British Isles (except for SE Ireland and the Channel Islands) had a cloudy night with light rain and drizzle in E England. Another area of rain spread to most of Scotland and Ireland during the morning from the W, continuing for the remainder of the day over much of Scotland. During the afternoon light rain also crossed over England, although amounts were small there. (Bournemouth 12C, Biggar -2C, Kirkwall 12mm, Guernsey 8.9h.)\n\nThe 23rd was a cloudy day over much of the British Isles, with the exception of Cent S and SE England where there were sunny spells. There was light rain and drizzle over Scotland, N parts of Ireland and England before dawn, and over the N Midlands and parts of East Anglia shortly after dawn. In Caithness there were reports of 5cm of new lying snow, down to sea level in places. The rain largely cleared from England (except the extreme N) during early afternoon but continued over Scotland all day. (Poole 16C, Wick -1C, Buxton 16mm, Eastbourne 10.3h.)\n\nRain and drizzle overnight in Scotland moved slowly S and became less extensive during the 24th, affecting an area stretching from Cumbria to Cornwall by the late evening. Over Scotland and NW Ireland this clearance led to showers and sunny spells, while the remainder of the British isles was generally cloudy. (Marham 14C, Baltasound 3C, Sella Ness 18mm, Kinloss 9.5h.)\n\nTemperatures fell under clear skies to give a slight frost over parts of N Ireland and Scotland by dawn on the 25th, although the night was cloudy over the rest of the British Isles with light rain from Scilly to the Isle of Man and NE England. Sunny spells and showers during the day over Scotland and Ireland contrasted with cloudy skies and pulses of rain over England and Wales, some of the rain being heavy in N England and the N Midlands. (Gravesend 15C, Castlederg -2C, Coleshill 10mm, Kinloss 10.3h.)\n\nThe 26th brought rain most places at some time suring the day, with fronts or troughs being analysed over most areas at sometime during the day. There was a frost at first in parts of E Scotland, then rain amounts were generally slight over most areas. The exception was SE England, the rain here falling from fronts associated with a NE-ward moving low centre. A brief but heavy hailstorm was reported in Birmingham in the late afternoon. (Poole 14C, Aboyne -3C, Redhill 12mm, Torquay 10.1h.)\n\nClearing skies overnight led to a ground frost in many places on the 27th from S England to N Scotland. The exception to this was the Midlands where a persistent trough gave light rain until mid-afternoon in places. S England had a very sunny day, as did parts of S and E Scotland. Other areas of the British Isles had a rather cloudy day, with frontal rain falling in N Scotland. (Bristol Weather Centre 15C, Aboyne -4C, Kirkwall 7mm, Torquay 12.2h.)\n\nA weak ridge developed temporarily over the British Isles overnight, resulting in a cloudless night in many areas, with a widespread ground frost. By dawn on the 28th, however, frontal rain had reached most of Ireland from the W, and this pushed E to affect most of Scotland, Wales, NW England and SW England by midnight. Most of SE England and East Anglia had a very sunny day before the associated cloud arrived, however. (London 16C, Aboyne -6C, Tulloch Bridge 19mm, Hunstanton 11.0h.)\n\nExtensive overnight cloud prevented air frosts for the night ending on the 29th, and most of the British Isles reported rain during the day. High minimum temperatures for the 12 hours ending 0600 GMT included Leeming 10.3C, Ringway 9.9C and St Mawgan 10.3C, although it was a mild night in most places. The rain was heavy in S Scotland and parts of SW England; the best of the sunshine was confined to Ireland, Scotland and NW England following the clearance of the rain. However, there were heavy showers in this clearance over Scotland, with thunder at Glenrothes at 1825 GMT, and torrential rain near Glasgow airport at 1600 GMT. (Glenanne, Jersey 16C, Redhill 4C, Eskdalemuir 51mm, Tiree 7.9h.)\n\nIt was mainly cloudy with light rain in S England, Wales, the Midlands and East Anglia on the 30th, after another mild night. The cloud pushed into N England during the day, but it remained mainly dry here. Scotland and Ireland had a mainly dry and sunny day, although there were a few rain showers in W Scotland. (Hawarden 17C, Lough Fea 4C, Tulloch Bridge 13mm, Edinburgh 11.1h.)\n\nCloud and light rain (associated with a N-moving warm front) pushed into N England before dawn on the 31st and during the day progressed into N Scotland. Ahead of the front there was a slight air frost in parts of Scotland, but in the Midlands and S England there was another mild night, with 12-hour minima at 0600 GMT including 9.7C at Shawbury, 9.9C at Heathrow and 9.5C at Hurn. As the cloud cleared behind the front temperatures rose to near 20C in many places (20.0C at Buxton, Norfolk; 19.8C at Romford, Essex). (London 20C, Aviemore -2C, Teignmouth 6mm, Clacton 10.4h.)\n\nBritish Isles weather, April 1999\n\nSmall cloud amounts over much of England and Wales led to a ground frost in places there by dawn on the 1st. Cloudy overnight conditions in Scotland and Ireland persisted for much of the day. This cloud pushed into wales and much of W England during the day, but the E had sunny spells. A SE breeze resulted in a cool day in some E coast districts, although it was warm in S England away from the coast. (Northolt 21C, Tynemouth 9C max, Farnborough 3C min, Stornoway 6mm, Clacton 11.4h.)\n\nOn the 2nd patchy bands of rain moved from the SW to NE across Ireland, Wales and England, becoming weaker as they moved N. In the Gloucester area there was a spectacular display of lightning around 0300 GMT from a line of thunderstorms that developed along a cold front. Cloud in Scotland cleared overnight to give a light frost in places by dawn, followed by warm conditions during the day except along the E coast where a cool sea kept temperatures low again. Away from the rain, England and Wales remained mainly cloudy. (Lusa 20C, Aboyne -1C, Prestatyn 14mm, Cromer 9.9h.)\n\nThere were fog patches by dawn on the 3rd in parts of S Scotland, N England, the Midlands and Cent S England with visibility down to 100m in places. Fog persisted in places nearly all day along the NE coast of England. During the day much of S England was cloudy with light rain and drizzle, while in N England and Scotland light rain gradually died out. (Leeds 19C, Tynemouth 7C max, Altnaharra -3C, Jersey 7mm, Lerwick 9.2h.)\n\nThe 4th was a cloudy day in most parts of the British Isles. Clearing skies overnight led to fairly widespread fog patches in Scotland and N England by dawn. Further bands of light rain and drizzle spread across much of the British Isles from the SW during the day. (Cleethorpes 19C, Aboyne 0C, Capel Curig 9mm, Cleethorpes, Lerwick and Scarborough 7.3h.)\n\nThe 5th saw a continuation of the recent mild, cloudy conditions over the British Isles with fronts and troughs bringing rain and drizzle to most areas. There was mist and fog in places around dawn, notably in SW Wales where visibility fell to 100m in places. (Chivenor 18C, Lerwick 6C, Lusa 15mm, Jersey 5.5h.)\n\nThere was rain (some heavy) overnight in Scotland, and light rain in S England the Midlands by dawn on the 6th. During the daytime it remained mainly cloudy across the British Isles with the two rain areas gradually clearing as the wind veered round to a W direction everywhere. (Herne Bay 19C, Aviemore 6C, Eskdalemuir 29mm, Leeds 8.0h.)\n\nPressure rose slowly during the 7th as a weak ridge became established over the British Isles. There were rain showers over Scotland and light rain and drizzle over Ireland. England and Wales were mainly cloudy but dry, with sunny intervals. (Boulmer 15C, Redesdale 4C, Loch Glascarnoch 9mm, Newcastle 9.0h.)\n\nSkies cleared over parts of England and Wales overnight by dawn on the 8th leading to a touch of ground frost in places, although Scotland remained cloudy with light rain falling from a warm front. Light rain and drizzle that affected Ireland overnight moved E and many areas of England and Wales received some light precipitation during the day. (Aberdeen 20.2C, Benson 0C, Lowestoft 4mm, Folkestone 10.3h.)\n\nA weak ridge of high pressure over the British Isles on the 9th resulted in a mainly dry day. The exception to this was Scotland, where there was light rain in the S overnight, and light rain and drizzle in places in the W and N by day. Ireland, Wales and England were mainly cloudy in the morning, but they became sunnier in the afternoon. (Great Malvern 20C, Fylingdales 7C, Stornoway 4mm, Shrewsbury 7.5h.)\n\nA cold front brought a period of mainly light rain to most places across the British Isles on the 10th as it moved E, preced by thickening cloud and followed by clearer skies and showers in W districts. Fresh to strong winds over Scotland and Ireland were accompanied by gusts to 40 kn. (Skegness 16C, Benson 6C, Sella Ness 6mm, Fishguard 10.5h.)\n\nMainly clear skies overnight led to lower temperatures than of late by dawn on the 11th over much of the British Isles. However, thickening cloud over Scotland and Ireland was followed by rain by lunchtime in W districts there; the rain continued to move SE to affect most of England and by midnight. (Poole 16C, Altnaharra 1C, Tiree 11mm, Isle of Wight 12.0h.)\n\nThe 12th was dominated by a showery NW airstream with embedded troughs, giving heavy showers of rain and hail, and occasional thunder, to most parts of the British Isles. The thunder was mainly restricted to N England (especially Yorkshire), the East Midlands and East Anglia, and SE England. There were gales in exposed areas in the W, and gusts to 50kn in S Ireland and SW England. At 1500 GMT there was a report of a funnel cloud near the Humber Bridge. (Herne Bay 15C, Lerwick 6C max, Wick 1C min, Capel Curig 59mm, Bognor Regis 9.9h.)\n\nThe 13th did not feel like a spring day over most of the British Isles. A depression crossing from N of Ireland to East Anglia was accompanied by gales on its S flank, and snow and hail showers. In Fife snow made driving difficult during the morning rush-hour. These wintry showers (quite blustery with gusts to 50 kn in places) persisted after the passage of the low, and were felt over most parts of the British Isles - although in SW England and S Ireland precipitation was mostly of rain. In Chelmsford hail the size of marbles fell around 1050 GMT, while cricket at Durham was cancelled due to a snow-covered ground. Later in the evening, skies cleared everywhere. (Penzance 13C, Loch Glascarnoch 2C max, Lerwick -1C min, Buxton 13mm, Torquay 11.2h.)\n\nThe 14th dawned with 6cm of lying snow at Dublin at 0600 GMT (which had mostly melted by 1300 GMT), and a widespread air frost following clear skies overnight. Morning cloud in SW England and S Wales was accompanied by heavy snow for a while in places and wintry showers were widespread during the rest of the day in W districts and over Ireland. Thunder was reported in NE England, although many E districts remained sunny for most of the day. At Weston Coyney (Staffs.) the minimum of -4.2C was the lowest in April since -4.2C on 11 April 1978. In one hour from 2230 GMT 3.5cm of snow fell in 1 hour at Bradninch (Devon), while at Wells (Somerset) snow fell from about 0700 GMT to 1400 GMT. A waterspout was observed from 1600 to 1605 GMT outside Rocquaine Bay (approx. 1 mile SW of Pleinmont Point) off Guernsey; it was moving S ahead of a heavy shower of soft hail. At Pentlow (Essex) a tornado lifted a dog out of its kennel and destroyed a few greenhouses. (Torquay 11C, Loch Glascarnoch 3C max, Redesdale -7C min, Altnaharra 19mm, Aberdeen 12.2h.)\n\nThe 15th dawned with some roads closed in Wales (A4107, A965, M4) and Scotland (A93). 0600 GMT snowdepths included 2cm at Eskdalemuir, while on the Mendips snow lay approximately 10cm deep during the morning. Clear skies led to a widespread frost with minima including -4.2C at Buxton (Norfolk). Early rain and drizzle over Central and S Scotland and N England largely cleared by early afternoon, but scattered showers continued almost everywhere for most of the day. These showers were wintry (of snow or hail) as far S as Hampshire with reports of 5cm of snow on the Isle of Wight. A funnel cloud was observed near Jersey at around 0700 GMT. (Northolt 12C, Sella Ness 5C max, Aviemore 20mm, Penzance 11.7h.)\n\nSnowfall overnight led to blocked roads in Cumbria (A592 Kirkstone Pass) and West Yorkshire (M62, A6024) by dawn on the 16th, while in S England light winds allowed patchy, but thick, fog to form. By the afternoon there was a covering of 10-15 cm of snow on the top of Holme Moss (Yorks). Heavy thundery rain fell in Lincolnshire during the afternoon, and there was thunder in the Midlands. Northern England experienced rain or snow for much of the day from a persistent trough, while snow showers were fell over the higher ground in Scotland. Elsewhere, it was mainly dry but with scattered (often heavy) showers especially in SW Ireland, S Wales and SW England later in the day. (Poole 13C, Bingley 2C max, Tulloch Bridge -6C min, Waddington 28mm, Tiree 12.5h.)\n\nClearing skies overnight led to a frost in places by dawn on the 17th; the exception to this was N England where a slow-moving trough continued to give some rain. In S England there were fog patches by dawn. This wet, cloudy area persisted all day, spreading to the Midlands, North Wales (for a while) and East Anglia. Many areas had a day with sunny spells (although some heavy, at times thundery, showers occurred in places) although low pressure over Scotland resulted in some light rain with snow on higher ground. Near Dunstable, a glider was hit and downed by reported ball lightning which flew out from cumulonimbus - the glider was under a clear sky at the time - the two pilots managed to bale out with only minor injuries. (Bognor Regis 14C, Buxton (Derbyshire) 5C max, Altnaharra -4C min, Coningsby 30mm, Aspatria 11.5h.)\n\nThe 18th saw a continuation of the general weather pattern, with a slack pressure gradient and troughs, this time over W districts and in the E. Further rain in East Anglia overnight led to the flooding of the A134 by daybreak in the Bury St. Edmunds area, and along the A11 near Newmarket. After early fog patches, in S England and the Midlands, cloud soon developed in most areas and there were further heavy showers with snow, rain and hail. A thunderstorm with snow and heavy hail near Southend around 1800 GMT resulted in about 7 to 10cm of snow and ice on the A127 road, and several accidents. The best of the sunshine was over Ireland and in W districts after the clearance of early cloud. Following recent falls some small patches of snow were still visible on the hills to the W and NW of Newport and Cwmbran (above about 350m amsl) in S Wales. (Penzance 13C, Baltasound 5C max, Aboyne -4C min, Margate 21mm, Tiree 12.7h.)\n\nSkies cleared everywhere by dawn on the 19th (leading to a frost in places), except in East Anglia and Kent, and in parts of E Scotland where there was some light rain. Cloud soon developed in most places with the SE wind hearlding the approach of a frontal system from the SW. The system brought rain to SW England and S Ireland by midday, and the rain pushed into most of S Ireland, S Wales, Cent S England by midnight. There were showers of rain or snow of Cent and N Scotland, but the remainder of the British Isles was largely dry. (Colwyn Bay 13C, Castlederg -5C, Manston 21mm, Tiree 13.1h.)\n\nThe rain continued to spread NE during the night and by dawn on the 20th covered all but N and Cent Scotland. By midnight the rain had reached Orkney, and was particularly heavy for a while in Cornwall and Devon. The rain was followed by blustery showers over Ireland in the SE airflow. Pressure fell to 969 mb by 2100 GMT, and gusts over 40kn were widespread in N Ireland and S Scotland; 58kn gusts were reported from Malin Head at 1200 GMT. (St Angelo (N Ireland) 14C, Altnaharra -3C, Dundrennan 40mm, Lerwick 11.8h.)\n\nThe rain and showers diminished over England and Wales overnight with rainfall being largely confined to Scotland by dawn on the 21st. An advancing low resulted in still-falling pressure during the morning and early afternoon over most of the British Isles, with 968 mb being reported at Shannon at 0300 GMT. Further bands of blustery rain and showers affected the British Isles during the day with gusts to 40 kn being widespread as the wind gradually veered to the SW. The evening footbal match at Swansea City was postponed due to a waterlogged pitch. (Gravesend 16C, Loch Glascarnoch 3C, Capel Curig 32mm, Margate 9.6h.)\n\nRain over Scotland continued to move N during the night, to be followed by showers over the British Isles on the 22nd. These showers were often heavy and blustery, with hail and thunder in places. Shortly before midnight, another area of rain began pushing into Cornwall from the S. According to a report in the Dublin Evening Herald, a tornado in Ballygawley (Co. Sligo) around 1410 GMT caused several thousands of pounds worth of damage with trees being uprooted and objects being carried for several hundred metres. (Great Malvern 16C, Spadeadam 6C, Shap Fell 24mm, Guernsey 10.8h.)\n\nA slow-moving area of heavy rain over SW England during the night moved into N England by the end of the 23rd, with falls being large in the SW. Wells reported 24.3mm of rainfall and there was local flooding of roads, eg. the A3102 in Wiltshire. There was a ground frost in some northern areas before dawn, but cloud and rain soon spread to W Scotland. It remained sunny, however, in between these two rain areas, with rain showers over Ireland. (Coltishall 16C, Aviemore 0C, Exmouth 27mm, Isle of Man 12.1h.)\n\nThe 24th was a cloudy day over much of Scotland, S and E England and the Midlands. Rain in W Scotland largely cleared by midday, and overnight rain in NE England gave way to showers there; there were further showers in E districts of England (some heavy and with thunder, e.g. at Chedburgh). W England, Wales and Ireland had sunny spells. (London 17C, Aboyne 0C, Chedburgh 33mm, Tenby 11.8h.)\n\nFrontal rain pushed into S Ireland, SW England and S Wales by dawn on the 25th. This slow-moving area of, at times heavy, rain continued to push NE during the day, extending to SE England, the Midlands and Wales by the evening. Parts of East Anglia had a sunny day until the frontal cloud arrived, while it remained rather cloudy in Scotland. Mist and fog formed over parts of NE England and SE Scotland by midnight. (Aspatria 18C, Shap Fell 2C, Cardinham 50mm, Clacton 11.1h.)\n\nWith an easterly wind off the North Sea, early morning fog on the 26th was dense in places in NE England and SE Scotland; although it cleared from most places, it did persist for most of the day in parts of NE England, resulting in some low maxima (e.g. 8C maximum at Loftus). Scotland and N Ireland has a mainly dry and sunny day, but rain over S Ireland, Wales, the Midlands and W England was slow to move, being heavy in places with thunderstorms reported. Later in the day rain and drizzle also fell in East Anglia. (Herstmonceux 19C, Loch Glascarnoch 2C, Barbourne 41mm, Stornoway 11.6h.)\n\nThe 27th was much drier than in previous days, due to an anticyclone centred just W of Scotland; pressure rose to 1035.3 mb at 2100 GMT at Malin Head. Mist and fog over NE England and E Scotland persisted in places until about midday; most other areas were clear overnight, although early cloud in S England, the Midlands and Wales gradually disappeared during the day. Once early fog and cloud had gone, it was mainly dry and sunny in most places, and quite warm in parts of NW England and W Scotland (21.8C at Kyle of Sutherland and 21.5C at Windermere) where the E wind was light. A notable exception was the Outer Hebrides, where fog lingered all day in places, while cloud remained all day in the Northern Isles. At Cirencester, a heavy thunderstorm from 1529 GMT to 1552 GMT resulted in 11.7mm of rain, with half the carriageway of the ring road under water on the W side of the town. (Dalmally 22C, Tulloch Bridge 1C, Cirencester 12mm, Tiree 13.9h.)\n\nMost of the British Isles has a warm and sunny day on the 28th. The exceptions to this were N and central Scotland where there was extensive low cloud with some light rain, and some coastal areas of E and NE England where early morning cloud did not clear in the E wind and temperatures remained low. Later in the evening this low cloud started to push W over East Anglia and SE England. 22.6C was reported from Windermere (unofficial site) and 21C from Llanbedr (official site), while in Ireland 19.8C was measured at Cork. (Tynemouth 8C max, Leeming 2C min, Wick 2mm, Manchester 14.2h.)\n\nIt was again largely warm and sunny over much S Ireland, Wales and the S half of England on the 29th once early morning low cloud and drizzle in E and Cent S England had dispersed, with 20.6C at Shannon. In N and W Scotland it was cloudy with some light rain, while N England, N Ireland and S Scotland had sunny spells with warm conditions in SE Scotland. (Charterhall (Borders) 22C, Eskdalemuir 3C, Kirkwall 4mm, Newquay 13.6h.)\n\nAfter a clear night with ground frost in places, Wales, S and central England had a warm and sunny day on the 30th away from the coasts where an E wind kept temperatures lower. There was some cloud over N areas and over much of Ireland; where this persisted all day, as well as along the E coast, temperatures remained low. The unofficial station at Bristol Totterdown reported a maximum of 23.1C. (Northolt 22C, Benson -0C, South Uist 2mm, Bognor Regis 13.9h.)\n\nBritish Isles weather, May 1999\n\nThe 1st was another warm and sunny day over central and S parts of England away from the E coast. N parts of East Anglia and NE England were cloudy and this cloud spread to parts of SE England during the afternoon. There was overnight fog in SW and Cent s England which ws slow to clear in places, while mist and light drizzle persisted for much of the day in S Ireland. Elsewhere, it was mainly dry with sunny spells, although some rain fell in parts of W Scotland. (London 22C, Redesdale 0C, Baltasound 9mm, Tiree 14.3h.)\n\nEarly cloud over E and S England was slow to clear in the E/NE wind on the 2nd and persisted all day in parts of NE England. Fog in SW and Cent S England soon cleared and it was eventually warm and sunny over most of Wales and the S half of England. There were sunny intervals in Ireland after early fog cleared, while Scotland remained mainly cloudy with light rain in the NW and Northern Isles. (Bristol 22C, Redesdale -0C, South Uist 3mm, Jersey 13.2h.)\n\nThe 3rd began with cloud over much of Scotland and fog in parts of NE and Cent S England. This all soon cleared except in NW Scotland where there was some light rain during the day; Ireland had a day of sunny intervals and some cloud, while much of England and Wales was warm and sunny. As far N as Windermere 23.7C was recorded. However, cloud developed over S England and Channel Islands during the afternoon. (Saunton Sands 25C, Redesdale 2C, Stornoway 1mm, Anglesey 13.9h.)\n\nThe 4th was another mainly dry day, except in parts of N Ireland and W Scotland where some rain fell. S England, and parts of the Midlands and Wales were generally cloudy, with mainly medium-to high-level cloud, and some cloud persisted along the E coast of England. Scotland saw quite a range of temperatures during the day between the W and the Northern Isles. (Lusa (Skye) 23C, Fair Isle 8C max, Altnaharra 1C min, Ballykelly 4mm, Isle of Man 13.3h.)\n\nCloud developed overnight and into the morning of the 5th over most areas of the British Isles. Light rain began falling in parts of S England around midday, and pushed slowly N to affect most of England (except the extreme N), Wales and S Ireland by midnight. Scotland remained generally dry, with sunny intervals. (Prestatyn 20C, Aviemore 2C, Benson 3mm, Aberdeen 9.0h.)\n\nCloud and rain over England, Wales and S Ireland continued to push N and by dawn on the 6th had reached S Scotland and Northern Ireland. There were reports of sand falling in the rain from Wigan, Rutland, the Midlands, while visibility fell below 1000m for a while in places due to the rain and low cloud. The rain reached N Scotland by nightfall, although the Northern Isles remained mainly dry, and the associated began clearing from S England, Wales, the Midlands and S Ireland during mid-afternoon to give a fine end to the day here. However, another area of rain reached Cornwall shortly before midnight. (Prestatyn 20C, Loch Glascarnoch 7C, Newcastle 12mm, Lerwick 13.9h.)\n\nRain spread to much of S Ireland, SW England and S Wales by dawn on the 7th, and by late morning there was heavy rain in parts of NW England and the N Midlands. Overnight cloud brought light rain and drizzle to parts of Scotland, and there was some fog along the E coast here. The N-moving rain over England reached S Scotland by late evening, and it turned drier with scattered showers (some thundery) in S Ireland, S Wales and SW England by this time. There were also evening reports of thunder in SE England associated with a large thundery outbreak moving N over W France and Benelux. At Pitsford Hall (Northamptonshire) 15.5mm of rain fell during the 24 hours beginning 0900 GMT, with a peak intensity of 22.4mm per hour shortly after 1400 GMT. (Hunstanton 21C, Redhill 3C, Manchester 18mm, Lerwick 13.9h.)\n\nThe rain area over the Midlands and N England continued to move slowly N during the night; later during the morning of the 8th more rain began to affect S Ireland and SW England, with some gusts to 30-40 kn in exposed areas of the SW. (Hemsby 18C, Aonach Mor 3C.)\n\nThe 9th was a cloudy day over much of the British Isles, with slow-moving fronts and troughs giving further spells of rain. Gusts in W districts reached 50 kn at times as S winds blew around a low centred to the W of S Ireland. (Gravesend 22C, Aviemore 4C, Capel Curig 18mm, Herne Bay 11.0h.)\n\nS winds continued to affect the British Isles on the 10th, with bands of rain moving generally to the E. Some of the rain was heavy, with thunder reported from places in N and E England, Northern Ireland and parts of Scotland (where temporary power cuts were reported in Sutherland). In Wigan a thunderstorm around 1200 GMT gave hail up to 25mm causing small dents in cars in the S of the town. (Lowestoft 20C, Lerwick 6C, St Athan 19mm, Eastbourne 11.5h.)\n\nFurther bands of rain and showers affected the British Isles on the 11th, with some of the heavier rain falling in N England and S Scotland. S winds persisted, as the low remained anchored to the W of S Ireland. Thundery activity occurred over parts of E and N Ireland and E England during the afternoon and evening. (Gravesend 19C, Loch Glascarnoch 3C, Eskdalemuir 27mm, Southend 13.3h.)\n\nThe rain over S Scotland and N England diminished during the morning of the 12th, although scattered showery outbreaks (with some heavy rain) continued in many other parts of the British Isles, with more persistent rain in the extreme N of Scotland. Thundery activity during the late afternoon and early evening affected E Ireland, parts of Ireland and central Scotland. (Herne Bay 18C, Lerwick 6C, Eskdalemuir 27mm, Hayling Island 11.5h.)\n\nMany areas of the British Isles were affected by spells of rain or showers during the 13th, with the winds turning to the N during the afternoon over Ireland as a low centre crossed the country. Some of the showers were heavy and thundery over parts of Ireland and N England. At Drumburgh (Cumbria) hail 1cm in diameter fell during a heavy thunderstorm in mid-afternoon (the observer there reports \"our cottage was actually struck by one isolated stroke, no damage but we were shaken\"), and there were reports of a funnel cloud near Banbridge (Co. Down) in the evening. (Heathrow 19C, Baltasound 5C, Drumburgh 36mm, Isle of Wight 11.3h.)\n\nA slow-moving area of low pressure centred over England and Wales on the 14th brought spells of rain to these countries; the rain was in places heavy and thundery, and accompanied by hail. Scotland remainded mainly dry, while there were a few showers in the N airflow over Ireland. A small funnel cloud was observed over NE Hertfordshire (near Barkway) at 1443-1448 GMT. The funnel cloud was estimated to be no more that 600 feet high, with a maximum diameter of 100 feet. There were other reports of funnel clouds being widely seen, including at Corby (Northamptonshire) - see NEWSPAPER ARTICLE WITH PHOTO. Lightning knocked out a signal box on the railway between Reading and Basingstoke. The Met Office surface analyses for 0000 GMT on the 14th and 15th show a slack area of low pressure over the British Isles. (London Weather Centre 19C, Dunkeswell 30mm, Guernsey 12.9h.)\n\nAs the depression declined and moved over the North Sea, winds became generally lighter and from the N on the 15th. Much of S and SE England remained rather cloudy (and there was some rain in the extreme SE), as was N Scotland where a cold front brought some light rain. In between these two cloudy areas is was mainly sunny, although it soon turned cloudy over much of Ireland. (Saunton Sands 19C, Loch Glascarnoch 2C, Kenley 6mm, Valley 14.6h.)\n\nThe S-moving cold front meant that the 16th was generally cloudy with rain in places. Any rain was, however, genrally light as pressure was high over the entire British Isles (Valentia reported 1026.3 mb at 0900 GMT). Some coastal areas remained almost cloudfree and had the best of the sunshine. (Plymouth 17C, Lerwick 3C, Wittering and Hemsby 1.3mm, Ronaldsway 14.5h.)\n\nThe main feature of the weather in the S half of England on the 17th was the increasing windspeed (with gusts to 30 kn) of the E flow during the afternoon. This, and increasing cloud cover, heralded the N movement of a low system over France. Clear skies over parts of Scotland led to an ground frost in places at first, followed by a sunny day. N England and Northern Ireland began cloudy with isolated light rain which largely faded out. On Fair Isle the maximum temperature was just 9.4C, despite 15.7h of sunshine which made it (provisionally) the sunniest place in Britain. (Lee-on-Solent 17C, Wick 0C, Shoeburyness 0.8mm.)\n\nClear skies over N Scotland resulted in some air frost reports by dawn on the 18th. Thereafter, most of Scotland, Northern Ireland and N England had a sunny day. Low humidity readings in parts of Cent Scotland during the afternoon included reports below 30 per cent (possibly orographically-related in the SE flow), while 32 per cent was reported from Leeming at 1500 GMT (temperature 16.6C, dewpoint -0.2C). It warm afternoon in parts of W Scotland, with 22.7C at the unofficial site at Kyle of Sutherland. Over S England and Wales a slow-moving band of cloud associated with the low over France brought a cloudy day with light precipitation; in coastal counties of S England falls were occasionally heavy in nature. S Ireland turned cloudy but remained mainly dry. (Jersey 20C, Aboyne -2C, Isle of Wight 13mm, Kinloss 15.6h.)\n\nMost parts of S Ireland, Wales, and England S of the Pennines, had a cloudy night with fog forming by dawn on the 19th in parts of the Thames Valley. Other areas had a clear night with a ground frost in parts of Scotland. Scotland then had a sunny day while further s cloud moved N over much of England, Wales and Ireland. After a wam and quite humid day, thunderstorms occurred over SE, Cent S England during the early evening, moving to the S Midlands later in the evening. Some thunderstorms were heavy in the SE with hail in places (1cm in diameter at Maidenhead where 20mm fell in 20 minutes, the temperature fell 7C during the early evening storm, pressure rose 2mbar and roads were temporarily flooded). The NOAA12 channel 4 thermal image at 1637 GMT (courtesy of Bernard Burton) shows what appears to be a mesoscale convective system of storms during this event. At Crowthorne 26.3mm fell between 1630 GMT and 1745 GMT. In Hampshire, golfball-size hail fell at Easton and Itchen Stoke, and the hail was still lying 15 hours after the storm. Conservatory roofs, glasshouses and guttering were damaged by the storm and gardens and crops were devastated there, and several minor roads were flooded. There were also reports of large hail on the Isle of Wight. (London Weather Centre 24C max, Redhill 22mm, Lerwick 16.0h.)\n\nThe thunderstorms had almost died out by 0000 GMT on the 20th over the Midlands, leaving patchy cloud and fog patches in SW and Cent S England and along the NE coast of England by dawn. Skies were clear over many parts of Scotland by leading to some ground frost by dawn; during the day advancing cloud from the W there and over parts of Ireland was followed by light frontal rain later in the day. S Scotland, England, Wales and S Ireland had a warm day (except for a few coastal locations in NE England where fog lingered), although developing cumulonimbus clouds produced a few rain showers in S England during late afternoon. 23C was reported at Leeds Weather Centre, with 23.8 at the C.O.L. station at Langtoft. (Aboyne 0C min, Birmingham 15mm, Lerwick 15.2h.)\n\nOvernight frontal rain over Ireland during the night had reached most of Scotland and W Wales by dawn on the 21st, then continued moving E to clear the British Isles by late evening. Ahead of the rain (which was heavy in parts of Scotland) it was sunny in East Anglia and the extreme SE England; the rain was followed by showers (hail was reported at Stornoway) and sunny spells in the W. (Margate 22C, Aultbea 4C, Lusa (Skye) 28mm, Herne Bay 11.7h.)\n\nA westerly airstream brought showers to Scotland, Ireland and W districts of England on the 22nd. Some of these showers were heavy with hail in Scotland and gusts to 40kn occurred widely in the N and W. Malin Head reported a gust to 51kn at 0600 GMT. During the evening an area of rain and drizzle began to affect W and S areas of Scotland. (Poole 20C, Aviemore 1C, Loch Glascarnoch 22mm, Aberdeen 14.0h.)\n\nCloud formed extensively over the British Isles overnight as the area of precipitation over Scotland moved slowly S to affect most of Ireland by dawn on the 23rd, and N England later in the day. Most of England and Wales remained dry but cloudy with gusts to 40 kn being widespread over Scotland and N England. Behind the rain area, which persisted over S Scotland and Ireland, N Scotland had a day of sunshine and showers. (Gravesend 20C, Lybster 5C, Sella Ness 7mm, Stornoway 11.0h.)\n\nThe rain area over S Scotland, N England and Northern Ireland moved slowly S during the 24th, weakening steadily and clearing SE England by late evening. In its wake skies cleared and there was sunshine and showers, some thundery in N England. Gusts to 30kn were again quite widespread in parts of N England and S Scotland. What was described, on local TV and press, as a mini tornado occured at North Ferriby (near the Humber Bridge) in the evening. Although damage did occur, i.e. branches broken off trees, house windows and car windows smashed by falling trees and branches, it was very localised. (Coltishall 19C, Loch Glascarnoch 4C, Keswick 15mm, Edinburgh 12.9h.)\n\nIt was showery overnight (with some hail reported) in Norther Ireland and N and W Scotland; elsewhere the 25th dawned dry with nearly clear skies leading to a ground frost in places in S England. It remained mainly dry in most places, except for occasional showers in parts of N Scotland, until an area of rain began moving E across Ireland around midday, reaching W Scotland and NW Wales by late evening. (Gravesend 19C, Benson 3C, Buxton 8mm, Folkestone 13.3h.)\n\nAreas of frontal rain crossed the British Isles on the 26th although amounts in S England were, at most, light. Clear skies ahead of the rain brought a few low minima in the S, and a mainly sunny day along SE coastal areas. (Gravesend 23C, Bournemouth 3C, Isle of Skye 16.2mm, Clacton 14.6h.)\n\nCloud and rain persisted over much of scotland and Northern Ireland during the 27th. Further S, a ridge brought warm and sunny conditions, until thunderstorms began moving NE across SW England, reaching Lincolnshire and Norfolk by midnight. In Bradninch (Devon) a thunderstorm began at 1800 GMT; the observer noted at least 40 cloud-to-ground strikes with a roof and tree struck; 18.8mm fell from 1800 to 2115 GMT. A thunderstorm at Keyworth (Notts.) from 2245 GMT to 0015 GMT on the 28th resulted from a line of spectacular storm cells slowly moving N across South Nottinghamshire with frequent long lasting cloud to cloud and cloud to ground strikes; a brief period of intense rain followed as the storm gradually flickered away to the north leaving a chorus of car and house alarms. Many observers commented upon the intensity of the lightning displays, while at Chalfont St. Giles a dust deposit was left by the rain. In the Solihull area damage reports included: 30000 households without power, lightning set fire to vent pipes connected to fuel tanks at a petrol station at Cradley Heath, and lightning blew a hole in the roof of a new Midland Metro tram and set it alight. (Heathrow 26C, Baltasund 5C, Falmouth 11.2mm, Hastings 15.1h.)\n\nThe thundery area moved into NW and NE England in the early hours of the 28th, which began with heavy rain in N Scotland and in Northern Ireland. Rain over Ireland and Scotland persisted for much of the day, while England and Wales were mainly dry except for lingering rain in some N areas of England. (Jersey 23C, Lerwick 6C, Kirkwall 38mm, Cromer 12.8h.)\n\nRain continued to fall over many parts of Scotland until early afternoon on the 29th, while Ireland has a mainly cloudy day. England and Wales began dry and sunny and became quite warm in places. An area of thundery activity (accompanied by hail in places) moved into SW England by 0600 GMT, moving NE and spreading to the E Midlands and East Anglia by late evening. A thunderstorm at Bristol (Totterdown) from 1215 GMT until 1515 GMT resulted in 18mm of precipitation, including 10mm from 1325 GMT to 1338 GMT when a 26 kn gust occurred. During the passage of a thunderstorm at Wokingham from 1551 GMT to 1608 GMT 15.7mm of rain fell, with a peak rainfall rate of 199 mm/hr around 1554 GMT over a two and half minute period. Thunderstorms resulted in local flooding in many areas (eg. in parts of SW and Cent S England) and there were reports of small tornadoes in the SW. Rainfall under the core of the storms was heavy, eg. 25.4mm at Cirencester (of which 15mm fell in 15 mins with winds of force 5 to 7). Several places from Birmingham to Wokingham reported rapid pressure fluctuations during these storms (associated with temperature falls as large as 5degC). Hail in a storm at Dartford was 1cm in diameter, while in Danbury (Essex) 17mm fell in 5 minutes. (Southampton 27C, Lerwick 6C, Chipping Norton 34mm, Folkestone 14.0h.)\n\nThe thundery activity died down by dawn on the 30th, leaving an area of rain over N and Cent. parts of England by dawn, along with an easterly airflow here. The day was a notably cool one over much of England and Wales with the temperature falling during the day in many places, and maxima of 15C or less in many places during 0900 to 2100 GMT. At Cirencester the maximum was 11.3C, the temperature falling to 9.8C during late morning. The area of rain brought large totals to some parts of S England and mist and fog to the Channel Islands; Scotland and Ireland were mainly dry with sunny spells following the clearance of early cloud. (Jersey 18C, Buxton (Derbyshire) 10C min, Loch Glascarnoch -0C, Margate 28mm, Tiree 14.7h.)\n\nMuch of England and Wales remained cloudy throughout the 31st, with daytime temperatures again rather low as a result, and overnight rain in the extreme S clearing by lunchtime. A high pressure centre moved S over Scotland during the day, and here and in Ireland it remained mainly dry and sunny; 1025 mbar was reported in E England around 0900 GMT. (Saunton Sands 20Cm Biggar -1C, Clacton 9mm, Aviemore 13.3h.)\n\nBritish Isles weather, June 1999\n\nClear skies early on the 1st over parts of Scotland N England and resulted in low temperatures around dawn in places, although much of England (except the extreme S), Wales and Ireland began the month with cloudy conditions. By mid-afternoon the cloud had largely lifted over England and Wales, although Scotland had largely clouded over. A new area of cloud in SW England by mid-afternoon heralded the arrival of a thundery low (see surface chart for 0000 GMT on the 2nd); thunderstorms were reported from Devon around 1600 GMT and the Channel islands around 1900 GMT. These moved NE during the evening to affect much of Cent S England by midnight; 17mm of precipitation fell at Hurn (Bournemouth) in the 6 hours starting 1800 GMT. (Northolt 23C, Keswick and Shap Fell 3C, South Uist Range 6mm, Folkestone 14.9h.)\n\nThe thundery activity spread to Norfolk and E Kent by dawn on the 2nd with 12-hour rainfall totals ending 0600 GMT including 26mm at Heathrow, 22mm at Hurn and 21mm at Boscombe Down. 28mm fell at Reigate during the overnight storms, while the daily rainfall total at West Totton (Hampshire) amounted to 35mm. At Lewes (East Sussex) hail 1 inch in diameter fell around 0230 GMT. The storms brought lightning, which struck a signalling cabin before dawn at Shenfield, Essex, causing rail delays to London. On the Surrey stretch of the M25 part of an embankment subsided. Flooding closed several London Underground stations. Most of Scotland and N parts of Ireland had a dry night, but by midday the rain area covered most of Ireland and was beginning to affect S Scotland. By midnight rain was falling over much of Scotland, although much of S Ireland and the SW quarter of England was then dry. Rainfall totals include 28mm at Hemsby (0600-1200 GMT); 14mm fell at Wittering in the same period with 18mm in the 6 hours to 1800 GMT. In Rayleigh (Essex) lightning struck a house and set fire to the loft. During a catamaran race in Weymouth Bay a sudden squall with a SE force 6 wind capsized 77 boats and led to the rescue of 154 competitors. Roads were flooded in many areas, and lightning disabled the emergency phones on the M1 and M45. There are unconfirmed reports of a tornado being sighted near Hockley Heath (near Birmingham), accompanying a thunderstorm with hail, during late afternoon, and also one over the Bristol Channel near Newport during late morning. In Warwick, 3 people were hit by lightning, and 5 people in York were similarly affected. During the afternoon there was an increase in wind and gustiness in S England; a gust to 49kn occurred at Worthing. In Northamptonshire the leisure centre in Rushden was closed due to flooding; 170 storm-related calls made to the Fire Brigade and 180 businesses throughout Northants were without power during the day. (Herne Bay 23C, Biggar 3C, Heathrow 48mm, Clacton 9.2h.)\n\nA copy of the Met Office radar display for 1200 GMT on the 2nd can be found here.\n\nThere was some thunder in the early hours of the 3rd in the Lincolnshire area; elsewhere it was cloudy with rain in places, heavy in parts of Scotland. By day it was mainly cloudy everywhere with rain in Scotland gradually becoming lighter, and with showers over England and Wales. These showers were thundery in parts of the Midlands and S Wales during the afternoon. (Hunstanton 20C, Baltasound 8C, Birmingham 29mm, Guernsey 9.0h.)\n\nCloudy conditions overnight over most of the British Isles kept temperatures well above freezing by dawn on the 4th; rain over N Scotland continued on and off for most of the day. Showers were widespread over England, Wales and Ireland - these were heavy and blustery at times with widespread reports of gusts to 35kn. (Herne Bay 19C, Wick 6C, Tain Range 14mm, Anglesey 8.6h.)\n\nAreas of rain continued overnight in N Scotland, and throughout much of the 5th. Over England, Wales and Ireland clearing skies led to temperatures down to 4C in many locations, with a warm afternoon in parts of N England, the N Midlands and East Anglia. An unofficial station at Beverley reported 18.1C, and there was some ground frost in places. Cloud increased in S Ireland, S England and Wales as an active depression moved E through SW England to Hampshire by midnight, bringing some further heavy rain (and occasional thunder) to the Midlands and S districts. Thunderstorms were also reported from NE England and SE Scotland. (Leeds 18C, Castlederg 1C, Aspatria 26mm, Prestatyn 15.1h.)\n\nRain and showers continued to fall over many parts of scotland throughout the 6th; clearing skies over Wales led to a ground frost in sheltered places in the N. Elsewhere it remained generally cloudy overnight with rain in some S and E districts of England. During late morning and afternoon increasing cloud brought more heavy and, in places, thundery showers to England and Wales. (Northolt 20C, Llanbedr 1C, Falmouth 27mm, Guernsey 12.7h.)\n\nRain and showers were largely confined to E England and E Scotland by dawn on the 7th, although by midday precipitation had fallen in many areas of S, E England, the Midlands and S Wales. These bands of rain continued into the evening, being slow-moving with hail, heavy rain and thunder observed in places. At Danbury (Essex) 17mm fell in 10mins during a thunderstorm around 1230 GMT. At Colchester, some rotation was seen in the cloudbase during a thunderstorm (in the form of `8 fat v-shaped incipient funnel clouds'), although the vertical development did not extend down to the ground and soon settled back into mammatus form. Much of Ireland, N Wales and W Scotland, however, remained dry during the day. According to televsion, about 18cm of snow fell on Cairngorm in a northerly airflow. (Gravesend 19C, Saughall -1C, Topcliffe 25mm, Tiree 14.1h.)\n\nHeavy overnight rain and thunderstorms led to some local flooding of roads in Cleveland by dawn on the 8th; rain continued to fall over areas of NW, NE and E England and N parts of East Anglia until mid-afternoon, while E Scotland was cloudy with a few rain showers throughout the day. Elsewhere, skies largely cleared by dawn, giving a ground frost in sheltered places. Increasing cloud cover brought light rain to S Ireland and SW England during the morning, while it turned cloudy in much of S England and Scotland during the day despite pressure rising to 1026mb over the Channel Islands by 2100 GMT. (Barbourne 19C, Castlederg 1C, Leeming 33mm, Ronaldsway 14.3h.)\n\nA persistent area of low pressure continued to bring some rain to NE England overnnight, but this rain had almost ended by dawn on the 9th. Elsewhere the night was dry except in the Northern Isles, extreme NE Ireland, SW England and the Channel Islands; clear skies and a N airflow led to a touch of ground frost in some sheltered parts of Scotland, the Midlands and Wales and these same clear skies then led to a sunny day in many places. Light rain, however, affected parts of W Scotland and NW Ireland, the Channel Islands and, later, North Sea coasts of SE Scotland and NE England. (Bristol and Herne Bay 20C, Loch Glascarnoch 0C, Topcliffe 7mm, Morecambe 15.5h.)\n\nSurface charts from the Met Office showing the development of the North Sea low pressure area that gave the rain in NE and E England over the last few days can be found here.\n\nClearing skies overnight over the S half of England and E Wales led to a ground frost in some sheltered inland districts before dawn on the 10th, while the rest of the British Isles had a mainly cloudy start to the day. Cloud soon developed over S England and England, Wales and Ireland then had a mainly cloudy day with light rain and drizzle over Ireland during early morning. Parts of E Scotland saw some sunny spells, and it was generally sunny over the Channel Islands. (Edinburgh 20C, Benson 3C, Jersey 5mm, Guernsey 11.9h.)\n\nFrontal cloud was quite persistent in E Scotland and E england during the 11th, and although rainfall amounts were small so were daytime temperatures in a N airflow. Clear skies in C Scotland overnight led to some ground frost there before dawn. Most of the British Isles had sunny intervals during the day, although more prolonged sunshine occurred in SW districts of Scotland and Wales. (Southampton 19C max, Loftus 9C max, Strathallan 3C min, Coltishall 2mm, Tiree 13.0h.)\n\nThere was further cloud and rain in the E half of Scotland England on the 12th; during the afternoon there were thunderstorms in parts of the E Midlands and East Anglia, with 47mm falling in 6 hours at Danbury (Essex). The best of the sunshine was again in W Scotland, and later in parts of W Wales, while much of the remainder of the British Isles had a mainly cloudy day. (Herne Bay 19C, Tulloch Bridge 5C, Honington 19mm, Tiree 14.0h.)\n\nAfter cloudy night with rain or drizzle over N Ireland, Scotland the the extreme E of England, fog patched formed around dawn on the 13th under clearing skies from Hampshire to the Pennines with the visiblity falling to 100m in places. These soon cleared and much of Cent and S England had a mild day with sunny spells. Rain fell over Scotland and much of Ireland for most of the day, pushing into Wales and N England early in the afternoon; associated cloud spread to much of S England later in the afternnon and evening. (Bournemouth 22C, Pembrey Sands 5C, Clacton 28mm, Penzance 14.0h.)\n\nRain bands associated with a cold front brought bands of (mainly light) rain to many parts of the British Isles during the 14th, although some heavy rain fell in W Scotland overnight. A cloudy night in most districts kept minimum temperatures up, although in extreme SE England and coastal East Anglis clear skies before dawn led to some local fog formation. Fog also occurred in parts of the Northern Isles. Ahead of the S-moving rainbands, much of S and Cent. England has some warm, sunny spells, while Ireland turned brighter during the afternoon; other places were rather cloudy. (Gravesend 24C, Redhill 4C, Lusa (Skye) 18mm, Clacton 15.0h.)\n\nWhile Scotland was mainly cloudy overnight, clearing skies in other areas led to some fog patches by dawn on the 15th, especially on some Irish Sea coasts and in SW and Cent. S England. Cloud soon developed over England and Wales during the day, although away from the coasts it was quite warm here with some coastal fog in the parts of Cornwall and W Wales; 24C recorded at Wigan and 25c at Leeds. Light rain spread into Ireland and then W Scotland during the day, extending to E Scotland by nightfall. (London 26C, Aboyne 5C, Lough Fea 1mm, Jersey 14.1h.)\n\nThe overnight rain was heavy in places in Scotland, and during daytime on the 16th continued to fall there and in N parts of Ireland; by the evening, a clearance was evident in the extreme N of Scotland, however. After some overnight fog in parts of SW Wales, SW and Cent S England, England and Wales had a mainly sunny day, while it was generally cloudy in Ireland. Parts of SE, Cent S England, East Anglia and the Midlands were quite warm, although it was cooler on the coasts. (London 27C, Culdrose 8C, Lusa 25mm, Southend 16.0h.)\n\nThe night was warm in places in S England, with 1800 - 0600 GMT minima on the 17th including 13.0C at St Mary's, Scilly. It was cloudy overnight in Scotland at first, with rain in the S; as the rain moved S skies cleared in N districts while England and Wales clouded over after a clear start. The rainmoved S to N England by mid-morning, and then largely faded out, although some did fall in Cornwall for a while. During the afternoon Scotland clouded over while sunny periods occurred over England, Ireland and Wales. (Hastings 23C, Loch Glascarnoch 4C, Port Ellen 5mm, Penzance 14.0h.)\n\nLight rain and drizzle spread slowly E over Ireland and Scotland overnight although there was little cloud over England and Wales by dawn on the 18th. Precipitation continued to fall over Scotland by day, while becoming generally lighter over Ireland; cloud spread to parts of N England and N Wales during the afternoon, while the remainder of the British Isles had a mainly sunny day. (London Weather Centre 25C, Lerwick 11C max, Lerwick 5mm, Prestatyn 16.1h.)\n\nIt remained cloudy overnight over Ireland and Scotland, with light rain or dirzzle in places; after a clear start, cloud spread SE to cover most of Wales, N and W england by dawn on the 19th, with light rain pushing into N England by this time. This area of cloud extended to cover most of the British Isles by early afternoon, with some light rain falling in parts of S England but with more extensive and heavier rain over Ireland and Cent. Scotland by that time. This heavier rain, associated with a cold front, continued to push SE to reach the Midlands and SW England by midnight. (Herne Bay 25C, Tulloch Bridge 7C, Dundrennan 21mm, Eastbourne 15.5h.)\n\nRain over Scotland diedaway to the E overnight, while the cold frontal rain over England cleared the extreme SE by midday on the 20th, with a few rain showers falling behind the front in places. Following a warm night in few places in the S (e.g. 14.1C at Hemsby, 14.5C at Heathrow and 14.6C at Manston), the NW breeze made it feel much cooler by day than of late over the whole British Isles. During the afternoon there were showers of hail and thunder in NE England (also Aberdeen reported a thunderstorm shortly before 1200 GMT) with reports of several tornadoes in the Newcastle area, including one around 1415 GMT near the Silverlink, E of the city. Showers of rain were quite widespread over Ireland and Scotland generally. (Shoreham 21C, Loch Glascarnoch 5C, Capel Curig 25mm, Fishguard 10.3h.)\n\nShowers died down overnight in most places and a patchy cloud cover resulted over the British Isles by dawn on the 21st. During the day it was mainly dry, but with rain showers in Scotland and in W areas of England and Wales. (Bournemouth 19C, Spadeadam 4C, Loch Glascarnoch 10mm, Saunton Sands 15.0h.)\n\nThere were clear skies over most of the British Isles by dawn on the 22nd, with an air frost reported in sheltered area of Scotland. Ground frost was fairly widespread at inland Scottish sites N of the Forth-Clyde valley, and over parts of NW England, NE Wales, Cent S England, Kent and a few other isolated areas. An exception to this were S Scotland, NE England and later Ireland, where there was overnight cloud and rain. This cloud soon spread to most parts of Britain, except NW Scotland, and frontal rain fell over much of Ireland by mid-afternoon, and later over S Scotland, parts of N England and W Wales. (Cardiff 19C, Loch Glascarnoch -1C, Lough Fea 7mm, Stornoway 17.2h.)\n\nA cloudy night meant that minimum temperatures on the 23rd remained fairly high over much of the British Isles, the exception to this being over N parts of Scotland where clear skies led to loc"
