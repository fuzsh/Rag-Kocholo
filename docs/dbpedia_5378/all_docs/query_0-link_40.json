A long fetch North Westerly air stream will be pumping a very warm and dry air mass from the interior of the continent over the State. The Westerly is not that strong, so sea breezes will moderate conditions on the coastal fringe. Away from the coast, September heat records might be at risk. Over Sydney, 850 temps are predicted to be as high as 18-19° on the 19th, consistent with mid 30s maxima in fine conditions.\n\nA remarkable aspect of this event is its duration. Five days seems to be locked in, but it may be longer.\n\nUnlike most of the last couple of years, NW’ers are no longer delivering cloud bands. Skies are expected to be fairly clear, long-range forecasts show little or no rain for the next couple of weeks. Fire danger will likely be high or very high over wide areas of the State.\n\nHere are the current BOM forecasts, September 15-19:\n\nNewcastle: 27, 31, 29, 29, 31\n\nMaitland: 29, 32, 32, 31, 33\n\nSydney: 25, 30, 28, 27, 30\n\nPenrith: 31, 34, 33, 33, 34\n\nAlbion Park: 28, 31, 29 28, 31\n\nMcbobbings\n\nOne of Us\n\nJul 10, 2019\n\n363\n\n1,032\n\n263\n\nMacquarie Park NSW\n\nSep 13, 2023\n\n#2\n\nGFS - MOS still going for near 40 on Monday the 18th of September - appears to be at the airport site.\n\nAs I've said previously, I don't actually mind a bit of heat. We have had a few quite summers so we are somewhat due for hot conditions. Where I have some concerns is the early nature of the heat, its duration, and the fact that we have no significant rain on the horizon.\n\nIf this was November/December and we had 4-5 days of 30-35+ followed by a strong southerly with rain for a few days / and or some thunderstorms, I would love it. Instead it's September, and there's no rain. 10 day multi model forecast shows 4 fifths of bugger all rain\n\nWhy can't we just have some normal weather please? If it's not record rain, it's record heat and dry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSteve777\n\nOne of Us\n\nJul 4, 2019\n\n3,413\n\n11,365\n\n363\n\nArtarmon, Sydney North Shore\n\nSep 13, 2023\n\n#3\n\nSydney Airport’s September record high is 35.6°, attained 29/9/2000. This was during the Sydney Olympics in another warm September. The Airport’s October record is 39.1° (13/10/2004).\n\nSo 39° at the Airport before the Equinox (4:50 pm 23 September) would be quite remarkable.\n\nP.S. GFS shows 850 temps over Sydney in the afternoon of next Tuesday 19th at about 19°, consistent with a max of maybe 35-37° under clear skies in the absence of a sea breeze. BOM forecasts for Tuesday for the Sydney area are ~ 29-34°.\n\nWe’ll see how it goes.\n\nJimi\n\nOne of Us\n\nSep 10, 2021\n\n889\n\n2,237\n\n263\n\nRoseville\n\nSep 13, 2023\n\n#4\n\nI was watching the mountain biking at Homebush that day as a 15 year old.

In the Sydney Basin, it reached 30° West from about Bankstown and Parramatta.\n\nIt looks like a five day heat event, Saturday to Wednesday, followed by a return to seasonal temperatures, with showers likely over the weekend after this one.\n\nHere are the current Sydney forecast maxima, 16th -20th:\n\nSydney OH: 32, 30, 30, 32, 32\n\nParramatta: 33, 31, 33, 34, 34\n\nPenrith: 34, 33, 36, 35, 35.\n\nThat is an extraordinary burst of heat for this time of year.\n\nOH might be overcooked, I think the sea-breeze will start early on some days against a weak Westerly stream. However, not the two inland sites. September records may be at risk.\n\nThe forecasts for Newcastle and the Central Coast are about the same, Wollongong a bit cooler.\n\nWavey\n\nOne of Us\n\nJul 3, 2019\n\n2,640\n\n6,462\n\n363\n\nPort Kembla, NSW\n\nSep 15, 2023\n\n#10\n\nLooks like it will get to about 32°C in Wollongong tomorrow.

Will probably turn westerly on the coast soon enough.\n\n25°C at Marrangaroo is pretty nuts too. It's 955m ASL there.

Most other Sydney sites are over 30° or soon will be. OH may or may not get there. A sea breeze looks to be established there.\n\nEDIT: there have been some 20+ diurnal ranges around Sydney today.

Of course, the Bureau were right and this heat might actually end up worse than forecast because, you know, it's 2023 doing 2023 things.

These temperatures are around ten to fifteen degrees above average and persist for an unusually prolonged period for this time of year. Severe heatwave conditions will ease in the wake of a cold front from late Wednesday.\n\nLocations likely to be impacted include Batemans Bay and Wollongong.\n\nThe next heatwave warning will be issued by 3:00pm EST on Tuesday 19 September 2023"
