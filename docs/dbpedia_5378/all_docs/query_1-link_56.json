        "text": "Weather records from Maryland Station on the New South Wales – Queensland border (near “The Summit”) were located by William Oates, Archivist at the University of New England in 2016. This was the second major historic climate data set uncovered following the discovery of the extensive climate records of Algernon Henry Belfield from the Eversleigh Station in the New England District of Armidale, NSW.\n\nThe records were uncovered on a trip taken to Maryland Station following up on the Marsh family archives. The Maryland Station was the third of the major runs acquired by Matthew Henry Marsh in the 1840’s. This run later became part of the New South Wales – Queensland border near Stanthorpe. These runs also included Salisbury Court and Booralong and ran to about 250,000 acres.\n\nThe weather records are contained in one volume, covering the years from 1868 – 1897, and providing the Eversleigh Research Team with further historic data to work on.
