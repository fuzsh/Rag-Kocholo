        "text": "On this Page 1\n\nBiting, Snow-Chilled Wind Made Newcastle Shiver\n\nA biting wind blowing off snow at Barrington Tops and other ranges to\n\nthe north-west of Newcastle today caused temperatures to drop to the lowest\n\nlevels this winter.\n\nAt Merewether early this\n\nmorning tne temperature drop-\n\nped to 41 degrees, and at 9 a.m.\n\nwas only 44.5 degrees at Mere-\n\nwether and 44 degrees in the\n\ncity.\n\nAlthough temperatures rose\n\nslightly to 51.5 degrees in the\n\ncity and 46 degrees at Nobbys\n\nat 1p.m., light sleety rain con-\n\ntinued to make conditions as\n\nunpleasant as for many years.\n\nThe co-proprietor of Barring-\n\nton Guest House (Mrs. I.\n\nRoach) reported that snow was\n\nstill falling around the Tops\n\nat 9 a.m.\n\nOnly 28 Degrees\n\nAt the guest house the tem-\n\nperature at 8.30 a.m. was only\n\n28 degrees.\n\nFreezing conditions generally\n\nwere reported from the Hunter\n\nValley, where snow, sleet and\n\nlight rain have fallen.\n\nAt Wingen, more than a foot\n\nof snow fell early this morning.\n\nOne local inhabitant who had\n\nlived in the district for 47 years\n\nsaid it was the heaviest fall\n\nhe had ever seen.\n\nThe fall had been general\n\nthroughout the district. Win-\n\ngen is 11 miles north of Scone.\n\nA light fall of snow is also\n\nreported from Muswellbrook.\n\nEarly today snow is reported\n\nto have fallen on Bell's Moun-\n\ntain, about two miles north-east\n\nof the town. Light rain later\n\nmelted the snow in this area.\n\nAnother Cold Night\n\nMr. R. W. Parker, of Mere-\n\nwether, forecasts that little re-\n\nlief can be expected and he an-\n\nticipates another very cold\n\nnight.\n\nConditions during the week-\n\nend are expected to be fair with\n\ncold, brisk north-west to south-\n\nwest winds.\n\nHeavy overcoats, scarves and\n\nmittens gave little protection or\n\nwarmth to early morning work-\n\ners as they hurried to their jobs.\n\nThe wind blew in gusts which\n\nreached up to 35 miles an hour.\n\nAlthough skies were overcast\n\nduring most of the night, little\n\nrain fell, only four points being\n\nregistered for the 24 hours end-\n\ned 9 a.m.\n\nIndicating how the cold snap\n\nhad developed, Mr. Parker says\n\nthat the maximum temperature\n\nyesterday was 65.5 degrees, but\n\nthis had dropped to 42 degrees\n\nby 10 o'clock last night.\n\nLight Rain\n\nThe minimum temperature of\n\n41 degrees was recorded in the\n\nearly hours of the morning.\n\nThe minimum temperature\n\nrecorded at Nobbys was 42 de-\n\ngrees, and the temperature at\n\nNobbys at 8.30 a.m. was 43\n\ndegrees.\n\nAlthough light rain continued\n\nto fall after 9 a.m. registra-\n\ntions were negligible.\n\nMr. Parker recorded the mini-\n\nmum temperature ol 41 degrees\n\nduring the early hours of this\n\nmorning. At 6 a.m. it was 45\n\ndegrees, but dropped to 44 de-\n\ngrees at 9 a.m.\n\nThere was a slight clearing\n\nin the weather between 11 a.m.\n\nand noon, but temperatures,\n\nthough rising slightly, remained\n\nlow.\n\nCessnock experienced its\n\ncoldest day this year with a\n\nminimum of 39 degrees about 5\n\na.m. At 11 a.m. the mercury\n\nhad risen to 42 degrees.\n\nAlthough there was a cutting\n\nwind there are no reports of\n\nsnowfalls on the mountains\n\nwest of Cessnock.\n\n(Continued on Page 2.)\n\nSnow Falls\n\nThree States\n\n(Continued From Page 1.)\n\nSYDNEY.—A cold, wet, week-\n\nend with biting southerly winds\n\nis forecast by the Weather Bu-\n\nreau. More rain and low tem-\n\nperatures are indicated for the\n\nentire State.\n\nEarly this morning heavy\n\nsnow was falling at Mt. Vic-\n\ntoria (Blue Mountains). The\n\ntemperature was 31 degrees.\n\nAt 6 a.m. the temperature at\n\nSydney Weather Bureau was\n\n45.6 degrees—2½ degrees below\n\nthe average daily minimum for\n\nJune.\n\nRainfall to 6 a.m. was 95\n\npoints.\n\nA bureau spokesman said the\n\ncold snap was expected to last\n\nat least until Monday.\n\nThe Weather Bureau said\n\nthat most of the State is in an\n\nicy grip, the highest minimum\n\ntemperature being only 49 de-\n\ngrees at Moruya Heads and\n\nBega. Coldest place was Guyra,\n\nwith a minimum reading of 23\n\ndegrees.\n\nHeavy snow began last night\n\nat Kandos and Rylstone and\n\ncontinued until 2 a.m. today.\n\nThe fall at Mt. Victoria was\n\nthe heaviest for more than 10\n\nyears and at 11 a.m. it was\n\nnine inches deep.\n\nKosciusko is blanketed in\n\nsnow up to five feet deep as\n\nfar as Jindabyne, with heavy\n\nsnow still falling.\n\nFor the first time for 50 years\n\nsnow fell at Narrabri early to\n\nday.\n\nBRISBANE.—Heavy snow fell\n\nin the Stanthorpe district for\n\nseveral hours today. One resi-\n\ndent at Glenaplin (seven miles\n\nfrom Stanthorpe) said it was\n\nthe heaviest fall he had seen\n\nin this district for 30 years.\n\nMELBOURNE—In Melbourne\n\ntoday it was cold and showery.\n\nYesterday the season's first\n\nsnow fell in the hills near the\n\ncity, but today's early morning\n\nrain washed it away.\n\nThere were heavy falls at Mt\n\nDonna Duang and Mt. Mace-\n\ndon, but the snow is not expect-\n\ned to last over tomorrow."
