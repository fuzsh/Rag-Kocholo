        "text": "The Bureau of Meteorology has confirmed several towns have set temperature records after a freezing morning across the country's south-east.\n\nOne location experienced its coldest morning on record, while others shivered through their coldest June morning.\n\nScone, in the state's Upper Hunter region, recorded its equal coldest temperature on record of -5.1 degrees.\n\nThe last time the town got that cold was in August 1991 in 33 years of data records.\n\nMeteorologist Helen Reid said the cold temperatures were due to a compounding effect after a series of small cold fronts.\n\n\"Quite often between cold fronts you have time for the air temperature to get a bit warmer again,\" she said.\n\n\"But on these occasions we haven't so we've just had cold air followed by more cold air.\n\nColdest June morning\n\nSeveral locations across regional NSW experienced their coldest June morning on record:\n\nBathurst: -7.5 degrees, records going back 33 years\n\nHillston: -4 degrees, records going back 64 years\n\nPeak Hill: -2.8 degrees, records going back 56 years\n\nPaterson: -0.3 degrees, records going back 54 years\n\nThe bureau had earlier thought Richmond, north-west of Sydney, had set a record of -6.2 degrees, but the data is now being reviewed after some discrepancies were identified.\n\nStuart Hordern, a winemaker at Pokolbin in the state's Hunter Valley, said it felt like the coldest start to the day since the drought, roughly four years ago.\n\nHe said the freezing conditions did not stop people from working.\n\n\"Our vineyard weather station tipped out at -3.4 this morning, so certainly the chilliest start to the day we've had this year,\" Mr Hordern said.\n\nCold in Canberra, other states stay warm\n\nMs Reid said Canberra Airport set a June record of -7.2 degrees, but the data there only dates back 15 years.\n\nClimatologists typically use 30 years of records as the benchmark for determining if a record has been set.\n\n\"It's possibly in the honourable mention category for the Canberra Airport,\" Ms Reid said.\n\nMs Reid said cloud cover associated with a cold front moving through central parts of the country has kept other parts of the state warm.\n\n\"That cloud overnight, whilst it doesn't let the daytime be warm, overnight it does mean the temperatures don't get quite as cold,\" she said.\n\nWith that cold front set to pass over NSW, temperatures are not expected to get as cold on Thursday morning."
