Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Newcastle is essentially constant during the winter, remaining around 0% throughout.\n\nFor reference, on February 6, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 49% of the time, while on June 20, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in the Winter in Newcastle\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in the Winter in NewcastleJunJulAug0%0%10%10%20%20%30%30%40%40%50%50%60%60%70%70%80%80%90%90%100%100%FallSpringJun 10%Jun 10%Aug 310%Aug 310%Jul 10%Jul 10%Aug 10%Aug 10%humidhumidcomfortablecomfortabledrydry\n\ndry 55Â°F comfortable 60Â°F humid 65Â°F muggy 70Â°F oppressive 75Â°F miserable\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Newcastle is essentially constant during the winter, remaining within 0.3 miles per hour of 7.9 miles per hour throughout.\n\nFor reference, on June 24, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 8.2 miles per hour, while on April 7, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 6.9 miles per hour.\n\nThe highest daily average wind speed during the winter is 8.2 miles per hour on June 24.\n\nAverage Wind Speed in the Winter in Newcastle\n\nAverage Wind Speed in the Winter in NewcastleJunJulAug0 mph0 mph2 mph2 mph4 mph4 mph6 mph6 mph8 mph8 mph10 mph10 mph12 mph12 mphFallSpringJun 248.2 mphJun 248.2 mphJun 17.6 mphJun 17.6 mphAug 317.7 mphAug 317.7 mphAug 18.0 mphAug 18.0 mphNowNow\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in Newcastle throughout the winter is predominantly from the west, with a peak proportion of 51% on July 2.\n\nWind Direction in the Winter in Newcastle\n\nWind Direction in the Winter in NewcastleSWJunJulAug0%100%20%80%40%60%60%40%80%20%100%0%FallSpringNowNowwestsouthnortheast\n\nnortheastsouthwest\n\nWater Temperature\n\nNewcastle is located near a large body of water (e.g., ocean, sea, or large lake). This section reports on the wide-area average surface temperature of that water.\n\nThe average surface water temperature in Newcastle is decreasing during the winter, falling by 4Â°F, from 68Â°F to 65Â°F, over the course of the season.\n\nThe lowest average surface water temperature during the winter is 65Â°F on August 18.\n\nAverage Water Temperature in the Winter in Newcastle\n\nAverage Water Temperature in the Winter in NewcastleJunJulAug62Â°F62Â°F64Â°F64Â°F66Â°F66Â°F68Â°F68Â°F70Â°F70Â°F72Â°F72Â°F74Â°F74Â°FFallSpringAug 1865Â°FAug 1865Â°FJun 168Â°FJun 168Â°FJul 166Â°FJul 166Â°FAug 165Â°FAug 165Â°FNowNow\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nTemperatures in Newcastle are sufficiently warm year round that it is not entirely meaningful to discuss the growing season in these terms. We nevertheless include the chart below as an illustration of the distribution of temperatures experienced throughout the year.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in the Winter in Newcastle\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in the Winter in NewcastleJunJulAug0%100%10%90%20%80%30%70%40%60%50%50%60%40%70%30%80%20%90%10%100%0%FallSpring99%Jul 1799%Jul 17NowNowvery coldcoldcoolcomfortablewarm\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Newcastle are very rapidly decreasing during the winter, decreasing by 4,588Â°F, from 4,921Â°F to 333Â°F, over the course of the season.\n\nGrowing Degree Days in the Winter in Newcastle\n\nGrowing Degree Days in the Winter in NewcastleJunJulAug1,000Â°F1,000Â°F2,000Â°F2,000Â°F3,000Â°F3,000Â°F4,000Â°F4,000Â°F5,000Â°F5,000Â°FFallSpringJun 14,921Â°FJun 14,921Â°FAug 31333Â°FAug 31333Â°FJul 10Â°FJul 10Â°FAug 1140Â°FAug 1140Â°F\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Newcastle is rapidly increasing during the winter, rising by 1.8 kWh, from 2.7 kWh to 4.6 kWh, over the course of the season.\n\nThe lowest average daily incident shortwave solar energy during the winter is 2.6 kWh on June 15.\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in the Winter in Newcastle\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in the Winter in NewcastleJunJulAug0 kWh0 kWh1 kWh1 kWh2 kWh2 kWh3 kWh3 kWh4 kWh4 kWh5 kWh5 kWh6 kWh6 kWh7 kWh7 kWhFallSpringJun 152.6 kWhJun 152.6 kWhAug 314.6 kWhAug 314.6 kWhJul 12.8 kWhJul 12.8 kWhAug 13.4 kWhAug 13.4 kWhNowNow\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Newcastle are -32.927 deg latitude, 151.776 deg longitude, and 69 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Newcastle contains only modest variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 269 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 17 feet. Within 10 miles contains only modest variations in elevation (541 feet). Within 50 miles contains significant variations in elevation (2,638 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Newcastle is covered by water (60%), artificial surfaces (22%), and sparse vegetation (11%), within 10 miles by water (51%) and trees (29%), and within 50 miles by trees (46%) and water (46%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Newcastle, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 3 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Newcastle.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Newcastle according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at Newcastle is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Newcastle and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nNewcastle Airport (YWLM, 92%, 10 mi, north, -39 ft elevation change)\n\nRichmond (YSRI, 4.4%, 74 mi, southwest, -3 ft elevation change)\n\nSydney International Airport (YSSY, 4.0%, 79 mi, southwest, -49 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Newcastle and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
