        "text": "The storage room for glass plate negatives, National Archives of Thailand\n\nDating from 1855 to 1935, the collection of over 35,000 glass plate negatives and some 50,000 prints—originally issuing from the private collections of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V), King Vajiravudh (Rama VI), and Prince Damrong Rajanubhab—had once been kept at the Phra Vajirayana Royal Library, the forerunner of today’s National Library of Thailand. The collection covers such an extensive time period that some of the photos encapsulate entire human lifespans. Consider, for example, the photo of Prince Asdang Dejavudh (1889–1924), son of King Chulalongkorn and Queen Saovabha Phongsri, as a playful young boy.\n\nKing Chulalongkorn and Tsar Nicholas II in St. Petersburg, 1897\n\nThe photos in the royal collection not only chronicle special occasions of national and international significance; they often offer an unexpectedly intimate glimpse into everyday palace life. At a time when conservative courtiers harboured superstitions that photography would capture their souls and cause untimely death, King Mongkut (r. 1851–1868) and the succeeding King Chulalongkorn (r. 1868–1910) enthusiastically embraced the relatively new technology. According to Savitri Suwansathit, vice-chair of the Thai National Committee on the Memory of the World Programme of UNESCO, King Chulalongkorn encouraged the ladies of the court to practice photography, and the five consorts from the Bunnag family (known collectively as 'Chaochom Kok Aw') would come to be especially admired for their photographic skills and artistry.\n\nChaochom Erb, one of the 'Chaochom Kok Aw', preparing to take a photo of her father, Chaophraya Suraphanphisut (Thet Bunnag)\n\nOne extraordinary photo of King Chulalongkorn in his later years shows him pensively looking out of the window at Vimanmek Mansion. In a captivating contrast to formal portrayals of the monarch in full royal regalia, the photo makes the viewer almost feel like an intruder upon a rarely witnessed moment of private reflection.\n\nKing Chulalongkorn at Vimanmek Mansion\n\nThe collection also contains some spectacular visual records of various sites in the historic heart of Bangkok. For instance, Saphan Han (literally, 'turn bridge') was originally built during the reign of King Phutthayotfa Chulalok (Rama I, r. 1782–1809), and indeed a section of it would rotate to allow oversized vessels to pass unimpeded. The bridge subsequently underwent several reincarnations. Most notably, at King Chulalongkorn’s behest, Saphan Han was newly designed to incorporate features from two iconic bridges in Italy: the bowed expanse of the Rialto Bridge in Venice and the shops lining the Ponte Vecchio in Florence.\n\nThe base of the Giant Swing in December 2023\n\nWithout such exceptional snapshots of history, our collective memory and understanding of how the past connects to the present would be considerably impoverished. In recognition of the significance of this documentary heritage—both in regard to its content as well as the carrier of said content (namely, glass plates as a historic capture medium preceding the advent of photographic film)—the Royal Photographic Glass Plate Negatives and Original Prints Collection was inscribed on UNESCO’s Memory of the World International Register in 2017.\n\nIn keeping with the aims of UNESCO’s Memory of the World programme, Ms Nitcha said that the entire royal collection has been scanned and catalogued in an effort to improve accessibility, while also safeguarding the original documents.\n\nNitcha Jariyasetkarn holding mounted prints of Prince Damrong Rajanubhab\n\nIn addition, NAT has been raising awareness about this documentary heritage by organising exhibitions (one of which is still available in an engaging virtual format) and publishing two books of captioned photos from the royal collection thus far.\n\nMs Nitcha noted that it is not always clear what person, place, or event is being shown in certain photos, so NAT assembled a committee of experts from various fields to determine the most informative captions for them. In the near future, NAT plans to launch a digital platform for crowdsourcing inputs from the public, subject to expert verification, to enrich and expedite the captioning process.\n\nWith its staggering range of subject matter conveyed through the impactful immediacy of the visual medium, the Royal Photographic Collection introduces the curious viewer to a world of intriguing stories, wherein the relative brevity of an individual’s life is foregrounded against larger themes that reflect the persistence of collective human efforts across the generations to propel the social, economic, and cultural development of a nation dynamically in transition.\n\nThis is a lightly adapted version of an article that first appeared in the Bangkok Post, on 5 February 2024.\n\n#DocumentaryHeritage #MemoryOfTheWorld"
