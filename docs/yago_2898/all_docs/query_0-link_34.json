        "text": "Chula Chakrabongse (Thai language: จุลจักรพงษ์; rtgs: Chunlachakkraphong; 28 March 1908 – 30 December 1963), was a member of the family of the Chakri Dynasty of Thailand and of the House of Chakkraphong. He was the only child of Prince Chakrabongse Bhuvanath and his Ukrainian wife, Ekaterina (Catherine) Desnitska (later Mom Catherine Na Phitsanulok). He was a grandson of King Chulalongkorn.\n\nEarly life[]\n\nPrince Chula Chakrabongse was born on 28 March 1908 in Paruskavan Palace, Bangkok, with the title Mom Chao (His Serene Highness). Saovabha Phongsri, his grandmother, gave him the name Phongchak (พงษ์จักร; Template:Rtgs). Later his uncle, King Vajiravudh, raised him the higher rank of Phra Chao Worawong Thoe Phra Ong Chao (His Royal Highness Prince) and changed his name to Chunlachakkraphong. Palace officials affectionately called him \"the Little Prince\" (ท่านพระองค์หนู Than Phraong Nu).\n\nWhen very young, Chula was sent to study in the United Kingdom, where he spent his teenage years, attending Harrow School. He graduated with Bachelor and Master from Trinity College, University of Cambridge.\n\nLater life[]\n\nIn 1938 he married Elizabeth Hunter, an English woman (known as Lisba). Their daughter, Mom Rajawongse Narisa Chakrabhongse, was born in 1956.[1] [2] They lived at Tredethy, St Mabyn, in Cornwall in the 1940s and 1950s.[3]\n\nWhen Prince Chula's cousin Prince Birabongse Bhanudej (\"B. Bira\") went to England in 1927, Chula was supervising a racing team called White Mouse Racing.[4] Prince Bira decided to drive for him.\n\nIn 1936 Chula's White Mouse team purchased an ERA for Bira, and he quickly became one of the leading exponents of this class of international racing. Bira's partnership with Chula ended in late 1948.\n\nPrince Chula was the author of thirteen books, including a history of the Chakri Dynasty, a biography about the race-car driver Richard Seaman and an autobiography.\n\nPrince Chula died of cancer in 1963 at the age of 55.\n\nTitles and styles[]\n\n28 March 1908 – 1923: His Serene Highness Prince Phongchak\n\n(Thai language: หม่อมเจ้าพงษ์จักร; Template:Rtgs)\n\n1923 – 30 December 1963: His Royal Highness Prince Chula Chakrabongse\n\n(Thai language: พระเจ้าวรวงศ์เธอ พระองค์เจ้าจุลจักรพงษ์; Template:Rtgs)\n\nOrders and decorations[]\n\nThai honours[]\n\nKnight of The Most Illustrious Order of the Royal House of Chakri (19 February 1933)\n\nKnight Grand Cordon (Special Class) of The Most Illustrious Order of Chula Chom Klao\n\nKnight Grand Cordon (Special Class) of the Order of the White Elephant\n\nKnight Grand Cordon (Special Class) of the Order of the Crown of Thailand\n\nKing Rama VI Royal Cypher Medal, Third Class\n\nKing Rama VII Royal Cypher Medal, First Class\n\nKing Rama VIII Royal Cypher Medal, First Class\n\nKing Rama IX Royal Cypher Medal, First Class\n\nForeign honors[]\n\nHonorary Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (United Kingdom, 2 February 1938[5])\n\nReferences[]\n\nBibliography[]\n\nAutobiography\n\nChula Chakrabongse (1989) (in Thai).
