        "text": "Queen Sirikit's Jewelry Collection\n\nAs Mother's Day is just around the corner, we wanted to pay homage to the ravishing Queen Mother of Thailand. This year, 2020, Queen Sirikit will complete 88 years, so let us celebrate by taking a look at her beautiful collection of exquisite jewelry over the years.\n\nConvertible Necklace Tiara\n\nThe Queen Mother is just as resourceful as us commoners, by making the most use of her luxury jewels. A modern tiara set with diamonds, the largest diamonds can be switched out with a set of sapphires, and able to be taken off its frame and worn as a necklace. Made by Van Cleef and Arpels for Queen Sirikit in the early 1960s, this modern diamond tiara was originally worn as a necklace, hence why it wraps around the heard, and has been a favorite of Queen Sirikit over the decades for a plethora of important State visits and galas.\n\nThai Diamond Fringe Tiara\n\nThe versatile Diamond Fringe Tiara, which can be worn on in an open 'halo' or a coronet form, as well as a necklace, is one of the oldest pieces in the Thai Royal collection, thought to date from Queen Saovabha Phongsri, whose husband, King Chulalongkorn acquired many gifts during his travels in Europe. This tiara was first pictured on Queen Rambhai Barni in the 1920s, and usually worn as a necklace by Queen Sirikit until the 1970's, when she started regularly wearing the piece as a tiara, most recently during the Swedish State Visit in 2003.\n\nThai Traditional Tiara\n\nAnother piece made by Van Cleef and Arpels in 1960, this tiara is inspired by the design of a traditional Thai diadem, set with large yellow diamonds, with a central section that can be removed and worn seperately as a bandeau or a bracelet. The tiara was frequently worn during King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Queen Sirikit's tour of Europe and the United States in the 1960s, and was regularly worn afterwards, also being loaned to Princess Bejaratana and Princess Soamsawali.\n\nFloral Bandeau Tiara\n\nThe modern Diamond floral bandeau tiara features large central blossoms, that has convertible diamond and ruby settings. While the maker is not known, it's safe to assume it could be from Van Cleef & Arpels alike her other jewelry. The tiara was frequently worn during King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Queen Sirikit's long tour of Europe and the United States in the 1960's, but disappeared after that, and might have been remade into the diamond necklace tiara, which appeared around that time.\n\nFloral Bandeau Tiara\n\nThis striking, large tiara featuring distinct modern diamond floral designs, probably from Van Cleef & Arpels as well, was worn by Queen Sirikit in the 1980s, notably for a portrait and the Spanish State visit. Looking at the wrap around design, the tiara may be able to be worn as a necklace as well, thought it hasn't been seen for years.\n\nCoronation Tiara\n\nAn antique and traditional Thai tiara made of gold and rose cut diamonds, Queen Sirikit only wore her coronation tiara twice, at her coronation and once in the 1960s, and it is unknown if it still exists.\n\nSapphire Parure\n\nQueen Sirikit also owns a Sapphire Parure that includes a necklace with a detachable pendant, a pair of earrings and a flower brooch. The Parure was also worn with the sapphire version of the diamond necklace tiara, most notably for a British state visit, but has also been worn with other tiaras or just by itself."
