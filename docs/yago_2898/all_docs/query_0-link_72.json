        "text": "Ko Si Chang (Si Chang Island) is located in the province of Chonburi, not far from Bangkok. Surely, what most people or travellers would remember most about Chonburi province would definitely be Pattaya beach, an entertainment beach city located to the east of Bangkok, capital of Thailand. Pattaya, just like its southern counterpart, Phuket, Pattaya has long enjoyed the ever popular destination choice of those who travelled to Thailand not only for its beach but also for a diverse choice of both international and thai food as well as great number of seafood restaurants with variety of choices, huge shopping options and full range of entertainment choices. There are so many activities to fill up one's stay in Pattaya such as swimming at the beach, shopping at Central Festival and Pattaya Floating Market, get entertained with the ladyboy show at Alcazar, having seafood at Jomtien beach, visiting the Mini Siam, a park displaying replicas of many landmark buildings within Thailand and the world, visit the Sanctuary of Truth, an awesome Thai temple made from wood without the use of single nails to seal the wooden structure and go party all night long at the Walking Street, all of which I had done during my few visits to Pattaya. For this trip to Chonburi province, I travelled to Ko Si Chang, a small island off the mainland which requires ferry crossing from the Si Racha pier. The travel time on ferry from Si Racha pier to Ko Si Chang takes about 45 minutes which costs THB50 one way. There is an option when it comes to trip to Ko Si Chang. I stayed over one night at the island which I thought was not necessary simply because when the sun sets down, there isn't really much to do over at Ko Si Chang. So, the best choice is to do the trip to Ko Si Chang for a day trip travelling the earliest time possible and returned to Si Racha over the last ferry trip. But, its up to the individual. As for me, there can still be some activity to cheer up the night like having dinner over at some of the restaurants scattered around the island's main street, the Asdang Road. This is also a chance to have chats with the locals and get to know more about Ko Si Chang. Ko Si Chang was considered a royal island during the reign of King Rama V (King Chulalongkorn) where he ordered the construction of a summer palace on this island but was later abandoned when the French invaded the island before the palace was completed. What actually inspired King Chulalongkorn to built a palace in Ko Si Chang because his father King Rama IV (King Mongkut) travelled to this island frequently and noticed of the long life of people of Ko Si Chang. Before the construction of the palace took place, children of King Chulalongkorn, Prince Maha Vajiravudh and Prince Asdang Vejavudh and wife, Queen Saovabha Pongsri all fell ill and were sent to Ko Si Chang's lodge to recuperate from their illness in which they did. So King Chulalongkorn decided to built a summer palace at Ko Si Chang but was abandoned due to French assault on the island. The construction of the palace was then shifted to Bangkok in which the Vimanmek Mansion is located now. The site of which the supposed to be the ground of King Chulalongkorn's summer palace in Ko Si Chang has been preserved and maintained by the management of Chulalongkorn University with some new buildings and structure being constructed while the old ones being restored and renovated extensively for purpose of turning the palace ground and the structures including the old mansions together with the new structures to be a museum known as Chudhadhuj Rajthan Palace Museum. Some of the notable structures, buildings and mansions in this museum worth to take note include the King Rama V Memorial, with the statue of the king displayed for purpose of paying respect before touring the museum, the Asdangkanimit Temple Chedi-top Ordination Hall, the Stone Bell, which was said to create a bell sound when objects thrown at the big rocks, Phongsri Mansion, Vadhana Mansion, the garden of Summer Palace, Asdang Bridge and the Wooden House by the sea, where a coffee house is located for purpose of relaxing and chatting after a tour of the summer palace museum. The whole palace museum ground was covered with trees and lush greenery landscapes and beautifully, marvellously and proudly sits on the hilly area fronting the sea of Ko Si Chang. This is one of the major travel site and should not be missed when travel to Ko Si Chang. Other interesting spots on Ko Si Chang include the Chom Khao Kard, where visitors can get to view the ocean from this hill side viewpoint similar to that of the Promthep Cape in Phuket. The ocean view from Chom Khao Kard was simply magnificent and the cool sea breeze was so fresh and soothing. Another not to be missed place in Ko Si Chang is the Chinese temple which is located on the hill top with the main temple hall for worshipping purpose was at one of the cave area within the hill where the temple structure being built. This cave area of the Chinese temple is where a Father Spirit of a rock which transformed into a human shape face was located. Visitors of the temple can either reached the peak of the temple by walking the 500 steps staircase or to get a funicular train ride up the hill. The view from the temple's peak overlooking the villages at Ko Si Chang was just marvellous. Over in Ko Si Chang, it was believed that King Chulalongkorn has written on a rock which was placed on the ground of a football field according to the tuk-tuk driver that drove me around the island for a short tour but exactly how true was it, I cannot be sure. Of course when in Ko Si Chang, the seafood shall not be missed for simple reason, its inexpensive and definitely its fresh since its so close to the sea! One of the seafood restaurant not far from Charlie's Bungalow where I stayed name Pee Noi Seafood served some good seafood options. A detour to Bang Saen city for lunch on return to Bangkok from Ko Si Chang, was simply a right decision as the seafood in particular the steamed crab was just so good and the meat fresh and juicy. There are many stalls located along the beach of Bang Saen which is a very popular beach retreat city for Bangkok folks and surrounding provinces. This is also a city famous for the Bang Saen Speed Festival featuring the international race circuit competitions drawing car racers from around the world. It is quite a good place for relaxing and indulge in sun bathing and swimming. Just like any beach in Thailand, there are beach chairs and umbrellas being set up for purpose of unwind and food dining. These are mostly set up by food stall owners and they charged for the chairs even if you do not order any food or drinks. The Thai government under the temporary military rule is trying to curb on such operators possibly due to tourists complaints that they were hogging the beach meant for free access. In fact, actions had been taken and the government are targeting beaches which frequented heavily by foreign travellers such as Pattaya, Phuket and Hua Hin. Other than the beach, another major attraction in Bang Saen is the Nha Ja Sa Tai Jue Shrine, a massive Chinese temple with extensive decorations depicting the dragon and possibly one of the biggest and most beautiful Chinese temple in Thailand.\n\nThe ticket booth for ferry ride from Si Racha pier to Ko Si Chang in Chonburi province\n\nThe ferry from Si Racha pier to Ko Si Chang\n\nThe ferry cruising in the middle of the sea from Si Racha pier to Ko Si Chang\n\nThe pier at Ko Si Chang\n\nA pillar signage at the pier in Ko Si Chang\n\nAccommodation in Ko Si Chang\n\nSeafood platter Ko Si Chang style at Pee Noi Seafood\n\nThe map of the Chudhadhuj Rajthan Palace Museum\n\nThe King Chulalongkorn statue at the Chudhadhuj Rajthan Palace Museum, Ko Si Chang\n\nThe palace garden at the Chudhadhuj Palace Museum\n\nThe lush greenery surrounding the Chudhadhuj Palace Museum compound\n\nThe signage to Asdangkhanimit Temple from the King Chulalongkorn statue\n\nThe staircase to Asdangkhanimit Temple\n\nThe forested area before reaching Asdangkhanimit Temple at Chudhadhuj Palace Museum\n\nThe Asdangkhanimit Temple structure\n\nTHE INTERIOR OF ASDANDKHANIMIT TEMPLE\n\nThe external view of Asdangkhanimit Temple\n\nThis way to Bell Stone and a Pagoda\n\nThe Stone Bell and Pagoda at Chudhadhuj Palace Museum, Ko Si Chang\n\nThe well-paved pedestrian walkways at Chudhadhuj Palace Museum\n\nThe Phongsri Mansion\n\nThe Phongsri Mansion from afar\n\nThe statue of King Chulalongkorn and his 3 children at Phongsri Mansion\n\nPotrait of Queen Saovabha Phongsri at Phongsri Mansion\n\nPotrait of King Rama VI (King Vajiravudh) at Phongsri Mansion\n\nA replica of Phongsri Mansion\n\nThe Vadhana Mansion at Chudhadhuj Palace Museum\n\nA plaque at Vadhana Mansion\n\nThe ground floor of Vadhana Mansion\n\nThe upper floor of Vadhana Mansion with multiple rooms\n\nOne of upper floor room at Vadhana Mansion\n\nA balcony of the Vadhana Mansion\n\nA view of the outside landscape from Vadhana Mansion upper floor\n\nThe Wooden House by the sea at Chudhadhuj Palace Museum\n\nThe interior of Wooden House by the sea at Chudhadhuj Palace Museum\n\nThe sea view from The Wooden House at Chudhadhuj Palace Museum\n\nA distance signage near the Asdang Bridge at Chudhadhuj Palace Museum\n\nThe Asdang Bridge from afar\n\nThe signage and huge signboard at Chom Khao Kard or the Viewpoint\n\nChom Khao Kard with breathtaking sea view at Ko Si Chang\n\nThe Chinese Temple @ Ko Si Chang\n\nThe funicular train to the Chinese Temple at Ko Si Chang\n\nThe view of villages and sea while riding on the funicular train to the Chinese Temple at ko Si Chang\n\nThe Chinese Temple interiors at Ko Si Chang\n\nThe view from the peak of Chinese Temple at Ko Si Chang\n\nThe entrance to the cave temple at Chinese Temple @ Ko Si Chang\n\nThe cave opening at Chinese Temple @ Ko Si Chang\n\nThe Father Spirit transformed from a rock at the cave of Chinese Temple @ Ko Si Chang\n\nThe rock with written inscription said to be that of King Chulalongkorn @ Ko Si Chang\n\nReaching Bang Saen city from Si Racha\n\nA crumbling boat at Band Saen beach\n\nA welcome signage at Bang Saen beach\n\nDelicious steam crab for lunch at Bang Saen beach\n\nRelaxing at Bang Saen beach\n\nTHE NHA JA SA TAI JUE SHRINE AT BANG SAEN, CHONBURI PROVINCE"
