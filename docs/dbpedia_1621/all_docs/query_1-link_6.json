Donated by Mr and Mrs C. P. Curran through the Friends of the National Collections of Ireland, 1935.\n\nObject number712\n\nDescriptionJohn B Flannagan chose to follow a more experimental route in sculpture. From 1922-26 he practiced both painting and sculpture. His subject matter was then strongly religious. His second period from 1926-1930 was primarily defined by his work with stone. He experimented with all kinds of rock, quickly discarding smooth marbles in favour of rougher hewn materials such as natural stone. Indeed he felt that the field stone held a mystical image of its own. During this time the recurring theme of mother and child found statements in stone. Flannagan was placed in an orphanage as a young child for five years following the premature death of his father and separation from his mother.\n\nOn View\n\nNot on view"
