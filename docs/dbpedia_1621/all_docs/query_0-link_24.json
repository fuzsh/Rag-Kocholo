With regard to the American, however, once almost entirely English, the successive studies of its exponents in Paris and Rome have pro duced a definite deflection from the tradition, which is not by any means so marked in the English school, but both are still far from being indistinguishable from Continental work, either in spirit or in workmanship. The interest of the study of English and American sculpture is by way of being an immersion, that of Continental European an engrossment : there is much dignity in the former, but more fire in the latter. Anglo- American sculpture is fabricated, as a whole, with great technical ability and careful gravity, Continental sculpture with more temperament. In America and Great Britain artists are often made : those of the Continent of Europe are often born. There is a differ ence in the artists, and therefore a difference in their work. The born sculptor will produce what the made sculptor will shudder at ; a piece in bad taste, in poor material, with a technique that leaves something to be desired, but the bom sculptor will shudder at the cold- mess and want of abandon of the product of the made I B SCULPTURE OF TO-DAY sculptor. It must be realised that because an artist is a sculptor, it does not follow he must be cold and chaste. There is as much fire and passion in the veins of a piece of marble as in the weave of a stretch of canvas, and the English and American lover of art has just as much right to expect and find these qualities in the work of his compatriots, as in the work of a Spaniard or a Pole. He has been ruled too long by the acts of the apostles of sculpture ; he needs to relax a little, to run wil4 for a time, to become more natural and warmer-blooded, to revel in the fine vision of an act of revelation* He will do well if he demands from his compatriots some of the abandon he finds in the work of the artists of the Continent, and that is a large field, in which there is an infinite variety of material for exploitation* The English hierarchs in sculpture are a compact band, mostly impervious to modern and continental influ ences, but accomplished in their methods, concerning which they have very little to learn* Their work is easily recognised, and instantly commands the respect due to steady and studied convictions* Some of them are Royal Academicians, although no sculptor as such has been President of the Royal Academy, the nearest approach for sculpture to that honour being in the person of Lord Leighton, of whom it is said, however, in certain quarters that he was a greater sculptor than painter. If there is any truth in this suggestion it is curious that Leighton did not become one of the hier archs in sculpture, for his personality and paintings exhibited all the symptoms. It is this settled conviction and a sturdy complacency concerning their work on the part of certain British sculptors that is responsible for THE PRESENTATION OF SCULPTURE the character of much of British sculpture. They have acquiesced in the tradition too readily ; have become stereotyped too soon ; their wooing of Datne Nature has been too short. Nature is constantly changing, while tradition is as constantly fortifying itself against any change whatsoever. Fine as their work is, the hierarchs might have improved it if they had cared to work with a freer hand and a freer mind. There is no reproach in being academic and none in being hieratic, the only concern is the attitude. Life is still a great factor where art is concerned, and if art tends to lose its vitality and virility it lays itself open to the danger of becoming sterile. I do not think for a moment that there is any danger of the kind apparent in any modern school of sculpture, but an attitude is dangerous, if entirely innocent, and may not only affect an artist's own work, and through him that of lesser artists, but the man in the artist may carry the attitude into other affairs and judge so that he may not be judged, thus losing the open mind. The artist who is too idle to meditate is lost. In his inertia he has forgotten to ponder upon his work, and he does it mechanically and thinks only of its popular success. He has become so facile that the effort required for a new monument is reduced to a minimum, and if an artist gives too little time to his own work he will not find time to interest himself in the works of others. If he is so strongly entrenched in his own studio, he will miss the spirit of the time as it grows in strength in the studios of the younger men. Imitation is an in sidious form of degeneracy in the young, but the artist who is too old to simulate youth is lost. SCULPTURE OF TO-DAY Art is bound to improve ; it must not stand still, and there was never a period of which it can be said that improvement was not desirable, and an old artist , one who has deservedly achieved a high reputation and one whose work is admired and loved, cannot throw off his responsibility for the art he has practised so well. There is the younger generation to think of, and there are the future generations, too. It should become a law unto himself, therefore, that he will do all he can to foster the appreciation of his art. It is not enough he has given it to the world ; there are further duties* No sculptor has sprung into fame in a night as no poet ever has. Works of art take many years to produce, and their appreciation takes many years to grow. The art of sculpture might be better loved if sculptors made it better known. There should be a constant effort to educate the public in beauty, and there is no better medium than sculpture, and it must be the concern of the sculptors to spread this knowledge by the wide publicity which is required in this wonderful world of millions aching for the secrets of culture. The hier- archs must come down from their pedestals and leave no stone unturned, however unsuitable it may happen to be. It is this hieratic assumption that has made British sculpture especially insular in its character, but America has been affected by it* In one aspect it is useful, for it gives decisive character, but in another it is dangerous, for it clogs development and obscures the open mind. It is not only in England and America, however, that the hierarchs rule ; they do so everywhere : it it their custom, function and privilege, for to rule is 4 THE PRESENTATION OF SCULPTURE right, and to be ruled is not a bad form of asceticism. A rigorous discipline is good for every artist, and it should be practised by all. The younger artists of the Continent are more intolerant of discipline than their English and American brothers, and they are more restless under control. They are less inclined to follow the lead of established reputations, and often make a point of ridiculing them. In this they lose a good deal, for to substitute persiflage for dignity does not make for development so much as for degeneration. The ideal attitude would be the acceptance of the hierarchical tradition, allied with an ever-increasing devotion to Dame Nature, and combined with additional incur sions into the domain of psychology. All this has nothing to do with academies and societies as such, but rather with individuals as human beings and as part of the body politic. The hierarchs exist inside and outside the academies and societies, and complain of the neglect of sculpture, or stoically more or less endure. Individuals could do a good deal to discount the current state of things, for which indeed they are partly responsible, but academies and societies might easily become more useful in exercising the function of publicity, and it would seem that the world must nowadays look to them for the propagation of the gospel of beauty in foreign parts, as individual ism becomes more and more impossible. Owing, no doubt, to the difficulties of conveyance, British sculpture has been seen very inadequately on the Continent of Europe, and American sculpture still less. Paris is the only city which has had decent oppor tunities of making an acquaintance with British and SCULPTURE OF TO-DAY American sculptors. Rome, Venice, Munich, Vienna and Barcelona know something, but not much* Even the Venice International exhibitions, which began in 1895, had no British sculpture until 1901, and then only a medal by George Frampton* In 1903, however, there was a bust by Frampton of Alfred East, and by 1905 a spurt had been made to the extent of including ten bronzes and one plaster cast, These included works by Gilbert Bayes, Frampton, Furse, Goscombe John, Hamo Thornycroft, and Derwent Wood, In the next exhibition, however, the English works were reduced to three, but in 1909 the British sculptors included were, besides Frampton and Derwent Wood, Drury* Pomeroy, and Poole* In varying numbers the following exhibitions served to inform the Continent of something that was being done, but even as late as 1914 there were less than a dozen British works, but three of them, by Derwent Wood and Pomeroy, were in marble. It is to be hoped that a better state of things will be estab lished if, and when, a development of International Art Exhibitions takes place, when difficulties of transport have been lessened, and that not only British, but American sculpture will have the opportunity of proving to Europe the status they have both acquired* For the Venice exhibitions have never kcked sculp ture from the other continental nations* As far back as the beginning of the century, Hungary was repre sented by five sculptors ; Belgium by half a dozen and France by the same number ; Spain and Germany were also represented. In 1914 the number of sculptors had grown very greatly and new nations had come in : Norway with Lars Utne and Ingebrigt Vik ; Poland 6 THE PRESENTATION OF SCULPTURE with Luis de Puget, Xavery Dunikowski and Henri Hochmann ; and Hungary with Filippo Beck, Eugenic Bory, Giuseppe Damko, Giovanni Istok, B61a Markup, and G&za Rubletzky. Holland was represented by J. C. Altorf, Toon Dupuis, and J. Mendes da Costa ; Belgium by Georges Minne, Egide Rombaux and Victor Rousseau ; France by Bourdelle ; Germany by Franz Bernauer, Hans Adolf Buhler, Arthur Lewin- Funcke, Ludwig Manzel, Paul Oesten ; and Russia by lUa Gunzbourg. If it is a pity that English sculpture is not exhibited abroad, it is no less so that work from Paris and Brussels, Venice, Naples and Rome, Stockholm, Chris- tiania and Copenhagen, Madrid and Barcelona is not seen to any great extent in England and New York. London is very far behind in securing modern representative works from the Continent- Brighton has done a good deal in having exhibitions of the art of Spain, Belgium, Holland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Serbia ; and the director, Mr. Henry D. Roberts, and his far- seeing committee, are to be congratulated on including sculpture, yet something on a large scale remains to be done in England, while in the United States it is de plorable that out of 386 works of art at the 1920 In ternational Exhibition of the Carnegie Institute at Pitteburg, only thirteen of them were sculpture, and those all by one artist, and he not living Rodin. How much might the American art-loving public, and the art of sculpture benefit if proper representation were made at this important and world-known exhibition. The way has been shewn at the Panama International Exposition, where some attempt was made to deal SCULPTURE OF TO-DAY with sculpture, but much more is urgently needed, and might so easily be accomplished. It would seem almost that at Pittsburg that part of the Mosaic law which forbids graven images was being adhered to except in the case of Rodin, and such a reading is un necessarily hard on the sculptors, and on those who care for the art and desire a wider and deeper know ledge of it. Some progress has been made in the better representation of sculpture by the formation of sculp tors' societies, and in this direction even the hierarcha have lent their aid, although with mixed motives, but the mere fact that they have so unbent is in itself a hopeful sign. The Society of British Sculptors was virtually estab lished at a meeting at the Royal Institute of Painters, in Piccadilly, on January nth, 1904, and its avowed objects were the advancement of sculpture and its better presentation to the public. A preliminary com mittee, consisting of George Frampton, chairman, and T. Stirling Lee, W. S. Frith, W. Reynolds-Stephens, D. McGill, F. Derwent Wood, and F, Lynn- Jenkins, had already made its report on the advisability of estab lishing such a society. Thomas Brock took the chair at the general meeting, Sir Charles Lawes-Wittewronge was made treasurer, and F* Lynn-Jenkins, honorary secretary, and the membership Hst, including Acad emicians, members of the International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers, and men outside any organisation, indicated the universal character of the scheme. On July ist, 1919, an ordinary general meeting of the society was held, at which the fourteenth aaatial report was read, from which it appeared that Sir Thomas 8 THE PRESENTATION OF SCULPTURE Brock was President and Treasurer, W, Reynolds- Stephens, Vice-President, and the council included at least two of the original committee-men and nine others, and about a hundred members. The war inter fered very considerably with the activities of the society, but these are to be revived in the near future, and the original aims of the founders promulgated afresh. There is plenty of work for the society to do. London is starved for sculpture, and the society should do its best to feed starving London. It is not enough to give it a few statuettes at long intervals ; London must have the bread of life as well, and plentifully, and the society should provide exhibitions of sculpture in all its forms and in plenty up and down a hungry land. The expense would be money well spent ; funds use fully invested, to put the matter on no higher plane. At the beginning of 1921 a reunion of the Society was held in London at a dinner, at which the new presi dent, Robert W. Colton, called on all sculptors to sup port the Society, The other body in Great Britain, which set out to foster sculpture and at first carried out its aim, is the International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers, Rodin was once its President, and Bourdelle and Maillol exhibited at its shows with their com patriots ; Italy and Belgium and the Scandinavian nations have been represented, but the society has fallen from its high estate. A sporadic appearance of sculpture has been made, but so badly seen as to be abortive. For several years no representative show has been held, not even a representative corridor show of small pieces by the younger sculptors ! Now the society SCULPTURE OF TO-DAY is somewhat disorganised, and it does not fulfil its international functions, particularly with regard to the art which is set in the forefront of its redundant title, but in this respect fails even more pointedly in regard to British art. The National Portrait Society, which, although not ostensibly committed to sculpture, should obviously serve the art, but it struggles along with a few isolated pieces from time to time, and allows the Academy to absorb all the statues, live busts and portrait reliefs that are being produced in London so freely and so welL There are at least two other portrait societies at which portraits in marble and bronze are as rare as snakes in Iceland, and the whole thing is reduced to an absurd ity. The art of sculpture is adversely criticised ; the Academy is invariably condemned, and yet the art flourishes only at the Academy, and the Academy is the only body which takes the trouble to foster it, even to the extent, in 1920, of providing beautiful tapestries for its environment ! Outside the Academy, the Acad emies of Scotland, Wales and Ireland and some of the larger provincial municipal galleries, the exhibition of sculpture on a large scale is impossible. Even the Royal Society of British Sculptors contents itself with the small private galleries of the Fine Art Society in Bond Street, when it should have the largest and best in London. The conditions that make this impossibility are very simple : the Grafton Galleries, the Galleries of the Royal Institute in Piccadilly the best in London for the purpose not to mention others of less importance, may be used for the exhibition of pktures, and an isolated piece of small sculpture^ but ID THE PRESENTATION OF SCULPTURE no further can they go because they have to be hired out for nightly dances, balls and conversaziones, and at these functions sculpture would be in the way, and awkward to move out of the way ; would, in fact, be a nuisance ! There are no words available with which to frame a suitable comment on this unhappy state of things. In the United States the National Sculpture Society fulfils a similar function , and it ante-dates by some ten years its British brother. Its expressed object is \" to spread the knowledge of good sculpture, to foster the taste for the best and encourage the production of the finest examples for the home, and as decorations on or in buildings, squares and parks and other suitable places ; in fact, to raise the standard of sculpture in all its branches/' The honorary president is Daniel C. French, and deceased members include Saint Gaudens, J. Q. A.Ward, and Bela L. Pratt. Most of the prominent sculptors of America, to the number of a hundred and twenty, are members, and the Society admits lay mem bers who are in sympathy with its object, and who work to bring it about. This is a real, practical method of spreading a taste for sculpture, and might very well be adopted in England and adapted to the existing con ditions* The main thing is to popularise sculpture ; to talk about it ; to look at it ; to demand it wherever it should be and is not. Half the joy of art is lost because sculpture is not sufficiently understood and appreciated, and sculptors could do a great deal more themselves to foster this popularity for their splendid art. The isolation of the artist will be a thing of the past in a hundred years* time, and there is no reason SCULPTURE OF TO-DAY why the sculptor of to-day should refrain from what his descendants will have to undertake, In Holland there is a similar society to the Royal British Sculptors, the Nederland Kring van Beeld- houwers, with headquarters at Haarlem, and of which Theo Van Reijn is the honorary secretary. This society consists of the younger sculptors and the rebels. Sup plementing this, but not devoting itself particularly to sculpture, is the Nederland in den Vreemde, the special function of which is to make Holland and Dutch art better known abroad, and the exhibitions of paintings and sculpture held at Brighton in 1920, and at White- chapel, in London, in 1921, were under its auspices, Paris is, of course, full of sculptors' coteries, and the various Salons provide ample scope for the exhibition of sculpture and the development of its appreciation. In Brussels, too, the Spring and Autumn Salons of the Soci6t6 Royale des Beaux-Arts pay great attention to contemporary sculpture, and in Spain, especially at Barcelona, foreign sculpture is honoured as it is not often honoured in other countries. In Denmark there is a New Sculptors' Society, which includes the accepted masters as well as the younger men, and Max Meden is the honorary secretary* It is known as Billedhuggerforeningen, and it strives to make sculpture better known and understood, which is a finer plan than forming a society for the purpose of getting sculpture paid for at regulation prices. No price is too high for works of art, but no price should be fixed for works of art by a trades union, nor should a body of artists ever aspire to make themselves into a close corporation for any purpose whatsoever, Heaven 12 THE PRESENTATION OF SCULPTURE knows, freedom is disappearing fast enough, let us pray that art, at any rate, will remain free for some time longer. A larger knowledge of what is being done in sculpture the world over is very desirable, and a rapprochement of sculptors will help still further. In London, at the galleries of the Royal Academy of Arts, at Burlington House, in 1921, a good beginning was made in this direction (one of the best post-war signs I have noticed) in the Exhibition of Spanish Art. There were nearly fifty pieces of sculpture in marble and bronze by modern Spanish sculptors included, and it is to be hoped that future years will be marked by > similar national exhibitions. The whole world of art ; needs concentration in these disintegrating days, and ) the various sculptors' societies I have mentioned might ^ well unite for certain international functions which would result in great advantages to the art ; inter national competition could not possibly fail to be of advantage* A valuable consolidating influence making for right eousness is the presence in Rome of the various national Schools of America, Great Britain, France, Spain, and other countries. In these the travelling artist and travel ling student of art finds a resting-place where he can , pause in his acquisition of knowledge and survey the ground, or in some of them continue his practical studies. So far as Great Britain is concerned, there are two institutions, the British Academy of Arts, the Director of which is Professor Antonio Sciortino, the sculptor, this being a teaching school primarily, but available also for purposes of research. The honorary secretary is Mr. E Carnana Dingli, who is always 13 SCULPTURE OF TO-DAY ready to further the interests of art in any direction, but especially of British and Italian art the Academy's home is the Palazzo Patrizi at 533 Via Margutta. The other institution is the British School in the Valle Giulia, the care of which is undertaken by the Royal Commission for the Exhibition in London of 1851. There are five faculties in the School : Archaeology ; History and Letters ; Architecture ; Painting ; En graving ; and Sculpture, and the last consists -for 1921 of Sir Thomas Brock, Sir George Frampton, Sir William Goscombe John, Sir William Hamo Thornycroft, Mr. Fred. W. Pomeroy and Sir Bertram Mackennal, all of the Royal Academy, Pro fessor J. Havard Thomas of the Slade School, and Mr, C. S. Jagger and Mr. Gilbert Ledward, representing the young men of the new generation of British Sculp tors. The British School administers the Rome Scholar ships, which are awarded annually. Similar work is done by the Rome schools of the other nations, and the value of all this is very great, particularly in spreading a knowledge of international sculpture and the other arts, and in establishing and maintaining a standard which can be applied when the art student or the traveller returns home when his wander-years are accomplished. After all is said, I am afraid it will be many years before the streets and squares of the great cities of the world will contain modern sculpture of other countries. It is true that Bruce-Joy's King Edward VII is in the English Chamber of Commerce at Paris, that Bartlett*s Lafayette is in the Place du Carrousel, that Barnard *s Abraham Lincoln is at Manchester, and the Abraham 14 THE PRESENTATION OF SCULPTURE Lincoln of Saint Gaudens in London, not many yards from Rodin's Burghers of Calais ; that Derwent Wood's William Pitt, Earl of Chatham, is in Washington, but these examples and the few more that could be added, some of which I have mentioned incidentally, make a meagre list. What a splendid effect all the governments could make if they set out to remedy this blot on the artistic reputations of the various nations, and what, a rich source of friendliness between them could be thus achieved ! It is not enough that the museums of the world shall be stocked with international sculpture, for there are millions of common people who never go into museums, but who frequent the streets and squares and public places of the cities. The Republics of South America seem to realise this, and commission foreign works for their open spaces. Even the museums, however, are not so stocked with sculpture : Brighton possesses the Bogey by Egide Rombaux, representing the modern Belgian school, and carved wood figures by Axel Pettersen of Sweden ; London has its Rodin collection at South Kensington, but that is the only really serious item* In the Luxembourg there are but three English and three American pieces of sculpture to the thirty-three pictures in both cases ; and while there are a dozen Belgian and half a dozen Italian examples of sculpture and three from Germany, there are but two Spanish works, in spite of the near frontier and in spite of the fact that Paris is the training school of so many Spanish sculptors, and the home of quite a number. It says much for Spanish mentality in these matters, that already at Barcelona and elsewhere, purchases of English and SCULPTURE OF TO-DAY other foreign sculpture have been made for the museums. The Spanish outlook is a liberal one, and there is no doubt that, speaking generally, the presentation of sculpture on the Continent of Europe is on better lines than are to be found elsewhere. THE GODDESS JOSE CLARA facing p. 16 DIVINITE JOHK CLAR fin. i tig p* 17 CHAPTER II THE SPANISH SCULPTORS SPANISH sculpture did not exist at the be ginning of the nineteenth century, and it was due to the efforts made at Barcelona by Pro fessor Andres Aleu at the Academy of the Fine Arts, there, that the Catalan school arose and seemed likely to dominate the art in Spain. The two chief sculptors of the earlier years were Manuel Orms, and Antonio Fabr6s, who was also a painter, and these men did so well that others emulated them, and then surpassed them. Valencia produced Augustin Querol and Mariano Benlliure, and the modern school of Spanish sculpture was formed. Before the end of the century it was a living force in European art, and during the first two decades of the twentieth, it has challenged all other schools. In Spain, Jos6 Clara is hailed as the successor to Rodin and is regarded as the greatest sculptor that Spain has ever produced. A survey of his works goes a long way to proving both contentions, and when his age is taken into consideration he is only forty-two it seems likely that a comparison with the great French master may be permissible. Clara, however, has absorbed all modern ideas on sculpture, and amalgamated them with those of the grandeur of classical work, and the work of the Renaissance, Phidias and Michelangelo are his teachers, as well as Rodin, and he has learnt 17 c SCULPTURE OF TO-DAY from his contemporaries, or has drunk at the same source of the stream which is vitalising their work. He is, however, teaching his brother artists on the Con tinent much more than he can ever learn from them, On all hands you can see in the work of the younger men at the Salons, and at the International Exhibitions, not only Clara's influence, but direct imitations of his style. His sculpture has been seen in Paris extensively, and it is now exhibited in the principal museums. His bronze figurine Crepuscule has been in the Luxem bourg for some years, and he is represented in the Royal Museum at Madrid by a beautiful head of a girl in marble. Jos6 Clara was born in 1878 at Olot, in Catalonia, and at the age of nineteen went to France to study in the art school at Toulouse, where he first began to model. After three years he went to Paris and made portraits in pastel at first, and then became an assistant in Rodin's studio, to achieve later, discipleshifx Early work of a decorative character was done for the Casino at Monte Carlo, but Clara is not a decorative artist, he is a realist like his master. He exhibited at the Salon, and his statue Torment, acquired for the Museum at Barcelona, was warmly praised by Bourdelte* In 1909 he exhibited the Goddess, the statue in the collection of the Marquess de Bermejillo del Rey* This is a fine nude study of a woman sitting on her left leg, the right foot and the tips of the fingers of the right hand touch ing the base ; her left elbow pressing upon her left knee, and the hand supporting the chin, rests on the left shoulder, slightly tilting the face upwards. It is splendidly modelled, and already shews its sculptor's 18 THE SPANISH SCULPTORS knowledge and command of technique. This year, too, his Enigma was seen at the Salon of the Soci6t6 Nationale des Beaux- Arts, and earned for him the mem bership of that body, his other exhibits being a bronze statuette of a young girl, the head of a woman in bronze and marble, and a marble portrait bust of Mme. Con- chita Alvarez. In 1910 he was awarded medals at the International Exhibitions of Brussels and Madrid ; a gold medal in 1911, and in 1912 the first award for sculpture at the International at Amsterdam, and a medal at Santiago. Clara's work is varied, and perhaps equally divided between the ideal and the real : the putting forth of ideas in the form of statues, statuettes and groups and the making of portrait busts from life. It is almost all in the round ; he has paid very little attention to relief, and only in Serenity has he allowed the practice of Rodin, of leaving a large mass of unsculptured marble as part of the design, to obtrude. In this work the marble is shaped as a seat, and the surface worked upon, and the matrix is not made use of. The work is of colossal size, and was first exhibited in the open space in the Champs Elyses in front of the Grand Palais, where it stood with an architectural background, which was suitable to its design. The occasion was the Autumn Salon of 1919. Serenity is a draped statue : it is a full-length seated figure of full proportions, which the drapery is not too heavy to display. The figure-modelling is therefore visible, and, as is the case in other statues, is very accomplished. The arms are uncovered and thrown over the back of the marble seat with a gesture of complete composure and rest, 19 SCULPTURE OF TO-DAY but the head is less indicative of the subject than the rest of the statue. Other draped, or partially draped, studies shewing Clara's continuing love for the antique, are Pubertad, and Desnudo, both draped from the middle, and El Ritmo, in the Museum of Barcelona, a group of two female figures, the drapery very lightly clinging to the modelled forms beneath, and the work shewing in fluences, both of the Greek and of Rodin's method, in a striking concatenation. Another is the Danzarini, also in the Luxembourg, a quaint bending figure of a young girl, the torso nude, and draperies held above the head and descending in long folds about the legs ; and another, but of quite a different class, is Temira, a mother and child of the peasant class, the woman fully clothed, in sandals, the baby naked. The nude statues include Adolescencia, a charming standing figure, with one slightly bent knee giving a characteristic pose, the hands behind the head ; Rest, a seated girl with her left leg bent and her left arm resting upon it, with the hand to the chin, and Con templation, a strange extended figure of a woman holding back her hair and looking upwards, symbolic and quite modern in treatment, one of the rare reliefs of its author. The remaining nudes are the important recent works, Divinity, a pagan conception : a seated figure of a woman leaning to the side upon her right hand, her left arm, bent on her right knee, and support* ing the head, which is bent downwards, the face wear ing a slight smile, the hair dressed in a modem way and the whole figure realistically modelled, and Twilight, a heavy woman >s figure, seated, the right foot 20 THE SPANISH SCULPTORS withdrawn to the side, the figure leaning back, the hands reflexed and hanging at her sides, the torso thrust forward. This work is in the Santiago museum, Chili* Clara's studies from the nude are more often of women than of men, but in El Trabajo, he has used all his knowledge, and put forth all his skill in model ling, and produced a memorable piece of statuary. The figure is seated, and the back view is a study for the anatomist : the surface reveals all the intricate beauty of bone and muscle and sinew and nerve beneath, and quivers with the life of the subject. The view from the left side is a picture of complete manhood, the slightly turning, firmly poised head, the twisting of the muscles of the torso, the raised and bent right leg and the ex tended arms, again a study in anatomy. I think Clara must have intended this work as a tour de force in the art of modelling, and his intention has succeeded. The remaining works are the busts : an interesting series which divides itself into two, the classic and the modern ; this division by way of treatment only. There are three studies in the Catalan studios at Barcelona in the classic style, Raimundo Lulio, Luis Vives, and Francisco Xim6nez, and other works of the same class are a mask of Hercules, Mancebo in the museum at Barcelona, La Voluntad, all male subjects, and still Greek in character, the female El Alba in the collection of the Viscount de Raucougne, Enigma, and Baco* Most of the portraits in the modern manner are of women and children, and in marble. There is Juventud and Sonia, delightful heads, with laughing faces, Vida Interna and several others not named, and almost equally beautiful There is also the strange Esfinge, 21 SCULPTURE OF TO-DAY and a fine head emerging from a square block of marble in the Circulo Ecucstrc at Barcelona, and the Erato, treated similarly, in the possession of BenonilVLL.de Infante. The whole works of Jose Clara form a very import ant contribution to the art of sculpture, and in them selves are a remarkable achievement for so short a period as twenty years, five of which have been dis turbed by war. He has been decorated by the French Government he has lived nearly the whole of his artistic life in Paris as an Officer in the Legion of Honour. His work is almost always seen in Paris first': at the Salon of the 8oci6t6 Nationale in 1920 he ex hibited a beautiful head of a woman. In Spain he exhibits at the Exposicion Nacional at Madrid, and in 1920, Serenity, in marble, Divinity, in plaster, and El Trabajo, which is part of a projected monument, were seen. His latest work is a great figure for the Park in Madrid, He was represented at the Spanish Exhibition In London in 1921 by Youth, in marble, Green Fruit, In bronze, and La Danseuse, At this exhibition there were forty fine pieces of sculpture in marble and bronze, most of them of small dimensions and these were practically unnoticed by the British Press, so little does sculpture interest the people of the British Isles, or, to put it in another way, so little is their atten tion drawn to it* It is a vain excuse for the art critics to say British sculpture is negligible* as is proved by the fact that sculpture of any nation exhibited in London passes almost unnoticed* Josep Llimona is a man of the 'sixties, who was studying in Rome In 1882, and is one of the foremost 22 THE SPANISH SCULPTORS sculptors of Barcelona. He began to exhibit on his return from Italy, and at the Universal Exhibition of 1888 he was awarded the first medal, and he secured the premier prize at the International of 1907 with the principal details of his Monument to Dr. Robert, the most important of which is a colossal nude male statue. Another important monu mental work is the equestrian statue of Sant Jordi triumphant at the Catalan Library, a patriotic work greatly admired in the province. His Communion two girls taking the sacrament and Love and the Children, a group of a woman and three girls, are real istic works, in which the figures wear ordinary costumes of the day. Two nude studies in marble are a kneeling woman with hands clasped beneath her chin, and a standing figure against a pillar of matrix marble, half- turned to it, but the line of the body helped by a long piece of flowing drapery from the left shoulder and covering the right foot. Llimona has made some fine portrait busts of men and women, in marble and bronze, and he is an admirable draughtsman. His Interment of Christ is at Vilafranca del Penades, and another Christ at Montserrat, and he has also works at Comilles, Madrid, Montevideo, and Buenos Aires, A student of Greek sculpture, of the work of Meunier and of that of Rosso, Enric Casanovas is one of the most interesting of the Catalan sculptors. He was born at Barcelona in 1882, apprenticed at fourteen to Josep Llimona, and at once adopted the creed of realism. Three years later he commenced his studies in Paris, and in 1900 first began to exhibit in Barcelona and the salon of the Champ de Mars. He not only visited the 23 SCULPTURE OF TO-DAY chief art centres of France, but travelled to Brussels and Antwerp to study the Belgian school of sculpture. In 1904 he returned to his native city and exhibited at the International Exhibition there. In 1912 he made a protracted visit to London in order to indulge in a thorough study of the Greek sculpture at the British Museum, and this undoubtedly influenced Casanovas as no other previously had done. He returned to Barcelona the year after, and, equipped by his studies, began to work also upon the Catalan type he found in his own province. His work, therefore, has a wide range, and displays different periods of influence, The earliest distinctly impres sionistic piece is The Street Boy, in terra-cotta, of 1907, but it exhibits impressionism modified by the realism of Constantiri Meunier. This was exhibited at the Soci6t6 Nationale, and in the same year Casan ovas began to shew at the Salon d'Automne, of which later he became an associate. His most realistic works are the Eve, which exhibits a far more reasonable presentment of the subject than is the case with most artists, and later, some of the portrait busts which are admirable, such as those of unnamed boys and girls, and that of Dr. J. B.; other busts there are, conceived, however, in the neo-classical style Eros* Dona de Fornalutx, Dona de Deysl, in stone, and Iris and others in bronze. Of the pieces shewing the influence of Rosso *$ theo ries, but modified very largely by other considerations, is the Love and the Young Woman, a marble relief, made in 1910, and now to be seen in the Municipal Buildings at Barcelona, and the relief in stone, which 24 PORTRAIT ENR1C CASANOVAS facing p. 24 THE SPANISH SCULPTORS is the first work upon which the sculptor commenced his direct carving, called The Dance. In the round, in the same manner and of about the same period, is the fine work, in marble, of The Woman with the Veil. The Girl with the Roses, of 1912, is another example in marble, and in stone there is a female nude. The most thorough-going acceptance of Rosso, however, is to be found in a marble relief of a crouching woman against the rough matrix, depending entirely for its virtue on the manipulation of its light and shade. Casanovas has made a number of monuments, in cluding that to Dr. Benajres, of 1913, and that to Monturiol, the inventor, a marble relief at Figueras, of the year after. To 1915 belongs the beautiful Pomona statue in marble, in the garden of Mr. Barris at Barce lona, and there is another statue, in marble, of 1918, of a Draped Woman, in the house of Mr. Plandiura, of the same city, and still another in stone made for a garden. These are all strongly reminiscent of the author's study of the Greek, as are the busts I have mentioned, but modified so far as the faces are concerned by the Catalan type, this latter being seen in the bronze statu ette of a Woman holding a Water Vessel. Realistic, too, are the two nude female figures of the bronze relief of The Bath, and another nude is the Young Girl in stone, in the Barcelona Museum, where is also a Head of a Woman in bronze. One of his most recent works is a fountain, with three female figures, in the Spring Salon at Barcelona in 1921, Casanovas is a good draughtsman, and some of his studies are reproduced in the brochure upon his work by Josep Pla, published by La Revista, at Barcelona. 25 SCULPTURE OF TO-DAY The Catalan sculptors of the younger generation have been very much impressed by the varied works of the interesting French artist-eniftsman, Aristide Maillol, painter, sculptor, dyer, and none more so than Manolo Hugue, who was born in 1875 in Cuba. His parents were Catalans, and when the boy was quite a child they returned to their native land. His artistic aptitude shewed itself early, both in water-colour painting and in sculpture, and he continued his studies in Paris until he joined the coterie at Ccrct, which was associated with MailloL Consequently, he takes for his subjects herdsmen and their flocks and other people who are rough and crude and work with their hands, making studies largely relief of them* His art is classic, but by no means academic ; it exhibits a relationship with Egyptian and Archaic Greek, and it is entirely devoid of prettiness or elegance. It is to be seen at Munich and Brussels, and a characteristic ex ample of it is the portrait of Joaquin Sunyer, himself a painter as well as sculptor, as is the custom with the followers of MailloL In fact, a coalition of all the arts is aimed at by these men. Thoroughly imbued with the feverish artistic activ ity of the intelligentsia of Catalonia, Josep Monegal is typical of it. He was born only thirty years ago at Barcelona, and at first studied music, literature, and philosophy. Painting succeeded, and it was discovered that he was a draughtsman* He produced large works, but they indicated that colour was not their author's true medium. Sculpture succeeded and the neo-classic style gained MonegaFs adherence. His most important work is a Fountain lately inauguratedat thetown of Vails* 26 THE SPANISH SCULPTORS The essence of the Catalan artistic aim is the spirit of the native people of the country and the impress of the beautiful Mediterranean sea. To completely render this, the most authentic artists of the school have sought to denude themselves of other influences. In Julio Antonio, whose work was seen in London, is an example of one who, however, suffered himself to be affected by what are regarded as alien claims : an eclectic, he selected widely. He was born at the village of Mora d'Ebro in Catalonia, not far from Tarragona, but was undoubtedly influenced by a stay in Castille, where not only the life, but the art and literature, were allowed to modify the Catalonian impress. Zuloaga, El Greco, the sculptors of the sixteenth century, a study of the Greek masters and of the Italian museums, Gothic and baroque, blurred the character of the real istic vision which was his birthright. He is therefore not a thoroughgoing member of the Catalan school, but he is an accomplished sculptor all the same. The Monument to the Martyrs of Tarragona shews the in fluence of El Greco and his busts, Rosa Maria and La Raza Avila de los Caballeros, the Florentine influence. He has produced many busts, anecdotic as well as from the life, the principal of which are the Woman of Castille, the Novice, The Mine, The Goatherd, and the Deaf Innkeeper. His La Raza is in the Madrid Museum, and in this he sums up the character of the Castilians effectively. Grief is another well-known work, with a literary flavour. Jean Pie was born at Vilabelle in the province of Tarragona. He exhibited at the Autumn Salon, Paris, 1920, a figure of Maternity ; a relief Resignation, and 27 SCULPTURE OF TO-DAY two heads of men, all in plaster. Another sculptor from Tarragona is Soriano Montagut, who exhibited in London in 1921. Pau Gargallo is a craftsman in metal and a sculptor of elegance. His work is alive, as may be seen in his portrait studies mostly in lead of the Violinist and the Man of the Pipe, and his queer decorative heads and figures, such as La Toilette and Senorita. In Munich the crafts have evidenced a tendency to become indus trialised, debased, but although Munich is looked upon in Spain as an important art centre, this process has not been imitated, at any rate, by the Catalonian artists, and Gargallo 5 s metal work is always of a high character, and his repouss6 work for the album which the in tellectuals of Barcelona presented to Marshal Joffire, his fine bust of the actor, Iscle Soler, the grave statue of the painter Pidelaserra, and the head called Dona de Casp, indicate this. In none of them is there a trace of the \" snobism \" which has led the artists further East into degeneracy. Gargallo was born in 1881 at Maella, in the province of Saragossa, where he lived until he was seven, when his parents removed to Barcelona* He attended the School of Fine Arts at the Llotja, and gained a scholarship with which he went to Paris in 1904, and he has maintained his connection there by exhibiting from time to time. He also exhibits at Barcelona, where he lives, and is the instructor in sculpture at the Technical School of Fine Arts and the Superior School of Fine Art of the community of Catalunya. Jos6 Cardona and Jos6 Montserrat are Catalan sculp tors who were represented at the Spanish Exhibition 28 THE SPANISH SCULPTORS in London, and the latter 5 s decorative detail for a foun tain was seen at Brighton. Joaquin Sunyer is a sculptor of portrait busts somewhat in the manner of Epstein ; less rough in their treatment than Maillol's studies, forcible and interesting. The Barcelona sculptors include Jose Dunach, who was born there in 1886, and went to Paris at the age of eighteen, and has remained there, exhibiting regularly at the Salons. In the Autumn Salon of 1919 he shewed his Catalan Woman with a Pitcher, at the Societ6 Nationale, in 1920, a Head of a Spaniard, and a Nude, which attracted attention. The Catalan woman is a figure in costume, very simply posed and characteristic ; the Nude is a vivacious naturalistic study from the life, the figure seated, the right leg drawn up and the right elbow resting on the knee. It is completely in the style of the young Spanish School of Sculpture in Paris, whose leader is Jos6 Clara. At the Autumn Salon, 1920, Dimach exhibited a portrait bust in plaster. Other Barcelona sculptors exhibiting at theExposicionNacional at Madrid, in 1920, were Juan Borrell Nicolau, who displayed a head in marble and a work in bronze ; Jos6 Cardona Turro, with two bronze busts, and Jos6 Perez- Pere#, who exhibited in marble a statue of Leda, and in black porphyry, a bust. Antonio Bofill was born in 1874, and attended the School of Fine Arts at Barcelona, where he was a pupil of Aleu, He achieved his first award at the Salon, Paris, in 1902. He exhibited an Arab Boy with Monkeys at Brighton in 1914. Alfonso Lopez is a native of Barce lona, and his birth-year is 1882. He did not commence his real study of sculpture until he was eighteen, carving 29 SCULPTURE OF TODAY by day and attending the Academy at night. He then went to Paris, and became the pupil of Raymond Sudre. He exhibited at the Salon, and the Barcelona Municipality then granted him a scholarship* His first work of importance to be seen in Madrid was a Breton subject, which obtained for him honourable mention and a further scholarship. This work was seen at Brighton in 1914. Henri Casanova-Roy, who is an exhibitor at the Soci<t6 Nationale, was born at Barcelona, but lives in Paris. Gustavo Obiols was born and educated in art at Barcelona, but his activities are mostly confined to Paris, and he is the secretary of the Society of Spanish Artists there. At the Universal Exhibition he was awarded a bronze medal, and a silver one at the Exhibition at le Mans, as well as at Madrid and Amiens Arts Exhibi tions. A plaster bas-relief called Vision, was shewn at Brighton. Ismael Smith was born at Barcelona in 1886, and is a painter in water-colour as well as a sculptor, He gained a medal offered by the municipality in 1904, and two in 1907, at the International Exhibition, and again in 1911. He also exhibited successfully at Brussels in 1911, and is a constant exhibitor at the Salons of the Societe des Artistes Pran^ais, the 8oci6t6 Nationale, and the Autumn Salon* At Brighton were half-a- dozen of his water-colours and the same number of pieces of sculpture, including a bronze Dancer, one with castanets, and one with a Rose, in plaster, and two nudes in terra-cotta and plaster, Miguel and Luciano Osl< are brothers of Barcelona, who work together, and they exhibited at Madrid in 1920, a marble por trait bust. 3 THE SPANISH SCULPTORS In 1918, Miquel Blay completed, at Madrid, his great monument to Josep Pere Varela, for Monte video. The Uruguayans appreciate sculpture, and commission works by foreign artists, as well as pro duce their own sculptors. This monument by Blay is an elaborate work, with many figures realistically treated in modern costume, including that of the sub ject of the memorial in a buttoned-up frock coat. Ad juncts to it, however, receive a different treatment, the marble allegorical figures of Education and Law, with the insignia of these professions, being classically draped, as is also the marble group of Triumph, in cluding a fine woman's figure of Success, preceding a nude male who carries a great flag of Glory. The figures centre around a central obelisk of worked stones and are well grouped and well associated with regard to the admixture of the real and the classical. The Spanish sculptors mostly centre themselves in Barcelona and Madrid, unless they go to Paris and make their homes and studios there, sending their works to Spain when they are able or so inclined. An interesting Madrid artist is Juan Jos6 Garcia, who, in 1920, held an Exhibition of ninety of his works in metal, portraits in bronze, medals, plaques, ornamental metal work, repouss6 dishes and caskets : two prin cipal works were a striking bronze relief of Christ, and a bronze statuette of Liberty. Juan Jos6 is quite young, having been born only in 1893. Gregorio Domingo was also born in Madrid, and became a pupil of Benlliure. He exhibited a bronze head of a man, which was well modelled, at Brighton in 1914. The Madrid sculptors are numerous, and among 3* SCULPTURE OF TO-DAY those exhibiting in 1920 were Mariano Barroso Salz, with two works ; Jos6 Espinos Gisbert, the medallist ; Roberto Fernandez Balbucna ; Alfredo de Pablos ; Angel Garcia Diaz, two works in marble ; Oscar Massa, a portrait ; Jose Martinez Solaz ; Carlos Mingo, a nude in stone ; Miguel Ramos Santamaria, a statue in plaster ; Rafael Vela del Castello, a male torso in plas ter, and a bronze bust of Ignacio Veloso. At the Spanish Exhibition in Ixmdon, to which I have referred, Ricardo Colet, Ignacio Veloso and Luis Perinat, and Elena Sorolla y Garcia and Eva Vazquez Diaz contributed, the latter artist having exhibited at Brighton. Angel Ferrant Vasquez is a Madrid artist who gained his first medal at the Exposition Nacional in 1910, and exhibited at Brighton bronzes called The Hill of Life and The Man with the Monkey. He works in the style of Constantin Meunier. Luis de Perinat y 'Ferry was a pupil of Benlliure, and he has exhibited at Madrid, Saragossa, Brussels, and Buenos Aire$> where he has received awards. At the Madrid Exposition National, in 1920, he shewed a bronze figurine, Angel de la Paloma, and at the Salon de$ Artistes Franyais the same year he was represented by Aurora, in marble and bronze, and at Brighton he exhibited a bronze statuette, Carmen. Like his great colleague, Benlliure, Mateo Inurria lives and works in Madrid, and is associated with the school of that city, a school which vies with the Catalan school in its efforts to produce distinctive modern sculpture, Inurria, the son of a sculptor, was born in 1867. He is a native of Cordova, and was a student of NUDE JOSE DUNACH facing p. 32 FORMA MATED INIWRIA THE SPANISH SCULPTORS the school of art there, and studied painting as well as sculpture in Madrid. He gained a medal in 1895 for a statue of Seneca, and in 1899 obtained the first medal for sculpture in the Exposition Nacional, for his high relief, The Coal Mine. The former work is now in the museum of the sculptor's native town, together with others of importance, and at Cordova, too, are the im portant monuments to Antonio Barrow, a stately seated figure in civic robes and chain, and El Gran Capitan, Gonzalo de Cordoba, in armour and riding a horse, forming a striking group. The Coal Mine is in the Museo Nacional, and in the Museum of Modern Art, also at Madrid, is the beautiful female torso known as Forma. This work, in 'rose marble, is a portion of La Parra, a figure of a standing woman with arms extended and bent over her head, the right hand holding a bunch of grapes, in black marble. These, and other examples, prove Inurria to be a fine master in the art of delicate and graceful modelling. Forma was seen in London in 1921. At the 1920 Exposicion Nacional, he exhibited both these works, and in addition The Eternal Idol, also in black marble, and for this he was awarded the coveted Medal of Honour. He has chosen to represent his idea as a seated nude woman without head or arms, the torso extended by the legs and feet. The work is a triumph of technique, and in this aspect must be judged, for there can be no real symbolism in its trun cated form. The form, however, is very beautiful, and even more so than La Parra, the best part of which is, no doubt, the torso. It is interesting that this should be so, for Inurria's capabilities for the drawing of heads and the realising of character are never in doubt, as is 33 D SCULPTURE OF TO-DAY proved by his portrait-busts, and by the extraordinary bust called Gitana, in coloured, veined marble, with hair treated in a whimsical, decorative fashion. Here is character thoroughly accentuated in the beaked nose and the prominent eyes and mouth. In La Parra, however, there is great expression in the whole of the tall figure, an expression of pose, accentuated by the facial projection, the mask raised, the eyes closed. This, too, may be said of Deseo, another nude woman, standing upright, but in a slightly re laxed pose, the arms held behind the head, instead of above, the face turned a little to the side, and again the eyes are closed* The complete expression is that of wistful languor, and it is exquisitely rendered in white marble, with some slight veining. La Marina is the fine monument to Alfonso XII in Madrid, It is Inurria's most realistic work, and contains two large figures, the one of a young sailor, holding the topmast of a ship, to which is attached a decorated flag, and the other, stand ing by his side, an old fisherman with tiller and ropes companions of the sea, It is a striking memorial Inurria's latest work is the Monumental Tomb of Christ the Redeemer for Buenos Aires* A further group of sculptors is associated with Valencia, and this possesses the distinction of claiming as its own Spain's well-known sculptor, Mariano Benlliure y Gil, who was born there in 1863* When seventeen years of age he went to Rome : his studies were self-studies : he never acknowledged masters, except the great sculptors of the past. He was for a time the Director of the Spanish Academy at Rome, and he is a member of the Academies of Madrid 34 THE SPANISH SCULPTORS and Paris. His small group in bronze. Primer tumbo, is in the Luxembourg, and his monument, Gayarre, was a feature of the 1889 Paris Universal Exhibition. In 1901, at the Venice International, he was repre sented by bronze works, Idyll, Music, and Unawakened, and in 1914 by bronzes, the First Victory, the Victim, and a portrait head. His works at the Spanish Ex hibition at Brighton in the same year, were a Child's Head in marble, and the bronze bull-fighting group called there the First Thrust. One of his earliest statues, of a child, is in the Fernan- Nunez collection at Madrid, and some early reliefs are in the mansion of Mr. Marquend, at Washington. He has made a large number of monuments and memorials, the earlier ones being of the painter Ribera ; Cardinal de Ribera at Valencia in the college de Ribera there ; the poet Trueba at Bilbao ; and General San Martin at Prou. His funeral monuments include the Sagasta tomb in the Basilica de Atocha, Madrid, where there Is also the Canalejas tomb ; the Duchesse de Denia y Tarifa in the Madrid cemetery, San Isidro ; and that of Dr. Lacaze of the Laboratory of Banyuls-sur-Mer. His Velasquez monument is at Buenos Aires, where there is also his Gitana, a bust, in the Spanish Club. Other busts of recent date are of Queen Victoria Eugenia, in the Royal Palace, Madrid ; of Francisco Goya y Lucienties ; of the painter Sorolla in the Hudigton collection, New York; of Dr. Santiago Ramon y Cajal, and of the Duke of Alba in the Alba Palace at Madrid, his latest portrait made in 191 9. The statue of the Princess Maria Cristina in the Royal Palace is dated 1914, The Shipwreck is in the museum 35 SCULPTURE OF TO-DAY at Cordova- At the Spanish Exhibition in London he was also represented by the Vine and the Eternal Idol, and by a Spanish Woman in marble. He is now the Director of the National Art Schools of Spain. To the school of Valencia belongs also Ignaclo Pinazo- Martinez, the brother of the painter, Jos6 Pinazo. He tries to express the real flavour of the province of which he is a native, a flavour homely and decorative, contrasting with the more austere Castilian character istics. From the Academy of Arts at Valencia he was awarded the Travelling Scholarship, and held it in Rome and Paris, and in 1915 he was awarded a silver medal at the National Exhibition in Madrid, to be followed by a similar award at the International at Saragossa. He was made a member of the Legion of Honour by France, and in 1921 he was in London as the Secretary of the Spanish Exhibition, where he ex hibited his Roseta, a bust in marble from the Madrid Exhibition of the previous year, and another marble bust was Pagania, claiming attention by the peculiarity of the dressing of the hair. From Madrid was also the marble group, Valencia, seen also in London, this work displaying his style in all its peculiarities of floral decoration, with vase and other accessories, little seen nowadays, and little used by his brother sculptors* The work is intended to enunciate the sunny character of Valencia, and consists of a figure in the nude of a woman leaning gracefully back against a partly-draped male figure, both of goodly proportions and graceful. In the Salon of 1920 he was represented by two silvered bronze busts of girls* Capuz was born in Valencia in 1885, and was a 36 THE SPANISH SCULPTORS student at the School of Fine Arts there, and passed on by means of a scholarship to the Spanish Academy at Rome. He gained a medal in the Exposition Nacional in 1910, and the first medal in 1912. He belongs to the school of applied sculpture, and exhibited at Brighton a polychrome terra-cotta work, and two studies in wood. Jos6 T6rencio Ferrer was born in Valencia, in 1887, where he first studied art, going on then to Barcelona, and subsequently to Paris. He exhibited at Brighton a marble work named Timidity, a delightful sitting nude girl, her face partly hidden by her left arm. Other sculptors of Valencia are Julio Vicente Men- gual, who, like Pinazo, was successful in obtaining a medal in the Annual Exposicion at Madrid in 1915, exhibited in 1920 a. seated nude female statue called Amanecer ; and Vincente Navarro, who exhibited in London in 1921 a marble bust of the Queen of Spain and a marble female torso. At this exhibition works were shewn by Joaquin Bilbao Martinez and Enrique Perez Comendador of Seville, Juan Cristobel of Granada, Quintin de Torre of Bilbao, and Pedro y Torre Isunza of Badajoz. Mateo Hern&ndez, who was born in 1889, at B6jar, is one of the modern school of sculptors who carve direct. His first important work was a Christ, life-size, carved in granite, in 1909. In the following year he produced the same subject in wood, and the year after, a Virign in wood, with polychrome decoration. Hern- Andez is also a painter, and, at the Autumn Salon, 1920, exhibited a painted portrait and two animal studies. At the Artistes Ind6pendants he exhibited two bas-reliefs 37 SCULPTURE OF TO-DAY of Lions in stone, and a statue, now the property of the Marquis de Casa Fuerte, and three painted portraits. A stone relief was seen at the Arts Decoratifs and at the Societ Nationale (of which he is an associe) a Vulture in black granite, a lioness in stone, and another painted portrait. At the Autumn Salon (of which he is a soci^taire) his sculpture included por traits in black and green granite, and a panther, a vulture, and a condor, all in black granite* Jose Ortells is a native of Villa Real, and gained medals at the Exposicion Nacional in 1910, 1915 and 1917. He exhibited at Madrid in 1920, a bronze statue half draped, La Manzana, in the classical style, another bronze, and a portrait in marble. At this exhibition was shewn a nude statue by Fer nando Campo Sobrino, and a curious semi-nude with strange drawn draperies from left leg to shoulder was by Federico Mar&, who also exhibited a relief of Christ. A seated nude was by Carlos Mingo, A male nude was Juan Santamarina's Ugolino, a contorted but not very convincing study, and another was Juan Adsuara's John the Baptist, an original conception* Ignacio Lopez- Gomez, a native of Desa, exhibited two Heads, and Jeronimo Lopez-Salazar, of Ciudad Real, a bust, Jaime Otero exhibited half-a-dozen works at Brighton, including three plaster portrait busts ; a plaster statu* ette, Berenice ; a marble head, Virgo Venerando ; and the Infant Virgin, a plaster statuette. The portrait busts are characteristic studies from the life, and the one of Angela Beloff offers some accomplished natural istic modelling. Alma Dolores is only less good : these 38 THE SPANISH SCULPTORS busts are finished at the neck in a decorative way by delicate lace work. A curious group of two figures in bronze kneeling side by side in a mutual embrace (and shewing an original idea) was by Inocencio Soriano, who also exhibited a bust in bronze of good character, and among other makers of busts of quality were Alfredo de Robledo, Jos6 Cardona, and Francesco Mora Alonso. Ernesto do Canto is a Portuguese sculptor born at Poula, Delgada, who exhibited at the Autumn Salon 1920, reliefs of Portuguese types in plaster, with a patina, and a terra-cotta Virgin and Infant. 39 CHAPTER III THE FRENCH SCHOOL FRENCH sculpture of the later part of the nine teenth century is one half tradition and the other half Rodin, who, having been born in 1840, succeeded in giving it a new complexion, a new outlook and new principles, which almost dominated, but certainly affected, its whole body. French sculpture as indeed any sculpture of the period' would be a very different thing to-day if Rodin had never been* Allowing, however, for his great spirit, his luminous gaze on things and into the future ; allowing for his forceful personality and the multiplicity of his works ; allowing also for the value of the striking series of ex periments he made in the art, it must be remembered that behind him and beside him was the whole force of tradition which made the French school of sculpture what it then was, Rodin was certainly not in the tra dition ; his value does not lie there at all, but as an innovator, in the French school or in any other, he has never had an equal. He was a giant, but in the circumstances the fortunate circumstances he was not a giant among pigmies. Far from it : he was a giant among giants. Guillaume, Cain, Rude, Seurre were the masters when he was born and for long after ; Barye, Barrias, Paul Dubois, Carpeaux, Fr6miet, In- jalbert, Marqueste, Falgui&re, Dalou and Boucher were his contemporaries, and he had also to contend 40 THE FRENCH SCHOOL with Puech, Dampt, Despiau, Chapu, and Bartholome. A formidable array of the pontiffs of French sculpture against the iconoclast, who was, however, to secure the adhesion of some of the modern men, and to in fluence modern work more powerfully than any other artist had done. The only really comparable example in this respect was Constantin Meunier, for Medardo Rosso 's influence was less direct, and merged to a great extent with that of Rodin. The strength of the forces against Rodin's influence was great. It is hard enough to fight tradition at all, but when it is in the full flow of success ; when its new officers are not only as good, but better than the old, when the ancient entrench ments have been brought up to the requirements of the hour, the fight must needs be a severe one. In this case it was a drawn battle and we have the curious anomaly, almost to be called a paradox, of the old and the new, the orthodox and the anarchistic, existing in strength together, and, indeed, fortifying each other. For it cannot be said that the traditional French school has suffered from the attack : it has benefited by adopting and adapting the methods of the enemy, and not all the sapping and mining, insidious as it has been, has seriously debilitated the defences of the old army. The gardens, streets, squares, and cemeteries of Paris are full of sculpture, and ever becoming fuller. The provincial cities of France are yearly adding to their sculptural riches, but the honours are divided. There is the Balzac of Falguiere in the Avenue Fried- land, and that by Rodin in the garden of the Hotel Biron ; there is his Victor Hugo in the Palais Royal Gardens, and Alfred de Musset, by Merci6, in the 41 SCULPTURE OF TO-DAY Place du Theatre Francis. There is Dalou's Delacroix monument in the Luxembourg Gardens, and Land- owski's Edward VII in the Place EdouardVII ; Augier, by Barrias, at the Od&>n ; and Gavarni, by Denys Puech, in the Place St. Georges, It is a catholic selection waiting only to be made more so by the inclusion of works by Bourdelle, Maillol and Bernard. To the Paris statues, the fountains must be added, and the reliefs on the public buildings, and then you have a museum of modern sculpture, which cannot be equalled in the world, Paris is, of course, the history- book of the French school, and the museums form the commentary. In the Luxembourg you must study Falguiere's Vainqueur au combat de Coqs ; you must not miss his Juno, the Woman with the Peacock, a gallant piece, Heroic Poesie and Diana, or his statue of Charcot, the physician at the Hospice de la Sal- petriere. Injalbert's Hippom&ne is also at the Luxem bourg, and his La Coupe de Dieux, and Faune and Faunesse ; so also is Marqueste's Cupid* Galatea, Perseus and the Gorgon, and Woman and Eagle, and his Art is at the H6tel de Ville, and his statue of Barye at the Pont Sully ; Carpeaux and Fr&niet's splendid Fountain, with the globe held up by three beautiful female figures, and the great horses, is in the Luxem bourg Gardens. There is Chapu's tomb of Gustave Flaubert to be seen, his statue of Le Verrier at the Observatory ; Guillaume's Bernard the Physiologist, at the College de France ; Jeanne d'Are, by Paul Dubois, in the Place St. Augustin ; Mercies Melssonler at the Louvre ; and Seurre's Moli^re in the rue de Richelieu, Concentrating the essence of the best French 42 THE FRENCH SCHOOL sculpture of the period, the sculpture that is of the true traditional French school only modified by the ex igencies of time, and represented by a great master, is Dalou's Triumph of the Republic in the Place de la Nation, a monument into which is also concentrated the work of Dalou's own life. Here is true characteristic French decorative sculpture allied with architecture, a monument by the great modern and to the great masters who preceded him, for it is a summary of the distinctions of developed traditional French sculpture. The monument to the other kind, the iconoclastic, revolutionary sculpture, is practically contemporary with the Triumph of the Republic : it is the Hotel Biron in the rue de Varenne, Paris : the Mus6e Rodin. There, in a garden with high walls and big entrance gates with a lodge, partly in a chapel, partly in the historic hotel, is the great collection of works which Rodin left to the French nation. Most of them were removed from Meudon, where Rodin lived and worked, some have been transferred from the Luxembourg Museum so as to make the collection complete. There, in the two buildings and in the gardens, are specimens of the master's works ; drawings, paintings, sketches, designs, on paper ; sketches, designs abandoned, half finished and finished in clay, plaster, terra-cotta, marble and bronze. Figurines, statuettes, masks, busts/reliefs, statues, groups five hundred examples of Rodin's art and activity, every one of them characterised by wonder and research, often very beautiful, sometimes tragic in failure. From the figurines in their glass cases to the huge Hell's Gate and the Ugolino, is a long journey, but it includes some of the most astonishing 43 SCULPTURE OF TO-DAY things that the art of sculpture has vouchsafed to the world. Many of these are known almost universally now, for they have been disseminated by copy after copy in bronze, and it is said, even in marble. In bronze St. John the Baptist stalks the world ; the Penseur broods upon it ; the man of the Age d'Airain wonders about it : these are living things and part of the world's equipment, like Hamlet and Faust, King Alfred and Columbus, but no artist can be judged by his master pieces alone. We have to appraise him by the whole of his works, and so, in judging Rodin, there is the Femme Accroupie to be considered by the side of the Kiss ; the Ugolino with the Burghers of Calais ; the Man with the Broken Nose with L 'Emprise. Rodin was an old man when he died in 1917, and he had impressed himself upon his time as few other of his contemporaries were able to do* Not only in France, but in England and other countries, his genius was recognised during a period, before his death, of nearly half a century. His work was seen in Vienna as early as 1873, in London in 1874, and the same year in Brussels, where he lived then, and where you could have bought a terra-cotta from his hand for a five pound note. At Christie's sale in London, in 1920, fourteen of his bronzes, all quite small, were sold for ,2,520. A Reclining Woman from the Natorp collec-* tion, fetched ^567, and the statuette of Eve, from the Paulin collection, 651, both small signed works. In 1888, Glasgow purchased a head of Victor Hugo in plaster ; in 1908, at the Franco-British Exhibition in London, were two of his busts. He became President of the International Society of Sculptors, Painters and 44 THE FRENCH SCHOOL Gravers ; he came to London on more than one occa sion, and was hailed as The Master, his friends, Lanteri and Legros being his sponsors. Men of power in the world sought him out, and of these he made many busts : Puvis de Chavannes, Dalou, Cesar Franck, Bernard Shaw, Falguiere, George Wyndham and Clemenceau, and he made busts of Balzac, Victor Hugo, Mozart, and other great men of the past. He illus trated and gave new and wider meanings to passages from the poets ; he made the personages of mythology live, and he gave new allegories to the world. In doing all this he widened the portals of the palace of beauty. In no country, except his own, was his peculiar power more recognised and appreciated than in England, and knowing this, he bequeathed to the Victoria and Albert Museum twenty pieces of bronze and marble illustrating the different phases of his long artistic career, and its development and decadence : the Age d'Airain, St. John, the Prodigal Son, Cybele, busts and torsos, a small collection compared with that of the Hotel Biron, but a great one in itself. These, then, were the two influences at work in form- Ing the characteristics of the Modern French School of Sculpture : that of tradition and the pontiffs, and that of Rodin the prophet. How soundly the work of the pontiffs was founded is well seen in the case of the great French master Bartholom6. No great artist of modern times has achieved more fine monuments than Albert Bartholom6, some of them are to Meilhac, Benoit Mahon in the Paris ceme tery, Sardou, and that to Rousseau for the Panth6on in 1912. His works for the State and the City of Paris 45 SCULPTURE OF TO-DAY are numerous, and many are to be seen in the Paris museums. In the Luxembourg is the bronze of a Little Girl Weeping, and a half-length portrait in marble of the sculptor's wife. His Young Girl doing her hair, the Little Girl Weeping, his Niobe and Christ in stone, were seen at the Franco-British Exhibition in London in 1908. Bartholom^ was born at Thiverval, and was destined for the law, but when twenty-four years old he relinquished his legal duties and began his study of drawing and painting. He was forty years old before he commenced to work as a sculptor, resembling in this respect his contemporary, Meunier. He is the President of the Soci6t< National des Beaux- Arts, and was to have exhibited there in 1920, but was prevented by illness. He is a Commander of the Legion of Honour, and a member of the Royal Academies of Scotland, Belgium, and Spain. He has worked laboriously through out his long life at great designs, and has not produced much miscellaneous work. Some of his smaller works in marble are a bust, Germaine, a high relief of a Girl at her Toilet, Regrets; and Femmes Coiflant, a Christ on the Cross, Au bord de Feau, and Baigneuse, in bronze, His beautiful marble relief L'Adieu, is in the Royal Museum at Brussels, Some of Bartholomews tombs are for the families of Dubufe and Pam, and for the young son of M. Lau~ mont, killed on the field of honour. These tombs are in the highest class of funeral monuments, and unite fitting architectural settings with sculpture, while avoiding the mistake of inadequately relieved mass made frequently by artists in Italy and Germany, and now being imitated in England and on the American THE FRENCH SCHOOL continent. Several examples of Bartholomews smaller works have been seen at the exhibitions in London of the International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers, of which he is an honorary member, Bartholomews Monument to the Dead in the cemetery of Pere Lachaise is recognised as one of the finest pieces of mortuary work in the world. The great tomb with its twenty magnificently modelled figures, and not one of them winged, is a dominating work, and since its completion in 1899, its influence has been great and salutary. Being absolutely normal, without extravagances of any description, and yet obviously inspired, as well as being fine from the technical point of view, its effect has been the more marked. It is dis tinctly a link between the old school and the new, but, apart from its historic value, and judged merely on its merits, it is one of the most emotional pieces of sculp ture we have, and inspires us with mixed feelings con cerning death, certainly, but with a predominating idea of its immense and wonderful character. The variety of human emotion with which the artist has invested his figures is surprising and impressive, but the dignity of the two dual central groups stays all emotion save that of final acquiescence in the great gift of eternal peace. Bartholomews latest works are the monument to the senator-aviator Reymond, who was killed at Mont- brison, and the symbolic statue Paris : 1914-1918, the monument to the dramatists and composers killed in the war. In 1921 Bartholom6 was elected Honorary Foreign Academician of the Royal Academy, London. Born in 1848, only eight years after Rodin, Alphonse 47 SCULPTURE OF TO-DAY Cordonmer and Paul Albert Bartholome are the two veterans of the French school of modern sculp ture, and to many minds they more truly represent the real spirit of French work than does Rodin. They carry on the fine traditions with but slight modifications. Cordonnier is a native of Lille, and was a pupil of Dumont at the Ecolc des Beaux-Arts, Paris, and gained the Prix de Rome in 1877. His most important works are Joan of Arc at the Stake, the marble group Spring, the marble group La Piti<5, or Sur le pav<, at the entrance to the Luxembourg museum, His Paris monu ments include the allegorical marble figure of Sculpture on the Grand Palais des Expositions, a bronze statue at the Hdtel de Ville, and an allegory in stone of History at the Sorbonne. At his native town there is the Monu ment of National Defence, 1870, and the Pasteur monument. At Roubaix, on the School of Art and Science, and on the Bourse there, are some of his carved bas-reliefs. At the Salon, his groups in bronze of the Funeral March, and the Eternal Victim were exhibited, and acquired by the State, and at the Salon of 1920 were two works, including the Return of the Poilu to his devastated Home. His Christ, in plaster, was exhibited at the Franco -British Exhibition of 1908, Cordonnier is an officer of the Legion of Honour. Pierre Roche is also one of the older sculptors, being born in 1855, He worked in the studios of Roll and Dalou. L'Effort was bought for the Luxembourg Gardens in 1900 by the State, and is a fine piece of out-door sculpture, the single male figure supporting, or raising, a mass of naturalistic rock, is now partly overgrown with ivy, and its real quality hidden. Avril THE FRENCH SCHOOL is a monumental fountain purchased by the City of Paris, in the Square du Musee Galliera. An important work is the Fouquier tomb in the cemetery at Passy, and some architectural sculpture of his is on the door way of the church of Saint Jean at Montmartre. He has made busts of Saint Just, Huysmans, Dalou, Henry le Sidaner, and others, and a large number of medals, plaquettes, tokens and gypsographs of which a good many are due to the war, they being dated mostly from 1914 onwards. In 1908, at the Franco-British Exhi bition, his granite bust, Bretonne de Goelo, and his marble statuette, Aphrodite d'Or, were exhibited. The direct successor to Rodin, in his sculpture, in his life, and in his splendid hospitality, is Antoine Bourdelle. In and out the two studios of \" La .grande Chaumiere,\" in the quaint courtyard, shut off by gates from the quainter Impasse du Maine, on Sundays, and sometimes on other days, there is a constant stream of people. Many of them are distinguished already, some of them in the course of becoming distinguished, and some of them seeking Bourdelle 's aid to a future career of distinction. They come from America and Great Britain, from Sweden and Russia, from Belgium and Switzerland, collectors of works of art, and officials from the great capitals of the world. Artists are there from Spain and Germany, and young and aspiring painters and sculptors from Roumania, Czechoslovakia, Jugoslavia, and Poland. Many tongues are spoken, and most are understood, and the great artist, The Master, Bourdelle, is there to listen, to sympathise, to advise, to charm. There, too, are some of the master's works, done and half done : great works. 49 E SCULPTURE OF TO-DAY The cosmopolitanism of Bourdelle's receptions is only a reflection of the distribution of his work. Strangely enough, France has not been foremost in its appreci ation : France who does not believe that a prophet is not a prophet in his own country. France honours her great artists as does Belgium and Sweden and some other of the nations, by purchasing their masterpieces as soon as they are made, or by commissioning others. Countries there are England is one of them where this generosity does not exist. There is the fund in England called The Chantrey Bequest, which is admin istered by the Royal Academy ; there are voluntary bodies known as the National Art-Collections Fund, and the Contemporary Art Society, whose function is the acquisition of works of art for the national collec tions, but there is practically no State-purchase for contemporary art. Acquired by the State, acquired by the City, are legends which Belgian and French artists are proud to have attached to their works. There is no such justice in Great Britain, and because there is no State patronage there is not the incentive to put forth big work by the sculptor, for he knows there is only the possibility of it being purchased for a gallery in the Provinces, and that but a remote one. It is useless to complain that there is no great national school of sculpture in Great Britain, Artists live on commissions and purchases, as do architects and manufacturers, and they should not be able to, or be allowed to, Hve otherwise* I do not for a moment doubt that if there existed a system of acquisition by the State to-morrow, in ten years there would be such exhibitions of sculpture at the Royal Academy, the THE FRENCH SCHOOL International and the Royal Society of British Sculp tors as would not only astonish the gapers, but silence the cavillers, too. In the economy of the great nations huge sums are spent every year in education of all sorts. No incon siderable part of this is spent on art education : scholar ships and medals abound for students while they are students, and France and Belgium sees that this money is not wasted. They are both frugal nations, and they do not intend that the results of this money spent on students shall be lost to the country which provided it. The contrary is the case in Great Britain. The State, the constituent parts of it, the counties and the cities, provide scholarships in plenty, and it is possible for a student of sculpture, as of other arts and sciences, to obtain a complete training at the nation 's expense. That training over, the nation takes no further notice of the man or woman it has fostered* If they have been reared in painting, they become fashion-plate artists, and their foster-father, the nation, is quite uncon cerned. If they have been reared as sculptors, they become stonemasons or plasterers, and the nation, their foster-father, does not care. England rears a great family of artists and leaves them to starve ; she casts them off as encumbrances and nuisances, and has no use for them when they are able to produce such work as the nation would be proud of, and such work as would repay to the nation the huge initial outlay. There are exceptions, of course, and a case in point is Ernest Cole, a scholarship-holder of the London County Council, whose talent has been so far recog nised that he was engaged to do all the sculpture on SCULPTURE OF TO-DAY the large new Council buildings on the banks of the Thames, to which I have referred. France has not erred overmuch in this way, but, curiously enough, she has rather missed one of her greatest artists, Bourdelle, when distributing her favours much to France's loss. He has been over looked somewhat by the official world, but he is a societaire of the Nationale des Beaux-Arts, and not of the Artistes Fran<jais. Bourdelle J s work is well known in England, if not widely known, and from the year 1906, when as a member of the International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers, he exhibited his remarkable Beethoven, and a Female Torso, it has had an effect upon certain British sculptors, as it has on the younger sculptors of the Continent so distinctly. The following year his Aphrodite, Volont6, La R6ve and Jeanne d'Arc were seen at the same society's show* in 1910, La Guerre, and other bronzes ; and in 191 1 , In Memoriam, in marble, Artemis, in bronze, and L'Hymne Int6r~ ieure, in plaster, and in 1912, Le Jeu du Voile, EmileAntoine Bourdelle was born in i86i,at Mont- auban, Tarn et Garonne, the country of Ingres, and of Ingres he has done a magnificent bust in bronze. He studied at Montauban, under Larroque at Toul ouse, and Falguiere on arriving in Paris, but learning more from frequenting the studios of Dalou and Rodin, learning not only the art of sculpture but the art of life also. Bourdelle is various : he has made furniture, wood-carvings, carvings in stone and marble, archi tectural, ideal, and real studies from life ; paintings and pastels, drawings in water-colour and black and THE FRENCH SCHOOL white ; frescoes on the Th6atre des Champs-Elysees, and he is professor and designer at the State manufactory of the Gobelins tapestries. Added to all these activities, he has written a number of articles on art, and is in charge of the sculpture department of the new Revue de France, Besides the frescoes on the Champs-Elysees theatre, of which there are ten in the atrium, and other colour works in the passages to the boxes, there are twenty- one marble figures on the fagade, so that this is the most important piece of Bourdelle's work in Paris. It was accomplished during the years 1912 and 1913. In the Luxembourg are his bronze busts of Hercules and Beethoven, and in the museum at Rome, commanded by the Italian Government, is his Herakles, in bronze, of 1910, a nude archer drawing a rude bow, kneeling on the right knee, the left leg extended almost to full length, and the left foot pressed 'tensely against a ver tical piece of rock, the right arm drawn back and doubled in the strenuous extension of the bow-string. The face is full of intensity and resolve, but is not otherwise beautiful. This work was seen at the International Exhibition of Venice in 1914, in a large plaster model, and in the reduced bronze* At this exhibition thirty-two pieces of Bourdelle's sculpture were shewn, and a collection of his water- colours* He was the subject of a special individual show in the French pavilion, an honour he shared that year with Medardo Rosso in the Italian section, and Ivan Mestrovic in the Serbian. There were four bas-reliefs the Dance, Tragedy, Comedy, and Architecture and Sculpture, as well as busts of Carpeaux and Rodin in plaster, two marble busts and eighteen works in bronze. 53 SCULPTURE OF TO-DAY In the museum at Florence is one of Bourdelle's busts ; Prince Eugen of Sweden has a replica of H&rakles ; a large bronze, The Dying Centaur, is at Buenos Aires ; a bronze statue of a young girl is in the museum at Bucharest, and there are several examples of his work in the museums of Germany. His Laughter and Roses is a well-known work, and of heads of children, women and men he has made a number. His relief of Pegasus and the Muse is a symbolic work, in which his natural method has compromised with a Greek subject and produced an interesting result, and a com panion relief is Pallas. Bourdelle is responsible for several important pieces of monumental work. The Argentine Government commissioned the General Alvear Memorial, twenty metres in height, of which two figures were seen at the Salon of 1920 : Force and Victory. The base, fourteen metres high, is of polished granite, and on this is the equestrian statue, an impressive figure on a heavy horse, and at the four corners of the pedestal are four allegorical figures, the other two, in addition to those just mentioned, being Eloquence and Liberty* Another national monument is that to the resurrection of the Polish nation, a detail of which, the colossal head of Adam Mickiewiez, that great patriot and poet, was seen at the same Salon, This is supported on a tall column emblematic of the spirit of the combatants in the great epic of Poland* At the base of the column are six vigorous bas-reliefs of scenes taken from the poet's works, and others emblematic of the three united provinces of Poland* A third monument is that to the Miners killed in the War. It is in three stages, all in 54 THE FRENCH SCHOOL stone. Below, on the four faces, are attributes of mining and fighting ; above are four high reliefs representing the miners at work in the pit and in the war, and a miner's lamp surmounts the whole, which is eleven metres in height. This monument is for Montceau les Mines. Bourdelle's principle is that his architecture is for his sculpture and his sculpture for his architecture : the whole created and united by himself alone. In any system of education for the sculptor the science of architectonics is a most important part. In the Royal College of Art in London, architectural courses are compulsory, but are taken more from the aesthetic side than from the architectonic. It might be well if sculp tors, especially those who propose to engage in large monumental work, paid even more attention to this part of their work than they do. The sculptors who have been most successful in this direction have done so, and many monuments of those who have not, have suffered from this cause, for there is a distinct tendency on the part of architects to usurp this function. A sculptor is as much a designer as is an architect, with this difference, that a sculptor may design a whole with his combination of sculpture and architecture, while an architect only designs a part. Where there is an equal, or even an unequal, amount of work in either art, there should be collaboration. In a preponderat- ingly architectural design the architect should consult with the sculptor, instead of going to him after his design has been made. A hundred errors would then be avoided, errors that have ruined fine sculpture by reason of its situation, by reason of its character, and 55 SCULPTURE OF TO-DAY even period. Sculpture has suffered, and therefore sculptors have suffered, and that is why Bourdelle and Bouchard in France, Derwent Wood and John Tweed in England, Walter Allward in Canada, MacMonnies, French, and Stirling Calder in the United States of America, have claimed the right of the designer to the first place in any considerations regarding sculpture as applied in architecture. It should not be forgotten that the designing of monuments is one of the chief functions of the sculptor. In 1900, Bourdelle '$ monument to the Defenders of 1870 was erected at Montauban. It is eight metres in height, with figures in bronze on the pedestal, also made by the sculptor, of granite. To every public work that Bourdelle has accomplished, he has made at least a hundred pieces for private use in marble, stone, bronze, terra-cotta, and wood. His Head of Apollo, his busts of Rodin, Carpeaux, Ingres, Simu, Anatole France, Kueberl6, the great surgeon at Strasbourg, Le Chatelier at the College de France, Coquelin ain, Coquelin cadet, his War and Victory are well known, and altogether he has made about three hundred por traits in sculpture > pastel or paint. His astounding statue of the year 1914, of Rodin at work on the Porte de PEnfer, and the Dying Centaur are two of the sculp tor *s most characteristic works. Dynamic, yet spiritual, their appeal is immediate and cumulative. The Rodin represents a huddled, forceful figure struggling with a superhuman problem, and there seems to me to be a strange and mystic association between it and the Dying Centaur, The Gate of Hell was too great a task for any mortal to apprise, and even 56 THE FRENCH SCHOOL Rodin failed. The Centaur, in the modern world, is an anachronism too profound for us to resolve. Bour- delle, in his conception, has linked the two disturbing ideas, and their development and culmination are seen in the weird, clumsy death of a creature which has been dying for more than a thousand years. Le Cent- aure Mourant is a tragical realisation of the finite in man and in art. Bourdelle's love of Gothic is seen in his bronze of the Virgin and Child, while his Young Faun, also in bronze, is a jolly pagan group of much interest. Greatly appre ciated by the Czechoslovaks, he has made for them their Croix de Guerre, a handsomely designed decor ation representing a mounted standard-bearer, with an inscription surrounding. Among all the French sculptors of the modern school there are none more original nor less academic than Bourdelle and Maillol. Their work completely breaks away "
