I was born on New York's lower East Side and the memories of early youth are vague and shadowy. I remember long, dark halls, crowded tenements, strange sour smells, drab unpainted walls and moving we were always moving. All these recollections are touched with a warm glow which came from my mother and my sisters who surrounded me with love and affection. My mother was full of an unquenchable fire that brought life to everything around her everything except my father who lived com pletely within himself. Father had beautiful eyes, a long white beard, and the face of a prophet. I can still see him moving about the house almost like a spirit. He was always praying and a sign of affection from him was a rarely given luxury. Mother was tiny, extraordinarily energetic she was the practical one on whom the family leaned. She enjoyed life to the utmost and when things were bad we were exceedingly poor and often didn't have enough to eat she would tell us wonderful, glowing stories of her past life in Russia to divert us from our hunger. She told us about 3 Between Sittings her grandfather, a wealthy businessman who adored her and brought her up; about her first marriage, when she was fifteen or sixteen, how this great love had come to a tragic end when he was drowned in a swim ming race; of her second marriage to my father, whose people were scholars and rabbis. My stepbrother George, who had emigrated to America before us, had written back enthusiastic letters from the New World. Mother loved to tell of landing in New York, her impressions of her first Amer ican home, her disillusionment. She never tired of talking about the rise and fall of the family fortunes. Mother particularly liked to tell us the story about Father who be lieved in miracles and always hoped to hold the winning ticket in some lottery. While she was carrying me, his friends would tease him, asking, if he had his choice, would he choose to have a son or to win a million in the lottery. That is why when I was born, on March 30, 1883, I was called \"The Million.\" On Saturdays, I would accompany Father to the synagogue. I re spected him but always tried to keep out of his way as much as pos sible for fear of offending him. I remember my father trying to teach me to read the Old Testament in Hebrew. I must have been very dense, for every session would end in tears. I recall one time Father explaining to me the story of creation. The Adam and Eve story was all right, but what bothered me was, since there was no one in the world but Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel, where did Cain get his wife? I remember my father smacking me down with a statement that with God everything was possible. You didn't ask questions about God. Qne of the incidents of my childhood I remember most clearly hap pened when I was about five or six. I was given a hobbyhorse. A big one. The horse stood on a board and the board had wheels. I didn't like that. A horse should have its feet on the ground and I was not happy until I had removed the board and the wheels. I could sit on the horse and the horse stood on its own four feet. It was wonderful until one of my sisters they were all older than I thought she would try it too. 4 \"The Million\" She did. The horse could not take it. The legs gave way and that was the end of the horse. It was a tragedy. Nancy was the oldest of my three sisters. She was pretty and spoiled, the apple of my mother's eye. Rachel was my pal I called her Rachie a vivacious creature with sparkling, snapping eyes like my mother's. Then, there was beautiful, sensitive Rose, rather like Father, soft-voiced, poetic and musical. My mother was determined that my sisters go through college. She would not have them working in factories. As I was a boy, it did not matter, but the girls, she felt, must be protected. I remember my mother and Nancy sewing neckties, my sister Ray ironing neckties with a Latin book propped up in front of her. It was my job to deliver neckties. Our house was always full of people, all kinds: my mother was a great storyteller and the house resounded with laughter. She was a wonder ful cook and could stretch a half-pound of meat to feed more mouths than anyone else in the world. She was never still for a moment. She had a special gift with words and could scold and swear and fascinate all at the same time. One summer we had a wooden shack away out in the country at lopth Street and Riverside Park. I remember going around barefoot picking wild strawberries and raspberries and what jam my mother could make, such macaroons, such bread! I can still taste them. She was urged to make a business of it, but she stuck to the neckties. My sisters helped and that's the way the family maintained itself while Father grew more and more isolated from us, spending most of his time in the synagogue. One of the young men who frequented our house was David Ber- cinsky. He was charming and witty, and had a beautiful singing voice. My mother often scolded him for being a ne'er-do-well but she secretly liked him. One day he dropped out of sight and it wasn't until a few weeks later that a visitor reported that David was working in a drug store. My mother made a bet a box of candy against a necktie that the visitor could not produce him. She lost the necktie but acquired a Between Sittings son-in-law, for David Bercinsky eventually married my eldest sister Nancy and became one of the outstanding physicians in New Haven. His house in George Street, with Nancy presiding, was to become a haven for all the Davidsons and their friends. My mother was a natural snob and did not approve of my associating with the other kids on the street. Just as I would get into a game of cat or baseball, one of my sisters would stick her head out of the win dow and shout: \"J\" eee ' Come upstairs!\" It became a slogan with the other kids. It was then that I dropped the \"e\" from \"Joe.\" In school I was lazy and very often did not do my homework; I was always drawing pictures. The teachers liked them and frequently had me decorate the blackboard with colored chalks. The stars and stripes and the American eagle were predominant in those blackboard drawings. It is curious how little I remember of my school days. I was always in a dream, vague and lazy. I understand now being underfed, I wanted to sleep all the time. Very early I had to contribute to the support of the household. Gold was not so easily found on the streets of New York and jobs were not so plentiful. If you looked at the newspapers of those days, the want-ad sections read: \"WANTED Young man as second man in private family, Englishman preferred. Apply 23 Washington Square North.\" \"BOYS Four Protestants to pass bills. Meet party on S.E. corner Eighth Street and Third Avenue at 8 o'clock sharp.\" \"AGENTS AND PHYSICIANS in each city to represent the Morrell Liquor Cure. Address the Morrell Liquor and Morphine Cure, i and 3 Ann Street, New York City.\" And that is why, like most of the other boys I knew, I took to selling newspapers. My stand at the corner of Duane Street and Broadway was a busy one and there were many others who coveted it. I put up a good fight for that corner, but finally lost it. 6 \"The Million\" That fall, I didn't want to return to school, but my mother and sisters insisted that I should at least graduate from grammar school. They put me in a room, emptied of all distracting materials, and left me, thinking I would do my homework. They had forgotten, however, to remove David Copperfield, and I spent the whole day reading it. I got through the exams by the skin of my teeth just the required 75%. The family still needed help, so I got a job as an apprentice to a house- painter and paperhanger. His name was Anspacher and his store was on Lexington Avenue, at the corner of Fifty-ninth Street. Work started at seven in the morning, preparing the pots and paints for the painters. I would accompany them on their jobs and on returning, I had to wash all their brushes and clean the pots to be ready for the next day. That would take until seven in the evening, I don't remember how I lost that job, but I did. Then I got a job with the Western Union Telegraph Company at 16 Broad Street as a messenger boy. They gave me a uniform, of which I was very proud. When I showed myself in uniform to my family, the anticipated approval was not forthcoming but I stuck to that job. It was active. I was running about delivering messages and meeting all kinds of people, and while I sat about waiting for a call I would make sketches of the other messenger boys. They were my first appreciative audi ence \"Johnny, you are wasting your time, you ought to get a job on a newspaper.\" After Western Union, I got a job as office boy on the Public Opinion, a weekly. But that soon came to an end. Then for a time I was office boy in a sausage factory. This is a job I will never forget because it marks my first experience with a telephone a novel invention at the time. I was alone in the room when it rang and, terribly afraid, I took the receiver off the hook and put it gingerly to my ear. I was so frightened that the noises I heard meant nothing, so I put the receiver back. The phone rang again. I picked it up and made another effort to understand. It was no good. I let it ring. Then the boss ran into the office, and answered it, and when he got through talking I was fired. Next was a job as an errand boy in the bookstore and publishing house of Truslow, Hanson and Combs. They published a theosophical Between Sittings magazine. I remember delivering parcels of books to a Dr. Fullerton and I remember such names as Anna Besant and Madame Blavatsky. I lost that job too. There were lapses between jobs, and when they came I would hang around the house or go to the afternoon drawing class of the Educa tional Alliance on East Broadway. Across the way was Rabinowitz' bookstore, which had a magnetic fascination for me. There was always an array of second-hand books on the outside stalls. I could never pass without rummaging among the piles of books. One afternoon I came upon a title that held my attention. I began leafing through the book and it gripped me. I don't know how long I stood there reading when Mr. Rabinowitz tapped me on the shoulder, saying: \"This is not a library reading room.\" The little I read there that afternoon made such an impression on me that as soon as I was able to raise the necessary dime, I became the proud possessor of The Age of Reason by Tom Paine. I began to attend classes at an evening high school where we made drawings from plaster casts. I made sketches of my friends whenever they would pose for me. I used to go to the Henry. Street Settlement. I remember that one afternoon Lillian Wald was proudly showing my sketches to Mr. Jacob Schiff. He admired a drawing I did of my favorite cat, and she gave it to him. Every Saturday and Sunday, my friend Sam Halpert and I would walk from the East Side to the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Fifth Avenue at Eighty-second Street. There was a veiled lady in marble, which we knew was not good but which always secretly intrigued us. The huge halls and the plaster casts of Greek and Egyptian masterpieces filled us with awe. The Greek sculpture was human but the Egyptians fascinated and frightened me. But it was in the picture galleries that Sam and I spent most of our time. The idea of becoming an artist appealed to me. I would show my efforts to anyone who would look at them and my sister Ray was my most sympathetic booster. Rachie had graduated from Teachers* Col lege and was teaching in a public school. It was she who had succeeded 8 \"The Million\" in interesting someone to the extent of paying a year's tuition for me at the Art Students League. There I attended the evening classes and worked in the daytime. My first teacher was George de Forrest Brush. I was the youngest member of the life class, where we drew from nude living models. I felt very grown-up in these surroundings. It was at the Art Students League that I met Waterbury. He had a studio in Union Square and he asked me to visit him. I found him at work, painting an Indian head on a leather skin which he had first burned in with a pyrographic needle. He suggested that I should try my hand at pyrography because the pay was good. Waterbury demonstrated the process and showed me how to use the needle. Wasting no time, I took some of my drawings to the Flemish Art Company and applied for a job. I was hired. The boss took me into the shop and put me next to a girl who was to show me how to use a new mechanical gadget run by bellows. On the table was an array of leather pocketbooks with designs stamped on them which were to be burned into the leather. While the boss stood behind us, the young lady showed me how to work the bellows. I was so nervous and afraid of burning holes in the leather that I concealed my fear by working fast and furiously. The boss stood by, watched me for a bit and left me, convinced that he had really gotten hold of an expert. I was very happy there. I had a job which paid well and had something to do with art. Eventually I was transferred to the design department. One day I heard that Langsdorf and Company, a box factory, were looking for a foreman designer in their burnt wood department. I applied for and got the job. The workers there were on a piece work basis and the price they received depended on the time I spent on each piece. My new employers were very pleased with me, but the other employees complained to me that I worked much too fast. I was spoiling it for them and endangering their jobs. So I slowed up and as a result lost my job. . The best part of my life then was the evening drawing classes at 9 Between Sittings the Art Students League. In addition to Brush, I had as my teachers George Bridgman and Bryson Burroughs. On Saturdays and Sundays, I used to go to the Country Sketch Club. We would meet at the Club Saturdays on the top floor of the Folsom Building situated on the corner of Broadway and Thirteenth Street. There we would paint from a nude model. On Sundays, we would go to paint on Richmond Hill, Staten Island. Although I made black-and-white drawings, my paintings were very timid and pale. One day, in a discussion, someone asked me whether, by shutting my eyes, I could mentally see a desired color, red, blue or yellow. I tried and tried but all my concentration produced nothing and it was then that I de cided I was not a painter. 10 CHAPTER 2 I DISCOVER CLAY MY FAMILY was opposed to the idea of my be coming an artist because that meant a loafer, a perpetual pauper, an absolutely useless person. When my sister Nancy married David Bercinsky, they opened a drugstore in New Haven; by this means he worked his way through Yale Medical School, graduating cum laude, and then set himself up as a practicing physician in New Haven. My family felt that I should follow in his footsteps. I was eighteen and not having had a college education, I had to take courses to pass enough exams to get the necessary number of Regents' credits to enter medical school. David offered to help. I went to New Haven, moved into my sister's house, and settled down to work. In New Haven, David Bercinsky was having a pretty hard time of it. He was just starting to practice medicine and money was scarce. I went to see Randall, the college photographer on Chapel Street and asked him to lend me some photographs of Dr. Arthur Hadley, the newly appointed President of Yale University. Mr. Randall, a charming old fellow, complied with my request. In between cramming for the Regents' exams, I finally completed a burnt wood portrait of Presi dent Hadley on a three-ply wood panel. I took it over to show Mr. Randall and was overjoyed when he offered to display it in the window of his store. II Between Sittings The next day I went around to the store. There were quite a few people looking in the window. I peered over their shoulders and my heart missed a beat: the portrait was marked \"Sold.\" Mr. Randall had a check for me for twenty-five dollars. There was also a note from the purchaser, a M\"r. William S. Pardee, a lawyer who requested that I call on him at his office. Mr. Pardee asked many questions and when he spotted a sketchbook in my pocket, asked to see it. I gave it to him and he requested one or two drawings, saying that he would like to show them to Professor Neimeyer who was the head of the Yale Art School. Pardee also invited me to join them for lunch at the Quinipiack Club the following day. Later he presented my burnt wood portrait of Hadley to the Quinipiack Club. And that portrait is still hanging there today. It was during this lunch that Professor Neimeyer invited me to come and work at the Art School. I told him that I lacked the money for tuition and he replied that they were very glad to have young men of talent in the Art School. The Yale Art School at that time did not have many pupils. The drawing class was composed of Yale students who were obliged to \"take\" drawing. They drew from a nude male model, always the same one. Day after day I drew that model from every possible angle until I couldn't stand the sight of him. One day, wandering through the building, I found myself in the basement in a room full of plaster casts and modeling stands and not a soul in it. I found the clay bin, put my hand in it, and I touched the beginning of my life. The cool wet stuff gave me a thrill that I had never before ex perienced. I noticed a plaster cast of a mask of Saint Francis, stuck it up on the board and proceeded to copy it. I do not know how long I was at it, but I was so absorbed that I was suddenly startled by a man standing beside me. He was Mr. Boardman, the instructor of the model ing class, and he asked me how long I had been modeling. I said that this was the very first time I had touched clay. He did not seem to believe me, which gave me the feeling I wasn't too bad. We talked 12 I Discover Clay for a long time and the result was that I decided to chuck medicine and take up sculpture. On my first visit to New York, I went to the Art Students League and inquired who taught the sculpture class. I was told it was Herman A. MacNeil. They gave me his address, the Holbein Studios over the stables on West Fifty-fifth Street. I went to call on him to see if I could get a job in his studio. He asked me whether I had ever done any model ing, and, remembering Mr. Boardman's encouragement, I told him I had. MacNeil looked at me quizzically and said, \"I have to go out for a bit.\" He handed me a blueprint, saying, \"See what you can do with this,\" and took me to a stand piled up with plasticine the beginning of a Corinthian capital. Then MacNeil left. I had never seen a blueprint before in my life. I tried to figure it out, but it was hopeless. I looked around the studio. There were bronze statuettes of Indians; scale models for monuments; photographs of exe cuted work; and some portrait heads. I was fascinated and impressed. I made up my mind to get a job with that man. I struggled with my Corinthian capital but got nowhere. In the midst of this, Mr. MacNeil returned. He looked at the sorry mess I had made of his model, shook his head and asked me, \"How much do you expect to earn a week?\" I meekly suggested fifteen dollars. He said, \"Young man, you will never make that at sculpture.\" I asked him what he would give me, taking for granted that a job was there for me. He was taken unawares and said, \"Six dollars a week.\" I accepted. He looked defeated and said, \"All right. Come in Monday morning.\" I went home elated and told my people I had found a job in a great sculptor's studio. Though they did not approve, I think they caught my enthusiasm. I could hardly wait for Monday morning. At the appointed time, I rang the studio bell. The door opened and Mr. MacNeil stuck his head out of the door, scowling. \"I've thought it over,\" he said. \"You are not worth it.\" I followed him into the studio. 13 Between Sittings \"What am I worth?\" I asked. \"Four dollars.\" \"All right, I'll take it.\" He gave up. \"All right, you go to my studio in College Point, Long Island and see Mr. Gregory. Tell him you are the new studio boy.\" The ride was long and expensive, a carfare, a ferry and another carfare. I arrived at MacNeiTs house, which was on the Sound, in Long Island, and finally found Mr. Gregory. Mr. Gregory was rather brusque: \"Come on, hang up your things,\" he said, and he introduced me to Henri Crenier, the master sculptor. The studio was a huge barn of a place, or so it appeared to me then. It was full of work in progress. There was the \"Fountain of Liberty\" which Mr. MacNeil was making for the coming World's Fair in St. Louis. It consisted of colossal rampant sea-horses, cavorting over a cas cade of waves, sea formations and variegated seashells. At the other end of the studio there was an immense group in clay of two Indians the older Indian standing on his tiptoes with his arms folded across his chest, looking into the distance, the younger Indian with his left arm on the old man's shoulder and in his right hand waving an olive branch. The title of the group was \"The Coming of the White Man.\" There were plaster models and sketches of details of other projects. I was bewildered. John Gregory woke me out of my trance and took me down to the cellar where he was working on some plaster moldings. It didn't take him long to discover that I knew nothing but he sensed my eagerness and was quick to give me advice and information. When I got home, I talked everybody's ear off, but my sister Ray was the only one who listened sympathetically. She wanted to know all about it and there was so much to tell. Every day was an exciting discovery, every day I learned something. There were the problems of building an armature, running moldings and enlarging sketches and many many others. I was learning fast, but four dollars a week didn't go far. Most of it was eaten up by carfare and all this wasn't making my family very happy; money was needed at home and I was contributing practically nothing. I Discover Clay Mr. MacNeil had a gardener, an Indian, who didn't show, up one day. I knew that he was getting ten dollars a week and this gave me my opportunity. I approached MacNeil and suggested that I would like to take on the gardener's job. MacNeil raised his eyebrows and said, \"Do you know anything about gardening?\" I said I could do what the Indian did. \"How do you plan to do that?\" said he. I said I could sleep in the balcony of the studio, get up at sunrise, work in: the garden until eight, work in the studio from eight till five, and then work in the garden from five till sundown. That seemed reasonable to him and with a smile, he said, \"You are on.\" That night I announced to my family that things were looking up, and the next day I brought my belongings over and installed myself in a corner of the balcony, opposite the corner occupied by Gregory. That week I could not do enough, but when I collected my pay envelope, which I had been looking forward to, I found only ten dollars. I was sore but said nothing. Besides being a gardener, a sculptor's assistant and an errand boy, I also became a model. Henri Crenier had noticed my legs one day while we were swimming and insisted that they were just right for the young Indian in \"The Coming of the White Man.\" MacNeil thought they could save time by making a plaster cast of my legs. So Gregory and Crenier volunteered to do the job, claiming to be ex perts in casting from life. I was innocent and did not realize what I was up against. I was rather hairy, and they haphazardly rubbed the oil over my legs. That done, they covered my legs with plaster, and as the plaster set, the string that was to separate the two halves of the mold broke. Their fun increased as my temper rose, but I was in plaster up to my loins and was helpless. After setting, plaster became very hot and disagreeable. Mr. Gregory and Mr. Crenier chopped gleefully away, separating the two halves. Having completed that part of the job to their satisfaction, they proceeded to take the mold off my legs. The pain was excruciating, for the hair got mixed up with the plaster and T C Between Sittings as they pulled the mold off me my hair went with it. I screamed and swore at them but my anguish only made them laugh louder. They finally got the mold off, leaving my legs like two boiled lobsters. The cast turned out to be a very hairy one. I saw those legs many years later in NacNeiTs studio, and I swear they were hairier than ever! Henri Crenier took a special delight in teasing me. I liked him and took it good-naturedly. But one day I lost my temper and we came to blows. I knocked him down and relieved my feelings by giving him a healthy pumraeling. I was so busy that I did not hear MacNeil come into the studio. Suddenly I heard him say: \"Ji when you get through, will you mix me a little plaster.\" The summer passed quickly. Those were rich and full days. I was sure of my vocation: I was going to be a sculptor. 16 CHAPTER 3 A COSSACK IN ST. LOUIS WHEN THE WORK in MacNeil's studio for the St. Louis World's Fair was finished, John Gregory sailed for France. Gregory and I had become very friendly and when he left, life in the studio was not the same. I needed to make more money than I was making at MacNeil's. There was only one thing to do go back to New York and pyrography. But the fashion for pyrography was short-lived and I began look ing around for something else. I heard that young sculptors were needed in St. Louis to work on the Fair Grounds. Mr. MacNeil gave me a letter of introduction to Mr. Zolney, the sculptor in charge. But the trouble was the usual one. I had no money to pay my fare to St. Louis. An introduction to the manager of the Anglo-American Wafer Company, which made wafers for ice-cream sandwiches, got me a job as traveling salesman to sell their wafers to jobbers. My territory was Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, Cincinnati and St. Louis. So I started out and it took me more than two weeks to reach my destina tion. I had ten dollars when I left New York, and the miracle of it was that, after getting my commission on the sale of the wafers, paying transportation, food and lodging, I landed in St. Louis with exactly ten dollars. The first thing was to find lodgings the cheapest. I found a Between Sittings hall bedroom in a rooming house. It was a room with a skylight and no space for anything but the bed. When I opened the door there was not much else to do but to jump into bed. But it was lodgings. It was St. Louis. It was the World's Fair. The landlady insisted on a month's rent in advance. The price eight dollars. But I have a pleasant memory of that room. One Sunday I spent the day in bed reading Huckleberry Finn. I laughed so loud that the land lady's daughter pushed open the door to see what was wrong and I made her listen to Jim and Huck on King Solomon. When I presented MacNeil's letter to Mr. Zolney, it was too late. He had all the young men he needed. There were more applicants than jobs. Two dollars doesn't go far. I went to the fair grounds to look for a job and paid my admission, fifty cents a quarter of my fortune. I went early in the morning, spent the day, and soon discovered that \"birds of a feather\" was a fact. I fell in with a bunch of derelicts like myself. When I told them I had paid to come into the fair grounds, they told me I was a sucker. They showed me what to do, and I never paid again. I did everything at the World's Fair pushed rolling chairs; told fortunes; acted as a ballyhoo for sideshows on the Pike. But I had an idea. If I could only get a job at pyrography, the one thing I knew all about, I would be all right. Walking along the Pike, I saw a sign: \"Booth for Rent, Inquire at the Temple of Palmistry.\" Armed with a portfolio of my drawings, I called on the lady in charge, a Mrs. McGee. Mrs. McGee was a tall, stately, white-haired lady. She smilingly in formed me that the rent for the booth was two thousand dollars for the season. That did not stump me. I told her I had a great idea. If I could find a manufacturer of leather goods to take the booth, I would make portraits on leather cushions and monograms on the reverse side. I told her about the burnt wood portraits I had made of President Hadley and others, and I showed her my drawings. She was very much interested and very motherly, thought she knew someone who might be interested, and invited me to come to breakfast the following 18 A Cossack in St. Louis Sunday about ten o'clock. As I had been living strictly from hand to mouth, the invitation to Sunday breakfast was something to look for ward to. The address was somewhere on Grand near Franklin Avenue, about an hour's walk from my lodgings on Fourteenth and Carr. Realiz ing the distance, I started early, found the house, and there, dusting the furniture on the porch, was a tall, willowy, beautiful girl with a handkerchief on her head. I asked her where Mrs. McGee lived. She said, \"Right here. Do come in. Mother is at church. She won't be long.\" When Mrs. McGee arrived she greeted me and said, \"I see you have met my daughter Gertrude. Mr. Smith will be here shortly. He is your leather goods manufacturer.\" We went in to breakfast. Mrs. McGee was dressed in white linen, and with her white hair she looked all starched. As we sat down we were joined by Mr. Smith and Gertrude's brother and sister. Mrs. McGee put me next to her. It was a gay party. They were apparently all in the show business. They got me talking, which was even then an easy thing to do, and in my enthusiasm I inadvertently spilled my cup of black coffee on Mrs. McGee's lap. Her son burst into a raucous laugh. I was so embarrassed I was miserable and I could not get over it. Mrs. McGee scolded her son and reminded him it might have happened to him. This unfortunate incident broke the ice and I spent a happy day with the McGees. Mr. Smith had a concession, a booth in the Varied Industries Build ing, where he sold his wares, and he gave me the job I was looking for. I did quite a few profile portraits on leather cushions and designed mono grams. It was fun. I met all kinds of people. I did a portrait on leather of Geronimo, the last of the Indian chiefs and a magnificent figure of a man. He would come to the McGees' to pose for me. I was on Easy Street One day two Russian Cossacks passed by my booth. They were in full regalia: fur hats, boots and spurs, rows of cartridges on their chests and daggers in their scabbards. I thought they were 21 couple of showfolks from the Pike. I knew one or two words in Russian and 19 Between Sittings 1 I hailed them. They wheeled around, and practically fell into my arms, jabbering away. I did not understand a word, but I could see that they were in trouble. There was one solution: the Russian Westing- house exhibit was in the same building. Surely the man in charge could speak Russian. I took them there, and they wept as they told their story. It appeared that their goods had been confiscated by the govern ment for undervaluation. It was all the fault of the interpreter they had employed, who had also absconded with some of their money. The Westinghouse intervention cleared all that up. Their goods were released and they started fitting up the booth assigned to them. Their goods consisted of pipes, walking sticks, papercutters, ink stands, all made of wood inlaid with silver. One of these Cossacks would sit cross-legged on the table and actually inlay the silver in a design, while a crowd admired his skill. The Cossacks hung on to me, insisting that I had saved their lives. There was nothing to do but to chuck pyrography and become a Cossack. It was fun, I improved my Russian vocabulary, business boomed and my share was profitable. Mrs. McGee's Temple of Palmistry became one of rny favorite hangouts. The attraction was her daughter Ted. I used to act as a ballyhoo to induce people to come in to have their fortunes told, and occasionally I would help out by telling fortunes. I had met Clivette, the magician who traveled under the name of \"The Man in Black.\" He claimed to have written Chiro's book on palmistry, which I had read. The Fair was closed on Sunday mornings, but Gertrude McGee and I used to go there very early and wander around amongst the Eskimos, the Igorotes, the Patagonians and the hairy Ainus of Japan. I filled sketchbooks with sketches of everyone I knew and saw. I drew my head oif . I was never without a sketchbook, but as everything comes to an end, so did the Fair. I shall never forget the Fair's closing the deserted Pike, the various exhibitors packing their goods. I felt as if something had died. There was a sense of tragedy about it. A man in Chicago offered to buy 20 A Cossack in St. Louis up a part of the Cossacks' stock, so I accompanied them to Chicago, where we closed the deal. From there we proceeded to Atlantic City, where they opened a little shop. I got fed up. I was not a shopkeeper but I didn't want to go home. I made a drawing of a girl I met, and she had a friend who had the wheelchair concession on the boardwalk. He gave me space and allowed me to put up a sign: \"Your Portrait, Twenty-five Cents for a Profile, Fifty Cents for a Full Face. No Likeness, No Pay.\" I did a pretty brisk business made lots of drawings, mostly profiles. The heads were about two inches high, all duly signed and dated. Just a few years ago I was lunching with some friends in the outskirts of Philadelphia and the hostess, a charming elderly lady, said: \"You know I have a portrait you did of me which I treasure very much.\" I looked at the lady, smiled doubtfully. She said: \"You know we were then both very much younger.\" She took me into her library, and there beautifully framed was a portrait of the lady bearing my sig nature and dated: Atlantic City, 1905. On the beach opposite my stand a young man made sculpture in the sand. He was not too good. We got acquainted and I suggested that we go into partnership. I would model the sand sculpture very early in the morning and he could collect the money which we would later divide between us. I showed him what I could do. We tried it out on the public and we made a deal. I modeled figures of dancers and Indian chiefs, all executed in high relief. It was a curious crowd I met and played with in Atlantic City. They were concessionaires, hotel clerks, lifeguards and show people. At Young's Pier there was a continuous performance, and at the entrance of the pier was the great Pillsbury, the famous chessplayer. He would play simultaneously as many people as would take him on and never lose a game. He and I became very friendly. Another of my passions at that time was bowling. As soon as I made a few bucks with my draw ings I would spend them in the bowling alley. It was while I was making the drawings on the boardwalk that I met Mr. Beamish, a newspaper man from the Philadelphia North Amer- 21 Between Sittings ican. We got acquainted after I made a drawing of him. I told him that I was a sculptor, or hoped to be one, and I told him it was I who was doing that sand stuff. He was a frequent visitor to Atlantic City, and we would meet occasionally in the bowling alley. One day he had an assignment for me for his paper. I do not remember the reason for it, but he got me to make a drawing from life of some famous dog. The next day there was a two-column spread of my drawing with my signature. Beamish, or \"the Bishop,\" as he was called by his friends, suggested that I could use my talents as a sculptor making quick bas- reliefs of people in the news. He was sure I could get a job on his paper, and invited me to accompany him to Philadelphia. I accepted. Beamish took me over and introduced me to the Sunday Editor. His name was Smith. The Bishop had him pose for me to demonstrate my skill, and Mr. Smith called in a friend of his and I had a shot at him too. The idea was that I go to the courts, and, instead of pen drawings, make bas-reliefs in plasticine. Mr. Smith had the idea that I make lay out and covers for Sunday magazine sections. That night I had dinner with the Bishop and told him what Mr. Smith had said. Said Beamish: \"Johnny, don't you take that job without a contract. First thing you know they will all be doing it and you will be out of a job.\" He didn't know, but I was out of the job quicker than he thought. When I asked for a contract, I was practically booted out of the place. I looked for the Bishop, but he had left town. Here I was, jobless and penniless, walking the streets of Philadelphia. I was always impe cunious, living from day to day, but it did not worry me. I bumped into a couple of fellows, show folks, whom I had known at Young's Pier in Atlantic City, and I told them my story. They wept crocodile tears and said that if I would make a drawing of each of them, they would pay for them. They were joined by some of their friends, whom I also drew, and they invited me into a saloon to have a drink. When I tried to collect my fees, they laughed at me. We got into a fist fight and I came away with a black eye and no money. My guardian angel must have been hovering around. I didn't walk 22 A Cossack in St. Louis three blocks before I ran into Tom Field, a bowling-alley companion from Atlantic City. He looked at me under the lamplight, for it was dusk, and wanted to know what had happened to me. He invited me to come to his hotel for dinner, saying that he had to leave town that night, and that I could use his room at the Garrick Hotel After dinner he left me and I went to bed. The next morning my breakfast was brought to me in my room with a note from my friend Tom Field. The note contained a rail way ticket to New York, a five-dollar bill and the advice to use it as soon as possible. I followed the advice and arrived home with my black eye. It took a bit of explaining, but I got away with it. 2 3 CHAPTER 4 MY FIRST COMMISSION THE YEAR BEFORE I had won an honorable men tion for a sketch of a little figure of David. I wanted a chance to execute it, so I went to New Haven and called on my friend Mr. Pardee, the lawyer. The photograph of my sketch of David appealed to him and he commissioned me to execute it, two feet high, in bronze. Back in New York, the Art Students League gave me the room which was used by the modeling class at night. In return I agreed to teach the summer class. The \"David\" was an idea and a challenge but I needed a model and managed to talk Itzel, a young cousin of mine into posing. He had a beautiful figure, about as young as I wanted my David to be. My figure represented David slinging the stone at an invisible Goliath. I started with enthusiasm and worked every day, but as I worked my enthusiasm lagged. I seemed to be just killing time and getting nowhere. I worked without conviction. It came to a point where I would come in one day, undo what I had done the day before and start all over again. I was getting discouraged. Edward MacCarten would come in occasion ally to see how I was getting on. One day he said, \"Jo, here's an idea. When you come here tomorrow go to work as if this is your last day on earth and you have to finish your statue before you die.\" This struck home. The next day I went to work with new energy. I didn't die that night, nor did I finish the \"David\" that day. But as I 24 My First Commission look back, MacCarten's advice was one of the greatest contributions that I ever receivecMrom a fellow artist. I finally completed the statue of David. Mr. Pardee came to see it and was so pleased with it that he offered to pay for an extra bronze. I was all puffed up. The Society of American Artists was to hold its annual exhibition. To participate, one's work had to be passed on by a jury. I decided to risk it, and sent in my \"David.\" It was accepted. An engraved invitation to the private showing arrived. It had my name on it. My sister Ray was so proud of me! The invitation was for two. But I hesitated about attending such a fancy affair; I did not have any proper clothes. However, my uncle, who was staying with us, was a little man just my size and he had a Prince Albert coat and striped trousers. I tried them on and they almost fitted. So I took my sister and we set out together nervous and excited. The exhibition was held in the Fine Arts Building, which adjoined the League. I knew the building well, but that evening I hardly knew where I was. We walked up the few steps and entered the great gallery all crowded with people. I must have been a very funny sight in that Prince Albert coat, but I was walking on air, completely unconscious of my clothes. We went around looking for my \"David.\" There he was in bronze on exhibition with the works of real artists, sculptors and painters! I felt timid about looking at it. I pretended to be interested in everybody else's work but my own. We ran into MacNeil. \"How do you like the way we placed your 'David'?\" I would have liked it no matter where they placed it. I do not think I have ever felt that way since. At the close of the exhibition I delivered the \"David\" to Mr. Pardee and when the second bronze copy was finished I took it home and placed it on the mantelpiece of our front room. The next day when I came home from the League I found my father looking intently at my \"David.\" He was unconscious of my presence. Then he turned and saw me, and with a disapproving gesture of the hand, said \"Bah,\" turned on his heel and left the room. Father had had other ambitions for me. Between Sittings While at home, I modeled a bust of my mother. She was intensely proud of me and was a most willing sitter. When it was completed, I sent it to an exhibition of the National Academy of Design. But it was turned down. This bust of my mother is still a good piece of sculpture, far better than my \"David.\" Now I was spending entire days at the League and getting acquainted with the other students who worked there in the daytime. There was one girl in that class whom I particularly wanted to meet. She was the monitor of the class, a tall Junoesque girl. Her name was Florence Lucius. Those were gay days: music, dancing and parties. To those parties at the League I brought my sisters Ray and Rose and it was not long before I brought the League to my house. We were then living on West 1 1 ith Street overlooking the Park. It was a top-floor railroad flat, but nobody minded climbing all those flights of stairs. Mother's strawberry jam, Rose's singing and Rachie's warm and vivacious charm pulled people right up to the top floor. My sister Rose recalls those days with a bit of free verse: \"Like a fldck of homing pigeons, Nostalgic memories flapped their wings, And roused the slumbering past. A victrola, And listening to the Sextet from 'Lucia' Zembrich Scotti Caruso Talking about victrolas the first phonograph New York I 1 ith Street top floor front room An olive green velour curtain separating it from the rest of the railroad flat, And endless tea parties, Schubert's 'Serenade,' Sam Halpert, tears running down his cheeks. . . .\" I fell hard for Florence Lucius, or Flossie, as we called her. One night, she took me home to meet her father. He was the engineer who designed and built the Third and Ninth Avenue elevated railroads in New York. It was a long trek to Flossie's house in Brooklyn, but it did not stop 26 My First Commission me from going there often. One night I was there to dinner, with Grace Johnson, another student from the League. Flossie and Grace had planned a walking trip and Flossie's father, who was all for it, had procured the necessary maps. They were excited about their forthcoming adventure. But Flossie's father had misgivings about two girls going alone. I agreed with him, and offered to accompany them. He approved of that most heartily. A few days later, we took the Hudson River boat to Kingston. We went through the Swangum Mountains in New Jersey, Lake Mohonk and Minnewaska. We walked all day, stopping at some farmhouse at night, where they would feed us and give us lodgings. We, in turn, would entertain our various hosts along the way: Flossie played the organ which we often found in these farmhouses and we would all sing. I would play the mouth-organ and do a little jig. In this way we came into the lives of people who had never gone further than a few miles from their farms and they would see us off in the mornings with regret, making us promise to come back. We vowed we would and sincerely meant it. ... It was all a wonderful new experience. After a week, we were sunburnt and healthy but our city feet were sorely blistered and we had to call it quits. We got a lift back to Kings ton and the next morning we took the Hudson River boat for home. CHAPTER 5 UPTON SINCLAIR'S SOCIALIST COLONY ABOUT THIS TIME, I completed a statue I called \"Primitive Music\" and I felt it was time that I had a studio of my own. I found one on East Twenty-third Street. It was not too big, but it had a skylight and room for a couch and a couple of modeling stands. The house was an old brownstone, and on the first landing was the studio of Albert Groll, the landscape painter whose pictures of the Arizona Desert were the talk of the day. One or two flights up was Edward Ziegler, a mural painter. Next door to me, on the top floor, was a -chap named Henrici. He painted copies of J, G. Brown's shoeshine boys. He was a very successful, busy man and a picture was no sooner finished than it was sold. During the first part of 1906, life in my Twenty-third Street studio was a series of adventures and discoveries. One day I received a visit from a curious-looking person. He was an art critic and his name was Sadaldchi Hartmann. Sadakichi was tall and gaunt, with a face like a Japanese mask. He later told me about himself. His mother was Japanese; his father had been German Consul at Nagasaki, and while in service had made a tem porary marriage which resulted in two sons. The elder brother came to America and I don't think Sadakichi Hartmann ever heard of him again. Sadakichi was brought up in Germany by Paul Haise and then in France under the tutelage of St6phane Mallarme, the French poet. He finally landed in Boston where Mrs. Jack Gardner took him up. 28 Upton Sinclair's Socialist Colony When I met Sadakichi he had already been in a mess of trouble. He had written a play in verse about Jesus Christ, which brought him a jail sentence in Boston. He told me all this while I was doing his bust. When he first came to see me I was working on a little statuette which I called \"The Eyelids of the Dawn.\" Sadakichi was most appreciative of my efforts. I was flattered, for he used to come and see me quite often. I brought him home and he read poetry Edgar Allan Poe and Walt Whitman. He had a wonderful reading voice. My sisters were fasci nated. One day he came to my studio and asked me if I could lend him a dollar. He needed it very badly, he said. I didn't have it besides a dol lar was a lot of money to me. But there was my friend Henrici next door he was always good for a loan. I went to see him and he gave me the dollar, which I, in turn, gave to Sadakichi. It was getting on to lunch time. He said: \"Where are you going to lunch?\" \"At my usual place, the saloon at the corner of Second Avenue. A glass of beer costs five cents and there is plenty of free lunch.\" He gave me a lecture on how one cannot produce art on beer and free lunch. Now, he would take me to lunch at the Cafe Francis, the rendezvous of all the great artists of the day. Jim Moore who owned and ran the place was his friend. I had never been in such surroundings. Soft leather benches along the walls, waiters in white coats, and sure enough there were Glackens, George Luks and many others. Sadakichi was greeted by some, and ig nored by others. We sat at a corner table where we could see everybody. Sadakichi ordered wine with our meal. I tried to stop him but he seemed to know what he was about and would stand no interference. When our lunch was finally finished, Sadakichi called for the bill, and when it arrived, he pulled out such a roll of bills from his pocket that my eyes bulged. I was furious. \"What's the big idea?\" \"Oh, that's my rent money,\" and he grinned his Japanese-mask grin. \"But my dollar you borrowed?\" He laughed his peculiar laugh. \"That was to pay for your lunch.\" This was Sadakichi Hartmann. 29 Between Sittings One winter day, Sadakichi came to my studio while I was working on a figure. There was a girl posing for it. Sadakichi began to tell us a wonderful story about Upton Sinclair's recently founded socialist colony in New Jersey called Helicon Hall. I had heard of it because the colony, located at Englewood, had created quite a stir in the press. New York newspapermen insisted that Upton Sinclair had started the colony to have plenty of mistresses handy. To these and other barbs, Sinclair re plied that it was with his colony \"as with the old-time New England colonies: there were Indians hiding in the bushes, seeking to pierce us with sharp arrows of wit.\" Sadakichi told us the guests were socialists, anarchists, syndicalists and single-taxers. It sounded like a description from William Morris' News from Nowhere. As Sadakichi pointed out that he had many friends there, my model chimed in to say that she also had friends at Helicon Hall. Sadakichi said: \"That settles it.\" So off we went to Helicon Hall, Sadakichi, the girl and I. It was mid-winter and it had been snowing. The air was crisp and in vigorating. We arrived at about dinner time and the Sinclairs invited us to sit down and share their board. After dinner we retired to the Big Hall. It had large-sized palm trees in buckets in front of an enormous fireplace. There were many squatting girls with short hair and long cigarette holders, in those days completely revolutionary. Mrs. Sinclair sat down in a wicker rocker, and I pro ceeded to make a drawing of her. She expressed regret that they could not put us up. I said innocently that I did not mind I would cheerfully spend the night in the chair I was sitting in. When I completed my sketch I went in search of my friend Sadakichi. In the conservatory, where there were a lot of singing birds in cages, I found Edwin Bjorkman berating Sadakichi. \"We told you we had no room. Every available space is occupied. Besides, you are drunk.\" And so he was. \"Very well,\" said Sadakichi, \"we shall leave. Come on, Jo, we are not wanted here!\" By this time, there was quite a commotion in the peaceful colony, a crowd had gathered in the hall around us while Sinclair kept on explaining 30 Upton Sinclair's Socialist Colony that they were full up, but when he said that if Teddy Roosevelt him self appeared there that night, they could not put him up, it was more than I could take. I suggested that if that happened, they would all creep out of their beds and beg him to sleep there. In the midst of all this my model appeared, and Sadakichi, with a Cyrano de Bergerac gesture, said: \"We are leaving.\" It was late. The streetcars were not running; the last train had left for New York. But again our Sadakichi Hartmann had an inspiration. It was only a two-mile walk to his friend the painter, Van Perrine who had a studio on the Palisades. \"That's where we will go.\" And off we went into the snow which was piling up quite high by this time. It was a considerable trek. I don't know how long we walked, but it was more than two miles. At last, we came to a beautiful house, bright in the moonlight, on a cliff overlooking the Hudson. It was a welcome sight, but as we approached it we heard the dogs barking. We knocked on the door, but no Perrine, only an intensified barking. Bad luck, I thought, he must have gone to town. It was cold it was more than that it was freezing. Our feet were wet. But Sadakichi was unperturbed. He had a bottle of whiskey and every now and then he would take a swig of it. Whiskey and I were not to become friends until much later. However, I did take a swallow and coughed myself warm again. We found a shed, obviously the oil house the tank almost filled it but the girl and I managed to squeeze in for shelter from the wind. Outside we watched Sadakichi who was dancing in the snow. He emptied the whiskey bottle, threw it over the cliff into the Hudson and then threw his suitcase after it. It was a wonderful performance, but we were still freezing. We attempted to gather some dead wood to build a fire and managed to pick up a few sticks, but we were- not smokers, and so there were no matches. All of a sudden, we heard a call from Sadakichi from the other side of the house. When we joined him, we saw that he was trying to jimmy up the window. At this point, the blind suddenly flew up and there stood Van Deering Perrine in the window. \"Sadakichi, you are drunk.\" 31 Between Sittings With these words, Sadakichi's \"friend\" shut his window and we went back to our shelter. Fortunately for us, a man went by from whom we borrowed a few matches. We built a fire, thawed ourselves out and started homeward. We caught the first train out, and when we got to New York Sadakichi and the girl went uptown and I got back to my studio, exhausted. I was cold, I was mad, but bed was just heaven. I don't know how long I had been sleeping when there was a knock on the door. I opened it and there stood a man who asked, \"Are you Jo Davidson?\" I grumbled, I was. \"You have just come from Helicon Hall?\" He then went on to ask what had happened up there and my reply must have conveyed my in tense aggravation with the whole adventure. While I was talking an other man appeared who said he was from the World. The first man turned out to be from the Evening Sun. This was my first encounter with the press. When they left, I locked the door and jumped back into bed. There was more knocking but I was too exhausted to answer. That afternoon when I was visiting my family, a friend came in with a copy of the Evening Sun. On the front page was a big headline: \"POET, SCULPTOR AND LADY OUT IN THE COLD, COLD WORLD\" The next day, I saw Sadakichi Hartmann and finally understood the whole story. He admitted that he had gone directly to a telephone booth, called up several papers, told them the story and for further de tails, said: \"See Jo Davidson.\" All sorts of stories, editorials followed. I thought I would never live it down. Shortly -afterwards, Upton Sinclair's colony came to an abrupt end through no fault of mine: at three o'clock, one Sunday morning, it was burned to the ground. Circumstances surrounding the accident still remain a mystery. 32 CHAPTER 6 AN EAST-SIDER ON THE LEFT BANK I WAS 24 YEARS OLD and had a compulsion to go to Paris. This was due primarily to Gregory, who had just returned, and who had fired my imagination with his descriptions of the center of the world of art. It was my old friend, Mr. Pardee who gave me the hundred and fifty dollars necessary to take me as far as the French capital. Following the purchase of a second-class ticket on the Celtic, I ar rived in Paris with only $40.00 left and a heavy bundle of blankets and linen which my mother had forced upon me before my departure. Arriving at the Gare St. Lazare at five in the morning, I was met by my friend, Edward MacCarten. I remember that it had been raining that morning and there was a special pungent perfume in the air which I later discovered was caused by the tar cedarwood pavements peculiar to the streets of Paris in those days. I drank my first vin-blanc citron in a sidewalk cafe and I was firmly installed in heaven. MacCarten had rented a studio for me next to his own at 7 rue Belloni. I got my furniture for 50 francs from Arthur Lee, a sculpture student, my kitchen utensils from Emma Goldman, the fa mous anarchist. I blessed my mother for the blankets and linen and was ready to get to work. MacCarten applauded my good fortune, taking it for granted that I 33 Between Sittings had at least won a scholarship. I stalled, and asked him how one got into the Beaux Arts. \"You pick the atelier,\" he said, \"and the professor that you want to study under. You appear before him with photos of the work you have done and he will either accept or reject you as his pupil. They are very lenient with Americans. It is much more difficult for Frenchmen, who have to pass all sorts of exams. Of course, if you are admitted, you will have to buy drinks for the 'ancients.' You should try to join my atelier.\" I would have done anything to get into the Beaux Arts that's what I had come to Paris for. MacCarten had been in Paris for over a year, and I looked upon him as a know-all. We had been buddies in New York, and I was now to be his neighbor and classmate in the same atelier. My studio rent was no francs for three months. That included the tip to the concierge. Very little was left of my forty dollars. I finally con fessed the sad reality to MacCarten. He turned pale. \"How are you going to live?\" \"Oh, I'll get a job,\" I said cheerfully. \"A job in Paris you're crazy. You don't even speak French. Even if you did, you couldn't get a job in Paris.\" At any rate MacCarten introduced me to his bakery and his creamery, and every morning a loaf of bread and a quart of milk were left at my door. It was extraordinary, the trust, the confidence that existed in Paris in pre- World War I days. Broke as I was, I never went without a meal. It may have been meager, but I didn't starve. I enrolled in the Beaux Arts, got into Engelbert's atelier, and was hailed by the \"ancients\" as a nouveau, with the usual procedure of razzing and hazing. I was warned that if you were not good-natured, you would have a bad time of it. I jigged for them and sang and played the har monica, and they decided I was all right. As a newcomer, I took my place in the back of the class. I put up a figure, and the next morning when I arrived I found that somebody had pulled it down. Apparently, that was the traditional procedure. It took time but I finally managed to keep a figure up. I was terribly in earnest and waited breathlessly for my first criticism from the maitre. When I 34 An East-Sider on the Left Bank received it, I had a feeling it was the same kind of banal instruction I had had in New York. That was not what I had come to Paris for. I wanted to capture life and Paris was pulsating with it. I stuck it out at the Beaux Arts for three weeks and then I left a decision I have never regretted. The Beaux Arts experience was not my only disappointment. Upon my arrival in Paris, I had gone to the Louvre to see the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo, \"the greatest masterpiece of all time.\" I had read Walter Pater's breathless appreciation of Leonardo da Vinci's master piece and I knew the Venus de Milo from plaster casts. I arrived at the Louvre all keyed up to receive the greatest thrill possible. I found my way to the Salle Carre, walked straight to the guard and asked him where the Mona Lisa was. He turned me around and there it was and there was I, waiting for something to happen. It didn't happen. I left the Salle Carre and found my way to the Venus de Milo. The same nega tive impression. I felt myself to be insensitive and ignorant and walked home very despondent. I did not dare to confess my reactions to my fellow artists. At this point, there were two major problems on my horizon: I felt very lonely: I had to talk to someone. I also needed money badly. Getting a job in a sculptor's studio was out of the question; I had akeady tried too many times unsuccessfully. I had come loaded with letters of introduction to many people, among them, one to Paul Bartlett from Sadakichi Hartmann. To call on him, I put on my best suit, and with a portfolio containing some drawings and photos of the things I had done, and with the letters of introduction, I appeared at Mr. Bardett's studio in the rue Daguerre, where he was then working on his equestrian statue of Lafayette. Incidentally, it was to take him ten years to complete this work. I knocked and after a minute or two, the door opened just a crack. Mr. Bartlett stuck his head out and said: \"What do you want?\" I handed him the letter. He stood where he was, blocking the door, read it and said: \"Well, what is it?\" Staggered, I replied: \"Why nothing, nothing.\" And that was the end of the interview. 35 Between Sittings Shortly afterwards, MacCarten took me over to the American Art Association and introduced me to the secretary, Henry Moskowitz, known as Mosky. The A.A.A. was a club for American artists and stu dents and I explained my desperate predicament. I had to get a job and get it quick. \"But what kind of job what can you do?\" Could I give English lessons? Mosky opened the drawer of his desk, looked through some correspondence and found a letter from a lady who had inquired for someone to give her English lessons. \"Here, try that,\" he said. The lady lived on the Avenue d'Alma. She was middle-aged and charming. Her English was very slight and my French was nil, but I got the job; three francs an hour, five hours a week. I don't recall how much English the lady learned but I do remember that she taught me French and saved me from going hungry. Before going to Paris, I had heard of the Caf6 du Dome. That was where all the American art students gathered and although MacCarten heartily disliked the place, he took me there. At the Dome, one was cer tain to meet artists, poets, derelicts and other kindred spirits. It was open till two in the morning and you could go there for girls, chess, poker, billiards or conversation. I soon became a habitue. Another cafe I frequented was Lavenue's. It was an annex to a very chic and expensive restaurant which I did not sample until many years later. In the cafe section you could sit over an aperitif, beer or cafe creme, and listen to the strains of a string quartet, and their violinist Schumacher would play your favorite piece on request. You could call for \"de quoi ecrire\" and the waiter would bring you a folder with paper and a pen and ink to write your letter. You could spend an hour or two over the one drink and the waiter would never come near you unless you called him. You usually got into conversation with the person sitting next to you. I was barely installed in my studio in the rue Belloni when Samuel Halpert brought over a friend of his, a painter from Chicago, Jerome Blum. I was then working on a little figure which I called \"Toil \" It was 36 An East-Sider on the Left Bank a nude, a study of a man. trying to get a huge rock out of the ground. I was using a packing case for a stand, as I still lacked proper modeling stands. I kept on working as Jerry Blum talked. He was telling about some adventure he had had in Paris, and when he got through he bid me an abrupt good-bye and left. Sammy explained to me that Jerry's people were well-to-do and that he was giving him some pointers on painting. I didn't see Jerry again till a few weeks later, when one morning, about five A.M., there was a banging at my door. I was asleep on the balcony. I descended quickly to see what the trouble was, and there stood Jerry. \"Have you got a hammer? I've rented a studio upstairs and I want to hang some curtains.\" I was startled, being half asleep. I gave him the hammer and went back to bed. It wasn't very long before there was another banging on the door. It was Jerry again. \"Look, have you got a ladder? Can you come up and help me hang some draperies?\" That was how he and I became friends. The fifteen francs I made giving English lessons was rather meager and I proposed to Jerry that I cook for both of us and that we share the expenses. Jerry agreed with the idea. At about this time, he got the grippe and the doctor suggested that since he needed rest, I should bring him to my studio. The doctor prescribed chicken broth and a little glass of port. I brought back some chicken giblets, gizzards, head and neck, leeks, turnips and soup greens from the market, piled the ensemble into a big earthen pot, stuck it on the stove and we prepared for a feast. Jerry sat, wrapped up in blankets in front of the stove and as the won derful aroma of the heavenly chicken broth permeated the studio, his impatience grew in measure with his appetite. When I lifted the lid off , the fragrance was almost irresistible and Jerry began to proclaim his ap petite in no uncertain terms. While he irritably yelled for me to hurry, I decided that my concoction was ready at last and told him to hold his horses while I tasted it. The shock I received is indescribable. It was hot, but that was not the reason I spat it out. I had omitted to remove the 37 Between Sittings gall from the chicken liver. Everything is relative of course, but this was certainly a tragic moment for us and I could only remain silent under the torrent of abuse that poured from Jerry's lips. I hastily ran down to the butcher for six sous' worth of beef bouillon and this we hungrily devoured, still smelling the heavenly odors of the inedible chicken broth. One night, Jerry and I had been playing poker at the Dome and as we walked out, we saw a Great Dane lying on a bench of the terrace of the cafe. Andre, the waiter, told us the dog was lost. Jerry attempted to feed him a piece of sugar and just got a snarl in return. It occurred to me that the dog was hungry and I asked Andre to bring him a bowl of milk and bread. Food is a common language and the dog recognized a kindred spirit. When we started for home, Sultan for that is what I had immediately named him came along. Sultan filled the gap of my loneliness in more ways than one: he was the greatest introducer in the world. It was due to his playfulness that I met Harry McColl who in turn introduced me to Johnny Fergusson, who was to play an important part in my life during this period. Johnny, too, had been a medical student (in Edinburgh) and had chucked it for painting. He was older than I and was chef cCecole of a group in Paris who called themselves Post-Impressionists. I worked all day in my studio and would meet Fergusson after din ner. He and I did a lot of walking and talking. We often went to the Closerie des Lilas which was the rendezvous of the literati of the day and in which Jean Moreas, known as the Prince des poetes, presided. Sultan was always with us. Often Johnny would take me home and then I would take him home and we would continue to do this until the wee hours of the morning. We usually ended up in his studio for breakfast, tea and bread and butter, all the time talking about the most important subject in the world ART. My sister Rachie was always my most enthusiastic supporter. As we kept up a lively correspondence, she knew all about my ups and my downs. Rachie had heard of a scholarship fund which Dr. Felix Adler had set up and she got her friend, Isabelle Eaton, to see if she could do 38 An East-Sider on the Left Bank something about getting me a grant. After much palaver, she succeeded in getting the Hallgarten Scholarship Fund to allot me the sum of thirty dollars every month for one year. Overnight I was rich, I could aff ord models, I could work. I had finished a figure of a boy and decided to send it to the Salle National des Beaux Arts. I thought the figure, which I called \"Youth,\" pretty good and when it was refused at the Salon, I couldn't understand why. The Salon opened its doors and I went to see for myself. There were some very good pieces of sculpture but the mass of it was no better than my rejected figure. In fact, some of it, I thought, had no right to be there at all. I got to thinking that perhaps this art business was like every thing else. At this point I seriously considered chucking everything and going back to continue my medical studies in America. 39 CHAPTER 7 THE OPEN ROAD THE MEDICAL PROFESSION was destined to do without me. About this time I met the man who was to be my future brother-in-law, a French painter, Louis de Kerstrat. I told him that I was going to go home and he eloquently deplored that, having come so far, I had not seen Switzerland and Italy. We began to discuss a walking trip and as we talked, a plan took shape. When we met again, we were armed with maps. The other members of our party were an American journalist named Burlingham, and his girl, Leontine. They wanted to start immediately, but I was slow on the uptake and when I did make up my mind, they had already left. I knew the route that we had mapped out and one morning, with a knapsack on my back containing a sketchbook and Whitman's Leaves of Grass, I left Paris with my dog Sultan trailing behind me. The wonderful part of walking by oneself with a dog was the sense of being part of the road, of being alone with one's thoughts and trying to get some order into them. I found I dismissed thoughts that disturbed me. I played a game of pulling my thoughts back and making myself follow them through to the end. It was a mental exercise which I got to enjoy and it was extraordinary how much distance I covered playing that game. I would stop by the wayside for a bite and keep going until nightfall. 40 The Open Road Then I would choose a cafe that would let me have lodging for the night. Up at dawn the next morning, I was soon on the road for I wanted to catch up with my friends. One day I was trekking along and it began to drizzle. It was getting on to dusk. A fellow driving a cart offered me a lift. He asked me where I came from and where I was going. I told him from Paris and that I was on my way to Lucerne. \"To a job?\" I said yes, I asked him where I could get cheap lodgings. He looked surprised. \"Don't you know the law of the land? A traveler on foot looking for work is entitled to one night's lodging, supper and breakfast. The next village is Chafois. You go and see the mayor. I will show you where he lives. He will assign you to a farmer who will give you lodgings for the night, supper and breakfast.\" I thanked him and found my way to the mayor's house. The mayor was just coming in from the field and was putting up his horses. He ushered me into his parlor. I explained what I wanted. He took out a book, looked down a list of names, took a piece of paper and wrote out in ink, \"Bon pour une nuit chez Charles Nicolas,\" signed, le Maire de Chafois. He stamped it officially and told me where I could find M. Nicolas. When I found the place, it was deserted. I was tired, so I sat down on the bench by the door and took my knapsack off my back. Sultan flopped down beside me and went to sleep. We had gone fifty kilometers that day. A wizened little old lady came along and asked me what I wanted. I gave her the paper, but she couldn't read it. I read it to her. She grunted and walked into the house. I followed her. She asked whether I had any bread. I had none. She told me where I could buy some. When I came back, the table was set for three. She took my bread, cut a couple of slices, put them into a soup plate, put a chunk of lard on top of them, poured hot water over all, added a little pepper and salt, and told me to go ahead. She then went to a cupboard, pulled out a big loaf of bread, and went through the same process for herself and her 41 Between Sittings husband, who had just returned. They got out a bottle of wine, and this was our supper. We had a silent meal. I was not a welcome guest. It was late. I was tired and could think of nothing but sleep. Madame Nicolas asked me if I had any matches. I turned them over to her, also my knapsack. She motioned me to follow her, opened the door to a barn and told me to climb the ladder into the hayloft. Sultan could not follow, so he slept at the foot of the ladder while I slept in the hay above. When I woke up, the sun was shining. I went downstairs. Sultan was already outside, and when I went into the living room I found a large bowl of cafe au lait with the rest of my bread on the table, and nobody around, for they had all gone to the field. No breakfast ever tasted better. I finally caught up with Burlingham, Leontine and Louis at Dole. They had been dawdling on the road, and all of us proceeded together to Pontarlier. We must have been a curious sight. I had a black beard, Louis a blond Christ-like beard and Burlingham had a long ginger one. We all wore sandals. We crossed the border into Switzerland. Burlingham and Leontine decided to get some quarters in a pension, and Louis and I went on alone to Neuchatel. We tried to get into a hotel as night was coming on, but we could find no lodgings at our price. There was nothing to do but sleep out-of-doors. Louis, Sultan and I found ourselves a small hollow by the roadside where we intended to spend the night. We had just dozed off when Sultan awakened us with his barking. I tried to quiet him, but found that he was barking at a policeman, who took us into custody. There is a law in Switzerland against sleeping out-of-doors it goes under the name of vagabondage. And so we were taken to the local jail and locked up for the night. Louis, Sultan and I. All our papers and be longings were taken away. We were so tired we did not care and it didn't take long before we were asleep again. Next morning we were awakened by the jailer, who handed us brooms and told us to sweep out our cell. He watched us do our job, during which I had to keep Sultan from devouring him. Then we were led back to our cell and locked in. We sat on the bedstands, looked at each other, 42 The Open Road and decided we could do with a little more sleep. We were awakened again by the jailer as he pushed open the slot in the cell door. \"Here's your breakfast,\" he said. Breakfast was three pots of very hot soup one for Louis, one for Sultan and one for me and the soup consisted of a piece of lard and a piece of bread floating in hot salted water. We were young and hungry and we not only ate it but almost got to thinking it was good. Then the door opened and our jailer came in and told us to follow him. We were willing, but Sultan wanted to finish his soup. It was too hot for him to gulp down, so the three of us and the jailer and soup which I was carry ing carefully paraded into the presence of the uniformed officer in charge. The officer looked at us sternly but I had a hard time keeping from laughing, for he had a handkerchief tied around his face with a knot on top of the head, the ends of which looked like rabbit's ears. He appar ently was suffering from mumps. When the officer cross-examined us, Louis explained that we were artists he a painter and I a sculptor and that we were on our way to Italy. Grimly he said: \"You are trying to do a bit of the vie de bohemel\" Then he warned us: \"If we find you in this town again it will not be one night but thirty days of jail.\" The question was, what to do next? I had written to my friend Lester Rosenfield, a painter in Paris, asking for a loan and giving my address: General Post Office at Neuchatel. I knew he would come through. He always did. After leaving the jail and Neuchatel, Louis and I walked into a cafe- restaurant to get ourselves a more substantial meal than we had had at the jail. It was then that Louis decided that he would join up with the Burlinghams and leave me on my own. I had become acquainted with the proprietor. I made a sketch of his little girl, and told him that I must find a job. He not only told me how to go about it, but also offered me a room to sleep in while I was hunting for a job. My first try was at a stonecutter's a fellow who made gravestones. Business was slow. He did not need any help. The next essay was a 43 Between Sittings photographer, to retouch some photographic plates. Nothing there. My last resort was Suchard's chocolate factory. I saw the manager. He was a nice guy; he tried in every department. No luck. Twice, every day, I walked to the General Post Office at Neuchatel to inquire for the letter. It wasn't there. Finally, in despair, I wrote my name on a piece of paper. I had given my name as Davidson but on the paper I instinctively wrote Jo Davidson, and pushed it over to the postal clerk. There was nothing under the \"D's.\" He had seen me so often he had got to know me. He looked under the \"J's\" and, with a grin, pulled out a letter and handed it to me. I opened the letter, and there, neatly folded, was a brand-new fifty-franc note. With money in my pocket I was able to leave Neuchatel. Alone with my dog and my thoughts, I proceeded to Berne and over the Brunig Pass. When I got to Interlaken I saw across Lake Brienz, on a hillside, a sign reading \"Pension de -famille View of the Jungfrau.\" I walked around the lake and got to Goldsville and found the pension, a typical Swiss chalet. The proprietor, a heavy-set, black-bearded man, showed me around very cordially and suggested a room overlooking Lake Brienz and facing the Jungfrau. The price was five francs a day includ ing meals. I found that most agreeable except for the fact that my money was low. However, I was expecting some money in a week or so. \"Oh,\" he said, \"under the circumstances I don't think you can stay here.\" I argued with him, saying, \"I did not have to tell you this now.\" He conceded there was something in that and asked me what my busi ness was. I told him I was an artist. \"Can you draw?\" he said. \"Of course,\" I replied. \"Well, if you are an artist, you can draw a picture of my pension with the Jungfrau in the background. For that, I will give you a week's board and room.\" Unfortunately, when you looked at the pension from the road at any angle it completely obliterated the Jungfrau. However, in my drawing I pushed the Jungfrau a little to the right and the house slightly to the 44 The Open Road left. My host was delighted with the result and used it for picture post cards to advertise his place. After a week of loafing, sleeping, eating delicious breakfasts and really seeing the Jungfrau from my balcony, I proceeded on my way. I walked as far as Lucerne and after a day or two there I felt I had had enough. My mind was in order, but I was not too happy about where my think ing took me, for it convinced me that I did not have what it took to be an artist. Again I came to the conclusion that there was only one thing to do return to Paris and sail for home. 45 CHAPTER 8 THE SWISS GIRL BACK IN PARIS AGAIN I went to see Johnny Fer- gusson and told him of my decision to return home. We argued for and against, and he finally admitted I had valid reasons; but he suggested I do a bust of him before leaving and offered to sit for me in my studio. Johnny had a head for sculpture, a fine aquiline nose and a tightly- drawn skin. He looked all of the Scottish chieftain. I worked intensely for two hours. Johnny insisted we stop and go to Lavenue's for a drink. Once there he was eloquent on what a swell job I had done. \"You must not touch this,\" he said, and he argued with me to cast it as it was. I went to bed that night in a happier mood. Perhaps I was an artist after all. I brought my pals in to see the bust, inducing some of them to sit for me. For the first time I was modeling a head in one sitting. I went on an orgy of bust-making. One day while playing billiards at the Cafe du Dome with John Marin, the famous painter, I induced him, after an*absinthe or two, to sit for me. On the way to the studio we bought a loaf of bread, some cheese and a bottle of wine. We were both half -seas over when I started to work. I stuck my hands in the clay bin. The clay was soft and gooey but nothing could stop me. I don't know how long we worked or when we left the studio, and I don't remember when I returned, but when I woke The Swiss Girl up the next morning there was the bust of John Marin in clay. Curiously enough, the resemblance was still there when I last saw him in 1948. At that time, all Paris was talking about the exhibition of the Salon des Artistes Independants, which was being held in tents in the Tuileries gardens. Johnny and I went to have a look at it. What we saw was revo lutionary. The exhibitors had overthrown all codes and all canons and no longer had any pope. They painted as they pleased. To say what one liked as one liked was the new trend whether in harmony, in discord, nobody cared. The effect on the people who crowded to see that exhibition was extraordinary crowds of people, some laughing, some jeering, others gaping with blank expressions. As we followed the crowds from gallery to gallery, we spotted an elderly man with white sideburns. He was dressed in a Prince Albert coat and silk hat and carried a gold-topped cane. He was furious. He took the exhibition as a personal insult and kept muttering, \"Les salauds! Les cochons! 11 faut les tuerJ\" (The dirty dogs! The pigs! They ought to be shot!) I was fascinated. I had never realized that pictures could arouse such passion in a human being. How different were the crowds at the Louvre or the Luxembourg. There they walked through the galleries silently, respectfully. Here they reacted violently. It was no longer a question of good or bad art it was art of today. It did not matter whether I liked it or not, but I came away with an exhilarating sense of freedom. I gave up all idea of going home. In the cafes where the artists met there were great argu ments. They divided into groups and called themselves Fauves and Post- Impressionists. I wandered from cafe to cafe where they met. I enjoyed them all. I no longer questioned. I just went on working. Painters and sculptors worked in the daytime, but Ruffy, my Irish poet friend, had all the time in the world and spent most of it in my studio. His exceptional wit and the way he could turn a phrase were always a delight. One night Ruffy and I were walking along the BouT Mich'. Sultan, of course, was with us. As we approached the Cafe d'Harcourt two girls ran out, chased by a couple of Frenchmen. The girls seemed to be in distress, and we two gallants walked off with them, 47 Between Sittings much to the consternation of their pursuers. We walked about a block; the girls were effusive in their thanks. We stood under the street lamp and I looked at my girl. She was titian-haired and charming. I told her I was a sculptor and asked her to pose for me. I gave her my card with my address and she promised to be there the next afternoon. The following day I waited. She never turned up. I was disappointed. Those were gloomy days, for I was broke. Everything I touched seemed to go wrong. Even my work had gone stale. What to do to change my luck? I decided to shave my beard. Some two weeks later I was sitting in the Cafe d'Harcourt with my friends, and across the way at the far end of the cafe I spotted the girl who had never turned up. But I was through. I paid no attention to her. A few moments later I saw her coming towards our table. She looked at me rather doubtfully, recognized Sultan \"But are you \" \"Yes,\" said I. She gave me a rueful smile and said, \"I know you won't believe me. I lost your card and I have been looking for you here.\" \"Oh, that's all right. I'll give you another.\" She sat next to me crestfallen. \"The trouble is, I've overstayed my leave. My funds have given out and this is my last night at the hotel.\" \"That's all right,\" said I, \"you can stay with me.\" I gave her my address. She left me with a gay, \"A demain\" but I was a cynic. I did not believe her. The next day the painter Alfie Maurer was in my studio, and when I told him my story he said, \" I know these girls, I have made dates with dozens of them and they never turn up.\" Just then there was a knock at my door. I opened it and there she was. \"My trunk is outside,\" said she brightly. At that Alfie bolted. I went to the concierge and told him to pay the cabbie and bring the trunk in. He did and the girl and I sat on the trunk and laughed. I invited her to take off her hat and coat and make herself comfortable. She told me about herself. She was Swiss and was return ing from London, where she had been governess to the children of a The Swiss Girl well-known English sculptor. She was on her way to visit her mother in Switzerland but had spent all her money in Paris and all she had left was her ticket to Switzerland. That day she posed for me and I made a portrait of her. I confessed that I was stone-broke. She understood, said she had a dinner date that evening and we arranged to meet later that night, at the Cafe d'Harcourt. I was intoxicated with the head I had made of her and when she left I went looking for Fergusson to tell him about it. Sultan and I found Fergusson at Lavenue's and he stood me a drink. As we were sitting there celebrating my friend McAdams, the sculptor, came in, accom panied by a tall, handsome lady wearing a large hat and pearls. Both Fergusson and I remarked on her striking appearance. I suddenly missed Sultan. I went out to look for him. He was nowhere to be seen. When I returned I found McAdams feeding Sultan quantities of sugar. That always annoyed me. I called Sultan and was about to pass by McAdams' table when he stopped me. \"Jo, I want you to meet Mrs. Harry Payne Whitney.\" Mrs. Whitney seconded him with a cordial, \"Oh, do sit down, I have heard so much about you from our mutual friend John Gregory.\" Mrs. Whitney told me that she too was a sculptor and asked me what I was working on. I told her I had just completed a wonderful bust of a girl. She said she must see it. She was extraordinary, how she gave one the feeling that what you did was the only thing that mattered. She spoke warmly of John Gregory. I, who shared her enthusiasm, quoted a poem he had written. Mrs. Whitney quoted Alfred de Musset, I quoted Heine. Our party had become gay, but it was getting late and we were about to break up, when someone suggested supper in Montmarte. That sounded good to me, and, leaving my dog at the studio, we proceeded to Monico's, Place Pigalle. We were no sooner seated when there in the doorway was my girl and her friends. I motioned to her to meet me in the dressing room, where I gave her the keys to my studio and told her I would see her later. I returned to my table and my friends began to tease me, asking who the beautiful girl was. I tried to change the subject, but as the night 49 Between Sittings wore on and the food and drink began to enliven our spirits, they had but one idea. They wanted to go back to my studio to see the bust I had been boasting about. I wouldn't have it. Our party finally broke up and Mrs. Whitney promised to come to my studio the next afternoon. It was almost daybreak when I got home. The girl was asleep up in the balcony, but I decided to cast the bust right then and there, and when I finished I got the concierge to come in and clean the studio. The floor was still wet after a fresh scrubbing when Mrs. Whitney came in. She saw the bust, recognized the girl, and said, \"I must have it.\" This was good fortune. I had sold my first piece of sculpture in Paris. When I told the girl about it, we celebrated, and she told everyone she was my mastiff, meaning my mascot. Perhaps shaving my beard had something to do with it, but I soon let it grow again. 5 CHAPTER 9 YVONNE THE GIRL wanted to play, I wanted to work, and when she left for Switzerland I was glad to be free again and go back to my usual routine. When I found a note in my studio from a journalist friend, Arthur Bullard, inviting me to join him for lunch to meet two girls, one French, an actress and beautiful, the other American and rich, it did not tempt me at all. I ignored the invitation. About two months later I ran into Louis de Kerstrat in uniform. He was doing his military service and was on a day's leave. He asked me to join him at Lavenue's for an aperitif to meet his sister Yvonne, who was in Paris on a visit. I had seen a photograph of her in Louis' studio. He had told me a lot about her, and I wanted very much to meet her. When I got to Lavenue's, I looked around for Louis, but did not see him. However, I spotted a young lady who was sitting by herself, whom I recognized at once as Yvonne. I introduced myself, and she invited me to join her. \"Why didn't you come to the lunch that Arthur Bullard invited you to?\" So she was the actress he referred to! She knew a lot about me. She had heard about my doing busts in one sitting and did not think much of the idea. I took it all, and would have taken more. I just sat and feasted my eyes upon her. She was beau- 51 Between Sittings tiful. Louis came in. I had not noticed how absurd he looked in his hand- me-down uniform. The sleeves of his overcoat were too short, his beard too long, and his peaked red cap just a little too small. As he approached our table, we both burst out laughing. He could not stay long he had to get back to barracks. I asked Yvonne to dine with me. She couldn't. She was dining with her friend Florence Rauh, whom she wanted me to know, and asked me to join them for coffee after dinner. I did and brought my friend Hal Ruffy. Later other friends joined us. I was fascinated with Yvonne and thought to myself, why hadn't Arthur Bullard mentioned in his note that the name of the beautiful French girl was Yvonne de Kerstrat? I would have known her two months earlier. I was so anxious to see more of her that I urged her to sit for me, and after much pleading, she agreed. Time was short, for she and Florence were sailing at the end of the week. The next day I called for her and took her to my studio. This was not to be a quickie. It was an excuse to have her with me as long as possible. During the sitting I remember she told me the following story. E. S. Willard, the great English actor, was in Chicago on an American tour. She dreamed that she had written to him and that he had answered her, asking her to call on him at his hotel. When she knocked at the door, he opened it himself and invited her to sit down. He then asked her to take off her hat. With that she awoke. The dream was so real she sat right down and wrote a letter to Willard asking him for an interview. The next day she received a reply, inviting her to call. When she knocked at his door, he himself let her in and asked her to sit down. When he asked her to take off her hat, she almost fainted. He signed her up on the spot for a year. She played with Wil lard under the stage name of Philippa Wharton. Yvonne was sailing on Saturday noon. We had to have a party. After dinner I insisted that we go for a drive. We got hold of a taxi they were rare in those days. We first went to the studio, Yvonne, Florence Rauh, Hal Ruffy and I, to have a last look at the bust. We then started out for Versailles, stopping at places on the way. Ruffy got fairly tight 5 2 Yvonne and insisted on riding on top of the cab. Nothing would do but that we get hold of Louis, and off we went in search of him. Suddenly we were there the highest walls you can imagine in front of us. We realized how hopeless it was, and started back. At Ville d'Avray we stopped at a small bistro and woke up the pro prietor, who served us an early breakfast. By the time we got back to Paris it was five in the morning. I dropped the girls off at Lavenue's to pack, went back to my studio to wash up, bought some flowers, and went back to Yvonne's hotel for a last try. I had been begging her to stay on, but it was hopeless. She argued that she had a job with the Shuberts to go back to, and that I was an artist. I should stick to my work and she should stick to hers. And so she sailed and I remained be hind, in love and unconvinced. A hectic correspondence followed. I was disconsolate. Work was a solution. I got models and worked in my studio all day. I did a statue of Mephisto. At night I would go from cafe to cafe, ending up in Mont- marte, where I got to be known as \"the man with the dog.\" My reputation for doing busts in one sitting grew. Mrs. Whitney was again in Paris and she brought her little daughter Flora to my studio and left her there for me to sculp. She was a very silent little girl and appeared to be frightened of my dog Sultan he was far too big. I did my best to entertain her as I worked on her bust. Towards the end of the afternoon Mr. and Mrs. Whitney came for her. She certainly was glad to see them and they were delighted with the bust, except for one criticism. Mr. Whitney thought her nose was too big, but there was nothing to be done about it. This was a bust done in one sitting, and the sitting was over. Years later I asked Flora if she remembered sitting for me. She did, and I recalled how frightened she was of my dog. \"Oh no,\" she said. \"It wasn't the dog. It was you and your black beard.\" When Louis de Kerstrat finished his military service, we decided to take a studio together with living quarters. We found what we wanted at 39 rue Delambre. This was a large studio on the ground floor with 53 Between Sittings stairs leading up to an apartment, and it had a real kitchen. Louis did some painting and all the cooking. I had the studio to myself most of the day. During this time I had a visit from a strange man, who said he would like to ask me some questions. As he entered the studio he began: \"You used to live in the rue Belloni? You had a long black beard? You were hard up you went off on a trip you came back you shaved your beard you had money you moved you are a habitue of Montmartre \" I listened no further. I lost my temper and put him out of my studio. I went to the Dome and told my friends what had happened. They wanted to know who he was and why he asked all those questions. I didn't know, but the following day I found out. The story appeared in the Matin, a morning newspaper. Apparently on the night preceding the morning on which I left on my walking trip, there had been a murder in the Impasse Ronsin. A mural painter by the name of SteinheU had been murdered, and Mme. Steinheil said it was done by three curious-looking men. She pointed me out as one of the three, referring to me as \"Phomme aux yeux effrayants\" the man with the terrible eyes. The newspaper story told how I had shaved my beard, how I had moved, how I was broke and then suddenly I was seen spend ing money in Montmartre. I was flabbergasted. I had never heard of M. or Mme. Steinheil. I went to see the American consul, and he recommended me to a lawyer, Donald Harper, who wrote a letter to the Matin threatening a libel suit. However, the damage was done and I was pointed out in my quarter as \"Phomme aux yeux eff ray ants\" Mme. Steinheil herself was tried for the murder. The case dragged on and on. She kept on accusing people, including her valet de chambre. The trial was long and strenuous. Mme. Steinheil was eventually acquitted and went to England, where she married a lord. Shortly after, an article appeared in La Liberte entitled \"U esthete aux pieds nus\" (the barefooted esthete), suggesting that the least Mme. Steinheil could d'o for the sculptor Davidson, after causing him all that misery, was to get her 54 Photo Kollar, Paris Photo Kollar, Paris JOHN MARIN JO DAVIDSON'S MOTHER RABINDRANATH TAGORE FRANK HARRIS Photo Kollar.

This was a fine idea, but nothing came of it. One day two girl friends of Yvonne, Blanche and Ida Rauh, arrived in Paris. Yvonne had written Louis and me to look after them. We did, and it\" was not long before Louis and Blanche fell in love and married. I was left alone in my studio with Sultan. One day I received a letter from Yvonne. She had chucked her job and was sailing for France. My friend Ethel Chase, an etcher whom I had known in New York in my League days, was staying at the Hotel des Ecojes, which was on the same street as my studio. I asked her to get rooms for Yvonne and im patiently awaited Yvonne's arrival. Yvonne's return to Paris called for a celebration. She had heard much of Montmartre but had never been there. I suggested that we both dress up and make a night of it. Not having a dinner jacket of my own, I bor rowed one from Jerry Blum. I called for Yvonne at her hotel. When she appeared, I didn't know her. She had brought with her a trunk full of. theatrical clothes, and she had put on one of the evening gowns and a huge picture hat; she had made up her face to match. We went to dinner and theatre and finally landed at Monico's, where I was known as the man with the dog. We were greeted by the head- waiter and were escorted to a ringside table, from which we could watch the performance. When the dancing began, some of the girls hailed me as they passed us. Yvonne suggested that I invite them for a drink. That called for more champagne. They questioned her: \"Where have you been? We have not seen you before?\" \"I have just come back from America,\" said Yvonne. \"How is business over there?\" they queried. \"Not so good,\" said Yvonne. They had taken her for one of them, and she played up to them. They warned her that I was bluffing that I was an artist and had no money, but that I"
