        "text": "Fenster, Hersh; Marc Chagall (foreword); Arthur Kolnik (design)\n\nParis: H. Fenster, 1951. Limited first edition. Hardcover. 1/375. Small folio. 262pp. [2]. Tan cloth boards gilt decorations and text on the front cover and spine. One of a limited number of 375 copies hand-numbered on the colophon. This is copy is out of series.\n\nThis historically important work is a survey of Jewish artists based in Paris who perished during the Holocaust, and the period of the German occupation of France. The work contains a total of 84 artist biographies, often including photographic portraits, examples of their work, and/or reproductions of original documents, in b/w. Most of the artists mentioned were originally Eastern European Jews, who had come to Paris in the early decades of the 20th century to study and/or pursue their artistic careers, as part of the so-called \"School of Paris\" (École de Paris). Tragically the lives of these artists were cut short, in many cases before they had a chance to cultivate international recognition. Includes sections on acclaimed artists such as Chaim Soutine (1893-1943), Jacob Macznik (1905-1945), Samuel Granowsky (1889-1942), Ary Lochakow (1892-1941), Adolphe Féder (1886-1943), Otto Freundlich (1878-1943), Georges Kars (1880-1945), Chana Kowalska (1899-1942), Rahel Szalit-Marcus (1888-1942), and Naoum Aronson (1872-1943). Includes a foreword by Marc Chagall. The title page and dedication page are illustrated with designs by Arthur Kolnik (1890-1972). Table of contents at the rear.\n\nText in Yiddish.\n\nA few tiny chips to the head and tail of spine. Spine lightly sunned. Back cover with a small light stain along the top edge. Interior with minor sunned to the edges of pages, and a very few spoardic instances of minor smudges in the margins. Pages overall quite clean throughout. Binding and interior in very good+ condition overall. vg+. Item #51125\n\nYiddish title: אונדזערע פארפייניקטע קינסטלער\n\nAuthor: פענסטער, הערש; שאגאל, מארק\n\nPublication: פאריז, פענסטער, תשי\"א."
