        "text": "100: Intra-arterial Encephalography from Acutely Implanted Aneurysm Embolization (WEB) Device in Awake Humans\n\nAnthony Piscopo BS (Clear Lake, Iowa) Luyuan Li, MD – Resident Physician, Neurosurgery, University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics; Kenji Ibayashi, MD, PhD; Jeremy Greenlee, MD – Neurosurgery – University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics; David Hasan, MD – Neurosurgery – University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics\n\nIntroduction\n\nEndovascular electroencephalography (evEEG) utilizes the cerebrovascular system as a minimally-invasive conduit to record electrical activity from adjacent neural structures, mitigating the poor spatial resolution and risks of open craniotomy associated with extracranial EEG and electrocorticography, respectively. The safety, feasibility, and efficacy using the Woven Endobridge (WEB) intracranial aneurysm embolization device for evEEG has yet to be investigated in humans.\n\nMethods\n\nFifteen patients undergoing awake endovascular treatment of unruptured cerebral aneurysms via WEB device were included. The WEB Device, composed of nitinol with a platinum core, served as a single-electrode intravascular contact by connecting its distal deployment wire to an EEG receiver. After deployment into the aneurysm and before detachment during awake surgery, subjects were presented with a value-based decision-making task for 10 minutes while endovascular WEB recordings were captured and referenced with scalp electrodes. All recordings were completed within the standard 10-minute monitoring period to ensure stable WEB positioning, stagnation of contrast inside the aneurysm sac, and adequate flow through the afferent and efferent arteries. Therefore, OR time was not extended for research participation nor was any additional surgical risk introduced to the participants.\n\nResults\n\nAll patients underwent successful embolization and evEEG recording with no complications. Event-related potentials (ERP) were detected on scalp EEG in 6/15 (40%) patients. Of these 6 patients, low-gamma (30-70Hz) response on WEB channels was captured in 4/6 (75%) cases. In these 4 patients, the WEB device was deployed into the anterior communicating artery, basilar tip, and two middle cerebral artery aneurysms. EKG artifact on WEB channels was present in 11/15 cases.\n\nConclusion\n\nPlacement of an implantable WEB device within the cerebral aneurysms of awake subjects is capable of capturing task-specific electrical brain activities. Future studies are warranted to further establish safety, efficacy, and support for evEEG as a potential tool for neural recording, deep brain stimulation, and brain-machine-interface.\n\n101: Neuroprotective Effect of Steroid Receptor Coactivator Stimulator (MCB-613) in a Murine Ischemic Stroke Model\n\nTyler T. Lazaro MD (Houston, Texas) Roberto Garcia, MD; Aarti Rohira, PhD; Bert O’Malley, MD; Peter Kan, MD, MPH\n\nIntroduction\n\nStroke is the leading cause of disability and death worldwide. Currently, thrombolysis and thrombectomy are the gold standard for acute interventions; however, these strategies have a limited treatment window and effect. Neuroprotection in stroke is a strategy to reduce neurologic injury secondary to ischemia and extend the window of salvageable brain. On potential candidate is MCB-613, a small molecule stimulator of steroid receptor coactivators that is implicated in cellular regeneration, immune cell modulation, and angiogenesis, that is being newly studied in tissue repair after injury.\n\nMethods\n\nWe conducted a middle artery occlusion model in 20 rats, randomly assigned to intraperitoneal injection with MCB-613 or vehicle after 30 minutes following reperfusion. After 24 hours, rats were scored for behavior using the Bederson score. Afterwards, they were immediately perfused, and brains were removed and cut. The brain slices were then fixed and stained with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride to visualize infarction volume. Immunohistochemical analysis was also done to look at the extent of neuronal apoptosis and immune cell infiltration.\n\nResults\n\nThe MCB-613 group showed a 50% reduction in infarct volume, compared with the vehicle only group (0.5 vs 0.21, p = 0.001). In addition, behavior scores were significantly improved in the treatment group (Bederson score 3.8 versus 1.8, p = 0.01). On close examination of the penumbra, neuronal apoptosis was decreased in the treatment group, as were microglia and neutrophil infiltration.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the early experiments using a rat MCAO model, MCB-613 has shown to reduce infarct volume by 50% and persevere neurologic function 24 hours after stroke and reperfusion. This process seems to be mediated by a decrease in neuronal apoptosis in the penumbra and decreased immune cell infiltration. Further studies are currently underway to study the treatment effect over a longer period of time and further delineate a molecular mechanism with whole transcriptome analysis.\n\n102: Analysis of Spinal Canal Diameter in the Placement of Thoracic Spinal Cord Stimulator (SCS) Paddle Leads\n\nTressa Riedman BS (Vancouver, Washington) Brian Ragel, MD, FAANS – Neurosurgery – Rebound Orthopedics and Neurosurgery; Matthew McGehee, MD – Physiatry – Rebound Orthopedics and Neurosurgery; Ahmed Raslan, MD, FAANS – Professor, Neurosurgery, OHSU\n\nIntroduction\n\nNeurologic deficit is a rare complication of thoracic spinal cord stimulator (SCS) paddle lead implantation. Interestingly, multiple authors believe the incidence of neurologic complications after SCS paddle lead placement is under-reported. This study looked at imaging characteristics to help predict safe paddle lead placement.\n\nMethods\n\nPatients undergoing thoracic laminectomy for new SCS paddle lead placement were identified from January 2018 to October 2021. Preoperative thoracic canal diameter was measured in the sagittal plane perpendicular to the disc space from T5/6 to T11/12. These thoracic levels were chosen because they span the most common levels targeted for SCS placement. Comparison of patients with and without new neurologic deficit was performed using an unpaired Student’s t-test (Prism 9, GraphPad Software).\n\nResults\n\nOne-hundred and seven of 112 patients initially identified had thoracic imaging available for review. Two of 112 (2%) patients complained of transient neurologic deficit after thoracic SCS placement. Both patients had SCS paddle lead placement at T8/9 and single-level laminectomy for placement and average canal diameter <12 mm. The average canal diameter of patients with and without neurologic deficit was 10.1 mm (range 6.1 – 12.3 mm) and 12.3 mm (range 6.9 – 19.0), respectively (P < 0.0001)\n\nConclusion\n\nPostoperative neurologic deficit is a rare complication after thoracic laminectomy for SCS paddle lead placement. The authors recommend ensuring a thoracic canal diameter of at least 12 mm to accommodate a SCS paddle lead measuring 2 mm thick. If canal diameter is <12 mm, aggressive undercutting of the lamina or a second laminectomy should be considered.\n\n103: Case Series: Postoperative Radiculopathy After Spinal Cord Stimulator Placement\n\nSamantha Parker MD (Houston, Texas) Allison Medina, BA; Christopher Conner, MD/PhD; Duncan Trimble, MD; Joseph Withrow, MD; Albert Fenoy, MD\n\nIntroduction\n\nSpinal cord stimulators (SCS) have been used to treat various refractory chronic pain conditions, such as complex regional pain syndrome and failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS). While SCS is effective in the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain, they are not without complications. We investigated the rate of post-operative radiculopathy of any kind following SCS placement in a series of 196 patients.\n\nMethods\n\nWe found 196 consecutive patients treated for chronic back pain or FBSS using SCS between 2013 and 2019. All patients underwent laminotomy and placement of paddle type SCS lead over the thoracic or cervical spinal cord. Patients who developed radiculopathy or other postoperative complications were identified with a retrospective chart review based on follow-up clinic notes.\n\nResults\n\nIn this case series, 167 patients reported improved chronic pain symptoms (88.8% improvement, eight patients lost to follow-up). The rate of post-op thoracic radiculopathy was 4.3% (8 patients out of 188). Of those patients, three required revision or removal of the SCS, 2 had gradual resolution of symptoms several weeks post-operatively with conservative medical management alone, and two were lost to follow-up.\n\nConclusion\n\nPostoperative radiculopathy is a rare but distressing complication following SCS implantation for refractory chronic back pain. While some patients require surgical correction to alleviate the radiculopathy, others can be managed medically until the radiculopathy resolves.\n\n104: Whole Exome Sequencing and Integrative Multi-omics Approach Identify Biological Mechanisms and Critical Spatiotemporal Points Related to Neurodevelopmental Symptoms of Craniosynostosis\n\nEmre Kiziltug B.S. (New Haven, Connecticut) Garrett Allington, M. Phil.; Andrew Timberlake, M.D., Ph.D.; Riki Kawaguchi, Ph.D.; Daniel Geschwind, M.D., Ph.D.; Kristopher Kahle, M.D., Ph.D.\n\nIntroduction\n\nCraniosynostosis (CS) is the most common cranial birth defect, occurring one in every 2,000 live births. Many children with CS experience neurocognitive deficits despite optimal surgical management. Recent advances in understanding the genetic causes of CS have identified risk genes and pathways, however the etiology of the neurodevelopmental delays seen in those with CS remains unclear.\n\nMethods\n\nWe analyzed whole exome sequencing data from 404 trios with non-syndromic craniosynostosis to identify additional novel causes of the condition, while concurrently using whole-brain transcriptomics to construct a spatiotemporal model of gene expression in the developing brain. Single-cell RNA-seq data from embryonic mouse meninges and developmental human whole-brain were used to identify cell populations significantly expressing CS genes.\n\nResults\n\nWe identify strong enrichment for genes mutated in craniosynostosis in the ganglionic eminence during mid-fetal development (post-conception weeks 8-21) affecting astrocytes, dura fibroblasts, oligodendrocytes and parvalbumin-positive inhibitory neurons. These genes are implicated in osteoblast differentiation, neural stem cell differentiation and epigenetic regulation, suggesting that the genetic mutations that cause craniosynostosis concurrently impact neurogenesis. Moreover, we find that CS-enriched gene co-expression modules and cell types are also enriched with autism and neurodevelopmental disorder genes. Formal neurodevelopmental assessment of 56 children with craniosynostosis with matched exome sequencing data show that damaging mutations in highly constrained genes correlate with poor neurodevelopmental outcomes, irrespective of the surgery performed to treat the patient.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis data suggests that neurodevelopmental outcomes in CS are largely intrinsic to the underlying mutations causing craniosynostosis, and are likely independent of the specific clinical management chosen.\n\n105: Is Cranial Ultrasound Prognostic Beyond the Papile Grade? A Volumetric Analysis of Germinal Matrix Hemorrhage-intraventricular Hemorrhage\n\nPeter H. Yang MD (St. Louis, Missouri) Kaamya Varagur, BA, MPhil; Hongjie Gu, MS; Dimitrios Alexopoulos, MS; Adam Bevan, MD, PhD; David Limbrick, MD, PhD; Christopher Smyser, MD; Jennifer Strahle, MD\n\nIntroduction\n\nHigh-grade (grade III/IV) germinal matrix hemorrhage-intraventricular hemorrhage (GMH-IVH) is associated with lifelong complications including hydrocephalus and poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. Early prognostic radiologic markers are unknown. We sought to determine whether volumetric measurements of hemorrhage and ventricular size on early cranial ultrasound (CUS) in high-grade GMH-IVH are associated with hydrocephalus and neurodevelopmental outcome at 2 years.\n\nMethods\n\nThis was a retrospective cohort study of prospectively recruited infants with grade III and/or IV GMH-IVH admitted to St. Louis Children’s Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit between 2007 and 2015. All patients underwent formal neurocognitive testing at 2 years corrected age using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd edition (Bayley-III). Patients with missing/incomplete Bayley-III scores or unviewable CUS images were excluded. A single physician blinded to outcome performed CUS measurements of GMH volume, periventricular hemorrhagic infarction (PVHI) volume, and fronto-temporal horn ratio.\n\nResults\n\n58 infants with high-grade GMH-IVH were identified on the existing database and 43 infants (14 females, mean 25.0 weeks estimated gestational age) met inclusion criteria. Highest grade GMH-IVH was noted, on average, on day of life 6.9. Larger left-sided GMH volumes were associated with worse Bayley-III composite cognition scores (p=0.0103) and the eventual need for shunt placement (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.27-5.33, p=0.0171) even after controlling for IVH volume. Larger left and right-sided PVHI volumes were associated with worse Bayley-III composite motor scores (p=0.0422 and p=0.0395, respectively).\n\nConclusion\n\nLarger left-sided GMH volume was associated with worse cognitive outcomes and need for shunt placement. Larger PVHI volume, regardless of laterality, was associated with poor motor outcomes. Location-specific hemorrhage volumes on postnatal CUS, particularly in progenitor-rich regions of the developing brain, may offer prognostic information in high-grade GMH-IVH with implications for cognitive outcome and hydrocephalus development.\n\n106: Resection of the Fusiform Gyrus Predicts Decline in Object Naming\n\nKathryn Snyder BE (Austin, Texas) Joshua Breier, PhD; Cristian Donos, PhD; Simon Fischer-Baum, PhD; Kiefer Forseth, MD/PhD; Patrick Rollo, BS; Nitin Tandon, MD\n\nIntroduction\n\nTemporal lobe resections often result in significant confrontation naming decline. However, the precise substrates responsible for these deficits are not known, and a clear understanding of the most critical constituents might influence surgical strategies to minimize language declines. We used multivariate voxel-based lesion symptom mapping (VLSM) to relate changes in language function, measured using the Boston Naming Test, to dominant temporal lobe resections.\n\nMethods\n\nData were obtained from 95 patients who underwent surgical resection in the dominant left temporal lobe for epilepsy. Patients underwent neuropsychological testing and MRI prior to and following surgery. Lesion masks were traced on postoperative MRIs and aligned to standard MNI space. The effects of preoperative scores were removed from postoperative scores via linear regression. VLSM was performed using multivariate support vector regression. A surface-based mixed-effects multilevel analysis (SB-MEMA) was used to estimate group-level broadband gamma activity during picture naming across a subset of patients with ECoG recordings, and results were integrated with VLSM.\n\nResults\n\nVLSM analysis revealed that loss of the posterior ventral temporal cortex was significantly associated with a decline on BNT. We also found that the posterior margin of ATL resections was linearly correlated to a decline in BNT performance with a clinically significant decline occurring once the resection extended 6 cm from the anterior tip of the temporal lobe. ECoG analysis showed a significant increase in activity in the middle fusiform gyrus (mFus) preceding articulation. The thresholded SB-MEMA map overlapped with 75% of the significant cluster from VLSM.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe importance of the ventral temporal cortex in lexical access is shown using multivariate VLSM and ECoG. While it was previously assumed that mFus lesions do not cause pervasive impairment, our data support the role of the mFus as a critical semantic access hub. Surgical approaches in temporal lobe epilepsy should strive to preserve the mFus.\n\n107: Epidural Stimulation Restores Muscle Synergies by Modulating Neural Drives in Complete Spinal Cord Injured Patients\n\nIsabela Pena Pino MD (Minneapolis, Minnesota) Rajat Singh, PhD – Department of Biomedical Engineering – University of Minnesota; Theoden Netoff, PhD – Professor, Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Minnesota; David Darrow, MD – Assistant Professor, Department of Neurosurgery, University of Minnesota\n\nIntroduction\n\nApproximately 50,000 people in the United States with spinal cord injury (SCI) are ASIA A. The ESTAND study has demonstrated restoration of volitional control with epidural spinal stimulation over time in this subset of patients. In the initial study, the amplitude of muscle movement improved in the first few weeks, but then decreased. In a nested study, we measured neuromuscular control during these changes from ballistic movements to more refined control, using muscle synergy and complexity analysis over time.\n\nMethods\n\nResults from six motor/sensory complete SCI participants and nine healthy control participants are reported. Surface EMG (sEMG) from 10 muscle groups bilaterally are recorded while subjects perform a set of tasks with and without stimulation. The analysis of complexity (Higuchi Fractal Dimensional analysis) is then performed on the sEMGs. The muscle synergies from sEMG are extracted using non-negative matrix factorization algorithm to measure changes in neuromuscular control. From the sEMG data, motor neuron activity is also estimated in the rostral-caudal plane of the spinal cord.\n\nResults\n\nThe resulting analysis shows that complexity of muscle activity is reduced in the SCI participants when SCS is turned on compared to when stimulation is off. Muscle synergy structure improved and the number of synergies decreased, indicating improved muscle coordination over time. By the final stimulation session, SCI participants on average were able to achieve the same number of muscle synergies observed in the control participants.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis study provides support for the origins of synergies being the neural hypothesis instead of the task based, whereby a patient can perform the same task while their neural control is modulated independently with SCS. Overall, this study shows that long term use of epidural stimulation generates neural plasticity in the spinal circuitry that leads to improved motor control as reflected via changes in muscle synergies.\n\n108: Quantifying the Need for Emergency Neurosurgical Intervention Around the World\n\nAlexander D. Smith BS (Urbana, Illinois) Anant Naik, BS – Medical Student, College of Medicine, Carle Illinois College of Medicine; Mika Janbahan, BS; Emily Smith, BS; David Krist, PhD; Wael Hassaneen, MD, PhD\n\nIntroduction\n\nEVD placement is one of the mainstay therapies for the management of elevated intracranial pressure. Indications include traumatic brain injury, hydrocephalus, meningitis, and various other pathologies. While there is a marked paucity of neurosurgical care globally, the number of patients who require an EVD are frequently found in low-middle income areas. For this reason, we seek to quantify the need for EVD placement globally to determine regions that would benefit from technological advancement in the domain.\n\nMethods\n\nWorldwide distribution of neurosurgeons with the incidence of indication for EVD (TBI, meningitis, and hydrocephalus) were compiled from the World Neurosurgery Workforce in 20161-3. The aggregated values were scaled from 0 to 1 relative to their minimum and maximum. A model was constructed with neurosurgeon distribution comprising 60% of the model, and indications for EVD comprising 40% of the model. Indication scores were computed using this model and visually represented using the rworldmap package in R.\n\nResults\n\nOur global analysis found Montenegro, with an indication score of 0.776, Equatorial Guinea, with an indication score of 0.709, and the Bahamas with an indication score of 0.708 to be the top three targets for improved access to neurosurgical care based on the low numbers of practicing neurosurgeons and high indications for neurosurgical treatment. The generated world map in Figure 1 shows the comparative analysis of neurosurgical need for different countries, with darker regions indicating a higher need for neurosurgical access due to more indications for treatment.\n\nConclusion\n\nEmergencies require neurosurgical access within hours of the inciting event, resulting in major burden to regions with high incidence of neurosurgical emergencies such as severe TBI. Our analysis shows that targeting select regions for deployment of neurosurgical resources and development of new neurosurgical technology for guided EVD placement may reduce the global burden of emergency neurological conditions.\n\n109: The Impact of a Problem-based Note Template on Neurosurgical Quality Metrics\n\nRohaid Ali MD (Providence, Rhode Island) Ziya Gokaslan, MD – Chairman, Neurosurgery, Brown University/Rhode Island Hospital; Albert Telfeian, MD, PhD – Professor, Neurosurgery\n\nIntroduction\n\nTo date, little work has focused on how note templates can affect quality metrics in neurosurgery. Here, we investigate how switching from an inpatient system-based note template to a problem-based note template affects the mortality index and case mix index of a neurosurgery service line.\n\nMethods\n\nOn a neurosurgery service line at an urban, level I trauma, academic teaching hospital, an intervention was made to change the history and physical and progress note templates from system-based to problem-based. Data comparing the monthly case mix index and mortality index was collected for the twelve months preceding intervention and the four months following intervention. The data was statistically analyzed utilizing a t-test, with a significance level of p ≤ 0.05.\n\nResults\n\nThe monthly case mix index average rose from 4.56 in the 12 months preintervention to 4.90 in the four months after intervention, representing a significant change (p = 0.033). The monthly mortality index average fell from 1.16 in the 12 months preintervention to 0.72 in the four months following intervention, also representing a statistically significant change (p = 0.048).\n\nConclusion\n\nSwitching from a system-based to a problem-based charting system on a neurosurgery service line at an urban, level I trauma, academic teaching hospital led to a statistically significant increase in the case mix index and a statistically significant decrease in the mortality index. Given the implications of these findings in an era of value based care, further research is warranted on the relationship between charting and quality outcomes within neurosurgery.\n\n110: Hounsfield Unit as a Predictor of Adjacent Level Disease in Interbody Fusion Surgery\n\nVijay Letchuman (Kansas City, Missouri) Nitin Agarwal, MD – Neurological Surgery; Erica Langnas, MD, MPH; Saman Shabani, MD; Mark Schumacher, MD, PhD; Christopher Abrecht, MD; Sujatha Sankaran, MD; Lori Reisner, PharmD; Dean Chou, MD; Zhonghui Guan, MD; Praveen Mummaneni, MD, MBA\n\nIntroduction\n\nStandardized “Enhanced Recovery After Surgery” (ERAS) protocols have been implemented across the medical field in an attempt to improve perioperative outcomes. Multimodal analgesic regimens utilizing acetaminophen and gabapentin are critical to ERAS protocols and have been proposed as a method of effectively controlling postoperative pain while simultaneously reducing opioid requirements, however, studies in neurosurgical cohorts are scarce. This study aims to investigate the impact of preoperative analgesic medications on postoperative opioid use and outpatient opioid refill rates following neurosurgical interventions.\n\nMethods\n\nUtilizing a large retrospective dataset of 8704 opioid-naïve adult patients who underwent a neurosurgical intervention at a quaternary care institute, preoperative and perioperative analgesic use was obtained through chart review. Standardized oral morphine equivalents (OMEs) were used to compare inpatient and outpatient opioid requirements and physicians were made aware of individual opioid requirements. The efficacy of the outpatient discharge opioid prescription was assessed with regard to opioid refills. Multivariate analysis was conducted to identify predictors of opioid refills.\n\nResults\n\nOf the 8704 opioid-naïve neurosurgical patients included in this cohort, 2768 (32%) patients used preoperative gabapentinoids or benzodiazepines. Patients who used preoperative gabapentinoids required higher doses of opioids in both the inpatient and outpatient settings (p < 0.001). Preoperative gabapentinoid (OR=2.4; 95% CI 2.1-2.7) and benzodiazepine (OR=1.4; 95% CI 1.2-1.6) use was associated with increased risk of opioid refills in the outpatient setting.\n\nConclusion\n\nDespite current efforts to incorporate non-opioid analgesic medications into ERAS protocols, this study demonstrates that, even in opioid-naïve patients, consumption of non-opioid analgesics results in higher opioid use in the acute postoperative period. This warrants further study into the impact of preoperative non-opioid analgesic use on postoperative opioid medication requirements in the acute and chronic periods following neurosurgical interventions.\n\n111: Functional Outcomes After Surgery for Grade 1 Lumbar Spondylolisthesis: A 5-year QOD Study\n\nTimothy J. Yee MD (Ann Arbor, Michigan) Paul Park, MD – Department of Neurosurgery – University of Michigan\n\nIntroduction\n\nLarge, long-term studies of functional outcomes after decompression or fusion for degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis are lacking.\n\nMethods\n\nThe Quality Outcomes Database was queried for patients over age 18 who underwent surgery for single-level grade 1 lumbar spondylolisthesis. The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) was assessed preoperatively and at 3, 12, 24, 36, and 60 months postoperatively.\n\nResults\n\nThe query returned 608 patients. Mean age (95% CI) was 62.2 (61.2-63.1) years, and 42.4% were male. Decompression only was performed in 23% and decompression with fusion in 77%. Mean ODI (95% CI) at baseline, 3 months, 12 months, 24 months, 36 months, and 60 months were 46.7 (45.3-48.1) (n=602), 26.3 (24.7-28) (n=532), 22.1 (20.3-23.9) (n=473), 22.4 (20.6-24.2) (n=453), 21.9 (18.6-25.1) (n=145), and 23.7 (21.8-25.5) (n=433). Significant improvement in mean ODI from baseline was observed at all time points (p<0.0001). In the decompression-only group, mean ODI improvements (95% CI) at 3, 12, 24, 36, and 60 months were 16.4 (13.1-19.7) (n=126), 18.3 (14.3-22.3) (n=106), 15.8 (12-19.6) (n=106), 14 (6-22) (n=21), and 18.8 (14-23.6) (n=88). In the decompression and fusion group, mean ODI improvements (95% CI) at 3, 12, 24, 36, and 60 months were 21.6 (19.7-23.5) (n=406), 26.1 (24.1-28) (n=367), 25.2 (23.1-27.4) (n=346), 27.3 (23.9-30.7) (n=122), and 22.7 (20.5-24.9) (n=341). Utilizing multivariate linear regression, fusion was independently associated with greater ODI improvement at 3, 12, 24, and 36 months (p<0.05) but not 60 months (p=0.07). Three-year reoperation rate was 7.1% overall and similar between decompression-only and decompression plus fusion groups (9.4% vs 6.4%, p>0.05).\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this large study with 60 months or longer follow-up after surgery for single-level grade 1 lumbar spondylolisthesis, patients experienced significant and sustained improvements in function. Addition of fusion to decompression was associated with greater improvements in function through 36 months. Rate of reoperation was low and similar between the two groups.\n\n112: Surgical Management of Spinal Nerve Schwannoma of the Sacrum: A Retrospective Study and Literature Review\n\nWilliam J. Mualem BS (Depftord, New Jersey) Abdul-Karim Ghaith, MD; Deja Rush, BS; Ryan Jarrah, BS; Cameron Zamanian, BS; Giorgos Michalopoulos, MD; Alex Alexander, BS; Mohamad Bydon, MD\n\nIntroduction\n\nSacral schwannomas are rare and account for a minority of spinal schwannomas. The aim of our study is to present our institution’s experience treating sacral schwannomas surgically between the years 1997 and 2018. In addition, we assess the literature for surgical cases of sacral schwannomas in order to demonstrate tumor characteristics and outcomes following surgical resection.\n\nMethods\n\nThrough our retrospective review of patients with sacral schwannoma at our institution, we report our findings on the epidemiology of sacral schwannomas, their presentation, various treatment options, and patient outcomes. These findings were compared to those in the literature.\n\nResults\n\nData on demographics, symptoms, lesion characteristics, surgical management, and outcomes were collected for 28 patients treated surgically for sacral schwannoma between 1997 and 2018 at Mayo Clinic. Thirty-one studies involving patients with sacral schwannoma treated surgically were found in the literature. Mayo Clinic patients compared to those in the literature experienced similar age at diagnosis and symptoms, with the most common symptom being pain and the least common being sexual dysfunction in both cohorts.\n\nConclusion\n\nPatients with sacral schwannomas, uncommon tumors of the spine, may experience variable outcomes based on a variety of factors including demographics, tumor characteristics, symptoms, and surgical treatment. Prognosis improves when the surgical approach towards sacral schwannomas is prepared and executed appropriately.\n\n113: The Impact of Nerve Reconstruction on Long-term Shoulder and Elbow Function in Neonatal Brachial Plexus Palsy\n\nWhitney Muhlestein MD (Ann Arbor, Michigan) Kate Chang, MA; Brandon Smith, MD, MS; Lynda Yang, MD, PhD\n\nIntroduction\n\nTiming and indications for surgical intervention for neonatal brachial plexus palsy (NBPP) remain controversial, likely contributing to underutilization in this population. Employment of nerve reconstruction is approximately 10-fold less than ideal, as evidenced by the 30-40% of unoperated patients who have significant lifelong disablements. Here, we interrogate a large dataset of NBPP patients to illustrate the effectiveness of nerve reconstruction for recovery of shoulder and elbow function as compared to natural history of NBPP patients managed non-surgically.\n\nMethods\n\nAll patients seen at a single tertiary referral center for NBPP from 2005-2020 were included in the database. Exclusion criteria included patients initially seen after 2 yo or only seen for only 1 appointment. AROM for shoulder abduction, exorotation, and elbow flexion was collected at each clinic visit by 1 of 2 program occupational therapists. AROM values were normalized between 0 and 1 and plotted against patient age and a logistic regression fit to the data using open-source packages from Python Seaborn.\n\nResults\n\n325 non-operative and 100 operative children were included in the analysis, and we demonstrate the rate of recovery of shoulder and elbow AROM over 5000 days (mean follow-up of 1777 and 1353 days for non-operative and operative children, respectively). We observed parallel rates of recovery (slope of curves) for shoulder abduction in the operative versus non-operative children, but the absolute recovery was less for the operative patients. In contrast, for elbow flexion and shoulder exorotation, the operative patients demonstrated much higher rates of recovery for the operative group versus the non-operative group, and the absolute recovery at 5000 days was the same for both groups.\n\nConclusion\n\nFuller understanding of the long-term rates of functional recovery with and without surgery can guide surgeons and physiatrists / therapists towards the appropriate timing and indications for nerve reconstruction to improve outcomes for children with NBPP.\n\n114: Effects of Hours of Sleep on Immediate Post-concussion Assessment & Cognitive Testing (ImPACT): Comparing Baseline to 1st Concussion Performance\n\nEugene I. Hrabarchuk BS (New York, New York) Jonathan Dullea, MPH; Lily McCarthy, BA; Adam Li, BS; Theodore Hannah, BA; John Durbin, BS; Mark Lovell, Ph.D; Tanvir Choudhri, MD\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe influence of sleep duration on baseline and post-concussion neurocognitive performance prior to Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment & Cognitive Testing (ImPACT) is poorly understood. Since the ImPACT test is widely used in adolescent athletics for assessing the presence of concussion, it is important to research the multiple factors that affect testing performance. While some research reports correlations between fewer hours of sleep and lower scores on baseline tests, others have not observed any such associations and have not compared baseline scores directly to post-concussion ImPACT tests based on hours of sleep.\n\nMethods\n\nWe queried a database of 11564 ImPACT tests taken from 2009-2019 with athletes aged 12-22. There were 11564 baseline concussion tests and 7446 post-1st concussion ImPACT tests. Linear regression was used to model the effect of sleep on baseline and post-concussion ImPACT scores adjusting for sex, age, learning disability, ADD/ADHD, number of prior concussions/loss of conciousness concussions, number of games missed, and strenuous exercise before testing.\n\nResults\n\nIn baseline testing, there was no relationship between hours of sleep the night prior to the ImPACT test and scores on any of the composite measures. Post-1st concussion, hours of sleep was significantly associated with changes in composite measures in Verbal Memory (0.51 point increase/hour,95%CI:0.26-0.77,p<0.0001), Visual Memory (0.36 point increase/hour,95%CI:0.10-0.63,p=0.0078), and Impulse Control (0.25 point decrease/hour,95%CI:-0.37 to-0.12,p=0.0001). Hours of sleep were not significantly correlated with Reaction time or Visual Motor Scores.\n\nConclusion\n\nHours of sleep did not alter neurocognitive metrics at baseline but did have an impact on the 1st post-concussion test. These findings suggest that individuals may compensate for lack of sleep at baseline but not after concussions. Concussions may reduce cognitive reserve or detract from the brain’s resources making sleep even more important for proper neurocognitive functioning post-concussion. Future work will analyze the effects of sleep on test performance after multiple concussions.\n\n115: Presentation, Treatment and Outcome of Traumatic Dural Venous Sinus Thrombosis\n\nChristopher C. Young MD, PhD (Seattle, Washington) Margaret McGrath, MD; Madeline Greil, MD; Guilherme Barros, MD; Abdullah Feroze, MD; John Williams, jrwneur0@uw.edu; Louis Kim, MD; Randall Chesnut, MD; Michael Levitt, MD\n\nIntroduction\n\nDural venous sinus thrombosis (dVST) is a cause of stroke and raised ICP. Anticoagulation treatment is indicated to prevent propagation of thrombus and promote recanalization. Following traumatic brain injury (TBI), with the widespread use of vascular imaging such as CT venography (CTV), traumatic dVSTs are increasingly diagnosed although the natural history, management and outcomes remain unclear.\n\nMethods\n\nWe performed a 5-year, single-center retrospective review of acute TBI patients diagnosed with traumatic dVST at a Level I trauma center. Demographic and clinical features were examined.\n\nResults\n\nFrom 2016 – 2020, 118 patients were diagnosed with traumatic dVST. The mean age was 38, with 76% male. The commonest mechanisms of injury were fall from height (32%), vehicular accident (20%) and ground level fall (16%). The mean presenting GCS was 11/15 with 28% of patients intubated. Skull fractures were present in 98% with 52% extended to the skullbase. Common sites of traumatic dVST were transverse (48%) and sigmoid (26%) sinuses, and in 96%, skull fracture crossed the injured sinus. In 50 patients with adequate follow-up, 26 received treatment for dVST, including 20/26 receiving aspirin, 4/26 therapeutic anticoagulation and 2/26 aspirin and anticoagulation. The median treatment period was 3 months. Endpoint of treatment was complete or partial resolution of dVST. Regardless of management, patients did not experience significant adverse sequelae from dVST. There was no difference in outcome in patients who received treatment compared to patients who did not, measured by the Glasgow Outcome Scale on follow up (4.3 and 4.5, p = 0.32).\n\nConclusion\n\nTraumatic dVST is a frequently encountered clinical entity, although the incidence of complications is low. In significant TBI with fracture across the sinus, CTV should be obtained to exclude dVST. A 3-months course of antiplatelet therapy result in complete or partial resolution of the dVST, without adverse complications.\n\n116: Enhanced Immunogenicity via Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) Inhibition in SB28 Mouse Glioma Model\n\nOishika Das (Austin, Texas) Isha Mondol, N/A; Elizabeth McFadden, BS; Winson Ho, MD; Rongze Olivia Lu, PhD\n\nIntroduction\n\nImmune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has drastically improved treatment in many cancer types but falls behind in its use within glioblastoma (GBM), one of the most lethal forms of brain cancer. One of the major barriers is that GBM cells are poorly immunogenic, resulting in a lack of T cell infiltration. Therefore, it is critical to identify underlying mechanisms to enhance GBM tumor immunogenicity. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a ubiquitous serine/threonine phosphatase that is implicated in the DNA damage response. While PP2A inhibition has been shown to impair DNA repair and control tumor growth, the impact of PP2A inhibition on tumor immunogenicity has yet to be explored. We hypothesize that PP2A inhibition will trigger the cGAS-cGAMP-STING axis, hyperactivate the IRF3 pathway, in turn increasing downstream Type I Interferon (IFN) signaling and enhancing tumor immunogenicity.\n\nMethods\n\nWT-SB28, a luciferase-expressing murine glioblastoma cell line, was used to generate a CRISPR PP2A KO-SB28. Immunogenic markers MHCI and PDL1 were stained in WT and KO SB28 cells and quantified through flow cytometry. Through qPCR, gene expression of factors downstream of the IRF3 signaling pathway was measured. In vitro, bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC) were co-cultured with WT and PP2A KO-SB28 OVA at ratios of 1:5 and 1:10. FACs was used to quantify the expression of dendritic cell activation markers. Finally, WT and KO-SB28 cells were injected into the cerebellum of immunocompetent mice to monitor survival.\n\nResults\n\nPP2A KO-SB28 showed a dramatic increase of MHCI and PDL1 cell surface expression and IFNb, CXCL10, and ISG15 gene expression over WT. Expression of dendritic cell activation markers such as CD86 and CD80 was enhanced in BMDC co-cultured with KO cells. In vivo, prolonged survival was seen in mice injected with PP2A KO cells.\n\nConclusion\n\nPP2A inhibition promotes enhanced tumor immunogenicity via the IRF3 signaling pathway in SB28 glioma models.\n\n117: Convection-delivered Adenoviral Gene Therapy Reprograms the Immunosuppressive Glioblastoma Microenvironment\n\nNational Brain Tumor Society (NBTS) Award\n\nJacob S. Young MD (San Francisco, California) Nam Woo Cho, MD PhD; Tim Casey-Clyde, BS; Raquel Santos, BS; Kyounghee Seo, BS; Joanna Phillips, MD PhD – UCSF; Mitchel Berger, MD – UCSF; Tomoko Ozawa, MD PhD; David Raleigh, MD PhD\n\nIntroduction\n\nImmune checkpoint inhibition has not improved outcomes for glioblastoma patients, and single-cell approaches reveal the glioblastoma microenvironment is largely comprised of immunosuppressive cells. We hypothesized intratumor convection enhanced delivery (CED) of adenoviral gene therapy could recruit and activate anti-tumor immune cells in the glioblastoma microenvironment.\n\nMethods\n\nSyngeneic GL261 glioblastoma cells (30x105 cells/mouse) were implanted into the frontal lobe of immunocompetent C57BL/6J mice (18 mice/arm). Intracranial bioluminescence (BLI) and body weight measurements were used to assess glioblastoma growth and treatment toxicity, respectively. After tumor engraftment, glioblastomas were treated with conformal ionizing radiation mimicking stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in human patients (18Gy/1Fx), or CED of attenuated adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9) vectors encoding Ccl4, Il1b, or Apoa1 (2x1011 vg/mouse), cytokines driving recruitment and activation of anti-tumor immune cells in other intracranial tumors. Glioblastomas were collected for histologic, single-cell, and molecular analyses 5 days after treatment (6 mice/arm), and at the time of euthanasia after monitoring for survival (12 mice/arm). Treatment responses were assessed using H&E and IHC staining for macrophages (Iba1) or T cells (CD3). CED targeting was validated using AAV9-GFP and confocal microscopy, and results were compared to untreated glioblastoma controls. Mass cytometry of immune cell types in the glioblastoma microenvironment, cytokine expression in glioblastomas and peripheral blood, and validation using syngeneic SB28 glioblastomas are underway.\n\nResults\n\nHistologic analyses revealed treatment with AAV9-CCL4, AAV9-IL1□, or SRS induced glioblastoma macrophage infiltration compared to AAV9-GFP or untreated control glioblastomas. Treatment with AAV9-IL1□, AAV9-APOA1, or SRS induced glioblastoma T cell infiltration and tumor fibrosis compared to AAV9-GFP or untreated control glioblastomas. SRS prolonged survival compared to untreated control glioblastomas (23 days versus 14 days, p<0.001). There was no evidence of toxicity.\n\nConclusion\n\nConvection-delivered adenoviral gene therapy and SRS can reprogram the glioblastoma immune microenvironment, revealing a strategy that may sensitize glioblastomas to immune checkpoint inhibition.\n\n200: A Multi-center Study of Intra-operative, in Vivo, Optics-based Detection of Brain Tumor Tissue Using Raman Spectroscopy and Machine Learning\n\nLeica Award\n\nConstantinos G. Hadjipanayis MD, PhD, FAANS (New York, New York) Katherine Ember, PhD; Rajeev Agarwal, PhD; Juliette selb, PhD; Frederick Dallaire, PhD; Arthur Plante, PhD; Melissa Umphlett, MD; Nadejda Tsankova, MD, PhD; Caroline Rizea, BS; Armand Harb, BS; Lily McCarthy, BS; Frederic Leblond, PhD; Kevin Petrecca, MD, PhD\n\nIntroduction\n\nOptimal brain tumor surgery maximizes tumor cell removal and minimizes surgery-induced neurological deficits. Raman spectroscopy (RS) is a laser-based, label-free, optics-based approach that can identify molecular features of tissues, enabling discrimination between tissue types. We present the first multi-center study that assessed the effectiveness of a handheld RS probe-based device to classify tumor and brain tissues during surgery.\n\nMethods\n\nIn vivo RS data were acquired from 2 centers using a handheld probe from 68 patients with glioblastomas (GBs), brain metastases (BMs), and meningiomas. Measurements and corresponding biopsies were taken from the tumor bulk, tumor margins, and surrounding brain tissue. Biopsy sections were pathologically classified by tumor cell density. Spectral information and associated pathological labels were used to build machine learning classification models.\n\nResults\n\nClassification models identifying tumor and non-tumor tissues were generated using a training (80% of patients) and testing set (20%) from one center for each tumor type. Models achieved accuracies of 82% (training) and 87% (testing) for 25 GBs, 96% (training) and 97% (testing) for 15 BMs, and 95% (training and testing) for 13 meningiomas. These models generated an 81% accuracy when applied to data from 12 patients with meningioma or metastasis for which data was acquired independently at a different center. Performance of models increased from 56% accuracy for a tumor cell burden of 15-50% to 69% for 50-90% invasion.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis RS-based tumor detection device can discriminate between normal and tumor tissue across tumor types with 90% accuracy and 87-97% specificity and can identify invasive tumor cells at the margin. The in vivo and in real time capabilities make this device ideal for maximizing tumor resection and minimizing normal brain resection.\n\n201: A Novel and Targetable Mechanism of Immuno-secretory Function at the Choroid Plexus-cerebrospinal Fluid Interface\n\nStephanie Robert MD, PhD (New Haven, Connecticut) Benjamin Reeves, BA; Emre Kiziltug, BA; Jason Karimy, BS; Arnaud Marlier, PhD; Phan Duy, PhD; Amrita Singh, BA; Garrett Allington, BA; Jinwei Zhang, PhD; TuKiet Lam, PhD; Rashaun Wilson, PhD; Tyrone DeSpenza, BA; Ana Greenberg,.; Brian Hilton,.; Adam Kundishora, MD; Xue Zeng, PhD; Eric Delpire, PhD; Seth Alper, MD, PhD; Kristopher Kahle, MD, PhD\n\nIntroduction\n\nPost-infectious hydrocephalus (PIH) is the most common cause of acquired hydrocephalus worldwide, and management remains neurosurgical cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunting. We previously demonstrated post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) is driven by a TLR4-mediated choroid plexus (ChP) inflammatory response resulting in acute hydrocephalus. Using a rat model of PIH, we demonstrate ventriculomegaly and CSF hypersecretion is associated with alterations in a novel SPAK-mediated ion transportome and define a common TLR4-mediated ChP immune response in both IVH and LPS-mediated inflammatory hydrocephalus.\n\nMethods\n\nSPAK and TLR4 knockout (KO) rats were generated using Crispr/CAS9. A catheter was implanted into the lateral ventricles of adult male rats; E. coli (+/-LPS), LPS, or blood was administered over 48-72h. CSF secretion was measured by catheter placement into the ventricle. ChP were harvested for immunohistochemistry (IHC), genomic/proteomic analysis, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). SPAK-associated ChP targets were identified through liquid chromatography/dual mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) analysis of purified SPAK-protein complex; candidates were validated by WB/IHC.\n\nResults\n\nBumetanide-sensitive, SPAK-dependent CSF hypersecretion and ventriculomegaly was observed after intraventricular LPS or IVH infusion. LPS and IVH triggered robust ChP inflammation, and phospho-activation of SPAK, and the bumetanide-sensitive cation-chloride-cotransporter NKCC1. SPAK LC-MS/MS pull-down assay revealed three important SPAK-bound proteins, Na/K ATPase (alpha-1 subunit), K+ channel KCNJ13/Kir7.1, Cl- channel CLIC6, and AQP1; IHC demonstrated increased apical colocalization of these targets with SPAK. Importantly, ChP inflammation, CSF hypersecretion, and ventriculomegaly were abrogated with knockout of SPAK or TLR4, and in animals treated with systemic administration of immune-modulatory drugs.\n\nConclusion\n\nMultiomic analysis identifies a novel, common, and targetable mechanism of PIH and PIH, mediated by a SPAK-regulated ChP ion transportome, and initiated by TLR4-dependent inflammatory response. CSF hypersecretion and hydrocephalus are attenuated with inhibition of TLR4, SPAK, and through systemic immune-modulation. Our findings uncover a targetable mechanism for the pharmacological treatment of PIH, PHH, and potentially other forms of inflammatory hydrocephalus.\n\n202: Comparing Posterior Cervical Foraminotomy with Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion in Radiculopathic Patients: An Analysis from the QOD\n\nStewart Dunsker Award for Best Clinical Spine Abstract\n\nMohamad Bydon MD, FAANS (Rochester, Minnesota) Praveen Mummaneni, MD, MBA; Erica Bisson, MD, MPH; Giorgos Michalopoulos, MD; William Mualem, BS; Sally El Sammak, MD; Michael Wang, MD; Andrew Chan, MD; Mohammed Ali Alvi, MBBS, MS; Regis Haid, MD; John Knightly, MD; Clinton Devin, MD; Brandon Sherrod, MD; Oren Gottfried, MD; Khoi Than, MD; Jacob Goldberg, MD; Michael Virk, MD, PhD; Nitin Agarwal, MD; Steven Glassman, MD; Paul Park, MD; Kai-Ming Fu, MD, PhD; Brenton Pennicooke, MD, MS; Anthony Asher, MD\n\nIntroduction\n\nPosterior cervical foraminotomy (PCF) is often offered as an alternative to anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) for the management of cervical radiculopathy. This study’s objective was to compare clinical and patient-reported outcomes between PCF and ACDF in patients presenting with radiculopathy.\n\nMethods\n\nThe Quality Outcomes Database (QOD) was queried for patients who underwent ACDF or PCF for radiculopathy. Multivariable model-based imputation was utilized for missing data. To create two highly homogeneous groups, optimal matching was performed at a 2:1 ratio between the two groups on 40 baseline variables (including demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, patient-reported scores, indications, and levels treated). Outcomes of interest were estimated blood loss (EBL), length of stay (LOS), readmissions, reoperations, patient-reported satisfaction (based on the North American Spine Surgery index - NASS), increase in Quality-adjusted Life Years (QALY), and decrease in Neck Disability Index (NDI), arm and neck pain scores.\n\nResults\n\nA total of 10,765 eligible patients with annual follow-up were identified, of which 319 underwent PCF. The patients undergoing ACDF had more comorbidities, more complex pathologies, lower QALY scores, and higher NDI and neck pain scores at baseline. After optimal matching, the two groups included 638 and 319 patients. ACDF was associated with slightly higher satisfaction (NASS 1-2) rates at 3 months (91.8% vs. 87.8%, p=0.04). The ACDF group also had lower arm pain scores at 3 months after surgery (1.6 vs. 2.3, p=0.005; MCID: 76.2% vs. 67.7%, p=0.005), which lost significance at 12 months. PCF was associated with a shorter LOS (0.5 vs. 0.9 days, p<0.001). The differences in the rest of the outcomes were not significant.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this study, ACDF was found to provide slightly higher 3-month satisfaction and arm pain control, but this difference attenuated at the 12-month follow-up. One-year reoperation rates and patient-reported outcomes did not differ between the two groups.\n\n203: Single-cell Transcriptome Analysis Reveals Dynamic Cell Populations and Differential Gene Expression Patterns in a Mouse Cerebral Aneurysm Model\n\nYoung Neurosurgeon Abstract Award\n\nIsabella G. McCormack MS (New Orleans, Louisiana) Alejandra Martinez, PhD; Giovane Tortelote, PhD; Crissey Pascale, MA; Kristen Nordham, BA; Natalie Suder, MS; Mitchell Couldwell, MS; Aaron Dumont, MD, MBA\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe circle of Willis (CoW) is the most common location for cerebral aneurysms to form in humans. Although the major cell types of the intracranial vasculature are well known, the heterogeneity and relative contributions of the different cells in healthy versus aneurysmal vessels have not been well-characterized. Here, we present the first comprehensive analysis of the lineage heterogeneity, altered transcriptomic profiles and functional states of vascular cells from healthy and aneurysmal mouse CoW vessels using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq).\n\nMethods\n\nCerebral aneurysms (CA) were induced in adult male mice using an elastase model. ScRNAseq was then performed on CoW samples obtained at 14 days post-aneurysm induction.\n\nResults\n\nUnbiased clustering analysis of the transcriptional profiles from >3900 CoW cells identified 19 clusters representing 10 cell lineages: vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), endothelial cells, fibroblasts, pericytes and immune cells (macrophages, T and B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, mast cells and neutrophils). Seurat clustering analysis identified 5 VSMC subpopulations and 6 monocyte/macrophage subpopulations with distinct transcriptional profiles. VSMC subpopulations were classified as being proliferative, stress-induced senescent, quiescent, inflammatory-like or hyperproliferative. The transcriptional signature of the metabolic pathways of ATP generation was found to be downregulated in 2 major VSMC clusters when CA was induced. Elastase exposure also induced significant expansion of the total macrophage population and this expansion was further increased with CA rupture. Both inflammatory and resolution-phase macrophages were identified, and a massive spike of neutrophils was seen with CA rupture. Additionally, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) which originated from the elastase CA induction mirrored that which has been observed in humans.\n\nConclusion\n\nOur data identify CA disease-relevant transcriptional signatures of vascular cells in the CoW. Furthermore, we characterize the heterogeneity and cellular responses of VSMCs and monocytes/macrophages during CA progression, which provides insight into their function and their role in CA pathogenesis.\n\n204: Microenvironmental Correlates of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Response in Human Melanoma Brain Metastases Revealed by T Cell Receptor and Single-cell RNA Sequencing\n\nAmerican Brain Tumor Association Young Investigator Award\n\nChristopher Alvarez-Breckenridge MD PhD (Houston, Texas) Samuel Markson, PhD; Jackson Stocking, BS; Naema Nayyar, BS; Albert Kim, MD; Magali de Sauvage, BS; Matt Strickland, MD; Joana Mora, BS; Juliana Larson, BS; Ashish Dahal, BS; Maria Martinez-Lage, MD, PhD; Matthew Frosch, MD, PhD; Elizabeth Gerstner, MD, PhD; brian Nahed, BNAHED@MGH.HARVARD.EDU; William Curry, MD; Bob Carter, MD, PhD; Mario Suva, MD, PhD; Daniel Cahill, MD, PhD; Ryan Sullivan, MD; Scott Carter, PhD; Priscilla Brastianos, MD\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe emergence of immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) for patients with metastatic melanoma has significantly improved their clinical outcomes. However, the central nervous system (CNS) is frequently a site of disease progression and nearly 50% of patients with metastatic melanoma succumb to CNS disease. Thus, treatment of melanoma brain metastases (MBM) is an unmet clinical need. We hypothesized that response to ICI is reflective of unique features within the tumor microenvironment of the brain.\n\nMethods\n\nTo study the nature of the tumor microenvironment in MBM, we collected 27 freshly resected MBM and performed single cell RNA sequencing (Smart-Seq2) and T cell receptor clonotyping from MBM and matched blood to dissect intratumoral immune cell heterogeneity.\n\nResults\n\nLymphocyte analysis demonstrated unique T cell phenotypes and clonal dynamics that were not explained by intratumoral hemorrhage. Utilizing differential gene expression, brain tumor associated, clonally expanded T cells exhibited significant expression of NKG7, PRF1, HAVCR2, TIGIT, and GZMB. Moreover, we observed significant variation along the exhaustion/memory axis between detectably expanded and non-expanded T cell clones. We similarly observed distinct T cell functional states between unique, clonally expanded intratumoral T cells that diverge from clones shared with both the tumor and blood. Lastly, utilizing the single pre-treatment patient who went on to respond to ICI, we were able to perform a composite T cell histologic, phenotypic and clonal analyses within this patient compared the remainder of the cohort.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe identified T cell clonal expansion in the blood as a biomarker of response to ICI. Additionally, we observed evidence of overlap between clonally expanded T cells in the blood and brain which ultimately evolves into phenotypically distinct, tumor exclusive T cell populations. These findings provide novel insights into T cell clonal dynamics within the CNS and the relationship between the cranial and extracranial compartments in the setting of ICI.\n\n205: Prospective Validation of Machine Learning Technique for Automated Intraoperative Frozen Diagnosis of Brain Tumors\n\nKLS Martin Award\n\nSiri Sahib S. Khalsa MD (Ann Arbor, Michigan) Sandra Camelo-Piragua, MD; Diana Thomas, MD; Jose Otero, MD; Brian Goodwin, PhD; Corey Jaskolski, MS; Peter Ouillette, MT-ASCP; Daniel Orringer, MD; Todd Hollon, MD\n\nIntroduction\n\nNeurosurgeons rely on rapid histologic diagnosis during brain tumor surgery for surgical decision-making. Although frozen sectioning is available at most surgical hospitals, nearly half of these hospitals do not have access to intraoperative neuropathology consultation. The authors previously described an artificial intelligence program to automatically diagnose whole frozen slides among the following supratentorial enhancing tumors: metastatic carcinoma, high-grade glioma, lymphoma, and meningioma. We present a validation study of this technique using prospectively collected frozen specimens.\n\nMethods\n\nIn our previous work, labeled frozen images were used to train a deep machine learning algorithm called a convolutional neural network. An additional algorithm combined these field-of-view diagnoses into whole-slide diagnoses. The authors tested a new set of prospectively collected intraoperative frozen section specimens, and compared the automated whole-slide diagnosis with board-certified neuropathologist interpretation.\n\nResults\n\nThirty-six prospectively collected intraoperative frozen section slides were tested from a single academic center. The automated algorithm correctly diagnosed 8/8 carcinomas, 12/12 high-grade gliomas, 4/4 lymphomas, and 12/12 meningiomas, with an overall whole-slide diagnostic accuracy of 100%. Results for additional slides from two academic medical centers will be able to be reported at the time of presentation.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe previously developed a computer program to automatically distinguish between the core differential diagnoses for adult supratentorial enhancing brain tumors, using traditional intraoperative frozen section slides. Here we present validation of this technique with prospectively collected data. This algorithm may be beneficial to centers without access to intraoperative neuropathology consultation during brain tumor surgery. The authors continue with efforts to generalize the algorithm for use in different medical center and types of slide scanners.\n\n206: Evaluating Efficacy of a Novel Hydrogel-CXCL9-mRNA Vaccine in Combination with Temozolomide in a Murine Glioma Model\n\nStryker CNS Tumor Award\n\nYusuf Mehkri BS (Gainesville, Florida) Farhad Dastmalchi, DVM; Aida Karachi, DVM PhD; Elias Sayour, MD PhD; Hector Mendez-Gomez, PhD; Thomas Angelini, PhD; Duane Mitchell, MD PhD; Maryam Rahman, MD\n\nIntroduction\n\nGlioblastoma has had disappointing preliminary response to immunotherapy. We have created an immunotherapy platform that overcomes treatment resistance with the combination of a chemokine (CXCL9) and a novel mRNA-nanoparticle in a polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogel scaffold. This hydrogel-CXCL9-mRNA (HCM) vaccine results in robust recruitment of multiple immune cell subsets with anti-tumor efficacy in aggressive syngeneic murine models. Due to the immunomodulatory effects of temozolomide (TMZ), we sought to evaluate the immune response and survival in tumor bearing mice treated with a combination of TMZ and the HCM vaccine.\n\nMethods\n\nSurvival was compared between 5 groups of 8 C57BL/6 mice implanted intracranially with KR158-luciferase (10,000 cells). Vaccine - produced using 25□g total tumor RNA, 500ng CXCL9, nanoparticle and PEG hydrogel - was injected subcutaneously near cervical lymph nodes. Animals in the vaccine alone group and combination groups (pre-TMZ and mid-TMZ) received three doses over 15 days of HCM vaccine. In the pre-TMZ group, animals received the first dose of the HCM vaccine one week before the TMZ cycle. In the mid-TMZ group, animals received the first HCM vaccine dose one week after the first dose of TMZ. Animals were monitored twice daily, and Kaplan Meier curves generated for survival analysis.\n\nResults\n\nAnimals treated with HCM vaccine had significantly improved survival compared to control (pre-TMZ: p=0.002, mid-TMZ: p<0.001, hydrogel alone: p<0.001). TMZ alone showed no difference in survival compared to controls. There was no significant difference between pre-TMZ and mid-TMZ, demonstrating no difference in timing of delivery. Hydrogel alone group showed improved survival compared to both pre-TMZ (p=0.0033) and mid-TMZ (p=0.0001). Results demonstrate that TMZ abrogated the survival benefit from the vaccine.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe HCM vaccine demonstrates significant anti-tumor efficacy and improved survival in the KR158 tumor bearing animals. The role of TMZ in combination with immunotherapy is an area that warrants further studies.\n\n207: CNS Drug Screening Identifies Metixene as a Novel Autophagy Modulator in Brain Metastases\n\nRonald L. Bittner Award on Brain Tumor Research\n\nJawad Fares MD, MSc (Chicago, Illinois) Deepak Kanojia, PhD – Research Assistant Professor, Neurological Surgery, Northwestern University; Alex Cordero, PhD – Postdoctoral Research Fellow, Neurological Surgery, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine; Edgar Petrosyan, MD – Postdoctoral Research Fellow, Neurological Surgery, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine; Victor Arrieta, MD – Postdoctoral Research Fellow, Neurological Surgery, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine; Peng Zhang, PhD – Research Assistant Professor, Neurological Surgery, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine; Jason Miska, PhD – Research Assistant Professor, Neurological Surgery, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine; Atique Ahmed, PhD – Associate Professor, Neurological Surgery, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine; Irina Balyasnikova, PhD – Associate Professor, Neurological Surgery, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine; Adam Sonabend, MD, FAANS – Associate Professor, Neurological Surgery, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine; Maciej Lesniak, MD, MHCM, FAANS – Professor and Chairman, Neurological Surgery, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine\n\nIntroduction\n\nBrain metastases are the final frontier in neuro-oncology for which more efficacious therapies are required. Lack of treatments limits patient survival and results in poor outcomes. Using a CNS drug library, we probed cancer susceptibilities to identify novel, effective agents against breast cancer brain metastases (BCBM).\n\nMethods\n\nWe conducted a blinded CNS drug screen on two BCBM cell lines using 320 agents that are known to be permeable through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration. Experiments to analyze the anti-cancer efficacy of top agents were conducted. In vivo models of brain metastases, using immunodeficient mice, were used to check for survival benefit. Functional studies to understand the mechanism of action were pursued.\n\nResults\n\nMetixene, an antiparkinsonian drug, was identified as a top therapeutic agent against BCBM. It was capable of inducing caspase-mediated apoptosis in different metastatic breast cancer subtypes. In addition, it was effective against HER2-positive and triple-negative BCBM, as well as trastuzumab-sensitive and resistant cell lines. Orthotopic xenograft assays revealed a significant reduction in mammary tumor weight and volume upon metixene treatment (P<0.0001). Treatment of mice bearing intracranial xenografts with metixene improved survival significantly (P=0.0008). Furthermore, metixene treatment improved survival significantly in a murine, intracarotid model of multiple brain metastases (P=0.03). An exploratory Reverse Phase Protein Array to identify molecular responses that mediate the anti-cancer activity of the chosen therapeutic agent, showed autophagy as a primary biological mechanism regulated by metixene in comparison to controls (P < 0.05). Immunofluorescence staining of LC3 showed a significant increase in the accumulation of puncta in metixene-treated cells (P = 0.015).\n\nConclusion\n\nMetixene is a promising, BBB-permeable therapeutic agent against BCBM, with minimal reported side effects in humans. Our preclinical findings merit further investigation and potential introduction of metixene onto the clinical scene.\n\n208: Improvement in Resident Performance for Minimally Invasive Lumbar Decompression Using a State-of-the-art Simulator\n\nIbrahim Hussain MD (New York, New York) Carolin Melcher, MD; Sertac Kirnaz, MD; Jacob Goldberg, MD; Fabian Sommer, MD; Rodrigo Navarro-Ramirez, MD; Branden Medary, BS; Roger Hartl, MD\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe learning curve for spine surgery trainees acquiring techniques with minimally invasive tubular cases requires mastery of skills outside those learned for open decompression. Surgical simulation can complement traditional methods of skill acquisition by providing realistic anatomy, tactile feedback, and complication situations that can be discovered, practiced on, and addressed prior to surgery on a live patient. Our objective was to quantify the educational benefit to surgical trainees of using a state-of-the-art simulator to perform minimally invasive (MIS) unilateral laminotomy for bilateral decompression (ULBD) for lumbar stenosis.\n\nMethods\n\nTwelve orthopedic and neurological surgery residents performed 3 MIS ULBD procedures over 2 weeks on a simulator guided by established AO Spine metrics. Video recording of each surgery was rated by 3 blinded, independent experts using a global rating scale. The learning curve was evaluated with attention to technical skills, skipped steps, occurrence of errors, and timing. A knowledge gap analysis evaluating participants’ current versus desired ability was performed after each trial.\n\nResults\n\nFrom trial 1 to 3, there was a decrease in average procedural time by 31.7 minutes. The cumulative number of skipped steps and surgical errors decreased from 25 to 6 and 24 to 6, respectively. Overall surgical proficiency improved as indicated by video rating of efficiency and smoothness of surgical maneuvers, most notably with knowledge and handling of instruments. The greatest changes were noted in junior rather than senior residents. Average knowledge gap analysis significantly decreased by 30% from the first to last trial (P=0.001), signifying trainees performed closer to their desired technical goal.\n\nConclusion\n\nProcedural metrics for minimally invasive ULBD in combination with a realistic surgical simulator can be used to improve the skills and confidence of trainees. Surgical simulation may offer an important educational complement to traditional methods of skill acquisition and should be explored further with other MIS techniques.\n\n209: Outpatient versus Inpatient Lumbar Discectomy: A Matched Study Investigating Patient-reported and Surgical Outcomes\n\nJames H. Mooney MD (Birmingham, Alabama) Giorgios Michalopoulos, MD; Daniel Zeitouni, BA; Sally El Sammak, MD; Mohammed Alvi, M.B.B.S.; Michael Wang, MD, FACS; Domacoj Coric, MD; Andrew Chan, MD; Praveen Mummaneni, MD, MBA; Erica Bisson, MD, MPH; Regis Haid, MD; John Knightly, MD; Clinton Devin, MD; Brenton Pennicooke, MD; Anthony Asher, MD; Mohamad Bydon, MD\n\nIntroduction\n\nSpine surgery represents an ideal target for cost reduction, with outpatient surgery resulting in significant cost savings. With an increased focus on value-based health care, lumbar discectomy is increasingly performed outpatient when appropriate.\n\nMethods\n\nThe Quality Outcomes Database (QOD) was queried for patients undergoing elective one- or two-level lumbar decompression for degenerative spine disease. Patients were grouped as outpatient if they were discharged on the date of surgery and as inpatient if they stayed in the hospital for one or two days. Cases of incidental durotomy were excluded from the cohort as a potential trigger for changing outpatient status. To create two highly homogeneous groups, optimal matching was performed at a 1:1 ratio between the two groups on 33 baseline variables (including demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, patient-reported scores, indications, and operative details). Outcomes of interest were readmissions and reoperations at 30 days and 3 months after surgery, overall satisfaction, and decrease in Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), back and leg pain at 3 months after surgery.\n\nResults\n\nThe study cohorts consisted of 4,345 patients in each group. The 30-day readmission rates were 4.9% and 5% for the outpatient and inpatient groups, respectively, while the 30-day reoperation rates were 1.6% and 1.2%. The 3-month readmission rates were 5.3% and 5%, and the 3-month reoperation rates were 2.3% for both groups. Overall satisfaction at 3 months was 87.5% and 88% for the outpatient and inpatient groups, respectively. ODI, VAS leg pain, and VAS back pain scores were all lower in the outpatient group at 3 months, but the difference was clinically insignificant. Non-inferiority of outpatient surgery was documented for all outcomes.\n\nConclusion\n\nOutpatient lumbar discectomy demonstrated non-inferior clinical outcomes at 30 days and 3 months after surgery compared to inpatient discectomy. Patient-reported satisfaction from surgery, ODI, and pain scores were also similar between the two groups.\n\n210: Sarcopenia as a Predictor of Survival in Oncological Spine Surgery: Validation of CT Morphometric Measurement of Psoas Size\n\nRafael De la Garza Ramos MD (Bronx, New York) Joshua Benton, MD; Yaroslav Gelfand, MD; Saikiran Murthy, DO; Reza Yassari, MD\n\nIntroduction\n\nSarcopenia is a syndrome characterized by loss of muscle mass and strength. In patients with metastatic spine disease, it was recently proposed as a biomarker associated with postoperative survival. The objective of this study is to validate the use of sarcopenia as a prognostic factor for survival in our population and to validate specific proposed cut-off measurements used to define this condition.\n\nMethods\n\nA total of 104 patients with complete preoperative CT imaging who underwent oncological spine surgery at our institution between 2013 and 2021 were identified. Sarcopenia was defined as a cross-sectional area of the psoas muscle at the L4 pedicle level less than 10.5 cm2 for men and less than 7.2 cm2 for women based on the work by Zakaria et al. The main dependent variable was overall survival (OS). 30-day survival (30S) and 90-day survival (90S) were also examined. All survival analyses were done following Kaplan-Meier methods.\n\nResults\n\nThe average age of all patients was 62 years and 61/104 were male (58.7%). Sarcopenia was diagnosed in 40/104 patients (38.5%); its prevalence was 46.5% in women and 32.8% in men (p=0.157). Median OS was 19.5 months for all patients. However, median OS was 4 months for sarcopenic patients and 26 months for non-sarcopenic patients (log-rank, p=0.005). 30S and 90S were significantly lower for patients with sarcopenia (p=0.009 and p=0.003, respectively). After controlling for age, sex, BMI, functional status, rapid-growing tumor type, and presence of pathologic fracture, sarcopenia remained as an independent significant risk factor for mortality (Hazard Ratio 2.2; 95% CI, 1.06 – 4.56; p=0.035).\n\nConclusion\n\nSarcopenia is an important and significant risk factor for survival after oncological spine surgery. The proposed cut-off values were significant in our population and can be used for preoperative risk stratification and improved decision-making. Future research into preoperative optimization and treatment of sarcopenia is needed.\n\n211: Internal Neurolysis versus Intraoperative Glycerin Rhizotomy for Trigeminal Neuralgia\n\nWilliam H. Sweet Young Investigators Award\n\nRisheng Xu MD PhD (Baltimore, Maryland) Divyaansh Raj, BS – Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine; Joshua Materi, BS – Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine; Safwan Alomari, MD – Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine; Yuanxuan Xia, MD – Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine; Sumil Nair, BA – Johns Hopkins University School fo Medicine; Pavan Shah, BS – Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine; Nivedha Kannapadi, BS – Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine; Timothy Kim, BS – Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine; Judy Huang, MD – Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine; Chetan Bettegowda, MD PhD – Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine; Michael Lim, MD – Stanford University School of Medicine\n\nIntroduction\n\nInternal neurolysis (IN) and intraoperative glycerin rhizotomy (ioGR) are emerging surgical options for patients with trigeminal neuralgia without neurovascular contact.\n\nMethods\n\nWe retrospectively reviewed all patients who underwent IN or ioGR for trigeminal neuralgia at our institution. Patient demographics, immediate postoperative outcomes, as well as long term neurological outcomes were compared.\n\nResults\n\nOut of 1044 patients who underwent open surgical treatment for trigeminal neuralgia, 56 patients underwent IN and 91 underwent ioGR. 138/147 of these patients had no evidence of intraoperative neurovascular conflict. All patients who underwent IN and 96.7% of patients who underwent ioGR had immediate postoperative pain relief. At last follow-up, patients who underwent IN had lower BNI pain intensity scores (p=0.05), better BNI facial numbness scores (p<0.01), and a greater degree of pain improvement (p=0.05) compared to those who underwent ioGR. Patients who underwent IN also had significantly lower rates of symptomatic pain recurrence (p<0.01) at last follow up over an average of 9.5 months.\n\nConclusion\n\nInternal neurolysis appears to provide patients with a greater degree of pain relief, lower rates of facial numbness, and lower rates of pain recurrence compared to intraoperative glycerin rhizotomy. Future prospective studies will better characterize long-term pain recurrence and outcomes.\n\n212: Twelve-month Outcomes from RCT: 10khz Spinal Cord Stimulation for Treating Non-surgical Refractory Back Pain\n\nNaresh P. Patel MD, FAANS (Phoenix, Arizona) Julie Pilitsis, MD, PhD – Albany Medical Center; Erika Petersen, MD – University of Arkansas for Medical Sci; Chengyuan Wu, MD – Thomas Jefferson University; Shivanand Lad, MD, PhD – Duke University Medical Center; Jessica Jameson, MD – Axis Spine Center; Mark Lyons, MD – Mayo Clinic; Leonardo Kapural, MD, PhD – Carolinas Pain Institute\n\nIntroduction\n\nMost evidence for clinical- and cost-effectiveness of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is for treating chronic refractory back and leg pain following spine-surgery, with limited evidence where the patient has no prior surgery and is a poor surgical candidate. But inconsistent health care payer reimbursement and lower clinical adoption provides an impetus for providing stronger evidence for SCS treating this condition that we have termed “Non-Surgical Refractory Back Pain” (NSRBP). We present the 12-month results comparing 10kHz SCS to conventional medical management (CMM) in this population.\n\nMethods\n\nNSRBP patients as defined above, with spine surgeon consultation required for confirmation, were randomized 1:1, to CMM with and without 10kHz SCS. CMM was provided according to physicians’ best practice and clinical guidelines. Primary and secondary endpoints including responder rate (% with ≥50% pain relief), function, quality of life, and change in daily opioid use, and were analyzed at 3 and 6 months respectively, with follow-up to 12 months.\n\nResults\n\nThere were 159 NSRBP patients (age 55.3±11.9 years, time since symptoms onset of 11.4±10.9, multiple etiologies) were randomized to either CMM alone (n=75) or to 10kHz SCS (n=83). All primary and secondary endpoints were met for the 10kHz SCS group, with clear benefit over CMM alone (p<0.001). Serious adverse events were limited to 4 procedure related in 10kHz SCS subjects. At 12 months the 10kHz SCS arm maintained 78.1% (95%CI 66.0–90.2) responder rate, ODI of 24 points (95%CI 19.8-28.2), EQ-5D-5L index of 0.780 (95%CI 0.633-0.927), and a 49.6% (95%CI 32.3-66.9) reduction in daily opioid use.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis study demonstrates that the addition of 10kHz SCS to CMM results in profound improvements in pain relief, function, and quality of life in these NSRBP patients who have been deemed not surgical candidates and exhausted all available appropriate nonoperative medical management.\n\n213: Durability of 10-khz Spinal Cord Stimulation for Painful Diabetic Neuropathy: 18-month Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial Results\n\nErika A. Petersen MD, FAANS, FACS (Little Rock, Arkansas) Thomas Stauss, MD; James Scowcroft, MD; Elizabeth Brooks, PhD; Judith White, MD; Shawn Sills, MD; Kasra Amirdelfan, MD; Maged Guirguis, MD; Jijun Xu, MD, PhD; Cong Yu, MD; Ali Nairizi, MD; Denis Patterson, DO; Vincent Galan, MD; Richard Bundschu, MD; Neel Mehta, MD; Dawood Sayed, MD; Shivanand Lad, MD, PhD; David DiBenedetto, MD; Khalid Sethi, MD; Paul Wu, MD; Charles Argoff, MD; Christian Nasr, MD; Rod Taylor, MSc, PhD; David Caraway, MD, PhD; Nagy Mekhail, MD, PhD\n\nIntroduction\n\nApproximately 6 million US adults are living with painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) and many find conventional treatments ineffective. The published 6-month SENZA-PDN data demonstrated 10-kHz spinal cord stimulation (SCS) substantially relieves pain and may improve sensation in patients with refractory symptoms.\n\nMethods\n\nProspective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial (SENZA-PDN) to document the impact of 10-kHz SCS on PDN. Participants had PDN symptoms ≥12 months, refractory to medications, lower limb pain intensity ≥5cm (0-10cm visual analog scale [VAS]), and hemoglobin A1c ≤10%. Patients (n=216) were allocated 1:1 to 10-kHz SCS (Nevro Corp.) plus conventional medical management (CMM) or CMM alone and followed for 18 months with an option to crossover at 6 months.\n\nResults\n\nPatients assigned 10-kHz SCS experienced substantial, sustained pain relief with 78% improvement over 18 months (baseline VAS=7.6 cm, 18-month VAS=1.7 cm). Additionally, this group reported average 65% reduction in sleep disturbance due to pain and 65% improvement in pain interference with mood and daily activities. No 10-kHz SCS participants elected to crossover.\n\nAt 6-month follow-up, 93% of eligible CMM patients elected to crossover and results were similar to those seen in the original SCS group: 70% pain relief over 18 months (baseline VAS=7.3 cm, 18-month VAS=2.2 cm). Crossover patients reported average 55% reduction in sleep disturbance due to pain and 61% improvement in pain interference. There were no significant differences between the crossover results and those observed in patients originally assigned 10-kHz SCS.\n\nThere were no stimulation-related neurological deficits and no explants due to ineffectiveness. There were 6 total explants (3.9%), 5 due to procedure-related infections and 1 as a precaution for endocarditis.\n\nConclusion\n\nSENZA-PDN, the largest RCT to-date of SCS management of PDN, will inform the treatment continuum. Observed short-term results are durable over 18 months for patients with symptoms refractory to conservative care.\n\n215: Can Paddle Spinal Cord Stimulators Be Safely Replaced?\n\nJulie G. Pilitsis, MD PhD (Boca Raton, FL) Tessa Harland, MD – Albany Medical Center; Gregory Topp, MS\n\nIntroduction\n\nPaddle leads for spinal cord stimulation (SCS) offer more streamlined energy delivery and advantages in some patients. However, there is concern for how safely SCS paddles can be replaced once previously implanted due to scar tissue and the relative vulnerability of the thoracic cord. Here we share our experience on redo SCS paddle placement.\n\nMethods\n\nParticipants who underwent SCS replacement at Albany Medical Center between 2011-2020 were identified. The medical records were reviewed for demographic data and information regarding initial complications, reason for removal or revision, subsequent complications of redo surgery, timing of redo surgery, and whether the implant was later removed. Percutaneous lead revision cases performed over the same time period were used as a comparison group.\n\nResults\n\n412 patients were identified to have had a SCS-related procedure based on billing codes. Of these, 41 involved replacement of epidural leads (27 paddles, 14 percutaneous). Most paddles were revised and replaced at the same setting (n = 24; 88.9%). 14 of 27 paddle replacements (51.8%) required an additional laminectomy. Reoperations with initial placement that occurred more than 1 year ago were significantly more likely to require an additional laminectomy (p = 0.0003). Despite the invasive nature of paddle replacement, there was no difference in complications (p = 0.212) or rates of infection when compared to that of percutaneous leads.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe present study is the first to characterize the safety profile of SCS paddle replacement surgeries. Here we demonstrate replacement of paddle leads in the same setting with additional laminectomies if needed due to scar, is associated with low rates of complications. This validates the feasibility and low risk profile of replacing paddle leads when clinically indicated.\n\n216: Surgical Revascularization Decreases Stroke and TIA Risk in Children with Sickle Cell Disease and Moyamoya Syndrome: Results of the Stroke in Sickle Cell Revascularization Study (SiSCRS)\n\nPhilipp R. Aldana MD, FAANS, FAAP (Jacksonville, Florida) Manisha Bansal, Pediatric oncologist; Cynthia Gauger, Pediatric oncologist; corinna Schultz, Pediatric oncologist; Sabrina Han, Medical student; Ricardo Hanel, Physician/Surgeon; Joseph Piatt, Neurosurgeon\n\nIntroduction\n\nRecent studies have suggested that surgical revascularization may be a safe and effective therapy to reduce risk of cerebrovascular complications in patients with sickle cell disease and moyamoya syndrome (SCD-MMS). These studies have been limited by small sample size and lack of a control group for comparison.\n\nOur goal is to investigate whether revascularization surgery reduces the risk of cerebrovascular events (CVEs) in comparison to conservative management alone in a retrospective cohort of children with SCD-MMS.\n\nMethods\n\nA retrospective review of data from 14 major U.S. pediatric neurosurgery centers of SCD-MMS patients (<18 y.o.) was performed. Detailed information on sickle cell disease, stroke and surgical histories were extracted. The incidence of CVEs (stroke and TIAs) between patients treated with surgical revascularization was compared to those with conservative management alone. Multivariate regression models were generated and logistic regression analyses were performed.\n\nResults\n\nA total of 141 patients with SCD-MMS were studied. 78 (55.3%) were treated with conservative management and revascularization surgery (Surgery group) and 63 (44.7%) were treated with conservative management alone (Conservative group). Patients in the Surgery group had reduced odds of developing a CVE over the duration of their risk period (odds ratio = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.08-0.94, P = .040). Furthermore, when comparing patients in the Surgery group during their pre-surgical periods and post-surgical periods, patients had markedly reduced odds of developing a CVE after surgery (odds ratio = 0.22, 95% CI = 0.08-0.58, P = .002). Postoperatively, 5 patients had CVEs and 5 had non CVE complications.\n\nConclusion\n\nOur retrospective study provides strong evidence that revascularization surgery can be performed safely and reduce risk of CVEs in patients with SCD-MM. This is the largest study of its kind to date. A prospective study will be needed to validate these findings.\n\n217: Modeling the Effect of Repetitive Mild Traumatic Brain Injury on Long-term Seizure Risk in Children\n\nMichael C. Jin BS (Menlo Park, California) Adela Wu, MD; Adrian Rodrigues, BA; Solomiia Savchuk, BS; Gabriela Ruiz Colon, BA; Bina Kakusa, MD; Jonathon Parker, MD, PhD; Gerald Grant, MD; Laura Prolo, MD, PhD\n\nIntroduction\n\nMild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) has previously been associated with increased long-term seizure risk. However, the multiplicative impact of repeated mTBIs is not well-established.\n\nMethods\n\nData were extracted from the Optum Clinformatics DataMart database (2003-2021). Children (age <18 years) diagnosed with ≥1 mTBI event were included. Exclusion criteria included prior seizure events or prior antiepileptic drug (AED) use. The primary outcome-of-interest was new-onset seizure. Comorbidities were included based on a 36-factor index previously associated with epilepsy risk in children. Time-varying multivariable Cox regression was used to ascertain the multiplicative impact of multiple mTBI events on long-term seizure risk. A risk-stratification model integrating comorbidities, mTBI characteristics, and demographics was constructed using this framework and validated on a withheld subset (30% of the data) to identify patients with high seizure risk.\n\nResults\n\nA total of 156,118 children were included (median age: 13 years (IQR 9-15). Most children (69.4%) had only one mTBI event, while 30.6% had ≥2 and 6.7% had ≥3 mTBI events. Median follow-up was 1.9 years (IQR 0.8-3.8). Median time to seizure following initial mTBI event was 306 days. Adjusting for demographics, mTBI characteristics, and comorbidities, each repeat mTBI with no loss of consciousness (LOC) resulted in a moderate increase in seizure risk (HR=1.26, 95%CI 1.16-1.36) while each repeat mTBI with brief LOC (<1 hour) resulted in even higher risk increases (HR=2.05, 95%CI 1.89-2.23). Other contributing features included ICU use (HR=2.43, 95%CI 1.96-3.03), subarachnoid hemorrhage (HR=1.74, 95%CI 1.32-2.28), and emergency department admission (HR=1.63, 95%CI 1.32-2.01). The risk-stratification model, which integrates 3 demographic, 6 mTBI-specific, and 14 comorbidity features, identified a patient subset (7.5%) with significantly elevated 5-year seizure risk (4.7-fold; 7.4% [95%CI 6.2-8.6] vs 1.8% [95%CI 1.6-2.1]).\n\nConclusion\n\nOur risk-stratification model identified children at markedly increased risk for seizures following repeated mTBI and can be used to prospectively guide surveillance and early intervention.\n\n218: Predicting Changes in Cranial Index Following Spring Mediated Cranial Vault Expansion in Non-syndromic Sagittal Craniosynostosis: Stepwise and Machine Learning Algorithm Approach\n\nDillan F. Villavisanis BA (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) Sameer Shakir, MD; Daniel Cho, MD, PhD; Chao Zhao, MSc; Christopher Kalmar, MD, MBA; Carlos Barrero, BS; Connor Wagner, BS; Jessica Blum, MSc; Liana Cheung, MBBS; Shih-Shan Chen, MD; Gregory Heuer, MD, PhD; Peter Madsen, MD, MBE; Jordan Swanson, MD, MSc; Scott Bartlett, MD; Jesse Taylor, MD; Alexander Tucker, MD\n\nIntroduction\n\nSpring-mediated cranial vault expansion (SMC) is an increasingly utilized tool in non-syndromic sagittal craniosynostosis but variables impacting outcomes, including bone thickness, are incompletely understood. The aim of this study was to determine variables that interact to predict SMC outcomes, primarily changes in cranial index (CI).\n\nMethods\n\nPatients with non-syndromic sagittal craniosynostosis undergoing SMC at our institution between 2014 and 2021 were included. Clinical data, including CI over time (immediately postoperative; one, three, six months; and one, three, and five years postoperative), were obtained from patient medical records. Skull thickness was determined from patient preoperative CTs using Materalise Mimics. Stepwise selection, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and random forest machine learning methods were used to determine variables most predictive of changes in CI.\n\nResults\n\nOne hundred and twenty-four patients (94 males) with mean surgery age of 3.59 ± 0.87 months and average skull thickness 1.83 ± 0.38 mm were included in this study. Random forest machine learning identified maximum spring force and mean thickness as highly predictive variables with increased in mean squared error (IncMSE) as 0.0173 and 0.0136, respectively, and more predictive than sex (0.0013) and age at surgery (0.0004). In stepwise analysis, maximum spring force (β = 0.108, CI = 0.056 – 0.161, p < 0.001), anterior spring force (β = 0.052, CI = -0.097 – -0.006, p = 0.027), and duration of spring placement (β = 0.002, CI = 0.000 – 0.003, p = 0.046) best predicted changes in CI, and LASSO analysis identified the same three variables as most predictive (β = 0.027, -0.006, 0.0005, respectively).\n\nConclusion\n\nThis study demonstrates maximum spring force, duration of spring placement, and parietal bone thickness may be good predictors of CI changes in patients undergoing SMC. Age at surgery and other demographic variables were inferior predictors in models using our cohort.\n\n219: Effects of Socioeconomic Status on Glial Tumor Survival in Pediatric Populations: A Population-based Study\n\nGabrielle W. Johnson (St. Louis, Missouri) Travis Crevecoeur, MD – Department of Neurosurgery – New York Presbyterian/Columbia; Quinn Ostrom, PhD, MPH – Department of Neurosurgery – Duke University; Mounica Paturu, MD – Department of Neurosurgery – Washington University School of Medicine; Rowland Han, MD, MSCI – Department of Neurosurgery – Washington University School of Medicine; Albert Isaacs, MD, PhD – Department of Neurosurgery – University of Calgary; David Cote, MD, PhD – Department of Neurosurgery – University of Southern California; Joshua Rubin, MD – Department of Pediatrics, Anatomy, and Neurobiology – Washington University School of Medicine; David Limbrick, MD, PhD – Department of Neurosurgery – Washington University School of Medicine\n\nIntroduction\n\nGliomas are relatively common in the pediatric population. While prior studies have examined the differences in glioma survival by various demographics, few have examined the effect of socioeconomic status (SES) on glioma survival in pediatric populations.\n\nMethods\n\nThis was a population-based study of pediatric patients (ages 0-14) using data from the National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR, 2001-2014) and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER, 2000-2015) programs. SES quartiles were created based on data from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series and American Community Survey, defined as Q1 (upper) through Q4 (lowest). Analyses were stratified by race/ethnicity into Non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs), Blacks, American Indians/Alaskan Natives and Asian/Pacific Islanders (AIAN/APIs), and Hispanic Whites (HW). Survival analyses were performed, and hazard ratios are reported.\n\nResults\n\nFor all glioma diagnoses, Q1 had the highest 1-year (89.2%), 5-year (78.5%), and 10-year (75.9%) relative survival, with a linear trend between survival and SES quartile. For the NPCR, Q4 and Q2 had a 27% (1.27, p=0.0004) and 11% (1.11, p=0.0293) higher risk of death, respectively, than Q1. When controlling for SES, HWs had a 40% increased risk (1.40, p<0.0001), blacks a 55% increased risk (1.55, p<0.0001), and AIAN/APIs had a 34% increased risk of death (1.34, p=0.0017) compared to NWHs. Within the SEER, all quartiles had a higher risk of death from glioma than Q1 (Q2: 1.28, p=0.0067; Q3: 1.25, p=0.0179; Q4: 1.32, p=0.0351). When controlling for SES, HWs had a 52% increased hazard of mortality (1.52, p<0.0001) and blacks had a 70% increased hazard of mortality (1.70, p<0.0001) than their WNH counterparts.\n\nConclusion\n\nThere was a linear trend between SES and survival, with Q1 having better survival. When adjusting for SES, all race/ethnicities had a higher risk of death than their NHW counterparts. These findings suggest that glioma survival is influenced by both SES and race.\n\n220: Impact of Syndromic Conditions on Outcomes after Decompression in Children with Type I Chiari Malformation and Syringomyelia: an Analysis of the Park-Reeves Syringomyelia Research Consortium Registry\n\nSolomiia Savchuk BS (Stanford, California) Michael Jin, BS; Alexander Yahanda, MD; Thanda Meehan, BSN; Tammy Bethel-Anderson; Jennifer Strahle, MD; Tae Sung Park, MD; David Limbrick, MD PhD; Gerald Grant, MD; . Park-Reeves Syringomyelia Research Consortium Investigators, NA\n\nIntroduction\n\nPediatric patients with Chiari I Malformation (CM-I) may present with other developmental syndromes in addition to CM-I, yet our understanding of the impact of such concomitant diagnoses on outcomes after posterior fossa decompression (PFD) is limited.\n\nMethods\n\nA database of clinical information from CM-I patients enrolled in the Park-Reeves Syringomyelia Research Consortium at 36 clinical sites was created. Here only patients receiving PFD were included and were identified as syndromic based on prior diagnoses of Ehlers-Danlos, neurofibromatosis type I, Noonan, Costello, Kabuki, Crouzon, Pierre-Robin, Goldenhar, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndromes, megalencephaly capillary malformation, or cystic fibrosis. Primary outcome-of-interest was six-month postoperative complication rate; secondary included in-hospital outcomes (duration of stay, blood loss, and operating time) and redo PFD risk.\n\nResults\n\nThe cohort included 884 patients (median age=10.2, range 0.7-20.6 years; 514 (58.1%) female gender). 959 PFDs were performed, with 70 patients receiving at least one redo PFD (median time to redo=8.3 months). Of all PFDs, 757 (85.6%) were performed with duraplasty. In total, 37 patients were considered syndromic. Age, pre-operative radiological measurements, and general medical comorbidities were comparable between syndromic and non-syndromic patients. Elevated blood loss (≥50ml) was more frequent among syndromic patients (43.8% vs 21.1%, □2 p = 0.003). On average, syndromic patients had 20.0% longer hospitalizations durations (19.5% vs 7.7% ≥7 days, Fisher Exact p=0.015). Six-month all-cause postoperative complication risk and redo PFD rate were not different in syndromic patients. However, CSF leak was significantly more common in syndromic patients compared to non-syndromic counterparts (15.2% vs 3.9%, □2 p = 0.002) and more frequently required external CSF drainage (21.2% vs 4.4%, □2 p<0.001). Rate of occipitocervical fusion at initial PFD was higher for syndromic patients (5.4% vs 1.1%, □2 p = 0.020).\n\nConclusion\n\nSyndromic children with CM-I receiving PFD may be at higher risk for prolonged hospitalizations and post-operative CSF complications.\n\n221: Novel 3D Modeling of Brain and Ventricular Compliance in Children with Hydrocephalus Using Deformation-based Morphometry\n\nMichael Zhang MD (Stanford, California) Matthias Wilms, PhD; Nils Forkert, PhD; Shannon Beres, MD; Heather Moss, MD PhD; Kristen Yeom, MD; Gerald Grant, MD\n\nIntroduction\n\nHydrocephalus is a challenging condition to treat in children as patients may present with nonspecific symptoms and ventricles may exhibit varying tissue compliance. Typical assessments of ventricular responsiveness are only qualitative and limited to the ventricular space even though stress and shear forces extend across the brain. Here we present a novel visualization of brain compliance following treatment of hydrocephalus by topographically projecting the magnitude of deformation experienced at the voxel-level.\n\nMethods\n\nWe identified a series of pediatric patient with acute, initial presentations of obstructive hydrocephalus and with pre- and post-operative spoiled gradient recalled echo T1-weighted MRI imaging. We confirmed ventricular responsiveness by first measuring changes in ventricular volume between imaging pairs. To subsequently visualize deformation (affine and non-linear elements), we aligned image pairs with ANTs-based rigid registration and then overlaid post-operative on pre-operative images. We use the calculated voxel transformations to derive two visualizations of compliance: (1) a 2D-vector map projecting the resulting deformation field on structural brain MRI and (2) a 3D-heat map projecting the volumetric responsiveness of baseline ventricular boundaries.\n\nResults\n\n10 children with diverse pathologies underwent definitive treatment of their hydrocephalus. There was a significant reduction in ventricular volume (150.3 cm3 to 84.9 cm3, p value = 0.0032, paired t-test) following all interventions. Deformation vectors were with the greatest change along the lateral ventricular spaces, relative to the genu and splenium. There was a trend towards proportionally reduced vector magnitudes within the cortical layer with increasing age (p = 0.0693, Pearson).\n\nConclusion\n\nWe present 3D modeling for displaying the measure of centripetal deformation following ventricular intervention for hydrocephalus. Such vector-based changes in brain topography enables visualization of dynamic deformational change in the brain after treatment of the hydrocephalus.\n\n223: Intra-arterial Transplantation of Mitochondria After Ischemic Stroke Reduces Cerebral Infarction\n\nM. Yashar S. Kalani MD, PhD, MBA, FAANS (Irvine, California) Pedro Norat, MD; Jennifer Sokolowski, MD, PhD; Catherine Gorick, PhD; Melanie Walker, MD; Michael Levitt, MD; Richard Price, PhD; Petr Tvrdik, PhD\n\nIntroduction\n\nMitochondria are powerhouses of the cell and are responsible for metabolic homeostasis during normal and pathological conditions. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been associated with secondary injury after cerebral ischemia. We postulated that transplantation of mitochondria into ischemic brain may mitigate injury caused by ischemia.\n\nMethods\n\nWe used biochemical methods to purify autologous mitochondria from a single punch biopsy of skeletal muscle. The mitochondria were assayed for biological activity. Using mouse models of cerebral ischemia and reperfusion, we delivered viable mitochondria to ischemic brain parenchyma via an intra-arterial route. Using high-frequency focused ultrasound, we selectively opened the blood brain barrier over ischemic penumbra and assessed change in delivery of intra-arterial mitochondria and incorporation by various cell types. Using magnetic resonance imaging guided high-frequency ultrasound we assessed safety of selective blood brain barrier opening after cerebral ischemia.\n\nResults\n\nPurification of active mitochondria can be performed with minimal biochemical means within 15 minutes of a punch biopsy. The yield of mitochondria isolated is in the order of 10^9. Following delivery, mitochondria distribute through the stroked hemisphere and integrate into neural and glial cells in the brain parenchyma. Consistent with functional integration in the ischemic tissue, the transplanted mitochondria elevate concentration of adenosine triphosphate in the stroked hemisphere, reduce infarct volume and increase cell viability relative to controls.\n\nConclusion\n\nMitochondria can be isolated in pure form in a clinically relevant time scale. The purified cellular components are biologically active. They can be readily administered intra-arterially into a stroke bed. The delivery of mitochondria can be enhanced via selective opening of the blood brain barrier using focused ultrasound. The mitochondria incorporate into cellular components of the central nervous system, thereby increasing viability. This represents a novel treatment strategy that can be combined with endovacular thrombectomy to aid in the improvement of outcomes after large vessel occlusion.\n\n224: Non-invasive Vagus Nerve Stimulation to Mitigate Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Induced Inflammation: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial\n\nLouise Eisenhardt Travel Scholarship\n\nAnna Huguenard MD (St Louis, Missouri) Gabrielle Johnson, BA – Medical Student, Neurosurgery, Washington University School of Medicine; Andrew Coxon, BS – Medical Student, Neurosurgery, Washington University School of Medicine; Gregory Zipfel, MD – Chair, Department of Neurosurgery, Neurosurgery, Washington University School of Medicine; Peter Brunner, PhD – Associate Professor of Neurosurgery and Biomedical Engineering, Neurosurgery, Washington University School of Medicine; Eric Leuthardt, MD – Professor of Neurological Surgery, Neurosurgery, Washington University School of Medicine\n\nIntroduction\n\nInflammation plays an important role in morbidity following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) provides a novel, non-pharmacologic, non-invasive approach to immunomodulation with potential to improve outcomes in SAH.\n\nMethods\n\nPatients with SAH were randomized to taVNS or sham stimulation with patient, medical team, and outcomes assessor blinded to treatment arm. Patients underwent twice daily treatments, and plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were collected every three days to quantify inflammatory markers. Rates of cerebral vasospasm and chronic hydrocephalus were assessed, and functional outcomes via modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores were collected.\n"
