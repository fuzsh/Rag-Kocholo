This was the second conference organized by the newly founded Research Center on Symbolism that goes under the title Art, Literature and Music in Symbolism and Decadence. The first conference (“Symbolism, Its Origins and Its Consequences”) took place in 2009 and the conference proceedings were published in 2010. It addressed the issue of the complex origins of the Symbolist movement and its legacy in 20th-century art and literature. Art, Literature and Music in Symbolism and Decadence is an affiliated society of the College Art Association and it sponsored four sessions (2011, 2013-2015) at CAA. The Center also organized and sponsored two sessions at the International Congress of Comparative Literature in Paris in 2013 and two sessions at the American Comparative Literature conference in Seattle in 2015, which addressed not only the issues pertaining to the Symbolist movement per se, but to the origins of this movement and especially to its role in the evolution of art and literature of the twentieth century. The conference on light and darkness, however, is one of the most important events sponsored by the organization. Like the first conference in 2009, its goal was to promote the interdisciplinary and international nature of the Symbolist movement, as well as the role of the Symbolist movement in the development of art and literature in the twentieth century. Therefore the conference presentations centered on art, literature and music of different countries from a variety of periods. Since in the Symbolist movement visual arts and works of literature were intrinsically connected, its interdisciplinary connections are reflected in several papers which, while analyzing works of art, also weave in their inseparable connection to literary culture. The idea of light and darkness is one of the central ideas of the\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nSymbolist movement, since this is a movement of contrasts. It encompasses central themes of Symbolism such as good and evil, beauty and ugliness, the visible and invisible, the divine and earthly. This volume consists of twenty-two articles and is divided into six parts. Part One is dedicated to architecture and stained glass. Part Two contains essays strictly on visual arts: engravings, works on paper, and paintings. Part Three combines the discussion of visual arts (painting, engravings, works on paper) and literature, when both are interwoven. Part Four discusses Symbolist sculpture. Part Five is on literary works, and the final section, Part Six, is dedicated to music. Part One, Architecture and Stained Glass, contains two articles: “Symbolist Aspects of Macintosh’s Architecture” by Larry Shiner and “Symbolist Interiors: Figures, Light, and Colors in Early TwentiethCentury Italian Stained Glass” by Lucia Mannini. “Symbolist Aspects of Mackintosh's Architecture” introduces readers to the interior design of Charles Rennie Mackintosh and his wife Margaret and to Mackintosh's architectural works. Shiner asks whether we are “justified in considering Mackintosh’s architecture as having a Symbolist and not just symbolic tendencies?” He shows that in his interior design Mackintosh created an interior that has a Symbolist soul and his usages of light play an important role. According to Shiner however, Mackintosh is only partially Symbolist and only partially embraced the ideas of the Symbolist movement, particularly because “Mackintosh was too creative and too much of an individualist to fit comfortably into any of the art historical categories that have been associated with his work, whether Symbolist, Art Nouveau, or Arts and Crafts.” Mannini in her article asserts that “the coloured glass, both luminous and opalescent, enclosing the space but not confining it, was effectively very congenial to the Symbolist metaphorical vision of reality,” because “stained glass was suited to the illusionistic vision, with the taste for the artificial,” essential in Symbolism and especially favored by Symbolist literature, for example in Huysmans' novel A rebours. Part Two, on visual arts, consists of four articles. The article “The Symbolist Path of Armand Point” by Robert Dore examines different Symbolist themes relating to women such as death, hair, Christianity, mythology, etc. that Point explored in his art. Joelle Joffe in “Light and Shadow in The Dream by Odilon Redon” inquires into the role of chiaroscuro in Redon’s noirs. Adapting a psychoanalytical approach, she argues that Redon’s chiaroscuro “is not a technique of representation. It is evidence of the gaze of the artist, the core of a man who is looking for a solution to his distress or what Freud called\n\nLight and Obscurity in Symbolism\n\n3\n\n'Hilfslosigkeit' or helplessness.” She demonstrates that through light and shadows of his noirs and chiaroscuro, Redon conveys the undetermined state of his suffering soul and the effect that his childhood had on him. In her article, she also explains how the Symbolist movement allows the process of evocation through minimalist images of light and shadow. Irena Kossowska in her article “A Flight from Colour: The Aesthetics of Black-and-White in Polish Symbolism,” analyzing the works of Polish Symbolist artists who she often compares to Western European artists such as Whistler and Rembrandt, explains that etching could be perceived as “a perfect vehicle for creating imaginary worlds,” while quoting Siedlecki that “etching is ideal for Dionysiac dreams, it marks . . . the threatening opposition between brightness and the depth of darkness.” By introducing the reader to the notion of the metaphysics of night in etching, Kossowska demonstrates that in order to personify anxiety, apathy, melancholy, the blackness of night is often represented through “the tenebrous extreme of monochromatic depiction” and through blurring the contours of objects. In her discussion of the metaphysics of sex, Kossowska shows that in order to stress the negative view of a woman whose image dominates the turn of the century art and literature as well as social perception, Polish etchers represented a woman in shapeless patches of aquatint (in Moulin Rouge for example), or in colour that would contrast with the background of the story. For example, Kossowska points out that “the contrast between light and shadow comes into focus in Weiss's etched nocturne Place Vendôme w ParyĪu, 1900 (Place Vendôme in Paris),” so the woman would be represented as a white female figure “tempting the viewer to plunge into the whirl of the metropolis' nightlife.” Kossowska asserts that the art of etching began to disappear in the early 20th century in order to give space to art posters, an emerging new form of art that would eventually replace etching. Jonathan Perkins in “Fantastic Nature: Associations between Paul Klee and Odilon Redon” shows the similarities between Odilon Redon and Paul Klee, which especially arise in their depictions of nature. Perkins stresses the fact that for both artists the representation of nature “might be termed a pseudo-scientific approach with a deeply personal impulse inspired by a desire to approach the spiritual.” Part Three, “Visual Arts, Literature and Philosophy,” the largest part of the book, consists of articles that address the works of visual arts such as painting, engravings, or works on paper and their relationship to literature and philosophy. Deborah Cibelli’s “The Duality of Light in Rossetti’s Ekphrastic Poems and Paintings” analyzes three Rossetti’s ekphrastic paintings The\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\nGirlhood of Mary Virgin, Ecce Ancilla Domini (The Annunciation), and The Blessed Damozel. Deborah Cibelli demonstrates how Rossetti, “using motifs from the Renaissance, contrasted the earthly and heavenly realms and conveyed the idea that light had the ability to unify the earthly and the spiritual and to represent transcendence.” Cibelli explains that “Rossetti used light to separate and distinguish earth from heaven, to create a celestial hierarchy, and to represent physical form imbued with spiritual beauty.” She explains that Rossetti’s white palette in Ecce Ancilla Domini is enhanced by his treatment of light. She stresses the importance of ekphrasis in Rossetti’s poetry as a way to translate in words the range of colors through the description of emotions, derived from paintings’ colors and light. We learn that Rossetti’s work was shaped by the conception of painting as mute poetry and by his perception of his paintings as “silent poems.” Cibelli also shows that light played an important role in the representation of the transcendent qualities, especially in the depiction of woman, whose “beauty was embodied in the woman inherent to ‘four fantasies,’ which included ‘the beautiful woman in heaven, femmes fatales, sinful women who appeal for help, and the victimized women who cannot be saved (Sonstroem 1970, 3-4).’” Cibelli’s analysis convinces readers that “Rossetti developed an aesthetic sense of beauty based upon a duality of light.” Peter Cooke’s article “The Ideal and Matter: Gustave Moreau’s Ambiguous Dualities” stresses Moreau’s constant interplay of complex dualities of an allegorical light and darkness. Cooke asserts that “the artist saw life in terms of the play of interdependent polar opposites founded on the essential duality of the Ideal and Matter.” To these ends, Cooke examines Moreau’s paintings such as Oedipus and the Sphinx, in which “the beautiful yet monstrous sphinx both attracts with its feminine face and breast and repels with its feline animal body,” Orpheus and Salome of 1876, The Chimeras, and Jupiter and Semele. In analyzing Oedipus and the Sphinx Cooke demonstrates how this painting could be interpreted allegorically “as an idealist affirmation of the superiority of mind over matter, of the ideal over the treacherous promises of earthly honours, power and glory,” or how it “could be read as a comment on the sensuality of the mythological nude,” or as a mythological temptation of St Anthony presenting a form of “iconographical syncretism, mingling pagan mythology with a Christian subject.” As Cooke states in his conclusion Moreau’s world “is a world of co-existing dualities, of unresolved contradictions in which the Ideal and Matter are eternally co-dependent, forever locked together, in both iconography and style.” “Edward Burne-Jones’ The Sirens” by Liana de Girolami Cheney\n\nLight and Obscurity in Symbolism\n\n5\n\nstresses the duality of the Sirens, their “light” beautiful appearance and dark hidden nature. As Cheney argues, “the siren in Burne-Jones’ painting functions much like the Symbolist conception of the femme fatale because the siren evokes the dual symbolism of water, represented in light and darkness, as the source of life and death.” Girolami Cheney stresses that in Burne-Jones’ painting and studies, the Sirens are beautifully portrayed creatures with slender beauty “revealed through the wet drapery motif while their gentle expressions conceal their sinister plan.” Alison Hokanson in “The Soul of Things: Henri de Brakeleer as a Forerunner of the Treatment of Light in Belgian Symbolism” demonstrates de Brakeleer's influence on the “portrayal” of light of the Belgian Symbolist artists. She argues that De Braekeleer, as a Realist artist, was the first to “paint” the light of the interior as an embodiment of the emotional and psychological events that occurred in the given location. She analyzes how Belgian Symbolist artists borrowed from de Brakeleer the ability to paint light and how instead of depicting “a mirror of a person's psyche” as did de Brakeleer, their depiction of light created an interior space “with its own soul.” Liesbeth Grotenhuis in her article “Isis’ Fingertips: A Symbolist Reading of Lévy-Dhurmer’s Silence”, a study of the work Silence by Lucien Lévy-Dhurmer discloses the complex meaning of the initiate figure of Silence which takes us from darkness to light through the long history of the process of initiation. François Lachance-Provençal in his article “Apollo’s Triumph. The Notion of Art for Art’s Sake at the Center of Nietzsche and Redon’s Parallel Shifts from Darkness to Light” explores the duality of Apollonian versus Dionysian aesthetics in Nietzsche’s Birth of Tragedy and how that aesthetics could be perceived in parallel with Odilon Redon’s aesthetics of art for art’s sake. Although he demonstrates that “this attempt at a comparative study of a philosopher and a painter was meant, in a way, to illustrate the difficulty, even the impossibility, of using Nietzsche’s aesthetics as a tool in pictorial analysis,” Lachance-Provençal argues that Redon’s earlier art, his “Noirs” are a reflection of Dionysian aesthetics, whereas his later works, works of colors, irradiate “contagious fullness and love of life,” the result of Apollonian aesthetics. The article “The Androgyne, the Transvestite and the Herm: Aubrey Beardsley’s Hybrid Forms for the Yellow Book, Volume III” by Britten LaRue examines Beardsley’s four illustrations Portrait of Himself, Lady Gold’s Escort, The Wagnerites, and La Dame aux Camélias and explains the reasons for the sexual duality of his images. She argues that Beardsley creates the new area of illumination, the area of the third sex expressed in\n\n6\n\nIntroduction\n\nthe androgyne, the transvestite and the herm. She demonstrates that “These hybrid figures are not false identities, but empowering forms. Their presence in his illustrations marks the field of the image as a redeeming space which permits independence, autonomy and freedom from the constraints of the world outside the frame.” “Reflections of Mallarmé: A Comparative Study of Manet’s A Bar at the Folies-Bergère” by Marguerite Li Bassi explores the relationship between Stéphane Mallarmé and Édouard Manet. She argues that these relationships greatly affected both artists. She demonstrates how Mallarmé's view of poetry and some of his poems served as an inspiration for Manet's painting A Bar at the Folies-Bergère. She explains how “the Bar’s topography concomitantly recreates Mallarmé’s favorite paradoxes: reality/dream, absence/presence, exterior/interior, sacred/profane, allusion/description.” Anna Mazzanti's “From 'Fuoco' to 'Notturno': The Interpretation of Light and Shade in d’Annunzio’s Work by His Friends Among Italian Symbolist Illustrators” introduces readers to illustrators of works by the Italian poet and writer Gabriel d'Annunzio. In her article, Mazzanti compares Redon's images inspired by literature with the images inspired by d'Annunzio's literary works. She explains the essential difference between Redon's works and the images that were created to illustrate d'Annunzio's works. She stresses the idea of an illustration in d'Annunzio's case as opposed to the idea of an evocation in works by Redon. She explains that like the Symbolist French writer Huysmans, d'Annunzio promoted art in his literary works. Mazzanti examines a variety of artistic techniques that were used at the turn of the century to illustrate literary works. She shows their similarities with the Pre-Raphaelites, the importance of monochromatic light in lithography, and the development of illustrations in which the woodcutters “preferred a greater clarity of light and shade, abandoning the 'school which gropes in the darkness.'” Rosina Neginsky in her article “The Dual Nature of Beheadings: Moreau and Redon” explains the different meanings – light and dark, positive and negative – of the decapitated heads in Moreau’s and Redon’s works. Part Four, “Sculpture,” contains two articles on Symbolist sculpture. This is an area little studied but filled with potential. The article “Art Between Luminous Fluidity and Expressionist Shading: Defining Symbolist Sculpture Using Modeling” by Dominique Jarassé is of particular interest since it explains what type of sculptures could be treated as a part of the Symbolist movement and the role of light, in particular luminosity and shadows, in making sculpture Symbolist. Jarassé\n\nLight and Obscurity in Symbolism\n\n7\n\nespecially focuses on sculptures of the Russian Jewish sculptor, Naoum Aronson, whose work Jarassé describes in the following way: “Here we immediately encounter the dual Baudelairean postulation inherent in Symbolism, the ambivalent nature – profoundly mystical and human – of the Symbolist aesthetic, an aspiration towards the Ideal and the distress caused by a confrontation with the real and with society.” The most important feature of Aronson, as Jarassé demonstrates, is to be able to convey “the 'flow of inner life,'” the psychology of his subjects through light and lines, in ways similar and different from Rodin, who was partially Aronson's inspiration. Jarrassé explains that Aronson's works are interesting not only for their humanistic value, but also artistically. He shows that “by using the double potential of modelling, and by mastering the language of light and shade, Aronson was able, at the same time as Rodin, to produce a profoundly Symbolist work by combining the two idealistic and expressionistic tendencies.” The analysis of Symbolist sculpture encourages Jarassé to provide a definition of it as “a use of the potential of the modelling, understood as the French ‘modelé’.” Susan Martis in “Light, Obscurity and Symbolist Themes in American Sculpture, 1890-1920” examines the works of the American sculptors George Grey Barnard, Lorado Taft and Malvina Hoffman. Martis demonstrates that Barnard and Taft, being particularly sensitive to the effects of light and shadow, “manipulated them by leaving portions of their works unfinished . . .” Martis explains that one of Taft’s techniques was his ability to create a contrast between emotions represented through exaggerated gestures and the universality of his subjects’ garments. Malvina Hoffman came after Barnard and Taft, when the Symbolist technique in sculpture was already put in place. Hoffman was specifically interested in the body’s reactions to a variety of emotions, such as the body’s response to music, passion, and spirituality. She tried to create sculpture which captures the movement of the soul. Martis stresses that Hoffman was also an art critic. In her book Sculpture Inside and Out (1939), she argues that any object created must be “infused with the passionate essence of your own thought,” so the result will be “the merging of matter and spirit.” Part Five, “Literature,” includes three articles. In his article “Light and Darkness in Dostoevsky’s White Nights and Kafka’s ‘Hunger Artist,’” Brent Judd argues that “contrasting opposites, whether they be light and darkness, body and soul, or real and imaginary, are the privileged points of access to the truth that the artist seeks to uncover.” Judd compares the encounter of the Dreamer and Nasten’ka in White Nights with the relationship of the hunger artist and the audience/overseer in “Hunger\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\nArtist.” He explains that the encounter of opposites is necessary for the production of art and shows that both Dostoevsky and Kafka bring us to the understanding “that Meaning is encountered only in the absence that opposites expose. Light has no meaning without darkness,” and “the truth otherwise hidden” could be revealed through art, the result of the encounter of opposites, the intersection necessary for creativity. Natalia Gamalova in “Colored Lighting in the Poetry of Innokentij Annenskij” analyses Annenskij's rich usage of colors in his literary works. She explains that Annenskij's aspiration for colors comes from classical culture, but his usage of colors in his poetry gives his work a Symbolist flavor. Luba Jurgenson in her article “Anguish and Modernist Aesthetics” asserts that the Symbolist movement created a new worldview, which lives in dark, light, and in shadow. She contends that the new worldview reflects new human experiences for which there was no language, therefore it caused the creation of a language to express that new experience, a new reality. Jurgenson shows that this reality, as well as the language that describes it, are rooted in anguish, negation and a vacuum. Part Six, “Music,” contains one article, “Symbolic Touch in the Playing of Debussy’s Piano Music” by Jean-Pierre Armengaud. In this article Armengaud argues that Debussy’s symbolism is very suggestive and that quality is specifically achieved through “first and foremost a symbolism of opposites. . .” such as “immobility/movement, clear image/ blurred resonances, repetition/intermittence, distance/precision or proximity, physicality/sublimity, pale/colorful, narrative/silence, desire for life/ languishing death…his music favors nuance over discourse and the infinite gradation of timbres over the pursuit of a musical construction.” This volume consists of a range of studies for understanding the notion of light and darkness and a variety of its Symbolist interpretations. The articles acknowledge the complexity of meaning attached to light and darkness. They discuss and examine these images’ significance for iconography, subject matter, and for aesthetics. The studies stress the interdisciplinary nature of light and darkness in Symbolism as well as a cohabitation and a symbiosis of both, which are together or separately at the core of the Symbolist movement.\n\nPART ONE: ARCHITECTURE AND STAINED GLASS\n\nCHAPTER ONE SYMBOLIST ASPECTS OF MACKINTOSH’S ARCHITECTURE LARRY SHINER\n\nAlthough the existence of a Symbolist stream in late nineteenthcentury literature and painting is widely accepted, there have been few attempts to determine if there was also a Symbolist tendency in architecture. The dominant architectural approach in the nineteenth century, of course, was Historicism, which meant designing buildings in one of the historical styles, Classical, Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance and so on. Even the Symbolist painter, Franz von Stuck, designed his own villa in a Renaissance style. The one genuinely new architectural and design approach at the end of the century, Art Nouveau is often treated simply as a curvilinear, organic style and an architectural dead end. But some have argued that Art Nouveau also had affinities with the contemporaneous Symbolist movement in literature and painting, and, among those considered Art Nouveau architects, Antonio Gaudi and Charles Rennie Mackintosh are most often mentioned as reflecting Symbolist tendencies. Of course, all architecture has a symbolic aspect whether in the more general sense of a poetics of space or in the more specific sense of using traditional symbols. Thus, we need to identify some criteria for distinguishing a specifically Symbolist approach to architecture from a traditional symbolic approach. First, with respect to method or approach, Symbolists typically avoided explicit statement in favor of suggestion or indirection. This was part of a more general tendency of Symbolists to emphasize imagination and subjectivity over reason. Thus, although Gaudi’s celebrated Sagrada Família church deploys strangely biomorphic versions of traditional symbols, the façade of his delightful Casa Batlló has more suggestive\n\nSymbolist Aspects of Mackintosh’s Architecture\n\n11\n\nelements such as the famous balconies – are they insect or dragon faces, or perhaps carnival masks? Second, with respect to content, Symbolists tended to reject the sciences and the ideal of progress in favor of spirituality and mystical transcendence, often turning to occult movements. Within that general context, Symbolists dwelt on a variety of themes, although the motifs of decadence, sexuality and death have become notorious. In Gaudi’s Casa Milà, spirit and nature seem to come together in a kind of living organism, with its cell like entry, its twining balconies and, on the roof, the alternately comic and menacing chimney pots. Yet one finds little evidence of the decadent and morbid side of Symbolism either here or in Gaudi’s other buildings. Finally, one can, of course, suggest that an architect or a particular project had an important direct or indirect connection to the work of painters, sculptors, or writers who are typically associated with the Symbolist movement. The first two criteria, the preference for indirection or suggestion and the emphasis on spiritualist content, are easier to explore in literature and painting than architecture, since the latter has a practical dimension that must, after all, call on science and technology. Hence, works of architecture will inevitably be a compromise between form and function, decoration and construction that would tend to restrain Symbolist subjectivity. In a previous paper, I argued that there were typical Symbolist elements of indirection and spirituality in Joseph Maria Olbrich’s Secession building in Vienna and also indicated the association of Olbrich, Klimt and other Secession members with artists usually considered part of the Symbolist movement.1 In this essay, I will focus on these topics in the work and career of Charles Rennie Mackintosh since he seems to have had more direct connections to the larger Symbolist movement than Gaudi. Like most late nineteenth-century architects, Mackintosh thought of the challenge of producing a genuinely modern (rather than Historicist) architecture in terms of the relation between construction and decoration. Of course, other emerging modernists of the time, like Adolf Loos, believed any kind of decoration or ornament was a “crime” and somewhat later Mies van der Rohe would capture the anti-decoration argument in his famous slogan, “less is more.” By the mid-twentieth century, the antidecoration view had become orthodoxy and Art Nouveau, with which architectural historians usually associated Mackintosh and Gaudi, was considered a wrong headed and aborted experiment. It was only with the arrival of post-modern architectural theory that people like Robert Venturi would dare to say “less is a bore” and retrospectively celebrate the work of\n\n12\n\nChapter One\n\narchitects like Mackintosh for their creative combination of construction and decoration. One specific reason it makes more sense to explore Mackintosh’s architecture in relation to Symbolism than it does the work of Gaudi is that early in his career, through a circle of young women who were Mackintosh’s fellow students at the Glasgow School of Art, he came under the influence of several artists and writers we now consider Symbolists. At the time, Mackintosh and his friend, Herbert McNair, worked for an architectural firm by day, took classes at the School of Art at night and often spent their weekends with the “Immortals,” as the group of young women artists jokingly called themselves. The most talented among the “Immortals” were Frances and Margaret Macdonald whose drawings and paintings using plant-like and erotically charged female figures reflect the sinuous line of Beardsley and Toorop, and to allude to themes in Maeterlinck, three figures now associated with “Symbolist” art and literature. In the early 1890s, Mackintosh began painting Symbolist themed and styled watercolors like Harvest Moon (1892), with its erotically entangled figures, and the highly personal Tree of Influence (1895) whose allusive meanings are hard to pin down. Soon Macintosh and McNair, had paired off with the Macdonald sisters, the group coming to be known at “The Four.” Among other work, the Four produced some striking posters for Glasgow exhibitions and came to be known around Glasgow as “The Spook School,” an indication that others recognized what would later be called the Symbolist character of their work at this time. Eventually, Margaret and Charles married and their collaborations deepened. Although one can often assign individual pieces to one or the other of them during the early years of their relationship, the overall effect of the rooms they designed together must be ascribed to both, and although they are rightly associated with Art Nouveau, I believe these interiors also deserve the label Symbolist. The Macintosh’s apartment followed a conventional separation of dark masculine spaces like the dining room from the feminine identified white spaces of the drawing room and bedroom. The cheval-de-frise mirror in the bedroom is a tour de force in whose sides some see an erotically charged female curve. Both Margaret and Charles were invited to Vienna by the Secessionist group in 1901 to take part in an exhibition in the Secession’s new building, a building which is itself an example of what could legitimately called a Symbolist tendency in architecture. The room Charles and Margaret created at the Secession had the cheval mirror and a chair from their apartment along with a gesso panel by Margaret above.\n\nSymbolist Aspects of Mackintosh’s Architecture\n\n13\n\nToday, Charles Rennie Mackintosh is best known to the general public for his furniture and for the various Glasgow tea rooms he designed with Margaret. The first tea room, on Buchanan street, is notable for a wall panel based on Charles Rennie’s 1896 painting of Margaret, which echoes the Symbolist work to which she had introduced him. But the most famous of the tea rooms is The Willow of 1903, for which Charles and Margaret designed several distinct dining areas. Of all the rooms, the upstairs Room de Luxe is where we see the Mackintoshes’ most brilliant work. Much of the symbolism here is drawn from the idea of the willow, the tall chair backs forming a kind of willow woods. But the familiar rose motif dear to Margaret is also omnipresent and a large part of the effect comes from the color palette of gray and violet along with the judicious use of leaded glass heavy with curving plant forms. In 1902 the firm in which Mackintosh became a partner got a commission for a large house whose exterior design reflects what is sometimes called his Romantic Nationalist, sometimes his Arts and Crafts side. Despite the modernist flavor of the wide expanses of white stucco on the exterior, the design alludes to Scottish vernacular in its massing and towers. On the other hand, the interiors are a stunning example of the approach he and Margaret first developed with their own flat, the darker hallways and dining room, giving way to the brilliant off white of the drawing room with its specially designed furniture— including an unusual chair and a square black table. The bedroom is another tour de force in white accented with spots of color. As always, all the furnishings, including chairs, curtains, and carpets, were new designs by Charles Renne Mackintosh, although it is possible Margaret had some role. So far, I have focused on the Mackintoshes’ joint interior design work. One of the dangers attending the search for indirect and suggestive symbolism in this work is over-interpretation. Some writers have been too quick to see sexual allusions in every upright and curve. I find the interiors of the Mackintoshes to be sensual, occasionally even erotic, but, if they are sexual, it is a sexuality of a much sunnier sort than we find in a good deal of Symbolist writing and painting. To that extent it should either be considered non-Symbolist, or, better yet, evidence that our view of what constitutes “Symbolist” art and architecture needs to be enlarged. Mackintosh’s major architectural work and his undoubted masterpiece is the Glasgow School of Art, designed and built in two stages (1897-1899 and 1907-1909). Despite Mackintosh deep belief in his vocation as an artist, he freely accepted the constraints of the program set by the Board of Directors who required suitable spaces for studio classes, exhibitions, study, research, and administration.\n\n14\n\nChapter One\n\nThe great windows across the north façade give the building a somewhat austere, modernist look, but closer examination shows that there are also many ornamental details that determine its distinctive character. For example, the ironwork on the windows has horizontal bars to hold the window cleaner’s boards, but also upward curving iron tendrils, ending in roseate globes. Mackintosh understandably set his most elaborate symbolic details in a dignified and complex central section of the facade. The tension between the straight and arched, and the protruding and receding elements is complemented by many small details, some in iron, others in stone, such as the striking stone relief over the door, showing two female figures whose shape echoes the Symbolist themes of the Four. The east end of the building has another complex composition of receding and protruding shapes, adorned with delightful touches like the false tower complete with a spirited finial. Here, as elsewhere, Mackintosh shows that his suggestive symbolism can take a humorous turn often lacking in works considered to exemplify the Symbolist mainstream. When the art school finally had the money to build the west wing, Mackintosh produced another fascinating and complex work. Its most dramatic external feature is the set of enormously high oriel windows that light the library. And then there is the striking entry with its protruding, almost art deco surround; it has been used as a model for bookends. Is this architectural imagination run riot? It verges on pure play, yet Mackintosh knew how to integrate these intense and sometimes playful elements in a way that gives vitality to the whole. As for the interior, neither the architectural program nor the budget had a place for any sort of grand atrium to greet one, although the stairwell leading up to the offices, classrooms and museum/gallery on the upper floor does have dignity and interest; but here again the devil is in the details. Consider the great posts that reach up two stories or more and are given flat caps that seem to hover in the air above the second level. Or consider the wooden trusses of the museum ceiling with their bows and central paddles containing cutouts. If we compare these to the trusses of the anatomy and the life drawing classrooms, we see that Mackintosh’s restless imagination will not let him use some standard form or even repeat his own forms. A similar originality applies to the Director’s office and the Board Room, one light, the other dark, the darker Board Room fit out with Mackintosh’s riff on the classical pilaster, perhaps a jab at the Board’s conservatism which often led them to resist aspects of his design. And we must not forget the small colored glass insets he designed for many of the building’s doors. One is hard pressed to say exactly what each of\n\nSymbolist Aspects of Mackintosh’s Architecture\n\n15\n\nMackintosh’s decorative elements in stone, iron, wood, or glass symbolizes. Do they allude to hidden meanings, or are they intended only to remind us that this is an art school, where imaginative creation is the main business? Finally, we come to the library, lighted from outside by those enormous oriel windows and from within by Mackintosh’s hanging lanterns (electric lights were a relatively new technology) whose geometric design would not be out of place in a contemporary building. In the library, the wooden posts are surely a tree symbol, becoming a veritable forest, a dark place of meditation and reflection, yet at the same time it has openings that draw in light and create movement, the whole unified by Mackintosh’s big magazine rack and table in the center opening. One should also notice the way he has set back the balcony and decorated this set back with carved and brightly colored up rights, small spots of color that enliven and bring a note of gaiety into a darkly sensuous space. One might argue that the library is indeed a “Symbolist” work in the sense that it seems full of suggestive and indirect meanings; it sets our imagination to work, giving it much to contemplate but shaping no definite thought. The library spaces and details, like the many symbolic elements in the exterior iron work, or the many colored glass insets in the doors, reflect a suggestive approach similar to that of other Symbolist art forms, although Mackintosh was also quite capable of more direct symbolic references, such as the classical notes in the Board Room or the decorative tower and dummy dovecote on the exterior façade that echo Scottish Baronial architecture. Considered as a whole, the Glasgow School of Art is replete with both symbolism and Symbolist tendencies, but it is at the same time an eminently practical building that has been in continuous use for over a hundred years and still serves its purposes very well. Are we justified in considering Mackintosh’s architecture as having a Symbolist and not just symbolic tendencies? We have seen some evidence in favor of it. But Mackintosh himself made remarks in two of his rare lectures that show he consciously embraced the approach of using suggestion or indirection, and at the same time an emphasis on some of the spiritual and mystical elements we associate with Symbolism, although not its rejection of technology and science or its darker preoccupations. First, on approach: “The fairy tale which architecture embodies, is told in an even more obscure and indirect manner than in painting, literature, or music…”\n\nChapter One\n\n16\n\n“But if you mean by magic that quality which takes architecture above building, and painting beyond paint . . . we must all profess . . . magic.”2\n\nThen, on content: “Art is the flower – Life is the green leaf . . . you must offer the flower of the art that is in you – the symbols of all that is noble – and beautiful – and inspiring – flowers that will often change a colourless cheerless life – into an animated thoughtful thing.”3\n\nMackintosh’s ideas on indirection have an affinity with the generally Symbolist approach to art making and his ideas on content suggest a brighter and warmer version of the spiritual and mystical aspirations of much art called Symbolist. Yet Mackintosh was too creative and too much of an individualist to fit comfortably into any of the art historical categories that have been associated with his work, whether Symbolist, Art Nouveau, or Arts and Crafts.\n\nBibliography Billcliffe, Roger, ed.

A number of historians of design and decoration have already shown how nineteenth-century interiors were hostile to the penetration of light: thick curtains, with heavy cloth and velvets letting only a thin shaft of light enter through from the window, the pale rays increasing the allure of the objects and figures within. The bright light of day never entered these rooms. Where curtains offered an insufficient barrier against the light, a thick growth of creepers on exterior walls and luxuriant palms and other indoor plants, often arranged on shelves in bay windows, created a green shade.1 Between the late nineteenth century and the early twentieth century, as Art Nouveau gained hold and especially the modernism of German origin, interiors were reorganized and purified, with the removal of clutter, especially of the ornaments that usually crowded every surface. Art Nouveau also eliminated heavy curtains to let the light in, now considered for its aesthetic value and even more importantly as a moral symbol. However, during this period, light was still attenuated and it was not until the thirties that bright light was allowed to enter unhindered. Before the thirties, the glare of sunlight was filtered through much lighter curtains, but also through coloured glass, which came to play a leading role in architecture and interiors. The Italian stained glass discussed in this study all belongs to the early twentieth century, to the period when the ideas of Art Nouveau and modernism were spreading in Europe. In this period there was resistance to the aesthetics of the late nineteenth-century for interior design, but there\n\nSymbolist Interiors\n\n19\n\nwas a lingering admiration for shadowy and coloured spaces, for cozy and crepuscular atmospheres, and for Symbolist evocations through light. In this regard, stained glass became fundamental in determining the Symbolist interior. Literary historians have defined the Symbolist interior by studying the rooms described in the works of Edgar Allan Poe, Stéphané Mallarmé, Joris Karl Huysmans, etc.2 We would like to explore similarities between the characteristics described in those writings and those that actually existed in real interiors. We will concentrate on stained glass elements, using a few Italian examples. The window has been for a long time interpreted as a symbol, especially when it is seen as functioning like a diaphragm, separating and uniting space at the same time. With the ascent of Romanticism the window held a special fascination for painters, writers and poets, often becoming a metaphor for the artist’s view of the world, and for even more, as we can see especially in the Symbolist period (see, for example, Baudelaire’s celebrated poem Les fenêtres).3 Stained glass was loaded with hidden meaning and lent itself to Symbolist interpretations on two levels: as a decorative and furnishing element in which the glass became a way of expressing Symbolist themes, in the same way as painting (stained glass is treated as a transparent painting); and, most notably, for the atmosphere the stained glass created within the interplay of light, allowing changing and often ill-defined colours to enter a space, as shifting and uncertain as the soul of the room’s inhabitant. The coloured glass, both luminous and opalescent, enclosing the space but not confining it, was effectively very congenial to the Symbolist metaphorical vision of reality.4\n\n20\n\nChapter Two\n\nFig. 2-1. Historical photograph of a stained glass created by Jacques Gruber, ca. 1900.\n\nFurthermore, stained glass was suited to the illusionistic vision, with the taste for the artificial so much favored by Symbolist literature (see Huysmans, À rebours, for the flight from the world in favor of artificial stimuli and the rejection of nature in the proclamation of the triumph of the artificial). In some examples of spaces still existing today or documented in historical photographs (Figs. 2-1 and 2-2), the role of the stained glass is clear in creating an interplay between the natural landscape and an “artificial” nature, as well as causing a sensation of being placed in an aquarium (in literature we think again of the hero of À rebours, who lets light in through an aquarium to which he has added drops of colour). In short, this was the general use of stained glass in the shaded interior of the Symbolist period.\n\nSymbolist Interiors\n\n21\n\nFig. 2-2. Historical photograph of the Otto Wagner House in Vienna, ca. 1900 with stained glass, titled Vienna Woods in the Autumn by Adolf Böhm.\n\nIn Italy too, between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, there are examples of stained glass that can be linked to Symbolist culture in two ways: on the one hand, an important role is played by stained glass which represents the same subjects depicted in Symbolist painting (they look like transparent paintings) (Fig. 2-3), and, on the other hand, there is stained glass whose subject is less important than the Symbolist mood, conveyed through the evocative and suggestive lighting, thereby creating Symbolist interiors. I shall later give examples that belong to the second category. In Italy as in other European cultures, writings of the early twentieth century about stained glass reflect Symbolist aesthetics. In numerous texts, we can find the idea of hiding the ugly outside and separating it from the intimacy of the domestic interior by creating an environment for personal contemplation, and above all by protecting it from the outside world as a refuge and a symbol of a “dreamt” life.\n\n22\n\nChapter Two\n\nFig. 2-3. Duilio Cambellotti, Fireflies, ca. 1920. Rome, Private Collection.\n\n“Against the wind. Against the cold. Against the light. Against peeping-toms. Against ugliness and for love.” Such reads the script in a banderole which links two rose branches, a pattern introduced in 1905 by the decorator Edgardo Calori for the stained glass of a private room.5 This concise definition, structured on negation, encapsulates the raison d’être of stained glass in early twentieth-century Italian homes, uniting practical and functional reasons to aesthetic ones in thinking about an interior space. The description echoes recurring themes from the nineteenth century about the search for protection and refuge from the external world, in the desire to hide and banish the ugly “outside” in favor of domestic intimacy and to create an environment that lent itself to private gatherings and love. The desire for protection from the ugliness of the outside world, which the nineteenth-century houses achieved through having heavy curtains, is instead found in coloured stained glass.\n\nSymbolist Interiors\n\n23\n\nIn Italy too, moreover, modern houses began to be designed with cleaner lines and with more sober decoration; interiors were freed from the air of artistic confusion, so unpopular with the new bourgeois society, but the fascination of suffused light lingered on, and was made colourful and even more seductive through stained glass.\n\nFig. 2-4. Photograph from an Italian stained glass manufacturer’s catalogue, early 20th century.\n\n24\n\nChapter Two\n\n“It is with colour that stained glass becomes an object which assumes different characters, that of magnificence or sweetness, of mystery or pomp. Whether colour is intense and pure or of a subtle and melancholic gradation, coloured glass highlights the values of light, or it makes them softer. It can make the rays vibrate to the point of creating a tumult of colours or it can modulate them to the point of silence.”6 This quotation, written in 1908, comes from a magazine meant for technicians and specialists in the production and processing of stained glass, but uses terms that are similar to the ones many artists and decorators of stained glass used in the early 1900s in Italy. Fascination for coloured light was not set against the scientific approach that characterized these years, because many artists often applied the strong emotional power of colours to an interior drawing taking the scientific studies as their starting point. Those scientific studies were investigating and demonstrating the influence of colours on mood and the psyche. For example, in the same magazine, we read: “nowhere else…does the moral meaning of colours (I mean their secret relationship to our emotions) strike us more profoundly than with glass, because the transparency adds expression and even poetry… It follows that if one colour dominates in the stained glass, it will impose a character on the objects of the furnishings.”7 In Italy there were several cases of illusionistic stained glass, in which the compositions, representing in an illusionistic – and often theatrical – manner the real architectural elements, suggested, with deliberate ambiguity, the presence of nature outside the window. Through the glass one could attempt to immerse oneself in and “escape” into nature. But even in this search for nature, one moved simultaneously in the direction of the artificial (Fig. 2-4). In our analysis of the role of stained glass in the Italian cultural milieu, we can now direct our focus to an exemplary cultural circle, worthy of our attention as it allows a comparison between interiors incorporating stained glass that were actually designed and realized, and theoretical writing. I refer to a modernist group in Rome that included artists Duilio Cambellotti, Umberto Bottazzi, Vittorio Grassi among them, but also the poet, scholar and critic Guido Menasci and the pedagogue Alessandro Marcucci. They were all united by the ideal of extending modern beauty into daily life through a unified approach to architecture and interior design, according to the aesthetics of functional simplicity (often with a distinctly medieval, antiLiberty flavor). The stained glass designed by the artists of this group, was always realized by the glassmaker Cesare Picchiani.8 The artists often worked together putting their ideals into practice and their theories were established and discussed in the magazine La Casa, published between 1908 and 1913 (Fig. 2-5).\n\nSymbolist Interiors\n\nFig. 2-5. Title page of the magazine La Casa.\n\n25\n\n26\n\nChapter Two\n\nThe type of house they built that was described in La Casa was a single family unit, the so called villino (Fig. 2-6). The term villino refers to a building type that was gaining in popularity throughout Italy, with the growth of the social class destined to inhabit it: the middle class. It shared a number of characteristics, but varied according to the owner’s social and economic position and in relation to the buildings around it. In general it might be described as a small villa with a small garden. It was supposed to be built back from the road to create space for a garden around the house so that nature was visible from every window. Often, however, green space was sacrificed for economic reasons: the gardens were reduced to a minimum and the villini were surrounded by other larger apartment buildings. The stained glass was often relied upon to substitute for nature. With this in mind, we can understand how the main theme of the stained glass was naturalistic, loaded with allusive and Symbolic meaning.\n\nFig. 2-6. Illustration of a villino from the magazine La Casa.\n\nSymbolist Interiors\n\n27\n\nIn 1908, the year it first appeared, the magazine La Casa gave ample space to the window that brought life and joy into the domestic interior, combining advice regarding hygiene and aesthetics with reflections on stained glass. The first recommendation was to eliminate heavy curtains as the repositories of dust and germs. The health-giving benefits of light were promoted, although at that time it was still to be filtered: thin, light curtains were to be adopted, shielding the eye from the monotony of a neighboring wall beyond, but also bringing “to the eye and spirit the grace of flowers.” These curtains were embroidered, and flowers were variously represented as a main theme whenever nature failed to provide them.9 Similarly, stained glass was designed to bring spiritual nourishment in the form of landscapes and tumbling flowers. A characteristic way of furthering an illusionistic relationship with the exterior world that these artists also used was to limit the decorative sections of the glass to the borders of the window letting light flow freely though the transparent centre, like a pergola: an allusion, perhaps, to the structure which stood, or should have stood, against the walls of the villino. Thus, the windows were decoratively framed with trellises of vines, and especially with cascades of wisterias and roses, the very plants that the magazine recommended for growing on the outside walls (Figs. 27 and 2-8).10\n\nFig. 2-7. Duilio Cambellotti, Grapevines, 1914-1915. Rome, Museo della Casina delle Civette.\n\n28\n\nChapter Two\n\nThe stained glass might also show other subjects drawn from nature, but so distorted or enlarged as to appear fantastical: it could shatter any naturalistic illusion in order to create an unexpected and bewildering effect, and to evoke magical visions. Examples include giant dragonflies and butterflies (Fig. 2-9), and especially fish (Fig. 2-10) that glanced across the glass, or moved in ambiguous spaces, the glass suggesting the shifting light of the sea.11\n\nFig. 2-8. Illustration of a Roman exterior with wisteria, from the magazine La Casa.\n\nMany natural subjects can be seen in the so called Casina delle Civette (House of Owls) in Rome, a very large and special villino restored in the early twentieth century by Prince Giovanni Torlonia and decorated by Roman artists (circa 1913-1920).12 Here the stained glass designed by the Roman artists was produced by the glassmaker Cesare Picchiani. Vegetation on the outside played an important role and was echoed by stained glass with pergolas of grapevines and roses, like those that also grew outside the building (Fig. 2-7).13 While in the bedroom there were the windows The Owls of the Night, the presence of the owls probably did not correspond to any external reality, but was an allusion to the personality of Prince Giovanni Torlonia, who had the villa decorated with owls and other animal motifs because of their symbolic meanings.\n\nSymbolist Interiors\n\n29\n\nIn this regard, we must remember that in addition to the naturalistic repertoire – used in the illusionistic or fantastical manner – the Roman artists used stained glass to convey Symbolist meanings,14 but this is not the place to attempt an analysis of their significance, as our present interest is in the creation of lighting effects and atmosphere. Indeed, Roman artists considered the Symbolist value of the glass to be found, above all, in the light and atmosphere created inside the house, rather than in the nature of the subject matter. For example, in 1909, the artist Umberto Bottazzi wrote: “Flowers, animals, clouds, geometrical patterns, anything could be used” in the design of the stained glass, as long as it assisted in the creation of “a corner in which to meditate and dream with open eyes. And meditation and dreaming were provoked by the various colours of the glass.”15\n\nFig. 2-9. Umberto Bottazzi, Butterflies in a photograph. Location unknown.\n\nIn 1908, the stained glass windows in La Casa are described as “fantastic paintings, vague shadows that inhabit the world of dreams, where it is precious and life-giving to dwell for short spells, removed from the trials and blows of life…; unreal visions and imaginative colour harmonies, like some silent music, lead us into a fabled land.” Since people complained that the view from the windows was no longer that “restorative expanse of countryside, nor the comfortable proximity of a tree, nor the august vision of a monument, of a building, but the squalid line of houses and high, modern buildings, long, flat, crammed together,\n\n30\n\nChapter Two\n\nhostile and thus it is fitting that the inhabitants of the city would ask for help from art (stained glass) to allow them to meditate, enjoy, and fantasize in their own home.”16 The stained glass made by the Roman artists and exhibited in Rome in 1912 was described in similar terms by Giuseppe Sprovieri, the critic and gallery owner, who was close to the group. He emphasized how the stained glass differed from paintings: “while in a painting, it is essential to create a setting, stained glass enhances it.” Furthermore, stained glass “creates thousands of colour effects, with a different play of light and shadow during the course of the day, a delicate web of seduction and alluring fascination causing the imagination to surrender and navigate with open sails towards the land of dreams and nostalgia.”17 The characteristic of stained glass evoked here responded to the aesthetic ideals of the Roman modernist group amenable to the dreams and imagination of those who could abandon themselves to their charm as they would to the sound of music.\n\nFig. 2-10. Vittorio Grassi, Fish in an historical photograph. Rome, Private Collection.\n\nThe Roman artists saw glass then primarily as a means of abandonment to visions and dreams, analogous to music. However, scientific research on the influence of colour on the psyche also\n\nSymbolist Interiors\n\n31\n\ncontributed to the important emotional role played by coloured light that these artists had recognized as well. Those who wrote for La Casa gave considerable weight to a room’s colour and its effect on the nervous system18 and mood. Roman artists demonstrated these theories in their creations. In a villino created by Bottazzi and Grassi in 1911, for example, the varied chromatic effects of different rooms were closely studied. These chromatic effects were achieved by coloured plaster walls and majolica cladding, but especially by stained glass. It is a work in stained glass that exemplifies the importance the artists gave to coloured light and as well as the complex link between art, music, and science: Vittorio Grassi designed glass for the music room of this villino. The window is now lost but a painting,19 which has been the source of inspiration, and a sketch for it have survived (Fig. 2-11). The work reflects Grassi’s interests in issues regarding light, colour and music. As a matter of fact, the artist had been following lectures from classes held by the physicist Pietro Blaserna, looking into the relationship between light and sound,20 and he had also invented a special piano connected to a panel made of coloured divisions which lighted up when the corresponding chord was played.21\n\nFig. 2-11. Vittorio Grassi, Chopin Nocturno op. 48, n°1, ca. 1908. Sketch for the stained glass.\n\n32\n\nChapter Two\n\nWe cannot discuss this theme at length here, but the stained glass of the 1911 villino merely offers some indication of Grassi’s approach. The titles of the painting and of the stained glass were related to a musical “nocturnal” composition by Chopin: the musical reference is not clear from the subject (the interior of a bell-tower in the moonlight), but with the nocturnal atmosphere and the colours enhanced by light and shade, the pictorial language aims to evoke the same fascination and feelings evoked by Chopin’s music. While the parallel between sound and light can be grasped intuitively from the chromatic harmonies and emphasized chiaroscuro of the extant painting, it must have been more clearly demonstrated in the stained glass of the 1911 villino. Indeed the stained glass panel, “of a cold, bluish tone with pale yellows and intriguing transparencies,”22 was devised for a small room whose dark blue colouring “encased it in a strangely inviting shadow”23 and was described as a “pictorial sensation akin to a nocturne by Chopin.”24 The artist’s intention was clearly to inspire a “sensation,” demonstrating the parallel between sound and coloured light, through the relationship between acoustic vibrations created in the room by the “Welte piano” (a modern mechanical instrument reproducing the recorded performances of famous composers) and light vibrations created by the stained glass, spreading blue and yellow throughout the room, just like music diffused intangibly, in that space full of suggestions of light and shadow.\n\nList of Illustrations Fig. 2-1.

Il n’est pas d’objet plus profond, plus mystérieux, plus fécond, plus ténébreux, plus éblouissant qu’un fenêtre éclairée d’une chandelle. Ce qu’on peut voir au soleil est toujours moins intéressant que ce qui se passe derrière une vitre. Dans ce trou noir ou lumineux vit la vie, rêve la vie, souffre la vie”. 4 Definition from Rossana Bossaglia, « Il fenomeno Liberty », in La vetrata Liberty a Milano, catalogue of the exhibition held in Milan in 1990 (Milan: Comune, 1990), 15. 5 “Invetriate dipinte per un piccolo quartiere d’abitazione”, Arte Italiana Decorativa e Industriale, (1905): tav.49. 6 Francesco Rolandi, “Note tecniche.

This Italian trend developed by the artists of the group La Casa mirrored the international taste; in Italian stained glass, vines, wisteria, roses recalled a familiar and daily image but at the same time evoked an allusion to artificial nature. Similarly, at Laurelton Hall, Tiffany’s home on Long Island, wisteria hung from pergolas outside the window just as it was depicted on the glass within. (We refer to Tiffany because he was among the first and most famous to use stained glass in this way, and also because the Roman artists were undoubtedly influenced by him). 11 The fish were drawn from Japanese models (previously used by La Farge and Tiffany), and were perfectly suited to reinforcing the underwater or aquarium\n\n34\n\nChapter Two\n\nassociations already mentioned. 12 Prince Giovanni Torlonia lived there until 1938. After a period of neglect, the villa was restored and now serves as a museum dedicated to stained glass. 13 It is not just by chance that there were pergolas of vines and roses between plants documented outside the Casina: see Alberta Campitelli, in Il Museo della Casina della civette (Rome: Istituto poligrafico e Zecca dello Stato, 1997), 48-52. 14 Their glass was often decorated with complex motifs; many of the more obscure symbols have still to be deciphered, such as the idol or the prism by Vittorio Grassi or the fireflies or the fairy by Cambellotti. 15 Umberto Bottazzi, “Ceramiche e vetri”, La Casa, (1909): 44. 16 “La casa da cima a fondo.

The stained glass derives from this second painting.

Armand Point, Self-Portrait\n\nArmand Point becomes a Symbolist1 At the end of 1888, Péladan2 introduced Armand Point to Symbolism. One of his first works marked by this aesthetic is Portrait d’Élémir Bourges (Fig. 3-2), a depiction of one of Point's greatest friends.3\n\nThe Symbolist Path of Armand Point\n\n37\n\nFig. 3-2. Armand Point, Portrait d’Elémir Bourges\n\nDuring his early years as a Symbolist, Armand Point created art with a rather melancholy mysticism. His works represented feminine figures, nudes with slender forms or young women with long, old-fashioned dresses, sitting or walking in landscapes of forests and lakes that reflected a crepuscular deadened light. The artist’s palette also changed: there was more gray, ocher, and deadened mauve. He enhanced the tints and used delicate and fine techniques in pastel and red chalk, although the majority of his works were in pastel.\n\nSymbolist Themes by Armand Point Since the revival of interest in Symbolism during the 1960s and with the Exhibition Paradis perdus4 in 1995, studies conducted throughout Europe, have put European and American artists in a prominent position. The exhibition of Peintres de l’Âme,5 curated by M. Jumeau-Lafond, and the publication of Symbolisme idéaliste en France focused mainly on artists of la Rose-Croix and les Artistes de l’Âme6 and included an extensive commentary on Point.\n\n38\n\nChapter Three\n\nThe following addresses important Symbolist works of Armand Point and the main themes that were taken up by the artist.\n\nWoman Woman, a major theme of Symbolist thought, has been the subject of a special exhibition,7 Le Symbolisme et la Femme in which Béatrice de Andia established a large survey of art addressing the subject.8 Works of Point exemplify the popularity of this theme. Until 1892, young ethereal women embodied ideal beauty for the artist. Works presented in 1893 reveal various aspects of women: a mysterious woman is depicted in Tête de rêve (Fig. 3-3) and another is dressed in velvet, as a symbol of purity, as in Virginité9 (Fig. 3-4).\n\nFig. 3-3. Armand Point, Tête de rêve\n\nFig. 3-4. Point, Virginité\n\nMuses From 1891, Armand Point shared his life with Hélène Linder who appeared more than fifty times in his oeuvre. In La Dame à l’anémone, Hélène Linder’s10 portrait testifies to a serene passion between model and artist, a passion that lasted until 1899 before their relationship turned into an enduring friendship. In 1901, the arrival of the Scandinavian beauty Helga Weeke in Marlotte produced in Point a passion which stimulated his desire to create\n\nThe Symbolist Path of Armand Point\n\n39\n\nnew portraits, particularly Jeune femme à la toque verte (Fig. 3-5). But Armand and Helga did not last beyond 1908 as a couple.\n\nFig. 3-5. Jeune femme à la toque verte\n\nFig. 3-6. Salomé dansant\n\nHair Hair was a charming feminine weapon; fastened or loosened, it was a sign of availability or don de soi. Point is sensitive to the charm of hair, particularly in Tête de rêve (Fig. 3-3), in Salomé [dansant] (Fig. 3-6) and in Baigneuse aux lauriers,11 which has the figure with red, almost infinite, wavy hair recalling Mary Magdalene.12\n\nTwilights and Nocturnes Few works of Armand Point deal with the theme of twilight or night. Hélène still personified these temporal symbols in Symphonie du soir13 (Fig. 3-7). These moments of solitude and melancholy depicted the young lady set against a background of calm water reflecting a setting sun. She inhabited the unreal realm of the dream.\n\nChapter Three\n\n40\n\nFig. 3-7. Symphonie du soir\n\nFig.3-8. La Sirène\n\nFeminine Evil and Eroticism: The Siren and Salome The temptress who leads man on the road to ruin appears in Point’s world in 1897. Her presence is probably related to emotional problems; the first signs of a breakdown in his relationship with Hélène Linder appeared during their stay in Capri where the image of women changes. La Sirène (Fig. 3-8) shows a new feminine type with more detail, creating a face far from Hélène’s and closer to the Greek classical canon,14 with a cold, impersonal and disturbing expression. Salome was a very frequent subject for the fin de siècle thinkers, particularly Gustave Moreau and Oscar Wilde.15 On the extreme opposite side of their tragic and bloody visions, Point was principally inspired by Filippo Lippi and his Danse de Salomé.16 In Salomé [dansant] (Fig. 3-6) the young woman with her slender, arched lines and her swirling veils, tipped back her head and looked into Herod’s eyes with a deep intensity.17\n\nDeath With Ophélie, a pastel, Point found the theme in which the purity of the budding flower contrasted with the eroticism of the red hair of the dead young woman floating on water and represented the ambivalence of desire\n\nThe Symbolist Path of Armand Point\n\n41\n\nand death.18 He used this subject again, shortly after 1900, in the Coffret d’Ophélie.19 Affected by the sudden death of Gisèle Gouverneur in 1926,20 he called her posthumous portrait, La rose des ruines (Fig. 3-9).\n\nFig. 3-9. La rose des ruines\n\nFig. 3-10. Ancilla Domini\n\nChristian Themes Ancilla Domini (Fig. 3-10), from 1890-1897, is the most significant work of Christian inspiration. In Coffret aux paons,21 both principal motifs, peacocks and grapes, common in the Middle Ages, were also inspired by Christianity.22\n\nThe Middle Ages, their Princesses, and the Golden Legend For Point, woman became princess as in Princesse de légende, Princesse d’automne or fairy as in La Fée du lac (Fig. 3-11). All of the characters of young women were derived from stories and myths of the\n\n42\n\nChapter Three\n\nMiddle Ages.23 Hélène Linder with her stylized face is depicted in L’éternelle chimère walking quietly at the water’s edge, abso"
