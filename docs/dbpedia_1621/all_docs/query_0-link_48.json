But European expansion was marking time and the prestige of the Old World was diminishing. Skills developed by Anglo-Saxons and Latins had been exported from Europe to the United States and were now rebounding across the Atlantic; vigorous American competition was already a force to be reckoned with. Only yesterday the New World countries had been scorned by Europe; now they were hurrying to catch up and even had the audacity to dream of overtaking her. The Americans actually dignified their giant factories and office blocks with a homemade aesthetic label, the Saracenic Style. The European powers no longer had to defend themselves against military aggression; but internally a number of social and political problems were threatening the security of the middle classes, all sections of which (except in Russia) had been deeply shaken by the consequences of the Revolution of 1848, the reverberations of the Paris Commune in 1871, and the economic crises of 1875. The big cities of Western Europe housed a poverty-stricken proletariat which was aware that its numbers implied strength and which was struggling desperately to organize itself. Industrial advances which the middle classes themselves had brought about, together with Socialist propaganda and the upsurge of democracy, had created new and bewildering situations. Faced by the proletarian threat, the bourgeoisie did everything it could to strengthen its position. Politically, it used nationalistic aspirations as a disguise for its natural greed; and on the social plane it successfully confused the issue by the exercise of a moralizing authoritarianism. Trade unions were permitted but strikes were suppressed. Universal suffrage was declared but the issue of voters' cards was held up. Free education was granted as a concession to popular demand, but designed in such a way as to preserve social conformity and class divisions.

Cheap industrial production provided the customers of the big stores— lower-middle- and working-class people with goods which, if not exactly works of art, were at any rate pleasant to own and a few half-hearted attempts to solve the housing problem put a brake on demands which nowadays would seem extremely modest. With the abolition of child labor, and the fourteen-hour work day; with voters' cards, Sunday suits, and a day trip to the seaside once a year; with \"artistic tile\" decoration in cafés, and the hope of one day possessing a bicycle, the proletariat gained some sort of respectability and were able to identify themselves to some extent with the middle classes. This hopeful atmosphere tinged more or less with the earlier socialism of Saintsupplied the setting for the endeavors Simon or François Fourier of William Morris, Henry van de Velde, and the School of Nancy. labor\n\nstill\n\n—\n\n;\n\n—\n\nAll these artists\n\ncame of middle-class\n\nIt is clear that\n\nclasses\n\nscope,\n\nthe\n\ndawn\n\n—\n\norigins.\n\nof democracy had shed a disturbing, confusing light.\n\nThe\n\npropertied\n\nconceded a growing importance to those below, gave them a limited degree of political and abandoned some of the old taboos the result was a profound psychological shock ;\n\nwhich made itself felt at all levels of society. This upheaval stands out even more glaringly in the religious field. For the better part of four centuries religion had been drying into rigidity, changing from a spiritual attitude into a moral code. Authorities and flock alike had become negative, sinking deeper and deeper into habits of faultfinding and life denial. Formalism reigned. In his encyclical, Quanta Cura (1864), Pope Pius IX sweepingly rejected modern society and the spirit of 1789 (the French Revolution), setting up a complete opposition between the Catholic ideal and the liberal spirit. He was adamant against secular education and the freedom of the conscience and the press. Leo XIII was more accommodating, and in 1891 enunciated a social doctrine for the Church, but the resulting democratic movement was condemned soon after by Pius X with his attacks on the errors of modernism. Religious adherence had become a matter of social position; religious practice, merely the result of early training. In some localities the presence of working-class people at Mass was strictly supervised, and in all parishes the \"servants' Mass\" was held early on Sunday mornings. All that the established churches had to offer to eager hearts was a monotonous and, as time went on, thoroughly superficial rule of conduct. It was, therefore, only to be expected that some people should search for God elsewhere, reviving old beliefs or creating new ones, and indulging in spiritual activities condemned by authority as dangerous or sinful. Magic and spiritualism had never had so many supporters, and when Hyacinthe Chantelouve pursued terror and exaltation along strange paths, including diabolism, she was perhaps struggling to assuage desires she no longer dared to confess to a priest.\n\nAtheism had opened a void which worried a number of churchmen, university teachers, writers, and artists. Cardinal La Vigerie, who was especially active against boulangisme, a re actionary movement led by General Boulanger, opened the way to those who thought it possible to be both republican and Catholic. J. K. Huysmans and Aubrey Beardsley were converted to\n\n.\n\nINTRODUCTION Catholicism. Ferdinand Brunetière, in 1895, protested against the bankruptcy of science and speculated on the means of rescuing a soul for God. Confusion meanwhile was total: the French\n\nwere even accused by the Christians of being reduced to worshiping a mysterious individual named Léon in place of the banished Christ: \"Léon is watching us\" \"There is only one Léon,\" run the captions on a caricature depicting a classroom in a secularist school. It was in this climate that the Affaire Dreyfus burst on public attention. A glance at history and society during the so-called Belle Époque discloses a state of utter confusion— moral, social, religious, intellectual. The world was no longer in tune with Europe; Socialism was no longer the expression of generous impulses love and marriage were incompatible; and art was aimed at the senses, not the soul. The churches were empty of God. In these circumstances Art Nouveau was simply the aesthetic manifestation of a deep hunger for something different, something new. Along with these moral and material perplexities arose another problem, as important as it secularists\n\n;\n\n;\n\nwas unforeseen: that of woman, or rather, women. The real-life originals of the women in the novels of Stendhal, Balzac, and Flaubert were middle-class female objects, passive and subservient at least economically, and usually in other ways as well. They might choose a confessor or a lover to suit themselves, but that was the limit of their freedom. \"Adultery,\" proclaimed Willy (Colette's husband, and a well-known author), \"is the foundation of society by making marriage\n\n—\n\n:\n\nbearable\n\nit\n\nensures the survival of the family.\"\n\nCertainly in literature, from Balzac to Henri Becque, marriage is depicted as a social and commercial institution almost entirely unconnected with love. A girl is taught from her childhood how to please the opposite sex; her upbringing is based not on absolute moral standards but on recipes for seductiveness. Feminine behavior degenerated into a handful of conventional, artificial attitudes set in motion by conditioned reflexes. The whole life of women, and hence morals, literature, and the art of love, was controlled by fashion, and any feminine gesture might supply the subject matter for a supposed work of art. To take off a glove with deliberate slowness was calculated, by the standards of the period, to throw a man automatically into a frenzy of desire ( Woman with Pink Gloves, by Jacques-Emile Blanche) In the Garden, by Georges de Feure, helps us to understand the taste of the time for certain evocative aspects of nature, for rare flowers, and for lace petticoats embroidered with hearts and vines. Never had there been such a flurry of legs in the air, of conspiratorial fingers, of skirts hitched up (Seurat's The Cancan). On gusty Sundays, young men leaving church after Mass are thrilled by the fleeting revelation of a girl's ankle {Joli mois de Marie, by Paul Chabas). And in the evening, with their top hats rammed down tight on their skulls, the same young men are spectators at the crude unveiling of sexual mysteries in the form of professional dancing which is merely a rhythmical exhibition of garters and bloomers {Le Cabaret de la Souris, by Bottini). Cartoons in the daily press show us other facets of the situation for example, a handsome girl, half covered by her rumpled bedclothes, teases her departing elderly lover, as he gloomily puts on his jacket, with its buttonhole displaying the rosette of the Legion of Honor: \"Poor old pussycat, I wonder how you'll manage to honor the mother of your children tonight!\" The lives of working-class girls had run into an intolerable dilemma. The urban proletariat had increased enormously; so had prostitution. In the closing years of the century it was as if the influx of population to the towns had been followed by a similar movement of the jus primae noctis; in the London, Vienna, and Paris of 1895, anyone with enough money in his pocket enjoyed the same freedom as a feudal lord. Laborers' wages were low; girls, whose labor was mostly piecework, earned even less, and their only hope lay in finding a rich \"protector.\" In one of Forain's cartoons a thirteen-year-old girl is selling long loaves of bread a financier whispers into her ear, \"No need to go on toting those great things about; I can tell you where to find 1\n\n:\n\n;\n\nsmaller ones.\"\n\nVarious writers, especially Zola, in France at\n\nmade\n\nany rate was a resolutely\n\naware of its responsibilities. Feminism, which and at times revolutionary movement, attracted\n\nsociety\n\nSocialistic\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nI0\n\nfondly imagining that the lot of Woman had been unalterably decreed for all eternity, suddenly found itself confronted with the problems of real, live women. Here we must interrupt this historical survey for a moment to define two words. The first is\n\nwomen\n\nof\n\nall classes. Society,\n\n\"historicism.\"\n\nBy\n\nthis\n\nwe mean\n\nthat excessive fondness for past styles\n\nwhich was the great weak-\n\nhowever mediocre, to anything new, original creation. The second word is \"Mannerism.\" Today\n\nness of the nineteenth century; preferring pastiche,\n\ntoricism\n\nstifles all\n\nattempts at\n\nhisit is\n\ngenerally used in reference to the highly refined, subjective exaggeration of artistic canons, subject matter, or composition that developed at the end of the High Renaissance; but in dis-\n\nan unfavorable sense Mannerism is the spirit which is set on achieving something precious and rare at all costs; it falls readily into preciosity, tends toward decadence and the bizarre. A new intellectual elite had arisen. Its leaders and standard-bearers were such artists as Gustav Klimt, Beardsley, and Thomas Theodor Heine, who had given graphic expression to the psychopathology laid bare by Freud and the Nancy school of psychologists, and writers such as Huysmans and Lorrain, who had rejected ordinary morals to seek the savor of life in various kinds of irregularity \"forbidden loves,\" drugs, and alcohol. Two distinct viewpoints, sensuousness and sexuality, became the poles round which two opposite artistic principles took shape the apostles of the first principle were the Symbolists and the artists of the Sezession; the second was exploited in the salacious pictures and illustrations turned out by the prize-winning painters of cussing nineteenth-century art\n\nwe\n\nshall use the\n\nword\n\nin\n\n:\n\n—\n\n:\n\nthe Salons.\n\nThe\n\nenable us to decipher the whole attitude of a society or a country. In the present context, the relevant question is the degree to which the modern world was rejected or accepted. The monuments, paintings, furniture, and objects of the time all reflect one of two trends. On arts\n\nhand there was bourgeois Mannerism, the final expression of an aesthetic already on its deathbed on the other, a bold, prophetic, revolutionary impulse which prepared the ground for the one\n\n;\n\nthe art of today.\n\neven in the humblest artistic productions. The posters, political pamphlets, and educational journals published during that period make it clear that the entire left-wing camp in France Syndicalists, Socialists, Anarchists, and the campaigners for the secular control of education had been stimulated by both Symbolism and Art Nouveau. In one of these publications there is an illustration of a schoolmaster inspired by a Marianne with naked bosom, who points to the rising sun. The title page of a journal on higher primary education is decorated with Japanese flowers which might have been drawn by Félix Bracquemond. Propaganda posters, such as \"Soldier! When are you going on strike?\" or a capitalist's offer to a starving proletarian: \"Send your children to the monks to be educated, marry the Church, and then we'll give you a job,\" are treated in the popular style dear to Théophile-Alexandre Steinlen. This duality manifests\n\nitself\n\n— —\n\nCorrespondingly, Royalist, Christian, and anti-Dreyfus propaganda remained faithful to a\n\nmore or\n\nless classical style.\n\ntitillations\n\nThe\n\nfashionable, cold-hearted\n\nof Adolphe Willette, gave the\n\nmoneyed\n\nclasses\n\nhumor\n\nof Jean-Louis Forain, and the\n\nwhat they wanted.\n\nIn the visual arts, the unrest underlying bourgeois Mannerist society reared its head in the form of a misguided and excessive use of symbolism. Comparable symptoms appeared in litera-\n\nbecame heavily tainted with decadence. This superpreciosity, this exaggerated straining after novelty and refinement, infected not only minor figures like Fénéon and René Ghil, but also poets of such significance as Jules Laforgue and Jean Moréas. Some of the wordcoinings and metaphors of that period make hilarious reading today. No doubt our grandchildren will be equally amused by many of the laudatory articles and prefaces now being ture; lyricism\n\npublished about contemporary\n\nartists.\n\nThe political, social, and moral upheavals in the latter part of the nineteenth century were paralleled by the passionate warfare constantly raging in the artistic world. Art Nouveau was particularly distinguished by its determination to break with academicism and to create an aesthetic in\n\nharmony with\n\nthe needs of the age. This drive and, indeed, vocation,\n\nwhich was a\n\nINTRODUCTION common\n\nn movement\n\nLondon, Munich, Nancy, and Vienna, was often emasculated by a certain predilection toward folk art and the like the success of the English architects emulating the Tudor style, or Louis Sullivan when his work is too \"Oriental,\" is not entirely convincing. But in spite of the charges leveled against it, including that of going astray in Mannerist blind alleys, Art Nouveau has the honor, particularly in the architectural realm, of having been the first movement to recognize the demands of the modern world. Moreover, it was also the first to participate in Freud's clarification of human issues and, by purging the symbols of art of their outmoded elements, to strip the mask from the human face to reveal its naked anxiety. Sincerity was restored. One of the weapons Art Nouveau forged for itself was the understanding of ornament, which all the representatives of the movement, whether they are it developed to a state of perfection Symbolists like Leonardo Bistolfi, Henri Cros, or Hector Guimard, or modernists like Van de Velde and Josef Hoffmann, are as determined as any primitive artist to achieve harmony between the object and its decoration. This is equally true whether it concerns a sculptural mass, a vase, or the façade of a building. But the greatest triumph of Art Nouveau was that achieved by the painters, who boldly threw off their technical shackles and created new color effects which remain unequaled even now. No one until then, neither among the Impressionists nor even the Pointillists, had dared to conceive such unexpected chromatic delights: emerald, ruby, and violet, and astonishing opalescent tones abruptly juxtaposed with an inimitable turquoise hue. Whenever it walked in Pre-Raphaelite footsteps and made obeisance to the obsolete dogmas of John Ruskin or William Morris turning its back on industrialization and preaching a universal return to crafts and guilds Art Nouveau had no claim to novelty; but it was genuinely new whenever it sought unusual, original effects, and was colorful, consistent, harmonious, and functional, prefiguring the shape of things to come the Bauhaus, Surrealism, and abstract art. So protean is Art Nouveau in its manifestations that it demands to be studied country by country. But we should first dispose of a possible misconception: it is common to think of France as a center and of Paris as the capital of Art Nouveau, as its French name implies. On the contrary, however, in France the new possibilities opened up by the movement were neither welcomed nor understood. If we describe Art Nouveau as the creation of an appropriate setting for modern life, more particularly in architecture and the applied arts, we have to admit that it did not originate in Paris and, what is worse, that the French remained blind to it. It may be objected that in the work of Emile Galle, France can be credited with having given birth to an original and charming style, but that style soon died out because it made no attempt to satisfy factor of the\n\nin Brussels, Chicago, Glasgow,\n\n;\n\n;\n\n— —\n\n—\n\nthe\n\ndemands of its' epoch. By 19 io almost the only\n\nArt Nouveau in France were Jules Aimé Lavirotte's Ceramic Hôtel in Paris, De Feure's faded flowers, and Sarah Bernhardt in her seventies; the country had exhausted its imagination and had simply turned over and gone to sleep again. Lethargic complacency lay over all a spell so deep that only the First World War could break it; but that blow was too heavy: instead of awakening, France was shattered. By 1925, she was beginning to rediscover, with amazement, things which had been conceived a quarter of a century earlier in Austria, Germany, and the United States. Surrealism the most passionate voice that has ever been raised against banality and staleness in life and art -left the majority of the French indifferent. Following the example of the Goncourt brothers in an earlier generation, they preferred to linger among the desiccated charms of a bygone age. What a paradox that, in 1964, Paris, proud of its heritage, should haveheld its Antique Dealers' Fair (an interesting exhibition but essentially a conservative gesture) in a building which was one of the \"high places\" of modernism: a palace in the 1900 Style! traces of\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\nArchitecture the urge to beautify a commercial the beginning of the nineteenth century no one Until did not occur to anyone that such a mundane object should or could be building; felt\n\nit\n\nbeautiful. After 1815 the rise in the material\n\nand\n\nsocial status of tradesmen\n\nbrought about\n\nand the interest in historic styles, with their evocation of past glories, caught the favor of the newly rich. In 1839, in the then heart of New York, Richard Upjohn built Trinity Church in the Gothic style; meanwhile in Paris, where a multitude of façades with floral or pseudo-cathedral decoration were making their appearance, Théodore certain changes for the better,\n\nBallu built his inimitable Sainte-Clotilde.\n\nOthers preferred classicism to this medieval revival. Karl Schinkel in Berlin, Kornhausel in Vienna, Raffaello Stern in Rome, Monferran in Saint Petersburg, Alexander Thomson in Glasgow, A. J. Davis in New York, Visconti and Lefuel in Paris, Espérandieu in Marseilles with such architects as the leading spirits, \"Parthenons\" and \"Forums,\" duly edited in the spirit of Ledoux or Sir\n\non every side. Along with these two tendencies there can be detected, from about 1830, the development of modernist trends. Industrial progress and the first large-scale constructions in iron (both due to the initiative of the most affluent section of the middle classes) had opened up substantial new possibilities; an interval of forty years separates the Palais du Commerce et de l'Industrie in Paris by Grisart (1838) and the Provident and Trust Company Building by Frank Furness (1879) in Philadelphia. Ten years later, in St. Louis, Sullivan was constructing his first buildings, and in 1899, Horta's Maison du Peuple (plates 60 and 84) was opened in Brussels. The means of expression of Art Nouveau were extremely varied and even, at times, mutually\n\nJohn Soane,\n\nexclusive, with the result that\n\nXVI\"\n\nor \"Empire.\"\n\nThe\n\nproliferated\n\nwe cannot apply simple\n\nclassifications like\n\nXV\"\n\ncommon in the Two such different\n\nambiguities and hybrid forms which are so\n\ndecorative arts have equally striking parallels in architecture.\n\n\"Louis\n\nor \"Louis\n\nrealm of the creations as\n\nCharles Rennie Mackintosh's Glasgow School of Art (plate 32) and August Endell's Elvira Photographic Studio (plate 39) both date from around 1897, and both are examples of Art\n\nNouveau. Thus, there is not a single Art Nouveau style, but a number of movements with a great even conflict, of stylistic traits (the symbolism of some making a violent contrast to the\n\nvariety,\n\nmodernism of others) which nevertheless were ultimately and amicably joined in a single cause, that of trampling on the established order and clearing the way for all the revolutionary manifestations of the twentieth century.\n\nIn 13),\n\nthis\n\nchapter\n\nSullivan's\n\nwe\n\nshall\n\nCarson\n\nbuildings (plates 21\n\nand\n\nhave\n\n22)\n\neloquently than any words.\n\nwith the sinuous arboreal structures of Guimard (plate Co.

But they possess characteristics which make it seem logical to classify them as Art Nouveau -the use of dreamlike symbolism, for example, or a highly conscious manipulation of space. Like the medieval revival in the middle of the nineteenth century, the 1900 Style varied from place to place; it was wildly exuberant on the banks of the Rhine, but it was serious and restrained in Northern It\n\n—\n\nItaly.\n\nArt Nouveau was a great\n\nmoment\n\nin the evolution of artistic styles\n\n;\n\nthe works of Horta\n\nGuimard (plate 5), and Gaudi (plate 27) showed that the art of the past could be an ultimate stage, while those of Josef Hoffmann (plate 36), Sullivan (plate 56), and Tony Gamier were among the first to point to the promise of the future. The architecture of Art Nouveau can be likened to the flight of a Fourth ofJuly rocket. Some architects, such as Auguste Perret and Sullivan, chose the moment at which the trajectory is starting to curve and fall away; others, such as Guimard and Horta, subjected conventional materials to convolutions which recall the spirals that appear when the rocket bursts and floats down, opening like a fiery flower. (plate 63),\n\ncarried to\n\nFRANCE The beginning of the Second Empire saw a wave of expansion taking place in the environs of Paris; farms and parks gave way to heavy, gloomy, high-rent apartment buildings designed by uninspired hacks.\n\nThe\n\n\"eclectic,\"\n\nGare de\n\n—which were hopefully dubbed \"hygienic,\" or \"economical,\" and which are dotted about in an area bounded by the the Colline Montmartre, and the Gare Saint-Lazare —show an alarming tendency\n\ndecorations of the façades of these disastrous edifices\n\nl'Est,\n\nto break out into excrescences (heads of Minerva in consternation, or muzzles of snarling lions) on the rectangular masses of their funereal balconies. In the eyes of the promoters, already numerous in the time of the French President Thiers, the newly affluent classes were better accommodated by those conventional, massive dwellings than by the charming but over-modest little Parisian houses of the \"keepsake\" type (for example, 20 Boulevard des Italiens, 1 Rue Vineuse, and 9 Rue Victor-Masse). While bourgeois classical architecture was expiring, a few \"engineers,\" as these innovating architects were slightingly called, conceived the idea of using iron girders as the framework for industrial buildings. Iron and glass made their first appearance as early as 1833, in Rohault de Fleury's greenhouses for the Jardin des Plantes, Paris. Finally, in 1863, by inaugurating his lectures at the École des Beaux- Arts with his famous series of Entretiens sur V architecture (Discourses on Architecture, 2 vols., Boston, 1875-81), Viollet-le-Duc was to sow dismay among the defenders of eclecticism. He was a convinced medievalist, but at the same time an equally convinced and even excessive rationalist he made it his business to debunk the ideas of the Gothic revival, so dear to mid-century designers and decorators. In his view the thirteenth-century architects had been primarily technicians, engineers in fact; as for decoration, they had used it to soften and humanize the austerity of the pointed arch, so well adapted to sustaining the most daring ;\n\nthrusts of their architecture.\n\nBut where Viollet-le-Duc showed himself most prophetic and influential was in his suggestion that it might be possible to erect an armature a lightweight metal skeleton and cover it with masonry. Thirty years later, Sullivan, Horta, Frantz Jourdain, Perret, and Tony Gamier, replacing stone with iron, concrete, and glass, bore witness to his genius. Just how far he anticipated and shaped Art Nouveau can be seen from the tributes paid him by Camillo Boito, Berlage, and even Gaudi. Viollet-le-Duc was a rationalistic force; and although legend had tended to\n\n—\n\n—\n\nARCHITECTURE\n\nI4\n\nGoncourt of the medieval movement, in reality he was like Otto Wagner and Mackintosh. His ultimate ambition, like theirs, was to conceive architecture as an integral whole which, \"in order to be aesthetically pleasing, must be functurn\n\nhim\n\ninto a disciple of Lenoir, a kind of\n\ntional.\"\n\nFrench Art Nouveau architecture belongs almost exclusively to what we shall call the Latin school, as distinct from the Scottish and Viennese schools. In France, Guimard created this architecture; but to Perret belongs the honor of having subjugated the excesses of the movement, preventing it from suffocating in its own preciosity, and saving it from premature decease.\n\nGuimard showed courage and imagination\n\nBéranger in Paris (1897) the extent of his courage and imagination can be seen by taking a walk along the Boulevard Haussmann, the Rue de Maubeuge, or the Rue de la Pompe. It was in this building that for the first time, at least in France, the principles of Art Nouveau had been embodied in a house built expressly for leasing to middle-class tenants. The Castel Béranger gave people a shock; at the time, it was described as \"a building which seems to have sprung up out of nothing.\" Moreover, its perfectly integrated design was an unkind comment on the banality of the surrounding architecture. As in the work of Horta, symmetry and the straight line had been eliminated wherever possible, yet the building as a whole had a curiously unified air. Both inside and out, Guimard allowed lavish scope for sculpture and color; by using a two-toned variety of brick, and also a glazed brick with a graduated blue shade, he succeeded in creating a distinguished chromatic effect both on the façade and in the inner courtyards, similar to that achieved by Otto Wagner at 40 Linke Wienzeil in Vienna. Like Horta, Guimard designed buildings in complete detail, even specifying the locks and bolts, fastenings for windows, the tradesmen's entrance, and the fireplaces (a remarkable example is found in the concierge's room in the Rue La Fontaine house of 1908). In a house on the Avenue de Versailles he made use of a bend in the stairs, between one floor and another, as the place for a couch, which becomes an integral part of the general décor. He surrounded doors with hypnotic arabesques, his fireplaces seem to blaze by themselves, and his perversely twisting lines have nothing to learn from the allurements of the Sezession Style. Destiny, it seemed, intended this unusual art to be placed within everyone's reach Guimard was commissioned to design station entrances for the Métro (plate 1 14) Up from the sidewalk there sprang a profusion of interlacing metal, bouquets of aquatic plants, luminous tulips, gorged with in designing the Castel\n\n;\n\n:\n\n.\n\nthe rich disturbing sap of Paris,\n\nImprisoned in\n\nhis\n\nown\n\nits\n\ncellars,\n\naestheticism,\n\nand\n\nsubsoil.\n\nGuimard began\n\nwell in 1908, as seen in the enchanting private house at 60\n\ntime Peter Behrens,\n\nTony\n\nVan\n\n—which he did very\n\nimitating himself\n\nRue La Fontaine\n\n(plate 5).\n\nBut by\n\nthis\n\nde Velde, and Frank Lloyd Wright had appeared on the scene, and had been in existence for seven years.\n\nGarnier's prodigious plan for the city of Lyons\n\nm\n\nAt the beginning of the century a certain number of French architects, stimulated by contact with German theorists, became passionately interested in exterior decoration. Their desire for active collaboration with artists in wrought iron and sculptors in wood or stone enabled them to achieve a striking unity in the finished building.\n\nThe mansion by Georges\n\nRue d'Orléans\n\nat Neuilly .(about 1904), was the and the decorative sculptor, Armand Seguin. Seguin displayed an aptitude for composition which lent gaiety to a commonplace façade.

It is true that his excitable, emotional style sometimes runs off into superfluities, but his well-modeled masses and his decorative motifs are felicitously blended together. The façade of 29 Boulevard de Gourcelles, Paris, with sculptures by Rouvière, shows the architect's desire to attain a flexible form in the modeling of the stone. The surface is shaped into wavelets which rise gently from the stone and melt back into it; the effect is one of planes interpenetrating and fusing. But simplification of some of the decorative detail (overlapping foliage, flowers, and shells) would have been an improvement. Like Charles Plumet, Schoellkopf continually conceals his appetite for Art Nouveau under imitation eighteenth-century effects; both these architects appear to\n\nhave\n\nfelt slightly\n\nashamed of their predilection\n\nfor this\n\nodd new\n\nstyle.\n\nPlumet, a \"rationalistic Symbolist,\" was one of the first to humanize the appearance of commercial buildings by reconciling the medievalist leanings of his contemporaries with the financial demands of the real-estate developers. Like many architects of his time, Plumet wanted art to be everywhere: in the concierge's room, on bakers' shopfronts, in brasseries. Reactions were sharp: \"Ever more insolently, art is slopping out into the streets, on the fronts of shops and houses What a disgraceful mess If you want something outstanding you must look to men of outstanding talent; if not, be content to have something decent and ordinary\" (Camille Mau!\n\nclair)\n\nMauclair are merely a symptom of the ambiguous state of affairs which arises whenever an important new creative development is in question. (A similar situation arose around 1948, when art directors in the film world were handing out Surrealism of the kind\n\nThe\n\nstrictures of\n\nusually associated with hairdressing establishments.)\n\nPlumet and\n\nhis,\n\npartner\n\nTony Selmersheim enriched\n\nthe Paris scene with a\n\nnumber\n\nof ele-\n\ngantly designed buildings which have since disappeared (the entrance of the Hôtel du Havre, the\n\nKohler chocolate shop, the Maison Cadolle, the establishment of Roddy the shirtmaker, and the Restaurant Edouard in the Place Boïeldieu). Among buildings by this partnership which have escaped destruction, 39 Avenue Victor-Hugo claims our attention by a certain stylishness and a somewhat forbidding sobriety although it might have been improved with a little warmth, a touch of madness somewhere. The decorative stonework, whose airy, supple carving is by Lucien Schnegg, is nicely in harmony with the façade. The architect L. P. Marquet succeeded in marrying new forms with an apparently classical style. His bow windows are incorporated into the façade by ingenious floral decorations. In the front doors of the Rue Hermel and at 2 bis Avenue des Gobelins in Paris, Marquet felicitously combined wrought iron with the stone carvings of Emile Derré and Seguin.\n\n—\n\nAuguste Perret began his career in the Art Nouveau period, as is evident from his building, 119 Avenue de Wagram, Paris. Though the façade hardly forecasts the genius of his future work, several unusual details can be seen: the weight-supporting consoles beautifully integrated with\n\nARCHITECTURE\n\nl6\n\nthe general mass of the building; the two trees climbing audaciously up the front; plicity of the iron balconies, which foreshadow the staircase in the Rue Franklin.\n\nand the sim-\n\nThe residence designed in 1903 by Perret at 25 bis Rue Franklin (plate 15) marked the end of Art Nouveau in Paris, and the erection of the first house in what can properly be called a contemporary style. It was also the first time any architect had used such a diversity of materials\n\n—glazed sheathing, faïence mosaics, glass bricks, asbestos cement, ferro-concrete and concrete —which Perret humorously described as \"rich man's concrete on poor man's concrete.\" tile\n\nJules Lavirotte is undoubtedly one of the most attractive figures of Art Nouveau because, like Gaudi and some of the Italian architects, he was first and foremost a Symbolist. His building in\n\nasymmetrical yet balanced façade, its consoles and their thistle decoration, its hues of greenish gray and faint blue, its roofs which evoke the Gothic past and the more dreamlike parts of German Romantic literature, is one of the strangest buildings in the world. His Ceramic Hôtel in the Avenue de Wagram, with its pebble-dash decoration by Bigot, soon acquired an appearance of preciosity equal to that of the Chinese pavilion at Drottningholm, built two centuries earlier. Lavirotte was more decorator than architect; this is what distinguishes him from Horta and Guimard. He tended to get carried away and to exaggerate, and though the parts are often admirably unusual, they do not always add up to a happily integrated whole, a charge which can never be brought against Guimard. The disappointing curve described by French architectural development can be gauged by looking at the Liceo Italiano at 12 Rue Sédillot (1899), then at 151 Rue de Grenelle, and finally at 23 Avenue de Messine (1908). Like Horta, and probably for the same reasons (middle-class clients' passion for imitation Louis XVI), Lavirotte retreated into prudent conformism. the\n\nAvenue Rapp,\n\nParis (plate 4), with\n\nits\n\nBetween 1900 and 191 o most architects borrowed from the new style, some because they really wanted to, others because it was the fashion; touches of Art Nouveau can even be found on exteriors dated 1930. Along some main Parisian arteries, such as the Avenue des Gobelins, Avenue Victor-Hugo, Avenue Henri-Martin, and Boulevard Raspail, dozens of buildings show similar traces.\n\nGuimard and the School of Nancy was great in the provinces as well. The works of Mienville and Eugène Vallin, who designed the entrance gallery of the Decorative Arts\n\nThe\n\ninfluence of\n\nTheir buildings, and especially those of Vallin (often named as the leader of the School of Lorraine), are well balanced and have great power; they are closer to Guimard than to Lavirotte, but often lack the grace of the first and the singularity of the second. Weissenburger, who designed the Magasins Réunis de Nancy, continued what Emile Galle had begun; his style is characterized by the use of wide bays separated by robust pillars with clean, sober lines. About 1903 or 1904, various building firms put up what were called \"hygienic dwellings\" for tenants of modest means, such as members of the liberal professions and the lower ranks of the civil service. Despite low costs and the unpromising soubriquet, architects like Henri Sauvage and C. Sarazin did manage in some cases to give these houses a pleasant, welcoming appearance. Instances can be found in the Rue Damrémont and at 7 Rue Trétaigne in Paris the fronts of these houses have a pair of bow windows, each window being surrounded with tiles and surmounted by a rounded cornice. The brightly painted window frames, the stained-glass windows lighting the stairs, and the floral decoration of the banisters, all combined to give the visitor an artistic impression. Finally, an interesting new note was struck by bathrooms embellished with Exhibition in Nancy, are characteristic of the style of that\n\ncity.\n\n;\n\nARCHITECTURE decorative\n\ntiles,\n\nthe\n\n17\n\nfirst\n\nattempt in France to make such installations beautiful as well as com-\n\nfortable.

Fanciful, saucy,\n\nmoments' contemplation. Built on plans imported from England, they were in most instances adapted to French ways of life by the architect Bliault. The price had no paneling, and a minimum of to be kept down; these little houses were economically built other interior woodwork; no moldings and often no wainscoting, so that sweeping and dusting were made easy. The usual price was 7,000 francs (about $3,000 at that time); furniture, designed by the architect, came to about 1,500 francs; and another 500 francs went toward painting and decorating. To sum up this section, we can say that between 1895 and 19 10, French architecture remained dainty, they well deserve a few\n\n—\n\ndecorative rather than functional; in eluding the clutches of historicism (the recent rediscovery\n\nof the eighteenth century by the Goncourt brothers was fell\n\ninto the pitfalls of\n\nextricating\n\nstill\n\nSymbolism, from which only Perret\n\nmuch in the air), it frequently and Tony Gamier were capable of very\n\nit.\n\nITALY Apart from a few new achievements such\n\nas the\n\nCafé Pedrocchi, built in Padua by Giuseppe\n\nJappelli in 181 6, and famous for a façade which succeeds in being both academic and functional, Italy in the nineteenth century\n\nremained\n\nfaithful to the traditional glories of\n\nher architectural\n\nand Sangallo. After the Risorgimento, the appearance of Italian cities began to change, a process to which speculative builders had, inevitably, contributed. By constructing new main avenues, the Italian emulators of Haussmann modified the archaic character of Rome and Milan; they gave these cities a bourgeois \"New Look.\" The middle of the nineteenth century was the heyday of bourgeois historicism throughout Europe. The monument to King Victor Emmanuel erected in front of the Forum in Rome, and the Galleria dei Mercanti which was put up in Milan to connect the Piazza del Duomo with La Scala, were dubbed \"Stile Umbertino.\" Out of an entire generation of conventionally oriented colleagues, the Roman architect Gamillo Boito, about 860, was one of the first Europeans to argue the priority of function over decoration. (Berlage was to do the same thing some twenty years later in Amsterdam.) In 1871, Boito built the hospital at Gallarate. He achieved the feat of putting the service rooms all on the same level, and he kept his decoration simple; the building is functional, but the monotonous severity of the bare brick walls is broken here and there by a frieze with a trefoil motif, and by the ornamental metalwork of windows and gutters. The Ricovero dei Musicisti (Milan, 1899) confirms the fact that Boito remained a servant of historicism and never became a real adherent of Art Nouveau. The birth of the Stile Floreale, the name given in Italy to Symbolistic Art Nouveau, is elusive. No date can be assigned to it. From 1885 onward, in Turin and more particularly in Milan (in and near the Via Mozart), buildings with unfamiliar outlines began to appear. This may have been an effect of the historical ties between Northern Italy and Austria, or it may have been due to the influence of Symbolism. But many of these Floreale houses exhibit a Mannerist character, a feeling accentuated by curious statues which seem to explode from the stone.\n\npast: Palladio, Vignola,\n\n1\n\nARCHITECTURE deserve a special place in the architectural history of this period: Raimondo d'Aronco, whose buildings reflect his admiration for the Sezession and for orientalism; and Giuseppe Sommaruga, in whom the Floreale tendency was impregnated at once with his-\n\nTwo men\n\nand modernity.\n\ntoricism\n\nRaimondo d'Aronco\n\nstands out as the most important Italian architect of his generation. In\n\ndominated by Romantic historicism; such are the Porta Tenaglia (Milan, 1882), the façade of the architectural exhibition in Turin (1890), and the Ponte Maria Teresa (Turin, 1893). The latter reminds one of another bridge, at that time still unbuilt, the Pont Alexandre III in Paris. It was not long before the artist in him threw off the restraints of orthodoxy and allowed his imagination to range at will. In 1899, after a violent earthquake devastated much of Constantinople, D'Aronco was invited to Turkey by Sultan Abdul Hamid. Like Gaudi in Barcelona, Josef Maria Olbrich in Darmstadt, and Sullivan in Chicago, but in his own fashion, D'Aronco sought to fuse traditional Moslem art and the spirit of Art Nouveau. In Constantinople, in 1900, he designed a slender, tall, gaily impudent house for Edem Bey which, with its sloping roof, makes one think of a young woman, her hat perched on the side of her head and coming down over one eye. D'Aronco was represented at the Exhibition of Decorative Arts in Turin (1902). Nothing now survives of that remarkable display; only from photographs (see plate 23) can we conjure up a mental picture of its extravagance, its exaggerations, its Mannerism. The exhibition sounded the his early\n\nworks he was\n\nstill\n\ndeath knell of the Stile Liberty. With the passing of the years, D'Aronco's imagination progressively dried up; his Palazzo Communale at Udine (1909) shows a partial return to the clichés of orthodoxy.\n\nThe\n\narchitectural style of Sommaruga has the peculiar interest of providing a bridge between\n\nand rationalism. A passionate proponent of Boito's theories, he built, in 1901, the Casa Castiglioni in Milan (plates 21 and 22). This rebellious masterpiece, with its striking decoration and its base of bare, rusticated blocks of labradorite, seems at first glance to be in the Baroque tradition, a late Baroque which has nothing in common with Horta's \"Whiplash\" manner or with the abstract, increasingly stylized forms pursued in Glasgow, Vienna, and Darmstadt. It was by his handling of contrasting planes that Sommaruga showed his modernity eclecticism\n\nhave been a feeling for space. The staircase, one had an especially intoxicating effect on this importance, becoming as it were the respiratory system of the\n\nin this building; his guiding principle seems to\n\nof the functional themes which appears to have architect, acquires\n\nmaximum\n\nbuilding as a whole.\n\nSommaruga\n\nbuilt a\n\nnumber of villas, of which\n\nthe most remarkable\n\nis\n\nthe Villa Faccanoni at\n\nuntrimmed masonry, abounds in a forty-five-degree angle over the main door,\n\nSarnico. This most unusual dwelling, rising from a base of\n\ntwin vaulting which intersects at elliptical bow windows, and little Gaudiesque tufts of stone crowning the roof. In 1908, on a hill overlooking Varese, Sommaruga embarked on the construction of a hotel; the result, with its two main blocks connected by a high, vaulted passageway, is something titanic, bizarre, and almost frightening.\n\ninteresting details\n\nTo sum\n\n:\n\nup, Art\n\nNouveau\n\narchitecture in Italy was the\n\nDelightful buildings in this key are to be found here in Sicily;\n\nand\n\nno one can remember who designed them.\n\nwork of\n\nisolated individualists.\n\nthere, at Pesaro (plate 25), Florence, or\n\nARCHITECTURE\n\n19\n\nSPAIN In the course of a journey in Catalonia toward the middle of the nineteenth century, Queen Isabella II conferred her approval on the plan for extending Barcelona. The Ensanche, the wide,\n\nwhich surrounds the old town, became the training ground for young men from Barcelona's new school of architecture, founded in 1880. Census figures tell what was achieved: in i860, Barcelona had 17,000 houses and 200,000 inhabitants; by 1905, the figures became 40,000 and 600,000 respectively. In addition, due to the contributions of Gaudi, Barcelona had once more regained her stature as an artistic and liberal center temporarily free of gently sloping plain\n\nSpanish (Catalonians consider themselves Catalonians,\n\nnot\n\nSpaniards) domination.\n\nAntoni Gaudi was born at Reus, Catalonia, in 1852. He showed an inclination for drawing and architecture from early youth. In 1869, he entered the old School of Architecture in Barcelona, but had to earn the money for his fees and so did not take his diploma until eight years later. Between 1870 and 1880 he worked as assistant under Juan Martorell and José Fontseré on a large number of commissions, one of which was the monumental waterfall in the Parque Ciudadela in Barcelona. Interested in technique rather than aesthetics, young Gaudi was at this stage still deeply under the influence of medieval architecture. In 1880, he completed the Casa Vicens (plate 26), which gives a foretaste of all his work to come, but the full character of his style did not emerge until 1885, when he set about designing the Palau Giiell. A passionately devout Catholic who walked several miles to church every day, and a patriotic Catalan who declared himself unable to speak Spanish properly, Gaudi with his originality and eccentricities is one of the most fascinating characters in the whole history of art. Even his death was strange. At six o'clock on the evening of June 7, 1926, he was knocked down by a trolley bus and dragged along for several yards. No one recognized the victim; he was just an old man raggedly dressed, and the taxi drivers declined to pick him up. He died on June 10, in the public ward of the Santa Cruz Hospital, without regaining consciousness. When his death was announced, all Spain went into mourning, and his funeral two days later was followed by a procession two-and-a-half miles long. Many Catalonians regarded him as a saint. Gaudi's work is based on a profound, abnormal, almost monstrous knowledge of all the styles of the past, which he transmuted with astonishing ease into something all his own. The intense power of his imagination confronts us irresistibly in the double parabolic design of the doorways of the Palau Giiell, mysteriously veiled by the serpentine reticulation of the iron gates behind which they stand. A boundary wall of dressed stone, as sinuous as the brick walls built by John Palmer a century earlier at Bath, encloses the sumptuous park. It carries overtones of medieval castles and modern machine-gun nests; its mosaic decoration, composed of ceramic fragments, bears a resemblance to some of the surfaces contrived by Klimt. About 1900, he gave free rein to his imagination. The chapel of the Colonia Giiell (189819 14) is a most extraordinary attack on conventional architecture and decoration. Everything which normally appears solid and stable (walls, columns, towers, roofs) has been transposed into a new, wild key; architecture and its mathematical laws are translated into the stuff of dreams. In the Casa Milâ (1905-10), Gaudi declared war on everything rectangular. It is as if he had succeeded in making a cast of the ocean surface on a stormy day decoration based on plant life hangs from the, edge of parapets and balconies, as if left stranded by a receding tide. The windows have soft, melting outlines and are placed according to the vagaries of the form, with the result that they reflect the light from a number of angles. The unclassifiably shaped chimneys, formed rather like totem poles, appear to be ready to take wing at the command of a disquieting, ;\n\nmysterious messenger.\n\nARCHITECTURE\n\n20\n\nwould be altogether too simple to catalogue Gaudi's creations under the general heading of Art Nouveau. They make one think of the fantastic flights of certain medieval architects or, again, of what would happen if the torrential verbal visions of Victor Hugo could be cast in conIt\n\ncrete.\n\nnone of them rivaling the genius of Gaudi, also made their contributions to The works of Lluis Domenéch y Montaner belong to Art Nouveau in much the same way as do those of Lavirotte in Paris. Like the latter, and like Sommaruga in Milan, Domenéch y Montaner showed his originality in his irregular windows, the floral designs of his decorative details, and sculptural figures which seem to come surging out from the walls (Paséo de Gracia). He embellished his brick walls with white enamel, blue figures, and coats of arms in curling relief, so that his buildings strike a note of wealth, gaiety, and extravagance. Don Henrique Sagnier used medieval, Rococo, and Art Nouveau effects side by side, not without a certain success and elegance. He had an unusual way with balconies, making them look a little larger than life. The five- windowed mirador projecting from the first story of one of his apartment houses is like the woodwork of an Austrian or Baroque organ. With Don José Puig y Cadafalch and Artiges, traditional Spanish architecture resumed its sway and Catalonian architecture fell into a long, deep sleep.\n\nFour\n\narchitects,\n\nthe beauty of Barcelona.\n\nSCOTLAND Charles Rennie Mackintosh stands out as a leading figure in the history of Art Nouveau. His\n\nno less than his genius and versatility as a designer of decoration, caused the style he created to be named after him. Born in Glasgow, where his father was a police superintendent, Mackintosh found his vocation at an early age; at sixteen he was already working under the architect John Hutchinson and going to evening classes at the Glasgow School of Art. During the next eight years his name was always in the lists of prizewinners at the school. In the National Competition of 1888, he won a bronze medal for a design for a mountain chapel in 1 890, he won the Thomson Prize with a design for a town hall in the classical style. Armed with a scholarship, he set out on a tour of architectural abilities,\n\n;\n\nItaly.\n\nMacNair. He and MacNair later married the Macdonald sisters (Mackintosh married Margaret in 1900), both of whom had some influence on the development of the Glasgow Style. Known as The Four, this coalition of complementary talents quickly won a reputation extending far beyond Glasgow and Scotland, and in 1902 The Four took part in the Turin Exhibition. Mackintosh turned his hand with equal readiness to the design of houses, posters, fabrics, and furniture, and his versatility rapidly caught the attention of artistic circles in Munich, Darmstadt, and Vienna. In 1920 Mackintosh, who had left the group, retired to Port-Vendres, France. Viewed as a whole, the work of Mackintosh reveals a sharp contradiction. His architecture proves he was a modernist. His style, always extremely severe, was subordinated to functional demands, and though it gives off an occasional whiff of musty Celticism, it reflects the rigid standards of his native society, austere and habitually devoted to industrial work. But he was also an aesthete whose hypersensitive sense of line flaunted its charms in \\Jiss Cranston's Buchanan Street Tearooms in Glasgow. Mackintosh's first big architectural job was the Martyr Public School at Glasgow (1895). The While\n\nstill\n\na student he\n\ndoor, despite a bulky portico,\n\nbecame\n\nis\n\nfriendly with Herbert\n\na success otherwise this massive building, with ;\n\nits tall\n\nrectangular\n\nARCHITECTURE\n\n21\n\nthoroughly commonplace. But with the new Glasgow School of Art, in 1897 (Library Wing in 1907-09), he showed his mettle (plate 32); difficulties brought out the best in him, as they did in Gaudi. He took advantage of the sloping site to make the front of the building rise up\n\nwindows,\n\nis\n\nsheer for eighty feet, giving the impression of a Highland stronghold. Like\n\nGodwin\n\nEdward William\n\nWhite House, Mackintosh mellowed a large blank wall by piercing it with small windows placed asymmetrically, and the drainpipe from the gutter was exploited to emphasize the midline of the pattern. The northern part of the building, with its enormous bays and irregular arrangement of windows (four in the west wall, three in the east), strikes a different note from the rest. The entrance would appear overbearing were it not for the curving ironwork support at the foot of the stairs, which restores the visual balance. The impression of height from the south and west aspects is increased by the vertical rectangular block jutting out from the façade, dominating the main entrance. The appearance of the building as a whole is that of an impregnain the\n\nble fortress.\n\n90 1, Mackintosh built Windy Hill, at Kilmacolm. At first glance, the outside of this small country house offers nothing surprising to a Continental eye, but certain details (the chimneys, the boundary wall through which the front gate passes, and the shifting planes of the In\n\n1\n\nfrom the same hand as the School of Art. Hill House (190203) shows Mackintosh's imagination in a quieter mood (plate 31) this country house, complete with dovecot, is less functional than the rest of his work. The fundamental differences between the architectural thinking of Mackintosh and that of Guimard or Sommaruga remind us yet again that Art Nouveau was a movement rather than a walls of the house itself) are clearly\n\n;\n\nstyle.\n\nAUSTRIA By ordening\n\nthe demolition of the ancient fortifications of Vienna\n\nand building the Ringstrasse, a\n\nEmperor Franz Joseph opened the capital to new sources of incentury the city had been subjugated to that overpowering, solemn, bour-\n\ngreat external boulevard, the spiration.\n\nFor half a\n\nwhich has been so well named the \"Bureaucratic Style.\" In 1897, the architects Otto Wagner, Joseph Maria Olbrich, Josef Hoffmann, Koloman Moser, and Adolf Loos, united by their resolve to shatter the conservative spirit of Viennese\n\ngeois architecture\n\n—\n\nformed a group and made their breakaway the Sezession, as their movement came to be called and, with it, the whole of Austrian Art Nouveau. It was, incidentally, just at this period that Freud's early studies first became available to the public in book form. Whereas in England, Scotland, France, Belgium, and Italy, Art Nouveau grew out of the old familiar styles, such as medieval or Rococo, in Vienna no connection can be drawn between Austrian traditional styles and the Sezession. Indeed, the creations of Hoffmann and Loos are visible evidence of the disdain of that generation of artists toward the Mannerist Baroque which had been held in highest esteem in their country for nearly three centuries. Another striking fact, paralleled only by the difference between Barcelona and the rest of Spain, is that no Austrian city other than Vienna was excited by Sezessionism. society,\n\nOtto Wagner occupies a preponderant position in the history of Austrian architecture, but because he was of the Symbolist generation his relation to Art Nouveau is ambiguous, rather like that of Gustave Moreau in painting. Wagner's titanic achievement, with its variety and apparent contradictions, is often hard to define. As early as 1863, he put forward a revolutionary project for the Kursalon in Vienna's\n\nARCHITECTURE\n\n22\n\nmunicipal park. In 1880, after building a number of apartment houses, he designed the Artibus building and the offices of the Giro und Kassenverein, in which he epitomized all the fundamentals of European architecture, in so far as the latter can be regarded as a definable entity. In 1 89 1, he produced a project for the Berlin Cathedral in which, despite an accumulation of superfluous accessory features, the underlying vigor of the structure makes itself felt. In 1894, he built the Kaufhaus Neumann; the pure, austere lines of its rectangular façade, ornamented with floral designs, prefigured his future work. The same elimination of inessentials appeared in the Ankerhaus (1894), a work which reminds us of Sullivan's Wainwright Building in St. Louis and the\n\nGuaranty Building\n\nin Buffalo.\n\nIn his inaugural lecture at the Vienna Academy in the same year, Wagner declared: \"Only what is practical is beautiful,\" and again: \"The essence of the structure of a building, and the material employed, must be\n\nleft visible.\"\n\nWagner's project for the Hofburg, in 1898, showed how Van de Velde's \"déblaiement d'art\" the clearing of the ground in the arts, had been put into practice. Decorative encumbrances were banished and the architectural mass thus purified had an undeniable majesty of its own. The curious project for the\n\nand\n\nits\n\nsober lines\n\nStadtmuseum\n\n(1901), with\n\nits\n\nhappy\n\ndistribution of the principal masses\n\n—-marred, however, by an exaggeratedly statuesque quality— at the same time\n\nand forward to the world of tomorrow. Between 1903 and 1907, Wagner built the church of Sankt Leopold and the Postal Savings Bank (plate 35). The Villa Wagner (191 2) proclaimed that he had left the Sezession behind and was henceforward a European. The most substantial figure among Austrian architects and decorators of the early twentieth century was Josef Hoffmann. Born at Pirnitz (Moravia), he campaigned for the reform of Austrian aestheticism from the beginning of his student days, when he entered the Austrian\n\nlooks back to the Symbolist period\n\nof Fine Arts. He represented the geometrical element in the Sezession group, the tendency later known as the \"Quadratel Hoffmann.\" In 1898, he collaborated with Olbrich to build the offices of Ver Sacrum, a magazine which played a leading part in spreading the influence of the Sezession. In 1899, with Koloman Moser, he designed the Apollo store, whose decoration, based on the classical volute, shows that Hoffmann had not yet discovered his true path. In 1901, he built a number of small houses on the Hohe Warte in Vienna; the strangest of them is a villa for Koloman Moser, conceived in terms of large planes broken up in various ways an unexpected balcony here, a bow window there. The Punkersdorf Sanatorium (1903) was his first resolutely modern work on a large scale. The rigor of the planes and the limpid structure make it Europe's first attempt at a rational architecture. In 1904, disgusted by the poor quality of Austrian peasant crafts, Hoffmann founded the Wiener Werkstàtte, a group of studios and workshops in which, with the help of professional colleagues, particularly Koloman Moser, he designed furnishings and interior decoration of every kind furniture, carpets, and all the appurtenances of everyday life. Like Van de Velde, Guimard, and Mackintosh, Hoffmann obliterated the distinctions between fine and applied art. He was just thirty-five when he produced the work which above all others bears the characteristic stamp of his genius, the prodigious Palais Stoclet, a private house in Brussels (plate 36). In later years the Hoffmann style, ruthlessly stripped of inessentials, tended toward monotony; his rounded masses, unrelieved by slenderness anywhere, became ponderous. The last traces of\n\nAcademy\n\n—\n\n—\n\nthe Sezession spirit\n\nhad disappeared.\n\nAdolf Loos stands somewhat apart from the other architects and designers of the Sezession. rejected excrescences. Whether he was concerned with business premises (such as the shop for men's clothes, designed by him in Vienna in 1898) or a café (the Café\n\nHe disliked symbols and\n\nARCHITECTURE Museum), fies to his\n\n23\n\nthe emphasis throughout\n\nwas on\n\nstructure.\n\nThe\n\nVilla\n\nKarma\n\nconcentration on the ever more perfect distribution of volumes.\n\n(Geneva, 1904) testiTo him, architecture\n\n\"Every epoch must create its own style.\" As time went on, Loos exhibited an increasing urge toward synthesis: witness the smooth, massive front presented to the world by the Looshaus (Michaelerplatz, Vienna, 191 o). In the Steiner house (Vienna, 19 10) he used big convex surfaces, cubes in step-formation, and plain compact blocks. The façade and interior of the Rufer house (191 2) were completely up to date, based on the latest architectural advances. In 1926, he built a house in Paris for Tristan Tzara and, the following year, a shop for Knize, a firm of shirtmakers, on the Avenue des Champsexisted as a function of new needs:\n\nElysées.\n\nThe\n\nartistic\n\nthe Sezession\n\n;\n\nsuch that one cannot neatly pigeonhole him as a member of Sullivan, Auguste Perret, and Frank Lloyd Wright, he transcends the limits of\n\npersonality of Loos\n\nlike\n\nis\n\nArt Nouveau.\n\nwas not long before the Sezession acquired the stature of a school. The charms of the new movement gained adherents among the younger Hungarian architects, who broke with the Bureaucratic Style and affirmed the existence of a national style in Budapest. Some, like Odon Lechner (plate 38), showed great originality; others, like Karoly Kos and Bêla Zrumeczky, who built the Zoo, and Aladar Arkay, the architect of the Zebegeny church, subscribed to an architecture bearing folk-art overtones, rather like that developed by the Finns. The tendency most closely related to the Hoffmann Quadratel was represented by Bêla Lajta, whose remarkable Rossavolgyi house is most Viennese in feeling, very much a child of the Sezession. Later, Bêla Malnai (who designed the Credit Bank), Moritz Pogâny, and Istvan Medgyaszay (the first Hungarian architect to design a building in reinforced concrete) pioneered in the modernization of urban aesthetics. It\n\nGERMANY The monument talgia for\n\n1797 by Friedrich Gilly, exhibits the nosantiquity which was prevalent at that time in Germany. The same attraction\n\nto Frederick the Great, designed in\n\nRoman\n\nwas one of the ingredients of German Romanticism throughout the nineteenth century; examples of it are the Trinkhalle designed by Heinrich Hiibsch at Baden-Baden in 1840, the Johanneum built in 1836-39 by C. L. Wimmel and G. J. Forsmann in Hamburg, and the museums in Munich by Leo von Klenze, a pupil of Gilly. Soon, however, the clash of Wagnerian cymbals heralded a new arrival, the Rundbogenstil (Romanesque style), a militant architectural movement addicted to a mixture of ancient and musty recipes a passion for the Middle Ages and a nostalgia for romantic fifteenth-century Italy. Germany broke out into a rash of granite and brick, the medium employed by Gottfried Semper at Dresden for the Opera House, the Museum, and the Synagogue, and at Vienna for the\n\n—\n\nBurgtheater.\n\nand the charmingly preposterous castles of Ludwig II of Bavaria. Inspired by the use of iron and glass in France and the United States, he applied the same methods in designing the Wertheim Department Store (plate 83) in Berlin 1 896-1 900). At about that time, intellectual circles -Symbolists and Liberals in Hamburg, Berlin, and Munich, with support from individuals here and there in the ranks of the bourgeoisie, became enamoured of Art Nouveau. Julius Meier-Graefe with his magazine, Pan, Bernard Pankok, Bruno Paul, and Richard Riemerschmid with the Munchener Vereinigte WerkAlfred Messel revolted against historical eclecticism\n\n(\n\n—\n\n—\n\nARCHITECTURE\n\n24\n\n(United Workshops of Munich) played influential parts in Teutonizing the various doctrines from abroad. But though Jugendstil (youth style) showed real originality in typography, posters, furniture,\n\nstdtte\n\nand the decorative arts, its success in the architectural field is by no means so clear. With the exception of August Endell, the Germans were receptive rather than creative. It was in 1897 that Endell was called in to design the studio of the photographer Elvira (plate 39). The façade was all straight lines -it brings to mind Perret's Théâtre des ChampsElysées (1913)- Within this frame the windows and doors were placed asymmetrically; their upper corners were cut off and rounded, and the leading of the window panes described whimsi-\n\n—\n\ncal arabesques.\n\nMany Germans\n\nfound\n\nthis variety\n\nsimplicity of the Sezession or the\n\nof Mannerism too Latin for their taste they preferred the ;\n\nEdinburgh School, which had appeared on\n\n1898, in Mackintosh's contributions to the\n\nMunich\n\ntheir horizon in\n\nExhibition.\n\nBetween 1898 and 19 10, three men devoted themselves to ensuring the triumph of the Jugendstil: Olbrich, Peter Behrens, and Van de Velde. By his design for the Sezession building at the Vienna Exhibition in 1898, an astonishing structure which prefigures the work of Hoffmann, Olbrich (plate 34) asserted his independence agner. It was this not only of the Austrian classical school, but also of his early mentor, Otto building which, in the following year, earned him the task of planning a miniature city of the arts on the Mathildenhôhe, in the suburbs of Darmstadt. The Grand Duke Ernst Ludwig of Hessen-Darmstadt, an ardent admirer of the new creative architecture in Britain, financed the\n\nW\n\nT\n\nundertaking.\n\nOlbrich achieved a remarkable synthesis of British and Viennese theories, and in so doing abolished\n\nall traces\n\nof Symbolism and historical lyricism.\n\nThe whole complex\n\nof buildings on the\n\nwhose design Behrens was also involved, took over ten years to complete. The finished work is less than homogeneous, so that it hardly seems possible to speak of a \"Darmstadt style,\" and certain features the shapes of some of the roof-ridges, the colors of mosaics, the bottom of the reflection pool (plate 42), the porch of the Ernst Ludwig Haus (plate 41), and the fountainlike roof of the Hochzeitsturm (plate 44) show a decided infusion of Mathildenhôhe\n\n(plates 41-44), in\n\n—\n\n—\n\norientalism.\n\nmaking\n\nMathildenhôhe, took part in the Turin Exhibition of 1902, and the Dusseldorf Exhibition of 1904. A disciple of Mackintosh, Voysey, Sullivan, and Hoffmann, as time went on he modernized what he had learned from them and adapted it to suit German taste. In 1 910, he produced designs for the turbine factory of the AEG ( Allgemeine Elektrizitàts Gesellschaft) in Berlin, which stamp him definitively as a man of the Peter Behrens, after\n\nhis contribution to the\n\ntwentieth century.\n\nGerman architecture over the last fifty years has received an equally strong imprint from Van de Velde who, after spending some time at Krefeld, designed several buildings (examples are the Folkwang Museum at Hagen and, in 19 14, the Werkbund Theater in Cologne). To sum up, we may say of the Jugendstil and the Darmstadt School, those remarkable offshoots of the Sezession, that both of them, especially the latter, if not always successful in\n\nup to Otto Wagner's dictum, \"Only what is practical is beautiful,\" did succeed in clearing the air. They counteracted the intoxicating influence of Symbolistic idealism on a Germany still throbbing sympathetically to the memory of Wagnerian cyclones, and thus prepared the way for Walter Gropius and the Bauhaus.\n\nliving\n\nARCHITECTURE\n\n25\n\nENGLAND For the average Londoner, unversed in architectural problems, it would be difficult to describe the progress made between 1830 and 1900. New ground was won discreetly, not by sweeping revolutionary advances; we must look for it in matters of detail. Nineteenth-century London had two faces. One was classical, elegant, and contained the character imposed by Soane and Thomson on public buildings and investment buildings; the medieval, Queen Anne, and the Gothic Revival, which eventually grew other was \"period\" into High Victorian Gothic. The men who, between i860 and 19 10, were to transform traditional architecture were recruited mainly from the medievalists. Unlike the Europeans and the Americans, the English were not much interested in the problems of designing big buildings or big groups of buildings; they devoted themselves to improving the structure and decoration of private houses. The heavy English cottage, half buried in the damp soil, and burdened with its clusters of chimneys, was to become lighter, rise to the surface, and open out to the light. In 1859, with the Red House (built in Bexley Heath, Kent, for William Morris), Philip Webb, friend and collaborator of Morris, blazed several unobtrusive little trails which in time became a the path leading to English Art Nouveau. The brick walls of the Red House are a composition of successive vertical planes which are broken here and there by a gutter or by a room jutting out on a slender console (this reminds one of the slim supporting column used forty years later by Lavirotte in Paris in a corner of the Square Rapp), the purpose of which was to counterbalance the chimney stack. It was at this period that Webb, Ford Madox Brown, Edward Burne-Jones, and Dante Gabriel Rossetti, the leaders of the Arts and Crafts movement, set up the firm of Morris and Company with a capital of £100; their aim was to revitalize the dwelling house and every-\n\n—\n\n—\n\nthing in\n\nit.\n\nEven before the Glasgow School started, there were a few architects who had had enough of medievalist flummeries and were turning in the direction of the purely functional. The contrasts of light and dark in the White House (plate 45), built in London in 1879 by William Godwin for his friend, James McNeill Whistler, its asymmetry, and the unfinished look of the façade (a lapse from good taste by conventional standards), prefigure some of Le Corbusier's works. Unobtrusively, Richard Norman Shaw showed similar preoccupations. Though less severe than the White House, his Old Swan House, London (1876), is remarkable for the irregular arrangement of the seven windows on the third floor, an asymmetry which is cleverly masked by the projection of three of them outward from the façade. The decorative tracery and stylized foliage on the masorlry band dividing the ground floor from the first floor are particularly happy touches. The light-colored horizontals, standing out against their background of dark brick, impart a decided vigor to the building. Holy Trinity Church, Latimer Road, London (1887), also by Shaw, proved that gaiety could replace the gloom so frequently associated with religious buildings in this case the effect was achieved by the airy, graceful lines of the leading in the ;\n\nstained-glass windows. Shaw's inspiration\n\nDutch\n\nstyle of his\n\nwas diverse; he passed from the perfectly orthodox\n\nLondon (1879), to tiresome exercises in the manner of London (1905), is different from both of these. He is an\n\nAlbert Hall Mansions,\n\nLedoux, while the Piccadilly Hotel, example of how difficult it is to apply to the English architects of the end of the century a\n\nsingle,\n\nsimple definition or descriptive phrase.\n\nThe work of Charles Harrison Townsend is closer to European ideas than any of his contemporaries. The front of the Whitechapel Art Gallery (plate 47), one of the most startling buildings in London, is like a fortress designed by a Moslem for a Spanish king; the doorway, with its Gaudiesque arch, strikes an exotic note in English architecture. In the Church of St. Mary the Virgin at Great Warley, in Essex (1904), Townsend, with the assistance of Sir William ReynoldsStevens, created something which was entirely Art Nouveau certain details of the interior are reminiscent of Josef Hoffmann's decoration, and the pillars are clenched to their bases in a way ;\n\nwhich\n\nrecalls a device that\n\nhad already been used by Horta\n\nin the\n\nMaison du Peuple\n\nin Brussels.\n\nARCHITECTURE\n\n26\n\nArthur Heygate Mackmurdo, one of the most dexterous figures of the whole Arts and Crafts movement, was responsible for the celebrated Cadogan Gardens, London (1899); the private mansion there, with the purity of its unornamented façade featuring strong parallel lines with vertical emphasis, and its oblong windows nearly two stories high, reminds one of German and Austrian buildings of the same period. The works of W. R. Lethaby (for instance, Avon Tyrrel, Hampshire, 1891), with their careful arrangement of masses and the geometrical simplicity of the forms employed, with calculated contrasts between lines, are related to both the Viennese school\n\nand\n\nto that of\n\nMack-\n\nintosh.\n\nCharles Francis Annesley Voysey, at the outset of his career, took a much livelier interest in decoration than in architecture. His earliest buildings had a stocky, very Queen Anne appearance, but soon, in his houses in Bedford Park (1891) and Hans Road (plate 50), he displayed an urge toward a more sophisticated refinement. Given a small site and having to build high in\n\nconsequence, he avoided the narrow-gutted look which afflicts so many London houses by proportioning the windows in such a way as to give breadth and lightness to the façade. But it\n\ncountry houses (plate 48), yet at the same time preserving traditional appearances, that Voysey really made his mark. His ideas seemed so new and original that he became even better known than the young Frank Lloyd Wright.\n\nwas by radically transforming the\n\nstyle of English\n\nIn the Julian Sturgis house (1899) and \"The Orchard,\" Chorley Wood (1900), Voysey handled rectangular windows in groups of four in such a way as to give the gabled fronts of these houses a simplicity which borders on perfection.\n\nAn\n\nbe found inside the unusual staircase and banisters, for example, and the way the brickwork of the hearth makes a frame for the fire. Like Wright, Voysey leveled off the chimneys with the top of the roof, thus lightening and simplifying the form of these small houses. As is the case with Sullivan, Behrens, and Perret, Voysey's insistence on simplicity of line makes him a man of the twentieth century rather than a practitioner of Art Nouveau. equally startling\n\nflair is to\n\nIn 1904, in London, the designer and architect Charles Robert Ashbee built 38 Cheyne Walk, Chelsea (plate 51), one of the most harmoniously conceived houses of the earliest part of the century. Like the sixteenth-century Italians, he juggled with visual effects, framing the front door with an arch, and sketching an imaginary porch with a thin half circle of wrought iron.\n\nAnd though excessively like\n\nrooms were adequately lighted forced him to use high windows, he restored the balance with an asymmetrical pediment which soars the necessity of ensuring that his\n\nan arrow.\n\nSo varied was English architectural talent at this period that it hardly seems possible to speak The main conclusion seems to be that, between 1850 and 19 10, the best English architects strove to break the chains of historicism, but they were not invariably successful in doing so. In general, Latin and Symbolist influences did not take hold in Great Britain. Harrison Townsend's few essays in this direction, and the highly Parisian Michelin Garage in London (plate 75) were, so to speak, medicinal doses of a Continental Art Nouveau of which the islanders had no great opinion. of English Art Nouveau.\n\nARCHITECTURE\n\n27\n\nHOLLAND Holland remained deeply loyal to her own architectural traditions. Her charming small houses, many of them dating from the \"golden age,\" proved perfectly adaptable to the needs of local life under modern conditions and, as ever, were admirably integrated with the landscape. To satisfy urban needs, P. J. H. Cuypers and subsequently Berlage were commissioned to design large-scale complexes, such as railway stations. Cuypers, classically trained and unimaginative, built the Rijksmuseum and the Amsterdam Central Station in the medieval style. To Berlage fell the task of rejuvenating large-scale architecture without running counter to Dutch style and national character. But first came his trip to Chicago. He also fortified himself by studying the techniques of Boito, Sullivan, and Frank Lloyd Wright. Only after this preparation did he undertake the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. Although he used ornament sparingly, avoided gratuitous effects, and restored large flat surfaces to their proper value, Berlage, like Godwin, Shaw, and Richardson, could not refrain from little, over-picturesque details here and there.\n\nThe town-planning\n\nideas he achieved in\n\nAmsterdam and The Hague\n\n(see\n\nplate 52)\n\nmade\n\nTo contemplate the works of this sturdy Dutchman takes us into an entirely different world from the exotic Symbolist blooms of Horta, Guimard, or Sommaruga.\n\nBerlage the indisputable leader of the younger generation in Holland.\n\nUNITED STATES Until the middle of the nineteenth century, American architects were followers of François\n\nMansart, Claude-Nicolas Ledoux, and Sir John Soane, and despite a marked bias in favor of pediments and colonnades they created many highly elegant, graceful buildings: witness\n\nThomas\n\nWalter's State Capitol building, Columbus, Ohio (1839-61) James Bucklin's Washington Buildings, Providence, Rhode Island ( 1 843) William Strickland's Philadelphia Merchant's ;\n\n;\n\nExchange (1832-34); and Russell Warren's buildings at Newport. Consequently, when James Bogardus designed the Laing Stores in New York, in 1849, one of the first functional buildings, he was not so much reacting against the vices of an American historicism as responding to the needs of a nation of businessmen and industrialists. American contractors subscribed to the revolution in building techniques sooner than did their European counterparts. New materials (iron, concrete, Bessemer steel) were used by William LeBaron Jenney in Chicago, and Elisha Graves Otis presented the first elevator at the New York International Fair in 1853. Innovations like these made deep inroads on the traditional methods. Soon the new spirit assumed visible shape in buildings of monumental character but relatively small dimensions, such as in the Provident Life and Trust Company by Frank Furness, Philadelphia (1879). Bogardus and Jenney were technicians of architecture those who came after them were decorative architects. Henry Hobson Richardson, who was born in New Orleans and studied under Henri Labrouste in Paris, succeeded in his Trinity Church (Boston, 1873-77) an d Crane Library (Quincy, Massachusetts, 1880-83) in assimilating and Americanizing European medievalism to a certain extent. But if we compare Richardson's Marshall Field Wholesale Store (Chicago, 1885-87) with Adler and Sullivan's Wainwright Building (St. Louis, 1890-91), we see that Richardson already belonged to a past epoch. ;\n\nCuriously,\n\nit\n\nwas on the especially\n\nSullivan elected to build his\n\nfirst\n\nmarshy soil of Chicago that the young Louis Sullivan was born in Boston in 1856. In 1872, he\n\ndifficult\n\nskyscrapers.\n\nARCHITECTURE\n\n28\n\nentered the office of Frank Furness as a student, but the current economic depression caused him to return to Chicago a year later and take a job under William LeBaron Jenney. In 1874, he decided to go to Paris and become a pupil of Emile Vaudremer (designer of the Église SaintPierre in Montrouge), from\n\nwhom\n\nhe acquired the orientalist leanings which became one of the\n\ncharacteristics of his work.\n\nIn 1 88 1, Sullivan (in partnership with Dankmar Adler) built the Rothschild Store in Chicago which, with its four stories of large glass windows, was an early embodiment of spatial exploration with the accent on light. The Ryerson Building (Chicago, 1884) shows us a Sullivan still under the influence of Richardson, but it has an unusual façade composed of rectangular elements stamped, as it were, on contrasting vertical planes. The Troescher Building (1884), the Knisely Building (1884), and the Wirt Dexter Building (1887), all in Chicago, illustrate Sullivan's preoccupation with mass: he distributes masses by tapering his buildings upward. The influence of the new English architecture can be seen in his\n\nsmaller buildings, such as the West Chicago Club (1886). In the same year, work was begun on the Auditorium Building a colossal creation, with foundations of monumental dimensions\n\n—\n\ncarrying a tower weighing 15,000 tons. In the Walker Warehouse (Chicago, 1888-89) the theme of the entrance with its sets of huge double arches is a prelude to the twin volute of the interior stairs.\n\nand form of his buildings to suit the local climate. Thus in the Opera House Block (1890) in Pueblo, Colorado, an amusing pastiche reminiscent of Florentine palazzos, the windows are sunk into the façade as if they had gone into hiding, whereas in the very Hanseatic style of the St. Nicholas Hotel in St. Louis (1892-93) they show up, in a series of three-sided outward-jutting bays, in the English manner. The Chicago Cold Storage Exchange Warehouse Sullivan varied the size\n\n(1891) is a blind, purely functional, double rectangular mass. Sullivan's work became more and more rigorous as his career proceeded, as seen in the Stock\n\nExchange Building, Chicago (1893), and the Guaranty Building in Buffalo (1895) (plates 56 and 93). And though the façade of the Carson Pirie Scott & Co. Department Store, Chicago (18991904), is robed in exuberant decoration (plate 79), the body of the building is perfectly functional, presaging the architecture of our\n\nown\n\nBELGIUM\n\nday.\n\nm\n\nAbout 1890, tendencies which had first seen the light in England nearly half a century earlier began to appear on the other side of the Channel, but with their scope and impact enlarged. The theories of Morris, Mackmurdo, and Mackintosh, and Liberty's bold ventures, now started fusing with Continental developments.\n\nBetween 1880 and 1890, Brussels became a crucible seething and bubbling with new trends. The process was initiated by Octave Maus, founder of the Cercle des Vingt and the Libre Esthétique movement. Glancing through his book, significantly titled Trente années de lutte pour l'art (\"Thirty Years of Struggle for Art\"), one is dazzled by the richness, boldness, and versatility of his thinking. He organized an exhibition of the sculpture of Rodin in 1884, and of Georges Minne in 1886. The prestige of the Symbolist movement, and also its ambiguities, ensured that everyone whose thoughts were tending in new directions felt himself immediately involved. Van de Velde joined the Libre Esthétique in 1889, and Jan Toorop followed him the year after. Soon the Nabis were to follow suit, and Symbolism triumphant was to assure the victory of a certain Mannerist tendency which was already beginning to appear in Nancy. ,\n\n— ARCHITECTURE The\n\n29\n\nwas to fertilize the majority of European buildings for a number of years. Under his teacher, Alphonse Balat, an orthodox architect of first-rate quality, Horta studied the various creative ways in which Viollet-le-Duc had used iron, and was moved to announce: \"The realization of any and every undertaking involves the empirical execution of a program which is technically appropriate to the purpose in hand.\" As Van de Velde was also to do a little later, Horta eliminated the endless corridors, then in common use, by placing vestibules at different levels so that the other rooms became independent entities. He conferred nobility on the humblest materials stone blocks, steel girders, and rivets. His houses showed their muscles and viscera, as if an anatomist had presented a skeleton not dead but alive; he left exposed everything which Haussmann's architects had been at pains to greatest of all nineteenth-century Belgian architects\n\nwas Victor Horta. His\n\nstyle\n\n—\n\nconceal.\n\nIn Brussels people were scandalized by Horta's work, and the aged Balat, the rebel's former master, was said to have burst into tears on seeing the Tassel residence (1892-93). Within a\n\nand designers from\n\nover Europe were flocking to see Horta's buildings. The Solvay residence (plate 63), which looks more spiky and rococo than the Tassel residence but is in fact more fluent and \"musical,\" expresses the perfect maturity sometimes achieved by\n\nyear, architects\n\nall\n\nArt Nouveau at the crossroads of Latin and Anglo-Saxon impulses. Everywhere, on the exterior and interior, runs the famous Horta line -insidious, sibylline, voluptuous, light as air. In a more vigorous form but airy as ever, it was to reappear in the Van Eetvelde residence it is the magic knot, the common factor connecting all his works. Among the uninspired buildings which surround them, Horta's discreet and harmonious façades make an immediate impression of good taste; the traditional decorative vocabulary of garlands, foliage, masks, caryatids, and lions' muzzles is nowhere to be seen. Won over by Horta's modernism, the Belgian Socialist Party decided that this revolutionary architect was the right man to design their headquarters. The Maison du Peuple (plates 60 and 84) was opened on April 2, 1899, \"to symbolize,\" as the official inscription declares, \"the\n\n—\n\n;\n\nand persevering endeavors of the Brussels working class.\" For some reason critical opposition or perhaps lack of continued bourgeois support Horta's inspiration expired about 1900. It fell to the French, and especially Hector Guimard, to continue and perfect his work. energetic\n\n—\n\nTo find a suitable label for Henry van de Velde is indeed a bafflingly intricate task. Perhaps men of his scope and stature existed in the early thirteenth century, under the wing of Christianity. This Belgian, who worked mainly in Germany but remained essentially Flemish, could and coordinate everything in it and about it; he was also a goldsmith, ship designer, bookbinder, engineer, and typographer. He built residential blocks, museums, and even a hairdresser's salon (Habig's, in Berlin). Ardent but clear-headed, Van de Velde was born to lead the modernist movement. \"The destiny of art,\" he declared in 1894, \"will attain its consummation in the Far East.\" He started as a painter and exhibited in Brussels at the Salon des Vingt, but soon switched over to architecture. In his early work it is difficult to tell how much is due to English and Scottish influences. His first house, Bloemenwerf, in Uccle (plate 59), was built in 1896, and is simply conceived, closely akin to Voysey's manner. After the completion of this house he wrote \"The truth is that just now we are experiencing the dark night of reason. We have come to regard the maddest things as reasonable and the most reasonable ones as madness A stroke of luck has enabled me to build a house, and every time a funeral goes past it, this house makes cheerfulness suddenly and irrepressibly break through the ranks of pallbearers. And yet it differs from the design a house and\n\nits\n\ndecoration,\n\n:\n\nARCHITECTURE\n\n3o\n\nnearby houses only in its modesty and by the fact that it is built in a completely logical way and is devoid of ornament.\" The house does indeed exhibit an exact congruence between design and purpose; the function of every part is clear and unequivocal. In 1897, Julius Meier- Graefe and the Parisian art dealer Samuel Bing commissioned\n\nVan de Exhibition, and in Dresden by which for the time Horta had rooms 1902, Velde to design four abandoned Art Nouveau, Van de Velde was summoned to Weimar. \"The character of all decorative and ornamental work springs from one aim and one only: the application of reason.\" The opportunity had now come for him to apply his theories by embodying them is his own designs. It was during his Weimar period that Van de Velde finally abandoned the symbolic style of ornament so dear to the French (Guimard, Lavirotte) this element appeared henceforward only in a subtly schematized form, the Van de Velde line which, like a ;\n\nreptilian body, continually changes direction as\n\nits\n\nactivities\n\nmay\n\nrequire but always remains\n\ngraceful.\n\nHe was\n\nand conceived the notion of \"the cube as such,\" as his biographer Karl Ernst Osthaus puts it, \"whose corners can be rounded and modeled at will.\" Not a cube, therefore, with the sharp edges favored by Hoffmann, but a mass firmly anchored to the ground by means of occasional sculptural additions. Hohenhof, the house built by Van de Velde for Osthaus near Hagen in 1907, is the earliest expression of these ideas; they were to remain characteristic of his art until 19 14. From 1 9 10 to 1940 Van de Velde kept on designing with unabated ardor railway cars, yachts, the Krôller-Mùller Museum in Otterlo, Holland He was over ninety when he died. He invented the Belgian style which Goncourt defined in a phrase which caught on prodigiously, the \"Yachting Style.\" Nevertheless, Van de Velde wrote: \"I assert that I have discovered nothing; unless you call someone a discoverer for merely having realized that to be a man of sense is enough to distinguish him from humanity at large.\" By combining beauty with comfort and serviceability, Van de Velde successfully created a new aesthetic; today we call it \"funcfascinated\n\nby the\n\npotentialities of rectangular relationships\n\n—\n\ntional.\"\n\nHorta and Van de Velde were the masters of Belgian architectural Art Nouveau. They quite overshadow their contemporaries. It would nevertheless be unjust to overlook such men as Paul Hankar, Adolphe Crespin, and A. Waesbergue. Hankar, who designed houses in the Rue Defacqz (plate 61) and the Rue Ruysbroeck, as well as the astonishing grill-room of the Grand Hôtel de Bruxelles, followed Horta's example in preaching the virtues of a style adapted to utilitarian needs. People used to say of his house in the Rue Defacqz, with a disapproving shake of the head: \"Just the sort of house an artist would have!\" Brussels also fell under the influence of the English and Scottish architects. Between 1895 and 9 a number of charming houses were built on the same general lines as Voysey's; hence the 10 1 tall, narrow windows, which conflict with the medieval traditions so lovingly cherished in the Belgian capital.\n\nDENMARK Danish architecture, which had been sensitive for many years to the .ancient Teutonic and Viking sagas, yielded to the attractions of Art Nouveau from about 1895. It would seem as if Martin Nyrop felt obliged to transplant the new doctrines under conservative wrappings. For the façade of his imposing Copenhagen Raadhus, or town hall (plate\n\nARCHITECTURE\n\n31\n\n65), he used traditional red brick, heightened with granite to the imagination of his decorators (plate 64)\n\n.\n\nThe\n\nand white\n\nstone, but he left the interior\n\ncapitals of the burgomasters' staircase are\n\ncarved with animal details reminiscent of those in the Nancy-School glassware designed by Walter. The floral ornamentation of both the staircase and the loggia of the great hall, the sculptures by Niels Hansen which represent craftsmen building the Raadhus, the extremely\n\nmedieval dress, and the tiles by Hermann Koehler transform this public building into an Art Nouveau complex. The world's opportunity to discover Danish Art Nouveau came with the Universal Exhibition of 1900 in Paris. In such details as the very modern entrance by Bindesboell, and the agriculture and food pavilions by K. Arm Petersen, the influences of Hoffmann and the Sezession are to be seen. The progress achieved can be gauged by comparing these with the Danish pavilion, in which the architect Koch failed to free himself from the chains of folk art and the Viking tradition. stylized botanical decoration of the doors, containing various characters in\n\nFINLAND As soon\n\nas the Finnish pavilion,\n\nby Herman\n\nGesellius,\n\nArmas Lindgren, and\n\nEliel Saarinen,\n\nwas\n\nerected in Paris at the Universal Exhibition of 1900 (plate 66), a chorus of exclamations arose\n\nfrom the\n\nvisitors,\n\nand astonishment soon turned\n\n—\n\ninto admiration.\n\nWhat\n\nthey saw was an en-\n\ndreamlike building contrasting gables, vaulted doorways, roofs bearing small spires, and a swelling campanile this building might have illustrated a dream of Albert Robida, the highly imaginative French painter and poster designer, had he been a Finn or a Slav. Such a gesture from Finland -a country which had been subjected for a good half-century was in line with to the Imperial Teutonic style first imported about 1830 by the German, Engel the desire for national independence. Two men were to contribute to the awakening of patriotic feelings; the painter Akseli Gallén-Kallela, who illustrated the old epic legends of the Kalevala, and the writer and designer Louis Sparre who, after travel and research in Karelia, was able to prove the existence of an ancient, national, Karelian style. Anyone who looks at those massive, archaic churches and castles and their heavy pillars roughly trimmed tree trunks or granite columns, ornamented with mysterious geometrical signs will at once be aware of the sources drawn upon by the Finnish architects who built the Northern Bank (plate 67) and the Pohjola building (plate 68). These monumental buildings, at once Cyclopean and functional, which contain sumptuous offices and whose interior decoration frequently bears traces of the Sezession, are the beginnings of the remarkable, lively, and youthful Finnish art of our own time. thralling,\n\n;\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\nARCHITECTURE\n\n32\n\ni\n\nm A.
