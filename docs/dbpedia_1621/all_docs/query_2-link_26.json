Their agenda and means are modern, ever-changing, and aided by\n\ntechnological progress. It is the agenda that determines the shapes; hence technology is also\n\npart of it: sometimes they are limited by its imperfections, sometimes it develops them by way\n\nof its resources, and sometimes they form themselves. Weaving was initially invented because\n\nof the need to clothe the body. Its development has been crucial to that of textile arts. Today,\n\nmarket competition has created the need for advertising: the poster is a resulting development\n\nand the chromolithograph turned it into an art form. Railways could not have existed without\n\nthe progress of metallurgy, which in turn paved the way for a new style of architecture.\n\nThere is a clear parallel between human needs and the technology that caters to them. Art\n\nis no different. The shapes it creates are determined by those needs and new technologies;\n\nhence, they can only be modern. The more logical they are, the more likely they are to be\n\nbeautiful. If art wants to assume eccentric shapes for no reason, it will be nothing more\n\nthan a fad because there is no meaning behind it. Sources of inspiration alone do not\n\nconstitute modernism. However numerous they are, there is not an inexhaustive supply of\n\nthem: it is not the first time that artists have dared to use geometry, nor is it the first time\n\nthat they have drawn inspiration from the vegetable kingdom. Roman goldsmiths, sculptors\n\nfrom the reign of Louis XIV, and Japanese embroiderers all perhaps reproduced the flower\n\nmotif more accurately than in 1900. Some âmodernâ pottery works are similar to the\n\nprimitive works of the Chinese or the Greeks. Perhaps it is not paradoxical to claim that the\n\nnew forms of decoration are only ancient forms long gone from our collective memory.\n\nAn overactive imagination, an over-use of complicated curves, and excessive use of the\n\nvegetable motif â these have been, over the centuries, the criticisms ascribed to the\n\nfantasies of their predecessors by restorers of straight lines, lines that EugÃ¨ne Delacroix\n\nqualified as monstrous to his romantic vision. Whatâs more, in the same way that there has\n\nalways been a right wing and a left wing in every political spectrum, ancient and modern\n\nartists (in age and artistic tendencies) have always existed side-by-side. Their squabbles\n\nseem so much more futile, as with a little hindsight, we can see the similarities in the\n\nthemes of their creations, which define their styles.\n\nThe style of an era is marked on all works that are attributed to it, and an artistâs individualism\n\ndoes not exempt his works from it. It would be excessive to say that art must be limited to\n\ncurrent visions in order to be modern. It is, however, also true that the representation of\n\ncontemporary customs and fashion was, at all times, one of the elements of modernism. The\n\nstyle of a Corinthian crater comes from its shape, a thin-walled pottery vessel inspired by the\n\ncustom of mixing water and wine before serving them. But its style also results from its\n\ndecoration: the scenes painted on it depicted contemporary life or mythological scenes.\n\nThose who think that the Jacquard loom, the lace-making machine, the great\n\nmetalworking industry, and gas lighting all date from the beginning of the 19th century,\n\nIntroduction\n\nP:08\n\n8\n\nwould be interested to learn that they were not pioneering technologies; they were only used\n\nto copy ancient silks, needle-points, or spindle laces to create imitation stone walls and light\n\nporcelain candles. Hence, it is necessary to admire those who dared to use cast and rolled iron\n\nin construction. They were the first to revive the tradition of modernism in architecture;\n\nthey are the true descendants of French cathedral builders. Therefore, Antoine-RÃ©my\n\nPolonceau, Henri Labrouste, and Gustave Eiffel are perhaps the fathers of the 19th-century\n\nRenaissance, rather than the charming decorators who, following John Ruskin, tried to break\n\nwith the pastiche and create, first and foremost, a new style using nature as a starting point.\n\nThe vision of nature, literally paraphrased and translated in the works of Ãmile GallÃ©, was not\n\ncompatible with the demands of the design and the material. âA marrow,â wrote Robert de\n\nSizeranne, âcan become a library; a thistle, an office; a water lily, a ballroom. A sideboard is a\n\nsynthesis; a curtain tassle, an analysis; a pair of tweezers, a symbol.â The research of\n\nsomething new borrowed from the poetry of nature, in breaking voluntarily with the laws of\n\nconstruction and past traditions, must have offended both common sense and good taste. To\n\ntranspose nature into its fantasies rather than studying its laws was a mistake as grave as\n\nimitating past styles without trying to understand what they applied to. This was just the\n\nfashion of the time, but being fashionable does not constitute modernism.\n\nReviving tradition in all its logic, but finding a new expression in the purpose of the objects\n\nand in the technical means to achieve them, which is neither in contradiction nor an imitation\n\nJean Fouquet,\n\nPendant, c. 1930.\n\nWhite gold, yellow gold and citrine,\n\n8 x 7 cm.

This ideal was subject to a new influence: science. How could it be that artists would\n\nremain oblivious to the latent, familiar, and universal presence of this neo-mechanisation, this\n\nvehicle for exchanges between men: steamers, engines, and planes, which ensure the domination\n\nof the continents and the seas, antennas and receivers which capture the human voice across\n\nthe surface of the globe, cables which mark out roads awakened to a new life, visions of the\n\nwhole world projected at high speed on cinema screens? Machines have renewed all forms of\n\nwork: forests of cylinders, networks of drains, regular movements of engines. How could all\n\nthis confused boiling of universal life not affect the brains of the decorators?\n\nExhibition programme\n\nThus, from all sides, it was an era metamorphosed by scientific progress and economic\n\nevolution, turned upside down politically and socially by the war, liberated from both\n\nanachronistic pastiche and illogical imaginings. Whilst the artistâs invention reclaimed its\n\nrightful place, machines, no longer a factor in intellectual decline through its making or\n\ndistributing of counterfeit copies of beautiful materials, would permeate aesthetically\n\noriginal and rational creations everywhere. This world movement, however, was lacking the\n\nP:12\n\n12\n\neffective support and clear understanding of the public. Only these accolades would merit an\n\nexhibition. But rather than a bazaar intended to show the power of the respective production\n\nof the nations, it would have to be a presentation of excellence turned towards the future.\n\nWhen the Exposition internationale des Arts dÃ©coratifs et industriels modernes, or International\n\nExhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts â originally planned for 1916, but\n\nadjourned because of the war â was re-envisaged in 1919 by public authorities, modifications\n\nwere imperative. The 1911 classification project contains only three groups: architecture,\n\nfurniture, and finery. The arts of the theatre, of the streets, and the gardens, which were\n\nspecial sections, naturally required a new group. In its title, the new project also comprised\n\na significant addition. The Exhibition was to be devoted to decorative and âindustrialâ arts;\n\nit would affirm the willingness of a close co-operation between aesthetic creation and its\n\ndistribution through the powerful means of industry. Besides the manufacturers, the material\n\nsuppliers were also to be given a large space, thanks to the design which inspired the\n\npresentations of 1925. âModernâ decorative art was to be presented in its entirety like an\n\nexisting reality, completely suited to contemporary aesthetic and material needs. Ceramic\n\ntiles, hanging fabric wall coverings, and wallpaper â each has their reason for adorning\n\nparticular spaces. The ideal mode of presentation was thus the meeting of a certain number\n\nof âmodernâ buildings, decorated entirely inside and out, which would be placed next to\n\nstores, post offices, and school rooms, constituting a kind of miniature city or village.\n\nMoreover, these designs had to inspire the materials they had to work with, adopted for\n\nthe use of the location granted and the distribution of the works which were thoughtfully\n\nplaced in their midst. That is how four principal modes of presentation were determined:\n\nin isolated pavilions, in shops, in galleries of the Esplanade des Invalides, and in the halls\n\nof the Grand Palais. The isolated pavilions, reserved for associations of artists, craftsmen,\n\nand manufacturers had to represent village and countryside homes, hotel businesses,\n\nschools, and even churches and town halls. In short, all the framework of contemporary\n\nlife could be found here. Shops marked the importance attached to urban art and offered\n\nthe possibility of presenting window-dressings, as well as displays, spanning one or more\n\nunits. The galleries, particularly for architecture and furniture, allowed compositions\n\nconnected to the Court of Trades, which were managed by the theatre and the library.\n\nThey were meant to constitute the largest part of the Exhibition. At last, the interior\n\ninstallations of the Grand Palais were systematically categorised.\n\nThe Exhibition aroused new activity long in advance, as a consequence of the emulation\n\nit caused among artists and manufacturers. The creatorâs efforts were significantly\n\nencouraged by groups of âmodernâ minds, which grew in number and made engaging and\n\neffective propaganda. Foreign exhibitors attach no less importance than the hosts to an\n\nopportunity that would allow most countries to compare their efforts and enrich their\n\ndesigns. Thus, the frame of mind of the exhibition was not a centralising narrowmindedness, a formal modernism of the time. Far from imposing rigid and concrete\n\nspecifications of style, the Exhibition of 1925 became apparent as an overview intended\n\nto reveal the tendencies in contemporary art, and to showcase their first achievements. The\n\nonly stipulation was for it to be an âoriginal productionâ, appropriate to the needs, universal\n\nor local, of the time. This phrase could be used to refer to any previous century, which may\n\nhave only been said to be great because it was thought to be innovatory.\n\nDonald Deskey,\n\nFolding screen, c. 1930.\n\nWood, fabric, painted and\n\nmetal decoration.\n\nMuseum of Fine Arts, Boston.\n\nP:13\n\n13\n\nP:15\n\n15\n\nEdgar Brandt,\n\nOasis, folding screen (detail), c. 1924.\n\nIron and copper.\n\nPrivate collection, Paris.\n\nWilliam van Alen,\n\nChrysler Building, entrance hall,\n\n1927-1930. New York. (pp. 16-17)\n\nAll exhibitions comprised of new construction greatly credited the efforts of the\n\narchitects: well-adapted to the requirements for its brief, more or less accessible\n\nand expressive, and leaving visitors with a sincere and lasting first impression.\n\nEven more so, in an exhibition devoted to decorative and industrial modern arts,\n\narchitecture required the most attentive care and excited great interest. Indeed, the most\n\nutilitarian of all arts is also the most âdecorativeâ and the most closely related to\n\nindustrial progress.\n\nDecorative art is as such based on the great number of its creations. Large silhouettes\n\nof buildings are more important in the scenery of life than all other objects with which\n\nwe can adorn it. Sculpture and painting can only add a little to the beauty of their\n\nalready thick volumes, and will not be able to enrich their legacy, should they not have\n\ntheir own intrinsic nobility. As for the alliance of art with industry, architects did not\n\nwait to conclude it, the eloquent manifestos which, for almost a century, have proclaimed\n\nthe need of it. Continuously in search of new materials, effective and economic\n\nconstruction processes, they benefit from the discoveries of science and sometimes even\n\ncause them. Lastly, having to create a framework where everything that further\n\nembellishes the pavilion finds its place and makes sense, architecture coordinates the\n\nefforts of the other arts. It should, therefore, be a source of inspiration. However, it\n\nultimately becomes a slave to the whole, a mere shell from which a unity of expression\n\nmust originate in order to create the style of its time or, more simply, the harmony of\n\nthe pavilion itself.\n\nâModernâ architecture: new materials, new shapes\n\nIf we understand by âmodernâ architecture that which profits from the successes of\n\nindustry, by using the new materials and methods of construction of the time, in order\n\nto carry out their new programmes, then the Exhibition of 1900 truly marked the\n\ndecline of âmodernismâ. In France, the 19th century, in spite of its taste for formulas\n\nborrowed from previous eras, was marked by strong and original works. Progress in\n\nmetallurgy, a consequence of the development of public transport infrastructure, had\n\ndrawn attention to the varied possibilities and real beauty of iron. From Henri\n\nLabrouste to Victor Baltard, and Paul SÃ©dille to Ãmile AndrÃ©, architects used it\n\nunreservedly for the construction of public libraries, market halls, stations, department\n\nstores, and museums. With the Eiffel Tower, the Machine Gallery, and the palaces of\n\nJean-Camille FormigÃ©, the Exhibition of 1889 dedicated a lengthy and persevering\n\neffort to the cause. Nevertheless, eleven years later, despite a few exceptions, the\n\nretrograde tendencies dominated.\n\nArchitecture,\n\nPainted and Sculpted Decor\n\nP:16\n\n16\n\nP:17\n\n17\n\nP:18\n\n18\n\nIs it necessary to recall to which point the multiple implementations of science, steam,\n\nhydraulic force, electricity, and the reciprocating engine modified the conditions of life?\n\nMust we discuss the progress of transport systems, the development of industrial and\n\ncommercial enterprises, the evolution of social ideas, or how health concerns altered the\n\nway everything was viewed? By observing these causes one by one, we would find the\n\norigin of buildings whose modest beginnings aroused the admiration of previous\n\ngenerations and which were, in comparison, quite varied from the boldest expectations of\n\na hundred years ago: stations, hotels, factories, department stores, housing estates, schools,\n\npublic swimming pools â so many projects which, despite the many years of stagnation\n\ndue to war, stimulated the imagination of architects in every country.\n\nThe layout, structure, and faÃ§ade of antique houses had changed; there is nothing better\n\nthan a house to reveal the customs of a country and a time period. A typical house of the\n\n1920s has various floors, distributed between tenants or landlords, of the space. The\n\ninterior distribution most clearly reflected everyoneâs new needs. Using thicker walls, the\n\narchitect was able to provide a whole system of ducts and piping for smoke, water, gas,\n\nelectricity, and steam, a vacuum system to ensure that the ârented boxâ became, according\n\na very visual word, a âdwelling machineâ. In the early 20th century, in all the relatively\n\nopulent buildings, the narrow old vestibule evolved into a spacious gallery, an example first\n\nexhibited by Charles Garnier. Toilets and bathrooms got bigger, often at the expense of\n\nthe bedroom or the nearly obsolete living room. The dining-room and living rooms cohabit, separated by a half-wall, though still considered to be only one room. Where\n\nnecessary, the number of rooms would be reduced in order to obtain, on an equal surface,\n\nsome larger areas with better ventilation. Bold theorist of new architecture, CharlesÃdouard Jeanneret, better known as Le Corbusier, offers the following advice in his Manual\n\nof the Dwelling:\n\nDemand that the bathroom, fully sunlit, be one of the largest rooms in the\n\napartment, the old living room for example. With full-length windows,\n\nopening, if possible, onto a terrace for sunbathing, a porcelain washbasin, a\n\nbath-tub, showers, and gym equipment. In the adjacent room: a walk-in\n\nwardrobe for dressing and undressing. Do not undress in your bedroom. It is\n\nnot very clean and it creates a distressing disorder. Demand one big room in\n\nplace of all the living rooms. If you can, put the kitchen under the roof, to\n\navoid odours. Demand a garage for cars, bicycles, and motorbikes from your\n\nowner, one per apartment. Ask for the servantsâ quarters to be on the same\n\nfloor. Do not pen your servants in under the roofs.\n\nOne should note that the writer of this catechism would prefer bare walls and replaces\n\nthe cumbersome pieces of furniture commonly exposed to dust with wall cupboards or\n\nbuilt-in closets. Our need for outside air and light translates in the number, shape, and\n\ndimension of bay windows, using bow- and oriel windows which increase brightness,\n\navailable surface area, and also allow for enfilade views, such as those seen from old\n\nwatch towers. Fake decorated plating on giant pilasters are no longer of fashion,\n\ninstead, a careful study of the interior distribution of space and the height of the\n\nceilings, so as more modern architects can seek to unite the entire construction and give\n\nlife to its faÃ§ade. As early as 1912, Henri Sauvage found another very original solution:\n\nHeinsbergen Decorating Company,\n\nTwo designs for decorative panels for\n\nthe Pantages Theater, c. 1929.\n\nWatercolour on paper.\n\nUpper part of the border above the\n\nfireproof curtain of the apron.\n\nPantages Theater, Los Angeles.\n\nHeinsbergen Decorating Company,\n\nProject for the ceiling of the Pantages\n\nTheater, c. 1929.\n\nWatercolour on paper.\n\nP:19\n\n19\n\nP:20\n\n20\n\nP:21\n\n21\n\nAnton Skislewicz,\n\nPlymouth Hotel, 1940.\n\nMiami Beach.\n\na tiered house in which no floor deprives the lower floors of air or light, where each\n\ninhabitant is at home, on his terrace which may be full of shrubs and flowers.\n\nIndividual homes of cheaper construction are better suited for new experiments than\n\nlarge constructions built for rental purposes. At this time, one could easily have believed\n\nthat because of the high price of building sites in the cities and because of the housingshortage crisis, private mansions, enclosed between houses that rise to any height, would\n\ngradually disappear. But the periphery, or the suburbs, of large cities, remains an option;\n\ncars brought inhabitants closer to the centre. The housing shortage, a consequence of the\n\ninterruption of construction caused by the war, and the temporary uncertainty of the\n\nvalue of money determined the revival and even proliferation around major urban\n\ncentres; apart from the private mansion, the word would often be considered pretentious,\n\nat least referring to the small, family house. Here, a few young architects, such as Robert\n\nMallet-Stevens, AndrÃ© LurÃ§at, Jean-Charles Moreux, and Henri Pacon, applied, with an\n\nintransigence which often does not exclude taste, their principles of rational distribution\n\nand construction. Thanks to bay windows that span the length of a room, obscure angles\n\nare avoided. Although they banished all decoration, they were concerned about practical\n\ndetails which were carefully studied: interior blinds, sliding doors and windows, saving\n\nspace by not having to install cumbersome shutters. Uncluttered rooms, for them, meant\n\nsupreme elegance.\n\nTo carry out these various projects, from large factories to small houses, the architect takes\n\nadvantage of the industryâs achievements. Materials are provided to him cheaply due to\n\nmore time efficient working methods. The invaluable invention of plywood, which â unlike\n\nnatural wood â does not warp over large areas, offered new facilities for the execution of\n\npanelling and doors. Rolled steel, the newest innovation to come out of factories, was more\n\nlightweight and resistant than its predecessors; they are invaluable to the halls of\n\ndepartment stores and openwork faÃ§ades of commercial buildings. They are also used in\n\nhouses for window joinery; metal allows more light to stream through than wood.\n\nHowever, iron has well-known defects. For example, it oxidises if it is not protected by a\n\ncoating and it requires constant monitoring, which can be expensive to maintain. One\n\nwould agree with Auguste Perret when he said: âIf man were to suddenly disappear, the\n\nsteel and iron buildings would not be long in following them.â\n\nFortuitously invented in 1849 by Joseph Monnier, a gardener of Boulogne, improved by\n\nthe research of Joseph-Louis Lambot, cement or reinforced concrete consists of a mixture\n\nof cement, sand, and stones coating a steel reinforcement. The stones then act as a part of\n\nthe inert material, like grease-remover mixed with earth in large ceramic containers. The\n\nrelationship between the ratio of steel expansion and cement allows the concrete to\n\nlengthen while following the deformations of metal without falling apart, so that, in\n\nessence, the reinforced concrete behaves like a single entity. Reinforced concrete is wellsuited for finer work. Cement hardens quickly, but it is breakable, making it better to use\n\nfor posts and beams rather than hollow blocks because the works can be altered after a\n\nfew days. The speed of its creation is comparable in speed to the assembly of iron\n\nframes which were prepared in advance with expensive machinery. Concrete made with\n\nclinker is less resistant to the pickaxe than granular cement and, hence, invaluable to\n\ntemporary buildings. Used for roofs, floors, and partitions due to its light weight,\n\nP:22\n\n22\n\nit protects against heat and cold and often decreases the excessive resonance which comes\n\nwith reinforced concrete constructions. The strengthened stone is a mixture of many\n\nmaterials, which makes it suitable for faÃ§ade renovation. Whatever its varieties, this\n\nresistant material allows the fast construction of a structure in which the use of other\n\nmaterials might make the project more difficult and ultimately destroy it. A work thus built\n\nis an artificial monolith. It has justly been compared to the concrete buildings of Rome and\n\nByzantium, where tensile brick framework played a role analogous to iron and concrete.\n\nThe consequences of this discovery, from the point of view of construction, can well be\n\nseen: extraordinarily long lintels, long-ranging, continuous arcs made from a single piece,\n\nand strong and slender posts. The obstruction of the fulcrums is kept to a minimum much\n\nmore easily than in Gothic constructions. Whilst the intersecting ribs required buttresses\n\nand flying buttresses to balance it out, the monolithic framework in reinforced concrete\n\nholds without external stays. The walls which do not support any weight but are mere\n\npartition walls, can be removed on the whim of the architect. He can replace a solid wall\n\nwith a double wall to lock in an insulating air pocket. Engineers were the first to\n\nunderstand the part reinforced concrete could play in architecture. Anatole de Baudot, who\n\nhad already preached its virtues through his teachings, employed it at the end of the 19th\n\ncentury at the LycÃ©e Lakanal and the Church of Saint-Jean-de-Montmartre. He was only\n\nin the wrong to abuse narrow curves, whereas his technique was particularly suitable for\n\nrectilinear forms. Immediately after him, Charles GÃ©nuys gave reinforced concrete an\n\nincreasingly important standing, in 1892 and 1898, in the factories of ArmentiÃ¨res and\n\nBoulogne-on-Seine, in 1907, in a private mansion in Auteuil, and afterwards in his\n\nconstructions for the national railway. Louis Bonnier, who implemented it in 1911 for the\n\nlintels, floors, and staircases of the school complex of the rue de Grenelle, reserving\n\nbrickwork for the faÃ§ades, made use of it on a large scale in 1922 and 1923 in the great\n\nnave of the swimming pool built at Butte-aux-Cailles. At the same time, Charles Plumet\n\nmade the judicious choice to use it for the new metro stations. Tony Garnier who, already\n\ndreaming of reinforced concrete in the shade of the Villa Medici, was able to construct\n\nsome of his grandest designs out of this material, as part of the major works of the town\n\nof Lyon. The terraces of the LycÃ©e Jules Ferry, designed by Pacquet, are made of\n\nreinforced concrete, as are the arcs of the departure hall of Biarritz railway station by\n\nDervaux, the cupola of the Boucherie Economique by Alfred Agache, the large roofs of\n\nthe Galleries Lafayette by Chanut, and the pillars and the vaults of the Church of SaintDominique by Gaudibert. Savage used it for the framework of his house with tiered steps\n\nfrom the rue de Vavin and in a building on the Boulevard Raspail; Boileau, in the two\n\nbasements of new the appendix of Le Bon MarchÃ©; Danis, in the framework and the\n\nstaircase of the Pasteur museum in Strasbourg; Bonnemaison, in his rental properties. In\n\nthe Church of Saint-Louis in Vincennes, Droz and Marrast combined it with grinding\n\nstone and brick. Inside the Church of Saint-Leon in Paris, Leon Brunet adorned it with\n\nbeautifully laid out bricks. At the very moment when the Exhibition opened, Deneux\n\nstarted to produce the amazing framework of Rheims Cathedral consisting of 17,800\n\nelements moulded on-site, then assembled, put up, and fitted together without the help of\n\nbolts or metal parts.\n\nAs for the works of Auguste and Gustave Perret â the house of the rue Franklin (1902),\n\nthe garage of the rue de Ponthieu (1905), the ThÃ©Ã¢tre des Champs-ÃlysÃ©es (1911-1913),\n\nP:23\n\n23\n\nClaude Beelman,\n\nEastern Columbia Building, 1930.\n\nClad in glazed turquoise terracotta\n\ntiles and copper panels. Los Angeles.\n\nthe Church of Notre-Dame du Raincy, the Sainte Chapelle made of reinforced concrete\n\n(1922-1923), the tower of the Exhibition of Grenoble (1925) â all of these were built after\n\nconsidering the behaviour of this new material. As Paul Jamot wrote, these buildings attest\n\nâthat a building which is governed solely by the systematic use of reinforced concrete, with the\n\ngreatest possible savings of material and labour, [can] be beautiful in itself and, in spite of the\n\nabsence of any superfluous ornament, be a work of artâ. Which forms are thus born most\n\nnaturally from reinforced concrete? Simple and large ones. As it lends itself to ample vaults, it\n\nespecially restores to honour the horizontal line. The section of pillars gives it an austere\n\nelegance. Bases are no longer necessary as the column sticks straight out of the ground. No\n\nmore capitals, as the beam and column are made from the same material. The capital, useful in\n\nthe construction of foundations in order to distribute the weight of the architrave or the lintel\n\namongst the supporting columns, became superfluous in a monolithic system. On the faÃ§ades,\n\nno more horizontal projections except those of some rectangular canopies and sometimes, in\n\norder to finish the wall, the hem of a narrow frieze to underlines a distinct shadow.\n\nP:24\n\n24\n\nThe walls are nothing but large empty surfaces. However, the reinforced concrete is\n\nwell-suited for coatings. The marble panels can be fixed more firmly to it than to brick. It\n\nadmits encrusted stoneware tiles, mosaics which are composed in advance at the base of\n\nthe wall, stuck together with cement, the reliefs taking shape in the moulds. It offers a vast\n\nfield of possibilities for the fresco. But it is by its sparse appearance, its blunt edges, by the\n\nharmony of the large areas exposed, or those hidden from the light that its most fervent\n\nsupporters intend to stir our emotions. At most it is polished, in order to soften the\n\nroughness of it, or the colour is varied by ochre, grey, blue, pink, or green plastering,\n\nwhich seems to be a part of it. Reinforced concrete, a combination of materials, was\n\nalready widely used in many countries across the globe. The Exhibition comprised, in the\n\nforeign as well as in the French section, a presentation of models, drawings and\n\nphotographs of recently built works or works in the process of being built; however, its\n\ndisplay was limited. The buildings erected for the Exhibition itself account for the greater\n\npart of Class I. To what extent does this architectural framework, where decorative arts\n\nrepresented real life as closely as possible, reflect contemporary architecture? There was\n\nno revelation comparable with those built for the Exposition Universelle of 1889, works like\n\nthe Eiffel Tower and the Gallerie des Machines (Machinery Hall). However, there were many\n\nexamples of intelligence, knowledge, ingenuity, talent, a serious understanding of the art\n\nof building, a deep sensitivity, and a sober taste, which revealed a progression of trends\n\nover the previous twenty or twenty-five years. To judge these buildings equitably, it is\n\ninitially necessary to take into account the conditions imposed.\n\nA house of more than one storey does not lend itself easily to the flow of the crowd. A\n\npavilion anticipates it: hence a certain width of doors and passages, and an increased number\n\nof buildings (without ceasing to be accessible), yet keeping some of the mystery through\n\npricking curiosity as to what lay behind the closed faÃ§ades. Others, such as the houses of the\n\nformer Soviet Union, and the factories of Copenhagen, Limoges, the Grand Maison de Blanc\n\ndepartment store, and the Diamanteries, attracted the public with their outside windows,\n\nPierre Patout,\n\nHÃ´tel dâun Collectionneur,\n\nat the 1925 Paris Exhibition,\n\nwith its frieze La Danse, by Joseph\n\nBernard, above the porch.\n\nPanoramic view of the 1925\n\nParis Exhibition,\n\nphotograph taken facing the\n\nAlexandre III bridge, 1925.\n\nPostcard. Private collection.\n\nP:25\n\n25\n\nP:26\n\n26\n\nP:27\n\n27\n\nRobert Mallet-Stevens,\n\nTourist information pavilion at the\n\n1925 Paris Exhibition.\n\nInk and watercolour on paper.\n\nMusÃ©e des Arts dÃ©coratifs, Paris.\n\nsimilar to shop window-displays. Lastly, others presented various compromises between\n\nthese two extremes. Particular constraints, such as limiting the architectsâ freedom, put\n\ntheir talent to the test. At the entrance of the Esplanade des Invalides, an underground\n\nstation prohibited the digging of the ground deep below the surface. It is important to\n\nnote that the architect Pierre Patout managed to balance the pylons of the monumental\n\nPorte de la Concorde without the help of foundations, whereas Boileau and Sauvage had to\n\ndistribute the weight of both of the pavilions of Le Bon MarchÃ© and Le Printemps on four\n\nof the cast iron columns of the station of Les Invalides.\n\nVarious metals were implemented. The woodwork apparent on the Japanese pavilion\n\ncontributed to its particular appearance, as with the elegant windows of the pavilion of\n\nthe Manufacturers of Copenhagen, built with wooden planks, rafters, pine battens, and the\n\nSabot â or clog â makerâs house, a work by Gabriel Guillemonat. Brickwork characterised\n\nthe typical houses of the north-eastern French towns of Roubaix and Tourcoing, along\n\nwith those of Denmark and the Netherlands, and lastly those of Italy â to which the brick\n\nowed its blond colour. Stonework was represented, with infinite artistic talent, by the\n\nmodel that the School of the Paris employersâ federation of building, cement, and\n\nreinforced concrete contractors had carried out and displayed in the âteachingâ group,\n\naccording to the drawings of Pierre Paquet. This model of a pavilion, dedicated to rest in\n\na sea of leisure, was so well studied and carried out stone by stone to such perfection, that\n\nit was worth building to scale. In the library, a clad iron ceiling shed a generous light on\n\nthe books. In the domed vestibule of the pavilion of Nancy, the architects had achieved a\n\ndecorative effect from the steel elements and connecting rivets. On the lintels of the\n\ncovered walkway of the Esplanade des Invalides, Charles Plumet left the iron beams\n\nexposed, acting as both a structural component and decoration. Plaster naturally played a\n\ngreat part. Maurice DufrÃªne deserves credit for acknowledging this material frankly in the\n\nshops of the Alexandre III Bridge. In the construction of the ThÃ©Ã¢tre des ChampsÃlysÃ©es, Auguste Perret was clearly biased in favour of temporary materials: timber posts\n\nsupporting a reinforced concrete frame, with a timber frame on the inside, and coated with\n\nthick plaster.\n\nOn the whole, reinforced concrete dominated the event. Entire constructions, such as the\n\ntourist information pavilion or the rest stop pavilion for automobile drivers owed their\n\nlines to it. Others borrowed their entire framework from it, like, for example, the pavilion\n\nof the Netherlands whose unexpected lighting would have been impossible to realise\n\nwithout its contribution. Elsewhere, architects had been content with imitations of\n\nprecarious material, forgetting that reinforced concrete is not necessarily blocky and can\n\nassume, on the contrary, a certain elegance. Even if the Exhibition did not help the new\n\nconcept of construction progress on a technical level, the date is marked in the history of\n\nits diffusion. It accustomed the eyes to its bold spans, its simple shapes, and its large\n\ncantilever overhangs. It established its recognition.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, there were many attacks against the decorative\n\narts. At the dawn of the last century, architects and decorators took liberties with\n\ndecorative fantasy. They claimed to have based their style on the visual development of\n\nthemes borrowed from flora or on the use of sinuous lines which they imposed on pieces\n\nof furniture as well as on houses, stone, wood, and metal. A backlash was inevitable.\n\nP:28\n\n28\n\nAs people had grown accustomed to the bare beauty of machines, the reaction had the\n\ncharacter of a puritan reform. A well-known manifesto of the Austrian architect\n\nAdolphe Loos, Ornament and Crime, became the bible for a whole group of young artists.\n\nâThe ornament of an ordinary object,â Loos essentially said, âis, like tattooing, a sign of\n\ncruelty or degeneration. It is a criminal waste of time, money, and energy.â Loos\n\nforetells of a civilisation where âthe streets of the cities will shine out like large, very\n\nwhite wallsâ.\n\nIn general, the architects estimated that discrete decoration, judiciously placed and carried\n\nout tastefully, would animate and enrich the materials. The beauty of the bare parts must\n\nbe appreciated, as they, themselves, give all their value to the decorated parts. It is,\n\nhowever, necessary that the architect remains the authorising director. The direct\n\nsubmission of the painter, sculptor, and designer to the architect of the piece was one of\n\nthe major features of the 1925 Exhibition. The fashionable decoration at the Exhibition\n\nhas often been described as cubist. In truth, in 1925, authentic cubes or at least simple\n\nshapes, with flat surfaces were seen: those of reinforced concrete constructions and\n\nplywood pieces of furniture. But they did not owe Braque or Picasso anything. In order to\n\nunderstand the beauty of the bare masses, architects and cabinet-makers had not awaited\n\nthe revelation of which some amateur critics had been the noisy heralds.\n\nCubism was hardly represented at the Exhibition, at least not in the paintings\n\ndecorating the architectural compositions, except for two works placed in the hall of the\n\nembassy. One, a work of Fernand LÃ©ger, juxtaposed geometrical surfaces illuminated by\n\npure colours spread out flat. The other, shimmering with colour, was entitled La Ville de\n\nParis, or the City of Paris. Robert Delaunay had painted the Eiffel Tower and a lady,\n\nLouis-Hippolyte Boileau,\n\nPomone pavilion for Bon MarchÃ© at\n\nthe 1925 Paris Exhibition.\n\nP:29\n\n29\n\nJoseph Hiriart, Georges Tribout\n\nand Georges Beau,\n\nLa MaÃ®trise pavilion for Galeries\n\nLafayette at the 1925 Paris\n\nExhibition.\n\nbarely clothed, on the Pont de la Concorde. Whatever one might think of the outcome\n\nobtained in painting and sculpture by Picasso, Braque, and their disciples, it is certain\n\nthat their formula contributed to develop the decoratorsâ taste for broken lines and\n\nabstracted decoration, far from living nature. Tired of curves and having exhausted the\n\njoys of a timid naturalism and of the stylisations of flora and fauna, which their\n\nprecursors had abused, the decorators of 1925 took pleasure in a capricious geometry\n\nwhich had nothing to do with science.\n\nThe decoration on the monumental entrances of the place de la Concorde â in the lowreliefs intelligently composed by the Martel brothers for the pylons and the pedestal of\n\nthe statue named LâAccueil, or Reception, â announced the union of art and industry. It\n\ncould be found in the pavilion of Le Bon MarchÃ© (department store), of LâIntransigeant\n\n(daily newspaper), of Christofle (silverware), and Baccarat (crystal ware), and in a great\n\nnumber of kiosks. In response to the sensitivity of a generation who, in art, flee away\n\nfrom details and prefer the essence, this fashion resulting from Cubism remains a simple\n\ndecorative convention. In theory, sculpture was only allowed at the Exhibition as long as\n\nit was a part of an architectural piece, hence the considerable number of low-reliefs.\n\nHowever, without taking into account the fountains, such as those of Max Blondat,\n\nChristofle, Marcel Loyau, and Naoum Aronson, statues and groups decorated the\n\ngardens, or the entrances to the buildings. This broad interpretation of the regulations\n\nmade it possible to admire, close to the pavilion of the General Commissioner, a nude\n\nfigure of a sovereign eurhythmy by Despiau, calm without being inert and, in addition,\n\nin an alcove of the Bernheim Jeune pavilion, a splendidly full-figured bronze nude by\n\nMaillot: both variations on an age-old theme, but nevertheless âmodernâ works due to the\n\noriginality of vision.\n\nP:30\n\n30\n\nDespite the subordination of sculptures in the round and low-reliefs to their architectural\n\nunits, the Exhibition offered a rather exact image of the current state of sculpture in\n\nFrance. From sculpture which only stirs emotions through its lively profiles and its\n\nrhythmic outlines, to that which has the ambition to express ideas, and from the most\n\ntraditional to the most paradoxical, every trend has its defenders. In the foreign sections,\n\nsculpture could not be represented in a complete state to qualify it for an overall\n\njudgement. We will focus later, within their respective sections, on capital works such as\n\nthose of Mateo Hernandez of Spain, Henryk Kuna of Poland, Ivar Johnson and Carl\n\nMilles of Sweden, as well as Jean Stursa of the former Czechoslovakia.\n\nIn spite of the theories, sculpture is protected from any dangerous concern, because of the\n\nrequirements of the profession which demands complete clarity of form. With fewer\n\nconstraints, the painter can suggest more than he can express, can be more pleasing with\n\na range of tones, and more charming with promises that may or may not be kept. Whilst\n\nsculpture has remained healthy and robust, painting underwent a significant crisis which\n\nwas revealed by the Exhibition. This explains why the walls of the Court of Trades were\n\nnot offered to the most original champions of young French painting. It is by paintings of\n\nrestricted size exhibited in certain furniture units or in the pavilion Bernheim Jeune that\n\ntheir talent could be judged.\n\nIn the years leading up to the Exhibition, a renaissance of the fresco was witnessed. Paul\n\nBaudouin, disciple and friend of Symbolist painter Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, showed that\n\nfrescos can survive as well under a wet sky as in a dry climate, if the painting materials\n\nare judiciously chosen and if the wall is preserved with saltpetre. The failure of many\n\nattempts made in France, in the first half of the 19th century, is due only to poor technique.\n\nIt is known that painting with fresco, known from the Greeks and the Romans, and with\n\nso many masterpieces produced in Italy and in medieval France, consists of spreading\n\ncolours diluted in water over a fresh plaster of faded lime and fine sand. Fixed on this\n\nmortar they become, whilst drying, as hard as the wall itself. The fresco, which requires\n\nprompt execution, is therefore a school of decision and, consequently, of reflection. The\n\nfresco painter has no time to either hesitate or get bogged down in the meticulousness of\n\ndetails. His composition must be finalised beforehand, then carried out on a large scale. It\n\nis also a school of simplicity, because lime admits only a restricted number of colours.\n\nSince the example of Paul Baudouin, the fresco already produced remarkable works: the\n\nsplendid ensemble by Bourdelle at the ThÃ©Ã¢tre des Champs-ÃlysÃ©es, the compositions of\n\nMarcel Lenoir at the seminar of Toulouse, heavy, systematic, but truly powerful, those of\n\nCaro Delvaille, those of Henry Marret, in particular in the Church of Saint-Louis de\n\nVincennes. It seems that this technique must benefit from the appreciation of large flat\n\nsurfaces, and it must offer reinforced concrete â a material of a rather poor appearance, or\n\nwith asbestos cement (a substrate used by Marret), a suitable decoration for it. It was a\n\nsignificant part of the Exhibition, particularly in the French section.\n\nThe French section\n\nReinforced concrete and its derivatives played such a large part in the Exhibition that a\n\nclassification based on the implemented materials would not ensure a clearer approach.\n\nTiffany & Co,\n\nDesk clock.\n\nSilver, jade, crystal, black onyx, and\n\nenamel, signed, height: 12.7 cm.\n\nP:31\n\n31\n\nP:32\n\n32\n\nJean Dunand,\n\nLacquered panel with gold leaf, 1930.\n\nP:33\n\n33\n\nP:34\n\n34\n\nP:35\n\n35\n\nRapp & Rapp (architects),\n\nThe Paramount Theater,\n\nauditorium, 1931.\n\nAurora, Illinois.\n\nIt would be better to look at the achievements of the various projects, starting with the\n\nsectionâs over plans.\n\nThe French section comprised two main areas, almost perpendicular to each other: one of\n\nthem marked by the Seine between the Pont de la Concorde and the Alma Bridge, the other\n\none, leading alongside the Avenue Nicolas II, the Alexandre III Bridge, and the alley\n\nbisecting the section cutting across the Esplanade des Invalides from north to south. On\n\nthe quays of the right bank of the river and the Cours-la-Reine, the visitor would\n\nsuccessively encounter the foreign and the French pavilions, then the French Village and\n\nthe colonial pavilions. On the left bank, some more pavilions, miniature toys presented in\n\na model village, the transport gallery, and the amusement park. On the Esplanade,\n\nsymmetry and variety, order and life, obtained by an extremely considered arrangement of\n\nbuildings, predominantly assigned to France. Lastly, in order to connect the two parts of\n\nthe Exhibition separated by the Seine and for fear the public would not be tempted to cross\n\nfrom one bank to the other under the summer sun, the Alexandre III Bridge was\n\ntransformed, from two lines of shops into a kind of Rialto. It was, like certain bridges of\n\nthe Middle Ages, a street spanning a river. Dictated by the terrain itself, the general plan\n\nmapped out by Charles Plumet left nothing to be desired in terms of clarity.\n\nThe chief architect had focused his main effort on the Esplanade des Invalides. Two\n\ncontrasting but essential considerations presented themselves: to assure that the splendid\n\nview of the dome was not inhibited, but nevertheless avoid the monotony of a long,\n\nordinary avenue. The available space was divided into two parts of unequal length,\n\nseparated by the two twin pavilions of the SÃ¨vres factory. In the first one, close to the Seine,\n\ntwo galleries masked the entry and the exit of the underground station of Les Invalides.\n\nOne was dedicated to sumptuous boutiques: Henry Sauvage had created there a striking\n\norchestration of black, red, and gold. The other one, reserved for the foreign sections, had\n\nbeen built in a simple and practical way by Leon Gaudibert and Julien Polti and decorated\n\nwith discrete paintings by the decorator Camille Boignard. Between these two galleries,\n\ntwelve buildings of ranging importance formed, bordering a garden, a first unit where,\n\nwedged in the four corners, four pavilions intended for the department stores stood.\n\nThe second unit comprised ten pavilions facing each other in a line along the side of the\n\ncentral walkway. As with the latter, it was fenced in on the right and left sides by galleries.\n\nA covered promenade skirted them, connecting them to four imposing corner towers and\n\ncurved around to end at the entrance hall of the Court of Trades. To avoid a repeat of the\n\ndisorder of previous exhibitions, with an excess and confusion of shadows, the faÃ§ades of\n\nthe pavilions were not to exceed a height restriction of 16 feet. This white herd would\n\nhave been monotonous without some dominant constructions, giving rhythm to the\n\ncomposition. Hence, the towers of Charles Plumet were created, evidently, out of a\n\ndecorative need. By assigning them as restaurants where one could enjoy the products of\n\nfour provinces of France, the architect was not unaware that he was exposing himself to\n\ncriticism for having exalted culinary art in an exhibition dedicated to decorative art in the\n\nmost important buildings in the ensemble. But he remembered the attraction of American\n\nrestaurants located on the upper floors of a skyscraper. What to place in these lookouts, if\n\nnot a place for weary visitors to rest, allowing them to associate the delights of the table\n\nwith the sight of an urban landscape?\n\nP:36\n\n36\n\nOnce this project was adopted, Plumet carried it out with logic. On the ground floor of\n\neach tower, a hall lit by high glass walls was used as a vestibule by the galleries adjacent\n\nto the exhibition. In the four corners, octagonal turrets neatly housed staircases and\n\nelevators. Above the hall, a service floor, then the dining area, enlarged by four projecting\n\nstoreys from where the view stretched out as far as the eye could see. Each of them was\n\nsupported by four impressive columns; between which lead to the kitchens and other\n\nservices. Such an arrangement of supports was a concession to usual visual expectations.\n\nThe whole construction was in clinker concrete, less solid than ballast concrete, which\n\nfacilitated a future demolition. The projecting porches, simply carved, were made of\n\nreinforced stone and plywood, which lends itself to restoration works.\n\nThe Court of Trades was made of the same materials and presented, for a very different\n\nproject, similar qualities: a low construction along the main road of the Esplanade and\n\nthe dome and a refuge for meditation at ground level. The hall, flanked by two porches\n\nwhose turrets mirrored those of the towers, connected at the same level with the covered\n\nwalkway of the Esplanade. However, its linked pillars, without bases but widened at their\n\ntop by a discrete cushion capital and with a deliberate transition between the eight\n\ncolumns and the lintels, indicated a greater search for elegance. Largely open, like that of\n\nthe Grand Trianon, but without a curved courtyard, it owed its character to the harmony\n\nof the proportions and to the simple decoration obtained by the apparent gaps between\n\nbeams and joists, with a clearly exposed firmness of the lines. As for the Court itself, it\n\nwas a more modern cloister without columns or pillars, surrounding a geometrical\n\ngarden with a fountain at its centre. To offer a discrete setting for the paintings and\n\nsculptures, Plumet had simply divided up the awning by the stark, projecting\n\nreinforcements. Three constructions were closely related to the composition designed for\n\nthe Esplanade des Invalides: the library and the theatre which flanked the Court of\n\nTrades symmetrically and the twin pavilions of SÃ¨vres, built across from each other on\n\nthe main road.\n\nThe library, a work of Paul Huillard, could have had the longer, yet more precise name of\n\nâshowroom of the art of the bookâ. Readers were not envisaged there, nor their tables,\n\ntheir seats, the quiet atmosphere conducive to their studies, or the shelves for stacking the\n\nbooks. It was not a typical library. But in its hall with its visible framework and few\n\nsupports, under the light which shone through the broad bay windows at the upper part of\n\nthe walls, printed pages, engravings, and bindings were presented under the most\n\nfavourable conditions. The theatre of the Perret brothers and Granet was precisely\n\nadmired for its elegance at the same time as being ânovel and naturalâ. Architects, such as\n\nPaul Jamot, had proposed to create, in the most simple and most economical way possible,\n\nâa meeting and contact place between drama and the publicâ. As at the ThÃ©Ã¢tre des\n\nChamps-ÃlysÃ©es, the room was arranged in such way that from of every seat, the spectator\n\ncould easily see the whole scene. Built on a square plan, its architecture encroached on the\n\nstage which, divided into three parts by two columns, lent itself to multiple scene layouts.\n\nGreat care had been taken with the lighting. It fell from a glass ceiling, where the light, of\n\nmany different colours, was diffused without visible hearth and could enrich the silver-grey\n\nrendering with the finest gold. A gallery for electricity, to aid the monitoring, removed âthe\n\nmiserable installation of projectors in the middle of the publicâ. Placed directly below the\n\nceiling, all around the room, it constituted at the same time the best kind of decoration â\n\nWirt Rowland, Smith,\n\nHinchman & Grylls Associates\n\nInc. and Thomas di Lorenzo,\n\nGuardian (or Union Trust) Building,\n\nentrance hall, 1929.\n\nBlack Belgian marble\n\nand Numidian red marble,\n\nMankato stone, and Rookwood\n\nceramic tiles. Detroit.\n\nP:38\n\n38\n\nHerman Sachs,\n\nSpirit of Transportation,\n\nceiling of the entrance hall of the\n\nBullocks Wilshire building, 1929.\n\nLos Angeles.\n\nP:39\n\n39\n\nP:40\n\n40\n\nP:41\n\n41\n\none that fulfils a purpose. The same intelligence went into the construction process. For an\n\nephemeral building, Auguste Perret had only implemented expensive and durable\n\nmaterials when they were proven to be warranted. He had taken care not to forget that the\n\nhumble fir tree has the same compressive strength (40 kilograms per square centimetre)\n\nas the hardest concrete. Thirty-four wooden posts, transformed by a coating onto grooved\n\ncolumns, supported a reinforced concrete frame. The ceiling rested on steel beams. The\n\narchitect had laid out his posts in pairs: some stood within the room, others, visible from\n\nthe outside, were formed against the bare wall to which a coating of a lithogenic, or stoneforming, component was used to create the texture of stone, a far-reaching colonnade\n\ncorresponding exactly to the interior framework. The peristyle decor, the main room,\n\nartistsâ dressing rooms, lighting and monitoring gallery â the whole composition, viewed\n\nclearly from the outside, conferred a lively appearance to the very simple faÃ§ade. Below the\n\ncornice there was a continuous frieze of narrow cylinders. This frieze, also visible from\n\ninside the room, was not part of the decoration, rather it formed a mechanical ventilation\n\ndevice made of a succession of half-pipes encased one inside the other, and which, in\n\nletting the air pass, intercepted the light.\n\nIn the pavilions and garden of the SÃ¨vres factory, Patoutâs subtle art and his taste for\n\ncontrasts and theatrical effects could be found. Eight colossal seven-metre tall vases, made\n\nfrom concrete reinforced with wood, and covered with sandstone tiles, constituted an\n\napogee of great allure. Close to them, the low white pavilions which faced each other and\n\nwere reflected in mirror-like water with blue edges, the garden, surrounded by small\n\nsquare plinths which connected the festoons, full of refinement and delicacy. The pavilions\n\nwere made of reinforced stone, covered with sandstone until halfway-up. No window\n\npunctuated the faÃ§ade, so that no wallâs inside surface was lost for the presentation of\n\nobjects. The light came from the ceiling. It was a simple and expressive project of a\n\nhomogeneous composition, despite its division into two parts, imposed by the site. The\n\ngoal was to highlight ceramic as a resource for the interior or exterior decoration of the\n\nhouse and for the decoration of a garden. This goal was achieved.\n\nGood architecture is made from the inside out. The internal plan of the Exhibition\n\ndetermined the place, the importance, and the character of the doors. Two of the most\n\nimportant ones were situated at the end of the two main thoroughfares and opened up for\n\nthe visitor coming from the centre of the city. At a time when the barriers fall, when the\n\nexchanges of all kinds multiply, does not the phrase âmonumental gateâ awaken more\n\nthan a vague idea? In fact, they were not the gates of cities, but the gates of an exhibition.\n\nSince an enclosure had been traced, it was necessary to create gates to get in and get out.\n\nFor all of them, the same strategy was adopted: the entrance on the sides where the\n\nvisitors waited in lines, the exit in the middle where they could come and go without\n\nobstruction, side-by-side, in small groups. The Gate of Honour opened onto the Avenue\n\nNicolas II. Let us imagine it as we would have seen it if the projects of the architects\n\nHenri Favier and AndrÃ© Ventre had been carried out with permanent materials. Arranged\n\ntwo by two, sixteen polished granite pylons connected by openwork grids and pressed\n\nmetal friezes were strongly drawn up in the plan. Bronze basins stood on them from\n\nwhich neon-illuminated glass flowed at night. Carried out by means of iron ribbons\n\npassed through the rolling mill, then cut, curved, and assembled in patterns of water jets\n\nwhich were repeated in staggered rows; the grids were to prove that the machine,\n\nJohn Wenrich,\n\nThe RCA Building,\n\nexterior views, c. 1931.\n\nInk, pastel, and gouache on paper.\n\nRCA Building (now the GE Building),\n\nRockefeller Center, New York.\n\nP:42\n\n42\n\nsubjected to human intelligence, can create beauty as well as the hand, just more\n\neconomically. In fact, these materials and this work were imitated in shiny plaster. The\n\nvisitor was only to assess what was in front of him as full-scale mock-up. But we could\n\nadmire the elegance of the silhouettes, the equal distribution of the framework and the\n\nopenwork panels, the welcoming appearance of the whole which, although starting out\n\nwith a wide angled frame, gradually narrowed, guiding the visitor and his view towards\n\nthe centre of the Exhibition.\n\nFavier and Ventre only had to raise a gate spanning an avenue lined with constructions to\n\nhouse exhibits. More complex was the problem Patout had to deal with at the entrance of\n\nthe Cours-la-Reine. Obliged to treat the trees with care and to only use the gaps between\n\ntheir main branches, he was required to build constructions high enough to attract\n\nattention from far away and stable enough to resist the wind, but without being able to use\n\nfoundations; moreover he had to take into account the fact that the gate was shaped like a\n\nspire, that could be seen from different directions. He thus arranged his piece in a circle,\n\nthe only non-deformable figure: ten square columns, crowned with basins out of which\n\nbeams of light would spout. Between these pylons, the outgoing flow of visitors would go\n\nout, leaving in all directions. The entrances were to the right and to the left: four lines,\n\narranged in a circle of square bases, connected by chains, channelled the crowd towards\n\nthe turnstiles.\n\nEach pylon measured 72 feet in height, 11 and a half feet in width and weighed\n\napproximately 100 metric tons. They were built out of reinforced clinker concrete. Their\n\nwalls, three inches thick, were coated on the outside in a lime mortar. An open door\n\nlocated nearly ten feet above the ground, and a hook-on ladder placed on the inside, gave\n\naccess to the top to service the lighting. Due to the impossibility of digging the ground\n\nbecause of the sewers, of the tramlines, the gas and water pipes, and the electric cables;\n\nPatout had built some of the pylons on reinforced concrete bridges, others on concrete\n\nplinths or stone slabs which distributed the load in low pressure over the loose ground.\n\nLastly, to ensure their stability, he ballasted them at the base by piling up paving stones\n\nbetween their walls to a height of ten feet above the ground. Despite being very\n\ninteresting from the point of view of the technical challenges, with simple lines, and an\n\noriginal and well-conceived design in order to catch the eye from afar, the merits of the\n\nwork were, however, much discussed. We acknowledge the fact that, on one point, the\n\ncriticism is deserved, specifically on what was not done. At certain times, a door must be\n\nclosed, even if it is called âmonumental entranceâ. However, no means of closure having\n\nbeen planned, it was necessary, in order to comply with the rules of the customs\n\nwarehouses, to put up a wooden barrier with full doors behind the pylons, of little\n\nmonumental effect.\n\nThe architect was not to blame for having disturbed the peace of the beautiful decor to\n\nwhich many eyes were accustomed. Any other construction in a new style, in its place,\n\nwould also undoubtedly have appeared just as discordant. Another gate, the third most\n\nimportant, gave a merry welcome to the crowd: the Porte dâOrsay, built from the designs\n\nof the architect Boileau. Its two pillars, with a geometric design, supported a large beam\n\non which a decorated metal banner was suspended, on one side with large typeface, on the\n\nother by a semi-cubist painting by Voguet. However, the visitor, passing under this banner,\n\nP:43\n\n43\n\nArthur E. Harvey,\n\nSpring Arts Tower, terracotta and\n\nblack and enamelled gold cladding\n\n(detail), 1931. Spring Arts Tower\n\n(formerly the headquarters of the\n\nCrocker National Bank), Los Angeles.\n\ndid not get the impression of a âsword of Damoclesâ because the banner was hidden from\n\nhim by a circular plate which connected the two pillars, 11 feet above the ground, which\n\nsheltered the turnstiles of the rain and the sun. The four symmetrical gates of the Rue de\n\nConstantine and Rue Fabert, works of Lucien Woog, Pierre Ferret, Marrast, and\n\nHerscher, were used at the same time as entrances to the Exhibition and galleries: hence\n\ntheir deep porches and pylon surrounding. At the site of the Victor-Emmanuel-III, Albert\n\nI, and Grenelle gates, the architects Guidetti, Adolphe Thiers, and Levard carried out a\n\nproject already simple in itself with further simplicity.\n\nLocated near the Gate of Honour is the tourist information pavilion. In spite of its rather\n\nstrange design, it comprised an element which, as with the pylons, served only to attract\n\nvisitors. It was a kind of tower, or rather mast, formed by two thin walls with sharp edges,\n\ncoated with a rough mortar, and cut at right angles. It housed, at a height of a little over 100\n\nfeet, the rectangular case of an electric clock, the elegant and spiritual nature of a sculptor\n\nas much as of an architect. If the small canopies of the clock case could be louvres, three\n\nsmall planks of concrete placed horizontally and equidistant of one another, the one below\n\nseemed to have no other purpose but to create recalls of forms, contrasts of light and shade:\n\na decoration in the same capacity as the garlands of the past but of a more severe aspect.\n\nP:44\n\n44\n\nThis new type of mast had four vertical posts of reinforced concrete as its framework,\n\nconnected by beams forming standoffs, with the space between them which was bricked up.\n\nThey went down 21 feet below the ground where they drowned into a reinforced concrete\n\nfooting. Thus, the lowering of the centre of gravity had ensured the stability of the\n\nensemble. In the hall, the entrance of which was announced by this mast, Mallet-Stevens\n\nused reinforced concrete with such skill, but without compromising the decoration. The work\n\ncould not have been better conceived to suit its purpose. Outside, there was an almost full and\n\nrather mysterious wall. Inside, a room, 66 feet long, surrounded by exchange and information\n\nservices. The great light which lit them up fell from the ceiling and poured through stained\n\nglass windows, set in a bay window which measured only 20 inches in height, but which\n\ncircled the whole hall with a continuous band of images of the most beautiful monuments of\n\nFrance toppling over one another, like scenery whizzing past the window of a car travelling\n\nat top speed. The part of the wall which surmounted this translucent frieze seemed,\n\nparadoxically, to be leaning on it. In fact, it was supported by strong reinforced concrete\n\nbeams, placed on pillars so thin that one did not notice their presence.\n\nPavilions of cities or regions, of department stores, of an individual or a group in the\n\nFrench section numbered around a hundred. On one of the sites, under the shade of the\n\nChamps-ÃlysÃ©es and decorated with flowers, Paris wanted to exhibit the work of its\n\nschoolchildren. Two long, symmetrical, robust, and elegant wings were connected by a\n\nhall which was used as a reception room for the Municipal Council. Full and empty,\n\nprojections and recesses were learnedly balanced by the architect Roger Bouvard. Each\n\nwing ended in a three-part projection, pierced by three high bays. This semi-hexagonal\n\nform which was repeated, high up, at the crowning of each window, showed firm lines\n\nwithout stiffness. With the ceramics vases which decorated the front steps and the stuccomarble frieze which was located under the cornice, this Trianon of schoolchildren was\n\nbrightened by a discrete polychromy.\n\nThe pavilions built for other cities raised the very delicate question of regionalism in\n\narchitecture. Undoubtedly the walls were the same, though the same roofs are not suitable\n\nfor different terrains or different climates like the ones of Brittany, Alsace, Picardy, or\n\nProvence. But local traditions, reflected in the style of building, are also due to habits, ways\n\nof life, working methods which were no longer valid. In a centralised country, in a time\n\nwhen the progress of the means of transport shortened distances, these traditions\n\ndisappear. Isnât the architect who maintains them, with a tenderness for the past, likely to\n\ncreate an anachronistic decoration? At the Exhibition, the problem became even more\n\ncomplicated. The aim was to present, under favourable conditions, various productions in\n\nthe area of arts, born in such or such a region, but intended for many others.\n\nWere they not settling for an easy picturesque style, which puts them in a category from\n\nbefore they were born? A few architects deliberately freed themselves from local\n\ntraditions. Rather, they built for cities whose characters were not so strongly marked. In\n\nthe pavilions of Lyon, Nancy, and Limoges, there was nothing particularly typical. On\n\nthe contrary, Mulhouse, Roubaix and Tourcoing, the Alpes-Maritimes, Normandy,\n\nBerry, Alsace, and Brittany invited the visitor on a tour of the provinces. The long blind\n\nfaÃ§ade of the pavilion of Lyon and Saint-Etienne, its three-tiered octagonal crowning,\n\nwith 120 windows, reminded the visitor of Tony Garnierâs fancy for grand-scale works.\n\nThe Maharajaâs bathroom,\n\nearly 1930s.\n\nUmaid Bhawan Palace, Jodhpur.\n\nP:45\n\n45\n\nP:46\n\n46\n\nP:47\n\n47\n\nJean Dunand,\n\nProject for lacquer panels\n\nfor a pair of doors, c. 1930.\n\nJean Dunand,\n\nFolding screen with two panels,\n\nc. 1925. Lacquer and ivory.\n\nPresented at the Salon des Artistes\n\nDÃ©corateurs (Convention of ArtistDecorators) in 1928.\n\nBut the powerful city, which was at the cutting edge of French urban design, offered a vast\n\nspace to the talent of its architect. He seemed to be cramped with the meagre portion of\n\nthe Esplanade des Invalides allotted to him. The building, well laid out, seemed to be\n\ndesigned for greater dimensions.\n\nOf equal surface area, the pavilion of Nancy and the East, work of Jean Bourgon and\n\nPierre Le Bourgeois, was less original, but of a more satisfactory scale. Its flattened dome\n\non top of an octagonal tambour crowned a steel hall. The rectangular bay windows of its\n\nwings would illuminate a conference room and auditorium on one side and a museum of\n\nthe region of Lorraine on the other. Everything, up to the frieze of the entrance,\n\nscreamed for a propaganda and information office for the Eastern regions. Under the trees\n\nof the Cours-la-Reine sat the pavilion of Limoges, by Pierre Chabrol, which had a vast\n\nshop window of harmonious proportions where enamels and the porcelains shimmered\n\nof their own will. One can find, in the camp of picturesque portrayals of the regions,\n\nP:48\n\n48\n\ncapped with three floors of attic windows, the highly-steeped, sloping roof designed by\n\nAndrÃ© Ventre and Jean Launay, architects of the pavilion of Mulhouse. On the walls,\n\nreinforced concrete beams replaced the old timber frame. In composing the pavilion of\n\nRoubaix and Tourcoing, De Feure remembered the brick frontages and tiered gables of the\n\nNorth of France. The pavilion-smallholding of Berry-Nivernais by Gauchery and Dreyer,\n\nthe âClos Normandâ, or enclosed flower garden, by Victorien Lelong and Pierre Chirol,\n\nand the pavilion of Franche-ComtÃ© by Boutterin all showcased beautiful framework. The\n\ntraditional farmhouse of Provence by Dallest, Castel, and Tournon, and the delightful\n\npavilion of the Alpes-Maritimes of Charles and Marcel Dalmas could, on rare occasion,\n\ngive the illusion of this privileged land where the rough-cast ochre or pink walls, the\n\nGenoese roof cornices, and the terraces with tiled balustrades form, along with large\n\nflowered earthenware jars, the most pleasant decoration.\n\nWhy were there, at the entrance of the Village, two pavilions to represent Alsace? This\n\nis, Raymond RÃ©gamey tells us, because of two different concepts of regionalism, one\n\nnarrower, the other one broader, which divide Alsatian architects. Eugene Haug, in the\n\nHouse of Alsace, was forced to make some changes to this residence that would\n\npreviously have pleased his German neighbours. ThÃ©o Berst, on the contrary, creator of\n\nthe pavilion of Art in Alsace, did not fear these alterations. He had faith in reinforced\n\nconcrete. The obligation to fit a public passage under the country house that he had\n\ndesigned, had given him the idea of building external staircases reminiscent of those\n\nwe sometimes see in his homeland. But he had given up on the projecting storey and on\n\ngables protected by flat, tiled canopies, as they seemed a little misplaced in Paris. At the\n\nother end of the Village, high slate roofs, white rendering, paved granite kerbs: it was\n\nthe massive House of Brittany, somewhat modernised, built by Vaugeois. The painter\n\nLemordant, the ardent organiser of the work, had arranged for it to house an\n\nexhibition gallery.\n\nThe local characteristics of materials, forms, and colours appeared even better in the\n\ncolonial pavilions. One mainly noticed the large hall with carved wooden columns of IndoChina, the white patios enhanced with green and blue ceramics of North Africa, the\n\nmassive buildings of red stone coming from the beginning of time, and the dome of the\n\npalace of French Western Africa, built by Germain Olivier, which bristled with\n\nthreatening spikes.\n\nLet us return to the constructions which best epitomised 1925. Few projects were more\n\nâmodernâ than that of a pavilion of a department store. There, a certain outward shine\n\nand gloss is appropriate: it contributes to publicity. Hence, let us not reproach the luxury\n\nof stained glass and marble of such or such a pavilion, or another its cement with gold\n\nniello accents, its columns, its roof dotted with pebbles of moulded glass which\n\nilluminated the night. Let us note the variety of solutions brought to the same\n\nchallenges: the use of octagonal rooms of the same dimensions, the same size pavilions,\n\nand ease of circulation. All four comprised of a central hall, the axis around which\n\nradiated largely open rooms. All four of them used floral decoration to a great extent.\n\nBut, what a differences in appearance!

The stand taken could not have been expressed more clearly.\n\nSauvage did not want to lose even one inch of the space conceded to the Printemps stores;\n\nhence, this hut came to be. As it happens it is rather elegant with its conical roof of\n\nreinforced concrete, following the exact outline and capping low walls, coating the sides of\n\nthe octagon. But, except for the bay windows, there was no significant match between the\n\noutside and the interior, where hollow columns by Levard had a great effect but did not\n\nsupport any weight. The work of Laprade, the pavilion of the Louvre stores, made of iron\n\nand fireproofed wood, covered with plaster, was characterised by its welcoming covered\n\nterrace. A little complicated, but of an extremely original design was the pavilion of the\n\nGalleries Lafayette, by Hiriart, Tribout, and Beau, with its external shop windows, its\n\nfront porch, its pergolas, its three tiered terraces, the faÃ§ade of its entrance crowned with\n\na glass roof and set back enough of a way to rise as high as the hall, without exceeding\n\nthe outline. The carpets and furniture stores of the Place Clichy were presented by\n\nCharles Siclis in two symmetrical pavilions, the great inscriptions of which constituted the\n\nprincipal decoration. The department store La Samaritaine had settled in a very simple\n\ncubic pavilion, initially intended for a publishing house. Its architect, Auguste Perret, had\n\napplied to it, as at the theatre, his principles of economy. Four wooden posts pushed into\n\nthe ground on a bank of the Seine raised to the level of the quay and then bore long lintels\n\nand framings made of reinforced concrete.\n\nIn the pavilions built for decorators or industrialists, a great number of architects\n\nexhibited their talent. The pavilion of stained glass windows was one of the most\n\nremarkable works from a point of view of the implementation of the plan. Built on stilts\n\nby Lucien Woog, his project of broken lines had, in a restricted space, appreciably\n\nincreased the surface of the walls made available to translucent paintings. Some pavilions\n\nwere characterised by the importance of the external shop windows: such as those of La\n\nMaison de Blanc by OnÃ¨me and Marleix, or those of the Diamantes (diamond cutters) by\n\nJ. Lambert, SaackÃ©, and Bailly, octagonal kiosks capped with a dome on stilts such the\n\nGoldscheider pavilion by Eric Bagge, lit up like a sculptorâs workshop, or the one of Art\n\nand Decoration and of contemporary French Artisans, by Henri Pacon, vertically divided\n\ninto two areas, the lower area all in openwork, the other one, calm and full. Dimensions of\n\nthe ground and the outline could not have been used any better for the presentation of\n\nbooks and precious artefacts.\n\nElsewhere reined the serene beauty of full walls, or only pierced by essential thin teeth. A\n\nlarge square door, framed by glass tiles, which opened onto the main faÃ§ade with simple\n\nnobility, was offered by the Lalique pavilion built by Marc Ducluzeaud. The pavilion of the\n\nMusÃ©e dâArt Contemporain, by Louis SÃ¼e and AndrÃ© Mare, which had maliciously been\n\ncompared with a marabout (Muslim holy manâs shrine), comprised a circular gallery,\n\nsurrounding a large round room with cupola. Hence its appearance, which was repeated\n\nfor the Fontaine pavilion, a work of the same architects: a low cube with its main entrance\n\non a chamfered wall, blind walls capped with a low, flat roof. The pavilion of Christofle and\n\nBaccarat by Georges Chevalier, well-lit inside by a glass ceiling, presented the outside\n\nappearance of a massive, rectangular construction. At the pavilion of the Editions CrÃ¨s\n\npublishing house, where three symbolic buttresses systems affected the shape of books\n\nJohn Storrs,\n\nForms in Space, Number I, c. 1924.\n\nStainless steel and copper.\n\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art,\n\nNew York.\n\nP:53\n\n53\n\npropped upright on the ground as if on a shelf, the imagination and the subtle taste of\n\nHiriart, Tribout, and Beau could be found. The pavilion of Art Applied to Trades, by\n\nCharles-Henri Besnard and Bernard Haubold, housed ten rooms distributed around a\n\ncentral hall. The preoccupation with emphasising various materials could be recognised:\n\nthe grey walls and the balustrade were made from concrete hardened with coarse\n\naggregates, the polished stones of the Lyon region framed the entrance, and the slate roof,\n\nin the shape of a cross, undulated to make it shimmer.\n\nThe HÃ´tel du Collectionneur, built under the direction of Pierre Patout, presented an elegant\n\ncompromise between an exhibition pavilion and a real hotel. It was like a contemporary\n\nfolly (or purposeless â though aesthetically pleasing â construction), whose white walls\n\none would have liked to have seen emerging from the greenery of a park. Entering\n\nthrough the narrow door, the visitor got the impression of having benefitted from a favour.\n\nAs soon as he passed through the low hall and the gallery, he would arrive under the high\n\ncupola of an oval living room, on whose right and left were rooms intended for private use.\n\nThis layout, along with the differences in height of the rooms, translated on the outside\n\ninto projections from the walls and a crowning in the shape of a truncated pyramid, with\n\nbroad steps. In addition, the back wall was slightly withdrawn on one of the sides of the\n\nsquare conceded to the Ruhlmann group. The architect had sacrificed part of the ground\n\nin order to be able, without exceeding the tyrannical, but beneficial, outline, to build the\n\nwalls of the oval living room, and, therefore, the three beautiful French windows, higher.\n\nThus he had obtained, from both the outside and the inside, these contrasts which animate\n\nthe work and make it possible to give even an exiguous space an impression of size.\n\nOn the right bank of the Seine, let us mention the Fontanis pavilion, a closed temple\n\ndedicated to the perfumes created by Eric Bagge, the Corcellet-MorancÃ© pavilion, a sort of\n\nâlittle houseâ where Marrast had skilfully arranged pleasant viewpoints, the Renaissance\n\npavilion, a small building of pleasing sobriety, like a park gazebo designed by Guillaume\n\nTronchet. The latter was also the architect of the Postes et TÃ©lÃ©graphes pavilion and the\n\npavilion of the Royal Asturian Mining Company. The former was notable for its great size.\n\nThe latter constituted a demonstration of the possible application of zinc for the coating\n\nof roofs and walls. The pavilion of the Club des Architectes diplÃ´mÃ©s had been built with\n\nmoulded materials under the direction of Paul Tournon. The overall unit did not appear\n\nat first glance. The architect had to use the ground not taken over by the trees. From a\n\nhexagonal hall, four wings sheltering the showrooms glowed under the greenery. The\n\nmain door, flanked by two symmetrical bay windows and two niches, offered a relaxing\n\nview over the principal clearing of the gardens of the Cours-la-Reine.\n\nNext to the houses intended to offer framework a lively setting for the decorative works\n\nof art, some real or possible houses could be seen: âmodernâ houses, without outrageous\n\nmodernism, those of the Village. A daring anticipation of the house of tomorrow: the\n\nâcellâ of the âNew Spiritâ. Equidistant from one another were the rest stop pavilions.\n\nThe initial plan of the French Village had been conceived by Adolphe Dervaux; Charles\n\nGÃ©nuys carried it out. An infinitely delicate task, given that this collective work united\n\na score of architects with very different tendencies, allied by a common ideal of sincerity\n\nand common sense. It was like an anthology of the renewed village or rather like a portion\n\nof a rather rich village, built alongside a narrow street during those previous years.\n\nSonia Delaunay,\n\nIllustration for the book La Prose du\n\nTranssibÃ©rien et la petite Jehanne de\n\nFrance (Prose of the Trans-Siberian\n\nand of Little Jehanne of France) by\n\nBlaise Cendrars, 1913. Amsterdam.\n\nP:54\n\n54\n\nConcrete allied itself with a judicious use of traditional materials. Town hall was\n\npleasing and its plan irreproachable. However, the undulations and decoration of its\n\nfaÃ§ade transported visitors to the 1900s. It could be assumed that the construction had\n\nbeen entrusted to Hector Guimard by a bold municipality some twenty-five years before.\n\nSince then, a younger generation of municipal officials who were not afraid of\n\ninnovation, such as Patoutâs expressive piece made of reinforced concrete; a limited but\n\nclearly defined design. Brunet had built for the weaver, a man of good taste and with a\n\nsuccessful business, a house not only intimate but also airy and light, able to make a good\n\nimpression next to the accommodating vicinity of the old houses of the Ãle-de-France\n\nand the Loire. To varying degrees, the middle-class dwelling by Hamelet, the Lorraine\n\ninn of Pierre Selmersheim, the Maison de Tous, a model communal house with polychrome\n\nhighlights by Agache, and finally the bazaar of Oudin, all presented the same elegance.\n\nOliver Bernard,\n\nHall of the Strand Palace Hotel,\n\n1930-1931. London.\n\nP:55\n\n55\n\nJaap Gidding,\n\nThe Tuschinski Cinema, foyer,\n\n1918-1921. Amsterdam. (pp. 56-57)\n\nNo doubt was possible as for the destination of Bluysenâs pharmacy, Gouverneurâs fish\n\nshop, Guillemonatâs houses for clog-makers, or Loys Brachetâs monumental mason. The\n\nsurprising element of Levardâs bakery was its two massive columns which seemed to\n\nbe the quaint remainders of an older construction. For the school, Paul GÃ©nuys had\n\nenjoyed a particular advantage. The space that had been allocated to him was less\n\nlimited than that of his fellow members. A school necessitates the strict observation of\n\ncertain dimensions, and, in particular, the height of the ceiling fixed at 13 feet. It made\n\nfull use of this obligation. With its canopy, its portico where one could imagine\n\nchildren sheltered from the rain, and a well ventilated classroom, the school was\n\nincredibly pleasing.\n\nThe village had a church and a cemetery. The latter was a little rich for a village, but\n\ncertainly of good quality, as the monumental masons had worked magic there. As for the\n\nchurch, without a nave due to a lack of space, its principal purpose was to show that\n\ncertain parts of the ensemble, required by the immutable needs for worship, were\n\nparticularly suited to the use of concrete. If Droz had made it a little imposing, it was\n\nbecause he had to provide a large mural surface on the inside for the various\n\nmanifestations of religious art. He designed it as a rectangular oratory, whose faÃ§ade was\n\noccupied by the porch and the base of the bell-tower. The decoration of the three chapels\n\nwith open sections on the other sides had been entrusted to the three religious art\n\nsocieties grouped around the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society. Which country did the cell of\n\nthe New Spirit call its home? It was difficult to say. In spite of its strange appearance it\n\nwas of our world, of an industrialised world, not of a utopian kingdom. We say âcellâ and\n\nnot âpavilionâ. Le Corbusier and Jeanneret had indeed presented one unit of a whole, an\n\nelement of a âbuilding-villaâ, produced in series with posts and flagstones. âMass\n\nproduced houses for the common man, architectural standards, and entirely industrial\n\nconstructionâ, including the metal fittings of bay windows. âThe carpenter no longer\n\ninterferes with the building.â The building-villa, thus imagined, would include a hundred\n\nidentical villas atop one another on five storeys. For each one, a terrace-garden,\n\nrigorously seperate, a vast room divided by a sloping ceiling and partitioning. The effect\n\nof composition should not be considered by each individual unit, but by looking at its\n\nrepetition within the ensemble. At the Exhibition, the ceiling of the terrace-garden was\n\npierced to allow the passage of a tree which the architect did not have the right to touch.\n\nHence the bizarre sight which either piqued the visitorâs curiosity or shattered his\n\nillusion. But this was nevertheless a significant detail. Elsewhere, the architects\n\nendeavoured to adapt their composition to the terrain and the existing topiary. Le\n\nCorbusier, on the contrary, wanted to demonstrate a priori, his abstract schema, able to\n\nbe replicated on any other site, with contempt for the trivial circumstances to which\n\nothers did not hesitate to alter their designs. This schema, in spite of the excesses, is well\n\nworth considering and could open up new prospects to observers.\n\nThe rest-stop pavilion, where a pleasant restaurant fits naturally into its space, was\n\nhalfway between the old inns without comfort, though amusing for the eye of the\n\npainter, and the âdwelling machineâ of Le Corbusier. The use of reinforced concrete did\n\nnot banish any of its picturesque nature, but it was only due to its projections, justified\n\nby their utility. The welcoming rest-stop, with its supply of gasoline and oil, bar,\n\nrestaurant, and berths that the tourist, due to bad weather conditions or mechanical failure,\n\nP:58\n\n58\n\nwould be happy to find along the roadside. Following a contest organised by the National\n\nAlumni Association of the School of Decorative Arts, the talent of Marcel Bernard was\n\nhonoured. But it also showed the excellence of the flexible, vivacious, and rational\n\nteaching, which Charles GÃ©nuys provided to the pupils of this school for many years.\n\nIt was appropriate that a reception hall was reserved for the Exhibitionâs organisers in the\n\ngardens of the Exhibition, near the offices arranged in the Grand Palais. It is for this hall,\n\ntogether with some additional rooms, that Albert ChrÃ©tien-Lalanne had a pavilion with\n\nterrace built, simple but not lacking nobility, with a peristyle porch and crowned with a\n\nwrought iron balustrade. A liquid stone rendering gave the walls a clean look, free from\n\ndryness. The meeting room, built by Haubold, the function room of Louis Sweats, and the\n\nmonumental staircase of Charles Letrosne which lead to this hall, did not require any\n\nwork to be expressed through external silhouettes. They were, inside the walls of the\n\nGrand Palais, large decorations carried out in precarious materials. Inside the meeting\n\nroom there was a huge challenge to anchor, even temporarily, the overhang of the\n\nbalconies intended to contain several hundred people, into the galleries on the first storey\n\nof the Grand Palais, and to organise a platform with the possibility of making\n\ncinematographic projections onto a screen, whereby the existing cupola was obstructing\n\nits mounting. The authors showed what could have been an audition hall, if it was carried\n\nout with the simple shapes of reinforced concrete, covered with a beautiful material such\n\nas yellow marble, combined with the gold of the luminous frieze and the framing of the\n\nplatform, with the swathes of violet carpets, and the seats and the painting forming the\n\nbackground. The village hall attracted more attention with its decoration than by its\n\narchitecture. The pompous decoration was a premeditated challenge to the artistic\n\nPuritanism of the time. The white niches, heavily plastered and ornamented with reverse\n\nbrackets, emphasised the paintings of Jaulmes and one admired the rich imagination of\n\ntheir luminous fountains.\n\nThe monumental staircase and the hall designed by Charles Letrosne were to lend\n\nthemselves to large and brilliant ceremonies. None of the visitors will ever forget the\n\nstriking impression of this ensemble where the straight line ruled supreme. The hall used\n\nonly two thirds of the height of the nave under which it was located. Nonetheless, it\n\nappeared taller. This illusion was created by contrasts and the simplicity of the surfaces.\n\nLong lintels rested on thin square pillars; doors and niches on a human scale opened on\n\nthe bottom of full walls going up without interruption as far as the cornice. The\n\nprogressive narrowing of the steps increased the perspective effect of the staircase. The\n\nwalls, with a rough, rosy-grey coating, were almost bare. Only some pale gold arabesques\n\nglistened gently here and there. All this was nothing but a decoration supported by an\n\ninvisible forest of framework. But this decoration could have been carried out in reinforced\n\nconcrete. With simple, large, and firm lines, it will remain in memory like a symbol of the\n\ncontemporary aspirations of French architecture, associated with an art of composition\n\nwhich has not lost any of its privileges.\n\nIn the pavilion of the Club des Architects diplÃ´mÃ©s, a panoramic model and ancient glass slides,\n\nlit from behind, transported the visitor to Morocco. One was able to admire the great\n\narchitechtural work in all its glory, achieved under the direction of a visionary chief and\n\npowerful organiser.

In the new\n\ngeneral residence of Rabat, Henri Prost and his collaborators, Laprade, Laforgue, and\n\nRigollet, created a novel French work without brutally breaking with the countryâs\n\narchitectural tradition. In Casablanca, the law courts by Marrast and the post office building\n\nby Laforgue deserve the same praise. As for the new indigenous city, its design was\n\ndifferent. Though traced with better skill and more salubrious than the old one, it had to be\n\ncompletely Arabian. It is the case and this result does credit to the architect Laprade. With\n\nits small houses with terraces and its patios shaded by a tree or a trellis, it is a garden-city\n\nunder the African sun.\n\nIn the French section, sculpture played a considerable role, showing that at that time, as\n\nbefore, there was no other art which produced on the premises better and brighter talents.\n\nBut good sculpture cannot be improvised. The figures which Charles Despiau and Aristide\n\nMaillol exhibited were the result of a long research period. La France by Bourdelle which,\n\nstanding in front of the Grand Palais, seeming to greet the nations, had been cast in\n\nbronze to commemorate the arrival of the American volunteers in 1917 at the Pointe de\n\nGrave. The sculptures of The White Bear by FranÃ§ois Pompom, The Source by Alfred Jean\n\nHalou, the groups or the statues by Lucienne Heuvelmans and Yvonne Serruys, Arnold,\n\nGuenot, Poncin, Traverse, and RÃ©al del Sarte, were all already known, this without\n\ncounting many busts and figures which enriched the furniture sets. The Pallas Athena\n\nbronze by Carlo Sarrabezolles, forgetting her dignity, drunk in her state of Pyrrhichios\n\ndance, was, however, a surprise to eyes accustomed to calmer forms. The Reception by Louis\n\nDejean was not an isolated statue. Standing upright on a base in front of the pylons of the\n\nPorte de la Concorde, this figure of woman, semi-nude and gilded, animated the\n\nmonumental entrance with its silhouette. It looked very much like the recent creations of\n\na sculptor who, having started off from modelling spiritual representations which carry\n\non the methods of yesteryear, had gradually been elevated to a more vigorous and more\n\ngeneral art, without losing anything of its sensitivity. Associating sculpture with\n\narchitecture by placing statues in niches is certainly not an innovation. However, Charles\n\nPlumet, chief architect of the Exhibition, had need of niches in the Court of Trades in\n\norder to break up the monotony of long sides coloured by paintings.\n\nHe created so many half-sized bronze figures of simple, straight lines for these fourteen\n\nniches, representing the principal crafts and trades. Although these figures, placed almost\n\nin the open air, gave too much of an impression of precious statuettes made for a closed\n\ngallery, who would not commend the study for and the implementation of the design, the\n\nchoice of sculptors, and their willingness to work under the direction of the project\n\nmanager? One could admire talents as diverse as those of Paul Niclausse, inspired by the\n\nMiddle Ages painters of popular pictures, which combined the largest forms with a\n\nmoving observation of the model, as well as Fernand David, whose death was a great loss\n\nfor art, Albert Pommier, Dejean, Marque, WlÃ©rick, Cavaillon, Drivier, Halou, Arnold,\n\nGuenot, Traverse, Vigoureux, and Contesse. The ensemble, supplemented by low-reliefs of\n\nthe fountain created by Poisson, and by the decorations of the corners by Le Bourgeois,\n\nproved that then, as in the past, originality does not come without an intelligent discipline.\n\nBut in the high or the low-relief, it is the wall itself which, in certain chosen places, lit\n\nup by a âhuman smileâ. The difficulty consists in choosing their location. They put the\n\nonus on the architect to equip the building with bases (pediments, metopes, or friezes,\n\nP:62\n\n62\n\ntympanums, archivolts, or splays); the same could not be said in a concrete construction\n\nwhich is presented in the form of a block, and even less of a temporary building where the\n\nframework covered in plaster. It is, above all, the personal taste of the architect which\n\ndetermines the relief âs shape and protrusion, its position in harmony with the lines of the\n\nfaÃ§ade, and the height where it is affixed to the building.\n\nWithout counting the low-reliefs which were essential to be seen by the visitor\n\nthroughout the Exhibition, we will mention, as strong examples, the enormous\n\ncartouche which grouped together, on the square pediment of the pavilion of Lyon and\n\nSaint-Ãtienne, the symbols of the Saone and the Loire rivers. Less imposing, though\n\nmore legible, were the flexible compositions of Joseph Bernard, inscribed on the outside\n\nwalls of the HÃ´tel du Collectionneur. The rough-hewn letters, with a stark contrast\n\nbetween shade and light, remain inert. It is in the subtle passages connecting the various\n\nparts of the ensemble that the sculpture quivers under the caresses of the day. Such had\n\nbeen the rich lesson of the great Rodin and, many years earlier, of the Greeks and of\n\nAssyria, with its Wounded Lioness. Qualities similar to those of Joseph Bernard were\n\nnoticed in the low-relief of Janniot, at the entrance of the Saint-DominiqueConstantine gallery. They were also found in his Homage to Jean Goujon, a group very\n\nfortunately placed in front of the faÃ§ade of the HÃ´tel du Collectionneur, in quarter circles.\n\nUnfortunately, these skilful compositions, these attractive models revealed a manner\n\nrather than a style. The heads curiously small, with a conventional smile, were perhaps\n\ncloser to certain spiritual mannequins, exhibited in the fashionable galleries, than to\n\nHellenic sculpture or the sculpture of Jean Goujon. Without distinguishable sculptural\n\nqualities, the friezes of workmen at work, modelled by Bachelet for the pavilion of\n\nNancy, were aligned with the building. The same goes for the discontinuous friezes of\n\nthe Navarre pavilion and the panel of the Gate of Honour. The forms were voluntarily\n\nabridged, but the composition was legible and the figures were to scale. It is difficult to\n\nimagine a high relief more interdependent with the wall than the two Victories with\n\ntheir giant swords drawn up at the entry of the crypt of Hartmannswillerkopf. They\n\nwere the work of a Master who knew how to discipline his ardour and his romanticism\n\nin order to render the monumental statuary its power. In harmony with the noble\n\narchitecture of Danis, the two winged sentinels of Bourdelle, upright for eternal duty,\n\nare the picture of serene vigilance and of an enduring memory.\n\nTo respect architectural dimensions, many sculptors made sure to establish their\n\nreliefs very low, protected by the bare part of the wall, such as Saupique and Jouant,\n\ncreators of the flat panels encrusted below the external doors of the Court of Trades.\n\nOn the outer walls of the pavilions of SÃ¨vres, the graceful medallions of the late Max\n\nBlondat, and on the doors of the pavilion of Le Bon MarchÃ©, the compositions of\n\nCÃ©line Lepage were done in champlevÃ©. The low-reliefs by Pierre Poisson, on the four\n\nfaces of the fountain of the Court of Trades were not very prominent, but were\n\nhighly stylised: the gold film which covered them made the fine decoration highly\n\nsensitive. The low-reliefs of Bouraine and Faguays at the pavilion of the City of Paris\n\n(designed by Drivier and Delamarre), situated in the same hall with the polychrome\n\nstuccos composed by Russet-Spitz, were thicker but the composition was just as calm.\n\nThe ones which DardÃ© had sculpted for the framework of a chimney were illuminated\n\nlike in naÃ¯ve imagery.

This is laudable, so\n\nlong as it keeps its charm. Henry Bouchard presented the best examples with the fountain\n\nof the gardens of SÃ¨vres and with two friezes in the main hall of the embassy. However,\n\nas four very âmodernâ interpretations of the eternal topic of the four seasons testified,\n\nmodelled by him for a patio of the Esplanade des Invalides, this was but one of the faces\n\nof his marvellous talent, directed by intelligence and nourished by observation. Two\n\ngroups of sculptures, supported by individual initiatives, were once again due to the\n\ntechnique of the low-relief (one completely, the other for the most part): La Pergola de la\n\nDouce France and Le Temple de lâEffort humain by Landowski. In La Pergola de la Douce\n\nFrance, the general composition and distribution of the sculpture had been imagined by\n\nEmmanuel de Thubert, allowing the group of sculptors to translate the Celtic doctrine by\n\ndirectly carving it onto beautiful stone of the country, provided courtesy of the\n\nquarrymen of Verdun and Lens.\n\nThe architecture had been carried out by Lucien Woog, with the collaboration of\n\nJacques Bouvet. The Celtic faith had not prevented the collaborator, Emmanuel de\n\nThubert, from producing works as varied as the cubists dancers of the Martel brothers,\n\nan image of heavenly delight from LâIle dâAvalon, and the Holy Grail of Georges\n\nSaupique, of traditional weighting, Les Serpents des Druides of the SÃ©guin workshop, a\n\nmodel of full composition, and the Sanglier, or Wild Boar of Pompon, depicted mid-leap,\n\naccording to the tradition of prehistoric engravers. There was no less variety in the\n\nlow-reliefs of Hilbert, Lamourdedieu, Pablo ManÃ¨s, Nicot, and Zadkine. As for the\n\ndiscipline of direct carving, it is a salutary reminder of the loyalty due to the craft, at\n\na time when too many sculptors entrusted the expert completion of their works to\n\nmere technicians. It is a laudable reaction against the weakness of modelling and âthe\n\ninfernal easeâ of using clay. As for the rest, the firmness of the sculpture is due to\n\nintelligence, not the hand. The good craftsmen of La Pergola de la Douce France have\n\nproved this to be so, each one according to his spirit: that is how Joachim Costa, in his\n\nskilfully composed low-relief of Tristan and Iseult, combined the richness of the plans\n\nand the subtlety of the design with the most virile execution.
