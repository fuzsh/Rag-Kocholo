        "text": "Communication occurs in the way people understand what others are saying. On a construction site, meetings of various types are the arena where the participants should share their understandings on safety issues and topics. A considerable portion of work time in a project at hand is spent in meetings. Meetings should promote work safety on a construction site, but do they? What is gained in the meetings? Are people truly participating or is a meeting just a “must” or a “play with a mutual manuscript”. The objective of this paper is to elaborate findings from project safety meetings in Finnish construction sites. The research questions are: What issues are discussed in the course of safety meetings? How do the participants share their knowledge in the meetings? What issues or methods inspire the participants to discuss in the meetings? What could Lean Construction have to offer to the way we manage safety? This paper begins by an introduction and a literature review to management cul...\n\nPurpose The purpose of this paper is to unpack the shared understandings of safety held by workers on large UK construction sites using a complexity lens, and so provide empirical support for the inclusion of situational self-organising within construction site safety management systems (SMS). Design/methodology/approach A social constructionist epistemology supports the discourse analysis of talk (semi-structured interview and conversational), text (SMS and documentation) and visual (safety related signage) data collection from five large (+£20 m) UK construction sites. Findings Construction workers readily understand safety to be an emergent phenomenon with the complex system that is the construction site. Contemporary safety management approaches struggle with this complexity, yet there is the potential to mobilise situational self-organising on sites to improve safety in practice. Research limitations/implications Epistemological foundations mean no claim is made to generalisabi...\n\nIn the Construction industry, there must also be a Collective Culture of Safety. One of the challenges facing the construction industry is in determining what more can be done about Occupational Health and Safety (OH&S). Stakeholders may appear to comply with all OH&S legislation. However, what else should be done? This paper therefore presents an analysis of the stakeholders responsible for a culture of safe collective and individual behaviour in the construction industry and their potential interactions. Previously published models for the stakeholders involved in safety are three- and four-party models involving five different stakeholders. This paper extended the models to include ten stakeholders. All the OH&S stakeholders should all be working together to implement safe, collective and individual behaviour. The stakeholders that were identified from the literature include educators, employers (professionals, contractors and sub-contractors), employees (workers, foremen, trades...\n\nCurrent level of knowledge on the impact of socio-cultural factors on building collapses in the construction sector is limited. Such phenomena are studied mainly as ‘engineering’ problems. Encouragingly, today, there is a growing momentum towards a socio-cultural approach to safety in the sector. The approach, however, focuses only on health and safety management concerns in the context of physical construction. Little or no attention is given to accidents caused by built structures. This essay argues that the principles of health and safety in the construction sector apply to not only those who are engaged in work; they also apply to those who are placed at risk by work activities, including members of the public. Therefore, limiting the impact of socio-cultural factors on safety in the sector to only worker safety obscures the impact of the factors on another vantage area of safety in the sector: the dangers posed by completed structures such as buildings to public health. The essay argues that a sociocultural grounding for building safety/accidents in the construction sector is warranted. A socio-cultural approach to building collapse could be worthwhile, in complementing the engineering focal approach, for identifying pathways to avoidance."
