Colour woodcut. Victoria and Albert Museum, London. Decorative and industrial arts, like all forms of art, are an expression of life itself: they evolve with the times and with moral or material demands to which they must respond. Their agenda and means are modern, ever-changing, and aided by technological progress. It is the agenda that determines the shapes; hence technology is also part of it: sometimes they are limited by its imperfections, sometimes it develops them by way of its resources, and sometimes they form themselves. Weaving was initially invented because of the need to clothe the body. Its development has been crucial to that of textile arts. Today, market competition has created the need for advertising: the poster is a resulting development and the chromolithograph turned it into an art form. Railways could not have existed without the progress of metallurgy, which in turn paved the way for a new style of architecture. There is a clear parallel between human needs and the technology that caters to them. Art is no different. The shapes it creates are determined by those needs and new technologies; hence, they can only be modern. The more logical they are, the more likely they are to be beautiful. If art wants to assume eccentric shapes for no reason, it will be nothing more than a fad because there is no meaning behind it. Sources of inspiration alone do not constitute modernism. However numerous they are, there is not an inexhaustive supply of them: it is not the first time that artists have dared to use geometry, nor is it the first time that they have drawn inspiration from the vegetable kingdom. Roman goldsmiths, sculptors from the reign of Louis XIV, and Japanese embroiderers all perhaps reproduced the flower motif more accurately than in 1900. Some “modern” pottery works are similar to the primitive works of the Chinese or the Greeks. Perhaps it is not paradoxical to claim that the new forms of decoration are only ancient forms long gone from our collective memory. An overactive imagination, an over-use of complicated curves, and excessive use of the vegetable motif – these have been, over the centuries, the criticisms ascribed to the fantasies of their predecessors by restorers of straight lines, lines that Eugène Delacroix qualified as monstrous to his romantic vision. What’s more, in the same way that there has always been a right wing and a left wing in every political spectrum, ancient and modern artists (in age and artistic tendencies) have always existed side-by-side. Their squabbles seem so much more futile, as with a little hindsight, we can see the similarities in the themes of their creations, which define their styles. The style of an era is marked on all works that are attributed to it, and an artist’s individualism does not exempt his works from it. It would be excessive to say that art must be limited to current visions in order to be modern. It is, however, also true that the representation of contemporary customs and fashion was, at all times, one of the elements of modernism. The style of a Corinthian crater comes from its shape, a thin-walled pottery vessel inspired by the custom of mixing water and wine before serving them. But its style also results from its decoration: the scenes painted on it depicted contemporary life or mythological scenes. Those who think that the Jacquard loom, the lace-making machine, the great metalworking industry, and gas lighting all date from the beginning of the 19th century, Introduction\n\n8 would be interested to learn that they were not pioneering technologies; they were only used to copy ancient silks, needle-points, or spindle laces to create imitation stone walls and light porcelain candles. Hence, it is necessary to admire those who dared to use cast and rolled iron in construction. They were the first to revive the tradition of modernism in architecture; they are the true descendants of French cathedral builders. Therefore, Antoine-Rémy Polonceau, Henri Labrouste, and Gustave Eiffel are perhaps the fathers of the 19th-century Renaissance, rather than the charming decorators who, following John Ruskin, tried to break with the pastiche and create, first and foremost, a new style using nature as a starting point. The vision of nature, literally paraphrased and translated in the works of Émile Gallé, was not compatible with the demands of the design and the material. “A marrow,” wrote Robert de Sizeranne, “can become a library; a thistle, an office; a water lily, a ballroom. A sideboard is a synthesis; a curtain tassle, an analysis; a pair of tweezers, a symbol.” The research of something new borrowed from the poetry of nature, in breaking voluntarily with the laws of construction and past traditions, must have offended both common sense and good taste. To transpose nature into its fantasies rather than studying its laws was a mistake as grave as imitating past styles without trying to understand what they applied to. This was just the fashion of the time, but being fashionable does not constitute modernism. Reviving tradition in all its logic, but finding a new expression in the purpose of the objects and in the technical means to achieve them, which is neither in contradiction nor an imitation Jean Fouquet, Pendant, c. 1930.

How could it be that artists would remain oblivious to the latent, familiar, and universal presence of this neo-mechanisation, this vehicle for exchanges between men: steamers, engines, and planes, which ensure the domination of the continents and the seas, antennas and receivers which capture the human voice across the surface of the globe, cables which mark out roads awakened to a new life, visions of the whole world projected at high speed on cinema screens? Machines have renewed all forms of work: forests of cylinders, networks of drains, regular movements of engines. How could all this confused boiling of universal life not affect the brains of the decorators? Exhibition programme Thus, from all sides, it was an era metamorphosed by scientific progress and economic evolution, turned upside down politically and socially by the war, liberated from both anachronistic pastiche and illogical imaginings. Whilst the artist’s invention reclaimed its rightful place, machines, no longer a factor in intellectual decline through its making or distributing of counterfeit copies of beautiful materials, would permeate aesthetically original and rational creations everywhere. This world movement, however, was lacking the\n\n12 effective support and clear understanding of the public. Only these accolades would merit an exhibition. But rather than a bazaar intended to show the power of the respective production of the nations, it would have to be a presentation of excellence turned towards the future. When the Exposition internationale des Arts décoratifs et industriels modernes, or International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts – originally planned for 1916, but adjourned because of the war – was re-envisaged in 1919 by public authorities, modifications were imperative. The 1911 classification project contains only three groups: architecture, furniture, and finery. The arts of the theatre, of the streets, and the gardens, which were special sections, naturally required a new group. In its title, the new project also comprised a significant addition. The Exhibition was to be devoted to decorative and “industrial” arts; it would affirm the willingness of a close co-operation between aesthetic creation and its distribution through the powerful means of industry. Besides the manufacturers, the material suppliers were also to be given a large space, thanks to the design which inspired the presentations of 1925. “Modern” decorative art was to be presented in its entirety like an existing reality, completely suited to contemporary aesthetic and material needs. Ceramic tiles, hanging fabric wall coverings, and wallpaper – each has their reason for adorning particular spaces. The ideal mode of presentation was thus the meeting of a certain number of “modern” buildings, decorated entirely inside and out, which would be placed next to stores, post offices, and school rooms, constituting a kind of miniature city or village. Moreover, these designs had to inspire the materials they had to work with, adopted for the use of the location granted and the distribution of the works which were thoughtfully placed in their midst. That is how four principal modes of presentation were determined: in isolated pavilions, in shops, in galleries of the Esplanade des Invalides, and in the halls of the Grand Palais. The isolated pavilions, reserved for associations of artists, craftsmen, and manufacturers had to represent village and countryside homes, hotel businesses, schools, and even churches and town halls. In short, all the framework of contemporary life could be found here. Shops marked the importance attached to urban art and offered the possibility of presenting window-dressings, as well as displays, spanning one or more units. The galleries, particularly for architecture and furniture, allowed compositions connected to the Court of Trades, which were managed by the theatre and the library. They were meant to constitute the largest part of the Exhibition. At last, the interior installations of the Grand Palais were systematically categorised. The Exhibition aroused new activity long in advance, as a consequence of the emulation it caused among artists and manufacturers. The creator’s efforts were significantly encouraged by groups of “modern” minds, which grew in number and made engaging and effective propaganda. Foreign exhibitors attach no less importance than the hosts to an opportunity that would allow most countries to compare their efforts and enrich their designs. Thus, the frame of mind of the exhibition was not a centralising narrowmindedness, a formal modernism of the time. Far from imposing rigid and concrete specifications of style, the Exhibition of 1925 became apparent as an overview intended to reveal the tendencies in contemporary art, and to showcase their first achievements. The only stipulation was for it to be an ‘original production’, appropriate to the needs, universal or local, of the time. This phrase could be used to refer to any previous century, which may have only been said to be great because it was thought to be innovatory. Donald Deskey, Folding screen, c. 1930.

(pp. 16-17) All exhibitions comprised of new construction greatly credited the efforts of the architects: well-adapted to the requirements for its brief, more or less accessible and expressive, and leaving visitors with a sincere and lasting first impression. Even more so, in an exhibition devoted to decorative and industrial modern arts, architecture required the most attentive care and excited great interest. Indeed, the most utilitarian of all arts is also the most “decorative” and the most closely related to industrial progress. Decorative art is as such based on the great number of its creations. Large silhouettes of buildings are more important in the scenery of life than all other objects with which we can adorn it. Sculpture and painting can only add a little to the beauty of their already thick volumes, and will not be able to enrich their legacy, should they not have their own intrinsic nobility. As for the alliance of art with industry, architects did not wait to conclude it, the eloquent manifestos which, for almost a century, have proclaimed the need of it. Continuously in search of new materials, effective and economic construction processes, they benefit from the discoveries of science and sometimes even cause them. Lastly, having to create a framework where everything that further embellishes the pavilion finds its place and makes sense, architecture coordinates the efforts of the other arts. It should, therefore, be a source of inspiration. However, it ultimately becomes a slave to the whole, a mere shell from which a unity of expression must originate in order to create the style of its time or, more simply, the harmony of the pavilion itself. “Modern” architecture: new materials, new shapes If we understand by “modern” architecture that which profits from the successes of industry, by using the new materials and methods of construction of the time, in order to carry out their new programmes, then the Exhibition of 1900 truly marked the decline of “modernism”. In France, the 19th century, in spite of its taste for formulas borrowed from previous eras, was marked by strong and original works. Progress in metallurgy, a consequence of the development of public transport infrastructure, had drawn attention to the varied possibilities and real beauty of iron. From Henri Labrouste to Victor Baltard, and Paul Sédille to Émile André, architects used it unreservedly for the construction of public libraries, market halls, stations, department stores, and museums. With the Eiffel Tower, the Machine Gallery, and the palaces of Jean-Camille Formigé, the Exhibition of 1889 dedicated a lengthy and persevering effort to the cause. Nevertheless, eleven years later, despite a few exceptions, the retrograde tendencies dominated. Architecture, Painted and Sculpted Decor\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18 Is it necessary to recall to which point the multiple implementations of science, steam, hydraulic force, electricity, and the reciprocating engine modified the conditions of life? Must we discuss the progress of transport systems, the development of industrial and commercial enterprises, the evolution of social ideas, or how health concerns altered the way everything was viewed? By observing these causes one by one, we would find the origin of buildings whose modest beginnings aroused the admiration of previous generations and which were, in comparison, quite varied from the boldest expectations of a hundred years ago: stations, hotels, factories, department stores, housing estates, schools, public swimming pools – so many projects which, despite the many years of stagnation due to war, stimulated the imagination of architects in every country. The layout, structure, and façade of antique houses had changed; there is nothing better than a house to reveal the customs of a country and a time period. A typical house of the 1920s has various floors, distributed between tenants or landlords, of the space. The interior distribution most clearly reflected everyone’s new needs. Using thicker walls, the architect was able to provide a whole system of ducts and piping for smoke, water, gas, electricity, and steam, a vacuum system to ensure that the “rented box” became, according a very visual word, a “dwelling machine”. In the early 20th century, in all the relatively opulent buildings, the narrow old vestibule evolved into a spacious gallery, an example first exhibited by Charles Garnier. Toilets and bathrooms got bigger, often at the expense of the bedroom or the nearly obsolete living room. The dining-room and living rooms cohabit, separated by a half-wall, though still considered to be only one room. Where necessary, the number of rooms would be reduced in order to obtain, on an equal surface, some larger areas with better ventilation. Bold theorist of new architecture, CharlesÉdouard Jeanneret, better known as Le Corbusier, offers the following advice in his Manual of the Dwelling: Demand that the bathroom, fully sunlit, be one of the largest rooms in the apartment, the old living room for example. With full-length windows, opening, if possible, onto a terrace for sunbathing, a porcelain washbasin, a bath-tub, showers, and gym equipment. In the adjacent room: a walk-in wardrobe for dressing and undressing. Do not undress in your bedroom. It is not very clean and it creates a distressing disorder. Demand one big room in place of all the living rooms. If you can, put the kitchen under the roof, to avoid odours. Demand a garage for cars, bicycles, and motorbikes from your owner, one per apartment. Ask for the servants’ quarters to be on the same floor. Do not pen your servants in under the roofs. One should note that the writer of this catechism would prefer bare walls and replaces the cumbersome pieces of furniture commonly exposed to dust with wall cupboards or built-in closets. Our need for outside air and light translates in the number, shape, and dimension of bay windows, using bow- and oriel windows which increase brightness, available surface area, and also allow for enfilade views, such as those seen from old watch towers. Fake decorated plating on giant pilasters are no longer of fashion, instead, a careful study of the interior distribution of space and the height of the ceilings, so as more modern architects can seek to unite the entire construction and give life to its façade. As early as 1912, Henri Sauvage found another very original solution: Heinsbergen Decorating Company, Two designs for decorative panels for the Pantages Theater, c. 1929. Watercolour on paper.

Miami Beach. a tiered house in which no floor deprives the lower floors of air or light, where each inhabitant is at home, on his terrace which may be full of shrubs and flowers. Individual homes of cheaper construction are better suited for new experiments than large constructions built for rental purposes. At this time, one could easily have believed that because of the high price of building sites in the cities and because of the housingshortage crisis, private mansions, enclosed between houses that rise to any height, would gradually disappear. But the periphery, or the suburbs, of large cities, remains an option; cars brought inhabitants closer to the centre. The housing shortage, a consequence of the interruption of construction caused by the war, and the temporary uncertainty of the value of money determined the revival and even proliferation around major urban centres; apart from the private mansion, the word would often be considered pretentious, at least referring to the small, family house. Here, a few young architects, such as Robert Mallet-Stevens, André Lurçat, Jean-Charles Moreux, and Henri Pacon, applied, with an intransigence which often does not exclude taste, their principles of rational distribution and construction. Thanks to bay windows that span the length of a room, obscure angles are avoided. Although they banished all decoration, they were concerned about practical details which were carefully studied: interior blinds, sliding doors and windows, saving space by not having to install cumbersome shutters. Uncluttered rooms, for them, meant supreme elegance. To carry out these various projects, from large factories to small houses, the architect takes advantage of the industry’s achievements. Materials are provided to him cheaply due to more time efficient working methods. The invaluable invention of plywood, which – unlike natural wood – does not warp over large areas, offered new facilities for the execution of panelling and doors. Rolled steel, the newest innovation to come out of factories, was more lightweight and resistant than its predecessors; they are invaluable to the halls of department stores and openwork façades of commercial buildings. They are also used in houses for window joinery; metal allows more light to stream through than wood. However, iron has well-known defects. For example, it oxidises if it is not protected by a coating and it requires constant monitoring, which can be expensive to maintain. One would agree with Auguste Perret when he said: “If man were to suddenly disappear, the steel and iron buildings would not be long in following them.” Fortuitously invented in 1849 by Joseph Monnier, a gardener of Boulogne, improved by the research of Joseph-Louis Lambot, cement or reinforced concrete consists of a mixture of cement, sand, and stones coating a steel reinforcement. The stones then act as a part of the inert material, like grease-remover mixed with earth in large ceramic containers. The relationship between the ratio of steel expansion and cement allows the concrete to lengthen while following the deformations of metal without falling apart, so that, in essence, the reinforced concrete behaves like a single entity. Reinforced concrete is wellsuited for finer work. Cement hardens quickly, but it is breakable, making it better to use for posts and beams rather than hollow blocks because the works can be altered after a few days. The speed of its creation is comparable in speed to the assembly of iron frames which were prepared in advance with expensive machinery. Concrete made with clinker is less resistant to the pickaxe than granular cement and, hence, invaluable to temporary buildings. Used for roofs, floors, and partitions due to its light weight,\n\n22 it protects against heat and cold and often decreases the excessive resonance which comes with reinforced concrete constructions. The strengthened stone is a mixture of many materials, which makes it suitable for façade renovation. Whatever its varieties, this resistant material allows the fast construction of a structure in which the use of other materials might make the project more difficult and ultimately destroy it. A work thus built is an artificial monolith. It has justly been compared to the concrete buildings of Rome and Byzantium, where tensile brick framework played a role analogous to iron and concrete. The consequences of this discovery, from the point of view of construction, can well be seen: extraordinarily long lintels, long-ranging, continuous arcs made from a single piece, and strong and slender posts. The obstruction of the fulcrums is kept to a minimum much more easily than in Gothic constructions. Whilst the intersecting ribs required buttresses and flying buttresses to balance it out, the monolithic framework in reinforced concrete holds without external stays. The walls which do not support any weight but are mere partition walls, can be removed on the whim of the architect. He can replace a solid wall with a double wall to lock in an insulating air pocket. Engineers were the first to understand the part reinforced concrete could play in architecture. Anatole de Baudot, who had already preached its virtues through his teachings, employed it at the end of the 19th century at the Lycée Lakanal and the Church of Saint-Jean-de-Montmartre. He was only in the wrong to abuse narrow curves, whereas his technique was particularly suitable for rectilinear forms. Immediately after him, Charles Génuys gave reinforced concrete an increasingly important standing, in 1892 and 1898, in the factories of Armentières and Boulogne-on-Seine, in 1907, in a private mansion in Auteuil, and afterwards in his constructions for the national railway. Louis Bonnier, who implemented it in 1911 for the lintels, floors, and staircases of the school complex of the rue de Grenelle, reserving brickwork for the façades, made use of it on a large scale in 1922 and 1923 in the great nave of the swimming pool built at Butte-aux-Cailles. At the same time, Charles Plumet made the judicious choice to use it for the new metro stations. Tony Garnier who, already dreaming of reinforced concrete in the shade of the Villa Medici, was able to construct some of his grandest designs out of this material, as part of the major works of the town of Lyon. The terraces of the Lycée Jules Ferry, designed by Pacquet, are made of reinforced concrete, as are the arcs of the departure hall of Biarritz railway station by Dervaux, the cupola of the Boucherie Economique by Alfred Agache, the large roofs of the Galleries Lafayette by Chanut, and the pillars and the vaults of the Church of SaintDominique by Gaudibert. Savage used it for the framework of his house with tiered steps from the rue de Vavin and in a building on the Boulevard Raspail; Boileau, in the two basements of new the appendix of Le Bon Marché; Danis, in the framework and the staircase of the Pasteur museum in Strasbourg; Bonnemaison, in his rental properties. In the Church of Saint-Louis in Vincennes, Droz and Marrast combined it with grinding stone and brick. Inside the Church of Saint-Leon in Paris, Leon Brunet adorned it with beautifully laid out bricks. At the very moment when the Exhibition opened, Deneux started to produce the amazing framework of Rheims Cathedral consisting of 17,800 elements moulded on-site, then assembled, put up, and fitted together without the help of bolts or metal parts. As for the works of Auguste and Gustave Perret – the house of the rue Franklin (1902), the garage of the rue de Ponthieu (1905), the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées (1911-1913),\n\n23 Claude Beelman, Eastern Columbia Building, 1930. Clad in glazed turquoise terracotta tiles and copper panels. Los Angeles. the Church of Notre-Dame du Raincy, the Sainte Chapelle made of reinforced concrete (1922-1923), the tower of the Exhibition of Grenoble (1925) – all of these were built after considering the behaviour of this new material. As Paul Jamot wrote, these buildings attest “that a building which is governed solely by the systematic use of reinforced concrete, with the greatest possible savings of material and labour, [can] be beautiful in itself and, in spite of the absence of any superfluous ornament, be a work of art”. Which forms are thus born most naturally from reinforced concrete? Simple and large ones. As it lends itself to ample vaults, it especially restores to honour the horizontal line. The section of pillars gives it an austere elegance. Bases are no longer necessary as the column sticks straight out of the ground. No more capitals, as the beam and column are made from the same material. The capital, useful in the construction of foundations in order to distribute the weight of the architrave or the lintel amongst the supporting columns, became superfluous in a monolithic system. On the façades, no more horizontal projections except those of some rectangular canopies and sometimes, in order to finish the wall, the hem of a narrow frieze to underlines a distinct shadow.\n\n24 The walls are nothing but large empty surfaces. However, the reinforced concrete is well-suited for coatings. The marble panels can be fixed more firmly to it than to brick. It admits encrusted stoneware tiles, mosaics which are composed in advance at the base of the wall, stuck together with cement, the reliefs taking shape in the moulds. It offers a vast field of possibilities for the fresco. But it is by its sparse appearance, its blunt edges, by the harmony of the large areas exposed, or those hidden from the light that its most fervent supporters intend to stir our emotions. At most it is polished, in order to soften the roughness of it, or the colour is varied by ochre, grey, blue, pink, or green plastering, which seems to be a part of it. Reinforced concrete, a combination of materials, was already widely used in many countries across the globe. The Exhibition comprised, in the foreign as well as in the French section, a presentation of models, drawings and photographs of recently built works or works in the process of being built; however, its display was limited. The buildings erected for the Exhibition itself account for the greater part of Class I. To what extent does this architectural framework, where decorative arts represented real life as closely as possible, reflect contemporary architecture? There was no revelation comparable with those built for the Exposition Universelle of 1889, works like the Eiffel Tower and the Gallerie des Machines (Machinery Hall). However, there were many examples of intelligence, knowledge, ingenuity, talent, a serious understanding of the art of building, a deep sensitivity, and a sober taste, which revealed a progression of trends over the previous twenty or twenty-five years. To judge these buildings equitably, it is initially necessary to take into account the conditions imposed. A house of more than one storey does not lend itself easily to the flow of the crowd. A pavilion anticipates it: hence a certain width of doors and passages, and an increased number of buildings (without ceasing to be accessible), yet keeping some of the mystery through pricking curiosity as to what lay behind the closed façades. Others, such as the houses of the former Soviet Union, and the factories of Copenhagen, Limoges, the Grand Maison de Blanc department store, and the Diamanteries, attracted the public with their outside windows, Pierre Patout, Hôtel d’un Collectionneur, at the 1925 Paris Exhibition, with its frieze La Danse, by Joseph Bernard, above the porch.

Particular constraints, such as limiting the architects’ freedom, put their talent to the test. At the entrance of the Esplanade des Invalides, an underground station prohibited the digging of the ground deep below the surface. It is important to note that the architect Pierre Patout managed to balance the pylons of the monumental Porte de la Concorde without the help of foundations, whereas Boileau and Sauvage had to distribute the weight of both of the pavilions of Le Bon Marché and Le Printemps on four of the cast iron columns of the station of Les Invalides. Various metals were implemented. The woodwork apparent on the Japanese pavilion contributed to its particular appearance, as with the elegant windows of the pavilion of the Manufacturers of Copenhagen, built with wooden planks, rafters, pine battens, and the Sabot – or clog – maker’s house, a work by Gabriel Guillemonat. Brickwork characterised the typical houses of the north-eastern French towns of Roubaix and Tourcoing, along with those of Denmark and the Netherlands, and lastly those of Italy – to which the brick owed its blond colour. Stonework was represented, with infinite artistic talent, by the model that the School of the Paris employers’ federation of building, cement, and reinforced concrete contractors had carried out and displayed in the “teaching” group, according to the drawings of Pierre Paquet. This model of a pavilion, dedicated to rest in a sea of leisure, was so well studied and carried out stone by stone to such perfection, that it was worth building to scale. In the library, a clad iron ceiling shed a generous light on the books. In the domed vestibule of the pavilion of Nancy, the architects had achieved a decorative effect from the steel elements and connecting rivets. On the lintels of the covered walkway of the Esplanade des Invalides, Charles Plumet left the iron beams exposed, acting as both a structural component and decoration. Plaster naturally played a great part. Maurice Dufrêne deserves credit for acknowledging this material frankly in the shops of the Alexandre III Bridge. In the construction of the Théâtre des ChampsÉlysées, Auguste Perret was clearly biased in favour of temporary materials: timber posts supporting a reinforced concrete frame, with a timber frame on the inside, and coated with thick plaster. On the whole, reinforced concrete dominated the event. Entire constructions, such as the tourist information pavilion or the rest stop pavilion for automobile drivers owed their lines to it. Others borrowed their entire framework from it, like, for example, the pavilion of the Netherlands whose unexpected lighting would have been impossible to realise without its contribution. Elsewhere, architects had been content with imitations of precarious material, forgetting that reinforced concrete is not necessarily blocky and can assume, on the contrary, a certain elegance. Even if the Exhibition did not help the new concept of construction progress on a technical level, the date is marked in the history of its diffusion. It accustomed the eyes to its bold spans, its simple shapes, and its large cantilever overhangs. It established its recognition. At the beginning of the 20th century, there were many attacks against the decorative arts. At the dawn of the last century, architects and decorators took liberties with decorative fantasy. They claimed to have based their style on the visual development of themes borrowed from flora or on the use of sinuous lines which they imposed on pieces of furniture as well as on houses, stone, wood, and metal. A backlash was inevitable.\n\n28 As people had grown accustomed to the bare beauty of machines, the reaction had the character of a puritan reform. A well-known manifesto of the Austrian architect Adolphe Loos, Ornament and Crime, became the bible for a whole group of young artists. “The ornament of an ordinary object,” Loos essentially said, “is, like tattooing, a sign of cruelty or degeneration. It is a criminal waste of time, money, and energy.” Loos foretells of a civilisation where “the streets of the cities will shine out like large, very white walls”. In general, the architects estimated that discrete decoration, judiciously placed and carried out tastefully, would animate and enrich the materials. The beauty of the bare parts must be appreciated, as they, themselves, give all their value to the decorated parts. It is, however, necessary that the architect remains the authorising director. The direct submission of the painter, sculptor, and designer to the architect of the piece was one of the major features of the 1925 Exhibition. The fashionable decoration at the Exhibition has often been described as cubist. In truth, in 1925, authentic cubes or at least simple shapes, with flat surfaces were seen: those of reinforced concrete constructions and plywood pieces of furniture. But they did not owe Braque or Picasso anything. In order to understand the beauty of the bare masses, architects and cabinet-makers had not awaited the revelation of which some amateur critics had been the noisy heralds. Cubism was hardly represented at the Exhibition, at least not in the paintings decorating the architectural compositions, except for two works placed in the hall of the embassy. One, a work of Fernand Léger, juxtaposed geometrical surfaces illuminated by pure colours spread out flat. The other, shimmering with colour, was entitled La Ville de Paris, or the City of Paris. Robert Delaunay had painted the Eiffel Tower and a lady, Louis-Hippolyte Boileau, Pomone pavilion for Bon Marché at the 1925 Paris Exhibition.\n\n29 Joseph Hiriart, Georges Tribout and Georges Beau, La Maîtrise pavilion for Galeries Lafayette at the 1925 Paris Exhibition. barely clothed, on the Pont de la Concorde. Whatever one might think of the outcome obtained in painting and sculpture by Picasso, Braque, and their disciples, it is certain that their formula contributed to develop the decorators’ taste for broken lines and abstracted decoration, far from living nature. Tired of curves and having exhausted the joys of a timid naturalism and of the stylisations of flora and fauna, which their precursors had abused, the decorators of 1925 took pleasure in a capricious geometry which had nothing to do with science. The decoration on the monumental entrances of the place de la Concorde – in the lowreliefs intelligently composed by the Martel brothers for the pylons and the pedestal of the statue named L’Accueil, or Reception, – announced the union of art and industry. It could be found in the pavilion of Le Bon Marché (department store), of L’Intransigeant (daily newspaper), of Christofle (silverware), and Baccarat (crystal ware), and in a great number of kiosks. In response to the sensitivity of a generation who, in art, flee away from details and prefer the essence, this fashion resulting from Cubism remains a simple decorative convention. In theory, sculpture was only allowed at the Exhibition as long as it was a part of an architectural piece, hence the considerable number of low-reliefs. However, without taking into account the fountains, such as those of Max Blondat, Christofle, Marcel Loyau, and Naoum Aronson, statues and groups decorated the gardens, or the entrances to the buildings. This broad interpretation of the regulations made it possible to admire, close to the pavilion of the General Commissioner, a nude figure of a sovereign eurhythmy by Despiau, calm without being inert and, in addition, in an alcove of the Bernheim Jeune pavilion, a splendidly full-figured bronze nude by Maillot: both variations on an age-old theme, but nevertheless “modern” works due to the originality of vision.\n\n30 Despite the subordination of sculptures in the round and low-reliefs to their architectural units, the Exhibition offered a rather exact image of the current state of sculpture in France. From sculpture which only stirs emotions through its lively profiles and its rhythmic outlines, to that which has the ambition to express ideas, and from the most traditional to the most paradoxical, every trend has its defenders. In the foreign sections, sculpture could not be represented in a complete state to qualify it for an overall judgement. We will focus later, within their respective sections, on capital works such as those of Mateo Hernandez of Spain, Henryk Kuna of Poland, Ivar Johnson and Carl Milles of Sweden, as well as Jean Stursa of the former Czechoslovakia. In spite of the theories, sculpture is protected from any dangerous concern, because of the requirements of the profession which demands complete clarity of form. With fewer constraints, the painter can suggest more than he can express, can be more pleasing with a range of tones, and more charming with promises that may or may not be kept. Whilst sculpture has remained healthy and robust, painting underwent a significant crisis which was revealed by the Exhibition. This explains why the walls of the Court of Trades were not offered to the most original champions of young French painting. It is by paintings of restricted size exhibited in certain furniture units or in the pavilion Bernheim Jeune that their talent could be judged. In the years leading up to the Exhibition, a renaissance of the fresco was witnessed. Paul Baudouin, disciple and friend of Symbolist painter Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, showed that frescos can survive as well under a wet sky as in a dry climate, if the painting materials are judiciously chosen and if the wall is preserved with saltpetre. The failure of many attempts made in France, in the first half of the 19th century, is due only to poor technique. It is known that painting with fresco, known from the Greeks and the Romans, and with so many masterpieces produced in Italy and in medieval France, consists of spreading colours diluted in water over a fresh plaster of faded lime and fine sand. Fixed on this mortar they become, whilst drying, as hard as the wall itself. The fresco, which requires prompt execution, is therefore a school of decision and, consequently, of reflection. The fresco painter has no time to either hesitate or get bogged down in the meticulousness of details. His composition must be finalised beforehand, then carried out on a large scale. It is also a school of simplicity, because lime admits only a restricted number of colours. Since the example of Paul Baudouin, the fresco already produced remarkable works: the splendid ensemble by Bourdelle at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, the compositions of Marcel Lenoir at the seminar of Toulouse, heavy, systematic, but truly powerful, those of Caro Delvaille, those of Henry Marret, in particular in the Church of Saint-Louis de Vincennes. It seems that this technique must benefit from the appreciation of large flat surfaces, and it must offer reinforced concrete – a material of a rather poor appearance, or with asbestos cement (a substrate used by Marret), a suitable decoration for it. It was a significant part of the Exhibition, particularly in the French section. The French section Reinforced concrete and its derivatives played such a large part in the Exhibition that a classification based on the implemented materials would not ensure a clearer approach.

Aurora, Illinois. It would be better to look at the achievements of the various projects, starting with the section’s over plans. The French section comprised two main areas, almost perpendicular to each other: one of them marked by the Seine between the Pont de la Concorde and the Alma Bridge, the other one, leading alongside the Avenue Nicolas II, the Alexandre III Bridge, and the alley bisecting the section cutting across the Esplanade des Invalides from north to south. On the quays of the right bank of the river and the Cours-la-Reine, the visitor would successively encounter the foreign and the French pavilions, then the French Village and the colonial pavilions. On the left bank, some more pavilions, miniature toys presented in a model village, the transport gallery, and the amusement park. On the Esplanade, symmetry and variety, order and life, obtained by an extremely considered arrangement of buildings, predominantly assigned to France. Lastly, in order to connect the two parts of the Exhibition separated by the Seine and for fear the public would not be tempted to cross from one bank to the other under the summer sun, the Alexandre III Bridge was transformed, from two lines of shops into a kind of Rialto. It was, like certain bridges of the Middle Ages, a street spanning a river. Dictated by the terrain itself, the general plan mapped out by Charles Plumet left nothing to be desired in terms of clarity. The chief architect had focused his main effort on the Esplanade des Invalides. Two contrasting but essential considerations presented themselves: to assure that the splendid view of the dome was not inhibited, but nevertheless avoid the monotony of a long, ordinary avenue. The available space was divided into two parts of unequal length, separated by the two twin pavilions of the Sèvres factory. In the first one, close to the Seine, two galleries masked the entry and the exit of the underground station of Les Invalides. One was dedicated to sumptuous boutiques: Henry Sauvage had created there a striking orchestration of black, red, and gold. The other one, reserved for the foreign sections, had been built in a simple and practical way by Leon Gaudibert and Julien Polti and decorated with discrete paintings by the decorator Camille Boignard. Between these two galleries, twelve buildings of ranging importance formed, bordering a garden, a first unit where, wedged in the four corners, four pavilions intended for the department stores stood. The second unit comprised ten pavilions facing each other in a line along the side of the central walkway. As with the latter, it was fenced in on the right and left sides by galleries. A covered promenade skirted them, connecting them to four imposing corner towers and curved around to end at the entrance hall of the Court of Trades. To avoid a repeat of the disorder of previous exhibitions, with an excess and confusion of shadows, the façades of the pavilions were not to exceed a height restriction of 16 feet. This white herd would have been monotonous without some dominant constructions, giving rhythm to the composition. Hence, the towers of Charles Plumet were created, evidently, out of a decorative need. By assigning them as restaurants where one could enjoy the products of four provinces of France, the architect was not unaware that he was exposing himself to criticism for having exalted culinary art in an exhibition dedicated to decorative art in the most important buildings in the ensemble. But he remembered the attraction of American restaurants located on the upper floors of a skyscraper. What to place in these lookouts, if not a place for weary visitors to rest, allowing them to associate the delights of the table with the sight of an urban landscape?\n\n36 Once this project was adopted, Plumet carried it out with logic. On the ground floor of each tower, a hall lit by high glass walls was used as a vestibule by the galleries adjacent to the exhibition. In the four corners, octagonal turrets neatly housed staircases and elevators. Above the hall, a service floor, then the dining area, enlarged by four projecting storeys from where the view stretched out as far as the eye could see. Each of them was supported by four impressive columns; between which lead to the kitchens and other services. Such an arrangement of supports was a concession to usual visual expectations. The whole construction was in clinker concrete, less solid than ballast concrete, which facilitated a future demolition. The projecting porches, simply carved, were made of reinforced stone and plywood, which lends itself to restoration works. The Court of Trades was made of the same materials and presented, for a very different project, similar qualities: a low construction along the main road of the Esplanade and the dome and a refuge for meditation at ground level. The hall, flanked by two porches whose turrets mirrored those of the towers, connected at the same level with the covered walkway of the Esplanade. However, its linked pillars, without bases but widened at their top by a discrete cushion capital and with a deliberate transition between the eight columns and the lintels, indicated a greater search for elegance. Largely open, like that of the Grand Trianon, but without a curved courtyard, it owed its character to the harmony of the proportions and to the simple decoration obtained by the apparent gaps between beams and joists, with a clearly exposed firmness of the lines. As for the Court itself, it was a more modern cloister without columns or pillars, surrounding a geometrical garden with a fountain at its centre. To offer a discrete setting for the paintings and sculptures, Plumet had simply divided up the awning by the stark, projecting reinforcements. Three constructions were closely related to the composition designed for the Esplanade des Invalides: the library and the theatre which flanked the Court of Trades symmetrically and the twin pavilions of Sèvres, built across from each other on the main road. The library, a work of Paul Huillard, could have had the longer, yet more precise name of “showroom of the art of the book”. Readers were not envisaged there, nor their tables, their seats, the quiet atmosphere conducive to their studies, or the shelves for stacking the books. It was not a typical library. But in its hall with its visible framework and few supports, under the light which shone through the broad bay windows at the upper part of the walls, printed pages, engravings, and bindings were presented under the most favourable conditions. The theatre of the Perret brothers and Granet was precisely admired for its elegance at the same time as being “novel and natural”. Architects, such as Paul Jamot, had proposed to create, in the most simple and most economical way possible, “a meeting and contact place between drama and the public”. As at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, the room was arranged in such way that from of every seat, the spectator could easily see the whole scene. Built on a square plan, its architecture encroached on the stage which, divided into three parts by two columns, lent itself to multiple scene layouts. Great care had been taken with the lighting. It fell from a glass ceiling, where the light, of many different colours, was diffused without visible hearth and could enrich the silver-grey rendering with the finest gold. A gallery for electricity, to aid the monitoring, removed “the miserable installation of projectors in the middle of the public”. Placed directly below the ceiling, all around the room, it constituted at the same time the best kind of decoration – Wirt Rowland, Smith, Hinchman & Grylls Associates Inc. and Thomas di Lorenzo, Guardian (or Union Trust) Building, entrance hall, 1929.

Detroit.\n\n38 Herman Sachs, Spirit of Transportation, ceiling of the entrance hall of the Bullocks Wilshire building, 1929. Los Angeles.\n\n39\n\n40\n\n41 one that fulfils a purpose. The same intelligence went into the construction process. For an ephemeral building, Auguste Perret had only implemented expensive and durable materials when they were proven to be warranted. He had taken care not to forget that the humble fir tree has the same compressive strength (40 kilograms per square centimetre) as the hardest concrete. Thirty-four wooden posts, transformed by a coating onto grooved columns, supported a reinforced concrete frame. The ceiling rested on steel beams. The architect had laid out his posts in pairs: some stood within the room, others, visible from the outside, were formed against the bare wall to which a coating of a lithogenic, or stoneforming, component was used to create the texture of stone, a far-reaching colonnade corresponding exactly to the interior framework. The peristyle decor, the main room, artists’ dressing rooms, lighting and monitoring gallery – the whole composition, viewed clearly from the outside, conferred a lively appearance to the very simple façade. Below the cornice there was a continuous frieze of narrow cylinders. This frieze, also visible from inside the room, was not part of the decoration, rather it formed a mechanical ventilation device made of a succession of half-pipes encased one inside the other, and which, in letting the air pass, intercepted the light. In the pavilions and garden of the Sèvres factory, Patout’s subtle art and his taste for contrasts and theatrical effects could be found. Eight colossal seven-metre tall vases, made from concrete reinforced with wood, and covered with sandstone tiles, constituted an apogee of great allure. Close to them, the low white pavilions which faced each other and were reflected in mirror-like water with blue edges, the garden, surrounded by small square plinths which connected the festoons, full of refinement and delicacy. The pavilions were made of reinforced stone, covered with sandstone until halfway-up. No window punctuated the façade, so that no wall’s inside surface was lost for the presentation of objects. The light came from the ceiling. It was a simple and expressive project of a homogeneous composition, despite its division into two parts, imposed by the site. The goal was to highlight ceramic as a resource for the interior or exterior decoration of the house and for the decoration of a garden. This goal was achieved. Good architecture is made from the inside out. The internal plan of the Exhibition determined the place, the importance, and the character of the doors. Two of the most important ones were situated at the end of the two main thoroughfares and opened up for the visitor coming from the centre of the city. At a time when the barriers fall, when the exchanges of all kinds multiply, does not the phrase “monumental gate” awaken more than a vague idea? In fact, they were not the gates of cities, but the gates of an exhibition. Since an enclosure had been traced, it was necessary to create gates to get in and get out. For all of them, the same strategy was adopted: the entrance on the sides where the visitors waited in lines, the exit in the middle where they could come and go without obstruction, side-by-side, in small groups. The Gate of Honour opened onto the Avenue Nicolas II. Let us imagine it as we would have seen it if the projects of the architects Henri Favier and André Ventre had been carried out with permanent materials. Arranged two by two, sixteen polished granite pylons connected by openwork grids and pressed metal friezes were strongly drawn up in the plan. Bronze basins stood on them from which neon-illuminated glass flowed at night. Carried out by means of iron ribbons passed through the rolling mill, then cut, curved, and assembled in patterns of water jets which were repeated in staggered rows; the grids were to prove that the machine, John Wenrich, The RCA Building, exterior views, c. 1931. Ink, pastel, and gouache on paper. RCA Building (now the GE Building), Rockefeller Center, New York.\n\n42 subjected to human intelligence, can create beauty as well as the hand, just more economically. In fact, these materials and this work were imitated in shiny plaster. The visitor was only to assess what was in front of him as full-scale mock-up. But we could admire the elegance of the silhouettes, the equal distribution of the framework and the openwork panels, the welcoming appearance of the whole which, although starting out with a wide angled frame, gradually narrowed, guiding the visitor and his view towards the centre of the Exhibition. Favier and Ventre only had to raise a gate spanning an avenue lined with constructions to house exhibits. More complex was the problem Patout had to deal with at the entrance of the Cours-la-Reine. Obliged to treat the trees with care and to only use the gaps between their main branches, he was required to build constructions high enough to attract attention from far away and stable enough to resist the wind, but without being able to use foundations; moreover he had to take into account the fact that the gate was shaped like a spire, that could be seen from different directions. He thus arranged his piece in a circle, the only non-deformable figure: ten square columns, crowned with basins out of which beams of light would spout. Between these pylons, the outgoing flow of visitors would go out, leaving in all directions. The entrances were to the right and to the left: four lines, arranged in a circle of square bases, connected by chains, channelled the crowd towards the turnstiles. Each pylon measured 72 feet in height, 11 and a half feet in width and weighed approximately 100 metric tons. They were built out of reinforced clinker concrete. Their walls, three inches thick, were coated on the outside in a lime mortar. An open door located nearly ten feet above the ground, and a hook-on ladder placed on the inside, gave access to the top to service the lighting. Due to the impossibility of digging the ground because of the sewers, of the tramlines, the gas and water pipes, and the electric cables; Patout had built some of the pylons on reinforced concrete bridges, others on concrete plinths or stone slabs which distributed the load in low pressure over the loose ground. Lastly, to ensure their stability, he ballasted them at the base by piling up paving stones between their walls to a height of ten feet above the ground. Despite being very interesting from the point of view of the technical challenges, with simple lines, and an original and well-conceived design in order to catch the eye from afar, the merits of the work were, however, much discussed. We acknowledge the fact that, on one point, the criticism is deserved, specifically on what was not done. At certain times, a door must be closed, even if it is called “monumental entrance”. However, no means of closure having been planned, it was necessary, in order to comply with the rules of the customs warehouses, to put up a wooden barrier with full doors behind the pylons, of little monumental effect. The architect was not to blame for having disturbed the peace of the beautiful decor to which many eyes were accustomed. Any other construction in a new style, in its place, would also undoubtedly have appeared just as discordant. Another gate, the third most important, gave a merry welcome to the crowd: the Porte d’Orsay, built from the designs of the architect Boileau. Its two pillars, with a geometric design, supported a large beam on which a decorated metal banner was suspended, on one side with large typeface, on the other by a semi-cubist painting by Voguet. However, the visitor, passing under this banner,\n\n43 Arthur E. Harvey, Spring Arts Tower, terracotta and black and enamelled gold cladding (detail), 1931. Spring Arts Tower (formerly the headquarters of the Crocker National Bank), Los Angeles. did not get the impression of a “sword of Damocles” because the banner was hidden from him by a circular plate which connected the two pillars, 11 feet above the ground, which sheltered the turnstiles of the rain and the sun. The four symmetrical gates of the Rue de Constantine and Rue Fabert, works of Lucien Woog, Pierre Ferret, Marrast, and Herscher, were used at the same time as entrances to the Exhibition and galleries: hence their deep porches and pylon surrounding. At the site of the Victor-Emmanuel-III, Albert I, and Grenelle gates, the architects Guidetti, Adolphe Thiers, and Levard carried out a project already simple in itself with further simplicity. Located near the Gate of Honour is the tourist information pavilion. In spite of its rather strange design, it comprised an element which, as with the pylons, served only to attract visitors. It was a kind of tower, or rather mast, formed by two thin walls with sharp edges, coated with a rough mortar, and cut at right angles. It housed, at a height of a little over 100 feet, the rectangular case of an electric clock, the elegant and spiritual nature of a sculptor as much as of an architect. If the small canopies of the clock case could be louvres, three small planks of concrete placed horizontally and equidistant of one another, the one below seemed to have no other purpose but to create recalls of forms, contrasts of light and shade: a decoration in the same capacity as the garlands of the past but of a more severe aspect.\n\n44 This new type of mast had four vertical posts of reinforced concrete as its framework, connected by beams forming standoffs, with the space between them which was bricked up. They went down 21 feet below the ground where they drowned into a reinforced concrete footing. Thus, the lowering of the centre of gravity had ensured the stability of the ensemble. In the hall, the entrance of which was announced by this mast, Mallet-Stevens used reinforced concrete with such skill, but without compromising the decoration. The work could not have been better conceived to suit its purpose. Outside, there was an almost full and rather mysterious wall. Inside, a room, 66 feet long, surrounded by exchange and information services. The great light which lit them up fell from the ceiling and poured through stained glass windows, set in a bay window which measured only 20 inches in height, but which circled the whole hall with a continuous band of images of the most beautiful monuments of France toppling over one another, like scenery whizzing past the window of a car travelling at top speed. The part of the wall which surmounted this translucent frieze seemed, paradoxically, to be leaning on it. In fact, it was supported by strong reinforced concrete beams, placed on pillars so thin that one did not notice their presence. Pavilions of cities or regions, of department stores, of an individual or a group in the French section numbered around a hundred. On one of the sites, under the shade of the Champs-Élysées and decorated with flowers, Paris wanted to exhibit the work of its schoolchildren. Two long, symmetrical, robust, and elegant wings were connected by a hall which was used as a reception room for the Municipal Council. Full and empty, projections and recesses were learnedly balanced by the architect Roger Bouvard. Each wing ended in a three-part projection, pierced by three high bays. This semi-hexagonal form which was repeated, high up, at the crowning of each window, showed firm lines without stiffness. With the ceramics vases which decorated the front steps and the stuccomarble frieze which was located under the cornice, this Trianon of schoolchildren was brightened by a discrete polychromy. The pavilions built for other cities raised the very delicate question of regionalism in architecture. Undoubtedly the walls were the same, though the same roofs are not suitable for different terrains or different climates like the ones of Brittany, Alsace, Picardy, or Provence. But local traditions, reflected in the style of building, are also due to habits, ways of life, working methods which were no longer valid. In a centralised country, in a time when the progress of the means of transport shortened distances, these traditions disappear. Isn’t the architect who maintains them, with a tenderness for the past, likely to create an anachronistic decoration? At the Exhibition, the problem became even more complicated. The aim was to present, under favourable conditions, various productions in the area of arts, born in such or such a region, but intended for many others. Were they not settling for an easy picturesque style, which puts them in a category from before they were born? A few architects deliberately freed themselves from local traditions. Rather, they built for cities whose characters were not so strongly marked. In the pavilions of Lyon, Nancy, and Limoges, there was nothing particularly typical. On the contrary, Mulhouse, Roubaix and Tourcoing, the Alpes-Maritimes, Normandy, Berry, Alsace, and Brittany invited the visitor on a tour of the provinces. The long blind façade of the pavilion of Lyon and Saint-Etienne, its three-tiered octagonal crowning, with 120 windows, reminded the visitor of Tony Garnier’s fancy for grand-scale works.

But the powerful city, which was at the cutting edge of French urban design, offered a vast space to the talent of its architect. He seemed to be cramped with the meagre portion of the Esplanade des Invalides allotted to him. The building, well laid out, seemed to be designed for greater dimensions. Of equal surface area, the pavilion of Nancy and the East, work of Jean Bourgon and Pierre Le Bourgeois, was less original, but of a more satisfactory scale. Its flattened dome on top of an octagonal tambour crowned a steel hall. The rectangular bay windows of its wings would illuminate a conference room and auditorium on one side and a museum of the region of Lorraine on the other. Everything, up to the frieze of the entrance, screamed for a propaganda and information office for the Eastern regions. Under the trees of the Cours-la-Reine sat the pavilion of Limoges, by Pierre Chabrol, which had a vast shop window of harmonious proportions where enamels and the porcelains shimmered of their own will. One can find, in the camp of picturesque portrayals of the regions,\n\n48 capped with three floors of attic windows, the highly-steeped, sloping roof designed by André Ventre and Jean Launay, architects of the pavilion of Mulhouse. On the walls, reinforced concrete beams replaced the old timber frame. In composing the pavilion of Roubaix and Tourcoing, De Feure remembered the brick frontages and tiered gables of the North of France. The pavilion-smallholding of Berry-Nivernais by Gauchery and Dreyer, the “Clos Normand”, or enclosed flower garden, by Victorien Lelong and Pierre Chirol, and the pavilion of Franche-Comté by Boutterin all showcased beautiful framework. The traditional farmhouse of Provence by Dallest, Castel, and Tournon, and the delightful pavilion of the Alpes-Maritimes of Charles and Marcel Dalmas could, on rare occasion, give the illusion of this privileged land where the rough-cast ochre or pink walls, the Genoese roof cornices, and the terraces with tiled balustrades form, along with large flowered earthenware jars, the most pleasant decoration. Why were there, at the entrance of the Village, two pavilions to represent Alsace? This is, Raymond Régamey tells us, because of two different concepts of regionalism, one narrower, the other one broader, which divide Alsatian architects. Eugene Haug, in the House of Alsace, was forced to make some changes to this residence that would previously have pleased his German neighbours. Théo Berst, on the contrary, creator of the pavilion of Art in Alsace, did not fear these alterations. He had faith in reinforced concrete. The obligation to fit a public passage under the country house that he had designed, had given him the idea of building external staircases reminiscent of those we sometimes see in his homeland. But he had given up on the projecting storey and on gables protected by flat, tiled canopies, as they seemed a little misplaced in Paris. At the other end of the Village, high slate roofs, white rendering, paved granite kerbs: it was the massive House of Brittany, somewhat modernised, built by Vaugeois. The painter Lemordant, the ardent organiser of the work, had arranged for it to house an exhibition gallery. The local characteristics of materials, forms, and colours appeared even better in the colonial pavilions. One mainly noticed the large hall with carved wooden columns of IndoChina, the white patios enhanced with green and blue ceramics of North Africa, the massive buildings of red stone coming from the beginning of time, and the dome of the palace of French Western Africa, built by Germain Olivier, which bristled with threatening spikes. Let us return to the constructions which best epitomised 1925. Few projects were more “modern” than that of a pavilion of a department store. There, a certain outward shine and gloss is appropriate: it contributes to publicity. Hence, let us not reproach the luxury of stained glass and marble of such or such a pavilion, or another its cement with gold niello accents, its columns, its roof dotted with pebbles of moulded glass which illuminated the night. Let us note the variety of solutions brought to the same challenges: the use of octagonal rooms of the same dimensions, the same size pavilions, and ease of circulation. All four comprised of a central hall, the axis around which radiated largely open rooms. All four of them used floral decoration to a great extent. But, what a differences in appearance! The pavilion of Le Bon Marché, a work of Boileau, glows like a piece of rock crystal. Projections jutted out from the outside of the rooms. The top was tiered. Two projecting porches, containing the up and down staircases, Auguste Lazo, Tile with Mayan motifs, 1928. Stoneware. John P. Axelrod Collection, Boston. Courtesy of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.
