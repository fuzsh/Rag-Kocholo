        "text": "Angelina Beloff Mexican artist\n\n0 0\n\nAngelina Beloff (born Angelina Petrovna Belova; Russian: Ангелина Петровна Белова; June 23, 1879 – December 30, 1969) was a Russian-born artist who did most of her work in Mexico. However, she is better known as Diego Rivera’s first wife, and her work has been overshadowed by his and that of his later wives. She studied art in Saint Petersburg and then went to begin her art career in Paris in 1909. This same year she met Rivera and married him. In 1921, Rivera returned to Mexico, leaving Beloff behind and divorcing her. She never remarried. In 1932, through her contacts with various Mexican artists, she was sponsored to live and work in the country. She worked as an art teacher, a marionette show creator and had a number of exhibits of her work in the 1950s. Most of her work was done in Mexico, using Mexican imagery, but her artistic style remained European. In 1978, writer Elena Poniatowska wrote a novel based on her life.\n\n20th-century Mexican women artists · 79T\n\n19th-century Mexican women artists · 1T\n\nRussian women sculptors · 10T\n\nVladimir Tatlin Russian artist\n\n0 0\n\nrank #4 ·\n\nVladimir Tatlin (28 December [O.S. 16 December] 1885 – 31 May 1953) was a Russian and Soviet painter, architect and stage-designer.
