Opening times are: 09h00 to 16h30 seven days a week.\n\nGood Luck. Enjoy the hunt. There may be times when muggle activity nearby is high, use stealth. If security is patrolling within sight of the final cache, please do not compromise it. Rather wait for them to move off. Please ensure that all containers are sealed properly when replaced. Also, please ensure that the cache is well hidden and is not left exposed when you leave. You can also attempt the other cache nearby - G6 (GCVR5D). Entrance payable.\n\nThe Memorial was once known as the Rand Regiments Memorial - and pejoratively as the Khaki Monument. The Anglo Boer War Memorial is now dedicated to all those who lost their lives in the war of 1899 to 1902. It has international significance, as many countries were involved in the battles in the war in South Africa. Described by architect and writer Clive Chipkin in his book Johannesburg Style as Edwin Luytens' \"great arc de triomphe\", the memorial is a 20m tall stone four-arched structure, with a large bronze Angel of Peace standing majestically on top. Johannesburg's premier war monument, it is significant to all South Africans.\n\nIt began, however, as exclusive and divisive, dedicated solely to the memory of the men of the Rand who died for the British Empire during the Anglo Boer War. In 1999, however, it was conscripted into the service of national unity by its rededication to all those who lost their lives in that war. In reality, it is significant to more than just South Africans, as many nations were involved.\n\nShortly after the Anglo Boer War, Randlord Sir Lionel Phillips - whose wife started the collections that led to the Johannesburg Art Gallery, housed in a building also designed by Luytens, the British colonial architect - and others suggested a memorial to commemorate the British soldiers who had died in the conflict. The town council felt that such a memorial should be a peace monument to foster reconciliation, commemorating those on both sides who had died, regardless of nationality. Phillips and the memorial committee did not agree, however; the memorial held little relevance for those who had identified with the Boer side in the conflict, and was derided as \"Die Khaki Monument\".\n\nIt's location was originally suggested by Sir Percy Lane, the director of the Dublin Art Gallery and a personal friend of Lady Florence Phillips. In October 1910, Phillips committed his firm, H Eckstein and Co, to the purchase of 40 acres of the Sachsenwald Park (now Saxonwold), to be donated for the construction of the memorial. The town council agreed to lay out the five vistas to the memorial and to fence off the 40 acres. Phillips paid for the Angel of Peace out of his own pocket, as his gift to the citizens of Johannesburg. It was designed by the Russian sculptor, Naoum Aronson.\n\nPartly because of its one-sided dedication, the town council distanced itself from the project, and the monument was largely neglected. The grounds and vistas surrounding it were gradually encroached upon by the neighbouring zoo. The five vistas leading to the monument have largely been engulfed, and the only one that is still obvious is the avenue looking west from the memorial down into the zoo. In 1999, it was decided that the memorial needed to consider all those who had died in the war. The site was re-dedicated on 10 October of that year to \"the memory of the men, women and children of all races and all nations who lost their lives in the Anglo Boer War, 1899-1902\". Emphasis was placed on the role played by black South Africans during the war, an aspect which had previously had little recognition."
