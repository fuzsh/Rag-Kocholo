Like Naoum Aronson and Antoine Bourdelle Parisian sculptor Pierre FÃ©lix Fix-Masseau depicted Ludwig van Beethoven as an introverted person, living in his own world. This interpretation is emphasised by the Beethoven bust having the eyes closed.

All in all, the sculpture has a peaceful effect and clearly features elements of classical portrait plastics of the 19th century. However, the rather unusual way of holding the hands and the strong effect of the finely moulded surface details is quite different from earlier sculptures. At the same time, the artist shows a special interest in rendering surface textures and details particularly lively. His intention was mainly to create an individual yet pleasant portrait of Beethoven.(S.B.)
