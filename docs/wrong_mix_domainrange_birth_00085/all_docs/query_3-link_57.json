        "text": "Friday, August 2 | 7:00 PM\n\nNot long before the making of their new album Ooh La La, Guster celebrated three decades together as a band — a journey that's included landing a series of hits on the Billboard charts, working with luminaries like Steve Lillywhite and Richard Swift, launching their own music festival, and amassing an ardent fanbase partly on the strength of their relentless touring and deeply communal live show. But despite reaching a milestone few musical acts ever come close to attaining, Guster's ninth studio LP reveals a band fully in touch with the voracious creative energy that first inspired their formation. A major leap forward for lead vocalist Ryan Miller, guitarist Adam Gardner, drummer Brian Rosenworcel, and multi-instrumentalist Luke Reynolds, Ooh La La ultimately matches that wide-eyed spirit with a newly heightened sense of confidence, conviction, and commitment to the raw sincerity that's made them so beloved.\n\n\"In all the time we've been together we've never really felt our age as a band — we're still so hungry, still excited to create,\" says Gardner. \"A lot of people have told us they're amazed at how democratic our process is, but I think that's a big part of why we're still able to open up this space where the ideas just flow. It also helps that we've built a relationship with our fans where there's a real sense of trust and a desire for us to keep growing and keep pushing ourselves. It's such a gift that allows us to be truly free, and to make whatever music we want to make.\"\n\nAll the Good Times: the Farewell Tour\n\nwith very special guest Jerry Douglas\n\nSaturday, August 10 | 7:00 PM\n\nFor nearly six decades, the three-time GRAMMY® Award-winning Nitty Gritty Dirt Band has entertained audiences with their top-shelf musicianship and timeless hits. Now the time has come for the band who has carried a torch for American country and roots music to say so long to the highways and byways they’ve crossed an unimaginable number of times throughout their career.\n\nOn March 21st, 2024, the Dirt Band will kick off the first leg of their last traditionally scheduled gigs, ALL THE GOOD TIMES: The Farewell Tour. This isn’t goodbye forever, but it will be the last fans see of multi-city runs and long bus rides. These special shows will celebrate the music created by the legendary, yet ever-evolving NGDB.\n\nMany veteran bands trade on nostalgia, on replication of past glories, and on recycled emotions from younger, more carefree days.\n\nThe Nitty Gritty Dirt Band trades on a mix of reimagined classics and compelling newer works. The group formed in 1966 as a Long Beach, California jug band, scored its first charting single in 1967, and embarked on a self- propelled ride through folk, country, rock ‘n’ roll, pop, blue- grass, and the amalgam now known as “Americana.” The first major hit came in 1971 with the epic “Mr. Bojangles,” which, along with insistent support from banjo master Earl Scruggs, opened doors in Nashville. Behind those doors were Earl Scruggs, Roy Acuff, Doc Watson, Mother Maybelle Carter, Jimmy Martin, and others who would collaborate on a multi-artist, multi-generational, three-disc 1972 masterpiece: Will the Circle Be Unbroken went triple Platinum, spawned two later volumes, and wound up in the Grammy Hall of Fame.\n\nBlood harmony, thrilling instrumental flights, undeniable stage chemistry ... these things are part of each Dirt Band show, just as they are part of Dirt Does Dylan, the first recording from the reconfigured, six-strong group released in 2022. Produced by Ray Kennedy and Jeff Hanna, it’s a remarkable ride through some of the most impactful songs of the past century, penned by Bob Dylan and taken for a blue highway spin by a great American band, with help from genius-level contemporary artists like Jason Isbell and The War and Treaty.\n\nA Dirt Band show is unlike any other. For legions of fans, it’s less about the memories than the moment, crisp as an Autumn apple and rich as a royal flush.\n\nWith Special Guest A Giant Dog\n\nSunday, August 11 | 7:00 PM\n\nSpoon, Austin’s most esteemed rock ambassadors, have released ten albums to date including a string of five straight top 10 records: Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga (2007), Transference (2010), They Want My Soul (2014), Hot Thoughts (2017), and Lucifer on the Sofa (2022).\n\nLucifer on the Sofa earned the band its first-ever GRAMMY nomination (Best Rock Album) and was praised by Rolling Stone as \"The best thing they’ve ever done.”\n\nHailed by TIME as “one of the greatest American rock bands”, Spoon topped Metacritic’s chart as the single most critically acclaimed band of the aughts.\n\nIn 2019, Spoon released Everything Hits At Once: The Best of Spoon, which was praised by NPR as a “convincing argument for Spoon being one of their era's most distinctive and excellent rock bands.” That same year, Fender released the Britt Daniel Signature Telecaster Thinline as part of their artist signature electric guitar series – highlighting the enduring influence of Daniel’s precision-punk style that has helped fuel Spoon to become what the Guardian calls “one of the finest bands of their generation.”\n\n“Bad All Over The World– 50 Years of Rock”\n\nTuesday, August 13 | 7:00 PM\n\nOn the evening of December 1st, 1973 at The University of Delaware’s Lane Hall, a guitarist, a drummer, and their rhythm guitarist set up on the small bandstand. Though the three-piece band had barely rehearsed, guitarist George Thorogood and drummer Jeff Simon had been bashing out covers of songs they loved – including ‘No Particular Place To Go’, ‘Madison Blues’ and ‘One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer’ – in suburban Wilmington basements since they were teens. The Lane Hall audience was wary at first. “Then it was like somebody flipped a switch,” Simon recalls. “Everybody hit the dance floor all at once.”\n\n“We had the place rockin’,” Thorogood says. “From that very first show, Jeff and I knew we were onto something.” Five decades, 15 million albums and more than 8,000 performances later, few bands can still rock the house like George Thorogood & Destroyers. And for Thorogood, Simon, and long-time Destroyers Bill Blough, Jim Suhler and Buddy Leach, their Bad All Over The World – 50 Years of Rock Tour will be a celebration like no other.\n\nBut when asked to pick a career highlight, maybe one night over the past half century that changed everything for George Thorogood & The Destroyers, he shakes his head, flashes a huge grin and heads off to soundcheck. “My highlight is when I step on that bandstand,” Thorogood says. “The promoters invited us, the fans came to hear us, and we’re ready to rock. Every night I play for people can be the biggest night of my life.”\n\nFriday, August 23 | 7:00 PM\n\nWhen the California sister duo of Aly & AJ released their dream-rock return in 2021—the epically titled a touch of the beat gets you up on your feet gets you out and then into the sun—it marked a new beginning. A decade and a half into their careers, the album was their most realized yet, the work of a band reclaiming itself. In the wake of the runaway TikTok revival of their 2007 hit, “Potential Breakup Song,” Aly & AJ transformed their foundation of Disney pop and TV sitcoms into a new vision of sparkling guitars, close harmonies, and highway sprawl, growing on their own terms.\n\nThey bottled that energy and ran. Mere months after the release of a touch of the beat, Aly & AJ headed back to the legendary Sunset Sound to begin work on its followup, With Love From. Tracking the album in one week in December 2021, Aly & AJ reconvened with many of the same collaborators (Jorge Elbrecht, Yves Rothman, Ryan Spraker, James McAlister) that helped make their previous record such a breakthrough. If a touch of the beat conjured the relief of catching a wind on the highway, With Love From breathes it in deeply. If a touch of the beat was about searching for yourself, then With Love From is about being. “Once we felt like we were on a roll…” AJ says, as Aly finishes her thought: “There’s been no stopping us.”\n\nWith Love From was recorded amid a touch of the beat’s whirlwind success, which brought them from “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” to “Good Morning America,” from the pages of Rolling Stone to NPR, from the stages of Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits to NYC’s Governors Ball—after which they spoke out at the March for Our Lives.\n\nWith Love From marks the first time Aly & AJ have been credited as co-producers, though they’ve contributed to the exacting decisions that direct their sound since their childhoods on Hollywood Records. (“There’s no one now to intimidate us,” AJ says. “That’s what it comes down to.”) Despite their considerable artistic growth, though, Aly & AJ still feel like their younger selves in many ways: excited about being in the studio, ambitious, dreaming together.\n\nSaturday, August 24 | 7:00 PM\n\nFor two decades, Turner’s deep, velvet voice has been the most recognizable on country radio. His unwavering dedication to the tenets of the country genre inspired a generation of country singers and bolstered an underserved segment of the fanbase.\n\nAmerican country and gospel singer and songwriter. In 2003 his debut album's title track, \"Long Black Train\" was his breakthrough single release. His second album, Your Man accounted for his first two No. 1 hits, \"Your Man\" and \"Would You Go with Me\", while Everything Is Fine included a No. 2 hit, \"Firecracker\". Haywire, released in, produced his biggest hit, the four-week No. 1 hit \"Why Don't We Just Dance\" and another No. 1 song, \"All Over Me\". It was followed by Punching Bag , whose lead-off single, \"Time Is Love\", was the biggest country hit of 2012 according to Billboard Year-End.\n\nAll 4 One, Color Me Badd, Tone Lōc, Rob Base, and Young MC\n\nFriday, August 30 | 7:00 PM\n\nThe I LOVE THE 90’s TOUR invites attendees to reminisce about the trend-setting decade with some of the most iconic, indelible names in rap, hip hop, and R&B.\n\nAll-4-One is best known for their hit singles \"I Swear\", \"So Much in Love,\" and \"I Can Love You Like That\". The group is composed of Jamie Jones, Delious Kennedy, Alfred Nevarez, and Tony Borowiak. The group has sold 69 million records worldwide.\n\nRob Base burst onto the American hip-hop scene with their debut album, It Takes Two, which reached #4 on the Billboard R&B Albums Chart, was certified Platinum, and charted three hits: “It Takes Two,” “Get On The Dance Floor,” and “Joy and Pain”.\n\nTone Lōc’s unmistakable voice has produced a Billboard #1 album — Lōc-ed After Dark — and two Billboard Top-Five hits. “Wild Thing” reached #2 on the Billboard Singles Chart and was certified Twice-Platinum. “Funky Cold Medina” reached #3 and was also certified Platinum.\n\nColor Me Badd best known for their singles \"I Wanna Sex You Up\", \"I Adore Mi Amor\" and \"All 4 Love\", Color Me Badd has sold over 12 million records worldwide, had two #1 hits on the Billboard Singles Chart, nine Top 40 hits and a triple-platinum album.\n\nYoung MC came to fame with his 1989 hit \"Bust a Move.” His debut album Stone Cold Rhymin' was a Top-10 hit on the Billboard Album Chart and the Billboard Rap Chart.\n\nUnbroke Tour\n\nSaturday, August 31, 2024 | 7:00 PM\n\nMulti-platinum entertainer SARA EVANS is at the top of her game. As the fifth most-played female artist on country radio in nearly the last two decades — she’s notched over 20 top 15 singles, including her five No. 1 singles “No Place That Far,” “A Real Fine Place To Start,” “Born to Fly,” and “Suds In The Bucket,“ “A Little Bit Stronger,” both which spent 2 weeks in the top spot and were certified platinum by the R.I.A.A. — Sara thrills audiences across the U.S. playing close to 100 shows each year. Sara’s “stunning, country voice” (Rolling Stone) has earned her the prestigious Academy of Country Music Top Female Vocalist accolade as well as numerous American Music Awards, Billboard Music Awards, Country Music Association, CMT, and Grammy Awards nominations. In addition, the CMA awarded Video of the Year honors for her hit chart-topping single, “Born to Fly” from her double-platinum album of the same name. Evans’ discography also includes the platinum-selling studio albums Real Fine Place and Restless as well as the gold-certified projects Stronger and No Place That Far.\n\nStarship Featuring Mickey Thomas\n\nWith Special Guest Taylor Dayne\n\nFriday, July 12 | 7:00 PM\n\nMickey Thomas made his mark in 1976 as lead vocalist on the mega-hit “Fooled Around And Fell In Love” with The Elvin Bishop Band. In 1979, Mickey joined Jefferson Starship as the lead vocalist, after the departure of Grace Slick and Marty Balin, and recorded a string of hits including “Jane”, “No Way Out”, “Find Your Way Back”, “Stranger”, and “Layin It On The Line”.\n\nExpect to hear hits from Starship and Jefferson Starship at Starship’s live performances, as well as a few selections from Jefferson Airplane as a nod to both bands’ beginnings.\n\nTaylor Dayne is an American pop icon. With a career spanning three decades, Taylor’s groundbreaking debut single “Tell It To My Heart” turned her into an overnight international star in 1987. She followed the smash hit with seventeen Top 20 singles over the course of her three-decade career, including Number Ones “Love Will Lead You Back”, “Prove Your Love” and “I’ll Always Love You.” Taylor has sold over 75 million albums and singles worldwide, earned three GRAMMY nominations, an American Music Award, multiple New York Music Awards, received New York Music Hall of Fame honors, and ranked as the Number 18 Female Dance artist of all time by Rolling Stone magazine.\n\nUB40 Red Red Wine Tour\n\nwith Special Guests Inner Circle and Maxi Priest\n\nFriday, July 19 | 7:00 PM\n\nUB40’s long-awaited 21st studio album, UB45, has just been released. A 14-track album that features brand new songs including the singles “Gimme Some Kinda Sign” and “Home,” plus re-recordings of some of the band’s most beloved hits. With seven new UB40 recordings, including the lead single, “Gimme Some Kinda Sign,” a cover of Brenton Wood’s 1967 track “Gimme Little Sign,” the group added a special UB40 flavor to the legendary soul classic. It was chosen by Matt Doyle who brought it to Robin Campbell, unaware that the song had been on the guitarist and vocalist’s wish list since the Labour Of Love (1983) days.\n\nUB45 delivers from the band what they do best, with songs that fearlessly address societal hot-button issues and take a firm stand against the injustices of the world. This is apparent from the opening track “Home,” complete with trademark UB40 beats and the powerful themes of inequality and bigotry. Other new recordings include a beautiful rendition of Bill Withers’ “Hope She’ll Be Happier” (1971), “Trouble,” “Say Nothing,” “Fool Me Once,” and the single “Champion,” which was the official anthem of the 2022 Commonwealth Games."
