        "text": "Topline\n\nInternet users have spread a false conspiracy theory for more than a decade that the singer Avril Lavigne had died and was replaced with a lookalike actress shortly after her breakthrough in the early 2000s—which she laughed off this week.\n\nKey Facts\n\nNews Peg\n\nLavigne addressed the conspiracy theory in an interview with the popular Call Her Daddy podcast this week, obviously denying it, saying , “It’s so dumb.” Lavigne said she didn’t mind the theory, stating there could be worse rumors spread about her. Users continued to make jokes about the conspiracy in the TikTok comments section: “That’s totally something Melissa would say,” the most-liked comment says.\n\nKey Background\n\nThe rumor is thought to have started with a blog post made by a Brazilian fan in 2011 titled “Avril Está Morta”—which translates to “Avril is Dead” in English. The lengthy article introduces several different types of “evidence,” including analyses of Lavigne’s song lyrics and close examinations of her face and appearance. The theory exploded on the internet in 2015 when Buzzfeed posted a tweet thread highlighting the claims in the Brazilian blog post. Shortly after, news outlets including Paper Magazine and Vice published articles recapping the bizarre theory. The hoax, and related conspiracies, including a separate theory that Lavigne died in a snowboarding accident, have occasionally resurfaced on social media throughout the years. One thread posted in 2017 on X, then known as Twitter, declared in its first post that “avril lavigne is dead & was replaced by a look alike” before recapping the theory. The thread went viral, with its first post retweeted more than 140,000 times.\n\nSurprising Fact\n\nThe rumor garnered renewed attention once again in February when Irish comedian Joanne McNally covered the theory, as well as other internet conspiracies, in a BBC Sounds podcast titled “Who Replaced Avril Lavigne?”\n\nTangent\n\nLavigne is far from the first celebrity to be targeted by a death hoax, though conspiracy theories about clones are less common. Paul McCartney was the target of a similar rumor in the 1960s that he died and was replaced in The Beatles. A misheard lyric in “Strawberry Fields Forever” led some listeners to believe John Lennon said “I buried Paul” instead of “cranberry sauce,” and a caller to Russ Gibb’s radio station in 1969 claimed playing the song “Revolution 9” in reverse makes one lyric sound like: “Turn me on, dead man.” A false theory spread that McCartney had died in a car crash in 1966. The Beatles repeatedly denied the veracity of the rumors, and Life Magazine published a cover story in November 1969 declaring that he was, in fact, alive.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nThe Avril Lavigne Death Hoax That Won’t Die (Rolling Stone)\n\nThe Avril Lavigne conspiracy theory returns (BBC)"
