        "text": "The man who police believe gunned down an Endicott resident in a Huron Campus parking lot is being held on a murder charge.\n\nAuthorities said 24-year-old Nathaniel Williams Jr. of Endicott was being held at Broome County Jail in the town of Dickinson.\n\nNo bail had been set for Williams, who was arraigned shortly after he was taken into custody following a standoff on Binghamton's West Side.\n\nEndicott police said Williams is suspected in the killing of 25-year-old Molique Dawson, who was found lying on the ground in a parking lot on Adams Avenue.\n\nOfficers were sent to the scene after gunshots rang out around 1:30 p.m. on Saturday, July 1. Dawson was taken to Wilson Medical Center in Johnson City, where he died a short time later.\n\nEndicott police said Williams was charged with second-degree murder on October 4. An arrest warrant was issued by village court.\n\nThe U.S. Marshals Service regional fugitive task force tracked Williams to a single-family home at 68 Thorp Street in Binghamton.\n\nMetro SWAT team members showed up at the residence around 11:45 a.m. Tuesday to execute a search warrant. Homes in the neighborhood were evacuated and nearby schools went into lockdown status as a precaution.\n\nPolice said Williams was taken into custody around 5:30 p.m. No injuries were reported during the standoff.\n\nInvestigators did not say whether any weapons were found during a search of the building. They also have not revealed a possible motive in the fatal Endicott shooting last summer.\n\nVIDEO: Thorp Street shortly before Nathanial Williams was taken into custody on November 28, 2023.\n\nContact WNBF News reporter Bob Joseph: bob@wnbf.com.
