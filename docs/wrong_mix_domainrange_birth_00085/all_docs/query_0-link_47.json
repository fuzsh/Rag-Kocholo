        "text": "Indie music has long been one of the most honest genres in music. Something about the sound just begs for personal, raw feelings to emerge. And while many artists may get caught in a formula, Courtney Barnett owns it all. Courtney Barnett bares her heart in Tell Me How You Really Feel, a very personal record full of great music and honest emotions.\n\nThe very first impression you get of Tell Me How You Really Feel is one of honesty. The daunting intro of 'Hopefulessness' introduces the record perfectly, its slow and calculated approach being backed by powerful lyrics to make for a very entrancing, intimate song. The repetition of \"No one is born to hate\" throughout the song is a simple yet solemn reminder of that true fact as it looks at remorse and anger towards another. 'Charity' follows a more familiar indie vibe, though not without meaning; in this song, Barnett sings about standing in the middle of so much happiness while being cognizant of the real issues around her. Even closing track 'Sunday Roast' ends the record on a sort of dejected note, though its slow fade out seems to hint at something hopeful ahead.\n\nThe power of Tell Me How You Really Feel isn't so much the sound as it is the message, yet even then Barnett makes the most of her medium. Energy is packed into songs like 'City Looks Pretty,' and the way it changes into a more reflective and reserved piece at the end shows how she truly understands flow in music and how to use it effectively. The punchy, awesome guitars of 'Nameless, Faceless' adds some jamming vibes to the record, while the melodies and tones of 'Need A Little Time' overall add to the sense of taking yourself back the song sings about. Even the epic guitar solo of 'Help Your Self' feels emotionally powerful, showing both vulnerability and willpower. Everything on Tell Me How You Really Feel speaks to something greater than its part.\n\nCourtney Barnett bares her heart in Tell Me How You Really Feel, Barnett being truly honest and open about how she feels in a world full of scorn and relationships that seem to only hurt her. This honesty is exactly what the genre is built out of, and Barnett uses it as the backbone of this record, making it truly powerful and hard hitting."
