        "text": "Post by Rose \"Payola\" Nylund on\n\nHere goes (may edit as more premonitions come to me)\n\n- Lady Gaga: Joanne will eventually outsell ARTPOP and the era itself will last longer than it, though it doesn't have any hits as big as Applause or Do What U Want, though she does manage a minor hit at some point. Maybe Million Reasons.\n\n- Katy Perry: Her album comes out just in time for summer but she isn't a radio go-to anymore. She changes up her sound a bit but radio doesn't respond so the era underperforms.\n\n- Drake: Another 'surprise' album in the fall. Another decent sized hit, though not as big as either Hotline Bling or One Dance.\n\n- At least two of the One Director's collaborates on something.\n\n- Zayn gets a high profile movie role.\n\n- Taylor Swift gears up for a new album later in 2017 but it doesn't come out until 2018. She's having fun playing behind-the-scenes puppet-player (not master). When her album does come out, it has an 800K start.\n\n- Taylor Swift gets pregnant? (this one JUST came to me!)\n\n- Justin Bieber doesn't release an album in 2017 but is part of a few more hits. Maybe one with Drake actually.\n\n- Bruno Mars will have one major hit in 2017 and the rest of his era dwindles.\n\n- Alessia Cara begins a string of collaborations, mostly with hip-hop and R&B artists, all leading to a major 2018 album era.\n\n- The Chainsmokers don't have any more major hits but continue releasing one-off tracks because they can.\n\n- Kendrick Lamar releases an album in the middle of the year. Something's off about it. Maybe a collaborative album? I dunno. This might already be confirmed.\n\n- Kanye and Drake's album comes out to not a lot of hype but it's a critical fav.\n\n- I like Ling Ling's Ariana prediction that she'll have a GGGB-like image/era. I'll use that too.\n\n- Maroon 5's streak of hits comes to a quiet finish as they finally encounter a flop.\n\n- Song of the Summer comes from a random mid-2000s act who had a few hits. Or something with Sean Paul.\n\n- Clean Bandit's Rockabye is a Top 10 Hot 100 smash.\n\n- I don't even want to think about the musical deaths we'll have in 2017.\n\nRevision 1:\n\n- Music videos will have less prominence/impact/relevance as not having music videos becomes more and more commonplace among bigger hits. Maybe it becomes a news piece or something.\n\n- The Weeknd becomes the biggest solo male act of 2017 with his own solo stuff and features with other acts.\n\nPost by ilikemusic on\n\n- Katy Perry will experience her \"ARTPOP\". I don't necessarily think it'll be non-radio friendly, it just won't get the same response from the public and radio that her previous stuff did. I'm not saying what Dr. Luke has done to artists in the past is ok, but he really was the genius behind Katy. Max Martin worked with her too but if you watch interviews on the making of her albums, Luke is the driving force. I wonder if she'll still work with him or what she's gonna sound like without him. Either way, this album is gonna underperform.\n\n- Taylor Swift will release the lead single of her album and it will debut high, possibly at #1, but won't have longevity because she'll refuse to put it on Spotify, once again, unless their free tier is removed which is a strong possibility. Either way, the public will slowly start to support her less. She's not gonna flop by any means, but her album won't sell more than 2 million in the states.\n\n- P!nk will release her long awaited album but it won't make much of an impact. She's a legacy artist at this point, just like Britney Spears. She might be able to cross 500k in pure sales though, since she's proved to have a decent amount of longevity. I think the 5 year gap in between albums though wasn't doing her many favors. Hot Adult Contemporary radio will play any single off of the album though, as she's proven to be a staple, if not, the biggest staple on that radio format.\n\n-Justin Timberlake will release an album and it also won't make much of a splash. It'll also probably go gold in pure sales, but I don't see him having more than one decent hit off of it.\n\n-The Weeknd's era will continue on in the beginning of the year, but \"Starboy\" (the song) will be the only big hit off of \"Starboy\" (the album). He'll probably have an additional 2-3 moderate hits though.\n\n-Bruno Mars's era will have one more single that will underperform and they'll most likely call it quits after that.\n\n-Maroon 5 will experience their first true flop album. They might be able to get by on one or two more singles if they're as generic and radio-fodder friendly as \"Don't Wanna Know\", but the album itself will bomb. All their albums have gone platinum in pure sales alone in the states. This one won't even cross the 500k mark.\n\n-Gaga will rush-release her lead single in the fall of 2017, as it's pretty obvious at this point that Joanne doesn't really have any massive hits. Her Superbowl halftime show will be praised to the high heavens and she'll attract more public interest, thus diving into a new project more reminiscent of her early music.\n\n-Demi Lovato will return to the music scene, sometime towards the middle of the year, and she'll be as much of a flop as she always has been. Stay pressed, Demi!\n\n-Selena Gomez will also return to the music scene, and will most likely have the biggest era she's had yet. In fact, she'll probably have the biggest era out of the Disney/Nick girls.\n\n-Ariana Grande will most likely release something in the third quarter, and it'll pull decent, but not incredible numbers.\n\n-Miley Cyrus will return to the music scene in 2017 and release a country/folk inspired album. She'll lose a lot of her pop fans, but will gain an older audience. The album will be critically successful, but not so much commercially. Her public perception will definitely go up though, as she'll be marketed as \"normal\" this time around.\n\n-Rihanna will return to a more pop sound and see further success. She'll get her 15th #1 hit, and establish her legacy even further.\n\n-Justin Bieber will most likely release his lead single towards the end of 2017, and the song will do as well as his public perception. He's a loose cannon, who knows what he'll pull in the next coming months.. That's truly unpredictable, haha! It'll do well if he doesn't screw up his public image that he currently has, which although problematic, isn't nearly as bad as it was in 2013-2014.\n\n- Kelly Clarkson will release her first album under Atlantic records, and will have a massive comeback. She's going to be the dark horse of 2017. Since she's going for a more soul/R&B sound, she'll cater to the \"Adele audience\", and will pull unexpected numbers.\n\n-Avril Lavigne and Christina Aguilera will most likely release albums, but they won't receive much attention as their relevance has dwindled dramatically this decade.\n\n-Maren Morris will release another album towards the end of 2017, which will further propel her bigger in country music. She will be the new \"princess of country\", as Carrie and Miranda are getting older and Taylor no longer caters to that genre. She might even crossover to pop. I see very big things for this girl, keep an eye on her!\n\n-Nick Jonas will probably release something and nobody will actually care\n\n-Shawn Mendes will release something, probably have another radio hit with a song that sounds exactly like Stitches, and will still continue to make little impact outside the tween demographic\n\n-Harry Styles will make his solo debut and have one decent sized hit, but the album will perform similarly to Zayn's. I don't see him being a massive star like JT was when he left NSYNC\n\n-Speaking of 1D, Niall will release his album and it'll flop. Zayn will release another album and it'll most likely flop because he refuses to perform live.\n\n-Jacob Sartorius, the kid who made that awful \"Sweatshirt\" song, will be pushed as the next \"Justin Bieber\". Get ready for it, folks. It might actually work which is the sad thing\n\n-Camila Cabello will make her solo debut but won't see much success. She'll probably go running back to Fifth Harmony.... A Nicole Scherzinger tea.\n\n-Hailee Steinfeld will continue to release music and most likely an album in 2017, but no one will care and it'll flop.\n\n-Charlie Puth will also release music in 2017 and might score a moderate hit on HAC radio, but no one will generally care about his release as well. It'll do worse numbers than \"Nine Track Mind\", but probably won't have a 37 on metacritic, lmao.\n\n-Fifth Harmony will still include Camila and they'll probably release the lead single to their 3rd album in the middle of 2017 and it'll be a summer hit. Their subsequent album will flop though just like the rest of theirs.\n\n-Alessia Cara will start working with more mainstream producers/writers and will have an even bigger era than her first.\n\n-Lorde finally returns, but will ultimately flop, as her sound and image is a bit.... dated. The \"indie girl\" trend will completely die out at the beginning of the year, as it's already on its way out now. I have no clue as to why she waited 3.5+ years to follow up her debut.\n\n-Halsey will release her second album and will be marketed as more of a \"popstar\", but she won't be doing any astronomical numbers. She might score a moderate hit or two, but won't make much noise outside of that.\n\n-Nicki Minaj will return. Her lead single will do decently on urban, but pop radio won't touch her. She'll experience a drop in popularity.\n\n-Iggy Azalea will release her 2nd album and completely flop and get dropped from her label.\n\n-Drake will spam iTunes and Spotify with at least 6 more songs that could do well on streaming but will continue to be less critically acclaimed, as his motto as of recent is quantity over quality.\n\n-Adele's \"All I Ask\" will be released in late January of 2017 and will close out the 25 era. It'll peak in the Top 20 and at #1 on HAC/AC radio.\n\n-Beyoncé won't release anything in 2017.\n\n-There will be a completely new artist that is currently not even known in the slightest, that may breakout and dominate Gaga-2009 style.\n\n-Spotify's free tier will be removed and there will be an increase in piracy, YouTube views, and iTunes sales.\n\nPost by House Lannister on\n\nPredictions for 2017 (keep in mind I got Metallica's comeback right, but not much else):\n\n1. Eminem releases a new album in 2017 and his opening track is a salvo at Drake that's pretty well received and becomes his only top 40 hit of that era.\n\n2. Harry Styles turns out to be the Justin Timberlake of One Direction as his first single smashes at number 1 and he has two more top 10s.\n\n3. Ariana Grande decides to change her image up. But instead of Rhianna, she takes a page from Like a Virgin era Madonna and starts wearing bustiers on stage with platinum locks.\n\n4. Zayn manages to hit the top 10 with that Taylor Swift collaboration as 50 Shades Darker drops from 50 Shades of Gray, and I see one more top 40 single for him.\n\n5. Lorde finally releases a new album in 2017 and has a number 1 with her first single and several more top 20 hits. The album becomes one of the favorites for Album of the Year.\n\n6. Katy Perry's Rise turns out to be an omen as her new album drops in 2017 and disappoints. Her first single turns out to be her highest charting one and it peaks in the top 5.\n\n7. Azealia Banks will shockingly land her first hit in 2017 as the David Guetta produced single reaches the top half of the Hot 100. But she'll embroil herself in controversy towards the end of the year.\n\n8. Two female rappers release their albums in 2017. But while Missy Elliott will find her comeback successful (particularly when an unexpected collaboration during the summer months becomes huge), Iggy Azalea will falter as her new single will peak right around 40 or so and the next two barely make a chart dent.\n\n9. Camilla Cabello will release a single album and it will go the way of Nicole Scherzinger. Flopperino.\n\n10. Rage Against the Machine will reunite and their first single will quickly go up the rock charts and hit the Hot 100 due to it being a protest song about President Trump.\n\n11. Will repeat a 2016 prediction here: Childish Gambino will be nominated for several Grammys for his recently released album in late 2017.\n\n12. Drake releases yet another new album in 2017 and manages a number 1 hit. But several singles from the album bubble under.\n\n13. Melanie Martinez will get into a feud with a Youtube music critic over her look when he makes a wisecrack remark on Twitter. The feud will have an unexpected benefit when she finally cracks the Hot 100 with her first original single.\n\n14. P!nk launches a new album finding a pair of top 20 hits, but her more mature sound while getting critical raves is less likely to find radio love.\n\n15. Some electronic communication mishap (errant e-mail or Tweet probably) will unleash a torrent of accusations that Mercury sabotaged Scotty McCreery and Southern Belle, first by switching around the date of release of the song and then by doing a shoddy, last minute video. Scotty does manage to release a new album in 2017 with Broken Bow and lands a third top 10 country hit with a more traditional sound.\n\n16. Unlikely collaboration of the year? Drake and Taylor Swift (yes, the number one hit from earlier). You can thank Apple for that.\n\n17. Song of Summer 2017? A dance collaboration between Major Lazer, Ed Sheeran, and Sean Paul.\n\n18. Kesha will quietly be freed by Sony in the summer and she'll have a new album out by fall. Her first single will hit top 20, but won't get much more than that due to the new sound of her music.\n\n19. Nicki Minaj drops a new album in 2017 and finds a pair of top 15 hits. She also runs into controversy for sampling a song whose artist is less than appreciative of her raunchy lyrics.\n\n20. Eric Church will get into a feud with an artist who collaborates with a pop artist at an awards show that lasts for most of the year.\n\n21. Although he won't do as well as Maren Morris, Mo Pitney will have a pretty big 2017 nonetheless. He'll chart in the Hot 100 and come up with an acclaimed performance at an awards show.\n\n22. The Dixie Chicks will finally get some country radio love thanks to a surprising collaboration with Miranda Lambert.\n\n23. Haim reaches the Hot 100 thanks to a soundtrack appearance that becomes a radio single.\n\n24. The Weeknd continues to be huge in 2017; Bruno Mars has a pair of minor chart hits before going on a wildly successful tour.\n\n25. This isn't the year for Jacob Satorius; Austin Mahone will have a good year, though.\n\n26. Fetty Wap releases a new album that flops; Tech N9ne will find his greatest Hot 100 hit as a lead artist.\n\n27. Shania Twain releases new music in 2017, doing surprisingly well making inroads into a changed country landscape.\n\n28. A rock song not by Twentyone Pilots cracks the Top 40 of the Hot 100 at some point in 2017.\n\n29. Zendaya releases her second album in 2017 and I think it will smash.\n\n30. An actor hits the top 40 on the Hot 100 as he decides to release an album; this has nothing to do with a song on a film soundtrack. I mean a full fledged album and everything.\n\n31. Significant deaths of 2017: Tina Turner, Mary Wilson, Rod Stewart.\n\n32. In time for the 2018 Grammys, Taylor drops her new album. She breaks one million in sales in her first week and has 3 number one singles and ends that era with 5 altogether.\n\n33. Get used to it: Both Lin-Manuel Miranda and The Rock will have Oscars as You're Welcome wins Best Original Song over Justin Timberlake's Can't Stop the Feeling.\n\n34. As for musicians coming out, I predict we'll learn of a longtime rapper who gets outed thanks to an article on the National Enquirer that reports that he's engaged to marry a noted gay man. After initial denials, he'll admit that it's true leading to an upswing of positive popularity as a result.\n\n35. One music streaming service will bite the dust in 2017 as losses and stiff competition prove too much to bear.\n\n36. Thomas Rhett will spend quite a bit of time in a courtroom as he defends some of his hits against artists accusing him of plagiarizing them."
