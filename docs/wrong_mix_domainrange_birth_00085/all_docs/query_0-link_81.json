        "text": "Joe Walsh and James Gang To Play Show With Dave Grohl\n\nJoe Walsh has announced the bill for his annual VetsAid charity concert, and this year’s roster features the reunited James Gang. The band’s current lineup will include Jimmy Fox and Dale Peters, who appeared with Walsh on 1970’s James Gang Rides Again. The appearance is being billed as the James Gang’s final performance.\n\nThe sixth annual event is set for Nov. 13 at the Nationwide Arena in Columbus, Ohio. Other acts tapped for the show include Dave Grohl, Nine Inch Nails, the Black Keys and the Breeders. The show also marks Grohl’s first announced performance since Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins died earlier this year. Grohl recently performed with Paul McCartney, but that was a surprise appearance.\n\nOhio has a special place in Walsh’s heart, as he lived there and went to Kent State University. This year’s VetsAide bill features a bevy of Ohio artists, as the James Gang and Nine Inch Nails are from Cleveland; the Black Keys are from Akron; Grohl hails from Warren; and the Breeders are from Dayton.\n\n“It all started in Ohio,” Walsh said in a statement. “Picking up my first guitar as a kid in Columbus set me on a musical journey to Kent State, Cleveland and then the world. Now it is a great privilege and humbling opportunity for me to share the stage once again with my original James Gang buddies and with this absolutely incredible group of Ohio rock legends like Trent Reznor and Nine Inch Nails, the Black Keys, the Breeders and Dave Grohl. I believe in Ohio and look forward to celebrating our musical legacy while honoring our veterans with VetsAid 2022.”\n\nProceeds from the 2022 event will go to veterans’ services. Tickets for the concert will go on sale on Aug. 5 via Ticketmaster.\n\nGALLERY: Classic Rockers from the Midwest\n\nAnne Erickson started her radio career shortly after graduating from Michigan State University and has worked on-air in Detroit, Flint, Toledo, Lansing and beyond.
