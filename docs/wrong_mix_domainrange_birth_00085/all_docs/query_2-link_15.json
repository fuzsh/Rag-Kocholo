        "text": "Avril Lavigne Gender: Female Age: 35 Born: 27 September 1984 Most Well Known Character: Heather (Over the hedge) Occupation: Singer, Actress, Songwriter Years Active: 1999–present\n\nAvril Ramona Lavigne (born 27 September 1984) is a Canadian singer-songwriter. She was born in Belleville, Ontario, but spent most of her youth in the small town of Napanee. By the age of 15, she had appeared on stage with Shania Twain; by 16, she had signed a two-album recording contract with Arista Records worth more than $2 million. In 2002, when she was 17 years old, Lavigne broke onto the music scene with her debut album Let Go. Since her professional debut, she has become one of the most successful artists in the world, selling more than 30 million albums and over 50 million singles worldwide.\n\nLet Go made Lavigne the youngest female soloist to reach number 1 in the UK. As of 2013, it has sold nearly 7 million copies in the United States and over 17 million copies worldwide. Her breakthrough single, \"Complicated\", peaked at number 1 in many countries around the world, as did the album Let Go. Her second album, Under My Skin, was released in 2004 and was her first album to peak at number 1 on the U.S. Billboard 200, eventually selling more than 10 million copies worldwide. The Best Damn Thing, Lavigne’s third album, was released in 2007, becoming her third number 1 album in the UK Albums Chart and featuring her first U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number 1 single, \"Girlfriend\". Lavigne has scored six number-one singles worldwide, including \"Complicated\", \"Sk8er Boi\", \"I'm with You\", \"My Happy Ending\", \"Nobody's Home\", and \"Girlfriend\". Lavigne is one of the top-selling artists releasing albums in the U.S., with over 11 million copies certified by the RIAA. Her fourth studio album, Goodbye Lullaby, was released in March 2011. Goodbye Lullaby gave Lavigne her fourth top 10 album on the U.S. Billboard 200 and the UK Albums Chart and her third number 1 album in both Japan and Australia. Three months after the release of Goodbye Lullaby, Lavigne began work on her fifth album, which will be released on Epic Records following her departure from RCA Records.\n\nLavigne branched out from recording music, pursuing careers in feature film acting and designing clothes and perfumes. She voiced a character in the animated film Over the Hedge in 2006. That same year, she made her on-screen feature film debut in Fast Food Nation. In 2008, Lavigne introduced her clothing line, Abbey Dawn, and in 2009, she released her first perfume, Black Star, which was followed by her second perfume, Forbidden Rose, in 2010 and her third perfume, Wild Rose, in 2011. In July 2006, Lavigne married her boyfriend of two years, Deryck Whibley, lead singer and guitarist for Sum 41. The marriage lasted a little over three years, and in October 2009, Lavigne filed for divorce. Whibley and Lavigne continued to work together, with Whibley producing her fourth album, as well as Lavigne's single, \"Alice\", written for Tim Burton's film Alice in Wonderland.\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nAvril Ramona Lavigne was born in Belleville, Ontario. Her father, Jean-Claude Joseph Lavigne, named her \"Avril\" after the French word for the month of April. At the age of two, she began singing church songs with her mother, Judith-Rosanne \"Judy\" (née Loshaw). Judy recognized her two-year-old daughter's talents after hearing her sing \"Jesus Loves Me\" in church. Lavigne has an older brother, Matthew, and a younger sister, Michelle, both of whom teased her when she sang. \"My brother used to knock on the wall because I used to sing myself to sleep and he thought it was really annoying.\"\n\nWhen Lavigne was five years old, the family moved to Napanee, Ontario, a town with a population of approximately 5,000. Although she struggles with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and was sometimes being kicked out of class for misbehaving as a child, her parents supported her singing. Her father bought her a microphone, a drum kit, a keyboard, and several guitars, and converted their basement into a studio. When Lavigne was 14, her parents would take her to karaoke sessions. Lavigne also performed at country fairs, singing songs by Garth Brooks, The Dixie Chicks, and Shania Twain. She also began writing her own songs. Her first song was called \"Can't Stop Thinking About You\", about a teenage crush, which she described as \"cheesy cute\".\n\n“ I’ve known all my life that this is what I was supposed to do.... Visualizing like what it would be like to be famous with my music. And always just dreaming, always daydreaming ”\n\n— Avril Lavigne, NBC News\n\nIn 1999, Lavigne won a radio contest to perform with fellow Canadian singer Shania Twain at the Corel Centre (now Scotiabank Place) in Ottawa, before an audience of 20,000 people. Twain and Lavigne sang \"What Made You Say That\", and Lavigne told Twain that she was going to be \"a famous singer\". During a performance with the Lennox Community Theatre, Lavigne was spotted by local folksinger Stephen Medd. He invited her to contribute vocals on his song, \"Touch the Sky\", for his 1999 album, Quinte Spirit. She later sang on \"Temple of Life\" and \"Two Rivers\" for his follow-up album, My Window to You, in 2000. In December 1999, Lavigne was discovered by her first professional manager, Cliff Fabri, while singing country covers at a Chapters bookstore in Kingston, Ontario. Fabri sent out VHS tapes of Lavigne's home performances to several industry prospects, and Lavigne was visited by several executives. Mark Jowett, co-founder of the Canadian management firm Nettwerk, received a copy of Lavigne's karaoke performances recorded in her parents' basement. Jowett arranged for Lavigne to work with Peter Zizzo during the summer of 2000 in New York, where she wrote the song \"Why\". Lavigne was noticed by Arista Records on a subsequent trip to New York.\n\nBy 2013, Lavigne would go on to sell more than 50 million singles and 30 million copies of her albums worldwide, becoming one of the top-selling artists releasing albums in the U.S., with over 10.25 million copies certified by the RIAA. In 2009, Billboard named Lavigne the number 10 pop artist in the \"Best of the 2000s\" chart. She was listed as the 28th overall best act of the decade based on album and single chart performance in the U.S.\n\nPersonal Life[]\n\nWhen Lavigne first gained publicity, she was known for her tomboyish style, in particular her necktie-and-tank-top combinations. She preferred baggy clothes, skater shoes or Converses, wristbands, and sometimes shoelaces wrapped around her fingers. During photo shoots, instead of wearing \"glittery get-ups\", she preferred wearing \"old, crumpled T's\".In response to her fashion and musical influences, the media would call her the \"pop punk princess\". Press and fans regarded her as the \"anti-Britney\", in part because of her less commercial and \"real\" image, but also because she was noticeably headstrong. \"I’m not made up and I’m not being told what to say and how to act, so they have to call me the anti-Britney, which I’m not.\" By November 2002, however, Lavigne stopped wearing ties, claiming she felt she was \"wearing a costume\". Lavigne made a conscious effort to keep her music, and not her image, at the forefront of her career. \"I'm just saying, I don't want to sell sex. I feel that's sort of lame and low. I've got so much more to say.\"\n\n“ I have to fight to keep my image really me.... I rejected some gorgeous publicity shots because they just didn't look like me. I won't wear skanky clothes that show my booty, my belly or my boobs. I have a great body. ”\n\n— Avril Lavigne, MTV\n\nLavigne eventually took on a more gothic style as she began her second album, Under My Skin, trading her skating outfits for black tutus and earning an image marked by angst. During The Best Damn Thing years, Lavigne changed directions. She dyed her hair blonde with a pink streak, wore feminine outfits, including \"tight jeans and heels\", and modelled for magazines such as Harper's Bazaar. Lavigne defended her new style: \"I don't really regret anything. You know, the ties and the wife-beaters and all... It had its time and place. And now I'm all grown up, and I've moved on\". She now tries to eat healthy foods and practises yoga, soccer, surfing, rollerblading, and street hockey."
