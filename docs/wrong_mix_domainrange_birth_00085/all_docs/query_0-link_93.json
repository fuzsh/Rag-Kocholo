        "text": "The film debuts of Julie Christie, Barbra Streisand, Faye Dunaway, the Redgrave sisters, the apotheosis of Patricia Neal, and a stunning popular and critical comeback for Katherine Hepburn marked the sixties, when old gods died and a new world struggled to form. Funny how Hollywood went from Geraldine Page mewling through floridly suggestive Tennessee Williams adaptations at the dawn of the decade only for the treatment of sex to mature by the early Nixon era. Continue reading “Ranking Best Actress nominees: 1960s”\n\nGreeted with what I can generously call mixed reviews last fall, Bohemian Rhapsody has faced no such obstacles with the general audience. The producers can’t argue with the grosses ($200 million in American box office alone), nor can Queen argue, in depressed times for legacy acts with no new material, with fattened revenue streams. Rami Malek, who plays Freddie Mercury, will likely win Best Actor at next Sunday’s Academy Awards ceremony.\n\nMy November experience was such a bore that I lacked the motivation to write a review. Instead of offering one now, I offer a series of impressions based on one of my mentors.Continue reading “Thirteen ways of looking at ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’”\n\nMarlon Brando receded in the decade when the studio system collapsed, replaced by corporate fealty to youth culture in all its forms even if it meant John Wayne and Kirk Douglas growing mutton chops. At the end the decade Bonnie and Clyde and Midnight Cowboy would scare the hell out of the geezers. Peter O’Toole became the hot young British actor, which meant Hollywood had to slip into sandals and robes. Close behind was Richard Burton, O’Toole’s co-star in the queer royal drama Becket (both actors know exactly what they’re doing), yet his two best film performances were in contemporary fare (The Spy Who Came in From the Cold and Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?). Continue reading “Ranking Best Actor, 1960s edition”\n\nfirst-time viewings included Seijun Suzuki’s nightmarish vision of post-war Japan, a couple of restored von Sternberg classics and not quite classics, and Peter Bogdanovich’s They All Laughed, in which John Ritter, Ben Gazzara, and Audrey Hepburn trail each other or are being trailed on the excellently photographed Manhattan streets. Some of the dialogue is so far from glittering that I’m sure Bogdanovich thinks his script is Samuel Raphaelson material. It defines a mess, and I can understand why someone would hug it close based on what I’ve written.Continue reading “Screenings #41”\n\nWhatever readers think about the mythos congealing about American film in the seventies, I expect little dissent about the nominations for Best Actress, the best since the 1935-1945 run. Continue reading “Ranking Best Actress, 1970s”\n\nThe decade of Pacino, De Niro, and Nicholson, the seventies have become as apotheosized as FDR. A glance at the nominees for Best Actor confirm the conventional wisdom, though. I will never get back what I lost watching The Goodbye Girl a decade ago.\n\nContinue reading “Ranking Best Actor nominees, 1970s edition”\n\nAt the same time she has explained Ryan Adams’ malignancy, Phoebe Bridgers has been promoting excellent music she co-wrote with Conor Oberst under the Better Oblivion Center moniker.

Thanks to a wide-angle lens developed by Moondog Labs, Steven Soderbergh’s film about basketball players weighing the price of going independent has a crispness that surpasses 2016’s Tangerine or even his own Unsane. An incisive script by Moonlight‘s Tarell Alvin McCraney, a marvelous lead performance by the same film’s André Holland, and a brief running time turn High Flying Bird into the kind of adult pleasure we rarely get in movies. No wonder it’s getting a limited release during a concurrent Netflix run. This is the best Soderbergh narrative film in twenty years. His queerest too.\n\nContinue reading “‘High Flying Bird’ — an NBA movie high on tough talk”\n\n1. Miguel – Adorn\n\n2. New Order – True Faith\n\n3. Vanessa Williams – Save the Best For Last\n\n4.
