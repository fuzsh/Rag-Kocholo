        "text": "“Chill out, what ya yellin’ for?”\n\nTwenty years ago, this question was an introduction to 17-year-old Avril Lavigne from Napanee, Ont. Clad in her now iconic combo of tank top, tie and Vans skate shoes, Lavigne was the antithesis of the typical 2002 chart-topper. She wasn’t a pristine, hyperfeminine pop star; instead, she looked like one of the kids you would see at your local mall, an image literally crystallized in the music video for “Complicated.” While that wasn’t Lavigne’s hardest-hitting rock song — in fact, it’s more of a mid-tempo banger — her simple reflection on everyday teen life (and angst) projected the image of a rebel who wanted to do things on her own terms. Within the glossy pop machine that worked overtime to churn out cookie-cutter stars in the early millennium, this statement felt radical.\n\nLike many women before her (Alanis Morissette, Riot Grrrls and their cohort, Joan Jett and more), anger became a key part of Lavigne’s identity. Soon, sexist critics would throw her words back at her: Chill out, why does a teenage girl need to yell so much? Lavigne embodied a lot of traits that male artists have historically been praised for: rage, passion, general disinterest in style. (Lavigne often noted that she wore the same clothes for the first several years because that’s all she had with her.) But she was chastised for this, and that vitriol extended to Lavigne’s art, too. “To a young audience tired of glitzy teen disco, Lavigne has been presented as a guitar-toting singer-songwriter,” a 2003 Rolling Stone feature stated. “But it is unclear how much songwriting she does.”\n\nLavigne sparked debates around whether her music was punk, pop-punk or rock. (In Lavigne’s defense, she stated in multiple interviews that she wasn’t claiming to be punk, implying that it was a label given to her by others.) As one of the only women present within that era of Warped Tour and pop-punk, Lavigne was breaking new ground.\n\nWhile absurd questions about her legitimacy continued to swirl, Lavigne was undeniably empowering an entire generation of young music lovers. Whether it was picking up a skateboard, chucking gendered ideas out the window or starting their own rock bands, fans used Lavigne’s songs to soundtrack their feelings of loneliness, love and, most potently, being pissed off.\n\nTwenty years later, we’re seeing the next class of pop-punk purveyors top the charts, while giving pioneers like Lavigne the credit they deserve. Following her fiery debut, Lavigne went on to sell millions of records, win nine Juno Awards and eight Grammy Awards. The pop-punk princess still carries significant influence — reigning pop royalty Olivia Rodrigo has cited Lavigne as inspiration — while artists in adjacent genres (Tyler Shaw, Soccer Mommy) feel her ripple effect, too.\n\nTo celebrate the 20th anniversary of Lavigne’s debut album, Let Go, CBC Music spoke to 15 artists and writers about the songs on the album that shaped the lives of an entire generation.\n\n“Avril was definitely one of the first artists that gave me the guts to pursue something different, to explore the counterculture of things. I was born on a farm, but shortly after that I moved to a suburb and was surrounded by jocks and cheerleaders. And when Avril came out, it actually gave me the fearlessness to leave what I was doing, the things that were comfortable at the time and the norm for the city I grew up in, and literally become a skateboarder and musician, wear Dickies and skate shoes. It was kind of an overnight change. I think for the whole world it kind of did that. No disrespect to the biggest skateboarders in the world that have always been doing it, but if you think Avril didn’t do a service to skateboarding in general, you’re crazy.\n\n“So, you put this album on, you hit play, and you hear this haunting track, ‘Losing Grip.’ I had no idea what to expect going into it, but [the song] is very heartbreaking, but also, there’s this sense of optimism in it. It talks about going through things alone, and I’ll never forget connecting to the lyrics and being like, ‘This is so different from everything.’ This was a time of boy bands and diva kinds of pop stars, and what Avril did was so opposite to that. It was one of the first times I felt like I really connected to a woman artist, to be totally honest. Like, I can really connect to this person and understand what they’re saying and it really showed me that we are all going through the same problems. Sonically, it might be one of the most in-your-face, hard-hitting tracks of Avril’s career and I can just see how much that song resonates with everyone, from artists to fans. It’s incredible what this song has done, and not being one of the big singles from that record, it stands on its own as one of the most special songs.”\n\n— Mod Sun, Minnesota-born hip-hop/pop-punk artist and Lavigne’s fiancé\n\nFrank Kadillac: When I was younger, my mom would have me babysit my sister, and the thing that we would do all the time was watch MuchMusic together. And every time we saw a song that we liked, we would wait for it to come back on the next day on Countdown, and we recorded it on VHS. I remember “Complicated” was a song we had recorded and just watched over and over again, and we became big fans. It was like a bonding moment for me and my sister.\n\nAdrian Morris: I was very into that 2000s era of pop-punk and I feel like the time around Let Go and “Complicated” is kind of when it really broke into the mainstream and it was like, OK, the music I’m into is now on the radio and it’s this big thing. The “Complicated” video is almost a testament to that era of music and my life because we were skateboard kids growing up and watching her and her friends hanging out at the mall just reminds me a lot of our life here [in Halifax], growing up with our friends.\n\nKadillac: Those lyrics, “And you fall, and you crawl, and you break/ and you take what you get, and you turn it into honesty” — it gave me hope, that one moment of the song. I was always going through stuff, and there would be songs like that that would help me get out of a bad moment, and a lot of Avril’s songs were there for me and my sister.\n\nMorris: I feel like it was the go-to song for me, for youthful heartbreak. You know, like when the world’s ending? That song sums it up for me.\n\n— Neon Dreams, Halifax-based alt-pop duo\n\n“I remember the first time I saw Avril on TV, and what I loved about her was that she felt familiar. She felt like someone I could hang out with. It was refreshing for me to see another girl that really didn’t give a shit, and was rebellious and from Canada.\n\n“I knew [‘Sk8er Boi’] was going to be a smash for sure [when I first heard it]. It’s hooky as hell. The chorus is infectious, and she’s being strong in a cheeky way. The song’s sick. I was very enamored with the video; it had so much energy, and I loved that. My videos were performance videos, but hers were different. I remember her band looked so cool and awesome.\n\n“There was definitely a connection there [between me and Avril]: two girls that felt cut from the same cloth, but had really different lives, different struggles, different stories. And yet, we were both able to help teenagers get through things even though we were trying to get through things ourselves.”\n\n— Fefe Dobson, Toronto-born pop-rock artist whose debut, self-titled album was released the year after Lavigne’s Let Go\n\nEdith Johnson: “I think [‘Mobile’] is a hidden gem on this album. I feel like the song resonates with a lot of people because it’s about just things changing. She talks about how things are never really stable, and how everything can change every day, and she kind of feels conflicted about it. And I think it’s just a really good message, and it’s one of my favourite chorus melodies of hers.”\n\nTéa Campbell: “And we can really relate to it on a personal level because the way I kind of interpreted it is like she got thrown into stardom and has been on the road all the time. So when she leaves, things are changing at home, and when she comes back, everything’s different. And we can definitely relate to that because we’ve basically been touring nonstop for the past seven or eight months.”\n\n— Meet Me @ the Altar, Florida pop-punk band\n\n“I love how this song isn’t just a little love song about a boy. It’s actually a story about meeting her boyfriend’s parents for the first time and them not accepting her for who she was. It’s such a specific concept for a song and something everyone can relate to. You could be a young rebellious teen like she was — queer, an outcast for whatever reason — or maybe you don’t feel you measure up to society. That’s why Avril is so iconic: she sings about being excluded, and somehow it’s so inclusive. As songwriters, sometimes when we are paired up with young artists, we try to make the songs more general and relatable to a larger audience, but songs like these go to show that when you stick to your own experiences and stay honest, that is often what resonates and it can connect with more people than you think.\n\n“I love the angst in this. You can really feel the rejection she must have been feeling as a young girl, trying to be proper for her boyfriend’s family but knowing they weren’t going to like her anyways.”\n\n— Lowell, Toronto-based musician and songwriter for Lennon Stella, Demi Lovato, Charli XCX and others\n\n“Avril Lavigne is probably one of the first artists that I was listening to, not from my parents playing me music. People my age, when we were kids, everyone was listening to Avril Lavigne. I started writing songs when I was, like, five. I was really into guitar, and Avril was such a rocker. I was a tomboy, I was really into her whole vibe — doing this kind of pop music, but it had grit and this edge. She, in general, had an edge, which I think is what got a lot of young girls super excited. I just wanted to be a rocker chick and she was doing that.\n\n“[‘Tomorrow’] is actually one of my favourite deep cuts. It’s kind of its own thing on the album. It does have that Liz Phair or Sheryl Crow type of energy. It’s something that has this really nice flow to it — especially the chorus, it becomes very ... not what you would expect [with these] droning backing vocals coming in and out. I think one of my favourite things about this song is the snare. I know that might seem a little crazy to point out, but it’s really easy to try to do a snare like that and it’s awful, but this is so perfect. It’s such a smack and it’s tuned to that high-pitch note. The song, for it being on this big pop album, it’s something that I could absolutely see an indie artist putting out nowadays.”\n\n— Soccer Mommy, Nashville-born singer-songwriter and musician\n\n“‘Anything but Ordinary’ really brings home the message of not only not caring if you fit in, but actually not wanting to fit in at all. I think a lot of us found power in being intentionally different and deciding not to play the game of trying to fit in with the popular kids. ‘Anything but Ordinary’ sums up this feeling: ‘To walk within the lines would make my life so boring.’\n\n“Avril carved out a path for girls in pop music that showed them they could be themselves. She took a narrow path for singers and widened it to create more space for more types of people. This definitely helped plant the seed of hope for me that I could have a career in music and also remain true to myself.”\n\n— Ria Mae, Halifax-based pop artist\n\n“I think I relate to this song the most because growing up in middle school, and even in high school, I always had crushes but was too afraid or too shy to go up to the girl I had a crush on and be like, ‘Hey, I really like you.’ ‘Guess I’m wishing my life away/ with these things I’ll never say’ — that was definitely me back then.\n\n“I don’t feel that as much now; I feel like I’m really good at telling people I love them. But, I relate to it now more so in that I don’t speak up when things bother me, or if I don’t understand something; those are things that I have difficulty with. But I’m aware of it. So Avril, I’m going to keep this song in my mind and I’m going to really work on that!”\n\n— Tyler Shaw, Richmond, B.C.-born pop artist\n\n“On ‘My World,’ an 18-year-old Avril Lavigne shrugs off, possibly, one of the most unyielding lyrics on her landmark debut: ‘Where do I belong forever? In whose arms, the time and place?’ You get the feeling that she’s posing a question she already has an answer to. ‘My World’ is deceivingly poppy: a bouncy passenger-seat, shout-along anthem that never got its due, and an unearthed leftover from the apex of breezy ‘unselfconsciously ambitious Y2K rock.’ There’s something delicious about the fine detail of her take on nihilism: by meditating on the minutiae of mundane actions, exhaustion and boredom become the precursor to the intimate, well-known mischief of stealing back time for yourself. As she narrates a typical day in Napanee, Ont., one where she refuses to remember anyone’s name, or free-falls into a daydream rather than making eye contact, she suggests unflappable clemency in what others perceive as flaws. In the process, nudging you to consider: are the mechanisms we create to shield ourselves from our surroundings ever a concession worth making? It’s not so much [of] an apology, but an intentionally half-hearted ode to self-preservation. Avril has no plans to leave her world. So, the choice is yours: You’re either in it, or you’re out.”\n\n— Melissa Vincent, Toronto-based music journalist\n\n“I played it again recently and it just brought me right back to when I would blare this song with my window down in my bedroom, going through the angsty struggle of being 14 and 15 years old. Being able to relate to this young woman in music, who was not afraid to be herself, who was showcasing that and writing that and showing up in her music as that, I really looked up to that as a young girl and wanted to emulate that in my own life. I wanted to be that confident. I wanted to be that brave. I wanted to say, you know, ‘I’m nobody’s fool.’ I’m strong on my own.\n\n“I felt like at that time, there were a lot of female artists that came out and their talent was defined by their physical selves. And it still tends to be like that in music, but with Avril, it felt really cool to see it be about attitude and strength and this vibrant female independence and power. I was at that vulnerable age where it was so important to have those kinds of people to look up to, females to look up to. And that’s what that album, and specifically that song represented for me.”\n\n— Shawnee Kish, Edmonton-based singer-songwriter"
