When she was five, the family moved east to the small town of Napanee (40 km west of Kingston). She played hockey with the boys, sung in her church choir, and taught herself the guitar. Impressed with her singing skills her father bought her musical equipment: microphone, drum kit, keyboard, and guitars. Eventually, their basement was converted into a studio. Her parents took her to sing karaoke during her teens.\n\nIn 1997, 14-year-old Lavigne entered a radio contest to perform with Shania Twain at a concert in Ottawa attended by 20 thousand people. She won. Before she knew it, she was up on stage with the country diva. Avril corrected Shania by saying she was from Napanee not Nepean (suburb of Ottawa). The two sang a duet: “What Made You Say That”. Later on, when Avril became an international superstar, Shania mentioned in an interview, in a vivid state of shock, that this was the same teenage girl who appeared with her on stage and had told her that she wanted to be a famous singer. “Oh, my God! Oh, my God!” Twain said in disbelief.\n\nClose to Christmas in 1999, while singing country songs in karaoke at Kingston’s Chapters bookstore, Lavigne was discovered by Cliff Fabri of Romanline Entertainment who became her manager. She took part in a number of music festivals and singing contests, performing songs by Garth Brooks, Shania Twain, and The Dixie Chicks. She also began composing her own songs. After a performance with the Lennox Community Theatre, she was invited by folk artist Steve Medd, to contribute vocals on two of his albums.\n\nFabri shepherded Avril through practice sessions in her parents’ basement and sent out VHS tapes of her home performances to several record companies. Nettwerk Records’ Mark Jowett, the man who had discovered Sarah McLachlan, invited Avril to work with Peter Zizzo in New York during the summer of 2000.\n\nSuperstardom\n\nIn 2001, Fabri took Avril on her second trip to New York to meet with executives of Arista Records. After a three-song audition, Antonio Reid and Ken Krongard were so impressed that they immediately signed her.\n\nLavigne was sent to Los Angeles to co-write songs with expert songwriting team “The Matrix”, among others. The result was 2002’s Let Go. Spawning three Top 5 singles, the album went diamond in three countries, including Canada, and sold 17 million copies worldwide. It was declared album of the year at the Junos, and the single “Complicated”, which appeared on the year-end Billboard chart at #11 and the decade-end chart at #83, won the song of the year Juno. “Weird” Al Yankovic did a parody of the song. In a piece of trivia, Lavigne became the youngest artist to score a #1 album in the United Kingdom. In the U.S. she was nominated for eight Grammy awards. The following year, she made the cover of Rolling Stone magazine and cover of Maxim in 2004.\n\nLavigne co-wrote the song “Breakaway” for the winner of the first season of American Idol, Kelly Clarkson, a #3 hit in Canada and #6 in the U.S.\n\nIn 2004, fellow Canadian singer-songwriter Chantal Kreviazuk joined the team, and her husband Raine Maida co-produced Under My Skin. It topped the charts in several countries and sold 10 million copies, including half a million at home. To promote the album, Avril embarked on her first world tour. As with her debut, the album spawned three Top 5 singles. She was proclaimed artist of the year at the Junos.\n\nIn 2006, Entertainment Group approached Avril to compose a song for the film Eragon. She wrote and recorded “Keep Holding On”, which made the Billboard year-end chart.\n\nThe Best Damn Thing, Lavigne’s third album, was released under RCA in 2007. “Girlfriend” became her biggest hit internationally, topping the charts in many countries. In the U.S. it became the 94th biggest song of the entire decade. She recorded the song in several different languages including English, French, Chinese, Italian, Japanese, Spanish, German, and Portuguese. It was ranked as the most downloaded song of the year. The English music video on Youtube has been viewed over 250 million times. Lavigne scored a diamond hat trick in Japan as this was her third album to sell a million copies there.\n\nIt took four years before Avril released a new album. After ending her marriage, performing at the Vancouver Olympics, and writing a song for Tim Burton’s Alice in Wonderland (“Alice”), Goodbye Lullaby hit store shelves in March, 2011. She appeared on many chat, variety, and reality shows performing the first single “What the Hell”, a Top 5 hit (see below). She went on a world tour to promote the album, tackling one continent at a time. In 2013, Avril married Nickelback frontman Chad Kroeger and they worked together on her fifth self-titled album which spawned three Top 40 hits."
