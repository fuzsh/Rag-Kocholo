        "text": "\"Hey, hey, you, you!\" There's simply no debate: when it comes to the world of pop-punk, Avril Lavigne has always been the people's princess. Bursting onto the scene with her 2002 debut Let Go, the then-teen singer/songwriter was dubbed an overnight sensation with hits like \"Complicated,\" \"Sk8er Boi\" and \"I'm With You.\"She soon became one of the primary artists driving the pop-punk explosion of the 2000s — and remains one of the genre's primary legends more than 20 years later.\n\nLavigne's appeal went far beyond the mass of skaters and suburban kids who devoured her early music. Within months of Let Go's release, she had earned five GRAMMY nominations (tying fellow newcomer Norah Jones for the most nods of 2003) and a year later, she racked up three more.\n\nAs pop-punk's first wave began to crest, the singer broadened her sights beyond the genre she'd helped pioneer, exploring everything from power pop to confessional alt-rock to Christian rock, as well as collaborations with artists as varied as Marilyn Manson and Nicki Minaj. And when pop-punk's second wave hit at the start of the 2020s, Lavigne made a triumphant return to the genre with 2022's Love Sux and the 20th anniversary reissue of Let Go.\n\nNow, she's set to release her first-ever Greatest Hits compilation on June 21, spanning more than two decades, seven albums and nearly two dozen hits on the Billboard Hot 100. To commemorate the album (and its coinciding Greatest Hits Tour), dive into 15 tracks that assert Lavigne's undeniable title as the \"motherf—in princess\" of pop-punk — from hits like \"Sk8er Boi\" to deep cuts like \"Freak Out.\"\n\n\"Complicated,\" 'Let Go' (2002)\n\nWhat better way to begin than with the song that started it all? Released as her debut single in the spring of 2002, \"Complicated\" declared a then-17-year-old Avril Lavigne as a major talent to watch.\n\nEventually, the pop-rock ode to teenaged authenticity became one of the biggest songs of the year, and led to her debut full-length, Let Go, becoming the third highest-selling LP of 2002 in the U.S. (It's since been certified 3x platinum by the RIAA and sold more than 16 million copies around the world.)\n\nIt's hard to overstate just how influential Lavigne's breakout year was, starting with \"Complicated.\" The track peaked at No. 2 on the Hot 100, helping the newcomer earn nominations for Best New Artist, Song Of The Year, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Best Pop Vocal Album (for Let Go) at the 2003 GRAMMY Awards. Its runaway success also helped launch pop-punk's explosion into the mainstream, and the proliferation of artists and female-fronted bands that followed — from Paramore, Ashlee Simpson and Kelly Clarkson to Gen Z hitmakers like Olivia Rodrigo, Billie Eilish and Meet Me @ The Altar — are indebted to Lavigne's trailblazing success with the song.\n\nRead More: Why 2002 Was The Year That Made Pop-Punk: Simple Plan, Good Charlotte & More On How \"Messing Around And Being Ourselves\" Became Mainstream\n\n\"Sk8er Boi,\" 'Let Go' (2002)\n\n\"He was a boy, she was a girl, can I make it any more obvious?\" From those 15 words, Lavigne spun a pop-punk fairy tale for the ages.\n\nIf \"Complicated\" was an introduction to her talent, \"Sk8er Boi\" was the new star's real coronation as the reigning princess of the genre. Everything about Let Go's second single is nothing short of iconic, from the star-crossed love story between a skater destined for punk rock greatness and the ballet dancer who wasn't brave enough to love him, to the lip ring and striped tie Lavigne sported in the music video (the latter of which you can still purchase to this day from her official store).\n\n\"Sk8er Boi\" dispelled any notion that the teenage upstart would be a flash in the pan relegated to one-hit wonder status. In fact, the song notched Lavigne a second consecutive Top 10 hit on the Hot 100, and landed her a fifth GRAMMY nomination at the 2003 ceremony, for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. But the cherry on top of it all? The eleventh hour twist in the track's bridge that the ballet dancer's loss was Avril's gain.\n\n\"My Happy Ending,\" 'Under My Skin' (2004)\n\nAfter all the commercial success and critical acclaim showered on her in the wake of Let Go, Lavigne chose to forgo taking the easy road with another pop-infused mainstream win. Instead, she plunged into the darkness for 2004's Under My Skin, exploring post-grunge, nu metal and even hard rock influences on the punk-infused LP. The biggest hit from the album was second single \"My Happy Ending,\" which became Lavigne's fourth No. 1 at Top 40 radio and spent four weeks in the Top 10 of the Hot 100, peaking even higher on the latter than \"Sk8er Boi\" had two years prior.\n\nThe downcast breakup anthem was the first time Lavigne put her broken heart on display (\"All this time you were pretending/ So much for my happy ending,\" she lamented as the piano-driven verses swirled into a guitar-heavy chorus), and the result was an electric kiss-off delivered with equal parts anger, shock and a tinge of bitter sarcasm.\n\nThe singer may not have gotten her happily ever after, but turning the doomed relationship into a scathing goodbye certainly earned her the last laugh: the song helped propel Under My Skin to becoming one of the top-selling albums of the year worldwide.\n\nRead More: Loving Olivia Rodrigo's \"Vampire\"?

Lavigne proved she was equally adept at bouncing back from a particularly disappointing Sk8er Boi with a devilish grin and a chip on her shoulder on the bouncing \"He Wasn't.\"\n\nWhile the brash ditty wasn't officially released as a single in the U.S. — instead being pushed to radio in Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia, and her native Canada — it quickly became a fan favorite from the album. Nearly 20 years on, the song and its rowdy music video (come for Avril wearing fairy wings and a bright pink tutu, stay for her shattering a camera with the butt of her guitar) rather perfectly encapsulate the singer's place as one of the rare female voices at the forefront of the second-wave post-grunge movement.\n\n\"Freak Out,\" 'Under My Skin' (2004)\n\nGiving authority figures the middle finger has long been a hallmark of Lavigne's brand, and nowhere is that more clear than on Under My Skin deep cut \"Freak Out.\" \"Try to tell me what I shouldn't do/ You should know by now I won't listen to you,\" she scowls before ratcheting up the lyrical drama on the booming chorus.\n\nThe track's second verse serves as a veritable manifesto for an entire generation of emo kids, as Lavigne offers the following advice to her fans: \"You don't always have to do everything right/ Stand up for yourself and put up a fight/ Walk around with your hands up in the air/ Like you don't care.\" When in doubt? \"Just freak out, let it go.\"\n\nIn retrospect, Under My Skin is often rightfully credited as one of the defining albums of pop-punk's 2000s heyday. And it's clear Lavigne is proud of the album's impact on both her career and the genre she helped pioneer, considering four of its singles — including \"Don't Tell Me\" and \"Nobody's Home\" — are included in the 20 tracks featured on her upcoming Greatest Hits compilation.\n\n\"Girlfriend,\" 'The Best Damn Thing' (2007)\n\nLavigne turned the power pop up to 11 for her third album, 2007's The Best Damn Thing, and traded the myopic grunge of her previous era for a blast of sugar-coated, self-confident sass. Lead single \"Girlfriend\" let the singer unleash her inner pop-punk princess like never before, as she played a mean girl with a flirtatious streak who somehow made stealing another girl's man seem lovable.\n\nThe unabashed bop was the first time Lavigne proudly declared herself \"the motherf—in' princess,\" and the song's relentless sing-song hook was so addictive that it became the star's first single to top the Hot 100. Lavigne broke several records with \"Girlfriend,\" which became one of the best-selling songs of 2007 and the most-viewed YouTube video of 2008 — as well as the first to ever reach 100 million views on the platform.\n\nStill can't get enough of \"Girlfriend\"? Hardcore fans know that the official remix with Lil Mama might even outdo the fizzy perfection of the original.\n\n\"The Best Damn Thing,\" 'The Best Damn Thing' (2007)\n\nFor the title track off The Best Damn Thing, Lavigne doubled down on the bright and bubbly persona she'd donned on \"Girlfriend.\" In fact, the song's opening rallying cry of \"Let me hear you say hey, hey, hey!\" and a call-and-response bridge are so downright peppy that it seems almost hard to believe they came from the same artist who thrashed her way through Under My Skin.\n\nReleased as The Best Damn Thing's fourth and final single, the song of the same name is more melodic than its chart-topping predecessor, with Lavigne unapologetically laying out the type of treatment she expects from a man in cheerleader fashion (\"Gimme an A! Always give me what I want!/ Gimme a V! Be very, very good to me!\"). After all, a pop-punk princess deserves a Cinderella story of her own.\n\n\"What the Hell,\" 'Goodbye Lullaby' (2011)\n\nRiding high off the commercial success of The Best Damn Thing, Lavigne kicked off the rollout for her fourth studio album, 2011's Goodbye Lullaby, with \"What the Hell,\" a playfully bratty banger that found her toying with a love interest and vowing, \"All my life I've been good/ But now I'm thinking, 'What the hell!'\"\n\nProduced and co-written by pop impresarios Max Martin and Shellback, \"What the Hell\" melded Lavigne's snarky songwriting sensibilities and penchant for bucking authority with a catchy, singalong refrain. But the lead single actually proved to be something of an outlier on the pop-punk princess' fourth go-around, as the rest of the album utilized a stripped-back sonic palette to lay her heartbreak bare in the wake of divorcing Sum 41 frontman Deryck Whibley.\n\n\"Bad Reputation,\" 'Goodbye Lullaby' (2011)\n\nGoodbye Lullaby may have been Lavigne's first foray into a more acoustic sound — complete with introspective lyrics and surprisingly sincere song titles like \"I Love You\" and \"Everybody Hurts\" — but she couldn't resist adding a little snarl to the album's softer, more sensitive proceedings. So for the deluxe edition of the album, she featured her take on Joan Jett's classic 1980 single \"Bad Reputation\" as a bonus track.\n\nLavigne had originally recorded \"Bad Reputation\" for the soundtrack to the Japanese anime feature film One Piece Film: Z (it even reached the top 10 on Japan's Hot 100!). But she apparently liked the cover so much that it ended up on the track list of not one, but two of her albums, as the song was also included on 2013's Avril Lavigne.\n\n\"Here's to Never Growing Up,\" 'Avril Lavigne' (2013)\n\nEven as she approached her thirties, Lavigne wasn't about to give up her spot as pop-rock's resident wild child. Case in point: \"Here's to Never Growing Up,\" the lead single off her fifth album, 2013's Avril Lavigne. Over a peppy stomp-clap rhythm, the singer shouts out an undying love of Radiohead, dancing on bar tops and making late-night memories with your best friends as the boombox blares all your favorite songs.\n\nThere's a thread of bittersweet nostalgia running through the midtempo jam — one that's sure to pierce the heart of any millennial listening as Lavinge sings, \"Say, won't you say 'forever'?/ Stay, if you stay forever/ Hey, we can stay forever young.\" It's not that the singer's refusing to acknowledge the cruel act of getting older on the track, she's just rebelling against the notion that adulthood should be a dreary slog of, you know, taxes and laundry and all of those lame adult responsibilities.\n\n\"Rock N Roll,\" 'Avril Lavigne' (2013)\n\nLavigne once again put her middle finger to the sky and re-upped her rock star credentials on the appropriately titled \"Rock N Roll,\" the second single off her self-titled album. The spirited singalong finds the singer reveling in her eternally bad attitude as she wails, \"I don't care if I'm a misfit/ I like better than the hipster bulls–/ I am the motherf—in' princess/ You still love it.\"\n\nThough \"Rock N Roll\" didn't make quite as much of an impact on the charts as some of the other hits on this list, it remains one of the most underrated bangers in her entire discography. Plus, the song gifted fans with the campy, comic book-inspired music video starring Lavinge, Danica McKellar, a drunk-driving Doberman and one very unlucky lobster as they race across a dystopian wasteland to save rock and roll from the clutches of an evil bear-shark. (Billy Zane shows up on a rocket-powered Segway at some point, too — just go with it.)\n\n\"Head Above Water,\" 'Head Above Water' (2019)\n\nProving that pop-punk doesn't always have to come with an in-your-face, \"f— you!\" attitude, Lavigne released \"Head Above Water\" — the lead single and title track to her 2019 album — five years into an often confusing, devastating and all-consuming battle with Lyme disease.\n\n\"One night I thought I was dying, and I had accepted that I was going to die,\" she revealed at the time of the song's unveiling. \"My mom laid with me in bed and held me. I felt like I was drowning. Under my breath, I prayed, 'God, please help to keep my head above the water.' In that moment, the songwriting of this album began.\"\n\nLavigne taps into a truly admirable well of resilience and hope on the spiritual ballad as she sings, \"Yeah, my life is what I'm fighting for/ Can't part the sea, can't reach the shore/ And my voice becomes the driving force/ I won't let this pull me overboard.\" Unlike anything that's come from the singer's catalog either before or since, \"Head Above Water\" remains a powerful testament to the beloved pop-punk princess' inner strength.\n\n\"Bite Me,\" 'Love Sux' (2022)\n\nAs the 2010s gave way to a new decade, pop-punk made a surprise resurgence in popularity while Lavigne was making major moves of her own; she left BMG after just one album to sign with Travis Barker's DTA Records in 2021 (about which she fittingly declared, \"Let's f— s— up!\"). Partnering with the blink-182 drummer sparked some serious magic in the studio, as her seventh studio album, 2022's Love Sux was a wildly entertaining return to her pop-punk roots after the emotional catharsis of Head Over Water.\n\nOn lead single \"Bite Me,\" Lavigne effortlessly dusted off her crown and reclaimed her throne with an octave-jumping vocal performance. Along with proving she still has the chops, the singer simply sounds like she's having a hell of a lot of fun as she snaps back at an ex-flame who made the mistake of crossing her. Pop-punk's reigning princess? Try queen.\n\nRead More: How 'Love Sux' Led Avril Lavigne To True Love, Her First Fangirl Moment And An Album Process That Was 'Just Stupid Fun'\n\n\"All I Wanted\" feat. Mark Hoppus, 'Love Sux' (2022)\n\nLavigne collaborated with plenty of special guests on Love Sux, from blackbear (on love-drunk single \"Love It When You Hate Me\") to eventual tourmate Machine Gun Kelly (on delicious battle of the sexes \"Bois Lie\"), but no other duet on the album holds a candle to \"All I Wanted\" featuring blink-182's Mark Hoppus.\n\nThe supercharged deep cut features the two trailblazers rocking out in a whirling dervish of escapist bliss, playing a sort of pop-punk Bonnie and Clyde as they bust out of the town they're stuck in. And in doing so, they proved they're more than happy to show the new kids at the rock show just how it's done.\n\n\"Breakaway,\" 'Let Go (20th Anniversary Edition)' (2022)\n\nAnd finally, a proper celebration of Lavigne's status as pop-punk royalty wouldn't be complete without including the biggest song she ever gave to another artist. As the story goes, the singer/songwriter originally penned \"Breakaway\" for her debut album, but the hope-filled anthem didn't quite fit with the vibe of Let Go tracks like \"Complicated,\" \"Sk8er Boi,\" \"Losing Grip,\" and \"I'm With You.\" So instead, she gave it to a fresh-faced newcomer by the name of Kelly Clarkson, who had just come off of winning a little reality TV experiment called \"American Idol.\"\n\nAfter being featured on the soundtrack to The Princess Diaries 2, \"Breakaway\" became the centerpiece and title track of Clarkson's 2004 sophomore album, which helped turn her into a bonafide superstar — and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nLavigne started performing the song live for the first time on her 2019 Head Above Water Tour, which naturally left fans clamoring for a studio version. Blessedly, the pop-punk icon gave them exactly what they wanted by revisiting \"Breakaway\" in the recording studio for the 20th anniversary edition of Let Go in 2022. She even reinstated her original lyrics in the opening stanza (\"Grew up in a small town/ And when the snow would fall down/ I'd just stare out my window\") for a personal touch that connected back to her roots in Greater Napanee, Ontario.\n\nClarkson may have made the song famous, but the beating heart of \"Breakaway\" will always be Lavigne's story — one of a small-town girl who bet on herself, only to become a trailblazing artist whose legacy is forever cemented in the pop-punk history books.\n\nThe State Of Pop-Punk: A Roundtable Unpacks The Genre's Past, Present And Future\n\nSince the 2021 release of SOUR, critics and listeners alike have touted Olivia Rodrigo for her knack to eloquently pen the relatable woes of adolescence and the pitfalls of falling in love too hard. Her latest single, \"vampire,\" is no different.\n\nDespite trading in her \"drivers license\" teenage loverboy for an older man, the perfectly executed expression of agony remains. As Rodrigo wails on the chorus, \"You made me look so naïve/ The way you sold me for parts/ As you suck your teeth into me/ Bloodsucker, famef—er/ Bleeding me dry like a g——n vampire.\"\n\nBut before there was Rodrigo, there was Avril Lavigne, Taylor Swift, and Alanis Morissette — none of which would be where they were without pioneers of diaristic songwriting, Carole King and Carly Simon. Thanks to the immortalization of their music, we can relive the shift from poetic disclosures of hurt, which King exemplifies on \"It's Too Late,\" to more unrepentant, straightforward jabs (like Kate Nash says on \"Foundations,\" \"Don't want to look at your face 'cause it's making me sick\") and harrowing battle cries (as Miley Cyrus roars, \"I came in like a wrecking ball\").\n\nBelow, revisit 15 songs by empowered women, from 1971 all the way to 2021, who reclaimed the breakup narrative with their fervent sentences of damnation — because, as the age-old saying goes, hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.\n\nCarole King — \"It's Too Late\" (1971)\n\nWhen Carole King released \"It's Too Late\" in 1971, it marked a new era of songwriting. Discussions about divorce were generally unheard of, but even more so when initiated by a woman. Yet, King carried on to unapologetically release \"It's Too Late,\" which later won a GRAMMY for Record of the Year and is lauded by Rolling Stone as one of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\nOn this folky track, King and her husband's inevitable parting is on the horizon, but she isn't resentful per se. Instead, she's more troubled by the embarrassment of her husband's growing discontent, admitting, \"I feel like a fool.\" And at this point, she's ready to move on and can be grateful for the times they've shared.\n\nCarly Simon — \"You're So Vain\" (1972)\n\nIn her '70s chart-topper, Carly Simon narrates the tale of an arrogant man who believes every woman is enchanted by his aura. But the folk songstress wants to make it very clear she's not impressed by his embellished stories or luxurious closet.\n\nUsually, it's easy to guess the subject of a breakup song, but \"You're So Vain\" has led to decades of speculation. Many have assumed it could be about James Taylor, who Simon married in 1972 and divorced in 1983, or Mick Jagger, who provided vocals to the track (a theory that was later debunked). To this day, she has only revealed the track's inspiration to a select few, including Taylor Swift, who names Simon as one of her role models.\n\nJoan Jett And The Blackhearts — \"I Hate Myself For Loving You\" (1986)\n\nJoan Jett might not give a damn about her bad reputation, but she despises nothing more than her ex-lover making her look like a lovesick fool.\n\nOn \"I Hate Myself for Loving You,\" the '80s chanteuse wraps herself around a classic glam rock beat, unveiling her contempt for a man who's neglected her. Stripped of her pride, Jett begins to resent herself for holding onto her feelings — as evidenced by the song's title.\n\nShe tries to hide her dwelling desires (\"I want to walk, but I run back to you\") but ultimately fails to rid herself of the emotions, leaving her to fantasize about the sweet justice of one day roping him back in, just to leave him.\n\nAlanis Morissette — \"You Oughta Know\" (1995)\n\nIt's impossible to talk about scathing breakup songs without acknowledging Alanis Morissette's quintessential heartbreak anthem, \"You Oughta Know.\" At the time of its release, the Jagged Little Pill single contained some of the most honest and vitriolic lyrics in existence.\n\nMorissette begins with an illusive statement, \"I want you to know that I'm happy for you,\" which, by the second verse, crumbles into a revelation, \"I'm not quite as well, you should know.\" As she culminates into her most confessional, the instrumental rises into an addicting ruckus, with Morissette revealing the thoughts most of us would be too ashamed to admit: \"It was a slap in the face how quickly I was replaced/ And are you thinkin' of me when you f— her?\"\n\nShania Twain — \"That Don't Impress Me Much\" (1997)\n\nShania Twain has a particular superpower of delivering each of her lyrics with an air of lightheartedness and confidence. So, when you hear a track like \"That Don't Impress Me Much,\" her disappointment and irritation becomes undetectable.\n\nA quick examination of Twain's story proves — despite the song's bouncy melodies — she's jaded by her ex's preoccupation with his vehicle, appearance and intelligence. Sure, he might be perfect on paper, but he lacks the qualities of a forever lover, and his unmerited ego should be reserved for true big shots like Elvis Presley and Brad Pitt.\n\nMichelle Branch — \"Are You Happy Now?\" (2003)\n\nIn the opening verse of \"Are You Happy Now?,\" Michelle Branch pleads, \"No, don't just walk away/ Pretending everything's okay, and you don't care about me.\" At first, she is in disbelief that her once admirer would swiftly brush her off, but as she reaches the chorus, she begins to question whether his actions were a lie all along.\n\nHer mind racing, Branch teeters between shameless questions of \"Do you really have everything you want?\" and \"Could you look me in the eye and tell me you're happy now?\" But by the song's end, she gets the most satisfying payback of all — peace without him: \"I'm not about to break/ 'Cause I'm happy now.\"\n\nAvril Lavigne — \"My Happy Ending\" (2004)\n\n\"My Happy Ending\" finds 2000s pop-punk maven Avril Lavigne grasping onto the shards of a broken relationship and trying to pinpoint where everything went wrong. She could have said the \"wrong\" thing, or her partner's misfit friends might have spoken negatively about her. But there is one thing she does know with certainty: there is no way to pick up the pieces.\n\nComing to terms with the truth, Lavigne repositions her anger toward the other person for stripping her of her fairytale ending, sarcastically acknowledging him for their time spent together over a somber piano: \"It's nice to know you were there/ Thanks for acting like you care/ And making me feel like I was the only one.\"\n\nKelly Clarkson — \"Gone\" (2004)\n\nKelly Clarkson has traversed almost every emotion in love, from her epic breakup anthems like \"Behind These Hazel Eyes\" to her most recent LP chemistry. But \"Gone\" may just be her most unrelenting to date.\n\nIntroduced by its Breakaway counterpart \"Since U Been Gone,\" the mononymous \"Gone\" extends Clarkson's journey of healing — this time, with a more explicit and mature diatribe against her ex's character. Rather than using trivial attacks, Clarkson instead chooses to call out his assumption she'd run back into his arms, later declaring an end to her toleration: \"There is nothing you can say/ Sorry doesn't cut it, babe/ Take the hit and walk away, 'cause I'm gone.\"\n\nLily Allen — \"Smile\" (2006)\n\nWith \"Smile,\" Lily Allen gets her sweet revenge through the sight of her former flame's tears and misfortune. But the lyrics of Allen's breakthrough single doesn't exactly clarify the specifications of her antics, only an explanation for its origins.\n\nAfter a cheating scandal ends her relationship, her mental health plummets — until he comes crawling back for her mercy. Upon hearing his pleas, she comes to a realization: \"When I see you cry, it makes me smile.\" And as the conniving music video shows, anyone who cheats on her will get their karma — perhaps in the form of organized burglary, beatings, and a laxative slipped into their morning coffee.\n\nKate Nash — \"Foundations\" (2007)\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of her mentor Lily Allen, Kate Nash vividly paints the tragedy of falling out of love, made prismatic by her plain-spoken lyrics (\"Your face is pasty 'cause you've gone and got so wasted, what a surprise!\") and her charming, thick London accent.\n\nIn this story, Nash has not quite removed herself from the shackles of her failing relationship. In fact, she'd like to salvage it, despite her boyfriend's tendency to humiliate her and her irresistible urge to sneer back with a sarcastic comment. By the end of the track, Nash, becoming more restless, packs on new ways to inconvenience him — but in the end, still wonders if there's any saving grace to preserve their once blazing spark out of a fear of loneliness.\n\nP!nk — \"So What\" (2008)\n\nThe year P!nk wrote \"So What,\" she already had a bevy of platinum singles under her belt. With a gleaming social status and peaking career, she was apathetic to the temporary separation from her now husband, Carey Hart. Feeling the highs of newfound singlehood, P!nk was ready to incite personal tyranny, whether that meant not paying Hart's rent, drinking her money, or starting a fight.\n\nIronically, Hart appears as the antagonist in the music video, which P!nk revealed via her official fan website was a testament of their growth: \"Carey hadn't heard the song before he did the video. That's how much he trusts and loves me [...] He gets it. He gets me,\" she said.\n\nTaylor Swift — \"Picture To Burn\" (2006)\n\nTaylor Swift has long solidified herself as the reigning queen of love songs, from ballads honoring the most committed relationships to diss tracks of heartbreaking adolescent flings. The latter houses one of the earliest (and most twangy) hits in Swift's sweeping catalog: \"Picture to Burn.\"\n\nIn this deceivingly upbeat tune, Swift vows to seek vengeance on a boyfriend after he leaves her to date one of her friends — from getting with his friends to having her father give him a piece of his mind. And along the way, she will gladly dish out a few insults: \"You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying/ So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time/ As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn.\"\n\nMiley Cyrus — \"Wrecking Ball\" (2013)\n\nClosing the door on her Hannah Montana days, Miley Cyrus' \"Wrecking Ball\" saw the childhood pop star in her most grown-up and vulnerable state to date. Months before the release, Cyrus had called off her engagement to her longtime boyfriend, Liam Hemsworth, paving the way for her thunderous performance on the Bangerz single.\n\nJust as affecting as Cyrus' belting vocals is the track's iconic music video. Cyrus climaxes with a deafening cry — \"All you did was wreck me\" — as she swings across the screen on an actual wrecking ball, breaking down all her physical and metaphorical walls.\n\nHalsey — \"You should be sad\" (2020)\n\nBy the mid-2010s, the industry had put angst on the back burner in exchange for feel-good EDM and trap beats. Well, that is, at least, until Halsey entered the picture.\n\nAfter just two years in the limelight, Halsey had cultivated a vibrant assortment of sonic melodrama — from the dirt and grime of toxic, failed love on tracks \"Bad at Love\" and \"Colors\" to the Bonnie and Clyde-esque heated passion of \"Him & I.\"\n\nIn 2020, Halsey rounded out her discography with the genre-bending, introspective Manic, where a track like \"You should be sad\" commands your attention with matter-of-fact, vindictive comments: \"I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you/ 'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you.\"\n\nGAYLE — \"abcdefu\" (2021)\n\nUnlike most love songs, GAYLE refuses to point her fury on \"abcdefu\" solely toward her heartbreaker. The then-16-year-old singer, instead, rages against his mother, sister and pretty much anyone (and anything) he's associated with — other than his dog — across a searing melody with a bewitching bassline.\n\nEarlier this year, GAYLE revealed to GRAMMY.com that she was \"angry at him and was angry at the people who enabled him and his behavior.\" That animosity was palpable in \"abcdefu,\" creating a magic as empowering as it is cathartic — and, like many songs that came before it, proving that there can be power in pain.\n\nBehind The Scenes Of The Eras Tour: Taylor Swift's Opening Acts Unveil The Magic Of The Sensational Concert\n\nIt's rare that a genre can be traced back to a single artist or group, but for funk, that was James Brown. The Godfather of Soul coined the phrase and style of playing known as \"on the one,\" where the first downbeat is emphasized, instead of the typical second and fourth beats in pop, soul and other styles. As David Cheal eloquently explains, playing on the one \"left space for phrases and riffs, often syncopated around the beat, creating an intricate, interlocking grid which could go on and on.\" You know a funky bassline when you hear it; its fat chords beg your body to get up and groove.\n\nBrown's 1965 classic, \"Papa's Got a Brand New Bag,\" became one of the first funk hits, and has been endlessly sampled and covered over the years, along with his other groovy tracks. Of course, many other funk acts followed in the '60s, and the genre thrived in the '70s and '80s as the disco craze came and went, and the originators of hip-hop and house music created new music from funk and disco's strong, flexible bones built for dancing.\n\nLegendary funk bassist Bootsy Collins learned the power of the one from playing in Brown's band, and brought it to George Clinton, who created P-funk, an expansive, Afrofuturistic, psychedelic exploration of funk with his various bands and projects, including Parliament-Funkadelic. Both Collins and Clinton remain active and funkin', and have offered their timeless grooves to collabs with younger artists, including Kali Uchis, Silk Sonic, and Omar Apollo; and Kendrick Lamar, Flying Lotus, and Thundercat, respectively.\n\nIn the 1980s, electro-funk was born when artists like Afrika Bambaataa, Man Parrish, and Egyptian Lover began making futuristic beats with the Roland TR-808 drum machine — often with robotic vocals distorted through a talk box. A key distinguishing factor of electro-funk is a de-emphasis on vocals, with more phrases than choruses and verses. The sound influenced contemporaneous hip-hop, funk and electronica, along with acts around the globe, while current acts like Chromeo, DJ Stingray, and even Egyptian Lover himself keep electro-funk alive and well.\n\nToday, funk lives in many places, with its heavy bass and syncopated grooves finding way into many nooks and crannies of music. There's nu-disco and boogie funk, nodding back to disco bands with soaring vocals and dance floor-designed instrumentation. G-funk continues to influence Los Angeles hip-hop, with innovative artists like Dam-Funk and Channel Tres bringing the funk and G-funk, into electro territory. Funk and disco-centered '70s revival is definitely having a moment, with acts like Ghost Funk Orchestra and Parcels, while its sparkly sprinklings can be heard in pop from Dua Lipa, Doja Cat, and, in full \"Soul Train\" character, Silk Sonic. There are also acts making dreamy, atmospheric music with a solid dose of funk, such as Khruangbin’s global sonic collage.\n\nThere are many bands that play heavily with funk, creating lush grooves designed to get you moving. Read on for a taste of five current modern funk and nu-disco artists making band-led uptempo funk built for the dance floor.

Their '70s girl group-inspired vocal harmonies echo, sooth and enchant as they cover poignant topics with feminist flair.\n\nWhile they’ve been active in the New York scene for a few years, they’ve gained wider acclaim for the irresistible music they began releasing this year, including their debut album, Prism. Their 2022 debut single \"Forget Me Not\" is an ode to ground-breaking New York art collective Guerilla Girls, and \"Norma\" is their protest anthem in response to the news that Roe vs. Wade could be (and was) overturned. The band name is a nod to funk legend Nile Rodgers, from the \"Le freak, c'est chi\" exclamation in Chic's legendary tune \"Le Freak.\"\n\nMoniquea\n\nMoniquea's unique voice oozes confidence, yet invites you in to dance with her to the super funky boogie rhythms. The Pasadena, California artist was raised on funk music; her mom was in a cover band that would play classics like Aretha Franklin’s \"Get It Right\" and Gladys Knight’s \"Love Overboard.\" Moniquea released her first boogie funk track at 20 and, in 2011, met local producer XL Middelton — a bonafide purveyor of funk. She's been a star artist on his MoFunk Records ever since, and they've collabed on countless tracks, channeling West Coast energy with a heavy dose of G-funk, sunny lyrics and upbeat, roller disco-ready rhythms.\n\nHer latest release is an upbeat nod to classic West Coast funk, produced by Middleton, and follows her February 2022 groovy, collab-filled album, On Repeat.\n\nShiro Schwarz\n\nShiro Schwarz is a Mexico City-based duo, consisting of Pammela Rojas and Rafael Marfil, who helped establish a modern funk scene in the richly creative Mexican metropolis. On \"Electrify\" — originally released in 2016 on Fat Beats Records and reissued in 2021 by MoFunk — Shiro Schwarz's vocals playfully contrast each other, floating over an insistent, upbeat bassline and an '80s throwback electro-funk rhythm with synth flourishes.\n\nTheir music manages to be both nostalgic and futuristic — and impossible to sit still to. 2021 single \"Be Kind\" is sweet, mellow and groovy, perfect chic lounge funk. Shiro Schwarz’s latest track, the joyfully nostalgic \"Hey DJ,\" is a collab with funkstress Saucy Lady and U-Key.\n\nL'Impératrice\n\nL'Impératrice (the empress in French) are a six-piece Parisian group serving an infectiously joyful blend of French pop, nu-disco, funk and psychedelia. Flore Benguigui's vocals are light and dreamy, yet commanding of your attention, while lyrics have a feminist touch.\n\nDuring their energetic live sets, L'Impératrice members Charles de Boisseguin and Hagni Gwon (keys), David Gaugué (bass), Achille Trocellier (guitar), and Tom Daveau (drums) deliver extended instrumental jam sessions to expand and connect their music. Gaugué emphasizes the thick funky bass, and Benguigui jumps around the stage while sounding like an angel. L’Impératrice’s latest album, 2021’s Tako Tsubo, is a sunny, playful French disco journey.\n\nFranc Moody\n\nFranc Moody's bio fittingly describes their music as \"a soul funk and cosmic disco sound.\" The London outfit was birthed by friends Ned Franc and Jon Moody in the early 2010s, when they were living together and throwing parties in North London's warehouse scene. In 2017, the group grew to six members, including singer and multi-instrumentalist Amber-Simone.\n\nTheir music feels at home with other electro-pop bands like fellow Londoners Jungle and Aussie act Parcels. While much of it is upbeat and euphoric, Franc Moody also dips into the more chilled, dreamy realm, such as the vibey, sultry title track from their recently released Into the Ether.\n\nThe Rise Of Underground House: How Artists Like Fisher & Acraze Have Taken Tech House, Other Electronic Genres From Indie To EDC"
