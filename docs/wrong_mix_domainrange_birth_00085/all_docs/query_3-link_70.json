        "text": "Blake Lively continues to serve looks as she populates her Instagram page with one iconic post after another. The Gossip Girl alum channeled Britney Spears in her latest post, featuring snaps from a night out with It Ends With Us co-stars and friends.\n\n\"You say Canadian Prom Dress, I say It‚Äôs Britney Bi***.\"\n\nThe actress donned a sparkly, denim mini dress complete with a denim trench coat, denim purse, and matching heels for co-star Brandon Sklenar's birthday. The first snap in the \"Oops I Did It Again\" era series features Lively walking along a sidewalk, smiling as she struts into the venue with her all-denim fit. As the carousel continues, followers are invited into It Ends With Us after hours, depicting fun times with friends at dinner.\n\nThe beloved mother-of-four also shouted out a few of her favorite co-stars and fashion statements in the caption stating:\n\n\"Happy belated birthday to @brandonsklenar We had so much fun celebrating with all the @itendswithusmovie cast who was in town... @isabela.ferrer making my ‚ÄúMy Size Barbie‚Äù dreams come true, letting me dress her up for the night. I‚Äôm still ü§§over all the @storrowjewelry layered necklaces and charms.\"\n\nLively was also sure to spotlight a handful of paparazzi photos from the outing, noting that she doesn't do this often but these particular paparazzi \"leave my kids alone so they have my respect.\"\n\nSee The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants standout thrive in denim-on-denim-on-denim below!"
