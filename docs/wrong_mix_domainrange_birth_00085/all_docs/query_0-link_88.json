        "text": "$42.00 Per Person\n\nIncluding fees & charges\n\nFrom rocking Halifax’s Marquee Club to performing for the masses at Massey Hall or touring the country with his father, Joel Plaskett has forged a reputation as one of Canada’s most engaging performers and respected singer-songwriters.\n\nPlaskett’s songs are a perennial part of the national playlist, a fixture on “best of” lists, and the soundtrack to the lives of faithful fans across the country and around the world. His accolades over a quarter century include a Juno, numerous East Coast Music, Canadian Folk and Music Nova Scotia awards, and two Polaris short list nominations.\n\nPlaskett began his musical career in the early 1990s as a member of alt-rock favorites Thrush Hermit, recruiting lifelong fans as the band toured North America in a half-size school bus, setting up their signature neon ROCK & ROLL sign from show to show.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Plaskett started touring under his own name with his band, The Emergency (featuring Dave Marsh on drums since 1999, and for the last 14 years, Chris Pennell on bass). Backed by the Emergency and racking up a growing roster of anthemic singalongs, Plaskett worked his way up from small clubs to opening for Paul McCartney and the Tragically Hip and filling larger venues with his own devoted audience.\n\nPlaskett is a versatile and ever-evolving artist, at turns delivering intimate and idiosyncratic singer-songwriter fare (In Need of Medical Attention, La De Da, The Park Avenue Sobriety Test); incendiary riff-rock (Down at the Khyber, Truthfully, Truthfully), left-leaning folk rock (Solidarity), as well as conceptual epics and off-kilter feats of musical stamina (Ashtray Rock, Three, Scrappy Happiness, 44).\n\nRecorded to analog tape, Plaskett’s records reflect his attention to detail, his dedication to technique, musical history and craft, and a sincere and inimitable lyrical style that runs through his diverse and ever-expanding catalogue.\n\nIn addition to producing most of his own records since 1999, Plaskett has also set up shop behind the console at his New Scotland Yard studio in downtown Dartmouth, N.S. His work with artists like Jimmy Rankin, Two Hours Traffic, David Myles, Sarah Slean, Shotgun Jimmie, Dennis Ellsworth, Old Man Luedecke, Dave Marsh, Colleen Brown and longtime collaborator Mo Kenney has led to numerous awards for production and turned New Scotland Yard into a popular destination for artists looking to develop and document their sound.\n\nIn front of the studio is The New Scotland Yard Emporium, where Plaskett has partnered with Halifax mainstay Taz Records to bring a curated selection of records to his adopted hometown, providing a spot where music fans can congregate to grab a coffee or beer while they dig for records.\n\nIn a world increasingly connected—and disconnected — by digital mediums, Joel Plaskett prefers to make his connections the old-fashioned way, building community at his studio and shop, dedicating himself to the art and authenticity of songwriting and analog recording processes, and moving audiences with the electrifying, uplifting experience of live performance.\n\nIn all aspects of his work, Plaskett embraces both the communal and individual experiences music provides. The ways music and words combine to connect with the listener, turning a minute into a moment out of time, reminding us that we aren’t alone.\n\n$42.00 Per Person\n\nIncludes Fees & Charges\n\nRon Sexsmith is a three time Juno award winning songwriter from Canada. He has written and recorded seventeen acclaimed albums of original songs beginning with his self titled debut in 1995 up to his most recent ‘The Vivian Line’ in 2023.\n\nRon has toured the world many times over performing in such prestigious venues as Massey Hall, Carnegie Hall and London’s Royal Albert Hall.\n\nA child of melody, his music has been described as a hybrid of Canadian folk heroes such as Gordon Lightfoot and Leonard Cohen mingled with that of The Kinks, Beatles and other British invasion acts of his formative years.\n\nHis songs have been covered by many revered artists such as Rod Stewart, kd Lang, Emmylou Harris, Michael Buble, Feist and Elvis Costello to name only a few.\n\n“Sexsmith is a (Canadian) songwriter with a gift for an instantly seductive pop/folk/rock melody, a facile way with a lyrical narrative and the ability to produce really charming and sometimes deeply poignant turns-of-phrase” - THE CINCH REVIEW\n\n“When Sexsmith sings, he rarely places a note squarely on the beat. He eases into it a little ahead of time, or hesitates and lets it drift in late like a wallflower trying to slip into a party unnoticed” - John Pareles THE NEW YORK TIMES\n\n\"Melody remains the convulsive life-giving heart.You lose that, a tune withers facedown. Ron Sexsmith understands this point better than most every singer/songwriter working today” - Jason Killingsworth PASTE\n\n“Sexsmith has an incredible gift for pop melodies, and his voice is an unassuming croon that slides up and down to notes with graceful ease. He also just doesn't strum the guitar, he makes it sing. In short, he's an endangered species” - Marshall York SALON\n\n$49.00 Per Person\n\nIncluding fees & charges.\n\nComedy here there and everywhere tour presented by Alex Miller Comedy\n\nTwo of Canada's Juno winning comedic titans, Jon Dore (CBC's 'Humour Resources', The Jon Dore Television Show, & Conan) and Dave Merheje ('I Love You Habibi' Crave special, 'Sometimes I Think About Dying' [2024] & Hulu's 'Ramy') are bringing laughs coast to coast, featuring top acts from across the country, brought to you by Comedy Here Often? & SiriusXM Comedy Club.

With an emphasis on crowd interaction, Dawson's live set is one you simply do not want to miss out on. Between the steady mix of modern country, classic country, originals, and a high tempo-upbeat playing style, you will wish you brought more of your friends!\n\nHailing from the coastal town of White Rock, BC, Dawson Gray is a fresh and promising addition to Canada’s rising country music scene. Inspired by acts such as Morgan Wallen and Zach Bryan, Dawson embarked on his professional career in the summer of 2021 and has rapidly garnered attention as one of the best young talents in Canada. With an already impressive track record that includes multiple festival appearances, sold out concerts across Western Canada, and over 2-million worldwide streams, it's clear that Dawson Gray is going to be a well-known name in country music for a long time.\n\nGrowing up, Dawson devoted most of his time to chasing his dream of playing professional baseball. It wasn’t until his career was cut short in grade-12 due to an eye disorder, that he first picked up a guitar. Though music started as just a hobby to fill idle time at university, it quickly became much more than that for Dawson. Working alongside friend and fellow professional musician, Ben Dunnill, Dawson quickly realized he had a special talent for songwriting. In 2020, Dawson began writing his first batch of songs that would eventually lead to current singles like “Running Back Home” and “All She DId.”\n\nFor Dawson, it seems the best is still yet to come. With a busy 2024 schedule in his sights, Dawson has plans to release 8-new songs, including his long-awaited viral singles such as: “Have You Seen Her,” & \"Back To Leaving\" In addition, Dawson is planning a Western-Canada tour, featuring multiple other rising artists such as American Idol star Cameron Whitcomb, TikTok sensation Ben Dunnill, and many more. If ever there was an artist to keep your eye on, Dawson Gray is one to watch out for.\n\n$42.00 Per Person\n\nIncludes Fees & Charges\n\nForging the sound of the New Tradition, Daimh are West Highland Music’s proudest exponents. Daimh, the Gaelic word for Connection, perfectly describes the electrifying musical interplay between the individual band members and portrays the interaction with audiences attending their breath-taking live shows around the world. It also translates as the connection to the deep musical well from which they draw their inspiration. On the Scottish music scene, the name Daimh has come to represent a sound of a time and place a musical integrity that many strive to emulate. Formed over 20 years ago the band have embodied the current wave of resurgence in Gaelic culture; the current lineup includes younger musicians that have progressed through the thriving Feisean movement and Gaelic medium education system and joined the 3 remaining founding members to continue the cycle of the tradition. Recent achievements include receiving the MG ALBA Folk Band of the Year Award in 2015 and 2018 and passing the halfway mark on their career ambition of performing on every populated Scottish Island.\n\nFoyer opens at 6:00pm, Preshow at 6:30pm featuring Kelowna Scottish Country Dancers, theatre show at 7:00pm\n\n$44.00 Per Person\n\nIncluding fees & taxes\n\nReflecting on the richness of life, and the wide-ranging spectrum of emotions that surface from moment to moment is the spiritual focus of the latest, Juno-nominated album from one of Canada’s most accomplished and harmonious trios – Good Lovelies.\n\nMusically, Juno nominated We Will Never Be the Same hearkens back to the band’s acoustic, rootsy beginnings 17 years ago. Lyrically, the songs created by the Juno Award-winning ensemble of Kerri Ough, Sue Passmore and Caroline Marie Brooks are as compelling as the dynamic and engaging vocal harmonies for which the group is known as they mine the complex feelings experienced by women who have come to ponder some of the big questions of life.\n\nThe resulting collection of songs strikes a tone of hopefulness, steadfastness, and perseverance, even when enduring moments of tribulation and even despair. Songs such as Young at Heart, Tip to Toe and Keep Moving bring to bear the sometimes-conflicting emotions encountered on each songwriter’s personal life journey but expressed in ways that have profound meaning for anyone listening to them.\n\nIt is an admirable and desirable addition to their widely acclaimed musical catalogue which already includes four full-length studio albums, two enchanting Christmas releases, three EPs, and a live album. We Will Never Be the Same was crafted during a time when the Good Lovelies could not tour, which has been a staple of their careers, bringing them to concert venues throughout Canada and the U.S. as well as to the stages around the globe from the U.K. and Europe to Australia.\n\nMuch of the writing for We Will Never Be the Same took place during a productive and illuminating retreat in rural Nova Scotia, working closely with the production team of Joshua Van Tassel and Christine Bougie (who also both performed on the album) resulting in one of the most collaborative albums in the band’s tenure.\n\nThe heaviness of some of the subject matter is more than overshadowed by the exquisite beauty of the compositions and the stellar, powerfully deep and resonant vocal performances that elevate not only the tone, but the hearts and spirits of the listener.\n\nWe Will Never Be the Same is both a return to a more elemental, acoustic-based musical platform reaching back to the early days of the Good Lovelies, as well as an immersive emotional experience crafted by three songwriters who bring their own real-life stories in all their dynamism and messy complexity to the fore.\n\nIt is a testament not only to their artistry, but also their humanity, and is an album that will continue to endear this beloved group to fans of all ages.\n\n$42.00 Per Person\n\nIncluding Fees & Charges\n\nMany Canadians recognize the name Steve Patterson. He’s been a crowd favorite since his first Just for Laughs Gala appearance back in 2004 and as host of the long-running hit show The Debaters on CBC since 2007.\n\nBut what they may not know is how Patterson’s perceptions have shifted since he became a dad to two precocious daughters. Those new perceptions are on grand display in his new show which picks up on the themes introduced in his popular book published by Penguin Random House Canada in 2021 “Dad Up!” From being outsmarted to being outrun to being outnumbered (current household rankings have him clinging to 6th place in importance behind his wife, his daughters, their dog, and whichever stuffed animal is most essential in any given\n\nweek), Steve struggles to come to terms with the responsibilities of being a dad. But fortunately for audiences, his struggles are pure comedic delight. Come join this iconic Canadian comedian on a 90-minute fun ride that will warm your heart, rekindle memories, and maybe most importantly, will get you out of the house and laughing with strangers. Which, really, is the best gift families can give to each other.\n\n$42.00 Per Person\n\nIncluding Fees & Taxes\n\nThe Cruzeros have come out of retirement to celebrate their recent induction into the BC Country Music Hall of Fame. From the late 1990’s through to their last tour in 2008, this Kelowna based band held a brilliant musical legacy nationally and abroad. Their three independently launched albums spawned 20 Top Forty hits on the national radio charts, eight videos on CMT, radio and internet airplay in USA, Europe and Australia, and command performances at innumerable concerts, festivals, and events. The band gathered a host of award citations, including a Juno nomination for Country Group of the Year, a Canadian Indy for Country Album of the Year, BC Country Music Association Awards for Group, Songwriter, and Album of the Year, and Canadian Country Music Association All-Star Band Awards for Special Instrumentalist of the Year.\n\nThe Cruzeros were formed by Barry Mathers and Curtis Tulman in 1985 under the name Sea Cruise which played top forty cover tunes and rapidly became popular on the pub and nightclub circuit in the BC Interior. They began writing and recording their own songs later that year. and for the next decade home-produced singles were played on local radio and television through videos produced by the BC Music Project. The band went on a tour of Mexico, and subsequently changed the name to The Cruzeros.\n\nIn 1995 the band received funding through FACTOR to produce an album, which they did with Vancouver producer Bill Buckingham. The self-titled album was released to radio in 1996 and its success earned them a 1997 JUNO nomination for Country Group of the Year. The rest is history.\n\nTheir concert lineup includes main songwriter and lead vocalist Barry Mathers on guitar and mandolin, Curtis Tulman on vocals, guitar, harmonica and saxophone, JUNO nominee Rachel Matkin on vocals and mandolin, Jim Ryan on vocals, bass and keyboards, Jay Swetlishoff on drums and Scott Thielmann on lead guitar.\n\nThe concert at Creekside Theatre will in part be dedicated to the memory of guitarist and long-time Cruzero Gary Smyth, who recently passed away and is dearly missed.\n\n$42.00 Per Person\n\nIncluding Fees & Taxes\n\nVancouver soul dynamo Dawn Pemberton has a deep musical foundation rooted in tradition. Dawn spent her formative years surrounded by a family of multi–instrumentalists and developed a true love of music as a young girl. In addition to regularly collaborating on the projects of her peers and having an educated background in jazz voice and piano, Dawn is a talented and passionate songwriter in her own right. A staple of the West Coast music scene, Dawn can be found tearing it up as a vocalist, arranger, and go-to for live performances and studio sessions.\n\nDawn is heavily influenced by rhythm. She is drawn to the percolating under current of soul–jazz and funk which is infused in everything that she does: \"I’ve got a rhythmic stream running through me at all times. It’s all about the groove for me.\" On leadoff single ‘Deeper’ soulful grooves meet swirling organs, punchy horns, and tight drum breaks that pay homage to Dawn’s roots in gospel but update the sound with a feel all her own."
