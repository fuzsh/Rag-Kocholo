        "text": "NOUGHTIES icon Avril Lavigne remains one of Canada's most successful artists, having sold an estimated 40 million albums worldwide.\n\nHowever, she was diagnosed with debilitating Lyme disease in 2014.\n\nWho is Avril Lavigne?\n\nAvril Lavigne was born on September 27, 1984, and is a Canadian singer, songwriter and actress.\n\nShe was a skate punk icon at her height and her debut studio album Let Go is the best-selling album of the 21st century by a Canadian artist.\n\nThe record contained hit singles Complicated and Sk8er Boi.\n\nHer success was followed with Under My Skin, The Best Damn Thing, Goodbye Lullaby and Avril Lavigne in 2013.\n\nLavigne has also tried her hand at acting and voiced Heather in the animated film Over the Hedge.\n\nHer net worth is estimated to be a whopping $60million.\n\nWhat is Avril Lavigne doing now?\n\nAfter releasing her album Avril Lavigne in 2013, the singer took a step back from making music until she released her latest album Head Above Water in 2018.\n\nOn her return to public life on September 7, 2018, Avril Lavigne revealed in a heartbreaking open letter to her fans that she has been battling Lyme disease for the past few years.\n\nThe pop-rock star left the spotlight after being diagnosed with the life-threatening illness in 2015.\n\nThe shocking news put to rest the cruel rumours that Avril had died in 2003 and was replaced by her \"best friend\" Melissa Vandella.\n\nThe bizarre rumour recirculated last year as theorists analysed the shape of Avril’s nose, her autograph and her voice – which they claim has had a different tone since 2003.\n\nLavigne and her ex-Mod Sun shocked fans when they publicly announced they called off their engagement, almost a year after he proposed.\n\nWhen was Avril Lavigne diagnosed with Lyme disease?\n\nThe 38-year-old contracted Lyme disease from a tick bite in spring 2014 and was diagnosed with Lyme disease in 2014.\n\nIn 2018, Avril revealed she had \"accepted death\" at her worst point battling the disease, suggesting the process was far longer and more difficult than fans might have realised.\n\nShe said: \"Five years have gone by since I released my last album.\n\n\"I spent the last few years at home sick fighting Lyme disease.\n\n\"Those were the worst years of my life as I went through both physical and emotional battles.\n\n\"I had accepted death and could feel my body shutting down - I felt like I was drowning.\n\n\"Like I was going underwater and I just needed to come up for air.\n\n\"Like I was in a river being pulled in a current, unable to breathe.\""
