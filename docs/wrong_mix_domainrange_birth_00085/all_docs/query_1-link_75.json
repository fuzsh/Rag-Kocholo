Avril Lavigne is a Canadian singer-songwriter from Napanee, Ontario. She knew from a young age that she wanted to be a singer, performing in her hometown and teaching herself guitar at age 12. At 16, she dropped out of high school to move to New York to pursue her music career. Her style is described as punk rock and she wants to stay true to herself rather than changing her image. She hopes people know her music comes from her heart and is real and honest.",
