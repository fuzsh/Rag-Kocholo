        "text": "Today is a sad, sad day for Lightning fans. After being teased and promised about a resigning of Captain Steven Stamkos, it looks like the Bolts have decided to part ways with the face of the franchise. As we sit back and wonder why the Lightning are okay with losing such a key player in their roster, we’ll look back at some our most favorite memories of Steven Stamkos highlights.\n\nStamkos is 34 and has spent 16 years with the Tampa Bay Lightning, 10 seasons as our captain. He finished last season with 40 goals, and 41 assists. At the beginning of the 2023 season, Lightning general manager Julien BriseBois had promised Bolts fans they would address and re-sign Stamkos after the 2023-2024 season. A few days ago rumors were spreading around X (formerly Twitter) about the offer to the captain, and many fans found it insulting.\n\nAfter a lot of a back and forth between the team and Stamkos’ agent, the Lightning offered him a contract of $3million a year for 8 years. Stamkos’ agent was hoping for at least $4.5-$5 million. Even after making $16 million in cap space after trading a star defenseman and another forward, JBB didn’t change his offer to Stamkos, which seemed to be the last straw.\n\nIt was announced today at the start of free agency that Stamkos took a deal with the Nashville Predator’s for $8 million for 4 years. Below is a statement from the Captain:\n\nSo many stats could be stated to show how Steven Stamkos has contributed to the team and community over the years. Over 500 goals, over 1,000 points, 2 Stanley Cups, Rocket Richard trophy winner, overcoming heartbreak and injuries, donating thousands to the city. It’s no shocker why Stamkos was so loved around Tampa Bay and no doubt he’ll have his own spot in the Lightning Hall of Fame. So be sure to check on your friends who are Lightning fans today, as we are going through a mourning process.\n\nHere Are 7 Steven Stamkos Highlights and Memories To Cherish Forever"
