        "text": "Country star Nate Smith has found his way to TMZ via a recent date he shared with Canadian singer Avril Lavigne. The mega-gossip site recently caught the two singers on a date where they, at one point, took out skateboards and did some boarding together.\n\nIn a photo gallery of shots, you can see the couple having dinner in Los Angeles. Then, several photos of the couple are in the back of a pickup truck. Then the two take out skateboards in a gas station parking lot and try their hand at the sport that Lavigne sings about so famously in the song that made her a star, “Sk8er Boi.”\n\nThe TMZ reporter who captured the video starts to sing Lavigne’s song with no reaction. As Avril skates down the road, Nate holds his skateboard in his arm and follows her.\n\nThere is no word on how Smith met Lavigne and whether they are officially dating.\n\nRELATED: Nate Smith: ‘Music Is Supposed To Heal’ You\n\nNate is making a name for himself in country music, and it all began when his debut radio single “Whiskey On You” hit the airwaves. The song shot straight to the number-one spot on the country charts.\n\nWe talked with the singer not long ago, and he told us about that breakout song that put him on the country music map. He said, “That song really came out of a breakup. Just the frustrations of that, but really, of all my songs, that one has a sense of overcoming in it. I think that’s what people really like about it because it’s not just a rock anthem song. It has this thing about it where you are like, ‘Yeah, I think everything’s gonna be okay. I think I’m gonna get through this.’ It just feels good.”\n\nThe song’s music video gets fans laughing. He said, “The music video, we just wanted to have fun. All we did was laugh the whole time. There’s a scene where we’re coming out of a van, and it looks like all this smoke piles out. It was burnt baby oil; that’s how they were doing that, and it was the worst smell we ever smelled in our lives, and we were literally gaging. I love how it came out; it’s so fun.”\n\nFive Country Stars That Play To Crowds Bigger Than Their Hometown\n\nNancy Brooks has been working in the country music industry for almost 30 years. She has interviewed pretty much any country star you can think of. In the late 1990s, she started working with Dolly Parton. And yes, Nancy reports that Parton is as sweet as you would think. She loves her life in country music and has been backstage at every CMA Awards show since the late 1990s. Many of her stories are from her one-on-one interviews. She was there at the beginning of the incredible careers of many music superstars today, including Taylor Swift, Shania Twain, and Blake Shelton, and has interviewed them multiple times throughout the years."
