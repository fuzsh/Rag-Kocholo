Collaboration is key in the cybersecurity industry to build and implement the best solutions possible to stay one step ahead. For this reason, Deloitte’s EMEA Cybersphere Center has partnered with global cybersecurity leader Palo Alto Networks, with the aim of expanding its managed security services portfolio for customers both in Spain and across its entire global network. This partnership will see Deloitte’s EMEA Cybersphere Center integrate Cortex XDR™, Cortex™ XSOAR (formerly Demisto), and Prisma™ Cloud solutions into its security catalogue.\n\nWith this agreement, Deloitte’s EMEA Cybersphere Center boasts a technological setup capable of carrying out security orchestration, automation, monitoring and response tasks to tackle the most sophisticated threats detected in any environment.\n\nCortex XSOAR’s industry-leading security orchestration, automation and response technology has also been implemented within Deloitte’s own security operations centre, allowing its team of professionals to augment their current capabilities and ultimately be better prepared to tackle increasingly complex cybersecurity threats on behalf of customers.\n\nThe integration of Cortex XDR and Prisma Cloud into Deloitte’s managed services portfolio also allows the company to advance its threat detection and response capabilities in both on-premise environments and infrastructures deployed within public cloud environments, including containers and serverless functions. In addition Prisma Cloud provides tools for monitoring the security posture of these infrastructures, while ensuring the adherence to regulatory compliance requirements for customers.\n\nCésar Martín Lara, the Risk Advisory partner leading Deloitte’s cybersecurity practice, commented:\n\n“This partnership enables us to enhance the service that we provide to our clients and to combine the finest threat detection and response technologies with the development of technological processes and the experience of our professionals across all areas of cybersecurity. This represents a giant leap forward for our market growth strategy.”\n\nChristian Hentschel, President, Palo Alto Networks EMEA, added:\n\n“We’re delighted to be partnering with Deloitte, not only helping them to deliver enhanced SOAR capabilities having implemented our technology in their own security operations centre, but also incorporating services around our wider Cortex and Prisma Cloud solutions. Together we look forward to helping customers around the world make each day more secure than the one before.”\n\nAbout Deloitte\n\nDeloitte refers to one or more of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited (“DTTL”), its global network of member firms, and their related entities (collectively, the “Deloitte organization”).
