The new HP is a market leader in all the essential components of business infrastructure—servers, storage, management software, imaging and printing, personal computers, and personal access devices. The new HP is the leading consumer technology company in the world, offering a range of technology tools—from digital cameras to PCs to handheld devices.\n\nHP Began As Maker of Test and Measurement Products\n\nHewlett-Packard had its beginnings with Stanford University graduates, William Hewlett and David Packard, who were encouraged by Professor Frederick Terman to start their own business. With only $538 and workspace in a garage behind Packard’s rented house in Palo Alto, California, the two men began working on a resistance-capacity audio oscillator, a machine used for testing sound equipment. After assembling several models—baking paint for the instrument panel in Packard’s oven—they won their first big order, for eight oscillators, from Walt Disney Studios, which used them to develop and test a new sound system for the animated film Fantasia.\n\nOn January 1, 1939, Hewlett and Packard formalized their venture as a partnership, tossing a coin to decide the order of their names. Hewlett won. In 1940, with a product line of eight items, the two men moved their company and its three employees to a building in downtown Palo Alto.\n\nDuring World War II, Terman, who was then in charge of antiradar projects at Harvard, contracted his former students to manufacture microwave signal generators for his research. When the war ended, HP took full advantage of the growth in the electronics sector, particularly in the defense and industrial areas. The founders also defined their respective roles in the company: Hewlett would lead technological development, and Packard would be in charge of management. Hewlett-Packard Company was incorporated in 1947, and by 1950 had 70 products, 143 employees, and revenues of $2 million.\n\nHP introduced a revolutionary high-speed frequency counter, the HP524A, in 1951. This device, which reduced the time required to measure radio frequencies from ten minutes to about two seconds, was used by radio stations to maintain accurate broadcast frequencies, particularly on the newly established FM band.\n\nThe company maintained stable and impressive growth through the end of the decade. In November 1957, Hewlett-Packard offered shares to the public for the first time and moved into a larger complex in the Stanford Research Park.\n\nIn 1958, with revenues of $30 million, HP made its first corporate acquisition: the F.L. Moseley Company of Pasadena, California, a manufacturer of graphic recorders. The company’s expansion continued in 1959, with the establishment of a marketing office in Geneva, and a manufacturing facility in Boeblingen, West Germany. After adding another factory in Loveland, Colorado, in 1960, Hewlett-Packard purchased the Sanborn Company, a medical instruments manufacturer based in Waltham, Massachusetts, in 1961.\n\nThe company gained wider public recognition when it was listed on the Pacific and New York stock exchanges in 1961 and in the Fortune 500 a year later. In 1964, Hewlett-Packard developed a cesium-beam “flying clock,” accurate to within one-millionth of a second. Company engineers embarked on a 35-day, 35,000-mile world tour to coordinate standard times.\n\nIn 1963, Hewlett-Packard expanded its presence in Japan through a joint venture with the Yokogawa Electric Works; and in 1965 it acquired the F & M Scientific Corporation, an analytical-instruments manufacturer, based in Avondale, Pennsylvania. In 1966, the company opened its central research laboratory, which became one of the world’s leading electronic research centers.\n\nHP Moves into Calculators and Computers in the Late 1960s and 1970s\n\nAlthough primarily a manufacturer of instruments for analysis and measurement, Hewlett-Packard developed a computer in 1966, specifically for its own production control, the HP-2116A, and had no plans to enter the computer market. Two years later, however, HP introduced the HP-9100A, the first desktop calculator capable of performing scientific functions. In 1969, David Packard was appointed deputy secretary of defense in President Richard Nixon’s administration, and returned to HP as a director in 1972.\n\nA handheld scientific calculator, the HP-35, was partially designed by Bill Hewlett in 1972. It was known as the “electronic slide rule.” When Texas Instruments entered the market in 1973, Hewlett-Packard’s device, which retailed at $395, was forced into the high end of the market.\n\nSignaling a change in company strategy, in 1972, Hewlett-Packard made its first decisive move into business computing, a field dominated by IBM and Digital Equipment Corporation, with the HP3000 minicomputer. In spring 1974, despite record earnings and escalating growth, the company refocused on product leadership, and established a new, highly decentralized structure, allowing each of the company’s divisions conduct its own research and development.\n\nIn 1977, Bill Hewlett relinquished the presidency and later his role as chief executive to John Young, a career HP man determined to make the company successful in the computer market. Although he was chosen by Hewlett and Packard, Young was virtually unknown to the company’s customers and 37,000 employees.\n\nHP Introduces Personal Computers and Printers in the 1980s\n\nHewlett-Packard introduced its first personal computer, the HP-85, in 1980, to a cool reception. Its move into information processing, however, proved successful and the company quickly established itself as a leading computer vendor. A six-year program began to develop architecture and software that would be compatible with existing programs. In the meantime, HP introduced a number of other products, including the HP9000 technical workstation (1982), the HP150 touchscreen PC, the HP ThinkJet inkjet printer (1984), and the HP LaserJet printer—a phenomenally successful product that came to dominate the printer market soon after its 1984 debut.\n\nCompaq Beginnings: Making IBM Clones\n\nWhen International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) introduced its first personal computer (PC) in 1982, Compaq was among dozens of other companies, including HP, entering the market with IBM clones—computers that looked and performed like IBM PCs, but were often less expensive. Compaq set itself apart from other clone manufacturers by producing IBM-compatible PCs that were faster, superior in quality, and offered additional user features. Its unique management team was made up of seasoned professionals from Texas Instruments (TI) and IBM. Compaq’s staff also had the technical and business grounding to establish new industry standards on its own—without following IBM.\n\nCompaq had come to be in the summer of 1981, when Joseph R. “Rod” Canion, James M. Harris, and William H. Murto, three senior managers from TI, decided to start their own company, but had not decided on a product. The entrepreneurs eventually decided to build a portable PC that met industry standards set by IBM. With only $1,000 each to invest, Canion, Harris, and Murto approached Ben Rosen, president of Sevin-Rosen Partners, a high-technology venture capital firm in Houston. Rosen, who became Compaq’s chairman, offered an initial investment of $2.5 million.\n\nCompany Perspectives:\n\nThe new HP is a leading technology solutions provider for consumers and businesses with market leadership in fault-tolerant servers, UNIX servers, Linux servers, Windows servers, storage solutions, management software, imaging and printing and PCs. Furthermore, 65,000 professionals worldwide lead our IT services team. Our $4 billion annual R&D investment fuels the invention of products, solutions and new technologies, so that we can better serve customers and enter new markets. We invent, engineer and deliver technology solutions that drive business value, create social value and improve the lives of our customers.\n\nWhen Compaq arrived on the scene, venture capitalists were beginning to force many entrepreneurs to turn over control of their companies to more experienced management professionals. As Rosen—who had lost a $400,000 investment in another PC start-up—explained in Management Today in 1985, “In the early days, it was an area for flamboyant people… who transformed their personalities into companies. Now the business requires a very different kind of manager. It has become a very unforgiving industry.”\n\nKey Dates:\n\n1939:\n\nWilliam Hewlett and David Packard enter into a partnership; Hewlett-Packard (HP) is born.\n\n1940:\n\nHP operations begin in Palo Alto, California.\n\n1947:\n\nHP is incorporated.\n\n1951:\n\nHP introduces the HP524A high-speed counter.\n\n1957:\n\nHP shares are offered to the public.\n\n1958:\n\nHP acquires F.L.

Canion, Compaq’s chief executive officer, strongly supported the idea of producing a briefcase-size, or laptop, computer. The marketing research director, however, concluded that the market for such a computer did not exist. Canion relented, and Compaq waited while other companies, including Gavilan Computer Corporation and Data General Corporation, attempted to market such a product and failed.\n\nMeanwhile, Compaq shipped its first two products, the Compaq Portable and the Compaq Plus, and set the standard for portable—although larger than a briefcase—full-function PCs. In 1983, Compaq shipped more than 53,000 portable PCs throughout the United States and Canada; increased their workforce from 100 to 600; and increased production from 200 machines in January to 9,000 in December. The company recorded $111.2 million in revenues, the most successful first year of sales for a U.S. company.\n\nA key factor in Compaq’s growth was a strong cooperative relationship with its dealers. With nearly 90 PCs on the market aimed at business professionals, shelf space was very competitive. Compaq did not have a direct sales force of its own, and, thus, did not compete with its authorized dealers. This arrangement gave dealers more incentive to carry Compaq computers. Compaq also motivated its authorized dealers through what was called “Salespaq,” through which Compaq paid a percentage of the dealer’s cost of advertising, sales training, or incentives.\n\nCompaq’s ability to develop, produce, and market new products in a very short time period was another key ingredient in its success. Once a product was approved, Compaq undertook all aspects of its development simultaneously; factories were built, marketing and distribution arrangements were made, and engineers refined the product design. The product cycle in the PC industry was typically 12 to 18 months; Compaq delivered in six to nine months. This fast turnaround in product development enabled Compaq to introduce the latest technology before its competitors. In 1984, for example, IBM announced a new version of its PC that experts felt would set back other PC manufacturers. Compaq pulled its resources from every branch of the company, and within six months introduced and shipped its DESKPRO line of desktop PCs. Fifteen months later IBM shipped its portable PC, which was two pounds heavier and offered fewer features than Compaq’s portable model. From the first quarter of 1983 to the last quarter of 1984, Compaq’s production increased from 2,200 computers to 48,000. Despite the 1984 industry shakeout, Compaq reported an increase in sales to over $500 million. In March 1985, Rosen’s original investment of $2.5 million increased in value to $30 million.\n\nCompaq in the Late 1980s: New Products and Markets\n\nExpediency in product development also led to a turning point in Compaq’s history. In 1985, Intel, a leading manufacturer of microprocessors, wanted to market its powerful new microprocessor, the 80386, as soon as possible. Intel felt confident that a Compaq product based on the new microprocessor would see a quick entry into the market. Their collaboration resulted in Compaq’s 1987 introduction of the DESKPRO 386. Based on Intel’s new chip, this new PC performed over three times faster than IBM’s fastest PC, and nearly twice as fast as Compaq’s closest competitor. It took IBM nine months to introduce a comparable machine using Intel’s 80386. By then, Compaq was developing a portable version of its new PC.\n\nIn 1986, Compaq became the first company to achieve Fortune 500 status in fewer than four years. From 1986 through 1989, Compaq’s revenues increased fivefold to $3 billion, while other PC manufacturers—including Apple Computer and Sun Microsystems—had setbacks. Much of this growth was due to Compaq’s successful marketing efforts in Europe. Led by Eck-hard Pfeiffer, former head of TFs European consumer electronics operation, Compaq began its European campaign in 1984, before most other U.S. vendors. In 1989, Compaq became the number two supplier of business PCs to the European market, achieving $1.3 billion in international sales. With the PC market in Europe growing about 33 percent faster than the U.S. market, Compaq had an edge on other PC manufacturers.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1986, HP introduced its new family of Spectrum computer systems, developed at a cost of $250 million. The project was based on a concept called RISC (Reduced-Instruction-Set Computing), which enabled programs to run at double or triple conventional speed by eliminating many routine instructions. In spite of critics’ claims that the stripped-down instruction set made the program less flexible and over-specialized, other computer companies soon began developing their own RISC chips.\n\nWhile market projections for Spectrum were good, and the system itself was state of the art, HP initially failed to capitalize on its technology because of the company’s strategy of focusing on markets rather than product lines. Sales efforts, however, were soon redoubled on every level. The company even began joint marketing with telecommunications and peripherals companies previously regarded as competitors.\n\nJohn Young’s leadership of Hewlett-Packard was highly regarded. The Precision Architecture line gained wider acceptance after a problematic introduction, and came to be seen as a bold gamble. By 1988, Young had restored the company’s momentum, with net earnings rising 27 percent during that year. Directors Hewlett and Packard were no longer involved in the day-to-day running of the business, and, in 1987, Walter B. Hewlett and David Woodley Packard, the sons of the founders, were elected to the board. In 1988, the company’s stock began trading on the Tokyo stock exchange—its first listing outside the United States. The following year, HP gained listings on four European exchanges: London, Zurich, Paris, and Frankfurt.\n\nIn April 1989, Hewlett-Packard paid $500 million for Apollo Computer, a pioneer in the design, manufacture, and sale of engineering workstations. Integrating the two companies and eliminating unnecessary engineers and salespeople proved more time-consuming than anticipated, and as sales dropped, Hewlett-Packard slipped back to second position in late 1989. The company faced a further setback when Motorola Inc. delayed introduction of the advanced microprocessor chip it had promised HP for a new line of workstations.\n\nIn November 1989, Compaq introduced the Compaq SYSTEMPRO personal computer and the Compaq DESKPRO 486, utilizing technology known as Extended Industry Standard Architecture (EISA), a hardware design that Compaq developed to challenge IBM’s MicroChannel hardware design for its PS/2 PCs. These technologies increased the speed of PCs, enabling them to perform such complex operations as networking and multitasking. An added advantage of EISA was its ability to attract customers accustomed to using more powerful minicomputers and mainframe computers. By incorporating EISA into its new products, Compaq began to set industry standards. While IBM was producing computers based on the MicroChannel technology, many other manufacturers were using EISA technology. Initial sales of the SYSTEMPRO were slow but, as CEO Canion told a Business Week correspondent, “We realized we were opening up a whole new market. … We knew it would take some time.”\n\nCompany sales for Compaq for 1990 reached $3.6 billion, with net income of $455 million, record figures for the eighth consecutive year. During that year, Compaq opened new subsidiaries in Austria, Finland, and Hong Kong, and authorizing dealers in the former East Germany, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Argentina, Mexico, and Trinidad. International sales accounted for over half of Compaq’s total revenue in 1990, eclipsing North American sales for the first time. Nine new products were introduced during that year, including updated versions of the DESKPRO 386 desktop PC and a high-performance notebook PC, the Compaq LTE 386s/20. By the end of 1990, Compaq had 3,872 authorized dealers throughout the world, over 2,000 of them in North America.\n\nFollowing a trend that developed in the information processing industry in the late 1980s and early 1990s, HP forged alliances with a number of companies that had previously been competitors. These included Hitachi, a microchip company; Canon, which provided the engines for HP’s best-selling laser printer line; and 3Com, with which HP had a marketing and research agreement. Purchases during this period included Eon Systems, a manufacturer of equipment that monitored computer networks; and Hilco Technologies, a maker of factory software in which HP obtained a 25 percent stake.\n\nEarly 1990’s Difficulties Led to Restructuring at HP\n\nIn spite of the new focus on workstation technology and cooperative trade agreements, HP began 1990 with sagging profits and a lackluster consumer response to its new product line. In 1990, earnings fell 11 percent to $739 million, down from $829 million in 1989. David Packard, the retired co-founder of the company, returned to his office to take a more active role in running the business.\n\nJohn Young, president and CEO, undertook a thorough restructuring of Hewlett-Packard. By eliminating excess layers of management and dividing computer products into two main groups: those sold directly to big customers (workstations and minicomputers) and those sold through discount dealers (printers and PCs). In a move away from the consensus style of management, he set up a virtually autonomous design group within the computer division, and put it in charge of developing a new workstation based on the RISC technology that Digital had helped pioneer. The results were impressive. After only a year of development, the Series 700 workstations were introduced in 1991 to universally favorable reviews. The machines were considered several years ahead of their time, a crucial advantage in an industry where the constant development of new technologies makes products obsolete almost as soon as they reach the market.\n\nHP’s 95LX palmtop personal computer, also introduced in 1991, established an important new market in information devices. The 95LX, which retailed for $699, contained built-in Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet software, and immediately became a hot seller.\n\nThe resurgence of the company was not achieved without a price. HP cut 3,000 positions in 1990 and a further 2,000 positions in 1991. While executives agreed that downsizing was a necessary evil, the staff reductions, together with a more aggressive advertising stance, changed the company’s image. When John Young announced his retirement in July 1992, he presided over a dynamic, if less paternalistic, company. His successor, Lewis E. Platt, an executive vice-president and head of the company’s computer systems organization, took over in November 1992. Following Packard’s retirement as chairman in 1993, Platt was named chairman, president, and CEO of HP.\n\n1991 also Brings a Slump to Compaq\n\nFor reasons ranging from economic recession and price competition to problems with the flow of distribution, Compaq’s sales and earnings fell in 1991 for the first time in the company’s history. The DESKPRO 386 PC series continued to be a bestseller, with desktop PCs accounting for close to three-fourths of Compaq’s total revenue. In September 1991, a new line of Compaq computers was introduced with “Intelligent Modularity.” This system, the DESKPRO/M, enabled users to more readily upgrade key components as their needs and the available technology changed, by organizing components into five easy-to-access modules: memory, input/output, EISA/ISA expansion cards, processor, and video graphics controller.\n\nCompaq was forced to alter its established distribution strategy somewhat in 1991; eight of the company’s ten most important dealer chains had merged into four. This led Compaq to gradually start authorizing computer consultants and discount chains to sell its products. Direct sales techniques of its own, such as a toll-free hotline, were stepped up as well.\n\nIn late 1991, a dramatic management shake-up took place. Following a gloomy board meeting at which a $70 million third-quarter loss was announced, company founder and CEO Canion was forced to resign. Pfeiffer, who had been promoted to executive vice-president and chief operating officer, replaced Canion. A major reorganization of the corporate structure ensued. The company was realigned into desktop and systems divisions. As part of a 1,440-person staff reduction program, about 12 percent of the company’s entire work force was laid off. In addition, five high-ranking executives left the organization, including senior vice-president of engineering James C. Harris, the last remaining company founder.\n\nIn June 1992, Compaq introduced 16 new products, including the company’s first low-cost desktop PCs (COMPAQ Pro-Linea), low-cost notebook PCs (Contura), and upgradeable desktop PCs with advanced graphics and audio capabilities. The same month, Compaq announced the initiation of a new Peripherals Division, a worldwide arm whose mission would be to develop printers and printer-related items. The division’s initial line of products, including the August 1992 debut of the Compaq Pagem printer, launched Compaq into the rapidly growing market for network printers. The printer line was a failure, however, and was abandoned in 1993.\n\nCompaq’s Presario Leads a Consumer Push in the Mid-1990s\n\nUnder the leadership of Eckhardt, Compaq began a major push into the consumer and home office markets with an effort centered around the Presario line of home computers launched in August 1993. The company’s hottest new PC, the Presario line, included models selling for less than $1,500. Compaq sold more than 100,000 Presarios in the first 60 days after introduction, with sales fueled by a $12 million television advertising blitz, the company’s first such campaign in three years. In 1993 alone, Compaq sold $500 million worth of Presarios. By 1994, the company managed not only to fend off its low-price competitors, it also surpassed IBM as the number one seller of PCs worldwide.\n\nNot content with its PC dominance, Compaq in the mid-1990s aimed to capture a much wider market. Following the introduction of the Proliant server PCs as its entry into the market for servers (powerful computers used for corporate networks and Internet web sites), the company went after the corporate mainframe and minicomputer market with the launch of the Armada mainframe-class server, the top-of-the-line model which sold for upwards of $100,000. On the lower-end server front, in 1994 Compaq launched the ProSignia VS server, which cost only about five to ten percent more than a desktop PC.\n\nAlso in 1994, Compaq revamped its logistics system in order to begin building its PCs to order from a huge stockpile of parts. With a build-to-order system, Compaq would realize significant inventory and manufacturing cost savings.\n\nOther Compaq initiatives of this period included moves into high-speed networking equipment and Internet services/products, as well as the October 1996 launch of a successful line of engineering workstations. Compaq realized astounding growth: revenues increased from $5.79 billion in 1992 to $20.01 billion in 1996; and net income, which had peaked in 1990 at $577 million, registered at $988 million in 1994, $893 million in 1995, and $1.32 billion in 1996. With a wider range of products, Compaq generated about 15 percent of its revenues from the consumer PC market, 48 percent from corporate desktop PCs, and 35 percent from servers and workstations in 1997.\n\nHP Aggressively Expands in PCs in the Mid-1990s\n\nWhen Platt took over as CEO of Hewlett-Packard in 1992, its share of the personal computer market was a mere one percent. Moreover, PCs accounted for only 5.7 percent of the company’s overall revenues of $16.4 billion. By 1995, HP was the fastest-growing maker of PCs in the world, having initially targeted corporate customers. In August 1995, HP went after the home PC market with the launch of the Pavilion line. Throughout this revitalization of the company’s PC lines, HP adopted a much more aggressive pricing policy. Its market share soared, with the company leaping to third place in mid-1997, edging out Dell Computer and trailing only Compaq Computer Corporation and IBM. By 1998, Hewlett-Packard derived 19.1 percent of its total revenues of $47.06 billion from the sale of personal computers.\n\nHP’s pursuit of personal computer prominence was problematic given that sector’s relatively low margins, but Platt felt the company had to be a major player in PCs in order to remain one of the top computer companies in the world. Although Platt did not want HP to be “just” a peripherals company, the firm continued to churn out successful products in that area: the HP Color LaserJet printer and the HP OfficeJet multifunction machine (a combined printer, fax machine, and copier), both introduced in 1994; and the HP OmniGo 100 handheld organizer, which debuted in 1995. With the Internet and electronic commerce burgeoning, HP in mid-1997 paid nearly $1.2 billion to acquire VeriFone, Inc., a maker of in-store terminals used to verify credit card transactions. HP hoped to combine a personal computer or other electronic device with a VeriFone-derived card reader and appropriate software to create a system with additional payment options for electronic commerce purchases. Also in 1997, HP was added to the companies that comprise the prestigious Dow Jones Industrial Average. Meantime, co-founder David Packard died on March 26, 1996.\n\nHP’s revenues had been growing at an annual 20-percent-plus clip from 1993 through 1996, but, in 1997, these increases began to shrink. Sales increased from $38.42 billion in 1996 to $42.9 billion in 1997, or 11.6 percent, then to 47.06 billion in 1998, an increase of 9.7 percent. Net income fell from $3.12 billion in 1997 to $2.95 billion in 1998. Among the reasons for the decline were the Asian economic crisis; HP’s slow response to opportunities presented by the explosion of the Internet; and falling prices for personal computers and computer peripherals. In addition, HP’s printer lines, especially in the inkjet area, were being buffeted by competition from new, low-cost rivals and declining margins in the PC and printer areas were dragging down the profitability of HP as a whole.\n\nCompaq Acquisitions in the Late 1990s\n\nIn February 1997, Compaq released a $999 PC, the Presario 2000, in another aggressive, low-price move aimed at attracting the 60 percent of U.S. households without a PC. Later in 1997 the company acquired, through a stock-for-stock transaction valued at about $4 billion, Tandem Computers Incorporated, a leader in fail-safe high-end servers with annual sales of $2 billion and a sales force 4,000 strong. Compaq also spent $280 million for Microcom, Inc., a provider of devices for remote access to networks.\n\nMoreover, Compaq had its eye on an even bigger deal. In June 1998 the company completed its $9.1 billion acquisition of Digital Equipment Corporation, the number four computer maker in the United States. Digital, which became a subsidiary of Compaq, was a leading maker of high-end workstations and servers, giving Compaq an even greater presence in those markets. Digital also brought to Compaq a 22,000-person service operation for large companies—computer services having been one of Compaq’s weakest areas. The deal increased Compaq’s annual revenues to more than $37 billion and vaulted the company into the number two position among all the computer firms in the world (behind only $78.5 million-in-revenues IBM), it also positioned Compaq as one of the world leaders in just about every computer sector. The company was number one worldwide in desktop computers, number three in portable computers, number three in workstations, number one in both PC servers (costing less than $25,000) and entry servers (less than $100,000), and number six in midrange servers ($100,000 to $1 million). In computer services, Compaq was suddenly number three, behind IBM and EDS.\n\nCompaq took a $3.6 billion charge against earnings in 1998 related to the acquisition of Digital and announced plans to cut 15,000 Digital jobs and 2,000 at Compaq. Areas of overlap began to be addressed, such as the folding of Digital’s PC production into that of Compaq and the scaling back of Compaq’s network equipment unit. However, it would take some time before the full impact of this combination—at the time the largest merger in the relatively short history of computers—could be assessed.\n\nCompaq’s transformation from a PC company to a global IT—and Internet—leader accelerated during 1998, based on the vision of President Pfeiffer, “At Compaq, we envision a world where virtually all information is online and people can communicate, conduct commerce and securely access the information they need from anywhere at any time.” Through the acquisition of Digital, Compaq acquired AltaVista, the world’s fastest Internet search and navigation guide, and the following year created a separate company, The AltaVista Company, to extend Compaq’s Internet leadership position. Compaq also announced that year the formation of Compaq.com, a business division to drive Internet sales of Compaq products and services, and the acquisition of online retailer Shopping.com.\n\nCompaq President Pfeiffer Resigns; Michael D. Capellas Takes Charge\n\nIn the wake of disappointing earnings and shareholder suits, President Pfeiffer resigned and was replaced as President and CEO by Michael D. Capellas, who had joined the company in 1998. Capellas issued more layoffs and organized the company around three global businesses groups-Enterprise Solutions and Services, Commercial Personal Computing, and Consumer. A restructuring plan was implemented to drive down costs and operating expenses. During the second half of the year, Compaq returned to profitability, reduced operating expenses and began to focus on increasing growth and stockholder value. Strategic alliances with Microsoft and Oracle were re-energized and a strategic partnership was formed with CMGI, by which CMGI would acquire control of Compaq’s Alta Vista business and its related properties (Shopping.com and Zip2). Innovative products and services were introduced, including the Aero 8000, the world’s most secure, mobile and easy-to-use Handheld PC Professional device; and the light-weight portable projector, MP1600.\n\nCapellas saw Compaq “guided by a single, focused vision: Everything to the Internet.” At the end of 1999, Compaq joined forces with Cable & Wireless to deliver global e-business solutions; in 2000 acquired PC reseller Inacom; and created Custom Edge, Inc., a direct sales unit. In April, a 10-year corporate alliance was announced with The Walt Disney Company. In technology, the iPAQ Pocket PC was introduced and earned the first ZDNet “tech Trendsetter Award.”\n\nBy mid-year, the Compaq started showing significant progress and by the end of the year, revenue was up 10 percent, gross margin was up almost one percentage point, operating expenses were down, operating profit was up more than threefold, and earnings per share more than tripled from 1999. Capellas credited the success to Compaq’s enterprise business, particularly the high-end storage and server businesses. Compaq was the number one provider of Web servers, number one in the highest measure of system availability and number one in high-performance technical computing.\n\n1999 HP Plans to Spin Off Noncomputing Lines\n\nIn late 1998, HP launched a comprehensive review of its operations and announced in early 1999 its intention to spin off into a separate firm, Agilent Technologies, its noncomputing segments: test and measurement products and service, medical electronic products and service, electronic components, and chemical analysis and service. These segments generated about $7.6 billion in revenues during 1998, or 16 percent of the total. Hewlett-Packard hoped this major divestment—which included the company’s original lines of business—would sharpen the firm’s competitive instincts, energize its workforce, and enable it to become a more aggressive player in the increasingly important sphere of the Internet. The company also announced that upon completion of the spinoff, Platt would step down as chairman and CEO.\n\nIn July 1999, HP named the 20-year veteran of AT&T and Lucent Technologies, Carleton (Carly) S. Fiorina as President and CEO. Fiorina was responsible for HP’s reinvention as a company that makes the Internet work for businesses and consumers. According to Fiorina, the reinvention of the company resulted from the goal “to restructure and revitalize ourselves to recapture the spirit of invention that is our birthright and apply it to meeting customer needs.” Under her leadership, HP returned to its roots of innovation and inventiveness and focused on delivering the best total customer experience.\n\nHP revealed a new strategy designed for the Internet, based on Web services to people and businesses through the use of information appliances over infrastructure solutions. HP positioned itself to deliver Web services, intelligent devices and servers and infrastructure of servers and software. By the end of the year, HP had introduced a new brand campaign focusing on the company’s history of invention and innovation and introducing a new company logo. Under Fiorina’s direction, HP also realigned its businesses into two customer-facing organizations and three product-generation organizations.\n\nIn 2000, HP introduced the high-end Superdome server line and announced that it would acquire Bluestone Software, resulting in the further expansion of its Internet software portfolio. A new business initiative, HP e-Inclusion, was introduced. This program addressed the digital divide by fostering sustainable, profitable businesses in developing countries.\n\nTwo new software families were introduced in early 2001—HP Netaction Software Suite and HP Open View Software Suite—thus, uniting its software offerings into a comprehensive platform for developing, implementing and maintaining Internet-based services. A new business organization, HP Services, was announced in March, with responsibilities in consulting, outsourcing, support, education and solutions deployment.\n\nIn 2001, Compaq continued to shift its emphasis from hardware to services, comprising 24 percent of Compaq’s revenue in 2001. The Global Services unit of the company continued to be the company’s strongest segment. Compaq’s Alpha microprocessor operations were sold to Intel and a comprehensive global technology and marketing alliance was announced with Yahoo!. Computing on Demand was introduced which would allow customers to purchase a variety of computing resources.\n\nAcquisitions and a Merger of Worldwide Importance\n\nIn September HP acquired StorageApps, manufacturer of storage virtualization appliances, and Indigo, a leading commercial and industrial printing systems company. Perhaps the biggest news to the industry occurred on September 3, 2001, when HP and Compaq Computer Corporation announced a definitive agreement to merge, creating a new $87 billion global technology leader.\n\nOn May 3, 2002, Hewlett-Packard officially closed its $19 billion acquisition of Compaq Computer Corporation. Compaq investors received 0.6325 shares of Hewlett-Packard for every Compaq share they owned, and Compaq stock ceased being traded. HPQ became the new stock ticker for the combined company. Ms. Fiorina retained her position as Chairman and CEO of the new HP. Former Compaq president and merger coauthor, Michael Capellas, became president of the new HP, with responsibilities for the new company’s global business groups, worldwide sales, supply chain management and e-commerce operations. According to Chairman Fiorina, “We merged Compaq and HP to create a stronger company to serve our customers—a company with a richer portfolio of products and solutions and a deeper services team.” The new HP was officially launched on May 7, 2002, with an ad titled “We Are Ready.”\n\nPrincipal Subsidiaries\n\nHEWLETT-PACKARD: Hewlett-Packard Puerto Rico; Hewlett-Packard World Trade, Inc.; Heartstream, Inc.; Microsensor Technology, Inc.; VeriFone, Inc.; Hewlett-Packard Asia Pacific Ltd.

Undisputedly the market leader for printers and other electronic products, Hewlett-Packard (HP) nevertheless saw the competition at its heels. Even more important, as technology became more \"personalized\" and accessible to the average person, the company was not sure it could rely solely on its history as a purveyor of electronic goods to businesses and institutions.\n\nHewlett-Packard turned to the San Francisco advertising firm Goodby Silverstein & Partners to create an ad campaign that would give it a more human face and present it as a company responsive to the needs of its customers. Goodby Silverstein designed \"Built by Engineers, Used by Ordinary People,\" a campaign focusing on the new Mopier business printer and the 690 series of DeskJet printers for the home. The campaign, which ran from late 1996 until about the middle of 1997, was designed to appeal to both HP's core customers—businesses—and to recreational or home users of electronics. The consumer ads showed people in situations that could easily be made simpler by the use of Hewlett-Packard products, while the business ads showed the imagination and flexibility of HP's engineering capacity.\n\nHISTORICAL CONTEXT\n\nLike many pioneering companies of the 20th century, Hewlett-Packard was born in a garage. It was founded by engineers David Packard and Bill Hewlett in 1938. At the time the mission was to develop and market a resistance-capacity audio oscillator that could be used to test sound equipment. Hewlett and Packard's $538 in founding capital carried them through until the Walt Disney studios ordered eight of their devices. Then in 1941 the United States entered the Second World War, and an immediate overwhelming need for HP's instruments was created. After the war ended, the company lost its mainstay government orders and decided to seek clients in the private sector. Hewlett-Packard introduced its measuring devices into the flourishing post-war electronics industry. In 1972 the company pioneered personal computing with the world's first handheld scientific calculator, and it then went on to introduce the first desktop mainframe (in 1982) and the LaserJet printer (the first and most prominent of a line of printers for business and home), as well as copiers and scanners.\n\nTARGET MARKET\n\nAlthough Hewlett-Packard held its position as the world's leading supplier of hard-copy products (LaserJet and DeskJet printers, DesignJet large-format printers and plotters, ScanJet scanners, OfficeJet printer-fax-copiers, CopyJet color printer-copiers, and HP FAX facsimile machines), the company became concerned in 1996 that it projected an image too cold and technological for the home-electronics user to relate to. Since HP had a growing customer base of individual consumers, it decided to focus on making its technology seem more accessible.\n\nThe resulting television and print advertising in the \"Built by Engineers, Used by Ordinary People\" campaign targeted two audiences: families with children and business professionals, particularly corporate executives, management information system (MIS) experts, and end users. Creative elements were designed to appeal to low-end users while at the same time showing off the products' high-tech features to viewers well versed in information technology.\n\nCOMPETITION\n\nAlthough Hewlett-Packard remained the market leader for printers, its largest competitors—Canon, Xerox, and Lexmark—were making strenuous efforts to narrow the gap. Also, as high technology moved into people's living rooms, the company saw that other makers of computers and electronic goods—such as Microsoft and Apple, among others—had been able to position themselves as interesting and cutting edge while Hewlett-Packard was viewed by consumers as reliable but stodgy.\n\nCanon, the giant Japanese maker of business machines, cameras, and other optical products, presented a formidable challenge to Hewlett-Packard with its line of laser and BubbleJet printers. Marketing its products under the tag line \"You can with a Canon,\" the company experienced strong growth in its printers during 1997. Canon targeted businesses with such products as the Digital GP215, a multifunctional digital device for networked workgroups that printed, faxed, copied, and scanned. The company also introduced the MultiPASS L90, another multifunctional system, and a new color laser printer, the CLBP 360PS. The BubbleJet continued to defend its market share with a very small and light personal model, the BJC-50, weighing only 900 grams.\n\nXerox Corporation, which introduced the first (manually operated) commercial xerographic product in 1949 and the first automatic office copier in 1959, made its first laser printer in 1977 and by 1991 was developing an extensive printer line. To highlight the company's evolution from copy machines to a wide range of business products, Xerox in 1994 adopted the tag line \"The Document Company, Xerox\" as its new corporate signature. As a document company, Xerox in 1997 introduced an array of specialized printer products for business, including a color printer for signs, banners, and billboards; a printer designed specifically for engineering needs; and the Xerox Productivity Centre System, which allowed users to scan, store, manage, electronically collate, distribute, print, and copy wide-format documents such as those used by architects, mapmakers, and graphic artists.\n\nHP GETS ANOTHER MAKEOVER\n\nAt the end of 1997 Hewlett-Packard launched a second advertising campaign, this one with the tag line \"Expanding Possibilities.\" \"Expanding Possibilities\" grew out of reflections at the company that it was still perceived by consumers simply as the company that makes computer printers. HP had failed to establish a strong corporate identity in the way it wanted to be perceived: as an interesting, even sexy, maker of products that are relevant to the ways ordinary people live.\n\n\"Expanding Possibilities\" differed greatly from \"Built by Engineers, Used by Ordinary People\" in that it did not focus on specific products. Rather, in recognition of the increasing role technology plays in everyday life, it asked viewers to think about the company as more than just the maker of business-related gadgets.\n\nOne way it did this was to make changes, albeit not drastic ones, in the company's use of color. Until then the boxes used to house the company's computers and printers had been a simple white, suggesting scientific prowess and accuracy but also sterility and lack of emotion. The company began using strong, vivid colors on its boxes, consumer manuals, and store displays.\n\nTelevision ads (also developed by Goodby Silverstein & Partners) that began running in November showed new ways for people to use the company's products to make and transmit images. In one spot new parents use a Hewlett-Packard camera and computer to send out birth announcements over the Internet. In another, former Negro League baseball player Buck O'Neil uses HP printers, scanners, and computers to make and sell Negro League baseball cards online.\n\nLexmark brought up the rear in this august assemblage, but it was able to chip away at the other companies' lead during 1997. Lexmark, based in Lexington, Kentucky, was smaller than its competitors and had a narrower product range. It concentrated on laser, ink jet, and dot matrix printers and associated supplies that were comparable but lower-priced than Hewlett-Packard models. In November 1997 Lexmark won the first Annual Peripherals Excellence Award for network laser printers, beating out Hewlett-Packard and Apple.\n\nMARKETING STRATEGY\n\nThe Hewlett-Packard advertising account had been held since 1988 by Saatchi & Saatchi in San Francisco, but the company decided against asking them to carry out the new campaign. According to the San Jose Business Journal, this was partially because of a 1995 print campaign that cost more than $30 million but failed to leave any lasting impression on consumers. Arlene King, peripherals-advertising manager at Hewlett-Packard, had another explanation for the move. \"We wanted to get more visible advertising than we did in the past. We had been with Saatchi for eight years and we were becoming too alike.\" In May 1996 HP chose Goodby Silverstein & Partners in San Francisco to head the $40 million printer advertising account (Saatchi did, however, retain the PC portion of the Hewlett-Packard account). Goodby Silverstein & Partners had previously been known for creative and popular campaigns such as the \"Got Milk?\" ads for the California Milk Processor Board.\n\nIn consumer research, Goodby Silverstein found that most people associated Hewlett-Packard with technical strength and reliability. Therefore, the new campaign needed to link Hewlett-Packard's heritage as an engineering company and its reputation for building reliable products with the usefulness of HP products in \"ordinary\" situations. In short, the challenge was to humanize the face of technical prowess by giving complicated engineering a human face.\n\nThe $10.5 million Goodby Silverstein campaign for Hewlett-Packard, \"Built by Engineers, Used by Ordinary People,\" solved the dilemma by poking gentle fun at its own engineers while illustrating the excellence of HP products, particularly the 693 DeskJet printer, for use in the home, and the LaserJet 5si Mopier (multiple originals copier), a network printer for large-scale commercial use.\n\nThe year-long campaign was two-pronged, targeting both individual consumers and corporate entities. It featured television spots that ran from late November 1996 through late February 1997 on CNN and national networks. Those were supplemented by print ads in publications like Newsweek, the Wall Street Journal, Business Week, Fortune, PC Magazine, PC Week, and PC Computing that ran beyond the close of the television segment. In addition, the San Francisco-based interactive ad agency Red Sky developed an interactive ad that could be viewed on the Internet though the end of February 1997.\n\nThe Goodby Silverstein television spots showed both the ordinary and the extraordinary uses to which Hewlett-Packard printers can be put. In \"Mower,\" the first of the \"corporate side ads,\" a nerdy-looking announcer sporting a bow tie lists what a Mopier can do (print, staple, collate) and then jokes that the only thing it cannot do is mow the lawn. That serves as enough of a challenge to HP engineers, who immediately begin reconfiguring the printer. In the next scene the Mopier is turned on its side charging around an overgrown field, having been transformed by the company's engineers into a lawnmower.\n\nIn a second spot, \"Translation,\" the interviewer asks an HP engineer to explain exactly how a Mopier works. The engineer answers in highly technical jargon, which is translated for the layperson in a running voice-over. In both of these spots the engineers were actual Hewlett-Packard employees.\n\nIn the consumer-oriented spots, the usefulness of HP products in personal situations was demonstrated. In the \"Baby-sitter\" spot, an elderly man babysitting his infant granddaughter panics when she wakes up and begins to cry for her mother. Suddenly he has a brilliant idea: he grabs a picture of the mother and turns on his DeskJet printer. When the mother returns, she sees the grandfather—with a color print of the mother pasted on his face—holding the peacefully sleeping baby.\n\nIn a similar ad (\"Room\"), a teenager whose mother checks up on him through the key hole on his bedroom door fools her into thinking he has finally cleaned his extremely messy room by making a color printout of a picture of the room in a pristine state and positioning it just beyond the key hole.\n\nThe interactive ad developed by Red Sky was an extension of the television and print campaign into the electronic medium. It carried on the playfulness of the television spots but was also very different, using as it did the interactive capabilities of online advertising. As Joel Hladecek, Red Sky's chief creative director, told the San Francisco Business Times, \"There are two rules of advertising in this medium. The audience has the ability to choose what it's interested in, and people will avoid advertising if they can.\"\n\nRed Sky responded by burying the advertising message within entertainment. Their 1997 Pong advertising banner for Hewlett-Packard, promoting the LaserJet Mopier, played off the print and television tag line. Viewers used Shockwave technology to play games of Pong with an engineer named Jerry. They were initially drawn to the ad by the familiar sound of a ping-pong game. They then discovered that the ad was more than just a banner: it was an interactive game in which they could use their mouse to actually play along. The ad ran through February 1997 at various sites.\n\nOUTCOME\n\nThe \"Built by Engineers, Used by Ordinary People\" campaign was pronounced an unqualified success by the company. Post-campaign quantitative research showed that the campaign had been very effective in reaching the desired targets. Those assessments were confirmed by the number of awards the campaign won during 1996 and 1997.\n\nAt the ICON Awards, sponsored by Marketing Computers and Business Week to honor excellence in high technology marketing and advertising, \"Built by Engineers\" won 1996 Best of Show ICONs for \"Baby-sitter,\" \"Room,\" and \"Mower\"; platinum in the best advertising campaign, broadcast category; and gold in the best advertising/television campaign category.\n\nAt the international Clio Awards, which recognize excellence and creativity in consumer advertising, \"Baby-sitter,\" \"Room,\" and \"Mower\" won best national campaign certificates, and \"Baby-sitter\" was also a certificate winner. In addition, Adweek, which publishes an annual list of the 10 best spots of the year, declared \"Baby-sitter\" to be one of the best spots of 1996. The spots won other awards as well, both in local advertising industry shows, such as the San Francisco Show, and in New York-based shows, such as The One Show.\n\nIn Europe the campaign also won a Directors and Art Directors Silver Pencil Award in London for \"Baby-sitter.\" Finally, \"Baby-sitter\" won a Silver Lion at the Cannes Advertising Festival.\n\nThe Red Sky interactive ad also garnered acclaim, in this case from critics of Internet advertising. Microscope, a weekly online Web ad review magazine, rated the banner ad \"a perfect 10\" and called it \"the most attention-getting ad on the Web.\" PC World followed suit, awarding it the number one position in PC World's Top 10 Advertiser Achievement Awards. The ad went on to win a Platinum Award in the 1997 Marketing Computers/Business Week ICON Award for the multimedia category.\n\nFURTHER READING\n\nBeatty, Sally Goll. \"H-P to Get Marketing Makeover.\" Wall Street Journal, November 11, 1997.\n\nBennis, Warren, and Patricia Ward Biedermann.

Steiner\n\nEXPANDING POSSIBILITIES CAMPAIGN\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nAlthough it was widely known and respected in the business world for its solid engineering and reliable products, Hewlett-Packard, a huge company with 121,900 employees and revenues of $42.9 billion in 1997, found itself relatively unknown to the general public. Beginning in the late 1990s, Hewlett-Packard sought to expand its presence in the consumer market. To do so, the company initiated a $75 million consumer brand strategy that included an advertising campaign called \"Expanding Possibilities.\" It was the first time in Hewlett-Packard's 60-year history that it had tried to shed its reputation as an engineering and business firm for a more consumer-oriented image. In 1997 the consumer business accounted for only a quarter of Hewlett-Packard's revenue, but the company saw this segment as being the place where growth would come most rapidly. As the general public became more focused on technology, Hewlett-Packard wanted to have a more prominent place in the consumer's mind.\n\nThe \"Expanding Possibilities\" campaign first appeared in the United States on November 11, 1997, in the form of three television spots that featured color printing applications people could employ in everyday situations. The ads ran through January 1998. They were aired in prime time on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, A&E, and the Discovery Channel. In Canada the spots ran on the Hockey Night, Bravo!, Showcase, Discover, and Life Network channels. Goodby, Silverstein & Partners of San Francisco created the spots. The original \"Expanding Possibilities\" campaign was budgeted at $15 million for the United States and at $40 million globally.\n\nThe \"Mason\" spot showed a couple capturing their newborn baby's wrinkled image on a Hewlett-Packard digital camera. The father downloaded the image onto a Hewlett-Packard computer, created a birth announcement, and E-mailed it to relatives. \"Herta\" featured a grandmother who took family photographs off the wall, scanned them into her Hewlett-Packard PC, and made a family history book for her children and grandchildren. \"Buck\" centered on a former Negro Leagues baseball player, Buck O'Neil, and a young friend who created their own baseball cards with O'Neil's Hewlett-Packard scanner, PC, and printer and then sold them on the Internet.\n\nIn March 1998 Hewlett-Packard added a $12 million brand campaign with two more television spots and a print element, all created by Saatchi & Saatchi of San Francisco. The two 30-second spots ran during sports and news programs in the company's top 10 regional markets in the United States. The schedule later included national exposure on CNN, ESPN, the Discovery Channel, and the Learning Channel. This round of the campaign, unlike the original ads, was aimed toward businesses. In one spot, for example, an airline maintenance worker discovered that it would take five months to produce a revised manual telling workers not to remove the plug in a plane's oil pan. As an alternative, he quickly updated the manual via the Internet. The print ads appeared in the Wall Street Journal for a month. A third group of \"Expanding Possibilities\" ads that were released in October 1998 used print media, on-line services, and radio to reach corporate customers, small businesses, home users, and students.\n\nHISTORICAL CONTEXT\n\nTwo Stanford University engineers, William Hewlett and David Packard, founded the company with $538 in a Palo Alto garage in 1939. Their first major customer, Walt Disney, bought oscillators to help make his film Fantasia. In the 1970s and 1980s Hewlett-Packard became known as an entrepreneurial high-tech company, and it has been credited with establishing Silicon Valley. For years it made the lists of America's best-managed companies. By the late 1980s, however, the company seemed entrapped in a bureaucratic jungle, with burdensome decision making by consensus and other organizational problems. In 1990 Hewlett-Packard was reorganized, and cost-cutting measures included voluntary severance and early-retirement programs. The company's single sales force was divided by product lines, and administrative and manufacturing areas were consolidated.\n\nDuring its history Hewlett-Packard had always been much better known in the business community than among general consumers. It was the world's second largest computer supplier and a leading provider of electronic products and systems for computing, measurement, and communications. But it did not use advertising to appeal directly to consumers. Lewis Platt, then the chairman, president, and CEO of Hewlett-Packard, said that 18 months of focus group testing showed that the public felt the company to be trustworthy and reliable but did not view it as innovative. Hewlett-Packard's reputation stemmed from its engineering-dominated culture, and while people judged its products to be of high quality, they perceived the company as being technical and impersonal.\n\nIn addition, the company's decentralized structure contributed to its fragmented marketing efforts and prevented it from taking full advantage of consumer interactions. For example, the owners of Hewlett-Packard's 75 million ink-jet printers bought from two to five new cartridges a year, but the company did not have a plan to take advantage of these customer contacts.\n\nHewlett-Packard's vision of the future included a blending of consumer electronics, including PCs and communications and entertainment products, with new product categories emerging. The company's goal was to prepare to become the largest consumer electronics supplier by the early 2000s. This would mean becoming much better known among consumers. As the technology battleground moved into the home, however, Hewlett-Packard had to prepare to compete with electronics and entertainment companies such as Sony and General Electric that already had a much higher profile with consumers and that were viewed in more positive terms.\n\nTARGET MARKET\n\nThe primary target of the initial \"Expanding Possibilities\" ads was families with children, but the company also wanted to become better known among small businesses, microbusinesses, and the owners of home businesses. Both business owners and workers were targeted. In Canada, Hewlett-Packard made a direct appeal to entrepreneurs and the self-employed. According to Statistics Canada, the latter group numbered 1.8 million, up 28 percent from 1991 to 1998.\n\nCOMPETITION\n\nIn 1997 and 1998 the consumer demand for sub-$1,000 computers continued to erode profit margins throughout the industry. Many major computer manufacturers responded by going after small and medium-sized businesses and by launching large-scale e-business ventures. The top marketers supported these moves with glossy multi-million-dollar brand advertising campaigns. IBM made the first and most dramatic move in this direction with a $130 million e-business initiative that targeted businesses using the Internet.\n\nAmong Hewlett-Packard's other competitors were Compaq, Dell, and Apple. Compaq spent some $102 million on advertising in 1997 and planned to double the amount in 1998, when it launched its first global brand campaign. Dell spent $43 million on ads in 1997 and planned to double the amount in 1998 to brand itself as the originator and leader in selling directly to the consumer and in providing technical support services to its customers. Apple spent $47 million on its \"Think Different\" campaign, which aimed to link the company's computers with Einstein, Picasso, and other creative people.\n\nMARKETING STRATEGY\n\nTo demonstrate the excitement of its new campaign, Hewlett-Packard hosted a gala announcement event in San Francisco on November 11, 1997. At the kickoff event Hewlett-Packard chairman Platt described the company's image as \"a lab coat that was empty.\" The company had excelled at engineering prowess but never at savvy self-promotion. The new campaign aimed to add to the company's strengths a new spirit of excitement, creativity, and innovation. Along with the new advertising, Hewlett-Packard introduced new product packaging, in-store merchandising, and vending machines for its ink-jet printer supplies.\n\nHEWLETT-PACKARD EARNS HIGH RANKINGS\n\nHewlett-Packard's reputation could be gleaned from the following rankings:\n\nfirst worldwide in sales of ink-jet printers, photo-quality printers, and laser printers\n\nfirst worldwide in sales of acute-care patient-monitoring systems\n\nfirst in reliability for notebooks, desktop PCs, and PC servers (IDC and Dataquest)\n\nfirst in on-site support staff responsiveness, technical knowledge of phone staff, and remote automated diagnostics (Computerworld)\n\nsecond most-admired computers/office equipment company (Fortune, March 1, 1999)\n\nthird most-admired company in Asia (Asian Business, May 1, 1998)\n\ntenth best company to work for in the United States (Fortune, January 11, 1999)\n\nThe introduction of the \"Expanding Possibilities\" campaign meant dropping Goodby, Silverstein & Partners' award-winning campaign that used the tag line \"Built by engineers. Used by normal people.\" One reason for the switch was to dispel the notion that the company was dominated by engineers. \"The consumer brand strategy and advertising campaign aim to make the HP brand more relevant to consumers by revealing the company's dynamic side and dispelling the idea that HP is only a printer company,\" said the firm's Antonio Perez. \"People used to say HP was a great stealth marketer,\" said Jill Kramer, the company's marketing communications manager, in Adweek. \"There's been growing recognition with HP that our brand is truly an asset and that is something we should be investing in. We are becoming more visible and more aggressive.\"\n\nPart of the reason for a move toward consumers was the rapid pace of change. With technology and products evolving so quickly, consumers were easily confused and often felt behind the times. Executives at Hewlett-Packard felt that a finely honed brand identity might attract consumers looking for a guide through the digital and technology jungle. In addition, the company recognized that the market for traditional business products was expanding to include in-home and consumer use. Lower-cost, higher-quality printers, scanners, and all-in-one machines made the products attractive outside the typical corporate or business setting. The campaign also called attention to Hewlett-Packard's Internet products, something it had been producing for years but had never promoted to the public.\n\nHewlett-Packard sometimes referred to the new campaign as \"the real life campaign\" because the strategy was to shine the spotlight on people not usually associated with technology. Grandparents and children were highlighted, and they shared their stories in their own words. The intent was not just to show what people could do with Hewlett-Packard products but also to demonstrate what the products could help people achieve. Hewlett-Packard products were presented as engines for consumers' creative thinking.\n\nAlthough Hewlett-Packard wanted to change its image with the \"Expanding Possibilities\" campaign, there were certain elements in its marketing effort and image that were retained. The company logo and the display of the Hewlett-Packard name with the logo remained the same. The company also maintained continuity with its advertising agencies. Goodby, Silverstein & Partners continued handling the ads for Hewlett-Packard printers and scanners and for the company's other computer equipment. Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising continued the advertising for the company's Pavilion line of personal computers, and Winkler Advertising continued to create the company's ads for laser printer supplies.\n\nOUTCOME\n\nIndependent research showed that the ads were successful in changing the perceptions of consumers. According to Goodby, Silverstein & Partners, studies showed that the ads had helped Hewlett-Packard come to be perceived as a company that \"empowers people to 'make exciting things happen.'\" People's awareness that Hewlett-Packard made more than just printers also increased.\n\nIn March 1998 the Business Journal of San Jose reported that Hewlett-Packard led the market as the top seller of workstations running off Microsoft Windows. It sold nearly 155,000 Windows-based workstations, or 42 percent of the market, in 1997. The journal attributed part of Hewlett-Packard's success to the \"Expanding Possibilities\" campaign.\n\nThe original three \"Expanding Possibilities\" spots won two Icon Awards, and \"Buck\" won a silver Clio.\n\nFURTHER READING\n\nElkin, Tobi. \"Upfront: The Clients—Brands: Computer.\" Adweek, May 18, 1998.\n\n\"HP's New Brand Advertising Campaign Demonstrates How Consumers Can 'Expand Possibilities,'\" Business Wire, November 12, 1997.\n\nJohnson, Bradley. \"Seeing Opening, HP Rushes New Global Ad Effort.\" Adweek, March 2, 1998.\n\n\"The Pack.\" Brandweek, September 28, 1998.\n\nChris John Amorosino\n\nYOU + HP CAMPAIGN\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nLong known as a reliable but predictable maker of computer printers, Hewlett-Packard Company (HP) was, in 2003, engaged in a recasting of its moribund image, a project initiated by HP's chief executive officer, Carly Fiorina, after a divisive 2002 merger with computer company Compaq. That year HP unveiled its most ambitious consumer advertising campaign ever. The new campaign, called \"You + HP,\" featured HP's digital cameras and imaging products, a segment of the Fortune 100 company's operations that was seen as a major growth opportunity.\n\n\"You + HP\" supplemented an ongoing enterprise campaign that had introduced the \"+\" graphic as a means of showcasing HP's partnerships with other companies and institutions and that further positioned the old-line company as a forward-looking, glamorous company in tune with twenty-first-century lifestyles. Developed by HP's main U.S. advertising agency, Goodby, Silverstein & Partners of San Francisco, the campaign broke in October 2003 with the risky use of 20-page print inserts, first in USA Today and later in trendsetting magazines, and went on to feature some of the most talked-about television spots of the time. Directed by Francçois Vogel, the television spots dramatized the digital-photography revolution with visuals integrating still frames and live action, while catchy pop music by the Cure (in the campaign's first year) and the Kinks (in the second year) played as the spots' sound track.\n\nThe print and television portions of \"You + HP\" were well received by industry commentators as well as the general public, and the campaign was credited with effectively updating HP's image for a new generation of consumers. The campaign continued to evolve, and the company's broader marketing efforts kept the \"+ HP\" idea as their starting point. HP's change in direction, however, was not welcomed by all; the company's board of directors ousted Fiorina in 2005.\n\nHISTORICAL CONTEXT\n\nHP had a storied history of innovation and was a Fortune 100 company when Carly Fiorina took over as chief executive officer in 1999. Though the company was well known for its quality products and particularly for its printers, \"it had become clear,\" according to Advertising Age, \"that HP had to do something to change its consumer image.\" HP's takeover of its rival Compaq in 2002—at a time when PC sales (the heart of Compaq's business) were abysmal—raised further questions about the company's direction in the precarious postbubble marketplace. Fiorina and Allison Johnson, HP's senior vice president for global brand and communications, asked agency Goodby, Silverstein & Partners to answer these questions by showcasing the merger itself and then by focusing on other high-profile but previously unpublicized HP partnerships in a large-scale rebranding push that broke in the fall of 2002.\n\nAds touting the merger used an \"HP + Compaq\" graphic to show the strength of the partnership, and the \"+\" sign was then used as a unifying visual symbol in the larger branding campaign, which extolled HP's contributions to an impressive array of corporate and institutional partners. The campaign was launched with \"Anthem,\" a television spot that, as Creativity magazine noted, \"linked HP technology to bigger and cooler things—Dreamworks' imagemaking, FedEx's efficiency, BMW's Formula 1 need for speed.\" Other memorable ads were \"Restore,\" which brought figures from a Dutch master painting to life in order to illustrate the role HP played in restoring art for London's National Gallery, and \"The Next Shift,\" which featured iconic toys—Slinky, Elmo, Spiderman, and others—commuting to work in Manhattan as a way of illustrating HP's involvement in keeping Toys \"R\" Us stores stocked and ready for business. Creativity selected Goodby's HP branding work as its campaign of the year for 2003, arguing that the spots had worked together to \"render formerly square HP a magnetic new personality.\"\n\nMeanwhile the rapid rise in popularity of digital cameras presented one of the few bright spots in the dismal technology sectors of the struggling American economy. As the 2003 holiday season approached, digital cameras were poised to overtake traditional cameras in yearly sales for the first time. Though HP was not known for its cameras, its wide portfolio of products meant that it was positioned to offer consumers an integrated system for home digital photography.\n\nTARGET MARKET\n\n\"You + HP\" specifically targeted consumers, which distinguished the campaign from other HP enterprise and business-to-business efforts. Digital-imaging products were becoming integral to the personal lives of ordinary Americans, so these products in particular offered HP the opportunity to position itself as \"the ultimate lifestyle technology company,\" in the words of Advertising Age.\n\nBecause most of those who were buying digital cameras were first-time purchasers, it was imperative that HP emphasize the simplicity of the new technology. At the same time, simplicity could not be the campaign's main message, because HP did not want to appear to be pointing out consumers' ignorance. Goodby and HP therefore pitched the company's digital-imaging products as vehicles for promoting individuals' creativity and fulfillment. Scott Berg, director of worldwide media for HP, told Adweek, \"Our position was to say the digital camera could become a natural extension of, or appendage to, your being, that you are free from the tyranny of the photo lab.\" By linking the HP brand image with the inspirational notion of personal fulfillment, Fiorina aimed at making the tech giant a true pop-culture brand along the lines of Coca-Cola or Nike. The \"You + HP\" campaign, then, was meant to cut across demographic lines, and it dwarfed all previous HP attempts to target consumers.\n\nTo make the pitch specific to HP, the campaign pointed to the company's full range of products, suggesting that the seamless transition from picture taking to picture printing was possible because HP could satisfy every step of the process. Consumers could take pictures with an HP camera, store and manipulate them on an HP personal computer, and print them using an HP printer, ink cartridge, and paper.\n\nCOMPETITION\n\nGiven its sprawling portfolio HP competed with a wide range of companies, but its \"You + HP\" campaign, while leveraging and further establishing its overall brand identity, directly pitted the company against other digital-camera manufacturers. At the time of the campaign it was number six among digital-camera vendors in the United States, well behind segment leaders Eastman Kodak Company and Sony Corporation.\n\nKodak's success, according to Advertising Age, was chiefly attributable to its \"century-long simple stance that Kodak equals pictures.\" Though hampered somewhat by losses in the rapidly diminishing film-photography side of its business, Kodak could claim, like HP, to offer simple solutions to the entire picture-making process, especially as PCs became unnecessary for printing. Kodak had the industry-leading photo printer as well as the industry-leading online printing and storage site (called the Kodak EasyShare Gallery), and it had kiosks at major retail stores, such as Wal-Mart and CVS, that allowed consumers yet another outlet for printing pictures. Kodak's digital-imaging ads therefore focused on ease of use while reinforcing the company's history of photographic excellence.\n\nSony likewise made appeals to consumers based on its legacy, but that legacy was one of \"quality technology and cutting-edge design,\" according to Advertising Age, rather than one of film photography. This image merged neatly with the company's digital-imaging marketing efforts, which drew attention to the convenient size and sleekness of Sony cameras. In 2005 Sony reinforced its image by unveiling the tagline \"WorryFree Digital Products,\" orchestrating a marketing push with partner retailers to head off the concerns of first-time digital-camera buyers and assure them that its products were simple and easy to use.\n\nTOO COOL?\n\nThough no one argued that Carly Fiorina had been a bold, decisive leader during her tenure at HP, her February 2005 dismissal generated plenty of speculation about the overall value of her contributions to the company. Many pointed to the Compaq acquisition—narrowly approved over the open hostility of Walter Hewlett, son of the company's founder—as an outright blunder, moving HP as it did into a heavy investment in PCs at the expense of its lucrative printer business. Some observers even wondered whether Fiorina's drastic makeover of the HP image, celebrated though it had been in advertising circles, could be classified a success. As analyst Rob Enderle told the San Francisco Chronicle, \"When she took over, HP was kind of stuck in the mud. Now, it's clearly a much more vibrant company, but it's harder to tell what it is. It used to have a clear identity—like your grandpa five years after retirement, really nice but not going anyplace. Now, it has a faster-moving capability, but it would have been nice to keep the warm, fuzzy part.\"\n\nMARKETING STRATEGY\n\n\"You + HP\" was launched with a 20-page print insert in the October 2, 2003, edition of USA Today. The idea of spending $10 million on such an insert, designed to run in about a dozen publications, went against the grain of traditional print advertising for photography brands, which tended to focus on maximum coverage and frequency. Because the campaign was \"more lifestyle-oriented than anything else,\" as Berg told Adweek, the company \"had to find a way to stand out in unique environments\" rather than take a blanket approach to print placement. Goodby's creative team decided that the magazines in which the insert would appear after its launch should be ones whose editorial focus celebrated the power of photography; the team thus chose such titles as Vogue, the New Yorker, People, Entertainment Weekly, InStyle, ESPN: The Magazine, GQ, Travel + Leisure, and Condé Nast Traveler. The inserts put the consumer at the center of HP's message, featuring the word \"You\" in a prominent position on nearly every page, employing vibrant photo collages and statements such as \"You are a point-and-shoot revolutionary with an itchy shutter finger\" and \"You are the Van Gogh of pic files.\" The ads featured the full range of HP digital-imaging products, pointing out the brand's coverage of the entire picture-making process but forgoing the usual listings of technical specifications.\n\nThe campaign's initial television spots, directed by Vogel and shot in Barcelona, further underscored the revolutionary nature of digital-photography technology. In both \"You\" and \"Statue,\" people in social settings and on city streets were frozen in still frames suggesting photographs, while the scenes' action moved on briskly and a continuous stream of individual moments were framed before dissolving back into motion. The fluidity of the movement from human interaction to still frame, along with the profusion of photographic possibilities suggested, communicated the limitless options available to the digital-camera owner while dramatizing the integration of artistic expression and ordinary life. The arresting visual effects worked with the Cure's moody 1989 hit song \"Pictures of You\" to create, as Adweek put it, \"an emotional paean to digital photography.\"\n\nIn 2004 Goodby's creative team planned a second series of television spots to be paired with the upbeat Kinks song \"Picture Book.\" This time the challenge was to go beyond illustrating picture-taking possibilities and find a visual method for dramatizing the ease of printing photos. In a test spot filmed as his bid to direct the new series, Vogel shot himself at his desk putting empty white frames around his head while coolly singing along to the Kinks song playing in the background. Vogel then tweaked the footage until it appeared that he was effortlessly creating a series of casual self-portraits from thin air. Not only did this test ad get him the job, but it was reshot with little alteration as the 30-second spot \"François.\" In the spot \"Picture Book\" the principle of picking photographs out of thin air was applied to crowds of people. At the start of the commercial, two rows of people held frames to their faces, after which the frames became pictures, and then the people traded these self-portraits with one another. In \"Relay\" the photographic frame was passed like a baton between groups and individuals. Photos transformed into dynamic real-life scenes and vice versa as the frame made its way through a hypnotic flux of distinctive people and moments.\n\nOUTCOME\n\n\"You + HP\" was widely acknowledged as a key contributor to the ongoing transformation of the company's image from, as Advertising Age put it, \"well-regarded though stodgy into a brand akin to sexier rivals such as Sony Corp.\" For the print insert that launched the campaign, which \"cut through in a medium that HP's rivals have dominated for decades,\" Goodby was awarded Adweek's Media Plan of the Year for Best Use of Magazines. Goodby's market research indicated that the inserts raised consumers' likelihood to buy HP digital-imaging products by 8 percent. The 2004 television spots generated, according to Goodby and HP, more consumer feedback than either had ever gotten from an ad, and Adweek named \"You + HP\" its Campaign of the Year for 2004. TV Guide's praise went beyond the realm of advertising, claiming that the spot \"Picture Book\" was the best 60 seconds of television then on the air.\n\nIn 2004 HP extended the \"You + HP\" concept to digital music, partnering with Apple to sell HP-branded iPods and offering iTunes software on its PCs. The iPod, an MP3 player that allowed consumers to mix and match music to suit their personalities, offered HP a further vehicle for connecting the personal-expression ethos to its brand image. A business-to-business campaign called \"Change + HP\" was likewise launched in 2004, using the company's new cutting-edge image to appeal to information-technology decision makers in the rapidly evolving tech marketplace. \"You + HP,\" along with the umbrella \"+ HP\" idea and HP's image, continued to evolve through 2005. Whether HP's change in direction was a welcome one remained an open question, however, at least to the company's board of directors. Fiorina was ousted as chief executive officer in February 2005.\n\nFURTHER READING\n\nAnderson, Mae. \"Campaign of the Year: Hewlett-Packard.\" Adweek, February 7, 2005.\n\nBulik, Beth Snyder. \"Hewlett-Packard.\" Advertising Age, December 13, 2004.\n\n―――――――. \"Kodak Scores with Digital Cameras but Film-Biz Losses Cloud Big Picture.\" Advertising Age, April 25, 2005.\n\n―――――――. \"Sony, Kodak Lead U.S. Battle for Share in Digital Cameras.\" Advertising Age, May 31, 2004.\n\n\"Campaign of the Year: HP.\" Creativity, December 2003.\n\nChampagne, Christine. \"Agency Producer: Josh Reynolds.\" Adweek, January 24, 2005.\n\nDolliver, Mark. \"Creative: Portfolio.\" Adweek, October 20, 2003.\n\n\"Goodby, Silverstein & Partners.\" Advertising Age, January 12, 2004.\n\nGranatstein, Lisal. \"Goodby, Silverstein & Partners.\" Adweek, June 21, 2004.\n\n\"HP 'Francois.'\" Creativity, April 2005.\n\nKhermouch, Gerry. \"Can HP Make Consumers' Hearts Race?\" Business Week Online, October 2, 2003.\n\nMaddox, Kate. \"HP Demonstrates Power of Partnerships.\" B to B, October 25, 2004.\n\nParpis, Eleftheria. \"Creative All-Stars.\" Adweek, January 19, 2004.\n\nSaid, Carolyn. \"Fiorina: 'Wicked Smart' but Ultimately Unsuccessful.\" San Francisco Chronicle, February 10, 2005.\n\nWasserman, Todd. \"HP Puts More Focus on Digital Cameras.\" Brandweek, September 1, 2003.\n\nWoodward, Sarah. \"Francois Vogel.\" Shoot, March 26, 2004.\n\nMark Lane\n\nHewlett-Packard Company\n\nalso known as: hp founded: 1939\n\nContact Information:\n\nheadquarters: 3000 hanover st.\n\npalo alto, ca 94304-1185 phone: (650)857-1501 fax: (650)857-7299 email: [email protected] url: http://www.hp.com\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nHewlett-Packard Company (HP) primarily designs, manufactures, and services electronic products and systems for computation, analysis, and measurement. HP offers more than 25,000 products and maintains manufacturing plants, research-and-development centers, warehouses, and administration facilities in more than 120 countries. Sales of computers and related products and services account for approximately 70 percent of the company's revenue. With 1997 net revenues of $42.9 billion, Hewlett-Packard is the nation's second-largest computer company and one of the fastest growing. The company is number 16 on the Fortune 500 list of the largest U.S. corporations and a leader in most of the markets in which it competes. These markets include servers, workstations, personal computers (including portables), computer peripherals, network equipment, and handheld calculators. Other products include electric test and measurement equipment, analytical instruments, and medical equipment. HP has become one of the largest diversified companies in the world, generating more than 55 percent of its business outside the United States.\n\nCOMPANY FINANCES\n\nMost of Hewlett-Packard's income comes from its broad range of computer products and peripherals, accounting for more than $35 billion of HP's total 1997 revenues. The company is the world's revenue leader for RISC and UNIX-based computers and the second largest supplier of workstations for engineering and business applications. Net revenue from the United States rose 12 percent in 1997, while international revenue grew 11 percent and accounted for 56 percent of total revenues. The company boasted a comfortable 1997 operating profit of 10.1 percent and net profit of 7.3 percent, with a return on assets of 9.8 percent. Strong earnings growth contributed to an increase of $1.6 billion in net cash, enabling the Board of Directors to add $1.0 billion to the authorization for repurchase of the company's common stock. During a 52-week period from 1997 to 1998, HP's stock reached a high of $82.00 (and a low of $50.00). Despite losses in early 1998, Hewlett Packard remained in excellent financial condition enabling it to easily continue investing in future growth.\n\nANALYSTS' OPINIONS\n\nSecond only to IBM among the world's manufacturers of computer equipment and related technologies, Hewlett-Packard's history of consistently strong performance has always appealed to investors and analysts. The company itself remained confident in 1998 that it had the product offerings and resources needed for continuing success, though it warned that future revenue and margin trends could not be safely predicted. Indeed, that unpredictability caused investors to flee HP in the spring of 1998 after the company announced weaker than expected profits in the first quarter. No fewer than six firms and many analysts who had formerly been \"bullish\" on Hewlett-Packard slashed estimates on HP. HP blamed the drop in earnings on weakness in the Asian market and severe competition in the PC market. Also contributing to the decline was increasing erosion of HP's leading share in the workstation market caused by competitor Dell Computer. Analysts noted that, unlike IBM, Hewlett Packard did not have a major services business to fall back on when times were tough in the hardware market. Nevertheless, though both HP and investors were disappointed by the company's 1998 first quarter results, no one expected the setback to damage the company in the long term. New HP initiatives in the Internet arena also helped boost confidence.\n\nHISTORY\n\nStanford University electrical engineers William Hewlett and David Packard began their joint venture in 1938 out of a Palo Alto garage with $538.00.
