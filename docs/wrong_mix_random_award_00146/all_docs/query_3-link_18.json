        "text": "The Associated Anesthesiologists Medical Group (AAMG) is the oldest existing anesthesiology group in the Palo Alto area. Established in 1949 as a clinical team serving the Palo Alto Hospital, the Associated Anesthesiologists were part of the original staff of the Palo Alto-Stanford Hospital in 1959 when the Stanford Medical School moved from San Francisco to Palo Alto.\n\nThe Associated Anesthesiologists Medical Group is a small group–only seven physicians–who are leaders in the field of anesthesiology. Our President, Dr. Michael Champeau, is currently the President of the American Society of Anesthesiologists, and is a Past-President of the California Society of Anesthesiologists. Dr. Bryan Bohman is a past Chief of Staff at Stanford University Hospital. Dr. Richard Novak served as Deputy Chief of Anesthesiology at Stanford University Hospital from 2001- 2015 and 2019 – 2021.\n\nMembers of AAMG are all private practitioners – physician anesthesiologists certified by the American Board of Anesthesiology — who provide anesthesia care without relying on nurse anesthetists, anesthesia residents, or interns.The anesthesiologists of the AAMG work with surgeons in the Palo Alto area, typically those surgeons who are neither part of the Palo Alto Medical Foundation nor employees of Stanford University School of Medicine. The group provides anesthetic services at Stanford University Hospital as well as numerous surgery centers and surgeon offices in Silicon Valley.\n\nYou may contact the office of the Associated Anesthesiologists Medical Group at 650-323-0617, or write at 885 Oak Grove Avenue, Suite 207, Menlo Park, CA 94025-4441."
