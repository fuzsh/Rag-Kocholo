That’s driving efficiencies back into the business so we can do more..”\n\nRICK DELOACH\n\nDirector of IT Security, ADT\n\nPalo Alto Networks is not just a security vendor,” he told them. “They’re a critical partner of the business. If we don’t have Palo Alto, we don’t have security.\n\nAli Khan\n\nChief Information Security Officer, Better\n\n“We needed a partner whose expertise could help us think through the requirements, avoid decision fatigue, and help create a best practice model—which we did through Palo Alto Networks.”\n\nRON JILLSON\n\nHead of Cyber Security, Resolution Life Australasia\n\n“Cortex XSOAR was the central nervous system of our stadium cybersecurity, it enriched specific incidents, automatically determining whether it can be auto-remediated or required investigation by an analyst.”\n\nKAMRAN SHAH\n\nInformation Security, Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy\n\n“In five years, Nuffield Health has halved the number of security vendors. There are now less places to look when there’s an incident, everything is integrated, and threat responsiveness is faster and more effective.”\n\nED MOSS\n\nHead of Enabling IT, Nuffield Health\n\n“As we scale and digitize more of our operations, we trust Palo Alto Networks to be beside us. Their unified platform makes it significantly easier to manage our operations, they are continually innovating the product suite, and the support and expertise we receive here in Turkey are second to none.\n\nMURAT ÇALIŞIRIŞÇI\n\nDirector IT and Toll Collection Systems, Avrasya Tüneli"
