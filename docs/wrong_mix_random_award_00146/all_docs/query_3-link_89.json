        "text": "Preliminary permits have been filed for a new residential master plan at 2100-2400 Geng Road in Palo Alto, Santa Clara County. The sprawling project will bring over a hundred apartments and more parking to an office campus next to other offices, San Francisquito Creek, and near the waterfront Baylands Nature Preserve. San Francisco-based Strada Investment Group is responsible for the application.\n\nThe project will bring 159 units to 33 structures across the 11-acre property. The developer is seeking streamlined approval through Senate Bill 423, an update to SB 35. The SB330 pre-application will set 32 units to be designated as affordable to low-income households. Parking will be provided for 358 cars, including covered parking and 40 open spaces.\n\nAccording to the project plans, the State Density Bonus program will still help the developer with “waivers from the applicable maximum height, maximum site coverage, minimum landscape, and open space coverages, and minimum private street width requirements.”\n\nDahlin is the project architect. The collage-style apartment complexes will be clad with a familiar mix of stucco, Hardie lap siding, cement panels trim, and metal. The site plan will spread the nearly three-dozen structures around an interior road network and landscaping. Details about outdoor amenities have yet to be shared. Vehicular traffic will connect to Geng Road, with an easement close to East Bayshore Road.\n\nStrada Investment Group has been an active developer across the region, with several recent projects under construction or completed. The developer is currently overseeing the tallest active construction project in San Francisco at 555 Bryant Street and one of the larger active jobs rising in Oakland for Samuel Merritt University. Other projects by the developer have yet to start construction, including at San Francisco’s 395 3rd Street, Pier 30-32, and Two Stockton Street.\n\nThe triangular property abuts the Baylands Athletic Center near a Highway 101 cloverleaf intersection. The estimated cost and timeline for construction have yet to be established."
