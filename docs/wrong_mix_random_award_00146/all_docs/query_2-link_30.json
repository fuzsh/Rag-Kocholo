PAN-OS is the software that runs all Palo Alto Networks next-generation firewalls. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow for arbitrary code execution in the context of the root user. Depending on the privileges associated with the user, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>",
