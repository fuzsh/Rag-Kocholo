The branch is located near Palo Alto College, Texas A&M University at San Antonio, the Toyota Motor Manufacturing Texas assembly plant, the Senator Frank Madla Transit Center, Mitchell Lake Audubon Park, and Medina River Park. Cortez serves schools in the South San Independent School District. The library provides service to Bexar county communities including Somerset and Von Ormy.

Freedom of Expression Areas are specifically designated areas on San Antonio Public Library grounds where free expression activities may occur.\n\nLibrary Freedom of Expression Policy\n\nHistory\n\nThe Cortez Branch Library is named in honor of Raoul A. Cortez (1904 – 1971), the pioneer of Spanish language radio and television stations in the United States. Cortez founded KCOR-AM, which in 1946 became the first full-time Spanish language radio station in the United States. In 1955, he established the television station known today as KWEX-TV, the country’s first Spanish language television station. Active in civic affairs, he served two terms as the national president of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) and supported legal battles fighting discrimination against Mexican-Americans. An active member of the business community, he founded the Charro Association and was a member of the Mexican Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThe Raoul A. Cortez Branch Library opened in April 12, 1981 at a cost of $653,761, which was financed through the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG). The branch has since received several renovations and building improvements. In 1995, the branch acquired new lighting, paint, carpeting, handicap upgrades, and the installation of four new public access terminals funded through a 1989 bond.\n\nIn 2004, Guillermo Nicolas, grandson of Raoul A. Cortez, raised and donated money for interior and exterior improvement to the Cortez Branch. Mr. Nicolas organized a major landscaping project with 80 volunteers enlisted from partner KSTX public radio. The exterior of the building was transformed into a colorful xeriscape garden. In 2005, The San Antonio Library Foundation was awarded $50,000 through an AT&T grant to purchase new computers for the Cortez Branch.\n\nIn 2007, the branch received funds through a 2003 bond and the CDBG for the expansion of the meeting room, installation of new air conditioning, renovation of the lobby and restrooms, upgrades to the electrical and security system, and general facility repairs. Most recently, in 2009, the Cortez Branch received funds through a 2007 bond and the CDBG for the expansion of the lobby and other building upgrades.\n\nSquare footage of the building: 9,834>\n\nSquare footage of the meeting room: 1,260 (Call for availability)"
