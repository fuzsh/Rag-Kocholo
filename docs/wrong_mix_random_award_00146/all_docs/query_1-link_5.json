        "text": "Existing Zones\n\nâYou already have pre-existing zones that you created for use in User-IDâ¢ or various policies (security policy rules, QoS policy rules, zone protection, and packet buffer protection). You must map the pre-existing zones to the predefined zones that SD-WAN uses so the firewall can properly forward traffic. You should continue to use your pre-existing zones in all of your policies because the new predefined zones are used only for SD-WAN forwarding. You will map the zones when you to Add SD-WAN Devices to Panorama by creating your CSV file. (If you arenât using a CSV file, you will map zones when you configure\n\nPanorama\n\nSD-WAN\n\nDevices\n\nand add existing zones to\n\nZone Internet\n\n,\n\nZone to Hub\n\n,\n\nZone to Branch\n\n, and\n\nZone Internal\n\n.)\n\nThe result of mapping is that a branch or hub firewall can do a forwarding lookup to determine the egress SD-WAN interface and thus the egress zone. If you donât map pre-existing zones to predefined zones, an allowed session wonât use SD-WAN. The mapping is necessary because existing customers have different zone names in place, and the firewall must narrow all of those zone names down to the predefined zones. You donât necessarily have to map zones to all of the predefined zones, but you should map existing zones to at least the\n\nZone to Hub\n\nand\n\nZone to Branch\n\nzones."
