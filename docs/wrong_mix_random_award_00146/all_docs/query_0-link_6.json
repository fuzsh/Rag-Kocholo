        "text": "Pitcher has made a name for ourselves in this industry. From the development of the Pitcher Barrel Sampler, to the high profile projects we routinely work on, we are a trusted name in geotechnical investigation.\n\n“I just wanted to compliment Bryce and Nathan on a job well done – they were great yesterday. They completed the scope of work in good time with no hassle and got all the info we needed, despite the 106 degree heat.\n\nAlso, thanks again to you and your team for the great follow-through with getting our Purchase Order authorized on such short notice.” – Brand Burfield, Intertek PSI\n\n“I also wanted to pass along the message that it nice seeing the crews work together. The CPT crew was looking for opportunities to help out the drill crew. For example, Bryce would get a wrench on the drill pipe whenever he saw a chance to help out.” – Client in San Francisco, September 2023\n\nFor more than 90 years Pitcher has been delivering reliable and quality geotechnical and near-shore drilling and testing solutions. We are proud of our partnership with the Operating Engineers local #3 and #12 unions and our affiliation with Gregg Drilling and Sealaska."
