        "text": "During an investigation, you can write a UDM Search query to display details about one or more entities (for example, an IP address, user, or asset) in addition to the events and alerts that match the search query terms.\n\nOn systems that use data RBAC, you can only see data that matches your scopes. For more information, see data RBAC impact on Search.\n\nWhen a search query includes a condition that identifies a specific entity (for example, principal.ip=\"10.0.31.20\"), the search results include details about the entity (if present in your enterprise) in addition to UDM events that match the entire search query.\n\nThe search results pane includes the following tabs:\n\nOverview—Details about one or more specific entities.\n\nEvents—Search results that match the entire search query and search time range.\n\nAlerts—Alerts generated by events that match the entire search query.\n\nUDM Search query conditions can include both UDM fields (principal.hostname=\"alice\") and grouped fields (hostname=\"alice\").\n\nThe UDM Search query can include multiple conditions, each specifying a different entity identifier. Example queries include the following:\n\nprincipal.hostname=\"alicehost\" and user=\"alice\"\n\nprincipal.hostname=\"alicehost\" and (user=\"kai\" or user=\"alice\")\n\nprincipal.hostname=\"alicehost\" and target.hostname=\"altostrat.com\"\n\nprincipal.hostname=\"alicehost\" and hash=\"40a80612aaa8a8a36aa82a1278aaa02a\"\n\nhostname=\"alicehost\" and domain=/altostrat.com/ nocase\n\nuser=\"alice\" and domain=/altostrat.com/ nocase\n\nThe following table includes example UDM Search queries for one or more entities and the type of information displayed:\n\nInformation type Example UDM Search queries Asset\n\nhostname=\"laptop-kai\"\n\nprincipal.hostname=\"laptop-kai\"\n\nprincipal.ip=\"10.0.0.76\" //(private IP address)\n\nprincipal.mac=\"c5:0c:9c:aa:bb:c4\"\n\nprincipal.hostname=\"laptop-kai\" and metadata.event_type = \"NETWORK_CONNECTION\"\n\nhostname=\"laptop-kai\" or hostname=\"desktop-kai\"\n\nDomain\n\ndomain=\"example.com\"\n\ntarget.hostname=\"example.com\"\n\nFile\n\nhash=\"44a88612faa8a8f36ae82a1278aaa02a\"\n\nprincipal.process.file.md5=\"a00000a75f2a35130aa7a7aaa09aaa7a\"\n\nIP\n\nip=\"8.8.8.8\"\n\ntarget.ip=\"203.0.113.204\" //(public IP address)\n\nUser\n\nuser=\"alice\"\n\ntarget.user.email_address=\"smitha@example.com\"\n\nprincipal.user.userid=\"alice\" or target.user.userid = \"smitha\"\n\nemail=\"john@altostrat.com\" or email=\"alice@example.com\"\n\nprincipal.user.userid=\"smitha\"\n\nOverview tab\n\nThe Overview tab displays entity information in one of the following predefined information types. The information presented varies depending on the information type.\n\nAsset details\n\nDomain details\n\nFile details\n\nIP details\n\nUser details\n\nAsset details\n\nWhen the UDM Search query includes a condition that returns a specific asset, for example principal.hostname=\"laptop-will\" or principal.ip=\"10.0.0.76\", the Overview tab displays the Asset view with information in the following panels:\n\nSearch summary—Displays the following information:\n\nDetails about the entity, including the IP address and MAC address associated with the asset during the search time range. The IP address and MAC address can also be used to identify an entity and can by clicked to display additional information in the entity viewer. It also displays the first time the asset was seen in your enterprise and when it was last (most recently) seen. You can click either timestamp (first or last) to run a new search using that time.\n\nDetails about alerts, including a graph showing the number of alerts that involved the entity within the search time range. The panel also lists a subset of rules with the highest number of alerts.\n\nClick Open Alerts & IOCs to see all alerts generated during the same search time range.\n\nClick View In Alerts Tab to switch to the Alerts tab on this page and start a new search against the selected entity.\n\nClick one of the bars on the chart to switch to the Alerts tab on this page and start a new search against the selected entity, using the time range of the clicked bar.\n\nClick the View more link to open the Entity fields view and display all of the entity fields associated with the asset. To copy an entity field to the clipboard, click the checkbox next to the entity field, click View actions, and click Copy entity. Click the checkbox at the top to select all of the entities.\n\nRelevant IOCs—Displays IOCs associated with the asset. IOCs assigned a higher severity are displayed first. Clicking the IOC name opens the entity viewer to the right.\n\nAssociated entities—Displays other entities that this asset is related to, such as users who signed in to the asset. The panel displays the type of entity, when it was first seen in the environment, and when it was last (most recently) seen. It also displays any namespaces associated with an asset. Click an entity to open the Entity context panel. Click Show all time to display the associated entities over the entire available time period as opposed to the range specified in the UDM search.\n\nEntity context—Displays details about the entity you selected in the Associated entities panel.

Many adversaries use the same domain and subdomain for their attacks. For example, if you search for target.hostname=\"sandbox.altostrat.com\", this panel displays two subdomains, test.sandbox.altostrat.com and staging.sandbox.altostrat.com.\n\nPrevalence of assets—Shows the number of assets in your enterprise that have connected to the domain for the entire time period of the data stored in your Google Security Operations account. Each bar of the graph represents the number of unique assets in your enterprise that have connected to the domain on a UTC day.
