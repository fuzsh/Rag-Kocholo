Entity resolution attempts to answer the question âWho is who?ââi.e., to determine whether multiple data records actually refer to the same physical entity or different physical entities. For example, data records identifying two women with different last names may in fact refer to the same woman having both a familial surname and a married surname. Relationship resolution attempts to answer the question âWho knows whom?â in order to determine benefits and/or risks of relationships among identities, such as customers, employees, vendors, and so forth, e.g., by cross-referencing data from various sources. For example, a relationship may be identified between two individuals sharing a common address or telephone number.\n\nAn example of an entity resolution application is InfoSphere Identity Insight, available from International Business Machines Corp. (IBMÂ®) of Armonk, N.Y.\n\nEmbodiments of the invention provide a computer-implemented method, computer program product and system for performing an operation that includes determining a likeness score between a first entity and a second entity in an entity resolution system.\n\nEach entity includes one or more identity records representing a corresponding physical entity assumed to exist by the entity resolution system. Further, each identity record includes a data record containing one or more attributes characterizing the corresponding physical entity.\n\nthe operation also includes determining that the likeness score does not satisfy a defined threshold for resolving the first entity and the second entity into a single entity.\n\nthe operation also includes identifying a set of one or more entities related to the first entity and a set of one or more entities related to the second entity.\n\nthe operation also includes adjusting the likeness score based on an intersect of the two sets and by operation of one or more computer processors, wherein the intersect includes at least a third entity.\n\nthe operation also includes upon determining that the adjusted likeness score satisfies the defined threshold, determining that the first entity and the second entity represent the same physical entity within the entity resolution system.\n\nFIG. 1A is a block diagram illustrating a system for entity resolution, according to one embodiment of the invention.\n\nFIG. 1B depicts a technique for resolving entities based on commonly related entities, according to one embodiment of the invention.\n\nFIG. 3 illustrates another example of entities for which the application may adjust a likeness score based on discovered relationships, according to one embodiment of the invention.\n\nFIG. 4 illustrates an example of entities for which the application may adjust a likeness score based on disclosed relationships, according to one embodiment of the invention.\n\nFIG. 5 illustrates an example of entities that the application may refrain from resolving as a result of relationships to a common entity, according to one embodiment of the invention.\n\nFIG. 6 illustrates an example of entities that the application may refrain from resolving as a result of an entity with an undesirably large number of relationships, according to one embodiment of the invention.\n\nFIG. 7 is a flowchart depicting a method for resolving entities based on relationships to a common entity, according to one embodiment of the invention.\n\nFIG. 8 is a flowchart depicting a method for determining a set of one or more common entities, according to one embodiment of the invention.\n\nFIG. 9 is a block diagram depicting components of the application for entity resolution, according to one embodiment of the invention.\n\nEmbodiments of the invention provide an application for entity resolution configured to process data records based on relevant identities, entities, conditions, activities or events.\n\nthe application maintains a universe of knowledge of distinct physical entities known to the entity resolution systemâor more specifically, assumed by the entity resolution system to exist in the physical world.\n\neach physical entity is represented by a respective logical entity, also referred to herein as an entity.\n\nEach logical entity is a set of one or more data records determined to pertain to the physical entity represented by the respective logical entityâi.e., as opposed to other physical entities known to the entity resolution system.\n\neach logical entity is a set of data records containing one or more attributes describing the particular physical entity that is represented by the respective logical entity.\n\na data record is also referred to herein as an identity record.\n\na logical entity representing a physical entity known to the entity resolution system is also referred to as a known (or existing) logical entity.\n\na physical entity may be any identifiable entity believed by the entity resolution system to exist in the physical world, such as individual, an organization, a location, a building, a vehicle, an animal, an object, etc.\n\nthe application determines whether the data record being processed pertains to a physical entity known to the entity resolution system. If so, the application adds the data record to the set for the physical entityâi.e., the data record being processed and the set representing the physical entity are consolidated or merged into a single logical entity.\n\nthe data record being processed may also be regarded by the entity resolution system having its own logical entity of which the data record is part. Determining that the data record (or its logical entity) pertains to a particular physical entity known to the entity resolution system may also be referred to herein as âresolvingâ the data record (or its logical entity) to the logical entity representing the particular physical entity.\n\nthe application may additionally create a relationship between the logical entity of the data record and a known, logical entity in the entity resolution system.\n\nthe application may nevertheless determine that the data record describes a physical entity that bears some relationship to a known, physical entity.\n\nthe relationship may refer to an employer-employee relationship, a spousal relationship, a vendor-customer relationship, etc. The determination may be made at least in part based on information contained in the data record.\n\nan inbound identity record refers to any identity record that is to be evaluated (or re-evaluated) against known, logical entities, to determine whether to resolve the identity record to (or split the identity record from) a known, logical entity.\n\na logical entity refers to a set of one or more identity records that are believed by the entity resolution system to describe the same physical entity.\n\na home address and telephone number from hotel check-in records may be used to match him as being the same person as a âRobert Smithâ having the same address and phone number.\n\nthe identity record describing âBob Smithâ is compared to a set of entities, each representing a distinct individual.\n\nthe process of resolving identity records and detecting relationships between entities may be performed using pre-determined or configurable entity resolution rules.\n\nrelationships between two entities are derived from information (e.g., a shared address, employer, telephone number, etc.) in identity records relating to the entities that indicate a relationship between the two entities.\n\ninformation e.g., a shared address, employer, telephone number, etc.\n\nTwo examples of such rules include the following:\n\nthe application for entity resolution may also include rules for detecting relevant identities, identities, conditions, or events, i.e., rules for generating alerts based on incoming identity records.\n\na rule may check the attributes of an inbound identity record and generate an alert when a particular match is found (e.g., the inbound identity record is of interest because it includes an address within a particular zip-code).\n\nan alert rule may specify situations where an assigned role of an inbound identity record conflicts with an assigned role of another identity record with which the inbound record has a relationship at zero or more degrees (e.g., an identity with an assigned role of âEmployeeâ has a strong relationship to an identity with an assigned role of âVendorâ).\n\nan alert rule may be defined as a combination of both methods (e.g., alert whenever an identity with the âNevada Gaming Black Listâ role also has the âHotel Guestâ role and the hotel involved is located in the state of âNevadaâ).\n\nalert rules may be tailored to suit the needs of a particular case.\n\nthe application generates an alert when the existence of a particular identity record (typically an inbound record being processed) causes some condition to be satisfied that is relevant in some way and that may require additional scrutiny by a user (e.g., a business analyst, an investigator of a police department, etc.).\n\na user e.g., a business analyst, an investigator of a police department, etc.\n\nthe result of these processes is typically a list of alerts about identities that should be examined by the user.\n\nSuch alerts may assist the user in identifying both benefits (e.g., potential opportunities) and risks (e.g., potential threats and/or fraud).\n\nthe application evaluates attributes in conjunction with relationships to determine whether a first entity and a second entity should be resolved into a single entity. To this end, the application may compare the first entity with the second entity to determine that the first entity and the second entity nearly satisfy an entity resolution rule. More specifically, the application may compare attributes of the first entity and the second entity to determine a likeness score for the two entities.\n\nthe entity resolution rule specifies criteria for resolving the first entity and the second entity into a single entity.\n\nan identity record may come close to satisfying the entity resolution rule by having a likeness score narrowly falling short (e.g., by no more than a prescribed numerical extent) of a threshold score defined by the entity resolution rule.\n\nthe application may identify entities related to the first entity and the second entity.\n\nthe application adjusts the likeness score based on the entities commonly related to the first entity and the second entity.\n\nthe likeness score may be adjusted past the threshold.\n\nthe first entity and the second entity may be determined to satisfy the entity resolution rule, based on the first entity and the second entity being related to a third entity.\n\nan identity record for Jenny Smith does not satisfy an entity resolution rule that, upon being satisfied, would trigger resolving the identity record to an entity with a name of Jennifer Smith.\n\nboth Jenny Smith and Jennifer Smith have a relationship with a third personâRobert Smith.\n\nthe application could reevaluate the likeness score for the identify record (of Jenny Smith) and the entity of Jennifer Smith, based on the shared relationship to a third party (Robert Smith). Assuming this raises the likeness score past the threshold set for a particular case, the inbound identity record would then be resolved to entity representing Jennifer Smith.\n\nthe threshold score may be a parameter defined by the entity resolution system.\n\nthe threshold score is not associated with any particular entity resolution rule.\n\nthe application may perform entity resolution with an improved accuracy at least in some cases, relative to alternative approaches that merely consider attributes and not relationships in resolving entities. For instance, the application may correctly resolve two entities into a single entity even in cases where the attributes are insufficient to indicate that the two entities should be resolved.\n\naspects of the present invention may be embodied as a system, method or computer program product. Accordingly, aspects of the present invention may take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment (including firmware, resident software, micro-code, etc.) or an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects that may all generally be referred to herein as a âcircuit,â âmoduleâ or âsystem.â Furthermore, aspects of the present invention may take the form of a computer program product embodied in one or more computer readable medium(s) having computer readable program code embodied thereon.\n\nthe computer readable medium may be a computer readable signal medium or a computer readable storage medium.\n\na computer readable storage medium may be, for example, but not limited to, an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system, apparatus, or device, or any suitable combination of the foregoing.\n\na computer readable storage medium may be any tangible medium that can contain, or store a program for use by or in connection with an instruction execution system, apparatus or device.\n\na computer readable signal medium may include a propagated data signal with computer readable program code embodied therein, for example, in baseband or as part of a carrier wave. Such a propagated signal may take any of a variety of forms, including, but not limited to, electro-magnetic, optical, or any suitable combination thereof.\n\na computer readable signal medium may be any computer readable medium that is not a computer readable storage medium and that can communicate, propagate, or transport a program for use by or in connection with an instruction execution system, apparatus, or device.\n\nProgram code embodied on a computer readable medium may be transmitted using any appropriate medium, including but not limited to wireless, wireline, optical fiber cable, RF, etc., or any suitable combination of the foregoing.\n\nComputer program code for carrying out operations for aspects of the present invention may be written in any combination of one or more programming languages, including an object oriented programming language such as JavaTM, SmalltalkTM, C++ or the like and conventional procedural programming languages, such as the âCâ programming language or similar programming languages.\n\nthe program code may execute entirely on the user's computer, partly on the user's computer, as a stand-alone software package, partly on the user's computer and partly on a remote computer or entirely on the remote computer or server.\n\nthe remote computer may be connected to the user's computer through any type of network, including a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN), or the connection may be made to an external computer (for example, through the Internet using an Internet Service Provider).\n\nLAN local area network\n\nWAN wide area network\n\nInternet Service Provider for example, AT&T, MCI, Sprint, EarthLinkTM, MSN, GTE, etc.\n\nThese computer program instructions may also be stored in a computer readable medium that can direct a computer, other programmable data processing apparatus, or other devices to function in a particular manner, such that the instructions stored in the computer readable medium produce an article of manufacture including instructions which implement the function/act specified in the flowchart and/or block diagram block or blocks.\n\nthe computer program instructions may also be loaded onto a computer, other programmable data processing apparatus, or other devices to cause a series of operational steps to be performed on the computer, other programmable apparatus or other devices to produce a computer implemented process such that the instructions which execute on the computer or other programmable apparatus provide processes for implementing the functions/acts specified in the flowchart and/or block diagram block or blocks.\n\nEmbodiments of the invention may be provided to end users through a cloud computing infrastructure.\n\nCloud computing generally refers to the provision of scalable computing resources as a service over a network.\n\nCloud computing may be defined as a computing capability that provides an abstraction between the computing resource and its underlying technical architecture (e.g., servers, storage, networks), enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.\n\ncloud computing allows a user to access virtual computing resources (e.g., storage, data, applications, and even complete virtualized computing systems) in âthe cloud,â without regard for the underlying physical systems (or locations of those systems) used to provide the computing resources.\n\ncloud computing resources are provided to a user on a pay-per-use basis, where users are charged only for the computing resources actually used (e.g., an amount of storage space consumed by a user or a number of virtualized systems instantiated by the user).\n\na user can access any of the resources that reside in the cloud at any time and from anywhere across the Internet.\n\nthe application for entity resolution may execute in the cloud. Having the application execute in the cloud allows the user to manage the entity resolution from any computing system attached to a network connected to the cloud (e.g., the Internet).\n\neach block in the flowchart or block diagrams may represent a module, segment or portion of code, which comprises one or more executable instructions for implementing the specified logical function(s).\n\nthe functions noted in the block may occur out of the order noted in the figures. For example, two blocks shown in succession may, in fact, be executed substantially concurrently, or the blocks may sometimes be executed in the reverse order, depending upon the functionality involved.\n\nFIG. 1A is a block diagram illustrating a system 100 for entity resolution, according to one embodiment of the invention.\n\nthe networked system 100 includes a computer 102 that is connected to a data source 170 via a network 130 .\n\nthe computer 102 may also be connected to other computers via the network 130 .\n\nthe data source 170 stores identity records to be sent to the application 150 and/or entities that the identity records are resolved against.\n\nthe network 130 may be a telecommunications network and/or a wide area network (WAN).\n\nWAN wide area network\n\nthe network 130 is the Internet.\n\nthe computer 102 generally includes a processor 104 connected via a bus 112 to a memory 106 , a network interface device 110 , a storage 108 , an input device 114 , and an output device 116 .\n\nthe computer 102 is generally under the control of an operating system. Examples of operating systems include UNIX, versions of the Microsoft WindowsÂ® operating system, and distributions of the LinuxÂ® operating system. (Note: Linux is a trademark of Linus Torvalds in the United States and other countries.) More generally, any operating system supporting the functions disclosed herein may be used.\n\nthe processor 104 is included to be representative of a single CPU, multiple CPUs, a single CPU having multiple processing cores, and the like.\n\nthe memory 106 may be a random access memory.\n\nthe memory 106 is shown as a single identity, it should be understood that the memory 106 may comprise a plurality of modules, and that the memory 106 may exist at multiple levels, from high speed registers and caches to lower speed but larger DRAM chips.\n\nthe network interface device 110 may be any type of network communications device allowing the computer 102 to communicate with other computers via the network 130 .\n\nthe storage 108 may be a persistent storage device. Although the storage 108 is shown as a single unit, the storage 108 may be a combination of fixed and/or removable storage devices, such as fixed disc drives, solid state drives, floppy disc drives, tape drives, removable memory cards or optical storage. The memory 106 and the storage 108 may be part of one virtual address space spanning multiple primary and secondary storage devices. Further, as described above, the application 150 receives identity records and/or entities from the data source 170 . Additionally or alternatively, the application 150 may also receive identity records and/or entities via the storage 108 .\n\nthe input device 114 may be any device for providing input to the computer 102 .\n\na keyboard and/or mouse may be used.\n\nthe output device 116 may be any device for providing output to a user of the computer 102 .\n\nthe output device 116 may be any conventional display screen or set of speakers, along with their respective interface cards, i.e., video cards and sound cards (not shown).\n\nthe output device 116 and input device 114 may be combined.\n\na display screen with an integrated touch-screen may be used.\n\nthe memory 106 of the computer 102 includes an application 150 for entity resolution, entities 152 and relationships 156 between the entities 152 .\n\nthe application 150 may process inbound identity records to resolve the inbound identity records to one or more of the entities 152 .\n\nEach identity record may include one or more attributes 154 .\n\nan inbound identity record may also be regarded as a new entity by the application 150 âat least until the application 150 determines whether to resolve the new entity as referencing an already known entity.\n\nEach relationship 156 may be a disclosed relationship or a discovered relationship.\n\na disclosed relationship refers to any user-specified relationship between entities, such as an emergency contact in an employee file, references on an employment application, beneficiaries on an insurance policy, etc.\n\na discovered relationship refers to any relationship that is not user-specified and that is inferred by the application 150 based on similarities between attributes of entities. At least in some embodiments, the application 150 creates a discovered relationship between two entities when attributes of the two entities are sufficient to indicate that the entities are likely related but insufficient to indicate that the entities should be resolved into a single entity. For example, a discovered relationship may be created when two entities share a single matching attribute, such as a phone number, an address, or a credit card number.\n\nthe application 150 processes inbound identity records to resolve the inbound identity records to one or more of the entities 152 . At least in some embodiments, it may be too costly in terms of time and/or processing to compare an inbound identity record to all known entities. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the application 150 may evaluate the inbound identity record against only a subset of the known entities, referred to as candidate entities or simply âcandidates.â The candidates may be selected based on one or more candidate-building attributes. For example, if the candidate-building attribute is a phone number, then entities with an identity record having the same phone number as the inbound identity record are selected as candidate entities. Evaluating the inbound identity record against only the candidates may improve performance of the application 150 , at least in some cases.\n\nthe application 150 may determine whether to resolve the inbound identity record to one of the candidates. This determination may be made by further evaluating the candidates based on other attributes (i.e., attributes other than the candidate-building attributes). For example, if the inbound identity record contains the same phone number, address, name and date of birth as a candidate entity, then the inbound identity record and the candidate likely represent the same individual. Accordingly, the application 150 may resolve the inbound identity record and the candidate entity into a single entity. Alternatively, if no candidate entity has corroborating attributes, then the inbound identity record is presumed to refer to a new entity (such as to an individual not yet âknownâ to the entity resolution system). In such a case, the application 150 may create a new entity based on the inbound identity record.\n\nattributes i.e., attributes other than the candidate-building attributes. For example, if the inbound identity record contains the same phone number, address, name and date of birth as a candidate entity, then the inbound identity record and the candidate likely represent the same individual. Accordingly,\n\nthe application 150 determines a âlikeness scoreâ between the inbound identity record and each candidate entity.\n\nthe likeness score for a given candidate entity characterizes an extent to which attributes in the given candidate entity match attributes in the inbound identity record.\n\nthe application 150 may then select the candidate entity having the highest likeness score. If the likeness score of the selected candidate (having the highest likeness score) exceeds a threshold defined by an entity resolution rule for resolving two entities into a single entity, then the application 150 resolves the inbound identity record to the selected candidate. Otherwise, the application 150 stores the inbound identity record as a new entity.\n\nthe inbound identity record and multiple candidate entities may be resolved into a single entity.\n\nthe application 150 may also create a discovered relationship between the new entity and the candidate entity.\n\nthe lower threshold may be defined by an entity resolution rule for creating a relationship between two entities (rather than resolving the two entities into a single entity).\n\nthe application 150 may also determine a relationship strength for the discovered relationship, based on the likeness score of the selected candidate.\n\nthe likeness score between the inbound identity record and a given candidate entity may be determined based one or more predefined scoring rules.\n\nthe scoring rules may assign relative weights to each matching or non-matching attribute, and each weight may be positive or negative.\n\nthe scoring rules may also assign a commonality factor to a matching attribute.\n\nthe commonality factor characterizes a frequency with which a portion or all of a matching attribute occurs in the entity resolution system. For example, suppose that there is a partial match between the name âJames Smith Robinsonâ of an inbound identity record and the name âJames Smithâ of a candidate entity.\n\nthe application 150 may reduce (or eliminate) the extent to which the partial match contributes to the likeness score. Additionally or alternatively, if the application 150 determines that a matching name is rarely encountered in the entities stored in the entity resolution system, then the application 150 may increase the extent to which the matching name contributes to the likeness score.\n\nthe extent to which an attribute value occurs in the entity resolution system may be maintained in the form of frequency statistics and made available to the application 150 . In other embodiments, the frequency statistics may be determined based on data sources other than the entity resolution system, such as an external database of names.\n\nthe likeness score is computed via two phases: an initial phase in which a base likeness score is computed and an adjustment phase in which one or more adjustments are made to the base likeness score to produce the (final) likeness score.\n\na matching name and address may yield a score of one hundred, which may be the minimum score for resolving the inbound identity record.\n\nthe application 150 may lower the likeness score by an associated amount (e.g., by twenty), thus preventing the identity record from being resolved.\n\nthe inbound identity record and the candidate entity may represent two different individuals who resided at the address at different points in time.\n\nthe predefined scoring rules may specify whether each matching or non-matching attribute is considered in the initial phase or the adjustment phase.\n\nthe likeness score is computed in a single phase, taking into account all weights and matching and/or non-matching attributes specified by the predefined scoring rules.\n\nthe predefined scoring rules may also specify threshold scores for considering adjustments. For example, a maximum threshold score of two hundred may be specified, because negative adjustments are unlikely to (and positive adjustments will not) influence the outcome of resolving an inbound identity record to a candidate entity, where the candidate entity has a likeness score of two hundred or greater.\n\na threshold score may also be specific to a given adjustment. For example, a minimum threshold score of ninety-five may be specified for an adjustment that potentially increases the likeness score by five, because a total of one hundred triggers the inbound identity record to be resolved. In some cases, a threshold score lower than ninety-five may be desirable, because other adjustments may help increase the score sufficiently to trigger the inbound identity record to be resolved.\n\nthe application 150 may avoid incurring processing time and/or costs associated with unnecessarily comparing attributes and/or computing adjustments at least in some cases. At least in some embodiments, the application 150 retrieves metadata indicating which adjustments are known to be processing-intensive. Based on the metadata, the application 150 may selectively avoid performing the processing-intensive adjustments. Accordingly, using the techniques disclosed herein, the tradeoff between efficient processing and accurate scoring may be configured by a user to suit the needs of a particular case.\n\nthe application 150 adjusts the likeness score based on one or more entities commonly related to: (i) a first entity representing the identity record and (ii) a candidate entity.\n\nthe likeness score may be adjusted based on a count of the one or more entities, a relationship strength of the one or more entities to the first entity (and/or to the candidate entity), and/or a number degrees of separation of the one or more entities from the first entity (and/or from the candidate entity).\n\nthe candidate entity may be selected based on having the highest likeness score, relative to other candidate entities.\n\nthe one or more entities may be identified based on relationships associated with the first entity and/or the candidate entity.\n\nthe relationships may be represented in a form of a relationship graph associated with the first entity and/or the candidate entity.\n\na relationship graph refers to any graph representing entities as vertices and representing associations between entities as edges.\n\nthe one or more entities may be identified by traversing the relationship graph.\n\nthe relationship graph may either be generated in advance or dynamically generated during or immediately prior to traversal.\n\na first entity and a second entity are said to have a commonly related third entity if there is a path from the first entity to the second entity through the third entity, where the path satisfies predefined path criteria.\n\nthe path criteria may specify a maximum number of degrees of separation between any two of the three entities. More simply, C is said to be âcommonly relatedâ to A and B, if C is related to both A and B within the maximum number of degrees of separation. Additionally, the path criteria may specify a minimum relationship strength of any segment of the path. The path criteria may specify that no entity should appear twice in the path. Doing so prevents relationships of a related entity from being incorrectly classified as related entities in cases where the maximum number of degrees of separation is greater than one.\n\nentity C is commonly related to entities A and B. More specifically, suppose entity C has one-degree relationships to entities A and B, respectively. Suppose entity C also has a one-degree relationship to entity D. Instead of designating entity D as also being commonly related to the entities A and B by virtue of the path â A, C, D, C, B â , the path is disqualified because C occurs twice in the path. In other words, just because C is commonly related to A and B does not also automatically make other one-degree relationships of C (such as entity D) to be commonly related to A and B. However, entity D may nevertheless be designated as being commonly related to the entities A and B via another path, such as through entities E and F (e.g., via a path â A, E, D, F, B â ).\n\nthe application 150 may determine whether the candidate entity satisfies the entity resolution rule. If so, the application 150 resolves the first entity and the candidate entity into a single entity.\n\nrelationships between the first entity and the candidate entity are disregarded (including disclosed relationships and discovered relationships). Doing so prevents the application 150 from incorrectly identifying entities as being commonly related to the first entity and the candidate entity. For example, suppose that entity A is related to entity B and that entity B is related to entity C. Suppose further that entity A and entity C are only related via entity B. Disregarding the relationship between entity A and entity B prevents entity C from being incorrectly identified as an entity that is commonly related to entity A and entity B.\n\nFIG. 1B is a visual depiction 160 of a technique for resolving entities based on commonly related entities, according to one embodiment of the invention.\n\nthe application 150 determines a likeness score 178 between a first entity 152 1 and a second entity 152 2 , based on attributes 154 1 , 154 2 contained in the first and second entities 152 1 , 152 2 , respectively.\n\nthe likeness score 178 does not satisfy a threshold likeness 180 for consolidating (or merging) the first entity and the second entity into a single entity. In other words, the likeness score is insufficient for the application 150 to conclude that the first entity and the second entity represent to the same physical entity.\n\nthe application 150 determines a set of entities 172 related to the first entity 152 1 and a set of entities 174 related to the second entity 152 2 .\n\nthe application 150 determines the intersect 176 between the two sets 172 , 174 .\n\nthe intersect includes only those entities commonly related to both the first entity 152 1 and the second entity 152 2 .\n\nthe application 150 then adjusts the likeness score 178 based on the intersect. If the adjusted likeness score exceeds the threshold likeness 180 , then the application 150 consolidates the first entity and the second entity into a single entity.\n\nFIG. 2 illustrates an example of entities for which the application 150 may adjust a likeness score based on discovered relationships, according to one embodiment of the invention.\n\nthe example is presented in a context of two roommates, James Smith and John Robinson.\n\nthe examples presented herein are merely illustrative and are not intended to be limiting of embodiments of the invention.\n\nthe entities include entity A 152 1 , entity B 152 2 , and entity C 152 3 .\n\nentity A contains the inbound identity record\n\nentity B is the candidate entity\n\nentity C is an entity that is related to at least one of entity A and entity B.\n\nthe entities include the following attributes: an identity record indicator 202 , a name 204 and a date of birth 206 .\n\nentities A and C include an attribute representing phone number 208\n\nentities B and C include an attribute representing address 210 .\n\nentities A and B have matching names 204 and dates of birth 206 . At least in some circumstances, matching names and dates of birth may be sufficient to trigger resolving entities A and B into a single entity.\n\nthe application 150 infers (or has previously inferred) that entities A and B are commonly related to entity C. More specifically, application 150 infers (or has previously inferred): (i) a relationship 212 between entities A and C based on a matching phone number and (ii) a relationship 214 between entities B and C based on a matching address. As described above, these relationships are referred to as discovered relationships.\n\nthe application 150 increases the likeness score between entities A and B, based on the commonly-related entity C.\n\nthe likeness score is increased because it may generally be unlikely that John (entity C) has had, as roommates, two distinct individuals having the same name and date of birth, however common the name may be. If the increased likeness score satisfies the threshold defined by the entity resolution rule, then the application 150 resolves entities A and B into a single entity. Accordingly, the presence of the commonly-related entity C may, in effect, trigger entity A and B to be resolved at least in some cases, such as where the likeness score falls narrowly short of the threshold defined by the entity resolution rule.\n\nthe application 150 may be costlier (in terms of processing time and/or computational resources) to determine whether two entities have a commonly related entityâas compared to determining whether two entities have a particular matching attribute.\n\nthe application 150 is configured to identify commonly-related entities only if the likeness score falls short of the threshold by a prescribed extent, e.g., within ten points of the threshold of one hundred points. Doing so may prevent the application 150 from unnecessarily identifying commonly-related entities in at least some cases, such as where any increase in the likeness score would still be insufficient to trigger entity resolution.\n\nthe prescribed extent may be user-specified and/or tailored to suit the needs of a particular case. Accordingly, the user also may manage a tradeoff between efficient processing and accurate scoring in this context.\n\nFIG. 3 illustrates another example of entities for which the application 150 may adjust a likeness score based on discovered relationships, according to one embodiment of the invention.\n\nthe example is presented in a context of an individual, James Smith, who has been repeatedly reported to a law enforcement agency by a restaurant owner, Roger Ramirez, for loitering.\n\nthe entities include entity A 154 1 , entity B 154 2 , and entity C 154 3 .\n\nentity A contains the inbound identity record\n\nentity B is the candidate entity\n\nentity C is an entity that is related to at least one of entity A and entity B.\n\nthe entities include the following attributes: an identity record indicator 302 , a name 304 and one or more complaint identifiers 308 .\n\neach complaint identifier uniquely identifies a complaint filed by a law enforcement agency, where each complaint names an offender and a person filing a complaint with law enforcement.\n\nentities A and B include an attribute representing date of birth 308\n\nentity C includes attributes representing address 310 and phone number 312 , respectively.\n\nentity A includes an identity record A 1\n\nentity B includes an identity record B 2\n\nentity C includes two identity records, C 1 and C 2 .\n\nEach identity record is associated with a respective complaint identifier.\n\nthe application 150 infers that entities A and B are commonly related to entity C. More specifically, application 150 infers: (i) a relationship 314 between the identity records A 1 and C 1 based on a first matching complaint identifier and (ii) a relationship 316 between the identity records B 1 and C 2 based on a second matching complaint identifier. In one embodiment, the application 150 increases the likeness score between entities A and B, based on the commonly-related entity C.\n\nthe likeness score is increased because it may generally be unlikely that the person filing the complaint (entity C) has reported, for the same offense, two distinct individuals having the same name and date of birth, however common the name may be. In other words, it may generally be more likely that the person filing complaint has twice reported a repeat offender. If the increased likeness score satisfies the threshold defined by the entity resolution rule, then the application 150 resolves entities A and B into a single entity.\n\nFIG. 4 illustrates an example of entities for which the application 150 may adjust a likeness score based on disclosed relationships, according to one embodiment of the invention.\n\nthe example is presented in a context of an individual, Joy Sado, who is listed as a reference in an employment application of another individual, Roger Ramirez. Further, Joy is also listed as a beneficiary of an employee life insurance plan of Roger.\n\nentity A contains an inbound identity record representing Joy\n\nentity B is a candidate entity also representing Joy\n\nentity C is an entity that is related to at least one of entity A and entity B.\n\nthe entities include the following attributes: an identity record indicator 402 , a name 404 and a phone number 406 .\n\nentities B and C include attributes representing date of birth 408 and address 410 , respectively.\n\nentity A includes an identity record A 1\n\nentity B includes an identity record B 2\n\nentity C includes two identity records, C 1 and C 2 .\n\nC 1 represents the employment application of Roger and that C 2 represents the employee life insurance plan of Roger.\n\nthe phone number of entity B does not exactly match the phone number of entity A.\n\nan error in data entry and/or processing may have resulted in the phone number of entity B differing from the phone number of entity A by a single digit.\n\nthe phone numbers differing by a single digit may result in the entities A and B narrowly falling short of satisfying the threshold defined by the entity resolution rule.\n\nthe application 150 identifies that entities A and B are commonly related to entity C. The identification is made based on: (i) a disclosed relationship 412 between the identity records C 1 and A 1 based on the employment reference and (ii) a disclosed relationship 414 between the identity records C 2 and B 1 based on the beneficiary listing. In one embodiment, the application 150 then increases the likeness score between entities A and B, based on the commonly-related entity C. The likeness score is increased because it may generally be unlikely that Roger is so closely related to two distinct individuals having the same name and a similar phone number, as to list one as an employment reference and another as a beneficiary. If the increased likeness score satisfies the threshold defined by the entity resolution rule, then the application 150 resolves entities A and B into a single entity.\n\nunder-resolving refers to incorrectly refraining from resolving two entities into a single entity when the two entities in fact refer to the same individual (and should be resolved).\n\nthe techniques disclosed herein may also be further refined to avoid over-resolving entities as a result of using relationships.\n\nover-resolving refers to incorrectly resolving two entities into a single entity when the two entities in fact refer to distinct individuals (and should not be resolved).\n\nthe matching attributes in entity C may not necessarily be sufficient to have resulted in entity C being resolved to entity A or B, the matching attributes in entity C may nevertheless be sufficient for the application 150 to infer a relationship between entity C and each of entity A and B.\n\nthe application 150 disregards the inferred relationships between entity C and each of entity A and B, preventing entity C from increasing at all the likeness score between entity A and entity B. This is because entity C contains no new information (i.e., attributes) associating entity A with entity B. Instead, the only attributes in entity C that associate entity A with entity B are already contained in entities A and B. Accordingly, the refined technique may prevent over-resolving entities as a result of using relationships between entities at least in some cases. For example, the refined technique prevents entity C from incorrectly triggering entity A and entity B to be resolved into a single entity.\n\nFIG. 5 illustrates an example of entities that the application 150 may refrain from resolving as a result of relationships to a common entity, according to one embodiment of the invention.\n\nthe entities A, B and C each include a respective identity record indicator 502 .\n\nthe entities A, B and C include the following matching attributes: a name 502 , and a date of birth 506 .\n\nthe matching name is âJames Smith,â which commonly occurs in the entity resolution system. Accordingly, the entities A and B may have a likeness score insufficient to trigger resolving the entities A and B into a single entity.\n\nthe application 150 may infer a relationship between each of entities A and B to entity C, based on the matching attributes of name 502 and date of birth 506 . More specifically, based on the matching attributes, the application 150 may infer relationships 508 , 510 , 512 between: entities A and C, entities B and C and entities A and B, respectively.\n\nentity C does not associate entities A and B using any new attributes, relative to the attributes entities A and B already contain. Accordingly, the application 150 disregards the inferred relationships, preventing the likeness score between entities A and B from being increased based on the inferred relationships. Accordingly, the application 150 prevents entity C from causing entities A and B to become over-resolved.\n\nalternative approaches of refining the technique to avoid over-resolving entities at least in some cases include designating each relationship as either a âlikeness relationshipâ or a âconnection relationship.â\n\na likeness relationship refers to a relationship between entities that indicates that the entities are likely to represent the same individual. For example, a likeness relationship may be created between two entities, where the entities have a likeness score that does not satisfy a higher threshold for resolving the entities into a single entity but satisfies a lower threshold for the likeness relationship to be created between the two entities.\n\na connection relationship refers to a relationship between entities that indicates that the entities are likely to represent distinct but related individuals.\n\na connection relationship may be created between two entities based on a disclosed relationship, such as beneficiaries on an insurance policy, emergency contacts on employment files, references on an employment application, etc. It may generally be unlikely for an individual to list himself or herself in at least some types of disclosed relationships.\n\nthe technique may then be refined by disregarding all likeness relationships, thereby preventing any likeness relationship from increasing the likeness score.\n\nthe technique may be refined by considering only connection relationships, thereby allowing only connection relationships to increase the likeness score.\n\nthe technique may be refined to avoid over-resolving entities in other cases.\n\nthe technique may be refined to prevent overly related entities from causing two entities to be over-resolved.\n\noverly related entities refer entities with an undesirably large number of first-degree relationships.\n\nthe application 150 may determine to designate an entity as an overly related entity, if the entity has a number of first-degree relationships exceeding a predefined threshold. Overly related entities may generally be more likely to cause over-resolution than entities with a smaller number of first-degree relationships.\n\nFIG. 6 illustrates an example of entities that the application 150 may refrain from resolving as a result of an entity with an undesirably large number of relationships, according to one embodiment of the invention.\n\nthe example is presented in a context of rental car customers who have received traffic citations in Nevada. Assume that the rental car customers are clients of Acme Rental Car, a rental car company which has a large number of vehicles registered with the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). Each registration at the DMV results in a newly generated identity record, each with a respective, distinct license plate.\n\nthe entities A and B each represent a customer named James Smith, while entity C represents Acme Rental Car.\n\nthe entities A, B and C each include an identity record indicator 602 and a name 604 .\n\nEntity C contains all of the newly generated identity records (and the respective, distinct license plates).\n\nthe application 150 may have resolved all of the newly generated identity records into a single entity, entity C, based on matching attributes such as name, phone number and address.\n\nentity A represents an individual, James Smith, who received a citation when driving a rental car in the year 2002, the driver holding a California driver's license at the time of the citation.\n\nentity B represents an individual with the same name of James Smith, who received a citation when driving a different rental car in the year 2008, the driver holding a Texas driver's license at the time of the citation.\n\nentities A and B have matching dates of birth. As described above, matching names and dates of birth may typically be sufficient to trigger resolving entities A and B into a single entity. However, because the name âJames Smithâ occurs commonly in the entity resolution system, entities A and B may have a likeness score that falls just short of the threshold for resolving entities A and B into a single entity.\n\nthe technique is refined to disregard any overly related entities, preventing any relationships to the overly related entities from incorrectly causing two entities to be resolved into a single entity.\n\nthe application 150 may determine to designate an entity as an overly related entity, if the entity has a number of relationships exceeding a predefined threshold.\n\nthe predefined threshold may be user-specified and/or may be determined based on a specified percentile of entities in the entity resolution system, according to relationship count. For example, in one embodiment, entities in the top twenty percentile based on relationship count may be disregarded by the application 150 .\n\nthe refined technique may be used to prevent Acme Rental Car (entity C) from incorrectly causing entity A and B to be resolved into a single entity.\n\nFIG. 7 is a flowchart depicting a method 700 for resolving entities based on relationships to a common entity, according to one embodiment of the invention.\n\nthe method 700 begins at step 710 , where the application 150 compares a first entity and a second entity to determine that the first entity and the second entity nearly satisfy an entity resolution rule.\n\nthe first entity may contain an inbound identity record, and the second entity may be a candidate entity.\n\nthe entity resolution rule specifies criteria for resolving the first entity and the second entity into a single entity. Nearly satisfying the entity resolution rule includes having a likeness score falling short, by no more than a prescribed extent, of a threshold defined by the entity resolution rule.\n\nthe application 150 determines a set of one or more entities commonly related to the first entity and the second entity, where the set of one or more entities include at least a third entity.\n\nthe one or more entities may be determined by traversing a relationship graph containing disclosed and/or discovered relationships. The step 720 is further described below in conjunction with FIG. 8 .\n\nthe application 150 determines that the first entity and the second entity satisfy the entity resolution rule, based on the set of one or more entities. For example, the likeness score between the first and second entities may be increased based on the one or more entities, the increased likeness score satisfying the threshold defined by the entity resolution rule.\n\nthe application 150 then resolves the first and second entities into a single entity. After the step 740 , the method 700 terminates.\n\nFIG. 8 is a flowchart depicting a method 800 for determining a set of one or more entities commonly related to the first and second entities of FIG. 7 , according to one embodiment of the invention.\n\nthe method 800 corresponds to step 720 of FIG. 7 .\n\nembodiments are described herein with reference to the underlying representation of the set being in the form of relationships, other embodiments are broadly contemplated.\n\nthe underlying representation of the set may be in the form of entities, rather than relationships.\n\nentity C is commonly related to entities A and B may be represented in the form of entities (i.e., as a set containing the entity C) rather than in the form of relationships (i.e., a set containing a first relationship between A and C and a second relationship between B and C).\n\nentity C may be interchangeably referred to as an entity related to/a relationship of entity A and/or entity B.\n\nthe method 800 begins at step 810 , where the application 150 identifies all one-degree discovered relationships of each of the first and second entities, except any relationship between the first and second entities.\n\nthe application 150 may add the identified relationships to the set.\n\nthe application 150 may remove, from the set, discovered relationships formed solely from attributes for which a match already exists between the first and second entities. For example, the application 150 may remove, from the set, the relationships 508 , 510 , 512 (and/or the entity C 154 3 ) of FIG. 5 .\n\nthe application 150 adds to the set, disclosed relationships for each of the first and second entities, except any relationship between the first and second entities.\n\nthe application 150 optionally removes, from the set, any relationship not satisfying a minimum relationship strength, so that only relationships exceeding a desired strength are considered in determining commonly related entities.\n\nthe application 150 removes any relationship to any third entity that is not common to the first and second entities, resulting in a set of commonly related entities.\n\nthe application 150 optionally traverses, in the set, one or more additional degrees of relationships, adding to the set any entities found to be commonly related to the first and second entities.\n\nthe application 150 optionally removes, from the set, any relationships to entities identified as overly related entities. For example, the application 150 may remove, from the set, the relationships 618 and 620 (and/or the entity C 154 3 ) of FIG. 6 .\n\nthe method 800 terminates.\n\nFIG. 9 is a block diagram depicting components 900 of the application 150 of FIG. 1A , according to one embodiment of the invention.\n\nthe components 900 include an entity resolution component 910 , a relationship generator 920 , a relationship traverser 930 and a scoring component 940 .\n\nthe scoring component 940 includes a base score module 950 and an adjustment module 960 .\n\nthe entity resolution component 910 is configured to resolve multiple entities into a single entity or split a single entity into multiple entities. To this end, the entity resolution component 910 applies one or more entity resolution rules. Accordingly, the entity resolution component 910 may perform the step 740 of FIG. 7 .\n\nthe relationship generator 920 is configured to create and store inferred relationships between entities, based on attributes contained in the entities and predefined relationship criteria. For example, the relationship generator 920 may perform part or all of step 810 of FIG. 8 .\n\nthe relationship traverser 930 is configured to explore a relationship graph to identify commonly related entities. To this end, the relationship traverser 930 may apply predefined traversal criteria. Examples of traversal criteria include relationship strength, degrees of separation, count of relationships, etc. Accordingly, the relationship traverser 930 may perform steps 820 through 870 of FIG. 8 .\n\nthe scoring component 940 is configured to compute a likeness score representing, at least in part, a degree to which attributes of a first entity match attributes of a second entity. To this end, the scoring component 940 applies one or more predefined scoring rules. Accordingly, the scoring component 940 may perform part or all of the steps 710 and/or 730 of FIG. 7 . In embodiments where the likeness score is computed via two phases, the base score module 950 performs part or all of the step 710 , and the adjustment module 960 performs part or all of the step 730 .\n\nembodiments of the invention provide techniques for performing resolving entities based on relationships to a common entity.\n\nOne embodiment provides an application for entity resolution.\n\nthe application compares two entities to determine that an entity resolution threshold is nearly satisfied, where the entity resolution threshold refers to a threshold for resolving two entities into a single entity.\n\nthe application determines one or more entities commonly related to the two entities.\n\nthe application determines that the two entities satisfy the entity resolution threshold on the basis of the one or more commonly-related entities.\n\nthe application resolves the two entities into a single entity.\n\nthe application may resolve entities more accurately at least in some cases, relative to alternative approaches. More specifically, entity under-resolution may be reduced, while minimizing any increase in entity over-resolution as a result of using the techniques disclosed herein.\n\nentities may be resolved more accurately especially in cases where the amount and/or quality of captured data is low.\n\nAn example of a low amount of data is where only a name and date of birth is recorded for many individuals.\n\nAn example of a low quality of data is where there are many inconsistencies in the captured data, perhaps resulting from errors in data entry and/or data processing.\n\nthe data may include many identity records, each with what appears to be a different misspelling of the name âJames Smith.â\n\nthe techniques herein may be used to reduce occurrences of the identity records spanning a large number of sparsely-populated entities in the entity resolution system, when the identity records should in fact be resolved into a single entity.\n\nan example of an alternative approach is one that includes selectively enabling resolving entities based on a common name and/or changing the thresholds specified in the entity resolution rule, without considering relationships to common entities in resolving entities.\n\nthe alternative approach may reduce under-resolution to some extent, over-resolution may occur much more frequently as a result.\n\nthe extent to which over-resolution may occur much more frequently may be measured using probabilistic techniques associated with the birthday problem in probability theory.\n\nthe birthday problem pertains to the probability that, in a set of randomly chosen persons, some pair of persons will have the same date of birth.\n\nentities in the entity resolution system may often contain only a name and a date of birth.\n\neach distinct date of birth is loaded into the entity resolution system and that a given name is associated with 160 distinct dates of birth.\n\nNew York City which has a population of approximately eight million individuals, approximately half of which are males, there may likely be 1,320 distinct individuals named âJames Smithâ in New York City.\n\nLandscapes\n\nEngineering & Computer Science (AREA)\n\nDatabases & Information Systems (AREA)\n\nTheoretical Computer Science (AREA)\n\nQuality & Reliability (AREA)\n\nData Mining & Analysis (AREA)\n\nPhysics & Mathematics (AREA)\n\nGeneral Engineering & Computer Science (AREA)\n\nGeneral Physics & Mathematics (AREA)\n\nInformation Retrieval, Db Structures And Fs Structures Therefor (AREA)\n\nManagement, Administration, Business Operations System, And Electronic Commerce (AREA)\n\nUS13/217,027 2011-08-24 2011-08-24 Entity resolution based on relationships to a common entity Active 2032-01-16 US8965848B2 (en)\n\nPriority Applications (5)\n\nApplication Number Priority Date Filing Date Title US13/217,027 US8965848B2 (en) 2011-08-24 2011-08-24 Entity resolution based on relationships to a common entity PCT/IB2012/053144 WO2013027129A1 (en) 2011-08-24 2012-06-21 Entity resolution based on relationships to common entity CN201280040422.0A CN103748582B (zh) 2011-08-24 2012-06-21 åºäºä¸å ±åå®ä½çå ³ç³»çå®ä½è§£æ EP12826354.8A EP2748731A4 (de) 2011-08-24 2012-06-21 EntitÃ¤tsauflÃ¶sung auf basis von beziehungen zu einer gemeinsamen entitÃ¤t JP2014526566A JP5946533B2 (ja) 2011-08-24 2012-06-21 å ±éã¨ã³ãã£ãã£ã¨ã®é¢ä¿ã«åºã¥ãã¨ã³ãã£ãã£ã»ã¬ã¾ãªã¥ã¼ã·ã§ã³ã®ããã®æ¹æ³ãã³ã³ãã¥ã¼ã¿ã»ãã­ã°ã©ã ãããã³ã·ã¹ãã\n\nApplications Claiming Priority (1)\n\nApplication Number Priority Date Filing Date Title US13/217,027 US8965848B2 (en) 2011-08-24 2011-08-24 Entity resolution based on relationships to a common entity\n\nPublications (2)\n\nPublication Number Publication Date US20130054598A1 US20130054598A1 (en) 2013-02-28 US8965848B2 true US8965848B2 (en) 2015-02-24\n\nFamily\n\nID=47745141\n\nFamily Applications (1)\n\nApplication Number Title Priority Date Filing Date US13/217,027 Active 2032-01-16 US8965848B2 (en) 2011-08-24 2011-08-24 Entity resolution based on relationships to a common entity\n\nCountry Status (5)\n\nCountry Link US (1) US8965848B2 (de) EP (1) EP2748731A4 (de) JP (1) JP5946533B2 (de) CN (1) CN103748582B (de) WO (1) WO2013027129A1 (de)\n\nCited By (11)\n\n* Cited by examiner, â Cited by third party Publication number Priority date Publication date Assignee Title US20160012149A1 (en) * 2014-07-09 2016-01-14 International Business Machines Corporation Using vertex self-information scores for vertices in an entity graph to determine whether to perform entity resolution on the vertices in the entity graph US20160301706A1 (en) * 2015-04-07 2016-10-13 Passport Health Communications, Inc.
