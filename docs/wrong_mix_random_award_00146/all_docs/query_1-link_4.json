        "text": "In 1983, Tim Berry left his vice president job at a Silicon Valley high-tech planning and research firm to do business plans for startups and major tech manufacturers. He developed the initial business plan and was one of the founding directors of Borland International, which started in 1983 and went public in 1986. He was a planning consultant for Apple Computer for 12 years, including for Apple Japan while it grew from $180 million to $1.5 billion annually in four years. Over his career, he billed more than $2 million for business plan consulting.\n\nHe came to believe that every business, small or large, deserves good business planning to optimize management and accountability. So in 1988, he incorporated as Palo Alto Software, and set out to create business planning tools that were accessible and affordable for small businesses everywhere. Palo Alto Software grew from Tim's desire to help others succeed in business, and that is the goal our company continues to pursue."
