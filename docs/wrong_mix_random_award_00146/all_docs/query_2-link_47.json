        "text": "Tutorial: Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) integration with Palo Alto Networks - GlobalProtect\n\nIn this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Palo Alto Networks - GlobalProtect with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Palo Alto Networks - GlobalProtect with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:\n\nControl in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Palo Alto Networks - GlobalProtect.\n\nEnable your users to be automatically signed-in to Palo Alto Networks - GlobalProtect with their Microsoft Entra accounts.\n\nManage your accounts in one central location.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nTo integrate Microsoft Entra ID with Bugcrowd, you need:\n\nA Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a free account.\n\nPalo Alto Networks - GlobalProtect single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.\n\nScenario description\n\nIn this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.\n\nPalo Alto Networks - GlobalProtect supports SP initiated SSO\n\nPalo Alto Networks - GlobalProtect supports Just In Time user provisioning\n\nAdding Palo Alto Networks - GlobalProtect from the gallery\n\nTo configure the integration of Palo Alto Networks - GlobalProtect into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Palo Alto Networks - GlobalProtect from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.\n\nSign in to the Microsoft Entra admin center as at least a Cloud Application Administrator.\n\nBrowse to Identity > Applications > Enterprise applications > New application.\n\nIn the Add from the gallery section, type Palo Alto Networks - GlobalProtect in the search box.\n\nSelect Palo Alto Networks - GlobalProtect from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.\n\nAlternatively, you can also use the Enterprise App Configuration Wizard. In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well. Learn more about Microsoft 365 wizards.\n\nConfigure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Palo Alto Networks - GlobalProtect\n\nConfigure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Palo Alto Networks - GlobalProtect using a test user called B.Simon. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Palo Alto Networks - GlobalProtect.\n\nTo configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Palo Alto Networks - GlobalProtect, perform the following steps:\n\nConfigure Microsoft Entra SSO - to enable your users to use this feature.\n\nCreate a Microsoft Entra test user - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.\n\nAssign the Microsoft Entra test user - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.\n\nConfigure Palo Alto Networks - GlobalProtect SSO - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.\n\nCreate Palo Alto Networks - GlobalProtect test user - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Palo Alto Networks - GlobalProtect that is linked to the Microsoft Entra ID representation of user.\n\nTest SSO - to verify whether the configuration works.\n\nConfigure Microsoft Entra SSO\n\nFollow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.\n\nSign in to the Microsoft Entra admin center as at least a Cloud Application Administrator.\n\nBrowse to Identity > Applications > Enterprise applications > Palo Alto Networks - GlobalProtect > Single sign-on.\n\nOn the Select a single sign-on method page, select SAML.\n\nOn the Set up single sign-on with SAML page, click the pencil icon for Basic SAML Configuration to edit the settings.\n\nOn the Basic SAML Configuration section, perform the following steps:\n\na.

Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign on URL. Contact Palo Alto Networks - GlobalProtect Client support team to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the Basic SAML Configuration section in the Microsoft Entra admin center.\n\nOn the Set up single sign-on with SAML page, in the SAML Signing Certificate section, find Federation Metadata XML and select Download to download the XML file (which also contains the SAML certificate) and save it on your computer.\n\nOn the Set up Palo Alto Networks - GlobalProtect section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.\n\nCreate a Microsoft Entra test user\n\nIn this section, you'll create a test user in the Microsoft Entra admin center called B.Simon.\n\nSign in to the Microsoft Entra admin center as at least a User Administrator.\n\nBrowse to Identity > Users > All users.\n\nSelect New user > Create new user, at the top of the screen.\n\nIn the User properties, follow these steps:\n\nIn the Display name field, enter B.Simon.\n\nIn the User principal name field, enter the username@companydomain.extension.

Palo Alto Networks - GlobalProtect supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Palo Alto Networks - GlobalProtect, a new one is created after authentication.\n\nTest SSO\n\nIn this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.\n\nClick on Test this application, this will redirect to Palo Alto Networks - GlobalProtect Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow.\n\nGo to Palo Alto Networks - GlobalProtect Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.\n\nYou can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Palo Alto Networks - GlobalProtect tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the Palo Alto Networks - GlobalProtect for which you set up the SSO.
