        "text": "You’ll need a social security number, or a W-8BEN with supporting documents, and a valid form of identification. U.S. citizens can use a state-issued photo ID like a driver’s license, passport or state or military ID. Identification for non-U.S. citizens includes a foreign passport, visa or an I-9. A minimum opening deposit of $25 is needed to activate your account (once you’ve been approved). This can be paid with a prepaid, debit or credit card, a transfer from another U.S. Bank account or a transfer from another financial institution.\n\nYou must be 14 years or older to open a checking account. Those under the age of 18 must of a co-applicant.\n\nAn appointment with a banker allows you time to ask any questions you have. Some services such as notarizing documents require that you make an appointment. You can also get help with the mobile app, opening a checking or savings account, transferring money and more. When you book an appointment, you’ll select the date and time, the purpose of your visit and if you’d like to meet at the branch, over the phone or virtually.\n\nU.S. Bank virtual appointments use two-way video streaming technology to support your banking and financial needs. Schedule a virtual appointment to enroll in online banking, download and set up the U.S. Bank Mobile App, discuss opening a new credit card, lending and business accounts, and more. Through a virtual appointment, you have the same face-to-face interaction that you would have in your local branch but without leaving your home. Schedule a virtual appointment for help with a wide range of tasks, such as enrolling in online banking, setting up direct deposit, ordering new debit cards and more.\n\nNow, more than ever, you can do so much more than withdraw cash from an ATM. Most U.S. Bank ATMs let you check your bank account balances, deposit cash and checks, transfer money between accounts, make payments and reset your card PIN. If you just need to withdraw cash, you can even specify if you want large or small bills. Learn more and view video tutorials about U.S. Bank ATMs.\n\nLog into usbank.com. Next, select Customer Service at the top of the dashboard and choose Contact us. From here, you can reach us a couple ways:\n\nCall: Choose the applicable department you'd like to reach from the phone list provided.\n\nEmail: Select Email Us on the right side of the page, in the “More Options” section. Enter the information requested and select Submit.\n\nIf you’re on Google, search for ‘U.S. Bank near me.’ You can also visit the U.S. Bank branch locator at https://www.usbank.com/locations/ and enter address, city or state and ZIP code that is nearest to you. Another option is to click on the map and select the ‘Search this area’ button. Use the filters to narrow down your search. You may also select Locations in the upper right corner of the page at usbank.com to start your search."
