        "text": "For the past 15 years, Palo Alto Networks has confronted one of the world’s most pressing issues: cybersecurity. As our digital way of life has grown to encompass work, home, and everywhere in between, the company has risen to address the world’s greatest security challenges with the latest breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, analytics, automation, and orchestration. In 2019, with the release of a set of category-redefining products right around the corner, the company’s leaders saw an opportunity to reshape and strengthen the brand’s identity. Together, we set out to reimagine the way Palo Alto Networks uses visual language to tell its story.\n\nPANW’s leaders wanted to explore everything from brand marks and illustration to motion graphics and strategy. They also asked us to name the product families we’d be bringing to life. Our goal was to reflect their market expertise by creating a cohesive look that evokes the strength and flexibility of the company’s products.\n\nTo tie all the elements together, we created a suite of custom graphics. Since Palo Alto Networks specializes in securing and handling all sorts of data, we used capsules to illustrate the abstraction of data and data clusters. Each data point is visualized as traveling along a secure pathway—which is exactly Palo Alto Networks’ core mission.\n\nPalo Alto Networks’ full refresh was finally unveiled last spring in San Francisco. The new identity continues to roll out across the company site, its branded materials, and its 58 campuses around the world."
