        "text": "Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n\nHenry Etzkowitz has spent decades studying the science of innovation, a field that has taken him on research projects in England, China and Stanford University.\n\nBut the tech-savvy sociologist didn’t become fully engaged in local affairs until 2022, when Stanford University bought Oak Creek Apartments, a 759-unit residential complex on Sand Hill Road, with the intent of turning it into housing for postdocs. As a resident of Oak Creek Apartments, Etzkowitz said he was alarmed by the prospect of the university raising rents, forcing all the seniors out and destroying the community that he had embraced.\n\n“Everyone liked the idea of Oak Creek as an intergenerational living space and that would come to the end because seniors would need to move,” Etzkowitz said in an interview.\n\nThe university ultimately agreed to adopt a more gradual and phased approach toward converting the Oak Creek complex, the ordeal made Etzkowitz appreciate the struggles that renters face in Palo Alto, a place famous for its shortage of affordable housing. And as the newest entrant to the City Council race, he is making renter protections his central platform.\n\nEtzkowitz, 84, said he sees it as a major problem that many local renters spend a third or half of their incomes just to pay their rent.\n\n“The basic principle is that it’s gone out of control,” Etzkowitz said in an interview. “Rents are escalating and housing isn’t keeping up. And the shortage here in Palo Alto is partly because of the university not meeting its responsibility in housing.”\n\nHis long-term solution is similar to those of the other seven candidates in the field: Palo Alto should build more affordable housing. His short-term solution, however, sets him apart. Etzkowitz said he would like to see the city enact rent control to relieve pressure on renters.\n\nThe idea of rent control – or “rent stabilization” – isn’t exactly new in Palo Alto. The city had explored it in 2016 but halted the effort after an outcry from local landlords and divisions among council members. If elected, Etzkowitz would bring it back.\n\n“It might be necessary as an interim measure until supply can keep up with demand,” Etzkowitz said.\n\nA New York native, Etzkowitz helped a photovoltaic company in the 1970s before spending the next five decades in the intersection of sociology and technology. As an academic, Etzkowitz has been focused on researching entrepreneurship and innovation, a field that took him to Newcastle University and Stanford University, which he had been visiting since the 1980s. In 2005, Etzkowitz returned to Stanford to study its technology licensing operations and explore the local startup ecosystem. Four years later, he made Palo Alto his permanent home.\n\nHe currently serves as CEO of the Triple Helix Institute, a think tank that focuses on the intersection of university, industry and government innovation.\n\nEtzkowitz said he began dabbling in local politics in 2022, when he led the opposition to Stanford’s plans for Oak Creek. He also began paying attention to the local council race and supported the campaigns of council members Julie Lythcott-Haims, Vicki Veenker and Greg Tanaka. And while he believes the current council generally does a good job, he strongly disagrees with some of its most recent decisions.\n\nHe opposes, for example, the council’s plan of adding more than 2,000 housing units in and around San Antonio Road by 2031, a central component of Palo Alto’s broader strategy to meet a state housing mandate. He said he would support turning San Antonio into park space and concentrating more housing in districts like downtown and California Avenue, which have more amenities like shopping and transportation.\n\nHe would also like to see more contributions from Stanford University. The expansive parking lots and garages at Stanford Shopping Center would be perfect for multi-family housing developments, he said. In his view, these complexes would include not just housing but also day care centers and community spaces where residents can meet for brunch, games, dances and whatever else their hearts desire. Stanford could help create numerous “vertical Oak Creeks,” he said.\n\n“There are places where there are already services in place and that can take additional developments,” Etzkowitz said.\n\nAt the same time, he said, other parts of the city should be left undeveloped. Eichler neighborhoods, for example, should be preserved and protected. And San Antonio should be converted into an “urban forest” rather than a residential hub.\n\nIn a statement announcing his candidacy, Etzkowitz proposes ideas that one can easily imagine inviting intense debates and legal challenges. One would designate 20% of the housing that the city helps to build for children of Palo Alto residents. Another would ban Stanford University from purchasing housing in Palo Alto. Another would institute a rent cap for seniors based on 25% of the renter’s income and prohibit rent increase after 15 years of residency.\n\nHe also said that he wants to turn empty offices into “living lofts.”\n\nEtzowitz also stands apart from the candidate field in his views on grade separation, the reconstruction of rail crossings to vertically separate the tracks from the roads. Palo Alto is now exploring three grade separation options. At Churchill Avenue, the council adopted as its preferred alternative an underpass for cars. At Meadow Drive and Charleston Road, which are being evaluated in tandem, the council is looking at a car underpass and a “hybrid” design that combines raised tracks and lowered roads.\n\nEtzkowitz opposes all of these options. Rather than pursuing options that may involve property takings, Palo Alto should reconsider a tunnel. The council had previously looked at a tunnel (and more than 35 other options) and rejected it because of prohibitively high costs. Etzkowitz wants to revive that discussion. He wants to see Palo Alto join other area cities and work with the California High-Speed Rail Authority to obtain funding for a regional tunnel project. Alma Street, he said, could become more like New York City’s famed Park Avenue, where a rail line was grade separated in the 1870s.\n\n“Not every problem in Palo Alto can be solved by itself. … Let’s think bigger and work with other cities.” Etzkowitz said.\n\nEtzkowitz becomes the eighth candidate to run for council, which will have four seats up for grabs in November. Mayor Greer Stone and Council member Pat Burt are both seeking fresh terms. Also challenging for seats are four members of the Planning and Transportation Commission — George Lu, Keith Reckdahl, Doria Summa and Cari Templeton and Human Relations Commission member Katie Causey.\n\nCouncil members Lydia Kou and Greg Tanaka are both terming out at the end of this year."
