        "text": "In August 2018, Mitsui rolled up its various existing innovation-promoting initiatives into a completely new format: Moon. Based in Palo Alto, California, and with a branch office in Tokyo, Moon is a creative lab dedicated entirely to the incubation and development of new businesses. Crucially, Moon has a strong relationship with IDEO. Based on this relationship, it can tap into the new business creation know-how IDEO has built up over nearly three decades.\n\nWhat distinguishes Moon from the various in-house initiatives it replaces? First, Moon is not in-house at all. Itâs an affiliated company that is physically separate from Mitsui offices and has a wholly different look, feel and ethos as a result. This separateness guarantees Moonâs independence; enables Moon to seek out challenging projects which lie beyond Mitsuiâs investment criteria; and enables Moon to implement and discard different business models at a rapid pace. Second, Mitsui employees whose ideas get picked up by Moon can devote themselves full time to turning them into businesses rather than fitting their entrepreneurial efforts around their âmain job.â\n\nOne lesson that Mitsui learned from its previous venture-related initiatives is that the process of going from âzero to oneâ and turning a clever idea into a functional business is always fraught with challenges. However original your âgreat idea,â basic synchronicity usually means that thereâs someone else out there with a similar idea at the same time. Turning the idea into a workable prototype is never easy. And most importantly, refining the product or service into a form that customers welcome and likeâsomething that PillPack and IDEO did so well togetherâis as difficult as it is crucial. Moon provides its entrepreneurs with all the support they need to achieve this, from âidea incubation partnersâ (mentors with whom they can talk things over as they digest and respond to customer feedback) to project members equipped with the very specific skillsets that early-stage businesses most need."
