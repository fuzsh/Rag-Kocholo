        "text": "The Palo Alto Panorama management server provides centralized monitoring and management of multiple next-generation firewalls and appliance clusters.\n\nTypes of Assets Fetched\n\nThis adapter fetches the following types of assets:\n\nDevices\n\nUsers\n\nNetworks\n\nFirewall Rules\n\nAbout Palo Alto Networks Panorama\n\nUse cases the adapter solves\n\nConnecting Panorama to Axonius will allow you to quickly identify which assets are accessing the network over VPN. Specifically, Axonius can identify which private IP address is being used on the organization's internal network and identify which public IP address was used to access the VPN.\n\nData retrieved by Panorama\n\nNetwork interface data about how the client connected to the VPN.\n\nAdditional note\n\nBecause it leverages the PanOS API, the Palo Alto Panorama adapter can be used to connect directly to Palo Alto firewalls if a Panorama endpoint is not available.\n\nParameters\n\nPanorama Domain (required) - The hostname or IP address of the Palo Alto Panorama server or PA Firewall server.\n\nUser Name and Password (optional) - The credentials for a user account that has the Required Permissions to fetch assets.\n\nAPI Key (optional) - An API Key associated with a user account that has the Required Permissions to fetch assets.\n\nNote:\n\nIf User Name and Password are supplied, this field will be ignored.\n\nVerify SSL - Select whether to verify the SSL certificate offered by the value supplied in Panorama Domain. For more details, see SSL Trust & CA Settings.\n\nTo learn more about common adapter connection parameters and buttons, see Adding a New Adapter Connection.\n\nAdvanced Settings\n\nNote:\n\nAdvanced settings can either apply for all connections for this adapter, or you can set different advanced settings and/or different scheduling for a specific connection, refer to ​Advanced Configuration for Adapters\n\nFetch ARP data (required, default: True) - Select whether to fetch ARP data from the Palo Alto Panorama server.\n\nIf enabled, all connections for this adapter will fetch ARP data from Palo Alto Panorama.\n\nIf disabled, all connections for this adapter will not fetch ARP data from Palo Alto Panorama.\n\nForce logout of the user - Select this option to force logout of the account used to query the Palo alto Panorama data.\n\nFetch Firewall Policies - Select this option to fetch firewall security and NAT policies.\n\nFetch Network Entities (Addresses, Ethernet Interfaces) - Select this option to fetch Addresses as an asset and to fetch Ethernet interfaces as a new device type.\n\nSet the firewall last seen to the “connected-at” date if it is within the last X days - Enter the amount of days necessary in order to set the firewall last seen to the “connected-at” date.\n\nExtend NAT Rules as connected devices - Select this option to connect NAT firewall rules (public to private IPs only) with Network assets.\n\nExtend Access Rules as connected devices - Select this option to connect Access firewall rules (from untrust sources) with Network assets.\n\nFetch Users From Login Logs - Select this option to fetch the one-day-old VPN login logs to parse users of type LOGIN LOG.\n\nRequired Permissions\n\nNote:\n\nAs a best practice, ensure that you create a separate, dedicated account for API access to Palo Alto Panorama.\n\nIf you have supplied a User Name - the username must be provided the ’Superuser (read-only)' role.\n\nInstructions for associating this role with an account can be found here.\n\nIf you have supplied an API Key - You can obtain an API key by following the instructions here as an alternative to using a username/password as described above (once the API has been enabled as described here).\n\nThe following API permissions are required for basic Panorama configuration:\n\nXML API (Configuration) - Required for fetching Firewalls, Firewall Rules, ARPs, and VPN Users.\n\nREST API (Panorama) - Required for fetching Device Groups.\n\nREST API (Objects) - Fetch Address Groups.\n\nREST API (Networks) - Fetch Networks associated with Device Groups to correlate with Firewall Rules.\n\nOptional API Permission:\n\nXML API (Log permission) - Fetch users' login logs\n\nAPIs"
