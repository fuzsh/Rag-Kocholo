        "text": "Name\n\nEnter a name to identify the group (up to 31 characters). The name is case-sensitive, must be unique across the entire device group hierarchy, and can contain only letters, numbers, spaces, periods, hyphens, and underscores.\n\nDevices\n\nSelect each firewall that you want to add to the device group. If the list of firewalls is long, you can filter by\n\nDevice State\n\n,\n\nPlatforms\n\n,\n\nTemplates\n\n, or\n\nTags\n\n. The Filters section displays (in parentheses) the number of managed firewalls for each of these categories.\n\nIf the purpose of a device group is purely organizational (that is, to contain other device groups), you donât need to assign firewalls to it.\n\nGroup HA Peers\n\nSelect to group firewalls that are peers in a high availability (HA) configuration. The list then displays the active (or active-primary in an active/active configuration) firewall first and the passive (or active-secondary in an active/active configuration) firewall in parentheses. This enables you to easily identify firewalls that are in HA mode. When pushing shared policies, you can push to the grouped pair instead of individual peers.\n\nFor HA peers in an active/passive configuration, consider adding both firewalls or their virtual systems to the same device group. This enables you to push the configuration to both peers simultaneously.\n\nParent Device Group\n\nRelative to the device group you are defining, select the device group (or the Shared location) that is just above it in the hierarchy (default is\n\nShared\n\n).\n\nMaster Device\n\nTo configure policy rules and reports based on usernames and user groups, you must select a\n\nMaster Device\n\n. This is the firewall from which Panorama receives usernames, user group names, and username-to-group mapping information.\n\nWhen you change the\n\nMaster Device\n\nor set it to\n\nNone\n\n, Panorama loses all the user and group information received from that firewall.\n\nStore users and groups from Master Device\n\nThis option displays only if you select a\n\nMaster Device\n\n. The option enables Panorama to locally store usernames, user group names, and username-to-group mapping information that it receives from the\n\nMaster Device\n\n. To enable local storage, you must also select\n\nPanorama\n\nSetup\n\nManagement\n\n, edit the Panorama Settings, and Enable reporting and filtering on groups."
