When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events.\n\nkeyword\n\nerror.message\n\nError message.\n\nmatch_only_text\n\nevent.action\n\nThe action captured by the event. This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than event.category. Examples are group-add, process-started, file-created. The value is normally defined by the implementer.\n\nkeyword\n\nevent.category\n\nThis is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy. event.category represents the \"big buckets\" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on event.category:process yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to event.type, which is used as a subcategory. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories.\n\nkeyword\n\nevent.code\n\nIdentification code for this event, if one exists. Some event sources use event codes to identify messages unambiguously, regardless of message language or wording adjustments over time. An example of this is the Windows Event ID.\n\nkeyword\n\nevent.created\n\nevent.created contains the date/time when the event was first read by an agent, or by your pipeline. This field is distinct from @timestamp in that @timestamp typically contain the time extracted from the original event. In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating an event, and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used to monitor your agent's or pipeline's ability to keep up with your event source. In case the two timestamps are identical, @timestamp should be used.\n\ndate\n\nevent.dataset\n\nEvent dataset.\n\nconstant_keyword\n\nevent.duration\n\nDuration of the event in nanoseconds. If event.start and event.end are known this value should be the difference between the end and start time.\n\nlong\n\nevent.end\n\nevent.end contains the date when the event ended or when the activity was last observed.\n\ndate\n\nevent.kind\n\nThis is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy. event.kind gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events. The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data is coming in at a regular interval or not.\n\nkeyword\n\nevent.module\n\nEvent module.\n\nconstant_keyword\n\nevent.original\n\nRaw text message of entire event. Used to demonstrate log integrity or where the full log message (before splitting it up in multiple parts) may be required, e.g. for reindex. This field is not indexed and doc_values are disabled. It cannot be searched, but it can be retrieved from _source. If users wish to override this and index this field, please see Field data types in the Elasticsearch Reference.\n\nkeyword\n\nevent.outcome\n\nThis is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy. event.outcome simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event. Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of event.outcome, according to their perspective. Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer. Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with event.type:info, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense.\n\nkeyword\n\nevent.reason\n\nReason why this event happened, according to the source. This describes the why of a particular action or outcome captured in the event. Where event.action captures the action from the event, event.reason describes why that action was taken. For example, a web proxy with an event.action which denied the request may also populate event.reason with the reason why (e.g. blocked site).\n\nkeyword\n\nevent.severity\n\nThe numeric severity of the event according to your event source. What the different severity values mean can be different between sources and use cases. It's up to the implementer to make sure severities are consistent across events from the same source. The Syslog severity belongs in log.syslog.severity.code. event.severity is meant to represent the severity according to the event source (e.g. firewall, IDS). If the event source does not publish its own severity, you may optionally copy the log.syslog.severity.code to event.severity.\n\nlong\n\nevent.start\n\nevent.start contains the date when the event started or when the activity was first observed.\n\ndate\n\nevent.timezone\n\nThis field should be populated when the event's timestamp does not include timezone information already (e.g. default Syslog timestamps). It's optional otherwise. Acceptable timezone formats are: a canonical ID (e.g. \"Europe/Amsterdam\"), abbreviated (e.g. \"EST\") or an HH:mm differential (e.g. \"-05:00\").\n\nkeyword\n\nevent.type\n\nThis is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy. event.type represents a categorization \"sub-bucket\" that, when used along with the event.category field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types.\n\nkeyword\n\nfile.name\n\nName of the file including the extension, without the directory.\n\nkeyword\n\nfile.path\n\nFull path to the file, including the file name. It should include the drive letter, when appropriate.\n\nkeyword\n\nfile.path.text\n\nMulti-field of file.path.\n\nmatch_only_text\n\nfile.type\n\nFile type (file, dir, or symlink).\n\nkeyword\n\nhost.architecture\n\nOperating system architecture.\n\nkeyword\n\nhost.containerized\n\nIf the host is a container.\n\nboolean\n\nhost.domain\n\nName of the domain of which the host is a member. For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider.\n\nkeyword\n\nhost.hostname\n\nHostname of the host. It normally contains what the hostname command returns on the host machine.\n\nkeyword\n\nhost.id\n\nUnique host id. As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment. Example: The current usage of beat.name.\n\nkeyword\n\nhost.ip\n\nHost ip addresses.\n\nip\n\nhost.mac\n\nHost MAC addresses. The notation format from RFC 7042 is suggested: Each octet (that is, 8-bit byte) is represented by two [uppercase] hexadecimal digits giving the value of the octet as an unsigned integer. Successive octets are separated by a hyphen.\n\nkeyword\n\nhost.name\n\nName of the host. It can contain what hostname returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name (FQDN), or a name specified by the user. The recommended value is the lowercase FQDN of the host.\n\nkeyword\n\nhost.os.build\n\nOS build information.\n\nkeyword\n\nhost.os.codename\n\nOS codename, if any.\n\nkeyword\n\nhost.os.family\n\nOS family (such as redhat, debian, freebsd, windows).\n\nkeyword\n\nhost.os.full\n\nOperating system name, including the version or code name.\n\nkeyword\n\nhost.os.full.text\n\nMulti-field of host.os.full.\n\nmatch_only_text\n\nhost.os.kernel\n\nOperating system kernel version as a raw string.\n\nkeyword\n\nhost.os.name\n\nOperating system name, without the version.\n\nkeyword\n\nhost.os.name.text\n\nMulti-field of host.os.name.\n\ntext\n\nhost.os.platform\n\nOperating system platform (such centos, ubuntu, windows).\n\nkeyword\n\nhost.os.version\n\nOperating system version as a raw string.\n\nkeyword\n\nhost.type\n\nType of host. For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like t2.medium. If vm, this could be the container, for example, or other information meaningful in your environment.\n\nkeyword\n\nhostname\n\nName of host parsed from syslog message.\n\nkeyword\n\nhttp.request.method\n\nHTTP request method. The value should retain its casing from the original event. For example, GET, get, and GeT are all considered valid values for this field.\n\nkeyword\n\nhttp.request.referer\n\nReferrer for this HTTP request.\n\nkeyword\n\nhttp.request.referrer\n\nReferrer for this HTTP request.\n\nkeyword\n\nhttp.version\n\nHTTP version.\n\nkeyword\n\ninput.type\n\nType of Filebeat input.\n\nkeyword\n\nlabels\n\nCustom key/value pairs. Can be used to add meta information to events. Should not contain nested objects. All values are stored as keyword. Example: docker and k8s labels.\n\nobject\n\nlabels.captive_portal\n\nboolean\n\nlabels.client_server_policy_based_forwarding\n\nboolean\n\nlabels.connect_to_destination_host\n\nboolean\n\nlabels.container_page\n\nboolean\n\nlabels.decrypted_traffic\n\nboolean\n\nlabels.enterprise_credential_submission\n\nboolean\n\nlabels.file_submitted_to_WildFire\n\nboolean\n\nlabels.http_proxy\n\nboolean\n\nlabels.ipv6_session\n\nboolean\n\nlabels.nat_translated\n\nboolean\n\nlabels.non_standard_port_usage\n\nboolean\n\nlabels.payload_outer_tunnel\n\nboolean\n\nlabels.pcap_included\n\nboolean\n\nlabels.server_client_policy_based_forwarding\n\nboolean\n\nlabels.source_flow_allow_list\n\nboolean\n\nlabels.ssl_decrypted\n\nboolean\n\nlabels.symmetric_return\n\nboolean\n\nlabels.temporary_match\n\nboolean\n\nlabels.url_filter_denied\n\nboolean\n\nlabels.x_forwarded_for\n\nboolean\n\nlog.file.path\n\nPath to the log file.\n\nkeyword\n\nlog.flags\n\nFlags for the log file.\n\nkeyword\n\nlog.level\n\nOriginal log level of the log event. If the source of the event provides a log level or textual severity, this is the one that goes in log.level. If your source doesn't specify one, you may put your event transport's severity here (e.g. Syslog severity). Some examples are warn, err, i, informational.\n\nkeyword\n\nlog.offset\n\nOffset of the entry in the log file.\n\nlong\n\nlog.source.address\n\nSource address from which the log event was read / sent from.\n\nkeyword\n\nlog.syslog.facility.code\n\nThe Syslog numeric facility of the log event, if available. According to RFCs 5424 and 3164, this value should be an integer between 0 and 23.\n\nlong\n\nlog.syslog.facility.name\n\nThe Syslog text-based facility of the log event, if available.\n\nkeyword\n\nlog.syslog.hostname\n\nThe hostname, FQDN, or IP of the machine that originally sent the Syslog message. This is sourced from the hostname field of the syslog header. Depending on the environment, this value may be different from the host that handled the event, especially if the host handling the events is acting as a collector.\n\nkeyword\n\nlog.syslog.priority\n\nSyslog numeric priority of the event, if available. According to RFCs 5424 and 3164, the priority is 8 * facility + severity. This number is therefore expected to contain a value between 0 and 191.\n\nlong\n\nlog.syslog.severity.code\n\nThe Syslog numeric severity of the log event, if available. If the event source publishing via Syslog provides a different numeric severity value (e.g. firewall, IDS), your source's numeric severity should go to event.severity. If the event source does not specify a distinct severity, you can optionally copy the Syslog severity to event.severity.\n\nlong\n\nlog.syslog.severity.name\n\nThe Syslog numeric severity of the log event, if available. If the event source publishing via Syslog provides a different severity value (e.g. firewall, IDS), your source's text severity should go to log.level. If the event source does not specify a distinct severity, you can optionally copy the Syslog severity to log.level.\n\nkeyword\n\nlog.syslog.version\n\nThe version of the Syslog protocol specification. Only applicable for RFC 5424 messages.\n\nkeyword\n\nmessage\n\nFor log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer. For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event. If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message.\n\nmatch_only_text\n\nnetwork.application\n\nWhen a specific application or service is identified from network connection details (source/dest IPs, ports, certificates, or wire format), this field captures the application's or service's name. For example, the original event identifies the network connection being from a specific web service in a https network connection, like facebook or twitter. The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying.\n\nkeyword\n\nnetwork.bytes\n\nTotal bytes transferred in both directions. If source.bytes and destination.bytes are known, network.bytes is their sum.\n\nlong\n\nnetwork.community_id\n\nA hash of source and destination IPs and ports, as well as the protocol used in a communication. This is a tool-agnostic standard to identify flows. Learn more at https://github.com/corelight/community-id-spec.\n\nkeyword\n\nnetwork.direction\n\nDirection of the network traffic. When mapping events from a host-based monitoring context, populate this field from the host's point of view, using the values \"ingress\" or \"egress\". When mapping events from a network or perimeter-based monitoring context, populate this field from the point of view of the network perimeter, using the values \"inbound\", \"outbound\", \"internal\" or \"external\". Note that \"internal\" is not crossing perimeter boundaries, and is meant to describe communication between two hosts within the perimeter. Note also that \"external\" is meant to describe traffic between two hosts that are external to the perimeter. This could for example be useful for ISPs or VPN service providers.\n\nkeyword\n\nnetwork.forwarded_ip\n\nHost IP address when the source IP address is the proxy.\n\nip\n\nnetwork.packets\n\nTotal packets transferred in both directions. If source.packets and destination.packets are known, network.packets is their sum.\n\nlong\n\nnetwork.transport\n\nSame as network.iana_number, but instead using the Keyword name of the transport layer (udp, tcp, ipv6-icmp, etc.) The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying.\n\nkeyword\n\nnetwork.type\n\nIn the OSI Model this would be the Network Layer. ipv4, ipv6, ipsec, pim, etc The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying.\n\nkeyword\n\nobserver.egress.interface.name\n\nInterface name as reported by the system.\n\nkeyword\n\nobserver.egress.zone\n\nNetwork zone of outbound traffic as reported by the observer to categorize the destination area of egress traffic, e.g. Internal, External, DMZ, HR, Legal, etc.\n\nkeyword\n\nobserver.geo.name\n\nUser-defined description of a location, at the level of granularity they care about.
