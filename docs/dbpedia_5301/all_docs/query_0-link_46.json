        "text": "1 To Pakistanis In This Difficult Time Know that your enemies have infiltrated your ranks. Know that the Americans are waging a secret war against you from the Afghan soil. Know that some of your sons are being brainwashed and misled to kill their own…. Know that your pro-American govt is hand in glove with the Americans and the Indians. Time to rise.\n\n2 The next military coup has to be ‘creative’. A majority of the existing politicians need to be disbarred from politics and Bilawal Zardari, Nawaz, Altaf and Asfandyar need to be forced to stand in party elections at par with every ordinary …party member, and be defeated and removed. That’s the only way middle class Pakistanis can come forward.\n\n3 Our homeland has gone to the dogs, and these dogs are the ruling elite and an inept bureacracy. We need a ruthless ruler who will not refrain from the harshest form of justice against the thieves and the traitors. That’s what we need.\n\n4 Anti-Pakistan TTP Terrorists Equipped With U.S., Indian, German, Weapons. The latest is that these fake ‘Pakistani Taliban’ kept 105 crates of alcooholic drinks in one of their bunkers. The Uzbeks. This confirms these people are hired guns to spread terror.\n\nIt’s official – everyone on earth hates Rehman Malik. You just have to do a search on Twitter or Google Blogsearch for “Rehman Malik” and you get caustic comments by Indians angry at his latest outburst (“India responsible for most terrorist attacks”). Then you have angry Pakistani liberals, who hate Rehman Malik because he says stupidly obvious things after terrorist attacks, like blaming them on a security lapse. Then you have people who just randomly express their hatred for Rehman Malik, similar to how people randomly express their loathing for Zardari. Something like, “AAHHH GOD, WE ARE A COUNTRY OF CROOKS!!1 WE DEZERVE REHMAN MALIKKKK”. Occasionally you will see a Pakistani nationalist happy that Rehman Malik has grown a spine by denouncing Indian involvement in Balochistan or something, but these comments are soon drowned out by the next wave of Rehman Rage.\n\nIn the general spirit of hatred for Rehman Malik, you might have seen this video of Talat Hussain calling on Rehman Malik to resign, circulating the internet:\n\nIf you watch it, you will see that Talat Hussain is extremely angry that Rehman Malik – the Interior Minister – is visiting places recently bombed by terrorists and wasting valuable security on himself. Now I understand feeling angry at Rehman Malik for any number of things, but really? Visiting a bomb blast location after a blast that has made international news? Anyway, according to Hussain there was a “spontaneous outburst of anger” against Rehman Malik and the video shows young students of the International Islamic University of Islamabad stoning Rehman Malik’s motorcade and shouting angry slogans as he passes by. Now I am sure students were angry that their university wasn’t provided with better security, but if you strain your ears, from about 2:25 onwards, what you hear is students shouting REHMAN MALIK!! AMRIKI AGENT!!. I don’t want to judge people who have just been bombed too harshly, but really. Amriki Agent?! That’s what you’re angry about right after being bombed by terrorists!? This reaction is depressing beyond words. Maybe it’s just me, but Rehman Malik’s presence isn’t the troubling part of this video compared to what the students were shouting. You see, in a way Rehman Malik is the perfect symbol of the Pakistani civilian government – bumbling, inept, hated by all, and a distraction from the deeper dysfunction that you have to listen a bit harder to hear.\n\nThe parts of the book about his being embedded with the US Marines when they entered Fallujah are just incredible. At a time when the Pakistani army is going into South Waziristan and we are completely dependent on the (conflicting) accounts of the spokesmen of either side of the conflict, his account highlights the importance of embedded journalism in order for the public to gain a better understanding of the nature of the conflict.\n\nWhat really struck a chord with me were the accounts of middle class Iraqis frustrated with the direction of Iraqi democracy, even while they asserted that they would not like to return to the time of Saddam. There was this really cool account of Paul Bremer’s visit to an Iraqi hospital. Apparently they only had a few hours of electricity a day and babies were dying due to lack of oxygen. Later, Filkins returned to talk to the person in charge of record keeping at the hospital to find that the records were in complete disarray, in many cases there was no record of patients’ address or identification information. The hospital official complained about how, during Saddam’s time there was at least electricity and things ran like clockwork but that he would not want to go back to life under the tyrant. Towards the end of the book, Filkins describes how one of his interpreters, a liberal Shia, draws a diagram on his reporter’s notebook to describe the difference between the post-Saddam and the Saddam eras: for Saddam’s era she draws a large circle. For the post-Saddam era, she draws multiple small circles and some small dots representing Iraqis. According to her, in Saddam’s time, there was one large circle around which everything gravitated. Now, a collision with any of these larger circles would result in ones death and one didn’t know which way to go.\n\nThe book is full of other examples of Iraqis having trouble dealing with the negative consequences of democracy. His description of the 2006 election in which people braved dire threats from the Sunni insurgents in order to go out to vote is really moving. Most interesting is his conversation with an angry Sunni woman who, despite the likely negative outcome for her community is voting in order to save her country from the invaders (“You”). He also describes an election rally in an Iraqi factory in which the main concern of the working class Shia factory workers is that the candidates have the endorsement of the Ayatollah Sistani and how difficult it is to conduct an election in a security situation which doesn’t even allow the names of all the candidates to be revealed for security reasons.\n\nIt’s a great book, full of amazing moments which make you sit up and rethink a lot of what you think you know about Afghanistan and Iraq, even though it’s ostensibly non-political.\n\nIn a way, what has happened in Lahore over the course of this year – the terrorist attacks today, the previous attack on the Manawan police academy, the attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team — is a microcosm of what is happening to the Pakistani army in terms of client militias turning on their own support base. In the case of the Marriott bombing, the first attack on Manawan and the GHQ attack, the terrorists who’ve been implicated have been associated with the banned sectarian militant organization Lashkar-e-Jhangvi. (The terrorist mastermind Aqeel alias Dr. Usmani associated with Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and captured after the GHQ attack is suspected by the authorities to have been the organizer behind the attack on the Sri Lankan team and the Marriott bombing.)\n\nThe problem that the PML-N faces, and the reason why it’s so difficult for it to categorically condemn Punjabi sectarian militias is that the ideological support given to these militant groups has traditionally been from PML’s own power base — the Punjabi Sunni middle class and lower middle class. In 1999, Nawaz Sharif narrowly escaped an assassination attempt masterminded by Riaz Basra, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi’s founder, so it’s not exactly like the news that Lashkar is a danger to Sunni Punjabis is new. But the link between the Sunni urban class of Lahore and sectarianism could explain why, even after being almost killed by the LJ, and facing enormous security challenges from sectarians during his second tenure as PM, Nawaz Sharif could still say something like this, even in 2004:\n\nISLAMABAD, October 8 : PML (N) leader, Muhammad Nawaz Sharif has strongly condemned the bomb attack in Multan, and has expressed deep sympathy with the families of innocent victims. He said that repeated incidents of terrorism were evidence of not only incompetence but also negligence of the institutions responsible for maintaining law and order. In a statement issued on Friday, he also deplored the attitude of official spokesman and ministers who misdirect investigations with their speculative comments on such incidents. He said it was irresponsible to attribute every terrorist indent to sectarian conflicts, because such observations diverted public thinking from the fact that anti-Pakistan elements in and out of the country had been trying for long to destroy national solidarity.\n\nThere seems to still be support for sectarianism in the rank and file of the PML-N. For example, In the recent killings of Christians in Gojra, Toba Tek Singh in which Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and Sipah-e-Sahaba militants were implicated, one of the individuals mentioned in the FIR was the PML-N district president for Toba Tek Singh, Abdul Qadir Awan.\n\nLondonstani at the blog Abu Muqawama makes the point that a common theme in Islamist militant outfits is that “the downfall of militancy of this kind is built into its success”. Hopefully this will be the case with sectarian outfits in Punjab. According to Tahir Kamran, an academic at the Government University College, Lahore, as the 90s progressed and Sunni sectarian militias caused more and more trouble in Punjab, public support and donations to their organizations from middle class and lower middle class Sunnis diminished. The problem was, much as in Karachi with the MQM, shopkeepers and the business class had to keep paying these organizations as a means of “buying security” for their businesses. So even though the overt support may have decreased over time, it would take a much longer time to end the local financial backing for these groups. The only silver lining in events like the tragic attacks on Lahore today, is that in the likely event that Punjabi sectarian militias are implicated in them, they can only assist in speeding up this reversal.\n\nI’ve been doing a bit of research about the domestic political fallout from the 1965 war and the Tashkent declaration and I came across this speech [pdf] delivered by Ayub Khan on October 2 1965, 10 days after the ceasefire.\n\nHere are a few excerpts, but it’s definitely worthwhile reading the entire document:\n\nMy dear countrymen. Assalamoalaikum. The people of Pakistan were put to a great test during the month that has gone by. A treacherous enemy applied his entire armed might in a bid to conquer Pakistan. He respected no principles, recognized no rules. His sole purpose was to demonstrate to the world that his forces could subjugate a smaller neighbor. But he reckoned without the will of the people of Pakistan which proved mightier than all that the army possessed. Pitched against faith and determination of our people his vast forces dispersed and retreated. Whenever they made an attempt to advance they were thrown back in one powerful sweep. While the enemy continues to hold bits of territories along our borders, he has surrendered substantial territory in the Chamb, Khem, Karan, Fazilka and Rajhastan sectors.\n\n[…]\n\nThese facts are still unknown to the people of India because they have been drugged on the false stories of imaginary successes achieved by their rulers.\n\n[…]\n\nThe Indian air force has been crippled, their vital air bases demolished and the Indian Army’s armored might badly mauled.\n\nIn return the Indian forces can show few strips of land here and there well away from our forward defence lines and a number of civilian areas which they indiscriminately bombed.\n\n[…]\n\nHow did this miracle happen? It happened because our cause was just and moral.\n\nThis speech is just an example of the official government propaganda during the 1965 war that must be read in order for a present-day reader to understand the violent domestic reaction to the January 10 1966 Tashkent Declaration signed by Ayub Khan and Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri. The basic clauses of the Tashkent declaration were as follows:\n\n* Indian and Pakistani forces would pull back to their pre-conflict positions\n\n* The nations would not interfere in each other’s internal affairs\n\n* Economic and diplomatic relations would be restored\n\n* The two leaders would work towards building good relations between the two countries.\n\nGiven the actual military results of the war, this should not have been particularly surprising to the Pakistani public but the Pakistani public had been fed on reports of military success like the speech above and as a result there were riots in Punjab and Karachi; windows were smashed and buildings set on fire and Ayub Khan suffered a massive loss of popularity. The Tashkent Declaration was criticized by almost all major political parties and rival politicians such as Fatima Jinnah who said:\n\nWhat the blood of our brave soldiers achieved was thrown away at the conference table\n\nAir Marshal Asghar Khan’s (who was later to resign from the administration and join politics) reaction to the Declaration was:\n\nAsghar Khan narrated his impression of the Declaration in the following words: “The Indians were jubilant and smiling. Tashkent Declaration was for Pakistan a statement of surrender. The Indians were all over the room shaking any hand that they could grasp. It was as if India had defeated Pakistan in hockey at the Olympic” (Khan, 1978:120-121)\n\n(by the way, I love this quote — only in Pakistan would a comparison to an Indian victory over Pakistan in a sporting event be made to illustrate the significance of a political event)\n\nAyub Khan’s own foreign minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto distanced himself from the Ayub regime following the Declaration and was even said to have started spreading rumors that there were hidden (and even more humiliating) clauses in the Declaration that would be revealed at a later date. Ultimately the domestic reaction to the Declaration was a major contribution to the downfall of the Ayub regime.\n\nI’m always reminded of this particular sequence of events when confronted with some of the more egregious displays of political rhetoric like what we are seeing with the media and opposition reactions to the Kerry Lugar Bill. An example is Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan’s ‘fiery’ speech against the Kerry Lugar Bill in the National Assembly on Wednesday – similar to the fiery speech he delivered in favour of the ill-fated Nizam-e-Adal Regulation in Swat in April. The nature of our political space is such that it allows rhetoric to be practiced by all participants pretty much without constraint in order to maximise their short-term political gain. In the long-run, there is invariably disaster and the distance between rhetoric and reality is so extreme that the public cannot react any other way but by burying its collective head even further into the sand.\n\nJust four days ago, Ahmed Rashid was interviewed and said that he thought it was unlikely that the army would be willing to launch a Waziristan operation this close to winter and with the situation on the Eastern border still tense.\n\nIt’s amazing how the Peshawar bombing and yesterday’s GHQ attack have changed all that. Today it seemed like every time Rehman Malik made a statement, it started and ended with something like “And this explains why the Army will soon be going into Waziristan”. After yesterday’s GHQ attack, this opinion is being echoed by a lot more people. There are reports that the political and military leadership have come to an agreemnt that the Waziristan operation will soon be started and that the date for it has been finalized\n\nFor the last 7-8 hours the army has been set to take a ‘decisive action’ against the terrorists holding the 10-15 people hostage.\n\nSo apparently less than a day after the attack started, they have already tracked down the house from which the terrorists planned the attack and responsibility has been assigned to TTP & Hakeemullah Mehsud.\n\nUpdate: I just saw Hamid Gul being interviewed on Aaj saying that this is clearly an attack by India and this attack is part of a grand strategy to fool Pakistan into moving its troops from its Eastern border, all the while not realizing that India is the enemy on the Western border as well. Oh, and to de-nuclearize Pakistan by the US/Zionist/Hindu lobby.\n\nBy the way, it looks like Geo News which was covering the situation in the GHQ was briefly taken off the air.\n\nAaj is confirming that the attack on the GHQ has turned into a hostage situation in a one-story building in the GHQ.\n\nIn the meantime, Syed Muhammad Javed, the ex-commissioner of Malakand who was accused of collaborating with the Taliban during its takeover of Malakand and Buner and who was arrested after the breakdown of the Swat deal in May was quietly released from detention yesterday.\n\nNasim Zehra:\n\nSimilarly, in the security arena, external diktat mostly works. Only local players can legitimately contest over competing threat perceptions. External players at best can share their wisdom on security matters. The arm twisting delivers results only when a blundering state becomes vulnerable, as Pakistan did during Kargil. Threat perceptions, often grounded in a potpourri of historical facts, myths and fears are not susceptible to arm-twisting or counter-threats. Hard work on bilateral relationships which yields increased cooperation, progress towards resolution of outstanding problems and trust building, can alter threat perceptions.\n\nAid bills also can’t dictate the direction and development of Pakistan’s critical military security asset, that is, its nuclear programme. That will be determined by strategic developments in the region. The attempt to curtail Pakistan’s nuclear programme by disallowing it to use its own funds that may be untied from projects that US aid may fund is a non-starter way of influencing a state’s security policies.\n\nChaudhry Nisar Ali Khan:\n\n“It is clearly a compromise on the national interests as the Government of Pakistan and its lobbying persons not only let the US administration free to impose the toughest conditions but also failed to impress upon the US Congressmen in favour of Pakistan.”\n\nNisar went on to maintain that the Kerry-Lugar legislation was a negation of the country’s sovereignty and integrity. When asked about a clear and flawless stand of the PML-N on the Kerry-Lugar Bill, the opposition leader said his party could never become a part of this legislation, which being a nation is contrary to our interests.\n\nGen. Kayani (via Amir Mir’s “well-placed sources”):\n\nAccording to well placed military circles in Rawalpindi, Pakistani Army Chief General Ashfaq Kayani has made it clear to the decision makers in Islamabad that certain observations made in the Kerry-Lugar Bill were meant to degrade the Pakistani security establishment and that the Obama administration should be made to understand Islamabad’s right to decide issues of national security and foreign policy. The sources said the Pakistani Army Chief, during his October 6 meeting in Islamabad with Commander of International Forces in Afghanistan General Stanley McChrystal, has already conveyed the security establishment’s serious reservations. According to the sources, General Kayani told McChrystal that like the Pakistani people, the military and intelligence services were furious at the observations made on Pakistan’s security establishment in the Kerry-Lugar Bill.\n\nPML-Q:\n\n‘The tone and tenor of the bill in terms of conditionalities is not just intrusive, it’s also overbearing and bordering on the humiliation of Pakistan,’ said Mushahid Hussain, a leader of the Pakistan Muslim League-Q. ‘We are not being treated kindly.’\n\nShahbaz Sharif:\n\nPunjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif on Sunday termed Kerry -Lugar Bill as negation of country’s sovereignty, saying any amount of foreign assistance at the cost of freedom and prestige of the country was not acceptable to the proud people of Pakistan.\n\nTalking to people and representatives of media during his more than five-hour long visit to different areas of the provincial metropolis to review development projects, the CM said that no nation could prosper with foreign help and the pratice of reliance on others will have to be shed as the objective of economic prosperity and genuine independence could only be achieved by remaining within available resources and working tirelessly.\n\nSalmaan Taseer later responded to Sharif’s arguments against the Bill by pointing out that Sharif was wrong in saying that the $1.5 billion/year was in the form of loans:\n\nOn Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif’s comments over the aid received through the bill, Taseer said if the aid was “an intoxicant” for the nation then the $150 million received by the Punjab government as a loan from the Asian Development Bank was “not less than poison”, reiterating the bill was “a grant not a loan”. On tabling the Kerry-Lugar bill in parliament, he said the Obama administration and the US Congress had passed it and it had nothing to do with the Pakistan government."
