        "text": "Synopsis\n\nDeep Kalra of MakeMyTrip highlights his company's 2001 cash crunch and having to buy back the business or shut it down entirely. Remaining focused and having a strong team helped them navigate a difficult time. Similarly, Prashant Tandon, CEO of Tata 1MG, stresses the importance of adapting when facing regulatory challenges. While clarity attracts investors, any ambiguity can slow momentum. Tandon also mentions that regulatory change needs to be deliberate and fast-paced to capture significant opportunities.\n\n“I firmly believe that experiencing a crisis is essential for startups, and those who have not yet encountered such situations may have a steep learning curve when they do,” says Deep Kalra, Founder of MakeMyTrip, in an interview with ET as part of the Times Network India Economic Conclave Aspiration To Action - Powering India's Startup Innovation Ecosystem.\n\n“While one would always prefer a clearer and more efficient regulatory environment, it's important to adapt. Regulatory clarity plays a vital role in attracting investors, and any ambiguity can slow down momentum,” says Prashant Tandon, CEO of Tata 1MG. Edited excerpts:\n\nAyesha Faridi: What is that one factor essential for startups to survive?\n\nDeep Kalra: As a startup, you have to beware of complacency, especially in the tech world. I believe that complacency often signals the beginning of the end. When I started MakeMyTrip in 2000, it was a different scenario altogether. At that time, we were possibly the last company to get funded, and even $2 million was a significant amount.\n\nShortly after, the dotcom bust hit India in 2001. Our VCs wanted their investment back, which posed a considerable challenge since our company was just beginning to gain traction but was not yet profitable. We were faced with the choice of buying back the company or shutting down completely.\n\nThis situation coincided with the negative perception of dotcoms and zero funding opportunities. The situation was further complicated by the 9-11 tragedy and SARS, as our primary business was between the US and India. Despite these challenges, our belief in the right direction of our work and a strong, small team helped us navigate these difficult times.\n\nTo me, startups that survive crises, like the current COVID-19 pandemic, emerge stronger and more resilient. I firmly believe that experiencing a crisis is essential for startups, and those who have not yet encountered such situations may have a steep learning curve when they do.\n\nAyesha Faridi: Before we delve into this further, could you tell us how you came up with the idea of MakeMyTrip 23 years ago?\n\nDeep Kalra: The idea was the result of a combination of factors. I had worked for three different companies after getting my MBA, and I realized that I was not a \"big company guy.\" For me, the primary motivation was the internet's transformative potential. I saw the internet as a means to launch a business without setting up a physical factory or infrastructure.\n\nAs an entrepreneur, I felt as capable as anyone else to venture into this space. Moreover, my work experience and MBA degree gave me the confidence to start. Another influencing factor was my love for travel.\n\nAyesha Faridi: Interesting. Prashant, I believe the internet played a significant role in the creation of your company, Tata 1MG. How did the idea for your company come about?\n\nPrashant Tandon: I was working as a healthcare consultant in the US in 2009 when I noticed the sophisticated role technology was playing in the healthcare sector there. I believed that the Indian ecosystem would go through a similar transformation.\n\nThe critical factor for us was not so much the internet, but rather the mobile revolution, which brought the internet into people's hands. This capability was crucial for a business like 1MG because our service begins with customers taking a picture of their prescription. As we considered sectors ripe for significant change, healthcare emerged as a clear choice.\n\nThis sector was a large one with many pain points and very few technology solutions to address them. However, one of our fundamental learnings was that healthcare services are not typically designed with the consumer at the center. Drawing from my FMCG background, I saw an opportunity to create a healthcare model that put the patient at the center of everything. Despite being a regulated sector, where changes are often slow, we felt it was a problem worth solving and jumped in.\n\nAyesha Faridi: Prashant, can you tell us about the pivotal moment when Tata decided to back your company, now named Tata 1MG? How did that transpire?\n\nPrashant Tandon: Well, our journey started in 2009, and in 2021, the Tata group made their investment in 1MG. It was a very opportune time for us. Tata is a brand built on trust, a 150-year-old legacy that resonates deeply with how we want to build our company.\n\nWe shared a long-term vision to create India's most admired and impactful healthcare company, and we couldn't have found a better partner than the Tata Group. For many years, the Tata Group viewed healthcare more as a philanthropic venture, supporting the healthcare ecosystem.\n\nHowever, they expressed an interest in expanding into healthcare service delivery - pharmacy, diagnostics - and found us to be a suitable partner. We believed that our goal to establish a high-quality healthcare company in India would greatly benefit from a partner like the Tata Group, which ultimately led to the deal.\n\nAyesha Faridi: Deep, when we discuss qualifications for startups, it seems having an MBA, as both of you do, is essential.\n\nDeep Kalra: Actually, I disagree. We are just two examples. I believe that aspiring entrepreneurs should think hard about whether an MBA is the best investment of their time and money. In fact, if we had a third person here from the education sector, the conversation might be different. During the COVID era, our businesses were impacted very differently.\n\nOurs was hit hard by the lockdown, while Prashant's was booming. We've known each other for a long time and worked on a fascinating project together — the Aarogya Setu app. It was a unique time. We were trying to save costs while also creating new things. I also think that the way education is going to be revolutionized through technology is something everyone needs to be aware of.\n\nFor instance, there are numerous online courses from Coursera, Khan Academy, and even IIMs. So, you have to ask yourself whether you'd be better off taking these courses to prepare for the future or if you're willing to invest one or two years in an MBA program. So, while it worked for us, an MBA is not a prescription for success in startups.\n\nPrashant Tandon: I completely agree. Education needs a significant overhaul, especially in how we approach learning. The knowledge you gain during your education could be outdated by the time you enter the job market. Everything is being reimagined in ways we could hardly anticipate.\n\nDeep Kalra: Indeed, the skills required to navigate the new digital world are changing rapidly. When we were growing up, we took great pride in our mental math skills, something that might not be as prevalent in the current generation, given the ubiquity of calculators.\n\nBut in the future, neither might be as relevant. It's about asking the right questions and analyzing the vast amounts of data available. The problem today is there's too much data, making it difficult to discern what's important.\n\nAyesha Faridi: And we have AI tools like ChatGPT to assist us.\n\nDeep Kalra: Absolutely, AI is becoming more and more influential.\n\nAyesha Faridi: But moving back to startups, Prashant received significant funding and recognition from the Tatas. However, Deep, venture capitalists were demanding their money back from you. This was a time before startups were even called startups. Can you tell us about that journey?\n\nDeep Kalra: I'll keep it brief due to time constraints. Our toughest period was from 2001 to 2005. For any founder, the hardest part isn't going through the journey; it's knowing that there's a group of people relying on you to lead them. That's what keeps you up at night. But luckily, our persistence paid off. Two things changed in 2005: the overall funding scenario for internet companies improved, and the advent of low-cost carriers changed everything for us. We seized the opportunity to work directly with low-cost carriers, offering customers a level of control they'd never had before. This approach connected well with consumers, and there was no turning back. From 2005 to 2010, we grew 25 times over and went public in 2010. Since then, it's been a mix of organic and inorganic growth, so I can't complain. It's been a good journey.\n\nAyesha Faridi: Indeed. It's fascinating to see the strong brand recall you both have established. However, Prashant, with the constant focus on startups, whether it's about their crashes post-listing or their downgraded valuations, do you feel that high levels of funding bring about substantial pressure for startup founders?\n\nPrashant Tandon: It should. For startups to succeed, they're often trying out novel ideas or untested business models, which implies a degree of risk and the potential for mistakes. Having access to capital provides the freedom and resources to experiment and innovate. However, anyone accepting such capital should feel the obligation to deliver results, and I believe most people do. When the market's bullish and liquidity is high, it's a good time to explore various ventures.\n\nThis cyclical nature of the market, alternating between excesses and austerity, is seen globally. In such challenging times, real businesses get built and prove their resilience.\n\nThus, despite the phase where money was easily available, it was made so because investors see vast growth potential in India. They are willing to fund entrepreneurs trying out new business models, fully aware that not all will succeed. The oscillation of valuations is simply part of the market dynamics, beyond the entrepreneur's control.\n\nAyesha Faridi: And Deep, the business cycles that Prashant mentioned seem to be getting shorter and faster, don't they? The pace of change from the start of the pandemic until now has been extraordinary. We've seen startups rapidly onboard, list, and then struggle with valuation issues. Now, many are focusing on the path to profitability due to shareholder pressure. What are your thoughts on this?\n\nDeep Kalra: Indeed, and to add to Prashant's point, it's not only startups that experience these issues. Even the world's largest tech companies, such as the FAANGs, have made similar errors. During the COVID-19 pandemic, they over-invested in hiring and new technologies, only to end up laying off employees later. It's therefore understandable for young startups to make similar mistakes.\n\nHowever, one issue arises when startups receive a large amount of funding at a high valuation. It can lead to the founders feeling obliged to deliver results, and in some cases, they may even cede decision-making power to their investors. In my experience, the best investors are those who understand their limitations.\n\nThey invest in you because they trust your expertise in running your business. Unfortunately, some entrepreneurs start to feel intimidated by investors, especially those with big reputations who write substantial checks.\n\nThey might mistakenly believe these investors know more about their business than they do. This can lead to poor decisions, such as over-hiring, and then having to let staff go later.\n\nIn my view, founders should never allow their hand to be forced. They should be confident in their business and their plan. They must also prepare for the inevitable path to profitability, as investors will not provide funding indefinitely. There might be a premium on growth, but that quickly shifts when investment becomes challenging.\n\nAs an entrepreneur, you should have a clear business plan that you can deliver on with your available capital. If you receive extra funding, consider it a safety net. Having a buffer of at least a year is essential, as running out of funds can drastically change negotiation dynamics with potential investors.\n\nLastly, it's important to set realistic timelines for achieving profitability. A good rule of thumb is typically four to five years. If you can't turn a profit within this timeframe, then it might be difficult to secure funding in the future. To illustrate, my company swung from a $70 million operating loss at the start of COVID to a $70 million profit recently. It was a tough journey, but we had no choice. We needed to achieve this turnaround.\n\nAyesha Faridi: Did you have to lay off employees during COVID?\n\nDeep Kalra: It was an extremely challenging time. Letting go of people is, without a doubt, the hardest task any founder has to face. During the pandemic, our revenues plummeted by 96%, and we had to let go of 10% of our staff. Even though we tried to handle it as compassionately as possible, the pain still lingers. That responsibility rests solely with me and my co-founder. From this experience, I've learned never to over-hire again. Each new hire now prompts the question: do we genuinely need another person?\n\nAyesha Faridi: Prashant, your investors are not just financially savvy but also have extensive business knowledge. Could you share about your interactions with N Chandra and Ratan Tata? What are the boardroom conversations like?\n\nPrashant Tandon: They are incredibly supportive and trust us to run the business properly. Their extensive experience and wisdom are valuable, but they also respect our autonomy in managing the company.\n\nAyesha Faridi: Have you gained any particularly insightful wisdom or learnings from them?\n\nPrashant Tandon: I don't have any specific anecdotes to share at this moment.\n\nAyesha Faridi: You both have mentioned regulatory changes, like the 20% TCS. Will this affect your business or dissuade people from traveling abroad?\n\nDeep Kalra: Well, for those planning to travel, I'd suggest doing so before July 1st to avoid the TCS. Despite our efforts through various associations to prevent this tax, it poses a significant deterrent for travelers. Even though the tax can be reclaimed, the upfront cost is 20% higher. Despite possible employer adjustments, this upfront cost could dissuade potential travelers.\n\nAyesha Faridi: It seems like an additional burden.\n\nDeep Kalra: Indeed, and while I understand the government's intention to expand the tax net, there are other ways to approach it. Instead of creating hindrances like this, there should be discussions about how to facilitate growth.\n\nIf these regulations continue to multiply, it could become a regressive step. It's important to realize that any increase in fares, even by 10%, affects the decisions of travelers, whether they're on a business trip or a leisure vacation. This could lead people to postpone trips or find alternative means of travel. In my view, travel is one of the purest joys of life, and after being locked up for two and a half years, people should be encouraged to explore the world. We are still advocating for moderation in these regulations.\n\nAyesha Faridi: So, this could significantly impact foreign travel?\n\nDeep Kalra: Absolutely.\n\nAyesha Faridi: Prashant, there is a lot of regulation in your industry as well. How will you compete with traditional chemists in this regulatory environment?\n\nPrashant Tandon: While one would always prefer a clearer and more efficient regulatory environment, it's important to adapt. Regulatory clarity plays a vital role in attracting investors, and any ambiguity can slow down momentum. Although the authorities are actively participating and listening now, many startups can't afford to wait for regulatory clarifications.\n\nWe've found it helpful to proactively engage with regulators, spending time explaining our business model and its benefits. With the fast pace of innovation, the regulatory regime needs to catch up, and it needs to do so quickly. Despite the challenges, there are significant opportunities ahead, and we need a deliberate and efficient approach to regulatory change to capture these opportunities.\n\n15 Atmanirbhar stocks to include in your portfolio this Independence Day\n\nThe Ola Electric story: What makes Bhavish Aggarwal India's most impatient man?\n\nWhy Akasa’s losses are mounting when IndiGo is posting record profits\n\nYour EV is 40% Chinese, and will remain so if this jigsaw is not solved\n\nWhy success of Blackstone’s repeat IT bet depends on these ifs and buts\n\nThree reasons why Tata Motors has taken a contrarian view on hybrids\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3"
