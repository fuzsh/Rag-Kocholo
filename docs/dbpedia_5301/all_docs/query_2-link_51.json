        "text": "Hazrat Baba Farid-ud-Din Ganj Shakar R.A\n\nDistrict Pakpattan is famous in the world due to Sufi Saint Hazrat Baba Farid-ud-Din (R.A). The city was renamed Pakpattan (meaning \"Clean Land\" in old Punjabi) after the arrival of Sufi Saint Baba Farid-ud-Din whose shrine is located here. Today people from all over the world come to pass through a gate called \"Bahishti Darwaza\" or \"Heaven's Gate\" to the shrine from the 1st of Muharram to the 5th of Muharram every year. Hazrat Baba Farid, was married to the daughter of the King of that era, Ghayyas-ud-Din Balban. The founder of the Sikh Faith Guru Nanak had reverence to Baba Farid and hence Sikhs also come here to pay tribute. In 1770 after a battle between Mubarak Khan II of Bahawalpur and Hari Singh, it was agreed that the neutral town of Pakpattan, held by a Muslim saint of eminence, should be the common boundary.\n\nHazrat Baba Farid-ud-Din Ganj Shakar died on the 5th of Muharram 664 A.H. corresponding to 17 October 1265 C.E. Baba Farid settled down in a place very next to his current shrine. Once this place was marked with a tall flag that can be seen from the entrance of the main mosque of the shrine. He started preaching to the Hindus about Islam. In a short time, a huge number of Hindus in the region embraced Islam. Those who did not become ardent followers of Baba Farid, still often visited him to seek spiritual guidance.\n\nDewan Madood Masood Chishti (Sajjada Nasheen)\n\nPakpattan remained under the heavy influence of the local Gadi/Sajjada Nasheen of Shrine Baba Farid, for centuries. These Gadi/Sajjada Nasheens were mostly bogeymen and worked as agents of the rulers. But all of these rulers, kings and government executives had respect for the Saint Farid. Many of them visited the shrine and gave charity and lands for the shrine. King Balban and Mughal King Akbar along with his son came to visit the shrine. Sikh ruler Ranjit Singh had much respect for the Saint Farid and was always sending money and gifts for the shrine and its caretakers.\n\nMian Nawaz Sharif (Ex. Prime Minister), Benazir Bhutto (Ex. Prime Minister), Pervez Musharaf (Ex. President of Pakistan), and Prime Minister Imran Khan also visited the shrine of Baba Farid-ud-Din Ganj Shakar.\n\nPoliticians\n\nPakpattan proved barren in the field of politics. It could not give birth to any significant national political leader except some turncoats. Some local politicians are:\n\nMian Farrukh Mumtaz Maneka\n\nPir Muhammad Shah Khaga\n\nPir Ahmad Shah Khaga\n\nMuhammad Naeem Ibraheem\n\nMian Amjad Joia\n\nMian Atta Muhammad Maneka\n\nMian Ahmad Raza Maneka\n\nMian Navid Ali\n\nRana Iradat Ali\n\nDewan Azmat Said Chishti\n\nDr. Farrukh Javaid\n\nBadar Miandad\n\nBadar Miandad was born in 1960 in a noted family of qawwals in Pakpattan. His father Miandad and grandfather Din Muhammad were reputed qawwals. He was also cousin of the late maestro Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. The late Badar started enthralling qawwali lovers in 1975 and by the mid-80s he had earned fame.\n\nWahdat Rameez\n\nWahdat Rameez is a young talent in Pakistani Music. He is a folk and classical singer. He showed his performance on many Sufi kalams and created his name in the music industry of Pakistan. He has shown his performance on different Punjabi poetry.\n\nShahbaz Qamar Faridi\n\nShahbaz Qamar Faridi is a famous naat khawan and sings beautiful naats in the history of Pakistan. He belongs to Pakpattan, Pakistan, where the shrine of Hazrat Baba Farid-ud-Din Ganj Shakar (R.A) is located. Shahbaz Qamar Faridi is one of the best Naat Khawans and one of his very famous Naat is \"Mere Aqa Ao ke Mudat Hoi hai, Jithe Madni Da Dera Ae\".\n\nAyesha Bakhsh\n\nAyesha Bakhsh is a Pakistani television news anchor and journalist. She is known for her work on Pakistan's news channel, Geo News. Ayesha Bakhsh was born in Pakpattan District, Punjab, Pakistan. She is the daughter of Mian Mohammad Bakhsh and Rubina Bakhsh.
