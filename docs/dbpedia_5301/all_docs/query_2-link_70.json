        "text": "In an exclusive interview with Tanvir Gill & Ayesha Faridi, Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, Partner, Rare Enterprises, says ant-profiteering clause is of little use. If there are five manufacturers and two pass on the tax benefit, the other three will also have to pass it on.\n\nEdited excerpts:\n\nWhat do you think GST implementation would do for the perception of India?\n\nLet us not be burdened with India’s perception, let us be burdened with the reality. The effect of GST is going to be far deeper than tax itself because first it will lead to digitisation. Anybody who has a business with a turnover of more than Rs 20 lakh in India will have to digitalise their business and that is going to bring in tremendous efficiency in the way we work.\n\nSecond, it is going to lead to big logistical gains because companies had to maintain warehouses in each state as they do not want to pay the central sales tax and lorries were stopped in lots of places, in each of the state they entered, each city they entered.\n\nThirdly, overall they have kept rates which are not going to lead to any increase in taxation. Overall, there is going to be some reduction in taxes and not some increase. There will be some increase, some items may decrease also. Today, if I go to a five star hotel and have dinner, I am going to pay 18% tax -- whether it is Mumbai or in Delhi. Earlier, somewhere the tax was 24% and somewhere it was 21% and they had five kinds of taxes. They will have digitalised records from every place I visit and every purchase that I had made will come up.\n\nSo, no scanning of the bills anymore?\n\nNo. Therefore, if a person does a lot of shopping and he is not paying taxes, it will lead to much greater tax compliance. See people are going to cry, it is difficult, everybody likes the status quo. It is a very step and I only feel sorry that it took 15 years to pass and implement a law which we all felt we needed. Every political party essentially supported it.\n\nBetter late than never.\n\nI am not saying better late than never, but I am saying as a country, as a society, as a democracy we should examine why this reform took 15 years.\n\nIt was 10 years in the making.\n\nBut we live in a dynamic world, we got to invite a lot of capital. We cannot afford change at such a slow pace. I am not blaming an individual, I am not blaming any politician, I am blaming us as a society that why we as a society took 15 years to implement this.\n\nWith a lot of hype around GST implementation, markets also somewhat seem to be getting in a bit of a pause mode of late. There is a lot of chaos in the market. What will be the earnings impact? Inflation will go up. Do you think these concerns are valid concerns or is it just a noise right now?\n\nA market acts like a woman, very difficult to fathom. Markets go from 7800 to 9700. It will be a flawless rise of five-six months. If the market pauses here, it does not lose much and they are trying to find too many reasons into the markets’ pause. The market has paused because people are very apprehensive. So what about inflation? It is at 2.5%. It is below RBI inflation. We are sitting on a good monsoon, we are sitting on low oil prices, I do not know where inflation is going to come from. They say markets climb a wall of worry. When I see so much worry around, I feel refreshed.\n\nMay be the concern of inflation is because of the fear that the tax benefits will not be passed on to the consumers in the interim?\n\nWe live in a competitive society. If there are five manufacturers and two pass it on, the other three will also have to pass it on. What I do not agree is what you mean by tax. I am giving an inclusive price to the customers with tax. If I was slated for a price increase in June and the taxes come down, I do not take the price increase. I do not agree with the government that you can determine the price by tax alone. Tax is one of the elements of price.\n\nTherefore, every industry will decide whether they will be able to pass it on and in a situation where there is no inflation, where there is spare capacity, everybody wants volumes. I do not think the anti-profiteering is going to lead to anything.\n\nWhat about the earnings impact? Will it have impact for next two to three quarters? Does it even matter because like you said the market is pausing for its own reasons?\n\nJust like I felt at the time of demonetisation, I said are you going to stop eating? Are you going to stop watching movies? Are you going to stop going to restaurants? Are people going to stop buying cars? So there may be a very transitory effect. For the customer, nothing has changed except some kind of apprehension. Prices go up, prices go down. You give me one reason why demand should be affected.\n\nWe are more concerned with supply challenges in the interim…\n\nWhat supply challenges?\n\nAs manufacturers adjust to the new regime over the period of July-August…\n\nI know of companies who have planned for the transition. Some are enhancing the dispatches in June, some are holding back their dispatches. For the consumption point of view, you look at the consumer, how is he affected.\n\nIf things become expensive, you will go for the cheaper models. It is as simple as that.\n\nNo but what is going to be expensive and what is not going to be expensive who knows?\n\nIn certain items, the rate of tax has increased but effective tax rate has decreased because the input credits are greater than the increase in the rate.\n\nYes and that needs to be brought out even more that adjusting for the input tax credit. Actually the numbers look quite rational.\n\nEvery industry can price itself at whatever prices they want and I do not think that the unorganised sector is going to be hit as badly as people think because you think say there is 12% VAT on pipes, now we feel that the unorganised fellow is not paying any VAT and therefore he is avoiding the entire 12%. But the matter of the fact is that 80% of his cost is plastic on which he gets a VAT. He gets input credit. So actually what he is evading is 2.4%. When people tell you that there is 12% tax they are evading, do not believe them because that is without the input credit. Even if the small SME person if he starts paying tax, he will also get the input credit.\n\nThat is the CA Rakesh Jhunjhunwala. He has done all his maths… this is a very interesting point that you have raised. I have been talking about this every single day on the channel. A large perception is that with GST coming in, the organised sector will get their much awaited opportunity of getting into the unorganised sector and expanding there…\n\nThere are two things. The taxes that were being avoided or evaded, it is not that the benefit of that was coming to the manufacturer. It was being passed on to the consumers. Partly, the prices of the unorganised sector will also have to rise but it is not in terms of 12% excise duty and the organised sector was paying it. All this hype that they are going to get benefits is going to let a lot of people come into the income tax bracket.\n\nTax to GDP will definitely go up.\n\nThat is…\n\nWhat sectors do you think would benefit most from the GST implementation? You talked about digitisation. You have talked about logistics as a space. The problem is that consumption and logistics already has run up so much, as investors people only want is where is the opportunity, what can I buy right now…\n\nI am not talking about logistic companies. I am not talking consumption. What I am saying is that movement of goods throughout India for every manufacturer will be free.\n\nWhat changes for the consumer? Today if I go buy a pen, even if I do not take a bill he charges me excise. I take a bill, he is going to charge me tax. What difference does it make to me? For the consumer nothing has changed. It is only in the supply chain. So why this hype? Initially there is going to be difficulty. Whenever any change comes we find it hard to adjust to it\n\nI remember 1991 reforms. People said, steel industry will close down, everything in India will close down and it ended up being more efficient. So, the benefits for us as a society and as a country will lead to forced morality and willingness to pay taxes. The cost of evasion will become much higher than the cost of paying it.\n\nAnd as an investor also you are saying it is a beneficiary move?\n\nAbsolutely. The more Indians come into the tax net, more reasonable will be the rates be.\n\nTax to GDP needs to go up. That has been rightly pointed out. One more angle to GST is that when the earlier form of GST came out which was one tax one nation and now we have about four slabs, the broad assumption was that it will push growth by 1-1.5% to 2% which will take us comfortably beyond 8%, 8.5% and may be even 9%. Now with this toned down version or let us say work-in- progress version, the expectation is we will do about 50-60 bps. H ow do you look at the long term growth trend and what would you say on that front?\n\nLet me not guess, everybody is guessing, nobody knows. There are some predictions that it will go up by 8%, some predictions it will go up by 20 bps. I think there will be gain but I do not think the gain is going to be big. It is going to take time. Digitisation itself will lead to efficiencies, movement of goods, exports, better logistical movements. To quantify that gain today is difficult. There are going to be as many intangible gains as there are going to be tangible gains. I personally feel India is poised for double digit growth, GST is an aid to it, even without GST we would have reached there.\n\nWhen, 10-11% by when?\n\nMy son was asking me for Rs 5 crore, I said I will give you Rs 100 crore. He was also asking me when. If you ask my personal judgment, post 2019-2020 we are poised for double digit growth.\n\nYou have always maintained that.\n\nYes, but sometimes I feel will I keep changing as times keep passing. Sometimes I feel embarrassed but also confident.\n\nWhich is why you should give nearer term targets…\n\nTarget for what?\n\nMarket, economy, growth, all of it.\n\nWhen you go to a restaurant and have food, do you have a target for how good it is, you know it is good.\n\nA year and a half ago, in your interaction with Nikunj, you had forewarned the markets about how the NPA mess is going to play out and that was exactly the way you predicted it to be. Is there any worry factor in the market right now because it seems like the NPA situation is being very well tackled right now?\n\nSee the tackling of the NPA is a journey and it is not a destination. I personally feel in the next 18 months, it will be tackled. Earlier, bank officers were afraid who would take responsibility but now you will have a court approved process and you will have an independent authority that will make a scheme and outsiders may also be allowed to bid. This is going to have a very big demonstration effect. It will be very easy now. Businessmen and banks will understand that prolonging things is not going to help. It will lead to more responsible lending and borrowing.\n\nAre you encouraged by the fact that this is perhaps the signal that the government, RBI and banks are giving out that enough with procrastination, let us get down to doing business?\n\nYes, that feeling was there for the last two years. Let us get down to business. But the question is how do we get down to business. Suppose they get the top 30 accounts and 50% of the NPAs. It is a substantial movement and the moment two, three assets are resolved either by restructuring or by auction and if you set fair and easy fair terms you will have lots of bidders not only from India but from abroad also coming up. This process jo 14 saal ka banwas tha... will still take 18 to 24 months and the benefits and the costs will vary from bank to bank.\n\nAnd in that I mean would you say that private banking lot would be a winner or would you stick by with the PSUs?\n\nPrivate banking is already a winner.\n\nNot across the board?\n\nYes, but I think the private sector banks are much better provided for. The resturn on assets of public sector banks without the credit cost is very low. Private sector banks are far more efficient.\n\nWould this change the course of functioning for PSU banks because now they will require more capital for the provisioning that they have done for putting these bad loans off their balance sheet. Is there is going to be a series of capitalisation?\n\nSee let us not guess without knowing any figures. Each bank’s circumstances are different like State Bank still earns Rs 50,000-60,000 crores operating profit. It will not need further capital. Some banks may need to raise capital three, four times.\n\nAt some point in time, wouldn’t there be any value in PSU banks?\n\nThe only problem is that value is an adjective -- it means different things for different people. There are problems with PSU banks. Their cost can go up constantly, their top management is short lived, it is not very motivated and they will constantly need dilution. It is not only the bad NPA problem. It differs from bank to bank . but wy should we have more than three-four public sector banks?\n\nWhat about the quasi PSU banks like an ICICI, Axis Bank, they have not done as well as the HDFC, Kotak Bank?\n\nBut they are not quasi PSU banks.\n\nQuasi in the sense they are also tainted because of the bad loans situation on their growth and now they have resolved some of that.\n\nBut if you remove the credit cost which was the past mistakes they are efficient enough.\n\nSo, you find comfort in the top layer private sector banks?\n\nLet me not comment about that.\n\nI am not asking for a stock name, I am just categorising. I am just trying to understand the bad loans of the PSU banks.\n\nLet me say one thing there are two aspects in banks; one is the NPA problem, one is how well they are earning without the NPA problems. The question is which bank has the NPA problem but is very efficiently run and there are banks which have the NPA problem and are not efficiently run. I am talking long term."
