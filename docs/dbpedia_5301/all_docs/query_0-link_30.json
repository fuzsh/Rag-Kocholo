        "text": "Muslim Belonging in Secular India surveys the experience of some of India’s most prominent Muslim communities in the early post-colonial period. Muslims who remained in India after the Partition of 1947 faced distrust and discrimination and were consequently compelled to seek new ways of defining their relationship with fellow citizens of India and its governments. Using the forcible integration of the princely state of Hyderabad in 1948 as a case study, Taylor C. Sherman reveals the fragile and contested nature of Muslim belonging in the decade that followed independence. In this context, she demonstrates how Muslim claims to citizenship in Hyderabad contributed to intense debates over the nature of democracy and secularism in independent India. Drawing on detailed new archival research, Dr Sherman provides a thorough and compelling examination of the early governmental policies and popular strategies that have helped to shape the history of Muslims in India since 1947\n\nThe partition riots that erupted in Delhi following independence in 1947 resulted in the massacre of thousands of Muslims and the departure of roughly 300,000, leaving the remaining Muslim community seriously depleted, both numerically and politically. The article investigates the spatial aspect of Muslim minoritization in the city, namely their ghettoization, resulting from ongoing struggles over Muslim houses. It traces the gradual encroachment on the Muslim majority neighbourhoods designated ‘Muslim zones’. An analysis of this dynamic reveals that, contrary to the prevalent assumption that Muslim zones were outside the jurisdiction of the Custodian of Evacuee Property, a great deal of the Custodian’s intervention took place precisely in these areas. This investigation also reveals that, in addition to civic violence and the bureaucratic violence of the Custodian, a host of other factors played a significant role in determining the geography and intensity of encroachment—namely deep political divisions that cut across all levels of governance and policing, as well as socioeconomic class, informal economy, and corruption. This divided political, bureaucratic, and social landscape reflected the profound uncertainties underlying the process of decolonization, and sustained the violence that lingered on long after the partition riots had ended according to official narratives.\n\nThe studies on various societies and the recent changes in some countries show that religion whether as a social structure or an important part of culture, still has some important social functions. This book has followed the use of religion in politics in a society still traditional but with a secular state. It is an attempt to understand why religion is important in politics and politicians still use it. For this purpose, India as a context of the study has been examined. The study tries to find out the reasons for the continuous relevance of religion in the Indian political arena. It clarifies the different aspects of political function of religion in contemporary India and the political groups or leaders who have made an effective use of this function. It also tries to explore the impact of the new situation in post-independence India on the political functions of religion in the country. The book, originally written in 2013 as a PhD thesis, which mentions a possible Abrahamic agreement between Islamic, Jewish and Christian states (p. 62), similar to what was later happened in 2020 under Abraham Accords between USA, Israel and Arab countries.
