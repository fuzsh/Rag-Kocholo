        "text": "The ba was often written with the sign of a saddle-billed stork or a human-headed falcon and translated into modern languages as the “soul.” It counts among key Egyptian religious terms and concepts, since it described one of the individual components or manifestations in the ancient Egyptian view of both human and divine beings. The notion of the ba itself encompassed many different aspects, spanning from the manifestation of divine powers to the impression that one makes on the world. The complexity of this term also reveals important aspects of the nature of and changes within ancient Egyptian religion.\n\nn3971 n3971 1 In the previous proposal for encoding the Typikon symbols (Shardt & Andreev, 2009), the basic symbols found in the Typikon as used by the Orthodox Church were included. It came to our attention that these symbols only covered the usage of modern, Synodal era (post-1700) texts. However, to typeset texts of the pre-Nikonian period, an additional symbol needs to be added to the range U+1F54x. This symbol is used in the texts of the Old Rite, that is, those Orthodox Christians who did not recognise the liturgical and textual reforms of Patriarch Nikon in the 17 th century, as well as occasionally in New Rite, or post-Nikonian, service books. Furthermore, following the fall of the USSR, there has been renewed interest in the Old Rite texts both among the adherents of the New Rite and the scholars of Russian liturgics and literature. Thus, the typesetting of these texts would be useful for a broad community. Based on the information in Chapter 57 of the Old Rite Orthodox Oko...\n\nThe Story of the Alphabet, in 22 Letters, flows from the native original Letters: ALphah to Taúwah. The non-discriminatory Vibrations in the Uni-Verse and their messages of ALhhim are visible Waves of Wisdom rising from the INvisible Sea of Understanding. The Letters comprise The Signs of Days. The pages are a treatise of Word formulations. An explanation to the origins in the NAME Y.H.W.H. is included through which the Visible sound Spectrum of Colours are seen by the rising Sun unto their setting. What appears daily, to be seen, comes to settle in the Light of the Moon nightly, to be heard. The 22 Letters of the ALphah Bet generate Acrostic Writings, as prose, in Scriptures. Words Written are the Legacy of the Letters. Sounds of the Letters are those heard in harmonic vibrations in the Body of all species, whereby the ALphaBet vibes are heard and spoken from within. Fire activations on the tongue consummate Waters of residences unto no more sea, whereby through the WORDS we speak, we evolve into new cognitive states in Heavens and their renewed Earths.\n\n-- கம் kam , n. < karman.
