        "text": "Why borrow from Rabindra-Jivanananda in the title of the novel?\n\n: Because I am not ashamed to borrow from them.\n\n: What would you say if ‘You’ doesn’t make sense as a romance novel [as written on the cover]?\n\n: I won’t say anything.\n\n: Well, a little different question, can children be friends without love?\n\n: Why can’t you?\n\n: The kind of friendship between two boys and two girls, can there be a similar friendship between a boy and a girl?\n\n: Of course not. Because there is something Freudian about it.\n\n: Then he said…\n\n: Actually, the matter is a bit complicated. You ask another question.\n\n: What is the most memorable event of your life?\n\n: Getting the Bangla Academy Award for writing three novels is a memorable event for me. No, no, don’t write that. Then people may think I am proud. Enter Gultekin (wife) introduction.\n\n: Sad event?\n\n: Death of father.\n\nAfter a while the entertainment started again. Some talk about literature started.\n\n: Whose writing is your favorite in Bengali literature?\n\n: Vibhutibhushan Banerjee, Manik Banerjee, Tarashankar, Bimal Kar, Satinath Bhaduri, Sunil Gangopadhyay.\n\n: How does Shankar feel?\n\n: good Some of his early novels are very good.\n\n: Apart from Bengali literature, do you read any foreign literature? Who is dear?\n\n: once read a lot. still reading Favorite is John Stein-Beck. Remak.\n\n: In your opinion, between the big story and the novel, where is the difference?\n\n: I don’t know.\n\n: In the preface to ‘Sankhanil Prison’, he referred to ‘Nandit Narake’ as a ‘story’, whereas it was considered and awarded as a ‘novel’. So why tell the ‘story’?\n\n: There is no use in asking me these things. Such questions should be asked by the student of literature. I once wrote a book review in ‘Robbar’. Later everyone started narrating it and I also put it in my story book (‘Ananda Bednar Kavya’).\n\n: If you were asked to define a novel, how would you define it?\n\n: No way. If I knew what a novel was, I would have written it myself. Is any of what I wrote really a novel?\n\n: Do you have any plans to write a full-length novel in the future?\n\n: Yes, I will write a novel on a large canvas on the Liberation War; And for this I am also studying.\n\n: Bankim, from Sharat to the present day the genre of novels has changed a lot. What do you think is the reason?\n\n: Effect of time. A novel is a picture of time. Novels will change as time changes.\n\n: How much practical experience do you think is necessary in creating a novel?\n\n: A lot.\n\n: What qualities must a good novel have?\n\n: Society and tomorrow will emerge in a worthwhile novel. The author will try to give a vision. A novel is not just a story. Something beyond the story.\n\n: Is a good story essential for a good story?\n\n: No.\n\n: Well, how can social reform be done with literature?\n\n: I don’t know. I myself do not write anything thinking about social reform.\n\n: When writing, what kind of reader do you consider?\n\n: Science fiction written for younger readers. When I write everything else, I don’t remember what class of readers I am writing for. Those who want to read.\n\n: Why is there no political statement in your writing?\n\n: You can see from now on.\n\n: That means politics will come?\n\n: Yes.\n\nHumayun Ahmed shook his head.\n\n: What kind could it be?\n\n: I don’t want to say anything in advance.\n\n: The reason for not coming so long?\n\n: For so long I was inclined towards telling stories. I neglected the society that created this story yesterday. It seems that personal happiness and sadness are all.\n\n: Do you think that every man should do politics?\n\n: off course. It’s a part of our life.\n\n: What political ideology do you personally believe in?\n\n: I wholeheartedly believe that every human being has equal rights.\n\n: There is also some talk about personal likes and dislikes.\n\n: Who is your favorite among the young writers of Bangladesh?\n\n: Imdadul Haque Milan, Manju Sarkar.\n\n: Favorite novelist?\n\n: Syed Haque, Shaukat Osman, Shaukat Ali.\n\n: Poet?\n\n: Shamsur Rahman, Nirmalendu Guna.\n\n: Playwright?\n\n: Humayun Ahmed.\n\n: Poetry?\n\n: Jibanananda Das’s ‘One Day Eight Years Ago’.\n\n: Drama?\n\n: ‘Nripati’ (written by himself, to be premiered in February).\n\n: Father did not come to your novel?\n\n: Baba has appeared in my stories many times, in many ways (Shankhanil Jail).\n\n: As for that mother comes less often…\n\n: Perhaps you are not true.\n\nFinally, I asked Humayun Ahmed, tell me something for new writers.\n\n: I have only one word for new writers, read, read a lot, read all authors. It will take over the language. It will also be clear how a writer is ‘treating’ the characters. Again, eyes and ears should be kept open. For example, how people of a profession talk, how they walk, these should also be seen. Apart from that, if you read poetry, it seems that the possession of the language comes quickly.\n\nWhat Ayesha Faiz said about Humayun Ahmed"
