        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nUnder-nutrition is currently estimated to effect 1.3 million people over 65 years of age in the UK.1 Oral nutritional supplement beverages (ONS) are liquid foods that are used to improve nutritional intake in older adults and patients with a variety of health and eating problems. In a wide variety of hospital and community patients at risk of under-nutrition, the use of ONS has been shown to improve energy and nutrient intake, increase body weight and functional outcomes, reduce mortality and complications, and reduce length of stay in hospitalised patients when compared with routine clinical care.2 However, frail older adults with low food intakes can find it difficult to consume sufficient ONS, with reasons such as taste and volume given, to the extent that even with feeding assistance by trained staff their nutritional status is not improved.3 It is therefore generally accepted that offering a variety of supplements with different sensory characteristics (appearance, flavour, texture, consistency and composition) is likely to improve compliance and intake more than when only one type of supplement is used, especially for longer-term use when ‘taste fatigue’ can develop.4\n\nMeal fortification can improve energy (+26%) and protein (+23%) intake in hospitalised older adults,5 and addition of energy-dense ingredients to regular meals is an inexpensive way to improve voluntary energy intake.6 It has been suggested that it is possible for older patients to achieve their nutritional needs using a combination of smaller portions of increased energy and protein density and between-meal snacks.7\n\nConcerning micro-nutrients, the UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) provided guidelines in 2006 for food provision for older adults in residential care8 which recommended levels for five minerals (sodium, potassium, magnesium, iron and zinc) and three vitamins (riboflavin, vitamin D and folate). Bates et al.9 found iron, vitamin D, folate and vitamin C to be both low in intake and biochemically deficient in elderly institutionalised adults. Russell and Suter10 concluded that US recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) for vitamin D, riboflavin, vitamins B6 and B12 should be increased. These two studies strongly suggest an increased requirement for vitamin C in older people.\n\nHowever, when considering fortification of foods with micro-nutrients it is important to consider that vitamins and minerals can impart tastes (such as bitter, salty, sour, sweet and metallic) and mouth-feel properties (such as astringency) to food products.11,12 It is not known whether the sensations associated with micro-nutrient fortification impact on the sensory properties of biscuits or biscuit liking in older adults. Overall, studies of taste sensitivity amongst older people show a gradual decline with age, with taste thresholds (e.g. salt and sweet) increasing;13 however, the extent of the decline and whether it has an impact on food selection has been debated by many authors.14–16 The loss of gustatory and olfactory acuity is highly variable between individuals.16 Certain medical conditions, and some drugs, may also impair the senses of taste and smell and thereby reduce appetite, leading to a reduction in food intake.17 However, sensory decline may be to the advantage of micro-nutrient supplementation in biscuits for older people; it may be that potentially negative tastes are below the threshold level for most older hospital patients.\n\nThe hypothesis of this study was that a protein-fortified biscuit of high energy density, supplemented with vitamins and minerals needed by older adults could be developed and would be acceptable to them. The aim was to develop a biscuit with sufficient fat and sugar levels to exhibit the functional properties of a typical short dough product, to enrich it with whey protein and to fortify it with micro-nutrients. The objectives were to (1) develop protein and micro-nutrient fortified biscuits; (2) investigate two strategies of micro-nutrient fortification by (a) matching a typical ONS beverage and (b) incorporating nutrients known to be needed by older adults at one third of the daily requirements; (3) develop a gluten-free alternative suitable of patients with coeliac disease; (4) obtain sensory profiles of the biscuits; and (5) assess consumer liking of the fortified biscuits to determine their potential as a commercial product to help meet the nutritional needs of older people.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe biscuits produced in this study were of the short dough type, typically made from soft and weak wheat flours and characterised by a formula high in sugar and fat. The high quantities of sugar and fat in the dough allow plasticity and cohesiveness without the formation of an elastic gluten network.19 Biscuits usually show a substantial increase in diameter during baking that is attributed to the gluten which forms a collapsible film.20 The GF biscuit increased similarly in size post baking due to xanthan gum which can mimics the visco-elastic properties of gluten.21\n\nShort dough biscuits with fat contents over 20% are the most widespread type of biscuits on the market.22 Protein content is usually low as higher protein contents lead to harder biscuits. In a previous paper, the protein content of a standard short dough biscuit was 4.8% (w/w) and the energy content was 448 kcal 100 g−1.19 Higher fat, protein and energy levels are found in products such as commercial shortcake biscuits, at 28.4 g 100 g−1, 6.3 g 100 g−1 and 520 kcal 100 g−1, respectively.\n\nIn Trial 1, all types of biscuits were higher in protein than standard biscuits (12.3–12.4% w/w) and contained high amounts of fat and carbohydrates (Table ). Energy content varied between 462 kcal 100 g−1 for the oat biscuits and 474 kcal 100 g−1 for the GF biscuits. A portion size of the biscuits was considered to be 65 g (two biscuits) equating to 306–317 kcal per portion. Typical ONS beverages have energy contents of 138 kcal 100 mL−1 equating to 275 kcal per portion. The energy content of the Trial 1 biscuits was, therefore, slightly higher than the energy content of a typical ONS beverage; however, comments from the older volunteers in the liking trials indicated that the portion size was too large, so this was modified to 40 g in the second trial. From the second trial formulations, a portion size of two biscuits (40 g) provided 209 kcal (Table ). A typical commercial short dough biscuit weighs 14–15 g, and they are often sold as individual packs of three biscuits. Through provision of approximately 200 kcal in a realistic biscuit portion size, we believe that compliance for product would be high and, therefore, this energy intake would be achieved. In comparison, poor compliance with ONS has been demonstrated previously with 63% of ONS being wasted when monitored on an elderly care ward.23\n\nTable 5\n\nNutrients per portion (40 g biscuits, 200 mL beverage)% of Daily RNIa within a portionNutrientRNIaControl oat cookieONS cookieOP cookieTypicald ONS beverageControl oat cookieONS cookieOP cookieTypicald ONS beverage (200 mL)MicronutrientsVitamin D (µg)10ND0.771.922.0ND81920Riboflavin (B2) (mg)1.20.010.190.230.50.7161941Vitamin B6 (mg)NR (1.3)b0.010.210.220.50.6161741Folate (B9) (µg)2001323977.30.4161939Vitamin C (mg)NR (40)bND128.0026.9ND292067Potassium (mg)3500c29832383530.82710Magnesium (mg)30053026621.610921Iron (mg)90.342.282.134.73.8252452Zinc (mg)9.50.251.862.163.92.6202341MacronutrientsEnergy (kcal)195520920520727511101114Protein (g)505.15.05.013.610101027Fat (g)<74.513.012.713.09.218171712Saturated fatty acids (g)<23.59.08.78.91.23837385\n\nThe oat biscuits contained 7.7 g of WPI (95% protein), 18.8 g soft wheat flour (9% protein) and 18.8 g oats (17% protein) per 100 g dough. Therefore the 11.7–12.7% protein in the final baked products comprised 59.5% whey protein, 14.1% wheat protein and 26.4% oat protein. Whey protein has been found to stimulate muscle protein synthesis better than other protein sources.24 The percentage of energy from protein was 10% for the Trial 1 biscuits, whereas in a typical commercial shortcake biscuit it is 4.8%.\n\nThe fat content of the study biscuits was 24–32 g 100 g−1, of which saturated fats were 13.5–22.4 g 100 g−1. This was above the FSA guidelines for older people (maximum total % energy from fat 35%, from saturated fat 11%); however, the guidelines were not written specifically for malnourished older adults where a higher intake of fat and sugar in the short term to boost energy intake is often acceptable. In addition, the fat levels in the study biscuits were in line with a typical short dough shortcake biscuit where a commercial declaration per 100 g is 28.4 g fat and 13.6 g saturated fat.\n\nThis study used two approaches to micro-nutrient fortification. In both trials, the ONS version of the biscuit was fortified with 11 minerals and 13 vitamins compared with the control. The ONS version had approximately double the concentration of vitamins and minerals per 100 g when compared with 100 mL of a typical (average) ONS beverage. However, the small portion size (40 g) meant that one portion of ONS biscuits provided approximately 40% of an ONS 200 mL portion of vitamins and minerals (Table ); although the portion size was thought to be more likely to be consumed. The OP version during the first trial had fortified levels of iron (Fe) and vitamins riboflavin (B2), B6, folic acid (B9), vitamin D and, in the second trial, potassium, (K), magnesium (Mg) and zinc (Zn). These were justified based on the FSA guidelines8 as well as on the studies by Bates et al.18 and Russell and Suter10 (outlined in Table ). The aim of the OP biscuit version was to provide one-third of the daily requirements of micro-nutrients determined to be most necessary to fortify products for older people, assuming three servings of fortified biscuits would be provided to under-nourished patients per day. Table demonstrates that both ONS and OP versions of the oat biscuit were substantially higher in these required micro-nutrients than the control. However, as the acceptable portion size was small the proportion of RNI achieved was approximately one-fifth for the vitamins (17–20%) and one quarter for Fe and Zn (24%, 23%) rather than one-third. Levels of K and Mg were lower as initial screening trials found that higher levels led to an unacceptable taste. Therefore, the proportion of the daily RNI achieved for K and Mg were 7% and 9%, respectively (OP version).\n\nThe dairy flavour developed in all biscuits was attributed to the addition of WPI. The Trial 1 biscuits had dairy flavour mean values ranging from 25 to 31 out of 100 (data not shown). In Trial 2 the dairy note (described as milk powder flavour) was higher in the control than in the micro-nutrient fortified versions.\n\nAddition of vitamins and minerals caused some differences in the sensory characteristics of the micro-nutrient fortified biscuits; however, a consistent trend was not found across the two trials. An increase in bitter taste is likely to result from micro-nutrient fortification; this was found to be significant for the OP version of the biscuits in Trial 2 where potassium and magnesium enrichment was highest.\n\nThere were two main differences between the Trial 1 and Trial 2 biscuits; in the second trial vegetable fat was used rather than butter (leading to a higher level of total fat), and the biscuits were manufactured by a continuous pilot plant process rather than by the batch laboratory process. The change in process conditions might have led to further Maillard reaction which can be promoted by minerals and this may be responsible for the higher levels of burnt sugar flavour in the ONS and OP biscuits from the second trial. Cracked appearance was found to increase with mineral inclusion in Trial 1 but decreased with minerals in Trial 2; this may be due to batch to batch variation but may be dependent on aqueous to lipid phase ratio. In Trial 1 (lower fat than Trial 2) the minerals may have affected the rheology of the aqueous phase, changing dough structure and subsequent collapse sufficiently to increase surface cracking.\n\nThe addition of metal ions, such as iron, may have been responsible for the higher rancid odour noted in the Trial 1. Iron is a pro-oxidant and may also catalyse the oxidation of vitamins A and C.25–27 Addition of retinyl acetate and retinyl palmitate as vitamin A salts are effective at increasing baking and storage stability and addition of vitamin A salts have previously been found not to alter the colour and flavour of biscuits.28 However, taste, texture, appearance and overall acceptability may decrease as a function of storage.28,29 The ONS version of the biscuits contained vitamin A and antioxidant in the form of α-tocopherol (vitamin E) which the OP version did not. This might have reduced lipid oxidation compared to the OP version, although they were not significantly different from each other. Although differences in rancid fat flavour were not found in Trial 2 (vegetable fat used in place of butter), a shelf life study of the fortified biscuits should be carried out before commercialisation.\n\nOverall liking scores from the older consumers (n = 36, test 1; n = 20, test 2) for the fortified cookies ranged from 4.9 to 6.1 on a nine-point scale. Although significant differences were not found between the biscuits in test 1 with this number of older participants, the nine-point hedonic scale has previously been used successfully with an older-age cohort of this size to discriminate between liking of products30 and indeed the scale did lead to significant differences in test 2. The pilot plant product was out-performed by the commercial product in test 2. This might imply that the older consumers liked the ONS version of the oat biscuit less because they could detect negative attributes such as bitter and metallic taste or burnt sugar flavour, or that they did not like the dairy (milk powder) flavour in the trial biscuit that would not have been in the commercial product where no milk powders were added. It is not clear why the consumer group tasting the biscuits from the first trial scored the ONS version of the biscuit substantially higher in mean liking than a different consumer group scoring the same product formulation from the second trial (mean 6.1 compared to 4.9). It may be a difference between the two separate consumer groups, or half of the second group may have been influenced by the commercial cookie which they tasted first, or because the Trial 2 pilot plant produced ONS version was sensorially more different from the control than the batch produced biscuits in Trial 1 (Table ). However, in the first trial all biscuits contained the WPI and there were no differences in mean liking between the micro-nutrient fortified and control biscuits. Therefore, it is thought less likely that the micro-nutrient fortification was the main cause of lower liking score for the ONS version of the biscuit compared to the commercial biscuit in the second hedonic test. Although a significant difference in mean liking such as that found in test 2 (1.9 on a nine-point scale) might be expected to lead to a significant difference in consumption, this subject is not covered widely in the literature. Most studies with older cohorts have either investigated consumption or liking, but have not quantified whether a significant difference in liking leads to a significant difference in consumption.\n\nIn a study conducted by Ranhotra and co-workers, high protein (15.7 g 100 g−1) biscuits were developed. Product acceptability ratings were only carried out by eight assessors, resulting in mean scores of approximately 5 out of 9,31 similar to the liking scores recorded in the present study. In the Ranhotra study protein enrichment was achieved by addition of defatted soy flour and peanut butter. However, in the present study whey protein was incorporated as it is known to lead to more effective stimulation of muscle protein synthesis. A more recent study by Boobier et al.19 considered commercially manufactured biscuits enhanced with vitamins, but with lower protein content (6% w/w). A more limited range of micro-nutrients were used to fortify the biscuits than in the current study; however, the levels added were higher with one biscuit providing 92, 100, 174 and 135% of the UK RNI for vitamins C, B6, folic acid and B12, respectively. A consumer test (n = 25, student age group) found no difference in liking between fortified and non-fortified samples (mean liking scores 7.4 and 7.6, respectively, on a nine-point scale). It is, therefore, likely that the levels of these vitamins could be further increased in the present study without detriment to product acceptability. A current commercial breakfast oat biscuit (Belvita; Kraft Foods, Uxbridge, UK) has incorporated a range of cereals plus skimmed milk powder leading to a protein content of 8 g 100 g−1 (rather than >12 g 100 g−1 in the present study) and fortified the product with vitamins B1, B3, iron and magnesium at similar levels to biscuits in the present study."
