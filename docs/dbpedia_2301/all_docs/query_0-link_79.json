        "text": "On average, memory care facilities in Council Bluffs charge $5,815 per month for care. This is 7% more than the statewide average, and it exceeds the national norm of $5,625. Even so, many nearby cities have more economically priced care, including Waterloo, where rates are about $100 lower than in Council Bluffs, and Iowa City, where facilities charge $5,513 for dementia services. Additionally, memory care rates are comparatively competitive in Sioux City at 11% below Council Bluffsâ€™ norm, but in Des Moines, monthly care costs are higher at $6,004.\n\nNote: Residential memory care is usually offered in assisted living facilities, and in general, memory care rates tend to be 20-30% higher than assisted living rates. No national database currently tracks memory care costs in the United States, so we've estimated the monthly memory care costs listed below by adding 25% to the rates listed in Genworth's 2021 Cost of Care Survey.\n\nSeniors in Council Bluff pay $5,815 per month for residential memory care.\n\nWhile many families use their own funds or personal assets to pay for memory care, there are plenty of additional options to cover these costs. Some additional ways to finance memory care costs include:\n\nVeterans Benefits\n\nLife Insurance Policy\n\nLong-Term Care Insurance\n\nReverse Mortgage\n\nFor more information about different ways to finance memory care, visit our Memory Care in Iowa page.\n\nCouncil Bluffs seniors pay $5,815 for monthly memory care expenses, making this the second most expensive senior care type in the city. By comparison, seniors who arrange private services in their homes pay $5,529 for in-home care and home health care, and those without memory impairments pay $4,652 for assisted living. Adult day health care agencies charge even more competitive rates of $1,842, but nursing home care is expensive compared to memory support, exceeding monthly care costs by 28%.\n\nCouncil Bluffs and the surrounding area are home to numerous government agencies and non-profit organizations offering help for seniors searching for or currently residing in a memory care community. These organizations can also provide assistance in a number of other eldercare services such as geriatric care management, elder law advice, estate planning, finding home care and health and wellness programs.\n\nTo see a list of free memory care resources in Council Bluffs, please visit our Memory Care in Iowa page.\n\nThe Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing regulates memory care facilities in Council Bluff and the rest of Iowa. This department licenses memory care communities as assisted living programs and holds them to standard rules, as well as additional requirements for staffing, admission and discharge criteria and safety procedures."
