        "text": "The parties to this Settlement Agreement (“Agreement”) are the United States of America and the City of Council Bluffs, Iowa (“City”).\n\nThis matter originated with a complaint filed under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 as amended (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-4, and its implementing regulation, 28 C.F.R. pt. 35 (2014), with the United States Department of Justice (“United States”). The complaint alleges that the City discriminated against qualified individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs, by denying them on the basis of disability an opportunity to participate in and benefit from the services, programs, and activities at the Mid-America Center (“Center”).\n\nTitle II protects qualified individuals with disabilities from discrimination on the basis of disability in the benefits of the services, programs, and activities of State and local governments. 42 U.S.C. § 12132; 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(a).\n\nThe Attorney General is authorized under 28 C.F.R. pt. 35, subpt. F, to investigate alleged violations of Title II of the ADA and the Title II regulation and to determine whether the City complied with the ADA and regulation. The Attorney General is also authorized to issue findings, and, where appropriate, to negotiate informal resolution and voluntary compliance agreements. 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.172-173. Furthermore, the Attorney General is authorized under 42 U.S.C. § 12133 to bring a civil action enforcing Title II of the ADA.\n\nThe City owns the Center.\n\nThe ADA applies to the City because it is a “public entity” within the meaning of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12131, and 28 C.F.R. § 35.104. As a public entity, the City is subject to Title II of the ADA, and its implementing regulation, 28 C.F.R. pt. 35.\n\nFacilities constructed by a public entity must be designed and constructed to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities if the construction commenced after January 26, 1992, 28 C.F.R. § 35.151(a), and if construction commenced after July 26, 1992, but prior to September 15, 2010, then the facilities must comply with the 1991 ADA Standards for Accessible Design (“1991 ADA Standards”), 28 C.F.R. pt. 36, App. D; or the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (“UFAS”), 28 C.F.R. § 35.151(c)(1).\n\nIn 2011, the Department of Justice (“Department”) amended the Title II regulation, including adopting the new ADA Standards for Accessible Design (“2010 ADA Standards”). 28 C.F.R. § 35.151(c). The 2010 ADA Standards consist of the 2004 ADAAG and the requirements contained in 28 C.F.R. pt. 36, subpt. D. 28 C.F.R. § 36.104.\n\nNewly constructed facilities or elements that were constructed before March 15, 2012, and that do not comply with the 1991 ADA Standards or UFAS must be made accessible in accordance with the 2010 ADA Standards. 28 C.F.R. § 35.151(c)(5)(ii).\n\nThe 1991 ADA Standards specify the number of wheelchair seating spaces. For arenas with seating capacity over 500, the number of wheelchair spaces required is six (6), plus one (1) additional space for each total seating capacity increase of 100. 28 C.F.R. § 36.308(b); 1991 ADA Standards § 4.1.3(19)(a).\n\nThe 1991 ADA Standards sets out several separate requirements for the placement of wheelchair spaces. It requires that wheelchair seating locations “be an integrated part of the fixed seating plan.” It also requires that wheelchair areas “be provided so as to provide people with physical disabilities a choice of admission prices and lines of sight comparable to those for members of the general public.” This requires that wheelchair locations be dispersed around the facility. It also requires “at least one companion fixed seat be provided next to each wheelchair seating area.” 1991 ADA Standards §§ 4.33.1, 4.33.3.\n\nThe 1991 ADA Standards require that one percent (1%) of all fixed seats shall be aisle seats with no armrests on the aisle side, or removable or folding armrests on the aisle side, and signage at each such seating location. 1991 ADA Standards § 4.1.3(19)(a).\n\nThe 1991 ADA Standards specify the types and numbers of assistive listening systems required in assembly areas. The minimum number of assistive listening devices must be equal to four percent (4%) of the total number of seats, but never less than two devices. 1991 ADA Standards §§ 4.1.3(19)(b), 4.33.1, 4.33.7.\n\nA public entity must reasonably modify its ticketing policies, practices or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity. 28 C.F.R. § 35.138.\n\nII. FACTS\n\nA. Accessible Wheelchair and Companion Seating Locations\n\nThe Center was built after 1992, and opened in 2002, as a 30,000 square foot pillar free arena.\n\nThe Center is a multipurpose arena with up to 9,000 seats. This arena seats approximately 9,000 for concerts, 7,000 for basketball and 6,793 for hockey. This arena is also transformed to a theater-like environment with a floor–to-ceiling side-to-side curtain for capacities ranging from 3,000 to 6,000.\n\nThe City agrees that the Center must comply with the new construction requirements of Title II.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, the United States conducted a site inspection and survey of seating areas, club rooms, suites, and ticket policies. This Agreement is not intended to cover any other ADA or accessibility issues at the Center. The United States alleges that the City discriminated against individuals with disabilities on the basis of disability, by failing to:\n\ndesign and construct the Center to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities; and\n\nreasonably modify ticketing policies, practices, or procedures to ensure that individuals with disabilities have an equal opportunity to purchase tickets for accessible seating.\n\nThe United States alleges that the City has failed to provide accessible wheelchair locations for events, including ice and barrier (dasher board) events, except at the topmost and rear tier of the general seating area (22 rows up), in violation of the 1991 ADA Standards. The United States alleges that the City, in the placement of wheelchair locations, does not provide individuals with disabilities with a choice of admission prices and lines of sight comparable to those for members of the general public seated in club seating, in luxury suites, near the event floor, such as ice hockey seating, in violation of the ADA. 1991 ADA Standards\n\n§§ 4.1.3(19)(a), 4.33.1, 4.33.3.\n\nB. Arm rests and Armrest Signage\n\nThe United States alleges that the City has failed, in the general seating sections, luxury boxes, and club seat sections, to provide one percent of all fixed seats with aisle seats with no armrests on the aisle side, or removable or folding armrests on the aisle side, and signs at movable armrest seating locations in the suites, in violation of the ADA. 1991 ADA Standards § 4.1.3(19)(a).\n\nC. Suites\n\nThe United States alleges that the City fails to provide accessible wheelchair locations, accessible counters, and accessible tables at suites at the Center, in violation of the ADA. 1991 ADA Standards §§ 4.1.3(18), 4.1.3(19)(a), 4.33.3, 4.32, 4.32.1, 4.32.4.\n\nD. Assistive Listening Devices\n\nThe United States alleges that the City fails to provide the required number of assistive listening devices, which is equal to four percent (4%) of the total number of seats. 1991 ADA Standards § 4.1.3(19)(b), 4.33.1, 4.33.7.\n\nE. Ticketing\n\nThe United States alleges that the City has not made tickets available to individuals who request wheelchair seating locations in the same way as they are made available to others not requesting wheelchair seating locations, that accessible ticketing is not available on-line through ticketing websites, and that there is not selection of preferred seating locations available when making ticketing inquiries online or telephone. The United States alleges that the City has failed to reasonably modify its ticketing policies, practices and procedures when requested by persons who use wheelchairs to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, in violation of Title II of the ADA. 28 C.F.R. § 35.138.\n\nThe parties agree that it is in the parties’ best interest, and in the public interest, to address the allegations as set forth in this Agreement.\n\nIn consideration of the terms of this Agreement, the Attorney General agrees to refrain from undertaking further action in this matter, except as provided in Section V, Enforcement and Implementation, paragraph 43 (Enforcement).\n\nIII. Corrective Actions\n\nFor the purposes of this Agreement, the Parties agree to use the 2010 ADA Standards to remediate the alleged inaccessibility at the Center.\n\nIndependent Licensed Architect\n\nThe City will retain an Independent Licensed Architect (\"ILA\") knowledgeable about the architectural accessibility requirements of the ADA. This ILA, paid by the City without regard to outcome and pre-approved by the United States, must certify compliance with the applicable standard pursuant to 28 C.F.R. § 35.151(c) and the Appendix to 28 C.F.R. § 35.151(c) for (a) all of the modifications identified in Paragraphs 28 through 33 as remediation of the alleged violations identified in Paragraphs 19 through 22, and (b) any other alteration, addition, or modification made by the City to the Center during the term of this Agreement.\n\nIn issuing certifications pursuant to this Agreement, the ILA will prepare reports with photographs identifying that the alleged violation has been remediated and will use the certification form at Exhibit A. A separate report with pictures and a separate certification form will be used for the remediation of each alleged violation identified in Paragraphs 28-33 and any element that has been or will be altered pursuant to this Agreement. The ILA will be considered a neutral inspector for purposes of issuing certifications of compliance and will be available to the United States, with notice to the City, to discuss findings in the reports, photographs, and certifications. The United States may also, in its discretion and upon notice to the City, provide technical assistance to the ILA throughout the term of this agreement.\n\nThe City and the ILA will submit ILA certifications to the United States along with its reporting requirements as set forth in this Agreement.\n\nWheelchair and Companion Seating Locations.
