        "text": "Harris dismisses concerns over winning Black voters\n\nVice President Kamala Harris attempted to brush off concerns that President Joe Biden’s campaign is struggling to win Black voters, a key constituency behind his 2020 election win, but said the campaign will look to communicate policies championed by the Biden administration to those voters.\n\n“We’ve done really good work; our challenge will be to let people know who (brought) it to them,” Harris told ABC News in an interview airing Tuesday.\n\nEarlier this month, Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn told CNN he was “very concerned” about Biden’s standing with Black voters, acknowledging in an interview that the Biden campaign has not “been able to break through that MAGA wall in order to get to people exactly what this president has done.”\n\nHarris acknowledged that communicating that message to Black voters who might be inclined to sit out 2024 would pose a challenge.\n\nShe also hinted that the campaign will likely go on the offensive against former President Donald Trump as the 2024 general election ramps up in the coming weeks.\n\nDeSantis pledges to \"work hard\" in South Carolina and predicts winning delegates in Nevada\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Tuesday said South Carolina is an important state and and blasted former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley for “not competing” in Nevada.\n\nNevada’s Republican presidential caucuses will be held next month, weeks before the South Carolina GOP primary.\n\n“(South Carolina) is her home state; if she can’t win this, then I don’t see, you know, how she can say she’s going to win … on Super Tuesday or any of those other states,” DeSantis said.\n\nDeSantis said he would “work really hard” in South Carolina, a state where he acknowledges his campaign hasn’t spent a lot of money yet.\n\n“We’ve got a good footprint, But I think you’re gonna see us be present more, not just in terms of me being in the state more, but also terms of paid media, where we’re going to be able to tell our story,” he later told reporters in Columbia, South Carolina.\n\nHe argued that there’s “a lot of real estate between now and the South Carolina primary in terms of political time” that will allow narrative shifts in the race.\n\nView the 2024 election events calendar.\n\nSupporters line up in the snow for Trump’s return to New Hampshire\n\nHours before former President Donald Trump returns to New Hampshire, a line is already starting to form outside Atkinson Resort & Country Club.\n\nSome people were lined up just before 11 a.m. ET, and within an hour, that number had already grown to a few dozen.\n\nSupporters are bundled up as they wait to enter the venue. Temperatures have remained below freezing throughout the morning with a steady stream of snow, although temperatures are not nearly as record-breaking as they were in Iowa.\n\nTrump is scheduled to speak at 5 p.m. ET in his first visit to the Granite State after winning the Iowa caucuses on Monday night and making a stop in New York Tuesday to attend the opening of his second E. Jean Carroll defamation trial.\n\nDeSantis rips Haley for not committing to Thursday debate and says he’s \"the alternative\" to Trump\n\nIn his first campaign appearance post-Iowa, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis criticized 2024 opponent Nikki Haley in her home state for failing to commit to a debate in New Hampshire – a state he says she won’t win – though he wouldn’t explicitly say if he would beat her in South Carolina.\n\nDeSantis said the Iowa caucuses prove he is “the alternative” for voters seeking a different option than Donald Trump, not Haley, who he says won’t appeal to core conservative voters.\n\nDeSantis said this is something Haley can’t do.\n\nClaiming Haley doesn’t gaggle with press or take questions from voters, DeSantis said, “They basically have her hermetically sealed, because, you know, she’s got this problem with ballistic podiatry, shooting herself in the foot all the time.”\n\nHaley does take voter questions, though she does not gaggle as regularly as DeSantis on the trail.\n\n“That’s just not going to fly. We’re supposed to have a debate on WMUR on Thursday night. I committed to it. She now is saying she’s not going to debate, and I understand why,” DeSantis said.\n\n\"We can't go through 4 more years of chaos,\" Haley tells CNN in her post-Iowa pitch\n\nAfter coming in third in the Iowa caucuses, Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley is looking ahead to New Hampshire — where her support has grown dramatically — and arguing that she is a better candidate than former President Donald Trump because America “can’t go through four more years of chaos.”\n\nShe said reelecting Trump or President Joe Biden would mean America has “more of the same,” citing their age and investigations “that are distractions.”\n\nHaley also said she intends to accept debate invitations if Trump is on the stage. Earlier Tuesday, she said that the next debate she will participate in will be either with Trump or Biden.\n\n“There is nobody else I need to debate,” she said. “I have had five strong debates and have done plenty of them. He can’t hide forever. At some point, he’s got to get on a debate stage.”\n\nBiden campaign says Trump victory in Iowa reflects \"threat to our democracy\"\n\nThe Biden campaign on Tuesday starkly framed former President Donald Trump’s sweeping victory in Iowa as a “threat to our democracy” looking to “consolidate his power.”\n\nThe communications director for the Biden campaign, Michael Tyler, told CNN Tuesday that the Biden campaign will “have the message necessary to defeat Donald Trump,” pointing to abortion, health care, as well as the former president’s dictator comments.\n\nAsked to dig into the campaign’s takeaways on CNN entrance polling that suggested 65% of GOP caucus-goers in Iowa would still vote for Trump if convicted of a crime, and 31% would not, Tyler suggested it reflected both low turnout and Trump’s consolidation of his base.\n\n“Turnout wasn’t that high in Iowa, and what you saw was Donald Trump consolidates the extreme MAGA base in Iowa. The fact of the matter is, he is running, and all these candidates are running on an agenda that’s as dangerous as it is unpopular,” he said.\n\nHe pointed to the 2022 midterm elections and 2023 off-year election results as evidence of Americans rejecting that agenda.\n\nAsa Hutchinson suspends his presidential campaign\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson announced Tuesday he is suspending his presidential campaign after a weak showing in the Iowa caucuses on Monday night.\n\n“My message of being a principled Republican with experience and telling the truth about the current front runner did not sell in Iowa. I stand by the campaign I ran. I answered every question, sounded the warning to the GOP about the risks in 2024 and presented hope for our country’s future. Susan and I are blessed beyond measure, and we are grateful for the opportunity to have fought in the political arena for America,” he added.\n\nSununu expects \"strong second\" in New Hampshire for Haley\n\nNew Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu on Tuesday downplayed Nikki Haley’s third-place finish in Iowa and laid out an expectation for a “strong second” in New Hampshire — suggesting she could even surpass that and clinch the GOP primary on January 23.\n\nSununu, who endorsed Haley last month, told Fox News in an interview he didn’t think there was any “higher expectation” than Haley’s third-place finish in the Iowa caucuses.\n\n“She was challenging Ron (DeSantis) for second when Ron put everything he had into Iowa. Ron hasn’t been in New Hampshire in a month,” he said. He added that Haley is “challenging to actually beat Donald Trump” in the Granite State, where he claimed she was “within single digits.”\n\nAs Haley has tried to consolidate a broad anti-Trump coalition in New Hampshire, where undeclared voters can vote in the GOP primary, Sununu concurred that the number of Democrats who had changed their party registration by the October 6 deadline to be able to vote for a Republican was “not significant at all.”\n\nThe GOP presidential nomination and delegates, explained\n\nWinning individual primaries and caucuses is just one step in the long path to winning a party’s presidential nomination.\n\nHow does the Republican Party pick a presidential candidate, in a nutshell? Both parties hold conventions in the summer where delegates technically select the nominee. The process and rules are different for each party, but the primaries are about winning enough delegates to secure the nomination. There are different kinds of nominating contests and different kinds of delegates in a calendar that stretches from January to June, so keeping track of the delegate math can get complicated.\n\nWhat is a delegate? Performing well in primaries and caucuses equals delegates, and the larger goal is amassing the magic number of delegates to secure a nomination before delegate voting at the party convention.\n\nHow many delegates are there? Whoever wins the GOP nomination needs to win at least 1,215 out of 2,429 delegates awarded as part of the primary process. In years without an incumbent, like Republicans are experiencing in 2024, the winner frequently does not hit the magic number until May or even June. In 2016, in his first of three White House runs, Donald Trump hit the magic number on May 26.\n\nBut if Trump’s lead in polls holds up during early primaries, he could wrap things up much earlier.\n\nKeep reading here about how Republicans select their nominee.\n\nHaley argues she’s a \"stone’s throw\" from Trump in New Hampshire\n\nAfter coming in third place in the Iowa caucuses, Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley is looking ahead to New Hampshire, where she argues she’s a “stone’s throw away” from front-runner Donald Trump.\n\nHaley implied she wouldn’t make any major changes in her approach to campaigning, saying she would continue “doing what we’ve done for 11 months.”\n\n“It’s paid off. It’s why we’re a stone’s throw away from Trump,” in New Hampshire, she said.\n\nThe former South Carolina governor called her campaign the “last best hope of stopping the Trump-Biden nightmare.”\n\nCNN's Kaitlan Collins on Trump's victory remarks: He's celebrating because he hasn't had wins in a long time\n\nCNN’s Kaitlan Collins said that Donald Trump’s decision to thank his GOP rivals and strike a more unifying tone “speaks to how he feels after this victory tonight.”\n\n“I also think this is the speech that he’s giving after he has not had any wins in several years,” Collins said, noting she hasn’t heard a speech like this from Trump in “probably years.”\n\nCollins said she was struck by his notion of a united country, given the polarized environment.\n\n“It’s also because he has not had a win like that in so long. He is only dealing with criminal charges and civil suits in trials,” she said.\n\nSuper PAC aligned with DeSantis still evaluating how ground game worked in Iowa\n\nNever Back Down, the super PAC aligned with Gov. Ron DeSantis, is still evaluating how successful its much-touted ground game was tonight, according to CEO and chairman Scott Wagner.\n\nHe did not offer specifics when asked how the ground operation performed tonight only saying anyone who asked for help getting to caucus sites was accommodated.\n\nThe campaign was relying heavily on the organization put in place by Never Back Down to help the final vote totals during the caucuses.\n\nDeSantis will stay in the race, senior campaign official tells CNN\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis will remain in the 2024 race, a senior campaign official told CNN, saying he “earned his ticket out of Iowa.”\n\nNOW: Trump thanks \"great people of Iowa\" in remarks after projected win in caucuses\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is speaking from his campaign headquarters in Des Moines, Iowa, following his projected win in the state’s caucuses.\n\nEarlier this evening, CNN projected Trump winning the caucuses, solidifying his place as the front-runner for the 2024 Republican nomination as he attempts a historic political comeback nearly three years after leaving the White House in disgrace.\n\nTrump’s victory in this, his first election since losing to Joe Biden in 2020, put to bed any lingering questions about his hold over the GOP, the potency of his right-wing message and whether his legal troubles would hobble him with primary voters.\n\nMonday’s result also puts new pressure on Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley ahead of next week’s contest in New Hampshire, where Haley is hoping to impress among a more ideologically diverse electorate.\n\nIn his remarks, Trump congratulated his opponents, saying he thought DeSantis and Haley “both did very well.” He also praised Vivek Ramaswamy for doing a “hell of a job.”\n\n“They are very smart, very smart people, very capable people,” Trump said of his opponents.\n\nRead more about Trump’s victory in Iowa.\n\nCNN’s Gregory Krieg and Kristen Holmes contributed reporting to this post.\n\nThis post was updated with Trump’s comments tonight in Des Moines.\n\nDeSantis and Haley stuck in a close race for second place with more than 80% of vote counted\n\nWith more than 80% of the vote in, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley are in a tight race for second in the Iowa caucuses.\n\nDeSantis is currently in the second place spot with 21.2% of the vote. Haley is not far behind, with 19% of the vote.\n\nHaley campaign staying officially tight-lipped\n\nAs results pour in from the precincts across Iowa showing Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis battling for number two in Iowa, Haley’s campaign feels like things are pretty much where they expected them to be right now, according to a source close to the campaign.\n\nWhile Haley is huddling at her campaign headquarters in West Des Moines, the campaign is officially keeping tight lipped. They are not saying anything about the numbers that are coming in, or the CNN projection that former President Donald Trump will win the Iowa caucuses.\n\nAfter visiting multiple caucus locations, Haley was complimentary of the process underway, tweeting: “We’re getting to see democracy in action tonight!”\n\nDeSantis advisers hoping Trump dips below 50% and for separation with Haley for second\n\nThere are no televisions inside Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ caucus night watch party as supporters enjoy beer and wine and mingle amiably as country hits blare over the sound system.\n\nBut at the West Des Moines Sheraton hotel bar, where some of his top advisers and allies are sipping stiffer adult beverages watching results trickle in on a local television station, the mood is more dour.\n\n“It’s not good,” one close adviser said.\n\nThere are two numbers they are closely watching: The first is whether Donald Trump remains above 50%. If he does, it eliminates a narrative that a majority of Iowa Republicans wanted someone other than Trump.\n\nThe other number is the margin between DeSantis and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. A percentage point or two of separation — even if DeSantis comes in second — will make it difficult to convince donors of his path forward.\n\nHow CNN made its projection that Trump has won the Iowa caucuses\n\nFormer President Donald Trump will win the Iowa caucuses, CNN projected on Monday, solidifying his place as the front-runner for the 2024 Republican nomination.\n\nCNN’s projection was based on entrance polls conducted for the National Election Pool by Edison Research. These polls are carried out at a scientifically random sample of caucus sites across the state among voters who have shown up to participate.\n\nAs of 7 p.m. CT/8 p.m. ET, doors at caucus sites had closed and no one else would be allowed inside to participate, and entrance poll interviewing was complete.\n\nAt the time of CNN’s projection, at 7:30 p.m. CT/8:30 p.m. ET, the former president’s broad lead in the entrance poll’s representative sample was statistically significant. By that time, votes had been reported in multiple counties and from several sample precincts, which also suggested a broad Trump lead.\n\nOther major national news organizations projected Trump as the winner at roughly the same time as CNN.\n\nIt happened again — Trump GOP rivals split the vote\n\nIt happened again.\n\nThat’s the feeling of many Iowa Republicans who are watching Donald Trump’s decisive victory tonight who were hoping the state would slow his steady march to the nomination.\n\nGOP candidates Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley are locked in a fierce battle for second place, but if the overwhelming margin of victory holds, Trump is the biggest benefactor of the divided vote.\n\n“Does it even matter?” a top Iowa Republican told CNN. “Tonight is a Trump coronation.”\n\nEven with a far lower Iowa turnout than projected, Trump’s decision to amplify his Iowa investment is paying great dividends.\n\nIowa played its traditional role of winnowing the field. And perhaps crowning the Republican nominee. Trump is on his way to crushing two records: the 41% winning figure by George W. Bush and Bob Dole’s 13-point victory in 1988.\n\nRamaswamy softens Trump attacks in remarks directly after former president at Iowa caucus site\n\nIn remarks before Donald Trump’s projected win in Iowa, GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy notably softened his recent rhetoric differentiating himself from the former president in a pitch to the state’s voters at a caucus site tonight as he directly followed Trump onstage.\n\nRamaswamy attempted to portray himself as the voice of a new generation to voters from three precincts gathered at the Horizon Events Center in Clive, where Trump, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson also spoke. Ramaswamy notably did not mention Trump by name during his brief remarks but did say he plans to “respect my predecessor” as president.\n\n“I honor those who have come before me; I respect the heck out of them. I will respect their legacies and build on it because it’s the right thing to do for this country,” Ramaswamy, 38, told those gathered at the caucus site.\n\nIn recent days, Ramaswamy has offered a much sharper contrast to Trump, arguing the former president’s legal exposure and the intense political opposition he inspires makes his candidacy vulnerable. Those sharp distinctions drew Trump’s ire in the form a social media post in which he labeled Ramaswamy’s campaign “deceitful” and “very sly,” marking the first attacks toward Ramaswamy by Trump in the campaign.\n\nRamaswamy has largely been Trump’s most prominent defender throughout the campaign. He’s called Trump “the greatest president of the 21st century” and repeatedly defended the former president amid the multiple criminal indictments and ballot access challenges he faces.\n\nKey race alert: With 34% of the votes counted, DeSantis and Haley are in a tight race for 2nd place\n\nWith 34% of the Iowa caucus votes counted, former President Donald Trump continues to hold a commanding lead with 51.9% of the vote.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis keeps his second place spot with 20.7% of the vote, and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley holds on to third place with 19% of the caucus vote.\n\nEntrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has 7.7% of the vote, and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson has 0.2% of the vote.\n\nBiden campaign fundraising off Trump's projected caucus win\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s campaign is fundraising off of former President Donald Trump’s projected Iowa caucus win, warning of “vile attacks, endless lies, and massive spending” if Trump secures the Republican nomination for president.\n\nEarlier Monday, the Biden campaign announced raising $97 million over the fourth quarter of 2023, with $117 million cash on hand.\n\n“It means the Biden-Harris campaign is entering the election year with more cash on hand than any Democratic candidate in history at this point in the cycle and a significantly more cash than the $100 million Republicans have just hemorrhaged in Iowa alone fighting to out-MAGA one another,” Biden campaign co-chair Jeffrey Katzenberg told reporters in Des Moines on Monday.\n\nTrump reacts to being projected winner of Iowa caucuses: \"I am greatly honored”\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said he was “invigorated” and “greatly honored” after CNN projected he would win the Iowa caucuses.\n\n“I feel great,” Trump said in an interview with Fox News Digital. “I am greatly honored by such an early call.\n\n“It really is an honor that, minutes after, they’ve announced I’ve won — against very credible competition — great competition, actually,” Trump said.\n\nThe former president said, “It is a tremendous thing and a tremendous feeling.”\n\n620 trips in 365 days: Where the GOP candidates traveled in Iowa in the last year\n\nThe leading candidates in the Iowa caucuses held public events in the state more than 620 times in the last year.\n\nThey went where one might expect: The state’s population centers, according to a tally kept by the Des Moines Register.\n\nThe candidates held more than 110 events in Polk County, for example, which is home to Des Moines, the state’s most populous city and its capital.\n\nOthers topping the list were Linn (Cedar Rapids) and Scott (Davenport) counties. Donald Trump, the projected winner in Iowa, attended the least amount of public events in the state. This map shows the breakdown of all the events by county since January last year:\n\nGOP campaigns fielded calls from supporters unable to make it to caucus sites\n\nIn the final hours before the Iowa caucuses opened, the three leading Republican presidential campaigns were fielding calls from supporters who voiced concern about being able to make it to their voting precincts tonight.\n\nSnow-covered highways in southern Iowa — along with slick roads in some cul-de-sacs —were causing alarm.\n\nThose calls were animating the concern that Iowa Republican officials expressed earlier tonight to CNN about a lower-than-expected turnout. The projections are now far closer to the 2012 Iowa caucus turnout of 121,000 than the 186,000 tally from the 2016 campaign.\n\nIowa entrance polls show more than half of caucusgoers identify with MAGA movement and doubt Biden's victory\n\nMore than half of Republican caucusgoers in Iowa identify with the “MAGA movement,” and few are willing to acknowledge President Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory as legitimate, according to the initial results of CNN’s entrance poll for the Iowa Republican presidential caucuses.\n\nThe results provide a glimpse of the type of voters turning out to participate in the first contest of the 2024 campaign. Slightly about half identify themselves as part of the MAGA movement, “referring to the Make America Great Again” slogan popularized by former president Donald Trump in 2016. And about two-thirds say they do not believe that Biden’s victory over Trump four years ago was legitimate. There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election.\n\nFew GOP caucusgoers express concerns about the criminal charges Trump currently faces. Roughly 6 in 10 say that they’ll consider Trump fit for the presidency if he were to be convicted of a crime, with only about one-third saying they wouldn’t see him as fit in that circumstance.\n\nEntrance polls are a valuable tool to help us understand caucusgoers’ demographic profile and political views. Like all surveys, however, entrance polls are estimates, not precise measurements of the electorate. That’s particularly true for the preliminary set of entrance poll numbers, which don’t yet reflect the views of those who arrive later, and which haven’t yet been weighted to match the final results of the caucus. More enthusiastic and committed caucusgoers tend to show up earlier in the night, meaning that they may not be fully reflective of the overall electorate.\n\nThe entrance poll for Iowa’s Republican presidential caucus was conducted by Edison Research on behalf of the National Election Pool. It includes 311 interviews with Republican caucus participants across 45 different caucus locations. Results for the full sample have a margin of error of plus or minus 3.0 percentage points; it is larger for subgroups.\n\nScenes from a Story County elementary school, home tonight to 3 caucus precincts\n\nSawyer Elementary School in Ames is home, at least for this evening, to three Story County caucus precincts.\n\nCaucusgoers from Ames 12, 22 and 23 will gather in the school’s cafeteria and gymnasium to vote on their preferred candidate.\n\nThe caucus chair has voter registration files on hand, same-day registration forms on hand and also colored index cards which are the critical tool of the night. Each voter will get a blank colored index card (ranging in color from blue to yellow to pink) after they check-in. The precinct captain says this is the best way to make sure there’s no funny business. One vote per colored card and anything else doesn’t get counted.\n\nAmes, about 35 miles north of Des Moines, is a college town — home to Iowa State University. Ames Republicans are a mix of students and professionals. And more broadly, Story County Republicans are more moderate relative to outlying Iowa counties, according to the co-chair of the Story County GOP.\n\nMarco Rubio won the caucus in Story County in 2016. Donald Trump finished a distant 3rd.\n\nWhat does that mean for Trump, DeSantis and Haley this time? We will soon find out.\n\nTrump's robust Iowa ground game could preview general election strategy\n\nIf polls are accurate and former President Donald Trump wins Iowa by a historic margin Monday night, it will be largely in part due to the robust ground game that his team deployed in the Hawkeye State.\n\nUnlike the seat-of-the-pants operation of Trump’s 2016 campaign in the state when he lost to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, his current operation has built out a sophisticated system meant to expand the electorate to favor the former president.\n\nUsing data collected since his first trip to Iowa in 2015, Trump’s campaign contacted hundreds of thousands of Iowans, many of whom supported him in general elections but did not take part in the caucuses.\n\nThe Trump campaign recruited and trained roughly 2,000 volunteer caucus captains across the state – assigning several to the largest voting locations. Each agreed to get commitments from 10 first-time voters in the Iowa caucuses from a list of 25 prospective supporters the campaign had identified in their neighborhoods from their data.\n\nThey have held more than 300 caucus trainings and placed a special emphasis on educating supporters about how the caucus process works, including sending explainers in the mail, over text and by email. His team has started showing a two-minute video at every Iowa campaign event teaching people how to caucus.\n\nThis ground game strategy was a test run for a general election strategy should Trump be the nominee.\n\nIowa GOP officials project lower turnout\n\nIowa Republican officials are sounding the alarm about the prospect of lower-than-expected turnout at tonight’s caucuses, with snow- and ice-covered roads across southern Iowa and parts of eastern Iowa that could diminish participation.\n\nOne top GOP adviser tells CNN that the turnout of 2016 — 186,000 — “will almost certainly not be reached.” Fresh projections are closer to the 2012 campaign cycle turnout of 121,000.\n\nIn 28 of Iowa’s 99 counties, there is only one caucus locations, which means some voters will have to drive considerable distances. Tonight, Iowa’s geography will come into play, as the Trump campaign is hoping for a broad-based showing in rural areas, while Nikki Haley is focusing on suburban communities, with far less driving distance involved. Ron DeSantis is working toward a hybrid of both, putting his yearlong organization to a critical test.\n\nWill Trump hit 50%? Here's why reaching that threshold matters tonight\n\nIn several conversations with Republicans today, it’s clear the over/under for former President Donald Trump is 50%.\n\nIf he’s under 50, look for “other-than-Trumpers” to argue that means over one in two voters wants someone other than Trump.\n\nHis advisers here on the ground have been aggressively trying to lower expectations, especially amid the cold weather – many of Trump’s supporters live in rural areas where gravel roads have yet to be paved from the weekend’s blizzard; they also skew older, which is riskier in such cold; and many are first time caucus goers (and the greatest predictor of whether you’ll caucus is whether you’ve done it before).\n\nBUT BUT BUT – as we all know, Trump’s supporters are by far the most enthusiastic about their candidate, with many quoted as saying they’ll walk over glass (or pick your metaphor) to vote for him.\n\nThere are turnout concerns for rural areas of Pottawattamie County\n\nIn Pottawattamie County, there is concern about the turnout of caucusgoers from the rural areas due to the bitterly cold weather.\n\nPottawattamie County Caucus Chair Mary Ann Hanusa said she’s gotten calls from a few folks in rural parts who might be having trouble getting to the 40 precincts in the county.\n\nShe spoke to one woman in her 80s who can’t make it off her street because of the snow drifts – and is heartbroken that she’ll miss the first caucus of her life. Hanusa told CNN that organizers are trying to network, to offer people rides, but they’re not sure how much of that they’ll be able to facilitate.\n\nWhen it comes time to collect the votes, organizers will use two yellow popcorn buckets.\n\nDoors open at Iowa caucus sites\n\nThe doors are opening at Iowa caucus sites around the state as Iowans prepare to cast a vote for their choice to be the Republican party’s nominee for president.\n\nAnother voter, Karen, 65, said she has attended the Iowa caucuses every year since she was 18. Karen, who said she is “an anti-vaxxer,” said she plans to vote for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis because she agreed with his response to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAsked about why she came to caucus in record-cold temperatures, she said, “This is saving our nation right now.“\n\n“We need to make decisions in regard to the average working family to get ahead financially,” she said.\n\nHaley campaign volunteer tells CNN she embarked on a 34-hour journey to make it to Iowa\n\nAt caucus sites housed inside Grand View University’s Viking Theater and a nearby lecture hall, an estimated 300 Iowans are set to gather to cast their ballots in the first presidential contest of 2024.\n\nThe two precincts voting here are part of Polk County, which saw then-first-time candidate Trump take third. A prominent Iowa Republican said that if Nikki Haley has a shot to win any county in Iowa, it’s this one.\n\nHere’s one moment from inside the caucus site:\n\nAnalysis: Iowa caucuses are important — but they are far from being a guarantee of future success\n\nWinning the Iowa caucuses is an important marker and test of a candidate’s ability to organize. But it’s far from a guarantee of future success. Otherwise Pete Buttigieg, who won Iowa in 2020 in the Democratic caucuses, would be president instead of Joe Biden’s secretary of transportation. Or Ted Cruz, who won Iowa in the 2016 Republican caucuses, might be wrapping up his second term in the White House instead of running for reelection to the US Senate.\n\nNeither Cruz nor Buttigieg won their party’s nomination, much less the White House. The same is true of 2012 Iowa Republican caucuses winner Rick Santorum, the former Pennsylvania senator, and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who won in 2008. Both Huckabee and Santorum ran for president again in 2016, but neither could recreate their Iowa wins.\n\nOn the Republican side, Iowa caucusgoers have frequently rewarded candidates who appealed to socially conservative evangelical voters. Such socially conservative candidates have struggled in the next date on the election calendar: the New Hampshire primary.\n\nIn primaries, winning all of the early contests does not necessarily bode well in the general election, as former Vice President Al Gore and former President Gerald Ford found.\n\nSources close to Haley's campaign say it has met its goal in Iowa\n\nWin or lose, Nikki Haley’s campaign feels it has met its goals for Iowa, according to three sources close to the former South Carolina governor’s campaign.\n\nIf Haley comes in No. 2 in Iowa, she will have exceeded expectations, the sources said. But if she comes in No. 3, the campaign does not see that as damaging because it did not substantially invest in the state compared with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former President Donald Trump.\n\nBy contrast, the Haley campaign believes that both Trump and DeSantis have a tremendous amount on the line tonight.\n\nWhen it comes to DeSantis, the campaign points out that Iowa was as strong as it got for the Florida governor: He had the support of the state’s governor, one of Iowa’s most influential evangelical leaders, and the time to build a 99-county organization. When it comes to Trump, the campaign points out that he has promised to win the state by 60 points.\n\nAnd beyond Iowa, the Haley campaign also feels it is in a strong position in New Hampshire and South Carolina, while DeSantis cannot say the same.\n\nHarris says if Trump wins Iowa caucuses, \"we've beaten him before, and we'll beat him again\"\n\nVice President Kamala Harris told ABC News on Monday that she’s confident President Joe Biden’s campaign can beat whichever Republican candidate emerges from tonight’s Iowa Republican caucuses — be it former President Donald Trump or one of the other GOP candidates vying for the nomination.\n\nAsked while traveling in South Carolina whether she believes Trump — who holds a commanding lead in the polls — is a foregone conclusion, Harris told ABC, “I don’t know — but look, if it is Donald Trump, we’ve beaten him before, and we’ll beat him again.”\n\nThe vice president was also asked for her response to comments from Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley hitting at Biden’s age and suggesting that a GOP candidate is really running against the prospect of a possible Harris presidency.\n\nDeSantis knocks Trump for lack of support in Iowa from people who served in his administration\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis highlighted how people who have served or are currently serving in his administration have paid their way to Iowa to knock on doors on his behalf — something he says Donald Trump hasn’t matched.\n\nApplying that to his leadership, DeSantis assured Iowans they could trust him to build a strong administration to enact his vision if he becomes president.\n\n“Having the humility as a leader means you know it’s a team effort,” DeSantis said. “You need good people around you to put this into practice.”\n\n“Just seeing what’s happened in Iowa, you can have confidence that we’re going to be able to inspire people from all across this country because I’m not just going to recycle people from with inside Washington, DC, to be in these important positions,” DeSantis said.\n\nTrump's team tries to temper expectations ahead of Iowa caucuses\n\nDespite a series of polls that have former President Donald Trump leading by around 30 points, Trump’s team has spent the last few weeks tamping down expectations, insisting that a win with any margin over 12 points is worthy of celebration.\n\nFor months advisers have quietly said that they believe while Trump is going to win, the margins are likely closer than public poll numbers show; they have expressed concern that anything below 20 points will be viewed as disappointing at a time they are trying to build momentum heading into the primary season.\n\n“A win is a win,” one senior campaign adviser told CNN. However, in this case, not all wins are equal. Trump’s team is banking on a definitive win that not only sets the tone for the primary season, but curbs any momentum Trump’s GOP rivals, namely Nikki Haley, are experiencing ahead of New Hampshire. His advisers have been closely watching her rise in the polls and the campaign and super PAC are spending millions of dollars in the state on attack ads against the former South Carolina governor.\n\nTrump has privately expressed concern that weather will impact turnout on Monday night — and focused his final messaging on urging supporters not to get complacent and to show up no matter what.\n\nTrump’s campaign has said they are not worried about turnout — their internal polling mirrors public surveys that show Trump’s supporters have an enormous amount of enthusiasm and motivation going into Monday.\n\nDeSantis to make his final stop in Dubuque, a critical Iowa county to watch\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis will speak at two caucus sites in Dubuque, Iowa, tonight, a reminder that in politics — like real estate — location, location, location is always critical.\n\nDubuque County, in the northeast part of Iowa along the Mississippi River, will be a telling place to watch as the results come in.\n\nIowa has more counties that voted for Barack Obama and switched to Donald Trump than any other state. Dubuque County is one of those. In fact, Trump is the first Republican nominee to win the county in a presidential race since Dwight Eisenhower in 1956.\n\nSo tonight, the strength of Trump in Dubuque County — and the potential opening for his rivals – could be instructive to the outcome of the Iowa caucuses.\n\nFor these DeSantis volunteers, the trip to Iowa was long but worthwhile\n\nNathan and Olivia Becker of Beaverton, Oregon, made it to Iowa just in time to attend Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ final event on the eve of the Iowa caucuses, where he rallied supporters crowded into a packed event space in Ankeny.\n\nThe Oregon GOP primary isn’t until May 21, but the Beckers wanted to do what they could to boost support for the Florida governor ahead of the first nominating contest. So late last week, the couple and their two kids – ages three and eight months – traveled from their home outside Portland to Des Moines to volunteer for DeSantis ahead of caucus day.\n\nNathan, 37, said he’d been following DeSantis since he was first elected governor in 2018 and thought he was the most qualified candidate. He said he’s never voted for former President Donald Trump, whose behavior he finds “despicable.”\n\n“It’s just been really not something that we want to see or condone in any way,” he said. The couple said they hoped to avoid a rematch between President Joe Biden and Trump.\n\nIt was not an easy trip. The journey, complicated by winter weather, resembled the plot of the movie “Planes, Trains and Automobiles,” Nathan said. They spent a night in Denver with a relative after the second leg of their trip, to Des Moines, was canceled, then flew to Kansas City and drove three hours. Their luggage, with most of their winter clothing, went missing. After the Ankeny event they planned to head to Target.\n\nBut it was all worth it to help DeSantis, they said.\n\n“Nathan is viewing it as an investment,” Olivia said. “Hopefully, if DeSantis wins, interest rates will go down and we can buy a bigger house. And some school choice would be nice.”\n\nNathan said he would spend caucus day phone banking and doing whatever else the campaign needed. In the evening, he planned to drive his sister, who is eight and a half months pregnant, to her caucus site near Waterloo, Iowa.\n\nAsked about polling showing DeSantis fighting for a distant second place against Trump, Nathan said he was optimistic based on what he was hearing from people on the ground, the unpredictability of the turnout and what he knew about the strength of the campaign’s ground game. Olivia said that DeSantis winning would send an important message that Trump’s nomination isn’t inevitable.\n\n“We are hopeful,” she said. “I have not voted for a president since 2008, but I would vote for Ron DeSantis.”\n\nHaley says Americans want to talk about economy, \"not whether somebody's MAGA or not\"\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Nikki Haley on Monday argued Americans want to talk about the economy, not “whether somebody’s MAGA or not,” after former President Donald Trump accused her and fellow candidate Vivek Ramaswamy of not being part of his Make America Great Again movement.\n\nHaley continued, “That’s the whole problem with where we are in this country, it’s become too personal. Politics is not personal, it should be about policy.\n\nTrump said at a rally on Sunday that Haley was “really not much of a Republican,” and was “certainly not MAGA.” The former president also attacked Ramaswamy and said, “Vivek is not MAGA.”\n\nTrump attacks rivals on social media ahead of caucuses\n\nFormer President Donald Trump spent the morning ahead of Iowa caucuses attacking his GOP rivals on social media.\n\nIn a series of posts, Trump claimed that he was beating President Joe Biden in recent polls, while his opponents were “losing badly” to Biden, and alleged that the media was trying to promote Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley ahead of the caucuses.\n\nTrump also once again went after entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, saying a “vote for Vivek is a wasted vote” and accusing Ramaswamy of playing it “too cute” with Trump’s team.\n\nPrivately and publicly, Trump has been concerned about turnout Monday night, asking allies if they thought the weather would affect his ability to win by a definitive margin. Trump’s team, however, continues to insist that their internal data shows Trump’s base is motivated to turnout, no matter the conditions.\n\nIt's the Iowa Caucuses — not the Iowa Caucus — and here's why\n\nIt’s the Iowa caucuses – not the Iowa caucus.\n\nTonight, voters will gather in 1,657 separate precincts across Iowa for neighborhood meetings – or caucuses – to express their preference in the Republican presidential race. These gatherings are organized by the GOP, rather than state election officials, and will be held in about 730 different venues like schools, churches, community centers and libraries.\n\nThose two figures – 1,657 precincts, but 730 locations – are interesting and potentially important. Why? This year, many of the precinct meetings will be held in the same larger location – different rooms of a high school, for example – in consolidated super sites.\n\nIn 28 counties, of Iowa’s 99, there is only one caucus location. That means some voters will have to drive many miles to reach their destination. In rural Iowa, for example, a caucus site is likely to be much farther away than in the city or suburban areas.\n\nAs the dean of the Iowa press corps, O. Kay Henderson from Radio Iowa explained, those super sites could be significant.\n\nWe will find out tonight if those longer drives impacts turnout, given the frigid wind chills and snowy road conditions for much of the state.\n\nRamaswamy responds to Trump attacks and predicts \"shock\" results at caucuses\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy on Monday morning responded to criticism from former President Donald Trump, who called his campaign “deceitful.”\n\nRamaswamy, when asked by Fox News host Steve Doocy about Trump attacking his campaign Saturday, said, “Well I’ll tell you this is, you know, I took it in a lighthearted way. But the truth is, people have to have their head stuck in the snow not to see what’s happening on the ground here.”\n\nTrump issued his first criticism of Ramaswamy in a Truth Social post Saturday, saying Ramaswamy “started his campaign as a great supporter, ‘the best President in generations,’ etc. Unfortunately, now all he does is disguise his support in the form of deceitful campaign tricks.”\n\nRamaswamy told Doocy, “I know the mainstream media is ignoring it, but there has been a massive surge here late in the process. A number of endorsers who were widely expected to go to Donald Trump – legends in Iowa like former Congressman Steve King, widely expected to go for Trump, came for me, a number of the strongest constitutionalist conservatives have switched from the other candidates in the last 72 hours to me.”\n\nHe continued, “Steve Holt came from Ron DeSantis. And so, I think people who are actually on the ground are not blind to that reality. And I think the mainstream media, largely, for better or for worse, has been, which means I think we’re going to see a shock tonight.”\n\nRamaswamy also responded to praise from billionaire Elon Musk, saying, “I think he’s a smart guy, and look we’ll see what happens tonight. But one of the things is, I think the polls are dramatically off. Many of our supporters are first time caucus-goers, people who may have come from younger generations.”\n\nAnd he nodded to the frigid conditions facing Iowa voters tonight, “I think a lot of our supporters – we don’t have lukewarm supporters, Steve, we have diehard supporters. And I think that’s what’s going to be rewarded tonight as well.”\n\nDeSantis says Republican nominees will \"be apparent\" after tonight's results\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said the result from tonight’s Iowa caucuses will create a clear, binary choice for voters in the Republican primary.\n\n“I think people are going to say there’s only two possible nominees: Donald Trump or Governor DeSantis,” DeSantis told CNN’s Dana Bash at his campaign headquarters in Urbandale, Iowa.\n\n“We’re the only ones that have strong support amongst bedrock Republican conservative voters, and to win a Republican nomination, you have got to be able to do that. I think Iowa will show that very clearly,” he said.\n\n“A lot of these voters that are still undecided, it’s almost all decided between Trump or me in terms of what they’re doing, and I think that’s just kind of where the party is and I think that will be apparent,” DeSantis continued.\n\nIn the latest Des Moines Register/NBC News/Mediacom Iowa poll, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley sits in between Trump and DeSantis at 20%.\n\nDeSantis urged voters considering Haley to caucus for him, arguing “Nikki Haley could not possibly beat Donald Trump. She doesn’t have enough support amongst core conservatives.”\n\nTrump battles high expectations and complacency ahead of caucuses\n\nDonald Trump’s biggest competition on Monday entering the Iowa caucuses may be his own expectations, with the final Des Moines Register poll showing the former president with a 28-point lead over his nearest rival.\n\nAdvisers to the former president have tried to temper expectations in the days leading up to the caucuses, suggesting anything topping Bob Dole’s 1988 record-setting margin of nearly 13 points would be a major victory. Trump, however, faces a different standard. He’s a former president who has held a commanding lead from start-to-finish in Iowa and approached the nominating fight like an incumbent.\n\nThe final Des Moines Register/NBC News/Mediacom poll before the caucuses found that, overall, 48% of likely caucusgoers say Trump would be their first choice, while 20% name former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, and 16% Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, with the rest of the field below 10%.\n\nThe combination of Trump’s dominance in the polls and the dire weather forecast across Iowa also raises concerns about complacency on the part of the former president’s supporters. During one speech Sunday, Trump warned his supporters that, “even if you think we’re winning by a lot, it doesn’t matter, you have to get out and vote.”\n\nAt another event in Indianola, Trump said, “You can’t sit home. If you’re sick as a dog, you say, ‘Darling, I gotta make it.’ Even if you vote and then pass away, it’s worth it.”\n\nHaley expresses confidence Iowans will turn out for her\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Nikki Haley expressed confidence on Monday that Iowans would turn out and caucus for her today, despite the record breaking cold weather.\n\nShe said she’s hearing from her team on the ground that “people are determined to get out and vote,” despite the cold weather.\n\nAddressing recent polling that shows her beating President Joe Biden outside of the margin of error in a hypothetical general election matchup, Haley implied she would have “a double digit mandate going into DC.”\n\n“We can’t have a nail biter of election next November. If you elect me in this caucus today, I’ll be the one that defeats Joe Biden and we’ll get our country back on track,” she said.\n\nIowans weigh Trump's ongoing legal woes as they decide who to back in Monday's caucuses\n\nTeresa Garman has attended decades worth of Iowa caucuses, but views Monday’s meeting as the most consequential.\n\nDespite forecasts predicting negative temperatures, the 86-year-old Ames resident said the cold wouldn’t deter her from showing up to back Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis – even if she doesn’t think he’ll beat former President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump – and his myriad legal troubles – have loomed large over the GOP presidential primary, especially as Republicans in the Hawkeye State make their final decision on who to back in Monday night’s caucuses. Polls have shown the former president with a commanding lead over the field both in Iowa and nationally, even as he faces four indictments and awaits a Supreme Court decision over efforts to remove him from the ballot in Colorado.\n\nIn interviews, Iowans expressed an array of opinions on Trump’s legal problems, from anger over what they say they believe is a “witch hunt,” echoing the former president’s criticism, to a desire to move on and focus on issues plaguing the country.\n\nTrump’s rivals have taken different approaches to manage those views. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley refers to the “chaos” that follows the former president. DeSantis, who often says Trump “is running for his issues” while he runs on voters’ issues, has also argued the legal challenges would be a distraction in a general election.\n\nRead more about what Iowa voters are saying about Trump’s legal woes.\n\nBiden campaign watching Iowa \"closely\" as it prepares to take on Trump\n\nThe Biden campaign is looking ahead to a general election matchup with former President Donald Trump as the GOP primary season begins in earnest Monday.\n\nBiden campaign communications director Michael Tyler said the campaign was “excited for the fight ahead” and would be “watching closely to see what emerges here tonight in Iowa, ready to provide the American people with the stark contrast between the president, who’s fighting for more freedom and more democracy, and these MAGA extremists led by Donald Trump, who want to tear down the fabric of American democracy.”\n\nSpeaking during an appearance on “CNN This Morning” from Des Moines, Iowa, Tyler also echoed Biden and other top officials in casting the 2024 election as existential to the future of democracy, saying his team was “absolutely ready” to take on Trump if he wins as Republican nominee.\n\nTyler downplayed any anxiety when pressed by CNN’s Kasie Hunt on the write-in campaign in New Hampshire, where Biden’s name is not physically on the primary ballot next week due to his efforts to shift the Democratic calendar to place South Carolina first.\n\n“This campaign has made very clear that we’re gonna follow the rules put in place by the Democratic National Committee,” he said.\n\nHere's how 2024 Republicans spent more than $123 million on advertising in Iowa\n\nRepublican candidates and their allies have bombarded Iowa residents with more than $123 million in advertising, breaking the pace set during the 2020 caucuses.\n\nThe three leading Republican presidential candidates – Donald Trump, Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis – and their allied super PACs account for more than 70% of all the ad spending in Iowa since the start of 2023, which amounts to more than $90 million.\n\nThe $123 million in ad spending far outpaces the $84 million that campaigns and groups had spent on advertising ahead of the 2020 Iowa caucuses, when Democrats were battling to become their party’s standard-bearer.\n\nIn recent weeks, Haley and DeSantis – who are jockeying to emerge as the leading alternative to Trump, the Iowa polling front-runner – have pummeled one another on the airwaves with blistering ads that accuse their opponent of failing to confront the economic and national security threat posed by China and attacking their records as governor.\n\nAll the while, they’ve largely steered clear of targeting Trump.\n\nRead more about how Republicans and allies have bombarded Iowa residents with more than $123 million in advertising.\n\nAnalysis: How the Iowa caucuses became a chaotic start to 2024's political year\n\nThe storied history of the Iowa caucuses has never seen anything like this.\n\nA fateful election year likely to put the country’s institutions to an extreme test opens Monday as the first-in-the-nation state shivers under a blast of perishing polar weather.\n\nBut it’s not stopping Donald Trump from telling his voters to go out and caucus even if they’re “sick as a dog,” while urging them to punish enemies he branded “cheaters” and “liars.” The former president, who left office in disgrace in January 2021, is seeking a bumper win to set him on the road to a third straight GOP nomination — and a possible return to the White House.\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley wants a jolt of momentum ahead of next week’s New Hampshire primary – her best bet for a shock win over Trump. And Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is battling to keep his campaign alive.\n\nBut after months of polls, multimillion-dollar ad blitzes and a collision between an election and Trump’s legal morass, Iowans’ voices are the only ones that matter, although the weather may influence which of them is able to show up.\n\nRead more about Collinson’s analysis of the Iowa caucuses.\n\nHere are 5 things to keep an eye on in Iowa's Republican presidential caucuses\n\nIowa Republicans who are willing to brave record-low temperatures are set to kick off the party’s 2024 presidential nominating process with Monday night’s caucuses.\n\nThe Arctic cold largely froze the field in the race’s final days, with former President Donald Trump, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and others shortening their lists of scheduled events.\n\nNow, Iowa voters will render the first verdict of the 2024 election, weighing in on which Republican should take on President Joe Biden in November.\n\nWill Trump top 50%?\n\nThe big question about Trump’s performance isn’t just whether he will win — but whether he will do so in a fashion that demonstrates the GOP electorate has no appetite for a Trump alternative.\n\nThe race for second place\n\nThe most important question Monday night might be who finishes second — and whether that candidate does so in decisive fashion. National polls of likely Republican primary voters show Trump with the same commanding lead he’s held for months. But, even if it’s a long shot, a path for Haley to seriously challenge Trump has emerged in recent weeks: a win in New Hampshire, where a recent CNN poll showed her within single digits of the former president.\n\nDoes Iowa narrow the field?\n\nThe Iowa caucuses have a history of paring down both parties’ fields of presidential contenders. In 2012, former Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann dropped out after finishing sixth. In 2016, two former Iowa winners — former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee — exited after disappointing performances, as did Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul.\n\nHere’s what else to watch in Iowa’s Republican presidential caucuses.\n\nAhead of tonight's Iowa caucuses, poll shows Trump holds wide lead over GOP field\n\nFormer President Donald Trump holds a wide lead over his Republican presidential competitors among likely GOP caucusgoers in Iowa, the final Des Moines Register/NBC News/Mediacom before Monday’s caucuses found.\n\nOverall:\n\n48% of likely caucusgoers say Trump would be their first choice;\n\n20% name former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley;\n\n16% name Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis;\n\nAnd the rest of the field is below 10%.\n\nTrump stood at 51% in the December DMR/NBC poll and 43% in October, with his chief rivals in the teens in both of those prior polls.\n\nHaley’s numerical move to second place is within the margin of error. Neither her support nor DeSantis’ has changed significantly since the December poll, when DeSantis stood at 19% to Haley’s 16% in a survey with a 4.4 point error margin.\n\nHere’s what else to know about polling in Iowa.\n\nIowa GOP chair predicts \"robust\" turnout in Monday night's caucuses despite frigid temperatures\n\nIowa GOP chair Jeff Kaufmann on Sunday predicted that despite the forecasted subzero temperatures and parts of Iowa hit by a blizzard over the weekend, there will be a “robust turnout” on Monday night’s caucuses.\n\n“Temperatures are the least of my concern in terms of depressing turnout. Iowans know how to dress for that,” Kaufmann said, speaking to reporters at an event hosted Bloomberg in Des Moines.\n\n“From what I’m hearing, and what I’m seeing in the rallies…I think it’s going to be a robust turnout,” he added.\n\nKaufmann, who has not endorsed a candidate, said “complacency” is the “number one worry.”\n\nCandidates – including frontrunner former President Donald Trump – have urged their supporters to brave the cold and caucus for them.\n\n“Even if we did not have a poll where we have one of the one of the candidates way ahead, we always have to guard against complacency,” he said.\n\nThe severe weather conditions over the weekend forced the presidential hopefuls to either cancel events or switch to tele-town halls, creating a missed opportunity for candidates to connect in-person and deliver their closing message to undecided voters.\n\nThe Iowa caucuses are set to be the coldest on record — by a lot\n\nIowa will have their coldest caucuses ever on Monday, as a dangerous Arctic blast dives into the central US this weekend and last through early next week. Monday is expected to be the coldest January day for Iowa in at least five years, with wind chills as low as minus 40 Fahrenheit.\n\nIowans will wake up to temperatures more than 15 degrees below zero on Monday morning. Nearly the entire state will fail to climb above zero degrees Monday afternoon, the exception being the far southeastern portion of the state that may reach a degree or two above zero. This would be the first time since February of 2021 that the high temperature in Des Moines fails to reach zero degrees.\n\nAdd winds to this bitter cold and wind chill will reach life-threatening levels at minus 20 to minus 40 degrees for the entire day.\n\nThe forecast average daily temperature for Des Moines on Monday is minus 9.5 degrees, nearly 20 degrees colder than the previous coldest caucus night on January 19, 2004, when the average temperature was 9 degrees, according to CNN analysis of NWS data for Iowa caucuses. Iowa has held caucuses every four years since 1972 in either January or February.\n\nRecord-shattering cold caucuses will be in store for the rest of the state as well. Sioux City is forecast to average minus 10 degrees on Monday, more than 20 degrees colder than the 11 degree average for the caucus in 2004. Cedar Rapids is forecast to average minus 9 degrees and Davenport minus 8 degrees on Monday. Previous coldest caucuses there averaged 5.5 and 8 degrees respectively on January 24, 2000.\n\nAnalysis: Why Trump’s hold on evangelicals is so hard for DeSantis and Haley to break\n\nThe Iowa caucus on Monday will provide the first test of whether Donald Trump’s secret weapon in the 2016 GOP presidential nomination contest – his strong support among blue-collar evangelical Christians – is still working for him in 2024.\n\nAll signs suggest the answer is: yes.\n\nThe biggest surprise in Trump’s march to the nomination in 2016 was how many White evangelical Christians voted for a thrice-married casino-owning New Yorker who had previously expressed liberal views on social issues such as abortion. The key to Trump’s breakthrough among evangelical Christians was his commanding support among the members of that community without a college degree, who supported him then in much greater numbers than those with advanced education.\n\nThis time, the former president is running better in national polling than in the 2016 contest among virtually every major demographic group across the party. But blue-collar evangelicals could once again prove a crucial line of defense for Trump in the early states, including Iowa, where voters are more engaged in the race and the results will determine whether his remaining rivals can seriously threaten him for the nomination.\n\nAs Texas Sen. Ted Cruz did when he ran against Trump in the 2016 race, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has pinned his hopes this year largely on mobilizing Iowa’s large number of evangelical Christian conservatives. Like Cruz, DeSantis has staked out the far right flank on virtually every cultural issue in the race and made the case to evangelicals that they can’t trust Trump to deliver on the issues they care most about, including banning abortion and restricting options for transgender young people to participate in school sports or receive gender-affirming care. Late Friday night, DeSantis’ campaign announced he had obtained endorsements from 150 “faith leaders” across Iowa; many of the state’s most prominent social conservatives have rallied around him.\n\nKeep reading about Trump’s lead among evangelicals.\n\nMeet the GOP candidates vying to take on Biden in November\n\nThe Republican presidential candidates are all vying to take on President Joe Biden in November. But first, they’re competing in the GOP primaries and caucuses to emerge as the party’s nominee.\n\nTonight’s Iowa caucuses are the first test of the primary season — and an initial opportunity for Republicans to weigh in on whether they want former President Donald Trump to continue leading their party.\n\nHere are the 2024 Republican presidential candidates:\n\nFormer President Donald Trump launched his bid to reclaim the White House in November 2022, aiming to become only the second commander-in-chief to win two nonconsecutive terms as he faces multiple legal challenges. Trump continues to deny the outcome of the 2020 election he lost to Biden and promotes baseless conspiracy theories about election fraud. If he wins another term, Trump has said he would overhaul key factions of the federal government and slash social safety net programs.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, whose penchant for cultural clashes led him to declare his state as the place where “woke goes to die,” launched a bid for president in May 2023. DeSantis has said he is running to “reverse the decline” in America and to offer a new generation of leadership for the country.\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. and former UN ambassador Nikki Haley launched her presidential campaign in February 2023, calling for a new generation of leadership in the Republican Party. Her campaign has heavily focused on economic responsibility, national security and strengthening the southern border. If successful in the primary, Haley would be the first woman and the first Asian American nominated by the GOP for president.\n\nTech entrepreneur and author Vivek Ramaswamy launched his outsider campaign for the presidency in February 2023, focused on combatting “woke” ideology, exposing government corruption and ushering in a younger generation of voters into the Republican Party. Ramaswamy, 38, is the youngest candidate in the GOP field.\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson left office in January 2023 after two terms and announced his presidential campaign a few months later in April, seeking to “appeal to the best of America.” He calls for cutting federal spending and workforce, strong border security, reforms to federal law enforcement.\n\nRead more about the GOP candidates vying for the nomination."
