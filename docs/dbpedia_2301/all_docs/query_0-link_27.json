        "text": "Skip the trip at home\n\nStudents can take the web-based knowledge test that is required to obtain a driver’s instruction permit in the comfort of their own home. Your school does not need to participate in the skip the trip program to be able to do the home option.\n\nRequirements\n\nTo apply to take the test at home:\n\nThe student must be within 30 days of their 14th birthday and younger than 18.\n\nThe student will need an electronic device (not a phone or tablet) connected to the Internet.\n\nThe parent/guardian administering the test must have a valid Iowa driver's license.\n\nHow to take the test\n\nThe parent/guardian completes and submits the Application to Proctor Knowledge Exam form. Please allow 7-14 days to process your application.\n\nThe parent/guardian and student will receive an email with instructions for taking and administering the test. The link sent in the email will expire after 72 hours. If it expires, you will need to fill out the application to apply again.\n\nAfter the test is completed, the student will receive an email with the test results and instructions.\n\nAfter passing the test, make an appointment to come in to the DMV or a county treasurer's office to be issued the instruction permit. Build a customized list of the required documents necessary to receive your instruction permit.\n\nSkip the trip at a participating school\n\nSkip the Trip allows students to take the web-based knowledge test that is required to obtain a driver’s instruction permit at a participating schools or agency instead of making the trip to a DMV or local county treasurer’s office to complete the test. This allows students to take the test in a familiar and comfortable environment and saves parents and students time away from work or school by potentially reducing the number of trips to the DMV or local county treasurer’s office.\n\nRequirements\n\nBe enrolled with a participating school or agency. See the map below.\n\nHow it works\n\nOnce a student passes the knowledge test at their school, an email verifying their passing results will be sent the student.\n\nAfter passing the test, make an appointment to come in to the DMV or a county treasurer's office to be issued the instruction permit. Build a customized list of the required documents necessary to receive your instruction permit.\n\nIf your school is interested in participating in the Skip the Trip program please email SkipTheTrip.Support@iowadot.us."
