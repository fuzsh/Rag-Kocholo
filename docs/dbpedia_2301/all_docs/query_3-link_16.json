For other uses, see Iowa (disambiguation).\n\nState in the United States\n\nState symbols of IowaList of state symbolsBirdEastern goldfinchFlowerPrairie roseTreeBur OakRockGeodeState route markerState quarter\n\nReleased in 2004\n\nLists of United States state symbols\n\nIowa ( EYE-ə-wə)[6][7][8] is a doubly landlocked state in the upper Midwestern region of the United States. It borders the Mississippi River to the east and the Missouri River and Big Sioux River to the west; Wisconsin to the northeast, Illinois to the east and southeast, Missouri to the south, Nebraska to the west, South Dakota to the northwest, and Minnesota to the north.\n\nIowa is the 26th largest in total area and the 31st most populous of the 50 U.S. states, with a population of 3,190,369,[9] according to the 2020 census. The state's capital, most populous city, and largest metropolitan area fully located within the state is Des Moines. A portion of the larger Omaha, Nebraska, metropolitan area extends into three counties of southwest Iowa.[10] Iowa has been listed as one of the safest U.S. states in which to live.[11]\n\nDuring the 18th and early 19th centuries, Iowa was a part of French Louisiana and Spanish Louisiana; its state flag is patterned after the flag of France. After the Louisiana Purchase, settlers laid the foundation for an agriculture-based economy in the heart of the Corn Belt.[12] In the latter half of the 20th century, Iowa's agricultural economy began to transition to a diversified economy of advanced manufacturing, processing, financial services, information technology, biotechnology, and green energy production.[13][14]\n\nEtymology\n\n[edit]\n\nLike many other states, Iowa takes its name from its predecessor, Iowa Territory, whose name in turn is derived from the Iowa River, and ultimately from the ethnonym of the indigenous Ioway people. The Ioway are a Chiwere-speaking Siouan Nation, who were once part of the Ho-Chunk Confederation that inhabited the area now corresponding to several Midwest states. The Ioway were one of the many Native American nations whose territory comprised the future state of Iowa before the time of European colonization.[15]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: History of Iowa\n\nSee also: American Indians of Iowa\n\nPrehistory\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: Iowa archaeology and American Indians of Iowa\n\nWhen Indigenous peoples of the Americas first arrived in what is now Iowa more than 13,000 years ago, they were hunters and gatherers living in a Pleistocene glacial landscape. By the time European explorers and traders visited Iowa, Native Americans were largely settled farmers with complex economic, social, and political systems. This transformation happened gradually. During the Archaic period (10,500 to 2,800 years ago), Native Americans adapted to local environments and ecosystems, slowly becoming more sedentary as populations increased.[16]\n\nMore than 3,000 years ago, during the Late Archaic period, Native Americans in Iowa began utilizing domesticated plants. The subsequent Woodland period saw an increased reliance on agriculture and social complexity, with increased use of mounds, ceramics, and specialized subsistence. During the Late Prehistoric period (beginning about AD 900) increased use of maize and social changes led to social flourishing and nucleated settlements.[16]\n\nThe arrival of European trade goods and diseases in the Protohistoric period led to dramatic population shifts and economic and social upheaval, with the arrival of new tribes and early European explorers and traders. There were numerous native American tribes living in Iowa at the time of early European exploration. Tribes which were probably descendants of the prehistoric Oneota include the Dakota, Ho-Chunk, Ioway, and Otoe. Tribes which arrived in Iowa in the late prehistoric or protohistoric periods include the Illiniwek, Meskwaki, Omaha, and Sauk.[16]\n\nEarly colonization and trade, 1673–1808\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first known European explorers to document Iowa were Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet who traveled the Mississippi River in 1673 documenting several Indigenous villages on the Iowa side.[17][18] The area of Iowa was claimed for France and remained a French territory until 1763. The French, before their impending defeat in the French and Indian War, transferred ownership to their ally, Spain.[19] Spain practiced very loose control over the Iowa region, granting trading licenses to French and British traders, who established trading posts along the Mississippi and Des Moines Rivers.[17]\n\nIowa was part of a territory known as La Louisiane or Louisiana, and European traders were interested in lead and furs obtained by Indigenous people. The Sauk and Meskwaki effectively controlled trade on the Mississippi in the late 18th century and early 19th century. Among the early traders on the Mississippi were Julien Dubuque, Robert de la Salle, and Paul Marin.[17] Along the Missouri River at least five French and English trading houses were built before 1808.[20] In 1800, Napoleon Bonaparte took control of Louisiana from Spain in a treaty.[21]\n\nAfter the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, Congress divided the Louisiana Purchase into two parts—the Territory of Orleans and the District of Louisiana, with present-day Iowa falling in the latter. The Indiana Territory, created in 1800, exercised jurisdiction over this portion of the District; William Henry Harrison was its first governor. Much of Iowa was mapped by Zebulon Pike in 1805,[22] but it was not until the construction of Fort Madison in 1808 that the U.S. established tenuous military control over the region.[23]\n\nWar of 1812 and unstable U.S. control\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Missouri Territory\n\nFort Madison was built to control trade and establish U.S. dominance over the Upper Mississippi, but it was poorly designed and disliked by the Sauk and Meskwaki, many of whom allied with the British, who had not abandoned claims to the territory.[23][24] Fort Madison was defeated by British-supported Indigenous people in 1813 during the War of 1812, and Fort Shelby in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, also fell to the British. Black Hawk took part in the siege of Fort Madison.[25][26] Another small military outpost was established along the Mississippi River in present-day Bellevue. This poorly situated stockade was similarly attacked by hundreds of Indigenous people in 1813, but was successfully defended and later abandoned until settlers returned to the area in the mid-1830s.[27]\n\nAfter the war, the U.S. re-established control of the region through the construction of Fort Armstrong, Fort Snelling in Minnesota, and Fort Atkinson in Nebraska.[28]\n\nIndian removal, 1814–1832\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Indian removal\n\nThe United States encouraged settlement of the east side of the Mississippi and removal of Indians to the west.[29] A disputed 1804 treaty between Quashquame and William Henry Harrison (then governor of the Indiana Territory) that surrendered much of Illinois to the U.S. enraged many Sauk and led to the 1832 Black Hawk War.[30]\n\nThe Sauk and Meskwaki sold their land in the Mississippi Valley during 1832 in the Black Hawk Purchase[31] and sold their remaining land in Iowa in 1842, most of them moving to a reservation in Kansas.[30] Many Meskwaki later returned to Iowa and settled near Tama, Iowa; the Meskwaki Settlement remains to this day. In 1856 the Iowa Legislature passed an unprecedented act allowing the Meskawki to purchase the land.[32] However, in contrast to the unprecedented act of the Iowa Legislature, the United States Federal Government, through the use of Treaties, forced the Ho-Chunk from Iowa in 1848,[33] and forced the Dakota from Iowa by 1858.[34] Western Iowa around modern Council Bluffs was used as an Indian Reservation for members of the Council of Three Fires.[35]\n\nU.S. settlement and statehood, 1832–1860\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first American settlers officially moved to Iowa in June 1833.[36] Primarily, they were families from Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Indiana, Kentucky, and Virginia who settled along the western banks of the Mississippi River, founding the modern day cities of Dubuque and Bellevue.[36][37] On July 4, 1838, the U.S. Congress established the Territory of Iowa. President Martin Van Buren appointed Robert Lucas governor of the territory, which at the time had 22 counties and a population of 23,242.[38]\n\nAlmost immediately after achieving territorial status, a clamor arose for statehood. On December 28, 1846, Iowa became the 29th state in the Union when President James K. Polk signed Iowa's admission bill into law. Once admitted to the Union, the state's boundary issues resolved, and most of its land purchased from Natives, Iowa set its direction to development and organized campaigns for settlers and investors, boasting the young frontier state's rich farmlands, fine citizens, free and open society, and good government.[39]\n\nIowa has a long tradition of state and county fairs. The first and second Iowa State Fairs were held in the more developed eastern part of the state at Fairfield. The first fair was held October 25–27, 1854, at a cost of around $323. Thereafter, the fair moved to locations closer to the center of the state and in 1886 found a permanent home in Des Moines. The State Fair has been held annually since then, except for a few exceptions: 1898 due to the Spanish–American War and the World's Fair being held in nearby Omaha, Nebraska; from 1942 to 1945, due to World War II, as the fairgrounds were being used as an army supply depot; and in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.[40][41]\n\nCivil War, 1861–1865\n\n[edit]\n\nIowa supported the Union during the Civil War, voting heavily for Abraham Lincoln, though there was an antiwar \"Copperhead\" movement in the state, caused partially by a drop in crop prices caused by the war.[42] There were no battles in the state, although the Battle of Athens, Missouri, 1861, was fought just across the Des Moines River from Croton, Iowa, and shots from the battle landed in Iowa. Iowa sent large supplies of food to the armies and the eastern cities.[43]\n\nMuch of Iowa's support for the Union can be attributed to Samuel J. Kirkwood, its first wartime governor. Of a total population of 675,000, about 116,000 men were subjected to military duty. Iowa contributed proportionately more soldiers to Civil War military service than did any other state, north or south, sending more than 75,000 volunteers to the armed forces, over one-sixth of whom were killed before the Confederates surrendered at Appomattox.[43]\n\nMost fought in the great campaigns in the Mississippi Valley and in the South.[44] Iowa troops fought at Wilson's Creek in Missouri, Pea Ridge in Arkansas, Forts Henry and Donelson, Shiloh, Chattanooga, Chickamauga, Missionary Ridge, and Rossville Gap as well as Vicksburg, Iuka, and Corinth. They served with the Army of the Potomac in Virginia and fought under Union General Philip Sheridan in the Shenandoah Valley. Many died and were buried at Andersonville. They marched on General Nathaniel Banks' ill-starred expedition to the Red River. Twenty-seven Iowans have been awarded the Medal of Honor, the highest military decoration awarded by the United States government, which was first awarded in the Civil War.[45]\n\nIowa had several brigadier generals and four major generals—Grenville Mellen Dodge, Samuel R. Curtis, Francis J. Herron, and Frederick Steele—and saw many of its generals go on to state and national prominence following the war.[43]\n\nAgricultural expansion, 1865–1930\n\n[edit]\n\nFollowing the Civil War, Iowa's population continued to grow dramatically, from 674,913 people in 1860[46] to 1,624,615 in 1880.[47] The American Civil War briefly brought higher profits.[48]\n\nIn 1917, the United States entered World War I and farmers as well as all Iowans experienced a wartime economy. For farmers, the change was significant. Since the beginning of the war in 1914, Iowa farmers had experienced economic prosperity, which lasted until the end of the war.[48] In the economic sector, Iowa also has undergone considerable change. Beginning with the first industries developed in the 1830s,[49] which were mainly for processing materials grown in the area,[50] Iowa has experienced a gradual increase in the number of business and manufacturing operations.\n\nDepression, World War II and manufacturing, 1930–1985\n\n[edit]\n\nThe transition from an agricultural economy to a mixed economy happened slowly. The Great Depression and World War II accelerated the shift away from smallholder farming to larger farms, and began a trend of urbanization. The period after World War II witnessed a particular increase in manufacturing operations.[51]\n\nIn 1975, Governor Robert D. Ray petitioned President Ford to allow Iowa to accept and resettle Tai Dam refugees fleeing the Indochina War.[52] An exception was required for this resettlement as State Dept policy at the time forbid resettlement of large groups of refugees in concentrated communities; an exception was ultimately granted and 1200 Tai Dam were resettled in Iowa. Since then Iowa has accepted thousands of refugees from Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Bhutan, and Burma.[53]\n\nThe farm crisis of the 1980s caused a major recession in Iowa, causing poverty not seen since the Depression.[54] The crisis spurred a major, decade-long population decline.[55]\n\nReemergence as a mixed economy, 1985–present\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter bottoming out in the 1980s, Iowa's economy began to reduce its dependence on agriculture. By the early 21st century, it was characterized by a mix of manufacturing, biotechnology, finance and insurance services, and government services.[56] The population of Iowa has increased at a slower rate than the U.S. as a whole since at least the 1900 census,[57] though Iowa now has a predominantly urban population.[58] The Iowa Economic Development Authority, created in 2011 has replaced the Iowa Department of Economic Development and its annual reports are a source of economic information.[59]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Geography of Iowa\n\nBoundaries\n\n[edit]\n\nIowa is bordered by the Mississippi River on the east along with the Missouri River and the Big Sioux River on the west. The northern boundary is a line along 43 degrees, 30 minutes north latitude.[60][b] The southern border is the Des Moines River and a not-quite-straight line along approximately 40 degrees 35 minutes north, as decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in Missouri v. Iowa (1849) after a standoff between Missouri and Iowa known as the Honey War.[61][62]\n\nIowa is the only state whose east and west borders are formed almost entirely by rivers.[63] Carter Lake, Iowa, is the only city in the state located west of the Missouri River.[64]\n\nIowa has 99 counties, but 100 county seats because Lee County has two. The state capital, Des Moines, is in Polk County.[65]\n\nGeology and terrain\n\n[edit]\n\nIowa's bedrock geology generally decreases in age from east to west. In northwest Iowa, Cretaceous bedrock can be 74 million years old; in eastern Iowa Cambrian bedrock dates to c. 500 million years ago.[66] The oldest radiometrically dated bedrock in the state is the 2.9 billion year old Otter Creek Layered Mafic Complex. Precambrian rock is exposed only in the northwest of the state.[67]\n\nIowa can be divided into eight landforms based on glaciation, soils, topography, and river drainage.[68] Loess hills lie along the western border of the state, some of which are several hundred feet thick.[69] Northeast Iowa along the Upper Mississippi River is part of the Driftless Area, consisting of steep hills and valleys which appear as mountainous.[70]\n\nSeveral natural lakes exist, most notably Spirit Lake, West Okoboji Lake, and East Okoboji Lake in northwest Iowa (see Iowa Great Lakes). To the east lies Clear Lake. Man-made lakes include Lake Odessa,[71] Saylorville Lake, Lake Red Rock, Coralville Lake, Lake MacBride, and Rathbun Lake. Before European settlement, 4 to 6 million acres of the state was covered with wetlands, about 95% of these wetlands have been drained.[72]\n\nEcology and environment\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Environment of Iowa\n\nIowa's natural vegetation is tallgrass prairie and savanna in upland areas, with dense forest and wetlands in flood plains and protected river valleys, and pothole wetlands in northern prairie areas.[68] Most of Iowa is used for agriculture; crops cover 60% of the state, grasslands (mostly pasture and hay with some prairie and wetland) cover 30%, and forests cover 7%; urban areas and water cover another 1% each.[73]\n\nThe southern part of Iowa is categorized as the Central forest-grasslands transition ecoregion.[74] The Northern, drier part of Iowa is categorized as part of the Central tall grasslands.[75]\n\nThere is a dearth of natural areas in Iowa; less than 1% of the tallgrass prairie that once covered most of Iowa remains intact; only about 5% of the state's prairie pothole wetlands remain, and most of the original forest has been lost.[76] As of 2005 Iowa ranked 49th of U.S. states in public land holdings.[77] Threatened or endangered animals in Iowa include the interior least tern, piping plover, Indiana bat, pallid sturgeon, the Iowa Pleistocene land snail, Higgins' eye pearly mussel, and the Topeka shiner.[78] Endangered or threatened plants include western prairie fringed orchid, eastern prairie fringed orchid, Mead's milkweed, prairie bush clover, and northern wild monkshood.[79]\n\nThe explosion in the number of high-density livestock facilities in Iowa has led to increased rural water contamination and a decline in air quality.[80]\n\nOther factors negatively affecting Iowa's environment include the extensive use of older coal-fired power plants,[81] fertilizer and pesticide runoff from crop production,[82] and diminishment of the Jordan Aquifer.[83]\n\nThe 2020–2023 North American drought has affected Iowa particularly: As of January 2024, Iowa was in its 187th consecutive week of at least moderate drought, the longest stretch since the 1950s. 96% of areas are affected by drought.[84]\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Climate change in Iowa\n\nIowa has a humid continental climate throughout the state (Köppen climate classification Dfa) with extremes of both heat and cold. The average annual temperature at Des Moines is 50 °F (10 °C); for some locations in the north, such as Mason City, the figure is about 45 °F (7 °C), while Keokuk, on the Mississippi River, averages 52 °F (11 °C).[85] Snowfall is common, with Des Moines getting about 26 days of snowfall a year, and other places, such as Shenandoah getting about 11 days of snowfall in a year.[86]\n\nSpring ushers in the beginning of the severe weather season. As of 2008, Iowa averaged about 50 days of thunderstorm activity per year.[87] As of 2015, the 30-year annual average of tornadoes in Iowa was 47.[88] In 2008, twelve people were killed by tornadoes in Iowa, making it the deadliest year since 1968 and also the second most tornadoes in a year with 105, matching the total from 2001.[89]\n\nIowa summers are known for heat and humidity, with daytime temperatures sometimes near 90 °F (32 °C) and occasionally exceeding 100 °F (38 °C). Average winters in the state have been known to drop well below freezing, even dropping below −18 °F (−28 °C). As of 2018, Iowa's all-time hottest temperature of 118 °F (48 °C) was recorded at Keokuk on July 20, 1934, during a nationwide heat wave;[90] as of 2014, the all-time lowest temperature of −47 °F (−44 °C) was recorded in Washta on January 12, 1912.[91]\n\nMonthly normal high and low temperatures for various Iowa cities (°F)[92] City Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Davenport[93] 30/13 36/19 48/29 61/41 72/52 81/63 85/68 83/66 76/57 65/45 48/32 35/20 Des Moines[94] 31/14 36/19 49/30 62/41 72/52 82/62 86/67 84/65 76/55 63/43 48/31 34/18 Keokuk[95] 34/17 39/21 50/30 63/42 73/52 83/62 87/67 85/65 78/56 66/44 51/33 33/21 Mason City[96] 24/6 29/12 41/23 57/35 69/46 79/57 82/61 80/58 73/49 60/37 43/25 28/11 Sioux City[97] 31/10 35/15 47/26 62/37 73/49 82/59 86/63 83/63 76/51 63/38 46/25 32/13\n\nPrecipitation\n\n[edit]\n\nIowa has had a relatively smooth gradient of varying precipitation across the state; from 1961 to 1990, areas in the southeast of the state received an average of over 38 inches (97 cm) of rain annually, and the northwest of the state receiving less than 28 inches (71 cm).[98] The pattern of precipitation across Iowa is seasonal with more rain falling in the summer months. Virtually statewide, the driest month is January or February, and the wettest month is June owing to frequent showers and thunderstorms some of which produce hail, damaging winds or tornadoes. In Des Moines, roughly in the center of the state, over two-thirds of the 34.72 inches (88.2 cm) of rain falls from April through September, and about half the average annual precipitation falls from May through August peaking in June.[99]\n\nSettlements\n\n[edit]\n\nIowa's population is more urban than rural, with 61 percent living in urban areas in 2000, a trend that began in the early 20th century.[58] Urban counties in Iowa grew 8.5% from 2000 to 2008, while rural counties declined by 4.2%.[101] The shift from rural to urban has caused population increases in more urbanized counties such as Dallas, Johnson, Linn, Polk, and Scott, at the expense of more rural counties.[102]\n\nIowa, in common with other Midwestern states (especially Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota), is feeling the brunt of rural flight, although Iowa has been gaining population since approximately 1990. Some smaller communities, such as Denison and Storm Lake, have mitigated this population loss through gains in immigrant laborers.[103]\n\nAnother demographic problem for Iowa is the brain drain, in which educated young adults leave the state in search of better prospects in higher education or employment. During the 1990s, Iowa had the second highest exodus rate for single, educated young adults, second only to North Dakota.[104]\n\nIowa's largest cities and their surrounding areas\n\nRecorded by the United States Census Bureau Rank City 2020 city population[105] 2010 city population[106] Change Metropolitan Statistical Area 2020 metro population[107] 2010 metro population 2020 metro change 1 Des Moines 214,133 203,433 +5.26% Des Moines–West Des Moines 707,915 606,475 +16.73% 2 Cedar Rapids 137,710 126,326 +9.01% Cedar Rapids 273,885 257,940 +6.18% 3 Davenport 101,724 99,685 +2.05% Quad Cities 382,268 379,690 +0.68% 4 Sioux City 85,797 82,684 +3.76% Sioux City 144,996 143,577 +0.99% 5 Iowa City 74,828 67,862 +10.26% Iowa City 175,732 152,586 +15.17% 6 West Des Moines 68,723 56,609 +21.40% Des Moines–West Des Moines 7 Ankeny 67,887 45,582 +48.93% Des Moines–West Des Moines 8 Waterloo 67,314 68,406 −1.60% Waterloo–Cedar Falls 168,314 167,819 +0.29% 9 Ames 66,427 58,965 +12.65% Ames 124,514 115,848 +7.48% 10 Council Bluffs 62,799 62,230 +0.91% Omaha–Council Bluffs 954,270 865,350 +10.28% 11 Dubuque 59,667 57,637 +3.52% Dubuque 97,590 93,653 +4.20% 12 Urbandale 45,580 39,463 +15.50% Des Moines–West Des Moines 13 Marion 41,535 34,768 +19.46% Cedar Rapids 14 Cedar Falls 40,713 39,260 +3.70% Waterloo–Cedar Falls 15 Bettendorf 39,102 33,217 +17.72% Quad Cities\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nPopulation\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 184043,112—1850192,214345.8%1860674,913251.1%18701,194,02076.9%18801,624,61536.1%18901,912,29717.7%19002,231,85316.7%19102,224,771−0.3%19202,404,0218.1%19302,470,9392.8%19402,538,2682.7%19502,621,0733.3%19602,757,5375.2%19702,824,3762.4%19802,913,8083.2%19902,776,755−4.7%20002,926,3245.4%20103,046,3554.1%20203,190,3694.7%2023 (est.)3,207,0040.5%\n\nThe United States Census Bureau determined the population of Iowa was 3,190,369 on April 1, 2020, a 4.73% increase since the 2010 United States census.[108][109]\n\nOf the residents of Iowa, 70.8% were born in Iowa, 23.6% were born in a different U.S. state, 0.6% were born in Puerto Rico, U.S. Island areas, or born abroad to American parent(s), and 5% were foreign born.[110]\n\nImmigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 29,386 people, while migration within the country produced a net loss of 41,140 people. 6.5% of Iowa's population were reported as under the age of five, 22.6% under 18, and 14.7% were 65 or older. Males made up approximately 49.6% of the population.[111] The population density of the state is 52.7 people per square mile.[112] As of the 2010 census, the center of population of Iowa is in Marshall County, near Melbourne.[113] The top countries of origin for Iowa's immigrants in 2018 were Mexico, India, Vietnam, China and Thailand.[114]\n\nGermans are the largest ethnic group in Iowa. Other major ethnic groups in Iowa include Irish people and the British. There are also Dutch communities in state. The Dutch can be found in Pella, in the centre of the state, and in Orange City, in the northwest. There is a Norwegian community in Decorah in northeast Iowa; and there is Czech and Slovak communities in both Cedar Rapids and Iowa City. Smaller numbers of Greeks and Italians are scattered in Iowa's metropolitan areas. The majority of Hispanics in Iowa are Mexican. African Americans, who constitute around 2% of Iowa's population, didn't live in the state in any appreciable numbers until the early 20th century. Many blacks worked in the coal-mining industry of southern Iowa. Others blacks migrated to Waterloo, Davenport, and Des Moines, where the black population remained substantial in the early 21st century.[115] The African-American population in Des Moines experienced a significant increase with the establishment of the Colored Officers Training Camp at Fort Des Moines in 1917. Following the conclusion of World War I in 1918, numerous African-American families made the decision to remain in Des Moines. This marked the inception of a thriving community that eventually became a residence for numerous African-American leaders.[116]\n\nAs of the 2010 census, the population of Iowa was 3,046,355. The gender makeup of the state was 49.5% male and 50.5% female. 23.9% of the population were under the age of 18; 61.2% were between the ages of 18 and 64; and 14.9% were 65 years of age or older.[117]\n\nAccording to HUD's 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 2,419 homeless people in Iowa.[118][119]\n\nEthnic composition as of the 2020 census Race and Ethnicity[120] Alone Total White (non-Hispanic) 82.7% 82.7 85.9% 85.9 Hispanic or Latino[c] — 6.8% 6.8 African American (non-Hispanic) 4.1% 4.1 5.2% 5.2 Asian 2.4% 2.4 3.0% 3 Native American 0.3% 0.3 1.4% 1.4 Pacific Islander 0.2% 0.2 0.3% 0.3 Other 0.3% 0.3 1.0% 1\n\nIowa historical racial composition Racial composition 1990[121] 2000[122] 2010[123] 2020[124] White 96.6% 93.9% 91.3% 84.5% Black or African American 1.7% 2.1% 2.9% 4.1% Native American 0.3% 0.3% 0.4% 0.5% Asian 0.9% 1.3% 1.7% 2.4% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander — — 0.1% 0.2% Other race 0.5% 1.3% 1.8% 2.8% Two or more races — 1.1% 1.8% 5.6%\n\nAccording to the 2016 American Community Survey, 5.6% of Iowa's population were of Hispanic or Latino origin (of any race): Mexican (4.3%), Puerto Rican (0.2%), Cuban (0.1%), and other Hispanic or Latino origin (1.0%).[125] The five largest ancestry groups were: German (35.1%), Irish (13.5%), English (8.2%), American (5.8%), and Norwegian (5.0%).[126]\n\nBirth data\n\n[edit]\n\nNote: Births in table don't add up, because Hispanics are counted both by their ethnicity and by their race, giving a higher overall number.\n\nLive births by single race/ethnicity of mother Race 2013[127] 2014[128] 2015[129] 2016[130] 2017[131] 2018[132] 2019[133] 2020[134] 2021[135] 2022[136] Non-Hispanic White 32,302 (82.6%) 32,423 (81.7%) 32,028 (81.1%) 31,376 (79.6%) 30,010 (78.1%) 29,327 (77.6%) 29,050 (77.2%) 27,542 (76.3%) 28,167 (76.5%) 27,527 (75.4%) Black 2,232 (5.7%) 2,467 (6.2%) 2,597 (6.6%) 2,467 (6.3%) 2,657 (6.9%) 2,615 (6.9%) 2,827 (7.5%) 2,685 (7.4%) 2,567 (7.0%) 2,562 (7.0%) Asian 1,353 (3.5%) 1,408 (3.5%) 1,364 (3.4%) 1,270 (3.2%) 1,321 (3.4%) 1,176 (3.1%) 1,106 (2.9%) 1,067 (2.9%) 1,055 (2.9%) 1,032 (2.8%) Native American 269 (0.7%) 284 (0.7%) 242 (0.6%) 147 (0.4%) 311 (0.8%) 152 (0.4%) 308 (0.8%) 143 (0.4%) 129 (0.3%) 459 (1.3%) Hispanic (of any race) 3,175 (8.1%) 3,315 (8.3%) 3,418 (8.6%) 3,473 (8.8%) 3,527 (9.2%) 3,694 (9.8%) 3,695 (9.8%) 3,725 (10.3%) 3,903 (10.6%) 4,172 (11.4%) Total Iowa 39,094 (100%) 39,687 (100%) 39,482 (100%) 39,403 (100%) 38,430 (100%) 37,785 (100%) 37,649 (100%) 36,114 (100%) 36,835 (100%) 36,506 (100%)\n\nSince 2016, data for births of White Hispanic origin are not collected, but included in one Hispanic group; persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race.\n\nReligion\n\n[edit]\n\nA 2014 survey by Pew Research Center found 60% of Iowans are Protestant, while 18% are Catholic, and 1% are of non-Christian religions. 21% responded with non-religious, and 1% did not answer.[138][139] A survey from the Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA) in 2010 found that the largest Protestant denominations were the United Methodist Church with 235,190 adherents and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America with 229,557. The largest non-Protestant religion was Catholicism with 503,080 adherents. The state has a great number of Calvinist denominations. The Presbyterian Church (USA) had almost 290 congregations and 51,380 members followed by the Reformed Church in America with 80 churches and 40,000 members, and the United Church of Christ had 180 churches and 39,000 members.[140] According to the 2020 Public Religion Research Institute's study, 26% of the population were irreligious.[141]\n\nThe study Religious Congregations & Membership: 2000[142] found in the southernmost two tiers of Iowa counties and in other counties in the center of the state, the largest religious group was the United Methodist Church; in the northeast part of the state, including Dubuque and Linn counties (where Cedar Rapids is located), the Catholic Church was the largest; and in ten counties, including three in the northern tier, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America was the largest. The study also found rapid growth in Evangelical Christian denominations. Dubuque is home to the Archdiocese of Dubuque, which serves as the ecclesiastical province for all three other dioceses in the state and for all the Catholics in the entire state of Iowa.\n\nHistorically, religious sects and orders who desired to live apart from the rest of society established themselves in Iowa, such as the Amish and Mennonite near Kalona and in other parts of eastern Iowa such as Davis County and Buchanan County.[143] Other religious sects and orders living apart include Quakers around West Branch and Le Grand, German Pietists who founded the Amana Colonies, followers of Transcendental Meditation who founded Maharishi Vedic City, and Order of Cistercians of the Strict Observance monks and nuns at the New Melleray and Our Lady of the Mississippi Abbeys near Dubuque.\n\nBy 1878, approximately 1000 Jewish people lived in Iowa, many of whom were immigrants from Poland and Germany.[144][145] As of 2016 about 6,000 Jews live in Iowa, with about 3,000 of them in Des Moines.[146]\n\nLanguage\n\n[edit]\n\nEnglish is the most common language in Iowa, being the sole language spoken by 91.1% of the population. Less common languages include sign language and indigenous languages. About 2.5% of the general population use sign language as of 2017, while indigenous languages are spoken by about 0.5% of the population.[147] William Labov and colleagues, in the monumental Atlas of North American English[148] found the English spoken in Iowa divides into multiple linguistic regions. Natives of northern Iowa—including Sioux City, Fort Dodge, and the Waterloo region—tend to speak the dialect linguists call North Central American English, which is also found in North and South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Natives of central and southern Iowa—including such cities as Council Bluffs, Davenport, Des Moines, and Iowa City—tend to speak the North Midland dialect also found in eastern Nebraska, central Illinois, and central Indiana.[149] Natives of East-Central Iowa—including cities such as Cedar Rapids, Dubuque, and Clinton tend to speak with the Northern Cities Vowel Shift, a dialect that extends from this area and east across the Great Lakes Region.[150]\n\nAfter English, Spanish is the second-most-common language spoken in Iowa, with 120,000 people in Iowa of Hispanic or Latino origin and 47,000 people born in Latin America.[151] The third-most-common language is German, spoken by 17,000 people in Iowa; two notable German dialects used in Iowa include Amana German spoken around the Amana Colonies, and Pennsylvania German, spoken among the Amish in Iowa. The Babel Proclamation of 1918 banned the speaking of German in public. Around Pella, residents of Dutch descent once spoke the Pella Dutch dialect.\n\nAttractions\n\n[edit]\n\nCentral Iowa\n\n[edit]\n\nAmes is the home of Iowa State University, the Iowa State Center, and Reiman Gardens.\n\nDes Moines is the largest city and metropolitan area[e] in Iowa and the state's political and economic center.

Scored in 10 individual categories, Iowa was ranked first when it came to the \"Cost of Doing Business\"; this includes all taxes, utility costs, and other costs associated with doing business. Iowa was also ranked 10th in \"Economy\", 12th in \"Business Friendliness\", 16th in \"Education\", 17th in both \"Cost of Living\" and \"Quality of Life\", 20th in \"Workforce\", 29th in \"Technology and Innovation\", 32nd in \"Transportation\" and the lowest ranking was 36th in \"Access to Capital\".[159]\n\nWhile Iowa is often viewed as a farming state, agriculture is a relatively small portion of the state's diversified economy, with manufacturing, biotechnology, finance and insurance services, and government services contributing substantially to Iowa's economy.[56] This economic diversity has helped Iowa weather the late 2000s recession better than most states, with unemployment substantially lower than the rest of the nation.[160][161]\n\nIf the economy is measured by gross domestic product, in 2005 Iowa's GDP was about $124 billion.[162] If measured by gross state product, for 2005 it was $113.5 billion.[163] Its per capita income for 2006 was $23,340.[163] On July 2, 2009, Standard & Poor's rated Iowa's credit as AAA (the highest of its credit ratings, held by only 11 U.S. state governments).[164]\n\nAs of September 2021, the state's unemployment rate is 4.0%.[165]\n\nManufacturing\n\n[edit]\n\nManufacturing is the largest sector of Iowa's economy, with $20.8 billion (21%) of Iowa's 2003 gross state product. Major manufacturing sectors include food processing, heavy machinery, and agricultural chemicals. Sixteen percent of Iowa's workforce is dedicated to manufacturing.[56] Food processing is the largest component of manufacturing. Besides processed food, industrial outputs include machinery, electric equipment, chemical products, publishing, and primary metals. Companies with direct or indirect processing facilities in Iowa include ConAgra Foods, Wells Blue Bunny, Barilla, Heinz, Tone's Spices, General Mills, and Quaker Oats. Meatpacker Tyson Foods has 11 locations, second only to its headquarter state Arkansas.[166]\n\nMajor non-food manufacturing firms with production facilities in Iowa include 3M,[167] Arconic,[168] Amana Corporation,[169] Emerson Electric,[170] The HON Company,[171] SSAB,[172] John Deere,[173] Lennox Manufacturing,[174] Pella Corporation,[175] Procter & Gamble,[176] Vermeer Company,[177] and Winnebago Industries.[178]\n\nAgriculture\n\n[edit]\n\nIndustrial-scale, commodity agriculture predominates in much of the state. Iowa's main conventional agricultural commodities are hogs, with about 22.6 million hogs in 8,000 facilities large enough to require manure management plans in March 2018, outnumbering Iowans by more than 7 to 1,[179] corn, soybeans, oats, cattle, eggs, and dairy products. Iowa is the nation's largest producer of ethanol and corn and some years is the largest grower of soybeans. In 2008, the 92,600 farms in Iowa produced 19% of the nation's corn, 17% of the soybeans, 30% of the hogs, and 14% of the eggs.[180] As of 2009 major Iowa agricultural product processors included Archer Daniels Midland, Cargill, Inc., Diamond V Mills, and Quaker Oats.[181]\n\nDuring the 21st century Iowa has seen growth in the organic farming sector. Iowa ranks fifth in the nation in total number of organic farms. In 2016, there were about 732 organic farms in the state, an increase of about 5% from the previous year, and 103,136 organic acres, an increase of 9,429 from the previous year.[182][183] Iowa has also seen an increase in demand for local, sustainably-grown food. Northeast Iowa, part of the Driftless Area, has led the state in development of its regional food system and grows and consumes more local food than any other region in Iowa.[184][185]\n\nIowa's Driftless Region is also home to the nationally recognized Seed Savers Exchange, a non-profit seed bank housed at an 890-acre heritage farm near Decorah, in the northeast corner of the state.[186][187] The largest nongovernmental seed bank of its kind in the United States, Seed Savers Exchange safeguards more than 20,000 varieties of rare, heirloom seeds.[188]\n\nAs of 2007, the direct production and sale of conventional agricultural commodities contributed only about 3.5% of Iowa's gross state product.[190] In 2002 the impact of the indirect role of agriculture in Iowa's economy, including agriculture-affiliated business, was calculated at 16.4% in terms of value added and 24.3% in terms of total output. This was lower than the economic impact of non-farm manufacturing, which accounted for 22.4% of total value added and 26.5% of total output.[191]\n\nHealth insurance\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 2014, there were 16 organizations offering health insurance products in Iowa, per the State of Iowa Insurance Division.[192] Iowa was fourth out of ten states with the biggest drop in competition levels of health insurance between 2010 and 2011, per the 2013 annual report on the level of competition in the health insurance industry by the American Medical Association[193] using 2011 data from HealthLeaders-Interstudy, the most comprehensive source of data on enrollment in health maintenance organization (HMO), preferred provider organization (PPO), point-of-service (POS) and consumer-driven health care plans.[194] According to the AMA annual report from 2007 Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield had provided 71% of the state's health insurance.[195]\n\nThe Iowa Insurance Division \"Annual report to the Iowa Governor and the Iowa Legislature\" from November 2014 looked at the 95% of health insurers by premium, which are 10 companies. It found Wellmark Inc. to dominate the three health insurance markets it examined (individual, small group and large group) at 52–67%.[196]: 2 Wellmark HealthPlan of Iowa and Wellmark Inc had the highest risk-based capital percentages of all 10 providers at 1158% and 1132%, respectively.[196]: 31 Rising RBC is an indication of profits.[196]: 31\n\nOther sectors\n\n[edit]\n\nIowa has a strong financial and insurance sector, with approximately 6,100 firms,[56] including AEGON, Nationwide Group, Aviva USA, Farm Bureau Financial Services, GreatAmerica Financial Services, Voya Financial, Marsh Affinity Group, MetLife, Principal Financial Group, Principal Capital Management, Wells Fargo, and Greenstate Credit Union (formerly University of Iowa Community Credit Union).\n\nIowa is host to at least two business incubators, Iowa State University Research Park and the BioVentures Center at the University of Iowa.[197] The Research Park hosts about 50 companies, among them NewLink Genetics, which develops cancer immunotherapeutics, and the U.S. animal health division of Boehringer Ingelheim, Vetmedica.[197]\n\nEthanol production consumes about a third of Iowa's corn production, and renewable fuels account for eight percent of the state's gross domestic product. A total of 39 ethanol plants produced 3.1 billion US gallons (12,000,000 m3) of fuel in 2009.[198]\n\nRenewable energy has become a major economic force in northern and western Iowa, with wind turbine electrical generation increasing exponentially since 1990.[14] In 2019, wind power in Iowa accounted for 42% of electrical energy produced, and 10,201 megawatts of generating capacity had been installed at the end of the year.[199] Iowa ranked first of U.S. states in percentage of total power generated by wind and second in wind generating capacity behind Texas.[199] Major producers of turbines and components in Iowa include Acciona Energy of West Branch, TPI Composites of Newton, and Siemens Energy of Fort Madison.\n\nIn 2016, Iowa was the headquarters for three of the top 2,000 companies for revenue.[200] They include Principal Financial, Rockwell Collins, and American Equity Investment.[201][202][203] Iowa is also headquarters to other companies including Hy-Vee, Pella Corporation, Workiva, Vermeer Company, Kum & Go gas stations, Von Maur, Pioneer Hi-Bred, and Fareway.[204][205][206][207][208][209][210]\n\nGambling in the state is a major section of the Iowa tourism industry.[211]\n\nTaxation\n\n[edit]\n\nTax is collected by the Iowa Department of Revenue.[212]\n\nIowa imposes taxes on net state income of individuals, estates, and trusts. There are nine income tax brackets, ranging from 0.36% to 8.98%, as well as four corporate income tax brackets ranging from 6% to 12%, giving Iowa the country's highest marginal corporate tax rate.[213] The state sales tax rate is 6%, with non-prepared food having no tax.[214] Iowa has one local option sales tax that may be imposed by counties after an election.[215] Property tax is levied on the taxable value of real property. Iowa has more than 2,000 taxing authorities. Most property is taxed by more than one taxing authority. The tax rate differs in each locality and is a composite of county, city or rural township, school district and special levies. Iowa allows its residents to deduct their federal income taxes from their state income taxes.[216]\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nPrimary and secondary schools\n\n[edit]\n\nIowa was one of the leading states in the high school movement, and continues to be among the top educational performers today.[217]\n\nThe four-year graduation rate for high schoolers was 91.3% in 2017.[218] Iowa's schools are credited with the highest graduation rate in the nation as of 2019.[219] Iowa has 333 school districts,[218] 1,329 school buildings and has the 14th lowest student-to-teacher ratio of 14.2.[220] Teacher pay is ranked 22nd, with the average salary being $55,647.[220]\n\nAs of 2015 transportation spending is a significant part of the budgets of rural school districts as many are geographically large and must transport students across vast distances. This reduces the amount of money spent on other aspects of the districts.[221]\n\nThe state's oldest functioning school building is located in Bellevue in the historic Jackson County Courthouse which has been in continuous use as a school since 1848.[222]\n\nColleges and universities\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Iowa Board of Regents is composed of nine citizen volunteers appointed by the governor to provide policymaking, coordination, and oversight of the state's three public universities, two special K–12 schools, and affiliated centers.[223]\n\nThe special K–12 schools include the Iowa School for the Deaf in Council Bluffs and the Iowa Braille and Sight Saving School in Vinton.[223] Both Iowa State University and The University of Iowa are research universities[224] with The University of Iowa also being a member of the prestigious Association of American Universities.[225] In addition to the three state universities, Iowa has multiple private colleges and universities.\n\nTransportation\n\n[edit]\n\nInterstate highways\n\n[edit]\n\nIowa has four primary interstate highways. Interstate 29 (I-29) travels along the state's western edge through Council Bluffs and Sioux City. I-35 travels from the Missouri state line to the Minnesota state line through the state's center, including Des Moines. I-74 begins at I-80 just northeast of Davenport. I-80 travels from the Nebraska state line to the Illinois state line through the center of the state, including Council Bluffs, Des Moines, Iowa City, and the Quad Cities. I-380 is an auxiliary Interstate Highway, which travels from I-80 near Iowa City through Cedar Rapids ending in Waterloo and is part of the Avenue of the Saints highway. Iowa is among the few jurisdictions where municipalities install speed cameras on interstate highways providing a substantial revenue source from out of state drivers.[226]\n\nAirports with scheduled flights\n\n[edit]\n\nIowa is served by several regional airports including the Des Moines International Airport, the Eastern Iowa Airport, in Cedar Rapids, Quad City International Airport, in Moline, Illinois, and Eppley Airfield, in Omaha, Nebraska. Smaller airports in the state include the Council Bluffs Municipal Airport, Davenport Municipal Airport (Iowa), Dubuque Regional Airport, Fort Dodge Regional Airport, Mason City Municipal Airport, Sioux Gateway Airport, Southeast Iowa Regional Airport, and Waterloo Regional Airport.[227]\n\nRailroads\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: List of Iowa railroads\n\nAmtrak's California Zephyr serves southern Iowa with stops in Burlington, Mount Pleasant, Ottumwa, Osceola, and Creston along its route between Chicago and Emeryville, California.[228] Fort Madison is served by Amtrak's Southwest Chief, running between Chicago and Los Angeles.[229] Both provide daily service through the state.\n\nPublic Transit\n\n[edit]\n\nIowa is served by a number of local transit providers including Bettendorf Transit, Cambus, Cedar Rapids Transit, Clinton Municipal Transit Administration, Coralville Transit, Cyride, Davenport Citibus, Des Moines Area Regional Transit, Iowa City Transit, The Jule, Mason City Transit, MET Transit, Omaha Metro Transit, Ottumwa Transit Authority, Quad Cities MetroLINK and Sioux City Transit.\n\nIntercity bus service in the state is provided by Burlington Trailways, Greyhound Lines, and Jefferson Lines.\n\nLocal transit map\n\nLaw and government\n\n[edit]\n\nState\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 2022 , the 43rd and current Governor of Iowa is Kim Reynolds (R).

Incumbent U.S. Representatives Leonard Boswell (D) and Tom Latham (R) ran against each other in 2012 in the third congressional district which had new boundaries; Latham won and retired after the 2014 elections. King represented the old fifth congressional district.\n\nPolitical parties\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Iowa, the term \"political party\" refers to political organizations which have received two percent or more of the votes cast for president or governor in the \"last preceding general election\". Iowa recognizes three political parties—the Republican Party, the Democratic Party, and the Libertarian Party.[230] The Libertarian Party obtained official political party status in 2017 as a result of presidential candidate Gary Johnson receiving 3.8% of the Iowa vote in the 2016 general election.[231] Third parties, officially termed \"nonparty political organizations\", can appear on the ballot as well. Four of these have had candidates on the ballot in Iowa since 2004 for various positions: the Constitution Party, the Green Party, the Pirate Party, and the Socialist Workers Party.[232][233]\n\nVoter trends\n\n[edit]\n\nUnited States presidential election results for Iowa[234] Year Republican / Whig Democratic Third party(ies) No. % No. % No. % 2020 897,672 53.09% 759,061 44.89% 34,138 2.02% 2016 800,983 51.15% 653,669 41.74% 111,379 7.11% 2012 730,617 46.18% 822,544 51.99% 29,019 1.83% 2008 682,379 44.39% 828,940 53.93% 25,804 1.68% 2004 751,957 49.90% 741,898 49.23% 13,053 0.87% 2000 634,373 48.22% 638,517 48.54% 42,673 3.24% 1996 492,644 39.92% 620,258 50.26% 121,173 9.82% 1992 504,891 37.27% 586,353 43.29% 263,363 19.44% 1988 545,355 44.50% 670,557 54.71% 9,702 0.79% 1984 703,088 53.27% 605,620 45.89% 11,097 0.84% 1980 676,026 51.31% 508,672 38.60% 132,963 10.09% 1976 632,863 49.47% 619,931 48.46% 26,512 2.07% 1972 706,207 57.61% 496,206 40.48% 23,531 1.92% 1968 619,106 53.01% 476,699 40.82% 72,126 6.18% 1964 449,148 37.92% 733,030 61.88% 2,361 0.20% 1960 722,381 56.71% 550,565 43.22% 864 0.07% 1956 729,187 59.06% 501,858 40.65% 3,519 0.29% 1952 808,906 63.75% 451,513 35.59% 8,354 0.66% 1948 494,018 47.58% 522,380 50.31% 21,874 2.11% 1944 547,267 51.99% 499,876 47.49% 5,456 0.52% 1940 632,370 52.03% 578,800 47.62% 4,260 0.35% 1936 487,977 42.70% 621,756 54.41% 33,000 2.89% 1932 414,433 39.98% 598,019 57.69% 24,235 2.34% 1928 623,570 61.77% 379,311 37.57% 6,608 0.65% 1924 537,458 55.02% 160,382 16.42% 278,930 28.56% 1920 634,674 70.91% 227,921 25.46% 32,487 3.63% 1916 280,439 54.25% 221,699 42.89% 14,806 2.86% 1912 119,805 24.33% 185,325 37.64% 187,226 38.03% 1908 275,209 55.62% 200,771 40.58% 18,789 3.80% 1904 308,158 63.39% 149,276 30.71% 28,659 5.90% 1900 307,808 58.04% 209,265 39.46% 13,282 2.50% 1896 289,293 54.42% 233,741 43.97% 8,513 1.60% 1892 219,795 49.60% 196,367 44.31% 26,997 6.09% 1888 211,603 52.36% 179,877 44.51% 12,655 3.13% 1884 197,089 52.25% 177,316 47.01% 2,796 0.74% 1880 183,904 56.99% 105,845 32.80% 32,919 10.20% 1876 171,326 58.50% 112,121 38.28% 9,431 3.22% 1872 131,566 60.81% 71,189 32.90% 13,610 6.29% 1868 120,399 61.92% 74,040 38.08% 0 0.00% 1864 88,500 64.12% 49,525 35.88% 0 0.00% 1860 70,302 54.61% 55,639 43.22% 2,798 2.17% 1856 45,073 48.83% 37,568 40.70% 9,669 10.47% 1852 15,856 44.84% 17,763 50.23% 1,745 4.93% 1848 9,930 44.59% 11,238 50.46% 1,103 4.95%\n\nAs a result of the 2010 elections, each party controlled one house of the Iowa General Assembly: the House had a Republican majority, while the Senate had a Democratic majority. As a result of the 2016 elections, Republicans gained control of the Senate. Incumbent Democratic governor Chet Culver was defeated in 2010 by Republican Terry Branstad, who had served as governor from 1983 to 1999. On December 14, 2015, Branstad became the longest serving governor in U.S. history, serving (at that time) 20 years, 11 months, and 3 days; eclipsing George Clinton, who served 21 years until 1804.[235] Lieutenant Governor Kim Reynolds succeeded him on May 24, 2017, following Branstad's appointment as U.S. Ambassador to China.\n\nParty registration as of August 1, 2024[236] Party Total voters Percentage Republican 782,120 35.24% No affiliation 767,887 34.60% Democratic 648,707 29.23% Other 20,478 0.92% Total 2,219,192 100.00%\n\nPresidential caucus\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Iowa caucuses\n\nThe state gets considerable attention every four years because the Iowa caucus, gatherings of voters to select delegates to the state conventions, is the first presidential caucus in the country. The caucuses, held in January or February of the election year, involve people gathering in homes or public places and choosing their candidates, rather than casting secret ballots as is done in a presidential primary election.[237] Along with the New Hampshire primary the following week, Iowa's caucuses have become the starting points for choosing the two major-party candidates for president.[238] The national and international media give Iowa and New Hampshire extensive attention, which gives Iowa voters leverage.[239] In 2007 presidential campaign spending was the seventh highest in the country.[240]\n\nCivil rights\n\n[edit]\n\nIn a 2020 study, Iowa was ranked as the 24th easiest state for citizens to vote in.[241]\n\nRacial equality\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the 19th century Iowa was among the earliest states to enact prohibitions against race discrimination, especially in education, but was slow to achieve full integration in the 20th century. In the first decision of the Iowa Supreme Court—In Re the Matter of Ralph,[242] decided July 1839—the Court rejected slavery in a decision that found a slave named Ralph became free when he stepped on Iowa soil, 26 years before the end of the Civil War.[243] The state did away with racial barriers to marriage in 1851, more than 100 years before the U.S. Supreme Court would ban miscegenation statutes nationwide.[244]\n\nThe Iowa Supreme Court decided Clark v. The board of directors[245] in 1868, ruling that racially segregated \"separate but equal\" schools had no place in Iowa, 85 years before Brown v. Board of Education.[243] By 1875, a number of additional court rulings effectively ended segregation in Iowa schools.[246] Social and housing discrimination continued against Blacks at state universities until the 1950s.[247] The Court heard Coger v. The North Western Union Packet Co.[248] in 1873, ruling against racial discrimination in public accommodations 91 years before the U.S. Supreme Court reached the same decision.[243]\n\nIn 1884, the Iowa Civil Rights Act apparently outlawed discrimination by businesses, reading: \"All persons within this state shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the accommodations, advantages, facilities, and privileges of inns, restaurants, chophouses, eating houses, lunch counters, and all other places where refreshments are served, public conveyances, barber shops, bathhouses, theaters, and all other places of amusement.\" However, the courts chose to narrowly apply this act, allowing de facto discrimination to continue.[249] Racial discrimination at public businesses was not deemed illegal until 1949, when the court ruled in State of Iowa v. Katz that businesses had to serve customers regardless of race; the case began when Edna Griffin was denied service at a Des Moines drugstore.[250] Full racial civil rights were codified under the Iowa Civil Rights Act of 1965.[251]\n\nWomen's rights\n\n[edit]\n\nAs with racial equality, Iowa was a vanguard in women's rights in the mid-19th century, but did not allow women the right to vote until the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified in 1920, Iowa legislature being one of the ratifying votes.[252] In 1847, the University of Iowa became the first public university in the U.S. to admit men and women on an equal basis.[253] In 1869, Iowa became the first state in the union to admit women to the practice of law, with the Court ruling women may not be denied the right to practice law in Iowa and admitting Arabella A. Mansfield to the practice of law.[243] Several attempts to grant full voting rights to Iowa women were defeated between 1870 and 1919. In 1894 women were given \"partial suffrage\", which allowed them to vote on issues, but not for candidates. It was not until the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment that women had full suffrage in Iowa.[254] Although Iowa supported the Federal Equal Rights Amendment, in 1980 and 1992 Iowa voters rejected an Equal Rights Amendment to the state constitution.[255] Iowa added the word \"women\" to the Iowa Constitution in 1998. After the amendment, it reads: \"All men and women are, by nature, free and equal, and have certain inalienable rights—among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty, acquiring, possessing and protecting property, and pursuing and obtaining safety and happiness.\"[256]\n\nIn May 2018 Iowa signed into law one of the country's most restrictive abortion bans: the requirement that a doctor cannot perform an abortion if they can detect a fetal heartbeat, which in many cases would restrict abortions pregnancies less than six weeks old.[257] It was struck down in January 2019, when an Iowa state judge ruled that the \"fetal heartbeat\" law was unconstitutional.[258]\n\nLGBT rights\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: LGBT rights in Iowa\n\nThe state's law criminalizing same-sex sexual activity was repealed in June 1976, 27 years before Lawrence v. Texas. In 2007, the Iowa Legislature added \"sexual orientation\" and \"gender identity\" to the protected classes listed in the Iowa Civil Rights Act.[259]\n\nOn April 3, 2009, the Iowa Supreme Court decided Varnum v. Brien,[260] holding in a unanimous decision,[261] the state's law forbidding same-sex marriage was unconstitutional. This made Iowa the third state in the U.S. and first in the Midwest to permit same-sex marriage.[262][263]\n\nCulture\n\n[edit]\n\nArts\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Clint Eastwood movie The Bridges of Madison County, based on the popular novel of the same name, took place and was filmed in Madison County.[264] What's Eating Gilbert Grape, based on the Peter Hedges novel of the same name, is set in the fictional Iowa town of Endora. Hedges was born in West Des Moines.[265]\n\nDes Moines is home to members of the heavy metal band Slipknot. The state is mentioned in the band's songs, and the album Iowa is named after the state.[266]\n\nSports\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Sports teams from Iowa\n\nThe state has four major college teams playing in NCAA Division I for all sports.
