I called multiple places in search of food, all leaving me feeling frustrated. Someone suggested I call 211, and in doing so all my feelings of frustration were solved. The 211 representative was very compassionate and provided me with expert knowledge on how I could get in contact with Meals on Wheels – I finally wasn’t worrying about if I was going to have access to a hot meal every day. I cannot express my gratitude enough to the employees at 211, you can tell they genuinely want to provide their callers with help and will stop at nothing to do so.\"\n\n– 211 Caller from Lucas County\n\n“People need 211. It could be your co-worker, your own child. It could be you. Just know there’s a place that can help.”\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nIs there a cost for dialing 211?\n\nCalling 211 from a landline is free. Most cell phone carriers have made 211 calling available to their customers. Organizations and hospitals have to incorporate 211 into their phone system.\n\nWho is listed in the 211 Iowa Database?\n\nTo be listed, nonprofits and government agencies must meet set criteria, and provide free or subsidized health and human services to Iowa residents.

A call specialist will ask for a ZIP code to locate services closest to the home of the person seeking help.
