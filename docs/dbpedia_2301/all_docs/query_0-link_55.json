        "text": "Council Bluffs Residential Internet Coverage\n\nThe medium size city of Council Bluffs is the seventh largest city in Iowa. It's an economically diverse area with both blue- and white-collar workers. Residents are middle income and well-educated. They count on their internet services to pursue educational and career goals. Although just 79% of Iowa has access to high-speed internet, 97% of Council Bluffs can connect to these services.\n\nConnection options for Council Bluff residents are quite limited. CenturyLink is the sole DSL provider in the area and Cox Communications is the only cable internet provider. They both reach 97% Council Bluff residents. Fiber optics have not reached the area, but residents can also opt for satellite internet from HughesNet.\n\nIn addition to the services offered to residents, 1% businesses in Council Bluffs can connect to fiber optics from Level 3 Communications.\n\nTechnology Type\n\nDSL:\n\nDSL provides internet service via phone cables and is up to ten times faster than dial-up service.\n\nCable:\n\nCable provides internet speeds faster than DSL through the same cables used for cable TV.\n\nSatellite:\n\nSatellite internet is widely available, but offers slower speeds due to a far-traveling signal.\n\nFiber:\n\nFiber relies on glass strands to relay digital code and is much faster than both DSL and cable."
