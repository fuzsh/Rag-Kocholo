        "text": "The ultimate list of Iowa movies\n\nAuthors Marty S. Knepper and John S. Lawrence are putting the finishing touches on a book that includes what must be the most comprehensive list ever compiled of films made in or about Iowa.\n\nKnepper, chair of the English Department at Morningside College in Sioux City, is past president of the American Popular Culture Association and serves on the editorial board of the international academic journal, Clues.\n\nLawrence is Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at Morningside and coauthor of The Myth of the American Superhero (2002). In addition to a filmography for The Landscape of Hollywood Westerns (2006) he also created filmographies for the Film and History Association books Hollywood's White House (2003), Hollywood's West (2005), and Why We Fought (2008).\n\nThe release of their self-published book coincided with a State Historical Museum of Iowa exhibit, \"Hollywood in the Heartland.\" The exhibit debuted in June, examining Iowa's historical ties to film and featuring \"Field of Dreams\" prominently. It's on the second floor of the museum and is scheduled to run through December 2016.\n\nKnepper and Lawrence shared their list (below) with The Register, with films sorted into six categories, which are:\n\nI. Iowa settings, fictional films. These are fictional stories set at least partially in Iowa.\n\nII. Iowa settings, historical films. These include historic episodes in Iowa, ranging from the Mormon crossing in Brigham Young—Frontiersman to the tragic 1989 air disaster at Sioux City portrayed by Crash Landing: The Rescue of Flight 232.\n\nIII. Traveling Iowans. These feature at least one fictional Iowan as a significant character in a location outside the state.\n\nIV. Iowa documentaries. These films, at a minimum of 30 minutes in length, present some aspect of Iowa in a factually informative style.\n\nV. Made in Iowa. These films are recognizably Iowa in physical setting, but their fictional stories place them elsewhere or give them a generic, \"anywhere\" setting. The fact that they are shot in Iowa often fades into the recollection that they are \"about\" Iowa—particularly when communities remember the experience of filming. An example is Children of the Corn (1984), filmed in Whiting, Hornick, and Sioux City, but set in Nebraska. Many independent films have been shot in Iowa without reaching film festivals or any other kind of distribution. These are the \"ghost films,\" often a tribute to the hospitality, grants, and technical assistance of the Iowa Film Office (now Produce Iowa) and the local communities that assist producers. We have been able to see and to describe quite a few ghost films, thanks to producers who lent them to us, but like much older films, they might be quite difficult to obtain. A few films have been shot by foreign companies, who later distribute their films in other languages; such films rarely migrate back to American screens. One significant exception is Bix: The Interpretation of a Legend (1991), by Italian filmmaker Pupi Avati, who has shot several films in Iowa.\n\nVI. Films that mention Iowa. Numerous films briefly mention Iowa or Iowans to evoke some stereotype of place or character. While such films lack Iowa focus, their references become part of Iowa's cultural identity as safe, nice, or benightedly rural. For example, in Made for Each Other (1939), a character quips that \"Hollywood is the place where people from Iowa mistake each other for stars.\" And the First Husband in Kisses for My President (1964) welcomes a lisping Campfire Girl from \"Thioux Thity\"—perhaps suggesting that kids from Iowa are challenged residents of Greater Hicksville. The \"mention\" films are described only in this list short entry listing, not in the Annotated Library.\n\nTHE COMPLETE LIST\n\n(Copyright 2014, Marty S. Knepper and John S.
