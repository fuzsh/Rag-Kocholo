        "text": "Before my trip here I had no idea there were casinos in Iowa. Along the Missouri river which divides Nebraska from Iowa is the small city of Council Bluffs. Directly across the river from Council Bluffs is the large city of Omaha Nebraska. I was told that the original city here was Council Bluffs which suffered greatly from the constantly flooding river. Locals also told me that in the past 100 years or so, every time the Missouri River flooded Council Bluffs got smaller and Omaha Nebraska got bigger. Since the Omaha side was less damaged by floods, people got tired of building their homes and most moved to Nebraska. Council Bluffs remains today as a historic town and makes a profit off its casinos that are illegal in Nebraska. I didn’t do much here honestly, just mostly passed through. Above is a large casino, the Harrah, along the river. On the upper right is a fountain during the day time in a large city park.I’m sure there is much more to Council Bluff then my brief stop here. I did notice the World War memorial on the left which has names of people from the state who lost their lives. Above is a photo of the downtown area of the city. Below is the Council Bluff city library. I took this photo while walking around town and later ended up behind the library. For some reason someone had left the famous book “1984” on the stairs by the back door."
