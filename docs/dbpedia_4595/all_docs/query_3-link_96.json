        "text": "Engine said on 25/Mar/22\n\nHi Rob,\n\nshe is simply beautiful.\n\nInterestingly if one just sees her face , i would estimate her height no greater than 5'4\" but when one sees her in POLDARK without any big advantage of foot wear she really looks tall\n\nEditor Rob\n\nWhen you see her with other ladies on TV she stands out as rather tall.\n\nMiss Sandy Cowell said on 22/Aug/20\n\nWhat a beauty!\n\nð±ââï¸ð¹ 5ft9.75\n\nMimi said on 8/Jul/20\n\nRob you think 176cm more plausible for her? Pictures with Orlando Bloom shows it.\n\nEditor Rob\n\n5ft 9-9.5 is the kind of range I thought she seemed, more-so than 5ft 9.5 up to 10.\n\nSo 176 is possible!\n\nJunior Hernandez 1990 said on 22/Jan/19\n\nShe had a baby face going on. Almost 30 now but look like 22.\n\nDude 173 cm said on 16/Dec/17\n\nLooks 2 inches taller than 170 cm Logan Lerman\n\nLynn27 said on 14/Nov/17\n\nGab is taller than Taylor Swift and her limbs are longer.\n\nanyonmious said on 4/Sep/17\n\n1.73m and no more\n\nChristian-196.5cm (6ft5 3/8) said on 28/Jun/17\n\nShe says she sticks to ballet pumps, yet she's wearing heels right here, lol.\n\nMC said on 12/Jan/17\n\nIf Gabriella wore these Click Here would she be 6ft3?\n\nEditor Rob\n\nMC, she might be very close to 6ft 2-2.25 rage, but not as tall as 6ft 3.\n\nJust said on 2/Jan/17\n\nLooks almost 2 inches taller than Joely Richardson in Endless Love. Very long legs.\n\nlittlesue said on 10/Nov/16\n\nShe been in this season's Poldark, very tall lady, taller than the other girls in in. THink she the spitting image of a very young Marily Monroe\n\nMarianito10 said on 25/Sep/16\n\nShe has everything I could ask... I would never be sad if I spend all my life with a lady like her.\n\nDraxler said on 24/Apr/16\n\nGabriella Wilde 5'9.25 and Taylor 5'9\n\nvfpswiftie said on 1/Jul/15\n\nRob, Gabriella/Taylor Swift staredown, who would win?\n\nEditor Rob\n\nyou probably couldn't really spot much difference if barefeet and nose to nose, or back to back.\n\nSkye said on 6/May/15\n\nWeird that sites list her as 5'9. She must be one of those tall women who downgrade themselves..\n\nHypado said on 28/Mar/15\n\nGabriella Wilde's height is 5ft 9.75in (177 cm)\n\nMore 5ft 9.75 than 5ft 9.5in\n\nMasterX said on 25/Mar/15\n\n@Hope are you drunk LOL :P\n\nif shes 6' 3'' then i m 7' LOL\n\nHope said on 16/Mar/15\n\nShe has to be 6'3 given she same height as co- star who stands 6'6 in Endless Love.\n\nBGee said on 24/Nov/14\n\nSolid 5'9 with mile long legs that make her look even taller.\n\nChris said on 12/Nov/14\n\nJust under 9 inches? I think her head is 8,5 inches AT MOST. Very small head for her height, i think. But probably not, since i see many tall women with small heads.\n\nGabi said on 29/Oct/14\n\nI wish I had her legs!!! I have very short legs and I hate it:((\n\nJon said on 4/Oct/14\n\nWhat would you say her head size is Rob? Also, what is considered the ideal male and female head size and what is the average head size for a male and female model?\n\nEditor Rob\n\nhers looks just under 9 inches, not long for her height anway, very average.\n\nI couldn't say average head size for models, I think although their overall height is taller than your normal average that doesn't mean head sizes being bigger.\n\nJames B said on 27/Jul/14\n\nPerfection or what?\n\nAlex 6'0 said on 17/May/14\n\nShe gets listed at 5'9 too. She's minimum 5'9-5'9.25 range. Closer to 5'10 wouldn't surprise me though.\n\nHypado said on 7/May/14\n\nLooks 178/179cm in Carrie\n\ntiny said on 3/May/14\n\nWhoa...those legs are like a tall dring of water...so very refreshing. Looks about 5'10\" & 120 lbs\n\nSam said on 30/Apr/14\n\nHer looks make sense...she literally comes from a long line of models.\n\nArch Stanton said on 29/Apr/14\n\nShe looks ridiculously good. Very feminine, reminds me of a young Kim Basinger.\n\nPedro said on 28/Apr/14\n\nHere is Gabriella next to Orlando Bloom: Click Here\n\nOf course we can not see the exact size of her heels. But she seems to tower very clearly over him in that picture. So I think it could be right that she is close to 5'10\".\n\nConnor 184.5-185cm said on 28/Apr/14\n\nFit and tall what a hottie Gabriella is awwww nice legs every guys dream!\n\nSam said on 28/Apr/14\n\nThose are enough to make one a leg man...what a stunner.\n\nConnor 184.5-185cm said on 28/Apr/14\n\nShes fit! Rob if shes 177cm barefeet which is possible, and her heels are 3 inches she would be 182cm in them? btw guys wouldnt really care about her height !\n\nEditor Rob\n\nthey look quite a high angle so I'd say a little bit over 3 inches, so 184-5\n\nSAK said on 28/Apr/14\n\nDidn't realise she was this tall. But looking at it now, the listing is spot on."
