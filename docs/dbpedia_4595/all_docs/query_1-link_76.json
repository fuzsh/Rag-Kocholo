Wilde attended Heathfield St Mary's School Ascot and St Swithun's School Winchester before leaving to pursue a course in art while continuing with her modeling career. She studied fine art at the City and Guilds of London Art School but dropped out to pursue acting.Wilde began her career as a model. Spotted at age 14 by Naomi Campbell she joined her agency Premier Model Management and appeared in campaigns for companies including L.K.Bennett Lacoste Abercrombie & Fitch Burberry and Topshop and posed for InStyle Cosmopolitan Vogue and Nylon. In 2007 she was named the second-most-eligible girl in Britain but rejected press attention and the It girl label. She didn't do her first interview until 2008 when she said: I don't understand why I got anywhere near such a list because I have done nothing to help it. It's the same with my sister Isabella – we both avoid the society thing. We never go to parties we never hang out in the clubs associated with all that – we are incredibly private.\n\nBook Gabriella Wilde Now123!"
