        "text": "Summary\n\nPeriod romance TV shows based on classic literature use costuming, archaic language, and historical backdrop to provide engaging escapism.\n\nChemistry between leads and incorporation of historical events create compelling storytelling in period romance series like “My Lady Jane” and “The Spanish Princess.”\n\nLove, conflict, and societal change are explored in romantic period dramas like “Poldark” and “The Tudors,” offering a mix of history and love stories.\n\nRomance isn’t always taken seriously as a genre, but the period piece TV shows that tell sweeping love stories for the ages are some of the most highly regarded on television. This is because so many period romance series are based on seminal works of classic literature. The costuming, archaic language, and rules of propriety strongly differ from how love and courtship unfold today. This allows the audience to engage in an attractive form of escapism while watching. In recent years, period romance television series have become more popular than ever, and this will likely continue to grow.\n\nWhile plenty of these TV shows focus solely on the romantic entanglements of their characters, the use of historical events and conflicts as the backdrop for the thrusts of the plot makes compelling storytelling.\n\nMany romance books still need TV show adaptations, and these series will likely come to be known as the next generation of period romance TV shows that spark audience interest in series from the past. While plenty of these TV shows focus solely on the romantic entanglements of their characters, the use of historical events and conflicts as the backdrop for the thrusts of the plot makes compelling storytelling. However, the most important aspect of any romantic TV show is the chemistry between the two leads, and all the best-period love stories cast their characters carefully.\n\n15 My Lady Jane (2024–Present)\n\nAmazon Prime’s newest romance series has already catapulted to the top of many lists.\n\nIf season 1 is any indication, there is plenty of drama to mine in the anachronistic world of\n\nMy Lady Jane\n\n.\n\nThere are many reasons why My Lady Jane needs a season 2, and with any luck, Amazon Prime will see how much of a success the streamer’s latest period drama is with viewers. The chemistry between Jane and Guildford, the lead couple, is unmatched on TV, and My Lady Jane stands out compared to the competition because there are fantastical elements in the show’s premise. Series that take place in the Tudor era of England have a dark and depressing tone. However, My Lady Jane is uplifting and sparks a flame in the viewer’s heart.\n\nIt remains to be seen what will happen to My Lady Jane if and when the series continues, as the show is based on the novel of the same name, but there are no more installments of the book series within Jane Grey’s world. This means it will be up to the creative team to envision a new path for Jane and Guildford as their story continues. However, if season 1 is any indication, there is plenty of drama to mine in the anachronistic world of My Lady Jane.\n\n14 The Spanish Princess (2019–2020)\n\nThough The Spanish Princess is another Tudor story, it focuses on the unheard voices of the time.\n\nBefore Catherine of Aragon married King Henry VIII as his first wife, she was just a young woman looking to establish herself among the players in the English court. The Spanish Princess sees her arrive from her homeland in Spain and court the young King, and the series has been heralded for its focus on people who are historically underrepresented in period pieces. Though it only ran for two seasons, The Spanish Princess mined the drama of its history well and left audiences on the edge of their seats.\n\nThe Spanish Princess doesn’t shy away from dramatizing Catherine’s life and includes plenty of high-stakes moments that stretch the truth of historical accounts. However, this doesn’t take away from the fact that The Spanish Princess is a gorgeous sight to behold and that the series is more concerned with its thematic lessons than with a faithful account of King Henry VIII and Catherine’s relationship. While the marriage may have ended in disaster, there are plenty of romantic moments that the series shows to the audience.\n\n13 Poldark (2015–2019)\n\nMasterpiece’s classic series came back for an even more successful reboot.\n\nThe original Poldark premiered in 1975 and has long been considered a classic of period television, but the 2014 revival has established itself as a worthy successor. Both are based on the Poldark books by Winson Graham, which tell the story of Ross Vennor Poldark, who returns home to England after fighting on the side of the British in the American Revolutionary War. It’s an interesting perspective that many period dramas overlook, as stories about the Revolutionary War typically encapsulate tales of espionage and governmental strife.\n\nHowever, Poldark takes the viewer back to the sweeping moors of Cornwall to see Vennor fall in love and rebuild his family’s estate as the nation evolves around him. The relationship between Vennor and his wife, Demelza, is one of the most compelling parts of the series. Though Demelza starts as a maid in the Poldark house and Vennor is wracked with the pain of unrequited love for another, the pair soon find their feelings towards each other changing. Poldark remained one of Masterpiece‘s most highly acclaimed dramas throughout its run.\n\n12 The Tudors (2007–2010)\n\nThe troubled and rakish King Henry VIII makes an interesting anti-hero and romantic lead.\n\nWhen Jonathan Rhys Meyers was cast as King Henry VIII, it was a surprising choice, as were many of the actors cast to play the characters of the Tudor family. However, he soon proved himself to be the right choice for Henry, alongside other actors early in their careers like a young Henry Cavill and Natalie Dormer. Dormer plays Anne Boleyn, Henry’s ill-fated lover and then queen who he has a whirlwind relationship with. Even though it’s well-known what happened to Henry’s many wives, it doesn’t make it less thrilling to watch their lives unfold.\n\nAdditionally, though Henry is quite a womanizer and anti-hero, the audience does become invested in his life and sees him truly fall in love across the seasons. There are plenty of parts of The Tudors that aren’t historically accurate, but the show does get some of the facts right, especially when it comes to how desperate Henry was for a male heir. This anxiety about preserving the Tudor line is what gets in the way of his relationships with the women in his life and is the controlling factor behind many of his decisions.\n\n11 Vanity Fair (2018)\n\nOlivia Cooke plays the conniving and romantic Becky Sharp with ease and wit.\n\nThe tale is a biting commentary on social class and the cost of climbing the rungs of high society.\n\nThough Olivia Cooke is now best known for her role as Alicent Hightower in The House of the Dragon, before that, she took on the role of Becky Sharp in the scandalous story of Vanity Fair. Both the Amazon Prime miniseries and the 2004 film starring Reese Witherspoon follow the story from the book by William Makepeace Thackeray from the mid-1800s. The tale is a biting commentary on social class and the cost of climbing the rungs of high society.\n\nVanity Fair also features a heartbreaking performance from Claudia Jessie, as Becky’s naive friend Amelia, who now plays Eloise Bridgerton in the acclaimed Bridgerton series. While Becky and Amelia are polar opposites, they both suffer at the hands of love, as Amelia opens her heart too fully, and Becky is practically incapable of letting anyone in at all. Like most contemporary period pieces, Vanity Fair allows Becky to say what’s on her mind and connect with the audience with beliefs that align more closely with present-day ideologies.\n\n10 The King’s Affection (2021)\n\nIn The King’s Affection, love grows even as secrets and hidden identities get in the way.\n\nMany K-dramas focus on the past and how love blossomed centuries ago, but The King’s Affection might be the best of them all. It’s one of the many K-dramas that Netflix distributes internationally, allowing audiences across the world to get swept up in the heartwrenching romance that unfolds between Dam-yi and Jung Ji-woon. The series not only deals with their relationship but also with the court politics and gender discrimination that took place during the Joseon dynasty. Dam-yi is a compelling protagonist, but it’s equally easy to fall in love with Jung Ji-woon as she does.\n\nThe thrust of the series sees Dam-yi have to assume her brother’s identity, the crown prince, and she must guard this secret with her life to protect herself and her mother. However, Jung Ji-woon begins to fall in love with her even as she pretends to be the prince, leading to an epic forbidden romance. Additionally, The King’s Affection beautifully brings the Joseon dynasty to life through the sets and costumes and makes the relationship between the characters swoon-worthy to modern audiences.\n\n9 Sanditon (2019–2023)\n\nBased on Jane Austen’s unfinished novel, Sanditon makes the most of her final words.\n\nSanditon is another dramatic period piece from Masterpiece and features Theo James in a thoroughly romantic and unique role that he easily embodies. Unlike other adaptations of Jane Austen’s work, Sanditon didn’t have a completed book to use as its basis, and this led to a series quite different from other screen iterations of Austen’s writing. However, this allowed Sanditon to stand apart and left room for several seasons that see the protagonist, Charlotte, find love in unexpected places.\n\nJames is only featured in season 1 as Charlotte’s love interest, but their chemistry is fantastic, as is the enemies-to-lovers arc that Sanditon creates for them. Like many of Austen’s heroines, Charlotte is defined by her strong moral beliefs and sharp tongue, which attract the attention of the suitors who she entertains. One of the best parts of Sanditon is that even as her love interests come and go, Charlotte remains loyal to her friends and loved ones. Additionally, Sanditon takes a more modern approach to displays of love than other chaste Austen projects.\n\n8 Daniel Deronda (2002)\n\nA young Hugh Dancy makes a tortured and beautiful hero in this BBC miniseries.\n\nBased on the novel by George Elliot, AKA Mary Ann Evans, Daniel Deronda is a lesser-known romantic drama. However, it should be better remembered, considering the stellar cast that brings the story to life. Hugh Dancy plays the lead character, Daniel Deronda, and his entanglements with the two warring sides of himself serve as an effective commentary on the changing opinions about ethnicity and religion in the late 1800s. The love triangle at the heart of the story effectively demonstrates this battle inside Daniel as he searches for love and acceptance.\n\nDaniel’s friend and love interest, Gwendolen, represents Daniel’s connection to the aristocracy in England, and her sacrifices for her family’s station indicate the cost of the strict hierarchical society of the time. Conversely, Daniel finds himself falling in love with Mirah, who is more closely associated with the family he lost as a child and his interest in his background. While Daniel is the main character, Gwendolen’s development and discovery of her desires are some of the series’ strongest emotional beats.\n\n7 Bridgerton (2020–Present)\n\nNetflix’s lush and steamy period drama has become a worldwide phenomenon.\n\nEach season demonstrates the show’s capability of evolving and engaging with important social topics.\n\nUnlike the many period romances that only run for a single season, Bridgerton has many strong years ahead of it. The series will continue to adapt the many stories of the titular Bridgerton children. Since its premiere in 2020, Bridgerton has been one of Netflix’s most consistent performers. Each season demonstrates the show’s capability of evolving and engaging with important social topics. Now that it’s official that Bridgerton season 4 will adapt Benedict’s book story, audiences are anxiously waiting to see how the show will alter the original story to fit the transgressive and romantic themes of the series.\n\nBenedict’s sexuality and his desire to find a partner who can match his intellectual pursuits will likely play a large role in his search for romance in season 4. Bridgerton stands apart from many period dramas because it’s unafraid to show sex and physical intimacy onscreen and features this as a healthy and beautiful part of romantic love. However, Bridgerton strives to be more than simply a romance and to express positive messages to its viewers. In season 3, the show made strides at communicating self-love and independence within a romantic relationship.\n\n6 Outlander (2014–Present)\n\nThis melodramatic series sees love transcend time and space.\n\nIt’s been many years since Claire was first transported back in time to meet Jamie. Since Outlander season 1, many new stories have developed outside of Claire and Jamie’s time-bending romance, but their connection will always be at the heart of the series. Though the mystical and magical elements of Outlander play a large role in the series, the true historical events and conflicts between the British and the Scottish are just as important. The audience sees the characters travel across the world to ensure the survival of their country.\n\nAs the series progresses, Claire, Jamie, and their children all become caught up in different political conflicts and travel back and forth in time, trying to find each other. Some of the most heartbreaking parts of the series come from Claire and Jamie’s separation across time. The series takes the concept of star-crossed lovers to the next level, making it incredibly satisfying when the pair are inevitably reunited. Outlander remains extremely popular and has consistently garnered positive critical reviews for its ability to capture both political and romantic intrigue.\n\n5 Dickinson (2019–2021)\n\nThis series features a stylized and adventurous retelling of the poet Emily Dickinson’s life.\n\nHailee Steinfeld turned out to be the perfect Emily Dickinson, and the series beautifully brings to life her relationship with Sue Gilbert, her best friend and lover. Though Sue marries Emily’s brother, this does little to prevent their love and connection, which remains an all-important throughline across the seasons. While Dickinson has all the trappings of a traditional period drama, it makes thoughtful additions of anachronisms in the dialogue and elements of magical realism to communicate how Emily experiences the world.\n\nUnsurprisingly, poetry is woven throughout the series, and the poet’s love of nature and learning plays a key role in her development. Unfortunately, Dickinson was short-lived as it was canceled after season 3, but the final season proved to be the most popular and best of the show. While many of the more progressive themes and storylines that Dickinson features aren’t true to life, they are true to the spirit of the poet that the series takes its name from.\n\n4 The Great (2020–2023)\n\nAs a comedy, a romance, and a reimagining of history, The Great hits its marks in every aspect.\n\nIt’s hilarious to see Fanning play the indomitable Catherine as she arrives at the Russian court as a naive young woman.\n\nElle Fanning and Nicholas Hoult make hilarious enemies, friends, and lovers in The Great, a loosely factual take on Catherine The Great’s rise to power in Russia in the 18th century. It’s hilarious to see Fanning play the indomitable Catherine as she arrives at the Russian court as a naive young woman. However, she quickly begins to plot the assassination of her husband, Emperor Peter III. All the while, the raucous and indulgent machinations of court life surround her, and Catherine begins to make allies and friends.\n\nThe romance element comes into play as Catherine softens slightly to Peter and sees that while he makes a terrible ruler, there are parts of his company that she enjoys. The Great is violent, explicit, and at times disgusting, but this is par for the course when it comes to satirical retellings of tumultuous historical periods. Despite the humorous tone that the show predominantly takes on, there are moments of sensitivity and depth that balance the more shocking aspects of the series.\n\n3 Victoria (2016–2019)\n\nThe romance between Queen Victoria and Prince Albert is one of the most famous in history.\n\nNot only was Queen Victoria one of the longest-reigning monarchs in England’s history, but she also had one of the most romantic and tragic marriages of any ruler of the period. Her close relationship with her husband, Prince Albert, and their love match was an unconventional arrangement during the Victorian era, and the series shows their early courtship through their later years before Albert’s sudden death. Though Victoria doesn’t look at the queen’s reign with too critical an eye, it does discuss some political and social upheaval.\n\nJenna Coleman might have gotten her start in Doctor Who, but she shines as Victoria, successfully navigating her journey from a young woman in love to a queen well-versed in matters of state. Her chemistry with Tom Hughes, who plays Albert, is one of the most enduring parts of the series, as, without their relationship, the series wouldn’t have a personal or emotional aspect to draw viewers in. Overall, Victoria paints the queen in an overly flattering light, but this doesn’t stop the audience from enjoying the aspirational parts of her love story with Albert.\n\n2 Downton Abbey (2010–2015)\n\nThe Masterpiece series is credited with bringing period dramas into the larger cultural conversation.\n\nWhile period romance TV shows have always had their niche and found the right audience, few have transcended the genre as successfully as Downton Abbey. Running for six seasons and later receiving further film continuations, the show encompasses some of the biggest changes and conflicts of the 20th century through the eyes of an aristocratic family in England, the Crawleys, as the time of the monarchy and strict social classes was at its end. Much of the storylines across the seasons focus on the romantic lives of the three Crawley daughters.\n\nDownton Abbey continues to be culturally relevant because the plots and entanglements of the characters are akin to a modern-day drama, only with amazing sets and costumes thrown into the mix. Additionally, Downton Abbey is never afraid to have the Crawley daughters push the boundaries of their conservative time and find love wherever they can with unexpected partners. The show also focuses on the larger Crawley family, as well as the household staff employed by the Crawleys at Downton.\n\n1 Pride And Prejudice (1995)\n\nThis BBC miniseries is one of the best Jane Austen adaptations of all time.\n\nBefore Kiera Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen became the most famous actors to take on the roles of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth played the characters in the earlier version of the story. The BBC’s television adaptation of Jane Austen’s seminal novel was considered the definitive take on the story for many years, and it’s easy to see why. While it lacks the budget and polish of a feature film, Pride and Prejudice completely immerses the viewer in the period. It elevates the romance in Elizabeth’s life and her intelligence and fierce love for her family."
