        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe proportion of women and underrepresented groups in medicine (URM) in the field of hematology and oncology remains low, particularly in academic leadership positions despite the growing number of minorities entering the field.1 Editorial board appointments, especially in major medical journals, allow physicians to have a substantial impact on the nature of the published scholarly work and serve as a platform for academic opportunities and promotion.1 Recent studies indicate that, despite the rise in women entering the medical profession over the last decade, women remain substantially underrepresented in senior leadership positions, including editorial boards in biomedical journals.1,2 This barrier contributes to disparities in publishing and career advancement, which in turn affects academic promotion, grant funding, and economic compensation.3 Furthermore, women and minorities are less likely to receive recognition awards from medical societies when compared with men and non-minorities, and this was evident across all oncology subspecialties.4\n\nThere are ongoing efforts over the past decade to diversify the physician workforce. While there have been some notable successes, such as in 2017, when for the first time in history more women than men matriculated into US medical schools,5 women remain unrepresented in academic medicine.1 The workforce of academic oncology is also unbalanced when it comes to gender diversity. A recent study that examined 6030 faculty from 265 academic medical oncology, radiation oncology, and surgical oncology programs found that women constitute 35.9% of total faculty.6 This disparity is further magnified at the leadership level and when considering race and ethnicity.6,7\n\nWomen in medicine face numerous challenges in academia, including a lack of mentorship, discrimination, gender bias, imposter syndrome, unrealistic societal expectations, unequal pay, and the need for a better work-life balance.8 Moreover, as URM faculty members work to advance their careers, they often face a lack of mentorship/sponsorship, unrecognized diversity efforts, and hostile work environments.9 The effects of discrimination and inequities related to compensation and career advancement are amplified for women from minoritized backgrounds due to their intersectional identities,8 explained as how gender, ethnicity, race, sexual orientation, disability, class, and other features overlap to create unique dynamics and effects. Ensuring diversity in the leadership roles is essential for career advancement, grant funding, and academic promotion.3 Moreover, URM physicians play a crucial role in healthcare access and quality and optimize patient care while mirroring the ethnically and racially diverse US population and closing the existing care gap.10\n\nIn academic medicine, editorial board involvement confers leadership and influence within a field as journals are the gatekeepers of academic discourse. Often, selection of these positions is based on academic rank and scholarly achievement, and can subsequently influence hiring, tenure, or promotion decisions. A diverse editorial board may elicit a wider pool of peer reviewers and encourage submissions from researchers of diverse backgrounds, thereby driving innovation and publishing of unique ideas, perspectives, and values.11 Moreover, having a gender-balanced and diverse editorial team promotes collaboration and decreases the publication bias against women.12\n\nPhysicians and researchers specializing in hematology, medical oncology, surgical oncology, and radiation oncology represent a large proportion of the scientific and clinical workforce. Today, women make up 40% of the oncology workforce, and increasing numbers of oncologists identify as a URM, including, but not limited to their race, ethnicity, sexual orientation and/or gender identity, socioeconomic background, immigration status, and intersectional combinations.13 With the pace of innovation and prolific publication rates in the field, assessing gender and race representation in leadership editorial board positions in major journals is critical in furthering equity. Herein, we examined the gender and race/ethnicity representation in editorial board positions at the leading medical and scientific hematology and oncology journals.\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe observed a significant lack of representation of women and URM in leadership roles on editorial boards in Hematology, Medical Oncology, Surgical Oncology, and Radiation Oncology journals. Despite the growing number of women and ethnic minority groups in the fields of hematology and oncology, including radiation oncology and surgical oncology, academic leadership positions remain predominantly filled by non-Hispanic White men. To our knowledge, this study is the first to assess the gender and race/ethnicity composition of leadership roles in editorial boards of major hematology and oncology-related journals. Our study design is novel as we provided editors the opportunity to complete a survey of self-identification which demonstrated 100% concordance with assigned gender and 95.5% concordance with assigned race. Our study is consistent with the work of many other researchers that have shown similar gender disparities in fields such as Cardiology, Gastroenterology and Hepatology, and Plastic Surgery to name a few.15-17 Additionally, our study builds on these data by demonstrating inequity in the representation of women on editorial boards in hematology and oncology subspecialties and adds the additional perspective of race with a self-survey verification. This data was collected in the year after the death of George Floyd and sparked a movement to improve diversity within academia with many journals expressing a commitment to improving the diversity of editorial boards. It appears that many journals did not take swift action.\n\nAs evidenced in , URM and women occupied a minority of leadership roles on editorial boards in high-impact hematology and oncology journals. We further divided the databased on subspecialty. Since 2019, the average proportion of women hematologists/oncologists and radiation oncologists was 34.3% and 27.4%, respectively, per the AAMC. The gender distribution of surgical oncologists is not publicly available. Women hematologists/oncologists represent 26.4% of all editorial board members within their field, suggesting the proportion of editorial board members included in the study period do not represent the proportion of women in the field and they continue to be disparately excluded from editorial leadership positions (P < .0001). We found that women editorial board members in radiation oncology were represented at a higher proportion compared to the proportion of women in the specialty, at 40.0% (P = .005). Surgical oncology had the lowest number of female editorial board members at 11.9%, but the information on the proportion of women in the field remains unavailable. Disciplines that are male predominant, such as Surgical Oncology, tend to show unusually slow improvements in the gender ratio over time.18 These disciplines require a more directed and intentional approach if parity is to be reached. Fostering more women in surgical oncology may benefit representation by women at many levels of academia and improve productivity, collaboration, and recruitment. “Our results are consistent with a recent study that evaluated the gender breakdown of editorial boards of top oncology journals with the highest impact factor, which revealed only 24% were women. Among 71 editors-in-chief of the top oncology journals, 14 (20%) were women, a percentage similar to our study (16%).”\n\nSeveral studies have demonstrated that women are underrepresented in editorial boards of biomedical journals across different specialties.1,15,19-23 For instance, women accounted for only 4% of editors-in-chief positions in the 100 most influential journals in clinical medicine before 1994.15 A recent study on gendered publication trends in oncology suggests that women comprised a smaller percentage of first (26.5%) and senior (19.9%) authors.24\n\nWe also analyzed race by editorial board position and found that it was significantly different among men and women, with women filling roughly one-seventh of the editor-in-chief positions. Women were about half as likely to be in the editor-in-chief position compared with men. In regard to race, a majority of editorial leadership was non-Hispanic White with next largest majority, Asian/South Asian. Of the women in editorial leadership, 9 of them were non-Hispanic White and 1 was Asian. The representation of underrepresented minority women physicians in editor-in-chief positions is at an inexorable zero, which is a sign of unconscious attitudes that may exclude minority women from certain positions. It is imperative that a diverse and inclusive board includes equity beyond gender. Historically, efforts for gender equity have focused on disparities experienced by White, middle-class women. Women of color experience discrimination based on their multiple identities,25 which is evidenced in our data with the inexorable zero of underrepresented minority women in editor-in-chief positions. We must work toward a more diverse and inclusive editorial board to ensure critical perspectives are heard and scientific discovery is fostered.\n\nRegarding geography location, journals were predominately based on the US and Canada, followed by Europe. Given that the highest impact journals are from Western countries likely affects the diversity of our results and diversity of thought in disseminated research. These data highlight the need for international collaboration in editorial positions regardless of geographic location of the journal. Additionally, editorial board diversity should be evaluated in lower-middle-income countries as the disparities may be worse based on prior studies.26\n\nImportantly, external factors may also influence the gender composition of editorial boards. Recent data in hematology and oncology demonstrated that men had a higher H-index than women, which typically acts as a marker to describe the quantity and quality of research output, which may in turn influence selection to these positions.4 Although H-index is an objective measure of this, it does not take into account the reality that literature shows that women are disadvantaged when applying for research funding and obtaining high-impact publications.4,27,28 As demonstrated here, it can be difficult to translate merit of an academic leadership position on objective measures such as number of publications or H-index alone. Objective research metrics do not reflect academic service, including serving on committees, teaching, mentoring, or serving on boards of professional organizations. These activities add value to a candidate’s leadership but take away from time and opportunity to conduct additional research. Furthermore, there have been observational studies that have not only demonstrated a confidence gap between women and men in medicine but also how confidence can be seen as a negative trait in women.21 Perception of confidence can directly affect academic promotion29 and academic activities, including editorial board membership. All these external factors contribute to the growing trend seen in academic medicine with the increasing proportion of women in the workforce, but continued barriers to career advancement and leadership opportunities.\n\nEfforts to diversify editorial boards are underway in many medical subspecialities and these efforts have been supported by national associations. The American Heart Association has created an optional self-reported survey within their manuscript tracking systems in which they measure the composition of editorial boards, invited authors, and invited reviewers for gender, racial, and ethnic diversity and made this information publicly available. Since the implementation, they have seen slight increases in individuals from underrepresented groups. This is a critical undertaking that should be standardized across academic medical journals to have concrete endpoints for the initiatives moving forward. Given that diversification of the oncology, workforce has improved over time, it is critical that editors-in-chief intentionally approach early career researchers from groups not well-represented on their boards to fill vacant spots. Additionally, training for editorial staff to include modules on inclusion, diversity, and unconscious bias has also been thought to be an effective strategy. Some editorial boards have fixed terms to continue bringing varied perspectives every few years. Furthermore, it is important for journals to ensure that a comprehensive review of candidates is undertaken so that a candidate’s full skills can be assessed. Objective metrics for assessing editorial board candidacy should include measures of academic service in conjunction with research metrics.\n\nIncorporating gender and race into research on disparities has its challenges, as these variables are difficult to define. While asking individuals to self-identify their race and gender remains the gold standard of reporting, low response rates and response bias have been shown to affect results. In addition to determining gender and race/ethnicity based on publicly available data, we added to our study by asking editors to self-report their gender and race in hopes to validate our methodology given the importance of considering gender and race in academia. Notably, these data from our study support the methodology of a coding team assigning gender and race as an alternative to self-report.\n\nOur study also shows the low response rates and significant discrepancies in the demographic of respondents seen in survey-based identification and supports the use of assigning gender and race to participants of a study. Results demonstrated that a majority of respondents were identified correctly (63/66), and a significantly lower proportion of men responded to the survey compared to the gender breakdown of the editorial board members.\n\nOur data demonstrate significant disparities in the proportion of minority editorial board members in all oncology subspecialties. Lack of representation of URM in leadership roles despite similar qualifying factors has been demonstrated in a variety of specialties.30-33 This disparity is likely multifactorial, although some part of this disparity is compounded by a low representation in the medical workforce at large. Leadership roles contribute to visibility and opportunities, which, in turn, can help with career advancement and recognition. In addition, minority faculty are often given additional responsibilities in the workplace that often detract from time spent on scholarly productivity, which is commonly used as a benchmark for editorial board leadership.\n\nOur study has several limitations, including its retrospective design. Our study represents a cross-sectional view of the current state of diversity of the editorial boards and cannot be used to determine the efficacy of any changing patterns over time. In our study, gender assignment was binary, which could have led to the misclassification of editorial board members from gender minorities. Similarly, our methodology for race assignment had limitations as awardees were assigned at the discretion of the coder, and multi-racial classifications were not included. Self-identification is recognized as the most reliable method and preferred method for compiling information about a person’s gender, race, and ethnicity, however, investigator observation is an acceptable method for identifying demographic data. A recent study outlining race/ethnicity reporting in medical journals recognizes the various ways in which race/ethnicity can be identified including self-report, investigator observation, database, electronic health record, or survey instrument. Furthermore, biomedical studies that analyze race and ethnicity depend on self-reporting of those factors and have been shown to contain inaccuracies as well. We ensured our coders were from diverse backgrounds to mitigate potential bias and self-survey was sent out in hopes to mitigate this limitation, although we acknowledge that all of our coders were of one gender which may contribute to bias. As incorporating race into research has its challenges, coders were instructed to use the NIH’s OMB Directive 15 as a framework. Of the multiple studies which have evaluated diversity in editorial boards, this study is the first to characterize the racial/ethnic disparities. It is essential to characterize racial disparities in conjunction with gender disparities as it exposes critical deficiencies within our system (ie, inexorable zero representation of minority women physicians in Editor-in-Chief positions).\n\nAs the field is moving toward making a commitment to diversifying the workforce, editorial board leadership must be responsible for ensuring diversity within their editorial boards. Editorial boards should be assessed on an ongoing basis to see if the efforts to improve diversity are working. The simplest approach to reviewing this data would be through self-identification through the editorial manager websites so data can be automatically extracted for internal review.\n\nAs URM and women occupy a minority of leadership roles on editorial boards in high-impact hematology and oncology journals, there need to be efforts to improve the current state of diversity in editorial boards. Moving forward, intentional efforts need to be made to bring in editorial board members with a variety of academic strengths and ensure criteria that do not disproportionately favor one gender or race over others.\n\nFurther studies should aim to determine the gender and racial bias behind selection criteria for editorial board members. Efforts should be made to encompass different types of academic strengths and ensure criteria that do not disproportionately favor one gender or race over others. To further research in this area to reach parity, journals should make a concerted effort to evaluate their policies internally and act accordingly to increase the diversity of their leadership. It is imperative that we work to move toward a more diverse and inclusive editorial board to ensure critical perspectives are heard and scientific discovery is fostered."
