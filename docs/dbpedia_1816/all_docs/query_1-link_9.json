        "text": "14 November: Battle of Solway Moss\n\nDevastated by his army's defeat by the English at Solway Moss, James V withdrew to Falkland Palace, Fife. He is reported to have laid down and turned his face to the wall.\n\n8 December: Mary's birth\n\nMary was born at Linlithgow Palace, to James V, King of Scots, and his French second wife, Mary of Guise. She was the only legitimate child of James to survive him. She was also the great-niece of Henry VIII of England, giving her a claim to the throne.\n\n14 December: Death of James V\n\nJames V of Scots died just six days after the birth of his daughter. In reference to the origins of the Royal Stewart Dynasty, James is supposed to have said: 'It began with a lass and it will gang with a lass.'\n\n1 July: The Treaties of Greenwich\n\nThese treaties between Scotland and England included a marriage agreement between Mary and Edward, son of King Henry VIII of England. This was an attempt to gain control of Mary and weaken French influence in Scotland.\n\n9 September: Queen of Scots\n\nMary was crowned Queen of Scots aged just nine months. The ceremony was conducted in the Chapel Royal of Stirling Castle by Cardinal David Beaton, Archbishop of St Andrews, Scotland’s most senior Catholic cleric.\n\nDecember: The Rough Wooing\n\nThe Rough Wooing began when the Earl of Arran renounced the Treaties of Greenwich in December 1543. Henry VIII attacked Scotland to force a marriage between Mary and Edward. The Rough Wooing continued until 1551.\n\n7 July: The Treaty of Haddington\n\nThe Treaty of Haddington strengthened Scotland’s links with France. The King of France, Henri II, agreed to provide military support against England, while Mary was promised in marriage to Henri’s son, the Dauphin François.\n\n7 August: La petite Royne - the little Queen\n\nAt the age of five Mary was taken to France. Henri II thought her 'the most beautiful child he had ever seen', François adored her. Henri’s wife, Catherine de Medici resented Mary as she was a Queen, giving her precedence over Catherine’s daughters in the royal nursery.\n\n24 April: Marriage to France\n\nMary and François married in Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris on 24 April 1558. She wore a lavishly decorated white gown. With her auburn hair and pale complexion the effect was dazzling, if unconventional; traditionally white was reserved for royal mourning in France.\n\n17 November: Elizabeth I Queen of England\n\nMary Tudor, England’s Catholic queen, died in 1558 and was succeeded by her Protestant half-sister Elizabeth. Mary believed that she had the stronger claim to the English throne. Henri II encouraged Mary to display the Arms of England with those of France and Scotland.\n\n11 June: Death of Mary of Guise\n\nScotland’s Protestant Lords appealed to England for support against the regency of Mary of Guise. She was forced to retreat to Edinburgh Castle, and died there on 11 June. Scotland and England signed the Treaty of Edinburgh, which ended the Auld Alliance.\n\n5 December: Death of François\n\nOn François’ death Mary was bereft. She wrote: 'My heart keeps watch for one who's gone.' Catherine de Medici became regent for her younger son, Charles IX. Keen to secure the position of her own children, Catherine made sure that Mary could not remain in France.\n\n14 August: Adieu to France\n\nBefore leaving France, Mary met both Catholic and Protestant delegations from Scotland. She aligned with her Protestant half-brother, Lord James Stewart, who advised her to maintain the religious status quo.\n\n2 September: The Royal Entry to Edinburgh\n\nMary arrived in Leith on 19 August 1561 and made her official entry into Edinburgh a few weeks later. She was presented with the keys to the city, a Bible and a book of Psalms. The celebrations blatantly promoted the Protestant cause and attacked Catholicism.\n\n4 September: First audience with John Knox\n\nMary summoned the Protestant Reformation leader Knox five times to answer allegations he made against her. During their first audience she accused him of provoking armed revolt. He compared her to the tyrant Nero. Mary held her own till Knox left, then broke down in tears.\n\n17 February: Henry, Lord Darnley – the right choice?\n\nHenry Lord Darnley was a Catholic and was descended from both James II of Scots and Henry VII of England. When Mary met him for the first time at Wemyss in Fife she thought him 'the lustiest and best proportioned lang (tall) man she had seen'.\n\n29 July: Marriage to Darnley\n\nMary and Darnley were married in the Chapel Royal of Holyroodhouse. She proclaimed Darnley King of Scots the following day without the consent of Parliament. The announcement was met with stony silence. Only Darnley’s father cried 'God save His Grace'.\n\n26 August: The Lords in revolt – the Chaseabout Raid\n\nOpposition to Mary’s marriage arose very quickly. The Protestant Earl of Moray, fearing that Mary’s marriage to a Catholic threatened the Reformation, led an attempt to overthrow both Mary and her King Consort. The episode was more an armed chase than an outright rebellion.\n\n10 February: Murder of Darnley\n\nIn the early hours of 10 February 1567, an explosion blew up Old Provost's Lodging at Kirk o'Field in Edinburgh, where Darnley was recuperating from illness. Darnley was found dead in the garden, apparently murdered. Mary herself was implicated in the plot, but the prime suspect was James Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell.\n\n15 May: Marriage of Mary and Bothwell\n\nBothwell was tried and acquitted of Darnley's murder. His next move was to abduct Mary on her return to Edinburgh from Stirling, where she had been visiting her son – for the last time, it would transpire. It is not known whether Mary was a willing participant in the plot or not, but two weeks later the couple were married, Bothwell having divorced his first wife just twelve days previously.\n\n24 July: Abdication of Mary, Queen of Scots\n\nAlienated from her closest advisors, Mary’s monarchy floundered. After failing to quash a rebellion of Scottish peers, Mary was imprisoned in Loch Leven Castle and forced to abdicate in favour of her one-year-old son.\n\n2 May: Escape from Loch Leven\n\nWith the aid of George Douglas, the owner of Loch Leven, Mary escaped and raised an army to face the forces of the Earl of Moray at the Battle of Langside.16 May: Fleeing ScotlandDefeated at the Battle of Langside, Mary fled from Scotland. She crossed into England convinced her cousin and fellow monarch, Elizabeth I, would help her regain her throne. Elizabeth however was unsure how to deal with this unexpected ‘guest’ and ordered Mary’s detention at Carlisle Castle.\n\nOctober: The Conference of York\n\nElizabeth wanted proof Mary was innocent of Darnley’s murder before agreeing to a meeting. The Conference of York failed to find such proof and in February 1569 Mary was taken to Tutbury Castle in Staffordshire, a residence of the Earl of Shrewsbury, who became her jailer for most of the next fifteen years.\n\nMarch: James and Elizabeth – a contract of amity\n\nDesperate to be free, Mary proposed that she and her son James should rule Scotland together. However, James had secretly allied himself with Elizabeth without Mary’s knowledge. In March 1585 he officially renounced his mother’s proposal, leaving her devastated.\n\nApril: A new jailor\n\nIn April Mary was transfered to the custody of Sir Amyas Paulet. He detested her and revoked many of the privileges Shrewsbury had allowed her.\n\nThe Babington Plot\n\nMary was secretly corresponding with supporters, unaware that Walsingham’s agents were intercepting her letters. This allowed them to trick her into agreeing to a plot proposed by Anthony Babington, to assassinate Elizabeth I and make Mary Queen of England. This sealed Mary’s fate. She was moved to Fotheringhay Castle in September.\n\n15 October: Tried for treason\n\nMary was tried for treason at Fotheringhay Castle, Northampton where she was she remained in captivity until her execution."
