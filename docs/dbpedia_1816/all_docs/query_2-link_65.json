        "text": "25 March 1005: The Battle of Monzievaird takes place just north of Crieff, close to the location of today's Glenturret Distillery. King Kenneth III is killed in the battle by his successor, Malcolm II.\n\n1018: Malcolm II defeats the Northumbrians at the Battle of Carham, near the River Tweed. This leads to the first demarcation of the modern border between Scotland and England.

She is part of the English royal family fleeing the Normans after 1066.\n\n1072: Malcolm III's incursions into Northumbria provoke an invasion of Scotland by the Normans. This ended with the Treaty of Abernethy, in English eyes a submission that gives rise to later claims of dominance of the English throne over the Scots throne.\n\n1079: Another Norman/English invasion of Scotland takes place, in retaliation for further raids into Northumbria by Malcolm III's forces. The Treaty of Abernethy is reimposed.\n\n13 November 1093: Malcolm Canmore, is killed, along with his eldest son by Margaret, in yet another raid on Northumbria.\n\n16 November 1093: Queen Margaret dies of grief and is buried in the church she has founded in Dunfermline.

Despite the defeat, the Treaty of Durham that follows in 1139 gives David I effective control over Northumbria and Cumbria.\n\n9 April 1139: The second Treaty of Durham is a concluded between King Stephen of England and King David I of Scotland. Under its terms Stephen recognises the independence of Scotland.\n\n28 June 1146: A service of dedication is held in the abbey church at Melrose Abbey, which would take another 50 years to complete in its entirety.\n\n10 November 1150: Work begins on the construction of Dryburgh Abbey in the Scottish Borders.\n\n24 May 1153: David I dies, and is succeeded by his grandson, Malcolm IV, aged 12.\n\n6 January 1156: Somerled defeats the Norse at the Battle of Epiphany (probably off Islay)and subsequently becomes King of the Isles, leader of a Gaelic state centred on Finlaggan on Islay.\n\n1157: Henry II of England rips up a promise given to David I in 1149 to allow the Scots all the land North of the River Tees.

His army returns to their galleys and depart without engaging in a full scale battle.\n\n9 December 1165: Malcolm dies, aged 24 and unmarried, and is succeeded by his younger brother William I or William the Lion after his symbol, a red lion rampant on a yellow field that becomes the basis of one of Scotland's two flags.\n\n24 December 1165: King William I, or William the Lion, is crowned King of Scotland at Scone.\n\n13 July 1174: William I is captured by the English at Alnwick while trying to retake Northumbria.\n\n8 December 1174: King William I, William the Lion, signs the Treaty of Falaise to secure his release from English captivity.
