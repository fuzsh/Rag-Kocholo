        "text": "Henry IV\n\nIn 1406, Henry IV's second great seal showed that the French quartering had been changed to the modern arms, \"Azure three fleurs-de-lis or.\" Same arms continued for Henry V, Henry VI, Edward IV, Edward V, Richard III, Henry VII, Henry VIII, Edward VI, Mary I, and Elizabeth. (Note: Circa 1550, during Mary's reign, the arms of England were sometimes impaled with the arms of King Philip II of Spain, her husband.)\n\nJames I\n\nIn 1603, the arms of England and France were placed in the first and fourth quarters, the arms of Scotland (\"Or a lion rampant within a double tressure flory counterflory gules\") were placed in the second quarter, and the arms of Ireland (\"Azure a harp or stringed argent\") were placed in the third quarter. (Note: the Irish arms were added only at this time even though the Kings of England had been the Kings of Ireland since 1541.) These arms remained the same for Charles I, Charles II, and James II.\n\nAnne\n\nIn 1707, the arms of England and Scotland were moved to the first and fourth quarters, the arms of France in the second, and the arms of Ireland in the third.\n\nGeorge I\n\nIn 1714, the fourth quarter was changed to three sections tierced per pale and per chevron for Hanover: (1) Gules two lions passant guardant or; (2) Or semy of hearts gules a lion rampant azure; and (3) Gules a horse courant argent. Overall, an escutcheon of pretence gulescharged with the Crown of Charlemagne.) Same arms for George II.\n\nGeorge III\n\nIn 1801, when George III renounced his title as King of France under the Treaty of Paris, the French quartering was removed. The arms of England then occupied the first and fourth quarters, the arms of Scotland the second, and the arms of Ireland the third. For Hanover, there was an escutcheon overall surmounted by the electoral bonnet, which was replaced in 1816 by a Royal Crown (when Hanover became a Kingdom).\n\nVictoria and all subsequent monarchs (to date)\n\nIn 1837, the Hanoverian escutcheon and crown were removed because Queen Victoria, as a woman, was unable to succeed to the throne of Hanover under Hanoverian law. The arms have remained unchanged since then."
