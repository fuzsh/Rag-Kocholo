        "text": "William the Marshal served five Kings of England\n\nKing Henry II\n\nHenry The Young King\n\nKing Richard The Lionheart\n\nKing John Lackland\n\nKing Henry III\n\n​ ​​King Henry II. On his return in 1185 William joined the court of King Henry II, and served the Old King Henry as loyally as he had served the Young King Henry. In 1188 faced with an attempt by Philip II to seize the region of Berry, Henry II summoned the Marshal to join him. In the campaign, the king fell out with his heir Richard, Count of Poitou. Richard then allied himself with King Philip II against his own father. In 1189, while covering the flight of Henry II from Le Mans to Chinon, William caught Richard unawares and could have skewered him on his lance. Richard asked the William to spare his life. William killed Richard’s horse instead, to emphasise that he had had the choice.\n\nHenry died long afterwards, William supervised his funeral and burial, largely at his own cost, at Fontevraux abbey.\n\n​King Richard I. After Henry's death, William was welcomed at court by Richard, now King Richard I, who recognised and valued The Marshal's loyalty and military accomplishment. During Henry II’ last days Henry had promised William the hand and estates of Isabel de Clare, but had not completed the marriage arrangements. Richard confirmed the offer and later in 1189, at the age of 43, the Marshal married Isabel, the 17-year-old daughter and heir of Richard Strongbow. Her father had been Earl of Pembroke, and William acquired large estates in England, Wales, Normandy and Ireland. He did not immediately receive Pembroke and the title of earl, which had been taken into the king's hands in 1154, but he was granted them in 1199. This marriage transformed the landless knight into one of the richest men in the kingdom, reflecting his power and prestige at court. William ​and Isabel had five sons and five daughters. William made improvements to his wife's lands, including extensive additions to Pembroke Castle and Chepstow Castle.\n\nWilliam was included in the council of regency which King Richard appointed on his departure for the Third Crusade in 1190. He took the side of John, the king's brother, when John controversially expelled the justiciar, William Longchamp, from the kingdom. William soon discovered that the interests of John did not always coincide with those of King Richard or the good of the realm. In 1193 he joined the barons loyal to Richard in making war on John. William’s elder brother was John’s Seneschal, and naturally sided with John. In spring 1194, during the course of hostilities, John Marshal was killed defending Marlborough. Richard allowed William to succeed his brother in the hereditary marshalship, and his paternal honor of Hamstead Marshall. William was now William, Marshal of England. William the Marshal served King Richard in his wars in Normandy against King Philip II. On Richard's deathbed the king designated Marshal as custodian of Rouen and of the royal treasure during the interregnum.\n\nKing Henry III. Before John’s death, the majority of the great barons had decided to overthrow him, and would almost certainly have succeeded if they had had William's support. As it was they had invited Prince Louis of France to take the throne of England, and Louis was now in England with an army and the support of most of the barons. In control of most of the country, Louis was crowned King of England in Westminster Abbey.\n\nOn his own initiative William had Henry III crowned and voluntarily re-issued the Great Charter, Magna Carta, under his own seal, taking the precaution of having the papal legate seal it as well. As he was militarily weak, this had little effect in bringing back the rebel barons, so the civil war continued. In spite of his age (he was now around 70 years old) William prosecuted a war against Prince Louis, his French army and most of the English barons. At the battle of Lincoln he charged ​and fought at the head of his loyalist army, leading them to victory over a larger incumbent army, and killing his own cousin. Now the rebel barons had to think again. Before, they had planned to replace an incompetent and capricious king. Now they had a new anointed English king, whose who had done no wrong, and whose right was unquestioned, with the most respected knight in Christendom as his Regent. The indomitable William was preparing to besiege Louis in London when Hubert de Burgh won a naval engagement against Louis’s fleet in the straits of Dover. Louis was deprived of his much-needed reinforcements. The game was up. William again reissued Magna Carta in 1217, again on his own initiative and again under his own seal. The rebels no longer had a cause or a viable alternative king. Louis had been comprehensively outmaneuvered, both militarily and diplomatically. It seems never to have occurred to him to offer to issue Magna Carta. The last few rebel barons returned to William, and Louis's claim was finished. On September 11, 1217, Marshal negotiated the Treaty of Lambeth which ended the civil war and the French invasion. William was criticized at the time for the generosity of the terms he accorded to Louis and the rebels in September 1217; but the consensus now is that his action represented, as usual, sound statesmanship. (Henry III, who had had his own doubts, would eventually realize this and would reissue Magna Carta again in 1225 and in 1229)\n\nWithout the Marshal's prestige the Plantagenate dynasty might well not have survived the disastrous reign of John. While no one would trust John, everyone could trust William. Respected by all, the international sporting super-star had become the Churchill of his day.\n\nWilliam Marshal's health failed him in February 1219. In March he realised that he was dying. He summoned his eldest son, also called William, and his household knights, and left the Tower of London for his estate at Caversham in Oxfordshire, near Reading. There he called a meeting of the barons, King Henry III, the papal legate, the royal justiciar (Hubert de Burgh), and Peter des Roches, Bishop of Winchester and the young King's guardian. William rejected the Bishop's claim to the regency and entrusted it instead to the papal legate. Fulfilling the vow he had made while on crusade, he was inducted into the order of the Knights Templar on his deathbed. He died on 14 May 1219 at Caversham, and was buried in the Temple Church in London.\n\nAlthough William himself is largely forgotten, you can still find vestiges of his role in English, Welsh, Irish and Norman history. For one thing you will find him in dozens of films and plays, often without his name being mentioned. He is the Earl of Pembroke in William Shakespeare's historical play King John. He makes an appearance in The Lion in Winter. (Both the 1968 and 2003 versions). Many events in his life were incorporated into the 2001 film A Knight's Tale. He is a major character in Ridley Scott's Robin Hood. Played by William Hurt he tries to convince King John to agree to the Magna Carta. Elizabeth Chadwick has written two excellent novels about his life.\n\nYou can see his great castles such as Carlow Castle in Ireland, and Pembroke Castle with its great tower, and Chepstow Castle in Wales. His grave is unknown but you can still see his tomb effigy in the Temple Church in London. And one other reminder: England is not today ruled from Paris, as it would certainly have been without the Marshal’s authority and prestige to fill the power vacuum left by an incompetent king 800 years ago. And of course we still have Magna Carta - not the failed peace treaty of 1215 sealed by John under duress and annulled by the Pope - but the one still valid in English law, issued voluntarily on behalf of the king, on the initiative of and under the seal of William Marshal."
