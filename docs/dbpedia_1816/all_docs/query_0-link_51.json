        "text": "This article is about heirs to the Scottish throne until 1707. For heirs since the Union of Scotland and England in 1707, see List of heirs to the British throne.\n\nThis is a list of the individuals who were, at any given time, considered the next in line to inherit the throne of Scotland, should the incumbent monarch die. Those who actually succeeded (at any future time) are shown in bold. Stillborn children and infants surviving less than a month are not included.\n\nIt may be noted that although the Crown could pass through the female line (for example to the House of Dunkeld in 1034), in the High Middle Ages it is doubtful whether a queen regnant would have been accepted as ruler.\n\nSignificant breaks in the succession, where the designated heir did not in fact succeed (due to usurpation, conquest, revolution, or lack of heirs) are shown as breaks in the table below.\n\nThe symbols +1, +2, etc. are to be read \"once (twice, etc.) removed in descendancy\", i.e., the child or grandchild (etc.) of a cousin of the degree specified. The symbols -1, -2, etc. indicate the converse relationship, i.e., the cousin of a parent or grandparent (etc.).\n\n1124 to 1290[]\n\nTemplate:Original research section\n\nHeir Status Relationship to
