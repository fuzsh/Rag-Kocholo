        "text": "In December 1165, King Malcolm IV of Scotland lay dying. Twenty-four years old and deeply religious, he would later be known by the epithet “the Maiden” for his purity and staunch Christian beliefs. Despite not lacking for personal bravery, and being plagued by internal problems in Scotland, his had been a reign of general peace with England, with Malcolm ceding his claim to Northumbria and Cumbria and even being knighted by the English king. All this was to change however, as his death brought to the throne his younger brother William, a man of very different character.\n\nThe new King William had a rather more aggressive foreign policy than his brother for a start. He strongly re-asserted Scotland’s claim to Northumbria and Cumbria, taking advantage of Henry II’s family problems in the Great Revolt to invade in the name of the English king’s sons. Unfortunately for William however, Henry was not so easily cowed; with an empire at his back (he owned more of France than the King of France did) and an unmatched reputation for military prowess throughout Europe, he had soon crushed the revolt, despite the huge number of enemies racked against him, and William’s Scottish troops with it. This resulted in the humiliating Treaty of Falaise, which acknowledged the English king as Scotland’s overlord and ceded several important castles to Henry. Nevertheless, William did not cease to threaten England, and became so hated by Henry that even the mere mention of his name in a good way would send the English king into a fit of uncontrollable rage. The treaty was overturned for the sum of ten thousand marks on Henry’s death however, as part of Richard the Lionheart’s attempts to raise funds for his crusade, but although William remained on peaceful terms with Richard, the accession of his brother John renewed Scottish aggression.\n\nWilliam also turned his attention to more domestic troubles, smoothing out the wrinkles in the Scottish justice system and crushing rebellions against Royal authority. He also continued the work of his grandfather, King David, inviting more Anglo-Norman nobles North, founding new burghs, and establishing religious centres, such as Arbroath Abbey. A later chronicler, John of Fordun named him a “lion of justice”, but William became the Lion in more ways than one, as he was probably also the first King to use the Lion Rampant as the Royal Standard.\n\nWilliam the Lion died in 1214, at Stirling, the second-longest reigning independent Scottish monarch, sitting on the throne for around forty-nine years. Though perhaps foolish in his obsession with invading the North of England, his reign was one of considerable progress, helping to establish Scotland as a credible medieval kingdom and he was certainly one of the more memorable of the Canmore dynasty. The Lion was succeeded by his son Alexander II, and his successors have flown the Lion Rampant as their personal standard ever since."
