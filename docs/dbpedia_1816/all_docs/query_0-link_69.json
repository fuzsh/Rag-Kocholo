        "text": "The rock on which the Castle stands is as remarkable at close quarters as it is from a distance. The conglomerate is known as a 'pudding stone' and consists large rocks and pebbles held in an immensely strong cementing matter, like raisins in a fruitcake. It was forced to the surface of the earth during the Silurian period and the cementing matter is so tough that faults or cracks do not pass between the pebbles and their binding material, but straight through the pebbles themselves.\n\nEvidence of Picts living on the sea stack of Dunnicaer, just north of where the Castle is situated today, has been found by archaeologists from the University of Aberdeen. Carbon dating shows this to be the oldest Pictish fort ever discovered, in fact the name ‘dun’ is Pictish for ‘fort’. It is not known exactly how long ago the site was originally inhabited, it is believed that the Picts established it between 5000BC and 700AD.\n\nIn the first of these struggles, after the invasion of Scotland by English forces, William Wallace attacks an English garrison at Dunnottar, taking it back under Scottish control. Legend has it that Wallace showed no mercy to the soldiers and set fire to the Chapel where they had taken refuge, condemning all inside to a terrible death. Others were driven over the cliff edges, with no survivors.\n\nDuring the war between Scotland, England and Ireland in the mid-1640s, known as the War of Three Kingdoms, King Charles II is a guest of the 7th Earl Marischal. The young King’s arrival to Scotland prompts an invasion by the Parliamentary Army, led by Oliver Cromwell. Dunnottar Castle plays a vital role in the safekeeping of the Scottish crown jewels, the Honours of Scotland.\n\nThe Honours of Scotland are on display at Edinburgh Castle, Edinburgh.\n\nFollowing the 10th Earl Marischal’s forfeiture of his title and lands and after 400 years of Dunnottar being the seat of Clan Keith, it is sold by the Government to the York Building Company. Everything of any value was removed including, floors, ceilings and all furniture leaving just a shell.\n\nThe Black Hill was gifted by Lord and Lady Cowdray to the local community for the Stonehaven War Memorial. It was designed by the Stonehaven architect, John Ellis, and the fundraising for building the monument was organised by locals. It is unique in that it can be seen from most parts of Stonehaven and the surrounding area.\n\nThe structure is an incomplete round temple and was intentionally designed as such to be a reminder of the loss of life and incompleteness of a full life of those who died in the Wars. An inscription carved into the stone at the top of the temple is written: \"One by one death challenged them, they smiled in his grim visage and refused to be dismayed\".\n\nToday, the Castle is one of Scotland’s most popular and spectacular tourist attractions, welcoming over 135,000 visitors in 2019. We were delighted to give The Duke and Duchess of Rothesay, as The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall are known when in Scotland, a tour of the Castle in October 2019.\n\nThe rock on which the Castle stands is as remarkable at close quarters as it is from a distance.
