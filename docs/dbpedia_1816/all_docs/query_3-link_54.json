        "text": "William I, king of Scots (d. 1214)\n\nManuscript references:\n\nDuke of Atholl, Blair Castle, Athole Charters, vol. 1, no. 1.\n\n‘Athole Charters’ refers to a notebook in the Blair Castle muniment room, which was the result of a process whereby Sir William Fraser took the earliest documents out of various files which had been arranged according to lands, and organised them chronologically instead. This work was done in preparation for a volume on the Dukes of Atholl, which was never completed. The duke apparently was not happy with Fraser’s proposed price for the work.\n\nPrinted editions:\n\nRegesta Regum Scottorum, vol. II: The Acts of William I King of Scots 1165-1214, ed. G.W.S. Barrow with W.W. Scott. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1971, no. 206\n\nSir William Fraser, The Chiefs of Grant, vol. III, Edinburgh, 1883, no. 1 (with facsimile)"
