        "text": "The Stuarts\n\nUnion of Scottish and English Crowns\n\nThe Stuarts were the first kings of the United Kingdom.\n\nScotland provided England with a new line of kings, the Stuarts. They were to bring disaster to the nation for, coming from Scotland where royal power had not been curbed by Parliament, they had no understanding of the more democratic ways that had developed in England.\n\nJames I 1603 - 1625\n\nCharles I 1625 - 1649\n\nCharles II 1660 - 1685\n\nJames II 1685 - 1688\n\nWilliam III 1688 - 1702 and Queen Mary II 1688 - 1694\n\nQueen Anne 1702 - 1714\n\nJames I 1603 - 1625\n\nJames was the son of Mary, Queen of Scots.

He was the first monarch to rule both countries and the first to call himself 'King of Great Britain'. However it was not until 1707 that an act of Parliament formally brought the two countries together.\n\nJames had been King of Scotland for twenty-nine years when he acceded to the English throne.\n\nIn 1605 the Gunpowder Plot was hatched: Guy Fawkes and his friends, Catholics, tried to blow up the Houses of Parliament, but were captured before they could do so.\n\nThe Gun Powder Plot\n\nJames authorised the translation of the King James Bible.

They all escaped, but London was scandalized and the king was forced to flee the city.\n\nThe war between the Roundheads (supporters of parliament) and the Cavaliers (supporters of the King) began.\n\nThe Civil War led to the trial and execution of Charles I, the exile of his son Charles II, and the replacement of the English monarchy with first the Commonwealth of England (1649–1653) and then with a Protectorate (1653–1659), under the personal rule of Oliver Cromwell, the Lord Protector.\n\nThe Stuarts line Restored (The Restoration)\n\nCharles II 1660 - 1685\n\nCharles was called the Merry Monarch.
