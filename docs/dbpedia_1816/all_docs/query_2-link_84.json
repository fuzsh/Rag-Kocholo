Henry hoped that his friend Becket would help him to reduce the power of the church. 1162 Church Reforms Henry accused the clergy of being too lenient in the punishment of wrongdoers within their own ranks. He also ordered that appeals to Rome, which had been allowed by Stephen, were to cease. Oct 1163 Council of Westminster As part of his desire to reform the church Henry demanded that clerics who had committed crimes should be unfrocked and handed over to the lay courts for punishment. Becket strongly opposed this move. 30th Jan 1164 Constitution of Clarendon This was a clear statement of the King’s customary rights over the church. The document was comprised of sixteen articles that laid out the degree to which the pope had authority and also the customary rights enjoyed by the King over the church. The document required that the bishops promise to observe these customs in good faith. 1164 Conflict with Becket Becket and the bishops refused to approve the Constitution of Clarendon and turned against Henry vigorously defending their ecclesiastical rights. The struggle between Henry and Becket grew and by the end of the year Becket had been exiled. 2nd Jan 1166 Assize of Clarendon This introduced measures for the trial by royal judges of those suspected of serious crimes.

He brought with him an authorisation from the Pope for the excommunication of all bishops who had supported Henry during Becket’s exile and all barons who had profited from his exile. 29th December 1170 Murder of Thomas Becket Henry’s heated words “will no-one rid me of this turbulent priest!” were taken literally by four of his knights. Anxious to win the kings favour they rode to Canterbury and murdered Becket in his own cathedral. 1171-1172 Wales Henry reached an agreement with Rhys ap Gruffyd that he should become known as Lord Rhys and would be recognised as the effective ruler of Wales in return for loyalty to the King. 1171-1172 Ireland Richard de Claire, nicknamed Strongbow, had married King Dermot’s daughter and inherited his kingdom. Strongbow wanted to form an independent Norman state but Henry intervened and prevented this. 1172 Bull of Laudabiliter This papal bull issued in 1155 gave the support of the Pope to Henry to conquer Ireland, reform the Irish church and make it subject to Canterbury. 1173 Normandy Henry the young king, supported by his mother, Eleanor of Aqitaine, and his brothers, Richard, Geoffrey and John, joined forces with Louis VII of France, gained the support of William (the lion) of Scotland and rose against Henry II.\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...\n\nHenry was forced to leave control of England to his justiciar Richard de Luci while he went to defend Normandy against his sons.\n\n13th June 1174 Battle of Alnwick William (the lion) of Scotland was defeated and captured at Alnwick.
