        "text": "The period of known as the Stone Age: hunter-gatherers hunted for fish and wild animals and gathered fruit, nuts, plants, roots and shells.\n\nThe first indications of humans in Scotland occurring only after the ice retreated in the 11th millennium.\n\nSea levels were lower than at present due to the large volume of ice. This meant that the Orkney archipelago and many of the Hebridean islands were attached to the mainland, as was the present-day island of Great Britain to Continental Europe.\n\nPeople first started cultivating and claiming ownership of the land in Scotland in the Neolithic period. They built permanent shelters, made pottery and stone axes, and created tombs to house the remains of their ancestors.\n\nThe remains of domestic and ritual buildings from this time make up the heart of Neolithic Orkney World Heritage Site. Visit UNESCO for more information.\n\nThe arrival of metalworking signalled the start of the Bronze Age and a period of technological change. Ornaments made from exotic materials (such as gold, amber or jet) show that people were displaying their wealth and status, and that social hierarchies were starting to form.\n\nOccupation of what may be the first Crannog or artificial islet residence, on the islet Eilean Domhnuill on Loch Olabhat in North Uist.\n\nThe myth goes: Scota was a Queen of Scotland, AND the daughter of an Egyptian Pharaoh. She features in the foundation myth of Ireland and Scotland, and who Scotland is named after.\n\nHer husband was a Greek king Gaythelos – hence Gaelic, and their son was known as Hiber – which gives us Hibernia.\n\nAccording to myth, this royal family was expelled from Egypt during a time of great uprising. They sailed west, settling initially in Spain before travelling to Ireland and then on to the west coast of Scotland. This same race of people eventually battled and triumphed over the Picts to become the Scots – the people who united this country.\n\nThough legends vary, all agree that a Scota was the ancestor of the Gaels, who traced their ancestry to Irish invaders, called Scotti, who settled in Argyll and Caledonia, regions which later came to be known as Scotland after their founder.\n\nIn 383, the usurper Magnus Maximus withdrew troops from northern and western Britain, probably leaving local warlords in charge.\n\nDespite building two impressive fortifications – Hadrian’s Wall to defend the northern border, and the Antonine Wall across Central Scotland to advance it forward.\n\nThe Romans never truly conquered Caledonia. Unable to defeat the Caledonians and Picts, the Romans eventually withdrew.\n\nMuch of the 60km Antonine Wall survives and it was inscribed as a World Heritage Site\n\n10 March 520 - St Kessog, the original patron saint of Scotland, is killed at Bandry, on the western shore of Loch Lomond.\n\nSaint Kessog was an Irish missionary active in the Lennox area and southern Perthshire. Son of the king of Cashel in Ireland, Kessog is said to have worked miracles, even as a child.\n\nUsing Monks' Island in Loch Lomond as his headquarters, he evangelized the surrounding area until he was martyred, supposedly at Bandry, where a heap of stones was known as St Kessog's Cairn.\n\nSt Kessog's church is in Luss.\n\n795 is the first recorded Viking raid, on Iona, which is raided twice more in the following decade.\n\nVikings were accomplished seamen at this point in history, and around 800 AD they began migrating from Norway and Denmark, crossing the treacherous North Sea to trade and settle in Scotland.\n\nWhile Vikings began to settle in the west, the Picts were forging a new kingdom; the Kingdom of Alba.\n\nKenneth MacAlpin becomes King of the Scots of Dalriada; and later becomes King of the Picts of Pictland as well, unifying the main groups in Scotland north of the Forth-Clyde line for the first time within the Kingdom of Alba.\n\nKenneth I began a campaign to seize all of Scotland and assimilate the Picts, for which he was posthumously nicknamed An Ferbasach (\"The Conqueror\")\n\nKenneth I is traditionally considered the founder of Scotland, which was then known as Alba.\n\nKing Aedh was king for barely a year before he was killed by his cousin Giric at Strathallan, North of Stirling.\n\nGiric became a major influence in the reign of Aedh’s nephew Eochaid, hence the “joint ruling”.\n\nEochaid was the grandson of Kenneth MacAlpin, and son of the Strathclyde ruler Rhun whose father had been slain by Constantine.\n\nIn 889 Eochaid and Giric were expelled by Donald II, ending the influence of Strathclyde which then became a Scottish sub-kingdom.\n\n889: Kings Eochaid and Giric are succeeded by Donald II.\n\nDonald (Domnall mac Causantín) was the son of Constantine I. He annexed Srathclyde, establishling himself as King of the Scots.\n\nHe had some success against the Vikings in the West, but the North was dominated by Viking Sigurd the Mighty based in Orkney.\n\nDonald II was killed in 900, possibly murdered, at Donnattar near Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire.\n\nHe was buried on Iona\n\n900: Donald II is succeded by Constantine II (Constantín mac Áeda) - the son of King Aedh.\n\nHe was king for over 40 years.\n\nHe incorporated several Viking settlers into the emerging Kingdom of Scotland, but his reign was dominated by Viking raids and northern conquests by the Wessex Kings Athelstan and Edmund of England.\n\nBut, having been defeated in two battles, Constantine abdicated and lived out the rest of his life as a monk in the monastery at St. Andrews, Fife.\n\nIndulf (Ildulb mac Causantín) was Malcolm I’s cousin; the son of Constantine II.\n\nIt is interesting that Indulf is indeed a Norse name, and his sons also had Norse names (Olaf and Culen)\n\nHe was sub-king of Strathclyde during Malcolm I’s reign.\n\nWhen he became King, the influence of the Scots was extended into Lothian, and he briefly occupied Edinburgh from the Northumbrians.\n\nIndulf was killed in 962 in battle at Invercullen near Aberdeen during Viking challenges for Moray.\n\nKing Culen was killed in 971 in Lothian by Amdarch (Riderich), son of Donald of Strathclyde, in revenge for Culen raping Amdarch’s daughter.\n\nKenneth II (Cináed mac Maíl Coluim) was the son of Malcolm I.\n\nHe faced a challenge from Culen’s brother Olaf. The challenge was ended when Kenneth II had Olaf killed in 977.\n\nKennith II was killed near Fettercairn by Fenella, daughter of the Mormar of Angus, in revenge for killing her son (in battle).\n\nThe Battle of Monzievaird, 25 March 1005, takes place just north of Crieff. King Kenneth III and his son Giric are killed in the battle by his successor, Malcolm II (Kenneths cousin).\n\nThis rivalry contributed to the feud which resulted in Duncan, grandson of Malcolm II, being killed in 1040 by Macbeth who had married Kenneth’s grand daughter Gruoch (Lady Macbeth).\n\nMalcolm (Máel Coluim mac Cináeda) was the son of Kenneth II.\n\nMalcolm extended Scottish rule into Lothian and Northumbrian lands down to Berwick. In 1032 King Cnut King of England secured the southern part of Northumbria for England settling the border between Scotland and England.\n\nMalcolm had no son so he had the grandson of Kenneth III murdered to ensure that his daughter son Duncan became heir to the throne.\n\nMalcolm was assassinated at Glamis Castle, proceeding battle injuries, in 1034.\n\n25 November 1034: Malcolm II is assassinated at Glamis and is succeeded by Duncan I. Duncan (Donnchad mac Crínáin) was the grandson Malcolm II. He was the first of the House of Dunkeld.\n\nThe hereditary rights of his two sons Malcolm and Donald were threatened by Macbeth of Moray who claimed the kingdom. The feud was temporarily settled in 1040 when Duncan was fatally wounded in battle at Pitgaveny near Elgin by Macbeth, who then became king.\n\nDuncan’s sons escaped and both would later become kings.\n\n15 August 1040 Duncan I tries to impose his will on northern Scotland, but loses to Macbeth of Moray and Earl Thorfinn of Orkney at the Battle of Pitgaveny, near Elgin.\n\nDuncan is killed during the battle, and King Macbeth is crowned at Scone later in 1040.\n\nMacbeth (Mac Bethad mac Findlaích) was the grandson of Malcolm II.\n\nImmortalised forever in Shakespeare’s fictitious retelling, Macbeth is perhaps one of the best-known early Scottish kings.\n\nMacbeth ruled as King of Alba for 17 years, from 1040 to his death in battle in 1057.\n\nMacbeth was killed by Malcolm III in battle at Lumphanan in Mar, Aberdeenshire. His stepson Lulach became briefly king.\n\n15 August 1057: Malcolm Canmore, kills Macbeth at the Battle of Lumphanan; and kills king Lulach 8 months later.\n\nHe is crowned Malcolm III at Scone in 1058. Malcolm (Máel Coluim mac Donnchada), son of Duncan I, was known as Malcolm Cenn Mor or Canmore (meaning Big or Great Head). He was the first of the House of Canmore.\n\nPeace with the North was achieved through Malcolm’s marriage to the daughter of Thorfinn, Jarl of Orkney (a Jarl is a Norse or Danish chief).\n\nMalcolm’s second wife was Margaret, grand-daughter of Edmund King of England. She was a devout Christian who reformed the Celtic church through her familiarity with roman Christian practices, and was sanctified as St Margaret in 1250.\n\nMalcolm gave sanctuary to Saxons fleeing the advancing Normans following the victory of William I ‘The Conqueror’ at Hastings in 1066.\n\nMalcolm attacked Northumbria in 1070 and expanded his kingdom into Cumbria, but was swept aside by the forces of King William II as they marched into Scotland in 1092.\n\nAt Abernethy Malcolm was forced to submit to the Normans who took his son Duncan and brother-in-law into England as hostages. Malcolm launched another attack the following year but was killed in battle at Alnwick, Northumberland, and was buried at Tynemouth.\n\n13 November 1093: Malcolm III is killed, along with his eldest son, by Arkil Morel (steward of Bamburgh) under Robert de Mowbray, Earl of Northumbria.\n\nHis second wife: Queen Margaret dies of grief (and later becomes St Margaret).\n\nSo Malcolm is succeeded by his younger brother, Donald, who becomes Donald III and jointly rules with Malcolm's son Edmund.\n\nDonald III was called Domnall Bán or Donald Bane (Donald the Fair). He was in exile at the time of his bother’s death and rushed to claim the throne.\n\nThe Scots evict the many English who have gathered around the Anglicised court of Malcolm and Margaret, including their surviving children.\n\n1094: Duncan, second eldest son of Malcolm III (who has been a hostage with the English court since Abernethy), becomes Duncan II after defeating Donald III and Edmund with Norman/English help.\n\nHis reign was brief as he was killed a few months later at the Battle of Monthechin, Kincardine, by Donald whom he had deposed.\n\n1097: Edgar, another son of Malcolm III and Margaret, invades as the head of another Norman/English army and becomes King Edgar.\n\nEdgar has Donald III blinded and imprisoned. Donald died in prison at Rescobie, Forfarshire, in 1099. Edmund sent to a monastery.\n\nKing Edgars treaty with Magnus ‘Barefoot’ in 1098 allowed the Norse to regain many of the Western Isles. The marriage of his sister Edith to Henry I of England in 1100 brought peace and encouraged the settlement of Anglo Normans in the Scottish lowlands.\n\n8 January 1107: Edgar died unmarried and was succeeded by his younger brother Alexander I.\n\nAlexander (Alaxandair mac Maíl Coluim) was the 4th son of Malcolm III. He married Sybilla - the illegitimate daughter of Henry I. Sybilla was not well received by the Scots and said to ‘lack both beauty and modesty’.\n\nAlexander helped Henry I in his campaigns in Wales, and earned the name ‘The Fierce’ for the way in which he put down an uprising in Moray.\n\nHe sought to continue the work of his mother Margaret and introduced English style reforms into the Church and reform of civil government introducing the offices of chancellor and sheriffs.\n\nThe earliest known Scottish coins dated from his reign.\n\nHe died without legitimate children and was succeeded by his brother David I.\n\n23 April 1124: King Alexander I is succeeded by his younger brother, who becomes David I (the third of the son of Malcolm III and Margaret) to become King of Scots.\n\nHis impact on Scottish cultural development was considerable, and he is often known as David ‘The Saint’. He continued his brother’s introduction of reforms and introduced a feudal system and granted land to Anglo Norman incomers who soon anglicized the lowlands in Southern Scotland.\n\nNorman English became the dominant language of court (while Gaelic was still spoken in the Highlands, and Norse in the far North and Isles).\n\nDavid became involved in the struggle for succession in England, as he supported the succession of Henry I’s daughter the Empress Matilda. When Stephen usurped her and became king, David invaded England taking Carlisle and Newcastle before being defeated in the battle of the Standard near Northallerton, Yorkshire, in 1138. However Stephen faced with his own struggles in England granted David control of Northumbria under the Treaty of Durham in 1139 and recognised him as king of an independent Scotland.\n\nHis only son Henry died in 1152 leaving the succession to his young grandson Malcolm.\n\n9 December 1165: Malcolm IV dies, aged 24 and unmarried, and is succeeded by his younger brother William I.\n\nWilliam the Lionheart is nicknamed after his symbol, a red lion rampant on a yellow field that becomes the basis of one of Scotland's two flags.\n\nKing William I is crowned King of Scotland 24 December 1165.\n\nHe had a long reign but for much of it was subjugated by the English kings.\n\nKing Edward I of England oversees the selection between competing claims to the Scottish throne.\n\nScotland is without a king for 2 years.\n\n13 competitors are narrowed down to two. John Balliol is selected over Robert Bruce and is crowned King of Scotland on 30 November 1292.\n\nJohn Balliol was the descendant of David of Huntingdon – the younger brother of Malcolm IV.\n\nIt was a short and difficult reign, caught between the English King and the Scottish nobles who humiliated him. He was called Toom Tabbard (‘Empty Coat’).\n\n8 July 1296: King John Balliol resigns his kingdom to Edward I.\n\nEdward I takes the Stone of Scone back to London after the Scottish nobility have signed their loyalty to him.\n\nJohn Balliol was forced to abdicate on 10th July 1296 and there followed a 10 year interregnum during which Scotland was ruled remotely by Edward. John Balliol was imprisoned in the Tower of London but freed in 1299 to go into retirement in Normandy where he died around 1313.\n\n11 September 1297: Edward I’s army planned to cross the River Forth at Stirling Bridge; the Scots seized the opportunity to attack at the crossing of the River Forth, the Stirling Bridge, forcing the English army to retreat.\n\nWilliam Wallace and Andrew Murray comprehensively defeat the English army. Murray subsequently dies of wounds suffered during the battle.\n\nAt the battle of Stirling Bridge, William Wallace earns his place in the history books forever.\n\nRead more in our list of battles\n\n10 February 1306: Robert the Bruce (grandson of the Robert Bruce who had competed with John Balliol for the crown in 1292), murders John III Comyn, the Red Comyn, head of one of the most powerful familes in Scotland and his only rival as future king.\n\nRobert the Bruce crowns himself King Robert I.\n\nKing Robert the Bruce is the 19th great-grandfather to Elizabeth II - current Queen of England\n\nKing Robert was twice defeated in 1306, at Methven, near Perth, on June 19, and at Dalry, near Tyndrum, Perthshire, on August 11.\n\nHis wife and many of his supporters were captured, and three of his brothers executed.\n\nBut members of Clan Buchanan aided Roberts escape, moving him to the remote island of Rathlin off the north Irish coast.\n\nA letter written in Latin, signed by Scottish Barons and Nobles, and sent to Pope John XXII.\n\nThe Declaration proclaimed Scotland’s status as an independent sovereign state and have the Pope recognise Robert the Bruce as King of Scotland (and remove Roberts excommunication, following his murdering of Red Comyn in a church).\n\nThough its effect was largely symbolic, the powerful declaration remains an important document in Scottish history – defining the relationship between the Scottish King and the Scots people.\n\nRead more\n\nRobert Bruce died at his house in Cardross of a serious illness described by some as leprosy.\n\n7 June 1329: Robert the Bruce is succeeded by his five year old son, David II.\n\nDavid was married at the age of 4 to Joan the 7 year old daughter of King Edward II. David II was crowned at Scone in 1331.\n\nDavid II flees to France as guests of King Phillip VI.\n\nIn 1341 the Scottish nobles under Robert Stewart gained the upper hand and David II was able to return to Scotland and were restored to the throne.\n\nFive years later in 1346 David attacked England in support of France while Edward III was away fighting in France. The Scots were defeated at Nevillie’s Cross near Durham where David was injured and taken prisoner. He was held captive in England for 11 years until 1357 when under the Treaty of Berwick he was allowed to return to Scotland for a ransom of 100,000 merks ‘A King’s Ransom’. The full amount was never paid.\n\n22 February 1371: King David II is succeeded by his nephew, Robert Stewart who becomes King Robert II, of the Stewart dynasty that is to rule Scotland for most of the next three hundred years.\n\nRobert II is the grandson of Robert the Bruce.\n\nHe was 54 when he succeeded to the throne, but he was weak king and did not rule well over the nobles who were critical of him leading to a loss of prestige of the crown.\n\nNovember 1384: An ailing Robert II is sidelined in favour of his own eldest son and heir, John, Earl of Carrick, who becomes Guardian of the Kingdom.\n\nJohn was timid, retiring and badly injured following a kick from a horse. He took the name Robert because his name John was considered a bad omen after the hated John Balliol. So, he became known as King Robert III\n\nThe reign was beset by problems including rivalry between the Highlanders, his brothers and the lords of the isles. His brother Robert Duke of Albany may have been responsible for the death of Robert III’s son David.\n\nJames I was 30 when he took over as king.\n\nJames arrests many members of the Albany family, descendents of his uncle, Robert.\n\nMurdoch and three others are executed and the family is virtually extinguished.\n\nJames I summons Alexander, Lord of the Isles and other highland clan chiefs to a meeting in Inverness, and has them arrested. Three are executed as an example, but others including Alexander are later released.\n\n11 June 1488: James III seeks to capture his eldest son, James (now Duke of Rothesay), who at 15 is becoming a focus for dissent in the kingdom.\n\nThe Scottish nobles became increasingly disaffected by James’ weakness and bisexuality, and when he conferred an earldom on his boyfriend John Ramsay they called for James’ 15 year old son James to be proclaimed king.\n\nFollowing the Battle of Sauchieburn the injured James III fled to Milltown where he was fatally stabbed by a man dressed as a priest.\n\nJames III son is named King James IV (age of 15), he is considered the first effective monarch of the House of Stewart.\n\nMay 1544: King Henry VIII of England commences a period of \"rough wooing\" designed to impose the marriage of his son to Mary Queen of Scots.\n\nKnown as the Treaty of Greenwich, but no sooner had the treaty been arranged than Catholic Scottish nobles opposed the plan and she was betrothed to Francis son of Henry II King of France.\n\nArmies invade from the south and from the sea near Edinburgh.\n\n24 April 1558: Fifteen year old Mary Queen of Scots marries fourteen year old Francoise, Dauphin of France in Paris. The wedding is accompanied by an agreement that will unify the crowns of Scotland and France if there are children of the marriage, and hand over the crown of Scotland to France if there are not.\n\nAugust 1560: The Scottish Parliament prohibits the practise of the Latin Mass in Scotland and denies the authority of the Pope, in effect implementing the Reformation across Scotland.\n\nThe Reformation was a turning point in Scottish history. At the religious level it signified the end of five hundred years of dominance by the Roman Church, leaving in its place a unique brand of radical Presbyterian Protestantism.\n\nAt the political level it broke centuries of close cultural and military links with France and replaced them with even closer, though often very uncomfortable, links with England.\n\nThe Treaty of Edinburgh (also known as the Treaty of Leith) was a treaty drawn up on 5 July 1560 between the Commissioners of Queen Elizabeth I of England with the assent of the Scottish Lords of the Congregation, and the French representatives of King Francis II of France (husband of Mary Queen of Scots) to formally conclude the siege of Leith and replace the Auld Alliance with France with a new Anglo-Scottish accord, while maintaining the peace between England and France agreed by the Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis.\n\n1567: James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, kidnaps Mary Queen of Scots and takes her to Dunbar Castle, where, assuming Mary is an unwilling participant, he rapes her.\n\nHowever, they agree to marry. 🧐\n\nJames Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell divorces his wife, Jean Gordon, to clear the way for his planned wedding to Mary, Queen of Scots.\n\nOn the 15 May 1567 Mary Queen of Scots marries the Earl of Bothwell in a Protestant wedding. They then flee from widespread dissent to Dunbar Castle.\n\nScottish nobles intent on retrieving Mary Queen of Scots from James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, meet the couple (with a thousand supporters). After a day long stand-off Mary agrees to the nobles' demands and sends Bothwell away. They never meet again.\n\n•\n\nMary is taken away to imprisonment in Lochleven Castle on an island in Loch Leven, near Kinross. Lords visit Mary Queen of Scots and insist she abdicates immediately or be killed. She abdicates.\n\nOne year old Charles James is crowned King James VI of Scotland in a Protestant ceremony\n\n2 May 1568: Mary Queen of Scots escapes from Lochleven Castle and revokes her abdication. She gathers an army and moves towards Dumbarton, but is defeated.\n\nMary Queen of Scots' rejects supporters' advice (to return to France) and chooses instead to flee to England and seek the mercy of her cousin, Queen Elizabeth, who still fears Mary might make a claim to the Crown of England.\n\n20 August 1589: James VI marries Anne of Denmark, daughter of King Frederik II of Denmark.\n\nThe marriage is by proxy and her subsequent efforts to sail to Scotland see her blown back by storm to Norway, allegedly as a result of witchcraft.\n\nWhen King James VI and Anne of Denmark finally return to Scotland, Anne is crowned Queen of Scotland and James begins a witch-hunt that will claim over a thousand lives in the following hundred years.\n\n24 March 1603: Queen Elizabeth I of England dies. Two days later the news reaches 36 year old James VI of Scotland that he is now also King James I of England.\n\nHe styles himself \"King of Great Britain\" and the crowns of Scotland and England are unified under the Stewart dynasty, though increasingly the family name is now spelled \"Stuart\".\n\nKing James VI of Scotland moves south to London to become James I of England.\n\n14 August 1641: Charles I visits Scotland in an effort to placate opposition and buy off critics. He ends up flailing. The weakness of Charles in Scotland leads to Catholic revolt in Ulster, only suppressed with help from Protestant troops from Scotland.\n\nCharles I, having failed to suppress or coerce the English Parliament by his will, takes it on by military might. The English Civil War begins.\n\nScotland offers to support the Parliamentary side in the Civil War in return for the acceptance by the English of a \"Solemn League and Covenant\", in effect exporting Presbyterianism to them.\n\nA Scottish Covenanter army of 20,000 men move south to support the Parliamentary Army.\n\nKing Charles appoints the Marquis of Montrose, who with other moderate Covenanters is now on the Royalist side, as head of Royalist forces in Scotland.\n\n10 June 1688: James VII/II and his wife Mary of Modena have a son, christened James Francis Edward. Many Scots - and English - are concerned by the prospect of a continuing Catholic Stewart dynasty.\n\nSo a group of Protestant nobles asks William of Orange to travel to England to overthrow King James VII/II. William of Orange’s is King James VII/II son-in-law (wife Mary is James VII/II's daughter) and until the birth of James Francis Edward was the heir to the throne.\n\nJames VII/II sails to France after a largely bloodless coup by William and Mary. English convention declares that James VII/II has abdicated; and sets out the basis for Mary and William to succeed to the throne.\n\nA Scottish Convention is divided between Williamite supporters of William and Mary, and Jacobite supporters of James VII/II. But ultimately the Convention decides James has forfeited his right to the crown\n\nBut this leads to Jacobite unrest.\n\n26 June 1695: The establishment by an Act of the Scots Parliament of the \"Company of Scotland Trading to Africa and the Indies,\" which is better known as the \"Darien Company\" with powers to colonise and make trade treaties. The Scheme attracts between a quarter and a half of all available wealth in Scotland, to set up “new Caledonia”.\n\n16 September 1701: James VII/II dies in France. His claim to the throne and the Jacobite cause pass to his 13 year old son, James Francis Edward Stewart (to become known as \"The Pretender\").\n\nHe is recognised by the French King as King James VIII/III of Great Britain, in effect declaring war on King William.\n\n1707\n\nThe Act of Union\n\nThe Scottish Parliament agrees the Treaty of Union by 110 votes to 67. The debate preceding it is carried out against a backdrop of growing anti-union unrest across Scotland. The outcome is driven by economic necessity, by overt compensation for Scotland's national debts and the losses of Darien investors, and, allegedly, by covert bribes for key participants.\n\nThe Scottish Parliament adjourns, and is dissolved three days later. It will not reconvene for 292 years, until 12 May 1999.\n\nQueen Anne becomes the first sovereign of the Kingdom of Great Britain.\n\nThe Protestant Religion and Presbyterian Church Act was an Act of the pre-Union Parliament of Scotland which was passed to ensure that the status of the Church of Scotland would not be affected by the Union with England.\n\n“Presbyterian” derived their name from the presbyterian form of church government by representative assemblies of elders.\n\n1 August 1714: Queen Anne dies and is succeeded by George, Elector of Hanover (Germany), under the terms of the 1701 Act of Settlement.\n\nIE: Anne's only child died at age 11 on 30 July 1700. To address the succession crisis and preclude a Catholic restoration, the Parliament of England enacted the Act of Settlement 1701, which provided that, failing the issue of Anne and of William III, the Crown of England and Ireland would go to Sophia, Electress of Hanover, and her Protestant descendants. Sophia was the granddaughter of James VI/I through his daughter Elizabeth, who was the sister of Anne's grandfather Charles I.\n\nBUT, the Electress Sophia had died on 28 May (two months before Anne), so the Electress's son, George, Elector of Hanover, succeeded…\n\nGeorge I cannot speak English and is not popular in England.\n\n6 September 1715: John Erskine, the 23rd Earl of Mar raises a standard for \"King James VIII\" that attracts widespread support in north-east Scotland.

The ship carrying his military supplies and gold, is badly damaged in an encounter with a Royal Navy ship and has to turn back. So Charles Edward Stuart lands at Loch nan Uamh on the mainland with just eight supporters, no supplies, and no funds.\n\nOn 4 September 1745 The Jacobite army takes Perth and two weeks later they take Edinburgh without a fight.\n\nCharles Edward Stuart moves south (despite views among his supporters that it would be better to retain Scotland and wait for a promised French invasion of England) and take Carlisle.\n\n4 December 1745 Charles Edward Stuart and the Jacobite army reach Derby (150 miles north of London). In London, there is total panic and it is reported that George II is preparing to flee.\n\nBut In the absence of the promised French, and in the light of very limited support from English Jacobites, Charles withdraws from Derby and retreats into Scotland, taking Stirling.\n\nBut Charles Edward Stuart, who is increasingly drunk since Derby, fails to take strategic advantages.\n\nThe Jacobites now face of increasingly strong government forces under the Duke of Cumberland.\n\n16 April 1746: The Jacobite and Government armies meet at the Battle of Culloden, east of Inverness.\n\nThe Jacobites are defeated.\n\nBonnie Prince Charlie flees to Arisaig where he stays for a week.

In the General Election that follows in May 1979, Margaret Thatcher becomes Prime Minister of a Conservative government.\n\n11 September 1997: A referendum asks Scots two questions. The first is whether there should be a separate Parliament for Scotland. The second is whether that Parliament should have the power to vary levels of taxation.\n\n74.3% vote yes to the first question, and 63.5% vote yes to the second question.\n\nIn 2012, the Edinburgh Agreement was signed by Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond and UK Prime Minister David Cameron. It paved the way for a once in a generation referendum on Scottish independence in 2014 by confirming the Scottish Parliament’s power to hold a vote that will be respected by both governments.\n\nOn the 18 September 2014, the people of Scotland voted. In response to the question, 'Should Scotland be an independent country', 1,617,989 (45%) voted Yes and 2,001,926 (55%) voted No."
