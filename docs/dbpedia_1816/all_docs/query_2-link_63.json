        "text": "That Otto did not care more about heraldic protocol and about the feelings of his subjects, was due both to his upbringing and his descent. He was more Anglo-Norman that German, having been raised in England where his father, Henry the Lion, erstwhile Duke of Saxony and Bavaria, lived in exile after forfeiting his territories by his opposition to Emperor Frederick the Redbeard. Otto, a grandson of King Henry II of England through Henry’s daughter Mathilda, who had married Henry the Lion, was the favourite nephew of King Richard I, who oversaw his knightly education and bestowed high favours on him. The young man, being unusually tall for his time, excelled in the martial arts to the delight of Richard the Lionheart, whom fate had denied him.\n\nIn 1196 Richard created Otto Count of Poitou and Duke of Aquitaine, tantamount to Viceroy, of the English possessions in France with the exception of Normandy (which Richard retained for himself). Presumably, the King assigned arms to Otto on that occasion, and indeed a seal (1197) of Otto as Count of Poitou has survived.3 It is tantalising, however, that his arms are not visible, because we see Otto, on horseback, riding from left to right displaying only the back of his shield.4 Considering the fondness of Richard for his nephew he may even have planned to make Otto his successor on the English throne 5 because he was averse to his brother John or, eventually, of John’s offspring succeeding him. In 1198, however, Otto was called into an even higher rank, being elected King of the Romans by the anti-Hohenstaufen party in Germany.\n\nJust when exactly Otto adopted his Anglo-German arms is uncertain. The first pictorial evidence dates from 1209, but it is likely he has already employed the design c 1198, possibly in order to maintain a claim to the English throne. Indeed this may be the reason why he chose to combine the English lions with the Imperial eagle. Matthew Paris, who depicts Otto’s arms twice, reports that he assumed them at his coronation in 1198 “out of love for the King of England”. But even apart from his uncle’s predisposition towards him, as a grandson of Henry II Otto ranked high in the line of English succession.\n\nOtto had an older brother, Henry, Count Palatine, who also bore lions passant, but in his case two not three 6 as is depicted on his seals dating from around 1196,7 and these arms later became those of the Duchy of Brunswick, and lasted until 1918. It is just possible that Otto himself may have borne two lions – and in later depictions of his German bearings he is indeed accorded two8 but this most probably reflects Brunswick’s local tradition rather than historical fact.\n\nThe German evidence indicates that by 1198 two versions of arms with lions passant guardant – one with three, one with two lions – were well established and existed simultaneously. Hence the question arises as to which was the senior version? Among British historians, conventional wisdom hold that the English Royal Arms developed in a seemingly natural way: one, two, three, which sounds reasonable, but in fact the evolution was quite complex.\n\nThe first King believed to have borne an armorial device, namely a single lion rampant, was Henry I, who reigned from 1100 to 1135, earlier royal arms being merely attributed. However, no arms of Henry I have come to light. Adrian Ailes, who has written the most exhaustive monograph 9 on the origins of the Royal Arms of England, takes it for granted that Henry II (1154-1189) bore either a single lion rampant, or two lions passant, (maybe guardant – in the early days little emphasis was put on such details), and perhaps even three lions passant guardant, and that he either changed his arms twice, or that he used two or three versions concurrently.10\n\nA lot of important reasoning has been brought forward to support the alleged arms of Henry II,11 and certainly that monarch was aware of the symbolism of the lion in Arthurian and other legends and several of his relatives are known to have borne lion arms of some kind or other. But, as far as Henry II himself is concerned, unfortunately no arms of his have ever been found.12 Even given the varying survival rates of historical documents this is strange, The king certainly issued a great many grants and warrants so had he used an armorial seal, at least one or two impressions should have been preserved.\n\nBut the sad fact is that we lack any real proof of arms borne by Henry. It is often overlooked that heraldry, still rather new in his day did not spread from the top of the social ladder downwards, but from somewhere in the middle – from the landed gentry and the military, both downwards and upwards. High personages like kings or emperors assumed arms only relatively late.13 Only when heraldry gained wide popularity did it become unthinkable that a noble person should not possess arms and hence legendary heroes like King David or Alexander the Great, and even the three wise men, Jesus Christ, and Death, were attributed coats of arms. Only in and after the late 12th century, several decades after the birth of heraldry did sovereigns begin to identify themselves by heraldic display.\n\nThe first English king who can be proven to have borne arms is Richard I (1189-99). Two great seals of him still exist. On the first Richard bears a shield with a single lion rampant.\n\nThis was replaced by a new Great Seal, the matter is anything but simple. To start with, the date of adoption of the three lions by Richard is not quite certain. Although there is written testimony that he had a new seal made for him in 1195, he continued to use his first seal. Of his second seal, the first impression that has survived dates only from 1198.\n\nIt is strange that three years elapsed before we find any proof of Richard actually using his new seal – so accordingly, we cannot be quite sure whether the three lions seal was indeed the instrument of 1195. The matter is made more complicated because some British scholars believe that Richard also bore two lions combatant, based on the fact that on his first seal the lion rampant is facing sinister. But this must not be over interpreted. Other early seals exist showing beasts so facing,15 and it is always possible that the engraver chose to make the lion face as it did to symbolically defy enemies.\n\nWhen further considering one lion rampant or three passant we must also bear in mind that in the 1190s the shield remained kite-shaped after the Norman style rather than heater-shaped style as was more popular later. Into such geometry a lion rampant fits nicely, as do three beasts passant in aesthetically pleasing fashion,16 but two lions passant do not – even appearing to “float” surrounded by empty space.\n\nIt seems reasonable to suggest that Richard’s younger brother John as Lord of Ireland and “son of the king of England”17 as styled on his seal, bore two lions because he was a junior member of the Plantagenet line and his cognisance represented, not an earlier stage in the development of the Royal arms, but an indication of lower station in the ruling family. Reverting to Richard I, it is reasonable to ask why he changed his lion rampant coat for the three in pale? Adrian Ailes pointed out one of the possible motives was very prosaic: Richard may have changed in order to raise money by invalidating all former charters sealed with his first great seal and requiring all owners to have their grants confirmed. Another good reason might have been one-upmanship as it were. Richard could have felt the need to top his brother’s coat. Relations between the two were strained, John had been a contender for the throne and thus had to be publicly reminded of his proper place, one step behind the monarch. Matthew Paris, in his Historia Minor Anglorum, compiled in 1250/53, offered a different explanation: the King of England bore three leopards because he is king, duke, and count. But Matthew also attributed to William the Conqueror, who lived a century before the dawn of heraldry.18 We may dismiss any notion that the three lions represented the territories of the Angevin empire: England, Normandy, and Aquitaine (or Anjou). Arms in those days were not yet territorial, but personal. And in any case the two-lion coat of Normandy was associated with that country only much later\n\nIt is well to keep in mind that King Richard spent most of his reign abroad. Where, then, could he have been inspired or in any other way have been induced to choose his unique coat of arms, the impressive three lions passant? In 1192 Richard was returning from the third crusade. On his way home he was captured by Duke Leopold of Austria whom he had gravely insulted in the Holy Land. The Duke turned him over to Emperor Henry VI and Richard swore an oath of fealty to his captor, so England was from now on, at least in theory, a fief of the Empire, or rather, along the lines of feudal society, Richard was now a vassal of his new liege lord, the Emperor. This was in no way dishonourable. Feudal relationships were personal and did not diminish the feudatory’s dignity, but it might have had a lasting impression on heraldry. Henry VI was a member of the Hohenstaufen family, who were also Dukes of Suabia, their home region. The arms of Suabia, most interestingly, underwent the same transition as the English arms. The first Dukes bore a single lion rampant until they exchanged it for three lions passant, black on a gold field. Black and gold in heraldry are a rare combination,\n\nOf course, as in the case of the English lions, we may also ask: Why three lions passant? The answer seems obvious, just like Richard found it convenient to top everybody else’s arms in England, the Suabian Hohenstaufen, from whose ranks had come all German Kings and Emperors since 1138, wanted to stress their premier rank among all German princes with a non plus ultra coat.\n\nIt would be most natural for Richard to have been inspired by this arrangement to base his own along the same lines. But there could be even more to it, for when Henry VI released Richard, his new vassal, he might well have bestowed on him a variant of his own family coat of arms, but it is interesting to note that this would not have been an eagle coat. Several German princes bore such, clearly derived from the imperial bird. But, compared with Richard, they were lesser princes, rulers of marches on the outskirts of the Empire. Richard’s status was higher, even as a feudatory of the Emperor, who could not deceive himself into believing that he had added a new tributary state to his realm. He was well aware that their feudal relationship was personal. So he may have conferred on the king a variant not of his arms of dominion but, on a more personal note, of his family arms.\n\nHowever I must admit to a time problem. As noted above, Richard’s three lions date from the 1190s. But then, so do the Suabian beasts – first seen on a seal of Duke Philip (around 1196-1198), two to four years after Richard had returned to England. The last Suabian ruler to display the single rampant animal was Konrad (d 1196), the last known instance being in 1192.19 But armorial ensigns were changed at will and it could well be that Duke Konrad adopted the three lions some time between 1192 and 1196."
