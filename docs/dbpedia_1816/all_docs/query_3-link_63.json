        "text": "Kings of Scotland\n\nThe monarch of Scotland was the head of state of the Kingdom of Scotland. According to tradition, the first King of Scots was Kenneth MacAlpin (CinÃ¡ed mac AilpÃ­n), who founded the state in 843, although this is disputed on a number of different grounds. Some modern historiography would tend to see his grandson Constantine II of Scotland as the creator of the Kingdom of Alba which became known in English as Scotland.\n\nThe title fell out of use in 1707 when the Kingdom of Scotland merged with the Kingdom of England to form the Kingdom of Great Britain. Thus Queen Anne became the last Queen of Scotland and the first Queen of Great Britain. The two kingdoms had shared a monarch since 1603 (see Union of the Crowns), and Charles II was the last Scottish monarch to actually be crowned in Scotland, at Scone in 1651.\n\nKings of Scotland after the Year 1000\n\nThese Early Three Kings of Scotland are all in our Family Line.\n\nMalcolm II (1005 - 1034)(Direct Ancestor of the WEEMS (WEMYSS)\n\nDuncan I (1034 - 1040)(Direct Ancestor of the WEEMS (WEMYSS)\n\nMacbeth (1040 - 1057) Macbeth killed Duncan in 1040 A.D.\n\nNote: Macbeth was a cousin of Duncan I\n\nMaking him a member of the Royal Family and a relative of the Weems.\n\nMalcolm III, (Canmore), son of Duncan I (1057 - 1093) (Direct\n\nAncestor of the WEEMS (WEMYSS)\n\nDonald Bane, second son of Duncan 1 (1093 - 1094)\n\nDuncan 11, son of Malcolm Canmore, (1094 -1094)\n\nDonald Bane, second reign (1094 - 1097)\n\nEdgar, son of Malcolm Canmore, (1097 - 1107)\n\nAlexander 1, brother of Edgar and son of Malcolm Canmore (1107 - 1124)\n\nDavid 1, brother of Edgar and Alexander and son of Malcolm Canmore(1124 - 1153)\n\nMalcolm 1V, grandson of David 1 (1153 - 1165)\n\nWilliam the Lion, brother of Malcolm 1V (1165 - 1214)\n\nAlexander 11, son of William the Lion (1214 - 1249)\n\nAlexander 111, son Alexander 11 (1249 - 1286)\n\nMargaret, Maid of Norway (1286 - 1290)\n\nFirst Interregnum, English occupation of Scotland (1290 - 1292)\n\nJohn Balliol, descendant of David 1 (1292 - 1296)\n\nSecond Interregnum, English occupation of Scotland (1296 - 1306)\n\nRobert 1 the Bruce, descendant of David 1 (1306 - 1329)\n\nPlease notice the Kings of Scotland (with a very few exceptions) came from a Royal Family Line and were related. Malcomb II son was Duncan I. Malcomb III was the son of Duncan I. Donald Bane was the second son of Duncan I. Duncan II was the son of Malcomb III. Edgar was the son of Malcomb III. Alexander I was brother of Edgar and son of Malcomb III. David I was the brother of Edgar and the son of Malcomb III.Malcomb IV was the grandson of David I, William the Lion was the brother of Malcomb IV. Alexander II was the son of William the Lion. Alexander III was the son of Alexander II. John Balliol was the grandson of David I. Robert I the Bruce was the great grandson of David I.\n\nThe Weems came from the same line as these Kings but the brother of our descendant became King. This makes the whole Royal line cousins of the Weems descendents.\n\nThe Union of the Crowns refers to the accession of James VI King of Scots to the thrones of England and Ireland, in March 1603. This followed the death of his unmarried and childless cousin, Queen Elizabeth I of England. She was last Monarch of the Tudor dynasty.\n\nHe was King James VI of Scotland and became King James I of England.\n\nMary Queen of Scots\n\nMary, queen of Scots was one of the most fascinating and controversial monarchs of 16th century Europe. At one time, she claimed the crowns of four nations - Scotland, France, England and Ireland. Her physical beauty and kind heart were acknowledged even by her enemies. Yet she lacked the political skills to rule successfully in Scotland. Her second marriage was unpopular and ended in murder and scandal; her third was even less popular and ended in forced abdication in favor of her infant son. She fled to England in 1568, hoping for the help of her cousin, Elizabeth I. Her presence was dangerous for the English queen, who feared Catholic plotting on Mary's behalf. The two queens never met and Mary remained imprisoned for the next nineteen years. She was executed in 1587, only forty-four years old. By orders of the English government, all of her possessions were burned. In 1603, upon Elizabeth's death,\n\nMary's son became king of England as James I.\n\nENGLISH ROYAL DYNASTIES\n\nNorman (1066-)\n\nPlantaganet (1154-)\n\nLancaster (1399-)\n\nYork (1461-)\n\nTudor (1485-)\n\nStuart (1603-)\n\nHanover (1714-1901)\n\nWindsor (1901/1917-present)\n\nSCOTTISH ROYAL DYNASTIES\n\nbeing:\n\nAlpin (839-1034 and 1040-58)\n\nAtholl (1034-40 and 1058-1290)\n\nno ruler 1290-92\n\nBalliol (1292-6, 1332 and periods of 1333-46)\n\nno ruler 1296-1306\n\nBruce (1306-71)\n\nStewart (1371-1625)."
