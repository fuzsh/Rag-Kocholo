        "text": "The younger sister of King Charles III sustained minor injuries during an incident at her estate Gatcombe Park, Buckingham Palace has announced.\n\n\"Her Royal Highness remains in Southmead Hospital, Bristol, as a precautionary measure for observation and is expected to make a full and swift recovery,\" the June 24 statement, shared to X, read. \"The King has been kept closely informed and joins the whole Royal Family in sending his fondest love and well-wishes to The Princess for a speedy recovery.\"\n\nNearly three months after sharing her cancer diagnosis, the Princess of Wales said that she's \"making good progress\" with chemotherapy, though there are \"good days and bad days\" amid her health journey.\n\n\"On those bad days you feel weak, tired and you have to give in to your body resting,\" Kate wrote on Instagram June 14. \"But on the good days, when you feel stronger, you want to make the most of feeling well.\"\n\nShe added, \"My treatment is ongoing and will be for a few more months. On the days I feel well enough, it is a joy to engage with school life, spend personal time on the things that give me energy and positivity, as well as starting to do a little work from home.\"\n\nIn a March 22 video message, the Princess of Wales shared that she'd been diagnosed with cancer after undergoing abdominal surgery in January.\n\n\"It was thought that my condition was non-cancerous. The surgery was successful,\" she said before noting that tests after the operation found cancer had been present. \"My medical team therefore advised that I should undergo a course of preventative chemotherapy and I am now in the early stages of that treatment.\"\n\nAfter photo agencies pulled the picture Kensington Palace shared of Kate since having her abdominal surgery on March 10, the Princess of Wales addressed claims the photo was doctored.\n\n\"Like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing,\" she tweeted on March 11. \"I wanted to express my apologies for any confusion the family photograph we shared yesterday caused. I hope everyone celebrating had a very happy Mother's Day. C.\"\n\nPrincess Diana's niece celebrated Mother's Day in the U.K. by sharing she and her husband Michael Lewis privately welcomed their first baby.\n\n“It’s the joy of my life to be your mummy, little one. I love you unconditionally,\" she captioned her March 10 Instagram post. \"Happy Mother’s Day to those who celebrate today.\"\n\nAfter keeping up her full slate of engagements in the wake of her husband's cancer diagnosis, the palace cleared Camilla's schedule.\n\nThe Times pointed out March 2 that the 76-year-old didn't have any engagements on her calendar until March 11, when she'd be due at Westminster Abbey to observe Commonwealth Day.\n\nWhile King Charles III was in the hospital for his benign prostate enlargement procedure, the royal family member was diagnosed with cancer.\n\n\"His Majesty has today commenced a schedule of regular treatments, during which time he has been advised by doctors to postpone public-facing duties,\" Buckingham Palace said Feb. 5. \"Throughout this period, His Majesty will continue to undertake State business and official paperwork as usual.The King is grateful to his medical team for their swift intervention, which was made possible thanks to his recent hospital procedure. He remains wholly positive about his treatment and looks forward to returning to full public duty as soon as possible.\""
