        "text": "A Royal Rebellion\n\nDuring the reign of King John, owner of Alnwick Castle Eustace de Vescy rebelled against the king, becoming allies with Alexander II of Scotland. Threats to destroy the castle were made by King John, although these did not materialise.\n\nBarnard Castle — which was owned by Hugh de Baliol, an ally of King John — was besieged in 1215. De Vescy was killed in battle there in 1216by a single arrow to the head.\n\nFollowing the death of the last legitimate member of the de Vescy line around 1296-1297, the castle fell to Antony Bek, the Bishop of Durham. However, Bek sold the castle to Henry Percy in 1309, positioning a trusted warrior with much success in battle as defender of the East March section of the England - Scotland border.\n\nThe Percy Legacy Begins\n\nOver the subsequent generations, the Percy lords of Alnwick rebuilt many parts of the Castle and continued to secure the border against Scottish incursions, including a famous victory at the Battle of Neville’s Cross in 1346. Thirty years later, they were elevated to Earls of Northumberland by King Richard II; unfortunately for the family, the 1st Earl was killed in 1408 rebelling against King Henry IV, who he himself had helped to take the throne. The earl’s son Harry ‘Hotspur’ Percy, one of England’s most celebrated knights, was himself killed fighting the king five years earlier. Hotspur’s son was reinstated to his lands and titles by King Henry V."
