        "text": "As questions swirl around King Charles III's health, thoughts immediately turn to the British royal line of succession and who will inherit the throne, less than two years after Charles ascended.\n\nPrince William, who is first in line to the throne, was already taking on more responsibilities after his father Charles sought treatment for an enlarged prostate last month and when wife Princess Kate postponed her appearances at royal events until Easter as she recovers from an abdominal surgery.\n\nNow amid Charles' cancer diagnosis, William, The Prince of Wales, would step up as the heir to the British royal family should anything happen to his father.\n\n\"During The King's recent hospital procedure for benign prostate enlargement, a separate issue of concern was noted. Subsequent diagnostic tests have identified a form of cancer,\" Buckingham Palace said in a statement on Monday.\n\nThe palace also informed that Charles was \"advised by doctors to postpone public-facing duties\" amid his treatment.\n\nStill, there are plenty of questions surrounding the king's reign, what happens after his death and what his death would mean for the British monarchy.\n\nHere is everything we know.\n\nPrince William likely to step up amid King Charles III's cancer diagnosis, experts say\n\nWho succeeds the king?\n\nAfter 70 years on the throne, Queen Elizabeth II died in September 2022 at Balmoral Castle in Scotland. Charles instantly became king and his wife, Camilla, formerly the Duchess of Cornwall, became the Queen Consort, a request made by the former monarch. (Charles was previously married to the late Princess Diana.)\n\nAfter Charles, the line of succession turns to his older son William. William's children — Prince George, 10, Princess Charlotte, 8, and Prince Louis, 5 — are next in the line of succession, followed by Prince Harry and his children, Archie, 4, and Lilibet, 2.\n\nThe succession is as follows:\n\n1. Prince William, Prince of Wales\n\n2. Prince George of Wales\n\n3. Princess Charlotte of Wales\n\n4. Prince Louis of Wales\n\n5. Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex\n\n6. Prince Archie of Sussex\n\n7. Princess Lilibet of Sussex\n\n8. Prince Andrew, The Duke of York\n\n9. Princess Beatrice, Mrs. Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi\n\n10.
