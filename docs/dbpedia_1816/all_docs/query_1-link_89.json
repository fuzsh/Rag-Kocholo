[2][3][4] His mother died in 1327,[5] and his father on 9 June 1329.[5][6] He had two older sisters, Matilda[2] who married Thomas Isaac, and Margaret[2] who married William, 5th earl of Sutherland. His half-sister Marjorie (by his father's first marriage) married Walter Stewart, 6th High Steward of Scotland.[2] Her son Robert eventually succeeded David as King of Scots.[6]\n\nIn 1326 the nobility, clergy, and people of Scotland swore fealty at Cambuskenneth to David (and to his issue) as the heir to the throne of Scotland; whom failing, to Robert the High Steward (David's nephew).[7][8] On 17 July 1328 he was created earl of Carrick, and as part of the Treaty of Edinburgh David (then four years old) was married to Joan (aged seven), the second daughter of Edward II, King of England.[2][9] David and his young queen were both crowned at Scone on 24 November 1331,[3] he was the first Scottish king to be annointed by the Bishop of St Andrews in accordance with a bull that had been issued by Pope John XXII in June, 1329.[5][6]\n\nAfter his father's death, Thomas Randolph, earl of Moray, became regent and young David's guardian.[10] Randolph died under suspicious circumstances in July, 1332, and in his place the magnates appointed Donald, earl of Mar and nephew of Robert I.[5] On the same day that Mar assumed his duties as guardian, Edward Baliol led an invasion of Scotland and Mar, along with many other nobles who had rushed to defend against this attack, was slain in battle near Perth.[5] David and the queen were initially sheltered at Dumbarton Castle, but fears for their safety led to their being escorted (along with David's sisters) to France where King Philip VI offered them his protection and provided a home for them at Ch√¢teau Gaillard in Normandy.[6][11]Little is known of David's life during this period.\n\nReturn to Scotland and Imprisonment\n\nWhen David and his queen consort landed at Kincardineshire on 2 June 1341 he was seventeen years of age, and \"all were gladdened by his arrival...lighting bonfires and holding banquets in his honour with joy.\"[12] However the young king immediately faced challenges which would have been daunting even for an experienced leader: Scotland had been repeatedly invaded during his absence; parts of the kingdom were now under English rule and the Scots had responded to this by engaging in guerrilla warfare with their overlords, resulting in much destruction; in some areas rival English and Scottish landlords both attempted to collect revenue, resulting in neither being able to collect very much; exchequer audits had been completely suspended until just prior to David's return; and the magnates who had been in charge of administering the government while the young king was in France were not happy about relinquishing their authority.[6] David initially made some fairly serious mistakes, characterized by a note in the Liber Pluscardensis remarking that \"few were things he did with mature deliberation [and] the advice of the wise, but his proceedings were often headstrong and on his own opinion, without advice.\"[13]\n\nOne of these mistakes resulted in the death of Sir Alexander Ramsay. Ramsay successfully recovered, in 1342, the castle of Roxburgh which had been held by the English.[6][14]As a reward, David made Ramsay sheriff of Teviotdale, an office which had previously been given to William Douglas of Liddesdale. Douglas responded by capturing Ramsay and imprisoning him at Hermitage Castle in Liddesdale, where Ramsay was starved to death.[6][14] Douglas was a powerful enemy and an influential magnate, and David was forced to allow him to continue holding the sheriffdom.[14]\n\nWhen Edward III launched a large invasion of France in 1344, Philippe requested that Scotland invade England and David (who felt indebted to the French king for sheltering him until he reached his majority) agreed.[6] An initial foray into Cumberland went well for the Scots and resulted in the capture of Liddel, an English stronghold.[6] But dissention broke out among the Scottish nobles: the earl of Ross assassinated his old foe from the Isles, Ranald MacRuairi, and then immediately returned home. [5] In light of Ross's sudden departure, William Douglas advised David that all remaining troops should also return to Scotland while a new plan of attack was formulated.[6] David's younger commanders, however, wanted none of that and urged the king to continue further south, plundering everything in their path and particularly targeting monastic lands.[6] Eventually David's army was confronted outside of Durham by a large force which had been assembled by the archbishop of York, and on 17 October 1346 the Scots suffered a crushing defeat at the Battle of Neville's Cross.[5] Among those slain in battle were the earls of Menteith, Moray, Murray, and Strathern; John Roxburgh, the chamberlain of Scotland; Thomas Charteris, the chancellor of Scotland; Robert Keith, marischal of Scotland; and a host of other powerful magnates.[15][16] The earls of Fife, Sutherland, Wigtown, and Menteith, and William Douglas of Liddesdale were among those captured and taken prisoner along with King David II, who sustained serious wounds when he was struck in the head by two English arrows.[16]\n\nAlmost the only Scottish survivors of the encounter at Nevilles Cross were Robert Stewart, Steward of Scotland and the king's heir; and Patrick, earl of Dunbar, who both fled with their forces soon after the battle began.[6] Once again, Robert Stewart was to rule Scotland during David II's absence.[6]\n\nSecond Period of his Reign\n\nDavid II remained a prisoner in England for eleven years (most of that time spent in the Tower of London). During that time, the Steward remained busy consolidating his own bases of power throughout the kingdom but did not make any efforts to negotiate for David II's release.[17] It was left to David to begin these discussions himself.[17] Initial terms set by Edward for the Scottish king's release included David officially recognizing Scotland as a fief from the King of England; and, if David were to die without an heir, being succeeded by the king of England or his oldest son.[6] David was able to renegotiate these terms to instead ensure that Scotland would remain an independent kingdom not subject to the king of England; and his successor (if he had no son himself) would be Edward's second son (not the king of England himself or his heir).[6] Edward eventually agreed to this compromise, but the Scottish magnates did not. [6]\n\nEventually David's release was negotiated in 1357 as part of the Treaty of Berwick: Scotland was to pay a ransom of 100,000 merks (¬£67,000) in ten equal installments.[5][18][19] The nobles, clergy, and burghs of Scotland were all signatories to the Treaty, which provided for a truce between the two countries until the full ransom was paid, and for twenty \"youths of noble birth\" and three \"great lords\" to be held in England meanwhile as hostages.[5] An initial payment was made, but David had trouble coming up with the remainder and made many attempts to renegotiate the ransom amount. In 1369 it was reduced to 56,000 merks over fourteen years, but the Scottish government defaulted after paying 20,000 merks.[6]\n\nMuch of the remainder of David II's reign was spent in two pursuits: attempting to either raise the ransom funds or renegotiate the agreement; and beginning to transfer power from the Steward and his allies who had assumed influential roles in the government during David's absence.[6] Although early historians seized on David's willingness to make peace with England by allowing his successor (failing an heir of his own) to be a son of Edward III, calling him \"weak and capricious, violent in his resentments, and habitually under the dominion of women,\"[20] later historians acknowledge that any negotiations made during his imprisonment were made under duress. David may well have understood the Scottish magnates would not countenance such an arrangement, although it did buy him time to perhaps father an heir himself and was also an opportunity to undermine his nephew's power grab.[21][22]\n\nWhen David returned to the throne in 1357, he was thirty-three years of age and Scotland had been ruled by by a group of powerful nobles both during his minority and then during his captivity for a total of twenty-three years.[23] The fact that he was able to gain control of the government by successfully shifting power away from his enemies and empowering a younger group of knights who were loyal to himself, and then reign in relative peace for another fourteen years, demonstrates that he deserved a lot more credit than early historians gave him.[23] He was actively involved in the business of the government and regularly issued acts and charters throughout his reign, and although Scone remained the place where important events such as parliaments were held, Edinburgh became the place where David II lived and where most of the government's business was transacted.[24] The king oversaw annual exchequer audits (which the Steward had let lapse during David's absence); held a regular \"justice ayre\" so that \"wrong-doers\" would be punished; forbid any nobles from waging a private war against their neighbors; and offered protection so that churches could enjoy basic liberties as they had \"tempore bone pacis\" (\"in the good time of peace\").[25]\n\nMarriage to Joan Plantagenet\n\nDavid was married 17 July 1328 at Berwick-upon-Tweed to Joan, the second daughter of Edward II, King of England, and Isabel of France.[26] Their marriage was formalized in the Treaty of Edinburgh on that date, but because they were both too young for any marriage to be recognized by the church, a proviso was included which stated that if the marriage had not been \"completed\" within two months of when David reached the canonical age of fourteen, the entire treaty would be invalidated.[27] Both children lived in Scotland until forced, in 1334, to seek safe refuge in France during a period of political turmoil.[27]\n\nQueen Joan returned to Scotland with her husband in June 1341, but little is known of her life there. Five years after their return, David was captured at the Battle of Nevilles Cross and spent the following eleven years imprisoned in England, most of that time in the Tower.[6] Although Joan received a safe conduct from her brother to visit her husband, there is no evidence that she ever made the trip to London.[27] Her residence remained in Scotland and it is possible she was in some way a hostage there guaranteeing King David's safety.[27] When David was finally released in 1357 and returned to Scotland he brought with him Katherine Mortimer, who he had met in England and who had become his mistress. According to Bower (writing in the fifteenth century) \".....the king loved [Katherine] more than all other women, and on her account his queen was entirely neglected while he embraced his mistress.\"[28] In May 1358, Joan again received a safe conduct from Edward III, her brother, to travel to England \"for certain causes\" unspecified.[29] This time she made the trip, leaving her husband and remaining in England for the rest of her life.[27] Joan lived only four more years, dying on 7 September 1362 (aged forty-one) at Hertford Castle, Hertfordshire.[26] She was buried in the church of the Greyfriars in London.[26]\n\nThere were no children from David's marriage to Joan.[2][3]\n\nKatherine Mortimer, David's mistress, was murdered in 1360 and the earl of Angus, thought by the king to be responsible for her death, was later imprisoned for it and died during his captivity.[6]\n\nMarriage to Margaret Drummond\n\nKing David II married (second) c.20 February 1363 in St Andrews and St Martins at Inchmurdach, Margaret, daughter of Sir John de Drummond and the widow of Sir John Logie of that Ilk.[2][3] Margaret was reknown for her beauty but she was also a shrewd political strategist and immediately set about doing everything in her power to increase the wealth and power of the Drummond and Logie families as well as add as much as possible to her own personal wealth..[30][31]\n\nShe eventually became a political liabiity to David when she created her own political network to rule over strategic areas in central Scotland, which often found itself in opposition to the Steward and the earls of Douglas and of March.[32][33] The tipping point in their relationship, however, which most likely was the reason that David eventually filed for divorce, was Margaret's failure to bear him a son.[34] According to the Liber Pluscardensis it was because \"[Margaret] pretended to be with child and was not.\"[35]\n\nThe divorce was most likely finalized at a special council held at Perth in December 1368,[36], although Margaret was later able to convince the pope to annul the divorce decree and order that her royal title, all of the lands which had been granted to her, and her personal fortune all be restored to her.[37] Both David II and his successor, Robert II, pursued all diplomatic means to have this papal decision reversed, but the point became moot when Margaret died 31 January 1375, under mysterious circumstances, on her way to pay another visit to the pope.[3][37][38]\n\nAgnes Dunbar\n\nBy January 1371 the king had taken Agnes Dunbar, the wife of Sir John Maitland of Thirlestane, as his mistress and intended bride, although a royal wedding was necessarily delayed until a divorce could be obtained from Agnes's husband.[39] The king was anxious to strengthen his alliance with the earl of Dunbar, and equally anxious to produce a son (which Agnes had already proven herself capable of). In January 1371 Agnes was given by the king a pension of ¬£1000 from the customs of Aberdeen, funds which had previously been provided to Margaret Logie.[39] David granted a number of charters and settlements in 1369 which were intended to compensate in advance the Dunbars of March, the Maitlands, and some of their extended family members who would likely be affected by Agnes's divorce from Maitland and marriage to the king, including arranging for Agnes's brother George to receive the earldom of March from his cousin/uncle Patrick.[40]\n\nThe marriage to Agnes Dunbar never took place, due to David II's sudden and unexpected death.\n\nDeath\n\nDavid II, King of Scots, died on 22 February 1371 at Edinburgh Castle (aged forty-one) of causes unknown, and was buried at Holyrood Abbey.[2][41][3][42] Having no children, he was succeeded by his nephew Robert, High Steward of Scotland.[2]\n\nResearch Notes\n\nDavid had a twin brother\n\nThere is some disagreement among more recent historians as to whether David was the elder twin[1] or the younger.[6] His brother, christened John, died as a very young child in 1326.[1] Near contemporaneous verses printed to commemorate David's birth include one verse by an anonymous author which celebrated \"a two-fold birth.\"[43] A.A.M. Duncan, who edited one of the most widely accepted translations of The Bruce, notes only \"David, born 5 March 1324 at Dunfermline; his twin, John, did not survive.\"[44] Almost the only evidence of John which exists is a grant by David II of ¬£20 annually from Dundee's customs to the priory of Restenneth made on 10 June 1344 \"for the soul of [his] brother John.\"[45] Stevens-17832 21:41, 20 December 2022 (UTC)\n\nSources\n\n‚Üë 1.0 1.1 1.2 Penman, Michael.
