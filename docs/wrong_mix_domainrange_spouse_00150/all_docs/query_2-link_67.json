        "text": "Amy Robach and T.J. Holmes got candid about taking their relationship to the next level.\n\nThe former “Good Morning America 3” co-anchors revealed they are discussing the possibility of marriage during Sunday’s episode of their “Amy & T.J.” podcast.\n\n“We’re still deciding about what that level of commitment is … whether it’s legal or not … but mentally, emotionally, we’ve absolutely agreed to commit to one another,” Robach explained. “We haven’t figured [out] the marriage thing out yet.”\n\n“We haven’t decided whether or not we are going to officially get married,” Holmes chimed in.\n\nRobach, 51, furthered that she’s searching for a “life partner” in her beau.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\n“What is a life partner short of a legal (sic) binding agreement? Can you have a life partner without that?” Holmes, 46, questioned.\n\n“You can,” she responded\n\nThe mother of two referenced longtime partners Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell — who’ve been together since 1983 — as an example of a successful relationship sans being legally wed.\n\n“I’m sure and I know it’s not perfect. But I’ve always been in awe of the fact that every day they wake up and they choose to be together, there’s no legal (sic) binding document that says they have to be together,” she added.\n\nRobach added tying the knot is “a false security blanket,” though she still sees the possibility of marriage with Holmes.\n\n“I still default to that in my head,” she told Holmes.\n\n“I’m just admitting it, and I’m not saying it makes any sense … There’s something about where I feel if I can say ‘that’s my husband and I’m his wife,’ it feels more official and it feels more real even though that’s necessarily not the case because we lived enough life to know that’s not.”\n\nWhile the topic of marriage is still on the table, the couple is more focused on moving in together first.\n\n“But we have, I have said this to you, and I believe you’ve said it to me as well that I want to be with you for the rest of my life, and I would like to live with you when the time comes,” Robach continued.\n\n“It doesn’t have to be today or tomorrow or next year, but I would eventually like to live with you.”\n\nHowever, their relationship wouldn’t change when they do take that leap since they are “never” apart.\n\n“We work together, and we prep for work together,” Robach added. “I just think we’re so used to constantly being around each other. That would not change anything.”\n\nThe two have been together since November 2022 when their romance was ousted, costing them their jobs at “GMA3.”\n\nAt the time, Robach was married to her ex-husband Andrew Shue while Holmes was wed to Marilee Fiebig.\n\nBoth Holmes and Robach filed for divorce from their respective spouses in December 2022.\n\nIn December 2023, Page Six exclusively revealed Shue and Fieberg had been dating for six months after bonding over the traumatic experience of the affair."
