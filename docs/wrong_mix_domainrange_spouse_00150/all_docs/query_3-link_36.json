        "text": "STRICTLY's Amy Dowden finally married her long-term partner Ben Jones in 2022.\n\nThe pair had to reschedule their wedding previously due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nWho is Amy Dowden's husband Ben Jones?\n\nMuch like the Strictly choreographer, Ben is a professional dancer and has been trotting alongside Amy for several years.\n\nThe couple were once British National Latin Dance champions, becoming the first all-British pair to win the competition.\n\nBoth have decided to help others follow their passion for dancing and run the Art in Motion dance school in Dudley, in the West Midlands.\n\nNot much else is known about Ben as he keeps a low profile, allowing his partner to bask alone in the spotlight.\n\nUnlike Amy, he is not active on any social media platforms, although he can sometimes be seen with his wife in posts shared on their school's official Instagram profile.\n\nThe couple have also walked the red carpet together on many occasions but Ben remains adamant on staying away from the limelight altogether.\n\nWhen did Amy Dowden and Ben Jones meet?\n\nAmy and Ben met in 2011, but kept their romance secret for six years.\n\nThis was because they were scared of what their dance teachers would say.\n\nBen popped the question in 2017 during a New Year's Eve party after seven years of romance.\n\nWhen did Ben Jones marry Amy Dowden?\n\nAmy and Ben have finally tied the knot after their big day was delayed by Covid.\n\nThe happy couple married at a five-star wedding venue in Gower Peninsula, South Wales, on July 3, 2022.\n\nThey were initially due to wed two years ago on July 25 2020, but the marriage was postponed due to the pandemic.\n\nSpeaking about her special day, Amy told Hello! magazine: \"It was a stunning venue. I always knew I wanted to get married in Wales.\n\n\"The day was a celebration of Ben and me.\""
