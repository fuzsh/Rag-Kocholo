Whether it be Only Murders in the Building, Beautiful Boy, or A24’s Beau Is Afraid, the 54-year-old’s repertoire is eclectic, to say the least.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nWhile many know her best for portraying Michael Scott’s (Steve Carell) love interest Holly Flax in The Office, her entertainment resume and personal life truly set her apart. So, let’s dive into the details of her marriage, children, career, and more.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nWho is Amy Ryan’s husband? Meet writer and producer Eric Slovin.\n\nThe Beau Is Afraid star isn’t the only partner in her marriage who pursued a career in the arts. In 2011, Amy tied the knot with former Saturday Night Live writer Eric Slovin. Born on Sept. 11, 1967, in New York City, the 55-year-old quickly made a name for himself within the entertainment industry.\n\nPer Eric’s IMDb profile, he is a producer and writer best known for SNL (he contributed to 60 episodes from 2002 to 2005), Important Things With Demetri Martin, and Night of Too Many Stars: America Comes Together for Autism Programs.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nHowever, his list of accomplishments doesn’t end there. The writer’s repertoire includes over 10 television series — he even received three Primetime Emmy nominations.\n\nAdditionally, Eric is a successful actor, having starred in everything from series such as Broad City and Crashing to films like Sex and the Other Man and On Edge.\n\nDo Amy Ryan and her husband, Eric Slovin, have kids?\n\nBefore Amy and Eric tied the knot, they welcomed their first child.

And be refreshed to be with her when I come back.\"\n\nWhat is Amy Ryan known for? She's an award-winning actor.\n\nAmy has quite an impressive arts resume. In 2008, Amy received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress for the 2007 film Gone Baby Gone and even won a Critics’ Choice Award for her portrayal of Helene McCready.\n\nHowever, her time-honored career began long before then.
