        "text": "Who is the bride?\n\n‚ÄúJeopardy!‚Äù 40-game champion Amy Schneider announced on Tuesday that she and girlfriend Genevieve Davis tied the knot back in May.\n\n‚ÄúGenevieve and I are delighted to announce that on Monday, May 9, we were married in a small private ceremony at the Alameda County Recorder,‚Äù the longtime ‚ÄúJeopardy‚Äù fan shared on Instagram, along with several snaps of the happy day.\n\nThe champ detailed that they ‚Äúwill still be having a traditional wedding and reception next summer.‚Äù However, because their lives ‚Äúhave been much too busy this year to get very far in planning it‚Äù and they ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt wait that long to proclaim [their] love and commitment to each other,‚Äù they went on with a much more intimate ceremony.\n\n‚ÄúThank you, everyone for your support!‚Äù Schneider concluded her post.\n\nIn the beautiful photos, Davis and Schneider held each other while the former planted a kiss on her bride‚Äôs cheek.\n\nThe two wore simple white dresses, as well as floral headpieces while saying their ‚ÄúI do‚Äôs.‚Äù\n\nSchneider gave further details on her Twitter, sharing the same three photos from their wedding day.\n\n‚ÄúA year ago today, I was in [Los Angeles], waiting to fulfill a dream. The year since has been full of good days, but by far the best one was May 9th, when Genevieve and I got married. Without her, none of the other good days would have happened. I‚Äôm so lucky to share my life with her!‚Äù she gushed.\n\nBack in February, Schneider announced their engagement with a photo of their left hands rocking engagement rings.\n\n‚ÄúShe said yes! Well, actually I said yes, but then I wanted to propose too, so she said yes as well lol,‚Äù she captioned the photo.\n\n‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt be happier or more proud to be marrying the very best person in the entire world, and I‚Äôm so glad to be sharing my life with her. It‚Äôs great to be able to introduce her to people as ‚ÄòGenevieve, my fianc√©e‚Äô ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞.‚Äù\n\nSchneider previously revealed they met through her friend‚Äôs boyfriend.\n\n‚ÄúIn the summer of 2020, my friend was hanging out at my apartment, talking on the phone to her boyfriend, and somehow or other she wound up inviting her boyfriend‚Äôs sister over to my place, to give her a ride somewhere. That sister turned out to be Genevieve.‚Äù"
