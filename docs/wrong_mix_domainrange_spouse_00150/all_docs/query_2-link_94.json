        "text": "The Jonah-Amy Relationship (also known as Simmosa to some) is a relationship between Jonah Simms and Amy Sosa. They are shown to be married in the show's series finale.\n\nSeason One[]\n\nIn Pilot, Jonah doesn't realize that Amy is an employee at the store and seems a bit high-handed when helping organize inventory. When he does realize that Amy is his boss when Cheyenne Lee requests a break, he feels ashamed and tries to apologize to Amy, only further causing trouble. Eventually, he decides to plaster glow-in-the-dark stars all over the ceiling, causing Amy to be dazed and surprised when the lights go off and the glow shows.\n\nIn Magazine Profile, the journalist for the Stratus Magazine, Cynthia, is supposed to interview Glenn Sturgis, but finds him utterly boring. Jonah starts to bring up new and modern ideas, claiming that they are Glenn's to save Glenn's hide, but Cynthia seems very interested in Jonah. Amy comments later that Cynthia only likes Jonah's ideas because he is cute. Jonah is surprised and asks Amy if she thinks that he is cute, and she quickly recovers. Later, Dina Fox shows a tape of Jonah and Cynthia passionately kissing in the stock room, and Amy is one of the most prominent people who makes fun of Jonah.\n\nIn Mannequin, Amy, Mateo Liwanag, and various other employees find a mannequin that looks very much like Jonah. They start to put the mannequin in embarrassing situations, and Jonah is trying hard not to have an outburst. Instead, he decides to take revenge by finding a mannequin of Amy, but the only one he can discover is a sex doll, which causes coworkers to recoil and back away in disgust and fear.\n\nIn Shoplifter, Amy brings her daughter, Emma Dubanowski to work illegally. She hides Emma beneath the Jewelry Counter so nobody sees her. But Glenn and Dina demand Amy's service, and she is gone for a very long time. When she returns, Emma and Jonah are playing video games, and she seems pleased on how well they are together.\n\nIn Secret Shopper, Amy feels that Jonah is being a bit stuck-up and braggadocios after acing the employee test. When Amy moves bags of charcoal to the patio, Jonah remarks that they are actually supposed to be in the Grocery Section and moves them. Amy thinks that Jonah is being irrational and demands that he reports to the patio over the intercom. Jonah gets on the other line and the two get into a fierce argument, ending with Amy screaming hateful names into the intercom and slamming it down, ending the rant. Later, Jonah walks into the stock room to apologize. Amy is being sullen and uncooperative, but both start to let loose as they drive the forklift, and later make up.\n\nIn Color Wars, Jonah tries to sell an expensive grill to a customer, who is actually Adam Dubanowski, Amy's spouse. When Amy comes to persuade Adam that money is too tight for a shopping spree, Jonah quickly slips out of the vicinity as Amy and Adam start to argue.\n\nIn Labor, Jonah and Amy discuss Unionizing in the Stock Room. Amy seems opposed to the idea, and she and Jonah start to raise their voices, but when they realize that Cheyenne is giving birth to Harmonica Thompson, they divert their attention to Cheyenne's contractions and hustle out. When Glenn discovers Cloud 9 is too cheap to give their employees Maternity Leave, he gives Cheyenne almost an identical thing- Weeks of paid suspension. This causes Glenn to get fired, to the chagrin of many employees. Amy and Jonah lead a walk out to support Glenn and rights for workers, irate at the firing.\n\nSeason Two[]\n\nIn Strike, Jonah and Amy try to negotiate with the district manager, Jeff Sutin, to no avail. They start to bring more people to the strike and are leading the rebellion. As the day goes on, the strikers are weary, and Dina starts to scare everyone with a dangerous pressure washer that she does not hesitate using. The strike slowly loses momentum and support, until Amy and Jonah are the only ones left striking as the sun goes down. They both agree to end the strike for now and walk inside together.\n\nIn Back To Work, Amy and Jonah try to start telling Jeff their grievances. But Jeff slyly dodges the questions and asks everyone to tell him their comments later after he gets a look around the store.\n\nIn Spokesman Scandal, Amy and Jonah defend their pride, claiming that they each aren't chickens. Then, they challenge each other to dares. First, Amy dresses up as Kyle the Cloud 9 Cloud's costume, which is a red flag for danger, since Kyle turned out to be a cannibal. Then, Jonah is forced to stay in an industrial freezer. After that, Jonah dares Amy to sing \"Charles in Charge\" over the intercom in both English and Spanish. After a day of dares, the final one is Amy daring Jonah to only wear an apron in the store.\n\nIn Election Day, Jonah brings his girlfriend Naomi into the store and introduces her to Amy, who is clearly jealous. Amy detaches herself from the situation and bids Jonah and Naomi good-bye.\n\nIn Lost and Found, Amy discovers a wad of cash in one of the lost and found items. Jonah motivates her to use the money for herself, but word gets out that Amy might use the money to help everyone convert the break room into a more comfortable and lavish area. Too kind to let everyone down, Amy purchases many comfort items, although when Sandra Kaluiokalani tracks down the real owner of the money, they are forced to return the items.\n\nIn Rebranding, Jonah's college friend Rex swings by and meets Jonah on accident. Amy, thrilled, grills Rex with Garrett McNeill on any antics that Jonah did in college, and Rex spills lots of stories to her, making Jonah feel uncomfortable and evasive.\n\nIn Ladies' Lunch, Marcus challenges Jonah to a contest, and the winner gets Amy when Amy divorces Adam. Jonah finds this highly offensive, and turns irate when Marcus wins, accidentally letting it slip that he likes Amy. Jonah quickly tries to cover up his tracks, but luckily, Amy is too drunk to notice.\n\nIn Super Hot Store, Amy and Marcus start to get in a fight. Amy demands that Marcus clean up a spill, while Marcus refuses. Later, Amy asks Jonah to help. At first, Jonah is just the negotiator, but then turns nasty and defends Amy. Things get verbal when Marcus starts to shout and Jonah screams that Marcus is fired. Of course, Jonah doesn't have the authority to do this, but Amy, the floor supervisor, does it for him and fires Marcus, who gets all of the warehouse workers to walk out in support of him.\n\nIn Integrity Award, Jonah goes with Amy and helps Amy's parents pack things up before they move. Amy is first opposed to this, but Jonah is able to catch a ride with her, and asks Amy's parents to tell him cute things that Amy did when she was a child. Amy, embarrassed, asks Jonah to leave with her, and they have a grand old time in the truck, so much so that Amy hangs up a call from Adam in order to spend more time with Jonah.\n\nIn Glenn's Kids, Jonah and one of Glenn's foster children, Kristen, have a mutual attraction. Glenn does not support this and tries to covertly sabotage their relationship. But being the nice person that he is, he can't quite muster the evilness to do so and enlists Amy, who feeds lies to Kristen about bad things that Jonah has done, and causes Kristen to reconsider her choice. But in the end, Amy and Glenn's antics are uncovered and Kristin and Jonah date anyways.\n\nIn Cheyenne's Wedding, Jonah comes with Kristen and Amy comes with Adam. Before Cheyenne and Bo get married, the two couples meet and Jonah acts very awkward, seeming weird around Adam and almost abandoning Kristen. Near the end of the wedding, Adam leaves early and Kristen breaks up with Jonah. Amy and Jonah sit together on a bench outside, and Jonah, in the heat of the moment, calls Amy sexy, which surprises her.\n\nIn Tornado, Amy and Jonah hide under a countertop in the Pharmacy. When the tornado hits, they make out under the table and act awkward and odd around each other when they emerge from the tornado, unscathed.\n\nSeason Three[]\n\nIn Grand Re-Opening, Amy avoids Jonah all day, determined to not speak about their kiss during the tornado. But eventually, the two are forced to and stand together in Minions Costumes, and Amy admits that she plans to break up with Adam. Amy And Jonah Start It Up\n\nIn Part-Time Hires, Amy brings Emma into the store, who will be working there part-time. When Emma is more interested in texting her friends and Dad than working, Amy isn't amused and directs her to help out, but this just causes tension, while when Amy lets Emma off the hook, Emma's half-done work just causes problems (for instance, Justine falls after Emma stops mopping the floor). Amy is worried about being a bad parent and asks Jonah for help, saying that he can be strict with her. Jonah tries this out, but Glenn defends Emma and forces Jonah away.\n\nIn Sal's Dead, Amy accidentally sets up a date for Jonah and coworker Kelly when Amy is using Jonah's phone. Because Jonah doesn't know about this date, he acts clueless around Kelly, who acts sweet, but then throws a tantrum and pulls out a knife to stab Jonah, claiming that he is playing \"Mind games\" with her. Amy tries to cajole Kelly not to, but Kelly stabs Jonah anyway. When it turns out that everything is all a Halloween Prank, Kelly and Amy talk, and Amy is unsettled when Kelly hints that she might try to date Jonah.\n\nIn Health Fund, Amy and Jonah partner up to create an excellent and fair insurance plan for Cloud 9 employees. When things spiral out of hand after unintentional inequality and demands, Jonah and Amy relieve themselves from stress by talking drinks in the storm shelter. Out of nowhere, Kelly comes up and joins them, and once again, Amy doesn't seem to appreciate Kelly with Jonah.\n\nIn Viral Video, many employees are looking at Kelly's Instagram page and are amused by her videos. Amy peeks over Janet's shoulder to watch the video and is shocked when she notices that Jonah and Kelly are dating. Amy interrogates Jonah, and eventually, a frustrated Jonah bets Amy that she couldn't make an Instagram Video that would get 100 likes by the end of the day- Loser of the bet would have to clean out the rat traps.

Amy gets a talking to while Jonah and Kelly clean out the traps together.\n\nIn Groundhog Day, Cheyenne and Mateo convince Amy to get back into the dating pool. They begin rating employees, saying that Amy is low on the totem pole.

But they get too into the performance and actually kiss each other, lips connecting and all. Glenn and Dina call a meeting, where Jonah discovers that Amy has had a crush on him, making Jonah surprised and the employees thrilled for more drama.
