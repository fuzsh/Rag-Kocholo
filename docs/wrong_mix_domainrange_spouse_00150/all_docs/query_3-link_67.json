        "text": "Dear Amy: My husband of 45 years recently came to me with a proposal. He wants to deepen a friendship with a single woman 20 years younger.\n\nHe says she lifts his spirits, is creative, and is a great mom to her children.\n\nTheir conversations are lively and interesting, and he finds that he wants to be around her more often.\n\nI was flabbergasted and hurt to the core. To me, this is an emotional affair. Because of my reaction, he has labeled me as lacking self-esteem and accuses me of not trusting him.\n\nAm I overreacting to this proposal, or am I being perfectly reasonable?\n\n– Hurt Feelings\n\nDear Hurt: If it’s a true “proposal,” then you get to say, “No deal. I reject your proposal.”\n\nBut I don’t think this is a proposal. I think this is an announcement.\n\nYou’ve left out any context, but when you responded to this by revealing your own vulnerability, your husband chose to gaslight you.\n\nIn addition to highlighting this other woman’s great qualities, he is by implication drawing a contrast to you (“She’s a great mom to her kids” is a nice touch).\n\nBecause now – the way your husband is reframing this – your insecurity and lack of trust is driving him to this other relationship.\n\nPeople get to have friendships. Married people need friendships.\n\nBut the way to engage in a friendship with someone designed to threaten your partner (younger, single, lively, spirit-lifting) is to bring the new friend around and offer to share said friend with you, at least to the extent where it is obvious that this friendship will not threaten your marriage.\n\nThis new person sounds quite captivating. You should invite her to dinner to see what the fuss is all about. Wouldn’t it be wonderful if she could lift all of your spirits?\n\nYou and your husband could benefit from some professional counseling, which would help each of you to describe what about this particular episode is so important, from your individual and opposing perspectives.\n\nStories by Amy Dickinson\n\nAsk Amy: In her final column, Amy shares some wisdom and laments ‘I’ll miss having coffee with you’\n\nAsk Amy: It's wedding season! Check out these hilarious mishaps gathered from Amy's files\n\nAsk Amy: Is my friend a jerk for calling me a 'chump' after I did a good deed?"
