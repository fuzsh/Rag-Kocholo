        "text": "Share this!\n\nItâ€™s been the most wonderful week! Hoyt and I got married!\n\nOur wedding was in gorgeous Hanalei Bay, Hawaii. It was a small, intimate wedding on the north shore of the island of Kauai. We were surrounded by our families, our five grown children, and some of our closest friends.\n\nIt was so magical! We are feeling so blessed. Thank you for all your kind words, love, and well wishes!\n\nWhen I woke up on the morning of our wedding day, it was raining like crazy. I know rain on your wedding day is supposed to be good luck, but I was really hoping for a sunny beautiful day because our wedding was outside.\n\nWe ended up having the most gorgeous night! It was sunny and not too hot. There was a beautiful breeze, and we even had an amazing sunset!\n\nHere is a sneak peek at the first of our wedding pictures. We hope to have lots more pictures from our wedding photographer soon, so check back in a few weeks for even more! I hope to have videos to share, too!\n\nAll my love! -Amy"
