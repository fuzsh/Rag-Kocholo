        "text": "Despite their different backgrounds, they hit it off in the pods and it looked like love could really be blind as their connection remained the same in person.\n\nThey had a few issues around birth control, but nevertheless, they managed to put things behind them. With the blessing of Amy's father, who has been sceptical about the experiment beforehand, it looked like these two could be onto something good.\n\nChelsea even commented that they seemed to be the \"strongest couple\" amongst the Love Is Blind season 6 cast – something that didn't sit well with her own partner Jimmy.\n\nMore like this\n\nWith the weddings now airing on Netflix, did Amy and Johnny make it down the aisle? And are they still together today?\n\nHere's everything you need to know.\n\nDid Love Is Blind's Amy and Johnny get married?\n\nYes – Amy and Johnny did get married on Love Is Blind, making them the only couple to successfully say 'I do' at the end of the experiment!\n\nAhead of the wedding, Amy revealed that she'd asked Johnny's sister to be one of her bridesmaids and Amy's dad welcomed her into his family, saying that he loved their family.\n\nShe then chatted to her loved ones, one of whom dreamt of Amy's partner and saw a blonde man just like \"Johnny\".\n\nWhen Amy returned to the room, in her wedding gown, Johnny's sister could be seen getting emotional, while Amy's dad told her she looked like a \"princess\".\n\nAt the altar, Amy and Johnny read out their vows before saying \"I do\".\n\nFollowing the wedding, Johnny gushed that his wife was \"cool\" and the pair celebrated with their family.\n\nIn a cute speech, Amy's dad mentioned how he'd gained a \"son\" today.\n\nAre Love Is Blind's Amy and Johnny still together?\n\nWe'll have to wait until the Love Is Blind season 6 reunion on Wednesday (13th March) to find out for sure how things have gone for Amy and Johnny, but it looks like the pair are still together.\n\nThey are still following each other on social media and have been sharing lots of loved up photos on their Instagram pages.\n\nThe Love Is Blind reunion teaser trailer sees them coupled up on the sofa and looking very much in love.\n\nWe have all our fingers crossed for the lovebirds of season 6.\n\nWho is Amy?\n\nAge: 28\n\nOccupation: E-commerce specialist\n\nInstagram: @amytiffany\n\nAmy, 28, is an e-commerce specialist. She joined the experiment with the hope of finding a soulmate who could help break down her walls. As well as sharing her passion, Amy's future partner must establish a \"really good connection\" with her family and culture.\n\nWho is Johnny?\n\nAge: 28\n\nOccupation: Account executive\n\nInstagram: @johnny__mcintyre\n\nPrior to joining the show, Johnny had found trouble forming anything beyond a \"really surface level\" connection. He took part in the experiment to dig deep and find the woman of his dreams.\n\nLove Is Blind season 6, episodes 1-12 are available to stream on Netflix. Sign up for Netflix from £4.99 a month. Netflix is also available on Sky Glass and Virgin Media Stream.\n\nCheck out more of our Entertainment coverage or visit our TV Guide and Streaming Guide to find out what else is on."
