        "text": "Dear Amy: I married my high school sweetheart. We’ve been together for 50 years.\n\nWe had a great sexual relationship until five years ago.\n\nMy husband has a serious drinking problem which I have tolerated for decades. He has called me nasty and vulgar names, and now does nothing but watch TV and drink. When my father died last year, he didn’t offer an ounce of compassion – instead he made a cruel remark that still hurts so much.\n\nWe are both retired now, and I found out that I have an illness. I would like to travel while I am able, but he has no desire to go anywhere.\n\nHis drinking has caused the loss of friends and family and I’m tired of making excuses for him.\n\nI believe that I deserve to be happy at the end of my own life.\n\nI’d rather finish my time on earth happy and single than miserably married!\n\nI asked him to go to counseling and he claims he doesn’t need it, so I went to marriage counseling alone. I am still going – and it helps me tremendously!\n\nShould I divorce and finish my life doing what I enjoy? Or should I follow the advice of a few friends who have said, why bother leaving him after so many years?\n\nI want to say that it’s called “happiness,” but I feel like I am wrong justifying my feelings.\n\nI’m so tired of living in misery.\n\n– In Misery\n\nDear In Misery: You describe your life as miserable. And so – change it.\n\nYou’ve been seeking lots of advice from various constituencies, but you don’t mention seeing a lawyer. There are many practical and legal considerations you should educate yourself about, and after years of enabling and covering for your husband, it is time for you to take care of yourself.\n\nWhile you are pursuing legal advice and considering your options, you should also plan a trip – and take it. Sign up with a tour group or go with friends.\n\nBeing away from your home environment and on your own will bring an important perspective to your options and the choices you must make.\n\nAttending Al-anon meetings (Al-anon.org) would help you to understand some of your own behavior, and put you in proximity with others who are also coping with a loved one’s alcohol abuse.\n\n(You can email Amy Dickinson at askamy@amydickinson.com or send a letter to Ask Amy, P.O. Box 194, Freeville, NY 13068. You can also follow her on Twitter @askingamy or Facebook.)\n\n©2023 Amy Dickinson. Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC."
