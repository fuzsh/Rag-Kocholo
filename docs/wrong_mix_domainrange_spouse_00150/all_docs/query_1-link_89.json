        "text": "Demi Moore and Bruce Willis shock the world with plans of getting re-married and creating a happy home for their children. Demi Moore tells GH editors Bruce and I never stopped loving each other, the real reason we got divorced was our careers at the time. Now we’re ready to create a happy home for our children.\n\nAt 52, Demi Moore is looking younger than ever just in time for her wedding day! Many have tried to discover her secret !: Is it botox, facelifts, or just good lighting?\n\nAfter poking around the story and keeping our ears open, we can reveal the exclusive scoop detailing how she managed to transform herself within 3 weeks! Read on to find out.\n\n“Dr.Oz’s Miracle Anti-Aging Breakthrough – Joliesse Anti-Aging Moisturizer and Joliesse Serum combined.”\n\nWeeks before her wedding announcement, Dr. Oz had shared with Demi Moore a shocking skincare secret – one that ended up changing her life (and her face!) each and every day. Upon more research, we’ve discovered that clever women around the world and many Hollywood actresses – have been secretly using these products for a very long time.\n\nIt was an exclusive only celeb secret until Amy Davis, a 54-year-old mother of three from Los Angeles, California was featured on the Dr. Oz Show. Amy’s testimonial revolutionized the industry. A perfect example of how a little smart-thinking and ingenuity can help you avoid unnecessary health risks and save you thousands of dollars in doctors’ bills.\n\nLike most women, Amy didn’t have the extra cash to try out every celebrity-endorsed anti-aging “miracle cream” out there, let alone splurge on expensive elective medical procedures, like plastic surgery or facelifts.\n\nAmy’s Solution Featured On Dr. Oz\n\nAfter a year of doing thorough research and speaking to other women about their own skincare habits, she learned of two products that were yielding real results and helping women take years off their skin: Joliesse Anti-Aging Moisturizerand Joliesse Serum\n\nWhile each of these products was proven to be effective individually, one night, Amy made an accidental discovery that would revolutionize the whole skincare industry: she combined them.\n\nUsing the two products together, Amy’s results were noticeably better than what you’d find at medispas for $5,000 or more. This combination removed virtually 90% of all her wrinkles and problem areas. It tightened her face and neck, removing all signs of sagging, aging, and dehydrated skin. Amy was able to see these dramatic anti-aging results simply by using our exclusive links to bottles of both products, brought to you by Doctor Oz himself.\n\nNot long after, her easy, 2-product trick went viral and was featured on The Dr. Oz Show!\n\nOur Clinical Studies\n\nThrough our research, we discovered that the real secret to cell revival and skin rejuvenation are two key ingredients:\n\nMatrixyl\n\nPeptide\n\nThese are both natural ingredients that work together to erase wrinkles and fine lines at the cellular level – below the surface of the skin – which is why they’re so effective\n\nPeptide Most peptides function as moisture-binding agents and almost all of them have the theoretical cell-communicating ability to help skin repair itself. Those are exciting benefits, so long as you don’t rely on peptides alone. It takes a great mix of anti-aging ingredients for skin to look its smoothest, firmest, and, yes, its youngest.\n\nMatrixyl When included in skin care products, Glycine Soja offers numerous benefits. It is an anti-inflammatory agent for the skin. It is rich in vitamin E. As a result, the extract is found in anti-aging skin care products with a function to protect the skin from free radicals.\n\n“Dr. Oz calls Matrixyl & Peptide the secret to cheat your age.”\n\nCelebrities around the world like Halle Berry, Jennifer Aniston, and Sandra Bullock have all admitted to using Joliesse Anti-Aging Moisturizerand Joliesse Serum\n\n“Celebs have been raving about Joliesse Anti-Aging Moisturizer and Joliesse Serum“\n\n“They confess that it’s the secret to their youthful skin”\n\nDr. Richard Peters, a prominent dermatologist based in Beverly Hills, revealed to us that using Joliesse Anti-Aging Moisturizer and Joliesse Serum together is the celebrity secret to youthful skin because both products contain the purest and most powerful forms of Peptide and Matrixyl. Best of all the products are all-natural, perfectly safe for all skin types and have no nasty side effects.\n\nHere is Amy’s Story & 14 Day Cell Revival Results:\n\nBefore and after picture of Amy Davis. The picture on the right was taken after only\n\n14 days of using Joliesse Anti-Aging Moisturizer\n\nand Joliesse Serum.\n\n“How do I do it?”\n\n“The trick is to combine Joliesse Anti-Aging Moisturizer and Joliesse Serum. These two products both contain high concentrations of pure Peptide and Matrixyl in just the right concentrations. I also discovered that they contain all sorts of anti-oxidants, an ingredient called Dermaxyl (also known as facelift in a jar) and Ester-C (the active anti-aging compound in Vitamin C). The instructions were easy to follow but very specific: they’re important to follow precisely because it does make a visible difference. You apply just a light coat of Joliesse Anti-Aging Moisturizer on your face and neck after washing and drying your face, and gently pat Joliesse Serum around the eye area before bed time. I saw results almost overnight, but after 14 days, the results were literally shocking. I looked how I used to look 20 years ago!” – Amy\n\nWill This Work For You?\n\nThere are plenty of skincare gimmicks out there, and most of them are ridiculously expensive. With so many options, it’s only natural for you to be skeptical about the results, and so I challenge you to do what I did: try it for yourself! Conduct your own study and see the incredible results in your mirror at home. You won’t believe YOUR before and after!\n\nOnce you’ve experienced this anti-aging skin savior for yourself, please leave your comments below and share your success story with others, like Amy did. Document the progression and prove to the world that you don’t need to spend thousands of dollars to LOOK AND FEEL GREAT.\n\nRemember, you need to use both Joliesse Anti-Aging Moisturizer and Joliesse Serum in combination for best results.\n\nFor your convenience, we have provided the links that Amy used to get both Joliesse Anti-Aging Moisturizer and Joliesse Serum\n\nUse the links below for you BOTTLES and you will get the lowest possible shipping price as well.\n\nRemember, to get the BEST results you will want to try BOTH products together. Both serum and crème come with a 100% satisfaction guarantee. With the discounted shipping costs, you will be on your way to smooth skin for under 70. But hurry, these incredible creams are limited in supply."
