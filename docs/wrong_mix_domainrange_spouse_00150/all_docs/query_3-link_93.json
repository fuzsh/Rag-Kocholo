        "text": "EMMERDALE star Amy Walsh has revealed relationship struggles with husband Toby-Alexander Smith seven months after tying the knot.\n\nThe actress, who plays Tracy Robinson in the Dales, and former EastEnders villain Toby, 33, married in sun-drenched Montenegro in August where they were joined by family and friends.\n\nAppearing on today's edition of Lorraine, Amy, 37, admitted married life hasn't been easy due to the couple's manic work schedules.\n\nShe told stand-in host Christine Lampard: \"I've barely seen him since we got married so... we do feel like newlyweds. We've not even been together that long, in the grand scheme of things, so our relationship is still quite new and fresh but when you throw in a toddler in the mix and work commitments then it's crazy, but we're trying to get some time for each other. It's hard.\"\n\nAmy said that the wedding was the last period of \"quiet time\" the family has had together and revealed she and Toby have been like passing ships.\n\nShe continued: \"Then I went full throttle into a massive storyline. I barely saw either of them, and he then flew to Bulgaria and did a film out there and it's been constantly like that and it is a struggle. I don't have family around me to help. It's tricky, but you do it.\"\n\nIt's been a tough time on the Emmerdale set for Amy's alter-ego Tracy recently.\n\nThe Dales resident's marriage to Nate Robinson came to a dramatic end, leaving viewers devastated.\n\nTracy had a short-lived affair with Nate's uncle Caleb Miligan which ultimately led to the relationship breakdown.\n\nIn brutal fashion, Tracy told her husband: \"There is something wrong, yeah, but it’s not Frankie and it’s not my mental health. It’s us. I’m so sorry but I don’t love you anymore.”\n\nToby-Alexander has been busy working on TV movie An American in Austen, his first role since leaving Walford in 2022.\n\nHis soap tenure, which saw him turn into a cold-blooded serial killer, ended in heart-stopping fashion when cops swooped to finally arrest him following the deaths of wife Chantelle, Tina Carter and Kush Kazemi.\n\nBack in the real world, Amy and Toby's wedding day was a joyful occasion with a star-studded guest list.\n\nReflecting on the celebration in an interview with OK!, Amy called it the \"most perfect day\".\n\nShe said: \"It surpassed all my expectations and more. I felt so surprisingly present on the day and loved every second. Now I’m just in pure bliss.\n\n\"Our family and friends are really important to us and we wanted everyone to have the best time.\n\n“They all made such an effort to come out there for us. Friends left their kids for the first time and spent their money getting there. We wanted it to be really special.”\n\nAmong the guests was Amy's famous sister, Girls Aloud singer Kimberley Walsh, who performed at the ceremony.\n\nEx-EastEnders star Shona McGarty also performed a duet with TikTok sensation Sonny Tennet.\n\nEmmerdale favourites Natalie Ann Jamieson, Olivia Bromley and Louisa Clein also made the trip to Eastern Europe to watch their friend say her vows.\n\nThe happy couple chose to wed at the picturesque 17th century Talici Hill Rustic Villas - located at the foot of a mountain range - after visiting the location back in January.\n\nAmy had six bridesmaids and there were eight pageboys involved in the family occasion.\n\nIn an emotional moment, Amy's dad, who is living with incurable cancer, walked her down the aisle.\n\nToby, who played murderous villain Gray Atkins in Enders, called the moment \"poignant\".\n\nThe couple, who have a two-year-old daughter called Bonnie, got engaged in Ibiza in 2022."
