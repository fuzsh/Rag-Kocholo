        "text": "Dear Amy: My mother recently died, and I’m expecting a relatively substantial inheritance from her.\n\nMy dad died several years ago. My brother is also dead, and he is survived by two adult daughters.\n\nMy mother (who was a difficult person) told me she intended to halve the inheritance between my brother and me when he was still alive, but after he died, she then decided to pass her entire inheritance to me and leave nothing to my brother’s daughters (her only grandchildren).\n\nMy beloved brother always believed in fairness, and to me my mother’s favoritism is unacceptable. These granddaughters were good to her.\n\nI would like to take half of my inheritance and gradually gift it to my two nieces on an annual basis, so the gifts will stay under the legal limit where taxes would be incurred.\n\nThe problem is that my control freak, anxiety-ridden husband of 40 years, who feels we need more money (most people could use more money), has told me what he intends to do with the inheritance.\n\nHe wants to keep and invest it all, and to give a tiny amount to my sweet nieces.\n\nHe sees this as a financial issue of our “need,” and feels it is generous to give anything to my nieces. I view it as a marital issue and an issue of my wanting to do right by my dear brother, who would be brokenhearted to know about the situation.\n\nYour thoughts?\n\n— Loving Aunt\n\nDear Aunt: Before making any decisions, you should consult a financial planner with experience dealing with inheritance in your state. My understanding is that (depending on where you live) inheritance is special; unlike other income, earnings or real estate, inheritance is not considered marital property, unless you commingle it by depositing the inheritance money into a joint account.\n\nSo let’s assume that this is your money, and you have the right to spend it as you wish. If your husband inherits money, he will have the right to use it as he wishes.\n\nYour plan is to take half of this money (what you see as your brother’s half) and to give a portion of it to his daughters each year. A financial adviser will also let you know if this is a sound plan.\n\nThis leaves half of this “substantial inheritance” for you to use as you want — or as your husband wants, if you choose to share it with him.\n\nDear Amy: I have been dating “John” for three years now.\n\nWe have each been widowed for more than a decade.\n\nJohn wants me to live with him in his home, but he still has wedding portraits and lots of pictures of him with his late wife displayed around the house. He doesn’t plan on putting them away.\n\nI would be happy if he chose to confine these items to one bedroom.\n\nWe talked a lot about marriage but his constant talk of his “wife” makes me feel like we should just live separately.\n\nI have a deceased partner. I refer to my late husband frequently, too, but when we’re around lots of friends, I refer to him by his first name, and not as “my husband.”\n\nI have been through the same things as John regarding losing a spouse. I just want to live the rest of my life happily and move on.\n\nDo you think I’m asking too much? I just need your insight.\n\n— Ready for a Fresh Start\n\nDear Ready: If John wants you to move in with him, then the house wouldn’t be only his house, but your house, together.\n\nThis means that he should compromise regarding the decor.\n\nDoing this is a physical expression of literally “making space” for you.\n\nYou are approaching this in a spirit of compromise; he is not.\n\nJohn doesn’t sound ready to make space for you. Given the length of time that has passed since his wife’s death, I don’t think you should expect him to change.\n\nDear Amy: I was disappointed in your response to “Agnostic,” whose friend had re-established her Christian faith and had invited Agnostic to her baptism.\n\nThe kind thing is to show up for your friends, no matter what.\n\n— Disappointed\n\nDear Disappointed: Many readers agree with you.\n\n“Agnostic” believed her friend was making attempts to pressure her back into the fold. She did not want to attend this religious ritual. I suggested that she should offer her congratulations, while being honest about her reasons for not attending.\n\nYou can email Amy Dickinson at askamy@amydickinson.com or send a letter to Ask Amy, P.O. Box 194, Freeville, NY 13068. You can also follow her on Twitter @askingamy or Facebook."
