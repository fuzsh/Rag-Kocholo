        "text": "Amy Lee and Josh Hartzler embarked on their romantic journey in 2005 after being good friends for many years. Their mutual respect and understanding towards each other were inherent from the start, building a foundation for a strong bond. Amy couldn't resist Joshua's charm, and the couple took their relationship to the next level by tying the knot in 2007, which they have maintained with harmony ever since. Their shared interests and philosophies have allowed them to nurture their relationship for over a decade, and they continue to thrive till date.\n\nThe couple had son Jack Lion Hartzler on July 24, 2014.\n\nJosh Hartzler is renowned as an accomplished therapist, but he's perhaps most widely known as the husband of Amy Lee, the lead singer of the band Evanescence. His understanding nature and supportive temperament have always been appreciated by Amy, attributing these traits for their successful marriage and relationship.\n\nThe bond between Shaun Morgan and Amy Lee developed quite conspicuously during the mid-2000s. Their professional circles overlapped, which facilitated them to spend considerable time together and share professional notes. Their similar musical interests sparked a romantic link, but the relationship was short-lived, lasting from 2003 to 2005. Although the breakup was quite public and somewhat contentious, the details were mostly kept under wraps from their audience.\n\nShaun Morgan is primarily known for his role as the lead vocalist and guitarist of the renowned South-African rock band, Seether. His powerful vocals and distinct musical style have earned him and his band international fame.\n\nPrior to founding Evanescence, Amy Lee and Ben Moody were in a tumultuous and abusive relationship that continued well into their time as bandmates. Their relationship began in 1994 and lasted until 2003.\n\nBen Moody is a musician, singer, songwriter, and record producer. He is best known as a co-founder of the successful rock band, Evanescence, alongside Amy Lee, until his departure in 2003."
