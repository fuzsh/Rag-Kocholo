        "text": "What could be more serene and refreshing than a weekend camping trip in Santa Barbara — with Demi Moore, Ashton Kutcher, a Kabbalah instructor, some nosy campers armed with cameras and a tent full of bad karma?\n\nWhether Kutcher and Moore really are trying save their marriage — or simply make it look as if they are, following his alleged affair with a 23-year-old girl in San Diego — the couple spent last weekend camping at Cachuma Lake, one day after attending Yom Kippur services Friday in Los Angeles. The couple’s Kabbalah instructor Yehuda Berg and Kutcher’s friend Eric Buterbaugh accompanied them.\n\nSounds romantic.\n\nThe foursome was pestered by neighboring campers who kept trying to snap photos of the beleaguered couple. Radar Online and Star magazine posted pictures of an agitated Moore trying to wave the shutterbugs away. According to Star, Moore was heard imploring an amateur paparazzo, “Please don’t take photos of me and my family. Please don’t expose this.”\n\nKutcher and Moore are not Jewish, but like many celebs, they follow the mystical faith of Kabbalah. The two reportedly attended a Kabbalah-based marriage counseling session seven weeks ago.\n\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR BRUTAL DICTATOR, HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU!: Hilary Swank and Jean-Claude Van Damme are facing a backlash for attending a lavish birthday party thrown for Chechen provincial leader Ramzan Kadyrov, the 35-year-old dictator accused of employing brutal measures to suppress Islamic separatists in his country.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter says both actors were paid for their appearances at the Oct. 5 bash in Grozny, the Chechen capital. Several other stars, including Kevin Costner, Eva Mendes and Shakira, were also invited but declined, citing scheduling conflicts or other reasons.\n\nHuman Rights Watch called on the stars who attended the party to reimburse any money that they were paid to participate.\n\n“Ramzan Kadyrov is linked to a litany of horrific human rights abuses. It’s inappropriate for stars to get paid to party with him,” the organization said.\n\nNeither Swank, who previously had said she would not attend the event, nor Van Damme have commented on the matter.\n\nKadyrov was appointed president of Chechnya in 2007 by Russian leader Vladimir Putin. He replaced his father, Akhmad Kadyrov, a onetime Muslim cleric and separatist who did an about-face and aligned with Putin, his onetime enemy, to help bring Chechnya closer into Moscow’s fold before being assassinated. Now, Ramzan Kadyrov is seen as following in his father’s footsteps.\n\nSERVE HIS PUBLIC OBLIGATIONS, HE WILL: A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away — OK, Marin County — “Star Wars” creator George Lucas weathered many a heated hearing at the Marin Civic Center over his Skywalker Ranch development. On Tuesday, he was back at Civic Center, this time for jury duty, reports the Marin Independent Journal.\n\nIn the end, the force was with Lucas — he was dismissed by the judge.\n\nTHIS AND THAT: Mitch Winehouse has reached a deal to write a book about his daughter, singer Amy Winehouse, publisher HarperCollins says. The book is due out next summer. Financial terms weren’t disclosed. Amy Winehouse died in July.\n\nJavier Bardem has been cast as the villain in the next James Bond movie, he disclosed in an interview with Christiane Amanpour on “Nightline.” He declined to provide specifics, including whether he’ll revive that creepy haircut (brrr!!!) he used in “No Country For Old Men.”\n\nHBO announced Tuesday that Michael Douglas and Matt Damon will star in “Behind the Candelabra,” a film about the relationship between Liberace (Douglas) and his younger live-in lover, Scott Thorson (Damon).\n\nAdele led the pack in American Music Awards nominations announced Tuesday. The British singer garnered four bids, including artist of the year. Others receiving multiple nominations were Katy Perry, Lil Wayne, Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Taylor Swift and The Band Perry.\n\nTODAY IN HISTORY\n\nToday is Wednesday, Oct. 12, the 285th day of 2011. There are 80 days left in the year.\n\n1492 (according to the Old Style calendar): Christopher Columbus arrived with his expedition in the present-day Bahamas.\n\n1810: The German festival Oktoberfest was first held in Munich to celebrate the wedding of Bavarian Crown Prince Ludwig and Princess Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen.\n\n1870: Gen.
