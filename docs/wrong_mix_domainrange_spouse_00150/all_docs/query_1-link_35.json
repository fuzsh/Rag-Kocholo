        "text": "Even after breakups, families still make it work. Ashton Kutcher and former stepdaughter Rumer Willis hung out at six years after his divorce from Demi Moore. The pair appeared have a lively, natural conversation outside a bar in Los Angeles. Kutcher was previously married to Moore from 2003 to 2013. Two years after the couple divorced, Kutcher married his former That 70s Show costar, Mila Kunis, in 2015. Prior to her relationship with Kutcher, Moore was married to actor Bruce Willis from 1987 to 2000. The former couple share daughter Rumer, 30, along with two other daughters, Scout, 27, and Tallulah, 25.\n\nThe The Ranch actor and The Masked Singer contestant had dinner and drinks at Studio City’s Black Market Liquor Bar on Wednesday. Since his divorce from the Ghost actress, Kutcher has remained close to his former stepdaughters. Kunis has been extremely supportive of her husband’s close relationship to his former stepchildren. The actress was recently on an episode of Marc Maron’s WTF podcast where she defended her husband’s first marriage. “They had three kids they were raising,” Kunis said. “It was, like, a normal life… He was younger, but he loved those kids.”\n\nKunis and Kutcher are now raising a young family of their own. The couple, who married in July 2015, share daughter Wyatt, 4, and son, Dimitri, 2.. It’s clear that family is important to both Kutcher and Kunis and will continue to be for years to come."
