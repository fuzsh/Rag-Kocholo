Some shuffling at the start of act 1 and act 2 when I take my phone out of my pocket. My phone was on the floor, so the base is a bit heavy at times.

The seat next to me kept squeaking throughout the show. My phone was on the floor, so the base is a bit heavy, but it's still a relatively clear audio. Some shuffling about 5 mins and 15 mins into act 1 due to latecomers. There's also a bit of rustling towards the end of act 2 when I pick up my phone.

Slight disturbance partway through the first act, as someone was coming to find their seat. You may also hear my friend and I reacting to some of the plot points.

(Still audible, though.) Audience was pretty terrible– someone’s phone goes off twice in Act 1, and there’s a crying baby on and off through Act 2, although the audio doesn’t pick it up too much.\n\n2022, Jan. 11th Third National Tour, Chicago, IL (m4a untracked)\n\nStillreprise’s Master.

The man next to me mumbled and hummed some things throughout the show and I’m not sure if they were picked up or not. I was literally right next to the speaker so please for the love of God turn down the volume before you press play on act two.\n\n2022, Mar. 10th Third National Tour, Philadelphia, PA (m4a untracked)\n\nMusain’s Master\n\nCameron Anika Hill (u/s Laurey Williams), Sean Grandillo (Curly McLain), Christopher Bannow (Jud Fry), Sis (Ado Annie), Barbara Walsh (Aunt Eller), Hennesy Winkler (Will Parker), Bent Mirman (Ali Hakim), Hannah Solo (Gertie Cummings), Mitch Tebo (Andrew Carnes), Ugo Chukwu (Cord Elam), Gabrielle Hamilton (Lead Dancer), Patrick Clanton (Mike)\n\nNotes: First known audio of Cameron’s Laurey!

The recording is very quiet during a lot of scenes, and audience rustling (and constant coughing – so glad the FOH staff kept ‘reminding’ us we didn’t ~have to~ wear masks anymore ) didn’t help. Also, I’m sure the non-miked(?) portions worked great at the original Broadway venue, but unfortunately not so much in a giant touring house like this (and I set in front orchestra). Apparently it was especially bad that night cause there was a 10-minute technical pause during “Lonely Room”. At this point, there was a mass exodus of confused/bored/upset patrons who apparently did not know what they signed up for. It took 2 tries to restart (I cut out the 10 min pause but you get to enjoy my “oh come on” when the mic still doesn’t work), but they got back on track and wrapped up Act 1; at intermission some of the more polite boomers left too, leaving the house pretty much half-empty (it was almost full at the start of the show). Act 2 went without an issue, PLUS we got to self-upgrade from side to center orchestra, PLUS the remaining audience was much better. ANYWAYS, the show itself left a deep impression on me – I knew what I was going in for, and now I’m even more curious to see a “traditional” staging. It was my first time experiencing Oklahoma! aside from knowing some of the songs, and I wouldn’t have it any other way. The u/s Jud was amazing, especially with him being most affected by the technical issues; it was also fun to see Girl!Mike. The Sis-Hennessy-Benj trio slayed too, along with Sasha Hutchings.\n\n2022, April 00 Third National Tour (mp4/mp3 tracked & untracked)\n\nTheatreCouple14's master. NFS. Includes Video, Audio (Tracked and Untracked), and Digital Program\n\nSasha Hutchings (Laurey), Sean Granville (Curly), Sis (Ado Annie) Christopher Bannow (Jud Fry), Barbara Walsh (Aunt Eller), Hennesy Winkler (Will), Ugo Chukwu (Cord), Benj Mirman (Ali), Hannah Solow (Gertie), Mitch Tebo (Andrew), Patrick Clanton (Mike), Cameron Anika Hill (u/s Lead Dancer)\n\nBeautiful wide-shot phone boot from the front of the orchestra. Unfortunately a little too close to get the whole stage at once (some of the action upstage is missed), and a head covers the left side during some scenes, but very watchable. This production has blackouts for about 20 minutes of the show in 3 places, so that's also a thing.

Recorded from mezzanine. Nearby neighbor crinkled candy packages for part of Act 1, and there's a fair amount of talking from several groups of nearby people, less in Act 2 after some of them moved. Otherwise an excellent audio.

Insane energy and the love this show truly deserved. Several emotional moments from the cast including Briga and Aisha’s incredibly teary Brightest Morning Star. File includes understudy board which is essentially announcing Ryann returned to Belinda, Amy is back to Goldilocks, and Matt on for Stephen.

Contains a mix of Kate Nash's newly written & previously released songs – but significantly reorchestrated, so it doesn't feel like a jukebox show at all. It's marketed as a \"dance musical\" (think more ballet than the music genre), and the choreography is indeed a significant part of the atmosphere, but the audio is still very enjoyable to listen to in isolation.\n\n2022, Oct. 13th MCC Theater, Off-Broadway\n\nZaltyteardrops’ Master.\n\nKate Nash (Narrator), Terrence Mann (King Belen’s), Karine Plantadit (Queen Roksana), Ryan Vandenboom (Henri), Hannah Cruz (Camile), Gaby Diaz (Princess Tooba), Ryan Steele (Jacques), Tyler Hanes (Count), Ensemble: Haley Fish, Jennifer Florentino, Jacob Guzman, Tyler Hanes, Thayne Jasperson, Reed Luplau, Morgan Marcell, Simone Rose, Ida Saki, Ahmad Simmons, Deanne Stewart, Voltaire Wade-Greene, Katie Webber\n\nNotes: Preview.

This performance was incredible, but it definitely has the feel of “this is the final show, f**k it, lets have fun), so lots of laughing between the cast, jokes to the audience.\n\nA prop telephone broke quite near the beginning so there’s lots of ad-libbing around that.\n\nThere was no speech at the beginning or end.\n\n2023, Mar. 31st Fortune Theatre, West End, London, UK (m4a untracked)\n\nMagicintheMess’s Master.
