        "text": "Blake Lively revealed a tidbit behind the success of her marriage to Ryan Reynolds. Dating back to the beginning of their relationship, the Gossip Girl alum explained recently how she made it work with the in-demand actor. Lively told her Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants co-star and longtime friend, Amber Tamblyn, that she and Reynolds created a “rule” to make sure they never got too busy to spend time together. When the couple first embarked on their romance in 2011, they made a pact not to work at the same time so that they “could always prioritize our personal life.”\n\nLively and Reynolds met on the set of the DCEU flop The Green Lantern in 2010, though they were both in other relationships at the time. The pair eventually got together in 2011, following Lively’s split from her Gossip Girl co-star Penn Badgley in September 2010 and the Deadpool star’s divorce from Scarlett Johansson in December of that same year. At the time, Lively was still starring in the popular teen drama series while Reynolds’s film career was thriving, so this wasn’t a simple commitment to make. The mom of four acknowledged the challenges of adhering to this rule, emphasizing the necessity of hard work and balance, given her demanding schedule. “That takes working really hard when we’re not,” Lively told Tamblyn, adding that they would sometimes shoot three episodes of Gossip Girl at once.\n\nRELATED: Blake Lively Celebrating Breast Pumping in Public Gets Praised\n\nThirteen years and four daughters later, this rule seems to be working out for them. “We don’t split up,” Reynolds previously told Access Hollywood of keeping their growing family together. “We go travel all over the place, and we just all go together. I think that’s been the best part of it is that we really don’t spend a lot of time apart. I get to spend a lot of time with my girls.”\n\nThese Celebrities Share The Same Ex\n\nHollywood can be a small dating pool. Celebrities hook up with each other in their same social circles. And there is no shortage of Hollywood divorces. The dating world of the rich and the famous is small for those who are in it. As a result, there are many celebrities who share the same lovers.\n\nTake a look below at which celebrities have been with the same person:\n\nLaila Abuelhawa is the Top 40 and Hip-Hop pop culture writer for Beasley Media Group.
