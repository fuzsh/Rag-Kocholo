        "text": "Amy Robach and T.J. Holmes made headlines of their own in 2022 when their private romance was revealed. One year later, the pair has remained strong and in love, amid losing their jobs and being replaced at GMA3 following their workplace romance.\n\nHowever, the pair has no longer kept their relationship behind closed doors. The couple continued to put their love on display during vacations, the New York City Marathon, and have even spoken out and told their story -- in their own words on iHeartRadio's Amy & T.J. podcast.\n\n\"To be clear, we were outed as being in a relationship, but everyone else thought we were being outed as adulterers, being outed as cheating on our spouses, and it wasn't the case,\" Holmes said during the premiere episode, clearing up the biggest misconception of their romance.\n\nWhen the news of their romance seemed to be cooling down, ET confirmed that their exes, Andrew Shue and Marliee Fiebig, were dating.\n\n\"Initially they had no interest in each other but bonded over the trauma from their respective breakups,\" the source says.\n\nET is taking a look at their past marriages, developing friendship, on-air chemistry, Instagram and red carpet debut!\n\nBefore Robach and Holmes...\n\nRobach was married to Tim McIntosh from 1996 to 2008, and shares daughters Ava and Analise with him. She and Shue, who is a dad to sons Nate, Aidan and Wyatt from his marriage to Jennifer Hageney, tied the knot in 2010.\n\nIn October 2021, the former couple went on to pen a book together about blending their families. The last photos Robach shared alongside Shue came in June 2022. A source told ET that the couple separated shortly thereafter.\n\nRobach stopped wearing her wedding ring in photos she posted to her Instagram in October. Later that year, Robach listed her and Shue's apartment, and it went under contract in November for $5.2 million.\n\nShortly after the news of Robach and Holmes' relationship broke, Shue scrubbed his Instagram of all photos of the GMA co-host. A source told ET that Robach and Shue's divorce is expected to be settled soon.\n\nAs for Holmes, he and Amy Ferson, with whom he shares daughter Brianna and son Jaiden, divorced in 2007. Three years later, Holmes married Fiebig. They welcomed a daughter named Sabine in January 2013.\n\nBack in 2012, Holmes, who was a correspondent for BET at the time, opened up about his successful marriage with Fiebeg. Noting that there are no secrets to a happy union, Holmes simply advised other married couples to \"do the right thing, treat each other well and respect each other.\"\n\nIn honor of his 10-year wedding anniversary in 2020, Holmes shared a social media post dedicated to the attorney, in which he praised her for showing him nothing but grace and patience, despite him giving her \"plenty of reasons\" to walk out the door.\n\nA source told ET that Holmes and Fiebig separated in the summer of 2022.\n\nHolmes' Other Affairs\n\nAfter news of Robach and Holmes' relationship broke, it was revealed that their romance was not Holmes' first workplace relationship. ET learned that the TV personality had a year-long affair with a producer who left the morning show in 2017. Additionally, two sources told ET that Holmes was also romantic with a woman who no longer works at the network.\n\nLater, another source told ET that, several years ago, Holmes had an office romance with a script coordinator who was more than a decade his junior.\n\nThe Friendship Begins\n\nA source told ET that the co-hosts, who helmed GMA's lunchtime hour since 2020, have been \"very close friends for years,\" but grew \"even closer\" as their working relationship evolved.\n\nThey never shied away from promoting their on-air bond, with Robach often posting Instagram pics of the pair matching on-set, of their special event coverage, and more.\n\n\"The two have a special bond that has been evident to staff for years,\" a source told ET, \"so it’s not surprising a relationship has formed, but it is shocking that it has come to light in this way.\"\n\nThe pair's bond grew as they went on several remote assignments together, including to London where they covered Queen Elizabeth II's Platinum Jubilee over the summer and her funeral in September. They also attended the Daytime Emmys and the Special Olympics together.\n\nOutside of work, the pair bonded over running, even competing in the New York City half-marathon together. They often ran alongside Robach's husband, as evidenced in a series of since-deleted photos on Robach's Instagram.\n\n\"Amy and T.J. had always had a warm, supportive friendship and they bonded over their love of running,\" a source told ET, adding that their closeness caused \"whispers at ABC about a possible relationship between them.\"\n\nA source told ET that Robach and Holmes' romance began around August 2022, shortly after Fiebig became suspicious of her husband's relationship with his co-worker.\n\n\"They had already been through so much trying to fix their marriage after his affair with the former GMA producer and then she saw a birthday card from Amy that was way too familiar,\" the source said of Holmes and Fiebig. \"[Marilee] was done after that.\"\n\nRelationship Comes to Light\n\nThe extent of Robach and Holmes' relationship didn't come to light until November 2022, when The Daily Mail published PDA pics of the pair.\n\n\"Their relationship has been going on in secret for quite some time, but how long is truly unknown, as they did their best to keep things professional and private,\" a source told ET. \"Whenever they worked on set everything was fun, sometimes flirty, but always professional.”\n\nRomance in Review\n\nJust over a week after the GMA3 co-anchors' romance was revealed, multiple sources told ET that ABC would be conducting a review to see if the pair violated any company policies, specifically the company's morality clause.\n\nThe investigation is also looking into whether Holmes' alleged relationships with other ABC employees violated policies about relationships between bosses and subordinates.\n\nAmid the investigation, Robach and Holmes were kept off air. Kimberly Godwin, president of ABC News, addressed the situation during a morning editorial meeting, a source told ET.\n\n\"I want to say that while the relationship is not a violation of company policy, I have really taken the last few days to think about and work through what is the best for ABC News,\" she said. \"For now, I'm going to take Amy and T.J. off the air while we figure this out.\"\n\nIn December 2022, Godwin revealed in a letter to ABC News staff that the duo would \"remain off-air pending the completion of an internal review.\"\n\n\"Amy and T.J. will remain off-air pending the completion of an internal review, and there will be a rotation of anchors at GMA3 for the time being,\" the letter read. \"It is my hope that we will continue to focus our energy on what we do best, and I want all of you to know how immensely proud I am of your hard work and professionalism.\"\n\nStill Going Strong\n\nDespite the scandal that ensued after their romance became public, a source told ET in early December that Holmes and Robach are \"definitely\" still together.\n\n\"Both T.J. and Amy are trying to keep a low profile and let the dust settle,\" the source said. \"It’s still unclear as to what, if any disciplinary action might be taken, but for now, both are laying low, and trying to move on with life.\"\n\nLater that month, Holmes and Robach were spotted taking a stroll together through Manhattan. The photos, obtained by The Daily Mail, marked the first time the pair had been seen together in public since ABC News announced they'd been suspended from GMA3.\n\nAfter Christmas, Robach and Holmes were photographed together at the Atlanta Airport. Their travels continued into the new year, when they were spotted kissing in Miami.\n\n\"Amy and T.J. are going strong and are committed to exploring their relationship and seeing where it takes them in the future,\" a source told ET. \"They haven't been shy with their public affection in the past couple weeks, and seem unfazed by their relationship coming light.\"\n\nHolmes Files for Divorce\n\nHolmes' travels with Robach came amid the end of his and Fiebig's marriage. In late December, Holmes filed for divorce in New York City. Shortly thereafter, Fiebig broke her silence on her husband's scandal.\n\n\"During the holiday season and in light of the challenging times, Marilee's sole focus has remained on the overall best interest of her 9-year-old daughter,\" Fiebig's attorney, Stephanie Lehman, said in a statement to ET. \"To that end, T.J.'s lawyer and I have been working together to move their divorce forward privately, expeditiously and as amicably as possible.\"\n\n\"Notwithstanding, we continue to be disappointed by T.J's lack of discretion, respect and sensitivity toward Marilee and the party's daughter,\" Lehman added. \"Marilee has been touched by the outpouring of support and looks forward to a new beginning in this new year.\"\n\nOut at 'GMA3'\n\nIn January, a source told ET that there was \"a chance\" that Robach and Holmes would not return to GMA3, noting that \"the longer this process takes, the more likely they won't return to\" their respective positions. The source added that GMA3's strong ratings in the wake of Robach and Holmes' absence did not bode well for the pair.\n\n\"Everything has returned to normal as it can be at this time, but there is still an unsettling feeling in the air,\" another source told ET shortly thereafter. \"No one knows where the investigation will lead or what Amy or T.J.’s fates ultimately will be. Everyone just wants this investigation wrapped up soon so that the production and all involved can finally move on.\"\n\nFollowing a mediation session with the network, sources told ET that Robach and Holmes were officially out at GMA3.\n\nThree sources told ET that while exit agreements have not been signed on the dotted line, Holmes will not return to ABC, but Robach's future at the network is still unclear. One source said it's unlikely Robach will stay at ABC, while another noted that her exit agreement is still being sorted out.\n\n\"No one wanted it to come to this, but derogatory information just kept coming up. Once the investigation went several weeks, most people knew that this would be the outcome,\" one source said. \"T.J. will get a payout. Ties are severed. T.J.'s issues got all the headlines but Amy is no angel.\"\n\nTMZ first broke the news, reporting that both anchors would receive payouts per their contracts after the \"extremely contentious\" mediation. Per the outlet, ABC reps accused Holmes and Robach of various forms of misconduct, including an allegation that Robach had liquor in her office and drank on the job.\n\n\"The idea she was drinking on the job and showing up to work intoxicated is absurd,\" a source told ET. \"If that was the case, her behavior would've shown through several years ago. It’s a shock to hear all the allegations being leveled at Amy, when all she is really at fault for is falling for her colleague.\"\n\nReplacements Named\n\nOn May 11, ABC News announced that Eva Pilgrim and DeMarco Morgan will co-host Good Morning America's third hour. The network additionally revealed that the pair will be joined by Dr. Jennifer Ashton, who is ABC News' chief health and medical correspondent.\n\nAfter the announcement was made, a source told ET that the replacement choices were \"not surprising.\"\n\nThe source said that the newcomers' \"overall chemistry, good rapport with one another, and general likability, not only amongst the audience watching, but among staff across ABC News,\" led to them landing the gig.\n\n\"Eva has always been kind and dedicated to her work, and a staple for at ABC for more than seven years, so it's no surprise she would be selected to lead GMA3 into a new era,\" the source said. \"As for DeMarco, he's really risen to the challenge and stepped up to the plate over the past few months, essentially uprooting his life in L.A. to make the move to NYC, and that did not go unnoticed. He’s charming, has charisma and seems to get along well with Eva. It’s a new era for GMA3.\"\n\nThe source also noted that \"it's also no surprise that the two co-anchors would bring much needed diversity to an hour that was already lacking.\"\n\nAs for Robach and Holmes, another source told ET, \"Their relationship appears strong and they continue to support one another via a united front. Expect to see them back working in some capacity, but when that will happen remains to be seen.\"\n\nDivorces Finalized\n\nRobach and Shue officially ended their marriage in March 2023. In October 2023, just ahead of the year anniversary of when Holmes and Robach's romance was revealed, Holmes and Fiebig settled their divorce.\n\nThe pair shares a daughter, Sabine.\n\nHolmes was also previously married to Amy Ferson, with whom he shares a daughter, Brianna, and a son, Jaiden. They would go on to divorce in 2007.\n\nInstagram Official\n\nIn October, weeks after Holmes finalized his divorce, the pair took their love to Instagram.\n\nHolmes took to the social media site to share the first official pic with his girlfriend and display some PDA as they stood on the field of Arkansas' Razorback Stadium.\n\n\"lostDawg #SicEmSooie #WPS 🐗,\" Holmes wrote next to the picture. The duo were in the area to watch Holmes' alma mater take on Mississippi State. Holmes turned off the comments next to the picture, but the over 14,000 likes proved that the world had eyes on the moment.\n\nA source told ET at the time that the IG love proved that their romance was stronger than ever.\n\n\"T.J. posting a picture with Amy just solidifies the two are going strong and ready to make their relationship public,\" a source said of the relationship milestone. \"The two have gone through a lot together and continue to be a united front as they sort their lives out and work towards building a future.\"\n\nReady to Tell Their Story\n\nOn Nov. 1, the former GMA co-anchors announced they were still in the storytelling business with their new podcast.\n\nRobach used the announcement to make things IG official on her Instagram.\n\n\"How's this for Instagram official? #silentnomore 🎤\" Holmes and Robach captioned a joint Instagram post, revealing the news. In the promo image for their show, the couple is all smiles as they stand together, Holmes' arm wrapped around Robach from behind while she reaches up and touches his shoulder.\n\nIn a press release for the iHeartRadio podcast titled, Amy & T.J., the pair will \"explore meaningful conversations about current events, pop culture, and everything in between. Nothing is off limits.\"\n\nAt the time, a source told ET that the pair would share the details from their highly publicized relationship -- on their own terms.\n\n\"Amy and T.J. are ready to tell their side of the story once and for all,\" the source said. \"Both look forward to clearing the air, and hope to continue telling thoughtful stories they hope listeners will appreciate. They’re ready for this next step professionally and look forward to their podcast debut.\"\n\nLove on the Run\n\nDays after announcing their podcast, Holmes and Robach marked another important milestone in their relationship. Together, the pair completed the 2023 New York City Marathon. Over the course of their public relationship, the duo ran smaller marathons. Prior to the news of their romance, they shared pictures from previous marathons and training sessions.\n\nAfter completing the 26.2-mile marathon, the pair posed for a photo. Commemorating the moment, Holmes took to Instagram to show off his new tattoo. Holmes added the date to his bicep tattoo of the marathon's route with the completed dates.\n\n\"#inkupdate #NYCMarathon 11.6.2022 x 11.5.2023 @jakkichantattoos @uplifttattoo,\" he wrote.\n\nRed Carpet Official\n\nOn Dec. 3, Robach and Holmes got dressed to the nines and made their red carpet debut as a couple at the 2023 KIIS-FM iHeartRadio Jingle Ball concert at The Kia Forum in Los Angeles.\n\nFor the occasion, Robach wore a form-fitting little black dress. For his part, Holmes coordinated in a black suit with a relaxed white shirt -- which he unbuttoned at the collar. The pair weren't shy when it came to putting their romance on display as they kissed and hugged while the cameras took their picture.\n\nLove From Their Perspective\n\nOne year to the day that they were let go from ABC, iHeartRadio's Amy & T.J. podcast premiered on Dec. 5. Holmes and Robach didn't waste any time as they kept their promise and began their podcast by telling their story.\n\nDuring the premiere episode, the pair set the record straight on the timeline of their romance and the status of their prior relationships with Shue and Fiebig when they began dating.\n\n\"Nov. 30, 2022 was the day that we were, and this is very important, we were outed,\" Holmes explained on the podcast.\n\n\"We were not caught,\" Robach echoed.\n\n\"To be clear, we were outed as being in a relationship, but everyone else thought we were being outed as adulterers, being outed as cheating on our spouses, and it wasn't the case,\" Holmes said.\n\nBoth Holmes and Robach doubled down on the fact that they were not cheating on their spouses, and that each of them were in the process of getting a divorce. Robach explained that Shue had moved out of their shared home \"months before\" the news of their relationship broke. Holmes said that he was photographed at the apartment he resided in by himself, after him and Fiebig separated.\n\nThe pair also detailed the hard parts of their relationship amid the scandal. During one of the more emotional moments, including the time with Robach had to do a welfare check on Holmes, who was texting her in \"past tense\" in the days after their pictures were released. When Robach arrived at this home, she found Holmes laid out on his bed, after drinking a lot of vodka and consuming multiple edibles.\n\nStill, the pair celebrated how far their love has come in one year.\n\n\"We have fought for love and I can say that I've never been happier. I am with my best friend,\" Robach, 50, shared. \"We have gone through, I think it's fair to say, a year of hell, but we have had each other through it all.\"\n\nA Romantic Twist\n\nOn the same day that Holmes and Robach's podcast premiered, their former spouses made news of their own.\n\nAccording to multiple reports, their respective exes, Fiebig and Shue, have made a love connection. Page Six reported that the Melrose Place actor and lawyer have been dating for around six months, after connecting over the shared trauma of their then-spouses' highly publicized relationship.\n\nET reached out to Fiebig and Shue for comment and received no word. Robach and Holmes did not speak out about their exes' connection."
