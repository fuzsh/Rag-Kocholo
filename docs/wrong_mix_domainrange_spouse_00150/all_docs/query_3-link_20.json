        "text": "Amy Schumer is ready to take the stage at the 94th Academy Awards alongside fellow cohosts Wanda Sykes and Regina Hall. Apart from her coveted 2020 Oscars hosting gig, the comedian is also celebrating her new Hulu dramedy and the upcoming release of her new book, . Even with lots of projects keeping her busy, Amy knows she can always count on her support system back at home — comprised of her husband, professional chef Chris Fischer, and their son, Gene David.\n\nSince the beginning, Amy has been open about their whirlwind romance, her husband's autism diagnosis and their journey to parenthood. It all began in November 2017 when Entertainment Tonight shared a paparazzi photo of Amy and Chris on a date. Unsurprisingly, the sight sparked lots of buzz on the internet. Though there was no confirmation that they were an official couple, Amy surprised her fans in February 2018 when she announced that she and Chris had gotten married via wedding photos in a now-deleted Instagram post.\n\nShortly after, in April 2018, Amy opened up on The View about how it all went down. According to the actress, she and Chris knew each other \"longer\" than the public was aware of. \"You know that I’m not like a fool. I’m not impulsive like that,\" Amy told cohost Joy Behar about walking down the aisle pretty quickly. \"We have known each other for about a year now and we’ve been living together already for six months. It’s not a long courtship but it’s not like we had a great weekend in Vegas and threw in the towel.”\n\nWhen asked if there were going to be \"babies in the future,\" Amy spoke candidly. \"I hope so. Maybe if we're lucky enough,\" she said. Fast forward, in October 2018, Amy announced she and Chris were expecting their first child in a subtle Instagram Stories post her friend journalist and author Jessica Yellin shared. The next month, the comedian spread the happy news with an emotional Instagram video of an ultrasound.\n\nAmy and Chris welcomed a son named Gene David on May 5, 2019. \"10:55 pm last night. Our royal baby was born,” she captioned a since-deleted Instagram photo as a nod to Meghan Markle and Prince Harry who also had their son, Archie, that same day . In the sweet family pic, Amy holds Gene while Chris gives her a kiss on the forehead.\n\nNearly a year later, in January 2020, Amy revealed that she and Chris were trying to grow their family through IVF. \"I’m a week into IVF and feeling really run down and emotional,\" she wrote on Instagram. We are freezing my eggs and figuring out what to do to give Gene a sibling. ❤️.\"\n\nLater that summer, Amy's documentary premiered on HBO Max in July 2020. In the three-parter, the stand-up comedian discussed her pregnancy journey and gave insight into her life as a married mom. Amy also touched on her husband's Asperger's diagnosis. She shared her hope of helping destigmatize the conversations around it by being vocal about the struggles and triumphs of their relationship.\n\nWhat's more, Amy revealed how she and Chris first connected. It turned out that they were both in Martha's Vineyard when Amy hired Chris as her chef. Now, a wedding and a baby later, the couple continues working together to shift how the world perceives life on the autism spectrum. An example of this was Amy and Chris' pandemic cooking show titled that premiered in May 2020. Fans got a closer look into their marriage and what it was like quarantining with their baby Gene."
