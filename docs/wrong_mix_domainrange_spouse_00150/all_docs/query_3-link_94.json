        "text": "Emmerdale star Amy Walsh has married her long-term partner, former EastEnders actor Toby-Alexander Smith.\n\nFollowing three years of dating, the couple were married by the mountains of Montenegro, joined by family and famous friends – including singer Kimberly Walsh (who is Amy's sister), and EastEnders star Shona McGarty, who surprised the couple by performing a duet with singer Sonny Tennet.\n\nSeveral of Amy's Emmerdale co-stars were also in attendance, with Natalie Ann Jamieson, Olivia Bromley and Louisa Clein among those who watched the couple tie the knot.\n\n\"It was honestly the most perfect day,\" Amy said in an interview with OK! magazine. \"It surpassed all my expectations and more.\"\n\nRelated: Emmerdale's Amy Walsh reveals Tracy and Nate wedding fallout\n\nShe added: \"I felt so surprisingly present on the day and loved every second. Now I'm just in pure bliss.\"\n\nThe couple first met back in 2019, after a chance encounter in the audience of Strictly Come Dancing, before getting together a year later.\n\n\"It was just pure chance that we were both there [on Strictly] that night sat in the front row,\" Amy said of their first meeting during an episode of Loose Women. \"We were just chatting all night and really got on.\"\n\nToby and Amy welcomed their first child together, daughter Bonnie, in December 2021, before announcing their engagement almost a year later in August 2022.\n\nRelated: Emmerdale star Amy Walsh opens up over real-life parenting challenges\n\nAmy is best known for her role in the Dales, having played Tracey Metcalfe since 2014. She also appeared in Hollyoaks spinoff, Hollyoaks Later, in 2011.\n\nMost recently, she appeared on the 2023 series of Celebrity Masterchef, making it to the final three alongside Luca Bish, and Wynne Evans.\n\nToby appeared on EastEnders between 2019 and 2022, playing serial killer Gray Atkins.\n\nEmmerdale airs on weeknights at 7.30pm on ITV1, and streams on ITVX."
