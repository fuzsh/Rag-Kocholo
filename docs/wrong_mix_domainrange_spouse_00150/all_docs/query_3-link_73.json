        "text": "📸: Therese Iacono Photography // @thereseiaconophoto\n\nShe was his kids’ teacher, and eventually, he got an A+ in the relationship.\n\nThe Meet Cute: They met thirteen years ago, when she was his daughter’s first grade teacher. A few years later, yet another of Jim’s kids landed in her classroom as if it were fate. They met on Match.com after their marriages ended — she didn’t recognize him, but he remembered her. They went on a few dates and, initially, things didn’t click, but they kept in touch. In December 2018, they went out for dinner and “something changed that night,” Amy says.\n\nThe Engagement: After meeting and feeling sparks fly, they always knew they’d get engaged. “It was always ‘when,’ not ‘if,’” Amy says. He surprised her on Valentine’s Day. There was a bag on the counter with a bracelet box inside. She opened it to find a ring box inside. Thinking it was just a normal gift, she was in complete shock. “I looked at him and he asked, and I said, ‘Of course!’ It was an amazing moment, nothing fancy, just in our kitchen,” she says. “It was perfect.”\n\nThe Sound of (Family) Music: Jim’s son Jack plays in a band called Bissel Blues Company. Amy and Jim were joking around one afternoon and asked Jack if the band would play at the wedding. Jack said yes. They learned some new songs for the wedding, including “Lover” by Taylor Swift. (Amy and Jim’s daughter are both Swifties.) The band played the entire reception.\n\nThe Highlights: “The absolute highlight of our day was having a great party with our closest family and friends,” Amy says. “It is rare to find a great love in the second half of your life, and we feel so lucky. We wanted our day to be a celebration of love and joy, and it truly was!” Guests told the couple it was the most joyful wedding they’d ever attended. Having Amy’s sons PJ and Will walk her down the aisle was also incredibly special. “I knew if I ever married again I wanted them to be right there with me,” she says. “Walking down the aisle with the two young men I love most toward my Jim was the best moment of my life.”\n\nThe Details"
