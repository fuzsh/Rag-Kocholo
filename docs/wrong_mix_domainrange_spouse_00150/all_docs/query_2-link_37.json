        "text": "LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA: The 'Jeopardy!' spin-off, 'Jeopardy! Masters’, has taken viewers by storm as fans welcome the returning champion, Amy Schneider. Schneider has always made sure her presence was felt. From being a contestant with the most wins after the host, Ken Jennings, to becoming a trans icon, Schneider has done it all. Apart from having all this fame in her arsenal, she has also won in the love department.\n\nSchneider doesn’t shy away from showing off her wife, Genevieve Davis, from time to time, and of course, everyone wants to know more about the couple. From a sweet romance to revelations about one’s sexuality, this couple has had quite an interesting story.\n\nRELATED ARTICLES\n\n'Jeopardy! Masters' turns into WWE as James Holzhaeur hits Andrew He with custom-made Tournament of Champions belt\n\n'I don't want to offend': 'Jeopardy! Masters' host Ken Jennings SNUBS transgender contestant Amy Schneider\n\nWho is Genevieve Davis?\n\nDavis was born in 1996 and grew up in Oakland, California. Much like famous people, Davis also likes to keep her private life as private as possible and away from the limelight. However, when you’re married to a ‘Jeopardy!’ champion, fame and fans are bound to be curious. Sources revealed that Davis was a nanny and previously a summer camp counselor, but other details about her remain private. If anyone wants to learn more about Davis, it can only be done through Schneider’s Instagram and interviews, where she proudly talks about her wife from time to time. Schneider and Davis also have a 17-year age difference, which could be why Davis likes to keep her private affairs under wraps.\n\nHow did Genevieve Davis and Amy Schneider meet?\n\nSchneider and Davis had a meet-cute with a slow-burn romance. The couple met in 2020 at a small gathering in Schneider’s apartment. Los Angeles Times reported that Schneider’s friend was dating Davis’ brother back then, and she tagged along for the gathering and that’s when they met. Schneider is also known for her tarot card readings and offered one of those to Davis on that night.\n\nDespite the Covid-19 pandemic, Davis and Schneider managed to spend a lot of time together and did everything a normal couple would. Although, Davis was clearly in denial back then as she reportedly told Los Angeles Times, “People were confused. They were like, ‘Are you sure you’re not dating?’ I’m like, ‘No, I’m straight!’ obviously not.” By the looks of it, it took a little while for Davis to come around, but Schneider was knew what she wanted from the start.\n\nFast forward to more than a year later, and it was Davis who popped the question first, and a week later, Schneider asked for her hand in marriage. Their story feels straight out of a fairy tale. Finally, in the summer of 2022, Schneider took to Instagram announcing their wedding and letting her fans know that they had a small private ceremony on May 9 but will have a traditional wedding and reception next summer."
