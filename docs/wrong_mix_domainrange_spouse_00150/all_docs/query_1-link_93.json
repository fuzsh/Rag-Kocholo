        "text": "What’s your profession, and what does your day-to-day work experience look like now?\n\nI am a real estate agent with Jenna Cooper LA. Presently, I am working at home. Before quarantine I opened escrow on a condo we found for our client. We managed to close without delay and she is thrilled to be in her beautiful new home! I’m looking forward to taking some new clients to see some incredible properties in Beverly Hills (of course while wearing masks and social distancing). I am also helping some NY clients find a lease in Malibu, so they can hopefully get out of the cold and spend the remainder of quarantine in the sun!\n\nAre there objects or spaces in your house that you are newly appreciating? Or are there objects and spaces you have come to loathe?\n\nI am appreciating my backyard more than ever before! I feel so fortunate to live in sunny Los Angeles with a beautiful backyard and a pool. The kids come outside when they are done with online school every day and I feel like we are spending more time together than ever.\n\nDescribe your at-home quarantine uniform.\n\nMy quarantine uniform consists primarily of exercise clothes, backyard attire, and if I really feel like pulling it together, the occasional jumpsuit.\n\nWho are you quarantining with? Do you feel the need to “get away”? How do you make it happen?\n\nI am quarantining with my husband and our 3 kids, ages 16, 16, and 21. My older daughter was studying abroad in Spain when we rushed her home. You can imagine she was thrilled about that. I am honestly loving having all of my kids at home, but when I need a getaway, I go for a long hike or walk!\n\nWhat’s the last thing you purchased online? Regret or obsessed?\n\nI ordered a great jumpsuit ( for work and when I just feel like dressing up in quarantine) from my friend’s store Z life in NY. Next I want to order one from The Only Jane. I'm also obsessed with paint by numbers. We keep ordering them online and it has been so fun to do with my girls.\n\nTell us the best shows, podcasts, or books you’re loving right now.\n\nI am reading a lot right now and loving it. My favorite reads during quarantine so far are Inside Out, Demi Moore's autobiography, Wildgame by Adrienne Brodeur, and Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens. We are also watching The Last Dance! My husband is from Chicago and played basketball, and our son plays now, so we are all really into it.\n\nDo you have any new quarantine activities or rituals?\n\nThe backyard has turned into a new daily ritual. We are using the backyard in more ways than we ever imagined. It’s my office, school sometimes happens there, it’s the only restaurant we go to, and it’s a great place to read and sleep. We have also created a vacation at home. We try to have a daily exercise ritual, and we are definitely cooking every day. At night we do Paint By Numbers, play Scrabble, and watch movies. As far as self care rituals go, I was lucky enough to attend an event at Kelly Atterton’s store, Atterton, just before our “ stay at home” directive, and bought so many amazing clean beauty products. I am loving everything I bought.\n\nWhat is your favorite quarantine snack? What restaurants are you ordering takeout from?\n\nDoes my nightly Paloma count? :) We love making smoothies from the Smoothie Project cookbook by Catherine McCord from Weelicious. We’re trying to boost our immunity over here! We are ordering healthy prepared meals from One Potato Box by Catherine McCord as well. The prep work is done, so I can just enjoy cooking. Ordering from our friend Peter Garland who owns Porta Via is such a nice break from cooking and a great way to support local businesses.\n\nWhat is the one item you’re glad you stocked up on? What do you wish you’d stocked up on?\n\nWe stocked up on frozen fruit and veggies, which have been great for smoothies. I wish we would have stocked up on disinfectant wipes! I usually only use green products at home so trying to find Clorox at the last minute was impossible."
