        "text": "AMY Schneider has bravely opened up about contemplating \"suicide\" and her largely unknown first marriage while still male.\n\nThe 40-time Jeopardy! winner released unflinching experts of her tell-all memoir, which addresses her transition and fight to game show greatness.\n\nAmy, 42, shared no-holds-barred takeaways from her new book with the LA Times on Friday.\n\nHer tell-all, In the Form of a Question: The Joys and Rewards of a Curious Life, comes out Tuesday, October 3.\n\nAmy holds the game show's second-longest streak only behind now-host Ken Jennings (74 wins in 2004).\n\nAmy also made history as the first transgender tournament winner by clinching the $250,000 Tournament of Champions crown in 2022.\n\nThe trans trailblazer, perhaps Jeopardy!'s second-most (if not most) famous contestant, opted for the true definition of a tell-all- as just the excerpts shed light on her incredible journey.\n\n'STAYING ALIVE DIDN'T SEEM TEMPTING'\n\nHer book reflects on being born a boy in Ohio; she called being in the Boy Scouts a \"nightmare experience.\"\n\nAmy writes that the Boy Scouts made her realize: “I’m not a boy.”\n\nShe found it “disgusting and disturbing” and said she was pressured to watch a boy pull apart a live crawfish with a pocket knife.\n\nAmy also shared that watching the movie Romeo and Juliet with Leonardo DiCaprio made her realize she was not interested in men.\n\n\"It didn’t work,” she writes. “I simply didn’t like boys.”\n\nAhead of her senior year at the University of Dayton, she felt stuck: “While suicide held no appeal for me, staying alive didn’t seem that tempting, either.”\n\nShe said the cult animated show Daria helped her persevere.\n\n“If Daria could survive this Sick Sad World, so could I.\"\n\nAmy also opened up about meeting her first wife, Kelly, at age 21.\n\nAmy never discussed her first marriage on Jeopardy!.\n\nAmy had never been kissed then and had no sexual experience \"aside from spontaneous oral sex from a sex worker when she was 20,\" according to the pull quotes from the LA Times.\n\nThe couple got married and decided to be polyamorous.\n\n\"I think everybody should be poly,” Schneider writes.\n\n“Most people do not agree with that, and that’s okay.”\n\n'MAYBE I'LL TRY...'\n\nAmy started cross-dressing at home in private, hiding heels and other clothing from her then-wife.\n\n“It seemed clear to me this was not a part of my life she had any interest in sharing.”\n\nAmy's first marriage ended with Kelly leaving her for someone she was dating outside of marriage (it didn't last long).\n\nBut in 2016, when Kelly left, Amy had a breakthrough.\n\nShe journaled that day, as can be read in her book: “Maybe I’ll try being a pirate for a while. Or a writer, or a woman.”\n\nAmy transitioned soon after, ditching her “ugly, ill-fitting boy costume.”\n\n'LEARNING WAS MY FIRST DRUG'\n\nAmy also stands by trying various drugs, including \"cocaine, Vicodin, mushrooms and acid,\" and said they helped shape her.\n\nThey helped her see what it was like to have “a different brain for a while.”\n\nShe writes, “I have used, and continue to use, a wide variety of drugs. I believe that drugs have been good for me. Without them I might not be here today.”\n\nShe feels responsible for sharing her perspective since “the lived experience of actual drug users doesn’t get a lot of exposure.”\n\nThat said, trivia trumped all.\n\n“Learning was my first drug, my oldest form of self-medicating,\" she also writes.\n\nAmy said she's \"addicted to learning,\" which helped her overcome her obstacles and become the Jeopardy! great she is today.\n\nShe began trying out years before her transition and was worried about her deep voice, the outlet shared, and how it would play out on TV- though she won the nation over.\n\n“I realized that being trans in public carried responsibilities,” she writes. “To hide my voice began to feel like a betrayal to my community.”\n\nAMY STAYS WINNING\n\nThe engineering manager living in Oakland, California, is now married to Genevieve Davis, 25.\n\nWhen Amy won the 2022 TOC, Genevieve rushed the stage to embrace her.\n\nThey tied the knot in a small private ceremony on May 9, 2022 at a courthouse in California.\n\nAmy's $250,000 win and $75,000 from May's Jeopardy! Masters earned her $1.62million, the fifth-highest total winnings on Jeopardy! ever.\n\nGAME RECOGNIZE GAME\n\nAmy was recently asked on the Inside Jeopardy! podcast if there are any contestants she'd like to face in future tournaments.\n\nAmy shared: “I talked a lot with Hannah Wilson,\" who won eight games and $229,801 this May.\n\n\"And [I] was so happy to see her [on TV], and we just really connected well.\"\n\n\"Of all the people I’ve rooted on the most in the past year or two, she’s the one,\" Amy shared.\n\nHannah is the second-most-successful trans contestant next to Amy and will be in the currently postponed 2023 Tournament of Champions.\n\nHannah's winning streak scored attention from Amy as it was airing."
