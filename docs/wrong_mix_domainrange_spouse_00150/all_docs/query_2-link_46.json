She wrote about loving her husband, the life they had together, and how she hoped he would move forward. It immediately went viral and has been read by millions of people. It received emotional responses from countless major news outlets and people all over the world.\n\nJASON's ARTICLE\n\nJason B. Rosenthal, Amy's husband, wrote his own column a little over a year later. It addresses the end of Amy's life, his response to reading her article, the experience of grieving publicly, and how he is looking at life as he continues forward as a single dad."
