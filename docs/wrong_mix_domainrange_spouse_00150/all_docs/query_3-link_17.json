        "text": "Here’s one answer that Scheider didn’t need to give in the form of a question: I do!\n\nBeloved Jeopardy champion Amy Schneider shared on social media on Monday afternoon that she has gotten married to her now-wife Genevieve Davis. The two tied the knot in a small private ceremony back in May at the Alameda County Recorder in Oakland, California, according to Schneider’s own account.\n\n“Genevieve and I are delighted to announce that on Monday, May 9, we were married in a small private ceremony at the Alameda County Recorder,” the quiz queen wrote on Instagram. “We will still be having a traditional wedding & reception next summer, but our lives have been much too busy this year to get very far in planning it, and we couldn't wait that long to proclaim our love and commitment to each other. Thank you, everyone for your support!”\n\nThe two were engaged in February over a Zoom call, according to the Los Angeles Times. “I cannot imagine there ever being a moment for the rest of my life that I am not madly in love with you,” Davis said to Schneider at the time. “Will you please marry me?”\n\nBecause there is such a thing as stereotypical queerness, the two met in July 2020 during a party at Schneider’s apartment when Schneider gave Davis, who was a guest of Schneider’s friend’s brother, a tarot card reading and let her spend the night.\n\nThe 40-time Jeopardy! Champion is set to return to the game that made her an icon this fall as she competes on the show’s Tournament of Champions. The tournament begins October 31 but Schneider, alongside fellow multi-game champions Matt Amodio and Mattea Roach, have automatic passes to the semifinals. Schneider will also appear in a special tribute episode, set to air on November 8, in honor of former host Alex Trebek, who passed away two years ago on that date.\n\nAnd, as if this wasn’t enough to make 2022 something of a banner year for Schneider, Oakland also declared September 7 to be Amy Schneider Day."
