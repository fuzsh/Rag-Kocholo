        "text": "Dear Amy: After my spouse of over 40 years died last year. I have moved forward in my life in a positive manner.\n\nI am having a relationship with a married woman (“Brenda”). As a widower, I have found this to be very helpful.\n\nBrenda’s adult son and daughter have supported her in allowing this relationship to continue and grow.\n\nBrenda’s husband is clueless to everything going on.\n\nBrenda and I enjoy our time together and we have very long phone calls, and we have a very exciting sexual relationship.\n\nHer house is across the street, and she has her own bedroom separate from her husband. He is distant, withdrawn, and very unsociable.\n\nBrenda doesn’t want to leave her house and move in with me because her daughter and granddaughter are also living in the home with her.\n\nAt what point should Brenda’s husband be clued into this development, and what approach should we take to “clear the air” at some point?\n\n– Archie\n\nDear Archie: I appreciate the fact that you believe you are moving onward “in a positive manner” after your loss, but I would ask you to reconsider the meaning of the word “positive,” and at least acknowledge the possible negative consequences your and “Brenda’s” behavior might have on others.\n\nYou don’t offer any real clues about Brenda’s husband’s status, and I wonder if you and Brenda could consider what course of action will be the least destabilizing for him. He might be withdrawn and unsociable, but he is the innocent party here, and his life might be turned upside down if he and Brenda split.\n\nUsing the modern vernacular, Brenda might propose that they “open up” their marriage. This is often suggested by a spouse who is already having an affair, but wants to stay married. Might he also want to step out, or would he prefer to maintain a “don’t ask, don’t tell” sort of arrangement, where he and his wife basically live separate lives under the same roof?\n\nA divorce might take an extreme toll financially, affecting the entire household, but he should be presented with the truth, because he has the right to make some informed choices about his own life.\n\nThe coziest course might be for Brenda to move across the street to cohabit with you, allowing her husband to stay in his home, but so far she doesn’t seem to want to make any substantial changes in order to be with you.\n\nStories by Amy Dickinson\n\nAsk Amy: The last column, with lasting widsom\n\nAsk Amy: Football conflicts, ‘Just a Gigolo’ and other wedding mishaps\n\nAsk Amy: Girlfriend laughed at his courtesy\n\nAsk Amy: How should I prepare to bring Black person into my white neighborhood?\n\nAsk Amy: An update from a reader who wanted to help someone\n\nRead more Ask Amy and other advice columns."
