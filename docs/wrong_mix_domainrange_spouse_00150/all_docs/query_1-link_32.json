We both see marriage as an active and evolving bond between us.\"\n\nAshton – who, at 33, is 15 years younger than Demi - credits his successful marriage to communicating honestly and surprising his wife whenever he can.\n\nHe added in an interview with Britain's OK! magazine: \"You have to be very serious about communicating your feelings and just expressing yourself and being open to your partner.\n\n\"Demi and I both believe in that kind of philosophy. We also like being romantic and doing special little things for each other, whether it's coming up with a wild new meal for dinner or suggesting a trip somewhere.\n\n\"You don't want to just sit around and get into some routine where you don't even realise that you've fallen into that kind of thing.\""
