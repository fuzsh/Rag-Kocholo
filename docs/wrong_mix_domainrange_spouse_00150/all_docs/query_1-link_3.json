        "text": "The 49-year-old actress, born Demetria Guynes in New Mexico, adopted her now-famous last name from her first husband, Freddy Moore, whom she married in 1980, when she was just 18 years old. The couple divorced four years later, when Demi began dating \"St. Elmo's Fire\" co-star Emilio Estevez. Moore and Estevez enjoyed a much-publicized relationship and even an engagement until 1987, when she began seeing actor Bruce Willis, with whom she would eventually have three children (Rumer, Scout and Tallulah). That couple stayed together for 13 years, until divorcing -- but remaining publicly amicable -- in 2000. Directly thereafter (or, according to some reports, as early as 1999), Demi started dating martial arts instructor Oliver Whitcomb, who was seven years her junior. That lasted for four years... which brings us to her most recent relationship. In 2003, Demi fell hard for actor Ashton Kutcher and married him in September 2005, in a ceremony that included her daughters and ex-husband Bruce."
