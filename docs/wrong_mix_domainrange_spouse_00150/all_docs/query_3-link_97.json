        "text": "Amy Winehouse and Blake Fielder-Civil were married between 2007 and 2009\n\nAmy Winehouse was married to Blake Fielder-Civil, a relationship that's heavily explored in the recently-released biopic Back to Black.\n\nThe late musician wed Fielder-Civil in 2007. Their brief marriage was passionate but tumultuous relationship, and notoriously served as inspiration for Winehouse's smash hit debut album, Back to Black, released in 2006. The couple battled drug and alcohol addiction, which ultimately led to Winehouse's death at age 27 in July 2011.\n\nIn the biopic, Jack O'Connell stars as Fielder-Civil, and reached out to him to help prepare to play the part. Fielder-Civil told Good Morning Britain in April that he had seen the film, admitting \"there were some difficult parts to process,\" but said watching it was \"therapeutic in a way.\"\n\nRelated: Amy Winehouse's Ex-Husband Is 'Very Misunderstood,' Says Back to Black Star Jack O'Connell (Exclusive)\n\n“There were some parts of it that enabled me to feel like I was seeing a more accurate representation of the relationship — not in a sense of being let off the hook or whitewashed, just in a sense that it wasn’t all about addiction,\" he said of their love story. \"There was addiction, but it was only an aspect.\"\n\nO'Connell spoke with PEOPLE at the New York City premiere of Back to Black, discussing his portrayal of Fielder-Civil and sharing his thoughts on his reputation since Winehouse's death. \"I think he got a terrible, both of them got a terrible time with the tabloid press,\" O'Connell said on the red carpet in May 2024.\n\n\"I think he's definitely very misunderstood and very far removed from the person that I met,\" continued O'Connell. \"It was important for me to do some justice to that.\"\n\nBack to Black hit theaters on May 17. Read on to learn more about Amy Winehouse's ex-husband Blake Fielder-Civil and where he is today.\n\nWhen did Amy and Blake get married?\n\nWinehouse and Fielder-Civil met at a London pub in 2005 a few years after the musician released her debut album Frank in 2003. At the time, he worked in video production and she hadn't yet reached the global fame that came with the 2006 release of Back to Black.\n\nIn a 2016 interview with Complex, Fielder-Civil recalled being apprehensive upon hearing Winehouse say she was going to sing him a song upon first meeting. “I really fancied her and I didn’t want to have pretend I liked it,” he told the outlet. As she sang the first note covering “Round Midnight,\" he said, “I think I, at that moment, fell in love with her.”\n\nThe couple dated on and off in the years that followed, a period of their bumpy relationship that inspired much of Winehouse's music, in particular the title track on Back to Black.\n\n“All the songs are about the state of my relationship at the time with Blake,” the singer told Rolling Stone in 2007. “I had never felt the way I feel about him about anyone in my life. It was very cathartic, because I felt terrible about the way we treated each other.”\n\nThe got engaged in April 2007 and wed in Florida a month later in front of a Miami clerk. \"I don’t want to say we did it on a whim, because that makes it sound whimsical,” Fielder-Civil told the outlet.\n\nRelated: See the Amy Winehouse Biopic Back to Black Cast Side by Side with Real People\n\nWhy did Amy and Blake divorce?\n\nAt the time of Back to Black's release in 2007, Amy began showing signs of drug and alcohol addiction. Many believed Fielder-Civil was responsible for introducing her to the drugs and enabling the addictions that ultimately led to her death at age 27 in July 2011.\n\nTheir marriage was tumultuous and short lived, ending in 2009; she died two years later. In a 2018 interview with Good Morning Britain, Fielder-Civil said that the narrative surrounding his and Winehouse's drug use was skewed.\n\n“The drug thing is something that’s been attributed to me for years. The fact is that me and Amy only used drugs together maybe six months of our marriage. That was it. And before that, Amy didn’t use drugs. She smoked cannabis, [and] I did heroin maybe four or five times,\" he told the outlet.\n\nFielder-Civil added, \"People don’t realize Amy didn’t do anything Amy didn’t want to do ... [but] I’ll always carry a burden of guilt because I should have acted.”\n\nDid Blake attend Amy's funeral?\n\nWinehouse died of alcohol toxicity on July 23, 2011, at age 27. Friends and family of the singer gathered in London for her funeral on July 26, 2011.\n\nFielder-Civil spent time in jail for various reasons, including drug possession. Although he was clean for a brief period, he began using again in 2011 and was arrested in June that year. He was not in attendance at Winehouse's funeral, though according to Complex, \"was allowed the dignity of a small ceremony in the prison chapel.\"\n\nDespite not being at the funeral, Fielder-Civil has spoken out about Winehouse's passing since. In an interview with Good Morning Britain on what would have been the late singer's 40th birthday in September 2023, he discussed his time with the late singer and the idea that people still consider him \"responsible\" for her death.\n\n\"I can’t change how other people feel about that,\" he said about the latter. “But for me personally, I’ve needed to stop carrying that cross on my own. I’ve carried that burden myself for over 10 years. I feel, to be honest, that I’m the only person within that story that’s ever held any accountability, that’s ever tried to say, ‘Yep, I made some huge mistakes.’”\n\nHe explained how he saw the situation at the time: \"I was a 20-something-year-old drug addict. So I had absolutely no idea how to make myself clean, let alone somebody else who was a big cog in a machine for a record label, and there were vested interests in Amy carrying on performing.\"\n\nRelated: Back to Black Review: Newcomer Marisa Abela Gives Powerful, Breakthrough Performance as Amy Winehouse\n\nWho is Blake married to now?\n\nIt is unclear who Fielder-Civil is in a relationship with today. He is a father, though, of two children — a son named Jack and a daughter named Lola — who he welcomed with ex-partner Sarah Aspin in May 2011 and April 2013, respectively.\n\nWhat is Blake doing now?\n\nFielder-Civil made a recent appearance on Good Morning Britain in April 2024 to discuss the new Winehouse biopic. During his conversation with the hosts, he opened up about his thoughts past relationship with the late musician and shared updates on his own life today.\n\n\"I've been clean for years myself,\" he first revealed after being asked about his own addiction battle. \"It's not as black and white as that. I was a very young person I thought I had the answers. ... If I would have known how it was going to develop, I would have been far more careful.\"\n\nFielder-Civil also expressed his desire to speak with Winehouse's loved ones, especially her father Mitch Winehouse, to clear the air. \"We don't need to be best friends but I wouldn't mind having a conversation,\" he said.\n\n\"As sad as it may be, Mitch is a father, I'm a father. I understand his position on me, I really do,\" he continued. \"But I hope that he would see that there was genuinely love there.\"\n\nWas Blake involved in the Amy biopic?\n\nFielder-Civil doesn't appear in Back to Black himself, though Jack O'Connell portrays him in the biopic. The actor told PEOPLE at the N.Y.C. premiere of the film in May 2024 that he connected with Fielder-Civil while preparing for the role.\n\n\"I think he's just very honest about his fallibility and I think that's his strength,\" O'Connell told PEOPLE. \"But anytime he spoke about Amy, he just lit up, started glowing, and that told me that whatever was happening between them was very genuine. So that was wildly informative.\"\n\nO'Connell added that Fielder-Civil was \"very open\" and \"very available\" to help the actor nail his portrayal. \"He was constantly ready to chat and talk more throughout the whole shooting process,\" the actor told PEOPLE, adding that he gave him \"a playlist of tunes\" to listen to, so that he could get into the couple's mindset.\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
