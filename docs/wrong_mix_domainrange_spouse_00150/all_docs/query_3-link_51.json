        "text": "Amy Robach and T.J. Holmes are thinking about their future.\n\nThe former \"GMA3\" coanchors were let go from the ABC morning show after their relationship (while they both were still married to other people) went public last year. The couple recently debuted a new podcast, \"Amy & T.J. Podcast,\" in which they've opened up about their relationship and the fallout from the scandal. And on Tuesday's episode, they talked about just how serious their relationship has become.\n\nWhile answering questions from listeners, Robach addressed the query \"are you guys going to tie the knot?\"\n\n“It’s under consideration,” said Robach, 50. “We did not enter this relationship for fun or for ‘Let's see what happens.’ We entered this relationship because we intended on spending our lives together. So whether or not we have some sort of legal, you know, I don't know, button on it.”\n\nBut if they get married, it won't be very soon.\n\n“We both have two marriages under our belts and so it's not something we're racing to or rushing towards,” she added. “But there is something, I get it, it's this thing that I can't even explain why there's this desire, but I want to spend the rest of my life with you, I can say that. It's on the table. It's on the table.”\n\nHolmes, 46, joked that there will be a “tiny box” under the Christmas tree, and said that the couple's ages played a factor in his desire for marriage.\n\n“I want to marry you, in part, because you're 50 and I'm 46. And I'm very sick of introducing a 50-year-old woman as my girlfriend. That just sounds stupid,” he said.\n\n“Thank you for noting the age difference,” said Robach.\n\nAmy Robach, T.J. Holmes relationship timeline, 'GMA3' fallout\n\nThe romance between Holmes and Robach made headlines last December when the Daily Mail published video and photographs of the two married anchors holding hands and Holmes patting Robach on the bottom.\n\nABC sidelined Robach and Holmes from the afternoon news program soon after, calling the allegations a \"distraction.\" In January, the former co-anchors were officially ousted. In May, Holmes and Robach's replacements were named.\n\nLast December, Holmes filed a petition for divorce from ex-wife Marilee Fiebig, 46, an immigration attorney, in New York City after 13 years of marriage, according to court records obtained by USA TODAY. Holmes and Fiebig reached a divorce settlement in October, as reported by Us Weekly and the Los Angeles Times.\n\nFiebig later spoke out through her attorney, Stephanie Lehman, saying she was \"disappointed by T.J.'s lack of discretion, respect and sensitivity toward Marilee and the parties' daughter.\" Holmes and Fiebig married in March 2010 and share a 10-year-old daughter. Holmes also has two children from a previous marriage to Amy Ferson.\n\nRobach wed \"Melrose Place\" star Andrew Shue in 2010. They listed their New York City apartment for sale last September.\n\nContributing: Naledi Ushe, Taijuan Moorman"
