        "text": "Trailblazing Jeopardy! contestant Amy Schneider has announced that she married girlfriend Genevieve Davis in a “small private ceremony” in May this year.\n\nThe 43-year-old champ, who became the first woman to ever surpass $1 million in earnings on the quiz show, said she and Davis had married at a court house in California, and will be having a larger celebration next summer.\n\nShe previously shared that Davis popped the question in February while the couple were hosting a “happy hour” at their home with friends.\n\nPosting on Instagram, Schneider said: “Genevieve and I are delighted to announce that on Monday, May 9, we were married in a small private ceremony at the Alameda County Recorder.\n\n“We will still be having a traditional wedding and reception next summer, but our lives have been much too busy this year to get very far in planning it, and we couldn’t wait that long to proclaim our love and commitment to each other.”\n\nShe added on Twitter: “The year since [she appeared on Jeopardy!] has been full of good days… Without her, none of the other good days would have happened.”\n\nDuring her 40-game win streak between November 2021 and January 2022, Schneider not only became the most successful female contestant in the show’s history and the first trans contestant to qualify for the Jeopardy! Tournament of Champions, but she also took home almost $1.4 million in winnings.\n\nJeopardy! bosses recently teased a special US Election Day episode in November, with fans hoping that this means a return to the show for Schneider.\n\nThe Tournament of Champions and a regular Jeopardy! series were confirmed to air from 31 October and 12 September respectively, but eagle-eyed fans noticed that on 8 November – the day of the US mid-term elections – there’s currently nothing scheduled.\n\nOn the Inside Jeopardy! podcast, executive producer Mike Davies said: “I don’t wanna give too much away but we are planning something really tremendous.\n\n“We owe [Trebek] a fantastic episode of Jeopardy! on that day.”\n\nCo-host and producer Sarah Foss agreed: “And it will be airing on 8 November. So certainly we will also be paying tribute since it is the second anniversary of when we lost Alex Trebek.”\n\nAlex Trebek hosted Jeopardy for 36 years, and passed away in 2020 at the age of 80."
