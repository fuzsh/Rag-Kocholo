        "text": "Amy Fleming is the main protagonist of Heartland. She is Lou Fleming's sister, youngest daughter of Tim Fleming and Marion Fleming, grand-daughter of Jack and Lyndy Bartlett, mother to Lyndy, and the half-sister of Shane Grenier. She was married to Ty Borden up until his death.\n\nIn the pilot, Amy was devastated by the death of her mother, Marion, who was killed in a car accident while trying to rescue Spartan. The devastation was increased due to the fact that Amy couldn't attend the funeral as a result of injuries incurred in the accident. Amy eventually realizes that she has the same gift of helping horses that her mother had.\n\nHistory\n\nSeason 1\n\nWe first see Amy helping Marion (her mother) rescue an abused horse (Spartan) from Mr. Mallen in the middle of a storm. On the way home the car drives off the road and crashes. Due to her injuries Amy's unable to attend Marion's funeral. Some time has past and Amy is still in hospital, she comes around with Jack and Lou with her. She asks where her mum is and Jack has to tell her that she was killed. Once she arrives back home she asks what happened to the horse. Amy's online messaging Soraya when she overhears Jack and Scott bringing Spartan into the round pen, she goes out and tells Jack he shouldn't have brought him here. Amy goes out for a trail ride with a friend, Jen, when Ty screeches close by in his car. She chases him down to berate him for driving that way around horses. He tells her that he's there because Marion hired him. Amy talks to Jack about the night she saw Spartan, that she saw a storm coming and it was getting late so cut through Mallen's farm and Spartan called to her. She blames herself for her mother's death since she went to get Marion to help her rescue Spartan. Amy later returns to school and has to face Ashley and Jesse for the first time. Amy gets upset when Lou suggests the idea of selling off land to help with re-payments. She starts working with Spartan, trying join up to get him to trust her. This acts as therapy for Amy as she starts to work through her issues of guilt, then Spartan joins up. At a party at Briar Ridge Jesse gifts her a mobile phone. He soon starts to drink and show off when Ty arrives. Ty defends her and punches him and Amy leaves and starts walking home. Ty picks her up on the way back and they start to bond. The next morning she's able to work more with Spartan and rides him out to the cemetery to visit Marion's grave. (Coming Home) Lou asks Amy about the progress of one of her client horses Swallow, when Amy says he's fine Lou takes this to mean he's ready to go so calls the owner to have him picked up. When out on a trail ride with Soraya, she suggests Amy get back to show jumping if anything it will annoy Ashley. When Ty is having a hard day and struggling to get everything done, Amy is short with him but quickly apologizes until she realizes Swallow has gone. She goes to have a go at Lou for the misunderstanding and tells her he wasn't ready to go. When Mrs Roche returns to Heartland to tell her that Briar Ridge will be working with Swallow now, Amy gets more infuriated with Lou. She becomes more irritated by Lou when she tries to take over running the business, she has some teething issues causing friction between the pair. When working in the barn she and Ty start chatting about show jumping and she reveals that she's worried about doing it without her Mom. Ty convinces her to give it a try with Spartan. When trying to trailer Spartan he begins to buck and act out of the idea of being in the trailer again. She starts working with him but is disappointed that they won't be able to train for the jumping show. Lou reaches out and they both apologize to each other for the miscommunication. However, when Lou inadvertently makes Amy think she doesn't believe in her, she gets upset all over again. Ty takes her out to the new jumping course he built and loves it. Amy later has a nightmare about herself being trapped in the trailer, she gets an idea of how to help Spartan, so goes to Ty for help. They move the trailer between the barn and the paddock so that he has to use it as a bridge to get to his favorite place. Her and Lou finally make up and forgive each other. (After the Storm)\n\nAmy finds Pegasus late at night, he doesn't look very well so calls Scott over to check him out. She looks after him and believes he's just depressed. When Scott comes by in the morning he tells her that Nick passed her name on to Lisa Stillman at Fairfield Stables who has a horse she wants Amy to look at. Amy starts working with Promise and brings out her old owner Brian who tells her that he only rode bareback and since he's blind she was like his seeing-eye horse, it was like he had to ask permission to ride her. Amy then slowly gains Promise's trust and is able to gently upgrade her to a saddle. She rides her as an example at the open house until Val suggests the horse is drugged and Amy is a fraud. Lisa sticks up for her so Val propositions Amy into fixing her $100,000 jumping horse that refuses to jump. She reluctantly agrees and quickly works out that he's not scared of the jump it's the people stood around because of Val's training methods. Once everyone moves away she's able to jump him. Lou and Amy finally compliment each other on their work. When Ty approaches she asks him why he went on the motorcycle ride with Ashley if he doesn't like her, but he tells her it was his favorite bike so of course he would ride it. (Breaking Free) Amy and Lou are trying to put off sorting out Marion's room. They admit to each other and themselves that they need to get it done. They start sorting through her things and find some pictures of them, a buckle from Tim's last stampede and a letter from Tim to Marion asking for forgiveness and to come back home. She later talks to Jack about Ben's lack of work ethic and about Tim's letter. Ty talks to Amy about Ben as he's not happy with how he treats his horse and wants her to intervene. When Ashley arrives and tells Ty he should get a job at Briar Ridge as it'll pay better than Heartland, Amy accidentally lets slip about his probation which upsets Ty. Amy convinces Ben to go on a trail ride with her, she sees that Red is scared of water and doesn't like how Ben treats him. She marches to Lou to tell her to get rid of Ben as she's not happy with how he treats his horse and he doesn't do any work, she also admits that Ty might leave for Briar Ridge if he doesn't leave. When Ben is bucked off of Red Mallory goes to get Amy to help and they realize Red is missing. They go looking for him and finds Red by the creek, when trying to cross he spooks and pulls Amy off her horse knocking her unconscious. She is taken to the hospital, when she arrives back she asks Lou how Spartan got home and she tells her that Tim brought him back as he's working at Big River now. Amy's upset with Lou for keeping secrets from her, this leads to Jack telling them about how, after Tim's accident, he started taking pills and drinking so Jack told him to leave in the hope that he would get clean and come home but never did. She later talks with Jack about keeping the secret from her as she's no longer a child and they make up. (Taking Chances)\n\nAmy and Lou go to Maggie's and she gets jealous when she sees Ty sitting with Ashley. She watches the new Briar Ridge commercial play which causes Lou to become inspired to film their own video. Amy tells Soraya that she's going to stay out of it because she knows how Lou can get. Scott brings her a horse to work with, a wild horse abandoned by his herd that needs gentling. He tells Amy that she can give him a name.

After Ty goes out and Jack goes to the Fishing Cabin, Amy and Lisa both sit complaining about their men and come to the same conclusion - their stubborn. Lisa tries to convince Amy to still go to the formal, she gives her a dress she bought her for her birthday. The next day, Amy finds Ty and tells him she hoped to see him last night but he tells her he went to bed early as he's excited for the dance. Caleb comes down from the Loft and asks where Ty was last night as he didn't get in until 2am waking him up. Amy leaves upset that he lied to her telling him not to come to the dance. Amy is surprised to see Ty ready and dressed for the dance and they leave together, but not before Lou manages to get some pictures of them both first. Amy's annoyed when Ty's Truck breaks down believing he willed it to happen as he didn't want to go. He admits he didn't want to go but not because he didn't want to be with her, he lifts her into the back of the truck and they dance. He gifts her a promise ring and they dance happily in Ty's truck.\n\n(Man's Best Friend) Amy and Mallory go to The Hanley Place, Mallory's spooked after hearing the ghost stories and tries to persuade Amy not to go in. Amy tells her she doesn't believe the stories and goes in anyway, unknown to her she's being watched. In the barn Amy calls out to Mr. Hanley he eerily appears from nowhere, and tells her he's glad she came. He explains that there's a problem with the horses, they're getting spooked at night and nearly break down the stalls banging their hooves. When Amy agrees to help Hanley disappears, she shouts to him that she'll come back tomorrow, she goes looking in a stall and is scared when Mallory jumps out demanding to leave. At Maggie's, Ashley tells everyone that she heard Mr. Hanley went crazy murdered his wife and her body is stored upstairs, Amy defends him and tells them that he's eccentric but isn't a murderer. Ty asks who Mr. Hanley is, Amy, Mallory, Soraya and Ashley tell him the ghost story of The Hanley Place. When it was owned before Hanley's father bought he farm, the farmer's daughter was dating the stable hand and didn't approve, he burned down the barn and all the horses and the stable hand died. When the Hanley's took over they re-built the barn on the exact spot the old one stood, and it's now haunted by the stable hand, he wears a long black coat and when his hood is removed his face is burned off. A hooded figure enters the Diner and they all watch in fear as Caleb removes his hood and tells them about the bad weather blowing in. Amy's at Hanley's and hears some noises in the barn, she tries to convince herself its a squirrel. She later, tries to bring a horse into the barn but refusing to go in, she overhears Brent arguing with Mr. Hanley trying to get him out of the farm. After Brent leaves Mr. Hanley asks Amy how it's going and she suggests it's the food which he knows it's not after going through that with a vet. He suggests she needs to see them at night to get a better idea of what's going on and tells her the loft is off limits. Amy asks Jack about working at Hanley's place, he's not keen on her going along and when she says Ty can go with her he's even more unsure. She tells him that she's been hired for a job and she needs to go so she can do the job, he agrees. Lou is shocked that Jack's letting her go to a haunted barn with her delinquent stable hand/boyfriend overnight but when she even brings up Peter Jack basically reaches for his shotgun. Mrs. Bell tells them that her father didn't approve of her first boyfriend, when she gave him a jar of her jam he returned it empty with a butterfly inside. Later, Mallory runs into the house and tells Amy that she can't go to the Hanley Barn because the fire was real, Amy tells her that she's heard the stories and doesn't believe it. They ask Mrs. bell if she believes it's haunted and she tells them that places aren't haunted but the people inside. Amy and Ty go to Maggie's to buy torches for going to Hanley's, Soraya and Caleb are surprised that they're spending the night there since Mr. Hanley seems crazy. Amy and Ty are happy spending time together at Hanley's when they hear a noise they go towards the door to check it out when Caleb jumps out with an axe to scare them, he and Soraya are in stitches while Amy and Ty berate them for scaring them. They suddenly stop when they turn and see a hooded figure walking towards them, unsure what to do the figure walks slowly towards them branding a hook. Caleb protects them clutching onto his axe when Ashley reveals herself pulling her hood down laughing at them all. Amy tells them all to leave because if Mr. Hanley sees them she'll be fired, they head out. A few hours later, Amy starts to think maybe Mr. Hanley is crazy because nothing seems wrong with the horses. The lights suddenly go out and Ty goes to check the breaker box while Amy looks around outside. She finds some graves nearby and stands reading the headstones when Ty spots a hooded figure approaching her, he tries to shout to warn her but she doesn't hear him. When he rushes out she shows him the graves of the horses and stable hand that died, with no sign of the hooded figure. Amy starts to believe the story and they head back into the barn as the storm starts to get worse. In the barn, Ty asks Amy if she's ok and she tells him she feels silly for letting the place get to her. They hear a creaking in the loft and go up to check it out. They search around and see there's something behind a sheet they pull it off to reveal... Mallory, they ask why she's there and she glances to something else. Ty slowly walks towards it when Badger jumps out and starts running off. Ty manages to catch him and orders Mallory and badger to get in the car when another figure appears, Mr. Hanley pulls down his hood demanding to know what's going on. Amy apologises and tells him it's her friends, he tells them he saw their lights in the loft and told them not to go up there, there's dry rot and isn't safe. After he leaves they see something in the hay, as Ty walks towards it Brent jumps out and the pair fight. The lights come back on and Amy finds a tub of glycogen loader, a sugar bomb used to energise racehorses, she realises this is what's causing the horses to get worked up as he wants to push Mr. Hanley out. The next day, Amy talks to Mr. Hanley and tells him that she's going to put his information on their website to help him because he cares about horses when she spots Mrs. Bell. Mr. Hanley tells her that she comes by every year as her family used to own the farm she must come to see a loved one. When she places a butterfly in a jar on the grave she realises she's the farmer's daughter from the story.

She tells him that from what she saw he also wasn't pulling his weight which doesn't go down well. Amy helps Caleb with Shorty after practice, when Ty calls to tell her about Kit's foal. She tells Caleb that the foal died and he tries to reassure her that she has nothing to worry about with Ty and Kit. Amy offers to help Caleb practice bulldogging, he accepts.

She suggests he get some help with the cows and offers to help, he thanks her but tells her she's too busy to help him as she receives a call from Ty to help with Kit's mare and orphaned foal.

They take him into the barn and Scott tells Ty about a job at the racetrack for a stable hand a few mornings, giving him something to think about. Amy and Ty agree to take shifts feeding Merlin, Amy goes into the barn through the night and sees Ty still sitting there, he tells her that he wouldn't go back to sleep. The next morning, the pair are saying how they feel fine when Jack tells them about the Cougar being reported and they need to bring the animals in at night. Ty begins to worry about Merlin but Amy tells him he'll be fine. When Amy finds Ty with Merlin again she begins to get annoyed, she tells him that since he's with him he can start getting him used to a halter but he isn't keen as he's only a baby. At night Amy convinces Ty to leave Merlin until he hears him \"cry\" and turns on his heels sitting with him, much to Amy's annoyance. She wakes early and heads to the barn when she finds feathers surrounding the chicken coop. Jack checks and thinks the cougar got it and finds a whole in the fence where she got out, all comforting Mallory. Later, Amy and Ty try to teach Merlin to drink from a bucket when Caleb arrives, they continue arguing with differing strategies so Caleb leaves them to it to collect more of his things from the loft. At night, Amy's in the barn when the cougar appears in the doorway growling, she calls up to Ty, who runs down, grabs a pitchfork and manages to scare it off. Ty tells her that he'll do the rest of the nights feeds since he's already there and will make sure the doors shut, she then thinks he's blaming her for leaving the doors open. He stops her from walking away and assures her he doesn't blame her they're both just tired and she forgot. The next morning, Mallory tells Amy and Ty that they can have a break and will watch Merlin, Amy goes to get Spartan ready for a ride but Ty wants to stay. Mallory tells him that in the parenting book it says they need to find time to be together or the relationship suffers, he changes his mind and joins Amy on her ride. Ty wants to call Mallory to check on Merlin but Amy convinces him not to. She tells him that when she was younger Marion and Tim would go out and would miss her and Lou loads. He tells her that his upbringing was slightly different and he promised himself that when he had kids they would get nothing but love from him, she tells him that he can love them but needs to set boundaries too. She talks about how when she was younger she would throw a tantrum and get 5 minutes in the no-no chair, they both laugh. As they turn back the cougar appears again ready to attack Amy when they hear a gunshot. The wildlife warden assures them it was only a tranquilliser and they'll take it to a wildlife reserve a few miles away.

Amy answers the phone to Richard Chenoweth for Lou, she tells her to say she's not there, she then follows Lou to her bedroom.

The next day they say goodbye to Merlin and \"Tuffy\". (Growing Pains)\n\nAmy is at the racetrack with Lisa watching Lightning Dexter, she tells her how he won't start and asks for her help but Amy tells her she's too busy. Amy and Ty arrive home to see Lily waiting there. Lou asks Amy about Lily but she tells her he doesn't really talk about her but it's been years since they last saw each other. Amy's working with Kabuki when Lily and Ty see her, Lily tries to make an effort with Amy but she gives her the cold shoulder. Once Lily goes to see the other horse Amy takes the chance to ask Ty why she's here, he tells her that she left Wade and has a new job. At dinner Amy continues to snub Lily and asks where she'll be staying, Jack jumps in and offers her a cabin at the Dude Ranch. After dinner, Amy and Lily wash up, Lily tells her about taking Ty to lots of zoos when he was younger, not surprised he likes the animals but is put out when Amy says he's never mentioned it. The next day Tim takes Dexter to Heartland telling her that he bought him and wants Amy to fix him. She tells him that she can't as she already told Lisa she couldn't and has client horses. He tells her the client horses come first and she can work with Dexter in between. She relents and agrees. Amy and Tim work with Dexter and are pleasantly surprised when he goes into a gate, set up like a starting gate, with no issues. Tim pushes them for them to keep working but Amy tells him she needs to work with Kabuki. The next day, they take Dexter to the racetrack, being watched by Lisa and her jockey Liam, when her phone vibrates Dexter spooks when she notices Lisa and runs after her. Amy tries to apologise but Lisa tells her that she expects this from Tim but not her, and eaves hurt. That evening She and Ty are talking about Lily and he's trying to convince himself to give her a chance while Amy tells him she can just see all the hurt she's caused him. She goes on to tell him that she's upset and thinks Lisa hates her. Amy's working with Kabuki, when Jack comes over and talks to her about Lisa. He puts all the blame on Tim for putting Amy in this position, she admits she should have said no and that she hasn't been handling anything well lately. Amy heads over to the track to see Lisa but she's not there, only her jockey Liam. Amy asks if he noticed anything and tells him about Dexter getting spooked at her phone vibrating when he tells her he would never have his phone on him when riding. Later, Amy's reading her mum's journals when Ty comes in, she says that she went to see Lisa and re-tells the story of talking with Liam. Ty tells her he's a jerk as the other day he got him with a buzzer when he shook his hand. This gives Amy food for thought and believes he was shocking Dexter at the gate, which is illegal. They head to the Fairfield trailer at the track and when they find it empty start looking around. Only to be caught by Liam. Lisa arrives and asks what they're doing, Amy explains about the theory of Liam buzzing Dexter but since she has no proof Lisa doesn't believe her. Jack isn't happy about what Amy did and talks to her, she reasons with him pointing out all the evidence that Dexter has shown them, Jack thinks on it. While Tim is adamant on doing more work Amy tells him that she shouldn't have agreed to help as she has not time and she already told Lisa no. While Tim tries to tell her she should have told him no, he starts asking about Dexter, annoying Amy. Amy's working with Dexter when Lily comes over, Amy asks for her help and has tied her phone to Dexter. She asks Lily to text her something and gives Dexter a treat when it buzzes to start to associate it as positive not negative. Lily heads off and Amy looks at the text reading \"Give me a chance\". Amy's at the racetrack with Dexter when she runs into Lisa, they both try and apologise and Lisa reveals that they found the buzzers in Liam's locker, they hug. Amy gets Dexter into the starting gate and races him around the track with a great time. (The Starting Gate)\n\nAmy, Lou and Jack arrive home to nearly be run off the road by Wade screeching past them. Mallory fills them in on the confrontation between Ty and Wade and rushes off to check on him. When she goes up to the loft she hears Ty and Lily shouting and is dismissed by Ty, so storms out. Amy angrily brushes Spartan when Lily leaves and Ty comes to talk to her. He tells her about having a tree fort in Vancouver he would take his Mum to protect her. He tells her that he's leaving with her now to take her back to Vancouver. Amy tells Jack and he goes to talk to him. The next morning, Ty goes in to see Amy, who's barely awake. She reassures him that they'll look out for his Mum while he's at work. As Ty tries to sneak a kiss, they hear cars honking after Jack locked the gate. She and Ty head out and she greets Clay and Cody Dawson. Clay tells her that Cody's roping horse, Allegro is slow out of the box and they need him ready for the rodeo this weekend. After Clay heads back to the car, Cody tells her it doesn't have to be this weekend, they'll be others. When Amy starts working with Allegro, Caleb notices him as Cody's horse. He tells Amy that the Dawson brothers were beating him a lot but after Cody's brother Travis got in a wreck he started winning and Cody got slower. Later, Amy hears music playing outside and is pleased to see Cody playing the piano really well. He helps Amy and Caleb with Allegro, but claims Allegro's jumpy because of the quad. When he fails to rope the mechanical steer he says it's because of Allegro being spooked. When Cody's untacking Allegro, Amy asks about his brother's accident. He tells her that he was perfect but caught the rope around his wrist and could hear the snap from the stands. She tells him that Caleb was fine when he rode the horse and he's just as good, but Caleb is determined to win. He seems to be offended and leaves. Amy goes into town to get some food, but when she sees Wade and Lily head into a bar she rushes straight to the track to tell Ty. After he gets back she's pleased to see he has no cuts on his hands. Amy goes with the others to watch the race at the track, she tries to cheer up Tim when Lisa's horse Alberta Comet beats Dexter. Amy gets angry with Tim when he tries to blame Ty for Dexter becoming waterlogged, as he was supposed to be watching him. After helping Cody tell his Dad about wanting to play piano he thanks her, and she requests a free CD in return. (The Fix)\n\nAmy and Ty try not to make a big deal about him leaving tomorrow for university. Although Ty's adamant Amy seems to want to do something big for their last day, Ty's instead going to work with Scott. As they kiss Mallory manages to get a snap of them before running off. Outside the barn Ty tells Amy he's going to miss her and Harley while he's away. Mallory again tries to get a picture but is told to go away. Ty tells Amy they can go for a ride when he gets back but they will then have dinner and won't be any time and he heads off with Scott. Amy later notices a Briar Ridge vehicle arriving, Jack tells her she thought she could use the distraction. Val jumps out and asks Amy to work with Apollo since Ashley has said he's not jumping well anymore. She gets to work but he appears to be jumping well, until she's distracted with all of Val's \"help\" from the sidelines. Ty calls her to tell her he's going to be a bit longer as he has to fly with Scott to BC for a call out. Val tells her that in her day they called it a turkey dump because she'll soon just be the old girlfriend getting dumped by thanksgiving. Determined not to make that a reality Amy goes to see ty. Unfortunately at the airport, Amy's told she just missed them, so heads back to Heartland. She tells Jack how Val was driving her mad, he defends her saying she was a great jumper and knows what she's talking about. Amy admits that she hasn't been dealing with Ty leaving very well and agrees to give it another try with Apollo. Amy complains to Lou about what Val said about Ty dumping her, Lou starts to tell her about Peter's plans and that she's worried she might be pregnant. Amy convinces her to take a test. Amy works with Apollo again, when Ashley arrives asking what happened between her and Val. She admits she wasn't very professional but she was acting like it was the Grand Prix. Ashley tells Amy that she's been pushing for her to go on the Arizona circuit but has been there and done that, she blamed the horse to get out of it. The pair come up with a plan and Val arrives at Heartland. Amy tries to apologise but Val's distracted when she sees Ashley jumping Apollo beautifully. Ashley admits that they don't work well together in shows so it's best that they do other things together and she can stop wasting her money on the horse when there's nothing wrong. Amy and Ashley wash Apollo, Ashley thanks her for getting her mum off her back. Amy receives a text from Ty saying they're on their way home. Ashley convinces her to go to Maggie's and pick up the present she bought for him and go and meet him. She rushes to Maggie's and picks up the halter she chose for Ty with Harley's name on it, and rushes out again. Amy waits expectantly at the airport, re-reading her message from Ty excited about him arriving. The airport controller comes out and tells her that they have lost contact with the plane and don't know where it is. (Broken Arrow)\n\nIn shock, Amy gets back into her truck and heads home. At Heartland she fills everyone in on what's happened, while they try to comfort and reassure her. The police arrive and tell them that they are looking into it, there were reports of wind conditions which may have altered Scott's path. They haven't been able to locate the transponder so have no definitive location so will not be sending out a ground team yet, upsetting Amy. Amy tries to call Ty but gets no answer, devastated Jack tries to comfort her, she tells him how the last conversation they had was an argument. Peter assures Amy that he has his guys on it also, and will update her if there's any news. Amy again gets upset with Peter when she overhears him saying \"if\" they find them, she's determined to find them and storms off to the barn. Amy goes to see Harley when Tim arrives to console her. Later, the police give them an update of a more localised area and reports of a plane going down when she receives a radio message, she regrettably informs them that it wasn't Scott's plane. Amy is determined to go out looking for them themselves but Peter reassures her that the area is still too big and the RCMP know what they're doing as they've been trained for this, so should leave it to them. Amy lies in the Loft crying, re-reading Ty's last message when she hears Harley in distress. She puts on Ty's jacket and heads down, she tries to reassure him whilst also reassuring herself that Ty's coming home. Harley starts to calm down when he smells Ty's jacket, giving Amy an idea. In the morning, Amy tells everyone her plan to drive to the nearest road to the cras"
