        "text": "American comedian and actress (born 1981)\n\nAmy Beth Schumer[1] (born June 1, 1981) is an American stand-up comedian, actress, writer, producer, and director. Schumer ventured into comedy in the early 2000s before appearing as a contestant on the fifth season of the NBC reality competition series Last Comic Standing in 2007. From 2013 to 2016, she was the creator, co-producer, co-writer, and star of the Comedy Central sketch comedy series Inside Amy Schumer, for which she received a Peabody Award and was nominated for five Primetime Emmy Awards, winning Outstanding Variety Sketch Series in 2015.\n\nSchumer wrote and made her film debut in a starring role in Trainwreck (2015) earning a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical. She then starred in the comedy films Snatched (2017), and I Feel Pretty (2019). She created, produced and starred in the HBO documentary series Expecting Amy (2020), and the Hulu comedy-drama series Life & Beth (2022–present).\n\nShe made her Broadway debut acting in Steve Martin's comedic play Meteor Shower for which she earned a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play nomination. Schumer has earned two Grammy Award nominations for Best Comedy Album for Amy Schumer: Live at the Apollo, and Best Spoken Word Album for narrating her The New York Times Best Selling memoir The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo (2016).\n\nEarly life and education\n\nSchumer was born on June 1, 1981, on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, New York City,[1][2] to Sandra Jane (née Jones) and Gordon David Schumer, who owned a baby furniture company.[2][3][4] Schumer's father was born to a Jewish family from Ukraine.[5][6] She is a second cousin, once removed, of U.S. Senator and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.[7][8][9] Her mother is from a Protestant background and has deep New England roots, and converted to Judaism before her marriage.[4][10][11] Schumer was raised Jewish and says she had to deal with antisemitism as a child.[12][13][14] Her mother is of Puritan ancestry dating back to the colonial-era Massachusetts Bay Colony. In 2017, as a guest on Finding Your Roots, Schumer learned that in 1704, three children from her ancestor Thomas Tarbell's family were captured at Groton, Massachusetts, in a French-Abenaki raid and taken to Montreal. The girl was ransomed by a French-Canadian family and ultimately joined a French Catholic convent; the two boys were each adopted by Mohawk families at Kahnawake and became thoroughly assimilated. They married Mohawk women and some of their descendants became chiefs.[15] There are still Mohawk by the surname Tarbell in Kahnawake and Akwesasne, another village reserve on the St. Lawrence River founded by the brothers.\n\nThrough the success of her father's furniture company in Manhattan, Schumer's household was wealthy during her early years.[16] When she was nine years old, her father's business failed and he went bankrupt, and either then[7] or when she was 12[17] (sources differ), her father was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Some time afterward, her parents divorced.[7]\n\nSchumer moved to Long Island with her mother, Schumer lived in Rockville Centre, New York, and attended South Side High School.[18][15] She was voted both \"Class Clown\" and \"Teacher's Worst Nightmare\" upon graduation in 1999.[19]\n\nShe attended the Hebrew school of the Central Synagogue of Nassau County, a Reform synagogue in Rockville Centre, where her mother served on the school's board.[20][21]\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Schumer attended Towson University in Towson, Maryland, where she graduated with a degree in theater in 2003.[19][22] After graduating from college, she returned to New York City, where she studied at the William Esper Studio[23] for two years and worked as a bartender and a waitress.[19] She also lived in Santa Barbara, California with her boyfriend, who she characterized as abusive,[24] where she worked as a pedicab driver.[25] She has a younger sister, Kim Caramele, who is a comedy writer and a producer,[22][26] and a half-brother, Jason Stein,[27] who is a musician in Chicago, Illinois.[28][29]\n\nCareer\n\nAfter graduating with a degree in theater from Towson University in 2003 and moving to New York City, Schumer portrayed a young woman diagnosed with breast cancer in the Off-Off-Broadway black comedy Keeping Abreast.[19] She started doing stand-up comedy on June 1, 2004, when she first performed at Gotham Comedy Club.[30] In 2007, she recorded a Live at Gotham episode for Comedy Central before appearing on Last Comic Standing; she later recalled that she thought of the episode as her \"big break\".[31] Rebounding from an unsuccessful audition for an earlier season,[32] she advanced to the finals of the fifth season of the NBC reality television talent show Last Comic Standing and placed fourth.[30] Schumer said in April 2011, \"Last Comic was totally fun. I had a great time because there was no pressure on me; I had been doing stand-up around two years. I wasn't supposed to do well. So every time I advanced it was a happy surprise. I kept it honest on the show and it served me well.\"[33]\n\nSchumer co-starred in the Comedy Central reality show Reality Bites Back in 2008.[34] In 2009, she appeared in an advertising campaign for Butterfinger.[35] Schumer was a recurring guest on Fox News late-night program Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld between 2007 and 2012. Her first Comedy Central Presents special aired on April 2, 2010.

I like tackling the stuff nobody else talks about, like the darkest, most serious thing about yourself. I talk about life and sex and personal stories and stuff everybody can relate to, and some can't.\"[41] She acted in three films in 2012: the independent comedy Price Check, the comedy-drama Seeking a Friend for the End of the World, and the independent comedy Sleepwalk with Me.[42] Schumer also appeared on The Comedy Central Roast of Charlie Sheen in September 2011, and The Comedy Central Roast of Roseanne Barr in August 2012.

The play revolves around about two couples in 1993 who spend an evening with each other.[62] David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter wrote \"Schumer is one of four terrific performers who juice the entertainment of this high-sheen production...which would never have made it this far without Martin’s name behind it, or more crucially, without the marquee draw of Schumer making her Broadway debut.\"[63] Schumer was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play losing to Glenda Jackson for the revival of Edward Albee's Three Tall Women.[64][65]\n\nIn 2018, she starred in the comedy film I Feel Pretty which received negative reviews from critics.[66] Spotify released the original podcast Amy Schumer Presents: 3 Girls, 1 Keith on June 21, 2018, starring Schumer and her best comedy friends Rachel Feinstein, Bridget Everett and Keith Robinson as they talk about comedy, pop culture, politics and their personal lives.[67] She released her standup special Amy Schumer: Growing (2019) on Netflix to received positive reviews.[68] Schumer receiving a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Special nomination.[69] That same year she appeared as herself in the CBS comedy No Activity and the HBO series Crashing.[70][71]\n\nIn May 2020, Schumer alongside her husband Chris Fischer starred in an eight-episode cooking show Amy Schumer Learns to Cook, for Food Network which followed Schumer and Fischer cooking while quarantined during the COVID-19 pandemic.[72] The series was self-shot and also featured Schumer donating to The Coalition of Immokalee Workers Fair Food Program and domestic violence organizations.[73] It premiered on May 11, 2020.[74] She next appeared in a documentary series Expecting Amy, which she also executive produced, following Schumer preparing for a stand-up special while going through a difficult pregnancy for HBO Max, which premiered on July 9, 2020.[75][76]\n\nSchumer appeared in the 2021 film The Humans, based upon play of the same name directed by Stephen Karam.[77] She wrote, directed, and starred in Life & Beth, a 10-episode comedy series for Hulu which premiered on March 18, 2022.[78] The revival of her sketch series Inside Amy Schumer, which had been on hiatus since 2016, was announced in February 2021, with five additional specials to be released through Paramount+.[79] In January 2022, she was cast as a guest role for season two of Only Murders in the Building.[80] She co-hosted the 94th Academy Awards with Regina Hall and Wanda Sykes on March 27, 2022.[81] In June, she joined the cast of Jerry Seinfeld's Unfrosted.[82] In 2023 her comedy special Emergency Contact was released.\n\nInfluences\n\nSchumer's comedic influences include Wendy Liebman,[83] Carol Burnett,[84] Lucille Ball,[84] and Joan Rivers.[85] Additionally, she called actress-producer Goldie Hawn one of her \"heroes\".[85]\n\nIn media\n\nIn 2015, Schumer was named one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people.[86] Schumer was named to Barbara Walters' 10 Most Fascinating People for 2015.[87] Schumer has received praise for addressing various social issues through comedy.[88][89][90][91][92][93]\n\nIn June 2015, Monica Heisey of The Guardian criticized her for \"a shockingly large blind spot around race\".[93] Schumer responded on Twitter, stating \"I go in and out of playing an irreverent idiot. That includes making dumb jokes involving race ... You can call it a 'blind spot for racism' or 'lazy,' but you are wrong. It is a joke ... I am not racist.\"[94] Schumer was again criticized in July 2020 by Kyndall Cunningham of The Daily Beast for her earlier work, which included \"objectifying black men\" and calling Latina women \"crazy\". Cunningham described her \"sudden\" decision to support the Black Lives Matter movement as \"befuddling and laughable\".[95]\n\nThroughout 2015, several of Schumer's skits in Inside Amy Schumer went viral online, sparking editorials regarding sex, feminism, and rape culture.[96][97][98][99]\n\nAfter a fatal shooting took place at a showing of Trainwreck in Louisiana, Schumer advocated for stricter gun control laws and increased mental health funding.[100]\n\nIn November 2015, Schumer posed nude for a photo by photographer Annie Leibovitz for the 2016 edition of the Pirelli Calendar.[101] Schumer tweeted the photo, writing \"Beautiful, gross, strong, thin, fat, pretty, ugly, sexy, disgusting, flawless, woman.
