        "text": "Amy Schumer is cohosting this year’s Oscars, and yes, she showed up on the red carpet with a v special date. That date: her husband Chris Fischer, who she married back in 2018 and shares an extremely sweet baby boy with. In case you have been sleeping on this relationship and need to brush up on all things Chris (and Chris + Amy), here’s what you need to know.\n\nAmy’s Husband Chris Is an Extremely Accomplished Chef\n\nPut simply, Amy’s husband is a pretty famous chef from Martha’s Vineyard, and he focuses on cooking with farm-fresh local produce. He’s worked in several high-profile restaurants alongside celebrity chefs, worked as a private chef, and opened multiple restaurants. His family members have been in Martha’s Vineyard since roughly 1670.\n\nHis Family Owns Beetlebung Farm\n\nHence the name of his cookbook: The Beetlebung Farm Cookbook: A Year of Cooking on Martha’s Vineyard.\n\nBeetlebung Farm has been on Martha’s Vineyard for 250 years, but Chris’s family only came to own it in the 1960s. The farm was previously worked by his grandfather, but after he passed away, Chris continued to keep up with the land. In addition to growing produce, he has raised rabbits and at least one goat.\n\n.\n\nHe Owns Multiple Restaurants (and Has Been on Multiple Shows)\n\nChris worked at Babbo in New York City for years (and also worked in Rome and London, casual) before opening a restaurant at the Beach Plum Inn and later creating The Covington, both in his native Massachusetts.\n\nBut on top of the whole restaurant thing, Chris has been on multiple TV shows including Amy Schumer Learns to Cook, which premiered on Food Network in May 2020 and got an Emmy nom. And of course, Chris was also a big part of Amy’s documentary, Expecting Amy.\n\nHe’s Been Super Open About Being on the Autism Spectrum\n\nChris and Amy discussed his diagnosis in Expecting Amy, with Chris saying, “You have paid attention to my behavior in a way that nobody had before and noticed things because you’re very observant and kind of put together the pieces.”\n\nAmy also shared on Insta, “People have reached out to us saying that seeing our doc #expectingamy motivated them to get tested and that it has changed their lives. We want to encourage parents and people to give themselves the gift of information so people can function to the best of their abilities and remove any stigma that comes with autism.” She also noted, “Statistically our son most likely will be diagnosed as well, and if he’s anything like his father, that is wonderful news.”\n\nHis Sister Introduced Him to Amy\n\nAmy told Today that she knew Chris was The One about a month into their relationship, saying they started off as just friends for about six months before joking, “We got down to business really quick.” So…how did they meet? Apparently, Chris’s sister was Amy’s personal assistant and suggested that he cook for them one night in Martha’s Vineyard. Obviously, sparks flew!\n\nHis Proposal Was Iconic\n\nAmy told Howard Stern that Chris popped the question while she was in bed (asleep, wearing earplugs and a night mask) by waking her up, showing her a ring, and simply saying, “I got you this.” Apparently, they planned the wedding for only a few days and then Amy sent out a text to friends and family saying, “I’m getting married on Tuesday. I hope you can come.”\n\nWow. THE way to make sure only your best friends show up at your wedding!"
