        "text": "EX-GMA star TJ Holmes has teased that he and Amy Robach have taken the next step in their relationship and secretly tied the knot.\n\nTJ opened up about his relationship with his ex-TV co-host, Amy, on Thursday's installment of the couple's new podcast, Amy & TJ.\n\nDuring the episode, the pair answered listeners' questions regarding their whirlwind romance and career since news of their supposed affair broke.\n\nOne fan asked TJ if he'd consider getting matching tattoos with Amy, to which the father of one had a shocking response.\n\n\"How do you know we haven't already? We'll leave it at that,\" the TV star said after a brief pause.\n\n\"Getting a tattoo together. That's more of a commitment than marriage,\" TJ continued.\n\nAmy didn't have much to say, but after a few awkward moments, TJ made a surprising confession.\n\n\"Should we just tell everybody? We've got tattoos, we're married, and we live together,\" he jokingly revealed.\n\nAmy laughed at her lover's comment, seemingly hinting that his statement wasn't true.\n\nUnsure if they had more to add on the subject, the producer uncomfortably paused before moving on to the next question.\n\nSECRET ROMANCE\n\nAmy, 50, and TJ, 46, dropped their podcast earlier this month, where they dished on their widely buzzed-about relationship for the first time.\n\nThe duo made headlines in November 2022 when rumors circulated that they were romantically involved.\n\nThey were co-hosts of GMA3 at the time, and both were legally married to their spouses - Amy with her now ex-husband, Andrew Shue, 56, and TJ with his now ex-wife, Marilee Fiebig, 46.\n\nABC eventually fired the couple from their co-hosting gigs, and they distanced themselves from TV in the months after that.\n\nHowever, they're finally coming clean about the nature of their relationship and admitted things have gotten more serious between the pair.\n\nWEDDING PLANS?\n\nOn Tuesday's episode of their podcast, Amy revealed they are considering getting married.\n\n\"It’s under consideration. We did not enter this relationship for fun or ‘let's see what happens.’\n\n\"We entered this relationship because we intended on spending our lives together. I don't know. We both have two marriages under our belts.\n\n\"And so it’s not something we’re racing to or rushing towards. But there is something, I get it. There’s this desire. I want to spend the rest of my life with you,\" the TV personality claimed.\n\n\"But you don’t want to marry me?” TJ teasingly replied.\n\n\"It's on the table. But wait, how about you? Only I answered that,\" Amy snapped back.\n\nTJ then admitted that there's a \"small box under the tree” at home for his girlfriend.\n\n\"I want to marry you….. In part. I want to marry you because you are 50, and I'm 46, and I'm sick of introducing you as my girlfriend,\" the podcast host said.\n\n“Thanks for noting the age difference,\" Amy shot back.\n\nThe world was recently shocked to discover that Amy and TJ's exes, Andrew and Marilee, have been dating for months.\n\n\"It turned into something else, and they’re connected over their values. It’s bigger than the affair now,\" a source told Page Six.\n\n\"They’re not heartbroken and sad,” said another insider. \"Everyone has moved on.\""
