        "text": "Norwegian Peace Initiative\n\nFor Larger Freedoms: Pursuit of Peace in Sri Lanka\n\nPresident Chandrika Kumaratunga\n\nat Asia Society, New York\n\n14 September 2005\n\nIt is a pleasure to be here at the Asia Society once again. Over the past eleven years as President of Sri Lanka, I have had the occasion to visit New York City, several times. During these visits, I have also invariably visited your Society and addressed you. My visits to New York and the United Nations have become inextricably linked to my having to deliver a talk at the Asia Society. So that now I have begun to think of a visit to New York as a visit to the Asia Society. I also take great personal pleasure in getting an opportunity to brief the distinguished members and guests here about the situation in Sri Lanka, and to reflect on the challenges Sri Lanka faces in achieving peace and development, and consolidating democracy.\n\nSpeaking before a distinguished and learned audience such as you is also a challenge. As someone who left a doctoral academic program in politics because I could not resist the lure of politics in the real world, I continue to suffer from envy of those who engage on a daily basis in intellectual activity, and hold in awe those who have something to say that is not just novel, but intellectually so. So Mr. Chairman my opportunity to address you has also become for me an intellectually fulfilling challenge to describe our policies with regard to the key issues we face, and also how our thinking about it has evolved. I hope this could give you some elements to reflect upon similar political challenges in other parts of Asia, if not the world. This is also the last address I will make to the Asia Society as President of Sri Lanka . And I wish to express that I will always cherish the hospitality the Asia Society has extended to me over the years.\n\nIt is a sad and tragic moment in the United States today because of the destruction wrought by hurricane Katrina. We have been humbled before the power of nature, just as we were on December 26th last year by the Tsunami. I wish to express the sympathy and solidarity of myself, my government and the people of Sri Lanka with you at this moment of incredible challenge. In an address to the nation two days after the Tsunami struck in Sri Lanka, I said:\n\n\"This is a moment of great humility for us all. We have been incredibly humbled by Nature's great forces. An ineluctable truth has been laid bare before us all. The mighty forces of Nature have compelled us to learn a lesson that some of us refused for long to learn��This disaster has not been selective in the destruction it has wrought. �Nature does not differentiate in the treatment of peoples. Loss of life, loss and destruction of property take place irrespective of whether it is in the North or South. It knows no difference between religions or castes: the high and low in society or the rich and the poor. It is necessary that we reflect carefully upon this lesson nature has taught us.\"\n\nI dare say that these thoughts are no less relevant to you as Americans, even though, or especially because, you live in what many call the sole superpower in the globe today. And so my heart goes out to the people of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, and the wonderful city of New Orleans, especially the poor and the helpless who have suffered from the hurricane, and my government and I are ready to assist in any small way we can.\n\nMr. Chairman, you may recall that my Foreign Minister, Hon Lakshman Kadirgamar was with me, here, last year when I visited you at the Asia Society. He was assassinated just over a month ago. His killing is a dastardly act committed by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). Mr. Kadirgamar was an opponent of Tamil and Sinhala extremisms.\n\nHe opposed the terrorism of the LTTE and he supported a federal solution to the conflict within a democratic and plural Sri Lanka that addressed the aspirations of all communities - a longtime demand of many Tamil political leaders. He was killed for his courage in acting on his views. And he was killed because he happened to be born a Tamil, who worked for a united and democratic Sri Lanka. Something the LTTE, which claims to be the sole representative of the Tamil people, does not yet agree with.\n\nHis assassination not only challenged my personal commitment, but also that of a vast majority of the people of the country to pursuing a negotiated settlement with the LTTE. Although, my government had the option of a military response, we rejected it. And instead chose a different approach - to re-iterate our commitment to a ceasefire and to a political solution, whilst reviewing the approach towards negotiating with the LTTE we had hitherto taken. Such a review has just begun at a practical level with a call to the international community to help exert real pressure on the LTTE, in order that we can engage them in a process that will lead to a lasting peace, bringing about democracy and human rights.\n\nThis is also a good time for such a review because of Sri Lanka's political calendar. A new President will be elected in the next few months and he will get an opportunity to begin fresh efforts to move the peace process. And so I can be a bit more self-reflective about what such a peace process may look like.\n\nAs I reflect upon the different elements of the peace process at the national level in Sri Lanka - bringing an end to violent hostilities, rebuilding the conflict-affected areas, strengthening human rights, and working out a political solution - and the need to link these elements in a way that leads to what we hope maybe a positive cycle of peace - I see a resonance with the Secretary General's Report to the 2005 Summit - \"In Larger Freedom\".\n\nThere he observes that security, human rights and development go hand in hand. Some say that in Sri Lanka, or in other peace processes, it may be desirable in theory to tackle each element of the peace process one step at a time - first to end hostilities, then rebuild conflict-affected areas, then strengthen human rights, and finally to workout a political solution. However, reality is more complicated.\n\nFor example, a breakthrough in the political solution can promote opportunities for development. Or efforts at improving human rights can contribute to working out a political solution. Or for that matter, socio-economic opportunities gained from development can provide an incentive for avoiding war. In other words, we need to be open to the possibility that the world (particularly the world of war and peace) works in a non-linear and sometimes chaotic fashion, even as we, as rational human beings, may try to bring order to our understanding of it.\n\nConceptual Underpinnings of \"Larger Freedom\"\n\nBefore I get into the details of the Sri Lankan peace process, I would like to begin with basic principles, and ask: what are the fundamental sources of conflict in a political community where many different people live together? I see three such sources of conflict: moral conflict over competing, if not contradictory ideals; inequality even in the presence of a moral consensus; and competition over goods and services. Let me elaborate, briefly.\n\nAs human beings, blessed with reason and imagination, we think about the world we live in. We ask questions of ourselves. Why are we here? What are we meant to do? How should we treat others? What happens when we die? These questions are so common, that they may appear trite? But they underlie an important universality about us, and reflect our yearning for something more than the houses we live in, the food we eat and the pleasures we enjoy.\n\nWhile these questions are common, the answers we supply to them are diverse. They differ if you are a Hindu, a Jew, a Christian, a Muslim, a Buddhist or a Jain, or if you are a liberal, a Marxist, a rationalist, a utilitarian or a libertarian. Clearly, each of us thinks that some answers are better than others. And so we differ in where the answers to these fundamental questions will lead us. But, if there is one thing we have learned from these thousands of years of human civilization, it is that we will always differ in the answers to these questions.\n\nThey have differed, in the past, and they will continue to, in the future. No amount of rational and reasonable debate will lead to a convergence on these ideals. You in the west have a greater experience with the kind of violence this conflict can cause with the religious wars that were a tragic part of European history. But they led to important lessons, and so political institutions evolved that gave expression to human freedom - freedoms of conscience, expression and association. These freedoms have now become an integral part of all democratic societies, and we have learned to avoid the dark lessons that you were forced to learn through experience.\n\nThe second source of conflict is inequality. This is particularly true of societies that have a democratic tradition, where there is both a belief that human beings deserve to be treated with equal dignity, and that this ought to be enshrined in practical arrangements. It is of course hard to find a political community today where such sentiments do not exist. So when people, even if they share the same moral values, feel that they are not treated equally they can resist and fight. While it has become fashionable today to disregard inequality as a source of conflict, particularly globally, I believe that it will always be an important source of conflict, because of the deep belief we all have that unfair advantage over another is, unjust.\n\nAnd it is hard to find a political constitution today where the equal worth of a human being is disregarded or seen as irrelevant to setting up the rules that will govern a society.\n\nThe third source of conflict is competition for scarce goods and services, because we still do not live in an egalitarian world of abundance. We want more, so we get together in groups to ask for more and fight for more. These groups may be ethnic groups, political groups, neighbourhood groups, religious groups or language groups. The source of conflict here is not necessarily the group identity itself, but the claims made by a group for a greater share of the resources. When a province says that its development has been neglected or when an ethnic group asks for more admissions to university or when a city asks for more resources, they are making claims for greater resources to be shared with them. Whether or not these claims are justified, they can lead to conflict.\n\nThese three sources of conflict are clearly intertwined and can also be sources of conflict, globally, when we fail to recognize and act on the equal dignity of all humans who live in the world today. The United Nations Secretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan, understands this when he says in his report: \"I have named the present report \"In larger freedom\" to stress the enduring relevance of the United Nations and to emphasise that its purposes must be advanced in the lives of individual men and women.\"\n\nThe Secretary General's report is a search for a practical way of recognizing and acting upon this equal dignity globally, in a world of great inequality of wealth and power. He seeks to do this politically by integrating human rights, with development and security. The deeper conceptual point in the Secretary General's report then is not just that people must have equal access to say health, and equal civil and political rights. But that equal access to health care is needed for equal civil and political rights."
