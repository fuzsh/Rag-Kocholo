        "text": "THE SIRIMAVO BANDARANAIKE MEMORIAL EXHIBITION CENTRE\n\nThe Sirimavo Bandaranaike Memorial Exhibition Centre was built in 2003 in memory of Late Sirimavo Bandaranaike, the first stateswoman in the world. This grand addition was yet another gift from the Government of China in celebration of her role.\n\nThe Sirimavo Bandaranaike Memorial Exhibition Centre attracts a variety of exhibitors from around the world. The Centre can be termed as an enterprise hub where local and international vendors meet from numerous sectors such as Education, Construction, Engineering, Gems and Jewellery, Apparels, Local produce as well as Entertainment. It is a prime venue to showcase international exhibits due to the availability of classy and multi-functional facilities.\n\nThis centre was amplified during the era of Hon. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaranatunga, the President of Sri Lanka (1994) as well as the President of the Bandaranaike Foundation. During her tenure, she had rapidly magnified the operations by developing the social, financial and artistic elements. The efforts taken by her are greatly appreciated."
