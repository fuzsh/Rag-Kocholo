        "text": "Colombo: - Ambassador M. Ashraf Haidari is honored to have met the legendary former President of Sri Lanka Chandrika Kumaratunga, one of his role-model world leaders with a stellar public service record, on July 31, 2019. The former President is spearheading Sri Lanka's ongoing peacebuilding programs with a large number of beneficiaries--including children, youth, and adults of both genders--from the Tamil, Muslim, and Sinhalese communities.\n\nThe former President highlighted \"Heal the Past, Build the Future\" as one of her successdul reconciliation programs with lessons to be learned by Afghanistan. Moreover, they discussed the peace efforts of President Ashraf Ghani, as well as the need for direct talks with the Taliban.\n\nPresident Kumaratunga pointed out her experience with the LTTE, often welcoming peace initiatives only to undermine them and continue fighting to kill and maim innocent civilians. Ambassador Haidari noted that the Afghan government is currently experiencing the same situation where the Taliban go around to meet about peace in different world capitals, while daily escalating violence across Afghanistan.\n\nThe former President kindly offered to invite over a delegation from the High Peace Council of Afghanistan to visit Sri Lanka for lessons to be learned from the country's peace process under her presidency (1994-2005), as well as current peacebuilding programs.\n\nRead one of Ambassador Haidari's interviews on \"The Afghan Peace Process\" at the following link:\n\nhttps://thediplomat.com/2018/05/the-afghan-peace-process-an-faq/\n\n***"
