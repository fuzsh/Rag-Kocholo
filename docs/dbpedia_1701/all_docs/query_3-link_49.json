        "text": "It hasn’t been long since EVNNE made their debut on the K-Pop scene, but they’ve already returned with their first comeback and won their first music show! During their promotional period for “UGLY” the members Keita, Park Hanbin, Lee Jeonghyeon, Yoo Seungeon, Ji Yunseo, Mun Junghyun, and Park Jihoo sat down with The Kraze and our fellow media colleagues to talk about their comeback more in-depth.\n\nQ: It was previously mentioned that this comeback is a bit different and darker than the debut concept. How do you feel about tackling this new concept?\n\nYunseo: Instead of characterizing this comeback as \"darker\" than our previous one, I believe it's more accurate to describe it as a maturation process. We've transitioned from being immature, boyish troublemakers to individuals who have experienced pain, revealing aspects that were not previously shown to the public.\n\nJihoo: I also think that there's more to showcase in our performances compared to our debut. I'm genuinely excited about unveiling this aspect of our group to the public through this comeback.\n\nSeungeon: Similarly, we aimed to present a more mature side of ourselves, compared to the mischievous and playful image we had during our debut. Additionally, we sought to convey our internal emotions and feelings in a more profound and in-depth manner than before.\n\nQ: Do you have your favorite moments that you'd like to share with us from the preparations of your first comeback?\n\nYS: Completing the last promotion with [a] fan meet-up event, the thought of seeing our fans again to share the stage always lingered in my mind. It's challenging to pinpoint just one moment, as every step in the preparation process was new and filled with excitement, all centered around the anticipation of reuniting with our fans.\n\nSE: I always strive to challenge myself with new styles of music and songs. During the recording of the five tracks for this album, my enthusiasm was fueled by the desire to let our fans hear these songs. Therefore, the recording process became the most enjoyable and exciting part of the entire preparation for me.\n\nHanbin: For me, the most memorable moment was when I heard the title track for the first time. Since recording is the initial step in preparing an album, listening to the track filled me with excitement as I thought about the concept and envisioned the kind of performance we could deliver. Also, we all had a great first reaction after listening to the song.\n\n*Q: As this era is about showing the unseen sides of yourselves, what are songs or performances of your seniors or other artists that you'd like to show a cover of in the future?\n\nHB: My role model is WOODZ, and he recently released a new song titled \"Amnesia.\" I love the band sound of the song and I hope to develop my vocal skills, dedicating time to practice and eventually covering the song in the future.\n\nYS: I would like to cover \"Spark\" by Taeyeon and \"Love Poem\" by IU. I want to show more developed vocal skills, so I hope to try and cover the song in the future.\n\nLee Jeonghyeon: Currently, I'm deeply interested in dance, and I'm eager to excel in this skill. We have been covering a lot of songs of the senior artists through TikTok challenges, and while covering their dance is great, I also saw many freestyle dance videos of senior artists. Therefore my goal is to practice and eventually showcase my own freestyle dance video in the future.\n\n*Q: What was the most challenging part of the \"UGLY\" choreography?\n\nJihoo: The choreography for the chorus of the song was the most difficult. There is a part where we have to keep our balance which is quite hard so I recall having a challenging time trying to perfect it.\n\nHB: The choreography for the lyric \"Big shot\" demanded us to stand on one foot for some time, making it quite challenging to maintain our balance during that segment.\n\n*Q: What is the biggest goal or dream that you have as a group?\n\nSE: It would be winning first place on a music show. In this comeback, we secured the top spot on the Bugs! music charts, and I wish to attain similar success on other charts, with a particular dream of making it onto the Billboard charts someday.\n\n*Q: You participated in making of several of your songs. What are other themes and music genres that you would like to explore in the future?\n\nYS: EVNNE has established an image as troublemakers with a powerful and intense concept. I am interested in exploring a concept that retains the essence of a troublemaker but introduces a brighter and more refreshing image.\n\nLJH: Just as Yunseo said, and as a group, we share the belief that we are capable of exploring and excelling in various genres without being confined to a specific style. So I'm certain that we will be able to pull off any musical genres.\n\n*Q: With your new album called \"Un:SEEN,\" what are the members' each unseen talents?\n\nMun Junghyun: Jihoo is a big basketball fan, but I believe our fans [have] yet to see him playing basketball. I think they will be surprised to see how well he plays.\n\nKeita: Rapping skills of Seungeon. I seriously believe it to be quite attractive so I hope for a chance in the future to show it off to our fans.\n\n*Q: A few of you participated in writing the melodies and the lyrics for the album, \"Un:SEEN.\" What is your creative process like?\n\nK: I participated in the lyrics and composition of the song \"Festa\" in this album. The inspiration for this track stemmed from the festive atmosphere during a fan meet-up and the excitement I had while interacting with our fans. I drew a comparison between that to a festival.\n\nSE: I took part in the lyrics-writing process for the fourth track of the album, \"Chase.\" Initially, I got into the process with the mindset to challenge myself and to gain experience. I concentrated on writing lyrics with pronunciation that complements the melody and aligns with the dreamy vibe of the song. I'm pleased to have shared my lyrics with our fans through this song.\n\nLJH: I participated in writing the lyrics for the song titled \"SYRUP.\" Drawing a parallel between the group's irresistible charms and the word “syrup,” I aimed to emphasize our talents and appeal through the lyrics. My goal was to encapsulate all of our charms in this song, allowing listeners to get a good sense of what it is by simply listening to the song.\n\n*Q: If you had to choose one song from the mini-album, which track do you think best represents EVNNE’s colors as a group?\n\nMJH: As EVNNE takes on the concept of troublemakers, I think the track \"UGLY\" best captures this. I also think we will be able to show an intense, powerful aspect of the group through this song.\n\nYS: I also choose the title track, \"UGLY\" While we initially portrayed a younger, immature version of troublemakers in the title track of our previous album, \"TROUBLE,\" the representation of troublemakers in this album, Un:SEEN, takes on a more mature tone, delving into individual pain that we've never revealed before. I believe the title track truly encapsulates the refined image of troublemakers we aim to convey to the world in this album.\n\n*Q: Still being a relatively new group, what's something \"Un: SEEN\" about yourselves that you wish to reveal with this comeback?\n\nMJH: Until now, we haven't been able to showcase a particularly powerful side of the group. I hope to demonstrate this facet of our group through the title track, \"UGLY.\"\n\nJH: I also aim to create an impression for the public that all members of the group are versatile, excelling in dancing, singing, and rapping.\n\nHB: Through reality shows and social media, we have cultivated an easygoing and comfortable image to our fans and the public. I wish to continue to show our easygoing and relaxed side of ourselves in this album as well.\n\nThank you to EVNNE, Jellyfish Entertainment, and Helix Publicity for giving us the opportunity to speak with the members.
