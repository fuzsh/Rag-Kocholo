        "text": "Carly Pearce celebrated three years of Grand Ole Opry membership on Saturday (Aug. 3), and to mark the day, she showed fans her new, Opry-themed tattoo.\n\nOn Instagram, she shared a close-up shot of her new ink: A small black-and-white postage stamp stylized with a guitar, the words \"Grand Ole Opry\" and \"WSM,\" and the year she was inducted.\n\nLong before she officially got her invite, Pearce was vocal about how special the Grand Ole Opry was to her -- and on the night she was inducted, she promised to keep the legendary stage close to her heart forever. Now, she's taking that promise one step further by etching its name onto her skin.\n\n\"August 3, 2021 was a day that I have worked for and dreamed about since I was 5 years old,\" she wrote in the caption as she debuted her tattoo. \"Being a member of the Grand Ole Opry means I will have a home in country music for the rest of my life, so it only made sense to celebrate that gift with a tattoo that I'll have for life.\"\n\nShe also explained that for her, the new ink symbolizes a reminder \"that hard work and belief can take me anywhere.\"\n\nPearce has consistently prioritized traditional, songwriter-forward country music over the course of her career, and that's truer than ever in her newest album, Hummingbird. That project came out in early June, and is the singer's fourth studio album to date.\n\nRelated: Carly Pearce Shares a Health Update After Heart Condition Diagnosis\n\nIts singles include the Chris Stapleton duet \"We Don't Fight Anymore\" as well as Pearce's newest release to radio, \"Truck on Fire.\""
