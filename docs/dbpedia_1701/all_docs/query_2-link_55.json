        "text": "Trey Lewis went viral with his 2020 song “Dicked Down in Dallas,” but he wants fans to know he’s more than that. Lewis is currently preparing to release his new album Troublemaker on March 1, and recently released the new song “Mine Never Could.” In an interview with Music Mayhem, Lewis opened up about his new music and past success, as well as what’s next for him in 2024.\n\nDiscusses New Song “Mine Never Could”\n\n“Mine Never Could” was written by Matt Jenkins, Zachary Kale and Deric Ruttan and finds Lewis attempting to process the fact that an ex may have moved on. The singer revealed that he had the song on hold for three years and recorded it three different times, waiting for “the perfect time to put it out.”\n\n“I realized it’s a great song and people relate to it, no matter if it’s their current situation, or they’ve been there before,” he said.\n\nTrey Lewis To Release New Album Troublemaker In March\n\nLewis’ new album Troublemaker will feature 14 songs, each of which explore a different chapter of his life. “I can’t say thank you enough for being in the trenches with me, fighting to get to this point,” the Alabama native reflected, adding, “I’m really excited for people to continue to hear the music that I’ve been pouring myself into. I think there is a little something for everyone on there!”\n\nThat includes autobiographical tracks that allow Lewis to be vulnerable and honest with his fans, something that’s not new to him.\n\n“It’s just been the way I’ve always been,” he explained. “It’s not just my music, it’s how I live my life. I’m kind of a tell-all person. I wear my heart on my sleeve, and that’s just how I am. A lot of the artists I look up to are like that. I think we get something from creating music that we can’t get anywhere else, so why not just be real?”\n\nA lyric from Troublemaker’s title track reads, “we need more rule breakers, a few good troublemakers,” with Lewis noting that he “was a troublemaker growing up, and I’m still making trouble today, but I try to be a good person and want to show the world that it’s ok to be yourself.”\n\nWants Listeners To Know He’s More Than The “Dicked Down In Dallas Guy”\n\nAs for the song that put him on the map, Lewis shared that while he understands that many listeners know him for “Dicked Down In Dallas,” he hopes that “people see more than that.”\n\n“I know everybody’s not going to, but I’m going to keep putting out music that is authentically me and try and convert the ‘DDID’ fans to Trey Lewis fans,” he said. “It just takes time, you know? It took me 10 years to even get a song that people would really listen to on repeat. It took me 12 years to get to the point I’m at now, so I’m just going to keep working and putting out music until we catch up to the song.”\n\nLewis added that he thinks the song will always be a part of his career and is “going to always bring me new fans.”\n\n“I have realized that people that like ‘DDID’ are country music fans too,” he said, explaining that just because he has a song like “DDID,” which “wasn’t meant to be serious,” doesn’t mean he “can’t sing other styles of country music too.”\n\n“I will always embrace that side of me because that’s part of who I am,” he revealed. “I’ll also embrace parts of my painful past too because they are my greatest asset. I look at ‘DDID’ as the foundation rather than something to escape from. I can’t be ungrateful for it just because it’s explicit.”\n\nTrey Lewis Recently Celebrated Three Years Of His Life-Changing, Viral Hit\n\nLewis shared that the three years since he released “Dicked Down In Dallas” have “been insane, to say the least.”\n\n“I’ve been able to do things I only dreamed about,” he effused. “Going into venues across the country and selling tickets, building a fan base and not having to play covers for a living anymore. I’ve watched my friends’ lives change because of that song. So it’s just been a crazy ride.”\n\nLewis will kick off 2024 with a winter tour beginning later this month, which the singer said will be “a party,” adding that while he is sober, “I like to show people a good time.”\n\n“I’ve never really been out to the West Coast to tour with my band, so I’m excited to get out there and tear it up,” he shared. “We’ve had a nice little winter break here, so I’m looking forward to being back with the guys, my band of brothers, and just being out there in it. It’s going to be great.”"
