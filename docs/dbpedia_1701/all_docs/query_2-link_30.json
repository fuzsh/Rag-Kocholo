        "text": "Cathy Grier\n\nAt an early age Cathy loved the Blues and had a chance encounter when she was 17 with John Lee Hooker. As a young social activist, Cathy learned you can write about the environment and a breakup at the same time (recalling Joni Mitchell’s “Big Yellow Taxi) and loves to be socially conscious in her songwriting. She believes music is a healer and a powerful tool that crosses boundaries to help diffuse ignorance and hate. Her love of performing the Blues has found a home in Wisconsin!\n\nCathy Grier’s four decade long career is a rich musical tapestry with highlights ranging from an MTV video in the 80’s, opening up for legendary artists Laura Nyro, The Band, and Joan Armatrading. She Lived in France in the 90’s, toured and wrote for many artists, including a #1 dance hit. In 2019 Cathy wrote a Blues score for Documentary film “My First And Last Film,”\n\nCathy spent 20 years in New York mostly performing under the name NYC Subway Girl as part of the Music Under New York Program, and was featured on CBS Sunday Morning, and performed at legendary Avery Fisher Hall. She created “The Inspiration Project,” a video mini-doc series, where she asks passersby a simple yet complex question “What inspires you?”\n\nCathy Grier + the Troublemakers recorded and released “I’m All Burn,” a 16-song full production album (July 2020 on CG Music Works label). Recorded at Makin’ Sausage Music in Milwaukee, it features the Troublemakers and many notables in the Blues world. The album has received wide range airplay nationally and internationally and on the 2021 top 100 RMR Contemporary Blues chart. It reached #1 for multiple weeks on the Wisconsin blues charts. They have performed at Summerfest since 2017. Cathy Grier + The Troublemakers band represented Paramount Music Association and Wisconsin at the IBC International Blues Challenge (IBC) 2022 semi-finalists.\n\nCathy moved to Sturgeon Bay after meeting bassist Tony Menzer during a Blues night he hosted at Badger Bowl in Madison in the fall of 2015. A call from melaniejane and pat mAcdonald invited her to participate in the Steel Bridge Song Fest in Sturgeon Bay, WI in June of 2016. That chance opportunity turned into the unexpected residence full time in Sturgeon Bay. Her love of performing the Blues has found a home in Wisconsin. She represented Paramount Music Association (Grafton) as a Soloist International Blues Challenge (IBC) in 2018. She formed the band Troublemaker’s in 2017 for her first Summerfest, and continue to perform there every year. Cathy Grier’s undeniably powerful voice accompanied by tasty Blues guitar stylings affirms her place on the world stage.\n\nIn Cathy’s words a 40+ Year Journey\n\nI’ve had an eclectic world throughout my life as a singer & songwriter, producer, film maker, social activist, and NYC Busker aka NYCSubwayGirl.\n\nSome intense and multi-layered snapshots that inform my music and life: I grew up in Connecticut. I have lived and performed in Key West (80’s) and France (90’s. A French/Swedish pop star named Indra sang my lyrics for a French dance hit. With a 14-piece band, I sang in the Paris Opera at the Hermes/Rostropovich wedding, and even traveled to perform in Morocco.\n\nI rode in an almost-sinking gondola in Venice, weighed down by amps and drums, while writing for an award-winning French recording artist (Nilda Fernandez). I have had solo performances in Brazil, England, and Wales.\n\nDespite many attempts, I cannot forget performing at the Holiday Inn in Paladka, Florida... a New Years Eve gig in Yapoon, Australia… dancing on a table at a bar mitzvah in Paris... and a Donald Trump Atlantic City gig, if you can believe that. My have times changed in a weird way, certainly.\n\nI toured Germany with a French girl band, Parallel Vif, as lead guitarist (90’s). And recorded my first demo at Paul Leka’s studio (‘79) he wrote 'Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye' and where I learned engineering and producing skills. Later I joined forces with Lenore Troia (keys) and formed the band Troia/Grier. We performed at Folk City, Lone Star Cafe (opened for The Band) and the original Bitter End, where we met producer Roy Radin (his tale is one from the crypt).\n\nI sing in small empty churches for their amazing acoustics and pure spirituality. I sing for friends at family special occasions and sad events. Great Aunt Molly loved how I sang La Vie En Rose (especially while cooking omelets), not to mention a heartfelt Amazing Grace.\n\nMusic is life to me and it comes in many sounds, shapes and sizes.—\n\nThe New York Years\n\nAfter living in France for most of the ‘90’s, I returned to Key West to record my first full production album ‘Retracing the breakup of Troia/Grier. I settled in NYC where I co-wrote songs for Sony artist Anggun and produces and engineered many NYC artists. During this time, I met and had the once in a lifetime opportunity to work with Alicia Keys as her live sound engineer in 2001.\n\nFrom 1999-2015,I participated in New York City’s MTA program, Music Under New York where I was affectionally known as NYC Subway Girl to all. Playing my original music to millions of passing commuters has always been a highlight.\n\nIn the early 2000’s I was quoted ”The connection with the audience = commuters on their way to their destination, is a very different experience than performing on a stage. It's a deconstructed approach to music. Most of us are living in a multi-tasking, low fidelity, and ear-bud listening digitized and photoshopped world. Street performing is authentic in the pure fact that it is live-sometimes challenging, certainly spontaneous, which makes it exciting to me. My style is what I call folked-up blues. It's funky, it's groovy, and it fits in with the chaos of the underground. Underground, commuters and I are collaborators in a musical, rhythmic, spontaneous soundtrack.”\n\nI also worked as a stage hand for Eve Ensler's The Vagina Monologues at the Hammerstein Ballroom in 1998, and continued in subsequent years at Apollo Theatre and Madison Square Garden. In 2003, I released ‘Comin’ Back To Me,’ a solo recording (Magic Shop, NYC).\n\nI fought hepatitis C and won, lost friends and a cousin to AIDS, wrote songs from my heart and believe that all is possible, and world events inspire my blues.\n\nIn NYC, I graced stages at Joe's Pub, Studio 54, Arlene's Grocery and the Brooklyn Academy Of Music as a recipient of a 5 Continents Annual Award. I appeared at The New Museum, Avery Fisher Hall and on CNN, CBS Sunday Morning, and NBC’s Today Show, all as a result of my subway performances.\n\nThe idea of NYCsubwaygirl came to my after waking up on a cold February 2009 morning to find myself on the cover of AM New York, a free daily newspaper distributed throughout the city: \"The headline got it exactly wrong - playing in the subway is about my art, not the pay - but as they say, \"never let the truth get in the way of a good story.\" None of that seemed to matter anyway -- suddenly \"subway girl\" seemed to describe what I am to commuters: that girl who plays in the subway. Yet I have so much more to say and express. Thus, NYCsubwaygirl was born.\"\n\nIn late 2000’s I said \"Whether it's a blues song or inspired jazzy melody I love to sing and play guitar. Some say I have that Bonnie Raitt sound, or Concrete Blonde edge. I live in NYC, sing in the subway because I love performing in public spaces.\"\n\nAlthough my life has changed dramatically since this statement, my attitude and grit have not."
