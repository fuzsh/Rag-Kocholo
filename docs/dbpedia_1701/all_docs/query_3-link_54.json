        "text": "You really have to work hard to misunderstand Steve Earle: He’s one of folk and alternative country’s most outspoken performers — and, some might say, a professional troublemaker or, even, political agitator.\n\nHe does not evade questions or mince words, whether he’s talking about the driving habits of folks in Greater Boston (“They drive like taxi drivers in Mexico City,” he says, “and that’s some of the worst driving I’ve ever seen in the world.”) or his beloved — and currently third-place —Yankees (“My sister lives in Boston, so I have to deal with that crap from my brother-in-law whenever I come to town,” he says. “But the Yankees have, what, 24 more world championships than the Red Sox?”)\n\nOr, more to the point, when dealing with people who complain that he has shied away from the political trigger at a crucial point in “the struggle” with “Washington Square Serenade,” his new album, which finds the firebrand in a much happier place personally. (“Let them write their own protest songs,” he says. “Let them step up to the plate. I’m in a good place. It’s someone else’s turn.”)\n\nOr that, because he’s in such a good place, personally and professionally, he’s lost his edge, political or otherwise, after falling in love with — and marrying — fellow country music star Allison Moore. “I refuse to be defined as an ‘angry guy.’ I wrote a song called ‘Angry Young Man,’ but that doesn’t mean that’s who I am,” he says. “I’m pretty happy, but that’s doesn’t mean I’m going to keep my mouth shut.”\n\nAnd he isn’t, as Earle, 52, made clear during his Saturday performance at the Newport Folk Festival.\n\n“I know it seems like I’ve been quiet, but I’ve been doing stuff, trust me. I’m far too subversive on a cellular level to stay completely out of it.”\n\nEarle, who performs Aug. 15 at the Theater at Newburyport High School in his first-ever North Shore show, is furiously animated, and apocalyptic in his language, when discussing the current election, saying the United States is completely polarized and unable — or unwilling — to declare what it wants to be in the future, which translates into whether there will be a future.\n\n“We’ll be deciding if this country is something that deserves to survive into the future, or whether we’ll cease to exist,” he says during a telephone interview from Halifax, Nova Scotia. “It’s not bleak, it’s just the way it is. I’m hopeful. We have a choice.”\n\nHe’s in Halifax recharging a bit between dates. It’s a frantic schedule. “It’s my job,” he says. “These days anyone who has a job, let alone a job he likes, is lucky and probably shouldn’t complain about it. These days jobs are in short supply.”\n\nMusical school of hard knocks\n\nEarle broke through with “Guitar Town,” his first album, which was a critical and popular success. The follow-up albums “Exit 0” and “Copperhead Road” built on that foundation\n\nHe’s had high profile bouts with addiction and run-ins with the law, which nearly forced him to call his music career quits for two years. He eventually ended up in jail on gun charges and dealt with the drug issue there. He released “Train a Coming,” just 18 months after getting out of the joint. It was nominated for a Grammy in 1996.\n\nHe has been difficult to pin down, stylistically, experimenting with a range of styles from country and bluegrass music to folk and hard rock. But there’s no doubt Earle has been front and center in the left-leaning rock-in-opposition movement, releasing “The Revolution Starts Now” and “Jerusalem,” overtly political smackdowns of the Bush years.\n\nThe latter included “John Walker Blues, a song that looked at — and some say celebrated — the so-called American Taliban, John Walker Lindh. It also included, in the chorus, a Moslem prayer (A shadu la ilaha illa Allah/There is no God but God.)Yes, he took some grief for that.\n\n“Washington Square Serenade,” which won the 2008 Grammy for Best Contemporary Folk Album, is something completely different, or so it seems at first blush. It opens with “Tennessee Blues,” updating the title track of Earle’s 1986 debut, and establishes the sense of another fresh start. It includes “Sparkle and Shine,” which has a Dylanish feel, and “Days Aren’t Long Enough,” which Earle co-wrote and sings with Moorer, his wife — and touring partner. She will open for Earle at the Aug. 15 concert in Newburyport.\n\nThe album closes with a frightening cover of Tom Waits’ “Way Down in the Hole.” Compared with “Revolution” and “Jerusalem,” it is a happier musical document, one that reflects his current situation: happily (and newly) married and settled down in Greenwich Village — a spiritual home, of sorts. He lives in the exact iconic location pictured on the “The Freewheelin’ Bob Dylan” album, and, unseen but far more dangerous for Earle, is what the singer-songwriter describes as “the best guitar store in New York.”\n\nBut, no, Earle hasn’t lost his political edge, even on this much-happier album. In “Steve’s Hammer,” a song dedicated to folk icon Pete Seeger, Earle looks to a future when “ the air don’t choke you, and the ocean’s clean / And the kids don’t die for gasoline.”\n\nAnd in “City of Immigrants,” he takes on hot-button issues like legislating English as a national language and what he says is an inherent racism behind calls for rougher immigration policy. With lyrics like “River flows out and the sea rolls in /Washin’ away nearly all of my sins /Livin’ in a city of immigrants,” the song puts the Big Apple up-front as the living, breathing vision of the melting pot.\n\nNot that he cares all that much. “I don’t have to prove anything,” he says. “I don’t define myself as a political songwriter. I’ve written unapologetically political albums in the past. This time I’ve written an unapologetically personal album.”\n\nBut the thing that distinguishes “Washington Square Serenade” from other Earle albums, aside from its loving embrace of life and love itself, is the production, which includes beats and other hip-hop effects, laid down by producer — and former Dust Brother — John King, who has also produced the Beastie Boys and Beck.\n\nAbout half the songs on the album use hip-hop technology. The rest are straight folk. On the current tour, he’s performing solo, mostly — he’s using turntablist Neil McDonald producing the beats. About half the set is acoustic, and includes duets with Mooer.\n\nThe reaction has been pretty good — no Dylan-at-Newport-circa-1966 calls of apostasy or sell-out. But will the beats become a permanent part of Earle performances?\n\nHard to say.\n\nThe next album will be a collection of tunes by the influential, and difficult-to-characterize, singer-songwriter Townes Van Zant, “which I think I can handle myself,” says Earl. He will follow that up with a new band album, so the beats will probably not make it there either.\n\nAfter that? “Who knows?” says Earle. “Me trying to predict what is going to happen more than two albums out is ludicrous.”\n\nAmesbury News"
