        "text": "Monday 15th December – Photo shoot for DigiPack\n\nOn monday I shot photos of my artist for the album cover. We tried to take photos that reinforce his down to earth image and reflect that his an ordinary guy, therefore I asked him to smile, make funny faces and different facial expressions. I took medium shot photos, similar to Olly Murs’s album photo that I researched.\n\nWednesday 17th December – Photoshopping images for the Album cover\n\nI chose a few images that I liked from the photo shoot and photoshopped them. Firstly I had to cut out the images by extracting them Filter > Extract… then there I had to outline parts of the image which I wanted to cut out of its background with a green brush.\n\nI had to cut out the images because the background was plain white, however for the album photo I would like a bolder more vibrant colour, because it matches the fun and quirky image of the artist.\n\nThese albums are from the pop and folk genre as my track has a hybrid genre, pop/folk. The most noticeable thing on these digipacks that the artists are placed on the front of the album and they doing something that supports their image, in this case being quirky, down to earth and funny. I definitely would like to include this convention, that the artist is on the front of the cover in a position that represents his image, which makes the album look quirky and fun, which suggests to the consumer that it s a positive and upbeat album. The title and the artist’s name is included on the front as well, with colours that clash from the background so they stand out. On the back cover of the digipack is usually simple, with the song list and maybe with with a small image.\n\nThe CDs c over is also very simple with the title and the artist’s name on the left or on the top. Another similarity between these that I will want to include in my digipack is the bright and bold colours, which makes the album look positive and fun, the fonts vary on these digipacks, but in my opinion the handwritten font reflects this this fun, quirky, “down to earth guy” image the most.\n\nOverall, pop and folk digipacks have quite simple looks, bright and bold colours, artist’s photo on the front, the title and the artist’s name is included on the front too, the back is simple with the song list and maybe a small image.\n\nThis album is from Olly Murs its called “Right Place Right Time”, this gave me the main idea of how my digipack is going to look like. The targeted audience is around 17-25, who enjoys pop upbeat music.\n\nRepresentation\n\nThe representation of Olly Murs on this album is quirky and funny guy, this inferred from the albums different versions for example on the special edition Olly is making a quite playful expression, by pulling up one eyebrow, looking away and holding up a sign with the album’s name on it. On the other cover with the purple background he is also in a funny position while he points at his album’s name. These support his representation of being a fun, quirky, down to earth guy, similar to the representation that my artist is going for. Even though Olly Murs is only a pop artist the outfit that he is wearing gives him folkish representation, with the denim shirt, the white shirt with the trouser braces, and the denim vest on the covers, also on the images below he has a beard which is also typical in the folk genre.\n\nIconography\n\nThere is a sense of childishness, because of the funny faces, quirkiness and also because of the font that seems like its hand written all over the album. This makes the album seem playful and fun.\n\nFront Cover\n\nPhoto\n\nThe photo on the original front cover of the album is of Olly Murs making direct contact with the camera, he is wearing a white shirt with grey trouser and red trouser braces, which gives him a modern folk representation, the red trouser brace over the white shirt also matches the album’s red title over the white-blueish background.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe graphics on the background is the title of the album written all over the cover with white over the blueish background, this reinforces the childish, playful representation of the artist it also looks like its hand written.\n\nFont\n\nThe font looks like its handwritten which reinforces the childish representation, the title of the album and the name of the artist looks like its written with red paint.\n\nBack Cover\n\nGraphics\n\nOn the back cover of the album the graphics are same as the front, which is texts written all over the cover, however on the back cover the texts says the title of the songs inside the album not the title of the album like on the front page. Its looks like its painted with white over blueish background, which supports playful childish representation.\n\nFont\n\nLike the background’s texts these song titles also looks like they’re painted, however to stand out from the white and blue background, they’re painted with black.\n\nPromo Links\n\nThe representation of the artist, Olly Murs on this album appeals to audiences around 17-25, who like pop music and it also attracts pop/modern folk lovers as the outfit of the artist fits the conventions of modern folk genre, with the denim shirt, trouser brace and vest. Because of the childish, playful and quirky representation it attracts audiences that like positivity, good vibes, and down to earth artists.\n\nIdeas for my Digipack:\n\nPlayful, quirky representation of artist with funny facial expressions.\n\nHandwritten font, for childish, ‘down to earth guy’ representation.\n\nOutstanding colours over fainter background, in this case on the front cover the background was white and blue and the name of the artist and the title of the album was written with red.\n\nModern folk outfits, denims, trouser braces, vests.\n\nThis is Jeremy Fisher’s The Lemon Squeeze album. I chose this album because its really colourful and vibrant, which infers positivity. The target audience would be around 17-25 year old women, suggesting from the background, the font, and the 80s representation of the album.\n\nRepresentation\n\nVintage representa tion, he is dressed in 80s fashion with the marine blue suit and squared shirt, also his curly hairstyle and has an appropriate prop for this representation which is a Panasonic Slim Line Cassette Tape Recorder Player.\n\nThe outfit also matches the folk representation because of the squared shirt and the jeans.\n\nIconography\n\nThe iconography is 1980s. The outfit and the hairstyle has this 80s feels to it also the props like the Panasonic cassette player, and the lemon squeezer is quite 80s, the pink background colour also suggest the 80s.\n\nFront Cover\n\nPhoto\n\nThe photo on the front cover is of the artist, Jeremy Fisher with an 80s cassette player, in marine blue suit and squared shirt. He is looking up and he is stepping away, he looks little bit frightened, we don’t know what he’s looking at. In my opinion the whole front cover is playful, because of its vibrant colours and the 80s style. I really like the marine blue suit in contrast with the lemonade pink background. I also like the dark shadow on the bright lemonade pink background, which also goes over the texts which makes the photo seem like it has a depth as the texts in not just on the cover, but they are in it and part of the picture.\n\nFont\n\nOn the front cover “Jeremy Fisher” is written with white bold letters, the capital letters are italic. In my opinion this font looks like what you can find in women’s magazines like Cosmopolitan, which again infers that the intended audience is women around 17-25. I really like how the album’s title “The Lemon Squeeze” has the same colour as Jeremy’s suit marine blue.\n\nBack Cover\n\nPhoto\n\nThe back cover’s photo is of a pink lemonade squeezer, it has the same colour as the background, and on the the top of it there is a lemonade. Bright yellow liquid comes out of the lemon squeezer and it turns into an also bright yellow cassette.\n\nFont\n\nThe image of the real back cover is small therefore I can’t see what colour or font is used on it, but its not the same font as on the front cover.\n\nCD’s cover\n\nThe colour of the CD is marine blue as the artist’s suit and the letters on the front cover. The font on the CD is the same as on the front cover however both the title and the name of the artist is written with white as it stands out from the marine blue background.\n\nOverall, I chose this Digipack because I liked the 80s representation, and the bold and vibrant colours that look really good with each other, specifically, the lemonade pink with the marine blue, which I like the most, but I also like the back cover’s pink with the bright yellow lemonade and cassette.\n\nPromo Links\n\nThis representation attracts women around 17-25 who like upbeat pop/folk music, the representation supports the pop/folk conventions with the outfit and the colours. The vibrant and bold colours infer the upbeat music and the outfit, hairstyle and prop, suggest modern folk.\n\nIdeas for my Digipack:\n\nBold, vibrant colours, that look good in contrast with each other.\n\nShadow behind artist which runs over the texts making them look like they are in the picture not just laid over it.\n\nSome kind of prop that supports the iconography, in this case the 80s was supported with the Panasonic cassette player and the old fashioned lemonade squeezer with the yellow cassette.\n\nPlayful and positive feel to the album, which suggest upbeat modern pop/folk music.\n\nThis is Pharell Williams ‘Happy’ album. This album is really vibrant and fun. The targeted audience for this album would be around, 13-20. The whole album has a positive, summery (as summer suggest happiness, the yellow colours suggest sunshine and fun), and ‘happy’ feel to it, which appealing for an audience who likes upbeat pop music, that is why I think that the target audience would be teenagers and young adults. The album was also featured in a children’s film called Despicable Me 2, which also suggest that its intended for a younger age group.\n\nRepresentation\n\nThe album is quite simple however it still reflects the main song of the album ‘Happy’, on this album Pharrel Williams is represented as fun, quirky and childish which suggest happiness and positivity to his audience. He acts like a child as children are generally positive and genuinely happy about even the small things, this reflects the main song of the album.\n\nIconography\n\nThe iconography is childish, quirky and fun, which suggested from the positive and vibrant look of the whole album. Its also appealing for the audience as it suggest upbeat music and gives a sense of optimism.\n\nFront Cover\n\nPhoto\n\nOn the front cover is photo based, and we can see Pharell on it balancing on something which gives him a childish and quirky representation, his outfit is also quite laid back and simple, his white shirt with the blue half jeans infers that he is laid back and casual, the black bow tie also supports this image that he is fun, laid back and quirky, and the hat is his signature accessory.The bold yellow colour of the album makes this digipack vibrant and simple which matches the nature of Pop genre, as its positivity suggests that the songs inside this album is upbeat and ‘happy’.\n\nFont\n\nThe font of the album is also simple, all uppercase letters with bold black colour which says HAPPY. This bold black simple font is really nice in contrast with the bold yellow background. The uppercase letters and the bold black colour over the yellow background emphasises the word and makes it more noticeable.\n\nBack Cover\n\nFont\n\nThe back cover of this album is also really simple it, we can again see the simple, black font saying ‘HAPPY’ with all uppercase letters to emphasise it.\n\nOther texts are black with thin letters and wider spacing, also all uppercase.\n\nIdeas for my Digipack:\n\nBold colours, that give the sense of positivity.\n\nPhoto that supports the representation of my artist that was in the music video (quirky, quite childish, fun, down to earth and ordinary guy).\n\nOutfit on the artist that also support the representation of a ordinary, quirky guy."
