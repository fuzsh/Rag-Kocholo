        "text": "We all had our favorite Power Ranger back in the day. Whether you were rooting for the pink, green, red or yellow, you always wanted them to do good things and help those around them.\n\nThis is certainly not the case for Hector David Jr., an actor best known for his role as the green Power Ranger. He's got a warrant out for his arrest for assault on an elderly man.\n\nTMZ reports that Hector David Jr. is a suspect in a misdemeanor battery case and is wanted by police in Nampa, Idaho.\n\nNampa police are looking for the former green guy for allegedly shoving an elderly man down in a parking lot last weekend.\n\nIn hopes to accelerate the process of finding David Jr., Nampa police have released some video footage of the assault on their Facebook page.\n\nThe argument and subsequent assault happened over a parking spot. Police say David Jr. and the man he allegedly pushed down did not know each other, and no one was seriously injured.\n\nDavid Jr. is facing a misdemeanor assault charge once he is found. In Idaho, if convicted, this cime is punishable with up to three months in jail and a $1,000 fine.\n\nDavid Jr. played the green Power Ranger from 2011 to 2015 in different Power Rangers shows."
