        "text": "Carly Pearce wasn't in the mood to take any nonsense from an unruly concertgoer during her set at WE Fest on Friday night (Aug. 2). The country singer stopped her show to direct an uncharacteristically profane rant toward a male concertgoer that ended with him being escorted out of the venue at her insistence.\n\nPearce took the stage during the second of three nights of WE Fest 2024, which is taking place in Detroit Lakes, Minn., from Aug. 1-3. Stephen Wilson Jr., Lonestar and Trace Adkins had already performed before she came out at around 6:30, and Pearce ended up lighting into a man in the crowd who evidently shouted something rude to her while she was addressing the fans between songs.\n\nIt's unclear what he said from the fan-shot video below, but it was enough to really anger the normally amiable singer. She reacted by pointing toward him in the audience, addressing security by saying, \"Somebody get him out of here. I do not want him at my show. Get out of my show.\"\n\nPearce then took several steps in the man's direction and addressed him directly, still pointing him out as she said, \"If you're gonna be an a--hole, then you're gonna have to say it to me and get the f--k out of my show,\" a far cry from her usual demeanor.\n\nRELATED: Miranda Lambert Shuts Down Rowdy Fans Mid-Show\n\nThe audience cheered Pearce as she whirled and walked back to the mic, but she had one more choice message for the troublemaking fan, who appears to be getting escorted out of the venue in the clip.\n\n\"I do not have time for di--s,\" she says in a mic-drop moment, adding a sarcastic, \"See ya later!\" as he's being ejected to the obvious delight of the fans.\n\nParker McCollum took the stage after Pearce to headline the second night of the annual country music festival.\n\nWE Fest 2024 wraps on Saturday (Aug. 3) with sets from Tanner Adell, Jackson Dean, Paul Cauthen and Elle King before headliner Eric Church closes the night out."
