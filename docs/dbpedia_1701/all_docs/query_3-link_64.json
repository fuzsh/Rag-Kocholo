        "text": "This article originally ran in 2013, but we’re dusting it off for Lindsey Buckingham’s birthday on October 3rd.\n\nWelcome to Dissected, where we disassemble a band’s catalog, a director’s filmography, or some other critical pop-culture collection in the abstract. It’s exact science by way of a few beers. This time, we sort through the best and worst of the most fucked up rock ‘n’ roll marriage.\n\nOver the course of five decades, numerous lineup changes, and 17 studio releases, Fleetwood Mac has transformed from a British blues quartet of guitar prodigies into a truly “classic” band with more longevity than most could ever fathom having.\n\nAppealing to anyone from the Deadheads and cokeheads of the ‘70s and ‘80s, to 20-somethings in Urban Outfitters and dive bars, Fleetwood Mac has always culled from the experiences and emotions that no one else would consider withstanding long enough to take away something special. That is precisely the reason why this messy, emotional, fascinating group of individuals almost always arrives at a place that is greater than the sum of its parts\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom Mick and Stevie’s affair and Jeremy Spencer’s run-in with the Children of God, to “Fake Mac’s” first bogus tour, the revolving cast has always been dependable when it comes to incorporating drama into their personal lives, and subsequently, back into their music.\n\nIn honor of Fleetwood Mac’s enduring crystal vision, let’s take a moment to remember their music and everything in between with a complete ranked list of their albums.\n\n17. Penguin (1973)\n\nBand personnel: Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, Christine McVie, Bob Welch, Bob Weston, and Dave Walker\n\nAlbum ranking in terms of artwork: 12/17\n\nAlbum ranking in terms of BGV arrangements/usage: 13/17\n\nEssential tracks: Bob Welch’s “Night Watch” — the lyrics to this hazy song are descriptive and intriguing atop wistful chords. “I hope that in the desert there are ships and there is noise/ And above the greatest city there will shine a magic shadow and a voice.”\n\nPoint at which you realize this Fleetwood Mac is starting to sound like The Eagles: Midway through the chorus of “Night Watch” — In fact, for the next two albums, Fleetwood Mac will generally sound like a variation of The Doors, The Eagles, REO Speedwagon, ELO, and Pink Floyd. Although anything’s better than more Dave Walker.\n\nBaNd DrAmA: Dave Walker leaves Fleetwood Mac before they record their next album because his style and attitude “don’t fit in” with the rest of the band.\n\nNumber of songs that are ill-suited for this album: Two — “(I’m A) Road Runner” and “The Derelict,” both sung by Dave Walker. Walker’s vocal approach is almost identical to that of Billy Joel’s on the Storm Front album or the Oliver and Company soundtrack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNonessential tracks: “(I’m A) Road Runner” and “The Derelict”\n\nSong that demands to play in a slow-motion movie scene: “Bright Fire” is a gleaming example of Bob Welch’s ability to control song ambiance and vibe like Bob Ross controls a sunset on a canvas.\n\nHarbinger of Christine McVie’s imminent greatness: “Did You Ever Love Me” — a catchy number whose Motown slant adds some nice variety to the album.\n\nDepartures: Dave Walker\n\n16. Time (1995)\n\nBand personnel: Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, Christine McVie, Billy Burnette, Dave Mason, and Bekka Bramlett\n\nAlbum ranking in terms of artwork: 14/17\n\nAlbum ranking in terms of BGV arrangements/usage: 8/17\n\nAlso known as: The album Fleetwood Mac tried to record without Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks; one long grocery store soundtrack; a disappointment.\n\nBaNd DrAmA: By the end of the worldwide Time tour, Dave Mason, Bekka Bramlett, and Billy Burnette all leave the band. Nicks and Buckingham re-join in 1997 though, which is grounds for celebration. Christine McVie leaves the group permanently in 1998.\n\nCauses for concern: Any songs contributed by Billy “The Troublemaker” Burnette or Dave Mason; Lindsey and Stevie have been replaced by the guitarist from Traffic and Bekka Bramlett. (Bramlett is a fantastic, but ill-fitting vocalist.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEssential tracks: “Dreamin the Dream,” “Nights in Estoril,” “Winds of Change,” “I Do,” and “Nothing Without You”\n\nNonessential tracks: Plenty\n\nArtists ill-suited for being a Fleetwood Mac member at any point: Billy Burnett, Rick Vito, Dave Mason, Bekka Bramlett, and Dave Walker\n\nSongs best-suited for a made-for-TV movie about Plymouth Rock: “Winds of Change”; “Blow by Blow”\n\nSongs best-suited for a Kroger commercial: “Talkin’ to My Heart,” “Winds of Change,” “Blow by Blow”\n\nSongs best-suited for a ‘90s sitcom theme: “Hollywood” — think Captain & Tennille meets Caroline in the City, or any show featuring a frazzled-looking character that stops, smiles, and then looks comically “put out” while this song is playing through the credits. In fact, it seemed worth Googling whether or not Bekka Bramlett and Billy Burnett provided the vocals to the Step by Step theme song, but alas, it was Frederick and Teresa James.\n\nBilly Joel’s Storm Front revisited: “Blow by Blow”\n\nMost fitting song title: “These Strange Times” — the very strange spoken word closer on this album, written and performed by Mick Fleetwood. Much of the song features Mick crying out, “God is nowhere,” while the background vocalists softly chant, “Have faith,” or “I love you,” as the song fades out…\n\nSong title most likely to represent their feelings at the time: “These Strange Times”\n\nSong title most representative of my current feelings about this album: “These Strange Times”\n\nBut what I really want to know is: Why is Stevie Nicks so obsessed with the name Sara?\n\nDepartures: Christine McVie\n\n15. Future Games (1971)\n\nBand personnel: Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, Danny Kirwan, Bob Welch, and Christine McVie (officially made a full member)\n\nAlbum ranking in terms of artwork: 16\n\nAlbum ranking in terms of BGV arrangements/usage: 10/17\n\nSingle that failed as a single: “Sands of Time” — let’s just say this bizarre Kirwan tune is hard to sing along to… or remember how it goes…\n\nSong with most oft-repeated riff: “Lay It All Down” — some people may like hearing this rockin’ bass/guitar riff repeated 100 times in a row, and others will not. 1993 called and said it wants the Paul Shaffer cover of “Roll Over Beethoven” from Beethoven’s 2nd back.\n\nBaNd DrAmA: “The Mac” is in the midst of their “uncertain early ‘70s transitional period.” Translation: Four years of confusion, lineup changes, drama, and lack of direction. But after Spencer’s departure, the songwriting changes and become a little more melodic pop-driven, as well as emotional and unpredictable with Kirwan, McVie, and Bob Welch steering things.\n\nEssential tracks: “Show Me a Smile”; “Future Games” — Fleetwood Mac takes on a new smoother, more experimental sound with this track, similar to some late ’60s and early ‘70s rock bands like The Zombies, The Byrds and The Doors\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNonessential track: “What a Shame” — the hastily recorded jam per the request of the label to add an 8th song. Don’t waste your time.\n\nHarbinger of Christine McVie’s imminent greatness: Her performance of “Morning Rain” winds up coming off like a badass girl-fronted ‘70s group like The Shocking Blue or The Runaways.\n\n14. Mr. Wonderful (1968, UK)\n\nBand personnel: Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, Peter Green, Jeremy Spencer, and Christine Perfect (unofficially)\n\nAlbum ranking in terms of artwork: 17 — It’s hard to believe that any human being looks like Mick Fleetwood on this cover. The photo doesn’t look too touched up, but somehow, Fleetwood winds up looking like any combination of characters from Disney’s The Sword in the Stone or Pete’s Dragon.\n\nAlbum ranking in terms of BGV arrangements/usage: 17/17\n\nNumber of blues tracks based on the same four chords: 12\n\nNumber of cover songs: 3\n\nNumber of Elmore James covers: 2\n\nNumber of songs using Elmore James riffs as intros: 4 — “Dr. Brown,” “Dust My Broom,” “Need Your Love Tonight,” and “Coming Home”\n\nControversial song title that has chat rooms/online blues forums up in arms over its meaning: “Dust My Broom”\n\nCause for excitement: “Evenin’ Boogie” — This song has literally awoken me from a heavy siesta with its standout energy level before.\n\nBaNd DrAmA: Christine Perfect (soon to be Christine McVie) is brought away from her UK band, Chicken Shack, to play keys for the first time. She and bassist John McVie impulsively marry in August of 1968, thus officially introducing the first (of many) band romances and/or potential complications.\n\n13. Kiln House (1970)\n\nBand personnel: Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, Jeremy Spencer, Danny Kirwan, and Christine McVie (unofficially)\n\nAlbum ranking in terms of artwork: 7 — This cover art was illustrated by Christine McVie before she was even officially in the band.\n\nAlbum ranking in terms of BGV arrangements/usage: 14/17\n\nNumber of ‘50s doo-wop throwbacks: 4 — “This is the Rock,” “Blood on the Floor,” “Hi Ho Silver” (Fats Waller cover), and “Buddy’s Song.”\n\nCauses for excitement/concern: Christine McVie is brought on the road for this tour, beginning her permanent placement in Fleetwood Mac, and the phase where she and her husband are forced to be together 24/7 before the affairs start happening.\n\nBaNd DrAmA: Spencer confirms the onset of his schizophrenia in March of 1970 during this supporting tour, thanks to a bad batch of LSD (or he finally just found the tab that wrecked the camel’s brain). By the beginning of 1971 (on the same tour), Spencer permanently bails on his bandmates to join the “Children of God” religious group (now known as The Family International).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEssential tracks: “Jewel Eyed Judy” — written by Fleetwood, Kirwan, and John McVie as everything fundamental in Weezer, Wilco and The Beatles (especially the rocking four-minute coda of “Hey Jude”).\n\nSong that is far more interesting than its title: “Earl Gray” — one of Kirwan’s slow, wistful instrumental ballads with an unusual chord progression. It’s relaxing, although it’s hard to say how gratifying it would be if it weren’t surrounded by Spencer’s heap of doodoo-wop (shitwop).\n\nDepartures: Jeremy Spencer\n\n12. Peter Green’s Fleetwood Mac (1968)\n\nBand personnel: Mick Fleetwood, Peter Green, Jeremy Spencer, and John McVie\n\nAlbum ranking in terms of artwork: 15/17\n\nAlbum ranking in terms of BGV arrangements/usage: 16/17\n\nNumber of cover songs: 4\n\nNumber of Elmore James covers: 2\n\nBaNd DrAmA: Fleetwood Mac begins recording before they can lure John McVie into the band. When he finally agrees to join, Bob Brunning (featured on “Long Grey Mare”) is kicked to the curb and McVie takes charge of the ol’ boom stick for the rest of FM’s career.\n\nCause for excitement: Overnight success in the UK, and an upcoming hit with “Black Magic Woman” to keep things afloat.\n\nCause for concern: Fleetwood Mac is a blues-rock band in the midst of the late ‘60s British Blues Boom! They will play blues-rock for four more years.\n\nEssential tracks: “Long Grey Mare,” “Looking For Somebody,” and “I Loved Another Woman”\n\nHello: Harmonica solo on “Looking for Somebody”\n\nObscene lyric alert: “Loved the little girl so good/ she made my low down butter come.”\n\n11. Bare Trees (1972)\n\nBand Personnel: Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, Danny Kirwan, Bob Welch, and Christine McVie\n\nAlbum ranking in terms of artwork: 14\n\nAlbum ranking in terms of BGV arrangements/usage: 13/17\n\nNumber of “strictly scat” tracks: One — “Danny’s Chant” — written by Kirwan, for Kirwan, this little creation is no words, just scatting — nearly three-and-a-half minutes of kooky scatting.\n\nAdditional symbols of Kirwan’s wacky ways: The weird chord in the chorus of “Dust” that always manages to sneak up on you and change the entire feel of the song every time. It’s the one “imperfection” in an otherwise perfect song.\n\nBaNd DrAmA: Kirwan is fired (for attitude, health, and alcohol problems) during the supporting tour and replaced by Dave Weston.\n\nBest/worst rhyme: “Sentimental” with “gentle” on Bob Welch’s “Sentimental Lady.” Aside from the stupidity of the main lyric, it’s still a catchy song, and an album standout.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNumber of poetry readings: One — “Thoughts on a Grey Day” — a poem read by “Mrs. Scarrott” at the end of Bare Trees, which ties into the album nicely. If you can avoid picturing Mrs. Doubtfire doing the recitation, this reading is one to be appreciated.\n\nWhich came first: The “descending notes” riff repeatedly used in Kirwan’s “Sunny Side of Heaven” sounds awfully similar to the classically-inspired outro riff used in British prog-rockers Curved Air’s 1971 single, “It Happened Today.”\n\nDepartures: Danny Kirwan\n\n10. Heroes Are Hard To Find (1974)\n\nBand personnel: Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, Christine McVie, and Bob Welch\n\nAlbum ranking in terms of artwork: 10/17\n\nAlbum ranking in terms of BGV arrangements/usage: 9/17\n\nBaNd DrAmA: Bob Welch tires of legal struggles and leaves the band shortly after the tour is over.\n\nCauses for concern: The worst Fleetwood Mac song ever is on this album — “Silver Heels.” Even if you ignore the nonsensical melody and jazzy flute soloing, you’re still left with that godawful chorus where Bob Welch sings, “If I could sing like Paul McCartney, get funky like Etta James, I’d never change silver heeled ways.”\n\nI could’ve sworn: I heard Rodney from The Wulfe Brothers — (the cover band trio of brothers annually hired to perform at my rural Kentucky elementary school in the mid ‘90s) — singing, before I realized it was just Bob Welch up to his vocal tricks again on “Silver Heels.”\n\nEssential tracks: “She’s Changing Me” — its unusual chord changes and relaxed style pair nicely with lyrics like, “…’cause they call her the sweet Omega”; “Prove Your Love” — original, romantic, and catchy, the hook would be a perfect candidate for getting ripped off in a Gap commercial.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNonessential tracks: “Bad Loser” — Sounds like Bob somehow got to Christine and convinced her to write one of those mysterious “Witchy Woman” soundalikes.\n\nNumber of Sneaky Pete Kleinow solos: Two — The pedal steel player is featured on “Come a Little Bit Closer” and “She’s Changing Me”\n\nMisheard song titles: “Hair Gel” (from the song “Angel”)\n\nDepartures: Bob Welch"
