        "text": "Our Top 10 Weezer Album Covers list will look at a rock band that formed in the 90s. Their musical style is alternative rock, power pop, emo, as well as other musical styles. They achieved success right away when they released their Blue album in 1994. Blue and Pinkerton were considered two of the best albums in the 90s. Their single “Beverly Hills” was the band’s first single to top the modern rock charts and their first single to top the Hot 100. Weezer is one of the most popular groups from the post-grunge and alternative rock genre. Weezer isn’t your typical rock band. When they weren’t studying or watching TV, they were rehearsing in the garage. The band added humor to their music. Weezer has won awards throughout their career. The band has sold over 35 million albums worldwide.\n\nWeezer makes an impression with their music as well as their album covers. Their albums covers aren’t like other rock stars’ album covers.

White Album is Weezer’s 10th studio album. Lead singer Rivers Cuomo tackled new areas for this album. He wrote about gender dynamics, dating and religion. The music for the album is like their first two albums Blue and Pinkerton. The album was inspired by Rivers Cuomo hanging out at the beach in California.

Two of the members are wearing jackets while one is wearing a sweater. There is a coin collector on the left side of the cover. There are two people sitting on the beach together. You can see a shot of the ocean. It is a clear sky. The band’s name is written on top of the album cover in white letters.\n\nThe band wanted to use color schemes for some of their albums. This is one of the albums that use a color scheme. This is the “white” album. The cover has a white hue. Photographer Brendan Walter helped accomplish the goal that Weezer wanted for this album cover. He created a beach atmosphere. He took an inviting picture. It makes you want to be on the beach. Rivers Cuomo wanted the album to be reminiscent of the Beach Boys. He wanted people who didn’t live in the beach area to know what it feels like to spend time on the beach.\n\nBrendan Walter did an excellent job shooting this picture.

Black Album is Weezer’s 13th studio album. Rivers Cuomo wanted this album to be the opposite from the White Album. He wanted this album to be darker than the White Album. He was prepared to use profanity which was something he didn’t do on any of their other albums. He wanted the band to have a dark edge.

Raditude is Weezer’s seventh studio album. The title of the album was suggested to Rivers Cuomo by actor Rainn Wilson. Weezer worked with other artists for the album. They worked with Jermaine Dupri, Lil Wayne and members of the All-American Rejects. Weezer’s Brian Bell was hesitant about working with outside people. Rivers Cuomo convinced him to do the album. The album cover features a picture of a dog jumping in the air.\n\nThe dog is jumping in the living room. It is as if the dog was caught in midair. The curtains are open. You can see outside.

He thought the picture described how he felt when he performed live. It is a lively picture of the dog. If you are an animal lover, the picture will make you smile. The dog looks happy in the picture so you can’t help smiling at it.\n\nThis picture describes how we all feel when we are energetic and happy. Jason Neely had impeccable timing to get the picture of Sidney in the air the way he did. This looks like a complicated picture to get of the dog suspended in the air. Raditude was released in October 2009. The album peaked at number seven on Billboard 200 and seven on the rock charts.

The colors are vibrant and eye catching. This is completely opposite from the Black Album. The Black Album is dark while this one is bright. The covers are different, but similar at the same time.

They took pictures for the album cover, but they didn’t think it matched what the album sounded like. Sean Murphy was back to the drawing board. The band had fun at the photo shoot. They decided to go as their alter ego and take a weird picture.

This cover was a great way for the band to honor the fans and let them have control over the album.

The band is color coordinated with the illustration and the background of the cover. The band has stoic looks on their faces which coincide with some of the songs on the album.\n\nCarson Ellis did a great job with the illustration. It made the album cover stand out. It is something else to look at in addition to the band. It also adds light to dark clothes and background. Karl Koch is best known for working with Weezer.

Pinkerton is Weezer’s second studio album. This album had a darker sound than their debut album. Rivers Cuomo wrote about being lonely and the life of a rock star. Rivers Cuomo felt lonely because of what he was dealing with in his personal life. He felt limited by rock music. He started feeling emotion from opera and classical music. The album cover features a picture of a man with a cane. He is wearing a hat. He is wearing a blue coat. There is a horse in the picture. The man and horse are in the mountains at night. There is snow on the ground, cabin and trees. It is snowing in the picture. The band’s name and album title are on top of the album cover. The lettering is white.\n\nThe album cover was derived from the painting by Hiroshige called Kambara yoru no yuki which means Night snow at Kambara. This painting fits because it represents solitude. Rivers Cuomo felt isolated during the time they recorded the album. Rivers Cuomo had surgery on his leg which led him to walk around with a cane. This also fits with the painting since the man in the painting is walking with a cane.\n\nThe band honored the painting but it made it their own. We’re not sure why they chose this painting for the album cover, but it is calming and peaceful. This is another album cover that doesn’t feature a picture of the band. Pinkerton was released in September 1996. The album peaked at number 19 on Billboard 200. Pinkerton features the singles “El Scorcho,” “The Good Life” and “Pink Triangle.” The album sold over one million copies.\n\n# 2 – Green Album\n\nGreen Album is Weezer’s third studio album. Rivers Cuomo made this album simple. He avoided writing autobiographical songs. He didn’t want to write about what was going on in his life. This album cover features the band members.

Blue Album is Weezer’s debut studio album. They had trouble writing music for fans who preferred grunge music. The band wanted Ric Ocasek to produce this album because of his work with the Cars. He was able to get the band to make a brighter sound for the album. The album cover features the band standing in front of a blue background. Patrick Wilson is on the left.

The band’s name is written in the top right corner of the cover.\n\nThis is the first of the color scheme albums. This album cover was compared to the Feelies’ Crazy Rhythms. Each album covers have the same background. Each album covers have the same concept of the members being on the cover. Peter Gowland captured a realistic picture of the band. It looks like a picture you would take with your friends. He didn’t use imagery for the album cover. He just relied on the band. They are the stars of the picture. He used a pretty shade of blue for the background shot.\n\nMost of the band liked the album cover while Matt Sharp didn’t. He didn’t like the way his head looked in the picture. We’re not sure what he didn’t like about the album cover but it turned out fine. It was a great way to introduce fans to the band. Peter Gowland was a photographer who worked with Weezer, The Gaylords, Connie Russell, Linda Lawson, Sweathog, White Zombie, as well as others. Blue Album was released in May 1994.
