        "text": "The Los Angeles Fire Department's Command Teams are able to move anywhere in the city rapidly (and safely) via their mobile command post sedans. Major emergencies may require the use of the department's mobile command post rigs.\n\nDivision Commander Sedan\n\nThese are similar in terms of equipment and setup to Battalion Sedans. Traditionally, these sedans have been staffed by an Assistant Chief responsible for one of the city's fire protection divisions, and a \"command team\" Staff Assistant. Together, the command team is responsible for the administrative and fire/emergency suppression requirements of a large geographic region of the City of Los Angeles.\n\nWhen a fire requires multiple additional requests for resources, a Division Chief may head into any region of the City of Los Angeles to provide command and control supervision.\n\nBattalion Commander Sedan\n\nEach Battalion Chief in the LAFD is responsible for a group of fire stations in a geographic area, typically 20 - 30 square miles in size. There are between five and eight fire stations in a Battalion. The Battalion Chief is responsible for fire/emergency suppression/mitigation within his/her Battalion. A \"command team\" Staff Assistant supports the B/C with critical tracking and resource management functions at any emergency.\n\nCommand Apparatus\n\nThe apparatus is used for major incidents within the City of Los Angeles or on request at a unified command post when collaborating with other departments and agencies. The Command Trailers include a wide array of equipment used for planning, communications, and incident management. An Incident Commander (IC) will typically be the person managing a mobile facility such as this.\n\nThe core series of emergency resources for the LAFD involve fire and life safety rescue apparatus. When fire, earthquake, traffic accidents, or other emergencies occur, the Department's fire and rescue resources are called into action. The above image is of one of the Department's Urban Search & Rescue apparatus.\n\nLAFD Triple Combination Fire Engine\n\nLAFD Engine Company - all LAFD Engines are Triple Combination apparatus, meaning they can pump water, carry hose, and have a water tank. Commonly called, \"triples\" by firefighters, these powerful fire engines are the core of the city's fire defense system. LAFD engines are designed specifically for the diverse needs of the City of Los Angeles. They are housed in single engine fire stations, as well as at task force stations with companion truck companies. This example is a brand new 2010 KME, one of a series of new KME apparatus, designed and built exclusively for the LAFD. These KME triples are unlike any built for other agencies, including but not limited to the LAcFD. Special features include 4-wheel disc brakes, a brush box (for wildfire equipment) that is built in to the unit (rather than sitting on top, creating more drag and reducing fuel efficiency), and advanced lighting and monitor controls.\n\nLAFD Truck Company\n\nThe LAFD operates a number of Aerial Ladder Fire Engines - called \"Truck Companies\" in LA firefighter jargon. However, these powerful apparatus are rarely assigned to run on their own. Typically, a Truck Company runs with a single Engine in a configuration called a \"Light Force.\" Or, when running with two engines, the term \"Task Force\" is used. The Task Force concept was developed during the Watts Riots in 1965 as a way for firefighters to have flexibility in the jobs they performed. Today, the Task Force and Light Force concepts continue to have merit, but their role may evolve as the department continues to find new methods of operating efficiently and effectively.\n\nLAFD Task Force\n\nThe Task Force concept was developed during the Watts Riots in 1965. Essentially, a group of fire apparatus run together to incidents, thereby allowing the firefighters to be flexible relative to addressing the emergency they've been called to. When a Truck runs with one engine, it is referred to as a Light Force. A Light Force is used for a wide array of emergencies, ranging from structure fires to traffic accidents, to cardiac arrest (manpower is very important for heart-related emergencies). Firefighters rotate from position to position, so they are familiar with every \"spot\" on every rig and the related job descriptions and requirements. The role of the task force may evolve further, as the LAFD seeks to improve its ability to respond effectively to any type of incident.\n\nLAFD Urban Search and Rescue\n\nThis rig is commonly called a U-SAR which is short for Urban Search and Rescue. There are US&R rigs stationed strategically around the City of Los Angeles. These apparatus are critical assets during an earthquake, a train or aircraft accident, or in any situation where people may be trapped. Common uses are for rescue work in trench collapses and significant traffic accidents. A US&R is essentially a huge toolbox operated by \"US&R Certified\" firefighters. The US&R mission is in alignment with FEMA's rescue initiatives as well. Every week, firefighters examine and refit every single US&R in the city.\n\nHazMat Apparatus\n\nIn the event of a chemical or dangerous toxin emergencies, or a bomb threat, the LAFD will dispatch a HazMat apparatus. Strategically stationed around the City of Los Angeles, these specialized firefighting rigs are an essential component of every L.A. resident's safety.\n\nLAFD Heavy Rescue\n\nThe LAFD operates this specialized tow-truck as a \"Heavy Rescue\" out of Fire Station 56 in the LA community of Silverlake. This mammoth apparatus is useful in a wide variety of situations, including but not limited to righting overturned big rigs, pulling crushed vehicles apart, and lifting heavy objects. One of the things the firefighters who operate the Heavy-U (the rig used to be called a Heavy Utility), is their district. \"What's my first-in district?\" a firefighter from 56s asks. \"What is it?\" you reply. He smiles and says, \"the city.\"\n\nLAFD Airport Crash Rig\n\nThis is one of the very specialized apparatus stationed at airports in Los Angeles. Originally called \"Crash Rigs,\" these fire engines are specifically designed to quickly suppress fire in the event of an aircraft accident. These examples are stationed at FS114 at Van Nuys Airport. Today, fire suppression apparatus are referred to as ARFF rigs, or Aircraft Rescue Firefighting apparatus. Before any LAFD members can join an ARFF company, they must successfully complete training in ARFF practices that meet OSFM and National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 1003, Standard for Airport Fire Fighter Professional Qualifications.\n\nLAFD Fire Boat\n\nLAFD Fireboat #2 - the Warner L. Lawrence. Named for one of the department's most innovative officers, Fireboat #2 is one of the largest and most technologically advanced fireboats in the world. It is an omni-directional vessel driven by two Voith Schneider Propellers type 26 GII/165-AE 45. The Warner Lawrence has the capability to pump up to 38,000 US gallons per minute (2.397 m3/s) up to 400 feet (121.9 m) in the air. It's hull design is based on that of a tug boat, but there are very few tug boats in the world that can compete the Fireboat #2!\n\nSwift Water Rescue\n\nMore than just apparatus, the LAFD's Swift Water Rescue Team is a combination of firefighters with special training and their specialized gear. They are dispatched to floods, or situations where a person (or animal) is trapped in rushing water. Although the LA River that runs through Los Angeles is often just a trickle of water through a concrete culvert, it does occasionally fill with rapidly moving water and as such, presents a serious life hazard to people and pets. The Swift Water Rescue Team uses boats, floats and jet skis along with other gear to help rescue people and animals.\n\nLAFD Helicopter\n\nAir Operations - the LAFD operates a top-flight Air Operations Unit at Fire Station 114 adjacent to Van Nuys Airport. The flight line typically has seven helicopters ready for deployment as both air ambulance and fire attack resources. This is an example of one of the newer ships in the fleet - an AW139. Its Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6C-67C turbines, together with a state-of-the-art 5-bladed main rotor, deliver a high cruise speed even in demanding conditions at all weights. They deliver an outstanding power to weight ratio, which allows Category “A” performance capabilities with no limitations in a wide range of operating conditions including ‘hot and high’. Leading edge technology includes a Honeywell Primus Epic fully integrated avionics system, a 4-axis digital AFCS and large flat panel colour displays in the cockpit. As a result of the new design approach the AW139 uses fewer components, benefits from integrated avionics and provides easy accessibility to all systems for simplified maintenance tasks. The LAFD's examples are designed for both air ambulance and fire suppression roles. Note the 350 gallon water tank attached to the bottom of the airship.\n\nLAFD Foam Apparatus\n\nFoam Tender - this is one of the more unusual apparatus operated by the Los Angeles Fire Department. Using a specialized foam combined with water, this rig is extremely useful when suppressing fires that are resistant to traditional water-based operations.\n\nClass A foams were developed in mid 1980s and were used when suppressing wildfires. Class A foams lower the surface tension of the water which assists in the wetting and saturation of Class A fuels with water. This aids fire suppression and can prevent reignition. Favorable experiences led to its acceptance for fighting other types of fires, including those that occur in vehicles and structures.\n\nClass B foams are used for more dangerous fires, where the application of a Class A foam might trigger an unexpected result. Specifically, Class B foams are designed for flammable liquid fires, such as gasoline or jet fuel. Class A foams are not designed to contain the explosive vapors produced by flammable liquids. Class B foams have two major subtypes: Synthetic foams or Protein foams."
