She joined the fire service in 2007 and has since been involved in several rescue operations, including a fire in Mumbai’s Kamala Mills in 2017, where she helped save several lives.\n\nShubhangi Jagtap joined the Mumbai Fire Brigade in 2011 and was part of the team that rescued people during the 2017 Kamala Mills fire. In 2018, she was awarded the Chief Minister’s Award for Excellence in Public Administration for her outstanding work in the fire service.\n\nPriya Ravindran joined the Delhi Fire Service in 2013 and was the only female firefighter in her batch. She has been involved in several rescue operations, including the 2020 Delhi riots and the 2021 Uttarakhand floods.\n\nSushma Mane joined the Pune Fire Brigade in 2012 and has since been actively involved in fire safety education and training programs for women and children. She has also taken up leadership roles and has been instrumental in recruiting more women firefighters in Pune.\n\nPreeti Sharma joined the Jaipur Fire Brigade in 2016 and was the first woman firefighter in the city. She has been involved in several rescue operations, including a major fire at a garment factory in 2019, where she helped save several lives.\n\nTaniya Sanyal was raised in Kolkata and has become the inaugural female firefighter to be hired by the Airport Authority of India (AAI). Prior to 2018, AAI solely employed male firefighters, but this policy was modified the previous year, allowing Sanyal to become the leading female contender in a male-dominated profession. Additionally, she currently instructs a small number of women and men who wish to become AAI firefighters.\n\nIn light of last week’s International Women’s Day celebrations, it is critical to acknowledge and honor the achievements made by women in all professions, including firefighting. Women firefighters in India have broken barriers, overcome challenges, and made significant contributions to their profession and society. Their inclusion in firefighting has brought about positive changes and has paved the way for more women to enter this field. At Fire Prevention and Consultancy Services, we strongly believe in gender equality and the importance of promoting diversity in the workplace. By highlighting the achievements of women firefighters in India, we hope to inspire more women to pursue careers in firefighting and promote gender equality in the workplace. We hope that this blog post serves as a tribute to the women firefighters in India and their invaluable contributions to society."
