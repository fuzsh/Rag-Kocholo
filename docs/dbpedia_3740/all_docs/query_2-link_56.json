        "text": "EMS\n\nEmergency Medical Services, or EMS, is a vital public service that delivers emergency care to victims of sudden and serious illness or injury.\n\nIn the Vancouver area, EMS is delivered in a multi-tiered system by firefighter-EMTs and fire medics from the Vancouver Fire Department and paramedics from American Medical Response.\n\nIn Vancouver, and throughout the country, EMS calls typically comprise more than 80% of the total emergency calls received by public fire-rescue agencies.\n\nThe EMS system depends on the availability and coordination of many different elements, ranging from an informed public capable of recognizing medical emergencies to a network of metro area trauma centers capable of providing highly specialized care to the most seriously ill or injured.\n\nThe 911 emergency center, search and rescue teams from the VFD and public support for prehospital care are some of the critical elements necessary for the EMS system to work.\n\nThe Vancouver Fire Department’s Paramedic and EMT firefighters are an important part of the EMS system.\n\nAmbulance Services\n\nThe City of Vancouver has contracted directly with AMR to provide ambulance service to citizens since 2015.\n\nGoals and objectives\n\nMaintain or potentially improve emergency medical service.\n\nKeep patient charges as low as possible.\n\nAssure equitable distribution of costs and levels of service throughout the county.\n\nAssure highest accountability for results through direct oversight and governance relationship.\n\nBackground\n\nAmbulance services within the City of Vancouver used to be provided through an interlocal agreement with EMS District 2 originally signed in 1993. The service was user-fee supported and AMR was contracted to provide ambulance services.\n\nEMS District 2 encompasses the cities of Vancouver, Battle Ground, La Center, Woodland, and Ridgefield and the unincorporated areas of Clark County.\n\nIn 2015, the City of Vancouver began contracting directing with AMR to provide ambulance services to its citizens, instead of through the EMS District 2 interlocal agreement. This change was made for the following reasons:\n\nThe Board of Clark County Commissioners serves as the EMS District 2 Board and has sole final approval authority. The other partner agencies, Including the City of Vancouver, had no direct decision-making authority over the administration of the current EMS contract or the services provided.\n\nThe City of Vancouver has grown significantly over the 20 years that have passed since the EMS District 2 interlocal agreement was first signed. The city’s population generates 74 percent of the ambulance calls, and thus supplies a majority of EMS fees used to pay for the service.\n\nThe needs of City/urban and County/rural areas are different, and the city desires a more direct relationship with the ambulance service to better meet Its urban needs.\n\nThe Vancouver Fire Department (VFD) currently responds to medical calls. Due to the terms of the District’s contract, very little coordination was allowed to occur between the VFD EMS responders, and the ambulance provider, which resulted in duplication of effort.\n\nBy having direct oversight of the ambulance service, the Vancouver Fire Department will be able to develop the “hand in glove· relationship with the ambulance provider to better provide effective and efficient service to citizens.\n\nCurrent Status\n\nThe contract with AMR to provide ambulance services was approved by the Vancouver City Council in November 2014. The contract went into effect on Jan. 1, 2015.\n\nRead the 2022 Ambulance Services Annual Report to City Council\n\nSpecial Operations – HAZMAT Team\n\nThe Hazardous Materials Response Team began service in 1986. This highly-trained and skilled team is one of numerous local government hazmat teams located throughout Washington.\n\nWhat is a “hazardous material?”\n\nA hazardous material, by definition, is “any element, compound or substance that poses an unreasonable risk to health or property and which, because of handling, storage, processing or packaging, may have detrimental effects on emergency personnel, the public, equipment and/or the environment.”\n\nThe Hazmat team is deployed to hazardous materials emergencies throughout Clark County and when requested, to other neighboring jurisdictions.\n\nPersonnel\n\nThe Hazmat team is staffed by career firefighters. Firefighters are assigned voluntarily to the team for a minimum of five years. While on-duty, team members are evenly dispersed among three shifts. Team members are on-call during off-duty hours.\n\nTeam members prepare pre-emergency contingency plans that are based on hazard and risk assessments of known hazardous material bulk storage and use facilities within VFD’s response area. Team leaders also participate in regional and state contingency planning, which includes hazardous materials transported over Clark County railroads and highways.\n\nSpecial Operations – Marine Team\n\nYour browser does not support HTML5 video.\n\nVFD’s all-hazard quick response vessel, Discovery (Vancouver USA Fire Boat 1), provides rapid water response to fire, rescue and hazmat incidents occurring on or along the Columbia River between Lewiston and Astoria.\n\nThe rescue boat coordinates closely with other public safety marine units during emergency operations.\n\nDiscovery is staffed with well-trained firefighters who are qualified and approved to fill one or more of the following operational roles:\n\nWater-based rescue and medical calls\n\nFire suppression on boats, docks and on shore\n\nSearch and rescue\n\nChemical/fuel spill response\n\nSupport during natural disasters, earthquakes or other large-scale incidents\n\nSupport for Hazardous Materials and Technical Rescue response operations\n\nLaw enforcement support\n\nDive team support\n\nUsing smaller “fast attack” vessels instead of the larger traditional fireboats provides both tactical and economic advantages, providing a quicker and more nimble response to marine fires and other emergencies and costing far less to operate and maintain.\n\nSpecial Operations – Technical Rescue\n\nTechnical rescue is a special skills area of the fire service that focuses on the application of specific knowledge, skills, and equipment to safely resolve unique and/or complex rescue situations. Examples include rescues from confined spaces, trench collapse, water emergencies, structural collapse, and rescuing people trapped above or below grade or in other challenging situations.\n\nThe Vancouver Fire Department’s Technical Rescue Team is a group of personnel having advanced training and special equipment to safely and efficiently conduct technical rescue operations. The team works closely with the City’s Public Works Department.\n\nTechnical Rescue is akin to what Emergency Medical Service programs were to the 1970s, and Hazardous Materials programs were to the 1980s. It has gained prominence in our everyday lives with incidents such as Hurricane Andrew, the Northridge California Earthquake, and the Oklahoma City Bombing, where specialized rescue response is needed."
