It is a tough, demanding job and there is little time for traditional risk assessments about workplace hazards. Ability to adapt, improvise, and foresee fire progress are necessary skills for firefighters and fire officers. You will find Oregon OSHA’s requirements for firefighters in Division 2, Subdivision L: Oregon Rules for Fire Fighters [437-002-0182]."
