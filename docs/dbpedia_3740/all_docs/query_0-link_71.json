        "text": "The Limerick Fire Company was organized in 1921 and chartered as a volunteer fire company in 1927. The company was chartered to service Limerick Township, Montgomery County and is one of only two fire companies servicing in Limerick Township. It received an advanced ruling from the IRS as a 501(c)(3) organization in 1988. The fire company began with twenty-seven charter members. Today, membership exceeds 250 people with 40 active firefighters. In 1927, Limerick Township was a mostly rural, primarily agricultural, community. Today, the township is a major suburban hub with a mostly residential population of over 18,000 people in more than 7,000 households.\n\nThrough the years, the Limerick Fire Company – an all volunteer service – has kept pace with the changing needs of the area through facilities, equipment, volunteers and training. These changes have been significant. The Limerick Nuclear Power Plant necessitates on-going specialized training for nuclear incidents. The construction of the Route 422 by-pass necessitated the addition of vehicle rescue services. The fire company began providing this service in 1996. This major transportation artery also brought incredible population growth.\n\nThis growth is documented in the census as the population almost tripled from the 1990 census (6,600 residents) to the 2010 census (18,074 residents)! The fire company’s emergency response volume has increased exponentially since 1990 as well."
