        "text": "Firefighters serve the public. They keep people and property safe from fire. Firefighters respond to medical calls as well as fire calls. They help people learn about ways to prevent fires. Firefighters stay in shape, so they are fit enough to do their job. They follow orders, obey laws and risk their lives to do their jobs.\n\nBut did you know that within the firefighter community and job, there are a lot of roles that firefighters accomplish? Salt Lake City Fire impacts the city in many positive ways, some in ways not as well known. Weâ€™d like to introduce you to some of the positions staffed by capable and responsible firefighters within SLC Fire.\n\nFire Captain\n\nPublic Information Officer\n\nInspectors\n\nInspectors: Salt Lake City uses Fire Inspectors to visit buildings within the city to check to see that they are safe and are operating safely. If they identify a problem, the inspector works with the building owners to fix the problem to make it safe for everyone. Fire Inspectors are sometimes firefighters or sometimes they are civilians.\n\nInvestigators\n\nInvestigators: Salt Lake City uses Fire Investigators to determine the cause of fires that happen within the city. In Salt Lake City, our Fire Investigators also help other cities to determine causes of fires that happen within their cities. Fire Investigators are a special type of firefighter who has also received some police training. One special investigator is an arson dog. Fire Investigators help firefighters to be safe in unsafe situations.\n\nHeavy Rescue\n\nHeavy Rescue Technicians are firefighters who are trained to rescue people in special situations. Heavy rescue technicians learn how to rappel from buildings so they can rescue people from heights, but they also learn how to maneuver in tight or confined spaces, so they can perform rescues there too."
