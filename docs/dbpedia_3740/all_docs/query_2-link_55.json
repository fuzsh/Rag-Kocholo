        "text": "If you’re applying for a firefighter position, you’ll need to be aware of the core values of the Fire and Rescue Service in the UK.\n\nThese may be slightly differently worded from FRS to FRS – after all, every area’s recruitment process is slightly different. However, there is a Core Code of Ethics which was created to help every member of the UK Fire and Rescue Service to act in the right way.\n\nFirefighters make many challenging decisions every day as part of their job. The Core Code of Ethics is a clear set of principles for UK firefighters to base their behaviour on.\n\nThe Core Code was designed to help Firefighters serve their communities in the best way possible, and also to make FRSs even better places to work. It encourages people to display, and recognise, good behaviours, and to challenge conduct that goes against the Code.\n\nThe Five Ethical Principles\n\nThe Code sets out five ethical principles. These are the foundation for promoting good behaviour, and challenging inappropriate behaviour.\n\nThese ethical principles have been created specifically for UK Fire and Rescue Services, in a collaboration by the NFCC (National Fire Chiefs Council), the Local Government Association, and the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners.\n\nThese are:\n\nOther Important Core Values in the Fire and Rescue Service\n\nTeamwork is often mentioned within the core values of individual FRSs. It’s recognised as a universal quality, and an important value for both operational and non-operational staff. Effective inter-departmental communication and cooperation, as well as collaboration with other emergency services and agencies, helps the UK FRS to provide the best service possible to the public.\n\nA commitment to personal development is another important value expected of firefighters. This is related closely to accountability, and involves accepting responsibility for personal performance, having an open mind, considering constructive criticism thoughtfully, and consulting others when appropriate. It also means striving for excellence in whatever you do, be this training, career development or simply your day-to-day duties."
