While people will respond to others in need without the training, one goal of the CERT program is to help them do so effectively and efficiently without placing themselves in unnecessary danger. In the CERT training, citizens learn to:\n\nmanage utilities and put out small fires,\n\ntreat the three medical killers by opening airways,\n\ncontrolling bleeding, and treating for shock,\n\nprovide basic medical aid,\n\nsearch for and rescue victims safely,\n\norganize themselves and spontaneous volunteers to be effective,\n\nand collect disaster intelligence to support first responder efforts.\n\nCERT Training Form\n\nVolunteer Firefighter Opportunity\n\nThe Fire Department is accepting applications for Volunteer Firefighters.
