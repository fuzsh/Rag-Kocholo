The small class sizes that LSSU offers give me an optimal learning environment because I receive more personal interactions with professors and students that I wouldn’t receive at a large lecture hall. My peers have been extremely friendly with me and continue to challenge me to achieve my academic goals. As I move forward in my career, I desire to be a full-time firefighter and paramedic for a fire department. I also aspire to give back to the communities of people that have taken the time to help me achieve my dreams.”"
