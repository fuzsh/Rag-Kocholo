        "text": "Fire Fighter\n\nOn this page\n\nWhat should I know before reading about this occupation?\n\nWhat, briefly, does a fire fighter do?\n\nWhat are some health and safety hazards associated with being a fire fighter?\n\nAre there any long-term health effects of being a fire fighter?\n\nWhat are some general safe work practices to know?\n\nWhere can I get more information?\n\nWhat should I know before reading about this occupation?\n\nBack to top\n\nThis profile summarizes the common issues and duties for fire fighters. Fire fighters may be called to any number of settings or workplaces. It is impossible to predict all of the possible hazards a fire fighter may encounter. The demands of fire fighting can be sporadic and unpredictable with intermittent periods of intense physical and psychological stress. This summary focuses on the major job duties that most fire fighters (those fighting primarily structural fires) would have in common.\n\nWhat, briefly, does a fire fighter do?\n\nBack to top\n\nMain duties of a fire fighter include:\n\nRespond to fire alarms, incidents (automobile, industrial, aviation, etc.), building collapses, acts of nature (tornadoes, floods, etc.) and other emergencies.\n\nRescue victims.\n\nControl fire using various equipment and methods (axes, water, chemical extinguishers, ladders, vehicles, boats, etc.).\n\nProvide first aid.\n\nProvide safety education to the public.\n\nSpecialized teams may be organized to respond to emergencies involving specific hazardous products or situations.\n\nWhat are some health and safety hazards associated with being a fire fighter?\n\nBack to top\n\nWhile helping victims, there is possible exposure to contagious and infectious diseases including blood borne diseases such as AIDS, hepatitis B and C.\n\nExposure to various combustion products. The toxicity of the smoke depends greatly on the fuel (the materials or chemicals being burnt), the heat of the fire, and how much oxygen is available for combustion. Common combustion products include:\n\nfine particulate matter\n\ncarbon monoxide\n\ncarbon dioxide\n\nnitrogen oxides\n\nsulfur oxides\n\nvolatile organic compounds\n\nformaldehyde\n\nOxygen depletion - Hypoxia (the condition caused by little or no oxygen in the air) can result in a loss of physical performance, confusion, and inability to escape.\n\nExposure to other chemicals, products, pharmaceuticals and medicines, including opioids.\n\nWorking with compressed gases (e.g., self-contained breathing apparatus)\n\nSituations where physical demands involve very strenuous work, force, repetition, awkward postures and prolonged activities, often under extreme conditions, including:\n\noverexertion (reaching, carrying, etc.) and other risk factors for work-related musculoskeletal disorders .\n\nwalking or standing for long periods of time.\n\nlifting.\n\nWearing heavy equipment, self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), and personal protective equipment which may require more effort to perform the same tasks.\n\nHeat stress\n\nExcessive noise levels\n\nUltraviolet radiation\n\nExtreme temperatures (both cold and heat)\n\nExtreme working conditions\n\nDanger of driving at high speeds, often in difficult traffic or weather condition\n\nWhen responding to a fire emergency, there are many situations (e.g., the fire itself structures breaking, unstable floors and falling objects), where there is a risk of injury.\n\nFires can also create dangerous situations such as:\n\nSudden ignition of products creating flashover.\n\nBackdraft where air is introduced to an area that is superheated and oxygen starved.\n\nWorking on ladders\n\nFalls from heights\n\nSlips, trips and falls\n\nRisk of injury from the various locations where fire department may be called to: explosion, unstable structures and surfaces, falling objects; or working at heights or near traffic, water, confined spaces, large crowds, violent situations, etc.\n\nWorking with chainsaws or similar equipment\n\nExposure to serious traumatic events (or consequence of the event) resulting in stress or post-traumatic stress disorder\n\nWork shifts or extended work days\n\nFatigue\n\nWorkplace violence or harassment, and harassment from the public\n\nAre there any long-term health effects of being a fire fighter?\n\nBack to top\n\nThe International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has evaluated the carcinogenicity of occupational exposure of a firefighter as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1) based on sufficient evidence for cancer in humans. IARC concluded that there was:\n\nsufficient evidence for the following cancer types: mesothelioma and bladder cancer.\n\nlimited evidence for the following cancer types: colon cancer, prostate cancer, testicular cancer, melanoma of the skin, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma\n\nFire fighters also develop:\n\nback injuries and other strains.\n\ndiseases such as AIDS and hepatitis.\n\ncardiovascular disease due to a multitude of toxic substances when fighting a fire. For example, carbon monoxide exposure is directly linked with cardiac toxicity.\n\nWhat are some general safe work practices to know?\n\nBack to top\n\nFire fighters will need to know:\n\nthe correct routine practices procedures to prevent blood borne pathogen infection. (e.g., AIDS, hepatitis B and C).\n\nhand washing and routine practices\n\nproper selection, use, maintenance and storage of personal protective equipment (PPE), where appropriate.\n\nselection of footwear.\n\nprevention of needlestick injuries.\n\nmanual material handling (lifting) techniques.\n\ninformation about shiftwork.\n\nhow to work alone (general information) and working alone with patients.\n\nworking safely on ladders.\n\nhow to work safety with compressed gases.\n\nAll workers should:\n\nfollow company safety rules.\n\nknow about WHMIS and SDSs.\n\nknow your hazard reporting procedures.\n\nfollow good housekeeping procedures.\n\nWhere can I get more information?\n\nBack to top\n\nBecause of the wide variety of situations where a fire fighter may work, and the vast range of activities done and materials encountered, all situations cannot be covered in this document.\n\nNOTE: If you have health concerns, ask your doctor or medical professional for advice.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns about your specific workplace, you can ask one or more of the following for help:\n\nyour health and safety committee or representative.\n\nyour union.\n\nyour safety department.\n\nyour supervisor or manager.\n\ncheck with your local library.\n\nyour local government department responsible for health and safety.\n\nGeneral information is available in OSH Answers or through the CCOHS person-to-person Inquiries Service.\n\nFact sheet last revised: 2022-09-29"
