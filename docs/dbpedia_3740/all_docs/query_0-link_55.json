        "text": "Contra Costa County Fire -\n\nStation #1\n\n1330 CIVIC DRIVE, WALNUT CREEK, 94596\n\nThe history of fire protection in Walnut Creek, is a long and storied one, and Station #1 has been a part of it since the Central Fire Protection District was formed in 1923. The original station was located on Bonanza Street, between Locust and Main Street, housed an American LaFrance engine, and with mostly volunteer firefighters, covered the incorporated City of Walnut Creek, and about 32 square miles of surrounding land, including unincorporated Pleasant Hill.\n\nIn 1964 the Central Fire Protection District merged with the Mt. Diablo Fire Protection District to form the Contra Costa County Consolidated Fire Protection District, and a new station was built at 1330 N. Civic Drive. Being centrally located, Station 1 responds to over 2500 emergencies annually, and until January of 2011, this âdowntownâ station was staffed with six personnel, one engine company and one truck company. Currently, Station 1 is staffed with 5 personnel, with one three-person company on a new aerial ladder truck or \"tiller,\" and a 2 person medical squad which responds to medical calls primarily in the City of Walnut Creek.\n\nContra Costa County Fire -\n\nStation #2\n\n2012 GEARY ROAD, PLEASANT HILL, 94523\n\nFire Station #2, in Pleasant Hill, was originally part of the Central Fire Protection District, which served the City of Walnut Creek and surrounding unincorporated areas. The Station was located on Oak Park Blvd. and the building is now occupied by the Diablo Light Opera Company.\n\nIn 1964 Central Fire merged with the Mt. Diablo Fire District to become Contra Costa County Consolidated Fire Protection District. That same year, the current Station #2 was built at 2012 Geary Road, in Pleasant Hill.\n\nLocated between the County Fire Districtâs Administration building and the Contra Costa Regional Fire Communications Center, Station #2 is affectionately known as âThe Deuce.\" Station #2 is home at any given time to three fire suppression personnel on three different shifts, including paramedics, and houses a 2010 Pierce, triple combination, Type I Fire Engine, and an HME Type III wildland fire engine.\n\nStation #2, now 47 years old, covers a diverse area of residential, commercial and wildland properties in Pleasant Hill, Walnut Creek and Lafayette.\n\nContra Costa County Fire -\n\nStation #3\n\n1520 ROSSMOOR PARKWAY, WALNUT CREEK, 94595\n\nFire Station #3 is located at 1520 Rossmoor Parkway in Walnut Creek and houses a Type 1 Fire Engine and a Type 3 wildland engine, staffed with a crew of 3 personnel that respond to emergent and non emergent service calls totaling over 2300 runs a year. The current fire house was opened in 1995. Prior to the Rossmoor Parkway location, Fire Station 3 was located at 2273 Whyte Park Ave. in Walnut Creek. The station has always carried the number 3 but started out as part of the Central Fire Protection District which merged with the Mt. Diablo Fire Protection District late in 1964 to form the Consolidated Fire District. Further mergers over the years lead to the formation of the Contra Costa County Fire Protection District in 1996 with a total of 30 station locations. Station 3 proudly serves the citizens of Walnut Creek as well as the cities that it shares borders with, Lafayette and Alamo. Seamless operation between the local fire stations assures the highest level of service is delivered, regardless of boundary lines.\n\nFire Station 3 is staffed 24 hours a day, year round and will continue to serve its citizens, providing the highest level of care possible.\n\nContra Costa County Fire -\n\nStation #4\n\n700 HAWTHORNE DRIVE, WALNUT CREEK, 94596\n\nStation #4 is located in the south end of Walnut Creek on the corner of Hawthorne Dr at Palmer Rd.

This fire station was formally known as the âMountain View Fire Districtâ; getting its name because of its geographical location which offers clear views of Mt. Diablo which is located about 10 miles to the southeast. When the station was built in the mid 1950âs, it was the only fire station in the Mountain View Fire District. Back in the early days, the stationâs sole responsibility was to serve only the unincorporated area of Martinez. However, it became part of the Contra Costa County Fire Protection District on December 1, 1966 at which time the station extended its response boundaries into other areas of Martinez.\n\nDue to the stationâs location near refineries and other heavy industrial plants, Station 12 was given the nick name âGround Zeroâ because the explosive potential associated with being located near the center of a catastrophic industrial event.\n\nContra Costa County Fire -\n\nStation #15\n\n3338 MT.

It was an all volunteer department and had one downtown station.

It's also the location of the best orange tree and lemon tree in the entire county!\n\nWhen the station was built in 1957 it was shared by the Antioch Fire Department and Antioch Police Department. The Antioch Police Station and Antioch City Jail was located next door. Parts of the current fire station was used by police personnel until Antioch built its new police station on 4th Street. The current fire station was also the location of the dispatch center for the Antioch Fire Department and later Riverview Fire Department, once the Antioch and Pittsburg Fire Departments were consolidated to create the Riverview Fire Department. The current station was also the location for the Antioch Fire Department's apparatus shop, and later served as the shop for the Riverview Fire Department. In 1995 Riverview consolidated with Contra Costa Fire, and the dispatch and shop facilities were moved to Pleasant Hill and Concord respectively.
