It serves more than 1,000,000 citizens and visitors and responded to 124,000 calls for service during the last fiscal year.\n\nThe mission of the Orange County Fire and Rescue Department is to provide fire suppression, emergency medical and community risk reduction services to ensure our community can enjoy a high quality life and property protection delivered with compassion and integrity.\n\nFIREFIGHTER RECRUIT HIRING PROGRAM\n\nProspective firefighter candidates are asked to submit an interest card to get in touch with recruiters who will provide the latest information on OCFRD’s ongoing hiring initiatives, including upcoming deadlines, job postings, qualifications and testing dates.\n\nReports\n\nAnnual Report\n\nFY2017-2018\n\nFY2015-2016\n\nFiscal Year Summaries\n\nFY2023 Summary\n\nFY2022 Summary\n\nFY2021 Summary\n\nFY2020 Summary\n\nFY2019 Summary\n\nFY2018 Summary\n\nFY2017 Summary\n\nFY2016 Summary\n\nFY2015 Summary\n\nFY2014 Summary\n\nFY2013 Summary\n\nOur responsibilities\n\nOrange County Fire Rescue's responsibilities include:\n\nFire Suppression\n\nEmergency Medical Services\n\nTechnical Rescue\n\nFire Code Enforcement and Permitting\n\nPublic Safety Outreach & Education\n\nPublic Notice of Grant\n\nThe Orange County Fire Rescue Department (OCFRD) is currently pursuing a funding opportunity through the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity (DEO). The DEO has designated a total of $475 million to be allocated through the Rebuild Florida Mitigation General Infrastructure Program. These funds have been provided through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Community Development Block Grant – Mitigation (CDBG-MIT) to areas impacted by presidentially declared disasters in 2016 and 2017 with the purpose of better protecting Florida from future disasters.\n\nOCFRD will apply for funding to construct a new fire station on Caneel Bay Blvd. near the intersection with Wyndham Lakes Blvd. This station will provide faster response times for the Boggy Creek area as new development continues. OCFRD owns a 2.4 acre parcel where the station would be constructed, and a station design has already been developed.\n\nOCFRD will receive public comments on this project from August 30 through September 13. To submit comments, please email FireRescue1@ocfl.net and include “CDBG Grant” in the subject line. Jacob Lujan, Compliance and Planning Administrator, will be the contact person for this process. Please note in your email if you wish to receive a copy of the proposed application."
