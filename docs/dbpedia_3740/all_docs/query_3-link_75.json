        "text": "1871\n\nThe U.S. Commission of Fish and Fisheries is created by Congress on February 9 and charged with studying and recommending solutions to the decline in food fishes and to promote fish culture. President Ulysses S. Grant appoints Spencer Fullerton Baird as the first commissioner. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will eventually be established from this origin.\n\nWithin the year, Baird establishes the commission’s headquarters at Woods Hole on Cape Cod, Massachusetts where he and his small staff began studies of striped bass, bluefish, and other sport and commercial fish species in the area. By the end of the year, Baird issues the first of a continuing series of Commissioner's reports, 255 pages relating to the country's fish resources.\n\n1872\n\nThe U.S. Commission of Fish and Fisheries begins fish culture development, leading to the creation of the National Fish Hatchery System. Today, the National Fish Hatchery System operates a network of 70 hatcheries, one historic hatchery, seven fish technology centers, and six fish health centers nationwide – all dedicated to improving, conserving, restoring, and enhancing fish and other aquatic resources.\n\n1885\n\nThe Division of Entomology Section of Economic Ornithology is established in the Department of Agriculture. With Clinton Hart Merriam appointed its first chief, much of the Division's early work focuses on studying the positive effects of birds in controlling agricultural pests and defining the geographic distribution of animals and plants throughout the country. The Division later expands and is renamed the Bureau of Biological Survey. The Bureau will be the “wildlife origin” of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in the next century.\n\n1886\n\nD.C. Booth Historic National Fish Hatchery is established in Spearfish, South Dakota. The hatchery is still in operation today and is now the home of the National Fish & Aquatic Conservation Archives, which houses 1.8 million archival records and 14,000 historic objects related to the history of the Service's fish and aquatic conservation efforts.\n\n1888\n\nNeosho National Fish Hatchery is established in Neosho Missouri. Today, Neosho is the oldest operating federal fish hatchery in the United States and one of 17 national fish hatcheries that are more than 100 years old. Neosho continues to play a key role in the restoration efforts of endangered aquatic species such as paddlefish, lake sturgeon, Topeka shiners, and pallid sturgeon.\n\n1900\n\nThe Lacey Act becomes the first Federal law protecting wildlife, prohibiting the interstate shipment of illegally taken game and importation of injurious species.\n\n1903\n\nThe first Federal Bird Reservation is established by President Theodore Roosevelt on Pelican Island, Florida (on ancestral lands of the Miccosukee Tribe) and placed under the jurisdiction of the Biological Survey. It is the first unit of what would become the National Wildlife Refuge System and the first of 53 wildlife sanctuaries Roosevelt would establish as president. From this origin, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services today manages 570 refuges and 38 wetland management districts on more than 150 million acres across the country.\n\n1907\n\nThe New York Zoological Society ships 15 bison to live in the wild at Wichita Forest Reserve and Game Preserve in Oklahoma. The preserve, home of the Wichita people and later the Kiowa and Comanche tribes, is a precursor to present-day Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge. The transfer of bison becomes an important milestone in the nation’s efforts to save animals from extinction.\n\n1913The Federal Migratory Bird Law (Weeks-McLean Law) becomes effective, prohibiting spring hunting and marketing of migratory birds and the importation of wild bird feathers for women’s fashion. It also gives the Secretary of Agriculture the power to set hunting seasons nationwide.1918The Migratory Bird Treaty Act is passed by Congress (replacing Weeks-McLean), implementing the Convention Between the United States and Great Britain (for Canada) for the Protection of Migratory Birds. The Act, a landmark in wildlife legislation, provides for the regulation of migratory bird hunting and it prohibits the take (including killing, capturing, selling, trading and transport) of protected migratory bird species without prior authorization by the Fish and Wildlife Service. The treaty has since been expanded to include Mexico, Japan and Russia.1929The Migratory Bird Conservation Act is passed, creating the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission to oversee acquisition of lands. The act states that refuges are to be managed as “inviolate” sanctuaries for migratory birds.\n\n1933\n\nAldo Leopold writes Game Management, considered the “cornerstone” of conservation that creates the discipline of wildlife management.\n\n1933 to 1941\n\nWith the cooperation of Congress, President Franklin D. Roosevelt establishes the Civilian Conservation Corps by executive order. Over the next eight years, amid the Great Depression and a drought that turned much of nation’s midsection into the Dust Bowl, thousands of CCC and Works Progress Administration workers improve habitat and build infrastructure at more than 50 national wildlife refuges. The workers included segregated African Americans and indigenous people.\n\n1934\n\nThe original Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act authorizes the Secretaries of Agriculture and Commerce to “provide assistance to and cooperate with Federal and State agencies” on issues involving the protection and production of fish and wildlife.\n\nThe Migratory Bird Hunting Stamp Act, popularly known as the \"Duck Stamp Act,\" is passed by Congress. The Act requires the purchase of a stamp.\n\nJay Norwood \"Ding\" Darling is appointed Chief of the Bureau of Biological Survey. Darling's brief 18-month tenure results in a new ambitious course for the agency to acquire and protect vital wetlands and other habitat throughout the country. Darling introduces and draws the first Duck Stamp and creates the blue goose symbol for the National Wildlife Refuge System.\n\nDivision of Game Management is created in the Bureau of Biological Survey for wildlife law enforcement.\n\n1935\n\nThe Federal Power Act is enacted and requires the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to accept the Bureau of Fisheries’ prescriptions for .\n\nThe Lacey Act is amended to prohibit foreign commerce in illegally taken wildlife.\n\n1936\n\nRachel Carson is hired as a marine biologist by Bureau of Fisheries, rises to become chief editor of publications for USFWS and writes groundbreaking work “Silent Spring” in 1962.\n\n1937\n\nThe Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration (Pittman-Robertson) Act is passed by Congress to provide funding through excise taxes on firearms and ammunition to States to help restore and manage wild birds and mammals and their habitat and to educate hunters in safe, ethical hunting practices.\n\n1939\n\nThe Bureaus of Fisheries and Biological Survey are moved to the Department of the Interior and the following year on June 30, 1940 are combined to create the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\n1970\n\nThe Bureau of Commercial Fisheries, an arm of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, is transferred to the Department of Commerce and renamed the National Marine Fisheries Service.\n\nThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service establishes the National Eagle Repository based in Pocatello, Idaho to receive, store, and distribute parts from bald and golden eagles that have been found dead to Native Americans enrolled in federally recognized tribes for use in religious and cultural ceremonies.\n\nSince 1995, the National Eagle Repository and National Wildlife Property Repository have been located at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge outside of Denver, Colorado.\n\n1972\n\nAmerica’s first urban refuge established at John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge at Tinicum in Philadelphia.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency bans the use of DDT in the U.S. because of its potential danger to both people and to wildlife, including the bald eagle, peregrine falcon, and brown pelican.\n\nThe Marine Mammal Protection Act is enacted, prohibiting the take (i.e., hunting, killing, capture, and /or harassment) of marine mammals, and enacting a moratorium on the import, export, and sale of marine mammal parts and products.\n\n1973\n\nThe Endangered Species Act is passed by Congress and signed by President Richard Nixon to protect endangered plants and animals. Building on legislation passed in 1966 and 1969, the new law expands and strengthens efforts to protect species domestically and internationally. The Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service assume responsibility for administering the Act.\n\n1975\n\nThe Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) becomes effective with 80 countries participating. Currently, 183 nations participate in CITES.\n\n1977\n\nThe first plant species are listed as endangered—the San Clemente Island Indian paintbrush, San Clemente Island larkspur, San Clemente Island broom, and San Clemente Island bush-mallow.\n\n1978\n\nThe Service Fire Management program is formally established with a new Fire Management Branch at the Boise Interagency Fire Center (now known as the National Agency Fire Center) in Boise, Idaho, along with the headquarters of other federal agency fire programs. The Service adopts interagency standards for fire operations and qualifications. By the 1980s, the Service offers field training in basic fire suppression, fire behavior, and prescribed burning. Today, the program’s safety record is exemplary.\n\n1980\n\nPassage of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, signed by President Jimmy Carter, dramatically expands the size of the National Wildlife Refuge System, adding nine new refuges, expanding seven existing refuges, adding more than 53 million acres of land, and designating numerous wilderness areas.\n\nThe Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act is enacted protecting non-game species.\n\n1984\n\nCongress passes the Wallop-Breaux Amendments to the Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Act of 1950 (Dingell-Johnson), which combines and expands funding for sport fish restoration and boating safety programs. It established the Aquatic Resources Trust Fund that receives revenues from federal excise taxes levied on sport fishing equipment and estimated motorboat fuel sales, and import duties on fishing equipment, pleasure boats and yachts.\n\n1986\n\nThe North American Waterfowl Management Plan is signed by the U.S. and Canada recognizing the importance of waterfowl and wetlands to North Americans and the need for international cooperation to restore waterfowl populations through habitat protection, restoration, and enhancement. With its update in 1994, Mexico became a signatory to the Plan.\n\n1987\n\nAmerican alligators are determined to have recovered as a species and are removed from the endangered species list.\n\n1989\n\nCongress passes the North American Wetlands Conservation Act, in part, to support activities under the North American Waterfowl Management Plan.\n\nThe National Fish and Wildlife Forensics Laboratory is dedicated in Ashland, Oregon, providing expertise to assist in investigations ranging from species identification to technical assistance such as surveillance and photography. It is the only lab in the world dedicated to crimes against wildlife."
