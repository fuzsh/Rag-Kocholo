        "text": "Department History\n\nPaso Robles Fire and Emergency Services (PRFES) has existed since the early 1890’s as a volunteer fire department. In the early 1990’s the department transitioned to a combination fire department, employing both volunteer and career firefighters. In 2003, the department transitioned to a full-time career department.\n\nPRFES service area includes 19.9 square miles, and we also provide automatic and mutual aid to other fire agencies within San Luis Obispo County. PRFES provides a variety of response services, including structural and wildland fire suppression, advanced life support paramedic level emergency medical care, and entrapment extrication. PRFES provides technical rescue services including high-angle, trench, swift-water, and confined space. Finally, PRFES provides fully capable hazardous materials emergency response in conjunction with the San Luis Obispo County Regional Hazardous Materials Team.\n\n9-1-1 calls are answered by the Paso Robles Police Department as the public safety answering point. Requests for ambulance services are transferred to the San Luis Obispo County Sherriff’s Office (MEDCOM), a multi-agency public safety dispatch center.\n\nThere are 37 full-time personnel involved in delivering services to the jurisdiction. Administration staff consists of the Fire Chief and Administrative Assistant. The Community Risk Reduction Division includes one Fire Marshal and one Fire Prevention Specialist. The Operations Division consists of three Battalion Chiefs and 30 Firefighters.\n\nStaffing coverage for emergency response is through the use of career firefighters on a 48-hour shift. For immediate response, no less than three paramedic fire engines are staffed, and nine firefighters are on-duty at all times. Currently, emergency resources respond out of two fire stations with a third fire station expected to be constructed by early 2022.\n\nThe total fire department general fund budget for FY 2021/2022 is $8.0 million. The fire department’s operating funds are supplemented primarily from sales taxes, Measure J-20, transient occupancy tax (TOT) and property taxes. The fire department also receives funds from service and permit fees."
