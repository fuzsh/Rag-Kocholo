        "text": "The Day-to-Day Life & Responsibilities of a Fire Marshal\n\nIn the world of fire prevention, there are so many paths to take. Becoming a firefighter is a great way to help enforce fire safety, but it isn’t the only position out there. How else can you help to enforce fire codes, work with fire departments, and help your local community? One way to do that is by becoming a state fire marshal. We’ve all heard of fire marshals and the fire marshal office, but not everyone knows what it actually means to be one. If you’re thinking about ways to help mitigate fire incidents in your state or county, let’s talk about the responsibilities of the Fire Marshal.\n\nWhat is a Fire Marshal?\n\nWhether you are closely in tune with the fire protection world or this is the first time you’ve thought about it, you know what a firefighter does. But what about all of the other ways that a person can be involved in their local fire department and local fire prevention services?\n\nA fire marshal is another one of these figures in local fire department communities. A fire marshal is often an employee of the local government in some capacity. This could mean that they are part of the state, county, or provincial government, but this is not always true.\n\nA fire marshal could possibly be an active-duty law enforcement officer and, oftentimes, experienced firefighters. A fire marshal may be authorized to carry a weapon, they may wear a badge or drive marked car\n\nTruthfully, a fire marshal may be many things. It is largely dependent on their prior experience and the region where they work. However diverse they may be, there is an International Fire Marshal Association (IFMA) which seeks to link these individuals and pool they’re resources and collective knowledge.\n\nA Fire Marshal’s Responsibilities\n\nThe definition of what a fire marshal specifically is can vary. We can get a better idea of what the job is when we look at a fire marshal’s responsibilities. So what exactly are those responsibilities? Again, this may vary, but here are some of the many things a fire marshal is responsible for.\n\nThe Most General Fire Marshal Responsibilities\n\nIn the most basic sense, we might think of a fire marshal as being a cross between law enforcement and fire protection. One of the main responsibilities of a fire marshal is to perform fire and arson investigations.\n\nA fire marshal might also be a fire inspector, or they might work alongside one. A fire inspector is a person who makes sure that buildings follow relevant fire codes in case of an emergency. These buildings might be public ones like nursing homes or public education buildings, or they could be factories or office environments.\n\nAn inspector is responsible for making sure a building is prepared for an emergency situation. A fire marshal is responsible for finding out how and why things go wrong when they do. It is a very important part of the cycle of fire prevention and safety. The fire marshal’s investigations further inform builders, regulators, and occupants of how they can stay safer.\n\nMore Specific Fire Marshal Responsibilities\n\nFire marshals are authorized to do many different things depending on the local laws, and of course, according to their prior experience.\n\nFire marshals who are also employed in some capacity as a law enforcement officer may be able to make arrests pertaining to arson. These are the fire marshals we spoke of earlier who might wear a badge or carry a firearm.\n\nFire marshal responsibilities are clearly outlined by the Fire Protection and Prevention Act of 1974. This act sought to mitigate the tremendous amount of deaths caused by fires in America, citing 12,000 deaths and more than 300,000 injuries. Included in the Fire Protection and Prevention Act was the outlining of state officials who would oversee the dissemination of information and regulation of fire codes. This entity is what we now know as the fire marshal.\n\nBeing a fire marshal means being responsible for not only the safety of your community but the safety of your country’s citizens.\n\nHere are just some of the fire marshal responsibilities outlined in the Fire Protection and Prevention Act:\n\nThis training could include things like:\n\nCourses in fire prevention, structural building codes, and fire suppression techniques.\n\nCourses in operating alarm and reporting equipment\n\nAnd courses in forensic data recovery and burn patterns\n\nThere are plenty of opportunities for fire marshals to work with people in the field. However, much of the responsibilities of a fire marshal include reporting and legal work. Prospective fire marshals should be proficient in gathering and marking evidence, preparing testimony, and briefing the public on their findings.\n\nIf you do become a fire marshal, this will not be the end of your education. Your position as a fire marshal may be contingent on the continued education on the topic.\n\nWorking Your Way to Fire Marshal\n\nAs we stated previously, becoming a fire marshal is not an overnight process. It takes years of putting in work, training, and finding yourself in the right place at the right time. Of course, it’s impossible to know when and where that will be. The best way to ensure you know when and where these positions are open is to stay involved.\n\nWorking or volunteering with your local fire department will keep you in this loop of knowledge. The most important thing to do is to keep yourself ready. Stay up to date on the latest required training, continue to excel in your field, and continue to make connections in your local community. Some local fire departments even promote fire marshals directly from their own firefighters.\n\nThe Many Responsibilities in the Life of a Fire Marshal\n\nBecoming a fire marshal is a road that requires dedication and persistence, like all positions in the fire safety industry. Becoming a fire marshal means taking even more responsibility under your belt."
