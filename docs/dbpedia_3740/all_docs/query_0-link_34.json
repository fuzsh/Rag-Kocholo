During normal business hours this is where you can find the Fire Chief, the Fire Marshall, the Administrative Secretary, as well as the on duty Engine Company. The Engine Company is comprised of a Captain / Paramedic, 2 Engineer / Paramedics, and 1 Firefighter.\n\nIn November 2008 the City of Morro Bay completed construction of a new fire apparatus building that replaced the previous station which was damaged in the 2003 San Simeon Earthquake. This concluded phase one of a 2-phase replacement project. Construction of Phase II, which incorporates new offices, living quarters, and training room/secondary EOC, began in 2010."
