        "text": "1837: The City created the Fire Department as you know it now.\n\n1851: We installed the first public fire alarm system through telegraph and an office at Boston City Hall.\n\n1859: Steam engines replaced hand engines, and we began hiring permanent crew.\n\n1863: We started using adjustable fog nozzles.\n\n1871: We started using a new 11-inch fire hose. Chief John Damrell called it a success. 1872: The Great Boston Fire of 1872 destroyed 776 buildings, costing $75 million and killing 13 people. This led to the creation of a permanent board of fire commissioners.\n\n1873: The department got its first steam engine fireboat.\n\n1874: We elected a permanent district chief. Many of the department’s companies also got fully staffed with permanent firefighters.\n\n1875: We changed the locks on fire alarm boxes to stop false alarms, and created the first fire department repair shop. We installed dial lines so different parts of the department could communicate. The telephone was invented the following year.\n\n1876: The department started using the aerial ladder. All fire engines were equipped with relief valves and shutoff nozzles.\n\n1877: We replaced regular ladders with new Bangor extension ladders.\n\n1881: The department installed sliding poles in the firehouses, and added bunks to several stations for faster response times.\n\n1882: Firehouses began using electric gongs for alarms. We also installed private fire alarm boxes in schools, stores, and other public buildings.\n\n1883: First aid kits were given to all fire companies.\n\n1889: The Thanksgiving Day fire set off eight alarms. Outside help rushed to the scene and two firemen were killed in the fire. Their widows received $300 pensions.\n\n1895: The board of commissioners was replaced with one Fire Commissioner after a Roxbury fire destroyed 216 buildings."
