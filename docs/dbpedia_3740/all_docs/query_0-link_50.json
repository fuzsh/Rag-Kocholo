        "text": "Mission\n\nThe mission of the Chowchilla Volunteer Fire Department is to protect the people and property of Chowchilla from fire danger, hazards, and hazardous conditions. Local volunteers donate their time to educate the citizens on the importance of fire safety. Our department takes a proactive approach to teaching fire prevention to help reduce the amount of reactive fire call volume. We visit local elementary schools and preschools on an annual basis to provide fire safety training to all students.\n\nDepartment Structure\n\nThe department has 25 active volunteer members with years of service ranging from one year to over 30 years. Currently, our department has an updated ISO rating of 4. Regular training meetings are held three times monthly, and special training sessions are scheduled throughout the year.\n\nISO Rating of 4 was updated effective April 1st, 2021. Owners should check with their insurance companies to make sure they get the most benefit from the adjusted rate.\n\nBefore You Burn\n\nUnderstand fireplace restrictions and view the Check Before You Burn page provided by the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District. Also, burning trash, including green waste, and even having a small outdoor fire are against the City Ordinance.\n\nVolunteer Firefighter\n\nIf you are interested in becoming a volunteer firefighter, applications are accepted when openings are available. If you are interested in volunteering and would like information, contact the Chowchilla Fire Department by calling 559.665.8626. Applications are currently being accepted; click Here Version OptionsFireHeadline Volunteer Firefighterfor the application.\n\nFunding\n\nThe Chowchilla Volunteer Fire Department is funded primarily through City general fund revenues. The department also relies on various grant funding sources and the generosity of local individuals and civic service clubs that donate to further the progress of the department.\n\nThrough funding from both the Assistance to Firefighters Grant and the Homeland Security Grant through the Stateâ€™s Office of Emergency Services, the Chowchilla Fire Department has been able to provide new turnout gear, portable radios, breathing apparatus, and wildland gear for the firefighters.\n\nThe Citizens of Chowchilla recently passed Measure N, which is a Public Safety Sales tax. The funds from this tax will be used to assist the Chowchilla Police Department as well as the Chowchilla Fire Department. The Public Safety Sales Tax will allow the CVFD to purchase specialized equipment and hire staff, among other things. The City has created two full-time paid positions for the department, which are a Battalion Chief and a Fire Inspector."
