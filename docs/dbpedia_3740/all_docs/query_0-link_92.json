        "text": "Welcome to the Carver Fire Department\n\nThe Carver Fire Department is located in Southeastern Massachusetts.\n\nWe proudly protect 11,368 people living in an area of 39.58 square miles. We operate out of three stations that protect a primarily residential/agricultural area. Our Department is an ISO 2/2Y-rated Public Department whose 85 members are on a paid on-call status.\n\nFire crews from Company 1 recently sharpened their MVA entrapment skills. Crews worked scenarios using Jaws of Life tools and specialized Rescue Jacks to free multiple simulated patients trapped in an MVA. Each crew of firefighters had to work as a team to prioritize each rescue. The second portion of the drill was a tour of an electric vehicle and training on recently purchased EV immobilizer tools. Once one of these new EV immobilizers is deployed, it prevents any electric vehicle from suddenly starting and moving forward during a rescue scenario. These new EV immobilizer tools are now in service on each Engine. The drill was well attended by our firefighters and coordinated by our Officers. Well done!

The second portion of the drill was a tour of two electric vehicles and training on recently purchased EV immobilizer tools. Once one of these new EV immobilizers is deployed, it prevents any electric vehicle from suddenly starting and moving forward during a rescue scenario. These new EV immobilizer tools are now in service on each Engine. The final portion of the drill was to learn and practice deploying our recently purchased ballistic PPE. The new ballistic PPE includes bulletproof vests, helmets, and eye protectors. The new equipment is now deployed on each Engine Company.
