        "text": "Chief Joseph Sanford\n\nFire Chief\n\n425-587-3650\n\nJSanford@kirklandwa.gov\n\nA Message from the Fire Chief\n\nWashington became a state in 1889. That same year, the Great Seattle Fire destroyed much of the heart of that city and the people of Kirkland watched as smoke rose across Lake Washington for days. One year later, in 1890, the Kirkland Fire Department was formed. The “Fire” Department has evolved since that time, keeping pace with the changing needs of our community. Since those austere beginnings, the department has added Hazardous Materials, Technical Rescue, Emergency Medical Services, Emergency Management and Water Rescue to our list of services. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) now constitute nearly 75% of our calls for service. The Fire Department is truly an “all hazards” response team.\n\nTogether with our teams in the Fire Prevention Bureau, the Training Division, Emergency Medical Services, Fire Administration, and the Office of Emergency Management, we make up what’s now the Kirkland Fire Department.\n\nThe consistent support from our community and City Council has ensured that the dedicated professionals of the Kirkland Fire Department can continue to provide exceptional service. Whether assigned to work in Suppression, Administrative Support, Emergency Medical Services, Training or the Bureau of Fire Prevention; on a fire truck or within the Office of Emergency Management, the dedicated men and women of the Kirkland Fire Department are committed to providing the best services possible, twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year.\n\nChief Joseph Sanford\n\nFrom its incorporation in 1905 with a population of 400, Kirkland has grown to a population of 92,175 and 18 square miles. The terrain varies from extended waterfront property and parks to wooded areas and steep hillsides with elevations ranging from sea level to 500 feet. The community is a balance of quiet residential neighborhoods, urban retail, commercial zones and industrial areas bordered by freeways and commerce lines.\n\nKirkland Fire Department employs approximately 109 employees who are involved in a diverse range of activities. The department provides 24-hour coverage for fire suppression, technical rescue, hazardous materials and emergency medical responses. The department also provides fire prevention and education, fire investigations, inspections, code compliance and disaster preparedness services to the population.\n\nThe City of Kirkland has six fire stations:\n\nStation 21- Forbes Creek\n\n9816 Forbes Creek Drive\n\nStation 22- Houghton\n\n6602 108th Ave NE\n\nStation 24- North Juanita\n\nNE 132nd St. and 100th Ave NE\n\nStation 25- Juanita\n\n12033 76th Place NE\n\nStation 26- North Rose Hill\n\n9930 124th Ave NE\n\nStation 27- Totem Lake\n\n12127 NE 132nd St.\n\nTo learn more about what we do please see our Emergency Response, Fire Prevention, and Emergency Management pages.\n\nDoes the Fire Department offer CPR training to the public?\n\nThe Kirkland Fire Department (KFD) is partnering with the Medic One Foundation (MOF) to provide free CPR classes beginning in February, 2024.\n\nTo learn when CPR classes are scheduled, visit our Public Education page or contact Sue Romero.\n\nDoes the Fire Department inspect or install car seats?\n\nThe Kirkland Fire Department does not inspect or install car seats. For assistance, please contact King County Public Health Traffic Safety.\n\nI live in the Kirkland city limits, can I burn my leaves and brush?\n\nOutdoor burning of leaves, yard waste or garbage is banned in Kirkland. For air quality questions, call the Puget Sound Air Pollution Control Agency at 206-343-8800. Also for air quality/indoor burning restrictions recording, 1-800-595-4341.\n\nHow can I arrange to have my children or school group visit a fire station?\n\nPlease click Request a station tour to be linked to the request form.\n\nDo you have a meeting room available to the public? How do I make reservations? What are the rules?\n\nDue to COVID-19 and the need to protect our first responders and the community station, meeting room use is suspended until further notice.\n\nCan I go on a ride-along with Kirkland Fire Department?\n\nPlease click Request a Ride-along to be linked to the request form.\n\nWhen should I call 9-1-1?\n\nResidents are encouraged to call 9-1-1 anytime there is immediate danger to life or property. Generally, life threatening illness or injuries, smoke or flames that are seen or smelled, and motor vehicle accidents are situations requiring calls to 9-1-1. The public should call 9-1-1 if in doubt of the severity of the situation.\n\nWhat should I tell the dispatcher when I call 9-1-1?\n\nThe 9-1-1 dispatcher will ask a number of questions when you call 9-1-1. Many times, people feel the questions are delaying notifying the Fire Department. While a caller is answering questions, another dispatcher is notifying the Fire Department of the emergency. The dispatcher will ask questions to confirm your location or address, the type of emergency, your name, and a contact number. Additional questions may be asked based on the emergency.\n\nWhere can I get more information about 9-1-1?\n\nYou can see our dispatch center's website FAQ here: https://www.norcom.org/about-us/911-faq/\n\nWhat questions will you be asked?\n\nLocation of where help is needed\n\nWhat is happening (used to determine if you need police, fire or medical help)\n\nTime delay (for example: did it occur 5 minutes ago or 1 week ago)\n\nAny weapons involved (if yes, we will ask what type and where they are located)\n\nDescriptions of vehicles and people involved\n\nThe phone number you are calling from\n\nYour name\n\nDuring COVID-19 we will also ask if you or anyone at the location has a fever, cough, or difficulty breathing\n\nWhat if you accidentally dial 9-1-1?\n\nDO NOT HANG UP! Even if you think you are able to disconnect quickly enough, you aren’t! Your call will still ring into the 9-1-1 center. Call-takers have to call back every hang-up 9-1-1 call. Making these callbacks take up time, causing extra workload and could delay our ability to answer other, emergency calls.\n\nIf you call 9-1-1 on accident, stay on the phone and let the dispatcher know it was an accident and there is no emergency.\n\nApproximately 32% of all 9-1-1 calls in Washington State are accidental. Click here to learn how you can help prevent accidental calls.\n\nFor medical help, we will ask these questions:\n\nWhat is the address/location of the patient\n\nIs the patient conscious (If the patient is conscious, we will ask to speak to the patient)\n\nIf the patient is not conscious, we will ask if the patient is breathing normally\n\nHow old is the patient\n\nWhat is the chief complaint/reason for calling 9-1-1\n\nOnce we identify the chief complaint, a specific list of questions are asked to gather further information for the medical responders\n\nThings to know:\n\nWe are here to help you – we ask questions that are necessary to determine the appropriate response to your needs.\n\nYou should dial 9-1-1 for the fastest response when police, fire, or medical assistance is needed.\n\nYou can legally call 9-1-1 if you are driving, but be careful!\n\nYou can send a text to 9-1-1 in King, Snohomish, Pierce, and other counties in the state of Washington. Because of the time it takes to text back and forth, we ask that you call 9-1-1 if you can, text if you cannot. Click here for further information.\n\nAll 9-1-1 centers have access to language line services for those who either do not speak English or feel more comfortable speaking another language. Let the dispatcher know which language you speak and they will connect you with an interpreter on the phone.\n\nYou might get transferred. The routing system is complex when calling from a cell phone. Stay on the line and we will ensure you get to the right people who can send help.\n\nTHINGS TO TRY IF YOUR CALL TO 9-1-1 ISN’T WORKING:\n\nTry calling from another phone that uses a different carrier or different technology.\n\nIf your wireline isn’t working, try using a cell phone and vice versa.\n\nIf your cell phone isn’t working and you don’t have a wireline, try another cell phone on a different network.\n\nTry calling the 10-digit emergency number for NORCOM at 425-577-5656.\n\nTry texting to 9-1-1 from a cell phone device."
