        "text": "Back to top\n\n100th Annual State Fire School\n\nBack to top\n\nMISSION\n\nOur mission is to establish credibility in providing quality education, training, certification, and professional consultation to Iowa’s fire service and other emergency responders in a manner that reflects commitment, integrity, and contributes to the reduction of morbidity, mortality, and property loss from fire and other hazards.\n\nBack to top\n\nGeneral Bureau Information\n\nThe Fire Service Training Bureau is designated by statute to be the State Fire Academy. We have been training Iowa’s firefighters and other emergency service responders since 1923. We are home to the second-longest continually running annual state fire school in the nation.\n\nThe Bureau coordinates and instructs many basic and advanced level courses at our facility and also locally across the state in the subject matter areas of firefighting, hazardous materials, vehicle extrication, technical rescue, instructor development, officer development, fire prevention, traffic incident management (TIMS), and fire investigation. We also offer multiple National Fire Academy direct-delivery courses annually.\n\nWe are accredited by the International Fire Service Accreditation Congress (IFSAC) and the National Board on Fire Service Professional Qualifications (ProBoard®) and are authorized to issue the following certifications following completion of the respective training class and both written and practical skills examinations: Firefighter I, Firefighter II, Hazardous Materials Awareness, Hazardous Materials Operations, Driver/Operator Pumper, Driver/Operator Aerial, Fire and Emergency Services Instructor I, Fire and Emergency Services Instructor II, Fire Officer I, Fire Officer II, Fire Inspector I, and Fire Investigator.\n\nIn addition to our facility having on-site training grounds to conduct live-fire training evolutions, we have multiple mobile training props that can be requested to be delivered for local community-based training.\n\nBack to top\n\nFSTB Location\n\nBack to top\n\nFSTB Bookstore\n\nCurrent list of Books & Editions used for Certification & TestingCertification levelBook/EditionPublisherFire Fighter I and IIEssentials of Fire Fighting, 7th EditionIFSTAHazmat Awareness/OperationsHazardous Materials: Awareness and Operations 4th EditionJones & BartlettDriver Operator Pumper and AerialPumping and Aerial Apparatus Driver/Operator Handbook, 3rd EditionIFSTAFire Officer I & IIFire Officer: Principles and Practice 4th EditionJones & BartlettInstructor I & IIFire and Emergency Services Instructor: Principles and Practice 3rd Edition Jones & BartlettInspector IFire Inspection and Code Enforcement, 8th EditionIFSTAwww.jblearning.comwww.ifsta.org\n\nCERTIFICATION EXAMS\n\nThe Accreditation/Certification Program is responsible for maintaining the Bureau’s accreditation status with the International Fire Service Accreditation Congress (IFSAC) and the National Board on Fire Service Professional Qualifications (ProBoard®) accreditation requirements. This program schedules both written and practical examinations across the state and issues multiple nationally accredited fire service certifications that assist in demonstrating a candidate’s minimum level of competency in a particular area of training and confirming their training conforms to recognized national standards.\n\n*Exam registrations will be closed approximately two weeks prior to the exam date or sooner if the location receives 24 registrations.\n\nWritten & Practical Skills Exams Schedule / Registration Form\n\nNEW CERTIFICATION POLICY & PROCEDURES MANUAL\n\nSpecific details on each certification level's requirements can be found in the below links to the Procedures Guides.\n\nThese guides also include the Local Documentation Forms which are required to complete the following levels:\n\nHazMat Awareness & Operations | Fire Fighter I & II | Driver/Operator Pumper & Aerial\n\nBack to top\n\nReciprocity Form\n\nReciprocity Request Form\n\nBack to top\n\nField Programs\n\nThe Field Programs Unit of the Fire Service Training Bureau delivers hundreds of courses to Iowa Fire Departments each year. Participants choose course topics ranging from basic fire fighting skills to advanced fire strategies and tactics. Only qualified instructors teach these programs to assure the fire service receives the best instruction available.\n\nTS 1 Payroll Form\n\nTS 1 Application Form\n\nBack to top\n\nCourse Delivery\n\nThe majority of courses can be delivered directly to the requesting fire departments and regional fire schools through Mobile Training Units.\n\nFSTB Scheduling Form\n\nCourse Evaluation Form\n\nBack to top\n\nHandling Liquified Propane Emergencies\n\nBack to top\n\nOther Trailers and Simulators\n\nThe FSTB also offers a Mobile Training Tower, Confined Space Trailer, Rapid Intervention Team Trailer, and a Mobile Roof/Vertical Ventilation Simulator.\n\nBack to top\n\nAdvanced Level Courses\n\nInstructor, Fire Officer, and Inspector\n\nThe Fire Service Training Bureau offers several advanced-level courses per year depending on requests by fire departments to host them. In the past, the Instructor, Fire Officer, and Inspector courses were funded through an NFA Grant, which allowed us to offer them free of charge. That grant is no longer available as a resource, so to offset the costs of these programs, we are asking that each participant be responsible for the cost of the manual.\n\nFor any questions about the courses, please contact Don Minks at minks@dps.state.ia.us or call 515.727.3424\n\nSpecial Programs Request Form\n\n*Access the links below to complete registration forms.\n\nNone scheduled at this time.\n\nBack to top\n\nTraffic Incident Management (TIM)\n\nPHONE: 515-727-3426\n\nThe FSTB is proud to sponsor Traffic Incident Management (TIM) training to bring fire, law enforcement, public works, and other roadway response partners together to understand each other’s role in a roadway emergency and to help keep said responders safe while performing their duties.\n\nTraffic crashes happen every day on Iowa roadways. The men and women who respond to these crashes put their lives on the line every time that call comes in.\n\nWhether you're a law enforcement officer, emergency medical technician, firefighter, tow truck operator, transportation worker, or any number of others who respond to crashes, making the crash scene safer and clearing the roadway as soon as possible is a priority to increase safety for all of us.\n\nTraffic Incident Management is a four-hour training program developed to coordinate better the efforts of multi-discipline responders to work traffic incidents cooperatively, efficiently, and safely, thereby improving safety for all responders and everyone else on the road.\n\nThe Iowa Traffic Incident Management program is presented with multiple instructors from different disciplines and is intended for anyone who responds to an incident scene. The clear message for the program is that we're all in this together. All disciplines are there for the same reason, and each has different priorities and objectives. When all disciplines have an understanding of each other's goals and priorities, it's easier for everyone to be more efficient in their roles. That translates into less time on the road in a dangerous environment.\n\nBack to top\n\nNational Fire Academy Courses\n\nNational Fire Academy two-day Direct Delivery courses and six-day Regional Delivery courses are also coordinated and provided through the Fire Service Training Bureau. The Fire Service Training Bureau schedules and facilitates these courses for the Iowa Fire Service. A portion of the course is usually held at the Annual State Fire School. Some are hosted as weekend activities at the Training Bureau, and some are offered to our Community College partners to be held in conjunction with their Regional Fire Schools, or as stand-alone activities.\n\nNFA Class Request Form\n\nGeneral Admissions Application\n\nInstructions for obtaining a FEMA Student Identification (SID) Number\n\n(The SID Number is required to register for all NFA Courses.)\n\nNFA (F0457) Decision Making for Initial Company Officer Marion Sept. 9 – 10, 2024\n\nF/W0455 – Strategy and Tactics for Initial Company Operations Sept. 19 – 20 (Ames)\n\nNFA (F0760) -New Fire Chief Challenging Issues Urbandale September 25-26, 2024\n\nNFA F0455 Strategy & Tactics for Initial Company Operations Oct. 12-13, 2024\n\nNFA (F0458) Preparation for Initial Company Operations Ottumwa October 16 – 17, 2024\n\nNFA (N0645) Leadership in Supervision, West Des Moines Oct. 21 – 26, 2024\n\nNFA (F0770) Fire Investigation for First Responders Onawa Nov. 2 – 3, 2025\n\nNFA (F0458) Preparation for Initial Company Operations Sergeant Bluffs November 9 – 10, 2024\n\nBack to top\n\nFirefighting Equipment Revolving Loan Fund\n\nFirefighting Equipment Revolving Loan Fund Rules and Application\n\nThe State Fire Service and Emergency Response Council recognizes the need to establish a minimum training standard that will provide a means to prevent occupational accidents, injuries, illnesses, and deaths. The intent of this Minimum Training Standard is not to restrict any fire department from exceeding this standard. The Minimum Training Standard, as adopted in the Iowa Administrative Code Section 661, Chapter 251.\n\nBack to top\n\nIowa Fire Service and Emergency Response Council (IFSERC)\n\nThe Iowa Fire Service and Emergency Response Council (IFSERC) was created in 2000 via Iowa Code 100B.1.\n\nThe purpose of the Council is to advise and confer with the State Fire Marshal and Fire Service Training Bureau Chief on matters relating to fire protection services and training.\n\nThe Iowa Fire Service & Emergency Response Council serves to advise the State Fire Marshal and Fire Service Training Bureau Chief on issues concerning policies, fee schedules, minimum training standards, special grant applications, applications for the Fire Fighting Equipment Revolving Loan Fund, and hear testimony from the labor commissioner on inspections and investigations involving occupational safety and health standards for firefighters.\n\nEach of the eleven members of this Council is appointed by the Iowa Governor, serve a four-year term, have gender, political, and geographic balance, and must represent the following organizations: Iowa Firefighters Association, Iowa Fire Chiefs Association, Iowa Association of Professional Firefighters, Iowa Association of Professional Fire Chiefs, Iowa Emergency Medical Services Association, and the general public.\n\nIFSERC Meeting Minutes 3-14-2024\n\nBack to top\n\nIowa Fire and EMS Organizations\n\nBack to top\n\nFire Service Training Bureau History\n\nBack to top"
