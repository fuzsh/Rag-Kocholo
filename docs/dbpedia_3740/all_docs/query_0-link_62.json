        "text": "ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT\n\nThe overall goal of the North Little Rock Fire Department is to prevent the loss of life and property to citizens that are entrusted to our care, through direct intervention and preventative education. This is to be accomplished while ensuring the health and safety of our firefighters and maintaining the highest degree of professionalism within our department. The Fire Department is committed to the pursuit of its mission primarily through prevention and education. When incidents do occur, we provide emergency and non-emergency responses to/and mitigation of fire, medical emergencies, hazardous material incidents, technical rescues, and any natural, man-made or other situation that may arise.\n\nSMART 911\n\nWith Smart911, you can provide 9-1-1 call takers and first responders critical information you want them to know in any kind of emergency.\n\nWhen you call 9-1-1, your Smart911 Safety Profile displays on the 9-1-1 screen and the 9-1-1 call takers can view your addresses, medical information, home information, description of pets and vehicles, and emergency contacts. You can provide as much or as little information as you like.\n\nSmart911 is a national service meaning your Smart911 Safety Profile travels with you and is visible to any participating 9-1-1 center nationwide.\n\nCreate your own safety profile at smart911.com\n\nOPERATIONS\n\nThe NLRFD has 153 uniformed line personnel, 7 uniformed staff personnel, and 3 civilian employees. Line personnel are divided into 3 crews: A, B, and C Crews. Each crew is on duty for a 24-hour shift followed by 48 hours of off-duty. Uniformed staff and civilian personnel are on a Monday-Friday, 40 hours per week schedule.\n\nEach 24-hour shift operates out of 10 fire stations consisting of 10 Engines, 2 Trucks, 2 Rescues, 2 Battalion Chiefs, 1 Training Lieutenant and other special response units.\n\nEngines are equipped with firefighting equipment, emergency medical equipment, and a wide array of other tools. These engines are the NLRFD’s main firefighting apparatus. Trucks have aerial ladder capabilities and carry a wider variety of ground ladders. Rescues carry equipment used for fire rescues, emergency medical equipment along with extrication equipment.\n\nRescue 1 and Engine 7 are licensed and equipped Advanced Life Support (ALS) units. A minimum of one paramedic is assigned to each unit per shift. All other units are Basic Life Support (BLS) equipped.\n\nIn addition to fire and EMS calls, the NLRFD also responds to calls for service that require our Special Operations Response Team, Haz Mat Response Team and Water Rescue for responses to the Arkansas River.\n\nSTATIONS"
