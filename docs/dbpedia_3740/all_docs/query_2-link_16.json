        "text": "What does a firefighter do? Typical employers | Qualifications and training | Key skills\n\nFull-time firefighters help protect the public in emergency situations. They respond to a wide variety of calls: as well as fires, they assist at car crashes, chemical spills, flooding and water rescue.\n\nIn addition to attending emergency call-outs, the job involves:\n\nusing sophisticated firefighting and rescue equipment\n\ninspecting and maintaining equipment between uses\n\npromoting fire safety through talks, advice and training sessions\n\ninspecting building for fire safety and enforcing safety standards\n\nperforming practice drills\n\nworking with police and ambulance service personnel\n\nundertaking physical and academic training.\n\nThere are two main divisions of firefighter: full-time professional firefighters and retained firefighters. Apart from training, retained firefighters only attend the fire station during call-outs and usually have another full-time job. They're employed in rural areas and must live or work within five minutes of the station.\n\n24-hour shift work is a standard requirement of the job. The work can be stressful and dangerous but there is a great deal of job satisfaction to be gained from providing such a valuable service to the community.\n\nTypical employers of firefighters\n\nLocal authority fire services\n\nAirports and ports\n\nThe Armed Forces\n\nA small number of industrial organisations, such as those in the chemical, nuclear, gas and oil industries\n\nIndividual fire and rescue services advertise vacancies as they arise: look for them on fire services' websites and on social media. Senior roles are advertised on specialist industry websites and in the national press.\n\nQualifications and training required\n\nYou can become a firefighter both with or without a degree. You don't need specific academic qualifications to join, although health and safety qualifications and specialist management training could help, as might a more vocational degree focused on fire and rescue. Emergency service work experience may also be beneficial.\n\nWhy extracurricular activities will help you get hired\n\nTraining is an essential part of the work. New firefighters start with an intensive training period that's followed by an ongoing learning and development programme. You'll need to meet a fitness standard to be hired, and you'll also need to maintain a standard of fitness in the role.\n\nKey skills for firefighters\n\nThere are national minimum entrance requirements for firefighters: you need to be at least 17 and a half by the time of application, for example. Other essential qualities and skills include:"
