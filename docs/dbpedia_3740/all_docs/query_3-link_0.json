        "text": "Although Black history can be celebrated throughout the year, Black History Month offers an opportunity to reflect on and share the successes and accomplishments of African Americans in the fire service. And by looking at the past and present, the future comes into view â€” a future of opportunity achieved through diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nThe past\n\nIn many ways, the American firefighting community mirrored other opportunities and was not initially open and welcoming to minorities. Thus, the history of Blacks and the American fire service is one of breaking through the barriers of prejudice.\n\nEarly records of Black firefighters are fragmented and incomplete. The oldest documentation of government-sanctioned African American firefighters goes back to 1817 in New Orleans, when free men of color and slaves were recruited following a devastating fire.\n\nHighlights of Black history in the fire service\n\nWe honor the contributions of African American firefighters by building on the sacrifices and achievements of generations past. In the words of Liz R. Summers, an African American woman who joined the Atlanta Fire Department in 1977 and was eventually promoted to Battalion Chief:\n\nI left a legacy. I paved the way for the other women, other minorities, not just women.\n\nThe present\n\nThere are an estimated 1,041,200 firefighters (364,300 career, 676,900 volunteer) in the United States; 8.4% of career firefighters are African American PDF.\n\nWhen seen through the lens of the past, this represents significant forward motion. However, as we help fire departments achieve their full potential, we at the U.S. Fire Administration (USFA) believe that there is more work to be done to build a diverse, equitable and inclusive workforce.\n\n[We] will provide a higher level of service to the communities we serve when the people of that department respect the culture, language and beliefs of the people within that community.\n\nThe future\n\nWe are committed to supporting and strengthening the fire and emergency medical services and stakeholders as they build on the past and embrace diversity, equity and inclusion to reach their full potential and realize a bright future.\n\nThe USFA is hopeful for a future in which a fire department's workforce reflects the community it serves and where all fire service leaders understand that a diverse, equitable and inclusive environment provides a fire department with the ability to:\n\nProvide a higher level of service with personnel that better understand community needs.\n\nGenerate solutions to long-standing problems by exploring different perspectives and drawing on experience from various backgrounds.\n\nLeverage more experiences and different ideas to be more flexible, proactive and better able to adjust to new challenges.\n\nProfessional development opportunities:\n\nManaging Officer Program\n\nExecutive Fire Officer Program\n\nNational Fire Academy course catalog\n\nLearn more: What it means to really commit to a diverse and inclusive fire department\n\nRelated podcasts"
