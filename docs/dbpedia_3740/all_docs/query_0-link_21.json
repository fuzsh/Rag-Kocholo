May also be accidentally introduced when HAZMAT becomes involved in fire.\n\nAccountability\n\nThe process of emergency responders (fire, police, SAR, emergency medical, etc…) checking into and making themselves announced as being on-scene during an incident to an incident commander or accountability officer. Through the accountability system, each person is tracked throughout the incident until released from the scene by the incident commander or accountability officer. This is becoming a standard in the emergency services arena primarily for the safety of emergency personnel. This system may implement a name tag system or personal locator device (tracking device used by each individual that is linked to a computer).\n\nAlarm\n\n(1) system for detecting and reporting unusual conditions, such as smoke, fire, flood, loss of air, HAZMAT release, etc; (2) a specific assignment of multiple fire companies and/or units to a particular incident, usually of fire in nature; (3) centralized dispatch center for interpreting alarms and dispatching resources.\n\nApparatus\n\nA term usually used by firefighters describing a department vehicle (i.e. fire engine).\n\nCharge a hose\n\nTo make water pressure available on a hose in final preparation for its use. This is done on the scene after the hose is deployed.\n\nChauffeur\n\nDriver of a particular emergency apparatus. A paid position within the fire department and a promotable position.\n\nClass A fire\n\nA fire involving combustibles such as wood, paper, and other natural materials. Class B fire: A fire involving hydrocarbons.\n\nClass C fire\n\nAn electrical fire.\n\nClass D fire\n\nA fire involving metals, such as sodium, titanium, magnesium, potasium, uranium, lithium, plutonium and calcium.\n\nCockloft\n\nStructural space above ceiling and below rafters, often connecting adjacent occupancies and permitting fire to spread laterally, often unseen.\n\nCollapse zone\n\nThe area around a structure that would contain debris if the building were to collapse.\n\nCompany\n\nTwo or more firefighters organized as a team, led by a fire officer, and equipped to perform certain operational functions. Compare with platoon and unit.\n\nCompany officer\n\nA fire officer, typically a lieutenant or captain, who leads a team of two or more firefighters in a company.\n\nCompartment Fire\n\nAn “Isolated” fire, or a fire which is “boxed in” or “closed off” from the rest of the structure. An example of this is a fire in a room where all the windows and doors are closed preventing the fire from spreading to other rooms.\n\nConfined space\n\nA confined space is any space: 1) that has limited or restricted means of entry or exit; 2) is large enough for a person to enter to perform tasks; 3) and is not designed or configured for continuous occupancy\n\nCross lay\n\nArrangement of hose on a pumper such that it can be quickly unloaded from either side of the apparatus; often pre-connected to a pump outlet and equipped with a suitable nozzle. Also known as Mattydale Lay.\n\nElectrical fire\n\nA fire in which the primary source of heat is electricity, resulting in combustion of adjacent insulation and other materials; may be hazardous to attempt to extinguish using water.\n\nEMS\n\nEmergency medical service(s).\n\nEngine\n\nA fire suppression vehicle that has a water pump and, typically, is designed to carry firehose and a limited supply of water.\n\nEngineer: A firefighter responsible for driving the engine to the scene of the call and operation of the pumps on an engine, to provide sufficient water to the firefighters on the hose. The term may be either a position title or a rank; usage varies among departments. (Also see Chauffer)\n\nEngine Company\n\nA group of firefighters assigned to an apparatus with a water pump and equipped with firehose and other tools related to fire extinguishment.\n\nEngine pressure\n\nThe pressure in a fire hose measured at the outlet of the pump.\n\nEnhanced 9-1-1\n\nElectronic system for automatic correlation of physical telephone lines with information about the location of the caller — a useful tool for dispatchers when the caller has an emergency but cannot speak.\n\nEvacuation\n\nRemoval of personnel from a dangerous area, in particular, a HAZMAT incident, burning building, or other emergency. Also refers to act of removing firefighters from a structure in danger of collapsing.\n\nExplorer\n\nA young adult, between 14 and 21, who learns the basics of firefighting.\n\nExposure\n\nProperty near fire that may become involved by transfer of heat or burning material from main fire, typically by convection or radiation. May range from 40 feet (12 m) to several miles, depending on size and type of fire or explosion.\n\nExterior attack\n\nA method of extinguishing a fire which does not involve entering the structure. Often used when so much of the building is involved in fire that there is little or no benefit to risking firefighter safety by inserting them into the structure. May be a temporary measure when there are not sufficient personnel on scene to form an entry team and a rescue team (to rescue the entry team). Also known as Surround and drown. Compare Interior attack.\n\nExtrication\n\nRemoval of a trapped victim such as a vehicle extrication, confined space rescue, or trench rescue; sometimes using hydraulic spreader, Jaws of Life, or other technical equipment.\n\nFDC (Fire Department Connection)\n\nLocation in which pumping apparatus hooks to a buildings standpipe and or sprinkler system. Usually a 3″ female connection.\n\nFire flow: The amount of water being pumped onto a fire, or required to extinguish a hypothetical fire. A critical calculation in light of the axiom that an ordinary fire will not be extinguished unless there is sufficient water to remove the heat of the fire.\n\nFireground\n\nThe operational area at the scene of a fire; area in which incident commander is in control. Also used as name of radio frequency to be used by units operating in the fireground, as in “Responding units switch to fireground.”\n\nFire hazard\n\nMaterials, structures or processes that may result in creating a fire, permitting a fire to grow undetected, or preventing people from escaping a fire.\n\nFire inspector\n\nA person responsible for issuing permits and enforcing the fire code, including any necessary premises inspection, as before allowing (or during) a large indoor gathering.\n\nFire load (Btu/sq ft)\n\nAn estimate of the amount of heat that will be given off during ordinary combustion of all the fuel in a given space; e.g., a bedroom or a lumberyard.\n\nFire marshal\n\nAdministrative and investigative office for fire prevention and arson investigation. Has legal authority to enforce state and local fire laws.\n\nFire wall\n\nBuilding structure designed to delay horizontal spread of a fire from one area of a building to another; often regulated by fire code and required to have self-closing doors, and fireproof construction.\n\nFirst due\n\nRefers to either the first apparatus arriving on the scene of a fire or the area in which a company is expected to be the first to arrive on a fire scene.\n\nFit test\n\nPeriodic test of how well the facepiece of an SCBA fits a particular firefighter.\n\nFlashover\n\nSimultaneous ignition of combustible materials in a closed space, as when materials simultaneously reach their fire point; may also result in rollover.\n\nFoam- Extinguishing\n\nAgent formed by mixing foam concentrate with water and aerating the solution for expansion.\n\nForcible entry\n\nGaining entry to an area using force to disable or bypass security devices, typically using force tools, sometimes using tools specialized for entry (e.g., Halligan, K-tool).\n\nForward lay\n\nProcedure of stringing water supply hose from a water source toward a fire scene; compare with reverse lay.\n\nFriction loss: Reduction of flow in a firehose caused by friction between the water and the lining of the hose. Depends primarily upon diameter, type and length of hose, and amount of water (GPM) flowing through.\n\nFully involved\n\nTerm of size-up meaning fire, heat and smoke in a structure are so widespread that internal access must wait until fire streams can be applied.\n\nIDLH\n\nAny situation deemed Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health (IDLH).\n\nIncident Commander\n\nThe officer in charge of all activities at an incident. See Incident Command System. Incident Safety Officer: The officer in charge of scene safety at an incident. See Incident Command System.\n\nIndirect attack\n\nMethod of firefighting in which water is pumped onto materials above or near the fire so that the splash rains onto the fire, often used where a structure is unsafe to enter.\n\nInitial attack\n\nFirst point of attack on a fire where hose lines or fuel separation are used to prevent further extension of the fire.\n\nInterior attack\n\nInserting a team of firefighters into the burning structure, in an attempt to extinguish a blaze from inside the structure, minimizing property damage from fire, smoke, and water. Requires a minimum of four fully-equipped firefighters: an entry team of at least two to enter the structure and fight the fire, and two standing by to rescue or relieve the entry team (see two in, two out). If the entry team(s) cannot extinguish the blaze, may become an Exterior Attack.\n\nISO Rating\n\n(Insurance Services Office Public Protection Classification Rating) This is a rating published by the Insurance Services Office. Insurance companies, in many states, use this number to determine homeowner insurance premiums. Recently some insurance companies, including State Farm, have now adopted a per-zip code, actual loss, based system in several states and no longer use the ISO (PPC) system.\n\nIrons\n\nThe flathead axe mated with the halligan bar. Firefighters often refer to these as the Crossed Irons, or Married Irons, because the Halligan Bar can fit to the Axe head.\n\nMaltese Cross\n\nThe emblem of the fire service is often referred to as a “Maltese Cross”. But the actual origin of the current or common emblem in the U.S. remains uncertain. While it is true that the Knights Hospitalers of Jerusalem (AKA Knights of St. John) did wear a cross emblem and a version of that cross has been used as a fire service icon, it bears little resemblance to the current form in use in much of the United States. It is possible to accept that the current design is just a stylized artistic embellishment of the original form. The current design may have also been influenced by the design of the cross of Saint Florian.\n\nMass casualty incident (MCI)\n\nAny incident that produces a large number of injured persons requiring emergency medical treatment and transportation to a medical facility. The exact number of patients that makes an incident “mass casualty” is defined by departmental procedures and may vary from area to area.\n\nMaster stream\n\nA large nozzle, either portable or fixed to a pumper, capable of throwing large amounts of water relatively long distances.\n\nMeans of egress\n\nThe way out of a building during an emergency; may be by door, window, hallway, or exterior fire escape; local fire codes will often dictate the size. location and type according to the number of occupants and the type of occupancy.\n\nMultiple alarms\n\nA request by an incident commander for additional personnel and apparatus. Each department will vary on the number of apparatus and personnel on each additional alarm.\n\nMutual aid\n\nAn agreement between nearby fire companies to assist each other during emergencies by responding with available manpower and apparatus.\n\nMVA\n\nMotor Vehicle Accident.\n\nOccupancy\n\nZoning and safety code term used to determine how a structure is permitted to be used and occupied, which in turn dictates the necessary safety structures and procedures.\n\nOffensive attack\n\nMethod of firefighting in which water or other extinguisher is taken directly to the seat of the fire, as opposed to being pumped in that general direction from a safe distance.\n\nOSHA\n\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration, U.S. government agency concerned with regulating employee safety, particularly in hazardous occupations such as firefighting.\n\nOverhauling\n\nLate stage in fire-suppression process during which the burned area is carefully examined for remaining sources of heat that may re-kindle the fire. Often coincides with salvage operations to prevent further loss to structure or its contents, as well as fire-cause determination and preservation of evidence.\n\nOxidizer\n\nA hazardous material containing oxygen that can combine with adjacent fuel to start or feed a fire.\n\nPersonnel Accountability Report (“PAR”)\n\nEnd-result of personnel accountability system. Best report is all hands, AOK, worse is squad missing. You will often hear command ask for a “PAR” when something has changed on the fireground. Often the reply will be something like, “Engine 4, PAR.” or “Engine 4 has PAR.”\n\nPersonnel accountability system\n\nTag, ‘passport’, or other system for identification and tracking of personnel at an incident, especially those entering and leaving an IDLH area; intended to permit rapid determination of who may be at risk or lost during sudden changes at the scene.\n\nPlug\n\nSlang term for a fire hydrant. This survives from the days when water mains actually had holes in the tops that were plugged. Many firefighters would like to keep this word while many others think it should be replaced with the accurate term, “hydrant”.\n\nPre-arrival instructions\n\nDirections given by a dispatcher to a caller until emergency units can arrive.\n\nPre-fire, pre-incident planning: Information collected by fire prevention officers to assist in identifying hazards and the equipment, supplies, personnel, skills, and procedures needed to deal with a potential incident.\n\nPre-planning\n\nFire protection strategy involving visits to potentially hazardous occupancies for inspection, follow up analysis and recommendations for actions to be taken in case of specific incidents. Not to be confused with post-planning.\n\nProbie\n\n(also rookie) new firefighter on employment probation (a period of time during which his or her skills are improved, honed, tested, and evaluated).\n\nProfessional Firefighter\n\nAll firefighters are classified as “professionals” by both the International Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC) and the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF trade union). All firefighters are required by most state laws and general practice to meet the same training and equipment standards, take the same examinations for promotion and perform the same work under the same hazards. There are two accepted categories of Professional Firefighters–Volunteer Firefighters who may or may not receive pay for services and Career Firefighters whose primary employment and source of earned income is in the fire service.\n\nPumper\n\nA fire truck with a water tank.\n\nPump operator, technician\n\n(also a chauffeur): person responsible for operating the pumps on a pumper and typically for driving the pumper to an incident.\n\nRapid Intervention Crew/Group/Team (RIC, RIG, or RIT)\n\nThis is a standby crew whose purpose is to go in for the rescue of firefighters in trouble. While all of these versions of the name for a firefighter rescue crew either have been used or continue to be used in several areas, the National Incident Management System (NIMS) has adopted the term\n\nRapid Intervention Crew/Company\n\n(“RIC”) to be the standard in the Incident Command System (ICS). Currently, U.S. federally required training programs, from DHS and FEMA, are in the process of standardizing many terms and procedures under NIMS.\n\nReflash, rekindle\n\nA situation in which a fire, thought to be extinguished, resumes burning.\n\nRescue Company\n\nSquad of firefighters trained and equipped to enter adverse conditions and rescue victims of an incident.

Rollover: The ignition of ceiling-level fire gases.\n\nSalvage, salvage cover\n\nHeavy-duty tarpaulins folded or rolled for quick deployment to cover personal property subjected to possible water or other damage during firefighting.\n\nScene safety\n\nSteps taken at or near an emergency scene to reduce hazards and prevent further injuries to workers, victims or bystanders.\n\nSCBA Self Contained Breathing Apparatus which you have your oxygen tank and mask, keeps you from breathing in smoke or hazardous gases. Part of your personal protective equipment (PPE).\n\nSides A, B, C, and D\n\nTerms used by firefighters labeling the multiple sides of a building starting with side A or Alpha being the front of the structure and working its way around the outside of the structure in a clockwise direction. This labels the front side A or Alpha, the left side B or Bravo, the rear side C or Charlie, and the right side D or Delta.\n\nSize-up\n\nInitial evaluation of an incident, in particular a determination of immediate hazards to responders, other lives and property, and what additional resources may be needed. Example: “Two-story brick taxpayer with heavy smoke showing from rear wooden porches and children reported trapped.”\n\nSolid stream\n\nFire stream from round orifice of nozzle.

Often an essential element in personnel accountability program.\n\nStandard operating procedure, guideline (SOP or SOG)\n\nRules for the operation of a fire department, such as how to respond to various types of emergencies, training requirements, use of protective equipment, radio procedures; often include local interpretations of regulations and standards. In general, “procedures” are specific, whereas “guidelines” are less detailed.\n\nStatic pressure\n\nThe pressure in a water system when the water is not flowing.\n\nStraight stream\n\nRound, hollow stream formed as water passes a round baffle through a round orifice (e.g., on an adjustable nozzle.) Compare solid stream.\n\nStretch\n\nCommand to lay out (and connect) fire hose and nozzle.\n\nStructure fire (or “structural fire”)\n\nA fire in a residential or commercial building. Urban fire departments are primarily geared toward structural firefighting. The term is often used to distinguish them from wildland fire or other outside fire, and may also refer to the type of training and equipment such as “structure PPE” (personal protective equipment).\n\nSworn Personnel\n\nFirefighters take a sworn oath to protect and serve the community in which they work.\n\nTailboard\n\nPortion at rear of fire engine where firefighters could stand and ride (now considered overly dangerousand against Department Policy in Carmel), or step up to access hoses in the hose bed.\n\nTanker\n\nAn aircraft equipped to carry water or fire retardant for use in wildland fire suppression. Archaic: see “Tender”, below.\n\nTruck company\n\nA group of firefighters assigned to an apparatus that carries ladders, forcible entry tools, possibly extrication tools and salvage covers, and who are otherwise equipped to perform rescue, ventilation, overhaul and other specific functions at fires; also called “ladder company”.\n\nTurnout Gear\n\nThe protective clothing worn by firefighters\n\nTwo-in, two-out (or “two in/two out”)\n\nRefers to the OSHA standard safety tactic of having one team of two firefighters enter a hazardous zone (IDLH), while at least two others stand by outside in case the first two need rescue — thus requiring a minimum of four firefighters on scene prior to starting interior attack. Also refers to the “buddy system” in which firefighters never enter or leave a burning structure alone.\n\nType I, II, III, IV, V Building\n\nU.S. classification system for fire resistance of building construction types, including definitions for “resistive” Type I, “non-combustible” Type II, “ordinary” Type III, heavy timber Type IV, and “frame construction” Type V (i.e., made entirely of wood).\n\nVehicle fire\n\nType of fire involving motor vehicles themselves, their fuel or cargo; has peculiar issues of rescue, explosion sources, toxic smoke and runoff, and scene safety.\n\nVentilation\n\nImportant procedure in firefighting in which the hot smoke and gases are removed from inside a structure, either by natural convection or forced, and either through existing openings or new ones provided by firefighters at appropriate locations (e.g., on the roof). Proper ventilation can save lives and improper ventilation can cause backdraft or other hazards. Car fire ventilation standards were improved by Kevin “Center Punch” Tomaszewski on Feb. 5,2008.\n\nVenturi effect\n\nCreating a partial vacuum using a constricted fluid flow, used in fire equipment for mixing chemicals into water streams, or for measuring flow velocity.\n\nVertical ventilation\n\nVertical ventilation\n\nVentilation technique making use of the principle of convection in which heated gases naturally rise.\n\nVoids (building): Enclosed portions of a building where fire can spread undetected.\n\nWater hammer\n\nLarge, damaging shock wave in a water supply system caused by shutting a valve quickly, or by permitting a vehicle to drive across an unprotected fire hose.\n\nWell Involved\n\nTerm of size-up meaning fire, heat and smoke in a structure are so widespread that internal access must wait until fire streams can be applied.\n\nWet down ceremony\n\nA traditional ceremony for the placing of new apparatus in service. There are several versions of this but it usually includes: pushing the old apparatus out, wetting down the new vehicle and pushing it back into the station. It may also include the moving of the bell to the new apparatus, photos, etc."
