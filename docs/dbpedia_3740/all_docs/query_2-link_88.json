        "text": "The University of California (UC), Davis Fire Department (UCDFD) is established in the creation of the University Farm in 1917. Prior to becoming one of ten UC campuses, UC Davis served as the “farm school” for UC Berkley and would later become the flag-ship agriculture school for the UC system. Fire plagued critical infrastructure of the farm school in those early years prompting the formation of a fire brigade comprised of students, faculty, and staff to protect the University’s investments.\n\nThe structure of the all volunteer brigade at UC Davis remained largely unchanged until UCDFD introduced the Student Firefighter (SFF) Program in 1949. The program formalized the role of students functioning as emergency responders and initiated what would be a transition to the predominantly career organization that UCDFD is today.\n\nIn 1955, UC Davis began hiring career firefighters to work alongside the student firefighters. By 1974 the risk complexity of problems posed by the sprawling campus reached a magnitude that required a higher level of training and response demands that shifted the student’s primary role to one designed to augment the response capabilities of career staff. The program perpetually evolves as the needs of the campus and the fire department continue to change."
