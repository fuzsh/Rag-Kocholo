Here is an excerpt from “THE DAILY COLUMBIAN NEWSPAPER” May 3rd, 1898 attesting to that fact:\n\n“Fighting Fire at Surrey Centre-\n\nGreat excitement was caused at Surrey Centre, Sunday afternoon, by an alarm of fire, caused by sparks supposed to have blown from the Chinese shack on Coast Meridian Road. The flames spread with great fierceness, helped along with a brisk wind, which was blowing. Mr. A. Richardson’s property stood in great danger for quite a time. Fences, logs and a great amount of rubbish lying around blazed merrily for a long time.\n\nNeighbors and all persons in the vicinity, along with the boys worked like Trojans and gained noble victory after a most terrible fight. Churchland’s farm and outbuildings luckily escaped. Fences were torn down to stay the rush of the fire fiend. Water was thrown on the flames by Surrey Centre Fire Brigade, (long may they live!) from two powerful spray pumps. Loss not known; no insurance”\n\nDISASTROUS FIRE\n\nSurrey’s First Fire Brigade correctly identifies a volunteer fire brigade at Surrey Centre in 1898. However, no other information has been found defining the existence of such a community service, until 1928, when Cloverdale area instituted their volunteer fire brigade and therefore this is generally considered the functional focal point for the beginning of Surrey Fire Department.\n\nThe following information was published in the Surrey Gazette Newspaper and recorded in the Cloverdale Volunteer Fire Brigade Minutes.\n\n“Friday, November 2nd 1928; the business section of Cloverdale was threatened with destruction by a spectacular fire, which burned the rooming house and restaurant owned by Albert Fournier, as well as a frame building owned by Max Kovis of New Westminster, early this morning.”\n\nBoth structures destroyed, fronted onto Pacific Highway [Hwy. 15] at the north end of town. The Kovis building was divided into store premises that were occupied by Mrs. J. M. Richardson, who operated a variety store; Mr. J. A. Ross a plumber and Mr. W. M. Goodlet a shoe repairer. Each of these business people lost all their stock.\n\nPractically all the contents in the rooming house and restaurant were saved by the rooming house occupants and others who turned out to fight the inferno, they carried those contents outside. Even at that, the total loss was estimated at $1,000; fortunately a substantial amount of the loss was covered by insurance.\n\nThe cause of the fire, which broke out in the Kovis Block, was not determined. Mrs. Richardson in a dwelling adjoining the Kovis building first discovered the flames; at 3:00 a.m. Word of the fire quickly spread throughout Cloverdale and within a very short time a great many of the town’s residents were on scene, looking to help save whatever could be removed from the premises which were threatened by the flames.\n\nThe fire had obtained a secure hold on the Kovis building by the time it was discovered by Mrs. Richardson so a call was made to New Westminster and Vancouver Fire Departments for assistance, however, the fire departments in both cities declined to respond. An appeal was then made to Blaine, Washington Volunteer Fire Department. About fifteen minutes after the call for help, Blaine fire fighters were on the scene with their chemical fire fighting equipment, and it was largely due to their efforts that the loss was not more extensive.\n\nThe flames extended quickly into Fournier’s rooming house, which was a two-storey structure. There was a concerted effort by the people of Cloverdale to slow the flames spreading into the Fournier building before Blaine fire department arrived, but the structure was doomed to burn. [Note: This effort was likely in the form of a bucket brigade, taking water from wells, ditches or ponds. There was a sawmill and a pond on the corner of today’s 60th Ave and Highway 15]\n\nThe Highway Garage, operated by Charles D. Hamre, was adjacent the site of the Fournier Building, and immediately across the Pacific Highway were the storage tanks and a warehouse of Imperial Oil. Volunteers of Cloverdale people while under direction of Surrey Chief Constable Alex. D. Matheson and the Blaine fire fighters, succeeded in saving both these structures, although the roof and side of Hamre’s garage were scorched.\n\nThe rooming house contained ten rooms, which were all occupied at the time of the fire. It was also home of a large restaurant. Mr. J. L. Griffiths, of Cloverdale Motors Ltd., was one of the rooming house tenants. He was awakened by the reflection of flames through his window and he aroused other occupants.\n\nThe lodgers had ample time to dress and gather their belongings before the spread of flames to their abode and so they began removing furniture, which was always the first chore in areas without fire protection.\n\nThe next morning, residents of Cloverdale were generous with their praise of Blaine fire fighters, for saving the business section of town, but expressed great surprise and disappointment over the failure of New Westminster and Vancouver Fire Departments to send a chemical wagon manned with experienced fire fighters.\n\nPURCHASE OF FIRE EQUIPMENT\n\nFire fighting equipment for the protection of Cloverdale and surrounding district, “as soon as possible,” was the unanimous decision at a public meeting of businessmen and other residents of the community. The meeting was held in the Municipal Hall on Monday, November 25, 1928. This meeting was one of several arranged by the Surrey Board of Trade, following the fire at the Fournier and Kovis buildings. The purpose of the meetings was to discuss ways and means of obtaining equipment so as to afford some protection against loss by fire in the future.\n\nThe equipment proposed at these meetings was a chemical wagon fitted with two tanks of fifty gallons each, and that it could be towed by an automobile or truck, to any fire that might breakout. It was to be manned by a volunteer brigade. The estimated cost of this equipment was about $900, but efforts were made to raise $1,100, the extra $200 to be presented to Blaine Washington, Volunteer Fire Brigade for their efforts and valuable service given to Cloverdale on November 2nd.\n\nA committee was created to raise $1,100, subscriptions were solicited from all the merchants and residents located within an approximate radius of one mile, from the corner of New McLellan Road and Pacific Highway. An amount of $25 was collected from each businessman and $7 from each resident, as an assessment calculated to raise the required money. Mr. A. J. Christmas was appointed acting secretary of the committee. Subscription fees were forwarded to him or to the Cloverdale Branch of the Bank of Montreal.\n\nCLOVERDALE GETS FIRE EQUIPMENT AND A VOLUNTEER FIRE BRIGADE\n\nWith the arrival in early December 1928 of chemical tanks and a hose reel, Cloverdale was soon to have a fire department. The tanks and hose reel were made for use on a horse-drawn vehicle and were obtained from the City of Vancouver, which with the advent of motorized apparatus had no use for the equipment and therefore loaned it to Cloverdale, free of charge, for an indefinite period of time.\n\nThe equipment was in first class condition; however, money was required to make necessary changes to bring it up-to-date. The monies collected by subscriptions were allocated to making these alterations. There were two tanks of forty gallon capacity each. In addition to a hose reel and some extension ladders. This equipment was removed from its carriage and installed on a Buick automobile chassis. More hose was obtained and Cloverdale had a small very efficient fire fighting unit for protection of the district. The efficiency of this Chemical apparatus – which was virtually the same capacity as the equipment Blaine had used at the recent Cloverdale fire – was considered quite adequate.\n\nCredit for obtaining the equipment from Vancouver belonged to Mr. A. J. Christmas and Mr. H. V. Parr, whom negotiated with the Vancouver authorities.\n\nOn February 12, 1929, a meeting was held to form a volunteer fire brigade and the first Volunteer Fire Chief elected for Cloverdale was Charles Hamre, who owned the Highway Garage situated next to the conflagration of November 2nd 1928. The newly created equipment was housed at Hamre’s garage and an air horn was mounted atop the garage as a alarm device to summon volunteer fire fighters.\n\nThe second Volunteer Fire Chief of Cloverdale Volunteer Fire Brigade was Charles’ brother Ed Hamre who took over when Charles died. The third Volunteer Fire Chief of the Cloverdale Volunteer Fire Brigade was Bruno Zappone. Today, [2005] Bruno still lives in Cloverdale and remains active in many community affairs. In 2004, Bruno received the Queen’s 50th Anniversary Medal for his many contributions to the City of Surrey.\n\nNOTE: The “Chemical Wagons” used in 1928 contained two tanks [40 gallons each] stationary mounted on the vehicle, and also a reel of ¾ – inch hard rubber fire hose.\n\nWhen the water and bicarbonate of soda in the tanks was mixed with sulphuric acid, carbon dioxide gas was generated, building up pressure in the chemical tanks and thereby expelling water under pressure.\n\nThese early chemical wagons were most always soda-acid and not foam type units.\n\nTHE NEXT STEP UP THE LADDER\n\nThe next fire brigade to be established in Surrey was the White Rock Volunteer Fire Brigade.\n\nThe White Rock area had many disastrous fires in the early 1900s, but had no practical fire fighting resources until 1934. Nevertheless, they did have fire protection supplied by Blaine, USA; New Westminster and Cloverdale.\n\nOne fire of note was a Wildland fire in September 1910, which burned from east of the White Rock area through to Blackie Spit, a distance of more than 6 miles. Eight homes owned by the Hazlemere Lumber Company, a number of summer homes and some businesses were all devoured by the flames.\n\nIn January 1927, fire destroyed buildings along sea front road [Washington Ave.– Marine Dr.]. Some of the premises destroyed and damaged were; the Pavilion, Auditorium, Clancy Building, Post Office, J. D. MacMillan and Fred Philps buildings. Damaged were Shepherd Brother’s Meat Market [operated by Ben and Len Shepherd — Len Shepherd was Surrey Fire Chief Al Cleaver’s father-in-law], and Dinty Moore’s Confectionary.\n\nThis fire became the central point in establishing a volunteer fire brigade for the White Rock area, with considerable debate toward forming the areas first volunteer fire brigade.\n\nAn interesting fire occurred in 1928 at the Great Northern Railway Station Depot on sea front road. William R. Barge [Surrey Captain Harold Barge’s father] supplied buckets from his hardware store to facilitate a bucket brigade in passing water from Semiahmoo Bay to the train station fire, an action that saved the building.\n\nFinally in 1933, after years of talking, a committee of three, Messrs. W.J. Moffat, W. J. McIlwain and Councillor Logan Davis, was established to muster a group of volunteers to form the White Rock Fire Brigade. W. J. McIlwain was appointed first Deputy and first driver, until the group became structurally sound and selected a Chief. The newly created group responded to their first fire in March 1934, it was a bush fire on Buena Vista Avenue that threatened some homes. It was reported that their bucket brigade saved a lot of valuable property.\n\nOrganizational development with the newly formed group was lacking initiative. This obstacle soon came under control when retired Fire Chief W. J. Watson of the New Westminster Fire Department and summer resident of the White Rock area, was appointed Fire Marshall in 1934.\n\nFund raising events took place and in 1936 a reorganization” meeting was held. W. J. McIlwain was elected Chief. McIlwain soon moved to the interior of B. C. and the fire brigade faltered for some time under various Chiefs, along with a burden of inadequate equipment, requiring tires, batteries and other essential operational items.\n\nIn 1940, Jack Kelman [Gassy Jack] became Fire Chief and housed the fire truck in his Shell service station at the corner of Oxford Street and Washington Avenue. So began the functional White Rock Fire Department.\n\nTHE FORMATIVE YEARS\n\nDuring World War II, the federal government established Air Raid Precaution Units, [A.R.P.] for civil defense purposes across Canada. One such unit was Surrey Air Raid Patrol, headed by G. A. Hooser. Air Raid Wardens were given buckets of sand and shovels with which to extinguish incendiary fires, that were expected to happen with the Japanese dropping incendiary leaflets from their aircraft. No air raids took place in -Canadian airspace during the War.\n\nAs a result of the A. R. P., two things happened – one, the Municipality of Surrey received much needed equipment when the A.R.P. was disbanded after the War – two, new fire halls sprang up throughout Surrey, including South Westminster, Sullivan, Crescent Beach, Port Kells and Hazlemere.\n\nIn 1952, the provincial government decided to replace Provincial Fire Marshall Deputy positions with Municipal Fire Marshall positions. Ray Feather filled the new post in Surrey on February 7th 1952, when he was offered the title of Fire Inspection Officer and Coordinating Officer, replacing Lambert Burton who retired that year. [Ray Feather was in charge of the Surrey Municipal Stockroom and had been a firefighter in Saskatoon Fire Department prior to the War.]\n\nIt is interesting to note that in the 1950 Surrey Volunteer Fire Chiefs and the paid firefighters were sworn in as Forest Fire Prevention Officers under the jurisdiction of the British Columbia Forest Service. The reason for this was that the Forest Service had total control for issuing burning permits and fighting Wildland fires. At a later date Surrey Fire Department Officers were appointed as Provincial Assistant Fire Marshals and eventually, Local Assistant Fire Commissioners.\n\nUntil 1957, there was no efficient system of addresses in Surrey. In the closely-knit community of earlier years fires were located by the name of the property owners. With the construction of the Trans-Canada Highway and removal of tolls on Pattullo Bridge, the population of Surrey increased steadily and problems surfaced in locating fires by individual property owners names, this problem was recognized earlier, when in 1948, Canada Post had urged Surrey Council to adopt an address system. In 1957, the Municipality joined with the rest of the Province of British Columbia municipalities in adopting a grid system of streets and addresses. After the fire fighters and residents learned the new system, emergency personnel could be dispatched precisely to specific addresses.\n\nIn 1958, Surrey amalgamated all its fire districts into one fire department, at which time the various fire halls were given numbers instead of district names. Individual pride was a factor to this change, many of the fire halls shunned the number system and preferred the continued use of their names, for example:- Port Kells Volunteer Fire Department, Hall # 7.\n\nAs a result of this amalgamation Ray Feather was put in charge of all fire districts in Surrey. This new system was further endorsed when shortly thereafter the Municipality abolished the Ward System of political representation.\n\nRECENT YEARS [1959 forward]\n\nThe members of Surrey Fire Department have always been pioneers in new developments and initiatives. Mouth-to-Mouth Resuscitation was tried in Surrey when other agencies, [except for Richmond Fire Services], were skeptical about the procedure.\n\nThe first female fire fighters on a Municipal Fire Department in B. C. were Jean Turley and Helen Beaton of Johnston Heights, Fire Hall #6, when they came on staff in 1960.\n\nSurrey now has 409 full time members. Surrey ranks high among the best trained fire departments in the country. Fire fighters from Surrey are in demand as trainers throughout the Province of British Columbia, Western Canada, with the Justice Institute of B. C. Fire Academy and also in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe professional rank and file members of Surrey Fire Department are some of the most respected and recognized union brethren in North America.\n\nTHE FIRE CHIEFS OF SURREY\n\nThe first person to be in charge of Surrey municipal fire services was Lambert Burton, appointed on Feb. 17, 1 947. He was an Inspector with the Surrey Building Department, however, he was also an oil burner inspector and as such was in charge of overseeing the operation of the fire department.\n\nIn 1952, Ray C. Feather, was appointed to the position as Surrey’s first full-time Fire Chief. He was also working for the Municipality of Surrey, as Manager of the Municipal Stockroom, prior to his appointment.\n\nIn 1972, Chief Feather retired and W. Allan Cleaver was appointed Fire Chief. Chief Cleaver came up through the ranks, he was a volunteer fire fighter at South Westminster Fire Hall # 1 and was also the first Training Officer for Surrey Fire Department.\n\nIn 1986, Chief Cleaver retired and Howard G. Seter became Fire Chief. Chief Seter also came up through the ranks, beginning as a volunteer at South Westminster Fire Hall # 1.\n\nIn 1996, Chief Seter retired and James G. Bale became Fire Chief. Chief Bale also came up through the ranks, beginning as a volunteer at North Central Surrey Volunteer Fire Department, Hall #4. Prior to joining the fire department Jim Bale was the Drum Major for the North Central Surrey Junior Firemen’s Band, [Canadian Legion Jr. Band].\n\nIn April 2001, Chief Bale left the Fire Service and Len Garis was appointed Fire Chief. Chief Garis was promoted from a position of Assistant Fire Chief on Surrey Fire Department. Chief Garis came to Surrey Fire Department from Pitt Meadows Fire Department where he was Fire Chief, he also served with of the Justice Institute of British Columbia, Fire Services Branch. Chief Garis grew up in Cedar Hills / West Whalley area of North Surrey and would often visit at Fire Hall #2 during his journeys to and from school at West Whalley.\n\nEARLY MONEY BY-LAWS FOR SURREY FIRE DEPARTMENT\n\nUnder the Ward System of Municipal Government each Ward had to pass their own by-laws to raise funds for improvements. Fire brigades were considered improvements. Prior to money by-laws development of fire brigades was by personal subscription of funds by residents, such as donations, fund raising dances, bake sales, etc. Here are some of the early money by-laws for Surrey Fire Department.\n\nBy-law # Name Date of final approval Amount 637 Cloverdale Fire Protection By-law June 30 1940 $700.00 638 White Rock Fire Protection By-law June 30 1940 $750.00 781 Cloverdale Fire Protection By-law June 11 1945 $ 3,750.00* 782 White Rock Fire Protection By-law June 9 1945 $ 3,750.00* 783 Port Kells Fire Protection By-law June 11 1945 $ 3,750.00* 834 South Westminster Fire Protection By-law Oct. 1 1946 $ 10,000.00 835 Hazelmere Fire Protection By-law Oct. 1 1946 $ 3,750.00 861 Crescent Beach/Ocean Park By-law April 8 1947 $ 5,000.00 970 Cloverdale Fire Protection By-law June 13 1949 $ 8,000.00 971 Sunnyside Area Fire Protection By-law June 13 1949 $ 4,500.00 1084 Sullivan Area Fire Protection By-law April 23 1951 $15,000.00 *By-law for the purchase of War surplus Crash Wagons.\n\nThe following by-laws are also recorded, although the money amounts have not been checked.\n\nBy-law # Name Year\n\n#1139 North Central Surrey Fire Protection District 1952\n\n#1162 Newton & Strawberry Hill 1952**\n\n#1276 West Central Surrey Fire Protection District 1954\n\n#1331 Crescent Beach /Ocean Park Fire Protection District 1955\n\n** This by-law did not pass. Had it passed then Hall # 10 would have been located in the area of Scott Road rather than 72 Avenue and King George Highway.\n\nBy-law # 1652 was a Consolidation of Fire Districts Referendum By-law – held in 1958.\n\nPURCHASE OF CRASH WAGONS\n\nSurrey Fire Department purchased the Royal Canadian Air Force Crash Wagons on February 13, 1945. They were for the districts of Cloverdale, White Rock and Port Kells. The trucks were 3 ton Ford with V/8 motors, they had six wheel drive, 2 in the front and 4 single tandem on the back, the drive system was Marmon-Harrington. These trucks were in Calgary and McLeod Alberta as war surplus.\n\nThe related costs were:\n\n$ 3,287.00 each c/w Asbesto Fire suits $9,861\n\nFreight $ 200.00 each $ 600\n\nInspection & Telegrams $ 160\n\n$ 10,621.00\n\nFIRE TRUCKS AND EQUIPMENT\n\nAs mentioned on page one, the earliest fire equipment known to be used in Surrey were two “powerful spray pumps,” these were used at Surrey Centre in the year 1898, however, it is not known if these were on a vehicle, wagon, trailer, or carried by hand. The first recorded, [authenticated], fire equipment used in Surrey is explained on page 9, and was in Cloverdale. The first ‘real’ or factory built fire truck was a 1922 White. This truck was a used Chemical Wagon [Truck] purchased in 1940 by the Cloverdale Fire Brigade, from the City of Vancouver, for $325. This truck is now owned and being restored by the Surrey Firefighters Association, Local 1271.\n\nWhen World War II ended, the Municipality of Surrey purchased three Air Force Crash Wagons from the War Assets Commission, for $ 9,861.00. These were put into service at Cloverdale, White Rock and Port Kells. The fire department also received four portable trailer pumps from the Air Raid Precaution [A.R.P.]; one of these remains today at the City of Surrey Museum.\n\nOver the years, several cars and small trucks were modified to carry water, hose and other fire fighting equipment. The equipment was distributed among the eight established fire districts in Surrey. By the 1960s, Surrey began manufacturing their own fire pumpers at the Municipal Work Yards. Eleven of these trucks were manufactured and the last one produced is housed at the Surrey Museum. It is a 1972, International cab forward, 500-gpm Hale single-stage pump, triple combination pumper, painted fire engine red. The cost saving in producing these trucks, over the purchase of factory manufactured units, was approximately $10,000. In those days a factory unit was priced around $30,000, therefore, for every two constructed there was a saving sufficient to build the third.\n\nEarly personal protective equipment was very limited. Most fire fighters arriving at the fire scene wore ‘everyday’ type clothing; ‘full-length’ rubber coats and army helmets were added during the War by the A.R.P. Early fire fighters did not have breathing apparatus. The act of inhaling toxic smoke and fumes, gave these individuals the moniker of “Smoke eaters.”\n\nThe installation of fire hydrants, beginning in 1954, has increased the availability of water and reduced the need for pumps to draft water from wells, rivers, creeks and ditches. The first fire hydrant [Hyd. #1] is located at the south end of Pattullo Bridge on the east side of King George Highway.\n\nSurrey’s first Fire Boat, named “THE SURREY GUARDIAN” was purchased in 1968, to fight fires along the Fraser River. The Captains mastering this vessel were John Menunzio, Rudy Brieter and Bob McNabb. This boat was sold in 1972 in favour of a Ladder truck.\n\nCommunications have also become more effective over the years. Cloverdale Fire Brigade purchased the first siren in 1938. The first radio equipment was purchased in 1956. Alerters or stationary monitors were added during the 1960s and individual pagers were put into service during the 1980s. Today, Surrey Fire Department is the dispatch centre for White Rock, Langley City and Township, Pitt Meadows, Maple Ridge and Port Coquitlam fire departments.\n\nTRAINING ON SURREY FIRE DEPARTMENT\n\nPrior to February 1st 1966, Surrey Fire Department did not have a paid Training Officer, it was on that date Captain Al Cleaver became Surrey’s first Training Officer. He held the position until April 1971, when Captain Lorne Pearson became Training Officer.\n\nAt that time there were twelve fire halls in Surrey, four had paid staff and volunteers, the other eight halls were totally staffed with volunteers. Each hall trained on a regular, but individual basis. Captain Cleaver developed a schedule that encompassed the twelve fire halls being instructed in a standard manner.\n\nThe result was that four different halls received training Monday to Thursday evenings and two were trained on Sunday mornings. The remaining six halls received duplicate training the following week and all paid staff were trained on Monday to Thursday mornings.\n\nIn addition to training fire fighting personnel, a multitude of other duties were carried out by the training officers, such being personal development, developing pre-entrance exams, establishing a training manual, assisting volunteer halls in budget preparation, recruit training, developing public demonstrations, creating fire hall inventories, lecturing and training nurses and private industry staff, talking to school children and attending major fires to observe operations. A corollary to all this was ‘perform anything else the Fire Chief thought of!’\n\nA heavy mandate of high performance was established early within the Surrey Fire Department Training Branch and it is still carried out today with pride, as the acceptable standard.\n\nFIRE PREVENTION\n\nThe first fire protection by-law, [#1012 (1950)], for Surrey Fire Department was passed in 1950, this was a by-law for the administration and control of the fire department, it also contained clauses to enforce the control of burning and other fire prevention related concerns.\n\nPrior to the passing of By-law #1021, (1950), concerns related to life safety and fire prevention were at the jurisdiction of the Provincial Fire Marshall, burning permits were the responsibility of the B. C. Forest Service. Municipal Fire Marshall Ray Feather was appointed in 1952, his title was Fire Inspection Officer and Coordinating Officer for Surrey Fire Department.\n\nFeather was the only Fire Inspector until April 1, 1995, when Glen Orville Worden was hired. A third Inspector was hired on July 20, 1956, in the person of Cecil Giles Clake. Unfortunately, most of their time was occupied by oil burner inspections, writing fire permits, doing fire reports and miscellaneous other responsibilities incumbent to the operation and function of a developing fire department.\n\nDuring the 1960s changes began as a result of increased population and commercial development within Surrey. Staff was added to the Inspection Branch, the first being Ted Menun who was transferred from the position of fire fighter at Hall #2. In May 1973, Ted Menun was put in charge of the Inspection Branch and in 1986 he was promoted to Assistant Fire Chief, Chief Fire Prevention Officer.\n\nAt this time regular fire fighters were permitted to transfer to the Fire prevention Branch, on a temporary basis, to gain experience for their career development and bring fire fighting knowledge to the Fire Prevention Branch. [In those years the seniority list was a single fire department listing.\n\nPUBLIC EDUCATION\n\nBeginning in the 1980s and continuing until the new Millennium, Surrey developed a successful Public Education Branch, under the leadership of Public Education Officer Al Lonneberg, Al was a volunteer fire fighter at Hall #10 and was hired as a fulltime fire fighter on June 7th 1972. The Branch grew and functioned well with the use of numerous summer students during its two decades of operation.\n\nMany innovative fire safety educational aids were created, such as the famous “SIR – E – BEAVER” mascot, a Sir-E-Beaver talking robot and many customized Surrey Fire Department devices, teaching aids and brochures, directed to teaching children fire safety in Surrey schools.\n\nThe most costly fire loss in Surrey was the Fraser Surrey Docks fire in 1991, the loss at that fire was $25,000,000, the fire burned for one week.\n\nHALLS AND LOCATIONS\n\nHall # 1 – Was originally known as South Westminster Volunteer Fire Department, the department was formed on January 2nd 1946 and a fire hall was built at the corner of Scott Road and Pattullo Roads, near the present Scott road Skytrain Station. [Pattullo Road no longer exists]. Prior to 1946, a 250 gpm portable A.R.P. trailer pump was stored in a shed at Valley Lumber Yards {Beaver Lmbr. / Revy Lmbr.], across Scott Road from the fire hall location.\n\nThis trailer pump was towed to fires by John Pearson’s personal 1935 Chevrolet ½-ton pick-up. He was the local A.R.P. Warden at the time.\n\nThis was the first municipal fire hall built north of Sullivan. – West of King George Highway, the next closest fire hall was White Rock.

Charter members included: A. Powell, Alfred Bard, G. W. Pollard, H. Barge, Charles E. Montgomery, James E. Cook, John Menunzio and Glen Orville Worden.\n\nTo qualify for affiliation with the IAFF an area had to have seven members. In Surrey prior to May 1956, there were only five members, all employed at Surrey’s White Rock-Sunnyside Fire Hall. When John Menunzio and James Cook were hired full time at South Westminster in May 1956, Surrey Fire Department met the required number, enabling an application for International Charter of Unionism\n\nThe Charter of Affiliation has eight names, the final name being Glen Orville Worden. He was employed as a Surrey Oil Burner Inspector and was a member of C.U.P.E # 402, however, a change in his job classification in the early months of 1957, allowed him to transfer to the fire service. When the Charter of Affiliation was delivered to Surrey, A. ‘Red’ Powell and Alf Bard volunteered to be Representatives for the Union until an election could be held in the fall. This was important because the newly Chartered Union Local had to immediately apply to the Labour Relations Board of B. C. for Certification. This was applied for on June 10th 1957, by A. Powell, however on June 14th 1957, the application was opposed by the Municipality of Surrey on the basis of White Rock being in the process of incorporating as a City. Nevertheless, W. H. Sands, Chairman of the Labour Relations Board, granted Certification on June 25th 1957\n\nIn September 1957, the first election of officers for IAFF local 1271 was held. John Menunzio was elected President and Lorne Pearson was elected Secretary/Treasurer. Hector Wright, a Vancouver Fire Fighter who was the 6th district Vice President of the IAFF, delivered the oath of office at South Westminster Fire Hall.\n\nSURREY PROFESSIONAL FIRE FIGHTERS PIONEER ASSOCIATION\n\nThe Surrey Professional Fire Fighters Pioneer Association was formed on July 24th 1992, when eight retired Surrey fire fighters met for a luncheon meeting in Yic’s Restaurant at the corner of 104 Avenue and King George Highway in Whalley, Surrey. The members present at that meeting were; Alf Bard; Joe Clake; Ted Menun; Lorne Pearson; Denis Perry; Heinz Pflugrath; Alf Shephard and Graham Symonds. The first two named, Alf Bard and Joe Clake have passed away since that inaugural meeting.\n\nThe purpose or mandate of the S.P.F.F.P.A. is;\n\nTo harbor a continued rapport and social relationship between retired members of Surrey Fire Department.\n\nTo promote closer liaison between existing fire services and retired members.\n\nTo provide a medium whereby the good and welfare of retired persons and any problems may be freely and unofficially discussed and advice given and received.\n\nTo assist in the reduction of fire losses through promotion of fire prevention by education and deployment of individual attributes and skills.\n\nTo preserve the history of Surrey Fire Department and its members past, present and future.\n\nThe Surrey Professional Fire Fighters Pioneer Association has 41 regular members and 3 honorary members, since our beginning until July 1998, three members have died and only a few retired from Surrey Fire Department have decided not to become members.\n\nThe Latin motto of our Association is:\n\n‘VIRTUTE ET ARMIS, OTIUM CUM DIGNITATE.”\n\nTranslated into English this is:\n\n“BY VALOUR AND ARMS, LEISURE WITH DIGNITY.”\n\nThe meaning of this is:\n\nBy valour = the Maltese cross and the Fire Fighting profession.\n\nArms = fire fighting tools and equipment, shown on the logo.\n\nLeisure with dignity = retirement\n\nWe have a newsletter titled the REKINDLE , which is a fire fighting term meaning to start burning again after the fire was thought to have been extinguished.\n\nOur Association meets four times a year, although if necessary our constitution and by laws is structured to allow us to meet more often.\n\nExecutive members are:\n\nPresident, Ken Douglas\n\nVice President, Rick Crowe\n\nSecretary, Gerry Wilson\n\nTreasurer, Al Fisher\n\nThe first president of the Surrey Professional Fire Fighters Pioneer Association was C.J. “Ted” Menun"
