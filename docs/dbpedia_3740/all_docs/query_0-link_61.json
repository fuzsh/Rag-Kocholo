In addition to serving as the first responding unit for fire and EMS emergencies within the southwest area of the Township, the station houses specialty teams and equipment for heavy rescue operations, grass fire, dive operations, and command staffing. These specialty teams and equipment respond throughout the entire township on emergency scenes. Most notably, the station houses Ladder 91, a 100 foot aerial ladder which is dispatched on all fire alarms and reported structure fires and Rescue 91, a rescue engine equipped as the primary heavy rescue unit for auto accidents, building collapse, rope rescue efforts and more.\n\nSix firefighters are assigned to this station, providing fire, EMS, and water rescue services. The district primarily covers the eastern portions of the Township, including the Scioto River. Advance life support emergency response occurs on Medic 92 and fire response occurs on Engine 92.
