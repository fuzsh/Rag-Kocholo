        "text": "ACT Fire & Rescue (ACTF&R) works to protect life, property and the environment in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT).\n\nACTF&R has a long tradition of excellence in the protection of life, property and the environment of the ACT community and surrounding area. ACTF&R is made up of over 370 permanent firefighters, support staff, and over 500 community fire unit (CFU) volunteers.\n\nWe manage and respond to emergencies including:\n\nStructure Fires\n\nBush and Grass Fires\n\nVehicle Fires\n\nMotor Vehicle Accidents\n\nAutomatic Fire Alarms\n\nHazardous Material Incidents\n\nConfined Space Rescues\n\nTrench Rescues\n\nUrban Search and Rescue Operations\n\nAnimal Rescues\n\nVertical Rescues\n\nWe work with other emergency services to provide:\n\nMedical Assist Responses\n\nStorm Damage Mitigation\n\nBeing a firefighter is no ordinary job. The work is varied, challenging and rewarding. In addition to responding to emergencies, a firefighterâ€™s role entails a range of functions including:\n\nFire prevention and investigation;\n\nCommunity education and activities related to safety and prevention, including fire education for children (conducted in pre-schools, kindergartens, primary schools); working with diverse communities to raise awareness, educate and help minimise the impact of fire; and, providing assistance to the elderly, e.g. installation of smoke alarms in homes;\n\nEnsuring compliance with fire safety regulations during building approvals;\n\nCarrying out building inspections to prepare risk assessments and pre-incident plans;\n\nAttendance at fetes and other community events;\n\nThe provision of emergency safety information to specific neighbourhoods or areas;\n\nInspecting and assessing potential fire hazards;\n\nPre planning for incidents involving specific hazards, risks or events;\n\nScrutinising plans for proposed suburban developments to ensure safety of residents from bush and grass fire;\n\nUndertaking ongoing development and maintenance of skills and knowledge through regular training and study; and\n\nCleaning/maintenance of equipment, fire station and appliances. This includes core housekeeping duties such as cleaning the bathroom, kitchen, vacuuming etc.\n\nFirefighters often operate in challenging situations, including when people are injured or deceased.\n\nWhen attending incidents, firefighters will be required to comfort victims and provide first aid until the arrival of the ACT Ambulance Service (ACTAS). Firefighting is physically and psychologically demanding, especially during major emergencies.\n\nIt also involves quick thinking, team work and physical and mental endurance.\n\nGenerally, career firefighters work in a fire station in a crew supervised by a Station Officer. Several stations are ESA shared facilities with other emergency services. ACTF&R have fire stations strategically located around the ACT to enable quick response to incidents. We also staff an emergency communications centre.\n\nTo provide our emergency services on a 24/7 basis ACTF&R has four shifts (known as A, B, C & D Platoons). You will be transferred to a Platoon at a fire station following satisfactory completion of recruit training with future rotation opportunities.\n\nFirefighters are required to maintain good health and physical fitness.\n\nTo be a successful firefighter, you need a wide range of skills, knowledge and abilities. ACTF&R firefighters are ACT Public Sector (ACTPS) employees and we seek to employ people who reflect our professionalism and values, along with the diversity of our society.\n\nACTF&R seeks to employ fit, intelligent and motivated people with the following skills and attributes:\n\nPersonal resilience and an ability to work effectively in challenging situations;\n\nDemonstrated diverse work/life experiences and transferrable skills;\n\nAppreciation of the need to critically evaluate risk and adhere to safe work practices in situations that at times can be inherently dangerous;\n\nEffective and appropriate written and verbal communication skills;\n\nA commitment to service and helping others, and an interest and ability to engage with members of the public;\n\nUnderstanding of, and willingness to undertake the full range of firefighter duties including follow directions;\n\nThe ability to work shiftwork including nights, weekends and public holidays, flexibility in work locations within the ACT and a commitment to ongoing development;\n\nDemonstrate respect toward your fellow colleagues, the community and all others regardless of individual differences;\n\nWell-developed interpersonal skills and the capacity to work within, and contribute positively to, a small high performing team working in close proximity;\n\nThe ability to exercise self-discipline and use sound judgement in ensuring assigned tasks are completed to the required standard and within tight timeframes;\n\nA capacity to acquire new skills and demonstrated problem solving ability and\n\nDemonstrated commitment to teamwork, collaboration, professionalism and a strong work ethic.\n\nEnvironments firefighters are required to work in include:\n\nWorking at heights\n\nWorking in enclosed spaces\n\nWorking outdoors\n\nWorking in situations where you may see seriously injured people and/or fatalities\n\nWorking with a diverse range of people e.g. different ages, ethnic backgrounds etc.\n\nCarrying and operating equipment\n\nWorking 10 or 14 hour shifts"
