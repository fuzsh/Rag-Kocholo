        "text": "Chicago Fire Department Definitions\n\nAmbulance Assist Run/Call - A call in which basic or advanced EMS care is rendered to an ill or injured person.\n\nApparatus - The name given to fire engines, fire trucks, paramedic ambulance and other motorized equipment.\n\nArson - The crime of maliciously (or perhaps recklessly) setting fire to property, especially a dwelling. Punishable in various degrees, depending upon the circumstances.\n\nBackdraft - A fire phenomenon caused when heat and heavy smoke (unburned fuel particles) accumulate inside a compartment, depleting the available air. Then, when oxygen/air is re-introduced, completing the fire triangle and causing rapid combustion.\n\nBangor - This is a 50 foot, or larger, ladder that has \"tormenter poles\" to assist in the raising and to stabilize the sides. It is our largest stand-alone ladder.\n\nBank Down - What the smoke does as it fills a room, banks down to the floor, creating several layers of heat and smoke at different temperatures – the coolest being at the bottom.\n\nBattalion - A number of fire stations in a geographical area. The city is divided into 24 Battalions.\n\nBattalion Chief - The supervisor of the firehouses in the battalion and acts as incident commander for fires in his/her battalion.\n\nBLEVE - Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapor Explosion. Explosion of a pressure tank containing an overheated material when the vapor expansion rate exceeds the pressure relief capacity (e.g., steam boiler or propane tank). If the contents are flammable, the rapidly released vapor may react in a secondary fuel-air explosion.\n\nBox Alarm / Box Card - Developed from a card system which listed the companies that were due to respond on an alarm. This comes from the old practice of transmitting fire alarms through a telegraph system.\n\nBunkroom - A bedroom or sleeping area.\n\nCandidate - A new firefighter on employment probation (a period of time during which his or her skills are improved, honed, tested, and evaluated).\n\nCaptain - An officer responsible for their crew of firefighters as well the firehouse itself and all members on all shifts at their assigned firehouse.\n\nCharged Line - Filling or using a fire hose line that is full of water.\n\nChicago Bar - A forcible entry tool created in Chicago to assist in forcing of doors, bars etc.\n\nCockloft - Structural space above the ceiling and below the rafters, often connecting adjacent occupancies and permitting fire to spread laterally, often unseen.\n\nCollapse Zone - Estimated as an area one and a half times the height of the fire building where a wall may fall. Fireground operations should not be conducted within the collapse zone. Corners of the building are the safest place for operations.\n\nCrew - The group of personnel consisting of an officer, firefighters or paramedics assigned to a fire apparatus or ambulance.\n\nCrosslay - Arrangement of hose on an engine such that it can be quickly unloaded from either side of the apparatus; often pre-connected to a pump outlet and equipped with a suitable nozzle.\n\nDeck Gun - A large water nozzle attached to the top of the engine. Deck guns deliver larger amounts of water than hand-held hose.\n\nDefensive Operations - This is a fire ground strategy based on firefighter safety and the protection of exposures. The goal is to simply confine the fire to the building/area of origin. No aggressive interior firefighting operations take place in the defensive mode, usually due to safety concerns for entering the building.\n\nDistrict - Geographical areas comprised of numerous battalions. The city is divided into 5 districts, including the airports.\n\nDrill - Training during which an emergency is simulated and the trainees go through the steps of responding as if it were real, or practicing particular skills to enhance a member’s ability to perform the skill during an emergency.\n\nEMS - Emergency Medical Service.\n\nEngine - A motorized apparatus that has a pump, a 500-gallon water tank and hose. Often called a pumper.\n\nEngineer - The member who drives the fire engine during routine driving and during emergencies. Also operates the pumps to deliver water through the fire hoses.\n\nEvacuation - Removal of people from a dangerous area, in particular, a Hazmat incident, burning building, or other emergency. Also refers to act of removing firefighters from a structure in danger of collapsing.\n\nExposure - Property near fire that may become involved by transfer of heat or burning material from main fire, typically by convection or radiation. May range from 40 feet to several miles, depending on size and type of fire or explosion.\n\nExtra Alarm - A request by an incident commander for additional personnel and apparatus.\n\nExtrication - Removal of a trapped victim such as a vehicle extrication, confined space rescue, or trench rescue; sometimes using hydraulic spreader, Jaws of Life or other technical equipment.\n\nFire Academy - A location where candidates are trained as well as periodic training of the members of the department.\n\nFire Boat - A specialized watercraft and with pumps and nozzles designed for fighting shoreline and shipboard fires.\n\nFire Code - (Fire safety code) Regulations for fire prevention and safety involving flammables, explosives and other dangerous operations and occupancies.\n\nFire Escape - A building structure arranged outside to assist in safe evacuation of occupants during an emergency; may connect horizontally beyond a fire wall or vertically to a roof or (preferably) to the ground, perhaps with a counter-weighted span to deny access to intruders.\n\nFirefighter - The member who provides first aid to patients, uses the hose lines to deliver water to extinguish fires, makes hydrants, performs searches for victims and other physical work during an emergency. Also does the station cleaning and maintenance during daily station activities.\n\nFireground - The operational area at the scene of a fire; area in which incident commander is in control.
