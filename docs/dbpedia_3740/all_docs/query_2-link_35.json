        "text": "The Fire Officer is a supervisory role within the fire department. Fire officers provide the public “face” of fire departments by meeting with the community, in addition to their communication duties with the fire department crew.\n\nFire Officers serve a leadership function within their fire departments.\n\nDecision making and office administration\n\nFire Officers are responsible for decision-making. This means that the Fire Officer will need to make decisions about the safest way to rescue people from a fire and the best way to handle fighting the fire. Coordinating rescue efforts and strategies for firefighting fall upon the shoulders of the Fire Officer.\n\nFire Officers also provide administrative functions for the fire department. They will be the ones who handle the company correspondence, maintaining office records, recording minutes for fire department meetings, and ordering supplies. The Fire Officer might draft public notices for the Fire Chief or Deputy to sign, or compose department memos and letters.\n\nFire Officers work with their fire departments to ensure that all firefighters are trained and all equipment is maintained on a regular schedule. Fire departments will need to be current on their training, and the Fire Officer is responsible for all training within the department.\n\nFire Officers represent the fire department when addressing the public. This means that when schools or other organizations visit the fire department, the Fire Officer will be the one who leads the tour and answers questions.\n\nMaintaining fire safety\n\nFire Officers serve as a knowledge source for fire safety precautions and current fire safety building requirements. They will do regular fire safety checks of the fire department and on-site locations. Sometimes, Fire Officers will be called upon to assist the firefighters at a scene. It is important that a Fire Officer stays current on firefighting techniques and procedures as well.\n\nFire Officers are responsible for the internal organization of the fire department. It is their job to make sure that everything runs smoothly at the fire department and that every team member knows their roles and responsibilities.\n\nThe roles and responsibilities of Fire Officers might vary from department to department, but the Fire Officer understands the needs of their departments and works with the public for education and announcements."
