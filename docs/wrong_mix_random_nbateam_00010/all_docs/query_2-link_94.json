        "text": "Dead Men’s Propaganda: Ideology and Utopia in Comparative Communications Studies\n\nDate to be announced\n\nWho were the key pioneers in the formation of comparative communications between the 1920s – 1950s, and how do their legacies of scholarship and practice inform the contemporary global landscapes of news reporting on war and the dissemination of propaganda?\n\nExploring Terhi Rantanen’s new book, When Men Fought Propaganda Wars: Ideology and Utopia in Early Comparative Communications Research, this panel will examine how comparative communications research, from its very beginning, can be understood as governed by the Mannheimian concepts of ideology and utopia and the power play between them. The close relationship between these two concepts resulted in a bias in knowledge production in comparative communications research, contributed to dominant narratives of generational conflicts, and to the demarcation of Insiders and Outsiders.\n\nBy focusing on a generation at the forefront of comparative communications at this pivotal time, this book uses detailed archival research and case studies to challenge dominant orthodoxies in the intellectual histories of communication studies.\n\nSpeakers: Professor Bingchun Meng, Professor Jeff Pooley, Professor Terhi Rantanen, Dr Marsha Siefert and Dr Wendy Willems.\n\nThis event is hosted by LSE Press.\n\nTechnocolonialism: when technology for good can be harmful\n\nDate to be announced\n\nIn this talk, Professor Mirca Madianou will put forward the notion of technocolonialism which she has been developing to explain the ways that digital innovation, automation and data practices in the humanitarian sector revitalize colonial legacies. Technocolonialism refers to the convergence of digital developments with humanitarian structures, state power and market forces and the extent to which they reinvigorate and rework colonial genealogies. Technocolonialism shifts the attention to the constitutive role that data and digital innovation play in entrenching power asymmetries in the global context.\n\nDrawing on eight years of research in the aid sector, Professor Madianou observes that colonial genealogies are reworked by extracting value from the data of affected communities; by experimenting with untested technologies in humanitarian settings; and by materializing racial discrimination and dehumanizing suffering.\n\nSpeaker: Professor Mirca Madianou (Goldsmiths, University of London).\n\nChair: TBC.\n\nThe Last Human Job: AI, Depersonalization and the Industrial Clock\n\nDate to be announced\n\nIn this public lecture, Pugh explains how we have ended up in a moment in which machines have time for people, while human workers rush by, bent to the dictates of the industrial clock, and maps out its implications for the future of our social health. Critics commonly warn about three primary hazards of AI – job disruption, bias, and surveillance/privacy concerns. Yet the conventional story of AI’s dangers is missing a vital issue and blinding us to its role in a cresting “depersonalization crisis.” If we are concerned about increasing loneliness and social fragmentation, then we need to reckon with how technologies enable or impede human connection. Based on five years of interviews and observations with more than 100 people employed in humane interpersonal jobs, as well as the administrators and engineers overseeing and systematizing this work, Pugh identifies what these jobs have in common as “connective labor.” Pugh argues that the degradation of connective labor serves as a justification for its automation, part of the way socio-emotional AI is sold.\n\nSpeaker: Professor Allison Pugh (John Hopkins University).\n\nChair: Professor Sonia Livingstone.\n\nWronged: The Weaponization of Victimhood\n\nDate to be announced\n\nWhy is being a victim such a potent identity today? Who claims to be a victim, and why? How have such claims changed in the past century? Who benefits and who loses from the struggles over victimhood in public culture? In this timely and incisive book, Professor Lilie Chouliaraki shows how claiming pain is about claiming power: who deserves to be protected as a victim and who should be punished as a perpetrator. She argues that even if suffering is universal, this \"politics of pain\" is deeply embedded within power relations and ultimately privileges the voices of the powerful over those of the powerless.\n\nSpeakers: Professor Lilie Chouliaraki.\n\nChair: TBC.\n\nAuthoritarian Populism and Media Freedom | LSE Festival\n\nTuesday 11 June 2024 at 5.00pm to 6.00pm\n\nIn-person and online public event\n\nGreat Hall, Marshall Buidling\n\nHow did the Trump administration capture one of the world’s most important public service news networks, The Voice of America? How did the BBC, an exemplary public service broadcaster, end up being accused of bias towards the privileged and the ruling elites?\n\nJoin our expert speakers to examine the disconcerting dynamic between authoritarian populism and public service media - from the politicisation of public service media, beginning with Trump's presidency in the US and Boris Johnson's government in the UK, to the unremitting threats of democratic backsliding facing journalists today.\n\nSpeakers: Alan Rusbridger, Dr Damian Tambini and Dr Kate Wright.\n\nChair: Professor Bart Cammaerts.\n\nWatch the replay.\n\nReport Launch | LSE Common Sense Digital Citizenship Curriculum Evaluation\n\nTuesday 11 June 2024 at 6.30pm to 8.00pm\n\nPublic event - open to all. Drinks reception to follow\n\nLSE Theatre, Centre Building\n\nAre certain school and familial environments better able to offset and combat digital dangers while others ignore the potential harms of screen-time, AI, deep-fakes, disinformation and false advertising? Which strategies work best to strengthen 6-16 year old's digital citizenship? Funded by DSIT's Media Literacy Programme, our team in the LSE Department of Media and Communications partnered with non-profit stakeholder Common Sense Media in an independent evaluation of the effectiveness of their Digital Citizenship Curriculum.\n\nAt this inclusive and critical launch event for the project’s evaluation report, we discuss the findings of a year-long study exploring changes in students’ digital citizenship, media literacy and dispositions towards misinformation and disinformation after the teaching of the Common Sense Media curriculum. We will outline our key findings about the best ways to strengthen media literacy and resistance to disinformation, and reveal the patterns emerging from our evaluation.\n\nFind out more about the LSE Common Sense digital citizenship curriculum evaluation.\n\nSpeakers: Dr Fiona Abades Barclay and Professor Shakuntala Banaji.\n\nChair: Dr Nick Anstead.\n\nA Year of Elections: Power and Politics in 2024 | LSE Festival\n\nMonday 10 June 2024 at 6.30pm to 7.45pm\n\nIn-person and online public event\n\nGreat Hall, Marshall Buidling\n\nThis year people around the world are going to the polls. What have been the surprises and takeaways from election results so far, and what is still to come? Our panel will explore some of the issues coming to the fore in this bumper year for politics as well as the implications of key outcomes.\n\nSpeakers: Dr Nick Anstead, Professor Mukulika Banerjee, Professor Sara Hobolt and Bill Neely.\n\nChair: Professor Larry Kramer.\n\nWatch the replay.\n\nTech Tantrums: When Tech Meets Humanity\n\nWednesday 5 June 2024 at 6.30pm to 8.00pm\n\nIn-person and online public event\n\nOld Theatre, Old Building\n\nAI is poised to supercharge its impact on almost every aspect of economic, public and personal life. Tech leaders in Silicon Valley believe that AI poses an existential threat to humanity even as they enter an arms race to be ’the ruler of the world”. This year 50% of the world’s population go to the polls, without a single party offering a vision of how they will ride, contain or regulate the wave of change that AI will bring.\n\nIn this talk, Beeban Kidron, best known for her global impact on tech regulation to benefit children, will set out why issues around AI must not be left to tech experts and unaccountable corporations.\n\nSpeakers: Baroness Beeban Kidron.\n\nChair: Professor Sonia Livingstone.\n\nWatch the replay.\n\nDivest! The History and Politics of a Demand\n\nTuesday 4 June 2024 at 5.30pm to 7.30pm\n\nIn-person public event\n\nSheikh Zayed Theatre, Cheng Kin Ku Building\n\nThis panel brings together scholars, experts, practitioners, and organisers who have investigated how financial investments can be entangled with human rights abuses, the arms trade, and climate breakdown.\n\nTaking its point of departure in a just-released report prepared by LSE students and staff, the panel will shed light on how such entanglements can be traced–and place calls for divestment within a broader historical and political context.\n\nSpeakers: Dr Shahd Hammouri, Dr Dena Qaddumi, Andrew Feinstein, Katie Fallon, Peter Frankental, Dr Mahvish Ahmad, Dr Milli Lake and Professor Fawaz A. Gerges.\n\nThis event is hosted by the Department of Sociology.\n\nThe Sixth Suspect: Stephen Lawrence, Investigative Journalism and Racial Inequality\n\nThursday 16 May 2024 at 6.30pm to 8.00pm\n\nIn-person and online public event\n\nOld Theatre, Old Building\n\nIn June 2023, a major BBC investigation led by BBC News reporter Daniel De Simone produced new evidence that revealed the identity of a previously unnamed key suspect in the April 1993 racist murder of Black teenager Stephen Lawrence by a gang of 5-6 white men in Eltham, South East London that changed policing and race relations in Britain.\n\nIn his first public talk, BBC correspondent Daniel De Simone will offer previously unheard insights into his two-year investigation, how the sixth suspect was identified, his methods and findings, with responses by a panel of experts drawn from academia and politics. The discussion also allows for an exploration of the potential of contemporary investigative journalism practices in uncovering historical institutional failings and intervening in structural racial inequalities.\n\nSpeakers: Daniel De Simone, Ann-Marie Cousins and Clive Nwonka.\n\nChair: Professor Shakuntala Banaji.\n\nThis event is hosted by LSE International Inequalities Institute.\n\nWatch the replay here.\n\nDigital Media Use in Early Childhood: Birth to Six\n\nTuesday 7 May 2024 at 4.00pm to 5.15pm\n\nShaw Library, Old Building\n\nDrinks reception to follow\n\nJoin us to celebrate the book launch of Digital media use in early childhood with the co-authors as they be outline key arguments in the book, and reflect on a child rights-informed approach to early years’ digital activities and screen time.\n\nThe easy interface of touchscreen technologies like tablets and smartphones has enabled children to access the digital world from a very young age. But while some commentators are enthusiastic about how this can open a new world for fun, learning, and developing digital skills, others see the dangers of yet more screens, inauthentic play, and time spent isolated with electronic babysitters that detract from interaction with parents and learning social skills. Taking five as the age when children transition into formal education, the book draws on a three-year research project examining the realities of under six-year-olds' experiences of these technologies in the UK and Australia.\n\nSpeakers: Professor Sonia Livingstone, Susan Danby, Lelia Green and Brian O’Neill.\n\nThis event is co-hosted by Digital Futures for Children Centre (DFC) and 5Rights Foundation.\n\nDigital Cities for Humans or for Profit?\n\nMonday 18 March 2024 at 6.30pm to 8.00pm (in-person and online event)\n\nAuditorium, Centre Building\n\nPublic event - open to all. Drinks reception to follow.\n\nOn the occasion of Professor Myria Georgiou’s book publication, Being Human in Digital Cities, this panel brings together experts on digital urbanism and on digital justice to address from their different perspectives a number of questions: What are the values driving digital change and ‘smartcitization’? Who speaks and who is silenced when digital cities are planned and realised in the name of urban humanity’s progress? Can we imagine alternative digital futures in cities torn by inequalities and divisions?\n\nThis event is co-hosted by LSE Cities.\n\nWatch the replay here.\n\nChina’s image building in Africa through media development assistance: The role of pay-TV company StarTimes in China’s public diplomacy​\n\nTuesday 6 February 2024 at 4.00pm to 5.30pm\n\nSilverstone Room, PEL.7.01A\n\nDepartmental event - open to all LSE students (including doctoral and Masters students) and staff. Refreshments will be served before the seminar.\n\nIn this seminar, Dr Angela Lewis discusses her research examining the phenomenal growth over recent years of StarTimes, a Chinese pay-TV company with around 30 million subscribers providing satellite television to 20 African countries. The broadcaster, whose markets include demographic groups deemed uneconomic by Western television providers, combines entertainment such as Chinese drama and Kung Fu content dubbed into African languages with Chinese state programming, thus making the station at least partially a public diplomacy instrument. At the same time, the channel provides new indigenous language channels, widened access to television in rural areas, and sponsors African soccer brands.\n\nSpeaker: Dr Angela Lewis (Xian-Jiatong Liverpool University).\n\nChair: Dr Simidele Dosekun.\n\nFind out more here.\n\nWhy Is It Worth Staying Curious About Racial Capitalism?\n\nWednesday 31 January 2024 at 6.30pm to 7.30pm (in person and online event)\n\nOld Theatre, Old Building\n\nThere has been a huge increase in discussion of racial capitalism, linked both to a revisiting of anticapitalist analysis and of the legacies of colonial violence. However, the framing of racial capitalism can become a way to freeze analysis - as if the same circuit of dispossession and violence continues across time and space and, with the desperate implication, for always. In this talk, Professor Gargi Bhattacharyya considers the changing violences of racial capitalism and considers how can we use this language to identify emerging patterns of racialised dispossession, and what might we then do about it.\n\nSpeaker: Professor Gargi Bhattacharyya (UCL, Sarah Parker Remond Centre, Institute of Advanced Studies).\n\nChair: Professor Bart Cammaerts.\n\nWatch the replay here.\n\nDigital Futures for Children (DFC) and 5Rights Foundation\n\nWednesday 17 January 2024 at 3.00pm to 5.00pm\n\nSilverstone Room, PEL 7.01A\n\nDepartmental event - open to all LSE students (including doctoral and Masters students) and staff. This event will be followed by a reception.\n\nThis joint LSE and 5Rights research centre supports an evidence base for advocacy, facilitates dialogue between academics and policymakers and amplifies children's voices, following the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child’s General comment No. 25. Please join us to discuss the priorities for the DFC research agenda and to identify shared interests and future possibilities.\n\nSpeakers: Professor Sonia Livingstone, Baroness Beeban Kidron (5Rights), Gerison Lansdown (DFC Advisory Board) and Professor Bart Cammaerts.\n\nTo identify how to embed children’s rights in the digital environment, especially in legislation, regulation and policy, we’re keen to discuss the role of evidence in advocacy, likely conceptual and methodological challenges, and comparative and international perspectives. The main part of the meeting will be interactive to hear from all participants, followed by a round table discussion.\n\nMedical Influencers: What Happens When Doctors Become Social Media Celebrities?\n\nTuesday 28 November 2023 at 11.00am to 11.30am\n\nShaw Library, Old Building\n\n‘‘Medfluencers’’ represent a growing niche within the ever-expanding influencer industry. For many, this is a decidedly positive development as it is widely assumed that accredited expertise is a remedy for and antidote to health misinformation. But there are downsides to the rise of ‘‘medfluencers’’. In this talk Dr Rachel O’Neill examines what the entry of doctors to the ranks of social media celebrity might mean for the profession and for public health.\n\nSpeaker: Dr Rachel O'Neill.\n\nRegister and find out more about LSE Research Showcase here.\n\nChaitybhumi: Film Screening and Q&A with Director\n\nTuesday 24 October 2023 at 6.30pm to 8.30pm (in-person)\n\nSilverstone Room, PEL.7.01A\n\nDepartmental film screening - open to all LSE students (including doctoral and Masters students) and staff. Limited seating available, entrance on a first come basis.\n\nChaitybhumi brings to light the history and cultural politics of how people commemorate December 6 at Chaityabhumi and what is the relevance of this public event in contemporary India. It explores how the Dalit community comes together to honour this day and the political implications it holds for their identity and empowerment. The documentary examines the complex interplay of caste and public space politics in Mumbai city.\n\nJoin us for this departmental screening and Q&A with the director.\n\nSpeaker: Somnath Waghmare (Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) Mumbai).\n\nChair: Professor Shakuntala Banaji.\n\nConspiracy Theories, Disinformation, and Communication Rituals: Reconsidering the Nature of Motivations in Motivated Reasoning\n\nMonday 16 October 2023, 4.00pm to 5.30pm\n\nSilverstone Room, PEL.7.01A\n\nDepartmental Seminar - open to all LSE students (including doctoral and Masters students) and staff\n\nPolitical communication scholars often draw on cognitive science models and methods when explaining political polarization. In general, they find that people cling stubbornly to factually unsound beliefs, despite corrections. In this seminar, Livingston argues that the cognitive science approach, while insightful in many ways, fails to specify the nature of motivation in directional reasoning. Rather than look to brain function, we must instead look to people’s search for meaning and purpose (motivation properly understood) in societies wrought by extreme social and economic inequality and the disruptions these conditions bring. The crisis of democracy is the consequence of social anxieties emerging from lived experiences that lead not only “deaths of despair”, but also to the embrace of “deep stories” that, while not necessarily socially salubrious, serve to affirm meaning, purpose, and identity. Drawing on the communication (or media) ritual research literature, Livingston argues that meaningful narratives are best thought of as deep stories – stories that offer emotional truths that are sustained by communication rituals.\n\nSpeaker: Professor Steven Livingston (George Washington University).\n\nRespondent: Dr Nick Anstead.\n\nChair: Professor Sonia Livingstone.\n\nThe Tragedy of Heterosexuality in Global Context\n\nTuesday 12 September 2023 at 3.00pm to 4.30pm\n\nIn The Tragedy of Heterosexuality, Jane Ward critiques one of the basic premises of the mainstream LGBT rights movement—that heterosexuality is easier than queerness—by asking for whom, and under what conditions, is straightness easier. Drawing from ethnographic field work, archival research, and cultural studies methods, Ward examines the 20th century emergence of a “heterosexual repair industry”—a self-help empire designed to romanticize and ease heterosexual misery while eliding attention to heteropatriarchy and the queer, feminist interventions poised to undo it. In this talk, Ward takes her analysis in new directions, pointing to the global implications of heterosexual misery by analyzing the global “anti-gender” (or “gender critical”) movement and the collective anxiety about gender and sexuality that animates it. Ward conceptualizes “gender critical” projects as expressions of heteroparanoia and psychic dissonance aimed at reconciling the paradoxes of modern heterosexuality, and offers a feminist assessment of these projects' trajectories.\n\nSpeaker: Professor Jane Ward (University of California Santa Barbara).\n\nChair: Dr Rachel O'Neil.\n\nFind out more here.\n\n#MeToo in the Media: survivors, believability, and emotional labour | LSE Festival\n\nSaturday 17 June 2023 at 4.00pm to 5.00pm (in-person and online event)\n\nMarshall Building, LSE\n\nIs the #MeToo movement about affecting change, or simply about visibility? More than five years after the first Weinstein allegations appeared in news headlines, #MeToo continues to impact our media landscape, but we should not ignore the impact this movement has had on the individual people caught in the glare of the media spotlight. Which survivors are seen as believable in the media? What is the emotional labour required of survivors whose experiences of trauma are made so very public?\n\nOur unique panel will look at these mediated struggles for visibility, authenticity, and recognition around #MeToo, drawn from their own lived experience, media practice, and academic research.\n\nSpeakers: Rowena Chiu, Kathryn Claire Higgins, Winnie M Li and Lucia Osborne-Crowley.\n\nChair: Professor Sarah Banet-Weiser.\n\nFind out more here. Watch the replay.\n\nMedia Futures: The Department of Media and Communications 20th Anniversary Conference\n\nThursday 15 - Friday 16 June 2023, LSE\n\nWe are living in turbulent and increasingly dangerous times which are in large part defined and influenced by the very thing we study and research, namely media, communication infrastructures, algorithms, and data. Faced with an uncertain future, we can discern both dystopian and optimistic scenarios. In terms of the former we need critique, as well as ethical norms and values to validate those critiques. Regarding the latter, alternative imaginaries of hope, social justice and solidarity need to be developed or indeed rejuvenated.\n\nIn our 20th anniversary conference, we aim to address both the critiques of the present and to consider and imagine alternative pathways. Papers will be aligned with our four research themes: Media Culture and Identities; Histories and Futures; Media, Participation and Politics; and Communication, Technology, Rights and Justice.\n\nFind out more about the conference here.\n\nThe Power of \"Good Enough\" | LSE Festival\n\nWednesday 14 June 2023 at 6.30pm to 7.30pm (in-person and online event)\n\nMarshall Building, LSE\n\nOver the past 30 years, there has been a substantial increase in the percentage of people who feel they need to be perfect. The pressure we put on ourselves to be perfect and the expectations we feel from others and society-at-large can lead to depression, burnout and other mental illnesses, particularly amongst younger generations. How do we escape this perfection trap and embrace the idea of “good enough”?\n\nSpeakers: Dr Thomas Curran, Adrienne Herbert and Dr Rachel O'Neill.\n\nChair: Dr Grace Lordan.\n\nOrganised by the Department of Psychological and Behavioural Science (PBS).\n\nFind out more here. Watch the replay.\n\nGreenwashing, carbon capitalism and the role of PR\n\nFriday 5 May 2023 at 1.00pm to 2.30pm (online)\n\nThe climate crisis is an existential threat for all who inhabit the planet. For marginalised regions, nations and social groups, the intensity of the threat has been felt more keenly than by those who are already privileged. These inequalities are due not only to the political economy of climate change mitigation and adaptation, but also to the media and communications ecology that surrounds and supports climate discourse in variable ways. Research on media representations of climate change effects has already demonstrated the ways in which coverage privileges western-driven understandings of climate, nature, and human life, and stops short of calling for the fundamental change that is required for planetary survival.\n\nIn this panel discussion, we add to this work by exploring how the public relations profession has facilitated climate narratives that obfuscate, while perpetuating technodeterministic solutionism that protects corporate ambition and sacrifices the collective good. We contrast such anti-planetary work with a discussion of how public relations strategies and tactics are used by activist groups that fight greenwashing and carbon capitalism to create genuine change that supports, rather than endangers, our collective futures.\n\nSpeakers: Melissa Aronczyk (Rutgers University), Clea Bourne (Goldsmiths, University of London), Professor Benedetta Brevini, Paulina Magaña Carbajal (El Poder del Consumidor) and Jotham Keleino (Evangelical Lutheran Church of PNG).\n\nChair: Professor Lee Edwards.\n\nFind out more here.

Drinks reception to follow.\n\nDigital platforms are where we live out much of our lives, including our politics. But are the digital platforms we have today, and the business models that drive them, good for political life? And even if they are good for some dimensions of politics, for example mobilization, do they work as well for building solidarity and for forming long-term campaigns of progressive political change?\n\nWhat weight should we give to the fears of polarization online versus the more positive potentials of the digital? And differences of scale matter here between urban politics and the national or global? Finally, if we do have concerns about our current digital platforms, how do we build better ones? Who should do this, and what sorts of resource will they need? Our speakers who have all written books highly relevant to these topics will address and debate these urgent questions.\n\nSpeakers: Professor Myria Georgiou, Miranda Hall (The Independent Workers of Great Britain), Dr James Muldoon (University of Exeter), Dr Alex Williams (University of East Anglia) and Dr Alison Winch (Goldsmiths, University of London).\n\nChair: Professor Nick Couldry.\n\nCo-organiser: Professor Jeremy Gilbert, University of East London.\n\nListen to the podcast recording.

There are growing public and expert concerns that social media platforms can be harmful to young people with vulnerable mental health. Do algorithms make things worse? Can social and peer-to-peer interaction on the internet worsen mental health difficulties? Most importantly, what is the role of digital skills in mediating wellbeing outcomes?\n\nJoin us for the launch of our new report exploring how digital skills improve or undermine the wellbeing of European young people with lived experiences of diverse mental health difficulties. As part of the EU-funded Youth Skills (ySKILLS) project, we present the calls for action, underpinned by the findings and highlighting the voices and concerns of young people in Norway and the UK.\n\nSpeakers: June Lowery-Kingston (European Commission), Leen d'Haenens (KU Leuven), Tine Jensen (University of Oslo), Mariya Stoilova, Line Indrevoll Stänicke (University of Oslo).\n\nChair: Professor Elisabeth Staksrud (University of Oslo).\n\nCo-organiser: Youth Skills (ySKILLS).\n\nFind out more here.\n\nRepresenting Black British History on the Screen\n\nWednesday 26 October 2022, 6.30-8.30pm\n\nCLM.4.02, Clement House, 4th floor\n\nThis event comprises of a screening of the ‘Lovers Rock’ episode part of the Small Axe’s series that Steve McQueen produced for the BBC in 2020. Instead of emphasising Black suffering, this episode was often framed as a celebration of Black joy. The screening is followed by a discussion on the tension between commemoration and celebration in representing Black British history on the screen.\n\nWe welcome students, alumni, and staff to celebrate Blackness through discussion, reflection, and open dialogue.\n\nSpeakers: Dr Suzanne Temwa Gondwe Harris and Dr Clive Nwonka (UCL).\n\nChair: Dr Wendy Willems.\n\nFind out more here.\n\nLSE Festival 2022: The Age of Refugees\n\nSaturday 18 June 2022 11am - 12pm\n\nMarshall Building, LSE\n\nThe uprooting of refugees from Ukraine reflects the latest phase in the ongoing and intensified age of forced migration.\n\nOver the past decades, and across continents, numerous refugee “crises” have led to the explosion of the global refugee population, which has more than doubled in the last ten years.\n\nAs so many are forced to leave their homes, not all refugees gain the same level of visibility, welcome, and recognition. What are the consequences for the lives of those who move and those who receive them? How do media representations of refugees affect their reception? And how do refugees use digital media to themselves tell their stories of uprooting and migration?\n\nSpeakers: Abdulrahman Bdiwi, Professor Myria Georgiou, Dr Eva Polonska-Kimunguyi and Rob Sharp.\n\nChair: Dr Omar Al-Ghazzi.\n\nFind out more here.\n\nICA Pre-conference 2022: Patriarchal Worlds, Feminist Networks, and the Conjuncture\n\nThursday 26 - Monday 30 May 2022\n\nParis, France\n\nThe visibility and currency of popular, post and neoliberal feminisms seem to be thriving. Ideas and sentiments such as feminist solidarity, mutual aid, and care have surfaced and been reinvigorated, particularly in the wake of the pandemic. Yet, at the very same time, we have seen the rise and increasing visibility of reactionary forces including misogynoir, anti-feminisms, and anti-gender movements. This ICA pre-conference will provide a forum to discuss these contemporary developments within global patriarchies.\n\nOrganisers: Professor Sarah Banet-Weiser, Professor Jo Littler, Professor Shani Orgad, Dr Catherine Rottenberg and Professor Rosalind Gill.\n\nView the call for papers and submission guidelines here, and here for details on the ICA pre-conference.\n\nEpistemic Media and Communication Rights and Justice in a Digital Age\n\nFriday 20 May 2022, 10am-6.30pm\n\nThe future is always unknown but at times it seems more difficult to imagine than others. Certainly, we are living in times when visions of the future feel dystopic, whether in political or technological realms. But how do we approach studying the future?\n\nThis research symposium brings together media professionals and academics to examine the idea of the future in its affective and conceptual sense within the context of the Middle East and North Africa. Panels engage with questions such as: What are the future trends in Arab media? What media forms and technologies mediate the future, and how? How do we navigate histories of, and past intellectual debates about, political futures? How do we study a fickle concept like the future from the vantage point of the Middle East and North Africa?\n\nThis symposium is organised by the LSE Middle East Centre and forms a key component of the research project Arab News Futures, led by Dr Omar Al-Ghazzi and Dr Abeer Al-Najjar (American University of Sharjah).\n\nView the programme here.\n\nWar, Death and Mediation\n\nTuesday 10 May 2022, 5-6.30pm (hybrid event), 6.30-7.30pm drinks reception\n\nGraham Wallas Room, Old Building, LSE\n\nDepartmental Seminar - Open to all LSE students and staff\n\nToday we live in a society of hyper mediated death. War in Ukraine has brought death to the centre of social and political life in Europe, as well as elsewhere in the world. As a phenomenon, hyper mediation of death is anything but neutral social or cultural phenomenon. It touches upon profound ethical, moral and political questions related to a variety of issues including hierarchies associated with the value of life as well as questions concerning whose suffering and death are worth public mourning or who can claim hero or witness positions in the current communication environment shaped by information warfare. In this highly digitalized media war, death is not only present, but weaponized at multiple levels. This condition invites scholarship to examine issues of belonging, solidarity and compassion, but also instrumentalization, manipulation or even banalization of death in the present society characterized by ubique digital media saturation.\n\nSpeakers: Professor Mirca Madianou (Goldsmiths College, University of London), Dr Tal Morse (LSE PhD alumni, Hadassah Academic College, University of Bath) and Dr Johanna Sumiala (LSE and University of Helsinki).\n\nOrder Dr Sumiala’s new book on the topic Mediated Death (Polity).\n\nOrder Dr Morse's latest book The Mourning News: Reporting Violent Death in a Global Age (Peter Lang).\n\nView event details here.\n\nCommunicative Cities Research Network Symposium 2022: Communication, Isolation, and Reconnection in the (Post-)Pandemic City\n\nThursday 24 - Friday 25 March 2022 (hybrid event)\n\nGraham Wallas Room, 5th floor, Old Building, LSE\n\nThe CCRN 2022 Symposium focuses on the communicative configurations and transformations of the (post-)pandemic city. Cities across the world have experienced the pandemic differentially but acutely, with abrupt interruptions of their economic and cultural life and with physical isolation resetting conditions for urban communication. As cities across the world come out of and change because of the Covid-19 pandemic, physical isolation, collective trauma, and fears of consequent crises cast their shadows over urban life. While cities look ahead into diverse and wide-ranging challenges for their futures, urban communication is at the heart of many of those challenges.\n\nView event details here.\n\nConfidence Culture\n\nWednesday 23 March 2022, 6-7.30pm (hybrid event), 7.30-8.30pm drinks reception\n\nAuditorium, LSE\n\nIn Confidence Culture, Professors Shani Orgad and Rosalind Gill argue that imperatives directed at women to “love your body” and “believe in yourself” imply that psychological blocks hold women back rather than entrenched social injustices. Interrogating the prominence of confidence in contemporary discourse about body image, workplace, relationships, motherhood, and international development, Orgad and Gill draw on Foucault’s notion of technologies of self to demonstrate how “confidence culture” demands of women near-constant introspection and vigilance in the service of self-improvement. They argue that while confidence messaging may feel good, it does not address structural and systemic oppression. Rather, confidence culture suggests that women—along with people of color, the disabled, and other marginalized groups—are responsible for their own conditions. Rejecting confidence culture’s remaking of feminism along individualistic and neoliberal lines, Orgad and Gill explore alternative articulations of feminism that go beyond the confidence imperative.\n\nSpeakers: Dr Katherine Angel, Professor Rosalind Gill, Professor Pumla Dineo Gqola and Professor Shani Orgad.\n\nChair: Dr Rachel O'Neill.\n\nOrder Confidence Culture here.\n\nView the recording and event details here.\n\nPublic service broadcasting in its second century\n\nWednesday 2 March 2022, 6.30-7.30pm (online event)\n\nThe BBC is expected to provide programmes that meeting the needs of diverse audiences and to demonstrate ‘professional skill and editorial integrity’ and it must do so in ways that encourage public understanding. Yet the future of the BBC and its public service remit are under constant scrutiny with multiple new entrants in the news and entertainment market and with changes in the way audiences, especially young people, consume content. Co-sponsored by LSE’s Department of Media and Communications and the Media, Communication and Cultural Studies Association - MeCCSA - Policy Network, the BBC’s Director General Tim Davie and Baroness Minouche Shafik will discuss issues such as the prominence of public service providers in the face of competitive threats from video-on-demand providers, the BBC’s future financial sustainability and opportunities for the BBC created by digital technologies.\n\nSpeakers: Tim Davie, CBE.\n\nChair: Baroness Minouche Shafik.\n\nView the recording and event details here.\n\nEVENT CANCELLED: Transnational Black Femininities and Feminisms: A Conversation\n\nWednesday 16 February 2022, 6-7.30pm (online event)\n\nHow do black women in the global South see themselves and fashion identities in the context of contemporary neoliberal globalization, US cultural dominance, and deeply historicized structures, and feelings, about race and class? How do they navigate 'feminism'? What does transnational feminist cultural studies offer us as an approach to understanding and representing such women's lives and images and narratives of self?\n\nDr Simidele Dosekun and Dr Rachel Afi Quinn (University of Houston) will be in conversation about their recently published books, Being La Dominicana: Race and Identity in the Visual Culture of Santo Domingo (University of Illinois Press, 2021) and Fashioning Postfeminism: Spectacular Femininity and Transnational Culture (University of Illinois Press, 2020).\n\nDigital technologies and mental health vulnerabilites in adolescence\n\nWednesday 15 December 2021, 9-10am (online event)\n\nThe report examines the relationship between digital technologies and mental health in adolescents made vulnerable by pre-existing mental health problems.\n\nPublic and policy debates often link rising rates of adolescents’ mental health problems to increasing internet use. But these debates have not always been rigorously grounded in evidence concerning both possible benefits and harms. There is a gap in understanding between those who are experts in mental health and those with expertise in the culture, political economy and regulation of the digital environment, hence many questions remain. Can adolescents’ internet use increase the risk of poor mental health and what aspects of ‘the internet’ matter? Can digital technologies support adolescents’ mental health, whether by placing barriers on the pathway to harm or by introducing online help?\n\nIn answering these questions, we draw on a scoping review of relevant published evidence with new insights from pilot focus groups with adolescents with experiences of self-harm, eating disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as well as interviews with relevant experts.\n\nSpeakers: Christopher Edwards (King's College London), Kasia Kostyrka-Allchorne (King's College London), Professor Sonia Livingstone OBE and Dr Mariya Stoilova.\n\nView the recording here and event details here.

The 5-day programme features speakers from newsrooms, media companies, and research institutions from around the world – coming together to talk about how journalism is evolving and what is the role of AI technologies in this evolution.\n\nThe Festival is a unique occasion to come together with a global community of like-minded people striving to create a better future for journalism with AI.\n\nFind out more about the festival and view the recordings here.\n\nGlobal Forum on AI for Children\n\nTuesday 30 November 2021, 3.10-3.55pm (5.10-5.55pm Helsinki time) (online event)\n\nOn 30 November - 1 December 2021, UNICEF and the Government of Finland will host the Global Forum on AI for Children. This first-of-its-kind, virtual event will gather the world’s foremost children’s rights and technology experts, policymakers, practitioners and researchers, as well as children active in the AI space, to connect and share knowledge on pressing issues at the intersection of children’s rights, digital technology policies and AI systems.\n\nProfessor Sonia Livingstone OBE will be participating in 'Breakout Group 2: Ensure inclusion of and for children' as a panellist.\n\nFind out more about the forum here.\n\nProxies: the cultural work of standing in\n\nThursday 18 November 2021, 5pm – 6pm (online event)\n\nJoin us for the launch of Dr Dylan Mulvin’s new book, Proxies: The Cultural Work of Standing In.\n\nOur world is built on an array of standards we are compelled to share. In Proxies, Mulvin examines how we arrive at those standards, asking, “To whom and to what do we delegate the power to stand in for the world?” Mulvin shows how those with the power to design technology, in the very moment of design, are allowed to imagine who is included—and who is excluded—in the future. Mulvin also explores the ways technologies, standards, and infrastructures inescapably reflect the cultural milieus of their bureaucratic homes. Drawing on archival research, he investigates some of the basic building-blocks of our shared infrastructures. He tells the history of technology through the labour and communal practices of, among others, the people who clean kilograms to make the metric system run, the women who pose as test images, and the actors who embody disease and disability for medical students. Each case maps the ways standards and infrastructure rely on prototypical ideas of whiteness, able-bodiedness, and purity to control and contain the messiness of reality.\n\nSpeakers: Dr Dylan Mulvin, Dr Cait McKinney (Simon Fraser University) and Dr Tarleton Gillespie (Microsoft Research/Cornell University).\n\nView the recording here, or event details here.

Ross invites us to call others in, rather than call them out. Fighting against oppression and injustice are the dues we pay for the privilege of being conscious and we are honoured to be able to challenge it with great responsibility. We begin to build a unified and strategic human rights movement that weaves our strengths together, that uses our differences as a platform for modelling a positive future built on justice and the politics of love, rather than a return to the past based on the politics of fear and prejudice. However, to create this movement we need to make a commitment to recognise and support each other – Calling People in rather than Calling them Out. Ross will talk about how we can transform the Calling Out Culture into a Calling In Culture in order to build a united movement for human rights.\n\nSpeakers: Professor Loretta J. Ross (Smith College).\n\nChair: Professor Shani Orgad.\n\nView the recording here, and event details here.\n\nLSE Research Showcase: Dr Dylan Mulvin\n\nProxies: the cultural work of standing in\n\nWednesday 18 August 2021, 11-11.30am\n\n(online event)\n\nOur world is built on an array of standards we are compelled to share – where some bits of the world end up standing in for other bits in order to facilitate the design of technologies and services. But how are those standards determined? Drawing on his new book, Proxies, Dr Dylan Mulvin will share some stories from the history of technology to show the way technologies, standards and infrastructures inescapably reflect the cultures that created them, and how those with the power to design technology, in the very moment of design, are allowed to imagine who is included—and who is excluded—in the future. Come along to find out more about the people who clean kilograms to make the metric system run; the women who pose as test images; and the actors who embody disease and disability for medical students.\n\nFind out more about the LSE Research Showcase.\n\nLSE Research Showcase: Dr Simidele Dosekun\n\nSpectacular Femininity: the unattainable standards of postfeminism\n\nWednesday 11 August 2021, 11-11.30am\n\n(online event)\n\nPostfeminism is an upbeat, celebratory cultural address to women, and promise, that they are past or post- the need for feminism, that they are already individually empowered and can ‘have it all’, ‘do it all’. Drawing on her book, Fashioning Postfeminism: Spectacular Femininity and Transnational Culture, Dr Simidele Dosekun will tell the stories of women she interviewed in Lagos, Nigeria, who practise a spectacularly feminine style and what their lives and attitudes tell us about postfeminism in Africa. She discovers that the postfeminist emphasis on happy affects and choice and ‘can do’ leave little imaginative and emotional space for complaint, critique or resistance. Its encouragement to women to work on themselves, to work on their attitudes and their confidence, to ‘lean in’, obscures the material conditions that it requires.\n\nView the recording here.

Recounting conversations, late-night dinners and unexpected comic nuggets from those who make the news, The Powerful and the Damned is a portrait of the rich, famous, powerful and occasionally damned. In his first authored book, Barber offers unflinching pen portraits of the world’s leading characters, from Trump, Merkel and Draghi, to Prince Andrew, Mohammed Bin Salman and Dominic Cummings. In parallel, Barber provides a personal account of how he transformed the FT into a multi-channel global news organisation with a strong of international awards and groundbreaking reporting. This created a monumental shift for the whole news media landscape.\n\nChair: Professor Charlie Beckett.\n\nView the recording here and event details here.\n\nLSE Online Safety Bill Briefing\n\nThursday 8 July 2021, 9am - 1.30pm (online event)\n\nThis briefing will provide an overview of the draft Online Safety Bill and create an outcome-focused online discussion on key elements of the Bill that require scrutiny. Each panel discussion will explore and analyse pivotal debates within the Bill for the wide range of individuals and organisations engaged in discussions about how to regulate the complex and difficult area of online harms and their effects on individuals and on society. Attendees will be able to engage in interactive and robust discussions with panellists, and the focus on the interactions between law, policy and practice will be of interest to policymakers, regulators, civil society organisations, academics and industry.\n\nSpeakers: Imran Ahmed (Center for Countering Digital Hate), Damian Collins MP, Dr Edina Harbinja (Aston), Dame Margaret Hodge MP, Professor Sonia Livingstone OBE (LSE), Katie Morris (DCMS Security and Online Harms Directorate), John Nicolson MP, Chi Onwurah MP, Graham Smith (Bird & Bird), Dr Damian Tambini (LSE), Glen Tarman (Full Fact), Professor Lorna Woods (University of Essex) and Richard Wronka (Ofcom).\n\nChair: Professor Lee Edwards.\n\nView the recording here and event details here.\n\nRuptures in Authenticity: Gender and Vulnerability Online\n\nMonday 28 June 2021, 6 - 7pm, (online and in person event)\n\nIn person: CBG Auditorium, Lower Ground Floor (LSE staff and students\n\nOnline: Zoom webinar (open to all).\n\nIn this talk, Professor Sarah Banet-Weiser will explore ideas of authenticity and gender on social media, followed by a Q&A.\n\nThe idea of authenticity has been applied unquestionably as a valued attribute of the self: it is through our “authentic” selves that we inspire trust, loyalty, believability. The appearance of authenticity remains central to how individuals organize their everyday activities and craft their very selves. In the 21st century, as personal and professional identities are increasingly created, curated and manipulated in digital and social media, the concept of authenticity seems to carry even more weight, not less, so that one of the central questions in the age of digital media is whether and how successfully one can perform authenticity in order to claim visibility and identity. Social media amplifies this tension, as it is often positioned as a kind of open space, where one can be “oneself,” while at the same time it is also structurally designed as constantly manipulable. This has particular relevance for young cis-gendered women who perform authenticity on social media, because normative hetero-femininity is always constructed in terms of its artifice, where femininity is defined as a necessary contrived performance, from make-up to bodies to behaviours. Unlike the performance of authentic masculinity, which emphasizes its unfiltered quality, the performance of authentic femininity is always already suspect, always already a contradiction in terms.\n\nChair: Dr Polly Withers.\n\nIf you are an LSE student or staff member and would like to attend on campus (CBG Auditorium), please register here.\n\nIf you would like to join online (open to all), please register here.\n\nMigration on demand: The impact of streaming on migration cinema\n\nTuesday 22 June 2021, 6pm (online event)\n\nOnce a marginalised niche within cinema, films about migration are now quite literally moving into the mainstream, with streaming platforms from Netflix to MUBI featuring films that put the immigrant and refugee at the heart of the story. And in the era of COVID-19, streaming has never been more popular.\n\nBut what is the effect of this on viewers? What kind of stories are being told and whose voices are being platformed? And is there potential for this mainstreaming to truly change how the public thinks about migration? An exciting panel of content curators, academics, and filmmakers will consider these questions and many more.\n\nSpeakers: Professor Myria Georgiou, Charlie Phillips (The Guardian) and Mo Scarpelli (filmmaker and director).\n\nEvent details here.\n\nEdTech and the colonisation of our digital future: The role of EU's DSA\n\nTuesaday 8 June 8 2021, 3pm - 4.30pm (online event)\n\nThe recent pandemic gave society a glimpse of the potentially disastrous effects of unregulated, hasty deployment of digital services. The health and education sectors offered the most pronounced examples of the vitality of digital services for mitigating the effects of social-distancing and sustaining the global economy. At the same time, it demonstrated the threats that the “inescapable” character of the digital condition poses for human freedom particularly when its governance is almost exclusively in the control of private actors.\n\nThe new EU legislation packages aim to address the emerging power asymmetry between Big Tech and society. In its current form the DSA recognises the importance of acting on the avoidance of intermediary liability and the lobbying of platforms to be perceived as mere conduits of communication. Yet, the DSA risks missing its mark by failing to take stock of the critical role and distinct nature of education technology (EdTech) platforms.\n\nThe EdTech landscape is currently regulated by GDPR, but this barely succeeds in safeguarding children’s rights or their most fundamental freedoms, including their right to self-determination. In the field of education, digital services can collect and sell data but also ‘train’ their AI-based systems constantly through observation of educational processes. The growing \"knowledge capital\" acquired by educational technology companies widens the power asymmetry between the industry and society and generates lobbying power and knowledge to reconstruct education systems to suit EdTech business models.\n\nThis discussion brings together experts from across sectors to discuss the challenges and opportunities that the DSA/DMA legislation packages create considering two important parameters: a) the “inevitability” of the collaboration of the public and private sector in the process of the digitalisation of education and b) the risks involved in the unchecked deployment of data-driven services in education including the colonisation of society’s collective vision about its future by profit-driven businesses.\n\nSpeakers: Professor Sonia Livingstone, Dr Ioanna Noula, Dr Velislava Hillman, Eva Kaili (Member of the European Parliament and Chair of European Union’s Future of Science and Technology Options Assessment), Dr Desmond Bermingham (Australian Council for Education Research), Dr Ben Wagner (TU-Delft) and Mitzi László (Nextcloud GmbH).\n\nChair: Professor Nick Couldry.\n\nView event details here.\n\nRefusing Discriminatory Technologies of Power: racial justice and the challenge of hi-tech policing\n\nPart of the III Inequalities Seminar Series\n\nTuesday 11 May 2021, 12.30pm - 1.30pm (online event)\n\nFrom informational capitalism to biased code, technological systems increasingly form part of larger structures of oppression and domination. This talk tackles the topic of technology, injustice, and inequity with a focus on bottom-up practices of resistance, rejection, and refusal of digital and automated systems that increasingly govern people’s lives.\n\nDrawing from examples of data-driven policing in Europe and the United States, this talk explores the narrative, technical, and political challenges faced by members of affected communities - especially minoritised and racialised communities - in countering these discriminatory technologies of power. Given these challenges, what can affected communities learn from other practices of technological refusal?\n\nSpeaker: Dr Seeta Peña Gangadharan.\n\nChair: Professor Ellen Helsper (Research Theme Convenor, Politics of Inequality) and Professor in Digital Inequalities, Department of Media and Communications, LSE.\n\nChildren and the Digital Environment\n\nFriday 7 May 2021, 3.30 - 5pm (online event)\n\nTechnologies are spreading into all aspects of our lives via smart devices, internet of things, augmented reality, and data profiling. Children’s lives have become digital by default and technology is the taken-for-granted means of playing, seeing family, doing schoolwork, hanging out with friends in a post-COVID world. The distinction between the offline and online no longer offers a meaningful way of conceptualising the infrastructure of life but what can we replace it with? Where does the digital begin and end, what does it incorporate? What are the implications for children? This webinar will debate the theories and concepts that underpin such questions, drawing on different disciplinary approaches.\n\nSpeakers: Jean-Christophe Plantin, Taina Bucher, Bieke Zaman and Christine Hine.\n\nChair: Sonia Livingstone.\n\nDiscussant: Mariya Stoilova.\n\nWatch the recording here.\n\nThis webinar is part of a webinar series on theory for the EU H2020 project CO:RE - Children Online: Research and Evidence.\n\nBook Launch: Digital Technology and Democratic Theory\n\nThursday 6 May 2021, 6 - 7pm (online event)\n\nOne of the most far-reaching transformations in our era is the wave of digital technologies rolling over and upending nearly every aspect of life. Work and leisure, family and friendship, community and citizenship have all been modified by now ubiquitous digital tools and platforms. Digital Technology and Democratic Theory looks closely at one significant facet of our rapidly evolving digital lives: how technology is radically changing our lives as citizens and participants in democratic governments. To understand these transformations, the book brings together contributions by scholars from multiple disciplines to wrestle with the question of how digital technologies shape, reshape, and affect fundamental questions about democracy and democratic theory. As expectations have whiplashed, from Twitter optimism in the wake of the Arab Spring to Facebook pessimism in the wake of the 2016 US election, the time is ripe for a more sober and long-term assessment. How should we take stock of digital technologies and their promise and peril for reshaping democratic societies and institutions? To answer, this volume broaches the most pressing technological changes and issues facing democracy as a philosophy and an institution.\n\nThis book includes a chapter by Dr Seeta Peña Gangadharan entitled 'Digital Exclusion: A Politics of Refusal'.

This is part of the pre-launching initiatives of the new Advanced Studies Children`s Rights Programme (AACRP) of Nova School of Law that had its beginning with the Roundtable on the Rights of the Child: New Challenges and Opportunities, on 3rd February 2021.\n\nProfessor Sonia Livingstone will deliver a keynote entitled 'Pros and cons of child rights impact assessment for digital decision makers'.\n\nOrganised by the Nova School of Law.\n\nData as an instrument of coloniality: A panel discussion on digital and data colonialism\n\nTuesday 27 April 2021, 3.30 - 5pm (online event)\n\nMaps and surveys of \"new worlds\"; passport photos and vaccination cards to control the movement of \"impure\" bodies; accounting spreadsheets used in plantations of enslaved peoples... All of these technologies suggest that data has always been an instrument of colonialism. But can the history of European and American colonialism also help us interpret contemporary phenomena like algorithmic racial violence, quarantine apps and vaccination apartheid, the injustices of the gig economy, and disinformation campaigns that threaten our democratic futures? By examining these trends not just in the context of the past few decades, but through the lens of the past 500 years, we can perhaps gain new insights into why theories of capitalist production may not be enough to make sense of the extractivist technologies of today. These technologies need to be understood as manifestations of something deeper, constitutive of colonialism. Only by looking at the histories of colonial extraction and appropriation of land, nature and labor can we understand that our lives are being reconfigured in unprecedented ways, through the medium of data.\n\nConfronted with the new infrastructures of data colonialism, which perpetuate old racial, gender and class injustices, we must learn from past and present anti-colonial and anti-racist movements and thinkers. Decolonizing our data in this context means developing new strategies for resisting the new extractivist order, and for re-imagining internet governance and the digital commons. Join us for this important discussion with four authors who, in different ways, have analyzed our datafied world through the framework of coloniality.\n\nSpeakers: Professor Nick Couldry, Professor Ulises Mejias, Paula Chakravartty and Miriyam Aouragh.\n\nChair: Dr Alison Powell.\n\nRegister here.\n\nHosted by the Alan Turing Institute.\n\nBuilding the Fugitive Academy: Communication, Culture, Media, & Rhetoric Scholars on the Work of Transformation Conference\n\nFriday 23 April 2021, 6.30 - 8.30pm UK (1.30 - 3.30pm EST) (online event)\n\nFor many years, metrics have been a site for social justice contestation in the academy. Disputes over assessment have been growing across organizations, including NCA, ICA, and RSA for the past decade. Black and Brown scholars have consistently contested the internal dynamics of journal editorial ships, awards processes, hiring decisions, graduate programs, and so on as based on exclusionary models of rigor. This seminar seeks to refocus conversations about rigor and merit, with an eye toward crafting communication and media studies specific models inclusive and equitable excellence. By exploring a variety of perspectives and approaches for defining rigor and merit, the panelists offer ways of broadening both concepts in favor of using them as tools of inclusivity and equity that center a pluriverse of epistemic positions and traditions instead of reinforcing Euro-American gatekeeping.\n\nSpeakers: Dr Omar Al-Ghazzi, Vani Kannan, Carmen Kynard and Kimberly Moffitt.\n\nModerator: Aymar Jean Christian.\n\nFind out more about the session here, and register here.\n\nOrganised by The Institute for the Liberal Arts, Boston College.\n\nA Theory of Media Freedom - Annual Eric Barendt Law Lecture (University of Oxford)\n\nTuesday 23 March 2021, 2pm - 3.30pm (online event)\n\nRecent controversies, such as Trump de-platforming and debates about how to regulate internet intermediaries raise fundamental questions of freedom of expression. Should internet intermediaries be considered as censors of speech, against which the rights of individuals must be asserted? To what extent do they have rights as ‘media’ to be autonomous or independent of the state, or to receive other benefits? The lack of shared principles of media freedom undermines the legitimacy of all responses to these questions. Whilst the number of international organisations with media freedom in their mandate grows, and the UK Foreign Office leads a campaign for Media Freedom, this lecture examines the history of different theories of media freedom, and the extent to which it may be possible to advance a shared one based in international human rights.\n\nSpeakers: Dr Damian Tambini.\n\nHosted by University of Oxford and Bonavero Institute.

During the five-decade-long armed conflict involving the Maoist guerrillas and the landless/poor peasants on the one side, and the state security forces and upper-caste/private militias on the other, violence has taken multiple forms. It has spiralled, giving rise to new formations and new theatres of war, especially in the forested areas which are home to indigenous populations. In this event, Dr George Kunnath will attempt to conceptualise this enduring violence and reflect on the possibility of resolutions, drawing on twenty years of his research in conflict-affected regions in India, and recently in Colombia. Employing the framework of the ‘Spiral of Violence’ developed by Helder Camara (1909–1999), a Brazilian liberation theologian, Dr Kunnath will explore the many faces of violence as manifested in a continuum of structural inequality, resistance and repression. As there has been no meaningful transition from violence to peace in India’s guerrilla zones, Dr Kunnath will also draw on a comparative model, and discuss the insights that the 2016 peace agreement in Colombia might provide for India. In Colombia, also ravaged by the cycle of violence, the peace agreement between the FARC and the state facilitated the end of a similarly long-lasting armed conflict. The comprehensive peace process in Colombia, in spite of its setbacks, has demonstrated that without addressing the persisting inequalities, the spiral of violence cannot be broken.

How can we tell a story of maternal labour in the past, in the absence of data? What does it mean to study mothering today, in the context of intensified neoliberalism?

Or how to protect your privacy online? If your child asks you about their data, would you know how to guide them? Over the past year, we’ve been talking to children, parents and educators about online data and privacy. We found that children are becoming aware of the commercial uses of their data and they care about their privacy, but there are important gaps in their digital skills. Children often turn to their parents and teachers for guidance, but adults also struggle to understand the complex digital environment and to know how to advise children. We developed a toolkit to promote understanding and empower your family or classroom to protect your privacy online.\n\nPresenter: Dr Mariya Stoilova, Department of Media and Communications.\n\nResearchers of the Future\n\nSaturday 7 March 2020, 1pm - 4pm\n\nHosted by LSE Festival: Shape the World\n\nHow do people make decisions, like deciding whether to protest for climate change, what to spend money on, or whether to cheat on a test?

Come learn more about it and also give your input into what researchers should be studying and how.
