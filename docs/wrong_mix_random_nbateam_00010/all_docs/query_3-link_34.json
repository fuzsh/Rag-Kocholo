        "text": "Riding on the success of Kaadhal Kondein, his official début movie as a director, one would have expected Selvaraghavan to repeat the duo Dhanush and Sonia Agarwal for his next venture ‘7G Rainbow Colony’ that released to commercial success in 2004.\n\nInstead the movie features Ravi Krishna playing an average lower middle class youth Kadhir who is besotted with Sonia Agarwal playing an upwardly mobile North Indian girl whose family had run into financial troubles.\n\nThe character would have suited Dhanush to the ‘T’ as he made success of playing the underdog survivor effortlessly in his initial films. Nonetheless he delivers the goods yet again and a pedestrian story of ‘wastrel-boy-meets-a-talented-girl’ is narrated in a unique and credible manner. The climax may be a bit of an overkill and fantasy but the audience are hooked in to watch the drama unfold.\n\n‘Loser’! A single word in enough to describe all that is wrong with Kadhir and such guys have really no chance to even catch the eye of a girl like Anita. But if it were to happen and we could narrate it in a credible manner rather than pure fantasy, the result would be much of what happens in the movie. The end is undoubtedly a spoiler – even a deliberate attempt to play for effect than a piece of reality. But you do come out feeling you got to watch something different and meaningful.\n\nKadhir is an aimless youth and has fun with friends who seem to share his lifestyle. Nothing unusual about it since there are millions of similar narratives who seem to still manage to survive their passage into adulthood. The trouble with Kadhir is two-fold though – he has a massive inferiority complex and yet he is not reconciled fully to being a loser."
