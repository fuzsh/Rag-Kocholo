        "text": "Sonia Aggarwal is a Vice President at Climate Imperative, where she uses her expertise to set climate policy priorities and strategy in the economic sectors and geographies that produce the greatest amounts of greenhouse gas emissions. She provides insights on which technologies, policies, and levels of ambition are needed to cut greenhouse gas pollution at the speed and scale the climate crisis requires, while improving public health and saving consumers money.\n\nPrior to this role, Sonia served as Special Assistant to the President for Climate Policy, Innovation, and Deployment in the Biden administration. While there, she helped develop the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, as well as the United States’ climate targets, including the commitment to cut economy-wide greenhouse gases by 50-52 percent below 2005 levels in 2030. Sonia’s other professional experience includes helping clean tech startups provide climate solutions, researching which sectors and regions the world’s emissions come from, and identifying the best policies to reduce emissions. She has a B.S. from Haverford College in astronomy and physics, and an M.S. from Stanford University in engineering focused on energy."
