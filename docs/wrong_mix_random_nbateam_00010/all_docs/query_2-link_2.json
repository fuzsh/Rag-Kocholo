Texas Economic Development Corporation President/CEO Aaron Demerson, Dale A. Robertson, Vice President of Business Development, and Veronica Beyer, Director of Marketing and Communications, attended the \"Top Off” fireside chat with Texas icon and founder of the “Make It Movement”, Roy Spence. Roy Spence states the “Make It Movement” has a goal and is on a mission to empower the next generation, starting in Central Texas and expanding across the state and the nation”. By collaborating with educators, parents, and civic and industry leaders, the movement aims to harness the power of marketing as a force for good. Their goal is to inspire and motivate millions of young Americans to discover their purpose and pursue high-skill, high-income careers starting from middle and high school. By graduation, these young individuals will be equipped to achieve financial independence, doing what they excel at and love. In his talk, Roy Spence emphasized that this initiative would ensure young Texans—and eventually young Americans—don't just make it in Texas but make it in America. The labor force continues to be at the top of discussions with employers. We appreciate this innovative approach to weigh in as a part of the solution to ensuring Texas has the workforce our current and future employer’s demand. You can “Make It” in TEXAS!"
