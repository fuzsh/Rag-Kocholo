        "text": "It is such an honor (and an absolute dream come true) to officially announce Save the Mothers International! What a journey this has been already: from a crazy idea, to a successful program, to a full scale non-profit organization focused on expansion to reach more mamas in more locations around Subsaharan Africa in 2024 and beyond. When the Lord put this dream on my heart, I had no idea I would be sitting here, three and a half years later, typing this announcement as the Executive Director of my own non-profit. I get giddy thinking about where we will be in another three and a half years, how many women we will have trained and how many mamas will be saved. I am immensely thankful for everyone who has helped, supported, and walked this journey with us so far. This work we do is not simple. It isn’t easy to get mamas in remote villages the care they deserve, but we believe that pregnancy shouldn’t be a death sentence just because of where you were born. It is complicated work to share the Good News with these mamas of how much Jesus loves and values them when the culture that they are surrounded by often says that because they are women they are second best, but we serve a God that loves His daughters so we will stand and advocate for them. So THANK YOU for all the support so far and please join Save the Mothers International in the following ways: SHARE: our content with your friends, families, and churches. You can find us online (https://lnkd.in/gbr3XWFu), on Instagram (https://lnkd.in/g3cJ-QFt) and on LinkedIn (https://lnkd.in/g28_mxTb) DONATE: Via our website to allow us to save more mamas in more areas of Subsaharan Africa in 2024 FOLLOW: us on all our platforms for more exciting updates coming soon!! (https://lnkd.in/gbr3XWFu)(https://lnkd.in/g5pwsQrP) REACH OUT: if you, your church, your small group, your business etc. would like to learn more about how you can partner with STMI"
