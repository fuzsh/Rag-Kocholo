LIPMAN, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF TENNESSEE; STANLEY ALLEN BASTIAN, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON; AND MANISH S. SHAH, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS ---------- WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 13, 2013 United States Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC. The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:04 p.m., in Room SD-226, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Dick Durbin, presiding. Present: Senators Durbin and Grassley. Senator Durbin. Good afternoon. The Judiciary Committee will come to order, and we will consider four nominations for the Federal bench. They include: Nancy Moritz, of Kansas, who has been nominated to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit; Stanley Bastian, nominated to be a district judge for the Eastern District of Washington; Sheryl Lipman, nominated to be a district judge for the Western District of Tennessee; and Manish Shah, who has been nominated to be a district judge for the Northern District of Illinois. Each nominee has the support of their home State Senators, and I commend President Obama for sending their names to the Senate. At these hearings it is traditional for the nominees to be introduced before the Committee by Senators from their home States, and unless the Ranking Member has any opening remarks-- okay, they will be submitted for the record. We will proceed with the introductions. I would like to invite my Senate colleagues at the witness table to make their introductions, and I know they have busy schedules and may have to leave afterwards, but we are honored to have them here. First up will be Senator Mark Kirk of the great State of Illinois. Senator Kirk, proceed. Make sure your microphone is on there, Mark. PRESENTATION OF MANISH S. SHAH, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS, BY HON. MARK KIRK, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS Senator Kirk. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to say that you and I both agree that Manish Shah should be sitting on the Federal bench in the Northern District of Illinois. I would say about Manish that he has been heading the Criminal Division of the U.S. Attorney's Office, which has substantial management responsibility because he is overlooking the work of 130 other people, more than most U.S. Attorneys in the country. I want to note this about Manish's career: that he has managed the prosecution of the hired truck scandal that included the prosecution of 49 public officials, sorely needed for our State where we suffer from corruption problems, that Manish has been a good corruption fighter. I think as a justice he will be outstanding in his service to the country. Senator Durbin. Thank you very much, Senator Kirk. It is true that we do this on a bipartisan basis, and each approves the other's nominees, and I was happy to join. I will have a few words about Mr. Shah after our other colleagues have had a chance to speak about their nominees. Let me now recognize Senator Jerry Moran of Kansas. PRESENTATION OF HON. NANCY L. MORITZ, NOMINEE TO BE CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT, BY HON. JERRY MORAN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF KANSAS Senator Moran. Chairman Durbin, thank you very much. I appreciate you and Ranking Member Grassley giving me the opportunity to appear before this Committee, and it is a pleasure and honor to be here to introduce Honorable Nancy Moritz, who is a Supreme Court Justice of the Kansas Supreme Court. She has been nominated by the President to serve as a judge on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. I am a member of the bar and have great concern about the dispensing of justice in our State, and this position has been open for a considerable amount of time, and I am pleased to say that Senator Roberts and I and the White House had the opportunity to work together to find nominees that were acceptable to the White House as well as to Senator Roberts and to me, and Justice Moritz meets that criteria. It is important, it seems to me, that our ability to come together is particularly demonstrated in the need for the filling of positions, both at the Federal district court as well as the Tenth Circuit. I am also grateful to Justice Moritz for her willingness to continue her public service. She will, if confirmed, replace Judge Deanell Reece Tacha, a very highly qualified and respected member of the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, someone highly regarded in Kansas and across the country, and I have little doubt that Justice Moritz will fulfill those shoes with similar capabilities and similar distinction. Justice Moritz comes--let me express my support for her nomination in a couple of ways. She comes from a community of a population of just a few hundred, Tipton, Kansas, and not too far down the road from my home town. And I know the type of community as well as I know the specifics of this community, and I have great regard for the way that small towns raise their kids. And I have great regard and, therefore, great expectation that, if confirmed, Nancy will serve justice well and will serve our country well. In small towns across Kansas and across the country, when you grow up in that setting, you are raised in a way that I think is important. It creates a certain level of character, kind of character, amount of respect, kindness for others, a work ethic, and a genuine concern for others. And I am so supportive of that kind of upbringing and the kind of qualifications, therefore, that this nominee brings. So it is in a sense an opportunity to brag about the way we raise our kids in Kansas and indicate to you that Nancy Moritz really exemplifies that kind of upbringing. She is highly regarded in her community where you have no way but being known in a town that size. Everyone knows you, and so the way that the community came together to support her nomination and to support her qualifications to be a judge has great appeal to me. Additionally, Justice Moritz was a law clerk for a Kansas Supreme Court Justice named Ed Larson. If there is a lawyer in Kansas who I consider a lawyer's lawyer, it is Justice Larson. And the fact that Justice Moritz was mentored by Justice Larson means a great deal to me. Ed Larson was one of my partners in our law firm of five attorneys, and so I know the justice well, and I know based upon his recommendation and the relationship that he and Nancy Moritz developed, clerk to judge, that she has been mentored by one of Kansas' finest jurists. So those two aspects of her life--her upbringing and her mentorship by a great attorney and justice--causes me to be here. And then you add to that all of the experience, the mix of experience that Nancy has had in private practice and as a Federal attorney as well as a court of appeals judge and a Supreme Court justice, I think there is a significant and well- based foundation for her to make an excellent Federal judge. And so, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member Grassley, I look forward to supporting Justice Moritz's confirmation to the Tenth Circuit, assuming that this Committee recommends her favorably to the U.S. Senate, and, again, I express my gratitude to her and her family, who have joined her here today, for her willingness to serve in this important capacity. Thank you very much, Senator Grassley. Senator Durbin. Thank you, Senator Moran. Senator Murray. Senator Murray. Mr. Chairman, I note that Senator Kirk was here ahead of me, and I am happy to allow him to go first, if he wants. Senator Durbin. He has already spoken. Senator Murray. He already has, okay. PRESENTATION OF STANLEY ALLEN BASTIAN, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON, BY HON. PATTY MURRAY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF WASHINGTON Senator Murray. Well, thank you very much, Chairman Durbin and Ranking Member Grassley and all the Members of your Committee. I really appreciate the opportunity today to join you to introduce an outstanding nominee to be the United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Washington, Stan Bastian. I am pleased to welcome him and, I believe, his wife and daughters as well who are with him in Washington, DC, today--or as the people from my State call it, ``the other Washington.'' As many of you may know, in my home State we use a bipartisan judicial selection process to recommend to the President potential nominees to the Federal bench. At a time when we too often suffer from partisan gridlock, facing the threat of filibusters on the floor of the Senate for even the most routine of votes, I am very pleased to report to you that Stan Bastian was unanimously recommended by Democrats and Republicans alike to be the next Federal judge in eastern Washington. For the many reasons I will briefly touch upon, Stan is immensely qualified to serve as United States district judge, and I urge this Committee to support his confirmation. With nearly 30 years of litigation experience under his belt, Stan represents the best of the legal profession in Washington State. He is a fellow in the American College of Trial Lawyers. He is a lawyer representative to the Ninth Circuit Judicial Conference. He is chairman of the Equal Justice Coalition and has served the Washington bar faithfully, first as a member of the board of Governors, then as president- elect and as president. As a partner at the Wenatchee law firm Jeffers, Danielson, Sonn and Aylward, Stan has practiced in both State and Federal court trying hundreds of cases, including civil and criminal cases and jury and bench trials. At the outset of his career, Stan clerked for the Washington State Court of Appeals, and he served for a time as judge pro tem in several municipal courts. Stan has described the ideal judicial temperament as one of ``fairness, impartiality, efficiency, and patience''-- attributes that Stan displays time and time again in the courtroom, as a leader in his firm, and as a leader in the bar. I have no doubt, Mr. Chairman, that these attributes will serve him well as a Federal judge. So let me thank Stan for accepting the President's nomination and for his willingness to serve Washington State and our Nation as a Federal judge. Our system of Government is at its best when good people step up to the plate and are willing to serve. Throughout his legal career, Stan Bastian has done just that, working tirelessly to strengthen and improve the practice of law and access to justice in my State. I know Stan will bring this same work ethic to his service as a Federal judge in the Eastern District, and I know the judiciary will be better off because of his service. Thank you very much. Senator Durbin. Thanks, Senator Murray. I understand the Senators from Tennessee could not join us at this moment, and they have asked me to give a brief introduction on behalf of Sheryl Lipman, who has been nominated to the District Court for the Western District of Tennessee. She served as university counsel for the University of Memphis since 2002. In this capacity, she serves as the university's primary in-house counsel for all major litigation. Previously she worked as vice president of Comprehensive Services at the Memphis Race Relations and Diversity Institute, spent a decade in private practice at the law firms Reed Smith; Wyatt, Tarrant and Combs; and Burch, Porter and Johnson. She received her undergraduate degree from the University of Michigan, her J.D. from New York University School of Law, served as a law clerk for Judge Julian Gibbons, who was then serving on the District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, and we are happy that she is here today. I will just conclude--Senator Kirk opened with the introduction of Mr. Shah. We have a bipartisan process, and I am happy to lend my name in support of his candidacy or nomination. He is the nominee of historic moment in that he would be the first Article III judge of South Asian descent to serve in our State of Illinois. I understand that Mr. Shah is joined by his family and friends, whom I am sure he will introduce at a later moment. I want to thank our colleagues, unless Senator Grassley has something to say at this point before we call up the panel. Senator Grassley. I welcome all the nominees, and I am going to put my statement in the record. [The prepared statement of Ranking Member Grassley appears as a submission for the record.] Senator Durbin. Thank you, Senator Grassley. Thank you to our colleagues. You are free to go if you wish, and I am sure you have very busy schedules. Justice Moritz, you will be the first, and if you would stand for just a moment. Do you affirm that the testimony that you are about to give before the Committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? Justice Moritz. I do. Senator Durbin. Thank you. The record will reflect that the nominee answered in the affirmative. And now let me turn it over to future Justice Moritz-- current Justice Moritz to say a few words and introduce her family. STATEMENT OF HON. NANCY L. MORITZ, NOMINEE TO BE CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT Justice Moritz. I would like to first thank President Obama for appointing me and putting his trust in me for this position, and Senator Durbin, Chair, and Senator Grassley, the Ranking Minority Member, for convening this hearing. I appreciate it very much. And I want to thank Senator Moran for those very, very kind remarks, and especially for the kind remarks about my little community of Tipton. I can guarantee you that they feel just as strongly about him as he does about them and for all he has done to help them remain a thriving community. And very quickly, I want to say that I have my family here to support me, and my brother reminded me yesterday of how our big adventures used to be. We would get in the family station wagon, and we would all pile in, and we would argue about who had to sit in the back seat, and fight, and take a Sunday drive all around Tipton. Well, the adventure has changed a little bit, but one thing is the same, and my family is still here to support me, as you will see in a minute, and it is great that I finally get the front seat. I have here with me my daughters, two daughters: Kathleen Landis, who is a student at Colgate University, and her friend, Bennett Wade, from Portland, Maine; and my daughter Sarah Landis who is a student at Washburn University in Topeka, and her fiance, Ryan Rowe, who is a student at Washburn also; my mother, Carol Moritz, from Salina, Kansas; my sister, Kathy Gasper, and her husband, Steve Gasper, from Salina, Kansas; my brother Larry Moritz, from Salina; my brother John Moritz, from Tipton; my cousin Rose Ann Morrow, from Topeka, and her children, Beth and Jeff Morrow, and his fiance, Patricia Clark, from Topeka; my former friend Mike Corpstein from Tipton; my two research attorneys from the Kansas Supreme Court, my right and left hands, Tina Hardin--and her husband, Greg, is here-- and Jackie Blase Freed. And I also have a couple of cousins from this area: Sharon Winter is here, and Retired Colonel Ron Winter, her husband, and retired fighter pilot, I might add. And I also want to introduce Mary Elizabeth Elliott, who is sitting in the back and is here--is from this area, and she is the daughter of Senator--or, I am sorry, Justice Larson, who the Senator mentioned. And she is representing him today because he could not be here, and I am very, very pleased to have her here. And with that, I would open myself up to questions. [The biographical information of Justice Moritz appears as a submission for the record.] Senator Durbin. Thank you very much, and let me just say at the outset, since Senator Moran is still here, that his appeal to your Kansas roots and Kansas values was really loaded testimony, because he knows that my grandfather was born in Kansas. Justice Moritz. Really? Wow. [Laughter.] Senator Durbin. So he is trying his best to get on my best side, and it worked. So thank you very much for those comments, Senator Moran. You have had some interesting assignments on the Kansas Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals, and now you have an opportunity to serve in a very important position in the Federal judiciary. How do you view the difference in moving from the State courts to the Federal courts, the difference in the challenge? Justice Moritz. The difference, I do not know that there is a difference in the challenge. The challenge is always the same, Senator. That is a good question. But it seems to me it is always the same, which is to apply the rule of law, whether it is our United States Constitution or our Kansas Constitution or a Federal statute or a State statute, and to apply it as well as you can. I think the challenge is the same. Senator Durbin. So let me ask you about several cases that you have been involved in, and I think it gives you an opportunity to explain your reasoning when you are confronted with, in many cases, challenging and very difficult factual patterns. Earlier this year, the Kansas Supreme Court issued a ruling in the case Shirley v. Glass that dealt with the duty owed by gun dealers not to sell guns to straw purchasers. In this case, a man named Russell Graham had a history of violence and abuse against his son and his son's mother. He went into a gun shop to buy a shotgun. Graham told the dealer at the gun shop that he had a felony conviction, and the dealer then sold the gun to Graham's grandmother who was with him in the store and who could pass a background check. Graham paid for the gun in cash, took it home that night, and used it to fatally shoot his son and then himself. The son's mother sued the gun dealer, alleging that he negligently entrusted the gun knowing that it was really intended for Graham. The Kansas Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision allowing the mother to proceed with her negligent entrustment claim and also found that gun dealers must use a high standard of care to avoid selling guns to convicted felons. Please tell me how you analyzed that case and your reasoning behind that decision. Justice Moritz. Yes, Senator, thank you for the opportunity. That case actually involved a statute, a Kansas statute. It did not involve the Second Amendment. It involved a statute that we had to decide whether that statute created a duty, and our case law had not been particularly clear on that point. So we kind of went through that case law and analyzed it and determined that there was a duty on the part of the pawn shop in this case. We did not go any further than that because the other elements of a negligence case were not before us. This was a summary judgment decision, which means that, you know, they still had to go back and try the case. But we determined that there was a duty---- Senator Durbin. Based on the statute? Justice Moritz. Based on the statute, yes. Senator Durbin. Let me ask you about another case. Last year, you wrote an opinion on behalf of a unanimous Kansas Supreme Court in a case called In re T.S.W. Justice Moritz. Yes. Senator Durbin. The case involved a Federal law called the ``Indian Child Welfare Act.'' This Act contains an adoption preference to place tribal children either with a member of the child's extended family or with other members of the child's tribe. In this case, the mother wanted to put her child up for adoption, and the child was a member of the Cherokee Nation on his father's side. The mother had a desire to place the child with a non-Indian family, and there was a question about whether a deviation from the Act's placement preference was warranted because of the wishes of the mother. Your court held that the preference under the law applied in that case. Can you describe your reasoning behind that decision? Justice Moritz. Yes, Senator. The Indian Child Welfare Act that you referred to, it creates preferences, and trial courts are required to follow those preferences. And in this case, we had to determine whether the mother's preference for the placement--the non-Indian mother's preference for the placement of her child could overcome the normal preference procedure that--the steps that you follow. And we determined based on our analysis of the law as well as Supreme Court precedent and some of our own Kansas Supreme Court precedent that it could not overcome those steps. Senator Durbin. I have not deal with this particular Federal law, but there are no exceptions in it for parental preference or cases where one of the parents might be Native American and the other not Native American? There are no exceptions in the law? Justice Moritz. I believe it is a factor that can be considered, but our decision had to do with whether that one-- the mother's preference could overcome other preferences that are required to be considered under the law. Senator Durbin. You worked from 1995 to 2004 as an Assistant U.S. Attorney on civil litigation and served as the office's appellate coordinator. Could you discuss the types of matters you handled in that capacity? Justice Moritz. Yes. I actually handled both civil and criminal matters. I had not been a prosecutor, but I did handle a number of criminal matters. Generally they were not matters that had lengthy trials because our office preferred that if there had been a lengthy trial that the prosecutor herself or himself would appear in front of the court and handle those cases. But I did handle a number of criminal matters, drug- related robberies, kind of the normal criminal cases. And I also handled several civil appeals in front of the Tenth Circuit. Senator Durbin. Thank you. Senator Grassley. Senator Grassley. Thank you for your willingness to serve. Justice Moritz. Thank you. Senator Grassley. In 1991, you wrote an article regarding permissible discrimination in private clubs. I recognize this was a long time ago and early in your career, so it might not be fresh in your mind. Nevertheless, I have a few questions based on that article and have you explain your current views and approach to the subject. In your conclusion, you wrote, ``As is often the case, the law is in step with the views of society.'' That statement implies that there are times when the law may not be in step with societal views. When is it appropriate for a judge either to determine what the views of society are or to take them into account in a particular case? Justice Moritz. Thank you, Senator, for the opportunity to address that article. It is dated. It was quite some time ago. But I think that statement that you are referring to, we were addressing, as I recall, the various statutes that can be used to address discrimination in private clubs. At the time it was not particularly clear and the cases were fairly new, and so we were trying to set out what some of those means were. I think that was the context of the statement that you have read. Senator Grassley. When then is it appropriate for a judge either to determine what the views of society are or to take them into account in a particular case? Justice Moritz. I do not believe it is ever appropriate for a judge to consider that. Senator Grassley. If a judge determined that the law and prevailing society views are out of step, what is the duty of a judge? I think you just answered that, didn't you? Justice Moritz. Yes, sir. Senator Grassley. In the case of first impression, In re Interest of K.M.H, decided in 2007, the Kansas Supreme Court addressed the issue of parental rights. The majority held that the clear language of the statute said a particular class of individuals had no parental rights and the statute did not violate equal protection or due process. You dissented, arguing that the statute violated a fundamental right and that fundamental rights must be actively waived. I am not asking you about the specifics of that case but more generally how you would approach judging. What is your approach to statutory construction? Justice Moritz. Senator, my approach to statutory construction is I take a look at the statute, and I determine whether the statute is clear or unambiguous on its face. And in doing that, I look at the whole statute, not just that part of the statute, and if I find that it is clear from the text of the statute, that is what I go with and that is what we go with. And if I find that it is not clear, then we have to look outside the statute to intent and try to determine the intent of the legislature in Kansas now or, if I am lucky enough to be nominated, of the legislature, of Congress in enacting that statute. Senator Grassley. And then what process would you under take to determine the plain meaning of a statute, and at the point you would just end it? Justice Moritz. I think I would, you know, first of all, I would look at the context and how it was enacted, why it was enacted, and whatever evidence we have of intent. And then I would also, of course, look to precedent interpreting it. Senator Grassley. Under what circumstances is it appropriate to disregard statutory language? Justice Moritz. To disregard statutory language? Senator Grassley. Yes. Justice Moritz. I do not think it is appropriate. Senator Grassley. As a judge, how would you determine what is a fundamental right? Justice Moritz. Well, Senator, our Supreme Court has determined a number of rights are fundamental, and I would certainly enforce and--excuse me, I would certainly apply that precedent. Senator Grassley. Okay. In the Kansas Supreme Court case regarding parental custody, there was a discussion that a judge must differentiate between the religiously motivated conduct or actions that concern the parents' religious beliefs versus those that implicate the best interests of the child. You dissented in that case, stating, ``The majority has essentially judicially mandated a preference for one parent's fundamental right to the free exercise of religion over another parent's fundamental liberty interest in exercising the care, custody, and control of the child.'' Again, I do not necessarily want to get into the specifics of the case, so at a more general level, can you describe the approach you take in weighing competing interests? First, how would you distinguish between a fundamental right and a fundamental liberty interest? Justice Moritz. Well, I guess I cannot--taking it in the context of that case, the fundamental right that we were referring to was the right--or I was referring to, excuse me, in the dissent was the right to parent. Senator Grassley. You said one side of it was a fundamental right to free exercise of religion and---- Justice Moritz. I am sorry. I apologize---- Senator Grassley [continuing]. The other was a fundamental liberty---- Justice Moritz. Yes. Right, right. I am sorry. Yes, the context of that in that case was--that was a custody matter. I think you are referring to a custody matter. Senator Grassley. Yes. Justice Moritz. And what we had determined was the majority determined that the best interests of the child did not require--or the judge was not allowed to consider the impact of religious practices upon the best interests of the child. And my point really was to say that that may have deprived one parent of their fundamental religious right, the right to express their religious freedom because that parent's views and practices were not being taken into account, as I recall that case. And my view was that the religious practices should not control that setting, but that the religious practices should be considered just like any other practice on what is in the best interests of the child. And ultimately that is what the Kansas Supreme Court held. That was a court of appeals case that I dissented on, and they did take that. They ultimately affirmed the decision, but they did find that a religious practice, if it has an impact upon the best interests of the child, just like any other factor, should be considered. Senator Grassley. If you want to look at your answer to that and submit in writing a more clear view of how you distinguish between a fundamental right and a fundamental liberty interest, I would appreciate it. Justice Moritz. All right. [The information referred to appears as a submission for the record.] Senator Grassley. I will submit my last question for answer in writing. Justice Moritz. Thank you, Senator. Senator Durbin. Thank you, Senator Grassley. [The question of Ranking Member Grassley appears as a submission for the record.] Senator Durbin. Justice Moritz, thanks for--did I pronounce that correctly? Justice Moritz. Yes, you did. Senator Durbin. Okay. Justice Moritz, thank you very much for being with us today, and as Senator Grassley indicated, some of the questions may be sent to you in writing. I hope you can give us a prompt response and give us an incentive to move your nomination along based on that. Justice Moritz. I certainly will. Senator Durbin. So thank you very much for your testimony today and for the attendance of your family and friends. Justice Moritz. Thank you so much, Senator. Senator Durbin. We now call the second panel, which will include Mr. Shah, Mr. Bastian, and Ms. Lipman. If you would please raise your right hand. Do you affirm the testimony you are about to give before the Committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? Ms. Lipman. I do. Mr. Bastian. I do. Mr. Shah. I do. Senator Durbin. Thank you. Let the record reflect that all three of the witnesses have answered in the affirmative. We will give you each an opportunity for a brief opening statement, introduction of your family. Ms. Lipman, you are first. STATEMENT OF SHERYL H. LIPMAN, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF TENNESSEE Ms. Lipman. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to the Committee for convening this hearing. I would also like to thank the President for the nomination, Senators Alexander and Corker as well as Congressman Cohen for their support for this position. Today I have with me a few family and friends that I would like to introduce. First, my husband, Dale Anderson. Dale is a retired Navy photojournalist and currently a civilian Navy employee at the Navy Recruiting Command at Millington. My father, Clifton Lipman, is a semi-retired construction lawyer in Memphis. My mother, Sandra Lipman, is a retired business executive and former educator. My sister, Elise Jordan, is a senior vice president with FedEx Express. She is here representing the entire Jordan family watching back home in Memphis: my brother-in-law, Richard; my nieces Samantha and Hannah. Also in Boston watching online is my brother, Barton Lipman, who is the chair of the economics department at Boston University. He is watching with my sister-in-law, Marie O'Deal, and my nephew, Matthew. Today I also have several DC friends who I am very thankful who could come today: friends Eve Dubrow, Michael Boston, Lynn Starr, Nancy Berkall, and Scott Kreeger, as well as two colleagues from the University of Memphis who happened to be in DC, David and Pam Cox. I am thankful for them. Finally--and I am almost done--watching back home in Memphis, I have got colleagues at the University of Memphis' Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law watching, as well as colleagues at the main campus of the university, including our president, Brad Martin. And family and friends in Memphis and San Antonio and other parts of the country watching, I want to thank them all for their support and their confidence. I am here to answer any questions. [The biographical information of Ms. Lipman appears as a submission for the record.] Senator Durbin. One of the widest national broadcasts we have ever had of this Judiciary Committee. [Laughter.] Senator Durbin. Thank you very much. Mr. Bastian, if you would like to make a brief opening statement and introduce your family and friends. STATEMENT OF STANLEY ALLEN BASTIAN, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON Mr. Bastian. Good afternoon, and thank you for that opportunity. And, Senator Durbin and Senator Grassley, I want to thank both of you for inviting me to appear before this Committee and answering your questions regarding my nomination. I would also like to thank Senator Patty Murray for the very kind remarks that she just made about me and for supporting my nomination, and for Senator Cantwell, who has also supported me. I am very pleased today to introduce to the Committee and to acknowledge the support of my family: my wife, Alicia Nakata, who is seated behind me, who is a judge on the Chelan County Superior Court; my daughter Audrey Bastian, who flew in last night from Chicago, where she is teaching high school with the Teach for America program; and my daughter Elenore Bastian, who flew in last night from Walla Walla, Washington, where she is a junior at Whitman College. Thank you, and I am here to answer any questions that you might have. [The biographical information of Mr. Bastian appears as a submission for the record.] Senator Durbin. Thank you. Mr. Shah. STATEMENT OF MANISH S. SHAH, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS Mr. Shah. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member Grassley and to Chairman Leahy as well, for scheduling this hearing. Senator Durbin, I thank you for your support of my nomination. I also thank Senator Kirk for his efforts on my behalf. I also thank President Obama for this nomination, which is the greatest honor of my professional life, and I am deeply humbled by it. My family is here today, and I would like to introduce them to you. My wife, Joanna Grisinger, is here, and without her support and sacrifice, I would not be here today. My mother-in-law, Patricia Grisinger, traveled a great distance to be here, and I appreciate her support. My father-in-law, John Grisinger, was unable to attend the hearing, but I understand he is watching on the webcast. My brother, Dr. Ash Shah, his wife, Rebecca Shah, and their two children, my nephew, Alexander, and my niece, Sonia, are here today, had to juggle their busy schedules to be here today, and I appreciate their support. A very dear family friend, Mrs. Kala Prasad, is here today accompanying, finally, my mother, Mrs. Dina Shah, and I appreciate all the support that my family has given me. And one final word of thanks, my father, Dr. Suresh Shah, passed away last year. He would have been thrilled with this moment for me, and I would like to take the opportunity to at least place his name in the record of this august body as a small token of my thanks. And with that, I am happy to answer any of the questions of the Committee. [The biographical information of Mr. Shah appears as a submission for the record.] Senator Durbin. Thank you. I am sure your father would be honored to see you before us today, and in his memory, we will be remembering him, as your family is at this moment. Let me ask you, Mr. Shah--just a few questions for the three nominees--most of the work which you will probably do on the Federal bench will be of a criminal nature to start with, not exclusively but a lot of criminal work, and there will be many criminal defendants who will stand before you in a courtroom seeking justice, and they will undoubtedly know that your background is primarily that of a criminal prosecutor. They may wonder if they are going to get a fair shake from someone who spent most of their legal career at the other table. What assurance could you give them and this Committee today about that concern? Mr. Shah. Senator, thank you for the question. I can give this Committee my personal assurance that when and if I were fortunate enough to be confirmed, I would absolutely shed the role of an advocate and become the neutral arbiter that I firmly believe the judge must be. For stability and integrity of the rule of law, the judge must be open-minded and fair to all who come before the court. And I will say that it has been my experience as a prosecutor that being a prosecutor is not just being an advocate seeking a conviction at all costs. A prosecutor has to be thoughtful about the very consequential decision to bring a criminal charge, and I have been fortunate enough to experience a prosecutor's office that takes that responsibility very seriously, and I have learned from, I hope, the very best, and I have tried to pass on to others in my office that one should never forget that the choice to bring a criminal charge affects defendants and that one should always consider the vantage point of the defendant when wrestling with issues in criminal prosecution. And while I would be shedding my role as an advocate if I became a judge, I certainly would take with me the appreciation of the gravity of the situation and the importance to everybody before the court of having a fair and open-minded judge. Senator Durbin. Thank you. Mr. Bastian, among other things, you were president of the Washington State Bar Association from 2007 to 2008. You have had an active private practice of your own. What qualities do you look for in a Federal judge if you are going to appear before him? Mr. Bastian. Your Honor, I look to the same qualities that I think I brought my practice. I think that a Federal judge should be fair, should work hard, should give everybody in the courtroom an opportunity to be heard, should listen carefully to the points that they are trying to make, should strive hard to make them feel that they are getting justice in the courtroom even if they are not pleased with the result. And I think all of those qualities I will bring to the bench if I am confirmed, and that is what I look as my role model. Senator Durbin. In response to your questionnaire, you talked about a case that you took to trial in 2009, Bining v. Central Washington Hospital. In that case, you represented a plaintiff diagnosed with cancer who took leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act. The plaintiff was replaced while she was on leave, and when she got better and went back for her job, her employer did not provide her an accommodation. She sued for disability discrimination, and the case resulted in a deadlocked jury. Can you please discuss some of the facts of that case and the work you did on it? Mr. Bastian. That was a case--I generally work as a defense attorney in employment-related matters. In that case I represented the plaintiff. She was a woman who I believed was not provided the accommodations that she was entitled to by her employer. We tried to convince the employer to offer those accommodations prior to filing the lawsuit, and we were not given the relief that we were looking for. We took the matter to trial. We mediated it twice. We still felt that it was important to try the case. And I think the jury was bothered with the accommodations that were offered and with whether or not those were sufficient for what she struggled with. Unfortunately the jury hung, and we did not have a decision from them. We settled the case a few weeks later with mediation, but we got a much better result for her than we would have prior to trial, so I think the trial was a very useful tool to get her the relief that I think she was entitled to. I believe that Ms. Bining is still with us and is still successfully employed. Senator Durbin. More and more cases are headed to mediation. More and more Federal judges retire now instead of going senior status to become mediators. What do you think about this trend? Mr. Bastian. Well, I think mediation is a very important tool in resolving cases, and that is, after all, what we are trying to do, is to get that case resolved after it starts. That is what I always tell my clients when they come in and hire me, that my job is not necessarily to take their case to trial or to get the best result that they might have in mind. My job is to get that dispute resolved. I think, unfortunately, a lot of our courts are backlogged with family law cases, particularly at the State level, with criminal law cases, and it is difficult for civil cases, the type of cases that I have worked on in my career, to get to trial. Therefore, it is important that we always look to settlement conferences, mediations, and arbitrations if necessary to try to resolve that matter. I think it is a very useful tool, and it is a tool that we should always keep in mind for every case. Senator Durbin. Ms. Lipman, you became in-house counsel at the University of Memphis and represented the school for nearly a decade in litigation involving the school. You know that I represent the city of Chicago. You may not know that I am a Chicago Bulls fan, but you can probably guess my next question. Could you tell us about a case you were involved in, a high-profile case involving Derrick Rose as a student at the University of Memphis? Ms. Lipman. Yes, Senator. Thank you. I could probably go on for much longer than you really want to hear about the case. It was a very high profile matter in the city of Memphis. Like in Chicago with your Bulls, the Tigers are very popular in the city, and it is truly the city's team. That was an unfortunate situation where we had a student athlete who played an entire season. We assumed that he was, in fact, eligible to play. We had a wonderful season. It was a joyous year for all Tiger fans--and you may have seen the article I wrote about this--until 2 minutes and 12 seconds to go in the game, we were up by 9, and then it went downhill. After the season was over, after the school year was over, in fact, the school was notified that the student athlete's SAT score was invalidated, which meant that he was not eligible, and we began the NCAA process of essentially trying that matter within the confines of the NCAA. It was an interesting case, had all sorts of different angles to it, from the press' view to fans' view to how the NCAA approaches infractions matters. In the end, the season was invalidated. The NCAA felt--the Committee on Infractions as well as the Infractions Appeals Committee felt that the university should be strictly liable for the student athlete's invalid test score and his ineligibility and, therefore, invalidated the season and required that we repay the bonus money. I will add on behalf of the student athlete, he was never found to have not taken his test. It is simply that he did not get the--we have no proof that he got the notice and was able to respond to the inquiry from the testing service. I would be happy to answer any other questions. We could talk for days. Senator Durbin. I am sure there is a lot more you could say. Senator Grassley. Senator Grassley. I will have different questions, as the Chairman did, for each of you, so do not feel offended if I do not ask each of you the same question. First of all, congratulations for your nomination. I will start with you, Ms. Lipman. Where in the Constitution do you find the right to privacy? That is a philosophical question, but one I would like to have you answer. Ms. Lipman. Well, the Supreme Court has noted that there is a right to privacy in the Fourth Amendment, in the Fourteenth Amendment, has found that right to privacy in several different situations. Senator Grassley. What is your understanding in general terms of the contours of that right to privacy? Ms. Lipman. The Supreme Court, again, has held that there is the right to--in the context of the Fourth Amendment, of course, the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures; in the Fourteenth Amendment, there is marital privacy rights; and other situations like that. Senator Grassley. Yes. I am going to bring up a controversial issue. I am not asking you for your opinion on it. I just want to know how you might approach this as a judge. If confirmed, how would you approach a law that requires physicians performing abortions to have hospital admitting procedures? I am not asking how you would decide the case, but I am interested in what factors you would consider and what weight you would give to those factors. Ms. Lipman. Well, Senator, as a district court judge, my job is to look to the facts of the case and then look to precedent and to look to what the Sixth Circuit has instructed the judge to look to as well as the Supreme Court. So my approach to the case would be to look to case precedent, to analyze the facts in front of me, and to apply that precedent. Senator Grassley. Okay. Because of your involvement in the Memphis Regional Planned Parenthood, I would ask you maybe a general description of your roles, but more specifically, what policies have you been involved in, in crafting, advocating for, or advising on while associated with that organization? Ms. Lipman. Certainly, Senator. My role--as you know, I served as a board member and as board chair of the local affiliate of Planned Parenthood. My role during that time was really to try and help the organization in terms of their operations. It had not been an affiliate that was operated in a very business-like fashion, and so the concentration of my time and effort during that time period was to help right the ship, so to speak, to help it operate in a more efficient way. In terms of policies, it was not a time where I participated in policies, so I--that was my role at the time. Senator Grassley. Okay. Mr. Bastian, in 2007, as president of the Washington State Bar Association, you advocated for the fundamental right to Government-provided counsel for low-income litigants in civil matters. What is the constitutional provision, statute, precedent, or legal analysis you used to determine this fundamental right? Mr. Bastian. Well, I think we were looking to the language of the Constitution and equal justice for all, and we were faced with a problem of people coming into the courtrooms without lawyers because they could not afford them, and it would be very difficult for the judge--it would be very difficult for them to find their way through the civil procedure rules and the rules of law. It is difficult for the judge to help them sort that out, and it clogs the system. And I think that it is important for all litigants to have access to an attorney if they can afford it, certainly, and if they cannot, that is one of the things I have done, as the former chair now, not the chair of the local Equal Justice Coalition, to try to advocate for funding for that. So we do think it is important, and unfortunately, too many litigants cannot afford lawyers, and that creates quite a strain on the civil justice system. Senator Grassley. If confirmed as a Federal trial judge, you might preside over cases involving indigent pro se litigants. Would you remain impartial in those circumstances? Or would you feel one party is being denied equal justice because they are not represented? Mr. Bastian. Senator, my job as a trial judge is to remain impartial on all cases, independent of whether the parties are represented by counsel or not. I think the challenge that your example presents is that sometimes it is difficult for a judge to discern exactly what the unrepresented party is advocating or is trying to argue. That is a challenge that I am prepared to meet, but I can assure you that I will remain impartial regardless of whether they are represented or not represented. Senator Grassley. Okay. You were past president of the State bar, but the board's presiding officer. You broke with the bar's--the association's tradition of abstaining from political matters to join a resolution signed by bar association board of Governors supporting equal access for same-sex couples, civil marriage, and its attendant legal rights and obligations afterwards, and those few words are in quotes. I should have said that. It appears this decision was made without polling bar association members. Why did you feel that it was necessary to break with the norm of abstaining from political matters? Mr. Bastian. Well, I am not sure that I agree with the facts as you stated them. As the president of the board of Governors, I do not have a vote, and I did not vote at that particular meeting. I did sign the resolution because that is my job as president to do, acknowledging that the board has taken---- Senator Grassley. Well, then, I am wrong in assuming you were part of that decision then. If I am wrong, you can tell me I am wrong. Mr. Bastian. I do not think you are wrong, Senator Grassley. However, I do not believe that we broke from a longstanding tradition in terms of taking a position on a political matter. It clearly does have political import, but our job as the board of Governors and my job as president of the board was to guide the bar in taking positions on legislation when asked to, if that legislation impacted the practice of law and the administration of justice. And so it was the decision of the board of Governors during the time that I was president that supporting marriage equality legislation, in fact, did impact the practice of law and the administration of justice, and that is why they took that position. We did not poll the members of the bar, but we knew that it would be--you know, there would be opposition to it, and there was. But what we did to plan for that resolution, for about 2 years we held seminars throughout the State of Washington. We invited all members of the bar to come. We offered them CLE credits to encourage them to attend, and we offered everybody an opportunity to be heard on it before that vote was taken. So we felt that we did involve the bar as much as we could. Senator Grassley. Last question. You said in 2007 that diversity is a journey not a destination. ``The public must trust that justice will be delivered in a fair and impartial manner, but this trust can be easily lost if lawyers and judges do not reflect the public they serve.'' Are you saying that the public cannot trust people who do not reflect their own personal demographics? Mr. Bastian. No, not at all. I think what I was trying to do was encourage debate and thought on the part of the members of the bar that it is important to have diversity both in the legal profession, those serving as lawyers and those serving as judges. However, I think all of those people who are serving as both lawyers and judges are all trained in the same legal system, all trained to respect the rule of law, and I would expect that all of them, regardless of their race, their gender, their geographic area, or their age, all of them would approach their role equally. But it is important to cast the net widely and to have a diverse membership. Senator Grassley. Mr. Shah, I am going to ask you something I have got a big interest in, is protecting whistleblowers. At CLE on ethics and internal investigations, you addressed whistleblower as well as company counsel being present for employee interviews by Government agencies. Would you please further describe your experience with whistleblower cases? Mr. Shah. Yes, thank you, Senator, for the question. In my current practice at the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Criminal Division, it is not uncommon for matters to be referred for potential criminal investigation and prosecution that were initiated by civil litigants, possibly filing a False Claims Act case, qui tam litigation, as well as, more broadly speaking, it is not uncommon for individuals who are insiders in corporations or institutions to report wrongdoing that they have observed in the course of their employment to the authorities. And so in my experience as a criminal prosecutor, I have had occasion to review cases that were either initiated or a byproduct of some type of whistleblower complaint. It is not an uncommon feature of criminal investigation. Senator Grassley. Okay. And in a general way, give me your view on whistleblower assertions. Mr. Shah. Well, Senator, the general view of whistleblower assertions in my experience is really no different than assertions from anyone. Every case requires investigation and thoughtful deliberation to determine the facts in any given case, without regard to the nature of the person making the complaint being labeled a ``whistleblower'' or not. Senator Grassley. I think you just answered another question, so I will go on. Would you comment on particular or special ethical considerations that are raised by employee interviews by Government agents? Mr. Shah. Well, in my experience, Senator, one of the ethical considerations that comes into play when agents are interviewing employees is the question of their representation. If the corporation is represented by an attorney, it is often the case that that attorney may also be the attorney for the individual employees, and those raise ethical questions with regard to having contact with individuals who are represented by attorneys, and it has been my experience that we look very carefully at the ethical rules that might apply before authorizing an agent to speak to anyone who may or may not be represented. Senator Grassley. Okay. My last question. On a number of occasions, you addressed the University of Chicago Law School regarding Federal sentencing. In your notes, you stated, ``The prosecutor is or should be thinking about all defendants currently in the system, past and future defendants, victims and future victims, and policy goals that are set to achieve societal interests.'' Do you believe that the role of a prosecutor is to advance a policy agenda? Mr. Shah. Senator, thank you for the question. I think the comment that I was making in those talks was to address the issue from the prosecutor's perspective, which is to enforce the law and often enforce judgments that are made by prosecutors about the types of crimes that ought to be investigated and prosecuted. And it is on occasion a judgment made by the executive branch as to what crimes ought to be investigated and prosecuted. And those are necessarily policy judgments, but are made by the appropriate officials of the executive branch in seeking out criminal prosecution. Senator Grassley. Then in your prospective position as a Federal judge, what weight would you give to societal interests in deciding cases or controversies? Mr. Shah. Thank you for the question, Senator. None. My approach would be to study the text of whatever provision were before me and to apply the law according to precedent. Senator Grassley. Thanks to all of you. Senator Durbin. Thanks, Senator Grassley. There will be a statement for the record from Congressman Steve Cohen entered in support of Sheryl Lipman. [The prepared statement of Representative Cohen appears as a submission for the record.] Senator Durbin. And Senator Cantwell regrets that she could not be here today to speak personally in favor of Mr. Bastian, but gives her assurance that she will join in supporting his nomination and speak on the floor about his qualifications for this judge. Mr. Shah, thank you so much for being here, and I would have to say in just a moment of personal pride, we have been able to work out judicial appointments in Illinois, sometimes with the great cooperation of my friend here, on a very bipartisan basis, and the same is true of your nomination. We are very proud of the fact that you have stepped forward and are willing to serve in this capacity, and I think that you will be a good person to support before the Committee and the full Senate. We will leave the record open for any questions that might be sent your way. The quicker you can respond, the quicker you might even get on the Committee calendar. So we ask you to try to do that in a thoughtful way and as quickly as possible. We thank you and all of your friends and relatives for being with us today, and if there is nothing further, the Committee will stand adjourned. [Whereupon, at 3 p.m., the Committee was adjourned.] [Additional material submitted for the record follows.] A P P E N D I X Additional Material Submitted for the Record [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] NOMINATION OF DAVID JEREMIAH BARRON, NOMINEE TO BE CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT ---------- WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 2013 United States Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC. The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:35 p.m., in Room SD-226, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Patrick J. Leahy, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. Present: Senators Leahy, Grassley, Lee, and Cruz. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. PATRICK J. LEAHY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF VERMONT Chairman Leahy. Today we are going to welcome David Barron, a professor at Harvard Law School and President Obama's nominee to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. I had hoped to also include the five nominees for the judicial emergency vacancies in the District of Arizona in this hearing, but we have not yet received the blue slips from the Arizona Senators. So once they return those blue slips, we can include them. Before we start the hearing, I would note that one of my heroes is here: Justice John Paul Stevens. He is here on behalf of Mr. Barron, his former law clerk, and if we were a couple minutes late, it is because Justice Stevens and I have to get caught up when we see each other and tell tales. But, Justice, it is always great to see you, and thank you for being here. Do you wish to say something? Senator Grassley. Oh, are you ready for me? Chairman Leahy. Sure. Senator Grassley. Do you have a statement? Chairman Leahy. I just did. Senator Grassley. Then I will assume some of his time. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CHUCK GRASSLEY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF IOWA Senator Grassley. Today we are holding the 17th judicial nomination hearing of the year, during which we will have considered a total of 58 judicial nominees. I would note this is the fourth nomination hearing in 4 weeks, so anyone who says Republicans are engaging in unprecedented obstruction is ignoring the cooperation that we Republicans have shown and I as Ranking Member trying to work with the Chairman. Compare the record on hearings for President Obama this year with how President Bush was treated in the fifth year of his Presidency. In 2005, the final judicial nomination hearing was held on November 15th. That was not the 17th hearing of the year, as we have done this year, but only the sixth hearing on lower court judges. During those six hearings we heard from not 58 judicial nominees, but only 15 district and circuit nominees. How are we doing this year compared to last year? 2012 was a very productive year for judicial nominations. In fact, in the 112th Congress, President Obama had more district judges confirmed than were confirmed in any of the previous eight Congresses. Our work in Committee last year contributed to that accomplishment when we held 10 hearings for 41 judicial nominees. In addition, I would like to have everybody be reminded that we have now confirmed 38 lower court Article III judicial nominees this year. That is more than two and a half times the number confirmed at a similar stage in President Bush's second term, when only 14 district and circuit nominees had been confirmed. In total, the Senate has confirmed 209 lower court Article III judges. This includes a significant number of women and minority nominees. We could have confirmed more judges over the last couple of weeks, but the Senate majority decided to take precious floor time for a diversionary political exercise rather than confirming additional judges. Now, as I explained earlier this week, the other side has been working diligently to manufacture a crisis on the D.C. Circuit. And in order to support their claim that the Republicans are obstructing nominees, it appears the other side is doing a sleight of hand on the data as well. Recently, one of my colleagues stated that the Senate Republicans have filibustered 34 of President Obama's nominees. So if you pay attention, you would know that Republicans have filibustered only a handful of nominees. So what are the facts? How does the other side get to 34? To begin with, fully one-half of these cloture petitions were filed by the majority on day one as a procedural gimmick and were totally unnecessary. None of those 17 cloture petitions required a vote. Every cloture petition was withdrawn, and every single one of these nominees was confirmed. So that was just another part of manufacturing a crisis. So that leaves us 17 of the 34. But Republicans have not filibustered anywhere close to 17 nominees. So, again, the real story is: Of the remaining 17 cloture petitions, 6 of those were also withdrawn. That leaves only 11 nominees who have actually faced a cloture vote. One of these nominees had 2 cloture votes, for a total of 12 cloture votes. Yet 6 of those 11 nominees were confirmed. That leaves only 5 nominees who have failed to achieve cloture vote. So to sum up, the majority claimed earlier this week, with great fanfare, that Republicans had filibustered 34 nominees, when we have actually stopped 5 nominees. And of those five, three are still pending in the Senate, leaving only two nominees actually defeated by filibuster. I suppose that is what one is required to do in order to overstate the record established during this administration compared to what it was during the Bush administration. During the Bush administration, Senate Democrats truly were unprecedented in their use of cloture against judicial nominees. In fact, they forced 30 cloture votes on judicial nominees, including a Supreme Court nominee. So that is the factual record: 30 cloture votes during the Bush administration, 12 cloture votes during President Obama's term. Of those 30 cloture votes faced by President Bush's nominees, Senate Democrats obstructed nominees 20 times. So to emphasize a point, during the Bush administration 20 cloture motions failed. Senate Democrats continued to obstruct judicial nominees 20 times. So I think it is clear which party holds the record on delaying or obstructing confirmation. The number of cloture votes demanded by Senate Democrats on President Bush's nominees is two and a half times the number of cloture votes on President Obama's nominees. The number of times Senate Democrats refused to end debate is nearly three times what Republicans have done. Democrats clearly hold the record on delaying and obstructing. I think we have treated President Obama in a fair manner, and he enjoys an outstanding record for his judicial nominees. One final point on this charge that Republicans obstruct has left the Federal judiciary with high vacancies. The fact is President Obama's initial delay in nominations was the primary factor in the lower number of confirmations during the first term, resulting in the high number of vacancies. Even now, 42 of 93 vacancies have no nominee. That is 45 percent of the vacancies with no pending nomination before the Senate. While this percentage recently has been reduced, it was the case for most of the Obama Presidency that the majority of vacancies had no nominee. Of the 38 judicial emergencies, 18 have no nominee. That would be 47 percent. The Senate cannot be held responsible for these vacancies where almost half the seats have no nominee. Having set the record straight, let me now address today's nomination. I welcome the nominee, his family, and guests. This nomination has been pending in the Senate just 55 calendar days. I would note that President Bush's circuit nominees waited an average of 246 days for a hearing, more than four times the wait of this nominee. Mr. Barron has an extensive record as an academic. He has written on a wide range of subjects. I think it would be fair to say that I probably do not agree with much of what he has written. But that is not necessarily the standard for my review of his qualifications to sit on the Federal bench. I am interested in hearing his views on executive authority; on his work while on the Office of Legal Counsel; on his judicial philosophy, particularly what he calls ``progressive constitutional outcomes''; and on a variety of other topics. I expect to address some of these today and will likely have a significant number of questions for answer in writing. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Leahy. Thank you. This discussion is so fascinating, I have almost forgotten that we are here for Mr. Barron's nomination. But I do share the Ranking Member's concern about the number of vacancies on the Federal bench, and I would note there are 17 nominations pending on the Senate floor waiting for clearance by the Republicans, and we can lower that vacancy number by 17 this afternoon just by allowing them to be voted on. Mr. Barron, please step forward. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give before the Committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? Mr. Barron. I do. Chairman Leahy. Mr. Barron, I have had the opportunity to meet your family when I came in, but please, so that someday in the Barron family archives, when they go back and find the transcript of this hearing, you will want to know who was here. So would you please tell me who you have here with you? Mr. Barron. I just want to make sure I do not forget someone, if that is what is going to be---- Chairman Leahy. If you do, you are the one that is going to have to answer to it, not me. [Laughter.] Chairman Leahy. Please go ahead, sir. STATEMENT OF DAVID JEREMIAH BARRON, NOMINEE TO BE CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT Mr. Barron. First, I just want to express my great thanks to you, Senator Leahy, for chairing the hearing today, and Ranking Member Grassley for convening it, Senator Lee for being here, to the President for nominating me, and I just would like to introduce my family to you. Right behind me is my wife, Juliette Kayyem, and next to her are my three children: my oldest, my daughter, Cecelia; my oldest son, Leo; and my youngest son, Jeremiah. Jeremiah told me he had an awesome gym class that he had to miss, so I appreciate his sacrifice for being here. Then Mallory Heath, who helps us with the kids, but we hope not this afternoon. And then over here is my parents. That is my father, Jerome Barron, who taught constitutional law for over half a century, much of it at George Washington, just retired last year. And then my mother, who is an attorney in her own right, Myra Barron. And then back this way I have a contingent of in-laws who are enthusiastic, and they have come. And that is my father-in- law, Robert Kayyem, and my mother-in-law, Milly Kayyem. And then my sister-in-law and her husband, Marisa Kayyem and James Watts. And then my brother-in-law, John Kayyem. And then if I may, one other guest that I would like to just say something about, which is Justice Stevens, who I had the honor of clerking for and who has come here today. He instilled in me, as he has instilled in all of his law clerks, a deep reverence for the role of the Federal judiciary, so it is a particular honor to be able to testify before you today with him present. [The biographical information of Mr. Barron appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman Leahy. I might note that the very first Justice of the Supreme Court I got to vote on as a Member of the U.S. Senate was John Paul Stevens. That was a very difficult confirmation. I think he was confirmed on one day, heard on the next, and passed out of the Senate on the third. It was not quite that much, but it was not much longer than that. It was just a very few days, and I know that in later years hearing President Ford speak of his pleasure in appointing him, and he was also confirmed unanimously. Did you have a statement you wished to make, Mr. Barron? Mr. Barron. No, Senator. I am fine. Chairman Leahy. Thank you. Well, you have spent much of your career as a professor of law at Harvard Law School and a career that, by every report that we have, was a very distinguished one. But what is going to be the most difficult aspect if your transition from being a professor of law to a Federal court of appeals judge, if you are confirmed? Mr. Barron. Senator, thank you for the question. It is a very different job. The role of an academic in teaching has certain attributes to it that are, I think, relevant. They teach you to be open minded, to consider the weak points and arguments, but also to learn how to see arguments in their best light, and to teach students that. But the role of an academic is to think about broad patterns of law in more abstract ways, and I know from my experience in the Government that the actual legal questions when you have to give advice on them is to think about them in their particularity in connection with precedent and the role of precedent. And so going to the Federal bench really will call upon those skills in particular. Chairman Leahy. There is the obvious precedents of your own circuit, the First Circuit, that you would agree should be ignored only--well, not ignored but reversed only in the most extraordinary circumstances. Is that correct? Mr. Barron. It is correct, and also never by a member of a panel. Chairman Leahy. That is right. And, of course, if it is a decision by the Supreme Court, as the circuit court you are bound by it, are you not? Mr. Barron. Absolutely. Chairman Leahy. You know, I am constantly in readings, as we all are, looking at, I think, the extraordinary wisdom of our Founders of this country and the three branches of Government--two of them, of course, political, elected and so forth. The judiciary is not. It is supposed to stay out of politics. It is an undemocratic branch of our Government in that sense. And in the Federal judiciary, unlike in some State courts, this is a lifetime position. Like many on this panel, I have argued a lot of cases in a lot of different courts--State, Federal, courts of appeals. I have always felt that whoever the litigant is, when they come in there, they should look at the judge and figure that they are not going to be--their case is not going to ride on who they are, whether they are Republican, Democrat, plaintiff, defendant, State respondent, whatever, rich, poor, so on. Now, obviously any judge has their own feelings, their own opinions on things, personal opinions. But can you tell us as a panel, whether I am arguing before you or anybody else--well, take it out of the realm of me arguing--no matter who the person is arguing, no matter who the two sides are, no matter what the issue is, that you can take it squarely and say, ``I will make this on the merits and on the law''? Mr. Barron. Absolutely, Senator. The reason our rule-of-law system works as well as it does is precisely because the judges that people appear before have an obligation to set aside their personal views and decide it solely on the law, and it is what I am committed to doing and pledge would to do. Chairman Leahy. You also have to decide when you have a conflict of interest. I had a man who was a part-time Vermonter. While we had differing views of things, we became, I believe, good friends. There was an area where I disagreed with him, and that was later Chief Justice William Rehnquist. But prior to becoming Associate Justice on the Court, he served as Assistant Attorney General of the Office of Legal Counsel, and after he was confirmed as Justice, he participated in a case called Laird v. Tatum, where he cast the deciding vote in a 5-4 decision and dismissed the plaintiff's claims regarding a domestic surveillance program. The reason I mention this, he refused to recuse himself even though he testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee defending the program as constitutional while he was the head of the OLC. So he had worked on this for some time, testified in defense of it, but then decided a case and whether it was constitutional or not. Now, many of us felt--and I heard this from both Republicans and Democrats--that this may have been a violation of judicial ethics. Now, I know you cannot disclose all the issues while you worked at the Justice Department, but what do you see as a recusal standard? What type of cases are you going to recuse yourself from? Mr. Barron. Senator, the standards have been set forth by Congress and then also set forth in the Canons of Judicial Ethics, and the standard is not just that there be no conflict but that there not even be an appearance of a conflict, and that would be the standard that I would honor in making these decisions, on executive branch lawyers' privilege to have the trust of making a variety of difficult decisions on very sensitive matters, and I think it is incumbent upon people who have those roles to take seriously, if they do have the honor of becoming a judge, to consider in the precise factual circumstances whether an appearance of a conflict would arise, and if it would, to recuse oneself from the case. Chairman Leahy. I know that we did not ask Chief Justice Rehnquist or Justice Scalia or Judge Bybee of the Ninth Circuit about all the cases they worked on in the OLC, nor are we going to ask you. But I think we have to look for the most transparency as possible. There was one very high profile--and I realize my time has gone over, but I just discussed this with Senator Grassley, and he has no objection. Because when you led the Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department, during that time the memo authorizing the targeted killings of U.S. citizens overseas was issued. Now, I have some serious concerns about the legal justification for such targeted killings. What is your view-- first, what is your view on the legal and constitutional grounds for the targeted killing of an American overseas using a drone? And, second, how imminent must the threat to national security posed by such an individual be in order to justify such a strike? Mr. Barron. Senator, thank you for the opportunity to address the questions that you have asked. On the advice that may have been given by the Justice Department, you know, because of classification issues and confidentiality obligations, I do not feel free to discuss that. But in terms of the legal principles and legal issues that one has to consider, I do have some things that I would like to say in that regard. It is as weighty an issue as arises in the legal system when a U.S. citizen is involved in an overseas operation, and the issue concerns the use of lethal force. And in thinking through those questions, there are three considerations, I think, that at a general level are critical. The first is to inquire into the source of authority that the President is relying on and, in particular, whether the President is relying on an authorization that Congress has provided in connection with an armed conflict so that the operation would be directed and not against a U.S. citizen abstractly but against a person who was thought to be an enemy in that armed conflict. It would also be critical to see whether Congress had in any manner, in any measure limited the scope of that authority through other statutes that, pursuant to their broad war powers, they may have enacted. And in construing those authorities, it would also be important to consider the laws of war that inform the statutory grants of authority that had been given to the President. But that is only on the authority side. There is also a question of constitutional guarantees that citizens enjoy, and---- Chairman Leahy. And due process. Mr. Barron. And the constitutional guarantees are both substantive due process, procedural due process, Fourth Amendment concerns, and all of those have to be considered as to how they may apply in that circumstance. In considering those questions, there is a variety of things that are going to be relevant to it. It is an overseas operation in the circumstance that you are talking about, and it matters where it has happened and what alternatives might be available to the Government. You would want to know a whole bunch of factual circumstances about the nature of the circumstances on the ground, who the actor was, who might be the subject of such an operation. And I cannot stress that last point enough. The type of questions that you are asking about is a question that can only be answered, it seems to me, with the full understanding of the specific factual circumstances that are at issue. And the decision about it cannot stray from those factual considerations. And then the last point, Senator, would be that in all the authorities and limitations that I mentioned, one has to take account of the precedents and the body of precedents that has developed giving shape and content to what the meaning of those provisions are. Chairman Leahy. Thank you. Thank you very much. Senator Grassley, I thank you for your usual courtesy. Senator Grassley. Well, thank you very much. My first question is approaching the issue he brought up just from a different standpoint, more from how it got public. And I do not expect you to comment on the fact that I happen to believe that this administration is not meeting its most--its comment that it is going to be the most transparent in history, but it seems ironic that in some accounts, the administration has pursued leakers and the media that publishes classified information more aggressively than any other administration in history. At the same time, however, the administration appears to selectively declassify certain information based upon some argument of political considerations. So I think you know what I am getting at. I have some questions about the leaked Office of Legal Counsel memo on targeted killings. October 8, 2011, Dan Savage, New York Times, wrote an extensive article discussing the memo. February of this year, the Chairman and I sent a letter to the President requesting access to the memo. Eventually, as the Chairman noted, in April the administration made the memo available to Members of this Committee. According to the Times, you authored the memo. The Times article was highly detailed and makes it clear that the author had access to the classified memo. One commenter pointed out that Mr. Savage had had access to each discrete agreement, knew who the principal authors of that document were, and even knew the memo's page length. Please explain how Mr. Savage came to have access to this classified memo. And then I have a three-part along that line: A, who gave Mr. Savage access to the memo? B, whether or not any administration official was authorized to grant him access? C, whether or not any administration official gave access without authorization? Mr. Barron. Senator Grassley, I have no idea what source the reporter in question may have been relying on. Senator Grassley. Okay. I am going to continue my questioning, and that does not mean I do not believe what you just told me. Did Mr. Savage or anybody else from the New York Times contact you before publishing this story? Mr. Barron. Yes, Senator. Senator Grassley. Did you discuss any part of the memo with him? Mr. Barron. No, Senator. Senator Grassley. Have you spoken to Mr. Savage or anyone from the New York Times about this memo at any point before or after the New York Times published this report? Mr. Barron. No, Senator. Senator Grassley. Have you ever spoken to any reporter about this memo? Mr. Barron. No, Senator. Senator Grassley. Have you participated in any way in the unauthorized disclosure of the memo to any third party? Mr. Barron. Absolutely no, Senator. Senator Grassley. One scholar criticized the administration for ``their refusal to save''--let me start over--``their refusal to say anything about it''--meaning the memo--``and at the same time essentially conducting the foreign policy of the United States by leaked journalism.'' What is the justification for giving this information to a reporter but not to the general public in a redacted format consistent with national security? Mr. Barron. Senator, I am not sure I am in a position to answer the question exactly as you posed. Senator Grassley. Why don't you ask the question of yourself and answer it, and I will see if that satisfies me. [Laughter.] Mr. Barron. Okay. I appreciate the chance to do that. Transparency is an important value. As your question suggests, classification is a critical value as well. As an attorney giving advice to the executive branch, the authority to decide when to declassify something or when to waive a privilege does not reside with the attorney. It resides ultimately with the executive branch itself. And I respect the process by which they make those decisions. As you suggest, they should be made with integrity. Senator Grassley. As I study this response you just gave to me, I may have a followup question for answer in writing. Now I want to go to another issue. You have been highly critical of previous administration approaches to the war on terror. In fact, in a 2006 radio interview, you were asked whether John Yoo, who worked in the same OLC office that you did, was a war criminal. You said, ``People who take positions saying that it is legal for U.S. personnel to engage in torture have to expect that they are going to be raising questions about whether they are authorizing war crimes.'' You went on to say, ``It is not my place to say whether anyone committed crimes.'' So in 2006, you suggested John Yoo may have authorized war crimes. Yet according to the New York Times, you authored a memo authorizing targeted killings of U.S. citizens abroad without due process. How do you distinguish between these two scenarios from a constitutional standpoint? Mr. Barron. Thank you, Senator. I think I should just say, since there is a reference to this memo that is coming up repeatedly, that because of the classification issues and the attorney-client privilege and other forms of privilege that apply, I do not want to be taken to be in any sense confirming the existence of the particular memo that was reported in the New York Times. But I say that only just to make that clear. On the question that you raise, I am familiar with the interview in which I said that I had every reason to believe that Professor Yoo was acting in good faith when he offered the legal judgments that he did. But I was objecting in particular, and did on a number of occasions, to one particular form of constitutional argument that was being made in that administration, and it was a view of the President's power to act in violation of a statute that Congress had enacted restricting the rights or the authorities of the President during wartime. I thought that that claim that the President alone was entitled to make those decisions was an overly broad claim, and that position ultimately was withdrawn, limited by attorneys within the Bush administration itself. Senator Grassley. Yes. So I think what I heard you say is, just what you said is that distinguishing between your position as you stated it in the radio program and your memo versus what you said. Is that what you just told me? Mr. Barron. Senator, I cannot speak to the merits of the memo, but what I am saying is that the particular concern that I was raising was a concern about the President acting in contravention of a statute on the ground that Congress could not limit his wartime powers. Senator Grassley. To this very day, do you believe that Professor Yoo potentially authorized war crimes? Mr. Barron. Senator, I do not quite know how to answer that question in the following sense, which is I do not believe Professor Yoo, even though I disagree with his arguments, did anything unlawful in any respect. And if there is any suggestion that that is what I was suggesting, I regret it and do not take that as my position. With respect to the question you asked and the way you pose it, I am just hesitant to ask because I think it is hard to answer it without taking a position as to what the particular meaning of a criminal statute is in a particularized case. And I think given the position that I am before you seeking, I do not think it is appropriate for me to take a view on whether particular conduct was or was not criminal in a specific circumstance. Senator Grassley. I will have to quite in a couple of minutes because I am over the time that you--well, I will just stop whenever--I think it is about 2 more minutes. You have written about progressive and conservative constitutionalism. I would like to have you explain those terms and which of those terms best describes your own view. Mr. Barron. Senator, I am glad to ha"
