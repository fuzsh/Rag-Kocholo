Sonia Agarwal was last seen in a Vivek movie Palakkattu Madhavan last year, after which she shifted her interest to a reality show on TV. Now, after a gap, the actress is back in tinsel town with the movie Saaya. Directed by Pazhanivel, the movie belongs to the horror genre and the director claims that it is totally different from the routine ghost movies you come across. “Saaya means energy or power.

The film brings out the connection between Saaya and soul power. Unlike the usual ghost films in which the ghost takes revenge and scares the audiences, they are shown here as good souls who help society, particularly students”, he says.

Sonia will be seen as a forest officer who dons a khaki uniform. “There are a few daredevil stunts for Sonia, which we shot in the dense forests. Sonia took proper training and performed without a stunt double. The movie will give an action heroine image to her”, the director reveals. While newcomer Santhosh is the hero, Gayathri of Touring Talkies fame and Gauthami Choudhary play the female characters.
