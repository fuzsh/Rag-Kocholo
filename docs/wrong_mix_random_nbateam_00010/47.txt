Srikanth and Sonia Agarwal's film, Sadhurangam which has been languishing in the cans for the longest time has been brought back from the dead and will be released in the first week of October. Producer Durairaj said that all who have seen the film were blown away and demanded to know why such a good film had not released earlier.

A combination of financial difficulties and other problems had been the cause but now Sadhurangam will hit the screens. Director Karu Palaniappan who made the delightful Parthiban Kanavu has made this film and word is that it is very good.
