Vyzralek, 75, Bismarck, died Feb. 7, 2014, at St. Alexius Medical Center, Bismarck. Services will be held at 10 a.m. Tuesday, Feb. 11, at Bismarck Funeral Home. Burial will be at St. Mary’s Cemetery, Bismarck. Visitation will be one hour prior to services on Tuesday.\n\nFrank E. Vyzralek was born Nov. 11, 1938, in Alexandria, Minn., the only child of Frank V. and Margaret (Torgerson) Vyzralek. He attended Fargo public schools and graduated from Fargo Central High School. He served in the North Dakota Air National Guard from 1956-62.\n\nFrank graduated with a bachelor’s of science degree in business economics from North Dakota State University in 1963. He continued his graduate education at NDSU in history, sociology and politics. He began working for the State Historical Society of North Dakota as a researcher in 1969. In 1971, he became an archivist for the agency and in 1977 was appointed to the new position of state archivist. He served as associate editor of North Dakota History from 1969-73. Frank logged many miles to locate and transfer thousands of local and state agency files to the State Archives.\n\nIn 1981, he left the State Historical Society to serve as interim director of the North Dakota Humanities Council. From 1981 to the present he has owned Great Plains Research, a private company that performs historical research for companies and governmental agencies. A dedicated historian, Frank published numerous articles in North Dakota History. In 2008, he received the Larry Rowen Remele Award at the Northern Great Plains History Conference. He was active in researching and publishing state and regional history. His research passions took him across the state in search of the history of railroads, depots, place names, photographers, baseball and other historical interests.\n\nFrank was a member of Valley City Lodge No. 7, A.F.&A.M., in 1960 he was raised a Master Mason. He was also active in the Bismarck Historical Society, the North Dakota Historical Society of Germans from Russia (Germans from Russia Heritage Society), and many others.\n\nFrank E. Vyzralek and Dolores E. Barnard were married in 1981 at the Cathedral of the Holy Spirit, Bismarck.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Dolores B. Vyzralek, Bismarck.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents.\n\nSource: Bismarck Tribune, February 9, 2014\n\nSCOPE AND CONTENT\n\nThe Frank Vyzralek Papers date from ca. 1832 to 2014 and occupy 110 feet. The papers are divided into four Series: Research Papers, Personal Papers, Photographs and Audiovisual materials. Artifacts with the collection were removed and transferred to the Museum Division of the State Historical Society of North Dakota in 2016.\n\nSeries I, Research Papers, ca. 1832-2012, contains 14 Subseries: Agriculture, Arts and Entertainment, Business and Industry, City and Town Life, Education, Ethnicity, Indians of North America, History, Military, People, Places, Politics and Government, Religion and Transportation.\n\nThe bulk of the Series consists of newspaper clippings which were typed and organized by Vyzralek, along with other published materials that aided his research. Many, but not all, of the Subseries in the Research Papers Series include manuscripts by Vyzralek and documentation of his involvement in publications, exhibits, presentations, and other projects. Files of source material are dated according to the date published, while manuscripts and project files are dated according to the year they were created.\n\nBoth the strength and weakness of the Research Papers Series lies in the vast variety of subjects covered. Vyzralek was interested in so many areas of North Dakota history that he was often unable to commit his research to a particular area and as a result was unable to complete projects and publications that he started. Moreover, because Vyzralek aimed to document these topics statewide, in every county and often in every town, many of the research areas are not in depth. At the same time, the Research Papers are a good source for published materials, primarily newspaper clippings, about interesting topics in North Dakota history. Researchers can build from the Vyzralek's work, with the understanding that the comprehensiveness of information in the Series covered varies by topic.\n\nSubseries I, Agriculture, 1886-1994, measures .25 foot and is arranged alphabetically by name of subject file. The agriculture subject files primarily consist of copied newspaper clippings, but also include information copied from books, magazines, and other published sources. There are no manuscripts or project files in the Subseries.\n\nSubseries II, Arts and Entertainment, ca. 1870s-2011, measures 5.25 feet and is arranged into the following Sub-Subseries: Architecture, Art, Bands, Chautauqua, Fairs and Celebrations, Literary works, Motion Picture, Photographers, Radio, Rodeos and Wild West Shows, Sports, and Theaters.\n\nSub-Subseries I, Architecture, 1880s-1994, measures .5 foot and consists of sources compiled by Vyzralek for the manuscript \"The Firm of Buechner & Orth and North Dakota County Courthouse Architecture, 1905-1920,\" and during his research on various North Dakota buildings and architects for the North Dakota Historic Buildings Survey and the North Dakota State Historic Preservation Office.
