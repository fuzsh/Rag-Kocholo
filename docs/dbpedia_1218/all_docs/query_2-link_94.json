        "text": "October 4, 1906\n\nMy dear Harold.\n\nThe advent of Nayland fair reminds us that the Autumn has well set in again, and the pig killing season commenced in the village. The steam organ with the American galloping horses is fixed, as usual within a few feet of the schoolroom windows but as the business of the day does not commence until the afternoon lessons are nearly over, it does not really\n\nPage 2\n\ninterfere much with lessons. Edgar returned home last evening, having enjoyed a fortnight with Van and a week at aunt Lucy's very much. Lewis, Rees and Kitty were all at home, Edgar and Lewis went over one Saturday afternoon and took Bob out and divided their time between Ramsgate and Margate and Westgate. We are half expecting Charlie down for a few days, but we feel no certainty in his arrangements until the last moment arrives and he appears. After Edgar has returned to Oxford Mater and I may go up to London for a few days and refresh ourselves with a few plays, as we never go up to a matinee now. Aunt Isabella and Dolly are still staying in Eastbourne. The latter does not get on very satisfactorily, I believe her powers of digestions are at fault, it must be nearly a year since she began to go downhill. Mr Todd was presented with a handsome piece of plate by the Wax Chandlers company last month to commemorate this connection of 50 years with the company. Gerald selected a\n\nPage 3\n\nnew kind of American beaten silver work, very artistic I believe, but I think the old gentleman would have preferred something he understood better with an inscription upon it.\n\nI suppose you are living within your income and have not had to touch your nest egg in the bank at Christchurch. Charlie expects to put by 50 pounds his first year. This will not bad as there are always special expenses on first starting a house.\n\nLove from us all.\n\nYour affectionate father.\n\nEdward L. Fenn\n\nWhen you can send us any pictures or photographs of persons or places about you wish your like to see them.\n\nELF.\n\n40. Edward's Letters 27: To His Son Harry In NZ, Dated 11 Oct 1906, 25 Oct 1906, 2 Nov 1906.\n\nAlston Court\n\nNayland\n\nOctober 11, 1906\n\nMy dear Harold.\n\nAs week by week rolls by this has I wonder what I can find of any interest to you and I am afraid you will conclude that my stock of news is of the slenderest\n\nEdgar leaves us tomorrow for Oxford, I hope he is deriving some good from it all but I cannot at present see much result in his conversation or interests, some of this however must be ascribed to shyness. I shall be anxious to hear the result of Vans interviews\n\nPage 2\n\nwith Canon Cooper of Cuckfield. Van was to spend the day there yesterday and sleep at Streatham tonight ready to make an early start for Wadebridge? tomorrow morning. Charlie comes to us tomorrow a few days change, and then next week, all being well Mater and I talk of staying in London for a week before the winter sets in. I feel an inclination to go to a few theatres and see what is going on just now on the boards. Did I tell you that Mr Docksee has sent me copies of the plates he took of this house, I think they are splendidly done and I hope the editor of the architectural review will not keep me very long in suspense before publishing them. I hope to send you a copy of the review when they are published in it.\n\nUncle Harold talks now of settling some were in Worcestershire, where he can hire 700 acres of shooting with the house,\n\nPage 3\n\nAlston's regimental quarters in South Africa were burned down in lately h is is servants pluckily managed to save most of his belongings but lost their own. Do you begin to feel fairly at home in the saddle now. I hope the New Zealand horses are not buck jumpers like the Australian. It must require a world of practice to ride such animals.\n\nAdria had 12 presents on her birthday, her dog goes on very satisfactorily and is a pleasant companion out walking, a great contrast to her predecessor.\n\nLove from us all.\n\nYours affectionately,\n\nEdward L. Fenn\n\nAlston Court\n\nNayland\n\nColchester\n\nOctober 25, 1906\n\nMy dear Harold.\n\nI think I told you last week that Charlie spent a few days with us. He was rather tormented with toothache, and in consequence, pain. Dal . . . . . two visits and got rid of some broken stumps and returned home in peace.\n\nVan hopes to begin work at Cuckfield the first Sunday in January, he was favourably impressed with the old vicar Canon Cooper.\n\nPage 2\n\nThe Dido is floating around Ireland, returning to Portsmouth early in December I believe. Cyril was very pleased with the way the Dido's came out in a recent examination on signaling and wireless telegraphy four Dido's being bracketed first. He has a voluntary class in the evening for instruction in fleet manoeuvres, and he says some of the men are very keen on it. He says Bantry Bay is a wretched place, barren rocks onshore, and nearly always blowing and raining at sea.\n\nMater and I begin our London visit, the day after tomorrow and if our purse holds out hope to stay a week. We have not been able to begin our Shakespeare readings yet, as our company is rather scattered. Little John Syrett has just been operated on for appendicitis 10 days ago and is I believe going on well The choral class begins its winter course on November the sixth. Having agreed to become an honourable member of the ancient order of Foresters, Stoke by Nayland Lodge, Dudgeon, Gray,\n\nPage 3\n\nCarruthers?, Wilkinson, and myself are to be ceremoniously admitted at a special Lodge to be held at the White Heart this evening. No branding with the hot poker I hope.\n\nW. B. Spurling is to be Mayor of Colchester next year. He is rather an old sheep, but will do his best I daresay. I can hardly imagine him presiding on the bench or speaking anywhere. Adria's dancing class has been altered to a Friday, which is very inconvenient for me is that it is my Boxford day; on these two accounts I have declined the Oyster feast, which takes place tomorrow (Friday). Mr Haldane is to be the chief guest.\n\nWith love from us all.\n\nYours affectionately,\n\nEdward L. Fenn\n\nThe Howard Hotel\n\nNorfolk Street\n\nVictoria Embankment\n\nNov 2 1906\n\nMy dear Harold.\n\nMater and I thought we required a week in town, where we might refresh ourselves with a few sights and theatres. We have enjoyed some of the latter very much, especially a fine performance of \"A Winter's Tale\" One day, we had Grace and Mabel Todd and Mrs Syrett to luncheon here and took them to see the \"Man from Blankneys\" with Charles Hautrey in the chief role, it was very amusing. We returned after\n\nPage 2\n\nthe matinee to Richmond and dined there to see the old gentleman, who keeps wonderfully well. Yesterday Aunt Isabella and Dolly lunched with us and went to see a musical piece at the Vaudeville. Mrs Syrett is staying in town, at a surgical home, with little John, who has just been successfully operated on for appendicitis. The only drawback to the enjoyment of our visit has been a very rainy atmosphere at intervals, but often the dry season, but after the dry season, we have had this year, the rain is very acceptable.\n\nWe are looking forward to your account of the wedding, I wonder if the Hansells will come down for it. I hope if she does, she will bring her snapshots with her and show these to you. I hear that George Hand and is giving up his curacy at King's Lynn wishing for a change of a Vicar, it only points the moral as we all anticipated, that it was foolish for a young Curate, to take a house and furnish it. At any rate, I should say his father must think so. I hear that Frank Fenn is very happy on his ship in the Mediterranean. Bob wrote the other day, to say he was carrying his arm in a sling, as he had injured the muscles about the shoulder by a heavy fall at football, but it was getting all right again.\n\nPage 3\n\nAdria is learning a kind of hornpipe dance at her class and does the club exercise, she has not knocked any other child on the head yet.\n\nMr Todd was to dine at the Wax Chandlers last night, as it was the anniversary of his jubilee as a member of the Court. He has been on the livery, however, for 63 years.\n\nI hope all is well with you and that you continue happy and interested in your work.\n\nYour affectionate father.\n\nEdward L. Fenn\n\n(Letter written on the Hotel note paper).\n\n41. Edward's Letters 28: To His Son Harry In NZ, Dated 8 Nov 1906, 16 Nov 1906, 22 Nov 1906.\n\nNayland\n\nNovember 8, 1906\n\nMy dear Harold.\n\nYour last two letters have been full of interest, the routine of your own life, and the account of the wedding afforded us a good deal of interesting reading. Your meeting with Mrs Acland was curious, I think she must have been one of the younger girls, as I think, the eldest became a nurse, and joined a sisterhood. You would know her because she would have a slight blue scar line under her lower lip, the result of a\n\nPage 2\n\nfall on to the top bar of the fireplace. You certainly were in luck about your rig out, first that you found some good Samaritan ready to lend and then that all the articles fitted you so well. As we had not been away since last December, when we went to the birthday dinner party, Mater and I have been spending a week in London, and as I think you know we were neither of us very well, and the weather unsettled, so our chief amusement was theatre going, and this we enjoyed very much managing to see seventh plays in six days! Grace Mabel and Mrs Syrett? lunched with us one day and went to a matinee afterwards and Aunt Isabella and Dolly another day. The latter still looks thin and cannot do much\n\nMrs Cooper Van's new vicaress to be is a sister of Mrs Buckley-Paget whom I think you have met when they were staying at Gt Horksley rectory. The world is not such a very big place, after all, as you have already experienced. I quite agree with you that as soon as you have regained sufficient experience it will be well to make a start on a small scale on your account if you can find a steady hard-working man like Hobbs to join you. I am sure the Elworthy's would do their best to advise you.\n\nPage 3\n\nI sincerely hope the new secretary will turn out to be of a pleasant and hospitable disposition, and show a disposition to help him that he may be drawn to you. The temper of his wife is of almost more importance!\n\nMiss Proctor passed away last week, at the age of 86. Miss Mary will now be moving into a small house, Poor \"Gilly\" has had an asthmatic bronchial attack, which he does not shake off and talks of coming home for a time to try to get rid of his cough.\n\nWith love from us all\n\nYours affectionately,\n\nEdward L. Fenn\n\nNayland.\n\nNovember 16, 1906\n\nMy dear Harold.\n\nMany members of the family will probably be sending you their Christmas good wishes by this mail, so I too must send you every good wish of the season for your health and happiness. I believe helped by your zeal and steadiness there is every prospect that you will in time carve out of yourself\n\nPage 2\n\na happy and successful career in the young country of your adoption. Communication between us, by letter is after all a very satisfactory means of keeping in touch with one another, for personally, how little we see of each other, who are working in the same country. I see Van or Cyril once, or maybe twice in the year. So I feel that you are not much further removed from us than the rest. I am sure at home in the present day, young men think a great deal too much about sports athletics and having a good time. Whereas in the colony you have to think and apply yourselves a good deal more to work, which brings to you, a much more lasting and satisfactory kind of happiness when the stress of work is over and you can enjoy some leisure. I feel with you a great deal depends on Mr Elworthy's choice of a new secretary as to your personal comfort. I particularly hope he may have a\n\nPage 3\n\nnice minded lady for a wife, who will be willing to welcome you to her house as a friend when she gets to know you.\n\nI am sending your wedding letter round to the brothers and shall be always ready to do so as I can quite understand you feel to fatigued at the end of your day to write much. Aunt Ada was much interested in seeing it and your photographs. They have just moved from Harrogate, finally, I have no doubt, and gone into lodging at Brighton for a couple of months (47 Devonshire Place) where they can meditate upon their future plans. Uncle Henry seems to be much better.\n\nA hot Christmas must seem rather unnatural to you brought up as you were on Dicken's descriptions and pictures\n\nYour affectionate father.\n\nEdward L. Fenn.\n\nNayland\n\nNovember 22, 1906\n\nMy dear Harold.\n\nMy paper looks as if I contemplated along letter, whereas I am writing on this paper, which I do not like because my stock has run out. It seems curious to think of you enjoying? a hot Christmas, with sunshine and roses. It cannot seem quite like Christmas to you, I should think. We now wish you however a happy New Year and I hope it will be a prosperous one to. Edgar went\n\nPage 2\n\nback to Oxford, three days ago, and looking much better and with very little cough left. I think his exam begins on Monday week he does not seem at all nervous as to the result. I think he works pretty steadily Bob had his shoulder examined with the Rontegen rays. The injury was found of no import the bruising of the shoulder muscles seemed to be the cause of the partial movement.\n\nThe Wentworth house dinner party is fixed for December the 18th. It will be as crowded as ever, I am afraid for the . . . . . . . . be waylaid on the way from school and . . . . to the dinner. Did I tell you, the Rouths are going to lease Wandsworth in the spring and go further into the country a place at Wendover in Bucks. Uncle Hanover has also taken over a house with shooting about 2 miles from Kidderminster. Your letter and card (Timaru) of the 10th has just arrived. It looks a nice clean town. I am sorry you were not able to go in for the service when uncle Churchill.\n\nPage 3\n\npreached but duty stands first of course. I was most sad about the new secretarial arrangements, but one never knows what good may perchance come of it like you go up to the Homestead. Do you ever get a chance at the . . . . . well all these pleasures will come again to you by and by I have no doubt.\n\nMrs Marshal shook her shook her head the other day when I met her about Bertie's prospects - poor she thought.\n\nWith much love from all at home.\n\nYour affectionate father.\n\nEdward L Fenn\n\n42. Edward's Letters 29: To His Son Harry In NZ, Dated 29 Nov 1906, 6 Dec 1906, 20 Dec 1906.\n\nNayland,\n\nNovember 29, 1906\n\nMy dear Harold,\n\nThe week seems to come round very quickly, without bringing any news to send on to you and I daresay to one so busily employed as you fortunately, as they flying still quicker. A rumour reached me recently that your cousin, Bertha was engaged to one of the younger Elworthy's and I am wondering if we shall have as confirmed by you, perhaps it is your clothier?.\n\nEdgar, has had no more trouble with his cough since he returned to Oxford, and he\n\nPage 2\n\nis I believe sitting for the first part of his final this week. Did you hear that Bob is to be present at the birthday dinner party this year, which has been fixed for Wednesday the 18th. the dinner that he returns from Broadstairs. He is rather young to begin such festivities, and I only hope he will not be too much upset the next day for us to travel home.\n\nOld Miss Stopford was found dead in her bed last week. She was 86, but looked years younger, being always so upright with a fresh complexion. I expect you remember her for she is sat at one in of your pew in the parish church.\n\nI am glad that this change of secretary into foreman and clerk is taking place in the summer as you will have time to look about and see how you can accommodate yourself to the new arrangement. Keep your head up, however, and do not drop into a lower circle. After all, your present life is not likely to continue very long as you will, I hope soon acquire sufficient experience to venture onto a farm of your own with a good partner to assist. I don't know much about Charlie's\n\nPage 3\n\nprogress at Streatham, but I hope and believe he is getting on as well as we can expect. It takes a long time to build up a practice, and he has hampered himself for some years to come up with periodic payments of purchase money. At present I think the sailor is the best off as he knows exactly what his monthly payments will be, and there can be no happiness if he does not live within his income.\n\nGood bye\n\nYour affectionate father.\n\nEdward L Fenn\n\nAlston Court.\n\nNayland\n\nDecember 6, 1906\n\nMy dear Harold\n\nBy the time you receive this Christmas (your first hot Christmas) will be passed and the New Year at hand so I wish you with all my heart a very happy and successful New Year. Life after all is so short that it does not much matter where we live, if only we can find work congenial to our tastes, and with a fair prospect of offering us a profitable career. Edgar\n\nPage 2\n\ncomes down tomorrow for the Christmas vacation. He was passed in the first half of his finals, taking up the other half in June of next year when he will be qualified for a BA. But then comes the rub, what next?\n\nI heard this morning that uncle Billy has some serious mischief internally, which will necessitate an immediate operation. He has been looking so very well lately that I am inclined to think there has been some exaggeration as to its impact, but we shall know more about it in the day or two. They are of course very much upset and highly anxious about it at Bridge house.\n\nTell us a little more about the three Elworthy brothers when you write, their characters and temperament, are they all doing well, like your \"Boss\" is Ella nice to deal with. I hear that Edward Hopkins is hopeful about his business in Toronto, though I cannot explain it - he seems as he seems to be an agent for the importation of English goods into Canada, it sounds rather a big order, but I dare say, means very little.\n\nLouie Howard was married in the same church at Calcutta, that she was baptised in, her husband, Mr Ede is a tea planter in Assam I believe. Miss Louise Round told me yesterday, when I met her in the street that Mr Brown missed me very much and that she hoped I was going back again\n\nPage 3\n\nand did I know they had the nuns there now? so you see, she is very much as you left her.\n\nI think uncle Harold and wife and Olive are going to Monte Carlo or some neighbouring resort for the Christmastide. I suppose he will retire altogether from the Army in February next and settled down as a country gentleman, near Kidderminster for shooting and motor car-ing.\n\nWith our united love.\n\nYour affectionate father.\n\nEdward L. Fenn\n\nAlston Court.\n\nNayland\n\nDecember 20, 1906\n\nMy dear Harry (Harold).\n\nLong ere you will receive these few lines Christmas will have come and gone. We shall all think of you on Tuesday and drink your good health. Wishing you every prosperity in your adopted home, like everything it will require patience and perseverance, and I hope you will not be disheartened by present disagreeables. I presumely (sic) you're not\n\nPage 2\n\nsaying anything to the contrary, that you are the only gentleman pupil on the run.\n\nMater, and I returned from our annual Richmond visit last evening. Mr Todd was very happy and well, looking more like a man of 70 and one of 88. The Hooper's and Dolton's were guests as usual. A wet to fog or Scotch mist reigned supreme most of the time we were there, so we could not get about very much.\n\nUncle Billy has had some sharp attack of obstruction inside but he was better when I saw him, though he was looking thin, and I think there is reason to fear a repetition of his troubles. Charlie had supper on Sunday evening at Wentworth house he was looking well, but confessed it was slow disappointing work building up a practice, but I told him we all have had the same experience. Van and Cyril hope to stay a few days with us early in the New Year. Miss Johnson, left us this morning for the Christmas\n\nPage 3\n\nholidays. So Adria now has leisure to follow Beau about like a shadow Aunt Margaret has happy letters from Frank on the Mediterranean station, he seems to have taken quite kindly to the sea, I am thankful to say. Bob has brought back his class prize for classics, I am pleased to say, he has also done better in mathematics than he has done in previous terms.\n\nGod bless you my dear boy in the coming year.\n\nBelieve me always.\n\nYour affectionate father.\n\nEdward L. Fenn\n\n43. Edward's Letters 30: To His Son Harry In NZ, Dated 3 Jan 1907, 17 Jan 1907, 24 Jan 1907.\n\nAlston Court\n\nNayland\n\nJanuary 3, 1907\n\nMy dear Harold,\n\nWe were very pleased and surprised to receive your Christmas greeting on Christmas morning. It was very remarkable that it could be so well hit off from the other side of the world. Your photograph was an excellent one, you look fatter in the face than when you left England, and certainly you seem to have enjoyed good health in New Zealand, barring, the\n\nPage 2\n\none attack of asthma on your arrival in Timaru, or rather I should say Pareora. Cyril has got three weeks leave after rejoining. We shall in all probability not see much of him for two years as after their cruise on the Spanish coast in February or March, then the payoff, and at once recommission probably for East India or China Station.\n\nHe and Charlie are going this evening to the winter dance at the Masonic Hall. I am surprised at Charlie's taking the trouble to come from Streatham for the one night, I hope there is no attraction in that quarter. We expect Van this evening for a week's visit, before taking up his new work in Cuckfield. Our friends all tell us that it is a charming spot, and the church, one of the finest in Sussex, I wish the rector was not so old but I hope Van will be able to stay on there some years. Cyril brought a little fox terrier back with him. Jenie has given him a very friendly welcome and they tear about together. We had a very heavy fall of snow on Boxing Day, and this morning. the floods are rising rapidly our further meadow is covered to a large extent with water and Beau\n\nPage 3\n\nis giving his boat a sail on the wide expanse.\n\nThe two children with Edgar's assistance, composed and acted a play on Christmas night entitled, \"The last of the Highwaymen\" It was carried through with great spirit. Uncle Billy has been very unwell with some internal stoppage, but I hear he has weathered the storm this time, but I fear of further trouble by and by\n\nWith much love from us all,\n\nYour affectionate father,\n\nEdward L Fenn\n\nAlston Court,\n\nNayland\n\nJanuary 17, 1907\n\nMy Dear Harold,\n\nIt was a relief to hear that you were to have all your meals in the cottage, instead of the cook-shop, as it sounds quite a decent and comfortable arrangement for you.\n\nI daresay you are not sorry that the very busy shearing time is over, for it must have been a prolonged strain for the workers and an anxious time for the scorer. I am glad you saw George Julius, when he was\n\nPage 2\n\nover. I don't suppose you have seen him since he was in shirt and knickers. The day after I had your letter about him and his voting machine, I saw the enclosed account of a similar invention of a voting machine by a Signor Boggiano, was it one of those curious coincidences re matters of invention or did Boggiano hear of Georges invention to patent such a machine: I expect it was just a coincidence, but nevertheless very annoying for George and his company, because Boggiano may have anticipated their patents rights in Europe.\n\nWe went to some family theatricals at Little Horksley School, two days since, a W. Brodie, who acted there two years ago was splendid as the cabman as found in a . . . . . . W. Wilkinson is getting up some at Stoke from Shrove Tuesday. Last night, our servants had their party. They numbered about 20 and our young people acted a character to amuse them . . . . . . . the first scene was an excerpt from Box and Cox, Box (Edgar)\n\nPage 3\n\nCox (Bob), Miss Vinder Vox (Adria) was a character added that for Adria's sake, Miss Osmham (maid), Mrs Bouncer (girl) The next scene, had a burglar entering the servant, Miss Denham's room and stealing plated etc, two old ladies were represented by Cyril and Edgar and the last scene was a quack doctor, his patients - they all did well, but Cyril was the life of the whole affair. The servants and their friends were immensely amused, our Christmas gaieties are over now, and schoolwork begins again on Tuesday.\n\nThis painful scrawl is owing to my intense desire to go to sleep. I have fallen off several times whilst trying to write what I have done.\n\nYours affectionately,\n\nEdward L Fenn\n\nAlston Court.\n\nNayland\n\nJanuary 24, 1907\n\nMy dear Harold.\n\nBob returned to his school two days ago, and Cyril leaves us today, spending two nights with Charlie before rejoining the Dido, and this exodus makes us feel that the Christmas holidays are over and that we are now fall back once more into our quiet routine country life. I think you heard of our children's party magic lantern and visit of Mother Goose with presents. Since then our servants had there's, they mustered 20 all told. Our young people with Miss Denholm's help acted a charade in three scenes. The first was\n\nPage 2\n\ntaken from Box and Cox, the second was a burglar piece, Cyril and Edgar were two old ladies, Adria, the next-door neighbour got up wonderfully in coat and artificial nose, and Bob the burglar: Cyril was particularly good at a timid old lady: the third scene was a quack doctor, (Cyril) and his patients, whom he professed to cure of their rheumatic afflictions by means of mesmerism, but he mixed them up and got them all wrong and there was a general rumpus. The word was rheu-matic (room-attic) true to the ear, but quite modern phonetic spelling. I thought they all acted with great spirit. I was Captain Drawer. We went recently to Little Horksley for a matinee theatricals set up by the Alten-Barry's is in aid of their coal club, their friends in the neighbourhood rallied round well and they sold 70 half crown tickets, they also gave two cheap evening performances.\n\nLast night, we had a Shakespeare reading at Mrs Dudgeon's the play being Taming the Shrew. Mr Gray, taking Petruchio and Mrs Dudgeon, Catherine. We are enjoying (?) just now, a second cold snap with a piercing north-east wind. It is this latter, which makes the cold so penetrating, wrap up as you\n\nPage 3\n\nmay, but I do not suppose it will last long. I have not sent you any paper, because Van told me that he had arranged for your having the Daily Mail, I believe for a year, if you wish for anything else, I shall be pleased however to arrange for its transmission.\n\nI wish you would tell me about what you would like me to give you for your birthday, you have so little room, I imagine, that a hint would be very acceptable.\n\nUncle Billy is I believe better, but I have not heard very much of him since Christmas. Uncle Henry and aunt Ada remain at Brighton, until spring at any rate, I expect.\n\nI hope you're keeping well and that you continue to be interested in your work, getting, I hope, a grasp of the ins and outs of sheep farming.\n\nLove from all.\n\nYour affectionate father.\n\nEdward L. Fenn\n\n44. Edward's Letters 31: To His Son Harry In NZ, Dated 4 Mar 1907, 14 Mar 1907, 4 Apr 1907.\n\nAlston Court\n\nNayland\n\nMarch 4, 1907\n\nMy dear Harold.\n\nI am too late for your birthday I am sorry to think but the intention is the same viz to wish you very many happy returns of the anniversary and may you in the course of time build up a happy and prosperous family in your new country. Miss Torlesse writing to me the other day and asked me to tell you how pleased she was to hear such good accounts of you and that you were well. I'm getting on, by degrees, I am thankful to say, feel very well in myself and can walk about fairly well. My speech however is still spluttering and difficult\n\nPage 2\n\nand eating and drinking are not easy, but I must have patience and am very thankful that I am as well as I am. Do you ever get into Christchurch, I suppose it is beyond a bicycle ride. Your letters are a great pleasure to me. Jack Bateman has given up trying to pass the Edinburgh exams and he is doing locum-tenens work which is very good for him he would never have been happy or successful at Richmond so it is much better for him. Guy is married he was in hospital in Toronto and fell in love with his nurse and she foolishly accepted him. If she is a sensible person it may be a very good thing for Guy to have someone to look after him and keep him straight. Charlie has been getting some patients of his own lately, which has greatly pleased him. I am hoping to see Cyril shortly as he is back in Chatham (from Portugal), he sent a wireless message . . . . . to . . . . . Isle of Wight to say he was coming up channel. Van paid his bishop, a visit at Chichester last week he was in to great a hurry to please Van by the brevity of the visit enabled Van to run up to up to . . . . . Place at Brighton between the incoming and out going trains and see Uncle Henry and Aunt Ada. Uncle Henry has not been so well the last month, I am afraid both he and Mr Bateman suffer a good deal.\n\nPage 3\n\nWe are rejoicing in the first appearance of spring flowers. I am sitting in my dressing room today for the first time it makes a pleasant change from bed room during the day hours.\n\nWith our united love and good wishes for your health and happiness.\n\nYour affectionate father\n\nEdward L. Fenn\n\nNayland\n\nMarch 14, 1907\n\nMy dear Harold.\n\nYou're very welcome bundle of letters arrived yesterday. So glad to hear that you are able to share and stand the hard work of the harvest field. All previous personal experience of farming operations will be of service hereafter, when you have your own hands to direct. I am getting on slowly, but to the doctor's satisfaction, as a matter of fact a stroke like mine leaves you very different to what it found you. The articulation of my words is thick and not ready, but my mind is clear and I am not paralysed in arm or leg. So I have much to be thankful for, but to what extent I am going to recover is I think very doubtful. I heard two days ago of the not unexpected death of Mr Bateman. He had a malignant growth near the bowel, which\n\nPage 2\n\nobstructed all passage through it; they operated at first they thought successfully, but two days later, his strength collapsed and he passed away in a few hours. Poor Aunt Annie is nearly heartbroken; they were devoted to one another; but it was a merciful release for him from a life of her helpless suffering. When you write again explain the mystery of your postscript we cannot imagine who Louisa is who has an anecdote to tell about her father; stockings.(sic)\n\nEdgar goes to Wentworth House tomorrow for a fortnight, so he will just be in time to see the boat race. It promises to be a good race, though the Cantab's are rather the favourites; one of Dr Burns sons is rowing in their boat. Van hopes to come and see me in a few days after Easter and Cyril was here last week calling on his way to join the Vernon at Portsmouth where he has gone for a course in wireless telegraphy. I am glad to see my son's in turn when they can come for my time may be very short. Whether you and I will meet again in this world God only knows, nor does it much matter so long as you live soberly and uprightly following in the steps of your saintly mother for a life so spent is the only thing that brings a man happiness at the last.\n\nGoodbye, and God bless you dear boy in the daily prayers of your affectionate father.\n\nEdward L Fenn\n\nNayland\n\nApril 4, 1907\n\nMy dear Harold.\n\nWe received a capital letter and illustrated sheet from you last week. Uncle Churchill must have had the sun full in his face for him to make such faces as he was doing. Bishop Wilson was good but he seems to be ageing in appearance, the effect no doubt of climate and anxiety.\n\nWith the exception of an attack of giddiness and convulsive tremors in the left arm ten days ago I have gone on steadily improving but Syrett is very nervous about giving me leave to do anything in the way of exertion, but I hope to get more rope given me by degrees. I go out in a bath-chair now, the Dudgeons have lent me a very nice one that belonged to Lady Dalhousie.\n\nVan has been here for three days. He is much\n\nPage 2\n\nmore under vicarial discipline than he was at St Miniva. This is a good thing to him I am sure for a beginner St Miniver ways were to easy-going. Edgar and Bob come home tomorrow, and Grace Todd came down with them. This is Edgar's last term, and what to do for him when he gets his B.A. I don't know. Charlie was going to Richmond last evening to take Willy to a dance organised by old Mrs Ball for her nephew and nieces very spirited for an old lady of 80. Mr and Mrs Gray are just off to Westgate for a fortnight, and the Dudgeons are going to Seton South Devon, Billy has been sleepless and nervous lately owing to the excitement of our parish council elections. Has Bertha given Percy leave to go and hunt in Africa? Corbert goes to his new living at Wanstead next week I believe, he and his family have had various presents given by friends and parishioners are library table, a brooch, a purse with 105 pounds seven shillings etc. The Ma . . . . . are having electric light installation laid in at Westwood, with engine and dynamos, water pumping apparatus and exotic bathroom. They have not been able to let our dell(?) as yet.\n\nI hope to sell my horse and carriage before long for now that I cannot drive myself in the dogcart there is no pleasure in keeping my own. I can hire a variety of close carriages when we require them at much less cost than keeping a man 2 horses of our own. I am only anxious for Megg's future, situations in or near Nayland are scarce. I was very glad to hear that your asthma did not hang about you badly for long this time and I hope you have been able to manage the dipping operations\n\nPage 3\n\nwithout any great fatigue or distress of breathing. Cyril got his certificate all right at the end of his short 3 weeks course A most disastrous one for him as he has two watches, his purse with three pounds in it and sundry details in the way of gloves, tobacco etc, stolen out of his cabin whilst on board - at the same time as you lost your watch and glasses.\n\nGoodbye with love from as all.\n\nYour affectionate father.\n\nEdward L. Fenn\n\n45. Edward's Letters 32: To His Son Harry In NZ, Dated 11 Apr 1907, 18 Apr 1907, 1 May 1907.\n\nAlston Court.\n\nNayland\n\nColchester\n\nApril 11, 1907\n\nMy dear Harry or Harold (old habits die hard)\n\nI hope the dipping has gone on successfully, I suspect it was better for you than the dusty harvesting, and it was a new experience to. I am going on very well until a week ago, when I had a sudden shaking spasmodic attack of the left side, which has weakened me a bit but I am picking up again. Dr Ferrier has kindly promised to come down one day next week and overhaul me.\n\nI trust you have had some good rains before now, New Zealand and Australian droughts are terrible scourges and must bring ruin to thousands when they come round. Grace is staying here for 10 days and Aunt Isabella and Dolly are in\n\nPage 2\n\nlodgings at Gowings for a week or so. They are going on then to Cuckfield for a short visit, if Van can get them lodgings. Edgar made a long visit to Wentworth house before he came home, it gave him a nice opportunity of seeing his relations in that neighbourhood. Aunt Annie is trying to dispose of the last six years of her lease of Bridge house. She tells me she has had a nice letter from Guy and his wife in Toronto they must pay a surgery assistant at the hospital there much better than they would in England, or Guy could never support a wife on his pay. Dr Syrett has gone for a weeks holiday into South Devon with the Dudgeons. Cyril has had no tidings of his watch's so it must be regarded as a dead loss doubtless. Ask Uncle Churchill to chose you one when you decide to replace yours. I expect your visits to Christchurch are few and far between. I hope Ella and boy are doing well.\n\nI am sending off a box today containing a pair of pince-nez for you. I have not opened it, but possibly there may be both distance and reading glasses as I was not sure what kind you wanted, and cannot remember when I ordered. If it is not right you must let me know after you have examined them. Charlie tells us he is going to a Shakespearean, fancy dress ball, his character to be Sir Walter Raleigh in green velvet trunk hose, feathers and jewel velvet cap. All very smart evidently.\n\nI see my writing is getting very shaky so think I had better give over as they do not like me to tire myself writing letters etc.\n\nWith much love from us all\n\nYour affectionate father\n\nEdward L. Fenn\n\nAlston Court.\n\nNayland\n\nApril 18, 1907\n\nMy dear Harold.\n\nI hope you're going on well now, no asthma and unpleasant sheep washing experiences. I am going on quietly in the right direction I believe, though I am kept in rather a state of uncertainty by having experienced one or two slighter fits of an epileptic form character, my speech, the muscles of the left side of my face and my left arm all being affected. Dr Ferrier, kindly came down last Saturday to see me and gave me a hopeful prognosis, but good as this is I feel it is all very uncertain and that no one can be very sure of his opinion.\n\nAunt Isabella and Dolly are staying at Gowing's lodgings for a week or two. I enjoy my chats with Aunt Isabella.\n\nPage 2\n\nI am glad to hear that Aunt Annie has got rid of Bridge House, the club next door, having taken it and she has taken a house called the Retreat down Friars Lane, where Chancellor used to live, there is a convenient walled garden, where Dolly can keep her chickens, and the girls will not annoy their neighbours with their musical practices.\n\nCyril has been rather troubled with sciatica in both legs at the same time, which has been rather bad for him. He went to Wentworth House for five days and seen all the better for the change, he will be very glad when they leave Sheerness. My mind is much exercised about Edgar's future. I think house of business . . . . . suit him, if I could hear of any clerkship, I suppose Mr Elworthy does not want a bookkeeper or trustworthy clerk. I should think he could soon be trained but not being able to ride would be a serious drawback. I must try to get him something in the city I suppose, or as a junior master in a preparatory school perhaps.\n\nDr Syrett has just bought a new and more powerful motor car; he and Mr Wilkinson went to Coventry for it and brought it home, via Rugby, Northampton, Bedford, Cambridge, and Haverhill about 2 miles the side of Haverhill it suddenly stopped dead, no petrol - their tank had not been properly filled before starting fortunately, a bicyclist came up who road back to Haverhill and had some oil sent out, but it was un-pleasant sitting in the on the hedge side in the pitch dark on a cold night he was very glad of the companionship of Mr Wilkinson. Have you had any tidings of your lost watch or field glasses.\n\nPage 3\n\nCyril has heard nothing of his watch and watches, even Edgar has joined the band of losers, I sent him up P.O. 15/- to Wentworth house a fortnight since, he never received it and the order was cashed by someone who must have abstracted it.\n\nNayland is quite a deserted village just now, the Dudgeons at Seaton in South Devon, and the Gray's at Westgate. Edward Hopkins has dissolved partnership with his man, and is again seeking a post. Rees has gone to Scarborough upon what sounds like a wild goose chase. Those boys pick up with any plausible traveller they may meet and get taken in of course. It is a good thing to believe in yourself but you must be as cautious as the serpent in your dealings with strangers.\n\nWith much love from us all.\n\nYour affectionate father.\n\nEdward L. Fenn.\n\nUncle Harold, Aunt Bertha and Olive have gone down to their new house at Wolverley near Kidderminster.\n\nAlston court.\n\nNayland\n\nMay 1, 1907\n\nMy dear Harold,\n\nYour letter and photo of 6000 sheep in the . . . . reached us a few days ago. I was most interested in your account of the sheep dipping procedure. Am thankful to hear that you are keeping well I hope you will have a good time at Christchurch and see (sic) the exhibition will be a nice change for you and one you will deserve after your recent labours.\n\nEdward Hopkins is home again, bothering everybody to get him into a berth. I think Canada was too hard for him. He had not gone through your in engineering mechanics training which, although it was very hard for you at the time has been of great value to you in your present labourers employment. It will all turn up trumps to you by and by.\n\nPage 2\n\nAunt Isabella and Dolly have been at Gowing's Lodgings for the last month and Grace has been staying here so we have had quite a nice gathering during the Easter holidays. Now Miss Johnson has returned and Bob goes back at the end of the week\n\nI continue to gain strength in my left side but my head soon gets confused if I have business matters to attend to like the Stoke and Melford club accounts. I can walk four or five times round the garden without much fatigue, and for greater distances I go in my bath chair.\n\nI am very sorry that you are so cut off from church privileges but at any rate keep yourself well in hand until you are more fortunately situated. It is such a comfort in middle life to look back and feel that you had an upright, cleanly life in your younger years. There is nothing that brings you more satisfaction and peace of mind, than the recollections of that as years advance.\n\nI was very grieved to hear that Percy Elworthy's engagement to Bertha has been broken off. How was it. Had they not seen enough of each other beforehand, so as to have proper opportunities to knowing each other's peculiarities. It is a most unfortunate time for the girls to be coming to England. Uncle Arthur has let his house was three months Aunt Ann . . . . is about to change her house and besides she has no heart for gaiety just now. I am not able to entertain anybody and Uncle Henry is too unwell to be depended upon and has no house as they are living in lodgings at Richmond or Brighton at present. Everybody will be very disappointed as the New Zealand rail and relate relatives are always warmly welcomed and their visits much appreciated.\n\nThis letter was unsigned\n\n46. Edward's Letters 33: To His Son Harry In NZ, Dated 7 May 1907, 23 May 1907.\n\nNayland\n\nWednesday,\n\nMay 7, 1907\n\nMy dear Harry.\n\nI think I may rightly report that the last week has been one of slight improvement in my walking, though I still require a balancing arm on one side with my stick on the other. I suppose Ada and Bertha will be due in about 10 days or a fortnight I wish the families over here were better able to entertain them but as you know, we are all in rather an unusual unsettled state just now in trouble or moving house etc.\n\nAunt Annie has not been able to let Bridge house, yet, nor hear of a cheaper one that would suit her and her family. Aunt Isabella left the yesterday she has been staying in the village six weeks, I have seen more of her than I have done since her return from India. I have much enjoyed my chats with her reliving\n\nPage 2\n\nold memories with her. I heard Eden Everett yesterday about your glasses, and he says that I ordered two pairs a month ago to be sent to you. I am quite puzzled, I hope I shall shortly hear from you that you have received them and then it will be all right. I don't want to send them to you twice. I get very confused often now about matters of business and waiting for an answer from New Zealand is a long business.\n\nA picture of some of you on the \"Tongariro\" taken from the tender at Tilbury, puzzled me at first, and I thought you were the young man you were the young (sic) leaning on his elbow, whispering into the. . . . . man's ear. I was glad afterwards, to discover you more for on the right-hand of Miss B. The first man had to cunning a smile but was really absurdly like you. I'm . . . . your . . . . . one best.\n\nAunt Annie, has not got Bridge House of her hands yet which is rather a worry, nor has she found a cheaper one large enough for herself and family. Charlie says that Jack has grown a beard and looks ruffian in consequence. Cyril is off shortly for a tour around about Norway. Bob has had rather a shock being told by Mr Sinclair in Ipswich that he must wear spectacles continuously, except at hockey when it is considered dangerous so Cyril will be the only were the only glassless one amongst you, and it is lucky for him in his profession.\n\nPage 3\n\nThe Routhes go to their new home at Wendover in Bucks this week, and Uncle Harold is supposed to have got into his new house Wolverly Kidderminster about fortnight ago, though I am afraid it is far from being ready for them. He has . . . . . . . a Humber motorcar, which is very useful in the country.\n\nHas Ella ever said anything to you about Bertha it must be most uncomfortable for her. I gathered from you that he seems such a good sort, how came he not to know his own mind better. I am very sorry about it. Is Bertha very different to her sweet . . . . . . . sisters, if not Percy has lost a good thing and wife.\n\nGoodbye and God bless you, dear boy.\n\nYour affectionate father's.\n\nEdward L. Fenn\n\nNayland\n\nMay 23, 1907\n\nMy dear Harold.\n\nI was very pleased to get your letter written from Christchurch, I think at the end of your holiday, it was fortunate you had George for a companion and Uncle Churchill was up in the mountains. The exhibition must have been very enjoyable.\n\nAlthough you have the . . . . . . . winter weather before you it is not your first taste of it so you know what to expect and can provide clothing according to your needs. I hope \"Bob\" will turn out well, it is good idea to make her train some young ones for you and it will pay you well I should think even if hereafter it you did not keep them all. Charlie has gone in a parrot, supposed to be a talker. I suppose we ought to get some news of the travellers soon.\n\nPage 2\n\nI have not much to tell you about myself, improving I think I may say, but soon tired especially with business accounts. I am getting free however of all my trust matters as quickly as I can I cannot trust myself with the accounts now and the correspondence worries me. I shall hope to go about and see my friends more when the dentist has fitted me with a new plate as I am at present plateless which makes me talk worse than I need otherwise do.\n\nI spend an hour in the garden in the afternoon, if it be warm enough. My dressing is slow in the morning, Mr Gowing comes to wash and dress me every morning as I require a good deal of assistance in these operations.\n\nI am sending you a copy of the architectural review with an illustrated account of Alston Court. They may might have made a better selection of plates, especially I should have liked to have seen the library or drawing room instead of southeast corner of the courtyard as we already have one of east side and one of the north-east corner of west. But what is most tiresome is that they evidently did not know what a treasure they had of this old house, for they only printed the usual few, they sell\n\nPage 3\n\nto the trade and the issue was sold out on the third day. I have had great difficulty in acquiring copies, even now (sic) have not got nearly enough for my wants - I wanted to give away a good number to my friends and relations and say there stupidity is very vexatious.\n\nWe are in the midst of spring cleaning, and I have had a line from Cyril to say he has been put on half pay for a time for the economy and it is most trying to him, and poor economy when he was so busy with his wireless telegraphy. Everything is going to the dogs under our present government. Rumours are again flying about that Gray is going to retire, Mrs G. worries him and he is much more desirous of going on with his work as long as he can. I am anxious because I enjoy his sermon and general teaching and we might very easily get someone like Walls of Boxted or Rawlinson of Wiston, etc. Like you I enjoy a good service and sermon at the church I am glad you heard uncle C (\"him\"deleted) preach on Easter day,\n\nPage 4\n\nI think there is a better prospect of business it seems in New Zealand than in England. I don't think the old country made a good impression upon the Colonials and old Botha managed to go of with his pockets for the money a loan of 5 million I believe guaranteed by we poor folk at home. Mr Taylor, Mater's uncle Frank was buried yesterday at Blackheath. He was Mrs Todd's only brother.\n\nEver your affectionate father.\n\nEdward L. Fenn.\n\n47. Edward's Letters 34: To His Son Harry in NZ, Dated 28 May 1907, 6 Jun 1907, 20 Jun 1907.\n\nAlston Court.\n\nNayland\n\nMay 28th 1907\n\nMy dear Harold,\n\nYou're number of the architectural review, ought to go off tomorrow. I believe by parcel post. It has been very annoying, only being able to get such a few copies. I call it a pretty . . . . . concern, not accustomed to deal with such an interesting gem as Alston court and so they only published their usual numbers for the trade. We are expecting to hear from Ada or Bertha tomorrow as to their engagements, and when they would like to come to us with so many of their relatives unable to receive them just now I am afraid it will not be easy\n\nPage 2\n\nfor them to make out a nice list of hostess to last them on until January. Aunt Ada, who saw them last week told me that they were two very nice girls, and that Bertha did not wear the air of a bitter young lady. I hope you are keeping well and fit for plenty of hard work in the coming winter. We were rather astonished a day or two ago, to hear from Cyril that he had been discharged on half pay a stupid administrative muddle for he was busy with large classes he was instructing in signaling and wireless telegraphy . . . . . on the fourth day . . . . . the Admirals head got clearer (?) and he was appointed to the Warrior Channel Fleet, and much bigger ship than the Widow. Mrs Dudgeon has immediately pounced on him for summer theatricals and . . . . . his part very willingly - but now Cyril will . . . . . service and they must get on as well as they can. Charlie is coming down to help to their great delight unless he cant find a substitute . . . . . try his hand.\n\nJessie had a litter of six puppies yesterday, great excitement on Adria's part, but I do not suppose many will survive long. I want to put down my stable as now that I cannot drive the dogcart myself I see no pleasure in keeping my own horse, merely to be driven occasionally with brougham and . . . . . hired out . . . . . serve just as well at much less cost.\n\nKeep a supply of postcards by you so that when you dont feel inclined to write you may send me a few lines on a card. I like to hear from you pretty often, I am going on a very, well, I think but soon get tired especially by figures or calculations. I hope to field more like myself when . . . . . has fitted me up comfortably with what T M Clark . . . . . euphemistically to call \"dentures\" I am very glad to hear\n\nPage 3\n\nthat Aunt Annie has got rid of Bridge house, to a . . . . . . . . . . I think to open Terrace Gardens there, and she is hoping to secure a good house in the Avenue . . . . . . . . . . near the railway bridge and close to the landing place of two Ferry boats. I think by crossing the river she gets a larger and better hose for her money than she could do in Richmond and they want a fair sized garden for Winnies chickens and plenty of bedrooms, probably Mrs H. . . . . the patient will stay with them if they have a house with a sufficient number of rooms.\n\nWishing you every happiness and success in your career (in which you must steadily persevere\n\nBelieve me\n\nYr affectionate father\n\nEdward L Fenn\n\nAlston Court.\n\nNayland\n\nJune 6, 1907\n\nMy dear Harold.\n\nI hope you're not finding any bad affect left behind by your hunting cropper, wire mixed with fencing is not fair and very dangerous for the riders.\n\nBessie Julius saw the girls the other day and they astonished her by telling her they were going to commence a three months training course of nursing at St Bartholomew's on Aug 1 and they hope to come to her when this was over. So I am afraid the dull month of November will have began by the time they can reach us. I know Ada has been thinking of going through such a course for a long time past, and I suppose Bertha's broken heart has driven her with the same service. I don't much like the work for young girls, but it is the fashion nowadays.\n\nPage 2\n\nAunt Annie Hand came to us yesterday for a few days, she arrived quite exhausted after spending six hours in the train. She had been paying a visit to Lyme churchyard. Would you care to have the Essex Standard sent on to you sometimes when I should remember it. I don't think foreign newspapers publish(?) too much.\n\nThe young folk here are working hard at their parts and holding frequent rehearsals, here or at the Dudgeons, 3 plays \"A Voyage Benoit\", \"Poor Pillicuddy\" and \"Miss Flipper's Holiday\". Actors; Mr Wilkinson, Mr Williams, Dr Syrett, Charlie, Miss Gray, Miss Denholm, Miss Gresham, Miss Williams, Miss Johnson.\n\nThe Bishop of Colchester commemoration of his golden wedding day he had a golden challis and paten presented to him by the clergy of the diocese and a golden goblet and cover by the city of Chelmsford, and parishioners of St Mary's.\n\nI am thankful to say I still progress slowly on the way to recovery, but my mouth both for speaking and eating hangs fire. I have not found your Mr Agne very successful in fitting me out with a new plate. In reply to a little wedding present we see sent Phoebe Storr, she mentioned a George Adams and says they are all so fond of him than they are lost to imagine how they managed to get along without him before. They have changed his name to Brownie now.\n\nCyril likes his new appointment to the \"Warrior\" very well I think, he has Chatham again for headquarters. He will miss his uncle Harold, now, however, they are not yet settled in their new house, nor has he got a chauffeur yet who can drive at all safely.\n\nI am afraid I must shorten my letter this week, for I have an inflamed eye and letter writing tires me more than it used to do.\n\nWith love from us both\n\nYour affectionate father.\n\nEdward L. Fenn\n\nAlston Court.\n\nNayland\n\nSuffolk\n\nJune 20, 1907\n\nMy dear Harold.\n\nYour letter of May 9, reached me this morning, and it gave me great pleasure to receive it and know that you are keeping well. I am very thankful to say that I have been going on well with only just two convulsive seizures of which to head, chiefly in my left arm and side of my face. Dr Ferrier kindly came down and examined me with the opthalmascope(?) report very encouraging. I am of course still very shaky and have more difficulty in letter writing. Sometimes, I am afraid making sad nonsense of my sentences.\n\nMr DeVere's(?) photos came out beautiful prints and a copy was\n\nPage 2\n\nposted out to you, some little time back, May 29 I think. So it should reach you, I hope in due time, and you can show the modern New Zealanders what the old country can do in domestic architectural works. I cannot send in the original photos away as I only have one copy, and they very fragile.\n\nI am quite sure that you have done your best during your first year, . . . . . Everything was so new to you and the manual work so unusually hard work for you . . . . . should be of great assistance to you, and prepared you for the hard physical work you have had to do.\n\nI often thank God for your steadiness and determination to stick to your work, and do your best to qualify yourself of the work that lies before you and I trust you may in time build up a happy home for yourself. That your character is being formed upon good principles. assure me that you will do well . . . . . I am sure Arthur Elworthy is a good man to work with.\n\nLet me know when you get it that the bank . . . . . . difficulty about crediting you with the 20 pounds I sent you a cheque for. I was not certain, they might not require me to send it through the Bank of New Zealand in London.\n\nAunt Annie has sold the lease of the Bridge House at Richmond(?) - a lucky stroke as it . . . . . . . . . to sell - a public house at the back and bridge and steep slope in front most it most difficult to find and purchase. A man from Hammersmith has brought it I believe and will convert it with tea gardens.\n\nAunt A has taken a house in St Margaret's Avenue, close to the ferry landing place. so she can get over to Ariah(?) Lane immediately and so to Richmond. We are so surprised to hear that the girls are going into St Bartholomew's nursing training home. I wish they had left it for two or three more years before plunging into this unpleasant work, and it is a great strain upon the strengths of young girls.\n\nPage 3\n\nI see my sentences are becoming confused so will leave this to Mater to finish the page.\n\nEver your affectionate father.\n\nEdward L Fenn.\n\nMy dear Harry\n\nIt is quite time for your dear father, to have his afternoon nap, and I am winding up for him. I have just read him off to sleep first your letters always give him so much pleasure. The weather has been rather against him so very changeable, but I think if it once get settled and he is able to be out more he will get stronger.\n\nCharlie is coming next Monday (June 24) he is taking part in the Nayland Dramatic Entertainment July 27 Miss Johnson is also acting the proceeds are to go to the Cricket Club\n\nMuch love from us all.\n\nYou're very affectionate.\n\nMater.\n\n48. Edward's Letters 35: To His Son Harry In NZ, Dated 4 Jul 1907, 24 Jul 1907, 8 Aug 1907. Nayland\n\nJuly 4, 1907\n\nMater wrote to you yesterday I believe and I am only sending a few lines in my own writing as a postscript so to speak. I cannot say much about progress, as I do not think it is within measure or continuous, but I am thankful . . . . . I am not any worse, nor have I had any reoccurrence of the convulsive attacks. Adria with Miss Johnson and the little Syretts are staying at Felixstowe but the weather so far has been cold and wet.\n\nI was very pleased to hear that Edgar has passed his final exam for the Oxford B.A.\n\nIt is a great pleasure to me to have such good account of you that your health is good and that you stick steadily to your work.\n\nGod grant, we may one day be spared to meet again . . . .\n\nEver your affectionate father.\n\nEdward L. Fenn\n\nPostcard\n\nAlston Court\n\nNayland\n\nSuffolk\n\nJuly 24, 1907\n\nMy dear Harold.\n\nThe weather has at last changed at little and we are enjoying the commencement of a little summer warmth, nearly all July was cold and wet, and we were rarely without a fire in the evening. I continue to gain strength, but I am worried with a good deal of pain in my right leg, however, I live in hope of improvement. We have enjoyed visits from Mr Todd and Mabel, Charlie, Van and Edgar during the past month. Bob returns home on the 30th.\n\nI hope I hope your work is going on well and that you feel you are a getting hold of the details of New Zealand farming. I believe Ada and Bertha enter upon the hospital nursing course next week, but we have not heard anything of them yet from themselves directly, so can tell you nothing about them of interest.\n\nPage 2\n\nI am asking Van to go on for me as I am soon tired of writing. Perhaps this tires me more than anything else, but don't shorten your letters in proportion as I always enjoy hearing of view and from you.\n\nIn Van's writing.\n\nMany thanks for your last letter which reached me a week or so ago, I am at home just now for part of my summer holiday. I had to divide it up, this year and opted a week first of all at St Minver with the Bucknalls at the beginning of the month and Tuesday last I came down to Nayland to spend a fortnight or so at home. Edgar has gone off to Richmond and Charlie (also on holiday) is we don't know where: but I'm hoping to see him down here this week. Robert comes on Tuesday from school. We are looking forward to the Sunday School treat which has been fixed for this afternoon. Miss Johnson, Adrian and I hope to attend. It takes place at the vicarage this year.\n\nI am afraid I shall not see Ada and Bertha during their stay in England. They are not coming to Nayland until later in the year and I do not suppose they will be near Cuckfield.\n\nUncle Henry and Aunt Ada will be coming back to Brighton in the autumn, I always in my visits to Devonshire Place, which take place periodically when they are there. Did I tell you how on one occasion Aunt Ada and I saw Professor Cyril diving off the pier on a bicycle.\n\nI have just purchased a new tire for the back wheel of your old machine. This is the first big sum I have spent on it. It still travels well, although it looks a bit rusty in parts from being out in all weathers, and not getting cleaned as often and as it should. I hope it will not be long\n\nPage 3\n\nbefore you are able to get a bicycle yourself. We have not had news of Cyril has some time, but he is I fancy cruising about in the Channel with the home Fleet on HMS Warrior.\n\nWe saw the Prince of Wales, dashing through Head Street yesterday in a motorcar. It reminded me of the day when you and Cyril and I saw the present king on his way to the station when you were returning to school.\n\nThe Colchester sports, I see are fixed for next month but too late for me to go to them, I have not had a bathe and the old baths for a long time. A letter has just arrived from Cyril. He is at Chatham, and he sends us a photo of himself and fellow officers taken on board. Now I must leave room for father to wind up.\n\nIn ELF's writing\n\nVan having kindly filled up my lacking brain for me.\n\nI now remain.\n\nYour affectionate father.\n\nEdward L Fenn\n\nAlston Court\n\nNayland\n\nAugust 8, 1907\n\nMy dear Harold.\n\nI was glad to receive your letter yesterday, dated June 24 in which you mentioned that you came to have sole charge of the electric shearing machine. It is also nice to hear it you are going to turn your old business to account, and it ought to pay you well after a time besides giving you a better position on the station. Your \"Boss\" seems to be a fine rider, generally coming in first in the steeplechase. I will let you know when the girls have decided when they will come to Nayland.\n\nPage 2\n\nNovember ish I expect be the month a dull month for a country visit, but it seems to suit their other engagements. But we are not likely to hear whether Charlie or Van or Cyril are home just then, but the latter is always uncertain now so we much hope for some help for him(?) Charlie and Mr Fuller came down in the motorcar a fortnight ago and that very evening, just after their arrival I had an attack the first one since February. It was a short affair and left no paralysis afterwards, but I was unconcious and slightly convulsed, while it lasted. I hope I shall not feel any worse for it in a little while but a relapse was very disappointing having had no return since February.\n\nAunt Annie and Margery are staying at Mr Gowings for a week and afterwards Margery goes to Holland with Lottie Alston on a sketching expedition\n\nWith with every good wish for your health and happiness.\n\nBelieve me, ever\n\nYr affectionate father.\n\nEdward L Fenn.\n\n49. Edward's Letters 36: To His Son Harry In NZ, Dated 9 Aug 1907, 15 Aug 1907, 3/4 Sep 1907.\n\nAlston Court\n\nNayland\n\nSuffolk\n\nAugust 9, 1907\n\nMy dear Harry.\n\nI think Van helped me with my last letter but I hope to manage better today and write to you myself. I have felt better and more like myself, for the last week or so now I am still weak in limb and forgetful in mind.\n\nAunt Annie Hand has been staying in Nayland for three weeks partly in lodgings and partly here. And next week, Aunt Lucy and Margaret and Kitty Hopkins come for a fortnight so I am not deserted by\n\nPage 2\n\nmy relations. We are trying for a post as a junior master in a preparatory school for Edgar. It could be bad for him to be hanging about here doing nothing, so the sooner he gets something to do the better. For a month or until we hear of something he is going to stay with Van at Cuckfield\n\nI hope your coaching about your shearing machine has gone off satisfactorily and that you feel quite competent now to direct your workers under you, you are no doubt right not to undertake too much mechanics work as you want to become an adept at farming generally in all its branches. I hope someday you will meet with some one with whom you can join forces, but go slowly and require more years and experience before investing money in the matter.\n\nI am very much hoping to be able to take my seat upon the bench at its next sitting at the end of September, but I cannot help feeling rather nervous at appearing at any public function. We have found five wasps nests in the garden and field and hope we have now destroyed them all. Mr Taylor stayed two nights with us and gave Bob the character of being a good steady worker, but neither quick nor clever So he follows in his elder brother's footsteps, but it is a very good character for a boy to be good and tidy at his work. I am afraid, his mother would not like him to emigrate, but personally I think the openings in the new world are better than in the old. But you miss the amenities\n\nPage 3\n\nof life, music etc, and the church privileges of the old country.\n\nThank you for writing so regularly, your letters, give me great pleasure.\n\nWith love from us all\n\nBelieve me\n\nYour affectionate father.\n\nEdward L. Fenn\n\nPostcard\n\nNayland\n\nAugust 15, 1907?\n\nMy dear H.\n\nA card is better than nothing, as a greeting to you. I am going on fairly well but very soon get tired. Aunt Annie comes to us tomorrow. George Sumner and Maggie go on their various ways then. I think you are right as to your future to aim at a thorough all round knowledge of farming with an eye to your future and not stick to one depart (sic) to exclusively. Your reports of your work, are a great comfort to me and I have great confidence in your future progress.\n\nE. L. F.\n\nAlston Court\n\nNayland\n\nSuffolk\n\nSeptember 3, 1907\n\nMy dear Harold\n\nI sincerely trust you are quite well now for your account of yourself tormented with asthma and boils made me very sorry for you in immersed in your work and no one to look after you. I do not know of anything that does much good for either complaint unless it be sometimes a change of residence -- going up to higher ground for instance, but you cannot . . . . . beforehand it is a\n\nPage 2\n\nmatter of experiment. A tablespoonful of yeast taken three times a day in a little beer or water (I don't know if it is nasty or not) is said to be of considerable use in checking their repetition.\n\nI have been going on more satisfactorily for the last month past, gaining strength and no return of the fits. I walk up the village sometimes though to no great extent. Edgar is trying for an appointment as a junior master in a preparatory school - I think he will do if only he can show enough force of character to control the boys. Taylor does not think that Bob has much chance of winning an entrance scholarship in a public school and so we must let him plod on in the usual course. Taylor says he is a very steady worker and a favourite amongst his schoolfellows and developing into a good cricketer.\n\nAlthough your letters are very welcome don't bother to write when you are seedy but try and send a postcard if you can just to tell me how your. Our prayers go with you in your life and work\n\nBelieve me ever\n\nYour affectionate father\n\nEdward L. Fenn\n\nSeptember 4\n\nYour letter of July 23 just received - glad to hear you are rather better and that you have seen a doctor about the boils - sharpened little wooden matches dipped in carbolic and glycerine equal parts and then rolled in fingers and thumb and tell until the vesicle onto top of\n\nPage 3\n\nthe boil is perforated is the base is the best thing I know of to destroy the germ and stop the repetition.\n\nWe shall anxiously look out for your next card.\n\n50. Edward's Letters 37: To His Son Harry In NZ, Dated 12 Sep 1907, 26 Sep 1907, 23 Oct 1907.\n\nAlston Court\n\nNayland\n\nSuffolk\n\nSeptember 12, 1907\n\nMy dear Harold\n\nI was much relieved to have a better account from you about asthma and boils. I too am going on fairly well and the weather being finer and warmer has been much in my favour. I hope New Zealand has enjoyed some nice rains - we have been full of garden parties here but all out holiday pursuits are coming to an end and we are thinking more of school, and serious occupations. Edgar has not heard of any opening yet but he must be patient cheerful. I hope you're Uncle\n\nPage 2\n\nChurchill's . . . . . up the West Coast has been satisfactory and that he suffered no mishaps by land or flood. Aunt Margaret returned to Eastbourne on Tuesday . . . . . and I think Aunt Lucy and Kitty return early next week. Aunt Isabella and Willie are staying at the Isle of White: Tolland Bay(?). I shall be glad to have a card from you and I hope be cheered about you.\n\nAre the prospects hopeful for the year . . . . I suppose in your specialty of sheep farming you cannot tell much until the lambing season is on. I must ask Mater to finish this finally. I am so helpless in better writing by . . . . When you have share received it let me know the amount of your doctors bill as I should like to settle it for you\n\nYour affectionate father\n\nEdward L. Fenn\n\nIn Mater's is writing\n\nMy dear Harry\n\nAt last I am sending you Adria's photo you must not think she really looks like that though she has grown very much, very nearly as tall as me - but her face has not that heavy expression. Your dear father has been decidedly better during the last month and he says himself that he feels better which is lovely to hear.\n\nPage 3\n\nBeau's holidays are coming to an end and he returns to Broadstairs, 22nd inst - they have all had very happy holidays with of course heaps of cricket -if they are enjoying Kitty Hopkins company she seems a nice girl. We are sorry about the asthma I do hope it has quite gone by now.\n\nMuch love from us all\n\nYour very affectionate\n\nMater\n\nAlston court\n\nNayland\n\nSuffolk\n\nSeptember 26, 1907\n\nMy dear Harold\n\nI wish I was on telephone to Pareora and could therefore hear before I write how you are. I trust that asthma and boils are things of the past. I have not been very grand just the last week a tendency to spit blood obliging me to be careful about my exertion. But I do not believe it means much more than nose bleeding in the wrong place.\n\nEdgar is my chief anxiety just now, it seems so difficult to get him into any work. Employers are afraid of his arm leading to great a hindrance to his usefulness. Have you heard from Charlie that he called upon that little nurses as he calls them and he thinks\n\nPage 2\n\nthat they have had about enough of it already and will not be sorry when December 1 arrives. They paid him a return visit one Sunday afternoon and had tea at Streatham Place. I saw very good photos enlarged at gallons a day at Gowan's the other day showing the octagonal font in Stoke and a view beyond between two of the pillars beyond showing the stained-glass panel to the memory of Mr Torlesse. I bought it and gave it to Miss Fanny Torlesse to remind her of her father and of your baptism. She was very pleased to have it.\n\nAre field glasses useful to you, as Christmas is coming on and I should like to give you something really useful, your last pair was taken and that made me think you might like to have them replaced but I shall be glad of any suggestion from you if there is anything you would prefer.\n\nI hope the electrical shearing change will add a nice little bit to your wages you have been so careful with your money that you ought to be able to plant a nice little nest egg for the future\n\nI do not think I can write any more today I am in the bed and writing fatigues me\n\nBelieve me all ways\n\nYour affectionate father\n\nEdward L Fenn\n\nAlston Court\n\nNayland\n\nSuffolk\n\nOctober 23, 1907\n\nMy dear Harold\n\nI am delighted to know by your last letter that the boils are apparently on the wain in severity(?), are you and your chum occupying the Elworthy's dining room now, is the young men in the office. I congratulate you on the possession of such a fine dog as \"Black Darkie\" Aunt Isabella and Dolly are here just now and Gerald has just gone the New Zealanders are still coming the first week in November I believe (Charlie suggested) but they keep changing their plans so that we are still uncertain as to when we shall really see them but these repeated delays mean\n\nPage 2\n\nthat they have driven their visit off to the worst months in the year . . . . . when we shall probably have neither weather nor visitors . . . . . and none of the sons at home except Edgar who having failed to obtain the post he was trying for will be our only helper in guiding the visitors about. Edgar has also tried for a stool in a bank but one of his duties was to reach over and arrange the big ledgers at the opening and closing of the bank and his left-hand was too crippled to manage this office work with such . . . . heavy lifting . . . . . or a tutorship. I lost my Oyster Feast this year and I must remember to send you a Standard to shake up your remembrance of Colchester Worthies.\n\nFor myself I remain the status quo pretty well, weakened chiefly in my walking. I seldom go beyond the garden . . . . . in a bath-chair as my left . . . . . 3 weeks and uncertain in walking\n\nWhenever I see our little flocks of 200 or 300 sheep strolling down the road I think of your thousands on the open prairie is and think what a very different job it must be but you are only going back to the earliest times on earth shepherds everywhere. Have you been so lucky as to hear any music of late I am so glad whenever you get the opportunity to hear some music or a play etc for sheep farming must be very monotonous but may turn up very lucrative, in the end you may yet get the opportunity opportunity (sic) of enjoying all these things\n\nWith love from us all\n\nYour affectionate father\n\nEdward L. Fenn\n\n51. Edward's Last Letters 37: To His Son Harry In NZ, Dated 30 Oct 1907, 13 Nov 1907, 21 Nov 1907.\n\nNayland\n\nWednesday October 30, 1907\n\nMy dear Harry\n\nI will begin my letter a day before the proper day in case I am not up to writing tomorrow. I am so sorry to hear that you are still enduring the boils I really did hope they were more decidedly on the wane. Resin(?) ointment smeared on linen and a piece of rag outside ought to help you pressure is nearly always helpful on top of these horrors. I am glad you have acquired another good dog they are such a necessity in your life.\n\nAunt Isabella and Dolly are spending a fortnight with us. Nayland is all in excitement today as a menagerie pays us a visit tomorrow procession followed by an exhibition tent in a big tent. I heard that Henry is shortly leaving the White Hart to start a wine merchants in Colchester. The weather has been very unsettled\n\nPage 2\n\non the whole, September was very fine Oct\n\n. . . . so but is going out wet(?)\n\nI expect your paddocks are frightfully muddy however these will dry and come off. I am sending you another watch for your Christmas present for I have quite forgotten if I sent you one or not after you lost yours in the spring. Our deaf parlourmaid makes all manner of awkward mistakes but we best wait a little longer to see if she can improve because she has several good points.\n\nPoor Edgar cannot . . . . . . of a tutorship yet which seemed just the thing when the man thought he had better choose one with more experience - quite unnecessary with such young pupils 101/2 to 13 he kept his name on Gilberts(?) list but he has had no luck yet, his arm poor fellow cripples him in all directions. No news of Ada and Bertha coming yet they are going sometime between . . . . . and Xmas to Aunt Ada who has now come back to Brighton with Uncle Henry. I hear that Charlie is taking up your daily(?) paper from Van for the next 12 months do you crave any books from time to time or are you to sleepy for evening reading boils and asthma . . . . . may perhaps rather . . . . . to a novel.\n\nI have been going on fairly well lately but am very staggering at times especially if I start off at all quickly before I have got my balance correctly\n\nOur united love and best wishes for the coming Xmas, fill up your next letter with an account of your life's daily routine are you still being looked after in Mr Elworthy's house or are you altogether in your own quarters and what are these quarters I don't know it at all just now where you sleep and live\n\nOct 31.\n\nPage 3\n\nDo you pay for your sheepdog yourself or does the Boss look upon a dog as a part of a necessary outfit for looking after his sheep. I suppose you must get them to know to obey you and you only.\n\nI seem to have ended my letter twice so accept our united love again\n\nYour affectionate father\n\nEdward L. Fenn\n\nAlston Court\n\nNayland\n\nNovember 13, 1907 12:15 p.m.\n\nMy dear Harold.\n\nI was very glad to hear from you this morning and that you were able to give a good account of yourself. You are reaping the benefit now of facing weathers and duties, wherever, they may call you. I know, I quite realise you live a very hard life, but it is a wholesome, manly, and it is so difficult to . . . . . alone in England. I believe there will get to you, this will get to you . . . . . about Christmas . . . . . any of our letters so you must accept our . . . . . good Xmas wishes for the year, I am sending you a key less watch for a present in place of the one you lost,\n\nPage 2\n\nas I forget whether you ever placed replaced your lost one. I hope to send a card photo also. Mr Gowers first was a failure, and the NZ girls are here for a week and if I could have entertained them I would have persuaded them to stay longer - but this all falls on Edgar's shoulders. They go on next to Aunt Ada's at Brighton, I am sorry so many of their relations are hors-de-combat just now when we are all anxious to entertain them. They are both very pleasant, good looking delightful girls Ada has her mothers voice and very delicate pretty features Bertha is rater like . . . . . They showed me the large Julius group taken I believe shortly before they left New Zealand it was very interesting as it included all the married daughters and their children and then their mother and the Bishop and the sons-in-law so it was a very comprehensive picture. Bertha has plenty of spirit in her and energy, the girls and Edgar were all nearly shot out of the dogcart yesterday they had kept Molly (the horse) waiting and she was restless having only been clipped a day or two before and felt cold so she began to jump herself up and down to warm herself, poor Edgar . . . . . no firm hold Bertha slid down onto the mat in front on her knees but was not discomposed in the least - they both behaved like born horsewomen. I suppose they have a good deal of practice in NZ and showed no nervousness. I feel I know your life etc much better since I have talked with A & B it all seems more lifelike, they give you great credit for your perseverance\n\nPage 3\n\nand say you are sure to succeed as you have learnt your year work from the beginning\n\nWe all wish you every good Xmas wish with happiness and success in your life progess. I am glad you heard Faust the music is such a treat and must be so refreshing amidst your work. Edgar has had no luck yet in his search for a tutorship for a small boy but he must have patience applicants all seem to be afraid of his arm. I think tho except for games it makes no difference its his ability to do all that is wanted . . . . . .\n\nThough still very weak in my leg I am fairly well in myself only I walk very little now and trust more to my bathchair\n\nWith much love from us all\n\nYr affectionate father\n\nEdward L Fenn\n\nMy writing is very shaky\n\nNayland\n\nNovember 21, 1907\n\nMy dear Harold\n\nXmas has passed but I can still wish you all good wishes for the year ahead for the new year - I hope this superintending of the shearing house and machinery will not only give you some responsible work undercover but a decided increase of pounds shillings and pence for you want to save and keep keeping with an eye to your future. We enjoyed the . . . . . .visit the girls were able to spare us they were so much in request that we had to be contented with rather a short visit, they are very nice girls and I like them both very much Edgar was in love with both of them and rarely took his eyes from them whilst they were here they took\n\nPage 2\n\npart in . . . . . the Choir Society practice . . . . . . whether or no on the strength of this Edgar joined the club this year as an active bass.\n\nThe girls are making a long stay in Europe . . . . . they proceed next to Wiesbaden I believe and they have still got . . . . . to do. Uncle Arthur is still most poorly he still sees double and he has someone one and has someone to go up and up to London with him it will probably get right again when the blood the result of the blow is all absorbed\n\nMaters writing\n\nI am finishing this for your father as he stopped writing to go out for a hour before luncheon in his bath-chair we all went by the Stoke Road and the sea and the sun was very bright so he found it very pleasant he was able to go over to Roberts yesterday afternoon to be present with Mr Dudgeon at the distribution of \"Cole's Loaf\" 170 loaves were given away to the poor of Nayland. They seemed very pleased to see your father there.\n\nHe has been pretty well lately I wish he could gain more strength but they say cases like this are always very slow\n\nI had a nice letter from Ada today she and Bertha are now at Brighton with the Hunts\n\nPage 3\n\nthe same post brought news of the death of my aunt Elizabeth she had not been very well but they thought was getting better but a bad heart attack came on last Monday and she died (quite peacefully) at 10 o'clock the following Wednesday morning, my dear father will miss her very much I fear\n\nBeau writes they are getting up a play at school he is to be Dame Rumple an old woman he is getting quite a swell at football. I do hope so much your asthma has left you\n\nMuch love from us all\n\nYours very affectionately\n\nMater.\n\n52.

Your letters have been much better lately - It is such a nice bright morning after all the rain and cold we have had lately. If you have really bad toothache you must ask Mr Hammond to let you have it taken out - it is a stupid little tooth that is no good and you could go to someone at Dover, but if it is better we will have it out in the holidays.\n\nI will write a longer letter next week - Much love from us all\n\nEver your loving\n\nAunt Polly\n\nIn a black edged envelope 12x9.5cm stamp ripped of, illegible date.\n\nRoyal Mount\n\nEphraim Hotel\n\nTunbridge Wells\n\nKent\n\nFebruary 19, 1889.\n\nMy darling Vandy,\n\nThe postman must bring you my birthday greeting as I shall not see you till later in the day.

I am so glad you like cricket & are doing well at it - I should like you to get a really good hand at it - Father was the champion player at his school. When you come to Barmouth you will have to be a good walker & climber, & go up Snowdon with us. Father will like you to go excursions with him. I have begun to get your things ready, for we go on Aug 2nd & there will not be much time after you come home. Vandy has had a little Fox Terrier given him by Miss MacKinnon it is rather a mongrel cur, & not pretty like Vic(?), but I think will be a nice affec'ate little beast. I have had King Bar photographed & Van & Cyril, they are very good ones - Bar thinks it is a beautiful picture. Another Boy's own Paper has come, but I will keep it for you to take to the sea. It is late, & I am rather sleepy so Goodnight.\n\nMy darling boy - much love\n\nEver Yr most loving\n\nAuntie Polly\n\n1 Portland Terrace\n\nSept 20th 1889\n\nMy own darling Vandy\n\nI shall come to see you tomorrow afternoon, Saturday, about three o'clock - so you must ask Mrs Allen if you may wait in for me - it will be nice to hear all you have been doing and I hope I shall see a very happy boy - if it is fine I shall bring Cyril with me - We all miss you very much.\n\nMuch love darling boy\n\nFrom your most loving\n\nAuntie Polly\n\nOn note paper headed with crest & motto immobilis.\n\nSheen House\n\nHarrogate Oct 4th 1889.\n\nMy darling Ernest,\n\nI am going to try and not call you Vandy anymore. Tomorrow, instead of seeing me you must have a nice long letter and on Monday I shall hope to have one from you - Cyril and I came here with Tip and Georgie last Tuesday - it has been rather cold and wet until today - but now I have just come in from a walk and it was beautiful - Miss Veitch took Cyril to a bazaar in the town yesterday and he bought a few penny things. Edith Brownrigg is coming to tea with us this afternoon and next week she is going to Norway to stay a long time - Poor Father and Bar will be very dull at home until we go back to them - Georgie goes back to Cambridge next Tuesday and then Cyril will have to begin much harder lessons with me. If he has time he is going to send a letter in this - Tell me in your letter if you can read mine easily. When I come home it will be nearly the time for your holiday - you must try and do your very best at lessons and play and then the time will pass quickly and you will be a happy boy. Did you like the lecture? Nurse will send the rest of your shirts by Father some day - Goodbye now my darling.\n\nMuch love from Auntie Ada and Cyril and most of all,\n\nFrom your very loving\n\nAuntie Polly.\n\nSheen House\n\nHarrogate\n\nOctober 11, 1889\n\nMy darling Ernie,\n\nI am so sorry to hear from father that you have been on the sick list, and had bad eyes. I hope they soon are well, and you are back at work again. Cyril and I were very glad to get your letters he was very pleased with his. We do lessons every morning and then Cyril, Tip, and I go out for a walk - it has been such bad weather that we have not yet been able to go any nice country walks, like our old ones.\n\nA little girl has been spending the afternoon here, she is younger than Baa but bigger and so spoilt and naughty - she knocked down everything Cyril built, would not eat her dinner, and we are all rather glad she is gone again. We have been to the gardens once, but it is not warm enough to sit about there. We shall have a great deal to talk about when we meet, I expect we shall go home about the 30th - Georgie has gone back to Cambridge.\n\nAnd now dear old boy goodbye.\n\nMuch love from us all - longing to see you again.\n\nEver your most loving\n\nAuntie Polly.\n\nHastings\n\nJany 31st\n\nMy darling Harry,\n\nI promised you a letter on your first Sunday so I must fill this sheet of paper with all my news. We came here on Tuesday in the pouring rain and after driving about in a cab for some time, found some nice lodgings, but not facing the sea we have about three minutes walk to the parade - the first evening it was very rough, the waves were dashing up, the rain was pelting and we were glad to shut ourselves up away from it. Yesterday we started to see the Castle, the way up to it is very steep & dirty and the first thing Cyril, of course, does, is to fall down, and rise up covered with sticky mud from top to toe, so we had to leave the Castle and get home by back streets. Today has been very drizzling and we went out very little. Father sent me your card and I shall read your next letter when I get home on Tuesday. Poor Tip was so sad the evening you left, he roamed about from room to room in the greatest desolation. Winnie B came with us she is playing letters now with Vandy. Cyril has gone to bed and I am tired and sleepy. So goodbye my darling boy I have missed you so much and hope you are a happy boy.\n\nMuch love\n\nfrom yr ever loving\n\nAuntie Polly\n\nOn notepaper with the heading cut off.\n\nXI The Green\n\nRichmond Febry 16.\n\nDearest Harry,\n\nThis must be my morning for writing to you and Charlie for Van and Cyril have a holiday on Saturdays, if they work well through the week; and I get more time. Next Wednesday will be Vandy's birthday so they will have another holiday and come to dinner with me instead. We have had such deep snow this week but it is now all gone and baby says \" the grass is come again\". Last week I went with Aunt Isabella and Dolly to the Dogs House in London - I want one of those long dogs with crooked legs called a Dashshund and Dolly wants a pug - but although there were more than 600 in the House we could not get one we liked - they were nearly all mongrels. T(sic) kill over 300 a week - put them into a very large cage with a sort of stuff like chloroform and they lie down and die without any pain. I saw four little dead doggies looking just as if they were asleep"
