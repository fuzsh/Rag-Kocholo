Woman Said to Have Had Money To the end that the city may be reimbursed for aid given her and for funeral expenses, if it develops that there is any funds, the council last night directed the poor committee to ask an administrator in the death of Barbara Underle, an aged woman found dead in her room at Seventh and York Streets several weeks ago. The city proposes to have an investigation into the case. Mrs. Underle lived alone in an upstairs room of a house occupied by another aged woman. After her death, a son at Milwaukee who came here for the burial, claimed that his mother has a sum of money, reported to be $1,000 sewed in her petticoat but no trace of the money was found. It was said the house had been ransacked. While city officials accept the story of the dead woman having had money with a grain of salt, they believe that an investigation should be made and to this end Chr. Schenian of the Poor committee advised that an administrator be asked for in an effort to locate money or property of the woman if any existed.

Apparently young Anderson was not seriously hurt, being able to walk to the Pittsley home, near the road, about a block from the scene of the accident, to have the blood washed from his face. He was brought to the city in an auto driven by a lad named Rusboldt and cared for at the office of Dr. Kuhan. He complained to the physician that he could not see very well. Later he was taken to the hospital. This was shortly before 11 o'clock. He lost consciousness and died at 1:15 this morning. Anderson and a companion John McCarthy, had been to Two Rivers on their motorcycles and were enroute back home here, shortly after 10 o'clock. McCarthy was far in advance of Anderson and fearing that an accident had befallen him, stopped at the side of the ______road, placing his machine on the rest with the front wheel extending over the right side of the highway. Just at this moment Anderson came along and crashed into the standing motorcycle, and was thrown nearly fifty feet over the handle bars. McCarthy says that Anderson was able to pick himself up and together they proceeded to the Pittsley home where the blood was washed from his wounds, after which he was brought to the physician's office here in an auto. Anderson complained of pains in his head, and with not being able to see well and it is probable that his skull was fractured. He soon lost consciousness on the way to the hospital and sank rapidly. Young Anderson, who was a son of Mr. Emma Anderson, North Twenty-first street, has been employed as a machinist at the Richards Iron works for the last three years.

ANDERSON (d. 1924) Two Employees of Public Service Company Killed at Rapids Today Gilbert Anderson, 44 and Erwin Orth, 19, Members of Line Crew are Victims - Details of Tragedy Two members of a line crew of the Wisconsin Public Service and High Falls Company, operating out of this city, both Manitowoc County residents, were electrocuted while at work on lines of the community at Manitowoc Rapids this morning when 33,000 volts of electricity passed through their bodies. Gilbert Anderson, 44, married, a resident of Rural Route 1 and Erwin Orth, 19, single, South Eleventh Street, this city. (Accident details omitted) Both Anderson and Orth are Manitowoc men, well known in the city. Mr. Anderson's home is near Madsen, on rural route 1, out of this city, where a wife and one daughter received the news of the tragedy as a terrible shock. Mrs. Anderson is prostrated by the death of her husband and is being attended by her daughter and neighbors. Mr. Anderson had been employed with the Wisconsin Public service Company for two years, being experienced in his work. A trick of fate claimed his life, the action of the wind being unforeseen as the loose wire was being drawn for its fastening. The Orth boy is a son of Mr. and Mrs. Matthew Orth, South Eleventh Street and a youth of brilliant promise. He had accepted a position with the Public service Co., less than a year ago after retiring from the insurance business in which he had been engaged with John Kadow Jr. He was about 19 years old, born in this city and was employed under his brother-in-law, C.J. Krieser, who is foreman of the line crew of the company. Besides his parents, Mr. Orth is survived by three sisters, Mrs. Krieser and twin sisters, Veronica and Virginia. Orth attended the local high school and was a dependable and industrious youth. Coroner W.G. Kemper, after being informed of the circumstances and investigating the accident, decided that no inquest need be called and announced that no steps would be taken in this direction by his office. The wire which the men were handling at the time of the accident was carrying no current and but for action of the wind carrying it into contact with the high tension wire there would have been no damage. Funeral arrangements have not been made for the two men.
