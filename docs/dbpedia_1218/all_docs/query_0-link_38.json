        "text": "South Africa | Lutheran Orient Missions | Andrew Burgess | Olaf Cartford | John Halvorson | Fredrick Schiotz | Edward Sovik | Rolf Syrdal\n\nSouth Africa\n\nHistorical sketch\n\nThe first Lutheran missionaries to the Cape area of southern Africa, sent by the Berlin Mission Society, arrived in 1834. Ten years later, Hans Paludan Schreuder of Norway was sent by a mission committee, which eventually became the Norwegian Missionary Society, to begin working among the Zulus in Natal (now Durban). Schreuder established the first permanent mission station among the Zulus in 1851; the first baptism of a Zulu person took place in 1858. In 1873, a policy disagreement led Schreuder to leave the N.M.S. His missionary endeavors, renamed the Schreuder Mission, subsequently came under the administrative oversight of the Church of Norway. After the merger that created the Norwegian Lutheran Church in America (later renamed the Evangelical Lutheran Church) in 1917, the Schreuder Mission in South Africa was recognized as an “official mission” of the new church body. The NLCA took over management of the Schreuder Mission in 1927, at which time the name was changed to the American Lutheran Mission in South Africa. When a synod was formed in its area, it was named the Mankankanana Synod, after the Zulu name for Schreuder.\n\nIn 1960, a merger occurred between the Mankankanana Synod and three other Lutheran synods in the Zulu-speaking area, including those which had developed from the efforts of the Berlin Mission, the Church of Sweden Mission, and the Norwegian Missionary Society. The new church body was named the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Southern Africa-South Eastern Region (ELCSA-SER). In 1963, the Hermannsburg Synod also joined. The Evangelical Lutheran Church in Southern Africa (ELCSA) was formed in 1975 when the ELCSA-SER and three other regional churches merged.\n\nLutherans have had a history of involvement in the most urgent social issues in South Africa, including racial equality, opposition to apartheid, ministry to those affected by AIDS, and women’s issues.\n\nScope and content\n\nThis collection contains materials pertaining to Lutheran missionary activities in what is now the country of South Africa. Minutes and correspondence of the Federation of Evangelical Lutheran Churches in Southern Africa (FELCSA), the Council of Churches on Lutheran Foundation (CCLF), the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Southern Africa (ELCSA), the South African Council of Churches (SACC), and the Joint Committee on South Africa (JCSA). Additional materials from ELCSA, including constitution, budgets, and officers’ records. Drafts, minutes and reports of ELCSA-SER, originally in Zulu with partial English translation. Minutes and reports of Cooperation Lutheran Missions (CLM) in Natal. Minutes, newsletters, and photographs from the Southern Africa Network (SAN). Correspondence, particularly with the Mission Office in Minneapolis, A.L.M., and individual missionaries. Budgets, reports, and yearbooks of Schreuder Mission and American Lutheran Mission. Draft constitution, maps, and historical writings on the Mankankanana Synod. Magazines, journals, and almanacs produced by churches and church bodies in southern Africa. Minutes and reports from the Church of Norway Mission, predominantly in Norwegian. Publications in Zulu, including Sunday school books, adult literacy books, hymnals, and altar book. Publications of the South African government and materials on government education programs. Materials on recent South African history, regarding post-apartheid challenges; HIV and AIDS; and prominent South Africans, including Nelson Mandela, Beyers Naude, and Alan Paton. Clippings from secular periodicals and pamphlets on social issues.\n\nDate span 1855 to 2003; bulk 1927 to 1994.\n\nBox list\n\nBox 1\n\nAmerican Lutheran Mission in South Africa. – Schreuder Mission until 1927\n\nMissionary Correspondence from 1939-1986 to the Mission Office in Minneapolis\n\n“Church of Norway Mission in S.A. – Schreuder Mission” 1927 –\n\nMAIN RESPONSIBILITY TRANSFERRED TO Norwegian Lutheran Church in America (NLCA) – later Evangelical Lutheran Church (ELC)\n\nMinutes of committee in Norway, 1855-1925\n\nAnnual Reports, 1911, 1912, 1918, 1919 (in Norwegian)\n\nReports & Minutes, 1926-1963\n\nSchreuder Mission and American Lutheran Mission (Schreuder Mission)\n\nReports, Budgets, Year Books, 1855-1925 (incomplete) (Note: In 1927, the Norwegian Lutheran Church in America (NLCA) took over the responsibility of the Schreuder Mission in Norway and the Schreuder Mission in South Africa.)\n\nAmerican Lutheran Mission in S.A.

The Mankankanana Synod was constituted as an independent body – evolving from the work of the American Lutheran Mission (Schreuder Mission) which began in 1927 when the then Norwegian Lutheran Church in America (NLCA – later ELC) at the request of the Schreuder Mission Committee in Norway took over their responsibility in South Africa.\n\nThis synod continued until 1961 when it became a part of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in South Africa – South Eastern Region (ELCSA-SER). (1960 Merger Convention. Began to operate in 1961) This body was constituted by the merger of 4 synods evolving from the work of the following mission organizations: Berlin Mission, Church of Sweden Mission, Norwegian Missionary Society and American Lutheran Mission. The Synod from the work of the Hermannsborg Mission joined in 1963.\n\n1. Documents: Draft Constitution, Assembly minutes from 1954,\n\nMinutes and Correspondence\n\nNote: Since Zulu was the “official” language of this synod, a much more complete collection of documents is in the archives in South Africa – in offices of the ELCSA-SED (South Eastern Diocese) in Umphumulo, Kwazulu – Natal.\n\nThis synod didn’t exist for a long period, but it was a very important step on the way to the formation of the South Eastern Region – ELCSA (SER) in 1960\n\n2.

Originally named the Inter-Synodical Lutheran Orient Mission Society, it is currently called Lutheran Mideast Development. Its purpose is to serve the Kurds, an ethnic group of some 25 million scattered among Turkey, Iraq, Syria, and Iran. The Kurds trace their origins to the Medes of the ancient Persian Empire.\n\nThe first missionaries sent were L. O. Fossum, a Lutheran pastor from Berwyn, Illinois, and E. Edman, a pastor and veteran of the India missions. They established a missionary compound at the city of Soujbulak; this property was completely destroyed during a war between Russia and Persia (1912-1916). The missionaries fled at that time. After World War I, Fossum returned. Before his death in 1920 at age 41, he produced a Kurdish alphabet, grammar, an English-Kurdish lexicon, as well as translations of the New Testament, Luther’s Small Catechism, and a hymnbook with 100 hymns and a Lutheran liturgy.\n\nMedical service was part of the missionary effort from the beginning. Fossum and Edman had brought nurses when they first arrived in Soujbulak, and a succession of medical personnel subsequently served in the territory. In the 1960s, Dr. Richard Gardiner, an English physician, labored to fund the construction a hospital in Gorveh, Iran. His hospital was closed in 1979 when LOM was forced to leave the country.\n\nPolitical circumstances made it impossible for LOM to continue its work in Iraq and Iran. LOM was ejected from Iraq in 1959 for no clearly stated reason. Nonetheless, Sadiq Shammi, an evangelist, was able to keep the Iraq mission field alive through the 1970s. After Shammi’s retirement, no one was able to continue in Iraq because of the war with Iran. At the beginning of the war, all foreigners were driven out of Iran, forcing the abandonment of that field as well. LOM subsequently set up operations in Egypt and Bangladesh, while continuing to hold its primary mission to be ministry to the Kurds wherever they could be reached.\n\nScope and content\n\nThis collection contains materials produced in the course of the Lutheran Orient Mission’s establishment and operations.
