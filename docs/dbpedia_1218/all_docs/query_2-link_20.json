Baron Dudley (took the name of Dudley).\n\nJohn Sutton, 1st. Baron Dudley, born before or on December 25, 1400. According to Ormerods's (Hist. Cheshire) Stow, Dugdale, etc. The first of the Sutton Dudley family, that is worthy of a particular notice is John Sutton, Lord Dudley, who had the honor of bearing the standard at the funeral of King Henry V., 1422. He was for 2 years Lord Lieut. of Ireland, being appointed Jan. 1428, in which for employment and other services, his merit was so conspicuous, that, in the 18th of Henry VI., 1439, he was summoned to Parliament then held at Reading, and in the same year he was appointed one of the commissioners to treat with the Duke of Burgundy upon a truce.\n\nIn 1446, being of the King's Council, he was sent as ambassador, with the bishop of Chichester, to the duke of Brittanny, and on another embassy to the Duke of Burgundy. In 1447, in consideration of his services, he received a grant of an annuity of one hundred pounds issuing out of the customs of the port of London. In 1451, as a staunch adherent to the house of Lancaster, he was surprised by Richard, Duke of York, at Gloucester, on his return from Ireland, he was sent to prison at the castle of Ludlow. He was taken prisoner with Henry VI on May 23, 1455 at the Battle of St. Albans. Soon afterwards he fought in the battle of Blore Heath, September 23, 1459, and being wounded, received thereupon, and for other services, honorable trusts and offices from his Sovereign, and grants of more the £200 per annum for life. Henry VI. also appointed him treasurer of his household, and was elected a Knight of the Garter before April, 23 1459. We are not told how long he remained in prison, but the House of Commons being mostly Yorkist, prayed the king to remove Sir John Sutton and some other noted persons from among them and exclude Sutton forever from his royal counsels, and ever to prohibit him from approaching within twelve miles of the court. Henry VI. refused this petition. Lord Dudley fought at the battle of St. Albans, May 23, 1455, where the king was defeated by the Duke of York and taken prisoner. Dudley was also taken a prisoner of war and sent to the Tower of London; but he was soon released, as peace prevailed shortly afterwards. He still, however, preserved in the Lancastrian cause for Henry VI. Leland, the noted antiquary, thus describes that action: \"At Blore Heath, was a field fought between the Earl of Salisbury and northern men on Kings Edward's part, who overcame the lords Audley (slain) and Dudley (wounded) with Queen Margaret and Chestershire men, who lost the field.\" Lord Dudley was one of the Knights taken prisoner. By singular good fortune he was equally honored in the next reign by Edward IV., who granted Lord Dudley a pardon in his first year from all debts upon accounts due from him in the exercise of his office, and, afterwards, another grant of one hundred marks yearly to issue from the Duchy of Cornwall, and lastly, one hundred pounds per annum from customs of the port of Southampton.\n\nIn the 17th of King Edward IV., he was employed as a Commissioner, with his brother-in-law, the Earl of Arundell, who married Dudley's wife's sister, Eleanor Berkeley to treat respecting the prorogation of the truce between France and England. In the Register of the Order of the Garter, it is recorded, that in 1461, Lord Dudley had the stall of the deceased Earl of Longueville. He was a prominent figure in the reigns of Henry VI and Edward IV. In his will he calls himself \"John Dudley, Knight, Lord Dudley.\" The date is August 17, 1487, and it is registered in P.C.C. 8 miles. He died in Sept. 30, 1487.\n\nThe arms on his seal are two passant, but on either side is a smaller shield, that on the dexter side being a cross patonce or flory, and that on the sinister side being a blue lion rampant, which the herald, Glover, probably intended for the Sutton's paternal coat; but, if so, the lion should be green.\n\nJohn Dudley and his wife, Elizabeth were buried in St. James's Priory, Dudley\n\nfound on ancestry.com\n\nSource of title Baron\n\nBaron Dudley is a title in the Peerage of England. It was created in circa 1440 for John Sutton, a soldier who served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. According to Debrett's Peerage and Baronetage he was actually summoned to Parliament as \"Johanni de Sutton de Duddeley militi\", whereby he is held to have become Baron Dudley. The title is sometime referred to as Baron Sutton of Dudley. The peerage was created by writ, which means that it can descend through both male and female lines.\n\nIt is in fact arguable that the title arose even earlier, as his ancestor John Sutton (died 1359) had a writ of summons to the Council on 25 February 1342, but neither he nor his son (died c.1370), grandson (died 10 March 1396) or great grandson (all called John Sutton of Dudley) were summoned,[1] so that they can probably not be regarded as peers.\n\nLord Dudley's great grandson, the third Baron, managed to get himself severely into debt and lost the family seat of Dudley Castle to his cousin John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland. He became known as \"Lord Quondam\" (\"Lord Has-been\" or \"Lord Formerly\"). However, Dudley Castle and the other family estates were restored to his son, the fourth Baron. He was succeeded by his son, the fifth Baron, who like his grandfather came heavily into debt. To clear his debts he married off his granddaughter and heir, Frances, to Sir Humble Ward, the son of a wealthy jeweller. Frances succeeded him and became the sixth holder of the title. In 1644 her husband Humble Ward was created Baron Ward, of Birmingham in the County of Warwick, by letters patent.\n\nThey were both succeeded by their son, the seventh and second Baron respectively. On the death in 1740 of the latter's grandson, the tenth Baron Dudley and fifth Baron Ward, the two titles separated. The barony of Ward, which could only be inherited by males, was passed on to the late Baron's kinsman, the sixth Baron (see the Earl of Dudley for later history of this title). The barony of Dudley was inherited by the Baron's nephew, Ferdinando Lea, 11th Baron Dudley, the eleventh Baron. He was the son of Frances, sister of the tenth Baron, and her husband William Lea. However, on Ferdinando's death in 1757 the peerage fell into abeyance between his sisters. It remained in abeyance for 159 years, but in 1916 the abeyance was terminated in favour of Ferdinando Dudley William Lea Smith, who became the twelfth Baron. He was the great-great-grandson of Anne, sister of the eleventh Baron, and her husband William Smith. As of 2010[update] the title is held by his grandson, the fifteenth Baron, who succeeded his mother in 2002 (who in her turn had succeeded her elder brother).\n\nThe holders of the title (until 1740) were the owners of Dudley Castle and an extensive estate around it, including the manors of Dudley, Sedgley, Kingswinford and Rowley Somery in Rowley Regis. By the 16th century, their main home was Himley Hall. On the death of the tenth Baron in 1740, the barony of Dudley passed to a female-line heir (see above), whereas the main estates were entailed to follow the barony of Ward and passed to a cousin. However, certain estates that had recently been purchased passed with the title Lord Dudley to the aforementioned Ferdinando Dudley Lea, the eleventh Baron Dudley."
