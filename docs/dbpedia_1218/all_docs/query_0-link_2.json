        "text": "Meaning, Origin, Etymology\n\nThis very popular Scottish and English surname name is a baptismal or patronymic surname meaning “the son of Andrew” or “the son of Anders”, deriving from the old personal (first) biblical name Andrew, which was popularized throughout the country due to the fact that St. Andrew (who lived in the Roman Empire in the 1st century AD) was the patron saint of Scotland. Andrew derived from the Greek name “Andreas”, meaning “man” or “manly”). It originated in parallel in the British Isles and the Nordic countries. Andrew was one the twelve disciples of Jesus Christ in the Christian religion. In Greek, it derives from the word andreios, meaning masculine, manly, or courageous. In the United States, this name has absorbed many cognate or similar sounding names from other European language, such as the Swedish Anderrson and the Norwegian/Danish Andersen. Due to Americanization the second s was often dropped out of names after immigrating. One source states the family lived among the Dalriadan clans. In Scotland, the family owned land in Moidart, but moved to Badenoch in the early 1300s AD. The most eminent branches established themselves in Dowhills, West Ardbreck, and Candacraigs in Strathdon. The surname Anderson was first found in Schleswig-Holstein and Denmark, where the family contributed greatly to the development of an emerging nation and would later play a large role in the political conflicts of the area. From early on, the name was represented by predominantly Danish families, although most of the Schleswig branches and many of the southern Danish branches spoke German. The first reference to the given name Andrew was a monk of Dunfermline, who later became the Bishop of Caithness in the reign of David I. The first references to the surname appeared in the 13th century. In 1296, David le fiz Andreu was recorded as a burgess of Peebles, and Duncan fiz Andreu of Dumfries was recorded as taking an oath of fealty. The Andersons held territories in Moidart, but later moved to Badenoch in the early 14th century. The most prominent branches of the Andersons were the Dowhills, West Ardbrecks and Candacraigs in Strathdon. Andersons have been involved in a number of record-breaking crimes. George ‘Dutch’ Anderson pulled off a 1921 mail van stick-up which yielded over £500,000; Charlie Anderson took part in the first Wild West train robbery (1866); and ‘Boston Pete’ Anderson successfully talked a reclusive miser out of £850,000 in 1866 and sensibly retired. The Anderson Shelter, invented by one-time British Chancellor of the Exchequer John Anderson, was a simple affair which could easily be installed (as over 3 million were) in a back garden. It saved countless lives during World War II air raids. Andersonville Prison in Sumter County, Georgia, was notorious during America’s Civil War. In the two years of its existence (1864—5) this log stockade of at most 26 acres housed over 32,000 Northern prisoners, half of whom died. There are towns called Anderson in the United Kingdom, Argentina and the United States, rivers of this name in Canada and the United States, and islands so named in Canada and Australia.\n\nSpelling Variations\n\nAndersen, Anderson, Andersone, Andersonne, Andersoun, Andersoune, Andersson, Andirsoone, Andirsoune, Andirston, Andison, Andreson, Andresoun, Andrewson, Androson,\n\nAndrosone, Androsoune, Andrson, Andyrson, Endherson, Endirsone, Andreu, MacGhilleAndrais\n\nEarly Marriage Records for Anderson\n\nDavid Anderson married Hannah Philips January 5, 1699 in Boston, Massachusetts\n\nGeorge Anderson married Elizabeth Stevenson June 26, 1693 in New York\n\nWilliam Andersen married Deborah Lyndell October 7, 1697 in New York\n\nHenricus Anderson married Elizabetham Holyman February 10, 1550 in Saint Marys, Hanley Castle, Worchester, England\n\nJohn Anderson married Margaret Funtstone January 22, 1550 in Saint Stephan Coleman Street, London, England\n\nThomas Anderson married Francis Huntington November 5, 1610 in Pocklington, York, England\n\nAgnes Anderson married Richard Dobson November 30, 1598 in Spilsby, Lincoln, England\n\nElizabeth Anderson married John Pagg June 9, 1595 in Rye, Sussex, England\n\nThomas Anderson married Elizabeth Butler May 13, 1610 in Waltham, Lincoln, England\n\nWilliam Anderson married Dorothy Brisse 1600 in Edlington, Lincoln, England\n\nGeorge Anderson married Hester Bacheler 1591 in Rickmansworth, Hertford, England\n\nThomas Anderson married Francis Huntington November 5, 1610 in Pocklington, York, England\n\nAnne Anderson married William Davison July 1607 in Ryton, Durham, England\n\nIsabell Anderson married Willyam Couertaye April 27, 1609 in Bourne, Lincoln, England\n\nWilliam Anderson married Elsabethe Darnell November 30, 1608 in Revesby, Lincoln, England\n\nFraunces Anderson married Robert Needam June 12, 1606 in Saint Mary The Virgin Aldermanbury, London, England\n\nAgnes Anderson married George Clarckson January 29, 1592 in Saint Nicholas Parish Reg and Nonconf, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Northumberland, England\n\nPopularity & Geographic Distribution\n\nThe last name Anderson ranks 365thin popularity worldwide as of the 2014 Census and approximately 1,392,936 people carry the Anderson surname worldwide.

Little is certainly known about him; but the year 1582 is assigned as that of his birth on the authority of a print representing him in 1617 as of the age of thirty-five. He taught mathematics in Paris early in the seventeenth century, and appears to have been a friend of Vieta, who died in 1603, and whose posthumous writings he edited with great ability, developing much that was only indicated, and demonstrating much that was barely stated. He alludes more than once to the poverty of his circumstances; abstruse studies and the neglect of common and easy life brought him, he tells us, more wisdom than riches (Vindiciae Archimedis, Dedication). He is not heard of after 1619, the date of his last publication, and is accordingly believed to have died about that time. The celebrated James Gregory was, on the mother’s side, connected with his family. A couple of his works are: 1. ‘Supplementum Apollonii Redivivi,’ Paris, 1612, in which he displays a remarkable command of the ancient analysis and supplies the deficiencies in Ghetaldi attempted restoration of the lost book of Apollonius. 2. ‘Francisci Vietae de Equationum recognitione et emendatione tractatus duo,’ Paris 1615, contain Vieta’s improvements in the transformation and reduction of algebraical equations, with an appendix by Anderson, showing that the solution of cubic equations can be made to depend upon the trisection of an angle.\n\nANDERSON, SIR EDMUND (1580-1605), lord chief justice of the court of Common Pleas, was descended from a Scotch family which, after a long settlement in Northumberland, migrated to Lincolnshire, and was born in 1530 at Flixborough or Broughton, in the latter county. After spending a short time at Lincoln College, Oxford, Anderson became in June 1550 a student of the Inner Temple, and ‘by indefatigable study’, says Anthony a Wood, ‘obtained great knowledge of laws.’ In 1567 he was appointed both Lent and Summer ‘reader’ at his inn of court, and a reference to him in Plowden’s reports of the chief contemporary cases proves him to have acquired a considerable practice before 1571. Three years later he was nominated ‘double reader’ at the Inner Temple, and in Michaelmas term, 1577, he became a serjeant-at-law. In 1579 he was advanced to the highest dignity attainable at the bar, that of serjeant-at-law to the queen. As an assistant judge on circuit, Anderson began to exercise judicial functions soon after this promotion, and in 1581 he conducted cases of importance in both the eastern and western counties. At Bury, in the Norfolk circuit, Robert Brown, the founder of the sect of Brownists or Independents, was brought before him on a charge of nonconformity, and in sentencing him to a term of imprisonment Anderson emphatically expressed his intention, fully carried out in his subsequent judicial career, of upholding the Establishment against puritan dissent by every means in his power. On the western circuit, in November of the same year, Anderson presided at the trial of Campion and other seminary priests, charged with ‘compassing and imagining the queen’s death’, and here, as in many similar cases with which he was connected, he assumed an attitude of personal hostility to the prisoners. The evidence adduced against Campion and his followers was somewhat slender, but the judge in an introductory speech ‘with grave and austere countenance dismayed the prisoners,’ and secured their conviction by his rhetorical invective. Anderson’s vigorous support of the crown’s authority against its various opponents did not go unrewarded. The Bishop of Norwich requested Lord Burghley to call the queen’s attention to his energy in the conviction of Brown, and the government showed themselves grateful for his action towards the catholic conspirators. Soon after the death of Sir James Dyer, the lord chief justice of the Common Pleas, Anderson was promoted to the vacant office, and he took his seat on the bench on 2 May 1582, receiving at the same time the honour of knighthood. Fleetwood, the recorder of London, in a letter to Lord Burghley describing his investiture, writes in the highest terms of the learning and facility he displayed on that occasion in arguing some very difficult points of law, which were proposed for his decision by leading members of the bar.\n\nEarly American Immigration and New World Settlers\n\nAnderson Settlers in United States in the 17th, 18th, 19th & 20th Century\n\nJochem Anderson, who arrived in New York, NY in 1600\n\nHeinrich Anderson, who immigrated to Philadelphia in 1627\n\nThomas Anderson, who settled in Virginia in 1634\n\nJoseph Anderson and Richard Anderson in 1635\n\nJo Anderson, aged 20, who arrived in Virginia in 1635\n\nHannah Anderson, who arrived in Virginia in 1705\n\nEnoch Anderson, who landed in New Jersey in 1709\n\nJacob Anderson, who emigrated from England to New England in 1710\n\nDerrick Anderson, who landed in Virginia in 1714\n\nEdward Anderson, who landed in Virginia in 1717\n\nArchd Anderson, aged 19, who arrived in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1803\n\nJames Anderson, who arrived in America in 1804\n\nHenry Anderson, aged 46, who arrived in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1804\n\nGeorge Anderson, who landed in America in 1804\n\nCharles Anderson, who landed in America in 1805\n\nChris Anderson, who landed in Alaska in 1900\n\nHerman Anderson, who landed in Mississippi in 1900\n\nEliza J Anderson, who landed in Colorado in 1902\n\nFrank Anderson, who arrived in Arkansas in 1903\n\nChris C Anderson, who arrived in Mississippi in 1903\n\nAnderson Settlers in Canada in the 18th, 19th Century\n\nEdward Anderson, who arrived in Nova Scotia in 1749\n\nJames Anderson, who landed in Nova Scotia in 1749\n\nJohn and William Anderson, who immigrated to Newfoundland in 1763\n\nElizabeth Anderson, aged 36, who landed in Fort Cumberland, Nova Scotia in 1775\n\nMr. Alex Anderson U.E., United Empire Loyalist who settled in Home District, South Central Ontario c. 1783\n\nAlexander Anderson and his wife Isobel, who emigrated from Scotland to Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island in 1808 with their children James, Ann, Christina, and Isobel\n\nWilliam Anderson, aged 28, who landed in Canada in 1811\n\nWilliam Anderson, aged 28, who arrived in Canada in 1811\n\nWilliam Anderson, aged 37, a gardener, who arrived in Quebec aboard the ship “Atlas” in 1815\n\nAnn Anderson, aged 36, who arrived in Quebec aboard the ship “Atlas” in 1815\n\nAnderson Settlers in Australia in the 19th Century\n\nThomas Anderson, English convict from Middlesex, who was transported aboard the “Ann” on August 1809, settling in New South Wales, Australia\n\nPeter Anderson, English convict from Sussex, who was transported aboard the “Asia” on April 1st, 1822, settling in New South Wales, Australia\n\nJohn Anderson, English convict from Leicester, who was transported aboard the “Asia” on July 29th, 1823, settling in Van Diemen’s Land, Australia\n\nJohn Anderson, a carpenter, who arrived in Van Diemen’s Land (now Tasmania) sometime between 1825 and 1832\n\nHugh Anderson, a bricklayer, who arrived in Van Diemen’s Land (now Tasmania) sometime between 1825 and 1832\n\nAnderson Settlers in New Zealand in the 19th Century\n\nMr. James Anderson, Australian settler travelling from Hobart, Tasmania, Australia aboard the ship “Bee” arriving in New Zealand in 1831 [9]\n\nMr. Jacob Anderson, Australian settler travelling from Hobart, Tasmania, Australia aboard the ship “Bee” arriving in New Zealand in 1832 [9]\n\nJ Anderson, who landed in Hokianga, New Zealand in 1839\n\nArchibald Anderson, who landed in Wellington, New Zealand in 1840 aboard the ship Bengal\n\nMottoes\n\nDum spiro spero While I breathe, I hope\n\nFortiter et recti.
