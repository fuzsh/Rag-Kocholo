Addresses are given as shown in the military and other records.\n\nJohn Edwin, Jacques 1923 - 1941;\n\nBorn between October and December 1923. Registered at Alton, Hampshire.\n\nEnlisted unknown date.\n\nRoyal Navy.\n\nRank: Ordinary Seaman.\n\nService No: P/JX 160599.\n\nJohn served aboard H.M.S Dunedin.\n\nKilled In Action on the 24th of November 1941, aged 18.\n\nH.M.S Dunedin, a light cruiser, of the 1st Cruiser Squadron, left England for the final time in April 1941, where she was stationed in the South Atlantic. She took part in a joint operation with the aircraft carrier H.M.S. Eagle, tasked with searching for German supply ships. The German fleet oiler Lothringen was spotted by Swordfish aircraft from Eagle and Dunedin with one boiler out of action, steamed as fast as she could to make the interception. Dunedin found the Lothringen badly damaged from the Swordfish attacks but still afloat. A boarding party sailed the ship to Bermuda as the German Merchant Navy crew members had refused to scuttle her. Important Enigma material was later found where it had fallen behind a filing cabinet in the wireless room. The tanker was repaired and then used by the Royal Navy as fleet oiler Empire Salvage.\n\nH.M.S Dunedin then spent the next few months sailing the South Atlantic, calling in at Freetown, Sierra Leone, St Helena and Bathurst. In November 1941 The Admiralty through intelligence gained from Enigma, learned that four U-boats, an armed merchant raider and a supply ship, were to attack Allied shipping near to Cape Town, South Africa. Dunedin along with H.M.S. Devonshire and H.M.S. Dorset shire were ordered to independently track and intercept them.\n\nOn the 22nd of November Devonshire came upon U-126 and the armed raider Atlantis and attacked. She sunk Atlantis but stayed out of range of U-126, and reported survivors in the water. On the 24th of November the supply ship Python came to help U-126 which was towing survivors towards South America. On the afternoon of the same day U-124, commanded by Jochen Mohr, was to rendezvous with the Python. Near St Paul’s Rocks, 900 miles west of Freetown, just south of the Equator, Mohr sighted Dunedin to his north east sailing a zigzag course at 17 knots. U-124 raced ahead of Dunedin's path and dived for the attack. The lookouts on the cruiser saw the periscope at 14.50 hours and changed course to chase the U-boat, but the course of the U-boat was misinterpreted so the Dunedin sailed away from U-124. The approaching U-124 suddenly came to the surface for a brief moment, but remained unseen. The forward hydroplanes jammed and the crew had trouble to get the boat under control. As Mohr was able to see through his periscope again the cruiser was not in sight, but then he spotted the vessel at a range of over three miles, which was now well past of a favourable attack range. Mohr decided to fire a spread of three torpedoes at 15.21 hours. After 5 minutes and 23 seconds, two torpedoes struck the cruiser, which rolled first to port then to starboard before sinking stern first after 17 minutes. The first torpedo struck amidships and wrecked the main wireless station. The second torpedo struck further aft, probably near the quarters of the officers, dismounting the after 6in gun and blowing away the starboard screw. About 250 survivors managed to leave the ship by jumping overboard. They rescued themselves onto seven Carley floats and floating debris. The U-boat surfaced and circled the survivors for about ten minutes but then left.\n\nOnly 72 survivors were still alive on the six floats found by the American steam merchant Nishmaha, en route from Takoradi to Philadelphia, three days after the sinking. Many survivors drowned, some died of their injuries, others died of exhaustion and some were bitten and killed by sharks. Five of the rescued men died before the merchant ship reached Trinidad, with only four officers and 63 ratings surviving the sinking.\n\nRemembered on the Portsmouth Naval Memorial.\n\nPanel Reference: Panel 50, Column 3.\n\nRemembered on the Camberley War Memorial.\n\nRemembered on the Lych Gate Memorial, St. Andrew's, Frimley Green, Surrey.\n\nSon of John H. and Lilian Jacques, of Frimley Green, Surrey.\n\nArthur William, James ? - 1943;\n\nI have not confirmed year of birth, family or connection to Camberley or Frimley area.\n\nEnlisted into the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, unknown date.\n\nService No: 158917.\n\nArthur trained to be a Pilot and was ranked as Flight Sergeant.\n\nPosted to No. 1663 Heavy Conversion Unit (H.C.U.) No. 7 Group, Training Command at R.A.F. Rufforth, Yorkshire, unknown date.\n\nOn the 17th/18th of June 1943, Arthur was aboard Halifax Mark V Registration DG421 from No. 1663 H.C.U.,on a training flight for night circuits and landings, that crash landed at R.A.F Pocklington, Yorkshire. The aircraft sustained extensive damage and was a write off but all crew members escaped and survived the crash.\n\nWith the introduction of new heavy bombers, the four-engine Short Stirling, Avro Lancaster and Handley Page Halifax, the Royal Air Force introduced heavy conversion units (H.C.U.). The heavy conversion units began forming in late 1941, to qualify crews trained on medium bombers to operate the heavy bombers before final posting to the operational squadrons. Some of the heavy conversion units were involved in bombing operations over Germany.\n\nCommissioned as a Pilot Officer (On probation) on the 30th of September 1943. Published in the London Gazette on the 30th of November 1943. Supplement 36267, Page 5245.\n\nPosted to No. 51 Squadron R.A.F. based at R.A.F. Snaith, Yorkshire, unknown date.\n\nKilled In Action on the 9th of October 1943.\n\nOn 8 October 1943 Arthur was the pilot of Halifax JN885 coded MH-A which took off at 10.42 pm from R.A.F. Snaith in Yorkshire on a raid to Hannover. In total 504 aircraft - 282 Lancasters, 188 Halifaxes, 26 Wellingtons, 8 Mosquitos, were sent to the city. The German controller guessed correctly that Hannover was the target and many night fighters arrived before the attack was over. A total of 27 aircraft - 14 Lancasters and 13 Halifaxes - were lost, 5.4 per cent of the force. Conditions over Hannover were clear and the Pathfinders were finally able to mark the centre of the city accurately; a most concentrated attack followed with a creep back of only 2 miles, all within the built-up area. This was probably Hannover's worst attack of the war. JN885 was one of two 51 Squadron Halifaxes lost on this operation. It crashed at 1.10 am between the communities of Kieselhorst and Beckeln, Germany, although the cause of loss has not been established.\n\nBuried at Rheinberg War Cemetery, Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany.\n\nGrave Reference: Joint grave 17. G. 17-18.\n\nRemembered on the Camberley War Memorial.\n\nHerbert Frederick, Jennings 1910 - 1941;\n\nBorn on the 10th of July 1910 at Frimley, Surrey.\n\nEmployed as a Ledger Clerk by Drake & Mount, 92 High Street, Camberley, Surrey. Employed from the 24th of January 1927 until September 1928.\n\nEnlisted into the Royal Air Force on the 3rd of September 1928.\n\nRank: Aircraftman 2nd Class.\n\nService: 509138.\n\nPosted to Training Depot Squadron on the 3rd of September 1928.\n\nPromoted to Aircraftman First Class, unknown date.\n\nPromoted to Sergeant, unknown date.\n\nTrade: Wireless Operator/Air Gunner.\n\nPosted to No.58 Squadron, unknown date.\n\nNo. 58 Squadron was flying Armstrong Whitworth Whitley Bombers from Yorkshire at the outbreak of the Second World War, and first went into action on the night of 3rd/4th September, 1939, when - in conjunction with No. 51 Squadron - it made a leaflet raid over Germany. This was the first occasion on which R.A.F aircraft penetrated into Germany during the Second World War.\n\nA few weeks after this operation No. 58 was ordered to an airfield in South-West England for duty with Coastal Command and until late January, 1940, it was employed on escorting convoys and flying anti-submarine patrols. The squadron returned to Yorkshire in February and from April, 1940 to March, 1942, played a prominent part in the night-bombing offensive. Its targets were of the widest variety, from airfields, road and railway communications, marshalling yards and industrial centres, to the Channel Ports, oil and petrol installations and shipping at sea.\n\nOn the 23rd of December 1940, Herbert as Wireless Operator/Air Gunner and crew were tasked with bombing Boulogne, France. Whitley (with serial P5098) took off from R.A.F. Linton-on-Ouse, Yorkshire at 5.25 pm. One hour into the flight, the crew encountered technical problems with some instruments and decided to return to his base. After touchdown, the aircraft went out of control, veered off runway and collided with a parked Westland Lysander. An explosion occurred and both aircraft were destroyed. Herbert and 3 other members of the crew were wounded but managed to escape the burning aircraft but unfortunately the tail gunner was killed.\n\nKilled In Action on the 3rd of March 1941, aged 29.\n\nHerbert and crew flew aboard Armstrong Whitworth Whitley (type V, with serial Z6465 and code GE-U) taking off at 6.05 pm from R.A.F. Linton-on-Ouse, Yorkshire for a bombing mission to Brest, France. The main target was the cruiser 'Hipper'. At 11.50 pm a messaged was received over wireless transmission indicating that the sortie had been abandoned. Crashed at 1.56 am and burst into flames 3 miles north east of Ternhill, Shropshire, killing the entire crew.\n\nBuried at St. Peter's, Frimley, Surrey, on the 10th of March 1941.\n\nGrave Reference: Grave 764.\n\nSon of Fredrick and Ellen Jennings, of 16 Frimley Road, Camberley, Surrey.\n\nAlexander Percival, Johnson D.S.O. 1912 - 1944;\n\nKnown as Johnny Johnson.\n\nBorn between July and September 1911. Registered at Maidenhead, Berkshire.\n\nEducated as a Gentleman Cadet at the Royal Military College Sandhurst.\n\nCommissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant Suffolk Regiment, on the 27th of August 1931. Published in the London Gazette on the 28th of August 1931. Issue 33748, Page 5623.\n\nPromoted to Lieutenant Suffolk Regiment on the 27th of August 1934. Published in the London Gazette on the 28th of August 1934. Issue 34082, Page 5461.\n\nPosted to India, unknown date.\n\nAlexander married Jeanne Helene Irvine at Colaba, Bombay, India, 1937.\n\nPromoted to Captain Suffolk Regiment on the 27th of August 1939. Published in the London Gazette on the 29th of August 1939. Issue 34660, Page 5971.\n\nAppointed Commanding Officer 12th (Yorkshire) Parachute Battalion (was 10th Bn. The Green Howards), Parachute Regiment. Part of the 5th Parachute Brigade, 6th Airborne Division.\n\nParachuted into Normandy, France on D-Day, 6th of June 1944 during Operation Tonga, during the wider Operation Overlord.\n\nKilled In Action on the 12th of June 1944, aged 32.\n\nWhen Alexander parachuted into Normandy on the 6th June, he was the first man to arrive at his Battalion's rendezvous, but like all of the parachute battalion commanders of the 6th Airborne Division, after several hours of waiting at the rendezvous a less than satisfactory number of his men had presented themselves, and so he was therefore faced with the dilemma of whether to advance to secure his objective or wait for more men to present themselves on the drop zone. The 12th Battalion had, in fact, been more successful than most in assembling their men as 60% of their strength was accounted for by 2.30 am, and so Alexander, who was aware that it was vital that his men should secure the ridge south of Le Bas de Ranville before dawn, ordered the advance. In the event the Battalion met no resistance on the way and they began to take up positions along the ridge at 4.00 am.\n\nThe 12th Battalion formed a defensive line south of the bridge at Ranville. On the 6th and 7th of June, the battalion defended the bridgehead against attacks by the German 21st Panzer Division moving north from Caen. Many casualties were caused by heavy fire from enemy machine guns, mortars, artillery, self-propelled guns, and tanks.\n\nOn the 12th June 1944, after spending several days in the Divisional Reserve, Alexander received orders personally from Major-General Gale to prepare the Battalion for an attack on Bréville that night. Out of necessity, it was a hastily improvised operation, so much so that Johnson had only two hours to brief his men and lead them to the start line for their advance, at Amfreville. Attached to the greatly understrength 12th Battalion was \"D\" Company of the 12th Devonshires, however by the time that Alexander had arrived at the start line with his men, with only moments to spare before the Allied artillery barrage began, he had not been able to talk with the Devons' commander about the plan that he proposed as they had yet to arrive. Alexander decided to attack along a single company front, with \"C\" Company leading the way to secure the crossroads and the southern area of the village, then for \"A\" Company to pass through them and secure the south-eastern sector, the Devons were then to follow and capture the north-east, and finally the 12th Battalion's \"B\" Company would advance and deal with the western area.\n\nThe attack was a success, but the two leading companies of the 12th Battalion and the Devons suffered particularly terribly as a result of enemy small arms and artillery fire. Amongst the dead was Lieutenant-Colonel Johnson himself, however he was a victim of friendly fire. An artillery shell, believed to have been fired from a gun of the 51st Highland Division, fell short of Bréville, just as the attack began, and killed Johnson. He had been standing with a group of senior officers who had gathered to witness the assault, and the explosion that killed him also seriously wounded Brigadiers The Lord Lovat and Hugh Kindersley.\n\nAwarded the Distinguished Service Order, back dated to the 11th of June 1944. Published in the London Gazette on the 29th of August 1944. Supplement 36679, Page 4045.\n\n\"Major (temporary Lieutenant-Colonel) Alexander Percival Johnson (52653), The Suffolk Regiment\n\n(since killed in action) (to be dated 11th June1944)\".\n\nHis citation reads:\n\n\"Lieutenant-Colonel Johnson landed with his Battalion by parachute behind the enemy lines on the 6th June 1944. His Battalion held the Eastern approaches to the Benouville bridgehead throughout the 6th June in the face of repeated attacks by enemy self-propelled guns and infantry in superior strength. His courage leadership and skill were an inspiration to the remainder of his Battalion and his task was successfully accomplished.\n\nOn the 7th June, Lieutenant-Colonel Johnson's Battalion held its ground against more attacks by infantry with self-propelled guns in support. The assaults were pressed at point blank range and in some places penetrated into his position. Lieutenant-Colonel Johnson's brilliant handling of his Battalion, his coolness under fire was directly responsible for the successful defence of the position as a whole and to the final reoccupation of our original line.\"\n\nBuried at Ranville War Cemetery,Ranville, Calvados, France.\n\nGrave Reference: IVA.

Registered at Battersea, London.\n\nLionel served with No.297 Squadron R.A.F. based at R.A.F. Stoney Cross, New Forest, Hampshire.\n\nNo. 297 Squadron was originally formed as the Parachute Exercise Squadron at R.A.F. Ringway on the 15th of December 1941 and moved to R.A.F. Netheravon on 22 January 1942, then officially becoming No 297 Squadron R.A.F. The squadron moved to R.A.F. Station Stoney Cross on the 25th August 1943, where they practised parachute drops with the 8th Battalion parachute regiment and 22 Independent Parachute regiment in preparation for the D-Day invasion.\n\nKilled In Training on the 21st of December 1943, aged 24.\n\nThe Albemarle aircraft that Lionel was navigator aboard was taking part in training operation \"Try Again\" when they crashed into a hillside in bad weather.\n\nThe Station flying log report stated;\n\n\"The first aircraft of 297 squadron was to drop at 03:00 hrs and the other aircraft at 2 minute intervals. The weather conditions were far from ideal - there were a number of shower clouds about - but despite this, the exercise was carried out and quite successfully considering the conditions. The moon was obscured by cloud and the navigators had difficulty pin-pointing their position. Unfortunately, one aircraft pilot Flight Sgt. Jubb crashed when making the run to rendezvous (Ludgershall) at a position where there was low cloud. Of the six R.A.F. personnel, all were killed outright except one who was critically injured, and eight of the ten paratroopers carried were killed, the remaining two being badly injured. Upon returning to base, the 4th aircraft crash landed on the runway, with the result that the runway had to be changed and the last aircraft did not land until almost 05:00 hours. Consequently 110 troops of the 8th Parachute battalion were dropped in the drop zone as well as 10 of the independent parachute company. Night time flying 25.40 hours.\n\nThe Operations log for R.A.F. Stoney Cross records:\n\n\"21.12 One of the Albemarle aircraft of 297 squadron crashed into a hillside while taking part in Exercise \"Try Again\". Five members of the crew, Flight Sgt.
