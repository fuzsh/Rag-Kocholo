        "text": "JCR-UK is a genealogical and historical website covering all Jewish communities and\n\ncongregations throughout the British Isles and Gibraltar, both past and present.\n\nTown of Macclesfield, Cheshire\n\nMacclesfield (population 50,000), a town in north-west England close to the border of Greater Manchester, is situated on the river Bollin, a tributary of the river Mersey. Bollington (population 8,000) is a village situated some 4 miles northeast of Macclesfield.\n\nSince 1 April 2009, Macclesfield has been part of Cheshire East, a unitary authority with borough status within the now purely ceremonial county of Cheshire. From 1974 to 2009, Macclesfield (which during such period included the town of Wilmslow) was a local government district and borough in Cheshire. Prior to 1974, Macclesfield was a municipal borough within the county of Cheshire.\n\n62 Chestergate, which housed the former Macclesfield Synagogue on the second floor\n\n(from the cover of \"Macclesfield's Jews and World War Two\" - © Basil Jeuda)\n\nMacclesfield Jewish Community\n\nAlthough there were a few Jewish families living in the Macclesfield area prior to World War II,(i) there was no organised community. With the outbreak of war, Jewish evacuees from London and other built-up areas began to settle in Macclesfield and, to a lesser extent, in near-by Bollington and Wilmslow, supplemented by Jewish refugees from Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia and Belgium, fleeing Nazi persecution.(ii) This lead to the establishment of an organised community in Macclesfield, as well as in Wilmslow (see separately). Within twelve months following the end of the war, most of the newcomers had returned to London and elsewhere, although a few remained.\n\nFrom March to May 2016 the town hosted 'Celebrating Jewish Life, Art and Enterprise in Macclesfield During World War Two - an exhibition which commemorated the 75th anniversary of the opening of the Macclesfield Synagogue at 62 Chestergate, now Charles Roe House, where the exhibition was held. The late Basil Jeuda was curator of the exhibition and author of the accompanying book, Macclesfield's Jews in World War Two.\n\nList of United Synagogue Congregations (and Membership Groups)\n\nWorld War II Evacuee Communities\n\nJewish Congregations in Cheshire\n\nJewish Communities of England homepage\n\nPage created: 10 November 2006\n\nData significantly expanded: 29 January 2016\n\nData further significantly expanded and notes first added: 25 November 2021\n\nPage most recently amended: 12 December 2023\n\nResearch by David Shulman, assisted by Steven Jaffe\n\nFormatting by David Shulman\n\nExplanation of Terms | About JCR-UK | JCR-UK home page\n\nContact JCR-UK Webmaster:\n\njcr-ukwebmaster@jgsgb.org.uk\n\nTerms and Conditions, Licenses and Restrictions for the use of this website:\n\nThis website is owned by JewishGen and the Jewish Genealogical Society of Great Britain.
