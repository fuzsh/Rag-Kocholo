        "text": "This weekend I spent time going back and forth listening to 3 audiobooks that I couldnt resist. My curiousity later turned into an obsession to complete them as much as I could. It all started with my recent discovery that I can borrow audio books using the libby app. And then I joined the mesa public library and borrowed 3 books. So how did I know what to read? Now, I got the inspiration to search for books similar to thinking fast and slow (a book I own and like) using the site https://lnkd.in/gH23caAG. It suggested a 100 books to choose from and I wasnt able to narrow them down. Then, I searched for recommendations by members to other members within my company (using our internal slack)! And so, I came up with these titles and I absolutely love them! They are - 1. The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg (7 days since borrowing and 53% listened to, with 11 hours of audio content) - a book on why habits exist, scientific discoveries and how they can be changed. It has a lot of stories that you can relate to. A must read or listen! 2. The subtle art of not giving a f*ck by Mark Manson (4 days, 13%, 5 hours content) - the title threw me off and I wasnt sure if I should seriously read it. As everything else, I gave it a try today and I am pleasantly surprised. It’s a book about making a conscious decision on what matters the most instead of caring about everything and hence failing at all of them. There’s more to it and I promise it’s not being inconsiderate but carefully paying attention and also knowing when not to! 3. Man’s search for meaning by Viktor E Frankl (7 days, 50% in, 5 hours content) - a chilling and yet inspirational story of Viktor’s struggle to hold on to hope during the horrors of life as a prisoner in the Nazi concentration camps. A book on how we cope with suffering, find meaning and move forward with renewed purpose. It intrigued me and now I want to listen more of it, till it’s end! Glad, I found these books to listen to. And it’s a good break from just technical stuff and more onto real life. If you enjoy reading, please share. What did you find inspiring? Love to listen -"
