        "text": "I was really afraid to fall at first, but now it is less of a problem, when you skateboard you kind of have to be fearless; you won’t learn if you don’t attempt the tricks. You will trial these tricks and you probably will fall. At first I was afraid to try tricks because I knew I was going to fall, but my instructor was like, ‘Sadie, you have to do it, you are not going to learn if you don’t try’. So I did and I wiped out, but I did learn in the end, so it’s OK. The first time I fell it was really embarrassing. I was skating up a\n\nhill in my neighbourhood and it was my first lesson. There was a neighbour outside her house and she watched me fall flat on my face. It hurt really bad, but I didn’t want to cry or anything like that. It hurt so bad, so I was a bit afraid of falling but I got over it.\n\nI have been vegan for two years, and it doesn’t seem like a long time for me. I was vegetarian for a year before that. I decided to go vegetarian when I was at this restaurant with my friend; there was\n\nthis buffet area and this whole roasted pig, and you could see everything. It was so gross. I was super grossed out by it and I realized that that was bacon, ham, pork, the stuff I was eating on a daily\n\nbasis, but now I was seeing the whole animal and I was totally grossed out. So I questioned bacon and other meat like that. That was when I made the connection, that meat was actual animals and\n\nwhat I was actually putting in my body. That was when I decided to cut out meat. I think a lot of people think that way, too. In America, eating meat is so normal, and people are blinded by what\n\nthey are eating. But when you can all of a sudden see the animal you are eating, people get grossed out. So that was what convinced me to become vegetarian.\n\nI grew up in Texas, where it’s all about barbecues. All my family ate meat, it was the normal thing, and I was blinded by that and thought eating meat was normal. I tried to go vegetarian earlier – I was 11 or 12 – and I did for a week, but then we had some family visit and they noticed I wasn’t eating meat and\n\nthey were like, ‘Hey, you’re not going vegetarian on us, are you?’ And I was like, ‘Oh shoot, am I weird now?’ So I quit, like, ‘This is weird! I have to eat meat!’ That was what prevented me from going vegetarian a bit earlier, but now veganism, and being vegetarian has become a very big topic and I think people are starting to understand it a little bit more. My family is totally 100-percent supportive of it. At first, they didn’t understand, but now they are really supportive and I think one of my brothers is vegetarian because of it, and my mum went vegan for a while. It is just nice to know I am inspiring others.\n\nWhen I was vegetarian but not vegan, my friends didn’t think it was too weird. But then one of my friends said, ‘You better not go vegan on us!’ I was like, ‘Vegan, no way, of course not, no way never’. Then a year later I did the movie with Woody Harrelson and there were actually three people on set who were vegan. I was surrounded by this new lifestyle and I was in this different place; I got this new perspective on what veganism actually is. It inspired me and I realized that veganism had been this weird thing, but it’s not the case any more. I watched documentaries, and I realized that it’s not just the meat industry hurting animals, it is also egg and dairy, and there are a lot of animal products that go into the foods you are eating that you don’t even realize. So I made the switch, and it was easy\n\nbecause I had already given up meat. I mean, it takes a while to get into it, and I always say if you are thinking about eating less meat and going vegan, going cold turkey is pretty hard. It works for some people, but I understand that not everyone can do it, especially in other countries where you have to eat meat to survive. But in America, we are given the choice, the opportunity, we get to choose what we eat a lot of the time. We have all these different options and resources. So yeah, if you can choose to eliminate meat, then go for it, but maybe just start with one day a week with no meat and then gradually increase these days as time goes on. It is all just what is right for your body.\n\nAt first, I went vegetarian and then vegan solely because of the animals. That is kind of the most obvious reason for me. People do it for health, a lot for the animals, but as you say, the environment is also another thing that is helped when you go vegan. A lot of people don’t know that and I didn’t either until I watched a documentary about it and then I was like, ‘Woah, now I’m even prouder to be a vegan!’ You know, a lot of people say to me, ‘Hey, you’re just one person, how much can you really be doing? How much can one person do just by going vegan?’ That upsets me because I have been told that a lot, like you are not helping anybody, and I am like, ‘No, I am’. I am inspiring others; I inspired my mum and my brother and a lot of my friends, and the more people you inspire the more change you make. And as far as the environment goes, people say, ‘I’m just one person, what can I do? Shorten my shower? Carpooling, recycling? How can these things do anything?’ But if everyone thinks that\n\nway, then nobody is going to get anywhere, and no change will be made.\n\nThe thing about being successful meaning you’re famous, I don’t think that is true. I personally feel like I am successful in other areas of life that don’t have anything to do with acting. I am a big sister; I am a daughter; I am a friend; I am more than just an actor. I have success in other areas of my life. I guess it is easy to make that connection between the two and think they are the same thing. Like, she has millions of followers on Instagram, she is successful. You could have 20 million followers on Instagram and lots of projects lined up, but if you’re not happy… Sure, you can have a successful career and that is great and will make people happy, but you need to find happiness and success in other areas of your life that don’t have to do with work. Does that make sense?\n\nI have a very different relationship with social media than other girls my age. Before I had a big following on social media, I would be on the app a lot even if I have never been that active with posts. I might post occasionally, not every single second in my day; I am a lot more private. I am all about\n\nbeing in the moment and experiencing things with your own eyes and not through the camera lens and having to take pictures of everything. Once I started to get a following on Instagram, it was great because it was like, wow, there are so many people who love the show and these fans are incredible. But it also opens the door to a lot of negativity and that can really mess with your head. So that’s why I avoid being on it a lot. I still have it and will post things that I want to share with my fans and I will comment on pictures, but I am not the kind of person who is just constantly scrolling through their feed, because then you get into this whole negativity and all this drama. I think for my mental clarity that I need to limit the negativity in my life. And I can be happy and productive if my head is clear. There is nothing worse than going to dinner with your friends or your family and you’re trying to make conversation and everyone’s head is just buried in their phones and you are just looking around. It happened to me once and all of my friends were like buried in their phones and I just looked around and I was like, ‘Wow, is this really what it has come to?’ I can’t even talk to my friends! It is important\n\nto take a break and step back. It is not just because of all of the followers and all the stuff like that, that I have this view on social media. I have always been like this. When I was 12, I lost my phone on a plane, and then I didn’t get a new one until I was like 13, not because my parents were mad at me for losing it, I just never got around to renewing it. I am fine without a phone. I lose my phone all my time; I let my batterie die. I like being without my phone; I think it is great to just be in the moment and really enjoy life through your own eyes and not your screen.\n\nThere are so many little moments in life I think you miss because you are looking at your phone and I think that people just need to realize that. I remember being on my phone once, and my little sister was like, ‘Sadie, Sadie, let’s go play, let’s do something fun’. I was on my phone and I was like, ‘Yeah, OK, in one second’. Then I thought, ‘Hold on, what am I doing?’ My little sister doesn’t own a phone; she is not glued to a screen like a lot of us are. And she has this like fresh perspective on everything. And I thought: ‘Yes, I am going to go outside with my sister and play and enjoy this beautiful day.’ So it is those kinds of moments that you miss when you are on your phone. That is why I put my phone down and go for days without it. It is refreshing to me. It is very important.\n\nI usually don’t read these types of books, but I just read Tina Fey’s Bossypants, and it is so good. I was laughing so hard; it is really funny. My favourites are The Great Gatsby, Of Mice and Men, and I started reading To Kill a Mockingbird, which is really good. I have read Shakespeare before, but I’m not going to lie, I got help from the Internet to translate a lot of the stuff though. Because honestly who can read Shakespeare? I can’t, I don’t know who can. I need a person who can read Shakespeare and translate it well. When I was younger I tried to read all these books, but I didn’t understand what they are saying. Now it takes me a while depending on what kind of book I am reading, the language they are using. So, for Shakespeare, I have read Julius Caesar and A Midsummer Night’s Dream, but yes it is hard. I kind of like classic books, they are more challenging to read, andthe stories are lot more interesting than the stories you find now. I used to be obsessed with The Hunger Games; that was a big deal for me.\n\nThat was fun, a whole new experience. Something I had never done before or had thought I would ever do. And nobody really prepares you for it. I just showed up and all these super-tall models were there and I had no idea what I was doing. But I got there and the energy kicked in and it was really, really fun. If you love fashion, which I do, it is really exciting just to be there and know the designer and how hard they have worked on the collection, and how special it is to watch them bring their creations to life and to see it for the first time. It is a really special experience. I hadn’t understood it before, but now I do; it was one of the best times I’ve ever had.\n\nI don’t think there is one person who has all the qualities that I admire, like in one person. I see different people with different beliefs and qualities that I look up to. And I just like to combine\n\nall of those and I can make my own role model. What makes a good role model is when people use their platform to speak up for what they believe in and use their platform for good. I don’t think you have to be an adult to be a role model. I think that kids think their role models have to be their age or older and like I said before, I see my little sister and I look up to her creativity and how she sees the world with a fresh perspective without any judgement. That is a role-model quality. Also, with social\n\nmedia, people can make themselves seem one way, but in reality they might not be that way. So you can make yourself look one way on social media, but you know in reality, you could really be a bad person. People should be careful because not everyone is how they seem. And you shouldn’t try to replicate your role model either because if everybody was striving to be like someone else then there wouldn’t be any unique people in the world."
