        "text": "This answer contains spoilers… (view spoiler)[He was a vindictive, egotistical monster, and didn't take Sadie's rejection well at all, so he wanted revenge, or he tried to force himself onto \"Sadie\" when it was Sarah. When Sarah rejected him as well, he must have gotten angry and lashed out and killed her (either intentionally or unintentionally), and thus gave him his lust for young, homecoming Queen girls, and the tendency of killing them. The reason Ellery didn't say anything to anyone for Peter doing this, even when his answer was a confession, \"I thought she was your mother.\", she didn't want to devastate her family and mostly her mother, for fear of her backsliding in her recovery, and this feeling even more guilty for her sister's death. Ellery figured it would cause more damage than mending at this point. Although it's a pity that they won't know what he did with her body or how he killed her, he'd most likely not confessed to it anyways.\n\nAs the book ended on the note, some things are best left unsaid. (hide spoiler)]\n\nThis answer contains spoilers… (view spoiler)[Presumably, as the other answers mentioned, Peter didn't take kindly to being one in a casual string of Sadie's boyfriends. Definitely goes against the controlling personality we know he has as an adult.\n\nWhat I can't figure out is how Peter could possibly mix up Sadie and Sarah, especially on the night of homecoming! The election of the homecoming court is basically a spectator sport, so it just isn't reasonable that Peter wouldn't have known that Sadie was Queen. How could he ever think that social Sadie (partying it up at homecoming with her date) could have left the dance, slipped out of her gown, and visited the LIBRARY (where it's mentioned Sarah was walking home from when she was abducted)? It seems that he must have just happened upon Sarah. I can't fathom how he could've thought, from all the aforementioned context, that this was Sadie. (hide spoiler)]"
