        "text": "Happy Monday, readers. I’ve been in a reading funk for awhile–I got to the middle of a couple books (Good Omens and Code Name Verity) before losing interest and putting them back on my shelf. Then, two days ago, I got Sadie, stayed up until 1:00 AM getting as far as I could, and polished it off yesterday morning.\n\nY’all. I am about to scream about this book. Get ready.\n\nWhat’s the plot?: Girls go missing all the time.\n\nThat’s what West McCray, a New York City radio host, tells his boss when he starts investigating ninteen-year-old Sadie Hunter’s disappearance for a true crime podcast. He knows there won’t be a story there–he wants something new, exciting, fresh. But when he arrives in the small town Cold Creek, Colorado, and starts following her trail, he begins to realize that there’s something big here–something more sinister than he thought.\n\nSadie Hunter is going to kill a man. Oblivious to the fact that her disappearance will soon become the center of a hit podcast, she leaves behind the Cold Creek trailer park she’s lived in all her life in search of the man who murdered her little sister, Mattie. A girl with revenge in her heart and a switchblade in her pocket–what could possibly go wrong?\n\nPart podcast transcript, part road trip story, Sadie is a haunting, heart-pounding exploration of sisterhood, trauma, and the lengths we’ll go to for the ones we love.\n\nMy thoughts: My heart is racing as I type this because there’s so much I want to say about this book. It’s so good that there’s absolutely no way I’ll be able to capture its magnificence in this review, so please, please read it for yourself.\n\nWhere to start?\n\nThe format of Sadie is interesting–part of it is transcripts from the podcast that’s eventually made about Sadie’s disappearance, called The Girls, with West McCray interviewing the people that encountered her and following her trail. The other parts are first-person narration from Sadie’s perspective as she hunts for her sister’s murderer.\n\nI’ll admit that I was skeptical of the format at first–I’m typically not a fan of mixed-media books, with newspaper clippings and interviews interspersed throughout. But it works. It really, really works.\n\nMost of the reason it works is because you get a deep sense of the character of West, as well as his frequent interviewees, like May Beth Foster (the sisters’ surrogate grandmother) and Claire (their mother). Just like Sadie grows and changes, so do they, even without the reader getting a glimpse into what’s going on inside their heads. The dialogue is so masterful and painfully real–stumbling, halting, reluctant. People get choked up, cut themselves off in the middle of a sentence.\n\nCourtney Summers has said in interviews that part of the reason she wrote about true crime podcasts was because she was “thinking about how true crime is a genre devoted to justice, to the search for truth, but at the same time, it’s hard not to wonder how well we’re serving the narratives of people who aren’t around to speak for themselves. On top of that, so many true crime stories feature violence against women and girls. That’s the heart of those stories…So, I wondered, what is the impact? What does it mean when these kinds of stories are so consumable? What are the potential consequences?”\n\nThis theme (the consequences of telling the stories of people who can’t explain their side) resonates throughout the book–we, as the reader of both sides, know what really happened; but when interviewed, many people cast Sadie in an unfavorable light, turning her into a madwoman in the eyes of the people who only listen to the podcast. It’s frustrating and even scary when you realize the real danger that Sadie is in if this is the narrative that’s put out about her. Eventually, West discovers a more accurate version of her story, but even that doesn’t quite capture her full character and motivations. While no questions about the ethics of true crime are ever really completely answered, it compels the reader to wonder about the impact of consuming these stories, especially when it comes at the expense of a full, accurate narrative for the sake of drama.\n\nMoving on to Sadie’s side of the story. Her narration is something else. Just…something else. It’s really something special to find an author like Summers–though her teen characters may not be philosophical like John Green’s or quite as achingly relatable as Adam Silvera’s, they’re completely and utterly believable. Even Sadie’s improbable circumstances (I mean, she’s on a road trip to kill her sister’s murderer, for heaven’s sake) makes sense to the reader when Sadie tells it–of course she would do this, of course she would say that. And that is incredibly hard to do, to make a character seem alive and real in every single moment. (I’m explaining this terribly. My apologies. READ THE BOOK.)\n\nThere’s another really interesting facet to our main character–Sadie has a stutter that she’s never outgrown. Every line of her dialogue, unless she’s by herself, is written with a lot of dashes and repeated letters. Now, y’all know disabled rep is right up my alley, so rejoice when I say that Courtney Summers pulled it off. I repeat: she pulled! it! off! (With the usual disclaimer that I do not, and never will, speak for all disabled people, and if y’all have a different view on this, lmk in the comments and I’ll update the post.)\n\nFor one thing, it’s not something that’s part of Sadie’s character arc–she doesn’t “overcome” it in the end, and it’s not framed as something that’s ruining her life. I mean, it makes it difficult for her to communicate and forces her to come up with new ways to get her point across (+1 point for portraying a disabled character trying to accommodate themself in an able-bodied world), but mostly, it’s just there–you know, like a disability is.\n\nAnother thing that’s really accurate–she gets a lot of either intentionally rude or ignorant comments about her stutter. “So do you do it because you’re nervous? I don’t get it,” says one girl. (At this, Sadie “bite[s] back the urge to tell her it doesn’t matter if she f*cking gets it” and bravo Courtney Summers for understanding, hallelujah.) “Should you–I mean, can you drive?” asks a woman who’s about to sell Sadie her car. “If you’ve been drinking, you know I can’t just let you drive outta here,” says someone else, mistaking her stutter for slurring.\n\nShe’s also subject to the non-verbal reactions of other people–grimaces, widened eyes, not knowing what to say. They’re reactions that are relatable to any disabled person, that moment where people aren’t quite sure what to do with you. Though they’re not intentional, it makes for an awkward start to a conversation, something Summers captures really well.\n\nBut I was most surprised by the descriptions of Sadie’s intense anger about these comments. Though she only voices her irritation some of the time, that frustration is always there, simmering. Rarely do we get to see disabled characters’ emotional reactions to this kind of everyday ableism that pervades our lives. (I mean, rarely do we get disabled characters at all, but still.) I’ve been praised for my graciousness in answering invasive and personal questions about my disability when all I really want to do is pull out a passive-aggressive PowerPoint about why what’s coming out of their mouths is offensive. I don’t think able-bodied people often consider the emotional toll their questions take, or interrogate exactly why they feel entitled to our life stories for their edification. Sadie, much like it prompts questions about the ethics of true crime, also inspires self-reflection on how we treat disabled people not institutionally, but in our day-to-day lives.\n\nThis is actually kind of a funny time to be writing about this because yesterday, I was told (very sweetly) by a (very well-meaning) woman that my deaf accent was better than most deaf people she knew, and that I talked “very normally, which is good.” Obviously, I don’t have a speech impediment as severe as Sadie’s, but I do lisp and slur my words together quite a bit. A lot of the comments Sadie is subject to are familiar to me, and I was relieved that rather than letting them go unaddressed, Summers uses them to do basically a crash course on what questions not to ask disabled people.\n\nI know that was a lot of paragraphs about a stutter, but this is my book blog and I make the rules. (I tried to insert a “deal with it” GIF here, but all of them were so painfully mid-2000s that I decided to spare you.)\n\nStory-wise, Sadie is a tightly-plotted, gut-wrenching, heart-pounding [insert pretty much any noun-gerund pair here] thriller. The pacing is perfect–it lingers in all the right places, but for the most part, it’s a fast-paced whirlwind. Sadie is also a mystery, but not in the way you might expect.\n\nLet me explain. I initially thought the story was going to be about Sadie following a trail of clues to find out who killed her sister. It turns out that she knows who did it from the get-go–a man she knew as Keith, one of her mother’s boyfriends. Sadie’s side of things is relatively mystery-free–it’s about her finding him rather than trying to figure out whodunit, a smart choice that leaves more room for a character-centric story. West’s perspective is where the real mystery is as he tries to answer one question: Sadie disappeared five months ago and counting–so where is she now?\n\nAnother thing I wasn’t expecting, though I probably should’ve, considering it’s about a girl trying to kill the man who killed her sister: Sadie is deeply, intensely upsetting. I had to put the book down a few times because I couldn’t see through my tears. Her road trip, while she’s oriented on her goal, also serves as a time for her to finally come to terms with–or at least feel–the weight of the trauma she’s experienced. Her mother was an addict before she abandoned her and Mattie; she had to raise Mattie even as their relationship became more and more fractured; and finally, her sister was murdered by the boyfriend that lived with them for a year when she was younger.\n\nBut the real beating heart of Sadie, and a threat that’s omnipresent and alive on each page, is sexual abuse. Sadie may use Keith murdering Mattie as her motive for trying to kill him, but she has her own history with him, one that doesn’t have the police coming to her doorstep but is no less violent. Her descriptions of his abuse, and the moments leading up to it, for the most part non-graphic, are quietly haunting–here she describes Keith putting his hand on her shoulder when he first came into her life at eleven years old:\n\nThe girl’s shoulders tense, every one of her muscles tightening at the feel of those calloused fingers against the barest parts of her body. She doesn’t say anything and she won’t say anything and I know why she won’t, why her tongue keeps itself quiet…She knows about the calm before the storm, a quiet building toward a greater chaos. Everything about this okay guy doesn’t fit quite so well into the landscape of their lives. He’s too sober, too concerned, too everywhere she thinks she’s alone. He’s too many other things she can’t put the words to, like the way he’s touching her right now, which is far more familiar than it has any right to be and more intimate than should be allowed.\n\nMuch like The Nowhere Girls, Sadie excels at describing these non-violent but all the same violating moments. The fear and hyperawareness she experiences are familiar to all too many girls who know the feeling of someone standing too close, breathing their air; the humiliation of looking away as someone’s eyes linger on them for longer than they should; the jarring realization that someone’s suddenly “everywhere she thinks she’s alone.”\n\nSexual violence touches every woman and girl in this book–whether through an actual experience with it, the threat of it, or their proximity to it. Remarkably, though, Summers manages to avoid sensationalizing it or using it simply as a plot device to move the story along. While sexual abuse does drive a good chunk of the plot, its aftereffects are never ignored and it is never treated flippantly or lazily.\n\nIt also raises questions (so many questions are raised over the course of this book and that’s good!) about where the all the “nice guys” fit into this. West, motel owner Joe, boyfriend Paul, and many others never abuse or assault anyone, but Summers forces us to ask: are they complicit anyway? How is West profiting from telling this story, and is he treating it with the depth and nuance it needs? Did Joe, though he never suspected something like sexual abuse, turn a blind eye to Keith’s suspicious activities? What about the well-meaning men, Summers asks, the ones who don’t laugh at gross jokes but don’t speak up either, who brush off the warning signs?\n\nWhen Claire asks West why exactly he’s looking for her daughter rather than caring for his own, he replies, “Well…having a daughter of my own has made me–”\n\n“Don’t even finish that sentence,” Claire interjects, taking on the question of what West is gaining, personally and financially, from this project. “You’re doing this because your daughter opened your eyes, is that it? Having a little girl makes you realize, what, there’s a whole big, bad dirty world out there? So now you’re going to try to save mine from it and pat yourself on the back for leaving it a little cleaner than it was?…You think you can take our pain, turn it into something for yourself. A show…I’ve been used by men my whole life, and if you want the truth, I don’t think you’re going to be any different.”\n\nIs there anything less than exceptional about this book? Initially, I thought about the relationship between the two sisters, Sadie and Mattie. Sadie reminded me a lot of another book about an older sister looking after a younger sister in less-than-ideal circumstances: Gem and Dixie by Sara Zarr, a quiet, understated story that addresses the various ways the adults around us can fail us and the bonds that bring us together anyway. The relationship between the titular sisters is so movingly drawn out, in all its complexity and fierce love, that I was somewhat underwhelmed by the description of the relationship between Sadie and Mattie, only talked about in-depth by May Beth or in passing by Sadie. But Gem and Dixie is a lot more slow-moving, and the stakes are much lower. I think Sadie would’ve been almost too overstuffed if it had anything more than what it does now, so I’m more than willing to let that nitpick go.\n\nAll through this book, my heart was in my throat and my breath was stoppered up (and also my back really hurt because I was reading in a weird position so I could maximize the light I got from my lamp). If Sadie isn’t a YA masterpiece, I’m not sure what is.\n\nGirls go missing all the time. That much is true, Summers seems to say, but each one of them has a story to tell. It’s up to us to decide if we want to listen–and if the way we consume their stories might do more harm than good."
