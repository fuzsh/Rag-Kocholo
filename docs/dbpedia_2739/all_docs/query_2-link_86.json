        "text": "I somehow got connected with a couple who acquired a young akita a few days ago. The precise communication to me was first, how does one put a dog down and second, could I assist in getting the animal put down or maybe take the dog off their hands.\n\nI knew 1 akita and have known several others. I have some understanding of their mentality. But nothing prepared me for 'Sadie'. About 5 months old, 60 lbs, untrained, and pure primal akita. Roughly, right at half way between a cougar and an aloof Alsatian.\n\nSadie started off her new life on a chain in their front yard. A few hours later the yard was a blood bath with Sadie finishing off (eating) the remains of a stray dog. The couple were completely terrified.\n\nI went over to interview Sadie. She accepted my presence in the normal akita way: tolerate. Not really accept. I was a thing. A competitive carnivore. After a few minutes I took the chain off her as she was obviously offended by it. In essence, human saying to animal, 'we own you' and animal thinking 'I own me. you are just controlling me'. Without the chain she selected a secluded place in the garden and lay down. I observed and just tried to empathize. Her attitude was, again, obvious: 'This is bull. I hate the world. Leave me alone. I'll happily fend for myself'.\n\nI talked to Sadie the same as gentling a horse. Pretty much just making noise as I expressed unsaid sentiments: I understand. I respect you. Can we establish a rapport?\n\nHe mannerisms were very similar to that of a wolf but more sedate. Extremely alert, out of her territory and very aware of that and the vulnerability that came with it. Really, just like an antisocial cat that is fully aware it has a lot of weight it can throw around and just wants her space.\n\nI spent about 7 hours working on the rapport. Just sitting near her. Walking around occasionally. Except for bathroom breaks and a drink of water, she just lay in her chosen space alertly regarding her new situation and disliking everything about it. At the end of the day I got up and said goodbye. She turned her head to stare at me. She had accepted me a little bit.\n\nI informed her owners to put out food and water, don't try to approach her and certainly don't try to chain or exert any control of her. They were afraid and skeptical but did as instructed. Sadie spent the night in her corner of the yard. She wasn't even comfortable enough to roam.\n\nThe next day I repeated the scenario. Sadie heard my jeep pull up and was staring at where I would enter the yard. I went over and took my usual place a few feet away from her. She had turned her head away and didn't regard me further. I was accepted and thus became what the primal akita thinks of all humans: a non entity. Live and let live and don't get in each others faces. There was no further progress. In fact, that rapport is about as much as one can expect from an akita. Unless subjugated by very extensive training or breeding one co-exists with them and nothing more.\n\nHer owners saw what I was doing and had watched carefully. At the end of the second day I explained Sadie to them. What rapport I had established was about as good as it will get. I'm not an oppressor or competitor and we can co-exist. Sadie was not and never would be a pet. She may become more amiable but she would never become a companion. Once she has her space and coexisted long enough around people who don't get up in her face she will learn to treat all humans as things other. Non threats... up to a point. If they thought they could handle her then what I did was what they would have to do and continue doing without lapse until she regards all humans in that light. She had to be treated just like they had rented a room to a moody stranger. You live together by mostly avoiding each other and being carefully respectful when you meet.\n\nWould she become playful? She may have playful moments but they would be entirely of her own choosing. She has her own life, her own way of thinking and her own viewpoints on things. One of which she had already demonstrated: Other animals are considered lesser beings and occasionally food.\n\nIs she dangerous? As dangerous as your average mellowed out bobcat or cougar, but a little higher up on the rational thinking scale. If she bites it is going to mean a trip to the emergency room. She will go as gung ho as a cat or wolf. But she's smart enough to not consider humans edible and the bite will only be a very brutal nasty warning to get out of her face.\n\nWhat should they feed her? Whatever she wants. Trial and error and give her a wide range of choices. But yes, she will be quite happy to eat raw meat or even kill her own. Giving her a live chicken or two once a week would probably make her quite happy. And yes, she will eat the entire animal including the bones.\n\nI then bit the bullet and laid out their 4 choices. 1. Put her down or return her. Get her out of their lives. 2. Attempt to subjugate her. With animals of her disposition more likely than not there will be a bad news altercation and she will end up being put down anyway. 3. Learn to live with her. Once settled and accepting she will demonstrate more personality than any 10 other dogs. 4. (Gasp) I would be willing to take her off their hands (dog you take this akita to have and to hold, to love and cherish until she or you die of old age or the plague?)\n\nThey contacted me two days later. Sadie had taken over the front porch. They asked her to move so they could get the door open and she understood and obliged. That evening Sadie was in the same place on the porch and moved without being asked, then returned to her station.\n\n\"We're going to keep her. No, she's going to keep us. Wish us luck.\"\n\nSadie's progress\n\nI just got back from visiting her and the couple. It is screamingly obvious to me the Norns have had a hand in things, along with shades of the Danse Macabre. The couple has completely altered their mindset towards Sadie. Last night they had their dinner out in the carport near Sadie's porch. Sadie got her dinner served at the same time. They left the doors open and Sadie took a stroll through the entire house before returning to her porch.\n\nThe workers went there today to size up putting in a fence around the entire property. A low fence to keep stray dogs out as they explained to Sadie. Sadie has so far been content to lie oh the porch the entire time. Mostly on her side but now and then on her tummy in alert mode.\n\nTheir dinner this evening was a little unworldly. We have a number of factory chicken farms around here and runts go for 15 to to 30 baht each. About 50 cents to $1. They again had their dinner outside but instead of feeding Sadie in her bowl they opened the box out in the yard and 'got the heck away from the crime scene'. Sadie went on alert, stalked and all 4 were dead in seconds. She then took the corpses off to a corner of the yard one by one and almost glomped them down whole. Then she returned to her porch, to my deranged eye looking a little smug and quite content. The entire chicken caper from stalking to her porked and back to the porch took maybe 10 minutes. I now understand clearly how my akita had put away 40 chickens in one nights raiding.\n\nSo far so good. Owners are infatuated with their strange bloodthirsty guest.\n\nPS Oh. One of the bipeds mentioned to me, \"Let's hope like hell she never gets the scent of the chicken farm\". (It's 15 kilometers away so I'm sure it's safe. Maybe. We hope.)\n\nPPS A thought just came to me. Me other has the ultimate of extremes in her choices of music. As the other morning she chose Doris Day's 'Perhaps' on one computer and PF's 'Careful with that ax, Eugene' simultaneously on the other box. So was there some sort of divine intervention when she chose to play Byrne's 'Psycho Killer' repeatedly over and over this AM as she got ready for work?\n\nMy younger one never showed any aggression. He was worthless for a guard dog, he was a big teddy bear. Made a great companion thou.\n\nBut was your dog an American Akita or an Akita Inu? The American Akita-the one which typically has a black facial mask and is often of a \"pinto\" pattern-is the result of crossing the \"Shen-Akita\" of Japan with American military dogs, usually German Shepherds, during the WWII and post-war occupation years, and the \"Shen-Akita\" itself was a product of crossing the ORIGINAL Akita with various Mastiff breeds to try to create a \"better\"(read: more controllable)pit-fighting dog. It was a step in the evolution of the breed that eventually became known as the Tosa Inu or Tosa Ken, which is largely a Mastiff breed today. The Akita Inu is a very primitive dog, essentially large Dingo. In Japan if an Akita retains the black mask after six months of age it is culled(as in killed) because that is seen as a sign of cross-breeding.\n\nCarolina Dogs are the only Dingo variant that barks, but it's more like the yap of a coyote. The Australian Dingo almost never barks, and I don't think the Singers CAN bark, not a real bark, anyway. I never heard any of mine bark, though they, along with the Akitas, would make some very strange and un-dog-like sounds, including some decidedly CAT-LIKE sounds, which included purring when content! They also spent what would seem to be an unusual amount of time grooming and washing themselves, again, more like a cat than a dog...while my bobcat and Maine Coon would sit in the window and BARK their fool cat heads off if someone drove up in the yard that they didn't know! I had dogs that acted like cats and cats that thought they were dogs, go figure. But Akitas are a strange lot. I'm not sure why they don't act like dogs or even wolves. The non-barking thing is probably a combination of the Dingo background and the fact that Japanese dog-fighters wanted a silent fighter, believing barking or any noise beyond an occasional low growl to be a sign of a coward, a dog that was about to quit, and such dogs got culled from the gene pool immediately. This probably is the reason why Akitas have a notorious \"poker face\", too, with expressions that don't vary much no matter what the dog is feeling or what its intentions are. Their \"I-like-you-a-lot\" face looks pretty much the same as their \"I'm-going-to-kill-you-now\" face, making them very difficult to \"read\", unlike a wolf.\n\npitbulllady\n\nCuriouser and curiouser. My akita had a black mask and as catfishrod69 described, could be cuddled. But he never reciprocated. Always that poker face. Always sedate and laid back. BUT... where my dogs were we had coyotes and my little scruffy would fiercely defend her terrortory and the akita would never hesitate to go out as her back up. But in akita mode, always silent and stalking. More than a few coyotes met their fate by zeroing in on the little yap yap and not noticing the canine cougar creeping up. That was when I discovered the akita was anything but a large lumbering dog. He was easily as fast and agile as a coyote. I saw him take his first coyote and from stalking to a blur, bowled the coyote over with his chest, bit, shook it and dead. A machine.\n\nThat reminded me of a typical trait of his. When I went somewhere and he wanted to go he would stroll to the back of the truck and put his front feet on up on the bed then wait. It was my job to hoist up his back end. Never exerted himself the tiniest bit that he didn't have to. Then he lay down and slept. Never had any interest sticking his head out and catching the breeze.\n\nThat is something that is still heartbreaking to me. My little dog got so used to having the akita as a back up it was her demise. We had to put my akita down. Acute intradermal mange, one year before they came out with a treatment for it. None of us gave thought to my little dog. Out she went one night without her back up and was killed by the coyotes.\n\nI recall sitting in a drift boat on the Daly River in Northern Territory, Aus, and observing the dingos for most of the night. Yes, they were independent of each other but still moved in a general group. The noises they made were amazing. One would never have thought 'dog' from just hearing them. Especially that yodeling warble. Somewhat reminiscent of a fast high pitched whale song. That brings to mind hearing a cougar making it's way up a draw I was at the top of, giving me a concert hall effect. I still get a shiver from recalling that unreal unearthly scream. I'm reasonably sure anyone who has ever heard that would get a little edgy just from reading this. Nothing else in nature could possibly compare.\n\nSo, as I have been told mostly from personal opinions, the Japanese installed and instilled some of the Inu traits. That supports quite a bit of their mien. Having lived around one family, old school Samurai would not be tolerant of any frivolity. Pure ruthless business nature and rigid discipline. One thing that is glaringly obvious is how stoic an akita is. As mine was killing a dog it completely ignored two other dogs chewing on it. Methodical and proficient it took one in it's mouth, killed it then turned on the next. No knee jerk reactions at all. That is something I can see from the hundreds of years, millenniums most likely, where akitas were carefully bred and selected to accompany the Samurai.\n\nI have also been told the akita was specially bred and trained as babysitters, their job to kill anyone who approached the baby they were guarding. I discovered my akita had a lethal maternal instinct when I brought it home. It made a beeline for the baby's crib and wouldn't let my wife or I near it.\n\nJust got the confirming call. PBL hit it dead on. Both sire and dame of Sadie are Inu. One bred for several generations here in Thailand and the other imported from Japan about a year ago. Sadie is white and brown. If our camera ever returns from Bangkok, shipped by Mongolian Turtle Post I suspect, I'll post a picture.\n\nI'm going to jump on my bike and go pay Sadie my daily visit. This just keeps getting more interesting. Hope I'm not boring too many people.\n\nAre you kidding? This thread is fascinating. A neighbor to the house in which I grew up raised show Akitas, which I assume were the American type (though only one, as I recall, had the characteristic mask). She had five (later six) which were very doggy, in any case. The five tolerated each other nicely but were absolutely not other-dog-friendly, which raises some questions about how they were trained and shown around other dogs and other breeds. If I were out with my dog there was a cacophany of big-dog-barking. If it were me alone or with another human they would give a warning bark or two and leave it at that. Definitely seemed to be more companionable than illustrated here, although I noticed they were not often given much attention/affection by their owner as you would expect from someone who raised that many healthy-looking animals.\n\nYears later I took in a stray with an interesting combination of traits and no idea of his background. Barkless, upright ears, very basenji-like in the face but essentially a Velcro dog, unlike most primitive breeds. Untrainable as can be--at the risk of anthropomorphizing too much, you can see him making the decision to ignore or disobey a command--but in no way an independent creature.\n\nI remember reading a blog with much interest a few years back that chronicled a couple's adventures trying to sort out the genetics of street dogs in different parts of the world. I would love for someone in my lifetime to do a big honking meta-analysis of dog phylogeny to see if some of these stereotypes and behaviors map out onto lineages. There have been a few interesting trees that have come out for cats, but dogs would be a much bigger undertaking...\n\n---------- Post added 03-03-2013 at 01:55 PM ----------\n\nWhoops, I didn't mean to imply that no one has done trees for dogs. There was a really interesting paper in Nature a few years back that mapped out a few regions in a large number of breeds.\n\nAre you kidding? This thread is fascinating.

There was a really interesting paper in Nature a few years back that mapped out a few regions in a large number of breeds.\n\nNo one has done \"trees\" on dogs that focus on behavior, and the only detailed \"tree\" with regards to ancestry has only involved AKC breeds, so dogs like the Carolina Dog and Australian Dingo don't even figure into the picture.\n\nThe couple you are referring to who have studied primitive dogs all over the world are probably Ray and Lorna Coppinger.\n\nIf you're in NC, that dog you took in was probably a Carolina Dog. Most of them can bark, but do not choose to do so often. They are much more pack-oriented than the Asian primitive breeds and some do tend to be \"clingy\", but are of course stubborn as a mule, as are all primitive dogs. That genetic code to obey and please a human has not evolved in these dogs, just as it has not evolved in wolves. Compare that to say, a Pit Bull Terrier or a Border Collie that will literally do ANYTHING you want just because you say so, and it's a whole different beast. The barking you heard from the Akitas your neighbor had in response to seeing another dog was probably of frustration, of being unable to get to the other dog and kill it. Had they been out, neither you nor your dog would have known they were around until it was too late. Showing an Akita is a challenge, to put it mildly, and mainly relies on you being hyper-vigilant not only of your dog, but everyone else's. Most dog show people know not to let their pooches get close to an Akita, though. Akitas do not typically lunge and make it obvious that they want to kill another animal; remember, the Japanese slaughtered any Akitas that barked or made a lot of noise, as it was seen as a sign of weakness and cowardice. Akitas are ambush predators, not unlike a big cat or python. They will even, as The Snark pointed out, wag their tails and LOOK friendly and inviting to another dog, but that tail wag simply means that they are excited about the prospect of making a kill. It's fences that frustrate them and lead to barking, although most of mine simply learned early in life that a fence was easily destroyed. They'd go through nine-gauge cyclone fencing, the same that I used to contain my big cats and wolves, like it was mosquito netting. I know people love to go on nowadays about how cruel it is to chain a dog, but with some breeds, like Akitas and many APBTs and Catahoulas, it's the only way to contain them. They have no respect at all for fences. That's just something else to destroy.\n\npitbulllady\n\nHere's another tidbit I would appreciate some info on. During WW2 the Japanese used dogs extensively in occupied areas as guard and patrol dogs. The dogs used were always Alsatians, never akitas. This is from my mother who lived in China during WW2. Matched pairs, soldier with the perfectly trained Alsatian walking side by side all over the region. The explanation being the akita would not train to that mode. My guess is it would be like training the average house cat to leash and attack duty.\n\nMy akita: Made growling moaning noise when really happy. Wagging tail, watch out! My mother once saw him leave his station and walk towards the gate, tail wagging a lot. She had the presence of mind to recall he never wagged his tail. She dashed out of the house and intercepted him, chasing off the 2 St. Boneheads that were passing by on the street.\n\nA week later she saw him strolling back home, tail wagging again and somewhat bloody. He had taken exception to one of those St. Bs, chewed through a chain link fence and went to town on it. Luckily he was chased off before the kill, the St. B was apparently so tall and bulky my dog couldn't get a good bite of neck or head and settled for a front leg which he broke. Sadly, that dog had hip dysplasia leaving him with only 1 fully functional leg and had to be put down.\n\nPhone call:\n\n\"Yup?\"\n\n\"Your dog is a total jerk\"\n\n\"Who did he do this time?\"\n\n\"I just had to put Stony down, which you are paying for, as well as fixing our fence.\"\n\n(30 years down the road and she is still giving me crap about that)\n\nI didn't believe he went through a chain link fence at first but he did. That is the hint as to how they kill other dogs so easily. Their mouths are huge, their bite formidable and their neck muscles strong enough so they can take the entire head or neck in their mouth then shake the victim like a rag doll. Instead of darting in for bite and tear over and over they go for that really good chomp then bring that musculature into play.\n\nIf someone traces dog lineage by trees, don't tell me. That's one of my blind spots that just leaves me completely confused.\n\nThis is pretty incredible. I had the opportunity to grow up with an Akita that was brought over from Japan as a puppy a year before I was born. He was a great dog until he began displaying some extreme moodiness toward everyone in the family around the age of two which began to leave everyone a bit uncomfortable at times and he knew that... After coming in from outside one day, he walked straight back to my father, pee'd and defecated right in front of him, then turned away as if nothing had happened. As soon as Akita was confronted, he began to growl a bit. Being the fairly burly person that my father was and the experience with larger dogs he has had over the years, he took Akita into the other room and made us stay in the kitchen together. He closed all of the doors, put on a work glove and got on all fours in front of a very pissed off Akita. They fought for about an hour, turning over a lounge chair, small table and tipping the couch back. It ended with my father biting Akita on the back of the neck and holding him completely still until he was completely exhausted.\n\nAt the end of it all, dad carried Akita into the family room, turned on the television, allowed Akita to rest up and got us from the kitchen. Of course, I was only a mere infant at the time while this was happening, so this story is based off the identical accounts of what my mother, sister, brother and father have collectively told me, however after that experience Akita never attempted to display a sense of dominance, never tackled anyone intentionally (not counting when I was four and too weak to keep him from jumping on me out of excitement,) never even bit me when I was a slightly evil child after he stole my pacifier, and I had grasped his lip in rage trying to get it back. He followed dad around everywhere and never had a problem with strangers or other dogs at any time.\n\nAnyway, I miss him dearly. Akita was the with us until I turned nine years of age. After the second day we moved into our new home, he unfortunately ran off to pass on, (something that I comfort myself with saying over other possibilities due to him becoming very ill at that time.)\n\nRecently, I've been attempting to search for another dog for my father to raise him out of the incredibly stressful, financial and health related issues we've all been experiencing. After happening across this thread, I'm going to be a bit adamant about pushing for an Akita puppy after some reminiscing and flipping through old Polaroid photos of when we were younger.\n\nThank you for this, truly. Once I return home, I'll upload the last decent photo I could find of him before we moved.\n\nTake care and good luck,\n\n-Andrew"
