        "text": "I live in the UK with my husband, sons and very cute dog.\n\nI started writing my first novel in 2016 following the death of my middle son. I began my author career writing crime fiction and have a bestelling gangland series under a pen name, but I have always been an avid reader of romance and wondered what would happen if I tried to combine my two reading passions. The result was my first dark romance series, London Ruthless. Since then I have written a further three bestselling series’ and I’ve never looked back.\n\nI love to write feisty heroines and morally grey, swoon-worthy alphas with filthy mouths, who would burn the world down for the ladies they love. My books have plenty of spice, angst and drama and are not for the faint hearted, but if you’d like to try for yourself, check out my books page. You can also see what’s coming soon on there too.\n\nI love to hear from readers so feel free to reach out on one of the many social media platforms I’m on. If you’d like to be kept up to date on what’s coming up, or are interested in exclusive teasers and reveals, then please join my Facebook readers group: Sadie’s Ladies and Sizzling Alpha’s.\n\nUntil then, I hope you have a beautiful day, and enjoy taking a look around."
