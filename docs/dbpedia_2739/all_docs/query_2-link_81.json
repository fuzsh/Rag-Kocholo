        "text": "MILWAUKEE (Gray News) – Authorities in Milwaukee said they have found more body parts of a 19-year-old woman who is believed to have been killed and dismembered on a first date earlier this month.\n\nIn a news release Thursday, the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office said a person walking on a remote beach along Lake Michigan came across a torso and an arm Thursday morning.\n\nInvestigators said they believe the body parts belong to 19-year-old Sade Robinson.\n\nMaxwell Anderson, 33, is accused of killing Robinson during a first date on or about April 2.\n\nThe gruesome discovery Thursday of a torso and an arm comes after investigators already found several other body parts they believe belong to Robinson.\n\nHer death was first investigated after a severed human leg was found in Warnimont Park in southern Milwaukee on April 2. DNA testing confirmed it belonged to Robinson.\n\nWithin a week, several additional body parts were found in various parts of Milwaukee, the sheriff’s office said, including a foot.\n\nAll of those remains are also believed to belong to Robinson, though not yet formally confirmed, officials said.\n\nAnderson is in custody and faces numerous charges in Robinson’s death. He is charged with first-degree intentional homicide, mutilating a corpse, and arson of property other than a building.\n\nThe arson charge comes after police found Robinson’s car on fire the morning after the date.\n\nRobinson was first reported missing the morning after her date with Anderson when she did not show up for work at Pizza Shuttle, which managers said was extremely unlike her, WDJT reported.\n\nPhone records showed she had been texting Anderson the night of the date, prior to meeting up, saying she was “feeling seafood.”\n\nPolice said they then tracked Robinson’s locations, which showed she was at a seafood restaurant, then a nearby sports bar, then Anderson’s home, and then the park where her leg was discovered.\n\nInvestigators said Anderson was tied to the crimes through surveillance videos, phone records, and witness accounts. AP reports that surveillance video from a restaurant showed Robinson and Anderson sitting together at the bar on the evening of April 1.\n\nDuring a search of Anderson’s home, police said they found blood and gasoline containers.\n\nAccording to WISN, Anderson was arrested on April 4. He is being held on a $5 million bond.\n\nA joint statement from the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office and the Milwaukee Police Department says a criminal complaint alleges Anderson “intentionally killed Sade C. Robinson, mutilated her remains, and set fire to her car in an attempt to obscure potential evidence of the killing.”\n\nWDJT reports that Robinson was a student at Milwaukee Area Technical College pursuing a career in criminal justice. The station also reports that Anderson is a bartender but did not say where.\n\nIt has not been confirmed how the two met.\n\nCNN reports that Anderson’s father issued a statement through the law firm representing his son, saying, “On behalf of myself and my family, I would like to express our deepest sympathy and heartfelt condolences to the family and loved ones of Sade Robinson. We are shocked and devasted by her senseless death.”\n\nThe statement continued, “To Sade’s mother and father, words cannot express our sorrow for the incomprehensible pain and grief you are going through. We join the entire community in celebrating Sade’s life.”\n\nDozens of volunteers have spent countless hours searching for Robinson’s remains. Community members have also created a memorial at Anderson’s house where Robinson was believed to have been murdered.\n\nA GoFundMe page has been set up for Robinson’s funeral costs. The page describes the unbearable pain her family and friends are going through, saying Robinson was “a loving daughter, a cherished sister, and a dear friend to so many.”"
