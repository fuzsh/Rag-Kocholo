        "text": "I knew this book was going to ruin me before I even read the first page. I could tell from the synopsis. Then I saw the format of the story and knew it was going to kill me dead with feelings. I was not wrong. I don’t even know how much I want to say in this review because I want everyone to read this book and have the suspense and the thrill that I had while reading it. But before I accidentally give something away, let’s get to the review!\n\nSynopsis (from Goodreads):\n\nA missing girl on a journey of revenge and a Serial-like podcast following the clues she’s left behind.\n\nSadie hasn’t had an easy life. Growing up on her own, she’s been raising her sister Mattie in an isolated small town, trying her best to provide a normal life and keep their heads above water.\n\nBut when Mattie is found dead, Sadie’s entire world crumbles. After a somewhat botched police investigation, Sadie is determined to bring her sister’s killer to justice and hits the road following a few meager clues to find him.\n\nWhen West McCray—a radio personality working on a segment about small, forgotten towns in America—overhears Sadie’s story at a local gas station, he becomes obsessed with finding the missing girl. He starts his own podcast as he tracks Sadie’s journey, trying to figure out what happened, hoping to find her before it’s too late.\n\nLet’s get into the format of the book first. I about died when I realized the book is split up into chapters that are written like a podcast transcript and chapters that are written from Sadie’s point of view. I love a good podcast and when Serial first started, I listened to each episode the day they came out. When I started reading the first page and realized it was written like a podcast, I almost fell off the couch with excitement. West McCray is the host of the podcast, The Girls, and originally, doesn’t really want this story when his boss gives it to him. But slowly, he starts to see that this is a story that needs to be told. He ends up going to Sadie’s hometown of Cold Creek, Colorado where he visits Sadie and Mattie’s aunt so he can start to understand what Mattie and Sadie’s lives were like and what happened to them. He is a great narrator and lets the story of Sadie come through the people who lived with her and the ones she meets along her journey. His last lines are truly heart-wrenching.\n\nSadie’s point of view is just as brilliant. Sadie is such a strong main character but not in the way most people talk about strong characters. She cries, feels thing intensely, and is scared at times but fights through her fear to try and find the man that killed her sister. She also does her fair share of fighting. And for someone with no investigative/detective experience, she does an amazing job finding clues, asking questions, and figuring out the answers she needs to get to the next step in her journey. I fell in love with Sadie and her story (told through the podcast and in her own words) and became completely invested in whether she succeeded or not (like I said: LOTS OF FEELINGS!).\n\nCourtney Summers did a brilliant job with this book. Her writing is so good I could cry. The podcast/Sadie POV mix, the semi-cliffhanger-y ending, the slow but satisfying way the facts of Sadie and her sister’s lives are revealed makes for a compelling, thrilling, and emotional read. If you can’t tell from all the praise, I am giving Sadie 5 out of 5 stars. The book doesn’t come out until September but you need to get this one on your TBR lists right now,\n\nSadie by Courtney Summers comes out September 4, 2018.\n\nThank you, NetGalley and St. Martin’s Press/Wednesday Books for this ARC in exchange for my honest review."
