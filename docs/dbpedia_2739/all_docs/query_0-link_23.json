        "text": "“Our family has lost our baby duckling.\n\nSadie was taken to radiology earlier today and they confirmed our fears - that there was no longer any blood flow to her brain.\n\nWe spent the afternoon saying our goodbyes, including singing Sadie's favorite song, Baby Shark as a family, with her brother and sisters, mom and dad, and all her grandparents singing along. (This was her sister, Claire's idea)\n\nTomorrow the doctors will stop her heart, and bring her for organ donation. I'm planning to bring my baby home - by which I mean I will be asking the doctors to hold Sadie's hand until her little heart stops beating.\n\nIt's a terrible thing for a father to lose a child. I saw this in my grandfather before me - my uncle died when I was about Sadie's age. But I'm determined to be strong for my other 4 children, who all still need me.\n\nThank you to EVERYONE sending me prayers and messages, and please keep them coming. I'll do my best to respond to as many as I can in the coming days.\n\nEveryone has been so kind to us, and to anyone asking how they can help, I would love for this day, February 19, to be a day that everyone takes the time to love their near and dear ones, for Sadie's sake: Sadie's Day. If y'all could make that her legacy, I'd be forever grateful.\n\nGoodbye, my Sadie. I promise, when my time in this world is done, I promise I will come find you.”"
