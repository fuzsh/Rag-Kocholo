        "text": "Ellery and her twin brother Ezra’s mother Sadie falls off the wagon and is sent to rehab, so they have to go live with their grandmother in their family’s home town of Echo Ridge. On paper it seems like the perfect place, but it has a dark history: their mother’s identical twin Sarah went missing; then five years ago Sadie’s babysitter’s daughter Lacey was killed. Ellery bonds with Malcolm, the brother of the town’s main suspect for the second murder and quickly becomes a target.\n\nThis was an intriguing mystery with distinctive characters who interacted well together. Going back there are a few little hints (as well as the red herrings) as to the resolution but I would have liked a little more so it was more possible to theorise! Additionally I think the climax was wrapped up a little too quickly. There weren’t very many flowery or interesting word choices either, which was fine but I wish, because of that, there had been a bit more of an exciting story.\n\nRating: B-\n\nSPOILERS AHEAD!\n\nThe last person who moved to their school was Katrin’s best friend Viv, so everyone knows who the Corcoran twins are when they arrive. This means, to her surprise, Ellery gets nominated for homecoming court, which makes her a target for what seems to be the returned killer. Her main suspects were all in Lacey’s class: their awkward neighbouring police office Ryan Rodriguez (who her mother has led her to think had a crush on Lacey); Malcolm’s brother Declan (her boyfriend); and Lacey’s best friend Daisy. It turns out Declan was concerned Malcom still had a crush on Daisy because the pair were in love behind Lacey’s back and are currently dating! Daisy’s sister Mia confronts her about this and Daisy hits her harder than she intended to, but she seems genuinely distressed about Lacey’s death and has even been attending therapy.\n\nMalcolm is giving the twins lift back from Fright Farm, dropping them off then taking Brooke home, however the next morning they discover she has gone missing, meaning he’s in the same position as his brother was. It doesn’t help that Katrin is convinced he was secretly dating Brooke, and insinuates this to an officer who already has an ax to grind against Malcolm. As a true crime officianado Ellery is a little suspicious of him, but she decides to be more like her brother and trust him. Personally, I found Viv incredibly suspicious because of her stealing Ellery’s opinions, and her coldness to basically everyone, but I thought that’d be a little easy, so my crackpot theory was that Brooke was teamed up with the killer.\n\nA side mystery is who the twins’ father is, as it turns out Sadie’s visit to the town lines up perfectly with their birth. Ellery’s fearful that it could be Sadie’s previously hot but now washed up homecoming date Vance Puckett, although he does help them by explaining that he was with Brooke because she asked him how to pick a lock. They find the lock she was trying to pick and sicover a repair receipt with Katrin’s number on it; early on Katrin nearly runs over Malcolm and Ellery, foreshadowing this later reveal that this repair was on the night their teacher was hit and killed. Malcolm follows his stepsister and finds her posting one of the threats.\n\nRyan’s another suspect out; he was nervous because he discovered his father is also the twins’, Now trusting him, Ellery tries to share her theories but he seems to have things under control. Brooke’s body has been found and he goes to question Declan about his class ring found there, Ryan is actually trying to clear Malcolm’s brother however their history means this is a heated exchange, leaving Malcolm suspecting his brother.\n\nAt his house, he and Ellery realise Peter is the murderer, who was dating both Brooke and Lacey, and had meant to kill Sadie, homecoming queen, rather than her twin. Unfortunately he also realises they know and takes them down to the basement to die from carbon monoxide poisoning. Thankfully Ellery manages to text her new brother one letter that brings him there to save them, as the police were onto the same trail. They catch Peter near the border and I was kind of right that Viv was involved, but it was unrelated as she just published the threats to create her own story. Katrin knew about her father’s involvement, but she co-operates with the DA and goes to live with her aunt whilst Declan gets to know his brother better, and the twins get to know their own half-siblings. Plus Malcolm and Ellery finally go on their clown museum date, however she keeps the secret that Peter was aiming for her mother.\n\n“You know how it is. She followed me, I followed back in a moment of weakness.”\n\n“Everything is going to be all right. Or if not, everything is going to be, so let’s not worry.”"
