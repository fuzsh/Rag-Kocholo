        "text": "Sadie Marie Bennett, or Suicide Sadie, is a Creepypasta character created by pnckes. What was once a normal life, Sadie's life began to spiral into tragedy after tragedy before killing herself in an act of escapism. After becoming a ghost, she grew inspired to protect adolescents from abuse, much like her fate from her abusive father. However, unbeknownst to her, her doings often cause more trauma than they should have.\n\nOrigin\n\nSadie Marie Bennett grew up on the outskirts of London, England. Her father was a successful businessman, while her mother acted as a stay-at-home wife who catered to Sadie’s well-being. Due to her being homeschooled, she didn’t have many opportunities to make friends besides a penpal named Scarlet she met on vacation.\n\nOne day, her father received a promotion, thus resulting in her family moving to the United States for a better future. Her mother became very stern about cultural integration and continued to homeschool her. During that time, she suffered from homesickness, yet her family and penpal kept her accompanied through those depressive periods. However, her mother suddenly experienced a seizure and was eventually diagnosed with Metastatic glioblastoma. Three weeks later, she passed. Sadie’s father began to change as his wife’s death took a mental toll on him; alcoholism became a regular addiction. Following her mother’s death, Sadie got thrown into a public school setting, where she faced discrimination because of her English accent. The abuse continued as her father would lash out at her because of his wife’s identical appearance to their daughter.\n\nHer addiction to physical pain began when she accidentally cut her finger. It comforted her and provided her with sanity from her deteriorating life. One school counselor noticed her radical shift in body language and notified the authorities to her house. Her father simply lied, stating her ‘pet cat’ went missing when they never had a cat. After the cops left, her father accused Sadie of calling the police and proceeded to abuse her further.\n\nIn her 18th year, Sadie had enough and decided to commit suicide. She slit her arms, and when she wanted to stab her throat, she accidentally sliced deep into her left eye. Subsequently recovering from her shock, Sadie finally plunges her knife into her jugular, eventually dying from blood loss.\n\nAfter she turned into a ghost, her rage intensified as she possessed her father’s drunken body. Moving her father’s unconscious body to the kitchen, Sadie stabs him in his throat as his corpse falls to the floor. After murdering her father, Sadie swore an oath to protect children from abuse as she roams, searching for perpetrators to hunt.\n\nAppearance\n\nSadie lacks any colour, only shown in traditional black and white. She wears her mother's white oversized night shirt that reaches her thighs and she wears no shoes. She has bleeding black scars on both her legs, along with her neck and arms. Her left eye is pitch black and empty, bleeding the same black blood due to her suicide attempt being sloppy. She has messy, wavy white hair that reaches down to her waist.\n\nPersonality\n\nSuicide Sadie is very reserved, usually seen in a depressive or an emotionless state. She does not act slutty, sassy or lovable at all, actually. She's overprotective, especially around children and becomes highly aggressive towards others who try to harm them. She also often acts very uncontrollably when angry and as a result her hair goes wild when enraged.\n\nPowers and Abilities\n\nDespite being a supernatural entity, Sadie doesn't appear to have many magical abilities. She's only known to be able to float without restriction and possess the body and minds of her victims. She will stalk and drive the abuser slowly insane, giving them one warning to change their ways. If they continue, she will kill them either stage it to look like a suicide or an accidental death. She can now use mirrors, similarly to a portal, as a means to transport from one location to another.\n\nLikes and Dislikes\n\nLikes Dislikes Peacefulness Violence towards children Quiet places Rude behaviour and attitudes Her mother's grave Bullying 'Saving lives' Abusive parents\n\nFacts"
