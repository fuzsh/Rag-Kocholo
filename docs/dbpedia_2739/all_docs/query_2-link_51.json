        "text": "A 19-year-old has been indicted for allegedly driving a boat under the influence in a crash that left a 17-year-old girl dead this summer off Cape Cod, prosecutors announced Tuesday.\n\nDavid K. Sullivan, a teenager from Medfield, was indicted by a Barnstable County grand jury on Friday, the Cape & Islands District Attorney said. He faces charges including operating a vessel under the influence and reckless or negligent operation of a vessel causing death.\n\nThe boat Sullivan was allegedly driving crashed the night of July 21 in Dennis' Sesuit Harbor, leaving 17-year-old Sadie Mauro dead and two other people seriously hurt.\n\nSullivan is due in court to face the charges next Tuesday, prosecutors said. It wasn't immediate clear if he had an attorney who could speak to the charges.\n\nIt's unclear how Sullivan and Mauro knew each other, but both were lacrosse players.\n\nSullivan attended the prestigious Roxbury Latin School, and currently attends Dartmouth College, where he's been a member of the lacrosse team.\n\nMauro, who lived in Sherborn with her parents and brother, was an elite lacrosse player at Dover-Sherborn High School.\n\n\"What occurred that night was an unimaginable tragedy,\" Sullivan's attorney, David E. Meier, said in a statement. \"But what occurred was an accident — in every sense of the word. These criminal charges only compound that tragedy for everyone involved.\"\n\nThe charges that Sullivan was indicted on are death of a person caused by operating a vessel under the influence of intoxicating liquor, possessing false RMV documents, minor in possession of alcohol, two counts of operation of a vessel while under the influence of intoxicating liquor causing serious bodily injury and reckless or negligent operation of a vessel causing death.\n\nMauro's body was recovered from the water by the regional dive team, with assistance from Dennis Fire-Rescue personnel, around 11:30 p.m., officials have said.\n\nA preliminary investigation revealed that the vessel — a Regulator equipped with two outboard 250 horsepower engines bearing an Alabama registration — was occupied by six people at the time of the crash, which occurred at the jetty by the channel leading to the Northside Marina in Sesuit Harbor."
