My dad takes really good care of me! I have a cool house with lots of awesome toys and a great yard. You should see how fast I can run! Dad even got me chickens! They’re a little scary so I stay on my side of the fence, but they’re fun to watch! Dad takes me camping all of the time and man do I love a good road trip! Camping is the best! Every Sunday I get to see Dad’s whole family for dinner! I have a doggo cousin and a people cousin! My doggo cousin is the best. Sometimes I pester him but he loves me anyway. I’m doing great and just wanted to let you all know. Thank you for everything!"
