The series will examine how the roles of women have changed but how their reaction to betrayal has not.\n\nCalvano will play April. Seen in 1963. She is a beautiful young waitress with a free spirit. She’s a burgeoning 1960’s flower child who strikes up an unusual friendship with a 1960’s housewife.\n\nWhy Women Kill is produced by Imagine Television Studios and CBS Television Studios. Cherry executive produces with Imagine’s Brian Grazer and Francie Calfo and Acme Productions’ Michael Hanel and Mindy Schultheis. Marc Webb also executive produces and directs. Imagine will co-produce with CBS Television Studios.\n\nCalvano is known for her role as Violet on CBS’ Mom. She’s repped by Paradigm, Zero Gravity Management and attorney Steve Younger of Myman Greenspan."
