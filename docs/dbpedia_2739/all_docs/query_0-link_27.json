        "text": "Lyrics: Traditional\n\nMusic: Traditional\n\nThis was played half a dozen times in all by the Dead (and also by Garcia solo or with David Grisman). The lyrics below are a composite from versions in 1969/70 and on the \"Pizza Tapes\". They represent the fullest version sung: when played by the Dead in 1980 there were fewer verses.\n\nWent out last night to take a look around\n\nMet little Sadie and I blowed her down\n\nWent right home, went to bed\n\nForty-four smokeless under my head\n\nWoke up the next morning about half past nine (note 1)\n\nThe hacks and the buggies all standing in line\n\nThe gents and the gamblers standing all around\n\nTaking little Sadie to her burying ground\n\nWell I began to think what a deed I'd done\n\nGrabbed my hat and away I run\n\nMade a good run, but a little too slow\n\nThey overtook me in Jericho\n\nI'm standing on the corner reading a bill (note 2)\n\nAlong came the sheriff from Thomasville\n\nSays \"Young man, is your name Brown?\n\nRemember the night you blowed Sadie down?\"\n\nOh, yes sir, my name is Lee (note 3)\n\nI murdered little Sadie in the first degree\n\nFirst degree and the second degree\n\nGot any papers would you read 'em to me\n\nWell they took me downtown all dressed in black\n\nPut me on the train and sent me back\n\nSent me back to the county jail\n\nI had nobody for to go my bail\n\nThe judge and the jury they took the stand\n\nThe judge held the paper in his right hand\n\nForty-one days, forty-one nights\n\nForty-one years to wear the ball and stripes\n\n7 Walkers do a similar version which often appears in setlists as \"Early In The Morning\"\n\nI went out one night to take a look around\n\nI saw little Sadie, well I shot her down\n\nWent right home, and I got into bed\n\nForty-nine shotgun under my head\n\nI woke up the next morning at half past nine\n\nLong black cadillacs standing in line\n\nThe girls and [hombres] standing all around\n\nTaking little Sadie to her burying ground\n\nTaking little Sadie to her burying ground\n\nEarly in the morning\n\nEarly in the morning\n\nEarly in the morning\n\nEarly in the morning\n\nWell I got to thinking 'bout the deed I done\n\nGrabbed my hat and away I run\n\nMade a good run, but a little too slow\n\nThey overtook me down in Mexico\n\nI'm standing on the corner just a-reading a bill\n\nAlong came the sheriff from [Romanter]ville\n\nSays \"Son, ain't your name Brown?\n\nRemember the night you shot Sadie down?\"\n\nRemember the night you shot Sadie down?\"\n\nEarly in the morning\n\nEarly in the morning\n\nEarly in the morning\n\nEarly in the morning\n\nI said, yes sir, my name is Lee\n\nI killed Sadie in the first degree\n\nFirst degree and the second degree\n\nYou got any papers would you read 'em to me\n\nWell they took me downtown all dressed in black\n\nPut me on the train and carried me back\n\nPut me back in that Nashville jail\n\nI had money for to go my bail\n\nI had money for to go my bail\n\nEarly in the morning\n\nEarly in the morning\n\nEarly in the morning\n\nEarly in the morning\n\nEarly in the morning\n\nEarly in the morning\n\nEarly in the morning\n\nEarly in the morning\n\nNotes\n\n(1) this verse is on the \"Pizza Tapes\" but I don't think Garcia sang it with the Dead\n\n(2) some lyric versions have this as \"ringing my bell\", but that seems to be a mis-hearing of \"reading a bill\" or \"reading my bills\"\n\n(3) this is a verse the Dead sang in 1969/70. On the \"Pizza Tapes\", Garcia sings the \"judge and jury\" verse here (as well as at the end). I think this is a mistake - the verse about bail should come before the verse about the trial!\n\nGrateful Dead Recordings DateAlbum 26 Dec 1969Dave's Picks Volume 43 23 Feb 197030 Days Of The Dead (2020) 28 Feb 197030 Days Of The Dead (2022) 31 Oct 1980Reckoning (note 1) Jerry Garcia Recordings DateAlbumRecorded By 27 Jan 1986GarciaLive Volume 14Jerry Garcia/John Kahn 28 Feb 1986Pure Jerry: Marin Veterans Memorial AuditoriumJerry Garcia/John Kahn 29 Aug 1987Electric On The Eel (bonus disc)Jerry Garcia Acoustic Band 4/5 Feb 1993Pizza TapesGarcia/Grisman/Rice\n\nNotes\n\n(1) issued as a bonus track in the box set Beyond Description (1973-1990)\n\nRoots\n\nThis song seems to have its origins in the late 1800s. It is found under a variety of titles: \"Bad Lee Brown\", \"Bad Man Ballad\", \"Late One Night\" and several others.\n\nLyle Lofgren says:\n\n\"Versions of this song were found throughout the south, particularly in Appalachia and the Ozarks. The tunes vary, but the story is remarkably stable. Lee Brown shoots his woman, runs away, is caught, tried, and gets a long sentence. He has no remorse, other than that he is jailed. One writer says this song was very popular as early as 1885, but I couldn't find the source of that claim. There are lots of towns in America with the names given in the song, but Thomasville and Jericho, North Carolina are only 60 miles apart, which make them prime candidates for locale. There's no reason to believe this song is literal history, though. A cursory search shows no information on a real Lee Brown, or any evidence that the song describes an actual murder.\"\n\nAlan Lomax collected a version under the title \"Bad Man Blues\" from a \"tongue-tied Negro convict at Parchman, Mississippi\" and published it in \"American Ballads and Folk Songs\" in 1934:\n\nLate las' night I was a-makin' my rounds\n\nMet my woman an' I blowed her down\n\nWent on home an' I went to bed\n\nPut my hand cannon right under my head\n\nEarly nex' mornin' 'bout de risin' o' de sun\n\nI gets up-a for to make-a my run\n\nI made a good run but I made it too slow\n\nGot overtaken in Mexico\n\nStandin' on de corno', readin' of a bill\n\nUp step a man name o' Bad Texas Bill\n\n\"Look here, bully, am' yo' name Lee Brown?\n\nB'lieve you are de rascal shot yo' woman down\"\n\n\"Yes, oh, yes,\" says. \"This is him\n\nIf you got a warrant, jes' read it to me\"\n\nHe says: \"You look like a fellow that knows what's bes'\n\nCome 'long wid me you're under arres'\"\n\nWhen I was arrested, I was dressed in black\n\nDey put me on a train, an' dey brought me back\n\nDey boun' me down in de county jail\n\nCouldn' get a human for to go my bail\n\nEarly nex' mornin' 'bout half pas' nine\n\nI spied ol' jedge drappin' down de line\n\nI heered ol' jailer when he cleared his th'oat\n\n\"Nigger, git ready for de deestreec' cote\"\n\nDeestreec' cote is now regin\n\nTwelve big jurymen, twelve hones' men\n\nFive mo' minutes up step a man\n\nHe was holdin' my verdic' in his right han'\n\nVerdic' read murder in de firs' degree\n\nI said, \"O Lawd, have mercy on me\"\n\nI seed ol' jedge when he picked up his pen\n\nSay, \"I don' think you'll ever kill a woman ag'in\n\n\"This here kuhn' of women natchly got to stop\n\nI don't know whether to hang you er not\n\nNinety-nine years on de hard, hard groun'\n\n'Member de night you blowed de woman down\"\n\nHere I is, bowed down in shame\n\nI got a number instead of a name\n\nHere for de res' of my nachul life\n\nAn' all I ever done is kill my wife\n\nW H Thomas read a paper before the Folk-Lore Society of Texas in 1912 entitled \"Some current folk-songs of the negro and their economic interpretation. This quoted the verses:\n\nI dreamt last night I was walking around\n\nI met that nigger and I knocked her down\n\nI knocked her down and I started to run\n\nTill the sheriff done stopped me with his Gatling gun\n\nI made a good run, but I run too slow\n\nHe landed me over in the Jericho\n\nI started to run off down the track\n\nBut they put me on the train and brought me back\n\nRandolph, in Ozark Folksongs Vol. II, reported two fragments of early versions. The first was \"Sung by Miss Billie Freese, Joplin, Mo., Apr. 17, 1922. Miss Freese learned it from her boy-friend, a native of West Plains, Mo.\"\n\nLast night I was a-makin' my rounds\n\nMet my old woman an' I blowed her down\n\nI went on home to go to bed\n\nPut my old cannon right under my head\n\nJury says murder in the first degree\n\nI says oh Lord, have mercy on me\n\nOld Judge White picks up his pen\n\nSays you'll never kill no woman ag'in\n\nThe second Randolph fragments was \"Contributed by Mr. Robert L. Kennedy, Springfield, Mo., May 3, 1934. Mr. Kennedy says that the song was popular in Springfiled fifty years ago.\"\n\nDon't know whether to hang you or not\n\nThis killin' women jest nachelly's got to stop\n\nHere I is bowed down with shame\n\nGot a number instead of a name\n\nForty-nine years in prison for life\n\nAll I ever done was to kill my wife\n\nThe first recorded version, at least under this title, seems to have been by Clarence Ashley in 1929 or 1930 (but see below for the version recorded by John Dilleshaw in 1929 under the title \"Bad Lee Brown.\" I have also seen references to a 1928 recording by Buddy (Ernest) Baker under the title \"Penitentiary Blues\"). Ashley's version is pretty similar to what Jerry Garcia sings:\n\nWent out last night to take a little round\n\nI met my Little Sadie and I blowed her down\n\nI run right home and I went to bed\n\nA forty-four smokeless under my head\n\nI begin to think what a deed I done\n\nI grabbed my hat and away'd I'd run\n\nI made a good run, just a little to slow\n\nThey overtook me in Jericho\n\nStanding on the corner a-ringing a bell\n\nAnd up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville\n\nSays, 'Young man, is your name Brown?\n\nRemember the night you blowed Sadie down'\n\n'Oh, yes, Sir, my name is Lee\n\nI murdered little Sadie in the first degree\n\nFirst degree and second degree\n\nGot any papers, will you read 'em to me?'\n\nTook me downtown and dressed me in black\n\nThey put me on a train and they sent me back\n\nHad no one for to go my bail\n\nCrammed me back in the county jail\n\nJudge and the jury took their stand\n\nJudge had his papers in his right hand\n\nForty-one days, forty-one nights\n\nForty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes\n\nJohnny Cash sang a closely related version called \"Transfusion Blues\" (credited to Roy Hogsed) or \"Cocaine Blues.\" The lyrics are recognisably similar, but the tune is very different.\n\nEarly one mornin' while makin' the rounds\n\nI took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down\n\nI went right home and I went to bed\n\nI stuck that lovin' 44 beneath my head\n\nGot up next mornin' and I grabbed that gun\n\nTook a shot of cocaine and away I run\n\nMade a good run but I ran too slow\n\nThey overtook me down in Juarez Mexico\n\nLate in the hot joints takin' the pills\n\nIn walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill\n\nHe said Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown\n\nYou're the dirty heck that shot your woman down\n\nSaid yes, oh yes my name is Willy Lee\n\nIf you've got the warrant just a-read it to me\n\nShot her down because she made me sore\n\nI thought I was her daddy but she had five more\n\nWhen I was arrested I was dressed in black\n\nThey put me on a train and they took me back\n\nHad no friend for to go my bail\n\nThey slapped my dried up carcass in that county jail\n\nEarly next mornin' bout a half past nine\n\nI spied the sheriff coming down the line\n\nAh, and he coughed as he cleared his throat\n\nHe said come on you dirty heck into that district court\n\nInto the courtroom my trial began\n\nWhere I was handled by twelve honest men\n\nJust before the jury started out\n\nI saw the little judge commence to look about\n\nIn about five minutes in walked the man\n\nHolding the verdict in his right hand\n\nThe verdict read murder in the first degree\n\nI hollered Lawdy Lawdy, have a mercy on me\n\nThe judge he smiled as he picked up his pen\n\n99 years in the San Quentin pen\n\n99 years underneath that ground\n\nI can't forget the day I shot my woman down\n\nCome on you've gotta listen unto me\n\nLay off that liquor and let that transfusion be\n\nIn some versions, Johnny Cash sang the end as:\n\nThe judge he smiled as he picked up his pen\n\n99 years in the Folsom pen\n\n99 years underneath that ground\n\nI can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down\n\nCome on you've gotta listen unto me\n\nLay off that whiskey and let that cocaine be\n\nThe Kingston Trio had a hit with a version of the song in 1960, under the title \"Bad Man's Blunder\"\n\nWell, early one evening I was roaming around\n\nI was feeling kind of mean, I shot a deputy down\n\nStrolled along home, and I went to bed\n\nWell, I laid my pistol up under my head\n\n(He strolled along home) I took my time\n\n(And he went to bed) Thought I'd sleep some\n\n(Laid his pistol) Big twenty-two\n\n(Up under his head) I keep it handy\n\nWell, early in the morning about the break of day\n\nI figured it was time to make a getaway\n\nStepping right along but I was steppin too slow\n\nGot surrounded by a sheriff down in Mexico\n\n(He was steppin' right along) I were a hot-footin' it\n\n(But he was steppin' too slow) It was a sultry day\n\n(Got surrounded by a sheriff) Boxed in\n\n(In Mexico) I didn't even have a chance to see the country\n\nWhen I was arrested, why, I didn't have a dime\n\nThe sheriff says, son, you're riding free this time\n\nWhere you're going you won't need a cent\n\n'Cause the great state of Texas gonna pay your rent\n\n('Cause where you're goin') I think he means jail\n\n(You won't need a cent) When he knows I'm broke\n\n('Cause the great state of Texas) Yippee\n\n(Gonna pay your rent) I'm mighty grateful, fellas\n\nWell, I didn't have a key and I didn't have a file\n\nNaturally I stayed around until my trial\n\nThe judge was an old man of ninety-three\n\nAnd I didn't like the way the jury looked at me\n\n(Well the judge was an old man) Too old\n\n(Ninety-three) Entirely too old\n\nI didn't like the way the jury looked at me\n\nI think they were suspicious\n\nThe judge and the jury, they did agree\n\nThey all said murder in the first degree\n\nThe judge said, saying, I don't know whether to hang you or not\n\nBut this here killing of deputy sheriffs, has just naturally got to stop\n\n(You got a point there, judge)\n\nIt was a most unsatisfactory trial\n\nThey gave me ninety-nine years on the hard rock pile\n\nNinety and nine on the hard rock ground\n\nAll I ever did was shoot a deputy down\n\n(Ninety and nine) It could have been life\n\n(On the hard rock pile) They might-a hung me\n\n(And all he ever did was shoot a deputy down)\n\nThis whole thing has sure been a lesson to me\n\nBang, you're dead\n\nA rival for first recorded version is \"Bad Lee Brown,\" recorded by John Dilleshaw in 1929. But while the story is similar, it doesn't bear much relationship either lyrically or musically to the Clarence Ashley/Jerry Garcia version:\n\nWell I'll tell you a story, 'bout a railroad man\n\nHe rode the Red River, and the Rio Grande\n\nLate last night when he came into town\n\nHe met his little woman with a man named Lee Brown\n\nHe went right home, and he got his gun\n\nShot the man and his woman, and away he run\n\nHe made a good run, but his run was too slow\n\nThe sherrif overtaken him in a day or so\n\nStanding on the corner in a Southern town\n\n[Talked] up to him, saying, son ain't your name Brown\n\nYes oh yes, sir, this must be he\n\nIf you have any papers, please read 'em to me\n\nThe sherrif arrested him, and he carried him back\n\nThe people all met him down at the railroad track\n\nDown to the station, the people all did go\n\nLate in the evening, I hear that whistle blow\n\nCarried him back to that county jail\n\nHe didn't know no one that could go his bail\n\nSo one Tuesday morning, he spied a man\n\nHolding up the verdict in his right hand\n\nThe verdict read murder in the first degree\n\nLee Brown, oh Lord, Lord have mercy on me\n\nHe looked at the judge with a quivering chin\n\nSaid ninety-nine years in a flat-top pen\n\nForty four feet down under the ground\n\nYou remember the day you shot your woman down\n\nI said forty four feet down under the ground\n\nYou remember the day you shot your woman down\n\nFurther Information\n\nFor more information on recordings see Matt Schofield's Grateful Dead Family Discography\n\nFor online chords and TAB see www.rukind.com\n\nFor sheet music, see:\n\nJerry Garcia Songbook (vocal line and chords)"
