        "text": "Abstract\n\nPIP: Helplessly watching a woman die from a self-induced abortion forever changed the life of Margaret Sanger, the women who brought the issue of birth control to the forefront of feminist and health issues. In 912, Sanger, wide and mother of 3, practiced nursing in New York City. One day she accompanied a physician to an emergency at the house of Jake Sachs, a 28 year-old truck driver and husband of Sadie Sachs. Sadie was very ill, the product of a self-induced abortion. Sanger nursed Sadie for several weeks until she recovered, but as Sanger prepared to make her leave, Sadie said that another pregnancy would end her life. Sanger asked the physician if there was anything that could be done, but he responded negatively. Three months later, the Sachs household had another emergency, and Sanger promptly arrived, already knowing what she would find. It was too late to save Sadie Sachs. This incident changed her life. She renounced the nursing profession for activism, but was unable to convince her feminist and socialist friends of the need for controlling family size. So she began studying all there was to know on the subject, and came to coin the term \"birth control\". Later she started publishing a magazine designed to educate on birth control, but the authorities put an end to it, since the law prohibited anyone from providing information to prevent conception for any reason. She fled to England, but returned to open a clinic in Brooklyn that distributed information on birth control. The clinic served hundreds of people, until it was raided by police on the 9th day of operation. Sanger went to jail. Nonetheless, her pioneering efforts did begin the acknowledgement of the need for birth control. And now, public opinion stands on the side of Margaret Sanger."
