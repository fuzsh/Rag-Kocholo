Or at least it became our normal.\n\nBut back to that first time briefly. My infant put a hand into a very small amount of peanut butter, a remnant of something our friends toddler had been eating (in the fashion of toddlers, messily). From A’s tiny hand, that peanut butter — a nice smooth, easily spreadable variety — was rubbed on their face and through their hair…. and, within seconds, my baby began to swell before my eyes. By the time 5 minutes had elapsed, A’s face was so puffed up, their eyes were swollen shut like a miniature prize fighter, and I was frantically attempting to wash away as much as the offending nut butter as I possibly could while my child screamed and I was waiting to be connected to the local emergency room.\n\nI was terrified. It was traumatic, for both of us.\n\nSo yes, that was the first time. On getting through to the ER and being quickly transferred to a duty nurse, my next hastily dialled call was to the ambulance service."
