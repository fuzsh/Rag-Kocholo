        "text": "When Sylvia Butler split up with her husband in 1969, she had four children, no job and plenty of worries. But on the day before Thanksgiving that year, her doorbell rang and she found Sadie Mitchell standing on her stoop with two large bags of food and a turkey.\n\n“I was just so surprised and so thankful,” Mrs. Butler said. “I’ll always remember Sadie.”\n\nMrs. Butler was one of more than 100 people who gathered at McCall’s Bronxwood Funeral Home in the Bronx on Thursday night to pay their respects to Mrs. Mitchell, who was killed by stray gunfire last week at the age of 92.\n\nScores of Mrs. Mitchell’s friends walked hesitantly to her open casket, many clutching canes and peering through thick glasses, to say goodbye to a woman who had been a neighborhood pillar since she moved to Williamsbridge in 1955.\n\nMrs. Mitchell was watching television after returning home from an exercise class on the evening of Oct. 20 when a stray bullet shattered her living room window and hit her in the hip before puncturing her lung. She had time to call a neighbor on the phone. “Mrs. Fields,” she said. “I’ve been shot.” She was pronounced dead on arrival at Jacobi Medical Center.\n\nTwo days later, police arrested Jamal Blair, 18, who lived nearby. The police said that Mr. Blair had admitted during questioning that he fired a single bullet from a 9-millimeter pistol during a fight between two rival groups in the neighborhood.\n\nThe Bronx district attorney’s office announced on Wednesday that Mr. Blair would be tried on a murder count, among other charges.\n\nMrs. Mitchell lived in the same tidy, two-story house for 54 years. Her daughter grew up in the house. Her husband, St. Julian Mitchell, died in 1983.\n\nNeighbors called Mrs. Mitchell “the grandmother of the block,” but her gaze extended far beyond East 224th Street. She taught religious classes at Our Lady of Grace Church, and she donated clothes and food to the needy.\n\nThose who paid their respects at the funeral home on Thursday night reflected her life of volunteering. There were nuns with whom Mrs. Mitchell donated food and clothing to the poor. There were teachers who taught religious classes with her. There were members of the North Bronx National Council of Negro Women, a group Mrs. Mitchell helped found more than 40 years ago.\n\n“Everyone loved Sadie,” said Estelle Robinson, who had known her since the 1950s. “She was an all-around good person.”\n\nA funeral is set for Friday morning at Our Lady of Grace Church. Mrs. Mitchell is survived by her daughter, Shahron Williams Van Rooij.\n\nMrs. Mitchell and her husband were among the first black families to move to Williamsbridge, her friends said.\n\nIn those days, “There were just a few houses,” said Mrs. Butler, who moved to the area in 1952. “There were chickens. They used to feed goats on East Gun Hill Road.”\n\nToday, neighbors complain of crime and violence on the streets and outside housing complexes.\n\nMrs. Mitchell belonged to the small community of black Catholics in the area. Her neighbors remembered seeing her walk to church every Sunday for morning Mass. Whether she used a cane or a walker, she always came, said Emaline Loblack, a fellow parishioner.\n\nThe Rev. Levelt Germain, the pastor of Our Lady of Grace Church, one of three people who addressed mourners during the viewing, called Mrs. Mitchell “a pillar of faith.” He said that every Sunday, she brought a bouquet of flowers picked from her garden and placed them at the church’s altar.\n\n“God blessed us with her presence for 92 years,” he said."
