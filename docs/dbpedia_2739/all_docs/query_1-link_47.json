        "text": "INDIANAPOLIS -- Chase Smith had a wise soul and a deep maturity earned from an intense 6-year battle with cancer. His body was scarred with battle wounds from surgeries. His mind was etched with memories of the unrelenting pain.\n\nBut his heart. Chase's heart was pure — and his heart belonged to Sadie.\n\nChase and Sadie (Mills) Smith, who married as high school seniors on April 29, four days after Chase was given just months to live, captivated a nation with their story of raw and extraordinary devotion. They got 11 joy and tear-filled months together.\n\nChase Smith died April 4 at his home with family and his beloved Sadie by his side. He was 19.\n\nKnown for his competitive spirit in the pool as a nationally-ranked swimmer, his loyalty to friends, his adoration of family, Chase was not shy to tell the world of his two greatest loves: Jesus and Sadie.\n\nThe lives and love together: Chase and Sadie's incredible journey of love amid cancer\n\nAs cancer ravaged his body, Chase went to his pastor wearing a backpack filled with chemotherapy. He wanted to know how he could use his cancer to spread God's word.\n\nIn his final days, he lay in bed. Sadie did not leave his side. They would pray for more time together. And if not that, then for peace and comfort for Chase.\n\nOn good days, Chase would get up and make runs for his favorite chicken at Zaxby's or breadsticks at Chicago's Pizza. He'd jump in the car and go joyriding with his cousins. In the evenings, he would go to his second home, the Indian Creek High School pool to swim. He held onto Dubs, an English bulldog puppy he got as a graduation gift from Sadie's parents. But not as tightly as he held onto Sadie.\n\nChase never wanted to leave this earth, he told Sadie. Because being gone would mean leaving her.\n\nA life of strength\n\nChase was born June 4, 2001, just months before the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11. His mom Kelli Smith can remember a few days after, she was holding baby Chase looking out her back window. Cars were lined up to get to the gas station.\n\n\"And I sat there and sobbed thinking, 'What have I brought him into?'\" Kelli said. \"What is going to happen? You just want to protect your babies.\"\n\nShe did protect Chase in every way she could. But she couldn't protect him from cancer.\n\nChase's obsession with swimming started early. His dad, Brad, remembers he and Kelli waking up to their 6-year-old son watching swim videos on Saturday mornings, instead of cartoons. Wearing a Speedo, swim cap and goggles, he would practice flip turns on the sofa.\n\nHe remembers 9-year-old Chase wanting to dress just like Brad, the swim coach at Indian Creek. Chase wore a tie, carried a clipboard and a stopwatch to help his dad coach sectionals that year.\n\nLessons they taught us: Chase and Sadie taught us about love, life and death: 'Take every moment you have'\n\nIn the winter, Chase got to live out that dream, coaching with his dad and sister Kaitlin at Indian Creek.\n\n\"I am so passionate about swimming, my mind goes 100% to it. My mind doesn't allow me to think about anything else other than the kid I'm coaching or the workout I'm writing or the relationship I'm building with someone while I'm here,\" Chase said at a meet in January. \"It definitely is an escape from everything.\"\n\nChase got to coach his cousins Joey and Sam Smith and watch as they competed in sectionals and state. When he received his prognosis, Chase said that was one of the things he wanted to live long enough to see.\n\n\"Growing up, I thought he was the best, which he kind of was,\" said Sam. \"It was just really cool to have somebody to look up to and somebody that I wanted to be and somebody I wanted to be faster than. So it gave me something to work for.\"\n\nChase's mom updates his battle: 'Chemo didn't work, slow down time, tumor growth'\n\nChase got to be there for Sadie's first college diving meet, sitting in front of the 3-meter board as Sadie took first place.\n\n\"I love him with everything that I have. The least I can do in this difficult time is to praise our amazing God, take advantage of the gifts that he has given me,\" Sadie said after that meet, \"and make Chase proud.\"\n\nChase's kind heart was felt by just about everyone he encountered. Brady Brown said Chase was his first friend when he moved to Indian Creek in second grade. Even as Chase got sick, he would never forget to ask about others, said Brady.\n\n\"He's like a brother; he's just there for you whenever you need him no matter what he's going through,\" Brady said. \"He's like the perfect friend.\"\n\nChase was a quiet person who led by example, said cousin Joey Smith. \"He was a leader in every way.\"\n\nChase was powerful, not tall but made of pure muscle, said Kelli, who believes Chase's strength helped him live longer than most thought.\n\nHe was tough, said his grandpa Mark Montgomery.\n\n\"Ever since he was a little bitty kid, you know how grandpas will twist their arm or their finger and make them say 'uncle'?\" said Montgomery. \"I would finally give up before he would give up. His pain tolerance was unreal.\"\n\nNo one knew it then, but that physical and mental fortitude would soon be important in trying to save Chase's life.\n\nOlympic dreams\n\nBy the time Chase was 12, he was a nationally-ranked swimmer, second in the nation for the 100-meter butterfly, 6-time state champion and record holder for the 100-meter individual medley, 100-meter freestyle and three relays at Indian Creek Middle School. His sights were set on the Olympics.\n\nBut in 2014, at a national training camp, Chase's left thigh started cramping. Then, the cramps turned to pain and then he couldn't do a simple leg lift. The Smiths noticed swelling in his left thigh, so much bigger than the right.\n\nAfter coming home from camp, Kelli and Brad took their son to the doctor.\n\n\"He pulled up Chase's X-ray and said, 'Do you see this lighter area?'\" Kelli said. \"'There is a tumor on his femur.'\"\n\nBrad turned white. Kelli ran out of the room and broke down as she called her family.\n\n\"After that, it went like wildfire,\" said Kelli.\n\nChase had Ewing's sarcoma, a rare cancer of the bone and tissues. He started chemotherapy weeks later.\n\nJacob Scott, Chase's radiation oncologist at the Cleveland Clinic, said he looked up to Chase. Even though Chase was much younger, he had a spirit that was infectious.\n\n\"When you see someone like Chase who's living the life he's living and with the purpose that he has, you put your shoes on a little different,\" said Scott in June. \"It makes you better. It forces you to be better in order to match that bravery and match that attitude and then it also makes you grateful. His message and the way he lives his life is a meaningful one and it's a great honor to be part of that.\"\n\nFrom Chase's first battle with cancer to his final one, Dr. Melissa K. Bear saw Chase grow into a thoughtful young man. She called him a kind and gentle soul.\n\n\"I watched him grow with the cancer,\" said Bear, Chase's oncologist at Riley Hospital for Children at IU Health, \"really come into his own as to what he wanted and what was important to him.\"\n\nFor most of his life, it was finding a way to battle cancer and still swim. But that all changed when Sadie came into his life.\n\n'You'll find time'\n\nChase attended Indian Creek and Sadie was a diver at Mooresville High. In 2018, Mooresville invited Indian Creek for a dinner and ice cream social after their swim meet. Chase and Sadie saw each other there, but that's not when they fell in love.\n\nIt was their senior swim season in November. \"I saw her before the meet. I thought she was pretty cute,\" said Chase. He called her over to talk to him, asked for her phone number and they started texting the next day.\n\nThat weekend, Chase was busy. He had two swim meets and an SAT to take. It might not be a good time to go on their first date, he told Sadie.\n\n\"If you're really interested, you'll find time,\" Sadie told him. Chase found time.\n\nFrom that day on, they never went more than 24 hours without seeing one another.\n\nSadie, who finished out her senior diving season Academic All-State, All-State and third in state, loved Chase's maturity and how he genuinely liked doing things with her.\n\nChase said he knew he loved Sadie from the moment he met her, the way she made him feel, the way his fears calmed when she was near him.\n\nEspecially as the cancer returned for the final time.\n\n'It's not good'\n\nSadie sat outside the hospital, the sunshine streaming down, and she cried. People walked by laughing. Her world felt like it was collapsing.\n\n“It's not good,” Chase had just texted her from his appointment June 11.\n\nThe tumors already invading his body had multiplied. One near his esophagus had grown rapidly. There were new tumors on his thyroid and adrenal glands and many more in his right lung.\n\nChase almost never cries at appointments, said Kelli. But as he heard the news, tears ran down his face. When the palliative care doctor told Chase it might be time for hospice, he cried again.\n\nIn July, Chase found out other tumors in his body had grown. But he got to be there Aug. 2 when the pool at Indian Creek was renamed the Chase M. Smith Natatorium.\n\nOn the plaque that will forever hang in Chase's natatorium are the words he spoke shortly after his April prognosis.\n\n\"The precious people in your life, the amount of time they are in your life, take every moment you have,\" he said. \"Enjoy and give everything you can in those relationships and know there is so much possible with love when your love includes God.\"\n\nChase and his family were so tight, but he and his sister Kaitlin, they had a special bond. She was like a second mom to him.\n\n\"We're just fighting for more time,\" Kaitlin said in September. \"And it's hard because you don't know how much time you have.\"\n\nAll Chase wanted was more time with his family -- and especially with Sadie. He wanted things to be perfect again, as they were on their wedding day.\n\nLove story for the ages\n\nChase stood on the driveway where he and Sadie had shared their first kiss. As he watched Sadie come toward him in her simple white dress, he shook his head, smiled and then started crying.\n\nGetting married had been part of the plan they had concocted on the couch during hours-long, deep conversations. Sadie would go to IUPUI for college to continue her elite diving career. Chase would be by her side. An amazing life would unfold.\n\nThe wedding was planned in four days. Through tears and laughs, creating a love story for the ages, the couple kissed to seal their vows on April 29. One of their promises: to spend every moment they have left together. Another: to latch onto their faith and God more than ever.\n\n'You just don't see love like this': With months to live, high school senior marries\n\nThe story of their wedding went viral. A nation fell in love with the story of Chase and Sadie. \"You just don't see love like this,\" Kelli said.\n\nAfter the wedding, Chase and Sadie did dozens of interviews with national media. Through that, Chase did what he had aimed to do. Use his cancer, and now his marriage to Sadie, to spread the word of God.\n\nPeople would sometimes ask Chase how he could believe in God when he was fighting such a horrific cancer.\n\n\"I've seen what a cancer journey looks like when (people) have God by their side and I've seen what a cancer journey looks like when they don't,\" said Chase. \"And to me it's a no-brainer of what I would rather choose. That's just my main goal in life at this point, just to point people to the word of God.\"\n\nBeyond religion, though, Chase taught the world so much more. Just by living — and loving his Sadie.\n\n\"I learned from Chase through this journey every day is a gift and just not waste that,\" said his dad Brad. \"Appreciate every day...enjoy the time that God has given us right there in front of us and make the most of that because we don't know what tomorrow is going to hold.\"\n\nChase's life may have ended up being shorter than others. But, he said he was not shortchanged.\n\nNot many people, after all, find their Sadie.\n\nServices for Chase Smith are pending."
