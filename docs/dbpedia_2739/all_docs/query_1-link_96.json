        "text": "An obsessive \"she devil\" who murdered a love rival in a brutal attack she plotted with a friend has been jailed for a minimum of 30 years.\n\nSarah Williams, 35, stunned Sadie Hartley with a cattle prod and stabbed her 41 times in an \"orgy of violence\".\n\nShe attacked Ms Hartley, 60, at her home in Helmshore, Lancashire, in a bid to win back ex-lover Ian Johnston.\n\nWilliams and accomplice Katrina Walsh, 56, were both found guilty of murder and given life sentences.\n\nWalsh was ordered to serve a minimum term of 25 years for her part in the killing, described by a judge as being \"planned and rehearsed down to the finest detail\".\n\nHe said they plotted to fulfil Williams' desire to rekindle her relationship with 57-year-old Mr Johnston, which he had ended after she became \"possessive and difficult\", jurors heard.\n\nAfter dumping \"obsessive and jealous\" Williams, Mr Johnston began a new life with Ms Hartley - but his ex-lover and her accomplice spent 18 months plotting the \"perfect murder\" to win him back.\n\nWilliams, who described herself as a \"she devil\" and \"little psycho\", had sent Ms Hartley a \"spiteful\" letter in June 2014, claiming she and Mr Johnston had enjoyed \"unbelievably fantastic sex\" behind her back, but it failed to end the couple's relationship.\n\nThe planning that followed was described in court as \"the stuff of spy novels\".\n\nAfter paralysing the \"decent, hard-working\" woman with the cattle prod, Williams, of Treborth Road, Blacon, Chester, stabbed the mother-of-two \"in an orgy of violence\" and with \"demonic savagery\", the court was told.\n\nWalsh helped to hide evidence, including the knife and stun gun used in the attack, at a farm.\n\nSentencing the pair, Mr Justice Turner said Ms Hartley had been \"slaughtered like an animal\" in a manner \"more closely redolent of a clinical assassination than a personal killing\".\n\n\"Doubtless, the features of secret agent-style intrigue carried with them elements of fantasy but this was no harmless world of make-believe,\" he said.\n\n\"It was a game of death.\n\n\"Let no one believe this was a crime of passion. This was a crime of obsession, arrogance, barbarity and pure evil,\" he said.\n\nHe said though Williams wielded the gun and knife, Walsh was a \"willing, sympathetic and energetic confederate right from the outset\".\n\nAs the verdicts were delivered in court, Williams swallowed hard as the forewoman spoke, while Walsh gave a slight nod of her head.\n\nMs Hartley's daughter, Charlotte, 23, wiped away tears as she sat in the public gallery next to Garry Hartley, her father and Ms Hartley's ex-husband, and her brother, Harry.\n\nMr Johnston, sitting a few rows behind them, had tears in his eyes and gave a slight nod as the verdicts came in.\n\nHe broke down once more as he read a statement after the hearing. He said: \"No sentence imaginable could ever replace Sadie and everything she lived for.\n\n\"She was kind, loving, thoughtful, intelligent and the best friend anyone could have. The brutal, evil and cowardly attack perpetrated against this defenceless Sadie tore into our families, friends and communities.\n\n\"There can be no forgiveness for such vile behaviour.\"\n\nSpeaking after the verdict, Ms Hartley's son Harry said: \"Her death has left a huge void and the last few months have been the hardest we could ever have imagined.\n\n\"Mum was a much-loved sister, aunt, friend to many. She was an inspiration to everyone around her - an adventurer who lit up the room. She was perfect.\"\n\nHe added that they \"may have received some justice with a conviction, but it will never be enough to bring our Mum back\".\n\nThe court heard how, on the day of her death, Ms Hartley was at home alone because Mr Johnston was away on a skiing trip in the Swiss Alps.\n\nWilliams, described as a \"bunny boiler\" and \"kept woman\" who was already in a relationship with a wealthy 75-year-old \"sugar daddy\" and having affairs with other men, had a brief fling with Mr Johnston.\n\nKatrina Walsh's diaries chronicled, as she put it, \"the excitement of plotting the perfect murder\".\n\nIn one entry, 17 months before the crime, she wrote: \"Sarah came round so got caught up in endless murder plots for Ian's other half.\"\n\nIn June 2015, she continued: \"Seriously talking of getting rid of her opponent ... she does seem to be a totally evil b****.\"\n\nTwo months later, she wrote: \"Wow, I may get to be instrumental in helping remove the awful woman! This may happen. Wow! Am unexpectedly excited by it. Was buzzing so much I needed a Southern Comfort to wind down a bit.\"\n\nIn September 2015, she referred to thoughts of \"a hit\" on a motorcycle, and also wrote of using the flag of so-called Islamic State \"to mislead the investigation\".\n\nWalsh noted she did not want to be involved at the \"sharp end\", adding: \"I have no moral qualms, just a serious don't let us get caught twinge.\""
