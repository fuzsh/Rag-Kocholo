        "text": "SENECA, S.C. (FOX Carolina) - Funeral services were held Sunday for 3-year-old Sadie Grace DeRose.\n\nSadie sadly passed away on Tuesday, Feb. 20 following a tragic fire at her home in Seneca.\n\nRELATED: Upstate child flown to burn center following fire in Oconee County\n\nThe funeral was open to the public at Seneca Baptist Church and allowed family to receive anyone from the community that has been touched by Sadie’s story.\n\nSadie’s father, Zach DeRose, read a touching speech in her honor during the service.\n\n“When this all started, I made a promise to Sadie that I would walk her to the door when this life was over. I’m here to see through that promise- to walk my baby girl to the door,” Zach DeRose said through tears.\n\nTom Stephens also spoke at the service about his beloved granddaughter and the unexpected moments of beauty that emerged since the devastating fire.\n\n“Dealing with this nightmare has contained many very beautiful moments,” Stephens said.\n\n“Hugs from strangers in the hotel lobby, strangers who have themselves lost children, from others around town and in this church- in this very room,” Sadie’s grandfather continued.\n\nZach DeRose also acknowledged the blessing he feels that Sadie did not ultimately die inside the house when it caught fire.\n\n“That she was able to die in a hospital at peace surrounded by her family- that means so much,” her father said.\n\nTo send flowers or a memorial gift to the family of Sadie, click here.\n\nA GoFundMe has also been created to help with Sadie’s medical bills, funeral arrangements, and immediate needs and permanent housing for the family.\n\nMORE NEWS: Spartanburg landmark named 2024 James Beard America’s Classics winner"
