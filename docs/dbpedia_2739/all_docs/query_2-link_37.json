        "text": "DOVER â€“ A 17-year-old girl killed Friday night in a Dennis boat crash has been identified as Sadie Mauro, who was set to become a senior at Dover-Sherborn High School.\n\nThe crash happened in Sesuit Harbor in Dennis. Massachusetts State Police said six people were on the boat when it crashed into a jetty. A teenage boy was also taken to Cape Cod Hospital with a head injury.\n\n\"I will be hugging my children extra tight this evening - I am sure you will do the same,\" Superintendent Beth McCoy said in a letter to families.\n\nThe high school library will be open Monday from 10 a.m.-12 p.m. for students and faculty to gather. Counselors will be available and service dogs will also be on hand.\n\nPrincipal John Smith said in a letter to families that the school community is \"devastated and heartbroken.\"\n\n\"Sadie's smile could light up a room, she had a heart of gold and the sweetest spirit,\" Smith said. \"She had such a strong sense of self and had a love for adventure and anything outdoors. A hardworking student and great athlete, Sadie was genuine and effortlessly kind.\""
