Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe perceived humidity level in Devrekani, as measured by the percentage of time in which the humidity comfort level is muggy, oppressive, or miserable, does not vary significantly over the course of the year, remaining a virtually constant 0% throughout.\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in Devrekani\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in DevrekaniJanFebMarAprMayJunJulAugSepOctNovDec0%0%10%10%20%20%30%30%40%40%50%50%60%60%70%70%80%80%90%90%100%100%Mar 170%Mar 170%Aug 41%Aug 41%comfortablecomfortabledrydryhumidhumid\n\ndry 55Â°F comfortable 60Â°F humid 65Â°F muggy 70Â°F oppressive 75Â°F miserable\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground.

Those scores are combined into a single hourly composite score, which is then aggregated into days, averaged over all the years in the analysis period, and smoothed.\n\nOur cloud cover score is 10 for fully clear skies, falling linearly to 9 for mostly clear skies, and to 1 for fully overcast skies.\n\nOur precipitation score, which is based on the three-hour precipitation centered on the hour in question, is 10 for no precipitation, falling linearly to 9 for trace precipitation, and to 0 for 0.04 inches of precipitation or more.\n\nOur tourism temperature score is 0 for perceived temperatures below 50Â°F, rising linearly to 9 for 65Â°F, to 10 for 75Â°F, falling linearly to 9 for 80Â°F, and to 1 for 90Â°F or hotter.\n\nOur beach/pool temperature score is 0 for perceived temperatures below 65Â°F, rising linearly to 9 for 75Â°F, to 10 for 82Â°F, falling linearly to 9 for 90Â°F, and to 1 for 100Â°F or hotter.\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nThe growing season in Devrekani typically lasts for 5.6 months (172 days), from around May 1 to around October 21, rarely starting before April 8 or after May 21, and rarely ending before September 28 or after November 10.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in Devrekani\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in Devrekanigrowing seasonJanFebMarAprMayJunJulAugSepOctNovDec0%100%10%90%20%80%30%70%40%60%50%50%60%40%70%30%80%20%90%10%100%0%May 150%May 150%Oct 2150%Oct 2150%May 2190%May 2190%Sep 2890%Sep 2890%Apr 810%Apr 810%Nov 1010%Nov 1010%0%Feb 60%Feb 6Jul 29100%Jul 29100%NowNowfreezingvery coldcoldcoolcomfortablewarmfrigid\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nBased on growing degree days alone, the first spring blooms in Devrekani should appear around May 4, only rarely appearing before April 17 or after May 20.\n\nGrowing Degree Days in Devrekani\n\nGrowing Degree Days in DevrekaniJanFebMarAprMayJunJulAugSepOctNovDec0Â°F0Â°F500Â°F500Â°F1,000Â°F1,000Â°F1,500Â°F1,500Â°F2,000Â°F2,000Â°FMay 490Â°FMay 490Â°FJul 26900Â°FJul 26900Â°FNov 11,801Â°FNov 11,801Â°FDec 311,825Â°FDec 311,825Â°FNowNow\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy experiences extreme seasonal variation over the course of the year.\n\nThe brighter period of the year lasts for 3.2 months, from May 16 to August 23, with an average daily incident shortwave energy per square meter above 6.5 kWh.

Within 10 miles contains significant variations in elevation (2,854 feet). Within 50 miles contains large variations in elevation (8,455 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Devrekani is covered by cropland (84%) and grassland (10%), within 10 miles by cropland (47%) and trees (30%), and within 50 miles by trees (53%) and cropland (20%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Devrekani, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 3 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Devrekani.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Devrekani according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at Devrekani is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Devrekani and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nSinop Airport (LTCM, 39%, 75 mi, northeast, -3,497 ft elevation change)\n\nCaycuma (LTAS, 29%, 106 mi, west, -3,153 ft elevation change)\n\nAnkara EsenboÄa International Airport (LTAC, 33%, 111 mi, southwest, -479 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Devrekani and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
