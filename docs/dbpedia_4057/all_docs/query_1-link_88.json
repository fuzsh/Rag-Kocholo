        "text": "Küre Mountains National Park\n\nAll aspects of natural life in the Küre Mountains National Park (Küre Dağları Milli Parkı) is under protection. It stretches over 34,000 hectares of forest land and is situated within the borders of Kastamonu and Bartın. In 2012, the National Park, which has many canyons, karst caves, waterfalls, and a rich flora and fauna, has received the PAN Parks Certificate (European Wilderness Society) Küre Mountains National Park hosts 40 of the 130-mammal species, and more than thousand plant species of Türkiye.\n\nKüre Mountains National Park is karst topography. As such, it has countless caves, deep canyons and waterfalls. The Valla Canyon (Valla Kanyonu), the Ilgarini Cave (Ilgarini Mağarası), the Ilıca Waterfall (Ilıca Şelalesi) and the Horma Canyons (Horma Kanyonları) are on top of these spectacular formations.\n\nThe Valla Canyon\n\nThe Valla Canyon (Valla Kanyonu) is located 20 km away from the Pınarbaşı District of Kastamonu. It starts at the crossroad of the Devrekani River and the Kanlıçay River and proceeds 12 km towards Cide where cliffs are varying between 800-1300 meters in height. The canyon can be reached after passing a 15 km long road through the forests. As it is dangerous, it is required to acquire permission, and take a professional guide, and special equipment to pass the canyon. Valla Canyon and its scenery are worth to be seen from the wooden sightseeing platform. The canyon has rugged scarps which are home to eagles, vultures, hawks, and many more wild beasts.\n\nThe Azdavay Çatak Canyon\n\nOne of the world's largest canyons, the Çatak Canyon (Çatak Kanyonu), is located in the Azdavay District of Kastamonu. In order to get to the glass sightseeing terrace at 450 m height, you need to travel 6 km by car, and then to walk for 1 km along the trekking route. The view from the glass terrace is worth all difficulties.\n\nIlgarini Cave\n\nThe cave, which is located 36 km away from Pınarbaşı District and within the Küre Mountains National Park (Küre Dağları Milli Parkı), can be accessed over a steep slope through the forest. With a total length of 850 m, and a depth of 250 m, the Ilgarini Cave (Ilgarini Mağarası) is Türkiye's fourth-deepest cave.\n\nGizemli Cave\n\nIt is located 19 km from the district, in the Alçılar Village in the midst of the forest. It took its name \"Foggy and Mysterious Cave\" from its natural structure, and the visual feast provided by of stalactites and stalagmites.\n\nIlıca Waterfall\n\nThe Ilıca Waterfall is located 12 from the Ilıca District, and at the top of the Horna Canyon (Horna Kanyonu). The water falls about 15 m into a natural pool, which is surrounded by an exotic appearing rich variety of vegetation.\n\nWorldwide Fund for Nature titled the Pınarbaşı District and its Ilıca Waterfalls (Ilıca Şelaleleri) as Türkiye's gift to nature.\n\nHorma Canyon\n\nLocated downstream the Ilıca Waterfalls (Ilıca Şelaleleri), Horma Canyon (Horma Kanyonu) is a frequently visited place for nature lovers. You will be captivated along the 3,500 m trekking route, which was prepared in order to ease the stay in the canyon and find it difficult to withstand the natural pool at the exit of the canyon, which is reminiscent of the Dead Sea (Ölü Deniz).\n\nAbana - Kastamonu\n\nAbana’s total coastline along the Black Sea is 11 km. The highest point of the district is at an altitude of 300 m. A large part of the district is comprised of mixed woodland (chestnuts, pines, and oaks), shrubbery, heathland, cliffs, and inhabited area. To its west, the Ezine and İlişi Rivers (Ezine ve İlişi Nehirleri) meet, and to its east the Hacıveli and Kuğu Rivers (Hacıveli ve Kuğu Nehirleri) run through steep slopes and canyons to reach the sea. These are ideal places for picnics and excursions. The old planes in the Harmason Neighbourhood are worth seeing. With the Iğrava Cave (Iğrava Mağarası) and the Karabalçık cave above south, and the Hacıveli Bay in its east, which was once a sanctuary for pirates, as well as the Siyelik Rocks (Siyelik Taşları) are among its rare natural beauties.\n\nAbana has campgrounds and accommodations to offer. There are a lot of trekking routes, which have become a popular sport in recent years. Especially the hiking area in the mountain is highly preferred.\n\nThere are also beaches suitable for swimming. The best time to swim in the sea of Abana is between July and August. Also, a 3-day Sea Festival is held at the end of the month July."
