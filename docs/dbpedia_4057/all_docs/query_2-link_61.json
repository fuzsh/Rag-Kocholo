        "text": "The Mediterranean Red List assessment is a review of the conservation status at regional level of approximately 6,000 species of animals and plants. This report summarizes the results for a key group of Mediterranean biodiversity: saproxylic beetles. Despite their key role in the ecosystem´s health and food chain, saproxylic beetles are still largely misunderstood and the current information gaps on these species´ population status, trends, and distribution are a reflection on how little we still know about them. The geographical scope followed for this assessment is the Mediterranean region according to the Mediterranean Basin Biodiversity Hotspot, with the exception of the Macaronesian islands, which have not been included in this study. All the obligate saproxylic beetles endemic or almost endemic to the Mediterranean region – 320 species and 1 subspecies – are included.\n\nBased on the available literature, collections, public surveys and field observations a current and historic distribution map for stag beetle Lucanus cervus in Belgium is compiled. The site preferences are analysed by comparing the distribution with habitat, geographic, climatic and soil data. The adults are mainly found in June and July, male sightings peaking before females. The species is present in the Campine, Loam, Condroz, Fagne-Famenne-Calestienne, Ardenne and Lorraine ecoregions. The distribution is limited by soil type and mean temperatures but not by annual rainfall. The soil needs to be deep, well-drained and loamy or sandy and the mean January temperatures should be between 4.0 and 6.1 °C. We believe the species declined in the past century but this is only clear for the population in Brabant which was well studied from historic till recent times. The species appears to be no longer present in the region of Antwerp. The preferred habitats are urban areas, forests and fo...\n\nThe olive tree is perfectly adapted to the Mediterranean region, where it represents high economic, social, and landscape importance, olive orchards being an important repository of biodiversity. The order Coleoptera encompasses families that provide important ecosystem services, such as pest limitation. The objective of this work was to compare the assemblage of families of Beetles between the olive grove and their surrounding semi-natural landscape in Trás-os-Montes. The ground beetles on four olive groves and their adjacent shrubland areas were sampled using pitfall traps near Mirandela (Northeastern Portugal) in May and June of 2015 and 2016. Anthicidae, Staphylinidae, and Scarabaeidae dominated the community. The richness of the families was significantly greater in the olive grove in both years of study. On the contrary, the overall diversity did not significantly differ. In both years, the complementarity between the areas was low, reflecting similar communities in terms of f..."
