        "text": "dc.description.abstract The Pontides orogenic belt (Ketin, 1966), is the central portion of an extensive belt running from western Bulgaria (Rhodope Mountains) through northern Turkey to the Caucasus. Three tectono-stratigraphically different sectors can be distinguished: the Western Pontides (Istanbul zone), the Central Pontides and the Eastern Pontides (Sakarya zone). The Central Pontides, located between the Izmir-Ankara suture to the south and the Black Sea to the north is the geographical term for the arched central part of the Pontides orogenic belt (Fig. 1.1). The Central Pontides is one of the well preserved areas where the late Early Cretaceous juxtaposition of the Western Pontides (Istanbul Zone) and the Eastern Pontides (Sakarya Zone) (Okay and Tüysüz, 1999; Tüysüz, 1999) can be observed (Sengör and Yilmaz, 1981). Four main units are comprised in the Central Pontides: two major tectonic units, the Devrekani metamorphic unit (Eurasian-derived basement) and the Çangaldag arc complex separated by two oceanic basins, the Küre and the Domuzdag-Saraycikadag complexes. The study area is marked by the Çangaldag arc complex, and numerous granitoids and associated volcanics collectively called the Kastamonu granitoid belt (KGB) (Yilmaz and Boztug, 1986), that pierced the imbricated Palaeotethyan continental and oceanic basement assemblage. The Kastamonu belt documents large scale, multi-episodic magmatism, formed in response to subduction of the Palaeotethys and the subsequent late orogenic tectonics. The occurrence of these plutons and ophiolites in the Central Pontides has attracted geologists for several decades, because of their importance in understanding Palaeotethyan evolution, and the Tethysides-Variscides connection. However, data necessary to identify the type and origin of all the intrusions are not available. On the basis of stratigraphic correlation and a few K-Ar data earlier workers assigned Middle Jurassic emplacement time to all the plutons of the KGB. In an attempt to elucidate the petrogenetic and magmatic evolution of this belt, zircons from Deliktas, Sivrikaya and Devrekani granitoids and their basement have been analyzed by means of Pb-Pb evaporation and U-Pb isotope dilution combined with isotope and geochemical data. Geochemical compositions, isotopic data and geochronological constraints are presented and interpreted for the evolution of the Palaeotethys in the Central Pontides. The Late Carboniferous Sivrikaya granitoid (SG) comprises biotite-hornblende granodiorite, tonalites and minor two-mica granites. Sivrikaya rocks are slightly metaluminous to peraluminous, and transitional to S-type (ASI= 0.9 to > 1.1). The rocks are characterized by variably low initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios [Sr(i)= 0.705 - 0.708], moderate eNd(t) values (-1 to -3.8) and young Nd-model ages (TDM= 0.75 - 1.05 Ga), suggesting variable degrees of mixing between mantle and crustal components. Chondrite-normalized (cn) rare earth element (REE) patterns are characterized by fractionation between the light (LREE, [La/Yb]cn= 9 - 49) and heavy REEs (HREE, [Gd/Yb]cn= 0.79 - 2.37) and no to strong Eu depletion (Eu/Eu*= 1.19 - 0.18). All these characteristics, combined with moderate d18O(whole-rock) values (10 - 11.6 per mil) point to dehydration melting of heterogeneous amphibolites-metagreywackes-type sources with variable mantle contribution. The Early Permian Deliktas leucogranite (DLG) is host to muscovite-bearing monzogranites. Deliktas rocks are strongly peraluminous S-type granites (ASI >1.1), as reflected in the mineralogy that includes highly aluminous phases such as muscovite and cordierite. DLG samples exhibit strongly fractionated REE patterns ([La/Yb]cn= 3.6 - 35), rather flat HREE ([Gd/Yb]cn= 0.59 - 0.78) and small positive to distinct negative Eu- anomalies (Eu/Eu*= 1.15 - 0.42) suggesting melting of metapelitic-type source with residual plagioclase and/or high degree fractional crystallization. Rocks from this intrusion have high Sr(i) ratios (0.7103 - 0.7123) and low eNd(t) values (-2.2 to -5.0), indicating an arc underlain by a mature continental crust. Nearly constant d18O(whole-rock) values (~11.5 per mil) and old Nd-model ages (TDM= 1.2 - 2.2 Ga) of the rocks, in conjunction with the geochemical characteristics further support material contribution from mature continental crust in their genesis. The Middle Jurassic Devrekani pluton (DG) consists of metaluminous I-type (ASI= 0.55 - 0.88) hornblende-biotite diorites and tonalites. The samples have low Sr(i) ratios (0.705 - 0.706) and very low negative eNd(t) values (-0.8 to -2.2). These features together with the low d18O(whole-rock) values (7 - 9 per mil), very high Mg# values, young model TDM ages (1.04 - 1.6 Ga) and high CaO/Al2O3 ratios suggests dehydration melting of mafic lower crustal rocks, and/or derivation from amphibolite-type source with significant upper mantle-derived material input. DG rocks are further characterized by moderately fractionated REE patterns ([La/Yb]cn= 2 - 11), flat HREE patterns (Gd/Yb)cn= 1.35 - 1.68) indicating garnet and zircon accumulation. The high Sr/Y ratios (10-37), no to distinct positive Eu-anomalies (Eu/Eu*= 0.72 - 0.95), and Sr-spikes, indicate plagioclase accumulation. These geochemical characteristics indicate magmas derivation from an enriched mantle and/or metasomatized mantle sources with minor crustal contamination. It is suggested that, after the Cimmeridgian continent collided with the south Eurasian margin subsequent slab break-off and flip in subduction polarity, resulted in asthenospheric upwelling and the production of the near primary melts of the Devrekani pluton. The melts en route to higher levels interacted or not with mantle- and crustal-derived magmas. It can be concluded that the Middle Mesozoic magmatism was initiated by the brief southward subduction of the Küre marginal basin (e.g. Ustaömer and Robertson, 1997) beneath the newly formed Late Carboniferous orogen (e.g. Okay et al. 2006). The mineralogy and geochemistry of the rocks distinct from those closer to the Black sea coast, and their location in the far south of the Küre ophiolite, the similar WSW-ENE orientation of the Devrekani pluton and the major thrust system that resulted from the gravitational collapse, indicate a juvenile stage of a subduction system (Nzegge et al. in review). Because the intrusion is late syn-tectonic with respect to the shear fabric it is reasonable to assume that its generation in some way is related to the extension-collapse events. According to Dewey (1988) large volumes of mantle partial melts are injected into the lower crust during gravitational collapse of mountain chains by detachment faulting. I speculate that during this collapse event the geotherm crossed the garnet-lherzolite solidus and mafic melts were produced. The melt had little interaction with the felsic upper crust, accumulated plagioclase, and intruded in the shear zones, giving rise to the Devrekani I-type pluton. Geochronologic analyses yielded ages ranging from 295-270 Ma for DLG, and 303-300 Ma for SG and in the south of the belt DG 190-165 Ma. Zircon xenocryst ages as old as ~2.7 Ga provide evidence for Proterozoic protolith, and highlights the association of the Central Ponitdes with Laurasia and Gondwana. The 360-340-320 Ma episodes of Pb loss in zircons are indicative of Variscan metamorphism. These new geochemical and age data from the Sivrikaya, Deliktas and Devrekani granitoids indicate the evolution of the Kastamonu magmatism from tholeiitic to calc-alkaline to tholeiitic compositions with time. Furthermore, the presence of Late Palaeozoic pre- to post-collisional, transitional to peraluminous granites and Middle Mesozoic juvenile arc (post-collisioinal) rocks challenges previous evolution models for the Kastamonu granitoid belt and the Central Pontides. The data presented herein underlines the complex thermo-tectonic history of the Central Pontides, and the magmatism associated with a “long-lasting” northward and a “short-lived” southward subduction of the Palaeotethys respectively during the Palaeozoic and Mesozoic times (proposed model), and the subsequent crustal growth processes (collision-accretion of Gondwanan-derived continental fragments with Laurasia). The Precambrian-Palaeozoic Eurasian-derived basement (Devrekani metamorphic unit) of the Central Pontides is exposed between the Küre and Çangaldag complexes. Evidence of the Precambrian basement in the Central Pontides comes from a Büyükçay sample (BÜ-20, ortho-amphigneiss, ~502 Ma), from inherited zircons (U-Pb upper intercept ages) and Nd isotope data. Probably the BÜ-20 zircons crystallized in the Late Cambrian-Early Ordovician magmatic event as part of the wide-spread subduction-related magmatism in the Gondwana-derived terranes (e.g. Linnemann et al. 2000 and the references therein). en"
