        "text": "When Ariana Grande’s seventh album, eternal sunshine, released this March, perhaps nobody was more surprised than Haleluya Hailu.\n\n“I knew I wanted to name my EP after Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind back in 2021,” the Vancouver musician recalls over a video call. “I got a call from my buddy, like, ‘Yo, Ariana Grande stole your idea!’ But I’m happy, because at that point we knew we weren’t going to name it Eternal Sunshine. I think that was too on the nose for me; I couldn’t get away with it.”\n\nHailu loves the film for its misunderstood, “deeply fucked up” core dynamic between the two main characters.\n\n“How many times have they had their memories erased? Are they destined to be together because they’re so terrible to each other?” she ponders. “You can break the cycle! You don’t have to be doing this—or you can be, if you make an attempt to better yourself. It’s just a weird emotional place.”\n\nThat sounds like a good summary of what Hailu went through while working on this latest project, which chronicles two years spent attending college in Nelson, BC. The move from the city to a small town, combined with a healthy dose of mental health wobbles and friendships that didn’t quite work out, provided ample fuel for the record—as well as Hailu’s live band, Their Fake Friends.\n\nSo a couple of weeks after Grande’s first album in four years came out, Hailu’s own project dropped: the raw, similarly lower-case eternally, yours. But that’s where the similarities end.\n\nReleased on 604 Records, the seven-track EP winds its way between different genres, never quite settling on one beyond that nebulous catch-all of indie rock. It’s stuffed with hooks, clap-along drums, and echoes of the mid-noughties era that spawned the semi-eponymous manic pixie dream girl movies.\n\nHailu cites the music they loved growing up as some of their biggest influences: Lady Gaga and Britney, but also the “Hot Topic-core pop rock” trinity of My Chemical Romance, Fall Out Boy, and Panic! at the Disco. Weezer and Blur hold a special place too, as do their friends who introduced them to the local music scene in their teen years.\n\n“I was really lucky to have a group of delinquent friends that got me into the Vancouver indie scene,” she recalls. “A friend of mine snuck out of her parents’ house and got to go see Peach Pit before Peach Pit was really big, and I had a really big God complex about caring about Peach Pit when I was in high school, before they got super-duper big. There are plenty of bands that I feel really lucky are still around in the Vancouver scene that I’ve been obsessed with since I was 13 or 14.”\n\nSome of those influences are clearer than others. “Walmart” has slow-jam funky bass and Pixies-style backing vocals, while “heavyweight” has an expansive, radio-friendly chorus tempered by Hailu’s pared-back, dreamy delivery. It wouldn’t be a stretch to imagine “let me be sentimental” on the Garden State soundtrack, or Ramona Flowers bleaching and dyeing her hair to the strains of “MANIC PIXIE PACIFIST”.\n\nThat anchor track, the only explicitly romance-related song on the record, was inspired by a “Top 10 Hall of Fame worst ex-boyfriend” who told Hailu how “cool and alternative” she was. He inspired the title before she had any lyrics or melody. “I thought it was like a silly, goofy, shit on my ex-boyfriend who sucked one time, and now it’s one of the bigger songs off the record,” they laugh. “It’s been a delight. Being a hater always pays triple the amount.”\n\nRather than trying to fit into any one niche, Hailu flits like a magpie between the things she’s drawn to. From emo, they embraced a journal-style approach to lyricism mixed with a distinctly Gen-Z sense of humour: “I double-down on things I think I said but never meant/I tell my therapist I blame it on the government,” she sings wryly on the growing-pains closer “postal code”. It’s a song that tumbles over itself to build to a lush, layered climax, undercut with the revelation that “maybe I am just another one of everybody.”\n\n“I think I’ve lowered my own expectations, because I was like, well, I’m just another indie artist,” Hailu reflects. “That’s what the ending point of the project is: figuring out that you are not special, necessarily. You have to make yourself special.”\n\nThe record contains multitudes. It’s too refreshing to be sad girl melancholia; too raw to be radio-friendly rock; too lush to be dreamy bedroom pop. But it’s still cohesive, drawn together with a message for everyone who is figuring out how to make it on their own.\n\n“I think the last couple of years, people locked in too much on being a manic pixie dream girl,” Hailu offers. “That’s not good! Don’t be a manic pixie dream girl. Don’t let a man be the main character in your life. It should be you.”\n\nHailu isn’t really eternally, yours; she is eternally her own."
