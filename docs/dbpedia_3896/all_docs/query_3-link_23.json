        "text": "Girl Of My Dreams is an album of New Orleans Style Jazz featuring the Fone Jazz Makers.\n\nIt starts with Darktown Strutters’ Ball by Shelton Brooks. A happy song from the early 20th Century. Catchy and easily remembered. It sounds just like the ideal album opener. Girl Of My Dreams, the title track was a popular waltz song of the Twenties and in more recent years had an important role in the movie Angel Heart. The New Orleans style musicians of the Fone Jazz Makers transformed it into a fox-trot.\n\nThe recording was produced and recorded by Giulio Cesare Ricci at the Teatro Comunale dei Concordi in Campiglia Marittima (LI). He used Neumann U47 and M49 tube microphones, advanced microphone pre-amplifiers Nagra Audio, Nagra 4s Analog Tape Recorders and line, microphone and supply cables designed by Signor Ricci.\n\nThe Original Analog Master Tapes were transferred from the Nagra 4s directly to Stereo DSD.\n\nWith this recording, Giulio Cesare Ricci wanted to give the listener a unique experience. It is as if the listener was sitting on an armchair positioned in the ideal position of the theater listening to this fine live recording of New Orleans Style Jazz. In this position, the depth, width, and height of the sound can be highly appreciated.\n\nFone Jazz Makers\n\nVittorio Castelli – Clarinet & Vocal\n\nAndrea Sirna – Tenor Sax & Vocal\n\nGiacomo Marson – Trumpet\n\nNino Frasio – Sousaphone\n\nGiorgio Alderighi – Banjo\n\nAbout NativeDSD Music\n\n• NativeDSD Music is the largest highest-resolution audio download store for DSD and DXD music, with over 3,200+ Albums from over 90 Record Labels.\n\n• Verified high-res audio sources: DSD 64, DSD 128, DSD 256, 352.8 kHz (DXD), 384kHz and other high rate PCM, or Analog Tape Transfers direct to DSD or DXD.
