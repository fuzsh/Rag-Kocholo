        "text": "The song \"Girl Of My Dreams\" by Guti is a passionate declaration of infatuation and the intoxicating effects of love. The lyrics describe a deep attraction to a girl who embodies the singer's ideal of beauty, with a particular emphasis on physical appearance, as indicated by the reference to 'pretty girls with skinny waists.' The song conveys a sense of urgency and desire to spend time with this person, suggesting that the singer values the present moment with her over any future considerations.\n\nAs the song progresses, the repeated lines 'Your love's got me high, baby girl / I'm addicted and I'm never coming down' emphasize the overwhelming and addictive nature of the love he feels. This metaphor likens the experience of love to a euphoric high, one that the singer is not willing to give up. The repetition of these lines throughout the song reinforces the depth of the singer's infatuation and the hold that this love has on him.\n\nThe lyrics also touch on themes of commitment and comparison, as the singer promises to be 'better than the next few.' This suggests a competitive aspect to love, where the singer feels the need to assert his superiority over potential rivals. Despite the bravado, there's an underlying vulnerability in the admission that they've both lied awake, hinting at moments of doubt or uncertainty in their relationship. Overall, the song captures the heady mix of desire, addiction, and the highs and lows that come with being deeply in love."
