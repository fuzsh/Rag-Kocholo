        "text": "Jade’s ‘Angel Of My Dreams’ sent the internet into meltdown, with an intricate video that offered throwbacks to different aspects of her career.\n\nOut now, the song is a bold solo statement, one that allows Jade Thirwall to wipe the slate clean, and move beyond her role in record-breaking girl group Little Mix. She told BBC Newsbeat recently: “I’m ready to give some pop girlie drama”.\n\nPraising ‘Angel Of My Dreams’, CLASH said of the single:\n\nSelf-described as “a huge pop punch to the face” this is a single that out-paces both her former band mates and much of her UK peers – in a pop landscape that is increasingly safe, and void of experimentation, Jade has graffitied her name all across the rule book.\n\nThe full video was shot by director Aube Perrie and it contains some key Easter eggs – here’s five…\n\n—\n\n—\n\nJade’s scarf is a callback to her South Shields roots\n\nIn the opening scene Jade is seen walking around East London, with a maroon football scarf on. Naturally, many immediately leaped to the conclusion that it must be nearby West Ham United – but they’d be wrong.\n\nThe scarf is actually South Shields FC, where Jade is one of the club’s honorary Presidents – alongside former local MP David Miliband, believe it or not.\n\nHer X Factor audition gets a reference\n\nLittle Mix were famously an X Factor success story, an example of the talent show getting the mixture right, and providing a platform for those talents to flourish. Not one to miss a trick, Jade goes back to where it all began, and mixes this audition tape with footage of her performing as a child.\n\nThe home video footage is slightly tweaked, however – she’s shown performing her debut solo single, ‘Angel Of My Dreams’.\n\nThe Jade Room gets a shout-out\n\nJade recently launched an online space for fans to congregate, called – ingeniously – The Jade Room. A tongue-in-cheek flip of the Shade Room, it’s become a ready-made community, an example of the internet at its most creative, and positive.\n\nThe reporters in one scene are shown using microphones emblazoned with the Jade Room logo.\n\nThere’s a meaning to the chip shop\n\nIn one scene, Jade is shown eating a box of chips in the street. Shot in East London, the shop behind her is actually Perfect Fried Chicken, a local chain with branches dotted around Hackney.\n\nThe box, however, is quite different – it references Colman’s fish and chips, a chain of fish and chips restaurants in the seaside town of South Shields.\n\nWTF is Grian Chatten doing here?\n\nYep, that really is Fontaines D.C. frontman Grian Chatten in the background, wearing a lime green tracksuit, and later some angel wings. But how – in the words of David Byrne – did he get here…?\n\nAs it transpires, director Aube Perrie also worked on Fontaines D.C. video ‘Starburster’ – and if you look closely in that video, you’ll also see Jade Thirwall in the background.\n\nSo, he’s simply repaying the favour – and it’s sent fans into a tizzy.\n\n—"
