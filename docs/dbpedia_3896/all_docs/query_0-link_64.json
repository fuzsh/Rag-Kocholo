        "text": "Red Velvet's 'In My Dreams' is a poignant exploration of unrequited love and the solace found in dreams. The song's lyrics convey a deep yearning for a love that is only reciprocated within the realm of dreams. The repeated line 'In my dreams, you love me back' serves as the heart of the song, emphasizing the contrast between the dream world and reality. The dream sequences are described with vivid imagery, such as dancing in the air and walking on clouds, which symbolizes the lightness and joy the narrator feels when immersed in their dreams. The mention of candy-like eyes and ticklish voices adds to the dreamlike, almost fantastical quality of these moments.\n\nHowever, the song also touches on the pain of awakening from these beautiful illusions. The lyrics '돌아갈래 / 꿈속의 널 찾아 I’m going mad' translate to a desire to return to the dream, to the point of madness, indicating a deep reluctance to face the harshness of reality where the love is not returned. The mention of a broken promise and scattered petals suggests a past relationship or moment that has since shattered, leaving the narrator clinging to the fragments within their dreams. The plea '이대로 don’t wake me up / 달콤하게 날 속여줘' which means 'like this, don’t wake me up / sweetly deceive me' reveals a conscious choice to remain in the deception of dreams rather than confront the pain of unreciprocated feelings.\n\nRed Velvet, known for their versatile music style that ranges from pop to R&B and electronic music, often incorporates emotional depth into their songs. 'In My Dreams' is no exception, as it captures the bittersweet nature of longing and the escapism that dreams provide. The song resonates with anyone who has ever found comfort in the imagined scenarios of their mind, where the outcomes are as sweet and perfect as they desire. It's a testament to the power of dreams as a refuge from the disappointments of reality, and a reminder of the enduring hope for love that is deeply human."
