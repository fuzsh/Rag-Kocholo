        "text": "Praised by leading outlets like TIME, Wonderland, Harper’s Bazaar, Interview Magazine, GQ, NME, The Guardian, and more, FLETCHER hails from Asbury Park, New Jersey, where she cultivated her passion for music and her unforgettably candid storytelling. In 2019 she released her debut EP you ruined new york city for me. The widely lauded EP features her breakthrough hit “Undrunk,” a track that spent several weeks on the Billboard Hot 100, scored the #1 spot on Spotify’s Viral Chart and emerged as the fastest-rising song at pop radio from a new artist in the past five years. Released in September 2020, FLETCHER’s EP THE S(EX) TAPES hit No. 1 on iTunes across all genres and drew praise from outlets like Teen Vogue, SPIN, PAPER, GQ, and more while the EP’s gold-certified lead single “Bitter” is fast approaching 200 million global streams. FLETCHER continues her triumphant run with recent singles “girls girls girls,” — a bold reimagining of Katy Perry’s iconic “I Kissed a Girl” (released with Perry’s early stamp of approval) — and “Cherry” featuring trailblazing pop star Hayley Kiyoko. The intimately detailed and intoxicating tracks cemented FLETCHER’s status as one of her generation’s most fascinating queer icons. Over the years, FLETCHER has sold out several headline tours and landed impressive slots at major festivals. Her recent 2022 headline tour of North America and Europe sold out within minutes of going on sale. FLETCHER was also nominated for a GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Breakthrough Music Artist and landed on Forbes’ 30 Under 30 list for 2022. To date, FLETCHER’s television performances include “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” “TODAY,” and “Ellen.” She will release her debut album this fall via Capitol Records."
