        "text": "Jade’s highly anticipated solo single “Angel of My Dreams” is out now, and the pop star has loads to say about how it came to life. Jade shares the challenges she faced in the music industry as a solo artist and in a group, her future music, potential collabs with Raye and Tove Lo, a possible Little Mix reunion in the future and more!\n\n​​Jade:\n\nWhen you’re in a girl band, everybody just tries to compare you. It’s just natural. So you kind of have to get used to that. But we had each other to support each other through everything. So, you know, this is essentially me starting again so I don’t even know yet what it feels like, fame wise, on my own.\n\nHi! It’s ​​Jade, and you’re watching Billboard News.\n\nMeghan Mahar:\n\nI’m here with ​​Jade. ​​Jade, welcome.\n\n​​Jade:\n\nThank you, very excited to be here.\n\nMeghan Mahar:\n\nWe are so excited to have you and so excited to dive into your new era and new song called “Angel of My Dreams.” Can you tell us about the song? What was the inspiration behind it?\n\n​​Jade:\n\n“Angel of My Dreams,” I would say is about my kind of love/hate relationship with the music industry which, as you know, I’ve been a part of for quite some time. So I have a lot to say about that — good and bad. “Angel of My Dreams” is kind of like a love letter to the industry of how obsessed I am with it, how much I love it. But with that comes, you know, some trials and tribulations.\n\nMeghan Mahar:\n\nDid you know that this was going to be the single as soon as you wrote it?\n\n​​Jade:\n\nI’ve been writing for, like, two and a half years. I knew I hadn’t quite landed on the song yet.\n\nKeep watching for more!"
