        "text": "Good morning, Cullman! If this song doesn't make you feel good, you should make an appointment with your doctor because something is wrong! It's a classic feel-good love song with Hall & Oates singing their usual brand of hip swaying, up-tempo music.\n\nHall and Oates\n\nFrom their official website, www.hallandoates.com\n\nSince the 1970s, Daryl Hall & John Oates have sold more albums than any other duo in music history.\n\nFrom the mid-’70s to the mid-’80s, the duo would score six #1 singles, including “Rich Girl,” “Kiss on My List,” “Private Eyes,” “I Can’t Go For That (No Can Do),\" “Maneater”and “Out of Touch” from their six consecutive multi-platinum albums.\n\nDaryl Hall’s latest project is a multi-award-winning monthly web series (and MTV Live show), Live from Daryl’s House (www.livefromdarylshouse.com). “It was a light bulb moment,” he says of the show’s genesis. “I’ve had this idea about just sitting on the porch or in my living room, playing music with my friends and putting it up on the Internet “ Live from Daryl’s House is also aired weekly on MTV Live every Thursday at 11 pm EST/8pm PST.\n\nimage: Legacy Recordings"
