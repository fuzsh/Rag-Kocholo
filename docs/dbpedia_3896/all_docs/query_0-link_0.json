At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from professional publications, the album received a weighted average score of 73, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[7]\n\nShannon Garner of Clash called the album a \"chaotic, unfiltered project that unpacks and tackles insecurities head-on\" and \"an intense rollercoaster of supercharged pop but even in its painful moments, the record radiates an undeniable hope\". Garner named Girl of My Dreams \"Fletcher’s most revealing and revelatory body of work to date\" which \"solidifies her position as more than just a queer artist\".[8]\n\nWriting for Pitchfork, Dani Blum was more critical, stating that Fletcher's songwriting on Girl of My Dreams \"hides behind concerted confessions\" and she \"assigns clunky labels to her emotions without interrogating or even fully articulating them\". Blum opined further that \"there are shards of intriguing ideas buried in the album’s plodding acoustics and garish rock-pop confections, but Fletcher fails to excavate them\" and derided the album's tracklist as a collection, concluding that \"the women at the center of these songs are flat, blank spaces: The only concrete image she provides is a Taylor Swift shirt crumpled on an ex’s floor\".[12]\n\nTrack listing\n\n[edit]\n\nCharts\n\n[edit]\n\nChart performance for Girl of My Dreams Chart (2022) Peak\n\nposition Australian Albums (ARIA)[15] 42 Austrian Albums (Ö3 Austria)[16] 75 Belgian Albums (Ultratop Flanders)[17] 16 Belgian Albums (Ultratop Wallonia)[18] 66 Dutch Albums (Album Top 100)[19] 35 German Albums (Offizielle Top 100)[20] 45 Irish Albums (IRMA)[21] 77 New Zealand Albums (RMNZ)[22] 9 Scottish Albums (OCC)[23] 18 UK Albums (OCC)[24] 44 US Billboard 200[25] 15\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
