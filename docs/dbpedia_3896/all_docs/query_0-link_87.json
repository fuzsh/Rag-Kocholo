        "text": "Olivia Rodrigo probably never imagined that a drive through the suburbs would become a rallying cry for anyone who's ever mourned a relationship. But when she released her debut single, the racing power ballad \"drivers license,\" in January 2021, suddenly she had the biggest song in the world.\n\n\"drivers license\" broke streaming and chart records upon its release, debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and inspiring memes across social media. While it wasn't exactly uplifting — Rodrigo vividly details the devastation of trying to move on from an ex, and laments the milestones they were supposed to celebrate together — the song became universally celebrated, sending listeners into a nostalgic haze of first heartbreaks. Everyone was screaming, crying and dancing at the same time.\n\n\"drivers license,\" one could say, is the latest centerpiece of \"sad girl\" pop — the specific aesthetic of artists who write songs through a dreamy, yet raw lens of rage, pining, heartbreak or rejection. The music itself creates a spectrum of emotions where you might want to sway at one point, but scream like Zach Braff and Natalie Portman at the rock quarry in Garden State at another.\n\nThough Rodrigo is one of the stars at the center of \"sad girl\" pop, it had been percolating long before the explosion of \"drivers license.\" After all, artists like Fiona Apple and Alanis Morrisette were the poster girls for it in the mid-to-late '90s. But one could argue that this iteration of \"sad girl\" pop found its roots in the 2010s, thanks to artists like Lana Del Rey, whose palpable aching and loneliness became inescapable anthems like \"Video Games\" and \"Summertime Sadness\"; Taylor Swift, whose first crossover success Red spawned the still-heart-wrenching fan favorite \"All Too Well\"; Robyn, who created the ultimate crying-at-the-club banger \"Dancing on My Own\"; and MARINA, care of the depressed-Barbie era of her album Electra Heart.\n\nEven with all of its origins, \"sad girl\" pop didn't truly begin to form its own sort of subgenre until Billie Eilish and her whispery, gloomy music emerged in 2016. Others have steadily begun following suit: Sasha Alex Sloan emerged with a debut EP aptly titled Sad Girl two years later; Gracie Abrams' intimate, diaristic tracks served as major inspiration for Rodrigo (who later recruited Abrams as a tour opener); Tate McRae has turned her insecurities into aspirational, sad-pop anthems like \"she's all i wanna be.\"\n\nWhile \"sad girl\" pop isn't exactly new (most music trends are cyclical, of course), the way that people are clinging to it is. \"There's a cliche about pop that it represents a retreat from reality, an escapist fantasy world where listeners get to leave their fears and anxieties in a vision of Katy Perry's 'Teenage Dream' or fun.'s 'We Are Young,'\" says Nate Sloan, host of Switched on Pop and assistant professor of musicology at USC Thornton School of Music. \"But modern listeners — especially young people — are pushing back against that paradigm, celebrating artists like Billie Eilish, Halsey, and girl in red, who don't shy away from the troubles of the world but sublimate them into their music.\"\n\nTheir music, in turn, helps them cope with their own \"lived realities.\" It's equal parts celebration of the artist and found community for someone who, in a world away, relates.\n\nWhich is why the rise of \"sad girl\" pop feels synonymous with the current state of the world. To varying degrees, we've all endured the trauma of a pandemic that hasn't ended, particularly the mental and emotional toll of isolation and anxiety that has transpired. There's also been the weight of police brutality, school shootings and the impending death of democracy for people to bear. Finding comfort in nostalgia — especially within pop culture — was natural for many.\n\nSome retreated to the music, TV or films they listened to when they were teenagers, while others sought relief in music that evoked the feeling of being young and carefree. It's also why recent vulnerable, melancholy pop tracks became such a balm — and ultimately solidified the power of \"sad girl\" pop.\n\nBut the group that seems to be drawn to this niche pop aesthetic are teenagers. It makes sense: Gen Z is coming of age at a time when there's less of a stigma around discussing mental health. Celebrities and artists are arguably more open than ever about their struggles — Shawn Mendes, for instance, has often shared his battle with anxiety, sharing a super honest message with fans in April; Selena Gomez opened up about her bipolar diagnosis in 2020, and launched a multimedia company dedicated to mental health this year.\n\nAnd it isn't just young women dominating this niche area of pop. Male artists like Conan Gray, Dean Lewis, Jeremy Zucker and Lewis Capaldi are delivering bedroom pop anthems ranging from angsty to wistful, overall unafraid to showcase raw vulnerability. Their music has proven to similarly resonate, with Capaldi's pained breakup ballad \"Someone You Loved\" hitting No. 1 on the Hot 100 in 2019 and Dean Lewis' \"Be Alright\" reaching No. 1 on Billboard's Adult Pop Songs chart that same year.\n\nRead More: How James Bay Found The Courage To Be Vulnerable For New Album 'Leap'\n\n\"Shame is gradually being removed, so people are talking more about their feelings and their mental health — and audiences can relate to it,\" says Jodi Milstein, MA, LMFT, LPCC, music therapist.\n\nWhen their emotions are reflected back to them in a song by a public figure, sometimes that's the key to getting help and seeking therapy. \"A lot of times, we can't tell people, 'you need to do this, this and this to feel better.' We just have to set an example,\" Milstein explains.\n\nGen Z is much less filtered than other generations, and more candid about their own mental health struggles, as a 2018 survey by the American Psychological Association and a 2019 report by the American Psychiatric Association showed. And it's not uncommon to see them pouring their hearts out on TikTok or Instagram. But their connection to hyper-vulnerable music is also the result of where they are in their lives. Because their brains are still developing, they \"tend to have a more difficult time modulating their emotions,\" says Sloan.\n\n\"At the same time, they feel things more deeply than adults might, especially music,\" he continues. \"Studies have shown that the developing brain creates strong neural pathways between music and emotion in the teenage years, so that the music we listen to at that phase of our lives tends to stay with us, no matter how far we get from that period.\".\n\nDespite the lyrics — or even the mood — of the artist, \"sad girl\" pop is no different than other subgenres of music. \"What's true of 'sad girl' pop is true of all music: it's essential to try and hear a piece of music as expression, not fact,\" Sloan adds.\n\nIn other words, girl in red may be singing about depression in \"Seratonin,\" but it doesn't mean that the listeners themselves are depressed. They could be, but they could also find catharsis or joy in hearing someone detail a similar experience. And at a young age, especially, there's so much power in being seen and heard by a song.\n\n\"Several studies have shown that when listeners listen to sad music, they can experience [it] as if it was kind of empathizing with them,\" says Jonna Vuoskoski, associate professor in music cognition at the University of Oslo. \"Music is almost like a virtual friend.\"\n\nBut while the music is resonating, there is a flipside to \"sad girl\" pop. The label, which has helmed the conversation around this music, can be diminishing to the artists who are pouring their feelings into these songs. Despite all of the aforementioned artists whose vulnerability has helped their listeners heal, filing music under \"sad girl\" writes off a person's — particularly a woman's — emotional trauma as something not to be taken seriously.\n\nIt can also glorify the idea that it's \"cool\" to be sad, which is rarely the intention of these artists. When it comes down to it, their songs are about as personal and vulnerable as one could get. They're creating deeply moving material — and an importantly deep connection with those who listen.\n\n\"They're speaking up for themselves — they're setting limits or setting boundaries,\" says Milstein. \"On Instagram and Tik Tok, people get on there and will say, 'Hey, this happened to me, and I'm not gonna deal with this anymore.' People have been more expressive. You see other people actually talking about [this] stuff, which before you didn't see that.\"\n\nFrom Abrams to Rodrigo, these artists aren't singing about their insecurities and pain for cachet: They're simply young women (and men) trying to navigate young adulthood. What they're sharing is courageous — and should they decide to move out of the \"sad girl\" box they've been placed in, we should be ready to grow with them.\n\nHow Tate McRae Turned A \"Full Identity Crisis\" Into Her Debut Album, 'I Used To Think I Could Fly'\n\nSabrina Carpenter is the first to admit that it's taken her a bit of time to find her way to the top of the music industry. She even likens herself to the tortoise in the fable \"The Tortoise and the Hare\" — even if she didn't want to believe the metaphor growing up.\n\n\"Something that my mom always said to me as a little girl that really annoyed me was that I am the tortoise… throughout my life, [I was] being told, 'Sabrina, you're the tortoise, just chill,'\" Carpenter recalled while accepting the Variety Hitmakers Rising Artist Award in December 2023. \"In moments of frustration and confusion it can feel like a letdown, but it turns out it's actually a very good thing.\"\n\nIt's been a very good thing for Carpenter, indeed. A decade since the release of her debut single, the singer/songwriter isn't just breaking through — she's one of pop's new reigning queens. Over the last year, Carpenter has nabbed her first No. 1 song on the Billboard Hot 100, made a stellar debut at Coachella, and performed on \"Saturday Night Live,\" all the while racking up billions of streams on her music new and old. It's all built excitement for one of the most anticipated pop albums of the summer: Short n' Sweet.\n\nAs Carpenter unveils her new album, take a deep dive into her decade-long journey to pop stardom.\n\nGetting Started: Disney Breakthrough\n\nGrowing up, Carpenter filled the sounds of her family home in Pennsylvania with covers of songs like Adele's \"Set Fire To The Rain\" and \"Picture to Burn\" by future Eras Tour companion Taylor Swift (more on that later). After submitting videos for a singing contest spearheaded by Miley Cyrus, Carpenter would get her first taste of success. Placing third, she caught the eye of Hollywood Records, who signed her following the competition.\n\nSimultaneously, Carpenter also began pursuing acting, landing guest spots on series like \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\" in 2011 and joining \"The Goodwin Games\" in 2012. In 2014, she landed a lead role in the Disney Channel series \"Girl Meets World,\" a spin-off of the beloved '90s series \"Boy Meets World,\" which served as a breakthrough moment for the burgeoning star — and a catalyst for her music career.\n\nJust before the show debuted, Carpenter released her debut single, \"Can't Blame A Girl for Trying,\" the title track to her debut EP that arrived a month later. While the four-track EP was the typical output of a teenage Disney star — bubblegum pop sounds with digestible, family-friendly lyricism — it showed off her youthful timbre and offered themes that would become prevalent later in Carpenter's songwriting: love, heartache, and navigating life.\n\nA year later, she released her debut album, Eyes Wide Open. A mix of pop with folk and country influences — a soundscape that remains on Short n' Sweet — Carpenter's debut showed maturity and growth following Can't Blame A Girl For Trying; songs like \"Eyes Wide Open\" and \"We'll Be the Stars\" showed a more introspective side, reflecting on the pressures of being in the spotlight and the journey of finding her identity. Eyes Wide Open also hinted that Carpenter was beginning to hone her songwriting skills, penning four of the 12 tracks.\n\nIt would be on her 2016 sophomore album, EVOLution, where Carpenter would find confidence as a songwriter, co-writing all but one song on the 10-track project. In turn, the lyrics reflected her growing sense of self and a new perspective on past themes, like embracing non-romantic forms of love in \"All We Have is Love,\" being there for a struggling friend in \"Shadows,\" and learning to assert boundaries in \"Space.\"\n\nEVOLution transitioned Carpenter out of the teen pop aesthetic into a more sophisticated sound, experimenting with dance-pop and techno sonics. Genre versatility would become a throughline of sorts for Carpenter, and EVOLution foreshadowed the multifaceted musicality that was to come.\n\nShedding Disney: From Child Actor To Pop Star\n\nAfter \"Girl Meets World\" came to an end at the beginning of 2017, Carpenter was ready for reinvention. Much like Britney Spears' Britney and Cyrus' Can't Be Tamed before her, as Carpenter grew into an adult, she felt like she needed to shed the Disney-fied image that has become a rite of passage for teen stars. Thus began the Singular era.\n\nReleased in 2018 and 2019, respectively, Singular: Act I and Singular: Act II featured songs that were more risqué and mature in nature. A far cry from her tamer work of the past, the R&B track \"Hold Tight\" is equal parts sultry and evocative with Carpenter singing, \"Wanna keep you in, wanna keep you in right/ Wanna feel your skin, wanna feel it on mine.\"\n\nAs she noted in an interview with Billboard, Singular: Act I was a natural progression for a girl now in her late teens — even if it was against the squeaky-clean image of her beginnings.\n\n\"I was known as a fictional character on television with lines that were written for her with an attitude that was portrayed in a way by other people. So for a lot of people, their first impression of me was as a 13-year-old girl [singing] the kinds of songs that she should be singing,\" she said. \"Then, flash forward to 19, and people are asking why I am not singing about the same things that I did when I was 13, as if that's normal.\"\n\nOne of the more notable Singular tracks is from Act I, \"Sue Me.\" Sneakily disguised as a story about a romantic relationship, the song is Carpenter's response to being sued by her ex music managers: \"That's my shape, I made the shadow/ That's my name, don't wear it out though/ Feelin' myself can't be illegal.\" Its tongue-in-cheek and snarky nature would inevitably embolden Carpenter to continue writing more confessional songs with attitude, whether she's responding to media scrutiny in \"because i liked a boy\" from 2022's emails i can't send, or warning a suitor to be careful in Short n' Sweet's \"Please, Please, Please.\"\n\nSingular: Act I and Act II further helped demonstrate different facets of Carpenter's musicality, with the former leaning into pop tendencies and the latter embracing an R&B flair. And as her final albums with Hollywood Records, she used Singular: Act I and Act II to indicate that she wasn't going to let any sort of previous perceptions hold her back. Their coming-of-age themes showcased Carpenter as an artist coming into her own — regardless of whether listeners wanted to keep her in the Disney box or not.\n\nReintroducing Herself: Artistic Authenticity & The \"Nonsense\" Effect\n\nWhile the world was going through a period of change amid the COVID-19 pandemic, so was Carpenter. She signed with Universal Music Group's Island Records in 2021, and soon she would be able to fully introduce the world to who Sabrina Carpenter is as an artist.\n\nAs she noted herself to Variety earlier this year, her 2022 LP, emails i can't send, \"marked the beginning of a really freeing and artistic time for me.\" Once again, she co-wrote every song on the album; this time, though, she only had one co-writer for each track, and even wrote two songs solo (\"emails i can't send\" and \"how many things\") — proving that she was more assured as a songwriter than ever.\n\nAs a result, Carpenter's knack for confessional songwriting is on full display. emails i can't send represents a reflective time capsule of sorts; one that brings the curiosity of her earlier work with the perspective and wisdom of a young adult. Her growing fame meant there was more attention on her personal life, and emails i can't send allowed her to reclaim her narrative and express her side of the story.\n\nCarpenter's candidness struck a chord with listeners, and upon the release of emails i can't send in July 2022, it was clear Carpenter was on a new trajectory. The album debuted at No. 23 on the Billboard 200, which marked her highest entry on the chart to date (as of press time); the 2022 stretch of her Emails I Can't Send Tour sold out in less than a day. And once \"Nonsense\" was released as a single that November, her place as a rapidly rising star was solidified.\n\n\"Nonsense\" was initially written as a means to an end after Carpenter was writing a sad song and had writer's block. Now, the track is the epitome of Carpenter's lyricism, weaving together her wit and humor with an infectious hook. First gaining traction on TikTok because of its catchiness, it's become a beloved part of Carpenter's canon thanks to her inventive and bespoke outros during her live shows. It's since become a tradition for fans to check to see what outro she created for each performance, adding to the fan fervor.\n\nCarpenter further satiated fans' taste for her cheeky lyricism in March 2023, when she released emails i can't send fwd:, the deluxe version of her album, which featured a new track called \"Feather.\" She took the playful, flirting energy of \"Nonsense\" and infused \"Feather\" with buoyant, airy production that mimics the feeling of self-liberation after moving on from a relationship. Earning Carpenter her first pop radio No. 1, \"Feather\" proved that the singer's audacious style was taking hold — and it set the stage for an even bigger 2024.\n\nBecoming A Superstar: Eras Tour, \"Espresso\" & Beyond\n\nAfter her own extensive — and very sold out — tour in support of Emails I Can't Send, Carpenter's rising star status was further confirmed by pop's current queen, Taylor Swift. The singer earned a coveted opening slot on Swift's monumental Eras Tour in Mexico, South America, Australia, and Asia.\n\nJust after her last Eras Tour show in March 2024, Carpenter hinted that her own new era was beginning. \"I'm starting to feel like I've outgrown the songs I'm singing,\" she admitted to Cosmopolitan, \"which is always an exciting feeling because I think that means the next chapter is right around the corner.\"\n\nThat chapter began with \"Espresso,\" which dropped a day before her debut Coachella performance. Doubling down on the playful, self-assured vibe of \"Nonsense,\" the song immediately hinted that big things were coming for Carpenter, debuting at No. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked at No. 3.\n\nUpon announcing her sixth album, Short n' Sweet, Carpenter released \"Please Please Please.\" Combining her now-signature playful, carefree lyricism with an airy, disco-tinged sound, \"Please Please Please\" didn't just present Carpenter as a confident superstar — it became her first Hot 100-topping smash.\n\nCarpenter has referred to Short n' Sweet as the \"hot older sister\" of emails i can't send. \"It's my second 'big girl' album; it's a companion but it's not the same,\" she explained to Variety, to whom she also admitted she feels a \"sense of separation\" from her work prior to emails. \"When it comes to having full creative control and being a full-fledged adult, I would consider this a sophomore album.\"\n\nIt's apt, then, that her Short n' Sweet collaborators — including songwriters Julia Michaels, Amy Allen and Steph Jones — are largely the same as the team from emails i can't send. \"I've really honed in on the people that I love making music with,\" she told Rolling Stone in June.\n\nEven more telling of the direction she's heading is her work with one of pop's hottest producers — and Swift's right-hand man — Jack Antonoff, for the first time. At a GRAMMY Museum event with Antonoff himself, Carpenter debuted the country-infused \"Slim Pickins,\" presenting yet another pop style from Short n' Sweet. And as \"Slim Pickins,\" \"Espresso\" and \"Please Please Please\" indicate, Carpenter's knack for infectious and edgy lyrics isn't just the throughline across Short n' Sweet — it's become the epitome of both her artistry and her stardom.\n\nJust like her metaphorical friend the tortoise, Carpenter's long but steady journey has clearly paid off. As she's figured out who she is on her own terms, she's manifested the bonafide superstardom she's always imagined.\n\n\"I never had the plan B, and it wasn't even a thought in my mind that it wouldn't work out,\" she told Rolling Stone. \"I just always knew it was about not if it would happen but when it would happen.\"\n\nFor Carpenter, every chapter of her artistry has built on the last; she's refused to rest on her laurels and continuously pursued new directions. She's creating work that wholeheartedly reflects her, and growing a loyal fan base because of it. Her next album might be named Short n' Sweet, but her time as a pop superstar will be anything but.\n\nAll Things Sabrina Carpenter\n\nIn a time where pop balances between intimate vulnerability and brazen confidence, queer pop stars like Chappell Roan, Billie Eilish, Reneé Rapp, FLETCHER, and girl in red are spearheading a movement of their own: the lesbian pop renaissance.\n\nThe unofficially coined cultural craze has seen a number of queer women sing openly and explicitly about their same-sex relationships. And they're not holding back: \"She was a Playboy, Brigitte Bardot/ She showed me things I didn't know,\" swoons Roan in \"Red Wine Supernova,\" while Eilish gushes \"she dances on my tongue\" in \"Lunch,\" and FLETCHER confesses in \"girls, girls, girls\" that she \"kissed a girl and…really, really liked it.\"\n\nThis era of openly sapphic joy follows a history of hardships, with decades of queer artists defying prejudice and homophobia to sing openly about their desires and emotions. It's not been an easy journey — and struggles are still painfully evident. When grilled about her sexuality last year, Eilish declared on Instagram, \"I like boys and girls leave me alone about it\"; it echoed Dusty Springfield's 1970s interview when she revealed, \"I'm perfectly capable of being swayed by a girl as by a boy... and I don't see why I shouldn't.\"\n\nSome have defined sapphic pop as a subgenre of indie or bedroom pop, and others have celebrated the more anthemic, upbeat \"sapphic bops.\" But in reality, no one style of music encapsulates lesbian/sapphic songs; these artists are united by loving and desiring other women — some openly, while others were restrained due to societal pressures.\n\nThe current wave of unapologetic queer stars marks a pivotal moment in music history, where sapphic pop is no longer cornered in lesbian circles and gay clubs, but dominating mainstream airwaves, and influencing global pop trends while being rightfully celebrated by the masses. So as the current queer female stars continue to thrive, it's important to pay homage to all of the artists that paved the way.\n\nRead on for a history of defiantly queer women and nonbinary people in music — a celebration of who they are, how they have loved and their remarkable musical imprint.\n\n1950s: A Ranchera Folk Queer Pioneer\n\nCosta Rican artist Chavela Vargas began singing in Mexican cantinas as a teenager in the 1950s, becoming a key figure of Mexico City's bohemian artistic boom. With slick, short hair and a powerful presence, Vargas sang regional Mexican music with hoarse fragility in her songs, including \"Las simples cosas\" and the haunting \"La Llorona\" (which means \"The Weeping Woman\"); her sobbing voice echoing the song's grieving protagonist.\n\nWith love songs addressed to women and an androgynous sense of style, Vargas never hid her sexuality, but first openly spoke about her lesbianism when she was 81. Before her death in 2012 at the age of 93, she lived a fascinating and exuberant life, was a friend and lover of Frida Kahlo and is rumored to have had flings with the likes of Ava Gardner. With her heart-wrenching vocal command, she is considered one of the most important artists in Latin American folk, and remains a towering figure in Latin American queer history.\n\n1960s: A Fearless Pop Star\n\nDecades before female musicians began openly embracing their sexuality, Dusty Springfield cooly shrugged at rumors about her own — her aforementioned 1970 \"coming out\" interview solidifies her status as one of the first openly queer female pop stars.\n\nRising to fame in the 1960s with her blonde beehive and dark eye makeup, Springfield frequented London gay clubs at the height of the Swinging Sixties (which, ironically, didn’t have anything to do with queerness). With hits including \"You Don't Have To Say You Love Me\" and \"Son of a Preacher Man,\" her powerful voice channeled emotion with unnerving vulnerability. Though her music was never quite as frank as she was in the public eye, a few of Springfield's later releases touched on queer themes (1979's \"Closet Man\" and her 1989 collab with Pet Shop Boys, \"In Private\").\n\n1970s: Feminist Folk & Funk\n\nThe second-wave feminist movement in the U.S. pushed gender issues to the core of the country's socio-politico agenda, including fights for abortion rights (Roe v. Wade in 1973) and the ferocious push to pass the Equal Rights Amendment. Women artists were showing they were more than pop glam, picking up guitars and refusing to dress up for the cameras, favoring casual attire; sapphic pop was entering an era of authenticity and emotional honesty. Along the way, a group of feminist lesbians set up Olivia Records.\n\nIn 1975, Olivia's co-founder Cris Williamson released her politically charged folk album, The Changer and The Changed, one of the highest-selling independent records of the time; two years later, Linda Tillery's funk-soul track \"Womanly Way\" explored the sensual side of sapphic love: \"I think I'd like to get to know you in a special kind of womanly way\" she croons. Pioneering trans sound engineer Sandy Stone was an integral part of the Olivia team until she was forced to leave after receiving harrowing threats from separatist groups, sadly marking the steady decline of the groundbreaking label.\n\nIn the UK, Joan Armatradingattracted buzz after performing gigs around her native Birmingham, earning fans for her slick guitar, melodic piano and powerful vocals. Though her lyrics were gender-neutral, Armatrading's music was largely embraced by the lesbian community — including the 1978 song \"Taking My Baby Up Town,\" which celebrates queer love despite the prejudice and homophobia of the time (\"You kissed me/ And then all the people started to stare/ We started a commotion/ Someone making comments, morals/ The state of affairs and I said, \"What we got is the best\"). In 2008, she performed on Cyndi Lauper's True Colors Tour, which raised funds for LGBTQIA+ charities; she has spoken openly about her sexuality in the past decade, and has been in a civil partnership with Maggie Butler since 2011.\n\n1980s: Love, Lust & Rock and Roll\n\nThe '80s brought a spirit of punk into the mainstream, and queer circles were attracted to the music's rebellion and rage. British-Canadian singer Carole Pope was part of the rock band Rough Trade, characteristically clad in leather and singing raunchy songs dedicated to the joys of BDSM and girl-on-girl eroticism. Rough Trade's lustful 1980 song \"High School Confidential\" shocked listeners at the time: \"It makes me cream my jeans when she comes my way,\" swoons Pope. In 1981, she had a brief (but intense) relationship with Dusty Springfield.\n\nA new folk movement was quietly brewing in the hushed tones and poignant strums of Tracy Chapman. Though she has never spoken publicly about her sexuality, her GRAMMY-winning hit \"Fast Car\" has been embraced as a lesbian anthem for its ideals of escapism and unhinged freedom. (Chapman's sexuality was later confirmed by her former lover, author Alice Walker, who spoke about their mid-90s relationship in 2006, though there's no disclosed relation to \"Fast Car.\")\n\nFolk-rock duo Indigo Girls, who are both openly lesbian, formed in 1985 and immediately cultivated a cult queer following that led to a major label deal in 1988. Their 1989 self-titled album — which spawned the celebrated queer anthem \"Closer to Fine\" — went double platinum in the U.S. and won a GRAMMY for Best Contemporary Folk Recording in 1990. Just this year, the duo released a documentary, It's Only Life After All, which charts their journey, revealing the homophobic snubs they've stoically endured throughout their career.\n\nMeanwhile, South AfricanBrenda Fassie began making music with her band the Big Dudes in the early 1980s, combining pop with hip-hop and kwaito. While Fassie did not explicitly sing about being queer, she often referred to herself as a lesbian and never hid her relationships with women. A staunch anti-apartheid campaigner, Fassie made pop with powerful social commentary; she was even hailed as the \"Madonna of the Townships\" for her brazen lyrics. Thought to be Africa's first openly queer pop star, Fassie remains a beacon of acceptance and tolerance in a region where homophobia is still rife — even two decades after her passing.\n\n1990s: Intimacy Resonates\n\nBuilding on the folk origins of Chapman and Indigo Girls, k.d. lang initially broke through with several country hits in the late '80s, but ruffled feathers with country radio when she came out as a lesbian in 1992. Nonetheless, she never backed down from who she was, and it launched her to sapphic pop stardom. Lang's alluring stage presence and a sensual masc charm helped her score a global hit with 1992's \"Constant Craving,\" which has been cited as an ode to lesbian love. The song won a GRAMMY for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance in 1993 — the same year she posed for a steamy Vanity Fair photoshoot with Cindy Crawford, which goes down in the lesbian history books.\n\nIn the late '90s, teenage twins Tegan and Sara picked up guitars and began performing confessional acoustic songs with big pop hooks and grunge elements (1999 track \"Proud\" features empowering lines such as \"Freedom and blood/ I make my mark and fight for tomorrow… I'm proud to be me\"). Their unapologetically queer music videos were intentional in their push for inclusion, complete with same-sex make-out scenes featuring LGBTQIA+ actors. The sisters, both openly lesbian, had a cameo in the cult lesbian series \"The L Word,\" and their nonprofit Tegan and Sara Foundation promotes for LGBTQIA+ equality by raising funds for health care programs, summer camp and more.\n\n2000s: Pop Gets Gayer\n\nThe 2000s marked a shift away from the acoustic confessionals of the decades prior, with a move into club beats and big pop hooks. Queer band the Gossip, starring charismatic, rebellious frontwoman Beth Ditto, broke all expectations of what pop could be and look like, with punk chords, disco beats and a belting voice. Their 2005 smash hit album, Standing in the Way of Control, confronted the marginalization and fear experienced by the queer community. The album's titular song was written in resistance to George Bush's attempt to outlaw same-sex marriage; \"Standing in the way of control/ You live your life/ Survive the only way that you know,\" screamed Ditto.\n\nBefore developing a synth-pop sound on later albums, Chile's Javiera Mena carved emotional, melodic songs on her keyboard with her 2006 debut, Esquemas Juveniles; the album featured heartfelt love songs like \"Camera Lenta,\" which eschewed pronouns to sing about \"the different paths to your eyes\" in Spanish. Though she became more explicit with her sexuality in the 2010s — particularly on the lesbo-erotic hit \"Espada\" — Mena has been recognized as one of the pioneers in Latin America's LGBTQIA+ movement, alongside Ricky Martin, Kany Garcia and Pabllo Vittar.\n\nLondon teenager Elly Jackson, better known as La Roux, immediately broke onto the pop scene with her smash \"Bulletproof,\" and attracted a queer following for her androgynous looks — a refreshing anecdote to the chart dominance of hyper femme pop-stars of the time. While Jackson initially eschewed any labels, not wanting to be confined to queer audiences and baffled by the public speculation on her sexuality, she later embraced her place as an LGBTQIA+ icon (her 2014 track \"Cruel Sexuality\" appears to address her own journey: \"Cruel sexuality / Am I a fool to let you trouble me?\").\n\n2010s: Mainstream Breakthrough\n\nThe 2010s marked a significant push for marriage equality, with same-sex marriage rights being awarded in countries like the U.S., UK, Argentina, Germany, and Australia, among others. This movement for equality was paralleled by a growing visibility of LGBTQ+ representation in pop culture — and sapphic pop was beginning to resonate more than ever before.\n\nL.A.-bred trio MUNA released their indie pop debut, About You, in 2017, loaded with heartfelt songs that helped the trio quickly cultivate a die-hard following of queer fans. Listeners identified with the band's rebellion about heteronormative tropes and coming-of-age queer songs like \"It's Gonna Be Okay, Baby\" (\"Your gonna move to New York, and experiment with communism/ Go down on a girl/ After reading her some Frantz Fanon\").\n\nAnother bisexual indie darling (and MUNA's eventual \"Silk Chiffon\" collaborator), Phoebe Bridgers, also released her debut in 2017. Titled Stranger in the Alps, the album navigated toxic relationships, as well as Bridgers' experiences with women, with queer fans gravitating toward her unprecedented bisexual representation.\n\nA year later, Bridgers teamed up with fellow LGBTQIA+ stars Julien Baker and Lucy Dacus to form the supergroup boygenius. The trio has flipped the \"boy band\" trope on its head, showing that masculine heartthrobs can emerge from feminine fluidity. With lyrics that delve into queer love and heartbreak — and live shows featuring plenty of onstage making out — the band has had a seismic impact on the sapphic pop landscape (and won three GRAMMYs in the process).\n\nIn the mid-aughts, U.S. pop star Hayley Kiyoko was experimenting with her artistry following the split of being in girl group The Stunners. Reintroducing herself as a solo star in 2013, Kiyoko had the freedom to explore lyrical themes that were more true to her own experience — like her 2015 breakthrough hit, \"Girls Like Girls.\" The song, and accompanying music video, cemented her place in the queer pop canon; which Kiyoko has followed up with several songs about queer love and relationships, including \"What I Need\" featuring Kehlani (who came out as lesbian in 2021 and has since explored her own sapphic narratives, like 2020's \"Tangerine.\")\n\nAfter hinting at their sexuality with the breakup song \"Talia\" in 2017, King Princess, who is genderqueer, went all-in on their queerness with the laid-back indie love song \"Pussy is God\" in 2018. Since then, they've built a cult following with songs marked by blatant honesty in a shifting age of gender identity and sexual expression — like 2022's \"Sex Shop,\" which contemplates the use of strap-ons and binders.\n\nMeanwhile, pansexual and nonbinary artist Janelle Monaédonned vagina-shaped pants for their symbolic video \"Pynk,\" their 2018 sapphic sex anthem from Dirty Computer — a queer afro-futurist album that rebelled against the conservative policies of the then-incumbent Trump administration (\"If you try to grab my pussy cat/ This pussy cat grab you back\" they spit on \"I Got The Juice\"). The album's accompanying science-fiction film featured Monaé playing an android on the run with a lover, played by Tessa Thompson. Monaé's went even more explicitly queer in follow-up album The Age of Pleasure, a hedonistic kaleidoscope of funk, pop and reggae (\"I like lipstick on my neck, leave a ticky hickey in a place I won't forget,\" they flirt on \"Lipstick Lover\").\n\n2020s: Sapphic Pop Explosion\n\nThough we're only four years into the 2020s, the decade has been marked by an explosion of sapphic pop. New Jersey pop star FLETCHER helped kick off the movement in 2020 with her EP The S(ex) Tapes, which navigated the end of a lesbian relationship through dark pop hooks loaded with sensual energy. Two years later, she doubled down on the lesbian narrative with her debut album, Girl Of My Dreams, which spawned one of the most viral queer songs of the decade this far, \"Becky's So Hot.\" (In between, she delivered another lesbian bop alongside Kiyoko with 2021's \"Cherry.\")\n\nNorwegian indie star girl in red, who is openly queer, cultivated a huge online following after the release of standalone early singles (in the track \"i wanna be your girlfriend,\" she sings, \"Oh Hannah… I don't wanna be your friend/ I wanna kiss your lips\"), before releasing her highly anticipated debut if i could make it go quiet in 2021, featuring songs like \"Did You Come?\" (\"Did you do the things you know I like? Roll your tongue, make her cum 20 times?\"). Her connection to lesbians and bisexual women was so strong that the term \"do you listen to girl in red?\" evolved into a code to identify fellow queers on Sapphic TikTok.\n\nIn the Latin urban scene, openly gay Puerto Rican star Young Mikko is shaking up reggaeton with her assured flow and cheeky, suggestive singles including \"Peach\" — an ode to her lover's rounded butt. Brazilian star Ludmilla makes listeners blush with her sensual track \"Sintomas de Prazer,\" talking about getting turned on while giving her lover pleasure.\n\nAfter Billie Eilish established herself as one of the biggest pop stars of her generation, she faced intense pressure to come out as queer in November 2023. Six months later, her sexuality became a central theme in her third album, HIT ME HARD AND SOFT — particularly the album's first single, \"LUNCH,\" a fearless ride on pleasuring women. She seems to be enjoying her newfound freedom, too: in her recent remix of Charli XCX's \"Guess,\" she deviously sings, \"I wanna … kiss it bite it, can I fit it?/ Charli likes boys, but she knows I'd hit it.\"\n\nEilish was one of many Coachella 2024 performers who brought sapphic pop to the desert. Reneé Rapp's set was introduced by the cast of \"The L Word,\" Ludmilla's shared a tender onstage kiss with her wife during love song \"Maldivas\", and of course, Chappell Roan — decked in her Eat Me tee — had thousands to sing along with her unabashedly kinky hits.\n\nRoan herself is redefining pop, with outfits inspired by drag aesthetic and lyrics that are unapologetically sapphic (\"Knee deep in the passenger's seat and you're eating me out/ Are we casual now?\" she sings in country pop ballad \"Casual\"). In August, Roan broke records for attracting Lollapalooza's largest-ever crowd, and her rapidly rising fame helped her 2023 album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, reach No. 2 on the all-genre Billboard 200 (and a UK No. 1) nearly a year after its release.\n\nLesbian and queer artists have been making music for decades — and with artists more openly celebrating their sexuality than ever before, it's an undeniably exciting and historic time for the LGBTQIA+ music community. A new era of sapphic pop is upon us, and it's hot, explicit and gleefully unrestrained. You could even call it a femininomenon.\n\nExplore More Alternative & Indie Music\n\nAnother month has passed us by, and August brings us closer to the end of the season. However, several new tracks and albums have dropped to lift our spirits. With brand new projects like Khalid's Sincere, Maren Morris' Intermission, and 49 Winchester's Leavin' This Holler, the beginning of August promises bright things ahead.\n\nA slew of singles dropped, too, from exciting collaborations like Charli XCX's \"Guess\" remix with Billie Eilish and Jessie Murph's new track with Teddy Swims to new offerings from Big Sean, Jhené Aiko, Jelly Roll, Suki Waterhouse, and more. Whether you're looking for full projects or a few new playlist additions, you will not be disappointed.\n\nAs you prepare to close out summer, be sure to check out these 10 new songs and albums.\n\nCharli XCX & Billie Eilish — \"Guess\"\n\nJust 24 hours after Charli XCX set the internet ablaze with a tease of her next collaboration, she not only unveiled the special guest, but she also dropped the track as a New Music Friday-eve gift: a remix of \"Guess\" with her fellow pop queen, Billie Eilish.\n\nThe pulsating song keeps the same club-ready aesthetic of the original from Charli XCX's brat, but taps into the sexual fluidity of Eilish's HIT ME HARD AND SOFT with the \"LUNCH\" singer adding a new verse (fans particularly went into a frenzy over Eilish's line \"Charli likes boys but she knows I'd hit it\"). The track offers a raunchy brand of girl power, further emphasized by the underwear-strewn video, as the unworn undergarments will be donated to survivors of domestic violence through I Support the Girls.\n\nKacey Musgraves — 'Deeper into the Well'\n\nSeven-time GRAMMY-winner Kacey Musgraves is expanding the well she first introduced in March. With the release of Deeper Well, Musgraves showcased a softer side of herself that she discovered during periods of self-introspection following significant changes in her life.\n\nNow, with Deeper into the Well, she takes us further along on her journey. Musgraves gave a taste of the additional seven songs with the release of her single \"Irish Goodbye,\" which narrates the tale of someone struggling to find forgiveness for someone who abruptly left. The extended edition also includes two new features, \"Perfection\" with Tiny Habits and \"Superbloom\" with Leon Bridges.\n\nThe release comes one month before Musgraves is set to kick off her Deeper Well World Tour in Pennsylvania; she'll hit cities on both coasts, and conclude in Nashville in December.\n\nRead More: For The Record: Why Kacey Musgraves' Timeless Album Golden Hour Still Shines 5 Years Later\n\nSaweetie — \"My Best\"\n\nMaintaining her message of confidence and self-worth, Saweetie releases \"My Best,\" an unapologetic anthem that emphasizes knowing your worth and surrounding yourself with people who prioritize your best interests.\n\nThe music video visually represents Saweetie's personal growth, both as an individual and as an artist. Shot at hometown landmarks like her high school and childhood neighborhood, she invites fans on a nostalgic journey of introspection — while also reminding them to stay true to themselves.\n\nLearn More: Meet The First-Time GRAMMY Nominee: Saweetie On Her Long-Awaited Album Pretty B^^^^ Music & Why Women Rappers \"No Longer Need A Co-Sign\"\n\nTones and I — 'Beautifully Ordinary'\n\nFour years after her smash \"Dance Monkey\" took over the world, Tones and I releases her second studio album, Beautifully Ordinary. The follow-up to 2021's Welcome to the Madhouse, the 16-song project reflects the artist's growth, exploring themes of nostalgia, love, and self-acceptance. Each song invites listeners to embark on an emotional, personal journey with Tones and I, offering a source of catharsis for those who relate to her experiences.\n\nTones and I first gave listeners a taste of the project in June with lead single \"Dance With Me,\" a track that delves into themes of heartbreak and desperation. Despite its underlying message of loneliness, the track retains Tones and I's signature upbeat rhythms and vibrant instrumentals — and the rest of Beautifully Ordinary follows suit, offering intimate and heartfelt narratives through her radiant musicality.\n\nSam Smith — 'In The Lonely Hour (10th Anniversary Edition)'\n\nCelebrating the six-times-platinum debut album that catapulted them to stardom, Sam Smith is releasing the 10th anniversary edition of In The Lonely Hour. This special edition features a reimagined version of their classic \"Stay With Me,\" and a brand new track, \"Little Sailor.\"\n\nThe original project launched Smith's career into the stratosphere, receiving critical acclaim and earning them four golden gramophones at the 2015 GRAMMYs, including Best New Artist.\n\n\"I feel so incredibly lucky to be celebrating this milestone with you,\" Smith wrote on Instagram. \"My team and I have created this beautiful anniversary edition for us all, and for the last 10 years.\"\n\nLearn More: 9 Times Queer Artists Made History At The GRAMMYs: From Elton John's Collab With BSB To Kim & Sam's \"Unholy\" Union\n\nKiller Mike — 'Michael & The Mighty Midnight Revival, Songs For Sinners & Saints'\n\nFresh off going three-for-three at the 2024 GRAMMYs, Killer Mike delivers another potent project, Michael & The Mighty Midnight Revival, Songs For Sinners & Saints. A follow-up to his autobiographical album 'MICHAEL', the 10-song collection dives deeper into his personal narrative, offering an epilogue filled with introspection and celebration — including the poignant track \"HUMBLE ME,\" which reflects on his arrest after winning his GRAMMYs in February.\n\nKiller Mike provided fans with a gift, releasing the album as a free download for the first 48 hours. In support of the release, Killer Mike electrified audiences with six performances over three nights at the legendary Blue Note jazz club in NYC, including a live-streamed show that attracted nearly 100,000 viewers. This project is a testament to Killer Mike's ongoing dialogue with his audience, addressing both tribulations and triumphs. As the tour continues with a stop at Lollapalooza just one day after the album's release, fans can engage further with tracks like \"NOBODY KNOWS\" and \"HIGHER LEVEL,\" which offer a glimpse into the rapper’s evolving journey and continued impact on hip-hop.\n\nTiera Kennedy — \"Cry\"\n\nStill riding high from her vocals featured on Beyoncé's COWBOY CARTER, country star Tiera Kennedy releases her latest single, \"Cry,\" which samples Justin Timberlake's 2002 Timbaland-produced hit \"Cry Me A River.\" It's another taste of Kennedy's forthcoming debut album, which she dubs \"R&B/country.\"\n\n\"I've been really inspired by the music I grew up listening to,\" Kennedy shared in an Instagram video. \"Timbaland had a hand in a lot of those songs.\"\n\nKnown for her distinctive approach to blending genres, Kennedy invites listeners to immerse themselves in her world of creative storytelling with her latest track. \"Cry\" explores the narrative of someone who has made their bed and has to lie in it, while Kennedy has already moved on.\n\nExplore More: A Brief History Of Black Country Music: 11 Important Tracks From DeFord Bailey, Kane Brown & More\n\nGryffin — 'PULSE'\n\nReturning with his third studio album, electronic artist Gryffin embarks on a new era and unveils a fresh side of his artistry with PULSE. The 14-track album features collaborations with a range of artists, including Rita Ora, Disco Lines, MAX, and more.\n\n\"PULSE is a return to why I fell in love with dance music in the first place, and this is the most creatively inspired I've felt in years,\" said Gryffin on Instagram. \"I can't wait for you all to hear the new sound and feel the passion I've put into these tracks.\"\n\nJohn K — \"Lost\"\n\nAfter more than a year of not releasing music, John K is back with a new single, \"Lost.\" It's a song that vulnerably reveals feelings of completeness after finding the right person — a fitting narrative for the happily married singer, who is expecting his second child with his wife, Lenée. . Becoming a father is one of the several major life changes John K has experienced in the past few years, all of which have shaped his upcoming music and brought his musical artistry to the next stage.\n\n\"I was writing with the aim of challenging myself to do something I hadn't done before,\" John K said in a press statement. \"I shattered the box of what I thought I had to be, and it allowed me to get to deeper levels of honesty and really gain even more confidence. I took risks, and I honestly expressed myself.\n\nJack White — 'No Name'\n\nAfter releasing two albums within four months in 2022, Jack White has essentially gone silent since — until now. Just two days after announcing his sixth studio album, No Name, the rock icon unveils his latest masterpiece.\n\nThe 13-track album stays true to White's DIY philosophy, with the recording, production, and mixing all handled by the artist himself at his own Third Man Studio. Even before the album dropped on Aug. 2, reviews were already glowing, with Variety calling it the album \"fans have been lusting for\" due to its parallels to the rip-roaring rock of his former band the White Stripes — but \"without seeming retro or leaning too heavily on nostalgia.\"\n\nExplore More: Songbook: A Guide To Jack White's Musical Outlets, From The White Stripes To The Dead Weather & Beyond\n\nBootsy Collins — \"Pure Perfection\"\n\nLatest News & Exclusive Videos\n\nJuly has graced us with a diverse array of new music from all genres, lighting up dance floors and speakers everywhere.\n\nThe last weekend of the month brings exciting new collaborations, including another iconic track from Calvin Harris and Ellie Goulding, as well as a fierce team-up from Paris Hilton and Meghan Trainor. Halsey and Muni Long offered a taste of their forthcoming projects, while Jordan Davis and Miranda Lambert each delivered fun new country tunes.\n\nIn addition to fresh collabs and singles, there's a treasure trove of new albums to uncover. Highlights include Ice Spice's Y2K!, Rakim's G.O.D., Sam Tompkins' hi, my name is insecure, Wild Rivers' Never Better, Tigirlily Gold's Blonde, and kenzie's biting my tongue.\n\nAs you check out all the new music that dropped today, be sure you don't miss these 10 tracks and albums.\n\nmgk & Jelly Roll — \"Lonely Road\"\n\nAlthough fans anticipated Machine Gun Kelly's next release to mark his return to hip-hop, no one seems to be complaining about \"KellyRoll.\" Embracing the trend of venturing into the country genre, mgk teams up with fellow GRAMMY-nominated artist Jelly Roll on their newest track, \"Lonely Road.\"\n\nThe genre-blending track interpolates John Denver's classic \"Take Me Home, Country Roads.\" However, unlike Denver's sentimental ode to the simplicity of rural life, mgk and Jelly Roll reinterpret the track through the lens of romantic relationships that have come to a, well, lonely end.\n\nAs mgk revealed in an Instagram post, \"Lonely Road\" was a labor of love for both him and Jelly Roll. \"We worked on 'Lonely Road' for 2 years, 8 different studios, 4 different countries, changed the key 4 times,\" he wrote. \"We finally got it right.\"\n\nHalsey — \"Lucky\"\n\nIn another interpolation special, Halsey samples not one but two classics in their latest single, \"Lucky.\" The song's production features elements of Monica's 1999 hit \"Angel of Mine,\" while the chorus flips Britney Spears' fan-favorite \"Lucky\" into a first-person narrative.\n\nWhile Halsey has always been a transparent star, their next project is seemingly going to be even more honest than their previous releases. After first revealing their journey with lupus with the super-personal \"The End\" in June, \"Lucky\" further details their struggles: \"And I told everybody I was fine for a whole damn year/ And that's the biggest lie of my career.\"\n\nThough they haven't revealed a release date for their next project, Halsey referred to her next era as a \"monumental moment in my life\" in an Instagram post about the \"Lucky\" music video — hinting that it may just be their most powerful project yet.\n\nRead More: Everything We Know About Halsey's New Album\n\nParis Hilton & Meghan Trainor — \"Chasin'\"\n\nAhead of Paris Hilton's forthcoming album, Infinite Icon — her first in nearly 20 years — the multihyphenate unveiled another female-powered collaboration, this time with Meghan Trainor. Co-produced by Sia, \"Chasin'\" is a lively pop anthem about discovering self-worth in romantic relationships and finding the strength to walk away from toxicity.\n\n\"She is the sister I always needed and when she calls me sis, I die of happiness inside,\" Trainor told Rolling Stone about her relationship with Hilton. Coincidentally, Trainor first wrote the track with her brother, Ryan, but the pop star was waiting for the right collaborator to hop on the track — and Hilton was just that.\n\n\"We made something truly iconic together,\" Trainor added. \"It was a bucket list dream come true for me.\"\n\nEmpire Of The Sun — 'Ask That God'\n\nA highly awaited return to music after eight years, Australian electro-pop duo Empire Of The Sun are back with their fourth studio album, Ask That God.\n\n\"This body of work represents the greatest shift in consciousness our world has ever seen and that's reflected in the music,\" says member Lord Littlemore in a press statement.\n\nLike their previous work that transports listeners to a different universe, this album continues that tradition with trancey tracks like lead single \"Changes\" and the thumping title track. Ask That God offers a chance to reflect on the blend of reality and imagination, while also evoking the radiant energy of their past songs.\n\nCalvin Harris & Ellie Goulding — \"Free\"\n\nDance music's collaborative powerhouse, Calvin Harris and Ellie Goulding, are back with another summer hit. Their latest track, \"Free,\" marks the fourth collaboration between the duo — and like their past trilogy of hits, the two have another banger on their hands.\n\nThe track debuted earlier this month at Harris' show in Ibiza, where Goulding made a surprise appearance to perform \"Free\" live. With Harris delivering an infectious uptempo house beat and Goulding's silky vocals elevating the track, \"Free\" proves that the pair still have plenty of musical chemistry left.\n\nPost Malone & Luke Combs — \"Guy For That\"\n\nPost Malone's transition into country music has been anything but slow; in fact, the artist went full-throttle into the genre. The New York-born, Texas-raised star embraced his new country era with collaborations alongside some of the genre's biggest superstars, like Morgan Wallen and Blake Shelton. Continuing this momentum as he gets closer to releasing F-1 Trillion, Post Malone teams up with Luke Combs for the new track \"Guy For That.\"\n\nThe catchy collaboration tells the story of a relationship that has faded, where the protagonist knows someone who can fix almost anything, except for a broken heart. It's an upbeat breakup song that, like Post's previous F-1 Trillion releases, can get any party going — especially one in Nashville, as Malone and Combs did in the track's music video.\n\nForrest Frank & Tori Kelly — \"Miracle Worker\"\n\nJust one month after Surfaces released their latest album, good morning, the duo's Forrest Frank unveiled his own project, CHILD OF GOD — his debut full-length Christian album. Among several features on the LP, one of the standouts is with GRAMMY-winning artist Tori Kelly on the track \"Miracle Worker.\"\n\nOver a plucky electric guitar and lo-fi beats, Frank and Kelly trade verses before joining for the second chorus. Their impassioned vocals elevate the song's hopeful prayer, \"Miracle Worker make me new.\"\n\nTheir collaboration arrives just before both artists hit the road for their respective tours. Frank kicks his U.S. trek off in Charlotte, North Carolina on July 31, and Kelly starts her world tour in Taipei, Taiwan on Aug. 17.\n\nXG — \"SOMETHING AIN'T RIGHT\"\n\nSince their debut in 2022 with \"Tippy Toes,\" Japanese girl group XG has been making waves and showing no signs of slowing down. With their first mini album released in 2023 and now their latest single, \"SOMETHING AIN'T RIGHT,\" the group continues to rise with their distinctive visuals and infectious hits.\n\nThe track features a nostalgic rhythm reminiscent of early 90s R&B, showcasing the unique personalities of each member. As an uptempo dance track, it's designed to resonate with listeners from all across the globe.\n\n\"SOMETHING AIN'T RIGHT\" also serves as the lead single for XG's upcoming second mini album, set to release later this year.\n\nMustard — 'Faith of a Mustard Seed'\n\nFor nearly 15 years, Mustard has been a go-to producer for some of rap's biggest names, from Gucci Mane to Travis Scott. On the heels of earning his first Billboard Hot 100 chart-topper as a producer with Kendrick Lamar's \"Not Like Us,\" he's back with his own collaboration-filled project.\n\nFaith of a Mustard Seed features a robust 14-song track list with contributions from Vince Staples, Lil Yachty, Charlie Wilson, and more. The LP marks Mustard's fourth studio album, and first since 2019's Perfect Ten.\n\nIn an interview with Billboard, Mustard shared that the album's title is an ode to late rapper Nipsey Hussle, who suggested the title during one of their final conversations before his untimely death in 2019. And once \"Not Like Us\" hit No. 1, Mustard knew it was time to release the long-in-the-making album.\n\nLatest News & Exclusive Videos"
