        "text": "Little Mix’s JADE’s debut is finally here, and fans are crying that “Angel Of My Dreams” is the most unique debut from any former member of the girl group so far.\n\nWhen I first listened to the song, I was in a public place and my attention was divided. I thought the song was made up of very disparate parts that didn’t quite merge. A few hours later, I revisited the song in the comfort of my own home and two listens later, I began to understand why fans are seriously hyping this song. For me, it felt like what Camila Cabello’s “I LUV IT” should have sounded like, if it were better. You know, a song that challenges the norm and goes outside of the mainstream’s safety net to incorporate elements that frankly may or may not even appeal to fans.\n\nSpeaking on the mindset that drove her to make the song the way it is, JADE said, “I didn’t want to do a safe first single, that was really important to me. I’m setting the tone of who I am as an artist on my own. I want people to hear it and be like ‘what the fuck is that song?’. My worst nightmare is for someone to hear my song and go ‘that’s nice’.”\n\nIn “Angel Of My Dreams,” fame is a frenemy to JADE; sometimes it calls her a star and makes her happy and sometimes it leaves her to wallow in darkness. It doesn’t “Care that I’m mad, care that I’m sad / It’s so bad, it’s funny / Care if I cry, care if I die / You only care about money.”\n\n“Fair that I try, fair that I grind / Fair that I buy you sushi / Got you a car, got you a house / Got you a suit, it’s Gucci / If I don’t win, I’m in the bin,” she sings in the second verse, probably as a reference to executives who are ready to discard any talent the moment they’re not making them big bucks, even if said talent worked their ass off.\n\nFollowing the song’s release, she wrote, “This song means everything to me – my love/hate letter to the music industry, telling my story from the beginning of my journey to now. It’s the perfect introduction and launch into my world as a solo artist.” She also thanked her incredible team for letting her be crazy and trusting her weird choices.\n\nShe followed the release with a music video that sees her take the craziness surrounding fame to a new level, with visuals of an oversized bodyguard and contracts signed with her blood. Sandwiched in between these moments are her X Factor audition clips. Like the song, the video is fast-paced, with 11 total costume changes."
