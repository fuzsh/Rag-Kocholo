        "text": "Two years after Juice WRLD passed away at the age of 21, his legacy lives on in a new posthumous album, Fighting Demons. The album — an intimate record about anxiety, depression, and seeking help — has a few features, including none other than BTS rapper Suga.\n\nSuga and Juice WRLD’s song is titled “Girl of My Dreams,” and it was written by Juice WRLD (Jarad Anthony Higgins), Joshua Jaramillo, Karim, Jaegen, Max Lord and SUGA. It’s an emotional track about an all-consuming, albeit heart-breaking love. Juice WRLD raps over a beat that carefully balances rock and trap, “All of me loves all of you, like I'm John Legend or somethin'/Better save some room, for my heart, it's a big one.” Suga later chimes in with his own verse, per translation from @doyou__bangtan: “Another name for love is blue/What’s refreshing can otherwise feel cold/Love always accompanies loneliness/Even when together the loneliness is present.”\n\nWhen talking about the late rapper in the album trailer, Suga said, “I loved his talent.” The “Daechwita” rapper, who is hailed for his lyrics and the profound way he talks about anxiety and mental health, went on to say that he found connection in Juice WRLD’s songs. “I personally related a lot to the messages he tried to convey,” he said.\n\nAhead of the release, rapper Lil Bibby — who had signed Juice WRLD to his label Grade A Productions — shared pictures on Instagram of Suga in the studio. “Thanks Suga for joining the fight 👊🏽😈,” he captioned the post."
