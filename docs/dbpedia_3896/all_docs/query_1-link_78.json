She blends the soulful\n\ntones of alterna5ve pop, with an electronic twist. Her new single ‘In my dreams’ shows off\n\nher haunting, ethereal vocals, mixed in with the rawness of an acous5c break. Inspired by\n\nthe sounds of nature; Each song she releases have quirks yet display a distinctive\n\nunmistakable sound that is that will leave listeners hooked.\n\nWhat made you go into music?\n\nI’ve always loved art, ac-ng and fashion, but doing music sums that all up- I can create my own vision\n\nusing all these things. I’ve been writing since I was really young, before I could even play an instrument, song writing is\n\nwhere it all started and still is the core to why I do music.\n\nWho are your influences?\n\nMy main influences include; The Japanese house, The Weeknd, Charli xcx, Dua Lipa, Billie eilish and\n\nThe 1975. I tend to draw towards artists who create their own world, not only through their music,\n\nbut with their visuals. Something I try to create with my music and visuals.\n\nAre you signed?\n\nAt the moment I’m completely independent, its something I’d probably look into in the future.\n\nYou released your single ‘In My Dreams’, tell us more about the single.\n\nI wrote ‘in my dreams’ over a year ago, I remember playing the chords and it almost instantly\n\nmeaning something to me. It’s the first song I feel is the foundations to who I am as an artist. It started on my acoustic guitar (where I write most of my songs) , at the time I’d just gotten into\n\nproduction, (if you go on my instagram you’ll be able to hear a snippet of this version!) back then it\n\nhad sort of a lo-fi vibe, I had no idea where I wanted to take my music. I then met some incredibly forward thinking, creative producers in London last summer. I’d travel\n\ndown in the week with my brother and with all our opinions combined I think we been created\n\nsomething pretty special.\n\nWhat is the meaning behind the single?\n\nMy new single ‘In my dreams’ is about the feeling of actually coming to terms with not seeing\n\nsomeone again, but finding a sort of comfort that you’ll see them in your dreams. Dreams\n\nare an immersive experience. They’re a mirror of our subconscious minds and evoke all\n\nsenses. Therefore, In my dreams is a story that stretches beyond the music. I want to take\n\nthe listeners on a visual journey, luring them into a blurry, dreamlike reality. Through music\n\nvideos and social-media visuals, this reality should surround the music and help tell the tale\n\nof my soon to come EP.\n\nWhat was the writing and recording process like?\n\nMy coming music is all written by myself in my room. My first body of work being a solitary writing\n\nprocess has given me a sense of knowing to that whatever comes next, this was the beginning. In terms of recording, It was quite a chilled vibe- I’d say my dyslexic brain likes to work quite visually, so if I wanted the song to sound like something, I’d explain by describing pictures or movements, It’s a similar way to how I write; I have loads of picture stuck in my room at home, a lot of the time I start by looking at them for ideas to how I can say how I’m feeling in more metaphoric way.\n\nDescribe the track in two words.\n\nEthereal, haunting\n\nWho did you work with on the single?\n\nAlex Dopierala, Terell Farrell and my Brother Harry.\n\nWe also see a Music Video for the single, what was the creative process like?\n\nI filmed this video, back in December last year (as you can imagine I was freezing haha). For the\n\nvisuals of this single, I got together a couple of my friends who studied film at uni, we filmed it in\n\nEpping forest- a place I felt really captured this haunting, dreamlike reality. There were many drafts before getting to this end result! I’d learnt how to use premiere over the process of the project- for me it was all about experimenting. I definitely go by the terms of “lets make it really weird and out there- then we can always tone it down!” I’d rather do that than vice versa.” I wanted the video to help tell the story of the song. For me as an artist visuals are just as important as the music. Therefore, with this music video I hope to take viewers into a world of what dreams\n\ncould look like, if we drew them out.\n\nWe will also see you new EP drop in October. Tell us what we can expect from it.\n\nFor me a song is like a time-capsule, to how your feeling when you write it.\n\nEach song on this EP has its own little world, but when you hear them all together, It becomes even\n\nmore than that, you see the complete vision and hopefully you’ll fall in love with it like I have.\n\nDescribe each track in two words.\n\nEthereal, haunting\n\nPixelated, vivid\n\nGlittery, soul binding\n\nHonest, bouncy\n\nWhat else can we expect in 2021?\n\nMore and more music! Gigs (hopefully) and more collaborations\n\nWhere do you see yourself now in 5 Years?\n\nCollaborating with different musicians, writing for other artists, producing music that pushes who I\n\nam and creating art for people to escape in.\n\nWhat quote or saying do you always stick by?\n\nNever ever ever give up"
