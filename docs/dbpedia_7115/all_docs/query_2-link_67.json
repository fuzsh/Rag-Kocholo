        "text": "Scott Weiss is the Co-Founder and Chief Creative Officer of Catalest, a global design firm focused on helping the public sector solve systemic challenges related to innovation and modernization. Catalest was born out of his experience as a White House Presidential Innovation Fellow, where he helped Federal leaders and communities across Government strengthen their human-centered design, customer experience, and innovation capabilities and practices. Prior to joining the White House, he co-led a social innovation and design consultancy based in New York called Community by Design, that delivered human-centric concepts at the intersection of design thinking, civic innovation, and community organizing. Scott began his professional design journey at the award-winning agency IDEO, where he worked as an organizational and systems strategist for 6.5 years. This work focused on helping organizations of all shapes, sizes, and industries transform themselves into more design-led and innovative organizations. In his spare time, Scott guest lectures at NYU, Parsons, Duke University, and the University of Illinois on topics such as Design Thinking for Social Impact, Design Research, and Storytelling."
