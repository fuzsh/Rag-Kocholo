        "text": "Gates. Ellison. Plattner. Hasso's name belongs in any list of the greatest business innovators and entrepreneurs. As a German, I have always found it (sadly) surprising how few European tech companies made it to global scale which makes Hasso's accomplishment so much more unique and inspiring. Over the past week many laudations have been given of his impact on business and outside of it. I won't add to them, but just share two quick stories on lessons I learned from Hasso: 1. I am not sure of the year anymore, maybe 2011 or 2013, in Bill McDermott's CEO tenure, we made a proposal to change the SAP logo. Rather than it to boxed in, we removed the blue frame. A short time, after the \"launch\", the internal message boards exploded. Employees were furious. It was one of the few times as Chief of Staff that I received an email directly from Hasso urging me to revisit the decision. Lesson learned: Hasso was always close the people, and had his pulse on the emotional state the company. He was the company's \"gewissen\"/conscience. I thought this was so impressive. 2. When I took over the hybris business, we brought together multiple companies. I made a proposal to harmonize the names to SAP Commerce Cloud, SAP Marketing Cloud and so forth. I presented this proposal to the Board and Hasso. Let's just say it is intimidating to present to Hasso. No eye contact. You have no idea if Hasso will love or hate your idea. At the end of my pitch, he looked up and said \"Finally! It is about time that we make this switch and that we have a coherent strategy.\" Lesson learned: Hasso cared for SAP above all else, and always recognized that the greatest power and the ultimate trust comes from SAP not any of the acquired solutions. SAP is in great hands now with Christian and team. It is an incredible legacy to build on as Hasso's spirit will forever shape this amazing company."
