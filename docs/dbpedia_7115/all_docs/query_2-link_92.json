        "text": "Purposefully designed to leverage the power of space in its architecture and interior design, the building was designed by KMH Architects using design thinking principles. This process itself was collaborative and inclusive, leveraging the discipline’s focus on co-creation.\n\nAs a result, the architects, students and faculty members were a part of the brief guiding the building’s design approach, thereby fostering collaboration, creativity, and innovation from the outset of the project.\n\nThe building features radically flexible learning spaces where we can experiment and collaborate to both understand and allow for the emergence of what future learning spaces could look like, and become.\n\nEngineered for maximum functionality through various sustainable measures within its design, the building has received a 6-star rating by the Green Building Council South Africa."
