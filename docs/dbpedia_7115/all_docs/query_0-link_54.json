The German software company has announced that Punit Renjen, who it originally intended to become chairman of the supervisory board, is to be replaced. They have mutually decided to go their separate ways, SAP said in a statement. 📰The reason given for the sudden separation was “a difference in perspective” about the role of the future chairman of the supervisory board. At SAP’s Annual General Meeting on May 15, 2024, Renjen will also step down from his seat on the company’s supervisory board, which he only took up at last year’s AGM. 🗞️Instead, the supervisory board has nominated Pekka Ala-Pietilä for election to join it, and announced him as the designated successor to Hasso Plattner, the current chairman. Ala-Pietilä is to be proposed for election for a two-year term of office at the next AGM and, if elected, will also assume the role of chairman of the supervisory board. 🗞️With 67-year-old Ala-Pietilä, SAP believes it has found the right man. The Finn is “excellently positioned to support SAP’s continued successful transformation,” it said. Ala-Pietilä was President of Nokia from 1999 to 2005 and a member of SAP’s supervisory board between 2002 and 2021. In addition, from 2018 to 2020, he served as chairman of the European Commission’s high-level expert group on artificial intelligence. 👇This will be the paradigm shift and game-changer for SAP's new success plan and new approaches to gaining market share. https://lnkd.in/d9VSqrBn Wouter van Heddeghem #sucessmindset #sap #enterprise\n\nSAP has a new succession planhttps://lnkd.in/gA9UQ4xu changing of the guard at the top of SAP’s supervisory board is anything but smooth.

Déjà vu “In Pekka Ala-Pietilä, I recognize a leader who not only possesses a profound understanding of our industry and the intricacies of European SE governance, but also one who has been a steadfast ally through many of SAP’s pivotal moments,” said SAP co-founder Plattner, who has served as chairman of the supervisory board since 2003. “As we welcome Pekka Ala-Pietilä, I am filled with confidence that SAP’s Supervisory Board is in the most capable hands. His vision and well-measured approach are exactly what SAP needs to safeguard its future and ensure its ongoing success.” However, similar things were heard a year ago, when SAP presented Renjen as the new man for the top of the supervisory board. Plattner’s farewell to the big SAP stage is bumpy. The Berlin-born manager, who celebrated his 80th birthday on January 21, 2024, founded SAP in 1972 together with his colleagues Claus Wellenreuther, Hans-Werner Hector, Klaus Tschira, and Dietmar Hopp. Plattner has been chairman of SAP’s supervisory board for two decades, which has repeatedly given rise to criticism in recent years. For the man who controls SAP strategy from behind the scenes, internal rules did not seem to apply: The term of office of the chairman of the supervisory board at SAP was supposed to be limited to 12 years, with the person holding the post not older than 75 years. Difficult search The search for a successor had been difficult, Plattner told German newspaper Handelsblatt a year ago, explaining hi\n\n🚀 Attention Public Sector Leaders! 🚀 Join us next week (Thursday June 6) to learn how to prepare your ERP systems for the UK Government's shared services cluster decisions.
