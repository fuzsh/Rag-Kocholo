        "text": "The first 77 students began their studies at HPI just one year later. The following year, in the immediate vicinity of the Griebnitzsee lake, the cornerstone was laid for the institute's own building. Now, in 2024, HPI is celebrating its 25th anniversary.\n\nSince then Hasso Plattner has supported the institute’s continuous growth. In the fall of 2016, the patron of science announced the comprehensive expansion of HPI. A few months later, HPI and the University of Potsdam jointly founded the \"Digital Engineering Faculty\"—the first privately financed faculty of a public university in Germany.\n\nLearn more about the history of HPI here.\n\nIn the following video, Hasso Plattner explains his vision of an independent faculty for digital engineering at the University of Potsdam.\n\nPlattner not only finances HPI, as head of the “Enterprise Platform and Integration Concepts” department, he has also made a personal commitment to research and teaching.\n\nHis initiative has facilitated a number of groundbreaking innovations. One of the most significant examples is HPI’s research into in-memory data management (a project Plattner personally oversaw). The project led to the creation of HANA, a product of the SAP software corporation. In 2012 this technology received both the German Innovation Award and the Berlin-Brandenburg Innovation Award.\n\nIn spring 2023, Prof. Plattner held his last lecture at the HPI and was released from his duties.\n\nEstablished by Prof. Dr. h.c. mult. Hasso Plattner in 2015, the Hasso Plattner Foundation promotes philanthropic initiatives that aim to educate and inspire generations in the areas of Science and Education, Social and Conservation, as well as Art and Culture.\n\nAt the core of the Foundation’s work lies the belief in the power of innovation and education to bring about positive societal change.\n\nThe Hasso Plattner Foundation directly and exclusively pursues philanthropic initiatives. It establishes and runs long-term projects in partnership with experts in relevant fields, ensuring that the Foundation’s commitment has the greatest possible impact\n\nAreas of Focus\n\nThrough its three areas of focus, the Foundation contributes to education, environmental protection, and culture. You get more detailed information here.\n\nThe promotion of future-oriented research, innovation and entrepreneurship is particularly important to HPI’s dedicated patron and founder. The HPI Research Schools was founded in 2005. This interdisciplinary doctoral program now has branches at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, at the Technion in Israel, at the University of California Irvine in the United States, and at Nanjing University in China.\n\nIn 2007 Plattner expanded the institute to include the \"HPI School of Design Thinking\", modelled on the renowned d.school in Stanford. In Potsdam, higher semesters of all faculties, working in multidisciplinary teams, can learn how to develop innovative products and services for all areas of life with the help of Design Thinking. The facility has been growing, and in 2016 another branch opened in Cape Town (South Africa).\n\nHasso Plattner promotes research in the field of design thinking through a joint research program with the US elite Stanford University. In 2005 the opening of the “Hasso Plattner Institute of Design” was made possible with Plattner’s financial support. In 2016 Plattner was awarded the German Design Award for his commitment to design thinking.\n\nThis was followed in 2010 by the establishment of the top-level research facility HPI Future SOC Lab. The SOC Lab provides scientists and researchers from all over the world with an infrastructure of the latest hardware and software for research purposes at no cost.\n\nIn 2005, Plattner increased his involvement in Potsdam by financing a business incubator and venture capital fund (Hasso Plattner Ventures) to support young entrepreneurs in the IT sector.\n\nIn spring 2011, the SAP co-founder and chairman of the supervisory board announced the establishment of the first innovation center in Potsdam. The SAP Innovation Center works closely with HPI.\n\nIn 2007 and 2011, Plattner also lent his financial support to the construction of Potsdam’s City Palace, making possible an accurate reconstruction of the cooper roof and the façade.\n\nIn 2012 Plattner launched another educational innovation at HPI in Potsdam – a novel kind of social learning network. Via the online learning platform openHPI anyone in the world can participate in open, free of charge courses on information technology at HPI. In the meantime, 620,000 enrollments have been registered at openHPI from 200,000 users and 180 countries. More than 67,000 certificates have also already been issued to successful learners. Plattner has created a learning platform of international and social importance that has become the foundation of openSAP, openWho and MOOCHouse.\n\nCommitment to Art and Culture\n\nHasso Plattner's commitment has also left its mark on art and culture.\n\nVisitors to the \"Museum Barberini\" in Potsdam experience a building modeled after a palace, which was destroyed in World War II and later reconstructed as a museum based on Plattner’s vision. Our former Chancellor Angela Merkel and former German President Joachim Gauck were among the first of the distinguished guests to visit Museum Barberini when it opened on January 20, 2017.\n\nThe exhibitions range from the old masters to contemporary art, with a focus on Impressionism. Based on works from the collection of Hasso Plattner, the museum’s founder and patron, the Museum Barberini presents three temporary exhibitions each year with major loans from international private collections and museums. The exhibitions are planned at academic conferences with international curators and researchers. In addition, the rotating Art Stories presentations place prominent works in a new context and increase awareness of original artworks.\n\nLocated just a few hundred meters from the Barberini, \"DAS MINSK Kunsthaus in Potsdam\" opened in Potsdam in September 2022. It is a unique place that combines art and history. The former terrace restaurant \"Minsk\" had become increasingly dilapidated after the fall of the Berlin Wall. In 2019, it was purchased by the Hasso Plattner Foundation, and construction work began in 2020, with the building's architecture revealing preservation and renewal at the same time and retaining its name. \"The building is a place of happy memories for many Potsdam residents. The style of the GDR is part of Potsdam's history and I want to give it back to the people of Potsdam,\" Hasso Plattner explained. The exhibitions at DAS MINSK Kunsthaus in Potsdam feature art from the former German Democratic Republic, which are part of the Hasso Plattner Collection, as well as contemporary art."
