        "text": "The Teutonic Phantom, Sharks owner Hasso Plattner, made a featured appearance Friday at the news conference to announce the Sharks’ lease extension with the City of San Jose. Plattner, who is from Germany and operates his SAP Software interests from that country, then stayed around to answer questions from local media types.\n\nAs that session broke up, Plattner made certain to tell me that he is, in fact, no Teutonic Phantom.\n\n“Don’t write that I’m never here,” he said. “I spend one-third of the year here.”\n\nFine. Plattner spends one-third of the year here. Noted.\n\nStill, Shark fans never see him much. This, in and of itself, Is not crucial. Other absentee sports owners may indeed may be more absentee than Plattner. The most important thing is that his team’s fans see Plattner often enough–and hear from him often enough–to believe he cares about the team and is acting in the fans’ best interests.\n\nPlattner’s rare public interactions are why I have been known to call him an International Hockey Man Of Mystery. Hey, the man is worth more than $9 billion according to Forbes Magazine. He works in a very competitive racket, the high tech world. I’m sure he can take a joke.\n\nAlso, if the Sharks are worth $425 million (also as reported by Forbes), then that would mean the hockey franchise is roughly 5% of Plattner’s financial portfolio. So it would be entirely understandable if he would spend just 5% of his time thinking and caring about the team.\n\nBut here’s my observation after that 15-minute media gaggle on the back porch of the Shark Tank: Plattner does in fact care about the Sharks more than 5% of the time. He is on top of things with the team, clearly enjoys hockey –and, after signing off on the new lease extension that will keep the Sharks in town at least through the 2024-25 season, he clearly is committed to San Jose more than many owners are committed to some cities.\n\n“I’m involved on a daily basis,” Plattner said of his relationship with the Sharks, citing frequent phone calls to general manager Doug Wilson and chief operating officer John Tortora. “So, when people think I’m not involved, that is either writing on rumors or creating rumors.”\n\nIn Plattner’s remarks at the podium during the news conference, He was affable and funny. He referenced both the Sharks’ habit of falling short of a Stanley Cup and the fan dissatisfaction with Wilson by saying: “We came close, but not close enough. I’m looking at Doug.”\n\nPlattner also said: “In the next 10 years, I’m pretty sure we’re going to win one Stanley Cup.”\n\nIn his smaller session with reporters, Plattner was more thorough in going over all the things that went wrong with the team this past season. He was detailed, he expressed frustration, he showed a sense of humor, brought up some good and interesting points. It made you wonder why he doesn’t make himself available more often, not every week or even every month but at least a few times per season–and not necessarily in a session with reporters but at fan gatherings or at San Jose civic events. He’s a busy guy, I’m sure. But being around the Sharks and Shark fans would have to be more fun than attending software conferences, right?\n\nAll in all, Plattner seems like a guy you’d enjoy having a beer with as you watch the NHL playoffs — except that he doesn’t drink beer because he’s more of a wine drinker, as he also informed me when I asked what his favorite German beer was.\n\nHere’s some of the other interesting stuff he said:\n\n— Plattner thought the final turning point of the Sharks’ season was probably the outdoor game at Levi’s Stadium, which they lost to the Los Angeles Kings, 2-1 The buildup to the game and the excitement around it created such an emotional atmosphere that the defeat seemed to be worth more than just one defeat and the team never really did get back in the hunt afterward. I agree with him on this.\n\n— When addressing Wilson’s status, a sore point with many fans, Plattner basically said that he bought into the general manager’s rebuilding plan two years ago and wants to let Wilson see the plan through. This may not be what some fans want to hear but Plattner is the owner and he, understandably, believes that the 10 consecutive playoff years and winning records attained under Wilson also matter. “We are optimistic that we can rebound very quickly,” Plattner said. “Let him do his job,” Plattner added of Wilson.\n\n— Plattner ripped the European sports system of allowing players to be bought and sold, particularly in soccer, and said that he likes the American sports systems with salary caps much better because it’s more fair.\n\n–Wilson will choose the Sharks’ next head coach. Plattner will not have much input but of course will have final veto that he likely won’t exercise. Plattner was talking about the salary cap in relation to player payroll but of course, there’s no salary cap for hiring coaches. So, knowing that Detroit coach Mike Babcock’s contract is up and he’s been given permission to talk with other teams and will surely command a huge salary, I asked Plattner if cost was an object in hiring a head coach. Plattner’s response: “Now it starts already. I look deep into your eyes, what do you know?” I must say, this was the first time a sports team owner ever used that phrase during an interview with me. But in truth, I do know nothing. I just thought it was a fair question to ask. The answer seems to be: Cost is part of the equation in everything Shark-ish. But of course, Plattner’s answer did not rule out a Babcock courtship, either. Maybe they will both look deep into each other’s eyes and see if there’s a match.\n\n— Although he is one of the world’s richest men, Plattner is not operating the Sharks as a charity and is not delighted that the hockey team loses money every year. “There is a limit for losses,” Plattner said. “This is still a business. This is not a hobby. When it turns into a hobby, that’s not good.” I actually get that philosophy, too.\n\n— Plattner is a huge fan of the SAP Arena’s atmosphere for hockey games and believes the Shark Tanks is one of the better buildings in the league, even if it opened way back in 1993. The lease extension simply provides for much-needed upkeep and maintenance. Don’t expect any major changes. Also, Plattner is not pushing for a new arena in San Jose any time soon — or maybe ever, under his watch. His quote: “We never had the idea to leave here. I think this is an American thing, that you think buildings of a certain age are kaput. We need some fresh touches, to keep it attractive. No reason to dream something up.”\n\nAnd then he was off to his next stop. Not absent, understand. Just trying to use his one-third time in the Bay Area productively."
