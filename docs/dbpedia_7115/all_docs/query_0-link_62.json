The teleradiologists are supported by artificial intelligence in the preparation of their findings in order to achieve a high level of precision even at night.\n\nGemedico GmbH was founded in June 2019 by Nils Blaumer and the IT systems engineering student.\n\nDavid Matuschek.\n\n[Former Portfolio Company]\n\nSTOMT develops a holistic approach for gathering, managing and automating customer feedback. By simplifying the whole process for those who are supposed to give feedback as well as the recipient, 10X more data and feedback is collected while costs for processing are reduced. Thereby, STOMT creates anonymous user profiles which are converted into real users on STOMT.com over time. Those additional customer relationships can be used to win back lost customers, to up-sell and to reduce the companies churn-rate.\n\nSTOMT makes use of knowledge and lessons learned from EWOM-research (needs of modern users) as well as advertising (priming). An own standard for feedback has been developed to create a brand for feedback as well as for gaining computational advantages. Through Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, STOMT learns the language of each company’s community and the company’s behaviour and is thereby aiming for automating the customer dialog.\n\nThe vision is to be the global standard for customer wishes and feedback.\n\nSTOMT was founded in August 2016 by Philipp Zentner and HPI-student Max Klenk.\n\nkern is aiming to build the full-stack for data-centric AI. Their first product is a development tool used by data scientists and subject matter experts to scale data labeling, a task which transforms unstructured, raw data like emails or texts into AI training data. With their application, kern reduces the effort of doing so from months to few days or even hours, while improving the data quality. Ultimately, this significantly improves the quality of AI models, while shortening the dev cycle.\n\nIndustrial Analytics is an industrial IoT B2B vertical company with the aim to support the German industry and machine operators with digitalization.
