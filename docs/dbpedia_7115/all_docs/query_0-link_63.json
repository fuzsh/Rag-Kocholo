        "text": "During his one-year residency with the DAAD in Berlin, Stan Douglas captured the city of Potsdam immediately after the fall of the Berlin Wall in documentary form: Sacrow, the area around Sanssouci, and the Schlaatz housing estate. This series Potsdamer Schrebergärten (1994/95) captures moments of transition: an abandoned dacha, a former wall fence, gardens that have since disappeared; a “Trabbi” (an East German–produced car) parked before a Kleingarten site.\n\nStan Douglas, born 1960 in Vancouver, is a visual artist. He is considered one of the most significant representatives of time-based media art. His films and photographs have been included in exhibitions internationally since the early 1980s, including at Documenta IX, X, and XI (1992, 1997, 2002) and in five Venice Biennales 1990, 2001, 2005, 2019, and 2022 representing Canada. He lives and works in Vancouver and Los Angeles.\n\nThe former terrace restaurant »Minsk«, built in the 1970s in the modernist style of the GDR, has become a place of encounter between modern and contemporary art—and between people. Artworks from the former GDR, which are part of the Hasso Plattner Collection, will be shown here in new contexts."
