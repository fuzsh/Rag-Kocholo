        "text": "Explore Ben Sanderson's exhibition, OUROBOROS, where art transforms into a spatial experience. The gallery becomes a tapestry of temporary rooms crafted from repurposed paintings. Each piece holds intentional 'fronts' and serendipitous 'backs,' playing distinct roles in this artistic narrative. Sanderson invests meticulous energy into the 'fronts,' featuring top-stitched, colour-block patterns housing smaller paintings. A deliberate process unfolds as selected artworks find their place within collaged walls, creating a visual symphony of thoughts. Conversely, the 'backs' reveal a fully improvised artistic journey, surprising even the creator. They embody the repository of subconscious thoughts, akin to crawling through a hedge of creativity. Unplanned and spontaneous, the backs hold fragments that resist categorization. It's a dance of confusion and clarity, where fronts emerge from old backs, and backs are born from old fronts. Ben Sanderson‚Äôs OUROBOROS exhibition invites you to explore this intricate interplay between intention and spontaneity, where every piece tells a unique story. Dive into the realm of transformed art, where the frontiers of creativity are blurred, and the unexpected takes centre stage.

The inventory number on the back also did not match with the Dresden inventory number, so it took some time to identify the painting conclusively.\" On the importance of good collection management practices: photograph the work, make sure it is accessioned, and mark it with the correct accession number. The provenance could have been established years earlier - maybe even 1984 when it came back on the market, had the museum adopted these (hopefully, it is the case at The British Museum). https://lnkd.in/eWYkmygu\n\n'In Silence with Matthew Wong' is a one-of-a-kind in-gallery experience at the Van Gogh Museum. At the end of the Matthew Wong exhibition, you find yourself in one last room. It's dark and spacious with a blue-lit atmosphere. Within this room is just one painting. As you enter the space, you encounter a series of prompts and tips to prepare you for the silent experience: - Allow your eyes and thoughts to wander freely - Focus on a detail, a colour, the composition or the paint strokes - Look at the work from a different angle, or lie down instead of sitting. You might see something completely new. - Reflect on your feelings: what does the work evoke in you? This space serves two purposes. First, with minimal distractions, it allows you to concentrate fully on the single artwork, noticing all the details and nuances more deeply. Secondly, it provides a quiet, peaceful place for reflection on the exhibition's themes away from the busyness of the rest of the museum. It's unlike any other part of the museum. Go and see it if you can! Are there any other examples of galleries with just one painting? I know of 'Room to Breathe' at Manchester Art Gallery from Louise Thompson, with its minimal artwork and comfy sofas. Where else in the world can you do this?

The aesthetic projections take you on a journey through the rich story of porcelain decoration - from landscape painting to modern abstraction. üé• Animated films are precisely projected onto the vases. Thanks to our innovative system, the image can be automatically readjusted in seconds to ensure perfect projections at all times. üëâ Still on display seven years later in the exhibition designed by Meir√© und Meir√© at the Museum Schloss F√ºrstenberg! https://lnkd.in/e3ejCPQM #GROSSE8 #videomapping #projectionmapping #porcelainvases #porcelainexhibition #projections #richhistory #porcelaindecoration #landscapepainting #modernabstraction #culturalheritage #exibition #throwback #tb\n\nBuilding an art collection is a wonderful journey that allows you to express your unique taste and appreciation for creation.

Summoning Memories: Art Beyond Chinese Traditions is a look at how artists of Chinese descent are able to honor their cultural traditions while still pushing creative boundaries. Featuring painting, sculpture, and photography, the exhibit demonstrates a powerful intergenerational dialogue tied to memory and respect. ‚Ä¶ Yun-fei Ji tackles traditional Chinese landscape painting with his handscroll Three Gorges Dam Migration. But in this work, where the creation of a dam has dire consequences in the forms of migration and environmental destruction, the issues are wholly modern. Environmental issues, problems related to urbanization, and China's rapid modernization are just some of the contemporary social issues tackled by the talented group. Collectively they show the power of summoning the past to forge a new path into the future.‚Äù https://lnkd.in/dxfFECMt Show info: https://lnkd.in/dPdTkTUP\n\nBuilding an art collection is a wonderful journey that allows you to express your unique taste and appreciation for creation.
