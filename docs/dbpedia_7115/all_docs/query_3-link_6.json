        "text": "His passion for the game of hockey and desire to win have been evident during his tenure as the Sharks majority owner. Under his stewardship, the team earned its first trip to the Stanley Cup Final (2016), made three appearances in the Western Conference Final (2010, 2011, 2016), posted four 100+ point seasons.Â\n\nIn addition, Plattner has provided resources for the organization's player development system to take major steps forward in several areas. In 2014, he committed the financial backing to re-locate the team's American Hockey League (AHL) development affiliate to California in order to enhance the organization's ability to oversee and develop prospects. Along with that relocation came a large-scale, facility expansion at Sharks Ice at San Jose to house the AHL's San Jose Barracuda, along with a major cosmetic modernization and renovation to the Sharks existing practice facilities.\n\nThose investments have paid immediate dividends as the Barracuda have qualified for the AHL's Playoffs in each of their three seasons in San Jose, including advancing to the Western Conference Final in 2017. In addition, several of the team's players have been recognized with major League awards and the team has consistently developed and funneled players to the Sharks NHL roster.\n\nOff the ice, Plattner has authorized several major upgrades to SAP Center, ensuring the venue remains a world-class facility. Those projects have included the installation of a permanent dehumidification system to ensure SAP Center is capable of maintaining the best ice conditions possible in the Bay Area's temperate climate, a large-scale upgrade of the building's roof, as well as the addition of a state-of-the-art digital media wall on SAP Center's concourse. In 2017, the members-only Lounge opened, providing an all-inclusive dining experience in a luxurious setting on SAP Center's club level.\n\nFor the 2018-19 season, SAP Center has been upgraded with state-of-the-art LED lighting system, that will improve the look of the game in the building, as well as on television. It will also allow for an enhanced game presentation production prior to and during Sharks games.Â\n\nIn Aug. 2017, J.D. Power & Associates, a global market research company, named the San Jose Sharks as the Bay Area's top professional sports franchise for overall fan experience.Â\n\nPlattner's most commendable action came in May 2015 by re-committing the Sharks to the City of San Jose with a ten-year arena management agreement. The new deal will keep the team at SAP Center at San Jose through 2025, with the potential to extend the agreement through 2040. His mandate to the SSE's management team was to craft a deal quickly and fairly with the city of San Jose, without the threat of relocation or excessive public subsidy.Â\n\nPlattner's passions in life are sports, business and science. At SAP, he currently serves as Chairman of the Supervisory Board and as Chief Software Advisor, where he concentrates on defining the medium and long-term technology strategy of SAP. He also heads the Technology Committee of the SAP Supervisory Board.\n\nPlattner has received a number of honors recognizing not only his accomplishments in the business world but his significant track record in giving back to the community. In 1997, he received the Information Technology Leadership Award for Global Integration as part of the Computerworld Smithsonian Awards Program. In 1998, he was inducted into the German Hall of Fame, which honors those who promote economic and social development in Germany. In 2002, the University of Potsdam appointed him an Honorary Doctor, and in 2004, an Honorary Professor. In 2001, Time Magazine Europe ranked Plattner #1 on its list of the most important and influential IT personalities.\n\nPlattner received his master's degree in communications engineering from the University of Karlsruhe. In 1990, the University of Saarbruecken awarded him an honorary doctorate and in 1994 he was granted an honorary full professorship.Â\n\nWell known for his philanthropic efforts, Plattner is a leading private patron of education and research in science and technology. Following his retirement from day-to-day involvement in SAP, Plattner has devoted his time to the promotion of science, innovation and entrepreneurship, as well as to social and cultural projects.\n\nUnder the umbrella of the Hasso Plattner Foundation, he founded the Hasso Plattner Institute for Software Systems Engineering (HPI) in 1998 at the University of Potsdam in Germany, and expanded the HPI with a School of Design Thinking in 2007. He not only fully finances the HPI, but is also actively involved as a director, professor and lecturer in Enterprise Platforms and Integration Concepts.\n\nIn 2005, Plattner established the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford University, informally called the Stanford d.School, which champions methods from the field of design to help people in every function across every industry become more innovative. The Stanford d.School has helped champion the world-wide adoption of Design Thinking, a formal methodology for tackling complex problems that goes beyond traditional brainstorming by re-framing the problem in human-centric ways.\n\nIn addition, Plattner has long been active in the fight against AIDS in South Africa. Â\n\nAlong with being a life-long hockey enthusiast, Plattner is an avid competitive sailor who has participated in numerous 5O5 World Championships, a race for high-performance two-person sailboats, as well as many offshore races. His top sports hero is Jesse Owens, the track and field star who captured four gold medals at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, and his top personal hero as Nelson Mandela for his ability to guide South Africa out of apartheid."
