Kentucky, the Supreme Court sought to both eliminate invidious discrimination in jury selection and to preserve counsel’s use of peremptory challenges.

Thirty-six years later, it is widely recognized that the Batson approach simply does not work.\n\nThis program was about an alternative approach to jury selection proposed by former New Jersey Superior Court Judge Martin Cronin. Judge Cronin explained this alternative approach, which is primarily based upon due process rather than equal protection; the rights of the prospective jurors rather than only those of the litigants; juror inclusion rather than exclusion; individual juror competency rather than group stereotyping; and the citizenship which unites us rather than any group classification which may divide us.\n\nA panel discussion followed, which was moderated by the Honorable Joseph A.
