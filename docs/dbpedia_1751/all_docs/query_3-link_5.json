        "text": "The parents of Saratoga, California, teen Audrie Pott settled a wrongful death case Friday with the parents of two boys who sexually assaulted her before she committed suicide in 2012, according to a spokesman for the Santa Clara County Superior Court.\n\nThe two boys, who were 16 at the time of the incident, are now 18 years old. Lawyers for a third boy arranged a settlement with Pott's parents late last month.\n\nPott was 15 years old when she attended an unsupervised party in Saratoga on Sept. 2, 2012.\n\nAn attorney for Pott's parents said their daughter had fallen unconscious after drinking alcohol when the three boys sexually assaulted her and someone took one or more photos of the assault. At least one photo was shared with others, sent out by text, emailed and posted on Facebook.\n\nThe boys removed Pott's clothing and wrote on her body with a felt pen, the wrongful death suit said.\n\nEight days later, Pott tried to kill herself. She hanged herself, went into a coma and died after being removed from life support.\n\nInsurance companies for the parents of the two boys will pay $950,000 as part of the settlement announced Friday.\n\nSuperior court spokesman Joseph Macaluso said the parents of the boys want people know the money will be paid by their homeowner's insurance policies\n\nHow much of the $950,000 each family will pay was not immediately available.\n\nThe settlement includes 12 non-monetary terms as well.\n\nThe defendants must admit to the truth of the allegations in the criminal complaints that pertain to Pott on the record before Judge Brian Walsh, who presided over the case.\n\nEach defendant must publish an apology that says they committed the acts against Pott and shared images of her with others. The apology says that the defendants would like others to know that words about someone's character can alter someone's life. The defendants must also support an effort to have Pott granted an honorary diploma from Saratoga High School where she was a sophomore when she died.\n\nThe settlement requires the defendants to make a public verbal apology on the record in front of Walsh, similar to the one to be published.\n\nEach defendant is to give 10 presentations to high school students or other youth on the issues of sexting, disseminating nude photographs, soliciting nude photographs, slut shaming and spreading rumors and the dangers of alcohol and drugs.\n\nSexting is the sending or sharing of sexually explicit text messages or images by email or social media.\n\nThe defendants will face a monetary penalty if the terms of the settlement are not met. The penalty could be as little as $5,000 or as much as $100,000.\n\nThe settlement says the public apologies must be completed by Monday."
