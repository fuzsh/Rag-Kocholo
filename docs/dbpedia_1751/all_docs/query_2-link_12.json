        "text": "November 2, 2023 By Carol Britton Meyer\n\nNo new evidence was presented today during a scheduled pre-trial conference at Norfolk Superior Court in the case of Cohasset resident Brian Walshe, 48, who is accused of murdering his wife, Ana, 39, last January. Walshe’s appearance was waived.\n\nThe next court date is January 2024. DNA analysis is crucial to the case.\n\nDuring the conference, the attorneys and the judge discussed the next steps in the forensic process.\n\nA pretrial hearing was rescheduled from Aug. 23 to Nov. 2 because both prosecutors and the defense team were still awaiting the new DNA results.\n\nWalsh was arrested following an intensive investigation by the Cohasset Police Department and the Massachusetts State Police after Ana disappeared in the early morning hours of Jan. 2, 2023.\n\nLast March, Walshe was indicted by a grand jury on charges that included murder, misleading a police investigation/obstruction of justice and improper conveyance of a human body. He is being held without bail.\n\nWalshe is also accused of using his son’s iPad to Google the best ways to get rid of a body, among a number of other searches."
