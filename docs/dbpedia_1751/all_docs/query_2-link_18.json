        "text": "Hon. Brian C. Walsh began his service in the Eastern District of Missouri on January 17, 2023. He is based in St. Louis and also presides in the court’s Southeast Division in Cape Girardeau.\n\nBrian graduated from Duke University in 1993 and Harvard Law School in 1996. During law school, he was a research assistant to Visiting Professor Kenneth Klee and a member of the editorial board of the Harvard Journal on Legislation. After a clerkship with Judge Pasco Bowman of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, he practiced for eight years with King & Spalding in Atlanta and 17 more with Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner (BCLP) in St. Louis. He was the leader of BCLP’s restructuring practice group for four years.\n\nMuch of Brian’s practice involved commercial restructuring, but he also argued about 20 appeals, first-chaired two jury trials, and specialized at times in Y2K law and actuarial malpractice. He taught in the Appellate Clinic at Washington University School of Law for eight years, supervising students as they briefed and argued appeals in the Sixth and Eighth Circuits. He was elected a Fellow of the American College of Bankruptcy in 2017.\n\nCongratulations and welcome, Judge Walsh!"
