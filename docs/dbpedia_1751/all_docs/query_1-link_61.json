Alternatively, an order was sought directing the Director of Public Prosecutions to publish guidelines as to the different prosecution considerations when dealing with a person who had assisted another in committing suicide. It was her view that there was a right to die in extreme circumstances but that this was not reflected in the absolute terms of the aforementioned legislation. The appellant\"s claim was refused and an appeal was launched seeking the same relief except the order for the publication of guidelines on assisted suicide.\n\nIt was the appellant\"s case that as a sufferer of multiple sclerosis, she suffered a great deal of pain, faced a significant number of problems in everyday life, and required the constant attention by carers. It was her desire to be able to die at a time of her choosing in a peaceful and dignified manner. In order to do so, she wished to have the assistance of her partner who was prepared to act in such a role if it was considered lawful. She claimed that s. 2(2) of the Criminal Law (Suicide) Act 1993, which prevented such assistance, was repugnant to Article 40.3.2 of the constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights (specifically Article 14 on disability discrimination). She recognised there was a public interest in refusing to legalise euthanasia but it was her view that a limited exception should exist for disabled persons who are suffering from a terminal and who are able to express their wishes to lawfully receive assistance from a person in ending their life. She contended that the absolute ban on assisted suicide was a disproportionate measure.\n\nThe respondent contended that the Irish Constitution did not expressly or implicitly confer a right to die and that the enforcement of the legislation was in the public interest and took priority over an individual\"s right to seek assistance in committing suicide. Further, the same position was submitted in relation to the European Convention on Human Rights including disability discrimination under Article 14.\n\nHeld by the court that whilst it was true that a complete statutory ban that interfered with an individual\"s autonomy would require strong justification, the Criminal Law (Suicide) Act 1993 including s. 2(2) was a justifiable infringement due to public protection considerations and the Article 40.3.2 of the Irish Constitution\"s duty of the state to protect life. It was further noted that whilst suicide was no longer considered a crime, there was no express or implicit right within the Irish Constitution to be able to commit suicide, whether assisted or not. As no right existed, no disability discrimination consideration arose. The appellant\"s case was seen as similar to Pretty v. United Kingdom (Application No. 2346.02) where the European Court of Human Rights held that it was for the member states to assess the likely consequences of a relaxation of assisted suicide legislation with the introduction of exceptions. It was held that when the Criminal Law (Suicide) Act 1993 was made, proper consideration had been given and the decision to make an absolute ban was valid. The stance that the court was taking was therefore determined to be in accordance with the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights and therefore the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nAppeal refused."
