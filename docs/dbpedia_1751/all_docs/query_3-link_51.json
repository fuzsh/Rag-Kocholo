        "text": "It’s like our track Olympians are posing for the cover of Vogue and then casually just running the fastest time ever https://lnkd.in/eXeFS4kW Seeing WNBA (Women's National Basketball Association) Star Angel Reese x Reebok debut and the sneak peak for Caitlyn Clark at Nike got me thinking of course Mark Cuban predicted a few months ago that 2 industries will be the ‘next wave of revenue generation in sports Real estate and entertainment The truth is, Nike and Reebok's sneaker deals are starting to feel like relics of last century Don't get me wrong – they still grab headlines But they're no longer the endgame b/c A LOGO NO LONGER MAKES A BRAND These power houses are the brand See $28 BILLION Nike market cap wipe out overnight The future lies in merchandise that goes beyond athletic wear and past a mere transaction with experiences and entertainment that builds a world around our athletic icons and where they keep the majority of the value they create and share it with their fans (creator-to-manufacturer!) for generational wealth Why keep feeding the greedy pockets of brands that don't serve her In this new paradigm, athletes aren't just competing on the field; they're vying for attention in the 1.6 billion person arena of TikTok The explosive growth of UGC during the Olympics (a staggering 1,828% increase from Tokyo to Paris) underscores this shift Athletes are no longer just track stars; they're content creators and brand builders The decline of traditional media, exemplified by Warner Bros. Discovery's $9.1 billion write-down yesterday of cable network value emphasizes the need for new ENGAGEMENT strategies beyond just an ecomm grid Athletes need partners who understand the dynamics of real-time engagement and know where the audience's attention truly lies in real time every single minute to create content before the conversation / trend peaks Partners who have built the technology to connect the trends to the fans and can help them navigate the social commerce landscape effectively And with an unrivaled supply chain network that convert that real time demand into the highest quality products no matter what the need is beyond a sneaker The job this era is to monetize social media users, and female athletes are uniquely positioned to do so Because female athletes drive 2x engagement with ½ the followers And women drive 85% of all purchasing decisions It just doesn't appear our giants have entered the female driven social commerce chat yet Oh and Howard University's basketball coach is looking for a $100M investment... Oh what an authentic and entertaining fan-fueled universe that could be #thegreatfashionreset #creatortomanufacturer #communitycommerce #contentistheproduct #creatorsarethestores\n\nUniversal Music Group shares plummeted 25% last week Like mass fashion, it hasn't figured out social video + CGC Consumer Generated Content is THE way to grow It's a market growing so fast that it is encroaching on professionally produced Hollywood content Accenture recently reported 59% of consumers say they regard user generated content as equally entertaining as traditional media That's a seismic shift! It's starting to feel like really smart people (who get paid millions) are just in denial Mass fashion is facing its biggest losses in history because we can't manage what we don't measure It's absolutely impossible to run a successful retail operation today without measuring individual real time behavior There's a false sense of how consumer-centric brands really are based on checking outdated boxes Look at Nike... Over 300 MILLION followers (check!) yet only 509 people shared their content last month And in that same time period suffered their biggest loss in history I believe the biggest wastage in the fashion industry is the one caused by lack of actionable insights leading to poor decision making we haven’t organized around self expression yet And I don't mean actual fashion choices You are now literally competing with everyone expressing themselves with an iphone To cut through 202k years worth of content watched daily, you need to know how to react at the speed of culture and with whom and why to create content that resonates The opposite of brands suddenly talking about #bratsummer on August 10th A month after it went viral You have to be on it like Field Roast a plant-based bratwurst company was when on July 2nd they debuted a neon billboard that payed homage to Charli XCX's Brat within 2 days of launch Big cultural moments don’t happen every day - they peak at day 14 and go into sharp decline by day 18 No one cares right now, especially the algorithm But the data is just the start In terms of frontline success - a total overhaul of the business model is required and it starts and ends with community Forget about superfans of which they haven't done anything notable with anyway I'd care more about super consumers Commerce is a $26 Trillion industry, significantly more runway than the entire music industry... It's tough to get this right if you’ve checked the boxes differently for the last 100 years Community isn't just an industry headline Real people's shared interests are the way forward TikTok is has been TV for 7 years Audiences tell us what they like NOW And they sure do care about blue collar creators and stay at home moms generating 110M views and hundreds of thousands of sales right now lol If you attached their needs direct to manufacturer, a whole new growth category is born #thegreatfashionreset #creatortomanufacturer #communitycommerce #contentistheproduct #creatorsarethestore\n\nByteDance out there in 2050 while American mass fashion stuck in its pre-2000 glory days After yesterday's news of Amazon and TikTok joining forces for in-app shopping Bytedance unveiled an AI video app to rival SORA AI today This is social commerce on rocket steroids in an enclosed creator-content driven commerce eco-system that decimated our market already ByteDance's AI video app will flood TikTok with infinity x a gazillion stream of hyper-personalized, trend-setting fashion content Combine ByteDance's AI with TikTok's algorithm and Amazon's data... it's a personalization trifecta that'll make your \"targeted\" ads look like spam Every user becomes a potential AI-powered fashion influencer The line between UGC and brand content? Gone AI can generate and test thousands of fashion worlds / concepts / movies in minutes for billions of consumers It will make it frictionless to become your own store Your one and done seasonal campaign? RIP The numbers don't lie And they are just getting scarier You thought competing with Amazon's convenience and TikTok's virality was going to be tough? Add ByteDance's AI to the mix, and it's not even funny anymore The only way forward? Build genuine communities that AI can't replicate (yet) Focus on the human touch IRL Collaborate with creators who break through with relatability, entertainment, education, joy, connection And serve them every way imaginable Because when the world's largest convenience marketplace joins forces with the trendiest / fastest entertainment / commerce platform and then the parent company drops an AI bomb... it's GAME OVER for mass fashion as we know it But for real this time The future isn't coming It's here And it's AI-powered, community-driven, and moving at the speed of light Creators as brands direct to manufacture is the only way... Evolve or evaporate The clock is tiktoking, and ByteDance just pressed warp speed forward #thegreatfashionreset #creatortomanufacturer #communitycommerce #contentistheproduct #creatorsarethestores\n\nBREAKING NEWS Amazon and TikTok join forces for in-app shopping (Source: The Information) Just holy sh!t In a move that will have MAJOR implications for an already decimated mass fashion industry (!!!!!) Amazon and TikTok have announced a groundbreaking partnership that will allow TikTok users to seamlessly purchase products directly from Amazon ads within TikTok's app... All made possible through new \"shopping ads\" that enable TikTok users to link their social media accounts to their Amazon profiles Once linked, users can leverage their saved Amazon payment and shipping information to complete purchases without ever leaving the TikTok app This is literally your FINAL warning mass fashion By allowing TikTok users to purchase items directly from video ads, Amazon will capitalize on the impulse of viral fashion trends and consumers' excitement in the moment Pretty huge when you consider 97% of Gen Z discover new fashion trends from ugc and 83% buy instantly b/c the content is so good (Forbes + Sprout Social, Inc.) These #'s i've been reporting for YEARS have never been small lol But suddenly seem so much important when hitched to America's largest convenience marketplace Brands that fail to embrace this tsunami of a shift and integrate their e-commerce with content / entertainment / community experiences will cease to exist soon You simply can not not ever never compete with lowest price, delightful discovery, and fastest delivery The only way forward is creator / community brands to move beyond the transaction Because when 2 of America's biggest marketplaces join forces #1 and #4 respectively as I reported just 72 hours ago!!!! it's game over for mass fashion Thankfully, we've been planning Since Tomorrow #thegreatfashionreset #creatortomanufacturer #communitycommerce #contentistheproduct #creatorsarethestor\n\nI am working w/the world’s sweetest creator She writes notes to my daughters, always remembers to ask about something we last chatted about, & constantly thinks about how everything will impact her audience She answers all the comments on YouTube, TikTok, & Instagram personally Crazy considering she has 38M followers We did an extensive deep dive into her audience She has a disproportionate # of evangelists People who constantly share her content, support her in the comments, buy everything she promotes for brands Obviously she should have her own brand – why get paid a few thousand for a single post vs owning 1/2 of the massive revenue you generate FOREVER As much as I talk about community on TikTok b/c they enabled 2 way conversations TikTok owns the data Our creator doesn't know if the people in her audience will convert to commerce TikTok Shop is just a massive volume game right now Creators receive thousands of dm's a week from brands Look at this shirt – 1.25K creators created a sales TikTok Yet it only generated $13.28k GMV How can you compete in that environment? vs the #1 selling dress from our creator’s favorite brand Mirror Palais today it's $995 on preorder People are spending & will wait if it’s special mass fashion has become one giant bland assortment where price is the only lever left To compete in an era of infinite content, you must aspire to be more and to give more You want to create something people care about Something that commands an emotional response Brands are struggling to compete in the the $11.1 trillion social commerce market by 2030 If you’re all producing the same things, sold by the same top 1% of commerce creators, you can see the issue so obviously we will create a real community for our creator's top supporters and provide extreme value to them The more value you give, the more value you’ll receive in return It’s time to arm the creators w/tools to succeed b/c the algo does not reward people already in the wave - you’ve got to hit it b4 the peak You need to know who the communities are + what they care about in order to make that work It's not a buzzword The value/meaning of everything online happens w/what people care about & share But beware of the sudden community experts How much have you heard about the communities they track? The values/interests they share? What concerns them right now? The era of mass fashion & faceless brands catering to the lowest common denominator is ending The most successful creators aren't just selling stuff - they're cultivating passionate fan bases that evangelize on their behalf B4 THEY EVER SELL A THING They've tapped into something deeper, something that speaks to people on an emotional level, makes them feel seen, heard, & valued It's time to leave the bland, soulless corporatism behind to compete #thegreatfashionreset #creatortomanufacturer #communitycommerce #contentistheproduct #creatorsarethestore\n\nBREAKING NEWS TikTok Shop, not even a year old, is outperforming our e-commerce giants in summer promotional sales: TikTok Shop: 3.6% of annual sales Amazon: 2.7% Wayfair: 2.4% Target (online + in-store): 2.2% Walmart Online: 2.0% Source: Earnest Analytics Social commerce is no longer the future It's NOW Gen Z behavior is reshaping retail faster than anticipated, although some of us have been preaching for over 5 YEARS lol This is a seismic piece of data considering TikTok Shop hasn't even turned one Oh and there's this - they are the #4 marketplace in the U.S. by sales bypassing Walmart by a landslide The line between entertainment and shopping is blurring at an unprecedented rate... We've got to organize around our new reality where content, community, and commerce converge Or we won't be able to participate in the $11.1 TRILLION market by 2030 Keep in mind 100% of U.S. shopping apps and 100% of the top ecomm sites are all C2M these aren't small percentages And it's going to get significantly harder as more people become creators Feels like community data this era is gold :) #thegreatfashionreset #creatortomanufacturer #communitycommerce #contentistheproduct #creatorsarethestore\n\nCommunity runs the internet It’s how trends, product development, & commerce work Brands can’t respond in real time for 3 reasons 1.They have no idea which communities are responsible for which trends 2.Trends move fast and their supply chain leadtimes are a year long 3.They haven’t realized content is the product But most of all c-suits don’t care about people Like this mom turned creator who just turned 50 this week But the laughs are on them because she generated $438K GMV in the last 30 days The disconnect between traditional brands and community-driven trends is costing them dearly, while empowering a new generation of consumers turned creators This mom is not a fashion industry executive or a big-name designer Instead, she's speaking directly to her audience of 45-55 year old women, sharing how to find #dupes that actually fit their changing bodies Why is she succeeding where major brands are failing? Authenticity - she's living the same experiences as her audience Responsiveness - she can spot and react to the trends her community cares about in real-time She's part of the community she serves, not an outsider looking in And certainly not one trying to command and control or shame her by not understanding her changing body needs So this one individual, speaking authentically to her community, outperformed countless traditional fashion doors in just a month This is the new reality of fashion Content is the new storefront Community is the new mall Current KPIs of influencer marketing are missing the forest for the trees They're obsessed w/follower counts, views, engagement rates, emv, & reach But they're completely overlooking the real metric that matters: GMV They're still thinking in old-world terms They see creators as glorified billboards, not as the new retail frontline These outdated metrics can't capture the true power of a 50-year-old mom turned creator She might not have millions of followers or a blue checkmark Her engagement rate might not top the charts But she just generated $438K in GMV in 30 days That's not influence - that's direct sales power Traditional KPIs are measuring the wrong things b/c they're solving the wrong problem They're trying to quantify \"influence\" when they should be measuring \"trust\" and \"conversion\" This creator isn't just influencing purchasing decisions She's becoming THE purchasing decision She's not a middleman between brands and consumers She is the brand She is the store She is the product And until influencer marketing metrics evolve to capture this new reality, they'll keep overlooking the real powerhouses of the new creator economy The future of retail isn't just influenced by creators It's owned by them and their communities It doesn't matter how good your product is if you don't get this... Evolve to serve her or evaporate #thegreatfashionreset #creatortomanufacturer #communitycommerce #contentistheproduct #creatorsarethestore\n\nI've tracked fashion trends obsessively since SHEIN While mass fashion slept they grew to $35B est. in annual revenue A staggering 808% CAGR in a decade! Their secret? Responding to REAL TIME UGC In 2018 I manually tracked TRILLIONS of engagements from 32 communities W/ZERO market supply from American mass fashion Hence historic losses from our giants For US fashion to thrive We have to get good at the art of community b/c that’s how commerce works Roblox just surpassed 10M+ total concurrent users for the 1st time what I think is waay more interesting is that 20.08M COMMUNITIES have been created on the platform 5.92K TODAY alone Players join groups that feature their INTERESTS Where there is no marketing, just UGC It brings me back to trends b/c Americans love them Roblox players change their avatar 8x/day LY Americans took the lead in global spending on Roblox's app, contributing 48% of total expenditure It got me thinking.... Only in the game can you keep up w/the insatiable desire for trends In 48hrs this very in demand dress I was tracking sold out in 3 prints But it comes in many more... That’s a lot of physical unsold inventory for the prints that don’t resonate And prints are personal so it's always a risk The problem w/mass fashion’s forecasting tools is that they’re too slow to tell you what’s trending w/consumers creating, commenting, sharing, engaging quicker than ever before by shared INTERESTS... We need a tech stack that discovers trends by community in real time & reacts to only what matters Since Tomorrow On Roblox you can track the 20M communities + each individual player wherever they go, whatever they look, or interact w/ Feels like a gamer changer if you could feed this really important hyper personalized intel direct to suppliers vs brands paying WGSN to create the exact same things it's why we have the largest inventory distortion in history at a $1.77T loss Gen Z is different than other generations b/c 65% identify as a creator It's time to equip them w/tools to meet their communities where they are, share the upside, & give them their data This is how America can compete again Look no further than “Skibidi Toilet” Yes, that's right Nothing comes close to this type of growth in Hollywood according to Adam Goodman, former president of Paramount Pictures Community-driven business models are revolutionizing all culture related industries You can't just phone it in w/ a single $60k job rec for a community manager lol The whole value chain must transform to help women b/c women drive the economy We need more leaders like Flavor Flav who answered the call from the captain of the women's US polo team who could no longer afford to compete “As a girl dad and supporter of all women’s sports, imma personally sponsor you, my girl, whatever you need. And imma sponsor the whole team” #thegreatfashionreset #creatortomanufacturer #communitycommerce #contentistheproduct #creatorsarethestore\n\nMy favorite data discovery this year!! In April I predicted the #milkmaid dress would be a hot seller right about NOW b/c it had a 572% spike in search on TikTok/Google/Instagram vs March Plus there was limited market supply It's a reasonable amount of time to design, fabricate, fit, seed to creators, & ship for July/Aug selling Against the 491 attributes consumers wanted according to our data Since Tomorrow Read that again... 491 attributes vs the \"sweaters\" Trendalytics predicted yesterday would be in demand this winter White was obviously a given... But another key attribute was polka dots as I reported the same week :) https://lnkd.in/e6e9XGPi So it is w/great interest to see the milkmaid dress is the #1 selling sku for Moda Operandi, Inc, Reformation, & Frankies Bikinis today It's not only #1 at Frankie's but 2, 3, & 5 and SOLD OUT in most skus Very interesting since 2227 swimsuits & just 184 dresses are for sale Moda has over 20k styles & Reformation 1700 - milkmaid beat so many options But they're ALL so expensive! Mass fashion is in its flop era b/c they pay trend forecasters to \"predict\" demand a year ahead of real time market and they can’t chase even the most basic products in 3 months Let alone 3 weeks To be fair moda got lucky b/c they can't either... Creators who partner w/operators that understand the new cycle of product development + marketing is a 24/7 continuous cycle & not a seasonal or one off campaign & have organized around it will be successful brands this era Creators, athletes, musicians will become owners B/c it's silly to rent on platforms like Amazon, LTK, TikTok, Instagram etc that own your data If a ban really happens, then what? One off sponsorships don't generate wealth equity partnerships w/operators who have the end to end experience of connecting all the digital trending dots, building communities, brands, high quality products, + media level on trend content Who can find the market gaps pre-virality to ensure optimal success will Not conmen middlemen who skim 25% off the top for doing nothing Ownership is the key Athletes in particular are just highly compensated employees paying high taxes While team owners get all the tax breaks b/c ownership is seen as a personal risk to help the economy NOW is the time for athletes to build lifestyle brands (see Nike historic loss) In the next few years, AI will transform all product decision-making w/real-time data analysis that generates actionable recommendations based on individual behavior, streamlining qualitative/quantitative data in mere seconds to the right high-quality manufacturer... And back to the community to amplify demand Athletes who align w/fan expectations + market trends today will have 1st mover advantage Especially when you consider all the suppliers brands have pi$$ed off have all the power right now #thegreatfashionreset #creatortomanufacturer #communitycommerce #contentistheproduct #creatorsarethestores"
