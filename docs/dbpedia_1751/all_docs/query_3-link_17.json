        "text": "A WORRY-racked friend of Ana Walshe's said her skin was left crawling when she saw the missing mom's husband smile after being charged with lying to police about her disappearance.\n\nNatasha Babushkina told The U.S. Sun that following Brian Walshe's arrest, her hopes and beliefs that Ana is still alive are diminishing considerably with each passing day.\n\nAna, a 39-year-old real estate executive, was last seen alive on Jan. 1 at the Cohasset, Massachusetts home she shares with her 47-year-old husband and their three kids.\n\nBrian told police she left early that morning, taking a rideshare service to Boston's Logan International Airport to fly to Washington D.C for work but she never made the flight.\n\nBrian, who was on parole for fraud, has since been arrested for allegedly lying to police about his movements in the aftermath of his wife's disappearance.\n\nInvestigators have since claimed that Brian searched \"how to dispose of 115-pound woman's body\" online and bought $450 worth of cleaning supplies from a Home Depot in the days after Ana was last seen.\n\nHe was arraigned in Quincy District Court on Monday, pleading not guilty, and was pictured smiling as he was escorted to the courthouse in handcuffs.\n\nThe unsettling spectacle left Natasha outraged and made her skin crawl.\n\n\"How dare he smile!\" exclaimed Natasha, who has known Ana for more than two years.\n\n\"You don’t smile when your wife is missing and you’re accused of lying to the police about her disappearance.\n\n\"I don’t know what kind of human being would do that, but this is not a fun or funny situation.\n\n\"It makes me angry, furious,\" she added. \"How dare you smile when Ana is missing and your children and going to be publicly affected. My skin was crawling.\n\n\"I cannot imagine that something happens to one of your relatives and you would be smiling while being taken into custody by police - unless you are a real psychopath.\"\n\nFEARS MOUNT\n\nIn the days since Brian's arrest, a search of the Walshe family home has yielded traces of blood in the basement, in addition to the discovery of a broken, blood-stained knife.\n\nAdditional evidence believed to be linked to Ana's disappearance was recovered from a trash transfer station earlier this week. Those items include a hacksaw, hatchet, and a blood-stained rug.\n\nNatasha said she was suspicious of Brian's version of events from the very beginning.\n\nAs more troubling evidence comes to light, Natasha said her optimism that Ana will be found alive is quickly fading.\n\n\"Of course, nothing good comes to your mind,\" Natasha said after hearing what Brian initially told the police.\n\n\"It’s easy to track everything nowadays, so if Ana left with Uber or Lyft you would be able to track it - but there was no track and her phone pinged to the house the day after he said she left.\n\n\"Well then, how did she leave without a phone? The facts didn’t add up.\"\n\nCiting Brian's criminal past, she added: \"And because he lied in the past about the artwork [...] it does not speak highly of the integrity of the person.\n\n\"I don't want to make any assumptions, honestly, until anything is proven, of course.\n\n\"But it's shocking because you never really know people, right?\"\n\nNatasha said she believes there's a \"one in a million\" chance that Ana hasn't been killed - though it's a slither of hope she continues to cling to.\n\nShe added: \"It's been a very sad few days [...] I feel less optimistic. I just wish they would find her soon.\n\n\"There’s a one-in-a-million chance now that someone would be missing for 10 days, with the world searching for her, that she will now be found - unless someone has stolen her and she’s in someone’s basement.\n\n\"I just don’t know, but from my perspective, it doesn’t look good, unfortunately.\n\n\"I’m holding onto the tiny hope she will be found. But I hope the truth of what happened will be found at least.\"\n\nCHECKERED PAST\n\nBrian Walshe's checkered past has been thrust into the spotlight in recent days as the search for Ana continues to intensify.\n\nHe was arrested in 2018 and charged with stealing two Andy Warhol paintings from an ex-college classmate and then using them to produce knockoffs that he sold on eBay for $80,000.\n\nHe pleaded guilty to wire fraud, interstate transportation to defraud, possession of converted goods, and unlawful monetary transaction in April 2021 and was still awaiting sentencing for those charges when Ana vanished.\n\nAna wrote a gushing letter to the judge presiding over the case in an effort to seek leniency, opining about the \"joy\" and \"comfort\" his presence brings to their family.\n\nShe also heaped praise on Brian for helping to save her mother when she suffered a brain aneurysm in Dec. 2021.\n\n“Not only did he save her life, but he also brought her and the entire family comfort and joy during the course of her illness,” Ana wrote.\n\n“Brian has expressed to me on many occasions his regret for his past actions,\" she added elsewhere.\n\n\"He has a big heart and he impacts everyone around him in a way that will surpass the present moment. He has been the leader to our family and an inspiration to all he comes into contact with.”\n\nBrian's psychiatrist, identified in court documents as Dr. Tittmann, also penned a letter to the judge, who suggested unresolved childhood trauma may be to blame for his misdeeds.\n\n“Brian felt neglected, unloved, and emotionally damaged from being used as a pawn by his parents in their acrimonious marital relationship,\" wrote Tittmann, adding that Brian later dropped out of school and admitted himself to a psychiatric facility.\n\n“His depression, anxiety, and anger left him unable to function,\" he added.\n\n“There he started his long battle to overcome his mental illness.”\n\nHow dare you smile! I don’t know what kind of human being would do that [...] unless you are a real psychopath\n\nNatasha Babushkina\n\nPrior to the bogus art saga, Brian was accused of stealing nearly a million dollars from his estranged father in 2009.\n\nHe was also accused of later breaking into his father's home in India after his death in 2018, stealing thousands of dollars worth of artwork, and destroying his will.\n\nIn bombshell court documents unearthed by Law & Crime, Brian was additionally accused of bizarrely attempting to kill 'four or five' people when he was caught smuggling in China in 2019.\n\n\"I witnessed firsthand what Brian was capable of,\" wrote Fred Pescatore, a friend of Brian's dad, in a probate court affidavit.\n\n\"I saw Brian attempt to smuggle out antiquities from China. When Brian was confronted, he picked up a stanchion and literally attempted to kill four or five guards that had come to talk to him about his crime.\n\n\"Brian is not only a sociopath but also a very angry and physically violent person.\"\n\nAVOIDING THE SUBJECT\n\nWhile Natasha never met Brian personally, she said Ana would always talk \"highly\" of their relationship, but often changed the subject whenever his name was mentioned.\n\n\"She was not very open about the past with her husband or what he does,\" said Natasha.\n\n\"Ana would never mention what he was doing professionally, which I thought was really odd, but I knew there was a pending case against him and that she was the breadwinner of the family.\"\n\nNatasha, who said she last spoke to Ana a few months ago, said her friend never mentioned anything about problems between her and Brian.\n\nShe never mentioned what - if any - strains Brian's arrest may have placed on their relationship, according to Natasha.\n\nNatasha said: \"Ana was free-spirited and in my eyes more successful than her husband.\n\n\"He was trying to keep up with her. But I know for sure she was more of a breadwinner, fixing all the problems in the family.\n\n\"It's hard to say [if they had any relationship issues] because Ana would avoid the conversation about what happened to her husband.\n\n\"We did know about him misrepresenting the Warhol paintings [...] he was caught in the lies and it was all still hanging over him.\n\n\"But when it came to her husband, Ana would just always change the subject.\"\n\n'A SHINING LIGHT'\n\nCalling Ana one of the best people she's ever known, Natasha said it's inconceivable to her that anyone could ever wish to do the mom of three harm.\n\nNatasha says she's hoping the news is all just a bad dream, one she will soon awake from, but she concedes with each passing day the odds Ana will be found unharmed are further stacked against her beloved friend.\n\nShe is also desperately concerned for the welfare of Anna's three young boys, who are all aged between two and six.\n\nThe children are currently in the care of the Department of Children and Families.\n\nNatasha and a group of Ana's other friends are working to find a Serbian translator so they can contact Ana's mother and arrange for her to fly over to the US.\n\nThey're also working to get Ana's children out of the state's care and fostered into the home of a friend or family member.\n\nNatasha is offering her own home as a refuge for the children, should the state accept her proposal.\n\n\"As a mother, I feel the worst for her children,\" she said.\n\n\"In one day it seems they've lost their mother and their father.\n\n\"I have no idea how they will live and cope with all this. I hope therapy will help them but you just never know.\"\n\nRemembering Ana, Natasha, who is Ukrainian, added: \"I hope she's still alive and that she will be here.\n\n\"I wish she would pick up the phone and for all this to just be some bad dream.\n\n\"It's the same way I feel about the war in Ukraine; one day I would wake up and this would all be over.\n\n\"Ana was giving, an incredibly high achiever, and ambitious. She was a visionary. She was always social, well-presented, well-dressed, and [...] the light of the party.\n\n\"It's crazy to me that someone could do any harm to her. She was an A-plus in every area and one of the best people I've ever known.\""
