Boston criminal defence attorney Tracy Miner told the court that her client had contacted Tishman Speyer to notify them Ms Walshe was missing.\n\nRachel Sharp18 January 2023 15:55\n\n1674057935\n\nBrian Walshe chose murder instead of divorce, claim prosecutors\n\nBrian Walshe chose to murder and dismember his wife instead of divorcing her, according to prosecutors as they laid out the case against him in court on Wednesday.\n\nIn the lead up to the 1 January murder, prosecutors said that Mr Walshe carried out an internet search about his divorce options.\n\n“Best state for divorce for a man,” he allegedly googled on 27 December.\n\nFive days later, he allegedly beat her death in their home and dismembered her body.\n\n“Rather than divorce, Brian Walshe dismembered Ana Walshe and discarded her body,” the prosecutor said.\n\nRachel Sharp18 January 2023 16:05\n\n1674059124\n\nBrian Walshe’s attorney accuses prosecutors of leaking evidence\n\nAfter Brian Walshe’s court appearance, his attorney Tracy Miner released a blistering statement accusing prosecutors of leaking evidence to the media.\n\n“In my experience, where, as here, the prosecution leaks so called evidence to the press before they provide it to me, their case isn’t that strong,” Ms Miner said in a statement to The Independent.\n\n“I am not going to comment on the evidence, first because I am going to try this case in the court and not in the media.”\n\nMs Miner said it was “easy to charge a crime and even easier to say a person committed that crime”.\n\n“It is a much more difficult thing to prove it, which we will see if the prosecution can do.”\n\n“We shall see what they have and what evidence is admissible in court, where the case will ultimately be decided.”\n\nBevan Hurley18 January 2023 16:25\n\n1674059882\n\nAna Walshe vanished on New Years.
