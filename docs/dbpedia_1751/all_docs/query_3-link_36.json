        "text": "Date of crime Defendant(s) Crime Location Sentence Time served Legally exonerated 1255 71 Jews Murder of Hugh of Lincoln Lincoln, England Death Unknown No Hugh was a nine-year-old boy whose body was recovered from a well belonging to a Jewish man named Copin.[a] Copin gave a false confession which implicated other Jews in Hugh's murder after being promised immunity. King Henry III ordered that 91 local Jews be tried for the murder. Several were executed for refusal to plead (Copin was also executed on Henry's orders),[127] two were released and the remaining 71 were found guilty of the murder. They were condemned to death but released when the king's brother Richard interceded on their behalf.[128] 1660 John, Richard and Joan Perry Murder and robbery of William Harrison Chipping Campden, England Death Executed No Wealthy 70-year-old Harrison was last seen walking to Charingworth. After his hat, coat and neckband were found on the side of the road with a sharp cut and sprinkled in blood, his servant John Perry claimed that Perry's own brother and mother had murdered Harrison to rob him, and subsequently dumped the body in a pond. The pond was drained but no body was found. The Perrys then alternated between pleading guilt and innocence, until they were all found guilty and hanged. However, Harrison reappeared in 1662, claiming to have been abducted by Barbary pirates. It has been claimed that this case caused British courts to not give murder sentences without a body for the next 250 years.[citation needed] 1678 Thomas Whitbread Treason – conspiracy to murder King Charles II London Execution Executed No Convicted and executed on the perjured evidence of Titus Oates. 1679 Robert Green, Henry Berry and Lawrence Hill Murder London Death Executed No Robert Green, Henry Berry and Lawrence Hill were hanged in 1679 at Greenberry Hill on false evidence for the unsolved murder of Edmund Berry Godfrey. Historians accept they were innocent. 1705 Thomas Green, Madder, and Simpson, and a ships crew Murder and Piracy Edinburgh Death Executed Partial The 21-year-old Captain Green of the Worcester, an English East Indiaman, his first mate, and a gunner were executed, after their crew, ship and cargo were seized and sold, on being forced into the River Forth by weather. The whole ship's crew had been detained, and charged on an invented Murder and Piracy charges, in retaliation for a Scotch East Indiaman Annandale being seized in the Thames. 1835 James Pratt and John Smith Sodomy London Death Executed James Pratt and John Smith were two London men who, in November 1835, became the last two to be executed for sodomy in England. Modern interpretation cast doubt on the facts and legality of the conviction. In January 2017, Pratt and Smith were among those who were posthumously pardoned by the Alan Turing law which pardoned those who had been convicted of criminalised homosexuality offences which no longer exist in the UK.[129][130] 1876 William Habron Murder London Life imprisonment 3 years Yes Convicted of the fatal shooting of Constable Nicholas Cock during a burglary. The jury at his trial recommended mercy and so he avoided the death penalty, which was usually mandatory for murder. Another man, Charles Peace, eventually confessed to the crime to exonerate Habron,[131] who was pardoned and awarded compensation. 1895 Adolf Beck Ten misdemeanours and four felonies London 7 years in prison 6 years Yes Wrongfully convicted on the basis of mistaken eyewitness testimony, unreliable methods of conviction and a rush to convict by the police. His case led to the creation of the English Court of Criminal Appeal. 1908 Oscar Slater Murder Glasgow Death 19 years Yes Oscar Slater was wrongfully convicted in 1909 of the murder of Marion Gilchrist on the flimsiest evidence, and sentenced to death. His sentence was commuted to life imprisonment, and he served at hard labour until his conviction was quashed in 1928.[132] 1931 William Herbert Wallace Murder Liverpool Death Yes William Herbert Wallace was convicted of murdering his wife, but the conviction was overturned by the Court of Criminal Appeal in 1931, the first such instance of a capital conviction being quashed. 1949 Timothy Evans Murder London Death Executed Partial[133] Evans's wife and young daughter were found strangled in 1949. Evans initially made a statement confessing to the murders while in police custody, but later withdrew it, citing the shock of discovering that his daughter had been killed and his fear of police as reasons for his false confession. In 1950, Evans was convicted and hanged for the murder of his daughter, largely on the basis of his original confession. His conviction was also assisted by evidence provided by his neighbour, John Christie, whom Evans had accused of being the murderer after withdrawing his own confession. Christie was later found to be a serial killer who had murdered at least six women at the same property where Evans's wife and daughter had been killed. An official inquiry conducted 15 years after Evans's hanging concluded that Christie had been responsible for the death of Evans's daughter, allowing the Home Secretary, Roy Jenkins, to apply for a royal pardon of Evans's conviction in October 1966. The case was important in leading to the abolition of capital punishment in the UK in 1965. On 19 November 2004, the Court of Appeal said that the cost and resources of quashing the conviction could not be justified, although the judges did accept that Evans had not murdered either his wife or his child. 1949 George Kelly Double murder Liverpool Death Executed Yes, posthumously George Kelly was executed in 1950 for the 1949 murder of the manager (and his assistant) of the Cameo Cinema in Liverpool, during a robbery gone wrong. The case became known as the Cameo murder. Kelly's conviction was overturned in 2003. Another man, Donald Johnson, had confessed to the crime but the police bungled Johnson's case and had not divulged his confession at Kelly's trial.[134] 1952 Mahmood Hussein Mattan Murder of a woman Cardiff Death Executed Yes, posthumously Mahmood Mattan, a Somali fisherman, was arrested and convicted of the murder of 42-year-old Lily Volpert, despite the police bungling the investigation. Mattan was hanged in Cardiff in 1952. His conviction was overturned in 1998. £1.4 million compensation was shared out between Mattan's widow Laura, and her three children. 1952 Derek Bentley Murder of a policeman Croydon Death Executed Yes, posthumously Bentley, a mentally handicapped young man, and his accomplice Christopher Craig, attempted a burglary. The police found them and a policeman was killed by a shot from Craig's revolver. Craig was under 18 and could not be executed; however, Bentley was executed. In 1998, the Court of Appeal quashed Bentley's conviction for murder.[135] 1972 Andrew Evans Murder of a girl Tamworth Life 25 years Yes, 1997 (compensation granted) Andrew Evans confessed to the 1972 murder of 14-year-old Judith Roberts after seeing the girl's face in a dream. He was convicted and served more than 25 years. His conviction was overturned in 1997. 1972 Liam Holden Murder Belfast Death, commuted to life imprisonment 17 years Yes, 2012 Liam Holden was convicted of murdering a British soldier in Northern Ireland in 1973 during The Troubles. Holden later claimed to have been forced to sign a confession by soldiers who tortured and threatened to shoot him. He became the last person ever sentenced to death by a British court (while the death penalty had been abolished in Great Britain in 1965, it was retained in Northern Ireland until July 1973). After the death penalty was abolished in Northern Ireland, Holden's death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. He was released on license in 1989. In 2012, an appeals court overturned his conviction.[136][137] The Oval Four—Winston Trew, Sterling Christie, George Griffiths and Constantine Boucher—were arrested by undercover police led by DS Derek Ridgewell at Oval tube station in March 1972. They later claimed to have been beaten up in custody, but were tried and found guilty. Subsequently, a number of Ridgewell's cases were discovered to be unsound and overturned, while Ridgewell himself eventually died in prison having been convicted of stealing mail bags. In 2019 the four men's case was returned to the Appeal Court, who overturned their convictions after 47 years.[138] 1973 Stephen Downing Murder of a girl Bakewell Indefinite 27 years Yes, 2002 Downing was convicted of the murder of Wendy Sewell in a Bakewell churchyard where he worked in 1973. He was found with blood on his hands and clothing and had been using the murder weapon, a pickaxe handle, to break up firewood.[139] He verbally confessed and then willingly signed a confession, with his accompanying parents agreeing he did not need to see a solicitor.[140] After he found out that Sewell had died of her injuries, he retracted the confession, but still admitted at trial that he had sexually assaulted her as she lay dying.[141] He was a virgin and had never had a girlfriend.[140] He was convicted by unanimous jury decision and this decision was upheld on appeal. In 2002 it was heard that the confession evidence could make the conviction unsafe, and he was released after 27 years. A reinvestigation found that only Downing could have been responsible, with all other suspects suggested by Don Hale, the journalist who led the \"Bakewell Tart\" campaign to free him, being eliminated from inquiries, indicating he likely was guilty after all.[142][143] New forensic evidence also indicated he was responsible.[144] Downing himself refused to be re-interviewed, having reportedly confessed to the murder several times after being released, including on one occasion when he was recorded doing so.[140][145] Hale's book was criticised for falsehoods and Downing was arrested in 2004 for allegedly intimidating a witness only days before a BBC programme was due to be shown which suggested he was guilty.[146] Police applied to re-try Downing following reform of the double jeopardy law in 2005, but as of 2022 he has not been retried.[143] Stephen Downing remains the prime and only suspect in the Sewell case, which was one of the longest miscarriages of justice cases in British legal history. 1974 Judith Ward Planting time bomb Yorkshire Life 18 years Yes, 1992 (compensation granted) In November 1974 Judith Ward was wrongfully convicted of the February M62 coach bombing, which killed 12 people (9 soldiers & 3 civilians) and injuring 38. She was also convicted of a handful of smaller bombings (which resulted in no fatalities). 1974 Birmingham Six Planting two bombs Birmingham Life 17 years Yes, 1991 (compensation granted) The Birmingham Six were convicted in 1975 of planting two bombs in pubs in Birmingham in 1974 that killed 21 people and injured 182. They were finally released in 1991. 1974 Jessie McTavish Murder of a patient with insulin and grievous bodily harm Glasgow Life imprisonment 4 months Yes*,[b] 1975 (no compensation) Scottish nurse who was convicted in 1974 of the murder of a patient with insulin after being inspired by the plot of A Man Called Ironside. She was released on appeal in 1975, despite three appeal court judges saying there was ample evidence to support the conviction, as the trial judge had inadvertently misled the jury in his final summary.[147] The appeal court judges said that it was an omission that \"a few words could have cured\".[147] Apart from the case prosecuted, another 23 cases were deemed suspicious by investigators.[148] Although acquitted, McTavish's case often is mentioned in lectures at medical colleges in Britain, and is cited in textbooks and academic papers about forensic science and medical malpractice.[149][150][151] McTavish, now known as Jessie Gordon, is believed to have been the inspiration for serial killer nurse Colin Norris.[147] October and November 1974 and 1975 Guildford Four and Maguire Seven Planting bombs, making bombs Guilford and Woolwich Murder and other charges Guildford Four: 15 years; Maguire Seven: 14 years, 11 years, 4 years & 3 years, respectively Yes, 1989 & 1991 (compensation granted) The Guildford Four and Maguire Seven were wrongly convicted in 1974 and 1976, respectively, of planting bombs in various pubs in Guildford and Woolwich. Their convictions were quashed in 1989 and 1991. On February 9, 2005, British Prime Minister Tony Blair issued a public apology to the Maguire Seven and the Guildford Four for the \"miscarriages of justice they had suffered\". 1974–1978 Terry Pinfold and Harry MacKenney Contract killings London Life 23 years Yes, 2003 (compensation granted) Two Essex businessmen and former prisoners, Pinfold and MacKenney, were convicted of murder at the Old Bailey in 1980 after John Childs confessed in 1979 to six contract killings from 1974 to 1978 and implicated the pair, his former employers, in the crimes. The bodies were never found, but MacKenney received a whole life tariff.[152] Pinfold was released on bail in 2001 and after a referral by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, both Pinfold and MacKenney had their convictions overturned at the Court of Appeal in 2003. A forensic psychiatrist, David Somekh, concluded that Childs had a personality disorder that led him to compulsively lie, and the original trial jury were blocked from being told this.[152] Pinfold's lawyer said that former Detective Chief Inspector James Harrison-Griffiths was told in 1976 by Commander Bert Wickstead of the Metropolitan Police that the apparent first victim, Terry Eve—by then a missing person—was alive and living in west London.[152][153] Lord Woolf, with Mr Justice Aikens and Mr Justice Davis, ruled that Childs' evidence against the pair was unreliable because he was a \"pathological liar\".[154] 1975 Stefan Kiszko Rape and murder of a girl Rishworth Moor, West Yorkshire Life 16 years Yes, 1992 (compensation granted) Stefan Kiszko was convicted in 1976 for the rape and murder of 11-year-old Lesley Molseed the previous year. He spent 16 years in prison before he was released in 1992, after a long campaign by his mother. He died of a heart attack the following year at the age of 41. His mother died a few months later. In 2007, Ronald Castree, of Shaw, near Oldham, was arrested on DNA evidence, was convicted of Molseed's murder at Bradford Crown Court and jailed for life. 1977 Robert Brown Murder of a woman Hulme, Manchester Life 25 years Yes, 2002 (compensation granted) Brown was convicted in 1977 of the murder of 51-year-old Annie Walsh at her flat in Hulme, Greater Manchester. Despite numerous appeals, Brown's conviction was only declared 'unsafe' in 2002, when three appeal court judges heard how his confession was beaten out of him, the forensic evidence pointed to someone else and a report into police corruption (that led to Brown's interrogating officer being jailed for four years) was suppressed until days before his 2002 appeal. Brown was eligible for parole in 1992, but he refused to admit to a crime that he did not commit and so prolonged his sentence. Brown stated that clearing his name was more important than his freedom.[155] 1977 Anthony Steel Murder of a woman Bradford Life 20 years Yes, 2003 (compensation granted) Steel was convicted of the murder of Carol Wilkinson, who was hit over the head and had her skull fractured in Bradford, West Yorkshire, on 10 October 1977. The murder was initially investigated as a possible \"Yorkshire Ripper\" attack, as this killer (real name Peter Sutcliffe) was in the midst of a 5-year killing spree carried out between 1975 and 1980 across Bradford, Leeds and other nearby towns and cities. However, detectives theorised that Wilkinson's murder was not linked to Sutcliffe. Steel was convicted based on a confession he made after intense questioning because he was told that he would be allowed to see a solicitor if he confessed. Even though his confession failed to include any details of the murder, and Ripper detective Jim Hobson testified at trial that he did not believe the confession, he was narrowly convicted. The conviction was quashed in 2003 after it was heard that Steel was mentally handicapped and a vulnerable interviewee. He received £100,000 in compensation but died shortly afterwards. Since his acquittal, several investigators have stated that Sutcliffe was the likely perpetrator, indicated by the fact that Sutcliffe knew Wilkinson, had argued with her father over his advances towards her, and had earlier that day mutilated one of his confirmed victims nearby. Sutcliffe did not confess to the murder at his trial in 1981, but by this time Steel was already serving time for the murder.[156][157] 1978 Paul Blackburn Attempted murder Chester Life imprisonment 25 years Yes, 2005 (compensation granted) Paul Blackburn was convicted in 1978 when aged 15 of the attempted murder of a nine-year-old boy, and spent more than 25 years in 18 different prisons, during which time he maintained his innocence. He said he had never considered saying he was guilty to secure an earlier release because it was a matter of \"integrity\". He was finally released in May 2005 having served 25 years when the Court of Appeal ruled his trial was unfair and his conviction 'unsafe'. 1978 Bridgewater Four Murder of a boy Stourbridge Life and 12 years (Malloy) 18 years Yes, 1997 The Bridgewater Four were convicted in 1979 of murdering Carl Bridgewater, a 13-year-old paper boy who was shot on his round when he disturbed robbers at a farm in Staffordshire. Patrick Molloy died in jail in 1981. The remaining three were released in 1997 after their convictions were overturned. 1979 Sean Hodgson Murder Southampton Life imprisonment 27 years Yes, 2009 (compensation granted) Sean Hodgson, also known as Robert Graham Hodgson, was convicted in 1982 of the 1979 murder of Teresa De Simone following various confessions to police, although he pleaded not guilty at his trial. His defence said he was a pathological liar and the confessions were untrue. After 27 years in jail, he was released on March 18, 2009, by the Court of Appeal as a result of advances in DNA analysis that established his innocence.[158] Later in 2009, it was revealed that a deceased man, David Lace (who committed suicide in 1988), was the likely killer of De Simone, with the dead man's DNA matching the killer's.[159] 1984 Thomas Campbell and Joseph Steele Arson and murder East Glasgow Life imprisonment 20 years Yes, 2004 (compensation granted) On 16 April 1984, a fire at a flat in Ruchazie, a housing estate in Glasgow, led to the deaths of 18-year old Arthur \"Fat Boy\" Doyle, and 4 of his family members, 2 of them being minors. Thomas \"TC\" Campbell and Joseph Steele were convicted, despite one of the two eyewitnesses (Joseph Granger) stating in court that his testimony was fabricated. Eight years later, the other eyewitness, William Love admitted to having lied to the trial, having been accused previously of perverting the course of justice three times. Evidence also came out that the two men had been subject to police abuse, Campbell having accused the police of \"fitting him up\". Steele and Campbell both staged protest actions, Steele having once glued himself to the gates of the Buckingham Palace and Campbell having gone on hunger strike. Both men first appealed their convictions in 1989 but only in 2004, the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh overturned their convictions. In 2019, Thomas Campbell died at his home. 1985 Colin Campbell Murder West London Life imprisonment N/A[c] No[d] (no compensation) Double-killer Campbell was (almost certainly correctly[160]) convicted of murder after abducting 29-year-old Deirdre Sainsbury on the South Circular Road at Roehampton in 1984 before killing her after she rejected his sexual advances and dumping her body naked on Denham Golf Course. A man made note of the number plate of the car, and after police found the car belonged to Campbell they searched his house, finding the murdered woman's missing clothes inside. Although he admitted killing Sainsbury, he claimed he had only done so as he had an epileptic fit. The jury at his trial did not believe the idea that an epileptic fit could explain such a brutal and sexually motivated murder and found him guilty of murder. However, his murder conviction was dubiously quashed in 1996 after his defence employed experts who claimed that epilepsy could explain the murder. At a retrial he pled guilty to the alternative charge of manslaughter and this plea was accepted by the Crown. Although officially a 'miscarriage of justice' case since his murder conviction was quashed, it materialised in 2013 that Campbell had already abducted and murdered a woman in west London three years earlier, with DNA proving he was responsible for the high-profile murder of Claire Woolterton in 1981 and thus discrediting the idea that he had killed Sainsbury due to epilepsy. At his trial for this murder in 2013 the experts who had testified at his 1996 appeal that he could have killed Sainsbury due to epilepsy refused to do so again, saying \"the fact that he had committed two similar crimes would significantly weaken the possibility that the factors that we determined about his epilepsy at Broadmoor Hospital could have played the central role that was suggested in the case of the Deirdre Sainsbury killing. If it is found that he was present and did carry out the earlier killing then this must raise questions about the significance of epilepsy in the second killing\". The judge said in his sentencing remarks that he should never have had his murder conviction in Sainsbury's case downgraded, commenting: \"Had it been known in 1999 that you were responsible as well for the killing of Claire Woolterton, the prosecution would never have accepted your plea of diminished responsibility in relation to the killing of Deirdre Sainsbury. It is also unlikely that Dr Fenwick and Professor Fenton (the epilepsy experts) would have been able to support such a defence\".[161][162][163][164][165][160] 1985 Winston Silcott Murder London Imprisonment 6 years Yes, 1991 (compensation granted) Winston Silcott was convicted (he was already serving 18 years for the murder of Tony Smith) for the murder of PC Keith Blakelock during the 1985 Broadwater Farm riot in Tottenham. He was cleared in 1991, when new evidence came to light. 1986 Michael Shirley Rape and murder of Linda Cook Portsmouth Life imprisonment 16 years Yes, 2003 Michael Shirley, a Royal Navy seaman, was convicted of the rape and murder of a 24-year-old barmaid in Portsmouth, Hampshire, in 1986. After completing the recommended minimum 15 years of his life sentence he maintained his innocence even though this meant he would not be released on parole. In 2002 the case was referred by the Criminal Cases Review Commission to the Court of Appeal, where the conviction was quashed on the basis of fresh DNA evidence.[166] 1986 Danny McNamee Conspiracy to bomb Crossmaglen 25 years 12 years Yes, 1998 Conviction overturned because of other, much more prominent, fingerprints on the bomb circuit boards. 1986 Ernest Barrie Robbery Blantyre, South Lanarkshire 18 years 3 years Yes, 1989 Barrie had been convicted of robbing £40,000 from the Clydesdale Bank in Blantyre, South Lanarkshire in 1986, but his conviction was overturned in 1989 after a Rough Justice programme claimed that the robber caught on CCTV may not have been Barrie. However, in 2009 he was convicted of brutally murdering his neighbour, having inflicted 47 separate injuries with a knife, a toilet cistern lid, a walking stick and a metal pole over 15 minutes, causing him to bleed to death. He pled guilty to the killing and psychiatrists agreed that he had a psychotic illness. In 1998 his release on appeal had been celebrated in an article of the Sunday Mail, in which it was said that his son had since apparently randomly fallen into the River Clyde 300 yards (274 meters) from the family home and died, with the Rough Justice team sending him flowers and a card.[167][168] 1987 Cardiff Newsagent Three (Michael O'Brien, Darren Hall and Ellis Sherwood) Murder Cardiff Life 11 years Yes, 1999 (granted compensation) The trio were wrongly convicted for the murder of newsagent, Phillip Saunders, who was battered with a spade outside his Cardiff home. The day's takings from his kiosk had been stolen, and five days later he died of his injuries. The Court of Appeal quashed their convictions in 1999. The three have since been paid six figure compensation, but South Wales Police had still not apologised or admitted liability for malicious prosecution. 1988 Cardiff Three (Steven Miller, Yusef Abdullahi, and Tony Paris) Murder Cardiff Life imprisonment 2 years Yes, 1992 (granted compensation) The Cardiff Three were falsely jailed in 1990 for the murder of prostitute Lynette White in Cardiff in 1988 and later cleared on appeal due to DNA evidence. In 2003, Jeffrey Gafoor was jailed for life for the murder. Subsequently, in 2005, twelve police officers were arrested and questioned for false imprisonment, conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and misconduct. In 2011, eight of the officers stood trial at Swansea Crown Court for perverting the course of justice together with three witnesses accused of perjury. However, the case collapsed, as the judge ruled the officers could not be given a fair trial due to the previous publicity.[169] 1988 Eddie Browning Murder M50 motorway Life imprisonment 5 and a half years Yes, 1994 (awarded damages) Browing was convicted of the murder of pregnant Marie Wilks, a 22-year-old woman who had broken down on the side of the M50 motorway. Browning was arrested after his friends reported that he matched the photofit of the suspect, and it was discovered that on the day Browning had had a row with his pregnant wife and stormed off telling her he was driving to Scotland. He would have used the M50 to drive in that direction. Browning owned a silver Renault 25 car similar to one seen at the scene, and a 20-foot tyre mark near the embankment where the body was found was linked to a bald tyre on Browning's car that may have made that type of mark. He was released on appeal in 1994 after it was found that the police had failed to disclose a video of a witness under hypnosis. Reacting, the head of West Mercia Police said: \"All I would say is that I was completely satisfied with the investigation\". Reinvestigations have found no other evidence or suspect and Browning died aged 63 in 2018. His death was not considered suspicious.[170][171][172] 1988 M25 Three Murder and robbery London Life 10 years Yes*,[e] 2000 Convictions ruled unsafe after an appeal to the European Court of Justice. A large number of items stolen in the robberies had been found in the possession of the men at the time, and the girlfriend of Raphael Rowe (one of the three) handed police a number of items Rowe had given her, which were all found to have been stolen in the robberies. Prints from Rowe's shoes were also found at one of the scenes and the girlfriend testified that Rowe had left that night and only returned in the morning wearing different jeans and shoes and carrying a Sainsbury's bag – which was the same type of which had been taken in one of the robberies. Members of the gang also admitted having stolen the car that was used in the murder only days before. Although they were reluctantly released by the Court of Appeal judges, they insisted that they were not declaring the men innocent, stating: \"The case against all three appellants was formidable. The evidence against Rowe was overwhelming... For the better understanding of those who have listened to this judgment and of those who may report it hereafter this is not a finding of innocence, far from it.\"[173] 1991 Christy Walsh Possessing explosives Belfast Imprisonment 14 years Yes, 2010 (no compensation) Conviction overturned as unsafe (procedural irregularities might have amounted to an interference with his right to a fair trial) on a third appeal. Walsh was refused compensation. 1991 Michelle and Lisa Taylor Murder of Alison Shaughnessy London Life 1 year Yes, 1993 (no compensation) 21 and 19 respectively, the sisters were convicted of the murder of Alison Shaughnessy by unanimous jury decision at the Old Bailey in 1992. The press and media had taken a great interest in the case as it materialised that the murder of the newly married woman in her flat occurred at the time when a love triangle had emerged involving the victim, her husband and his secret mistress Michelle. Two women were seen running from the scene, and fresh fingerprints implicated the sisters, who claimed to have never been to the flat. Evidence was also discovered that indicated Michelle wished to eliminate Shaughnessy as a rival to the love of the victim's husband, such as a diary entry that read \"my dream solution would be for Alison to disappear, as if she never existed\". They had their convictions overturned in controversial circumstances one year later on technical grounds and because it was judged that the sensationalist media coverage may have influenced jurors. Reinvestigations of the case did not identify any other suspects, and in 2002 it was decided to no longer formally investigate the case. Bernard O'Mahoney, a man who had originally campaigned for the release of the Taylors and who then had an affair with Michelle, has since claimed that she confessed to the murder to him and has campaigned for the sisters to be re-convicted.[174][175] They were not awarded compensation, becoming the first victims of a miscarriage of justice in the UK to have been denied any.[176] 1993 Lee Clegg Murder, attempted wounding* Belfast Life 2 years Yes, 2000 (no compensation) Clegg was a British Army sergeant stationed in Belfast during The Troubles. On 30 September 1990 Karen Reilly and Martin Peake were fatally shot while driving a stolen car at speed through a checkpoint manned by Clegg and others, having ignored instructions to stop the car. Clegg was convicted of murdering Reilly and attempting to wound Peake due to evidence that the shots that killed them had been fired after the car had passed and was no longer a threat to the soldiers.[177] Clegg's murder conviction was overturned by an appeal court in 1999 when new evidence showed that the shot that killed Reilly had in fact been fired as the car passed through the checkpoint, meaning that the vehicle could still have been a threat at that point.[177] A later appeal also overturned the wounding conviction when witness testimony that Clegg had shot Peake after the car had passed was discredited.[178] 1995 Jonathan Jones Murders of Harry and Megan Tooze Llanharry Life 1 year Yes, 1996 (no compensation) Jones was convicted of the shotgun murders of his girlfriend's parents, which were committed at their remote farmhouse in Llanharry on 26 July 1993. Inside the farmhouse the best china had been placed on the table, as if the couple were expecting a close guest. Jones' fingerprint was found on a teacup which was only ever used when there was an important visitor, despite him saying he had never used it. It was discovered that no witnesses supported his 'alibi' that he had spent the day visiting estate agents in Orpington, with no estate agents in the area saying they remembered seeing or speaking to him. Police also discovered that he and his girlfriend were in financial difficulty, and that Harry and Megan had a £150,000 life insurance policy that was paid to the girlfriend (the victim's daughter), indicating that this was a motive for the murders. Although the consensus was that he could not be found guilty on this evidence, the jury at his trial were convinced and found him guilty after only two hours of deliberation. He was, however, released on appeal a year later after a campaign by the girlfriend. To this day no-one has ever come forward to confirm Jones' alibi and there remains no proof of what he was doing that day. He has been denied compensation as there is no evidence that proves he was innocent, and subsequent attempts to solve the murders have failed to unearth any new suspects.[179] 1996 Sally Clark Murder of her two sons Devizes Life 4 years Yes, 2003 Sally Clark was convicted in 1996 of the murder of her two small sons Christopher and Harry, and spent three years in jail, finally being released in 2003 on appeal. The convictions were based solely on the analysis of the deaths by the Home Office Pathologist Alan Williams, who failed to disclose relevant information about the deaths, that was backed up by the paediatric professor Sir Roy Meadow, whose opinion was pivotal in several other child death convictions, many of which have been overturned or are in the process of being disputed. In 2005 Williams was found guilty of serious professional misconduct and barred from practising pathology for three years. In July 2005 Meadow was removed from the Medical Register for serious professional misconduct and prohibited from practising medicine. Clark became an alcoholic as a result of her ordeal and died of alcohol poisoning in 2007. 1996 Donna Anthony Murder of two babies Somerset Life 6 years Yes, 2005 Anthony was wrongly jailed in 1998 for the death of her 11-month-old son, also because of the opinion of Sir Roy Meadow, and finally released in 2005. 1996 Victor Nealon Rape Redditch Discretionary life sentence 17 years Yes, 2013 (no compensation) Conviction quashed after an unknown person's DNA was found on the woman's clothes. Nealon was denied compensation. 1997 Siôn Jenkins Murder Hastings, East Sussex Life imprisonment 6 years Yes*,[f] 2006 (no compensation) Siôn Jenkins was acquitted in February 2006 after a second retrial of the 1997 murder of his foster daughter Billie-Jo Jenkins. He was convicted in 1998 but the conviction was quashed in 2004 following a CCRC referral. The basis of the quashed conviction at the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) were the concessions by the Crown's pathologist that evidence given at the first tribunal were inaccurate. Jenkins has been denied compensation on the grounds that there is no evidence that proves his innocence.[180] 1999 Angela Cannings Murder of two babies Salisbury, Wiltshire Life 2 years Yes, 2003 Angela Cannings was jailed wrongly for four years on the now discredited evidence of Sir Roy Meadow. 1999 John Corcoran Murder of Helen Gorrie Horndean, Hampshire Life 3 years Yes, 2003 21-year-old Corcoran was jailed for the 1992 murder of 15-year-old Helen Gorrie. She had left her house one night to meet up with Corcoran, who she had only met the night before when he was cruising around the area in his car. She was found half-naked and strangled but not sexually assaulted at a spot popular with courting couples 10 minutes from her home, and police believed Corcoran had killed her after she rebuffed his sexual advances. He could not account for his movements for 40 minutes that night, when he had left his friends saying he had to meet someone. He was released on a technicality in January 2003 and moved back to Warren Park in Havant, but police revealed that there were no grounds to re-open the murder investigation. Officially, Gorrie's murder remains unsolved.[181][182] 1999 to 2015 Sub-postmasters operating the Horizon computer system Theft, false accounting and fraud Around the UK Various, usually fines and imprisonment lasting up to 12 years Varies Yes In 1999 the UK Post Office introduced a computer accounting system named Horizon. By 2013 the system was being used by at least 11,500 branches, and was processing some six million transactions every day.[183][184] From 1999 onwards unexplained discrepancies and losses began to be reported by sub-postmasters. The Post Office maintained that Horizon was \"robust\" and that none of the shortfalls or discrepancies in sub-postmasters' branch accounts were due to problems caused by Horizon.[185] Sub-postmasters unwilling or unable to make good the shortfalls were sometimes prosecuted (by the Post Office's in-house prosecution team) for theft, false accounting and/or fraud. Between 1991 and 2015 there were 918 successful prosecutions.[186][187] These were largely private prosecutions by the Post Office relying on IT evidence alone, without proof of criminal intent. Public prosecutions also occurred in Scotland, Northern Ireland and in Crown Courts. Despite this, some sub-postmasters were successfully persuaded by their own solicitors to plead guilty to false accounting, on being told the Post Office would drop theft charges. Once the Post Office had a criminal conviction, it would attempt to secure a Proceeds of Crime Act Order against convicted sub-postmasters, allowing it to seize their assets and bankrupt them.[188] According to press reports, these actions by the Post Office caused the loss of dozens of jobs, bankruptcy, divorce, unwarranted prison sentences and one documented suicide.[189][190] 1999 Barry George Murder of Jill Dando London Life imprisonment 7 years Yes, 2008 Barry George was arrested and charged in 2000 over the 1999 murder of TV presenter Jill Dando. He was sentenced in 2001, but had his conviction quashed in 2007 and was fully exonerated in 2008 after a retrial in which police were unable to rely on discredited forensic evidence. 2003 Andrew Malkinson Rape Salford, Manchester Life imprisonment 17 years (Released in 2020) Yes, 2023 Andrew Malkinson was convicted of rape in 2004. Initially sentenced to a minimum term of 6½ years, his insistence on being innocent saw him continue to be jailed until 2020 when he was released for good behaviour. He would make multiple appeals, with his conviction finally being quashed in 2023 on the basis of re-examined DNA samples. 2004 Sam Hallam Murder London Minimum of 12 years' imprisonment 7 years Yes, 2012 (no compensation) Sam Hallam was wrongly jailed for life in 2005 for the murder of Essayas Kassahun. He was released in May 2012 after prosecutors told three senior judges that they would not oppose his appeal.[191] 2011 Ched Evans Rape Rhyl 5 years 2 years 6 months Yes, 2016 Evans, a professional footballer, was convicted in 2012 of the rape of a woman. In 2015 the Criminal Cases Review Commission referred the case to the Court of Appeal, having examined new evidence from two of the complainant's previous sexual partners about her behaviour, which bore similarities to Evans's account that the Commission decided \"could not reasonably be explained as a coincidence\". In 2016 the Court of Appeal quashed the conviction and ordered a retrial, at which Evans was found not guilty. 2012 Shirley and Lynette Banfield Murder Harrow, London Life imprisonment 1 year Yes*,[g] 2013"
