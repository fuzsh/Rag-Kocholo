        "text": "A legal chal­lenge filed last month by two promi­nent Repub­li­can par­ty offi­cials that shame­ful­ly sought to evade Wash­ing­ton’s new law requir­ing fis­cal trans­paren­cy in ini­tia­tive descrip­tions received a good and prop­er torch­ing today in Thurston Coun­ty Supe­ri­or Court, with Judge Allyson Zipp rul­ing from the bench that three right wing ini­tia­tives head­ed for the bal­lot would all be sub­ject to pub­lic invest­ment impact dis­clo­sures, in a big win for the pub­lic’s right to know and a big defeat for the state’s right wing.\n\nZip­p’s rul­ing upheld the applic­a­bil­i­ty of a 2022 law spon­sored by State Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Mia Gregerson (D‑33rd Dis­trict: South King Coun­ty) and cham­pi­oned by our team at NPI that is wild­ly pop­u­lar with Wash­ing­ton vot­ers of all polit­i­cal stripes. That law says that when a statewide ini­tia­tive is pro­posed that would increase state tax­es or fees — or cut them — vot­ers have to be informed with a sen­tence on the bal­lot tak­ing the fol­low­ing form: This mea­sure would (increase / decrease) fund­ing for _____.\n\nThe state has long been in the habit of pro­vid­ing infor­ma­tion about bal­lot mea­sures’ fis­cal impacts in the voter’s pam­phlet. But vot­ers have pre­vi­ous­ly not been alert­ed to the pres­ence of those analy­ses on the bal­lot itself.\n\nThat’s now set to change thanks to our fis­cal trans­paren­cy law.\n\nWash­ing­ton State Repub­li­can Par­ty Chair Jim Walsh and Main­stream Repub­li­cans Chair Dean­na Mar­tinez are pri­vate­ly wor­ried that the law will harm their chances of pass­ing a slate of destruc­tive ini­tia­tives spon­sored by Walsh and fund­ed by mul­ti­mil­lion­aire Repub­li­can donor Bri­an Hey­wood. Wal­sh’s pal Tim Eyman, who has expe­ri­ence get­ting decep­tive ini­tia­tives past vot­ers, has been warn­ing any­one in Repub­li­can cir­cles who’ll lis­ten that the trans­paren­cy law is a big prob­lem for the slate.\n\nLast month, Walsh and Mar­tinez heed­ed Eyman’s advice and tasked right wing attor­ney Joel Ard with pre­sent­ing argu­ments that they hoped would stop the Attor­ney Gen­er­al’s office from writ­ing pub­lic invest­ment impact dis­clo­sures (PIIDs) for the three initiatives:\n\nIni­tia­tive 2109 (repeals the state’s cap­i­tal gains tax on the wealthy, there­by repeal­ing bil­lions in edu­ca­tion funding)\n\nIni­tia­tive 2117 (repeals the Cli­mate Com­mit­ment Act, there­by repeal­ing bil­lions in trans­porta­tion and clean ener­gy funding)\n\n… and Ini­tia­tive 2124 (sab­o­tages the WA Cares Fund by per­mit­ting peo­ple to with­draw, there­by reduc­ing fund­ing for long-term care)\n\nArd duti­ful­ly draft­ed a com­plaint seek­ing writs of pro­hi­bi­tion and man­damus, then filed it in Thurston Coun­ty Supe­ri­or Court. Walsh and Mar­tinez began pub­li­ciz­ing the exis­tence of the law­suit sev­er­al days ago, ahead of today’s oral argu­ment before Zipp.\n\nI described the law­suit ear­li­er this week as one of the more pre­pos­ter­ous our team has ever seen, and I still feel that way about it. It was a pile of weak argu­ments from top to bot­tom. The argu­ments per­tain­ing to why I‑2109 should­n’t get a PIID were espe­cial­ly absurd — so much so that Solic­i­tor Gen­er­al Noah Pur­cell, who pre­sent­ed oral argu­ment for the state today, called them “bizarre” both in writ­ing and again verbally.\n\nArd and Pur­cell took turns sum­ma­riz­ing their briefs for Judge Zipp, who lis­tened intent­ly and some­times inter­rupt­ed with ques­tions. She then advised the par­ties, their coun­sel, and all media and mem­bers of the pub­lic present observ­ing that she would be rul­ing from the bench short­ly. She retired to cham­bers for sev­er­al min­utes, then returned and deliv­ered one of the best ver­bal rul­ings I’ve ever heard from a Wash­ing­ton State judge.\n\nIt was detailed, thought­ful, methodical.\n\nStep by step, Zipp unpacked the plain­tiffs’ argu­ments and explained why she was not per­suad­ed by them, pro­vid­ing a ratio­nale for why each mea­sure in Wal­sh’s slate should receive the pub­lic invest­ment impact dis­clo­sure that the law requires. When she was done, she asked coun­sel if they had any ques­tions. No one did: not Ard, not Pur­cell, and not the attor­neys rep­re­sent­ing the pro­posed inter­venors in the case.\n\nThe state got the com­plete vic­to­ry and the dis­missal it was hop­ing for. Walsh and Mar­tinez were left with noth­ing. Walsh tried to put a pos­i­tive spin on his defeat out­side the court­room in a video for his PCOs, donors, and fol­low­ers, sug­gest­ing he and Mar­tinez might appeal and argu­ing that Judge Zip­p’s rul­ing had a “sil­ver lin­ing” — specif­i­cal­ly, that Zipp had held that each ini­tia­tive on the slate would repeal a tax or a fee.\n\nOf course, OFM (the Office of Finan­cial Man­age­ment) and the AGO (Attor­ney Gen­er­al’s Office) had already made such deter­mi­na­tions, as the state point­ed out in its brief. But Walsh evi­dent­ly felt he need­ed to put some­thing in his glass for it to be half full.\n\nRidicu­lous­ly, he then tried to argue that he and Mar­tinez weren’t try­ing to hide infor­ma­tion from vot­ers. He made sim­i­lar com­ments to The Asso­ci­at­ed Press:\n\n“We don’t mind the idea of more infor­ma­tion, said Walsh, chair of the state Repub­li­can Par­ty and a state rep­re­sen­ta­tive from Aberdeen. ”What we’re con­cerned about is it won’t be impar­tial infor­ma­tion. It will be par­ti­san rhetoric, weaponized to make the ini­tia­tives sound bad. The fight isn’t over. We are going to con­tin­ue to make the point that we want unbi­ased non-polit­i­cal information.”\n\nFalse! Walsh is lying here — plain and simple.\n\nIf you read his and Mar­tinez’s law­suit, as I did, you can plain­ly see that they very much do mind the idea of more infor­ma­tion. The whole point of their law­suit was to get that addi­tion­al infor­ma­tion scrubbed from the bal­lot and hid­den away from vot­ers. They want­ed a judge to order our statewide elect­ed offi­cials — Attor­ney Gen­er­al Fer­gu­son and Sec­re­tary of State Hobbs — to dis­re­gard the law! Here’s their prayer for relief:\n\nWHEREFORE, Plain­tiffs pray for relief as follows:\n\nIssuance of a Writ of Man­date com­pelling the Direc­tor of the Office of Finan­cial Man­age­ment to pre­pare a revised fis­cal impact state­ment as to I‑2109 which cor­rect­ly states that the enatc­ment of I‑2109 will cause no change to state revenue;\n\nIssuance of a Writ of Pro­hi­bi­tion pro­hibit­ing the Attor­ney Gen­er­al and Sec­re­tary of State from prepar­ing, cer­ti­fy­ing, or caus­ing to be print­ed any pub­lic invest­ment dis­clo­sure state­ment as to any of I‑2117, I‑2124, and I‑2109;\n\nIssuance of a Writ of Man­date com­pelling the Sec­re­tary of State to instruct every coun­ty audi­tor or oth­er coun­ty elec­tion offi­cial to print bal­lots with­out any pub­lic invest­ment dis­clo­sure state­ment as to any of I‑2117, I‑2124, and I‑2109, and\n\nSuch oth­er relief as the Court deems just and appropriate.\n\nYou can see that nowhere in there did the plain­tiffs ask the judi­cia­ry’s help to get more favor­able lan­guage. Their aim was to get rid of the PIIDs alto­geth­er.\n\nIf Walsh were being hon­est, he would have said some­thing like this:\n\nAfter we start­ed pro­mot­ing our law­suit ear­li­er this week that seeks to trash the forth­com­ing warn­ing labels that Bob Fer­gu­son’s office is prepar­ing to add to our ini­tia­tives, we real­ized that we had giv­en our oppo­nents a gift. We basi­cal­ly admit­ted to every­one in Wash­ing­ton that we want to con­ceal infor­ma­tion from vot­ers to improve our mea­sures’ chances of pass­ing. That was a mis­take that made us look real­ly bad, so start­ing today, we’ll be piv­ot­ing to call­ing for neu­tral lan­guage in these things instead.\n\nWalsh was in the Leg­is­la­ture when HB 1876 — the bill that estab­lished pub­lic invest­ment impact dis­clo­sures — was passed. He filed amend­ments on it, and he spoke against it. He is famil­iar with it. He knows that the Attor­ney Gen­er­al’s office has until July 23rd to pre­pare the phras­ing of the dis­clo­sures. They haven’t been unveiled yet, so Walsh does­n’t know what words they’ll con­tain, apart from the ones hard­cod­ed into statute. Nev­er­the­less, he’s breath­less­ly call­ing the dis­clo­sures “par­ti­san rhetoric.”\n\nHow is a sim­ple, fac­tu­al state­ment tak­ing a form such as this “par­ti­san rhetoric”?\n\nSim­u­lat­ed PIID for Ini­tia­tive 2124 (note, not official)\n\nThis mea­sure would decrease fund­ing for long-term care.\n\nAll it does is state a very per­ti­nent fact about the mea­sure’s consequences.\n\nAn incon­ve­nient fact in Wal­sh’s eyes, no doubt. But a fact, nonetheless.\n\nWhen HB 1876 was being writ­ten, leg­is­la­tors dis­cussed a means of allow­ing the word­ing cho­sen by the AGO for the dis­clo­sures to be chal­lenged. The final ver­sion of the bill, which became law, pro­vides for such a means. If Walsh and Mar­tinez don’t like the word­ing the AGO comes up with, they can file a chal­lenge and seek judi­cial review at the appro­pri­ate junc­ture. RCW 29A.72.028 express­ly gives them that opportunity.\n\nBut again, they’re not actu­al­ly inter­est­ed in improv­ing the word­ing. They don’t want “impar­tial” infor­ma­tion (or, more strange­ly, “non-polit­i­cal” infor­ma­tion — what­ev­er that’s sup­posed to mean!) They want a loaded deck. Ide­al­ly, some lan­guage that invites a yes vote — a ques­tion akin to the sort that were in Tim Eyman’s now-abol­ished push polls that NPI got rid of. They’re not get­ting that, obvi­ous­ly, and they’re sure sore about it.\n\nYou can under­stand why. These ini­tia­tives are a mul­ti-mil­lion-dol­lar invest­ment on megadonor Bri­an Hey­wood’s part. They have Wal­sh’s name on them. They’re a big part of Wal­sh’s plans for this pres­i­den­tial elec­tion cycle. And if they go down in flames, well, that could be a very seri­ous blow to Repub­li­cans’ cred­i­bil­i­ty and morale.\n\nA defeat across the board would pro­vide evi­dence that Wash­ing­ton vot­ers like the key poli­cies that Democ­rats have been enact­ing, despite Repub­li­cans’ years-long insis­tence to the con­trary. This law­suit was a gam­bit to pre­serve that gam­bit. It did­n’t work, and now Walsh seems intent on dig­ging an even deep­er hole for him­self by con­tem­plat­ing an appeal — pre­sum­ably just for opti­cal rea­sons, to show his base he’s a fighter.\n\nHow­ev­er, if he appeals, then he’s invit­ing an appel­late deci­sion that will result in the cre­ation of case law that prob­a­bly won’t be to his lik­ing. And he’ll have to keep pay­ing Joel Ard to throw these real­ly weak argu­ments in front of the judi­cia­ry. It’s a no-win sit­u­a­tion for him. But for the peo­ple of Wash­ing­ton, this case has been illu­mi­nat­ing. It has exposed Wal­sh’s des­per­a­tion and con­tempt for the pub­lic’s right to know.\n\nHap­pi­ly, he lost today, and the vot­ers won, thanks to the good sense of Judge Zipp."
