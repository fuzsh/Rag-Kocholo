        "text": "GREEN BAY (WLUK) -- The judge presiding over the Taylor Schabusiness case will not take himself off of it, denying .\n\nSchabusiness, 25, first-degree intentional homicide, mutilating a corpse and third-degree sexual assault for allegedly attacking last year. She has pleaded not guilty and not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect.\n\nAfter she , Quinn Jolly, at a Feb. 14 hearing, Jolly left the case. Her , filed a motion this week asking Judge Thomas Walsh recuse himself from the case. Froelich argued because Walsh witnessed the attack, he could no longer be impartial while deciding if Schabusiness is competent to stand trial.\n\nCompetency refers to the defendant’s ability to understand the court proceedings and assist in their own defense. It does not relate to her mental condition at the time of the attack. The issue of her competency still hasn’t been decided – which was one of the reasons the March 6 trial date was postponed.\n\nBrown County District Attorney David Lasee said he had no concerns with Jude Walsh continuing on the case.\n\nJudge Walsh rejected the recusal motion during a hearing Friday.\n\n“I’m satisfied that I am still able to give Ms. Schabusiness a fair hearing on all of the issues in front of her, a fair hearing on the issue of competence, a fair hearing if this case goes to a jury, a fair hearing on that. And so, I’m not going to grant the motion. I believe I’m still able to be able to be impartial in this matter. Nothing really that happened at the last hearing, or any other hearing before that, really bears on that. I’m still open minded on everything that’s involved in the case,” Judge Walsh said.\n\nThe next step determining the competency issue. One report, commissioned by the state, to proceed. Another report, commissioned by the defense, yet.\n\nGiven that Froelich has been on the case for just a few days, Judge Walsh gave him time to review the reports related to competency before making a ruling on the issue. The parties will return to court March 20, when the second competency review will be discussed.\n\nNo trial date has been set. That could happen at the next hearing.\n\nAs was the case at the hearing earlier this week, two sheriff's deputies escorted Schabusiness, with one standing a step back but between her and her attorney."
