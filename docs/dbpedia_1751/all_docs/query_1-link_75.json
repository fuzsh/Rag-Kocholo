        "text": "The principle of judicial discipline pertains to the practice of taking cues, directions and passing of orders in consonance with the pre-existing judicial precedents which have already been passed in the form of judgments and orders by the Courts higher in authority. The said principle must be adopted as a matter of practice and accordingly, the subordinate Courts ought to follow the precedents in place to ensure that the effective implementation of the law laid down by way of the said precedent. In a recent case of Unison Hotel v. Value Line Interiors (2023 SCC Online Del 6930), the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi held that even obiter dictum pronouncements of the Supreme Court, though not strictly binding, should be accepted as binding by subordinate courts.

Whereas American courts follow a federal system with the Supreme Court as the highest judicial authority in the country, followed by appellate courts (circuit courts) and district courts at the federal level, as well as state courts at the state level. •Legal System: India follows a mixed legal system influenced by English common law, Hindu legal tradition, and Islamic law, with laws codified into statutes and supplemented by judicial precedents. The United States follows a common law legal system based on English common law, with statutes enacted by legislatures and case law established by judicial decisions. •Adversarial vs. Inquisitorial: Indian courts generally follow an adversarial system where parties present their cases and evidence, and judges act as impartial referees. American courts also primarily follow an adversarial system, where parties advocate for their positions, but with some elements of the inquisitorial system, especially in certain types of proceedings like administrative hearings. • Legal Precepts: Indian courts use rules and regulations that come from a variety of places, such as statutes, case law, and customary law. The Constitution, legislation, and judicial precedents are the main sources of law applied by American courts, which place a high value on the liberties and rights of the individual. • Case Handling and Postponements: Indian courts frequently have a backlog of cases, which causes delays in the settlement of legal problems. Although procedural laws and case management strategies differ by jurisdiction, American courts also struggle with a heavy workload. Nevertheless, attempts are undertaken to speed up the legal system. • Courts with Specializations:There are specialized courts in both India and the US to deal with particular case categories, like family courts, commercial courts, and administrative courts, with the goal of effectively resolving conflicts in those fields. Ultimately, although administering justice is a responsibility shared by Indian and American courts, their institutional and legal frameworks reflect the distinct legal traditions and historical processes of their respective nations. #judicialsystem #legalknowledge #uscongress #usconstitution #supremecourtofus #supremecourtofindia #lawpractice\n\nThis was Day 2 of the Nigerian Bar Association Annual General Conference 2023. On this day, a session was held to discuss what has become my best topic at the conference. We discussed the Administration of Civil Justice Bill, as enacted in a number of States. Well, we didn’t just discuss the Bill, we examined how various States have chosen to adapt the Bill and actual steps they have taken to implement their Laws. Now this is very important to me because I am a Disputes Lawyer and will probably die one. It’s also important to anyone who lives or does business in Nigeria. One major complaint we consistently echo is how slow, frustratingly slow, the Nigerian court system is. Well there is a solution within the texts of the Bill. The Bill provides for early screening of cases to root out cases better suited for ADR from the court system. It provides strict obligations for Lawyers and judges to narrow down the legal issues early on in cases, and stipulates effective case management processes, among others. It was particularly exciting to learn that States have not just copied the Bill in their enactments, but have carefully reviewed and tailored its provisions to cater to their specific needs when enacting. It was also really curious to learn that although Borno State has not enacted an Administration of Civil Justice Law, the innovations introduced in the Bill are already being practiced in courts in Borno State. I suppose this teaches that the reason our court system is slow is not necessarily because there is no legal framework targeted at speedy dispensation of justice, but because there is lack of willpower to drive speedy dispensation of justice on the part of all actors. It is refreshing to learn of initiatives like the Justice in Commerce Network who drafted the Bill, and States like Delta and Ekiti States who have enacted the Bill into their Laws, and also of Borno State who practices active case management. This gives me confidence that we will get it right, slowly maybe, but surely, litigants will revive their trust in the Nigerian justice system. Kudos to the session moderator Dr. Babatunde Ajibade, SAN and the panelists Tunde Fagbohunlu Honourable Justice Fadawu Umaru of the Borno State High Court, Isaiah Bozimo and Mr Sunday Bamidele Julius Bamishe (Honourable Solicitor General and Permanent Secretary, Ekiti State Ministry of Justice), for an excellent discussion."
