        "text": "Ryan Walsh focuses his nationwide practice on complex trial and appellate litigation and corporate counseling. Having handled matters in tribunals at every level in dozens of jurisdictions, Ryan has maintained a perfect win record in all of the cases to have resolved while he managed the litigation either for plaintiffs or defendants. His practice covers a wide variety of areas, including class actions, government regulation, commercial disputes, constitutional law, corporate governance, land use, employment, and energy.\n\nNamed to Forbes’ “30 Under 30: Law and Policy” list in 2017, Ryan has won three “best brief” accolades from the State Bar of Wisconsin, the most of any lawyer in the competition’s history. His briefing has also won awards from the National Association of Attorneys General and the International Municipal Lawyers Association.\n\nRyan previously served as Wisconsin’s Chief Deputy Solicitor General, where he ran many of the State’s highest-stakes cases in the trial and appellate courts. Before that, he worked in Washington D.C. in an elite complex-litigation practice group of an Am Law 10 firm.\n\nAfter graduating with high honors and Order of the Coif from the University of Chicago Law School, where he was editor in chief of the University of Chicago Law Review and where he now serves as a Lecturer in Law, Ryan was a law clerk on the U.S. Supreme Court for Justice Antonin Scalia and on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit for Judge Diarmuid F. O’Scannlain."
