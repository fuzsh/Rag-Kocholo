        "text": "The pivotal role of television in supporting democracy in Europe is under threat. Public service broadcasters are compromising quality to compete with commercial channels, and many of them depend on governments or political parties. Meanwhile, ever larger concentrations are developing in the commercial sector, often with clear political affiliations. These developments jeopardize broadcasting pluralism and diversity, with the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe most at risk.\n\nThese are the main findings of the monitoring report Television Across Europe: Regulation, Policy and Independence, published by the Open Society Foundations. The report covers 20 European countries—EU members, candidates, and potential candidates—from the UK to Turkey, and from Romania to France. At 1,662 pages, it is the largest-ever comparative survey of its kind. The report analyzes broadcasting across the continent and addresses policy recommendations to national and international authorities and groups.\n\nThe three-volume report and a summary are available for download."
