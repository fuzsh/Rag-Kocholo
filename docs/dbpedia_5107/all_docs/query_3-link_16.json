        "text": "Philippe Generali is the President/CEO of RCS worldwide. He joined RCS USA in 1996 as Product Manager and served as Vice President of Operations. In 2000, Philippe was promoted to President of RCS.\n\nIn 2003, he created a new division, Media Monitors, the highly successful market research company that employs RCS fingerprinting technology with several data production centers around the world. In 2007, Philippe added the duties of President/CEO of Florical Systems division, a leading television automation company. In 2010, he took the helm of Mediabase.\n\nPrior to moving to the United States, Generali was the head of RCS Europe, where he spearheaded the company’s growth for more than a decade. Generali is an established leader in computer technology and management, stemming from his early school days in radio, with a technical engineering background. He was the driving force behind the US music research index, Mscore and the listening analysis tool, Audience Reaction, for which he was recently granted several patents.\n\nHe is a member of EGTA and sits on the IRTS board. He holds a degree in Mathematics/Physics from the University of Orleans, and a Masters of Engineering from ENAC in France. Generali is an active member of the New York-based Market Research Council and is a collaborator with New York’s Flatiron School, lending his expertise in data science to their curriculum.\n\nGenerali is a regular speaker at broadcast industry events around the world. Some of the most recent include: NAB (Las Vegas), Broadcast Asia (Singapore), RadioDays Europe (Berlin), World Wide Radio Summit (Los Angeles), ARF (New York), and NextRadio (London).\n\nChip Jellison is the Chief Technology Officer leading our worldwide software development efforts across RCS, Media Monitors (Aircheck), Mediabase, Florical Systems, Test All Media and Hit Predictor. Before joining RCS, he got his start in broadcasting at Precision Media in southern New Hampshire. While with the company, he learned the broadcasting craft moving from on air positions to more back office operational tasks including light engineering, production, music and traffic scheduling and keeping the computers running at the station.\n\nIn 1998, he joined Prophet Systems and quickly joined the development team on the Audio Wizard product, taking over Product Management and coding. He also joined the NexGen Digital development team early on taking on Product Management, and eventually leading the development team. During 2006, he worked with Philippe Generali on merging Prophet Systems into RCS and assumed his current position in 2007 when that merger was complete.\n\nIn his current role of the head of Technology and Development, he works with a first class team of product managers and developers to produce the next generation of tools to help our clients grow their business.\n\nAlways the inventor, Chip is listed in over 15 issued patents and more than 20 pending patent applications. Additionally he creates utilities that help RCS clients better leverage our suite of products. These can be found on the support download page located on rcsworks.com. These utilities include AFC Launcher, Zetta Status Monitor, RCS2vCreative (an interface to vCreative for Zetta) and Zetta Cloud Interface.\n\nDavid Berry is the Chief Software Architect of RCS worldwide. He is responsible for providing architectural leadership and guiding the software development processes. Prior to joining RCS, he worked as an independent consultant where he helped his clients: launch new businesses; develop new cloud-based products; and migrate existing products to the cloud.\n\nBerry is a former CTO, most notably at Synchronoss Technologies, where he took the company from start-up to IPO in 7 years. Later he became the Chief Innovation Officer where he was responsible for expanding the company’s cloud-based product portfolio.\n\nBerry received a Master of Science in Computer Science from Drexel University, a Master of Arts in Corporate and Public Communication from Seton Hall University and a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Computer Science from Fairfield University.\n\nStaying close to radio for 20 years has connected Sven Andræ to the history of European broadcasting. Once a DJ in Sweden at Radio Ryd in Linköping, he moved to Lund to join the now legendary Radio AF/P4 as DJ and Music Director. Today, that station is noted for having produced the most radio talent and radio executives across Sweden.\n\nWith a Masters Degree in Engineering Physics from the University in Lund, Sweden, Andræ spent time in the product development department at SAAB motor company. It was through studying that firm’s proven approach to efficient product usage and streamlined processes through advanced technology that he mastered skills he would later bring to RCS.\n\nMoving back to radio in 1991 Andræ joined City Radio in Malmö, Sweden. He and his station became advanced users of Selector music scheduling and Linker promo scheduling, early RCS products. Andræ’s unique combination of radio plus mechanical and audio engineering came into play at City Radio. By 1992, Andræ was behind the drive to transform City Radio into an early adaptor of digital radio studio technology, becoming only the fifth station in the world to use RCS Master Control.\n\nWhile a consultant at SBS (Scandinavian Broadcasting System) in the mid 90s Andræ was asked to start RCS Scandinavia. He was made VP/Europe in 2001, and in 2023, promoted to Senior VP EMEA.\n\nRobin Prior is a broadcast industry veteran, involved in South Africa radio and TV broadcasting for over 30 years.\n\nBefore joining RCS in the USA, he ran his own broadcast related companies, including turnkey radio and TV station installation and systems integration companies. Prior’s company represented RCS in Africa for ten years before he moved to the USA.\n\nPrior spent six years at the RCS World Headquarters in New York where he was responsible for the Support and Installation Department as well as Product Management for RCS Master Control. During 2002 he acted as RCS’s Vice President – International where his responsibilities included all RCS activities outside the US and South America.\n\nIn 2003, Prior returned to South Africa where he became VP/Africa. Since his return he has been actively introducing Selector to new clients across South Africa and into Sudan, Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya and Uganda and bringing stations into the RCS “family.”\n\nBarry spent 17 years behind a microphone at radio stations all over the country, as well as doing stints as a TV Weatherman and Standup Comic before joining RCS in 1997. He started on the phones as a Tech Support agent and over the next 20+ years moved through the Installation, Engineering and Sales departments, coming full circle today as the Vice President of Customer Experience. Passionate about customer service, Barry spearheaded the RCS Customer Success initiative aimed at super serving our customers, as well as the bi-annual RCS product surveys which give us valuable feedback from our customers.\n\nToday he manages all of RCS Technical Support including those of RCS sister companies Media Monitors, Mediabase and Test All Media. Barry prides himself on being accessible, so if you ever have a suggestion, comment or complaint about Technical Support, you can reach him directly at Barry@RCSWorks.com"
