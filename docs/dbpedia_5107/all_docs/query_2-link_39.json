        "text": "PARIS - The Blue Devils continued competition at the 2024 Olympics on Wednesday with action in women's basketball and women's golf. Here is a recap from action on Aug. 7 in France.\n\nUSA Semifinal Bound After Besting Nigeria, 88-74\n\nThe U.S. Women's National Team punched its ticket to the semifinal round after taking down Nigeria, 88-74, in the Olympic quarterfinals. After Nigeria pulled within four early in the second (31-27), the Americans sparked a 21-6 run to push its advantage to 19 at the break, and never looked back. The strong close to the half carried over into third quarter as an 11-0 burst to open the period increased the United States' margin to 29 (62-33) and put the game out of reach. Nigeria attempted to make a comeback in the fourth period, but the deficit proved too much to overcome.\n\nChelsea Gray saw 18 minutes of action and chipped in four assists and a point for USA. Elizabeth Balogun tallied five points, two rebounds and two assists in 32 minutes of play, as Nigeria bowed out of the knockout stage.\n\nUp next, the United States squares off against Australia in the semifinals with a spot in the gold medal game on the line. Action tips off Friday, Aug. 9 at 11:30 a.m. Fans can watch the game live on NBC or stream it on Peacock.\n\nBoutier Opens Strong for France, Leads Individually at 7-under\n\nCeline Boutier, a 2016 Duke graduate, opened Olympic golf action Wednesday with an impressive 7-under-par, 65, for France and holds a 3-stroke lead with 54 holes remaining at Le Golf National in Paris.\n\nPlaying in her home country, Boutier registered eight birdies, including three-straight on holes 14-16 to help boost her round. Boutier, in her second appearance at the Olympics, posted three birdies on the front nine, including three over a span of four holes and five on the back nine. She leads the field by three strokes over Ashleigh Buhai (68).\n\nMaking her Olympic debut for Slovenia, 2020 Blue Devil graduate Ana Belac carded a 5-over, 77, and is tied for 46th overall. In her third appearance with Ireland, 2018 Duke graduate Leona Maguire posted a 6-over, 78, and is tied for 50th. Both Belac and Maguire had solid rounds, but suffered a triple-bogey on a par-5 to drop their score."
