        "text": "Radio\n\nIn terms of economics and business the radio broadcasting landscape can be defined through two variables: the nature of ownership (state-owned, commercial and community) and the scope of audience (national vs. regional/local).\n\nThe consumption of radio stations remains high. According to Médiamétrie, between November and December 2017, 79.4 percent of teenagers and adults in France have been listening to at least one radio station each week-day: 68.9 percent of this audience goes to commercial stations, 26.3 percent goes to state-owned stations, 1.5 percent goes to community stations and 3.3 percent goes to others (foreigner and other type of radio stations). Regarding the nature of programs during the week-day, 41.9 percent of the audience goes to general programs (news and entertainment), 31.5 percent to music radios, 14 percent to local programs, and 9.3 percent to thematic programs (cultural programs, breaking news, classical music). On average French teenagers and adults listen to radio 2h52 a week-day and most of them listen more than one radio station a day according to the daytime.\n\nAt a national level two private radio broadcasters historically compete to reach the best audience: NRJ and RTL. Launched in 1981, NRJ (NRJ group) is the leading music radio station for young people (teenagers and young adults) and the most listened radio station (10.5 percent of audience cumulée (AC), eg the percentage of people over 13 years of age who declare to have listened to radio at least once in the previous day). RTL, a French commercial radio network owned by the Luxembourgish RTL group, is the leading national commercial and news station that offers news, talk, and entertainment programs. RTL is the second most listened radio station in France (12.1 percent of AC).\n\nState-owned radio broadcasts belong to the group Radio France: nationwide stations cover general news (France Inter), 24-hour breaking news (France Info), culture (France Culture), classic music (France Musique), jazz music (FIP), pop music, and youth (Mouv), and the France Bleu network that runs local stations covering local news; in addition, Paris-based Radio France International (RFI) covers international news through its worldwide correspondents in 13 different languages.\n\nAt a local level the radio broadcasting landscape offers the local France Bleu stations and a wide range of associative or community and commercial radio stations that mainly broadcast music programs (FM stations).\n\nCompared to TV and press, the radio broadcasting landscape is less concentrated at a local level but quite concentrated at a national level, apart from the public sector that is only covered by Radio France, the State-owned radio stations group (turnover: €652.8m in 2016). However most commercial radio channels belong to media or non-media groups that also own other media outlets (TV, newspapers, magazines, and online media): RTL group runs RTL, and two music commercial channels. Lagardère Active operates three radio channels: Europe1, and two music commercial radios. NextRadioTV owns RMC and the business news-focused BFM Business; the group founded and directed by Alain Weill has been included in the holding founded by Patrick Drahi, SFR Media."
