        "text": "LONDON: French broadcaster Radio France has fired presenter Guillaume Meurice for “serious misconduct” after he made jokes about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nThe decision to terminate the 42-year-old comedian’s contract followed his suspension in early May over remarks he made made on Radio Inter, an affiliate of Radio France.\n\nIn an email to staff, Sibyle Veil, the president of Radio France, blamed a “repeated disloyalty towards the company” as the reason for the dismissal, and said “neither freedom of expression nor humor have ever been threatened.”\n\nA joke Meurice made about Netanyahu during a live show in October sparked complaints from a European Jewish organization that accused him of inciting violence and spreading antisemitic sentiments. Arcom, the French media regulator, issued a warning over the incident.\n\nThe suspension of Meurice last month was criticized by union representatives and editorial staff at Radio Inter, who called a strike and demanded the decision be reversed because it could “create a serious precedent” that restricts “freedom of expression.”\n\nIn a message on social media, Meurice described his dismissal as the “end of a false suspense” and a “victory” for a campaign he largely attributed to the far right.\n\nLONDON: The Committee to Protect Journalists has strongly condemned Israel’s ongoing attempts to label Gaza-based journalists as “terrorists,” describing the actions as part of an “unsubstantiated smear campaign.”\n\nCPJ Program Director Carlos Martinez de la Serna said: “Even before the start of the Israel-Gaza war, CPJ had documented Israel’s pattern of accusing journalists of being terrorists without producing credible evidence to substantiate their claims.\n\n“Smear campaigns endanger journalists and erode public trust in the media. Israel must end this practice and allow independent international investigations into the journalists’ killings.”\n\nSince the conflict’s onset in October, the Israeli military has accused journalists on at least three occasions of engaging in militant activities after they were killed by its forces.\n\nThese allegations have faced significant scrutiny from the international community, which has repeatedly questioned the credibility of the evidence provided.\n\nIn late July, Al Jazeera journalists Ismail Al-Ghoul and freelance camera operator Rami Al-Refee were the latest media workers killed by the Israel Defense Forces.\n\nThe IDF claimed that Al-Ghoul was an engineer in the Hamas Gaza Brigade and a member of Hamas’ Nukhba special forces, presenting what Al Jazeera described as “contradictory information.”\n\nThe network and a Washington Post investigation highlighted inconsistencies in the IDF’s claims, including the fact that Al-Ghoul had been released after being detained by Israeli forces earlier in March.\n\nThe IDF has not yet responded to requests for comments on these allegations.\n\nEarlier, two other Al Jazeera journalists, Hamza Al-Dahdouh and Mustafa Thuraya, were killed in January in an Israeli strike. The military claimed they were operating a drone that posed a threat to IDF soldiers.\n\nHowever, a Washington Post investigation largely disproved these allegations, noting that both journalists had passed through Israeli checkpoints and that Dahdouh had been granted permission to leave Gaza, “a rare privilege unlikely to have been granted to a known militant.”\n\nThe Gaza conflict has become the deadliest for journalists and media workers since records began.\n\nAccording to CPJ, 113 media personnel, mostly Palestinians, have been killed so far, with the actual toll likely to be higher.\n\nIsrael has faced increasing pressure to justify its actions against Palestinian journalists. Advocacy groups have condemned the smear campaign, calling on Tel Aviv to end its practice of labeling journalists as terrorists or militants.\n\nThey are urging the international community to ensure that allegations of war crimes or human rights abuses against journalists are investigated in line with internationally accepted standards, such as the Minnesota Protocol.\n\nkeywords\n\nDUBAI: Rotana has appointed Reem Hiasat as the director of content marketing for the group across the Middle East, Africa, Eastern Europe, and Turkiye.\n\nHiasat has worked with Rotana for over seven years, most recently as corporate e-commerce manager.\n\nIn her new role, she will lead the development and implementation of Rotana’s website content strategy and oversee the creation, management and distribution of content for the group.\n\nHiasat said she’s “looking forward to collaborating with the team to develop impactful content” and a user journey that showcases Rotana’s offerings while engaging audiences.\n\nAmal Harb, corporate vice-president of marketing at Rotana, added: “Her (Hiasat’s) contributions to our organization have been significant, and we are excited to see her continue to excel in this elevated position.”\n\nHiasat holds a bachelor’s degree from the University of Jordan and a diploma in digital marketing and social media from the German Jordanian University in Jordan.\n\nRotana currently operates 80 hotels in the Middle East, Africa, Eastern Europe, and Turkiye, serving more than 6 million guests each year.\n\nLONDON: A performance by renowned pianists Jayson Gillham was canceled by an Australian orchestra after he dedicated a new piece of music to journalists killed in Gaza.\n\nGillham was scheduled to perform with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra on Thursday, but it was announced on Tuesday that he had been removed from the program due to remarks he made during a previous show.\n\nGillham’s comments, made during a Sunday recital at MSO’s Iwaki Auditorium, were described by the orchestra as “an intrusion of personal political views” during a program intended to focus on solo piano works.\n\nIn a statement, the MSO expressed regret and said it “does not condone the use of our stage as a platform for expressing personal views. The MSO understands that his remarks have caused offence and distress and offers a sincere apology. It has been a priority for us to address this difficult situation today.”\n\nGillham introduced a five-minute world premiere piece for piano by Australian composer Connor D’Netto, titled “Witness,” during Sunday’s performance. D’Netto had previously explained that the piece was dedicated to journalists in Gaza, whose “bravery and sacrifice” had deeply affected him.\n\nReports indicate that Gillham referenced the specific targeting of journalists by Israeli forces when introducing the piece.\n\nIn an email to patrons, the MSO clarified that “Witness” was included in the program at Gillham’s request as a “short meditative piece,” but noted that his personal remarks were made “without seeking the MSO’s approval or sanction.”\n\nGillham also performed a piece by Gyorgy Ligeti during the recital, discussing the Hungarian-Austrian composer’s background as a Holocaust survivor and the political context of the composition.\n\nGillham expressed surprise at the orchestra’s reaction, saying he “wasn’t made aware of anything that I wasn’t allowed to say or do, and it was normal to introduce the works.”\n\nHe added: “Over the last 10 months, Israel has killed more than 100 Palestinian journalists. A number of these have been targeted assassinations of prominent journalists as they were travelling in marked press vehicles or wearing their press jackets.”\n\nThe decision to cancel Gillham’s upcoming performance has sparked criticism from some of the orchestra’s patrons, who argued the comments were contextual and the MSO’s response was an overreaction.\n\nkeywords\n\nLONDON: The Committee to Protect Journalists expressed concern on Tuesday for the safety of Gaza-based reporter Anas Al-Sharif following Israeli allegations that he was “covering up” the activities of “terrorists.”\n\nThe controversy arose after an Israeli military strike targeted a school in Gaza City over the weekend, which killed nearly 100 people, according to the local health ministry.\n\nAl-Sharif, a reporter for Al Jazeera, covered the aftermath of the strike, and reported that the Israeli army had targeted the building while people were holding dawn prayers inside.\n\nHis colleague, Tamer Almisshal, praised Al-Sharif online, describing him and his fellow journalists as “knights of audio and video.”\n\nIn response, Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee accused Al-Sharif of covering up alleged crimes committed by Hamas and Islamic Jihad.\n\nAdraee alleged that Al-Sharif knew the identities of several Hamas militants killed in the strike but chose to “present a lie.”\n\n“Of course you’re proud of them,” Adraee responded on X. “He’s covering up the crimes of Hamas and (Islamic) Jihad taking shelter inside schools.\n\n“I am convinced that he knows the names of a great number of the Hamas terrorists among those killed in the school. But he presents a lie, the motivation for which has nothing to do with the residents of Gaza.”\n\nThese accusations were condemned by the CPJ’s Program Director Carlos Martinez de la Serna, who stated that the organization was “deeply concerned” for Al-Sharif’s safety following the army’s claims.\n\n“Al Jazeera journalists have been paying a devastating price for documenting the war. They and all journalists should be protected and allowed to work freely,” he added.\n\nThe allegations were also condemned by the Qatari network, which called the statement made by the Israeli military spokesperson as a “blatant act of intimidation and incitement against our colleague Anas Al-Sharif.”\n\n“Such remarks are not only an attack on Anas’s character and integrity but also a clear attempt to stifle the truth and silence those who are courageously reporting from Gaza,” Al Jazeera added.\n\nAl-Sharif has previously faced threats because of his reporting, and his father was killed in December by an Israeli airstrike that hit his family home in Jabalia.\n\nThe CPJ has documented the killing of at least seven journalists and media workers affiliated with Al Jazeera, which Israel has banned from operating inside the country since its latest war on Gaza.\n\nSince the beginning of the conflict, the CPJ has documented the killing of at least 113 journalists and media workers, mostly Palestinians.\n\nThe situation highlights ongoing tensions between the Israeli government and international media.\n\nOn Monday, Israeli government spokesperson David Mencer accused BBC presenter Mishal Husain and the network of displaying pro-Palestine bias during a heated exchange.\n\nMencer questioned the accuracy of casualty figures reported from Gaza, and sarcastically remarked that Husain deserved the “pro-Palestinian reporter of the year award.”\n\nANKARA: A Turkish court on Monday ordered the arrest of a woman on charges of inciting hatred and insulting the president after she criticized a ban on social media platform Instagram, broadcaster Haberturk and other media said.\n\nTurkiye blocked access to Instagram on Aug 2 for failing to comply with its “laws and rules” and public sensitivities. It removed the ban on Saturday, after it said the Meta Platforms-owned app agreed to cooperate with the authorities to address the government’s concerns.\n\nIn an interview posted on YouTube channel last week, when the app was still blocked, the woman was one of several passers-by who were asked what they thought about the ban.\n\n“This is wrong. The president cannot ban Instagram as he wishes,” the woman said. She also criticized President Tayyip Erdogan and those who supported the ban.\n\nMeta did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the arrest.\n\nMonday’s arrest, ordered by a local court in the western city of Izmir, came after the head of Turkiye’s broadcasting watchdog RTUK criticized street interviews aired on social media, saying they “manipulate public opinion.”\n\nThe Instagram access ban came after a top Turkish official accused the social media platform of blocking posts expressing condolences over the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, a leader of Palestinian militant group Hamas.\n\nkeywords"
