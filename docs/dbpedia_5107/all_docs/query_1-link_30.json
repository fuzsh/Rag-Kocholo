        "text": "Pavol Szalai, head of the EU and Balkans desk at Reporters Without Borders, sees three worrying trends for public service media in Europe.\n\nFirst of all, funding is decreasing in several countries, such as Denmark and Belgium.\n\nSecondly, political pressure on public service journalists – especially from politicians on the far right – is becoming increasingly common. This has been the case in Austria, for example.\n\nThe third, and most serious, trend is direct political interference in the activities of public service media that have become widespread in Eastern and Central Europe.\n\n“We see this trend in Bulgaria, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and, of course, most seriously in Poland and Hungary,” says Szalai.\n\nRadio journalist and author Dariusz Rosiak summarizes the situation in Poland with the words “propaganda” and “demoralization”.\n\nLike many other experienced reporters, he was fired from Radio Troika, where he previously led an in-depth international news program. He still produces pretty much the same program, but as a personal podcast. Listeners are only a tenth of his previous audience, but he makes more money, through crowdfunding.\n\n“Radio Troika is being disbanded. The radio station was legendary in Poland; it was a whole community that many have grown up with, including my children and I,” he says.\n\nIn Poland, public service media has been treated as war spoils for the winning team since 1989, says Rosiak. That was the case even before the national-conservative party Law and Justice’s election victory in 2015. But since then, and especially in the past two years, the scope of political pressure has increased immensly.\n\n“Until 2017–2018 it was still possible to work, you could maneuver, do your own thing. But now it’s no longer possible. Public service media has become a pure propaganda channel, part of the party machinery,” says Rosiak.\n\nSince 2015, the public service media board has been appointed by the government. Three out of five members come from the ruling party.\n\n“These three people decide everything that happens on the radio,” says Rosiak.\n\nThe influence is both pronounced and unspoken. Sometimes there will be straight orders about the topics to be covered. It is implied which guests must be invited and which are prohibited.\n\nDariusz Rosiak doesn’t believe Polish public service radio and television will be able to recover from today’s situation.\n\n“When the Law and Justice party loses power at some point, it will just continue. I hear it from my friends and colleagues waiting to take over: ‘Then, we’ll show you.’”\n\nPrivate, government-critical media also contribute to polarization, and journalists have ended up in two camps – for or against the government.\n\n“In the early 2000s you could go to parties with people who worked for different media outlets, it didn’t matter where you worked. Now that is impossible. Everyone accuses each other of treason.”\n\nHUNGARY\n\nSince Prime Minister Viktor Orbán came to power in 2010, the Hungarian media landscape has changed radically, in a way that is unparalleled in the rest of the EU. The government today controls large parts of the media market; both private and public service media.\n\nIn Hungary, public service media has essentially been transformed into state media, subordinate to the incumbent government, which is consistently favored by the news programs.\n\nPOLAND\n\nDuring the coronavirus crisis, Polish radio censored a government-critical song. The radio listeners voted the song to the top of the chart, but then it was removed from the site. The host has resigned in protest.\n\nThe song Twój ból jest lepszy niż mój (loosely translated to “Your pain is better than mine”) by artist Kazik alludes to Jaroslaw Kaczynski, party leader of the ruling Law and Justice, visiting a cemetery in violation of the country’s coronavirus restrictions.\n\nIt’s just one of many examples of political involvement in public service media.\n\nSince 2016, the government has appointed the public service media board and practically controls the content. Independent organizations show that news reporting systematically favors the governing party Law and Justice.\n\nUK\n\nThe BBC will celebrate its centennial in 2022, but the institution is increasingly being questioned by political leaders.\n\nPoliticians from both the right and the left criticize the BBC for bias when it comes to the choice of interviewees, questions and angles. Ahead of the 2019 parliamentary elections, Prime Minister Boris Johnson boycotted some debates and interviews, citing alleged bias.\n\nDuring the election campaign, Johnson considered scrapping the radio and television fee in the future. The current system is guaranteed until 2027, but funding is being reviewed mid-way, in 2022. The government is also considering decriminalizing failure to pay the license.\n\nDENMARK\n\nPublic service broadcaster Danmarks radio will reduce its expenditure by 20 per cent by 2023, after the conservative government, supported by right-wing Dansk Folkeparti, pushed through a reduction in funding and a transition from license fee to media tax in 2018. The decision has meant that several programs, radio and TV channels have closed down and that about 400 out of 2 700 employees will be laid off.\n\nUKRAINE\n\nLast year, Ukraine’s parliament cut the public broadcasters’ budget by just over 40 per cent. The slimmed-down budget has impacted the programming.\n\nDue to the coronavirus pandemic, a revised state budget has been proposed for 2020, where public service allocations are reduced by another 10 per cent.\n\nAUSTRIA\n\nIndividual journalists at public service company ORF have been threatened by politicians from populist right-wing party FPÖ. In an interview last year, FPÖ politician Harald Vilimsky said there would be “consequences” for political journalist Armin Wolf. Since then, the party has campaigned against Wolf.\n\nFPÖ sat in a coalition government with conservative ÖVP until the “Ibiza scandal” last year, when a hidden recording from a couple of years earlier was published showing how FPÖ’s then-party leader Heinz-Christian Strache conspired with a woman he thought was a relative of a Russian oligarch. Among other things, Strache said that if FPÖ was helped to power, the party would restructure the ORF.\n\nBULGARIA\n\nIn Bulgaria, public service media is subject to political pressure. Last September, long-time radio profile Silvia Velikova was removed from the news program she led, after she critically investigated the appointment of Bulgaria’s new national prosecutor.\n\nThe next day, the radio had a five-hour break from broadcasting as radio journalists refused to replace Velikova. The delay was excused as “technical problems”.\n\nSLOVENIA\n\nThe Slovenian government is trying to tighten control of public service media. It has replaced three members of the board tasked with guaranteeing the independence of public service media companies, and tried to replace two more, which was blocked in Parliament because it violated the rules.\n\nPrime Minister Janez Janša, who took office for the third time in March of 2020, has accused the public service media company RTV of spreading lies and has threatened to cut state funding. Hate campaigns are regularly conducted against critical journalists.\n\nBELGIUM\n\nThe Flemish public service media company VRT must save 12 million euros over the next five years. Since 2007, some 600 employees have been laid off in major cuts. The latest funding cuts caused public service media employees to protest in December of 2019.\n\nCROATIA\n\nIn Croatia, politicians, public figures and business leaders use defamation cases as a means of controlling critical journalists. Last year, journalists in Zagreb protested after the public service media company HRT reported its own journalists for defamation in more than 30 cases.\n\nCritics believe HRT is acting under pressure from the government.\n\nBOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA\n\nThe public service media company BHRT in Bosnia and Herzegovina has been underfunded and in debt for several years, and is at risk of being shut down. Since 2016, the company has broadcast very limited programming, only sports and reruns.\n\nGREECE\n\nShortly after liberal-conservative New Democracy came to power in July 2019, a presidential decree was issued that placed public service media company ERT directly under the supervision of Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis. During the election campaign, New Democracy boycotted ERT’s debates, on the grounds that the ERT was favoring the incumbent government.\n\nWhen New Democracy reigned in 2013, the party closed the ERT with reference to savings. The subsequent left-wing government restarted ERT two years later but was accused of using the public service company as a propaganda megaphone.\n\nIn 2020, ERT introduced stronger management control of its correspondents’ reporting on refugee issues.\n\nMONTENEGRO\n\nMontenegro’s public service media company RTCG is increasingly controlled by the ruling party DPS.\n\nIn 2017, Parliament replaced an independent member of the Public Service Media Board with a government loyalist.\n\nThe following year, the RTCG board fired the company’s CEO, which the Montenegrin trade union for media employees, SMCG, interpreted as an attempt by DPS to control the editorial content. Following the dismissal, the European External Action Service said that Montenegro – a so-called candidate country for the EU – “violates freedom of expression and media freedom, which are fundamental values in the EU”.\n\nIn the spring of 2020, RTCG initiated disciplinary proceedings against two of its journalists, after they published information about irregularities at the company on social media.\n\nSPAIN\n\nPublic service broadcasters have been accused of bias in their coverage of the Catalan independence referendum of 2017. National broadcaster TVE ran only sparse coverage of the referendum and showed no images of police violence against Catalan protestors. The journalist trade union at TVE has accused management of bias censorship and manipulation.\n\nMeanwhile, the Spanish government has accused Catalan public service broadcaster TV3 of spreading independence propaganda, including through kid’s shows.\n\nRTVE (Spanish radio and television) have appointed board members with links to the Spanish government, while TV3 have appointed board members close to the independence movement.\n\nFRANCE\n\nA major public service media reform is currently underway in France. French public service broadcasters, today spilt into five different companies, are to be governed by a single joint holding company. There is some concern that the independence and character of the broadcasters will diminish with the centralization. The Board of Directors of France Médias, where the state has a minority role, will appoint the company’s CEO.\n\nCZECH REPUBLIC\n\nIn March 2020, leaked e-mails showed how the ruling party ANO controlled the appointment of board members for public service television. Before a vote in Parliament, ANO MP’s were encouraged to vote for people close to the party, while experienced, critical publicists were blacklisted.\n\nITALY\n\nIt’s not uncommon for Italians governments to appoint new managers for the countries politicized public service media sector, but the election of Marcello Foa as new chairman of the board in September 2018 nevertheless aroused concern among employees at public service broadcaster RAI. Foa was previously at il Giornale, a part of former PM Silvio Berlusconi’s media empire. He has on multiple occasions been caught sharing fake news on social media and has expressed admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nFoa was nominated by the then Deputy Prime Ministers Luigi di Maio, of the populist 5-Star Movement and Matteo Salvini of far right party Lega. According to di Maio, the appointment was the beginning of a “cultural revolution” that would “get rid of the people benefiting from nepotism and the parasites”.\n\nFoa has continued to cause controversy. Shortly after taking office, in an interview with Israeli newspaper Haaretz, he accused the Social Democratic party PD of receiving money from Hungarian-American businessman George Soros, often the target of right-wing and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories."
