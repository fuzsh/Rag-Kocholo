        "text": "A French journalist forced to leave India after authorities declined to renew his journalism permit has described the action as “a slap in the face.”\n\nSébastien Farcis, a correspondent for European outlets including Radio France Internationale, is the third foreign journalist this year who says they had to leave the country over visa or work permit issues.\n\nMedia watchdogs and analysts have questioned whether the denied visa renewals are part of a broader effort by India’s government to silence critical foreign journalists.\n\nWithout a valid permit, Farcis told VOA, he was unable to work and so had no option but to leave India while filing a fresh application. The reporter said he has not received an explanation about why the permit was not renewed.\n\nFarcis, who has worked in India for 13 years, said he was informed of the decision the day before India’s elections, and that the action prevented him from covering the vote.\n\nSpeaking to VOA via email, Farcis told VOA he was shocked.\n\n“It felt like a slap in the face, as I have invested 13 years of my life in this country, and felt so close to it as I married an Indian woman,” he said. “There was no warning nor explanation about it, just a line over email saying the permit was DENIED, in capital. It was violent and felt like a censorship.”\n\nFarcis said when he asked the External Affairs Ministry about his case, officials expressed surprise. The journalist has since applied for a new work permit so he can return.\n\nHe added that he believes his case is part of a broader move by the Indian government to silence critical foreign journalists, following similar measures taken against local media through legal and financial pressures.\n\nThe Ministries of Home Affairs and External Affairs did not immediately respond to VOA’s email requesting comment.\n\nBut in a video last week, an External Affairs ministry spokesperson said Farcis had made the decision to leave, and that an application for the work permit is under consideration.\n\nTwo other foreign journalists faced similar challenges this year: Avani Dias, from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, and French journalist Vanessa Dougnac.\n\nIn the case of Dias, authorities issued a short extension at the last moment, she said. But she still had to leave for Australia. She told reporters at the time she believes the denial was related to her coverage on the killing of a Sikh separatist.\n\nSimilar to Farcis’ case, authorities later denied that Dias was forced to leave, saying it had been her choice.\n\nAnd in February, Dougnac says she was forced to leave after the India Home Ministry denied her work permit.\n\nDougnac told VOA that the cases for her and Farcis represent an alarming trend of repression against journalists.\n\nThe journalist, who contributes to several French-language media outlets, said it marks a stark difference from her two decades in the country.\n\n“The essence of the work as a foreign correspondent was to report freely on India. For two decades, I felt valued and respected in India — a country that acknowledged the crucial role journalists play in upholding democratic values and freedom of speech,” she said via email. “Regrettably and unexpectedly, this perception changed.”\n\nDougnac said the permit denial left her feeling very vulnerable as a foreign journalist.\n\n“My experience occurred in the context of increasing repression faced by Indian journalists,” she said. “Slowly, foreign correspondents began to sense they were next as the restrictions on their work kept increasing.”\n\nDougnac said it is hard to continue her career from outside India. But “solidarity is crucial for journalists facing difficulties. I believe overcoming this situation would have been very difficult for me without this support.”"
