        "text": "In Depth Subscribers only\n\nOn the 80th anniversary of the Provence landings, Emmanuel Macron's African memorial headache\n\nFrance's declining influence in Africa is reflected in the representation of the continent's states at commemorations of Operation Dragoon, which opened the southern front on August 15, 1944, with the massive participation of soldiers from the colonies.\n\nOp-Ed Subscribers only\n\nThe French PM 'should be someone who is politically well-versed but sufficiently respected to transcend political divisions'\n\nTo prevent a vote of no confidence, the future prime minister should not seem like the president's ally or a potential presidential candidate and should advocate for the implementation of proportional representation.\n\nIn Depth Subscribers only\n\nAs Olympic 'political truce' ends, Macron's prime minister search resumes\n\nFive weeks after the defeat of his camp in the second round of the legislative elections, the French president has still not appointed a successor to Gabriel Attal. He is expected to begin consultations in the week of August 19.\n\nNews\n\nOlympic Games showed world 'the true face of France,' says Macron\n\n'We don't want life to get back to normal,' President Emmanuel Macron said, the day after the closing ceremony.\n\nLong Read Subscribers only\n\nLeft-wing candidate Lucie Castets' strange campaign for France's premiership\n\nOver the two weeks since her name burst onto the French political scene, the Nouveau Front Populaire's candidate for prime minister has been thrust into the limelight and is trying to forge a reputation for herself.\n\nInterview Subscribers only\n\nParis Mayor Anne Hidalgo: 'These Games and the opening ceremony crush the far right's message'\n\nThe Socialist mayor of the French capital expressed joy and pride at the Games' success in an interview with Le Monde. She was also angry about the criticism of the city and her actions, behind which she sees the undermining work of the 'reactionary and far-right world'.\n\nIn Depth Subscribers only\n\nIs France's Olympic joy only an intermission?\n\nSince the opening of the Olympic Games, the French have shown their desire to share moments together. The country seems far away from the image of a divided society given off by the European and parliamentary elections only weeks ago.\n\nNews Subscribers only\n\nParis Olympics: Emmanuel Macron congratulates athletes and hopes for a 'legacy of pride'\n\nOn Friday, the President came to attend the Olympic events, as French athletes racked up medals. He aimed to get a sense of the country's enthusiasm, as it appears united and reconciled.\n\nColumn\n\nFour French MPs and a deluge of hatred. Does anyone care?\n\nFour radical-left MPs sat on a bench in the Assemblée Nationale on the first day of the new parliamentary session, and X users went wild. Le Monde's fashion columnist looked into the picture more closely.\n\nIn Depth Subscribers only\n\nFrench audit court criticizes Elysée spending on receptions and trips\n\n'Significant efforts will have to be undertaken, starting in 2024, in order to restore and perpetuate balance,' warned the state auditors, calling out an €8.3 million deficit in the French presidency's budget.\n\nIn Depth Subscribers only\n\nMacron looks to use Olympic 'political truce' to hone his plan for a new prime minister\n\nEmmanuel Macron is spending some time at the presidential holiday residence in southern France, still looking for a prime minister who could create consensus on both the left and right.\n\nNews Subscribers only\n\nParis shifts position and recognizes Morocco's sovereignty over Western Sahara\n\nRisking a new crisis with Algeria, French President Emmanuel Macron wrote in a letter to king Mohammed VI, that the territory's future falls 'within the context of Moroccan sovereignty.'\n\nNews\n\nMacron praises Olympics opening ceremony that made France 'extremely proud'\n\nSpeaking the day after France became the first Olympic host to take the opening ceremony out of a stadium, the French president said 'people told us this was impossible, but we did it thanks to your hard work.'\n\nNews Subscribers only\n\n'Now, it's the Olympics': Macron declares 'political truce' but French government still on alert\n\nFrance is officially kicking off the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. President Emmanuel Macron hopes that his idea of a 'political truce' will temporarily put aside the governmental crisis that has gripped the country over recent weeks.\n\nEditorial\n\nMacron's dangerous budget game\n\nWeakened by his risky snap elections gamble, the president is dithering and the political scene is getting tenser by the day. This is problematic because if this wait-and-see situation were to degenerate into a budget crisis, the French would be the first to lose out.\n\nIn Depth Subscribers only\n\nHow the French left is preparing Lucie Castets, its surprise candidate for prime minister, to govern\n\nThe Paris City Hall's finance director has called on the president to 'take responsibility' by appointing her without delay.
