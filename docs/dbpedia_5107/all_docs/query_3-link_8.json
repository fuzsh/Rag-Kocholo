        "text": "RCA was founded as Radio Corporation of America by the General Electric Company in 1919 to acquire Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America (incorporated in 1899). A subsidiary of a British-owned company, Marconi Wireless at that time was the only company capable of handling commercial transatlantic radio communications, and General Electric took it over with the assistance of the U.S. Navy Department, which was eager to keep the technology in American hands. For the following 50 years the company was led by David Sarnoff, who built the company into a modern communications conglomerate.\n\nWestinghouse beat RCA to the first commercial radio broadcast in 1920, but Sarnoff followed in 1921 with the first sports broadcast. In 1926 the National Broadcasting Company was set up to carry on the company’s radio activities. In 1929 the company acquired the Victor Talking Machine Company and in 1939 developed the first experimental television set. The first black-and-white sets went on sale in 1946, and colour became available four years later. Meanwhile, NBC had divested itself of one of its two networks (the “Blue” network), and this became the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). General Electric Company acquired RCA in 1986 for more than $6,000,000,000 in what was the largest non-oil company merger up to that time. RCA also is active in military and space electronics and satellite communications. In 1987 General Electric sold RCA’s consumer-electronics manufacturing operations to the French corporation Thomson-Brandt, SA."
