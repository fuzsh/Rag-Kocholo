        "text": "In a changing audio landscape, marked by the advent of digital technology and changes in public usages, radio media is also transforming.\n\nDiversification of content, multiple modes of access, emerging players and increased competition define this plentiful world. In this context, radio continues to be listened to by nearly 40 million listeners every day and stands out as the leading offering in a wider audio ecosystem.\n\n\"Radio is an essential media with more than 7 out of 10 French people listening to it every day and, once again, this year demonstrated its ability to adapt to new usages by diversifying its formats, content and modes of access. The measurement needs to take into account all its evolutions and their impact on the audience, which is why, in agreement with market players, we optimised the EAR > National survey and started EAR > Insights in order to combine two complementary methodologies for adapting to the specifics of radio. At the heart of dialogue with the market, we will continue to enhance our measurements to report on the evolution of points of contact with radio media.\" Emmanuelle Le Goff, Director of Radio & Total Audio\n\nRadio is a powerful medium for all audiences\n\nIn the 2022-2023 season, listeners listened to the radio for an average of 2 hours 36 minutes per day. And every morning at 8 am, more than 12 million French people tune in, during the medium's daily peak audience. Morning shows are real audience hubs and stand out as a special time for information and entertainment; nearly half of French people (44%) listen to the radio every day between 6 am and 9 am.\n\nRadium is a medium for all audiences and all generations Radio is particularly popular among 35-59 year olds as 80% of them listen to it every day and over-consume all kinds of stations (music, general interest, special-interest and local). While radio brings older people together (74%), it also attracts young people under the age of 35: 53% of 13-24 year olds and 62% of 25-34 year olds listen to it every day. In addition, influential targets are particularly fond of radio: 86% of upper-level executives listen to it on a daily basis.\n\nRadio is in tune with French people\n\nRadio is a companion media that follows French people throughout their day and their travels. More than half of the media's listening volume occurs outside the home (52%), mainly in the car (35%).\n\nRadio listening varies depending on where people live. People in the Greater Paris Region for example, have quite a sedentary media listening experience with 61% of the listening volume of residents of the Paris area taking place at home.\n\nA genuine local media, radio has strong local roots, with nearly 1,000 radio stations throughout the country. More than 9 million people listen to a local radio station every day, in addition to those listening to local programmes on national radio stations.\n\nReflecting digital life, radio's digital audiences are also increasing: today, 9.3 million French people listen to radio on digital media every day (i.e. 40% more than 5 years ago),with mobiles phones in the lead (5.6 million daily listeners).\n\n\"As a medium for both mobility and proximity, radio has been able to integrate into connected devices to stay as close as possible to its listeners. Radio audiences continue to grow digitally, which is a great opportunity to stay ahead of the game in an audio ecosystem that never stops reinventing itself.\"Julie Terrade, Director of National Radio\n\nRadio is a pillar of the audio world\n\nRadio is making waves in an increasingly rich audio world. Whether live or through podcasts, in 2023 it represents 58% of the listening volume of the available audio offers.\n\nDespite competition from music streaming audio and video platforms, radio remains the primary medium for listening to music, with 42% of the listening volume of “music” audio content over a day.\n\nIn this expanding audio world in which the content listened to is free from any time constraints, podcasts take pride of place with 20 million monthly listeners (39% of the population). This format is particularly popular with young people, with 50% of 15-24 year olds listening to it each month.\n\nPlease click on the icon to download the comprehensive press release."
