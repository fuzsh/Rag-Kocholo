        "text": "The tiny principality of Andorra is located in the high mountains of the Pyrenees between France and Spain.\n\nThe mainstay of the highly-prosperous economy is tourism, accounting for about 80% of GDP. An estimated 10 million people visit each year, drawn by winter sports, a warm summer climate and duty-free goods.\n\nThe country's banking sector enjoys partial tax-haven status.\n\nFor more than 700 years Andorra was ruled jointly by the leader of France and the Spanish bishop of Urgell.\n\nThe first Andorran Constitution was passed in 1993, establishing parliamentary government. It then joined the United Nations and Council of Europe.\n\nThe French president and the bishop of Urgell are still joint co-princes and heads of state, but the roles are honorary.\n\nAndorra is not a member of the EU, but enjoys a special relationship with it and uses the euro.\n\nXavier Espot Zamora became prime minister following the April 2019 general elections. He was reelected as prime minister in April 2023.\n\nIn recent years the government has instituted many reforms. It legalized political parties and trade unions, and legally guaranteed freedom of religion and assembly.\n\nThere has also been a redefinition of the qualifications for Andorran citizenship, a major issue in a country where only a minority of residents are legal citizens.\n\nIn July 2022, lawmakers voted unanimously to allow same-sex couples access to civil marriage."
