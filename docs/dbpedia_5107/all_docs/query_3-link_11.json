While roommates in Los Angeles the two developed a short hand in writing music together. Carlson’s award-winning 2014 rockumentary, titled\n\n“Different Town”, was inspired by the song ofthe same name, written by the two while traveling.\n\nA few years later, Ackles and Carlson relocated to Austin, TX and\n\ndecided to form Radio Company. The duo recently recorded their debut\n\nalbum at the legendary Arlyn Studios. Other musicians on the album include Eric Tessmer, Chris Masterson (Steve Earle, Son Volt, Shooter Jennings), Bukka Allen (Jack Ingram, Ryan Bingham, Joe Walsh), Warren Hood (Little Feat, Lyle Lovett, Bruce Robison, Alejandro Escovedo, Joe Ely), and Brian Standefer (Ryan Bingham, Ben Kweller, Reckless Kelly)."
