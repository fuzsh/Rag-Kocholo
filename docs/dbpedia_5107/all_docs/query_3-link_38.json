        "text": "DENVER, Aug. 7, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- SM Energy Company (the \"Company\") (NYSE: SM) today reported operating and financial results for the second quarter 2024, provided certain full year and third quarter 2024 guidance, and announced that the Company has exercised its option to acquire assets located adjacent to its recently announced XCL Acquisition.\n\nExcellent operational execution supported strong second quarter results including:\n\nNet production was 14.4 MMBoe, or 158.5 MBoe/d, at 46% oil or 72.7 MBbls/d, which exceeded guidance. Higher than expected oil production and total production were driven largely by better than expected performance from Midland Basin wells and higher than expected oil content from new South Texas wells.\n\nReturn of capital to stockholders during the quarter totaled $71.9 million through the repurchase of 1,058,956 shares of common stock and payment of the Company's $0.18 per share quarterly dividend on May 3, 2024. In June 2024, the Board approved an 11% increase in the Company's fixed quarterly dividend policy, from $0.18 to $0.20 per share, expected to commence in the fourth quarter 2024, and reloaded the Company's existing stock repurchase program to $500 million, following repurchases totaling $369.1 million in shares through the second quarter, and extended the program through December 31, 2027.\n\nNet income was $210.3 million, or $1.82 per diluted common share, Adjusted net income(1) was $1.85 per diluted common share, net cash provided by operating activities was $476.4 million and Adjusted EBITDAX(1) was $485.9 million, all of which benefited from strong oil production and higher than expected oil and NGL prices.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $476.4 million before net change in working capital of $(50.2) million totaled $426.2 million(1) and capital expenditures of $322.7 million adjusted for a change in capital expenditure accruals of $5.1 million were $327.8 million.(1) Capital expenditures include approximately $12.0 million for an opportunistic bulk pre-purchase of pipe that was not considered in guidance.\n\nAdjusted free cash flow(1) was $98.4 million, up 45% from the first quarter 2024.\n\nAgreements to acquire assets totaling $2.1 billion expand the Company's top-tier portfolio of low breakeven assets, add approximately 63,300 net acres and 465 net locations, and are expected to be accretive on all key financial metrics:\n\nOn August 5, 2024, the Company exercised its option to acquire 80% of certain additional assets adjacent to the XCL Resources, LLC asset acquisition in the core of the Uinta Basin for approximately $70.0 million (together with the XCL Acquisition, the \"Uinta Basin Acquisitions\"). The assets include, net to the Company's 80% interest, approximately 26,100 net acres, approximately 1 MBoe per day production (based on September 2024 projection) that is 75% oil, and an estimated 75 net drilling locations (normalized to 10,000 feet).\n\nAs previously announced, the Company executed and delivered a Purchase and Sale Agreement to acquire an 80% undivided interest in the oil and gas assets of XCL Resources, LLC, and affiliated entities (the \"XCL Acquisition\"). The assets include, net to the Company's 80% interest, 37,200 net acres in the Uinta Basin, 43 MBoe/d net production (based on September 2024 projection) that is 88% oil, 107 MMBoe preliminary estimated net proved reserves and an estimated 390 net drilling locations (normalized to 10,000 feet). The transaction has a May 1, 2024, effective date and is expected to close on October 1, 2024. There can be no assurance that this transaction will close on time or at all.\n\nIn addition, the Company confirmed that two initial Woodford-Barnett wells at Sweetie Peck were successfully brought on-line during the second quarter. These wells, together with offset operator wells, indicate more than 20,000 net acres at Sweetie Peck that are prospective for Woodford-Barnett development (inclusive of the previously announced acreage additions to the west).\n\nSubsequent to quarter-end, the Company issued and sold $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.750% senior notes due 2029 and $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.000% senior notes due 2032. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the notes offering, together with cash on hand and borrowings under its Credit Agreement, to fund the Uinta Basin Acquisitions, redeem all of its outstanding 5.625% Notes due in 2025, and to pay related fees and expenses.\n\nOn July 25, 2024, the Company issued a notice of redemption to the holders of the 2025 Senior Notes, notifying such holders that the Company intends to redeem the $349.1 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of its 2025 Senior Notes on August 26, 2024.\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer Herb Vogel comments: \"Successful operational execution once again this quarter tops off a great first half of 2024. Second quarter results were driven by strong performance from both core areas. In the Midland Basin, well performance exceeded expectations, while in South Texas performance from recent, fully bounded wells is expected to deliver payout in approximately six months. In addition, preliminary results from two Woodford-Barnett test wells in the Sweetie Peck area look very strong.\n\n\"We are excited to significantly expand our top-tier portfolio through the acquisition of assets in the core of the Uinta Basin. The scale of the combined acquisitions, adding approximately 63,300 net acres and 465 net locations, positions the Company for substantial growth in oil rich production and Adjusted free cash flow(1) plus extends the inventory runway. Purchased for less than a three-times Adjusted EBITDAX multiple,(1) the acquisitions offer value creation opportunity and support the increased return of capital program.\"\n\nSECOND QUARTER 2024 RESULTS\n\nSecond quarter net production volumes were 14.4 MMBoe (158.5 MBoe/d) and were 46% oil (72.7 MBbl/d). Volumes were 50% from the Midland Basin and 50% from South Texas.\n\nSecond quarter net production exceeded expectations due to strong performance from Midland Basin wells and higher than expected oil content from new South Texas wells.\n\nSecond quarter average realized price before the effect of hedges was $43.92 per Boe, and average realized price after the effect of hedges was $45.07 per Boe.(1)\n\nSecond quarter benchmark pricing included NYMEX WTI at $80.57/Bbl, NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas at $1.89/MMBtu and OPIS Composite NGLs at $27.96/Bbl.\n\nThe effect of commodity net derivative settlements for the second quarter was a gain of $1.15 per Boe, or $16.5 million.\n\nFor additional operating metrics and regional detail, please see the Financial Highlights section below and the accompanying slide deck.\n\nNET INCOME, NET INCOME PER SHARE AND NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES\n\nSecond quarter 2024 net income was $210.3 million, or $1.82 per diluted common share, compared with net income of $149.9 million, or $1.25 per diluted common share, for the same period in 2023. The primary drivers of increased net income were higher production volumes and realized prices per Boe combined with lower LOE and transportation costs per Boe. On a per share basis, the Company's stock repurchase program contributed to a 4.4 million decrease in the weighted-average diluted share count from June 30, 2023 to June 30, 2024, further boosting EPS. For the first six months of 2024, net income was $341.5 million, or $2.94 per diluted common share, compared with net income of $348.4 million, or $2.88 per diluted common share, for the same period in 2023.\n\nSecond quarter 2024 net cash provided by operating activities of $476.4 million before net change in working capital of $(50.2) million totaled $426.2 million(1) compared with net cash provided by operating activities of $383.3 million before net change in working capital of $(21.8) million that totaled $361.5 million(1) for the same period in 2023. The $64.7 million, or 18%, increase in the current year period is primarily due to the higher revenue and lower costs described above. For the first six months of 2024, net cash provided by operating activities of $752.4 million before net change in working capital of $47.5 million totaled $799.9 million(1) compared with net cash provided by operating activities of $714.9 million before net change in working capital of $4.4 million that totaled $719.3 million(1) for the same period in 2023.\n\nADJUSTED EBITDAX,(1) ADJUSTED NET INCOME,(1) AND NET DEBT-TO-ADJUSTED EBITDAX(1)\n\nSecond quarter 2024 Adjusted EBITDAX(1) was $485.9 million, up $95.7 million, or 25%, from $390.2 million for the same period in 2023. For the first six months of 2024, Adjusted EBITDAX(1) was $895.0 million, up $103.4 million, or 13%, from $791.6 million for the same period in 2023.\n\nSecond quarter 2024 Adjusted net income(1) was $214.4 million, or $1.85 per diluted common share, compared with an Adjusted net income(1) of $153.8 million, or $1.28 per diluted common share, for the same period in 2023. For the first six months of 2024, Adjusted net income(1) was $378.5 million, or $3.26 per diluted common share, compared with an Adjusted net income(1) of $316.0 million, or $2.61 per diluted common share, for the same period in 2023.\n\nAt June 30, 2024, Net debt-to-Adjusted EBITDAX(1) was 0.6 times.\n\nCAPITAL EXPENDITURES(1)\n\nSecond quarter 2024 capital expenditures of $322.7 million adjusted for a change in capital expenditure accruals of $5.1 million totaled $327.8 million.(1) Capital expenditures included approximately $12.0 million related to a bulk pre-purchase of pipe that was not considered in guidance. Capital activity during the quarter included drilling 31 net wells, of which 10 were in South Texas and 21 were in the Midland Basin, and adding 36 net flowing completions, of which 10 were in South Texas and 26 were in the Midland Basin.\n\nFor the first six months of 2024, capital expenditures of $655.0 million adjusted for change in capital accruals of $(21.5) million totaled $633.6 million.(1) Capital activity during the first six months included drilling 60 net wells, of which 22 were in South Texas and 38 were in the Midland Basin, and adding 63 net flowing completions, of which 26 were in South Texas and 37 were in the Midland Basin.\n\nADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW(1)\n\nSecond quarter 2024 cash flow from operations before net change in working capital totaled $426.2 million,(1) and capital expenditures before changes in accruals totaled $327.8 million,(1) delivering Adjusted free cash flow of $98.4 million.(1)\n\nRETURN OF CAPITAL TO STOCKHOLDERS\n\nReturn of capital to stockholders during the quarter totaled $71.9 million through the repurchase of 1,058,956 shares of common stock and payment of the Company's $0.18 per share quarterly dividend on May 3, 2024. Since announcing the return of capital program in September 2022, the Company has repurchased approximately 10.1 million shares, or 8% of shares then outstanding, and returned $500.7 million to stockholders, inclusive of dividends and common stock repurchases.\n\nIn June 2024, the Board approved an 11% increase in the Company's fixed quarterly dividend policy, from $0.18 to $0.20 per share, expected to commence in the fourth quarter 2024, and re-authorized the Company's existing stock repurchase program, re-loading the authorized amount to $500 million through December 31, 2027.\n\nFINANCIAL POSITION AND LIQUIDITY\n\nOn June 30, 2024, the outstanding principal amount of the Company's long-term debt was $1.59 billion, with zero drawn on the Company's senior secured revolving credit facility, and cash and cash equivalents were $487.9 million. Net debt(1) was $1.10 billion. The cash balance does not include restricted cash of $102.0 million that is held in escrow as a performance deposit in connection with the XCL Acquisition.\n\nSubsequent to quarter-end, the Company issued and sold $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.750% senior notes due 2029, and $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.000% senior notes due 2032. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the notes offering, together with cash on hand and borrowings under its Credit Agreement, to fund the Uinta Basin Acquisitions, redeem all of its outstanding 5.625% Notes due in 2025, and pay related fees and expenses. The notes were issued at par, and the 2029 notes have a mandatory redemption provision should the pending XCL Acquisition not close on or before July 1, 2025.\n\nCOMMODITY DERIVATIVES\n\nAs of July 31, 2024, commodity derivative positions for the third through fourth quarters of 2024 include:\n\nSWAPS AND COLLARS:\n\nOil: Approximately 5,830 MBbls, or 40-45% of expected 3Q-4Q 2024 net oil production before consideration of the Uinta Basin Acquisitions, is hedged to benchmark prices at an average price of $70.77/Bbl (weighted-average of collar floors and swaps) to $79.93/Bbl (weighted-average of collar ceilings and swaps), excluding basis swaps.\n\nNatural gas: Approximately 16,430 BBtu, or 20-25% of expected 3Q-4Q 2024 net natural gas production before consideration of the Uinta Basin Acquisitions, is hedged to benchmark prices at an average price of $3.40/MMBtu (weighted-average of collar floors and swaps, excluding basis swaps).\n\nBASIS SWAPS:\n\nOil, Midland Basin differential: Approximately 2,470 MBbls of expected 3Q-4Q 2024 net Midland Basin oil production are hedged to the local price point at a positive weighted-average price of $1.21/Bbl.\n\nGas, WAHA differential: Approximately 10,580 BBtu of expected 3Q-4Q 2024 net Midland Basin natural gas production are hedged to WAHA at a weighted-average price of ($0.86)/MMBtu.\n\nGas, HSC differential: Approximately 9,180 BBtu of expected 3Q-4Q 2024 net South Texas natural gas production are hedged to HSC at a weighted-average price of ($0.35)/MMBtu.\n\nA detailed schedule of these and additional derivative positions are provided in the 2Q24 accompanying slide deck.\n\n2024 OPERATING PLAN AND GUIDANCE\n\nThe Company is unable to provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP capital expenditures because components of the calculation are inherently unpredictable, such as changes to, and timing of, capital accruals. The inability to project certain components of the calculation would significantly affect the accuracy of a reconciliation.\n\nUPDATED GUIDANCE FULL YEAR 2024:\n\nPresented before consideration of Uinta Basin Acquisitions.\n\nFull year guidance for net production is unchanged at 57-60 MMBoe, or 156-164 MBoe/d.\n\nOil production, as a percent of total production, is increased from 44% to 45%, or an average of 70-74 MBbls/d.\n\nFull year guidance for capital expenditures (net of the change in capital accruals),(1) excluding acquisitions, is unchanged at $1.14-$1.18 billion. The Company has increased the number of net wells drilled and completed in 2024 to approximately 123 and 125, respectively.\n\nOther expense line items remain unchanged.\n\nPreliminary assumptions for consolidation of Uinta Basin assets for the fourth quarter only.\n\nUinta Basin assets expected to add production volumes after close of 44 MBoe/d at 87% oil.\n\nCapital expenditures related to Uinta Basin assets are expected to add between $100-120 million.\n\nGUIDANCE THIRD QUARTER 2024:\n\nPresented without consideration of Uinta Basin Acquisitions, where expected closing is after quarter-end.\n\nCapital expenditures (net of the change in capital accruals),(1) excluding acquisitions: are expected to range between $300-$310 million. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company expects to drill approximately 33 net wells, of which 14 are planned for South Texas and 19 are planned for the Midland Basin, and turn-in-line approximately 39 net wells, of which 22 are planned for South Texas and 17 are planned for the Midland Basin. The increased third quarter completion activity in South Texas is expected to contribute to higher volumes and a slight reduction in the oil percentage in the fourth quarter.\n\nProduction volumes are expected to range between 15.0-15.4 MMBoe, or 163-167 MBoe/d, up 0.8 MMBoe sequentially at the mid-point. Oil volumes are expected to be 45-46% of total volumes.\n\nUPCOMING EVENTS\n\nEARNINGS Q&A WEBCAST AND CONFERENCE CALL\n\nAugust 8, 2024 – Please join SM Energy management at 8:00 a.m. Mountain time/10:00 a.m. Eastern time for the second quarter 2024 financial and operating results Q&A session.

Please refer below to the section \"Definitions of non-GAAP Measures and Metrics as Calculated by the Company\" in Financials Highlights for additional information.\n\nABOUT THE COMPANY\n\nSM Energy Company is an independent energy company currently engaged in the acquisition, exploration, development, and production of oil, gas, and NGLs in the state of Texas. SM Energy routinely posts important information about the Company on its website. For more information about SM Energy, please visit its website at www.sm-energy.com.\n\nSM ENERGY INVESTOR CONTACTS\n\nJennifer Martin Samuels, [email protected], 303-864-2507\n\nDEFINITIONS OF NON-GAAP MEASURES AND METRICS AS CALCULATED BY THE COMPANY\n\nTo supplement the presentation of its financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company provides certain non-GAAP measures and metrics, which are used by management and the investment community to assess the Company's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, as well as compare performance from period to period and across the Company's peer group. The Company believes these measures and metrics are widely used by the investment community, including investors, research analysts and others, to evaluate and compare recurring financial results among upstream oil and gas companies in making investment decisions or recommendations. These measures and metrics, as presented, may have differing calculations among companies and investment professionals and may not be directly comparable to the same measures and metrics provided by others. A non-GAAP measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measure or any other measure of a company's financial or operating performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of the Company's non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is presented below. These measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\n\nAdjusted EBITDAX: Adjusted EBITDAX is calculated as net income before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depletion, depreciation, amortization and asset retirement obligation liability accretion expense, exploration expense, property abandonment and impairment expense, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, derivative gains and losses net of settlements, gains and losses on divestitures, gains and losses on extinguishment of debt, and certain other items. Adjusted EBITDAX excludes certain items that the Company believes affect the comparability of operating results and can exclude items that are generally non-recurring in nature or whose timing and/or amount cannot be reasonably estimated. Adjusted EBITDAX is a non-GAAP measure that the Company believes provides useful additional information to investors and analysts, as a performance measure, for analysis of the Company's ability to internally generate funds for exploration, development, acquisitions, and to service debt. The Company is also subject to financial covenants under the Company's Credit Agreement, a material source of liquidity for the Company, based on Adjusted EBITDAX ratios. Please reference the Company's second quarter 2024 Form 10-Q and the most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of the Credit Agreement and its covenants.\n\nAdjusted free cash flow: Adjusted free cash flow is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities before net change in working capital less capital expenditures before changes in accruals. The Company uses this measure as representative of the cash from operations, in excess of capital expenditures that provides liquidity to fund discretionary obligations such as debt reduction, returning cash to stockholders or expanding the business.\n\nAdjusted net income and Adjusted net income per diluted common share: Adjusted net income and Adjusted net income per diluted common share excludes certain items that the Company believes affect the comparability of operating results, including items that are generally non-recurring in nature or whose timing and/or amount cannot be reasonably estimated. These items include non-cash and other adjustments, such as derivative gains and losses net of settlements, impairments, net (gain) loss on divestiture activity, gains and losses on extinguishment of debt, and accruals for non-recurring matters. The Company uses these measures to evaluate the comparability of the Company's ongoing operational results and trends and believes these measures provide useful information to investors for analysis of the Company's fundamental business on a recurring basis.\n\nNet debt: Net debt is calculated as the total principal amount of outstanding senior notes plus amounts drawn on the revolving credit facility less cash and cash equivalents (also referred to as total funded debt). The Company uses net debt as a measure of financial position and believes this measure provides useful additional information to investors to evaluate the Company's capital structure and financial leverage.\n\nNet debt-to-Adjusted EBITDAX: Net debt-to-Adjusted EBITDAX is calculated as Net Debt (defined above) divided by Adjusted EBITDAX (defined above) for the trailing twelve-month period (also referred to as \"leverage ratio\" or \"Adjusted EBITDAX multiple\"). A variation of this calculation is a financial covenant under the Company's Credit Agreement. The Company and the investment community may use this metric in understanding the Company's ability to service its debt and identify trends in its leverage position. The Company reconciles the two non-GAAP measure components of this calculation.\n\nPost-hedge: Post-hedge is calculated as the average realized price after the effects of commodity net derivative settlements. The Company believes this metric is useful to management and the investment community to understand the effects of commodity net derivative settlements on average realized price.\n\nSOURCE SM Energy Company"
