        "text": "*Originally published on May 4, 2023.\n\nFrom recent clashes over pensions to the storming of the Bastille in 1789, France is known for its history of protest and resistance.\n\n\"Paris has been considered a centre of revolution since at least the French Revolution of 1789. And that atmosphere of urban unrest, people taking to the streets... to express their opposition to the state or to various other things that are happening by heading into the streets in the thousands — that is a longstanding tradition,\" said Roxanne Panchasi, who teaches French history and culture at Simon Fraser University in B.C. \"\n\nMusic also plays an important role in French culture, right down to how it's reflected in the French national anthem.\n\nPanchasi describes how five well-loved French tunes embody and explain the spirit of French protest.\n\nLes Chant des Partisans\n\nLes Chant des Partisans was an anthem for the French Resistance. The tune was originally broadcast by the BBC, and the lyrics were written in London by French exiles then smuggled into occupied France by the Royal Air Force.\n\n\"The higher-ups and people throughout the French Resistance were really aware of the power of song to unite people. Like a national anthem, but in this case, a national anthem that came from exile,\" said Panchasi.\n\n\"It was that sound in its simplicity, that kind of militaristic vibe, but it also was very easy for it to become the most recognizable tune associated with the resistance.\"\n\nAfter the war, the song remained a symbol of the Resistance, and by extension, France itself.\n\n\"People will sing working-class songs from the early 20th century. They'll come back to French revolutionary songs from the late 18th, early 19th century. So there is this kind of habit of using songs as a form of protest,\" said Panchasi.\n\nLe déserteur by Boris Vian\n\n\"The first time [Le déserteur] was performed was the day of France's defeat in Vietnam in May of 1954. It's an imagined soldier's response to his conscription letter, of being called up but he doesn't want to go. He writes a letter to the president. So the song is in the form of a letter about how he doesn't want to kill people, and he's decided to desert,\" Panchasi explained.\n\n\"in this case, it's the resistance against participating in a colonial war. The song was then banned from the radio after 1954, during the entire period of the Algerian War.\"\n\nIt wasn't until the end of the Algerian War in 1962 that the song, Le déserteur could be played on the radio.\n\nThe song was also used in other protest movements around the world. For example, a cover version from Joan Baez was adopted for protests against American involvement in the Vietnam War.\n\nIl est cinq heures, Paris e s'éveille by Jacques Dutronc\n\nOriginally released as a rollicking tune about the beauty of Paris in the morning, the song, Il est cinq heures, Paris e s'éveille was taken up by students in the protests of May, 1968.\n\n\"It's morning in Paris. And it touches on all of these different landmarks and places across the city. But it became this anthem for the eruption of student and worker protests in May for several weeks because it's the song about Paris waking up,\" said Panchasi.\n\nThe title of the song, Paris Awakens, was easily adopted by the protesters as a call for social change.\n\n\"On the barricades and in the streets. They'd sing the song. The events of May, as they were called in France, erupted really just a few weeks before the song was released.\"\n\n\"May '68, even though it went to the end of June, is one explosive moment where millions of people end up on strike in France, workers throughout the country. It's a habit of political expression, a sense of popular ownership of public space. And having that right to criticize, to take on the government, to tear the government down sometimes. It's happening right now as we speak.\"\n\nQu'est-ce qu'on attend by Suprême NTM\n\nThis song from French rap group Suprême NTM translates to \"What are we waiting for?\" and addresses feelings of rage and disillusionment from racial minorities living in the suburbs of Paris.\n\n\"The song begins with a promotion for these massive suburban buildings that were built to accommodate large communities, especially of immigrants and poor people in the suburbs.\"\n\nPanchasi explains that riots and unrest in these areas have contributed to political strife over French culture and immigration.\n\n\"I think the extremes of contemporary French politics have definitely been tied to these perceived social ills, to the perceived threats to the French nation and French identity, to threats that have been understood as threats to French secularism and Republican values. And the music kind of expresses some of that.\"\n\nBalance ton quoi by Angèle\n\nAngèle's 2018 hit is less of a protest song, but it's definitely connected to a moment of resistance.\n\nThe French version of the hashtag #MeToo was \"#BalanceTonPorc, or \"squeal on your pig.\"\n\n\"The Angèle song was very popular in Belgium, very popular in France... some of the lyrics refer to her being told that she's really smart for a beautiful woman being underestimated in various ways, being harassed in different ways, being mistreated, not being treated as an equal because she's a woman.\"\n\nA unique element of the MeToo movement in France was a small backlash from people who felt it was in opposition to French sexual values.\n\n\"This was seen as the introduction of a foreign morality into French relations.\"\n\nThere are more songs mentioned on our IDEAS podcast that highlight the tensions, myths, and memories of France through the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\n*This episode was produced by Matthew Lazin-Ryder."
