        "text": "Introduction\n\n2This article demonstrates the ways in which the British state’s initial interest in ensuring ‘public control’ of broadcasting in the ‘national interest’ in the 1920s shifted to the more familiar ethos of ‘public service’, and the ways in which that ethos became reinterpreted and increasingly marginalised over time, ultimately becoming incorporated into the wider, more competition-friendly framework of the ‘public interest’. The final section also shows the ways in which the paradigm has continued to shift more recently, with an increasing focus on achieving ‘public purposes’ and ‘public value’.\n\nBroadcasting Regulation in the UK\n\n13But it is interesting to look closely at the ways in which terms such ‘public service’ and ‘public interest’ are used in the documents that set out how the broadcasting institutions and sector are to be regulated. Indeed, the increasing preference for the term ‘public interest’ (and more recently, ‘public value’) constitutes a shift towards a more commercial outlook, wherein the role of ‘public service’ broadcasting is increasingly diminished and reconstituted in terms of market failure.\n\n15Examining the ways in which such concepts have been reconfigured throughout the history of broadcasting regulation, however, this article offers a way of understanding their significance in terms of long-term, ongoing and unresolved problematisations, and questions the extent to which we can clearly distinguish between social and economic ‘paradigms’ or perspectives, focusing on the ongoing reconfiguration of the terms ‘public control’, ‘public service’, ‘public interest’ and, more recently, ‘public value’.\n\nA New Paradigm? Public Purposes and Public Value\n\nConclusion\n\n35This article has demonstrated the evolving rationale for broadcasting regulation in the UK, from an initial concern to balance public control with private enterprise, through changing interpretations and imbrications of public service and public interest, to the more recent privileging of public value. So, while the commercial PSBs are currently conflated with purely commercial TV, and the BBC explicitly linked with citizenship, the BBC-citizenship nexus remains framed within the same logic of market competition. While it is independently regulated in terms of the public interest, which is already a compromise of commercial, consumer sovereignty and public service perspectives, as well as a balance between this multiple perspective and its impact on the market, it is also prone to tertiary regulation by the competition regulator, which seeks to balance PSB with a competitive market. Competition and the market are therefore protected via three levels of BBC regulation: within the government’s policy approach to the ‘public interest’ (a balance between PSB and the wider market), the BBC Trust’s approach to testing ‘public value’ (which is always-already a balance between the ‘public interest’ and ‘market impact’) and Ofcom’s additional ‘market impact’ assessments. Despite the continued rhetorical foregrounding of the ‘publicness’ of the BBC, therefore, the regulatory approach to the institution is better understood in terms of the slow rise of ‘competition’ as the predominant guiding principle."
