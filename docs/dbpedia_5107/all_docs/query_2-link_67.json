        "text": "Deutschlandradio will close down its medium-wave (MW) transmitters in Germany on December 31. The shutdown of the seven transmitters marks the end of German-language programming transmitted from Germany in that part of the spectrum.\n\nOn the same day medium-wave Radio France MW transmitters will go dark. The transmitters shutting down are associated with France Info, France Blue RCFM, and France Blue Elsass.\n\nRadio France and Deutschlandradio both said listener numbers have dwindled significantly, and the affected services will shift to FM, digital, and Internet broadcast outlets.\n\nMW in Europe is approximately analogous to the AM broadcast band in the US."
