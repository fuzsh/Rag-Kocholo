        "meta_description": "Eleanor Roosevelt wrote books, thousands of newspaper and magazine articles and was a regular broadcaster. Among the radio programs she hosted, and appeared on, were several for the Voice of America. While she was a US delegate to the United Nations in Paris in 1951 and 1952, Mrs. Roosevelt broadcast a series of weekly radio commentaries aimed at explaining to families in France and other French-speaking countries the workings of the UN and to urge Europeans to work together for peace. These weekly talks generated (as did all Mrs. Roosevelt’s broadcasts) a great deal of letters from the public: usually either extremely favorable or vehemently opposed to the views she expressed. The former First Lady saw the role of the VOA as fundamental to “spread[ing] the understanding of the value of our way of life and of our type of government.”  This paper explores the connection between Eleanor Roosevelt and the official US radio propaganda in Europe in the early Fifties and the extent to which American cultural diplomacy benefitted from her presence on the airwaves.",

        "text": "1In January 1952 one Frenchman was prompted by Eleanor Roosevelt’s broadcasts on the French National Network and Voice of America to send the former First Lady a poem:\n\n2When the radio broadcasts your voice,\n\n3The whole country hastens to hear your words.\n\n4Because you have the gift to dispel doubt\n\n5That sometimes haunts our soul.\n\nUS International broadcasting and the early Cold War\n\n10It is a curious thing that just at this time Congress should want to silence the State Department's radio program, the Voice of America…\n\n11One grows to feel that our representatives in Congress are willing to give money for military opposition to Communism, but are not willing to give money to the spread of intellectual understanding of democracy. Yet if we do not want to see our sons go off to war again, we must spread the understanding of the value of our way of life and of our type of government…\n\n12[I]f we stop talking to the rest of the world, we cannot even tell them what our achievements have been, nor can we explain the reasons for the positions we take.\n\n13Mrs. Roosevelt also used her domestic radio programs to emphasize how international radio could act as a social force for good. In the January 26, 1949 edition of theEleanor & Anna Roosevelt Program, Mrs. Roosevelt told her listeners on the ABC network about a VOA program she had just completed in remembrance of her late husband.\n\n15She went on to dismiss fears voiced by several representatives in Congress and the American people about paying for propaganda. American listeners ought to think of Voice of America broadcasts as advertising, she argued. If it was perfectly natural for American consumers to accept commercial advertising, then they should also approve of propaganda which in her mind was a much needed chance to tell the truth:\n\n19Sarnoff: [W]e must do more than merely tell the story of America itself. We must tell the big truth about the big lie. What we need to do is to have counter propaganda first, that is, to dissect the lives that the communists are telling wherever they have facilities to tell them. If truth is incapable of overtaking untruth, then there’s something seriously wrong with our whole structure of life but I am confident that the truth will prevail. It must prevail […]\n\n20Roosevelt: In your testimony General […] [y]ou said that no matter how good our message may be, nobody can listen to it unless we furnish the facilities with which to transmit it. My question is, do you think our facilities are extensive enough and strong enough to be heard throughout the world?\n\n21Sarnoff: No, Mrs. Roosevelt, I do not think that the facilities of the Voice of America are sufficient, but I am glad that Congress recently acted favorably on the President’s recommendation to appropriate 57 million dollars for the Voice of America. As a result I am hopeful that the State department can now do a more comprehensive job.\n\nThe USA and France\n\n29June 8 Feature. 22 minutes on American economic situation. “Well done for Americans, not good for Frenchmen.”\n\n31June 26 program. Raymond Swing’s political “commentary does not carry sufficient weight […] he seemed to forget completely that France was also engaged in the Far East.”\n\nEleanor Roosevelt commentaries 1951-52\n\nSunday November 18, 1951\n\n35In this first commentary, Mrs. Roosevelt’s style is a simple one, with mainly short sentences. She frequently uses the inclusive first person ‘we’ to denote to her audience that they share a common cause, i.e. to “work at building peace”. The most vivid and effective style figure in this particular talk is the metaphor comparing peace to a vulnerable plant, which Eleanor Roosevelt employs to make clear the abstract concept of peace:\n\n37The verbs that accompany the metaphor “cultivate, protect, grow” not only form a climax in themselves, but also add to the metaphor’s persuasive power by suggesting that peace will have a chance to blossom if all nations of the world work together on tending the jointly owned garden that is the globe. She extends the metaphor by going on to contrast delicate plants with weeds and by alluding to her own experiences of gardening appears to imply that she – just as other Americans who desire peace - knows what she is talking about:\n\n38 Like most Americans, I have a garden. I know that nothing can really grow if the soil has not been cultivated, ploughed, and fertilized. Nothing grows in a poor soil. After the war, Europe’s soil was poor. We know then that a lasting peace could not grow from the acrid soil of human misery, among the shambles of war, in the cold shade of despair.\n\n39By using inclusive language and metaphors to explain abstract concepts like peace, Mrs. Roosevelt hoped to to achieve a favorable reaction from the audience to her, the US delegation and the message.\n\nDecember 16, 1951\n\n40Mrs. Roosevelt uses the stylistic device of anticipation in this commentary to talk about the daily correspondence received by all UN delegates as a way to refute the Soviet argument that America does not desire peace:\n\n41Certain correspondents send me criticism because, according to them, sometimes I judge severely my colleagues from the delegations from countries of the East.\n\n42They say to me: “Why don’t you carry out the policy of the extended hand?” To this I will reply: “Yes, but it is necessary that two hands be stretched out at the same time.” I have very often made this gesture. I found myself before people who do not dare to answer. I don’t think that they are afraid of us. They are afraid of themselves.\n\n43At times I should like to exchange a few words with a delegate whose views I do not share and who does not agree with me. But as soon as the conversation has begun, the other members of the delegation rush up and form a block.\n\n44She then chooses to focus on one particular letter she received which had been signed by 21 different people from La Plaine Montferrand. By stressing that these ordinary French people speak for themselves and do not engage in propaganda, she contrasts their genuineness and right of self-expression and critical thinking with the dishonesty and group-think of the Soviet delegates.\n\n45They honestly say what they have on their minds, without making any propaganda. They speak for themselves, not for a party or a foreign power. They speak without bitterness and I understand them well when they say: “We are terribly worried. We have known two wars and though our suffering is not yet alleviated nor our ruins rebuilt, there is already talk of a Third World War which would end in the destruction of humanity. You are the Organization of the United Nations on which we rely to maintain peace.”\n\n46Her reply to these writers is that “peace demands of us great effort and great sacrifices” […] Will we in the United Nations be worthy of your trust? I certainly hope so. We must be.” She then turns to the radio listeners as a whole with a direct message to those who might share the letter writers’ concerns: “hold firm to your will for peace; and make sure that peace is safeguarded by deeds and not merely by words.”\n\n47 The French communist newspaper, L’Humanité, which had been critical of Mrs. Roosevelt’s previous commentaries, was particularly enraged by the December 16 broadcast. It accused France of being partial to the US by not offering other delegations the opportunity of taking to the airwaves.\n\n49The editorial twice uses the phrase “embarrassed” to describe Mrs. Roosevelt’s attitude during what it calls her “obliged” reply to the people who have written to ask about peace. The tone of indignation is palpable when it accuses Mrs. Roosevelt of insincerity and piety:\n\n50Mrs. Roosevelt continues by insinuating that those who write to ask for an understanding with the East are speaking “for a party” or “for a foreign power” (as if she has a right to complain about that!) […]As a matter of fact, there is not one word in all her sermon about the five-power pact.\n\nFebruary 3, 1952\n\n51This final commentary in the series, which is slightly longer than the earlier ones, is not just a farewell to her French listeners, but used by Mrs. Roosevelt as an opportunity to defend her decision to “talk to you in your homes…on your network” and to launch a vociferous attack on the Soviet delegate Andrey Vishinsky. She shows a sense of American exceptionalism when she talks about the role that has been thrust upon the USA:\n\n52In the field [of nuclear disarmament] we are doubtless more perfectionist than the Soviets […] My country has been selected by destiny to carry at this time a heavy burden of responsibility. I am aware that new and thankless tasks will be ours to perform. We must accept them with pride. It is our duty to inspire confidence and assist the peoples of the world to recovery […] I believe that today, more than ever, that to quote “you have nothing to fear but fear itself.”\n\n53Eleanor Roosevelt fully understood what doing one’s duty meant as she herself had been the prime example of someone who had done exactly that throughout her career. Now it was her duty on behalf of the US to inspire the world and to carry on the legacy of her husband Franklin whom she quoted in the commentary’s final sentence. She for one, was ready - as Koestler had urged - to play the part that history had cast upon the United States.\n\nReactions to VOA commentaries\n\n56 “Every time I listen to you I feel more deeply moved by your sincerity and your ardent desire to convince your listeners. No Frenchman can listen to you without expressing his deep gratitude. (Mr. F.L. retired)”,\n\n57others accused her of deceit: “You know full well, Madame, that the USSR does not intend to attack us… (A group of listeners...Rhone)”\n\n58or cast aspersions on what the writer considered ER’s lack of appropriate female behavior:\n\n59Although I am getting used to the cynical lies of the Voice of America I never would have believed that a woman, even an American woman, would dare side with the American warmongers…You dare speak of the Rights of Man while you emprison Communists and lynch negroes. (P.B. Sete, Harault)\n\n60The official view of USIS was that the commentaries were a resounding success, thanks entirely to the ER’s ability to speak plainly, as voiced by USIE Regional Representative Charles Hulten in a letter to Edward W. Barratt, the Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs:\n\nConclusion\n\n65Besides her official diplomatic position as a member of the US delegation to the UN and as chair of the Human Rights Commission, she deftly played the role of cultural diplomat and expertly used the media to aid her performance. Radio, in particular, was one of the tools she chose to promote the UN and by extension the superiority of American perspectives on transatlantic relations. To her, the medium was essential in helping to reach the ordinary men and women who were part of her imagined community of free global citizens, together striving for peace and universal human rights. As she said,\n\n67Soft power was in her eyes a legitimate and necessary form of truthful propaganda, distinct from the lies and obstructions that formed the propaganda of the Communists. Her radio performances enabled ER to be a Cold War warrior and gave the US direct entry into the homes of those transatlantic audiences it wanted to ensure were on its side in the struggle for peace."
