        "text": "The secure and resilient broadband network for domestic security and emergency rescue forces\n\nThis pioneer project, led by France, is key to modernising domestic security forces which are still using narrowband technologies Today (Tetrapol). The RÃ©seau Radio du Futur will be a national, secure and high-speed (4G and 5G) priority mobile communication system, with a high level of resilience in order to guarantee the continuum of security and emergency rescue missions on a daily basis, including in the event of a crisis or major event.\n\nThe RRF intends to equip up to 300,000 users in the security and emergency rescue forces, such as the national gendarmerie, the national police force, firefighters and other civil security forces. It will allow these users to benefit from many new data-centred services, such as video, in particular (via MCVideo).\n\nWith the RRF, the Ministry of the Interior modernises the tools it provides the security and emergency rescue forces to help them carry out their daily missions as well as major diplomatic or sporting events. It represents a new chapter dedicated to improving increasingly complex interventions.\n\nRRF aims to equip up to 300,000 users of security and emergency forces such as the national gendarmerie, the national police, firefighters, civil security personnel and medical aid services emergency (SAMU).\n\nAt the 2023 National Firefighters Congress in France, Mr. Guillaume Lambert, prefect and responsible for the RRF program, gave us the pleasure of a visit to the Airbus stand to tell us more about the goals of the RRF. Watch this video below to learn more:\n\nFrance among the first countries to deploy such communication tools\n\nThe RRF deployment will make France one of the 5 pioneering countries providing its security and emergency forces with new generation communication tools. Among them, there is the United Kingdom with the ESN network and the ESMCP project, the United States with FirstNet, Finland with Virve 2.0 and South Korea with SafeNet.\n\nThe RRF is a major digital transformation project for the French Ministry of the Interior. It is part of the orientation and programming law of the Ministry of the Interior 2022-2027 (LOPMI) that will give to the State modern means to manage present and future crises (public order, delinquency and crime, civil security crises)."
