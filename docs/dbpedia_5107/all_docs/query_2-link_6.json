        "text": "Television is France's most popular medium. The flagship network, TF1, is privately-owned and public broadcaster France Televisions is funded from the TV licence fee and advertising revenue.\n\nSatellite and cable offer a proliferation of channels. Major pay-TV operator Canal+ is owned by media giant Vivendi. Digital terrestrial TV carries dozens of channels.\n\nFrance has a free press and more than 100 daily newspapers. Most of them are in private hands and are not linked to political parties.\n\nPublic Radio France serves a domestic audience and French overseas territories. Commercial radios, particularly RTL and Europe 1, command large audiences.\n\nFrance is a force in international broadcasting. Radio France Internationale is a leading outlet and its Arabic-language Monte Carlo Doualiya service broadcasts across the Middle East.\n\nGlobal news channel France 24 TV broadcasts in French, English and Arabic. It has said it aims to present \"a different point of view from the Anglo-Saxon world\".\n\nThere were 60 million internet users by December 2021, comprising 92% of the population (Internetworldstats.com). Around 76% of French people are active on social media (Gaasly,com 2021). Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat are the leading social networks."
