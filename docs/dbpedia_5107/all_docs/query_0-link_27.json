They moved to their own app Radio France, that doesn't work from Italy with Google devices, with Amazon's it's working perfectly..\n\nThey will be given or on sale soon.. Useless now, those paired nest minis\n\nHi Folks,\n\nThank you for posting. I'm sorry that your French radio doesn't show on your speaker; this could be frustrating, especially with your desired radio station that you've listened to before.\n\nHere is a good article you can check and troubleshoot the issue about listening to radio on your Google Nest Speaker.\n\nIf none of the options didn't work with you, please share feedback to address it better and work on an update soon.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nRegards,\n\nByron\n\nThank you Byron for your answer,\n\nBtw, it's not a single station that doesn't work anymore, it's all radio france stations (8 at least) , all french public service stations owned by french state: they stopped their agreement with TuneIn, because TuneIn with adding commercial before letting user listen to them..\n\nAs I already said the only workaround so far, using the RadioPlayer service, doesn't seem to work outside France, they told me they were looking forward with Google to solve/fix this in a few weeks, but I'm not buying that answer: if it might work it'd have already, if it doesn't now, why would it then..?"
