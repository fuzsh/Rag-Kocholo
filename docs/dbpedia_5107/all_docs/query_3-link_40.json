        "text": "Old and new forms of radio\n\nTerrestrial radio includes all technologies used to broadcast content with radio waves. The part of the radio industry that transmits radio over the terrestrial network through Frequency Modulation (FM) and Amplitude Modulation (AM) is generally referred to as traditional analogue radio. While AM and FM radio is considered older forms of radio, Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) is a newer form of radio, also broadcasting on the terrestrial network. Satellite Radio and Internet Radio are as well newer forms of linear radio, while Podcasts are usually referred to as Internet audio-on-demand.\n\nToday, despite the emergence of digital and Internet radio technologies, traditional FM radio is still widely used, although several countries, especially in Europe, have regular services on DAB. Norway has already shut down its nationwide FM network, and Switzerland plans to shut of FM frequencies by the end of 2024. Deployment plans of DAB networks vary from country to country and depends on considerations like government policy, available frequencies, market requirements, and economic and technical considerations.\n\nTypical arguments for DAB have been that it is cheaper to run, it can offer more radio services for the same bandwidth, and it is a more energy-efficient platform compared with FM. Also, the sound quality of DAB is considered better, as the broadcaster can select quality, from high-fidelity signals for music to low-fidelity signals for talk radio.\n\nSome of the arguments against DAB are the costs of a transition from FM to digital and that all FM radio devices must be replaced, which means a large investment for the consumer. DAB also uses higher frequencies than FM, therefore there may be a need to compensate with more transmitters to achieve the same coverage as a single FM transmitter.\n\nRegulation of radio spectrum\n\nThe radio spectrum is divided into different frequency bands with ranges from 3 hertz to 3,000 gigahertz. Internationally, the availability of radio-frequency bands is regulated by the United Nations agency for information and communication technologies, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).\n\nWhile the ITU is responsible for allocating radio spectrum frequency bands on an international level, in Europe, the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT) cooperate and coordinate between European countries and at a national level, the National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) are responsible for assigning the radio spectrum. This means that national radio spectrum is largely regulated on a national level, while ITU and CEPT are mostly concerned with technical parameters.\n\nRadio in the Nordic countries\n\nPublic service broadcasting is a global idea which has a strong tradition in the Nordic countries. It is a type of broadcasting that aims to serve the public interest, it is non-commercial, it is independent from the government or any political interests, and it is typically funded through public contributions such as taxes, licence fees, or grants.\n\nThe public service broadcasters in the Nordic region include Danmarks Radio (DR) in Denmark, Yleisradio (Yle) in Finland, Ríkisútvarpið (RÚV) in Iceland, Norsk rikskringkasting (NRK) in Norway, Sveriges Television (SVT), Sveriges Radio (SR), and Utbildningsradion (UR) in Sweden.\n\nThe Nordic public service radio channels were all established in the mid-1920s except in Iceland, which was established in 1930. Around 50 to 60 years later, commercial radio stations, financed through advertising revenue, were established in the Nordic countries. And since the beginning of the 21st century, with broadband Internet, online radio and podcasts have become a new way of producing radio outside the terrestrial network, and which does not require permission from media authorities."
