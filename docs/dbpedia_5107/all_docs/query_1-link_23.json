        "text": "Purpose and Objectives\n\nThe Global Task Force exists to defend the values and the interests of Public Media.\n\nThose values: access, accuracy, accountability, creativity, impartiality, independence and high standards of journalism. All these underpin an informed and healthy democracy. Many of these are under assault by various forces, both private and public.\n\nPublic service media historically evolved and operated principally at the national level. Now operating in an increasingly globalised media space, public service media must develop a coordinated global response mechanism in order to defend and promote core values.\n\nComposition\n\nThe GTF is a deliberately small group of seven Public Service Media leaders spanning continents and leading organisations that have long histories of serving their national audiences and working together as part of the global public media family. These respected leaders occupy a role that places them at a focal point between their organizations, the citizens they serve, and governments. This makes them uniquely placed to discuss, reflect and respond to issues concerning public service media, from press freedom to the disruption of entertainment programming caused by private transnational streaming companies.\n\nOperations and Scope of Activities\n\nThe size of this group allows for tight connections so that these leaders can respond quickly with a united stand when Public Service Media comes under pressure. The GTF is global, multilingual and has minimal bureaucracy and infrastructure. It’s leaders working together and acting fast, when needed.\n\nThe GTF is alerted to issues and situations by the Public Media Alliance (PMA), European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and other trusted partners. Responses are decided by the GTF on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe Public Media Alliance is the Secretariat of the GTF.\n\nThe Big Night In\n\nThe Big Night In will celebrate the acts of kindness, humour and the spirit of hope and resilience that is keeping the nation going during the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic with a special night of programming for BBC One. This is the first time the BBC’s biggest charitable partners, BBC Children in Need and Comic Relief, have come together. The live show features some of the country’s favourite famous faces for light relief and entertainment, while celebrating and rewarding those going the extra mile to support their communities at this time.\n\n#OnVousRéspond\n\nTo answer questions about the coronavirus, franceinfo launched a new initiative: #OnVousRépond. With overwhelming available information on the pandemic, franceinfo continues to engage with its digital users, viewers and listeners, and provides answers to their questions about the virus and its impact on their daily lives. Every day, from 6 a.m. to midnight, franceinfo’s digital team responds to questions they receive. When needed, they also call upon doctors, experts, public authorities or other specialists to provide clear and verified answers. #OnVousRépond also provides content to franceinfo’s radio and television channels, its newscasts at 1 p.m. and 8 p.m. on France 2 and its newsletter sent several times a week.\n\nCoronavirus Podcast\n\nRNZ’s daily Corona Virus podcast on the Covid-19 Coronavirus is hosted by RNZ National presenter, Indira Stewart providing the latest news on the COVID-19 Coronavirus and its impact on New Zealanders. The programme shares stories from everyday Kiwis affected by the virus and uses RNZ’s own VoxPop App technology which allows direct engagement with subscribers through real time questions and answers. After launching it went straight to #1 on the Apple Podcast charts and has stayed at #6 or higher in the weeks since. And, Apple, Spotify and others are promoting it as a trusted source of information in their Covid-19 listings."
