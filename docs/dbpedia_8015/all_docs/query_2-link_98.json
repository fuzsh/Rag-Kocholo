        "text": "London — U.K. health authorities began rolling out the first doses of a widely tested and independently reviewed COVID-19 vaccine on Tuesday, starting a global immunization program that is expected to gain momentum as more serums win approval. The first shot came early in the morning at one of a network of hospital hubs around the country where the initial phase of the U.K. program will be rolled out on what has been dubbed \"V-Day.\"\n\nPublic health officials are asking the public to be patient because only those who are most at risk from the new coronavirus will be vaccinated in the early stages. Medical staff will contact people to arrange appointments, and most will have to wait until next year before there is enough vaccine to expand the program.\n\nWhite House rejects report that it declined to buy more Pfizer vaccine doses\n\n\"I think there's every chance that we will look back on ... (Tuesday) as marking a decisive turning point in the battle against coronavirus,\" said Simon Stevens, the CEO of England's National Health Service.\n\nThe first recipient was grandmother Margaret Keenan, who turns 91 next week. She received the shot at University Hospital Coventry at 6:31 a.m.\n\nKeenan said she felt \"so privileged to be the first person vaccinated against COVID-19.\"\n\n\"It's the best early birthday present I could wish for because it means I can finally look forward to spending time with my family and friends in the New Year after being on my own for most of the year,\" she said.\n\nThe second injection went to a man named William Shakespeare, an 81-year-old who hails from Warwickshire, the county where the bard was born, prompting a likely-well planned response online and in the press.\n\n\"Taming of the flu: William Shakespeare becomes second person to get Covid vaccine,\" quipped the headline from Britain's Independent newspaper.\n\nIn a tweet, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson thanked the country's health service, the developers of the vaccine, the volunteers who helped prove it safe and effective through trials, and \"everyone who has been following the rules to protect others.\"\n\n\"We will beat this together,\" Johnson said.\n\nThe first 800,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine in the U.K. are going to people over 80 who are either hospitalized or already have outpatient appointments scheduled, along with nursing home workers. Others will have to wait their turn, but all vaccinations will be provided free of charge via Britain's National Health Service.\n\nAmong those older Britons scheduled to get vaccinated is Hari Shukla, of Newcastle.\n\n\"When I received the telephone call, I was very excited I got the opportunity of joining in and taking part in that,″ he said. \"So we are very very pleased and happy and excited as well.″\n\nBuckingham Palace refused to comment on reports that Queen Elizabeth II, 94, and her 99-year-old husband, Prince Philip, would be vaccinated as a public example of its safety.\n\n\"Our goal is totally to protect every member of the population, Her Majesty, of course, as well,\" Dr. June Raine, chief executive of Britain's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, told the BBC.\n\nPublic health officials elsewhere are watching Britain's rollout as they prepare for the unprecedented task of vaccinating billions of people to end a pandemic that has killed more than 1.5 million. While the U.K. has a well-developed infrastructure for delivering vaccines, it is geared to administer them to groups such as school children or pregnant women, not the whole population.\n\nThe U.K. is getting a head start on the project after British regulators on Dec. 2 gave emergency authorization to the vaccine produced by U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and Germany's BioNTech. U.S. and European Union authorities are also reviewing the vaccine, alongside rival products developed by U.S. biotechnology company Moderna, and a collaboration between Oxford University and drugmaker AstraZeneca.\n\nOn Saturday, Russia began vaccinating thousands of doctors, teachers and others at dozens of centers in Moscow with its Sputnik V vaccine. That program is being viewed differently because Russia authorized use of Sputnik V last summer after it was tested in only a few dozen people.\n\nRussia still lacks significant trial data on older patients, and has only made its vaccine available to Moscow residents between the ages of 18 and 60.\n\nThe first shipments of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine were delivered to a selected group of U.K. hospitals on Sunday.\n\nAt one of those facilities, Croydon University Hospital, south of London, staff members couldn't so much as touch the vials, but they were thrilled to just have them in the building.\n\n\"I'm so proud,\" said Louise Coughlan, joint chief pharmacist at Croydon Health Services NHS Trust.\n\nThe vaccine can't arrive soon enough for the U.K., which has more than 61,000 COVID-19-related deaths - more than any other country has reported in Europe. The U.K. has more than 1.7 million cases.\n\nThe 800,000 doses are only a fraction of what is needed. The government is targeting more than 25 million people, or about 40% of the population, in the first phase of its vaccination program, which gives first priority to those who are highest risk from the disease.\n\nAfter those over 80 and nursing home workers, the program will be expanded as the supply increases, with the vaccine offered roughly on the basis of age groups, starting with the oldest people.\n\nIn England, the vaccine will be delivered at 50 hospital hubs in the first wave of the program, with more hospitals expected to offer it as the rollout ramps up. Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales are making their own plans under the U.K.'s system of devolved administration.\n\nBritish officials have made it clear the vaccine will not be mandatory for anyone. As residents become eligible, they are to be notified by their doctor's office or the National Health Service and urged to schedule an appointment for inoculation."
