        "text": "The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority has provisionally found that U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, along with a second company called Flynn, broke competition law after raising the price of the epilepsy medicine phenytoin sodium.\n\nThe CMA announced today that the two companies exploited a regulatory loophole and used their dominant market position to unfairly hike the drug's price way above previous cost. They did this through de-branding phenytoin sodium so that it become a generic that no longer fell under branded pharmaceutical rules.\n\nWhile branded pharmaceuticals usually enjoy greater protection from competition, in this case, \"Pfizer and Flynn were the dominant suppliers of the drug,\" the regulator wrote. The result was that the National Health Service \"had no choice but to pay unfairly high prices for this vital medicine,\" it added, noting that NHS spending on the drug rose from £2 million in 2012 to £50 million in 2013.\n\nFor over four years, Pfizer hiked its prices from 780 percent to 1,600 percent above previous levels. It then supplied the drug to Flynn, which sold it to wholesalers and pharmacies with a mark-up of 2,300 percent to 2,600 percent, the CMA explained.\n\nThe provisional finding follows a 2016 CMA decision to fine the companies over breaking competition rules, which the companies appealed. Pfizer and Flynn can now respond with their own objections before the CMA makes a final decision.\n\nHouthi rebels and the EU make your coffee more expensive\n\nWe probably don’t need to tell you that your iced latte is now pricier — but do you know why?\n\nA killjoy’s guide to how the financial turmoil might screw up your life\n\nWhat could possibly go wrong?\n\nEurope’s €10 trillion gamble\n\nFrom Athens to Berlin, governments are coalescing around an idea to turbocharge the economy. If successful, it could be transformative ― but it’s a big if.\n\nEurope’s manufacturing slump shows no signs of ending\n\nManufacturing in Europe’s industrial heartland weakened further in July, confirming the worst fears of EU leaders concerned by the direction that the bloc’s economy is taking.
