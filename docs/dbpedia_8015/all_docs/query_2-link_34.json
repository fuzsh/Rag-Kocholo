        "text": "THE UK has approved the use of the Covid vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech and Brits could get the jab in a matter of days.\n\nBut who owns Pfizer and where is the company based? Here is everything you'll need to know...\n\n⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news & updates\n\nWho owns Pfizer?\n\nPfizer is a Pharmaceutical corporation that was founded in New York City in 1849 by Charles Pfizer and Charles F. Erhart.\n\nThe company does not have one specific owner but rather owned by the people who make up its share registry.\n\nAccording to Yahoo Finance, 27.6 per cent of the corporation's shares are owned by the general public while 72.3 per cent of its shares are owned by institutions.\n\nWhere is the Pfizer vaccine made?\n\nPfizer and BioNTech reported final trial results on November 18 which showed its vaccine was 95 per cent effective in preventing Covid-19, with no major safety concerns.\n\nPreviously Pfizer said the vaccine will be produced in BioNTech’s German manufacturing sites, as well as in Pfizer’s manufacturing site in Belgium for European countries.\n\nIn November the companies reached an agreement with the European Commission to supply 200m doses of their vaccine.\n\nBritain has already ordered 40m doses, meaning 20million people can be vaccinated as two doses need to be given.\n\nWhere is Pfizer located?\n\nPfizer's headquarters is located in New York, USA.\n\nThe company has five locations, working within commercial business, research and development (R&D), manufacturing, packaging and distribution operations, across the UK.\n\nIts UK commercial headquarters are located in Walton Oaks in Surrey and it also has centres in Sandwich, Kent, Havant, Cambridge and Hurley in Berkshire.\n\nWho is the CEO of Pfizer?\n\nThe current CEO of Pfizer is Albert Bourla.\n\nMr Bourla has been working with Pfizer for more than 25 years and has held several senior global positions across a range of markets in the business.\n\nPrior to his position as CEO, Mr Bourla acted as COO in 2018 and served as Group President of Pfizer Innovative Health from 2016 to 2017.\n\nMr Bourla began his career in Pfizer in the Animal Health Division in Greece after receiving a Ph.D in Veterinary Medicine from the Veterinary School of Aristotle University.\n\nWhat is the new Covid vaccine and who will get it first?\n\nThe new vaccine developed by Pfizer is a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine.\n\nConventional vaccines are produced using weakened forms of the virus, but mRNAs use only the virus's genetic code.\n\nAn mRNA vaccine is injected into the body where it enters cells and tells them to create antigens.\n\nThese antigens are recognised by the immune system and prepare it to fight coronavirus.\n\nThe vaccine has been tested on 43,500 people in six countries and no safety concerns have been raised.\n\nPfizer plans to apply to the US regulator the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency approval to use the vaccine by the end of November.\n\nIt will also seek approval from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK.\n\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has examined data on who suffers the worst outcomes from coronavirus and who is at highest risk of death.\n\nNew regulations allowing more healthcare workers to administer flu and potential Covid-19 vaccines have also been introduced by the Government.\n\nIts interim guidance, which assumes the jab is safe and effective in all groups, says the order of priority should be:\n\nOlder adults in a care home and care home workers\n\nAll those aged 80 and over and health and social care workers, though they may move up the list\n\nAnyone 75 and over\n\nPeople aged 70 and over\n\nAll those aged 65 and over\n\nHigh-risk adults under 65\n\nModerate-risk adults under 65\n\nAll those aged 60 and over\n\nAll those 55 and over\n\nAll those aged 50 and over\n\nThe rest of the population, with priority yet to be determined.\n\nThe JCVI said the prioritisation could change if the first jab were not deemed suitable for, or effective in, older adults.\n\nWhy can it only be made by Pfizer?\n\nThe Covid-19 has been developed by Pfizer and BioNtech and so they own the intellectual property of the vaccine.\n\nHowever, on November 10, pharmaceutical rival Eli Lilly And Co's have had an antibody treatment authorised by the FDA.\n\nThe antibody was approved for use in mild-to-moderate Covid-19 in adults and paediatric patients over the age of the 12.\n\nWhat other medicines and vaccines does Pfizer produce?\n\nPfizer has made many well-known drugs that are used by people every day.\n\nThe corporation's brands include Advil, Viagra, Xanax and include many consumer products including Chapstick.\n\nPfizer has had many triumphs including the discovery of citric acid as well as its mass production of penicillin and vitamin C."
