        "text": "Hamburg, Germany | Abingdon, UK - Evotec OAI AG, Hamburg, Germany (Neuer Markt: EVT), a partner for integrated high-value-added drug discovery to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, announced today that it has extended its long-term screening technology partnership with Pfizer (NYSE: PFE). This partnership, covering biology services, technology development and the delivery of screening systems, began in June 1999.\n\nUnder the terms of this new three-year agreement, Evotec OAI will provide Pfizer with additional and newly developed ultra-high-throughput screening (uHTS) instrumentation. In addition, Evotec OAI will develop certain technologies and biological assay systems as a service to Pfizer. The agreement has a potential value in excess of US-Dollar 25 million.\n\nIn 2000 Evotec OAI successfully delivered and implemented two EVOscreen® Mark II systems and integrated assay development stations to Pfizer's Groton and Sandwich sites. Now, Evotec OAI will transfer its newly developed Mark III platform as well as assay development devices (including the \"Opera\", Evotec OAI's confocal imaging reader for high-content cell analysis) to other Pfizer research sites. Evotec OAI will dedicate over 20 man years to further extend the capabilities of the EVOscreen® platform as well as to develop fluorescence-based biochemical and cellular assays for Pfizer's internal drug discovery programmes.\n\nAs part of this transaction, Pfizer will make an equity investment into Evotec Technologies GmbH, the affiliate of Evotec OAI focussed on technology development and instrumentation. This investment is an important first step in establishing Evotec Technologies GmbH as a standalone business. Further financial details of the collaboration were not disclosed.\n\n\"We are very proud that Pfizer chose to further integrate our technologies, instruments and expertise into Pfizer's drug discovery platform. We have delivered on our promises during a three year fruitful and mutual collaboration and are extremely happy to see the reward of hard work through the expansion of our long-term relationship. This ongoing commitment highlights the value of our world class screening and assay development expertise and distinguishes our EVOscreen® platform as an industry standard for miniaturised screening,\" said Dr Timm Jessen, Chief Scientific Officer of Evotec OAI.\n\nAbout Evotec OAI AG\n\nEvotec OAI offers a comprehensive range of high-value added services and products required to increase the efficiency and at the same time reduce the risk in the identification of new drugs. By integrating proprietary state-of-the-art technologies and processes in biology, chemistry and screening, the Company has established a unique position for all the critical elements in the drug discovery and development process - from target to clinical development. Due to its extensive know-how and experience Evotec OAI is the ideal partner for pharma and biotech companies world-wide. To date, Evotec OAI has completed over 1,200 projects with 150 companies, including all of the top 20 global pharmaceutical companies and major biotechs.\n\nThe Company employs more than 600 people, primarily at its two main sites at Hamburg in Germany and Abingdon in the UK. Subsidiaries are located in Europe and North America. In 2001 Evotec OAI achieved revenues of EUR 63.2 million. Evotec OAI shares are listed on the Neuer Markt of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange since November 1999 (NM: EVT).\n\nAbout Evotec Technologies GmbH\n\nEvotec Technologies GmbH (ET) is a newly formed subsidiary of Evotec OAI AG focused on technology development and instrumentation. As an innovative technology provider the company serves current and future needs of all life sciences serving end-users and industrial partners.\n\nWith a broad scientific knowledge base ET offers innovative solutions for complex life sciences applications. The company focuses on the seamless integration of hardware, software and bioware modules, combining cutting-edge technologies for measurement, miniaturisation and automation. To this end ET has available a unique set of validated core technologies which range from single molecule detection and cell processing to generic assays. ET's range of products include concepts, prototypes, modules and integrated systems, instruments, software, disposables and reagents. EVOscreen® Mark III, Evotec OAI's high-resolution uHTS system, represents only the most prominent example of solutions resulting from this approach. It has been successfully integrated into Novartis', GlaxoSmithKline's and Pfizer's drug discovery units.\n\nEvotec Technologies employs 80 people, primarily in Hamburg, Germany. Subsidiaries are located in Düsseldorf and Berlin."
