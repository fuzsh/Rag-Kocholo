        "text": "Pfizer\n\nNOTE: IAPO is in no way responsible for the content of the Industry Partner profiles. These have been produced using information provided by the Industry Partners.\n\nPfizer Inc is a leading research-based pharmaceutical company, providing a broad range of human and animal pharmaceuticals, as well as consumer products. Its innovative, value-added products improve the quality of life of people around the world and help them enjoy longer, healthier, and more productive lives. Pfizer products are available in more than 150 countries.\n\nWith 120,000 employees worldwide, Pfizer is also deeply engaged in the global community, donating hundreds of millions of dollars of medicines to treat AIDS patients in Africa, to eliminate blinding trachoma in the developing world and to expand drug access in the United States.\n\nSince its inception in 1953, the Pfizer Foundation has become one of the largest corporate giving organizations in the United States. Its mission is to promote access to quality health care, to nurture innovation and to support the community involvement of Pfizer colleagues. The Foundation is committed to strengthening the advocacy efforts of patient-based organizations as they seek to improve the quality of life for patients and their caregivers and advance health care policy.\n\nPfizer’s business is about saving and improving lives. Thus, it measures success not only by its financial results, but by its performance as a corporate citizen—and, in particular, by its ability to provide access to medicines for all who need them.\n\nCorporate citizenship and community involvement have been among Pfizer’s most cherished and deeply-rooted values since 1849, when co-founder Charles Pfizer supported organizations in Brooklyn that helped immigrants get a new start in America. Today, thousands of employees give generously of their time, talents and money to community organizations, while more than 1,700 Pfizer people volunteer in schools to share their passion about science and math.\n\nPfizer’s commitment to patients and pharmaceutical access extends back over half a century. During World War II, when Pfizer developed the first successful process to mass-produce penicillin, the company donated the new wonder drug both to U.S. soldiers and civilians with life-threatening diseases. In the 1950s, Pfizer helped support the development of polio vaccine and subsequently provided vaccine to the government at no profit.\n\nToday, Pfizer continues to build on this tradition of extending a helping hand through many programs. Examples include its Connection to Care, Sharing the Care and Share Card programs in the U.S., which ensure access to medicines and health information for those in need; the International Trachoma Initiative, which is aimed at the most prevalent treatable and curable cause of blindness in children and adults around the world; and the Diflucan Partnership Program, which is helping stem the HIV/AIDS crisis in developing countries.\n\nThese efforts reflect Pfizer’s belief that a fair and just society must never foster a second-tier health system that perpetuates social and economic inequities, and that all people deserve access to the highest-quality health care—including the best medicines—regardless of their ability to pay or their insurance status.\n\nPfizer is proud to help strive for a global voice for patients as an Industry Partner of the International Alliance of Patients’ Organizations."
