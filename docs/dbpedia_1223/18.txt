Company Overview

Britannia Industries Ltd stands as one of India’s oldest food product companies and holds a significant position in the country’s biscuit industry. While the majority of its revenue is generated from the biscuits segment, the company has expanded its presence into various other sectors, such as bread, dairy products, cakes, snacks, milkshakes, croissants, wafers, and rusks. Some of its prominent brands include Good Day, Marie Gold, Tiger, Nutri Choice, Milk Bikis, and others. Operating with a total of 23 factories (19 national and 4 international), Britannia also exports its products to over 79 countries spanning the Middle East, North America, Europe, Africa, and Southeast Asia.
