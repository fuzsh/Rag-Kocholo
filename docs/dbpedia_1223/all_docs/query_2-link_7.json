        "text": "In this article, I will take a quick look at Britannia Industries Limited’s (NSE:BRITANNIA) recent ownership structure – an unconventional investing subject, but an important one. Ownership structure of a company has been found to affect share performance over time. Since the effect of an active institutional investor with a similar ownership as a passive pension-fund can be vastly different on a company’s corporate governance and accountability of shareholders, investors should take a closer look at BRITANNIA’s shareholder registry.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Britannia Industries\n\nInstitutional Ownership\n\nWith an institutional ownership of 23.59%, BRITANNIA can face volatile stock price movements if institutions execute block trades on the open market, more so, when there are relatively small amounts of shares available on the market to trade However, as not all institutions are alike, such high volatility events, especially in the short-term, have been more frequently linked to active market participants like hedge funds. In the case of BRITANNIA, investors need not worry about such volatility considering active hedge funds don’t have a significant stake. However, we should dig deeper into BRITANNIA’s ownership structure and find out how other key ownership classes can affect its investment profile.\n\nInsider Ownership\n\nAn important group of shareholders are company insiders. Insider ownership has to do more with how the company is managed and less to do with the direct impact of the magnitude of shares trading on the market. Although individuals in BRITANNIA hold only a minor stake, given BRITANNIA is a large-cap company, it is relatively meaningful. This is a good sign for shareholders as the company’s executives and directors have their incentives directly linked to the company’s performance. It would also be interesting to check what insiders have been doing with their shareholding recently. Insider buying can be a positive indicator of future performance, but a selling decision can be simply driven by personal financial requirements.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nA big stake of 25.53% in BRITANNIA is held by the general public. This level of ownership gives retail investors the power to sway key policy decisions such as board composition, executive compensation, and potential acquisitions. This is a positive sign for an investor who wants to be involved in key decision-making of the company.\n\nPrivate Company Ownership\n\nAnother group of owners that a potential investor in BRITANNIA should consider are private companies, with a stake of 5.79%. While they invest more often due to strategic interests, an investment can also be driven by capital gains through share price appreciation. With this size of ownership in BRITANNIA, this ownership class can affect the company’s business strategy. As a result, potential investors should further explore the company’s business relations with these companies and find out if they can affect shareholder returns in the long-term.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nThe company’s high institutional ownership makes margin of safety a very important consideration to existing investors since long bull and bear trends often emerge when these big-ticket investors see a change in long-term potential of the company. This will allow investors to reduce the impact of non-fundamental factors, such as volatile block trading impact on their portfolio value. However, ownership structure should not be the only determining factor when you’re building an investment thesis for BRITANNIA. Instead, you should be evaluating company-specific factors such as the intrinsic valuation, which is a key driver of Britannia Industries’s share price.
