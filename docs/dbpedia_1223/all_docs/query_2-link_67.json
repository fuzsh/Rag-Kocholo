        "text": "The KnowTheChain methodology assesses companiesâ€™ efforts to address forced labor risks in their supply chains. It is based on the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and covers policy commitments, due diligence, and remedy. The methodology uses the ILO core labor standards (which cover the human rights that the ILO has declared to be fundamental rights at work: freedom of association, the right to collective bargaining, and the elimination of forced labor, child labor, and discrimination) as a baseline standard.\n\nLegend\n\nNot Met\n\nPartially Met\n\nMet\n\nNot Applicable\n\nSupplier Code of Conduct and Integration into Supplier Contracts\n\nThe company has a supplier code of conduct that requires suppliers to respect the ILO core labor standards, which include the elimination of forced labor; and integrates the ILO core labor standards into supplier contracts."
