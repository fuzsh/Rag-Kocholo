Consumer goods makers have seen steady demand for certain food items such as chocolates and biscuits, especially in urban areas, while prices of key raw materials including wheat, milk and sugar have eased, helping their bottomline. Britannia, which sells Jim Jam and NutriChoice biscuits, reported a consolidated net profit of 5.38 billion rupees ($64.5 million) for the three months ended March 31, compared with analysts' average estimate of 5.37 billion rupees, according to data from LSEG.",

The number of people affected could be similar to or slightly higher than the 4,000 employees Cisco laid off in February, and will likely be announced as early as Wednesday with the company's fourth-quarter results, said the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly. Reuters exclusively reported the job cut that San Jose, California-based Cisco announced in February, prior to the company announcing it.\n\nYahoo Finance Video\n\nThe stock market is 'pretty flawless' predictor of a recession: Expert\n\nRecent economic data and the market sell-off has sparked fears and questions about whether the US is in a recession or if a recession is in the near future. Wall Street Journal Chief Economics Commentator Greg Ip joins Yahoo Finance to discuss recession fears. \"The stock market matters, in so far as it's got a pretty flawless track record of predicting recessions...\" Ip says, \"I think pretty much every recession was preceded by a big drop in the stock market. The problem, of course, is that not every big drop in the stock market was followed by a recession. It does have false alarms.\" Ip adds that \"it's very hard to know exactly what we're in right now, but when I look at everything... it doesn't look yet like we have a recession in the cards.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

MicroStrategy executive chairman Michael Saylor (MSTR) joins Market Domination to discuss the movement and why he is so bullish on the cryptocurrency. \"Bitcoin is the only truly global capital market in the world, and so if you think about the volatility of it, the volatility is the price that you pay in order to create billions of dollars of credit and liquidity at your fingertips, all times, everywhere for everybody. And so on Sunday night, all the other capital markets are closed. Bitcoin is the only capital market that's functioning. What you saw over the past week is that it's functioning really, really well. And that is the secret to the success of the asset class,\" Saylor tells Yahoo Finance. Despite its dip earlier in the week, Saylor sees the volatility as a sign of high energy. He adds, \"The future is digital, right? There's a race to own cyberspace. That being the case, empires are built on productive property, and they're defended by firepower, naval power, air power, nuclear power, and digital power. Bitcoin's digital power. You want bitcoin. You want to own cyberspace... It's a good investment.\" He notes that bitcoin has appreciated 55% a year over the past four years, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) is appreciating 13% and bonds are depreciating 5%. He closes, \"We're buying all the time. We're buying every quarter. We're buying the lows, the mids, the highs. You know, I'll be buying the top forever because I'm expecting bitcoin will continue to appreciate as digital capital.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.
