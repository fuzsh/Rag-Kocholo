        "text": "PTI\n\nUpdated On Nov 23, 2016 at 08:00 AM IST\n\nBENGALURU: Bakery and dairy products major Britannia Industries Ltd, which is aiming to double its turnover in next four to five years, would expand offshore presence as it aspires to become a global company.\n\nBritannia, which would primarily target the developing countries, is expecting that exports would contribute around 14-15 per cent of its turnover in next 4-5 years.\n\nBesides this, Britannia would invest a capex of Rs 300-350 crore every year for the next 3-4 years to ramp up its capacity and roll out new categories which would be funded internally.\n\n\"In the next 5 years, I would see this going from eight per cent to 14-15 per cent,\" said Britannia Industries Managing Director Varun Berry.\n\nAsked about the region which would lead growth, Berry said: \"It would all be developing countries. We are not going to developed countries as it does not make sense.\"\n\nPresently, export contributes eight per cent to the turnover of the company.\n\nPart of the strategy would be expanding to countries which have similar business environment as India. It may also go for acquisitions if it gets the right candidate.\n\nBritannia, which is currently limited to bakery and dairy segment, would venture into new categories to be a complete food company.\n\n\"Our first step would be the countries, which has environment similar to ours. The strategy would be to seed in our products in these countries, establish a little bit of space and then start to think of a manufacturing facility there. In the meantime, if some good opportunities (acquisitions) comes up in some countries, then we would look at that as well,\" Berry said.\n\nHe further added: \"Today, we are not a food company. We are broadly a bakery company only which also does dairy. We truly want to be a food company as we go forward. Its our vision to make Britannia not just an Indian food company but a global food company. We want our footprint across the globe and made some move in that direction and a lot more would be coming in future.\"\n\nBritannia clocked a revenue of Rs 7,947.90 crore in FY 2015-16 and plans to double it in next 4-5 years with growth in current business and new categories in which it plans to enter.\n\nJoin the community of 2M+ industry professionals\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.\n\nDownload ETRetail App\n\nGet Realtime updates\n\nSave your favourite articles"
