Moneyworks4Me is not a rating and ranking agency, however it is required that users have a way of selecting funds and building a Portfolio. The method used by it are described below to enable users to understand the logic behind the rating and ranking Subscriber will find more details on this in the various content made available from time to time. In case you need more please write to besafe@moneyworks4Me.com\n\nMoneyWorks4Me rates and ranks mutual funds based on the following data-driven system:\n\nPerformance Consistency: This is measure based on whether the fund has beaten the benchmark index consistently. For this we compare the 3-year rolling returns of the fund with the benchmark for a minimum of 5 years and preferable 10 years. The period of rolling is one month and holding period is 3 years. Fund are color-coded Green on Performance when the fund beats the benchmark more than 90% of the time. It is Orange if it beats 80% to 90% of the time and Red if less than 80%. Funds with less than 5 year data are color-coded Grey.\n\nQuality of Portfolio Holding: Moneyworks4Me has color-coded stocks as Green, Orange and Red based on whether the company's performance has generated a ROCE above a threshold level (cost of capital) over 10 years (minimum 6 years) and generated positive Free Cash Flow. For Banks it checks whether ROE is greater than 15% and sales has grown over previous year. Stocks that perform consistently on these combined metrics are color-coded Green (min score 14 out of 20), Orange (between 8 and 14) and Red (less than 8 out of 20).\n\nFund are color-coded Green provided the portfolio has 70% holding in Green stocks but not more than 20% in Red stocks. Funds with more than 20% Red stocks in the portfolio are color-coded Red. The rest are Orange funds\n\nFunds ranking in screeners: Performance Consistency and Quality are two parameters used for ranking funds for SIP. The ranking as follows GG, GO, GR, OG, OO, OR, RG, RO and RR.\n\nWith the same color-coded funds, the one with the higher Average 3-year rolling returns (over 5 to 10 years), the number that appears in the Performance tag, ranks higher.\n\nHere is the summary:"
