While making a product a SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) of the shop retailers think about the GMROI (Gross Margin Return On Investment) and they promote the brand which provide them highest. They expect return in the form of profit margin, company schemes, window display and references of the shop. Among these, company schemes make the differences and are the highest source of motivation after profit margin. Retailing demands a constant push from the company. Marketer needs to use advertising and brand building strategies to address the discerning buyers and retail push to in different buyers. The manufacturer should understand consumer behavior because retailers can't help quality and price. It is only up to dealers said it is demand they sell Britannia 42% agree that at retail shop it is brand popularity, which determine the purchase of biscuit. There is a greater need to understand the retailer behaviour considering them as a team working for the company may help them to be attached to the company. There should be feeling of belonging to the company in inner of the retailers. Setting values club for retailers so that they may exchange views with the company and help in understanding consumer behaviour.

Price plays a vital role because purchasing power is depend upon price and availability of that product, in case distributors and retailers service matter a lot in Institutional business. From chronic shortages of milk, India has emerged today as the largest producer of milk in the world crossing 97 million tonnes. It is 'The Oyster' of the global dairy industry. It offers opportunities galore to entrepreneurs worldwide, who wish to capitalize on one of the world's largest and fastest growing markets for milk and milk products. A bagful of 'pearls' awaits the international dairy processor in India. The Indian dairy industry is rapidly growing, trying to keep pace with the galloping progress around the world. The effective Dairy market is largely confined to urban areas, inhabited by over25 per cent of the country's population. An estimated 50 per cent of the total milk produced is consumed here. By the end of 2007, the urban population isexpected to increase by more than 100 million to touch 864 million in 2007 agrowth of about 40 per cent. The expected rise in urban population would be aboon to Indian dairying. Presently, the organized sector both cooperative andprivate and the traditional sector cater to this market. INDIAN DAIRY INDUSTRY - A PROFILE India’s dairy sector is expected to triple its production in the next 10 years inview of expanding potential for export to Europe and the West. Moreover with WTO regulations expected to come nto force in coming years all the developedcountries which are among big exporters today would have to withdraw the support and subsidy to their domestic milk products sector. Also India today isthe lowest cost producer of per litre of milk in the world, at 27 cents, compared with the U.S' 63 cent. Also to take advantage of this lowest cost of milk production and increasing production in the country multinational companiesare planning to expand their activities here. Some of these milk producers have already obtained quality standard certificates from the authorities. This will help them in marketing their products in foreign countries in processed form .The urban market for milk products is expected to grow at an accelerated pace of around 33% per annum to around Rs.83,500 crores by year 2010. This growth is going to come from the greater emphasis on the processed foods sector and also by increase in the conversion of milk into milk products. By2010, the value of Indian dairy produce is expected to be Rs 10,00,000 million.Presently the market is valued at around Rs7,00,000mn . Background of Dairy Industry Beginning in organized milk handling was made in India with the establishment of Military Dairy Farms. Handling of milk in Co-operative Milk Unions established all over the country on a small scale in the early stages. Long distance refrigerated rail-transport of milk from Anand to Bombay since 1945. Pasteurization and bottling of milk on a large scale for organized distribution was started at Aarey (1950), Calcutta (Haringhata, 1959), Delhi (1959), Worli(1961), Madras (1963) etc. Establishment of Milk Plants under the Five-Year Plans for Dairy Developmentall over India. These were taken up with the dual object of increasing the national level of milk consumption and ensuing better returns to the primary milk producer. Their main aim was to produce more, better and cheaper milk.\n\n10. 9 Indian (traditional) Milk Products There are a large variety of traditional Indian milk products such as Makkhan - unsalted butter. Ghee - butter oil prepared by heat clarification, for longer shelf life. Kheer - a sweet mix of boiled milk, sugar and rice. Basundi - milk and sugar boiled down till it thickens. Rabri - sweetened cream. Dahi - a type of curd. Lassi - curd mixed with water and sugar/ salt. Channa/Paneer - milk mixed with lactic acid to coagulate. Khoa - evaporated milk, used as a base to produce sweet meats. The market for indigenous based milk food products is difficult to estimate as most of these products are manufactured at home or in small cottage industries catering to local areas. Consumers while purchasing dairy products look for freshness, quality, taste and texture, variety and convenience. Products like Dahi and sweets like Kheer, Basundi, Rabri are perishable products with a shelf life of less than a day. These products are therefore manufactured and sold by local milk and sweet shops. There are several such small shops within the vicinity of residential areas. Consumer loyalty is built by consistent quality, taste and freshness. There are several sweetmeat shops, which have built a strong brand franchise, and have several branches located in various parts of a city. Branding Of Traditional Milk Products Among the traditional milk products, ghee is the only product, which is currently marketed, in branded form. main ghee brands are Sagar, MilkMan (Britannia), Amul (GCMMF), Aarey (Mafco Ltd), Vijaya (AP Dairy Development Cooperative Federation), Verka ( Punjab Dairy Cooperative), Everyday (Nestle) and Farm Fresh (Wockhardt). With increasing urbanization and changing consumer preferences, there is possibility of large scale manufacture of indigenous milk products also. The equipments in milk manufacturing have versatility and can be adapted for several products. For instance, equipments used to manufacture yogurt also can be adapted for large scale production of Indian curd products (dahi and lassi). Significant research work has been done on dairy equipments under the aegis of NDDB. Mafco Limited sells Lassi under the Aarey brand and flavoured milk under the Energee franchise (in the Western region, mainly in Mumbai). Britannia has launched flavored milk in various flavors in tetra packs. GCMMF has also made a beginning in branding of other traditional milk products with the launch of packaged Paneer under the Amul brand. It has also created a new umbrella brand \"Amul Mithaee\", for a range of ethnic Indian sweets that are proposed to be launched The first new product Amul Mithaee Gulabjamun has already been launched in major Indian markets.\n\n11. 10 Western Milk Products Western milk products such as butter, cheese, yogurt have gained popularity in the Indian market only during the last few years. However consumption has been expanding with increasing urbanization. Butter Most Indians prefer to use home made white butter (makkhan) for reasons of taste and affordability. Most of the branded butter is sold in the towns and cities. The major brands are Amul, Vijaya, Sagar, Nandini and Aarey. Amul is the leading national brand while the other players have greater shares in their local markets. The latest entrant in the butter market has been Britannia. Britannia has the advantages of a wide distribution reach and a strong brand recall. Priced at par with the Amul brand, it is expected to give stiff competition to the existing players. In 1999-00 the butter production is estimated at 4 lakh MT of this only 45K MT is in the white form used for table purposes rest all is in the yellow form. Cheese The present market for cheese in India is estimated at about 9,000 tonnes and is growing at the rate of about 15% per annum. Cheese is mainly consumed in the urban areas. The four metro cities alone account for more than 50% of consumption . Mumbai is the largest market (accounting for 30% of cheese sold in the country), followed by Delhi (20%). Calcutta (7%) and Chennai (6%). Mumbai has a larger number of domestic consumers, compared to Delhi where the bulk institutional segment (mainly hotels) is larger. Demand for various types of cheese in the Indian market Type of cheese % of total consumption Processed 50 Cheese spread 30 Mozzarella 10 Flavoured/Spiced 5 Others 5 The major players are Amul, Britannia, and Dabon International dominating the market. Other major brands were Vijaya, Verka and Nandini (all brands of various regional dairy cooperatives) and Vadilal. The heavy advertising and promotions being undertaken by these new entrants is expected to lead to strong 20% growth in the segment. Amul has also become more aggressive with launch of new variants such as Mozzarella cheese (used in Pizza), cheese powder, etc. The entry of new players and increased marketing activity is expected to expand the market. All the major players are expanding their capacities\n\n12. 11 Capacity expansion in Cheese Company Brands State Capacity Dynamix Group Manufactures for Britannia Maharashtra 35 tons per day GCMMF Amul Gujarat 20 tons per day APDDCF Vijaya Andhra Pradesh 10 tons per day 50 30 10 5 5 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Processed Cheese spread Mozzarella Flavoured/Spiced Others Total consumption % of total consumption\n\n13. 12 54% 31% 15% Capacity (tons per day) Manufactures for Britannia Amul Vijaya 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 Manufactures for Britannia Amul Vijaya Capacity (tons per day) Capacity (tons per day)\n\n14. 13 COMPANY PROFILE Britannia Industries Limited Type Public (BSE: 500825 NSE: BRITANNIA) Industry Food processing Founded 1892 Headquarters Bangalore, Karnataka, India Number of locations 300 stores (2000) Area served India Products Bakery products, including biscuits, bread, cakes and rusk, and dairy products, including milk, butter, cheese, ghee and dahi Revenue ₹78.58 billion(US$1.2 billion) (2014) Profit ₹1.34 billion(US$20 million) (2011) Owner Nusli Wadia Parent Wadia Group Website www.britannia.co.in\n\n15. 14 BRITANNIA LOGO & TAGLINE Britannia The story of one of India's favorite brands reads almost like a fairy tale. Once upon a time, in 1892 to be precise, a biscuit company was started in a nondescript house in Calcutta (now Kolkata) with an initial investment of Rs. 295. The company we all know as Britannia today. The beginnings might have been humble-the dreams were anything but. By 1910, with the advent of electricity, Britannia mechanized its operations, and in 1921, it became the first company east of the Suez Canal to use imported gas ovens. Britannia's business was flourishing. But, more importantly, Britannia was acquiring a reputation for quality and value. As a result, during the tragic World War II, the Government reposed its trust in Britannia by contracting it to supply large quantities of \"service biscuits\" to the armed forces. As time moved on, the biscuit market continued to grow… and Britannia grew along with it. In 1975, the Britannia Biscuit Company took over the distribution of biscuits from Parry's who till now distributed Britannia biscuits in India. In the subsequent public issue of 1978, Indian shareholding crossed 60%, firmly establishing the Indianness of the firm. The Parent Company Britannia Industries Category Food Products Sector Food and Beverages Tagline/ Slogan Eat healthy think Better USP India’s very own bakery and dairy products brand that is trusted for its quality\n\n16. 15 following year, Britannia Biscuit Company was re-christened Britannia Industries Limited (BIL). Four years later in 1983, it crossed the Rs. 100 crores revenue mark. On the operations front, the company was making equally dynamic strides. In 1992, it celebrated its Platinum Jubilee. In 1997, the company unveiled its new corporate identity - \"Eat Healthy, Think Better\" - and made its first foray into the dairy products market. In 1999, the \"Britannia Khao, World Cup Jao\" promotion further fortified the affinity consumers had with 'Brand Britannia'. Britannia strode into the 21st Century as one of India's biggest brands and the pre-eminent food brand of the country. It was equally recognized for its innovative approach to products and marketing: the Lagaan Match was voted India's most successful promotional activity of the year 2001 while the delicious Britannia 50-50 Maska-Chaska became India's most successful product launch. In 2002, Britannia's New Business Division formed a joint venture with Fonterra, the world's second largest Dairy Company, and Britannia New Zealand Foods Pvt. Ltd. was born. In recognition of its vision and accelerating graph, Forbes Global rated Britannia 'One amongst the Top 200 Small Companies of the World', and The Economic Times pegged Britannia India's 2nd Most Trusted Brand. Today, more than a century after those tentative first steps, Britannia's fairy tale is not only going strong but blazing new standards, and that miniscule initial investment has grown by leaps and bounds to crores of rupees in wealth for Britannia's shareholders. The company's offerings are spread across the spectrum with products ranging from the healthy and economical Tiger biscuits to the more lifestyle-oriented Milkman Cheese. Having succeeded in garnering the trust of almost one-third of India's one billion population and a strong management at the helm means Britannia will continue to dream big on its path of innovation and quality. BRITANNIA DAIRY INDUSTRY Dairy India remains the largest producer and consumer of dairy. However, as in the case of other food products, Indians trail much of the world in per capita dairy consumption. This gap is getting bridged rapidly with demand growing at a faster pace than supply. Many industry\n\n17. 16 experts opine that this is likely to cause a supply deficit in the near future. Largeness of the Dairy opportunity is visible to all; as a result the industry this year saw heightened activity with several private companies announcing entry, cooperatives expanding footprint and multinationals formally entering. While the growth in the last few years has been on account of increasing milk consumption; value added segments of dairy such as Cheese and Set Dahi in which your Company participates have grown at a faster pace. A range of factors will drive the growth of dairy industry going forward: i) With time available to manage households declining; consumers will seek day-to-day needs in ready to consume and convenient forms. With this dairy industry which is overwhelmingly unorganized today will shift steadily towards the organized sector; ii) With increasing affluence there will be demand for the value added product; as a result dairy market will shift from basic to processed; MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS iii) Consumption of all dairy products will go up as consumers gravitate towards a more balanced diet as income levels increase. The levers of success going forward are likely to be: a) Access to quality milk as basic raw material; b) The right product value addition capability c) Access to a cold chain. Britannia is recognized as one of the most trusted, valuable and popular brands among Indian consumers in various reputed surveys.

The buyer senses a difference between his actual state and desired state. INFORMATION SEARCH There are different sources from where a consumer can gather information like personal sources commercial sources, experimental sources. EVALUATION OF ALTERNATIVES After gathering information about different products the customer will be in a fuss as to choose which product among the mainly alternatives consumer usually evaluate the alternatives on traditional basis, on the basis of utility function etc. from the many alternative consumers at last choose the best one for him. PURCHASE DECISION A consumer who decides to execute purchase intention will be making up to five purchase decisions. POST PURCHASE BEHAVIOR After purchasing the product and services the consumer will experience some level of satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the product and services that will influence subsequent behavior. If consumer is satisfied he may show the probability of buying the product the next time, satisfied customer will say good thing about the product, proving the statement that \"satisfied customer is the best advertisement.” A dissatisfied customer may take some action against it. They may try to reduce the dissonance by abandoning returning the product. Understanding consumer needs and buying process is the foundation of any company. By understanding how buyers go through problem recognition, information search evaluation of alternatives, the purchase decision and post purchase behavior marketers can pick up many clues as to how to meet buyers need.\n\n24. 23 PEST & Micro environmental Factors A PEST analysis is used to identify the external forces affecting an organisation .This is a simple analysis of an organisations Political, Economical, Social and Technological environment. A PEST analysis incorporating legal and environmental factors is called a PESTLE analysis. Political The first element of a PEST analysis is a study of political factors. Political factors influence organisations in many ways. Political factors can create advantages and opportunities for organisations. Conversely they can place obligations and duties on organisations. Political factors which influence the Britannia are as follows:-  Methodology of development of Standards  Provisions of Labelling  Acceptance of a basic list of additives  Matters relating to GMP(Good Manufacturing Practice), GHP(Gud Health Plan)  Issues related to Codex  Procedure for sampling& launching of Prosecutin  Grading of violations according to the nature of discrepancy.  Legislation such as the minimum wage or anti discrimination laws.  Voluntary codes and practices.  Market regulations. Trade agreements, tariffs or restrictions. Non conformance with legislative obligations can lead to sanctions such as fines, adverse publicity and imprisonment. Ineffective voluntary codes and practices will often lead to governments introducing legislation to regulate the activities covered by the codes and practices. Economical\n\n25. 24 The second element of a PEST analysis involves a study of economic factors.All businesses are affected by national and global economic factors. National and global interest rate and fiscal policy will be set around economic conditions. The climate of the economy dictates how consumers, suppliers and other organisational stakeholders such as suppliers and creditors behave within society.An economy undergoing recession will have high unemployment, low spending power and low stakeholder confidence. Conversely a ³booming´ or growing economy will have low unemployment, high spending power and high stakeholder confidence. A Britannia will respond to economic conditions and stakeholder behaviour. Furthermore Britannia will need to review the impact economic conditions are having on their competitors and respond accordingly. A truly Britannia has to be aware of economic conditions across all borders and needs to ensure that it employs strategies that protect and promote its business through economic conditions throughout the world. Social The third aspect of PEST focuses its attention on forces within society such as family, friends,colleagues, neighbours and the media. Social forces affect our attitudes, interest s and opinions.These forces shape who we are as people, the way we behave and ultimately what we purchase.For example within the UK peoples attitudes are changing towards their diet and health. As aresult the UK is seeing an increase in the number of people joining fitness clubs and a massivegrowth for the demand of organic food. Population changes also have a direct impact on organisations. Changes in the structure of a population will affect the supply and demand of goods and services within an economy. Falling birth rates will result in decreased demand and greater competition as the number of consumers fall. In summary Britannia must be able to offer products and services that aim to complement and benefit people’s lifestyle and behaviour. If Britannia do not respond to changes in society they will lose market share and demand for their product or service. Technological Unsurprisingly the fourth element of PEST is technology, as you are probably aware technological advances have greatly changed the manner in which businesses operate. Organisations use technology in many ways, they have 1. Technology infrastructure such as the internet and other information exchange systemsincluding telephone2. Technology systems incorporating a multitude of software which help them manage their business.3. Technology hardware such as mobile phones, Blackberrys, laptops, desktops, Bluetooth devices, photocopiers and fax machines which\n\n26. 25 transmit and record information. Technology has created a society which expects instant results. This technological revolution has increased the rate at which information is exchanged between stakeholders. A faster exchange of information can benefit Britannia company as they are able to react quickly to changes within their operating environment. However an ability to react quickly also creates extra pressure as businesses are expected to deliver on their promises within ever decreasing timescales. Technology will continue to evolve and impact on consumer habits and expectations,. If Britannia ignore this fact then it will definitely face extinction.\n\n27. 26 MARKETING STRATEGY Marketing is not Euclidean geometry a fixed system of concept. Rather marketing is one of the dynamic fields with in the management arena. The market faces continually a new challenge everyday and companies must respond to it positively. Therefore it is not surprising that new market idea keep surfacing to meet new market place challenges. The market process is applicable to more than goods and services. Anything related to market including ideas, events, policies, prices and personalities comes under market strategy. However it is important to emphasize opportunity in the market through market strategy. Following strategies adopted by the organization.  A strong quality of the product and customer satisfaction: Customers always believe in good quality product. in my survey I found that in percentage term more people is quality conscious and not price conscious. Customer satisfaction is very important part of the organization that at any cost they have to fulfill.  A growing relationship with customer and customer retention: Nowadays a good relation with customer is very important for organization. Sale is totally depending on the relation with the customers. Customer's retention is also a major aspect for growing business. It means keep the old customer and try to make new customer.  Focus on competitors activity: Every organization should must be careful about it's competitors step, because they can disturb the growing sales process of the organization.  A growing emphasis on global thinking and local marketing planning: Companies are increasing by pursuing market beyond their borders. When they enter other countries they must follow the tradition of that country and also they make plan for local market that which type of product has more demand and how can it run in the market.  Promotional Strategy Under the market strategy promotional idea is very important. Organization provides some schemes or rebates to retailers or consumers. They make advertisement according to convenient of the people and the feature of the product.\n\n28. 27 So on the basis of marketing strategy a organization runs in the market. It is several types of which makes helpful to increase sales and turnover of the organization TARGET SEGMENT & DEFINATION .Market segmentation and selecting target market It is an effort to increase a company's precision marketing. The starting point of any segmentation discussion is mass marketing. In mass marketing, the seller engaged in the mass production, mass distribution and mass promotion of one product for all buyers. Market segment consists of a large identifiable group within a market with similar wants, purchasing power geographical location, buying attitudes or buying habita. It is an approach midway between mass marketing and individual marketing. Through this the choice of distribution channels, and communicaton channels become much easier. The researchers try to form segments by looking at consumer characteristics; geographic, demographic, and psychographic. After segmenting the market then target market selected. STP Segment People who need and consume bakery and dairy products Target Group Middle and upper middle class families, especially kids Positioning India’s leading manufacturer of premium quality and healthy biscuits, bakery and dairy products\n\n29. 28 2. Positioning:- The positioning is a creative exercise down with an existing product. the well known products generally hold a distinctive position in consumer's minds. The positioning requires that every tangible aspect of product, price, place and promotion must support the chosen positioning strategy. Company should develop a unique selling proposition (USP) for each brand and stick to it, PPL consistently promotes its DAP fertilizer by Higher yield at lower cost. As companies increase the number of claims for their brand, they risk disbelief and a loss of clear positioning. In general a company must avoid four major positioning errors. Those are under positioning over positioning, confused positioning and doubtful positioning. 3. Product:- A product is any offering that can satisfy a need or want. The major types of basic offerings are goods, services, experiences, events, places, properties, organizations, information and ideas. The company gives more importance in quality, packaging, services etc. to satisfy the customers. The products has it's life cycle. The product strategies are modified in different stages of product life cycle. 4. Price:- It is the most important aspect in company's point of view. Price of the product will be decided by the company according to the competitor's price. 5.

Potentiality of any product depends upon the futuristic performance of the product. it depends that how much retailers have potentiality to be permanent seller of BRITANNIA. For great potentiality it is necessary to improve those factors which are going to effect retailers. In my study I found some factors which can help to cover great potentiality. These factors are following:  Scheme delivery should in perfect determining time.  Some places distributors not able to cover his particular area. That should be improved.\n\n31. 30  Scheme facility should be regular as much as possible.  Small pack also should be in the market.  Always collect the views of retailers. It gives psychological effect on the retailers about care ness by manufacturing company. These factors are very important for the organization.

The reasons for not using by the bulk users are : 1. Higher price that is not meeting the competitors rate as bulk user are very price sensitive. Other dairies are providing higher margin. 2. In case of canteens contract some of them prefer credit purchasing which is against company’s norms and policies. 70 36 9 115 27 32 0 59 9 0 0 9 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 Chandigarh Mohali Zirakpur Total Customer Targeted Rate Intesested Not Interested Complicated\n\n37. 36 CONCLUSION: Concluding observations The final outcome of the project is that the parameters which hinder the sale of Dairy are Price, Quality, Service and Taste. Milk market is a totally unpredictable market and the organisation should be over-cautious of any complaints that come into milk as it includes the sentiments of a mother for her kid and she would not prefer to give anything to her kid for which she is not100% satisfied. So the company should take every step possible to contain these problems which in some way or the other affects the sale of Mother Dairy and its retailers. Limitations of the study Since the study is done in only region of Chandigarh Mohali , Zirakpur,these results cannot be generalised on whole North region basis. Shopkeepers also tend to hide some facts and figures due to some reasons which can hinder the resultswe get from this survey. Still a lot can be done to make the whole system efficient. Further scope of study The findings we got from this project will be of great help for the company as these findings will help the organisation for improving their system as well as Dairy 59% 13% 7% 5% 16% Competitors Amul Nestle Gowardhan Local Britannia\n\n38. 37 SUGGESTION AND RECOMMENDATIONS:  Britannia can cut costs for some period of time followed immediately by strong advertising. As we have seen during the research that most of institutions give most preference to the margin provided to them on milk products .As the quality and taste and availability of Britannia dairy Products. Britannia dairy Products are best in market and local Dairy give companies good margin to them, Price remains the main criteria of institutional Dairy sales.  Can start schemes like cash prizes or foreign trips on scratching the barcode on the packet  Locate the institutions using competitor’s and provide them attractive offers to increase the market share so that at least the big competitors will not try to expand.  Mergers and Acquisition in the Dairy industry with local players help the company in . increasing its distribution network and Market share  Efficiency in distribution  Remove communication barriers and misconceptions between the Institutions and distributors by effective communication with institutions time to time\n\n39. 38 BIBLIOGRAPHY BOOKS AUTHOR PHILIP KOTLER TITLE MARKETING MANAGEMENT PLACE OF PUBLICATION PRENTICE HALL OF INDIA LTD.
