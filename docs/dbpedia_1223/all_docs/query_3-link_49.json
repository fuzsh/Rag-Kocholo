        "text": "For Vinita Bali, managing director of Britannia Industries, making conventional choices goes against the grain. When she returned to India in 2005 to take charge of the food company after several successful years with Coca-Cola in Atlanta, it seemed like a suicidal career move.\n\nBritannia, best known for its biscuits and partly owned by French food giant Groupe Danone at the time, had been drifting since 2003, when its previous chief executive was fired over allegations of financial impropriety. It had lost market share and talented executives. Moreover, Danone and its Indian partner, Wadia Group, were at loggerheads. (Danone eventually sold its 25.5% stake in Britannia to Wadia, which now owns 51%; the rest is publicly traded.)\n\nShunning two job offers from multinational companies because “they would have been more of the same,” Bali, 56, chose the troubled Britannia. “I like to go in and take things apart. There’s nothing exciting about doing the doable,” she says, in her office at the corporate headquarters in Bangalore.\n\nAfternoon tea is served, accompanied by a selection of cookies and NutriChoice multigrain thins, a new baked snack. “You must try everything; it’s all quite healthy,” insists the petite Bali. A 25-gram pack of NutriChoice multigrain thins— made of corn, oats, wheat, rice and millet, topped with flax -seeds—is equivalent to 110 calories, “half the calories of any packet of fried chips,” she notes.\n\nUnder Bali’s seven-year watch Britannia has strived to live up to its corporate slogan: “Eat Healthy. Think Better.” Not only has it removed trans fats from all its biscuits, but also half the biscuits it produces—including its best-known Marie and Tiger brands—are fortified with iron, vitamins and minerals. It has also introduced a range of healthier items, including cookies for diabetics. “Innovation has fueled our growth,” says Bali.\n\nBritannia, maker of biscuits in India since 1892, has one third of the country’s $3 billion biscuit market, where it competes with scores of small-scale producers, large domestic companies Parle Products and ITC, and multinationals such as Cadbury. In its 120-year history Britannia has had multiple owners, including Nabisco Brands of the U.S. Nusli Wadia, chairman of Wadia Group, as well as Britannia, has a reputation for being demanding, but Bali says she faces no interference and has stood her ground by delivering solid results.\n\nBritannia’s sales have grown at a compound annual rate of 22% since 2005, more than doubling from $317 million to $841 million as of last March. Its market cap has almost doubled to $1.1 billion. But net income, which was $28 million in the year ended last March, hasn’t grown, thanks to the soaring cost of key ingredients—wheat, sugar and milk. Bali acknowledges that while the company’s top line has achieved good momentum, the challenge now is to “put profits back into our growth.”\n\nA slew of measures are under way, from pruning distribution costs to introducing products with a higher net margin. “We’re attacking costs in every aspect of our supply chain and getting smart about our product and packaging mix,” she explains. Margins are improving; in the quarter ended in September Britannia’s net profit jumped 19% to $7.5 million.\n\n“Britannia was a CEO’s nightmare in a way,” observes Nasser Munjee, chairman of Development Credit Bank and a Britannia director. “Vinita’s produced extraordinary results and put the company in the front line of what is a hypercompetitive market.” Keki Dadiseth, a former Unilever director who sits on Britannia’s board, agrees that while Bali has completely transformed the company, “Her next challenge is to accelerate further on innovation.”\n\nBali has a wealth of experience. The eldest of three siblings, she grew up in Delhi, where her father worked for the government. After Bali got an economics degree from the University of Delhi, a cousin suggested she consider business school. She left home, moving into a hostel in Mumbai and enrolling in an M.B.A. program at the elite Jamnalal Bajaj Institute of Management Studies. “Vinita was the studious one, always well prepared,” recalls pharmaceutical billionaire Ajay Piramal, her business school buddy. In 2008 she became a non - executive director of his packaging unit, Piramal Glass, on whose board she still sits. “Vinita brings a global view and a deep understanding of consumers,” says Piramal.\n\nAfter a short stint at the consumer-goods division of Tata Group’s air- conditioning unit, Voltas, Bali joined Cadbury India as brand manager. In 1982 she took a sabbatical to enrol for a Ph.D. in business and economics at Michigan State University on a Rotary scholarship. Itching to get back to “the world of action,” she dropped her doctoral thesis to intern briefly at the UN before returning to Cadbury in 1984.\n\nShe was posted to the company’s U.K. headquarters in Bournville as group brand manager. During that two-year stint she successfully launched Wispa, an aerated chocolate bar similar to Nestlé’s Aero. In 1986, when she returned to India to head up the marketing department, she was the company’s youngest general manager.\n\nSix years later Bali accepted a posting nobody wanted, in Nigeria. “It was a real test,” she recalls. She developed a taste for adventure, and when the post of marketing director at Cadbury’s South African unit opened up, Bali grabbed it. She saw history being made in 1994 when Nelson Mandela became the country’s first black president. “I was lucky to be there,” she says.\n\nThen Coca-Cola came calling. “You can’t say no to Coke,” she smiles. Sergio Zyman, Coca-Cola’s chief marketing officer at the time, says he was impressed by “Vinita’s willingness to be continually challenged and her appetite for new places.”\n\nMoving from Johannesburg to Atlanta in 1994 to work as worldwide marketing director under Zyman, Bali entered what she sees as her golden period. “The sheer magnitude of the job as strategist for the world’s most valuable brand was compelling,” she says. After Zyman quit Coca-Cola in a management churn in 1998, Bali moved to Santiago, Chile to head the Andean division. Cathy Brink, who worked with Bali for four years at Coca-Cola and is now an independent marketing consultant, says her former colleague combines technical skills with people skills. “Vinita has the ability to work across cultural lines and get people to follow her. If there had been an open election, she would have been Coke’s chief marketing officer.”\n\nAs it was, her last job at Coca-Cola was vice president of corporate strategy. In 2003 Zyman, who had set up his own marketing consultancy, persuaded his protégé to join him. After two years at Zyman Group in Atlanta, heading the business strategy practice, Bali decided it was time to go home. “I had no plans to return. But when my mother had a stroke, I felt I had to,” says Bali, who remains single. (Both parents died within three years of her return.)\n\nThough Bali knew the food business well, she had her job cut out getting Britannia back on track, starting with the work culture. At first, when she arrived at the office at 9 a.m., she found no one there. “To bring about change you’ve got to overcommunicate the goals. You’ve got to expect and demand performance,” says Bali. She poached key executives from multinationals such as Unilever and fired underperformers. “We distinguish people into ‘great,’ ‘good’ and ‘gone,’” she says.\n\nBali worked 16-hour days and traveled tirelessly across the country, touring the company’s factories and offices. While visiting the Delhi factory she came across cartons of fortified biscuits Britannia was making for the UN World Food Program. This sparked the idea of producing fortified biscuits for the domestic market. In a country where child malnutrition is rampant— 42% of India’s children under 5 years of age are undernourished, according to a recent study—there’s a crying need, she insists, “to find food-based solutions.”\n\nToday Britannia supplies fortified biscuits at cost to 800 public schools in South India. Bali also spearheaded the formation of the Britannia Nutrition Foundation to advocate better child nutrition. These efforts have brought recognition; in 2008 Bill Gates cited Britannia’s fortified foods as one of eight examples of creative capitalism. It was also invited to join the Clinton Global Initiative’s campaign against malnutrition. In Bali’s view such work isn’t part of any corporate social responsibility program but integral to the business: “I think it’s corporate responsibility—I hate the word ‘social’—which means finding an area of responsibility within your business model. You just have to dig deep enough,” she maintains.\n\nWhile she’s paid $1 million a year, Bali’s friends aver she doesn’t hanker after personal wealth. “The nutrition cause she’s embraced is larger for Vinita than any business objective. I think it’s going to be her lifelong mission,” says human resources consultant Anita Ramachandran, a longtime friend. Bali hungers to do more. “I’m not declaring victory yet,” she muses about her efforts at Britannia and the fight against malnutrition. “It’s never a victory.”\n\nIn the March issue FORBES ASIA will publish a list of 50 of Asia’s Power Business Women for 2012.\n\n."
