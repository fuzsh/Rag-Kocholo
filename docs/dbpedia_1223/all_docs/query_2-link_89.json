        "text": "Sustainability\n\nBritannia is committed to working towards a more sustainable future to the benefit of our membership and society as a whole. We have aligned our strategy with a number of the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and embedded these across our organisation as part of our business model and conduct.\n\nAnnually Britannia issues a sustainability report which provides an update on the proactive actions Britannia has taken to date in addressing Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues and those it is committing to in the future. Furthermore, as part of our commitment to promote sustainability, we have produced a sustainability report template for our membership and other third parties to use. The template is designed to be generic recognising that each company will have a different approach to sustainability which reflects their unique commercial and regulatory needs.\n\nTHE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS\n\nWe believe that the following SDGs are key to ensuring the future sustainability of Britannia P&I and therefore have been embedded into our business strategy:\n\nSDG 3 – ‘GOOD HEALTH AND WELLBEING’ with an emphasis on the care and protection of our employees and also crews on board our Members’ and other’s ships.\n\nSDG 8 – ‘DECENT WORK AND ECONOMIC GROWTH’ with an emphasis on the work to improve the marine industry with our peers in the IG.\n\nSDG 10 – ‘REDUCED INEQUALITIES’ with an emphasis on employee diversity and inclusion.\n\nSDG 13 – ‘CLIMATE ACTION’ focusing on managing the risk of our potential enhanced liability through a transition to a low carbon economy and climate change resulting in further severe weather.\n\nSDG 14 – ‘LIFE BELOW WATER’ with an emphasis on crisis management and pollution prevention in the air, sea and on land.\n\nSDG 16 – ‘PEACE, JUSTICE, STRONG INSTITUTIONS’ with an emphasis on corporate governance, robust and auditable policies, and transparent procedures and reporting together with the elimination of corruption in the marine industry.\n\nSDG 17 – ‘PARTNERSHIPS TO ACHIEVE GOALS’ with an emphasis on participation in the mutual risk sharing of the International Group and collaborating to provide a leading industry voice.\n\nCORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY (CSR)\n\nBritannia and its Managers, Tindall Riley, undertake a wide range of volunteering activities in the local community throughout the year, as well as supporting a number of charities through corporate giving and donations. Britannia supports both charities and charitable initiatives in our local community, as well as charities dedicated to supporting seafarers. More information can be found here.\n\nSUSTAINABILITY REPORTS AND TEMPLATES\n\nView Britannia’s annual sustainability reports and report template here.\n\nCONTACT\n\nBritannia’s sustainability lead is Jacob Damgaard, Associate Director, Loss Prevention."
