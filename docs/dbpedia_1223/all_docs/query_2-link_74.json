        "text": "Britannia Foods\n\nOffice: Mumbai\n\nIndia’s leading cookies and bakery brand that generations of Indians had grown up with was readying itself for a transformation into a total foods company in its hundredth year of existence.\n\nBeside a strong association with cookies and cheese, Britannia was best known for its iconic jingle and its promise of “eat healthy, think better”, both created in 1997. But in the decades since, the meaning of health and wellness had undergone a tremendous shift. The brand had to reflect this new reality to stay relevant, especially to young adults who were an important customer set. The refreshed Britannia brand had to add excitement, reinforce premium, enhance youth appeal and, most importantly, convey that Britannia was a total foods company, not just a bakery specialist.\n\nResearch amongst consumers revealed that the brand’s biggest strength: Britannia was seen to be the only brand seen to have the perfect balance between goodness and indulgence. We built on the idea of ‘balance’ to create the brand promise which was summed up as Exciting Goodness."
