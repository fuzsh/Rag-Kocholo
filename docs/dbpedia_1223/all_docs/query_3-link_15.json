As market leaders, we led pricing actions to offset inflation & maintain profitability. However, in this quarter, commodity prices marginally softened & hence, the local competition intensified.

Moreover, it has commercialized 5 new additional lines each in Barabanki (UP) and Tirunelveli (TN) during Q1FY24.\n\n80:20 Growth Strategy:\n\nThe company performed well during the covid crisis by following the 80:20 rule, that is the company focused on 20% of the brands like Marie Gold, Good Day, Milk Bikis & Nutri Choice, which contributes 80% of the companies revenue, were put on priority list which enabled the company to streamline its productivity and increase the efficiency of the production.\n\nLitigations:\n\nThe company has filed two cases against its rival ITC in the Delhi High court for alleged infringement of its product packaging trademark by using similar design for ITC’s new biscuit ‘’Sunfeast Veda Digestive’’. Britannia has also filed a case against Future consumer. The company has also filed a case against Future consumer for the usage of the name of ‘Good time’ as it sounds similar to Britannia’s iconic ‘Good Day’ brand.\n\nTussle over Ownership:\n\nThe company was started in the year 1892 while the initial promoters remain unknown yet and the name Britannia was given after 26 years of its inception by the London Investor C H Holmes and the company has 7 owners before resting in the hands of the Wadia Group.\n\nFinancials:\n\nWhat we like:\n\nPart of the prestigious Wadia group:\n\nBritannia Industries belongs to the Wadia Group, a reputed Indian Business house who has presence in wide range of business segments like Airlines (Go Air), Realty ( Bombay Realty), Textiles ( Bombay Dyeing) and Plantations and other business (Bombay Burmah trading Corporation which is also the Ultimate holding company of Britannia Industries)\n\nMarket Leader in the Biscuit segment:\n\nBritannia is one of leading players in the business segment with leading market share in the Indian biscuit segment. The company has a wide range of Biscuits portfolio across various categories like glucose, Marie, cookies, crackers, cream, milk, and health. The company sells the products under various Iconic brands like Good Day, Tiger, Marie, Nutrichoice and Milk Bikis and many more.\n\nLimited impact of local competition:\n\nManagement stated that the competition from local players has increased, as input costs eased. However, we believe that the company is well placed to face such challenges. It has already lowered prices of a few products and plans to drive the growth through volumes in coming quarters. Thus, we expect the impact of increasing competition in the market will be limited on the company’s earnings.\n\nPositive outlook:\n\nWe expect Britannia to deliver market-leading growth from here on as\n\nRaw material prices, while still firm, have or will stabilize at the current levels.\n\nRural continues to remain stronger for Britannia (due to the company’s robust distribution expansion strategy in these regions) while other FMCG companies continue to struggle in this sector. Furthermore, the rural revival is expected to recover the overall FMCG sector in FY24, which will be supported by higher government spending and increased urban remittances.\n\nBRIT’s own initiatives such as robust portfolio planning through NPD in core and adjacencies along with its continued focus on increasing direct reach, rural penetration, and a share of in-house manufacturing would help it improve its overall efficiency moving ahead. We believe that this will make BRIT stronger in the longer run\n\nFactors to consider:\n\nThe food industry is highly competitive, with numerous domestic and international players, which can affect pricing and market share.\n\nThe company’s profitability can be impacted by fluctuations in the prices of key raw materials, such as wheat and dairy products.\n\nThe food industry is subject to regulatory changes and quality standards, which can affect production processes and costs.\n\nConclusion:\n\nBritannia Industries Limited is a prominent player in the Indian food industry, known for its strong brand presence and diversified product portfolio. While it benefits from market leadership and a growing dairy segment, it operates in a competitive environment with challenges related to competition and raw material price volatility. Investors should carefully assess the company’s performance and industry dynamics before considering it as a potential investment. Staying informed about Britannia’s strategies and market trends is essential for making well-informed investment decisions."
