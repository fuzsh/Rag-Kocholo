Companies that have trouble getting paid on their receivables or have long inventory turnover can run into liquidity problems because they are unable to alleviate their obligations. Because business operations differ in each industry, it is always more useful to compare companies within the same industry.\n\nAcceptable current ratios vary from industry to industry and are generally between 1 and 3 for healthy businesses.\n\nThe higher the current ratio, the more capable the company is of paying its obligations. A ratio under 1 suggests that the company would be unable to pay off its obligations if they came due at that point. While this shows the company is not in good financial health, it does not necessarily mean that it will go bankrupt - as there are many ways to access financing - but it is definitely not a good sign.\n\nIf all other things were equal, a creditor, who is expecting to be paid in the next 12 months, would consider a high current ratio to be better than a low current ratio, because a high current ratio means that the company is more likely to meet its liabilities which fall due in the next 12 months.\n\nBritannia Industries Current Ratio Related Terms\n\nThank you for viewing the detailed overview of Britannia Industries's Current Ratio provided by GuruFocus.com.
