Tenerife is a large island added in Update 23 on July 8th, 2018. It has two ports -Santa Cruz and Garachico- and several interesting features such as a volcano, cave and bunker. The volcano can erupt and also breaks through the clouds during climate cycles. In real life, Tenerife is one of the seven Canary Islands which are under Spanish rule.

Terrain[]

Most of the western side is rocky cliff, while most of the eastern side is grasslands or the Santa Cruz cityscape. In the south is a large volcano while thereâ€™s a desert in the midlands and a hill on the north side. The hill is mostly covered in grasslands, but rock is still visible on the northwestern side.

Notable Features[]

Volcano[]

The most prominent part of Tenerife is its snow capped volcano that erupts weekly. It erupts every Saturday at 20:00 BST (you can use Google to find when it erupts in your timezone) and if you go inside the volcano during the eruption you will get the Smoking Hot title.

Ministry of Defence Bunker[]

In the island's north can be found a bunker owned by the Ministry of Defence, based on the real life Hack Green Secret Nuclear Bunker. It has one entrance -a long tunnel- which opens to a stairway. This stairway leads to a long hallway connecting to rooms such as a hospital ward, monitoring stations and sleeping quarters. This part of the bunker can be seen from the exterior but it cannot be accessed by normal players. Also, part of the Testbed quest takes place here with a puzzle you must solve (in the main monitoring room).

Cave[]

In north Tenerife you can find one of five caves throughout the map. When entering the cave, you can see a Halo symbol and entering will also count to your progress for the Spelunker title.
