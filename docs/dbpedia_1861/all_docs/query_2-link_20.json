        "text": "What does the Price Include? Is the Price per passenger?\n\nThe price we show you is the final price for what you’ve searched. The price is calculated for the total number of passengers you’ve specified while searching. You can select your currency from the selection at the top right hand corner of the page.\n\nWhat do you consider luggage?\n\nAnything that needs to be stowed away in the trunk of the vehicle will be considered luggage. We consider carry-on to be smaller bags such as a handbag, shoulder bag or briefcase as these can be placed at your feet or on your lap inside of the vehicle.\n\nCan I make changes to my reservation?\n\nAs long as your reservation still allows changes, click on the link on your confirmation email to make changes to your booking. You will be able to make the changes and pay for any price difference as prices are subject to change and then confirm them on the confirmation page.\n\nHow do I find my driver at the Airport?\n\nMost drivers will wait for you at the Airport's arrivals hall with a sign with your name on it. You will also have the driver’s phone number to reach out in case of an emergency. Please read the pickup instructions on your confirmation email carefully.\n\nHow do I cancel my reservation?\n\nYou can cancel your booking in two clicks! We know that sometimes your plans change, so we've tried to make it easy for you to cancel, in case you need to. As long as it's before the provider's cancellation cut-off* (differs by provider, usually 24 hours or less), you can just click on the cancellation link in your confirmation email.\n\nMy Flight is Delayed, do I need to change my reservation?\n\nSorry your flight's delayed! On the bright side, as long as your flight number has not changed from you what you originally informed us, all of our private transport providers and many of our shared ride providers will monitor flight status, so whenever your flight lands, they'll be there to pick you up. We'll make sure you're not delayed any more than you already are - we've got you covered.\n\nFor an airport pickup, how far after I land should I ask to get picked up?\n\nTo make things easy for you, we provide a recommended pickup time. Typically, we recommend 30-40 minutes if you have luggage, though if you have only a carry-on 20 minutes may be enough. If you're flying internationally, we recommend adding another 30-60 minutes for getting through customs. We also recommend calling the driver once you land to inform them that you have arrived, so they know to expect you soon.\n\nWhat is the meaning of the COVID-19 Prepared Label? How are you handling the current health crisis?\n\nWith your safety in mind, we've asked our providers what measures they're taking in order to provide services in the safest way possible. Local providers who comply with at least two of the below safety measures have been marked with the \"COVID-19 Prepared\" label: Drivers use a face mask, carry sanitizing wipes in the vehicle, sanitize the back seats after each and every trip, and provide hand sanitizer during the ride. While most of these practices were already in place before this situation evolved, we want you to be as safe as possible while getting to your destination.\n\nCan I make a stop on the way to the hotel/airport?\n\nPrivate rides may be able to accommodate an additional stop on the way to your final destination as long as you request it with enough time for the local provider to be able to plan accordingly. Please make sure you specify you will need to make a stop along your route on the Special Instructions field right before you confirm your booking. Please bear in mind, additional charges may apply. Since you share with other passengers, shared rides do not often allow for additional stops."
