        "text": "MADRID – Pressure on housing in Spanish tourist hotspots means there are up to 140 aspirants competing to rent every home, a report has found.\n\nOn average, 100 people apply for each home available to rent in Barcelona, Madrid, Valencia and Bilbao and Santa Cruz de Tenerife, according to analysis by Alquiler Seguro, a property company. In the Balearic Islands, an average of 142 people apply for every rental property.\n\nCritics say the scarcity of property has been caused by people renting out their flats to tourists on a short-term basis, through companies such as Airbnb.\n\nBritish citizens are the largest group of foreign buyers of property in Spain. Last year, they purchased 9.8 per cent of all homes bought by foreigners, according to the College of Registrars of Property.\n\nBritish holidaymakers make up the largest group of foreign tourists in Spain, with 17.3 million travelling there in 2023, a rise of 14.6 per cent compared with 2022.\n\nNow, the lack of affordable rental housing has prompted a backlash from locals across the country and calls for action from government ministers.\n\nSergio García, a toolmaker, says he has had to move out of the centre of Málaga because he can no longer afford the prices of flats in the city.\n\n“There are about 11,000 tourist flats in the centre. Because of all these flats being rented out to foreign tourists, local people like me cannot afford to live there. They were asking over €1,200 (£1,032) per month,” he told i. “We have to do something about these flats.”\n\nPablo Bustinduy, Spain’s minister for social rights, demanded a curb on tourist flats. “Public housing stock, restrict tourist apartments, use empty housing, pursue speculation. There is a marked path, you have to want to walk it,” he said on X, the social media network.\n\nAnalysis by Eurostat, the European Union statistics agency, found that 44.8 per cent of Spaniards who rented their homes were at risk of poverty because the cost of property outstripped earnings – the largest group in the EU.\n\nSpaniards spend on average 40 per cent of their income on renting property or on a mortgage, according to Idealista.es and Fotocasa.es, two of the biggest real-estate companies.\n\nIn Barcelona, Spain’s most expensive city, residents can spend as much as 70 per cent of their income on rent, the analysis found.\n\nMartí Cusó, of the Association of Neighbours in Barrio Gótico in Barcelona, the area with the highest number of tourist flats in the city, has been fighting to bring in controls on tourist flats.\n\n“We are not just fighting against investment funds which buy up city centre properties but local people who rent out their properties, sometimes illegally, to make money,” he said.\n\n“There are people who have been kicked out of their flats because they could not afford to pay what the owners wanted to charge the tourists, which was, for example, about €600 per week for a room.”\n\nBarcelona has brought in rent controls in some of the most popular areas with tourists in the city.\n\nSpain lacks about 600,000 homes because construction has slowed in recent years, and many flats are rented to tourists or left empty as holiday homes by their owners, according to a Bank of Spain report published on Tuesday.\n\nIsabel Rodríguez, the Spanish housing minister, has promised to crackdown in May on tourist flats which contravene a basic right to housing.\n\n“We have to intervene and limit the tourist flats. We cannot look the other way,” she told El País newspaper last week."
