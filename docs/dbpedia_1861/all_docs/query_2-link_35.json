        "text": "I‚Äôm very happy that, as part of the Erasmus program, I could participate once again in this wonderful course Tenerife Job Training, which gives me the energy to work for the entire year. This intensive week of working on myself is incredibly valuable, teaching many tools for motivation, taking on new (sometimes difficult) challenges, but also for gaining perspective and relaxation. I am grateful to the Uniwersytet Ekonomiczny we Wroc≈Çawiu for the opportunity to take part in the course, the benefits of which I will reap for a long time. The effects of this transformation (which began during last year's course) are also noticed and appreciated by students.
