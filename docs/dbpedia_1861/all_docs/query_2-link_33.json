        "text": "Resumen\n\nThis project has the intention to make the corresponding installations for electricity and ventilation for the functioning of the first section of the future public transport that will exist on the island, that will connect the capital with the south. This section will be a tunnel that is approximately one kilometer long, from the Bus Station of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. To start carrying out this project, we must locate the corresponding regulations for these facilities in the railway sector. Once the regulations and calculation methods for each part of the project are known, they are used in order to obtain a low voltage installation that is efficient and meets all the requirements. Once the requirements have been accomplished; the distribution of the link connections, luminaires, pushbuttons and sockets can be illustrated in different planes so that the future technicians can carry out the installation correctly. On the other hand, we must focus on the ventilation system. Mainly, we need to obtain the value of the critical velocity of the air, which is the necessary speed that the fans must provide so that the backlayering effect does not occur. After that, the total pressure loss, which depends on different factors. With this data and the value of the critical speed, it is possible to select the fan model that will be necessary in this railway tunnel Finally, knowing the required power of ventilation, it is included in the electrical calculations and its corresponding three-phase outlet to where this system will be connected."
