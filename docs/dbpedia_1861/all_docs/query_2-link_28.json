        "text": "This issue has also another problem....\n\nCalculated shipping costs by app or courier doesn't work for Canary Islands because in EVERY courier database those islands are not managed as \"Spain\" like in Shopify...\n\nif you order and set as address Tenerife for example, the system won't find any tariffs because in every courier system that address is in another country: Canary Islands and not Spain.\n\nFixing the issue could be very very very simple if only Shopify would... and i don't understand why leaving things like this that are CLEARLY WRONG...\n\ni emailed them this morning too.. they should just:\n\n1- Remove \"Las Palmas\" and \"Santa Cruz de Tenerife\" from Spain provinces\n\n2- Create another country called \"Canary Islands\" using their country code \"IC\"\n\nin this way Shopify could fix 2 problems:\n\n1- Correct VAT % for Canary Islands THAT IS NOT 21% like in Spain... (actually Shopify put Spanish vat on all Canary Islands because they are just a Spanish province)\n\n2- Fix calculated shipping cost by app or courier... actually the system check the cost using a Spanish address... but on every courier system Tenerife IS NOT IN SPAIN.. BUT IN CANARY ISLANDS country code \"IC\"\n\nit could be so easy to fix this....\n\ni opened chat with support but they are total unwilling to do help/do nothing... not only... it's looked like the support neither know shopify settings.. very disappointing..\n\nthey suggested me to disable those province from selling... are they serious? this is the way they fix things? by disabling??\n\ni'm not requesting a special feature...\n\nplease keep reporting this to shopify support all together... more requests, more chances to fix this\n\n2you can't solve this...\n\nyou can only: treat all Spain as 0% VAT or treat all Spain as 21% VAT\n\nshopify is unwilling to fix this by creating another country (Canary Islands) for those provinces... their reply was like \"you can do shopify plus to fix this\"\n\nsame problem is for USA associated states (micronesia, palau, marshall islands, american samoa, guam, northern mariana islands, puerto rico, us virgin islands).. they should remove them from USA and create a separate country for each of them... this will fix also a lot of secondary things with integration with couriers like preview of shipping costs and waybill creation\n\nthe only way to fix this is pushing shopify to consider this solution....\n\non all others ecommerce software this is as i described\n\nAgreed this is a real issue not just at customer experience level, but also down the line for accounting.\n\nOne idea is to ask customers from those areas to set up an account, and then at customer level mark this customer as : Not collecting tax.\n\nThis is not a waterproof solution as it will cause issues if customer decides to ship something to Barcelona (tax exempt status is based on customer billing address not shipping address).\n\nAlso this fix may not help with the customer's first order.\n\nHope this helps some of you, staying tuned to other replies for a more waterproof fix."
