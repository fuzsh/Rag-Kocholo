        "text": "The bar is humming, tables are tightly packed and corks are popping. I am in Tenerife, but it is not happy hour in one of the package-tour southern resorts where more than two million Britons holiday each year. Rather, it is lunchtime and I am out with my cousin who lives in the capital Santa Cruz, a world (or about an hour-and-a-half) away from the aforementioned territory of laminated English-language menus.\n\nWe are underground in Nicomedes Pescaderia Marisquería, a fishmonger with a bar attached. It is located in the central market, Mercado Nuestra Señora de Africa. Customers are gesticulating at the seafood display and talking animatedly in Canarian dialect.\n\nFrom my first few minutes here, it is clear that Tenerife is so much more than a sunshine destination. It has an intriguing history, volcanic landscapes and some of Spain’s most exciting wines, as well as many dishes that are found only on the island.\n\nWe order greedily. There are lapas (grilled limpets), choco (cuttlefish) and pulpo (octopus) on the menu, all served a la plancha (grilled) without ceremony and with a little pot of green mojo – a sauce made using coriander, parsley, garlic and olive oil, which is gaining popularity in the UK.\n\nA bowl brimming with camarones – shrimps that are less than 1cm long – top things off. They are best enjoyed with garlicky olive oil that can then be mopped up with papas arrugadas, a dish of potatoes cooked in seawater and finished in a dry pan to leave their skins wrinkled and salty.\n\nOne fishmonger is brandishing a cutlass-like knife and carving up local red tuna, which we order as ceviche plus vieja, or parrotfish. Around the market’s exterior there are tiny stalls where chicharreros – a nickname for the city’s inhabitants, which is taken from the name of a local fish – pick at polpos and croquetas and sip small glasses of wine.\n\nSuperior sundowner\n\nCome evening, fish is still the main order in San Andrés, just by Playa Las Teresitas. This Saharan sand beach is ideal for a nearly-sundown swim and local rum cocktail, and is just 15 minutes by car or bus from the capital.\n\nMy cousin’s dinner recommendation is Los Pinchitos. We start with the crispiest, flakiest tortillitas de camarones (Andalusian shrimp fritters) and are spoilt for choice with langoustine brochettes, steamed mussels and pulpo salpicon, a salad of boiled octopus with green peppers, garlic and paprika and fried sardines.\n\nI learn that most villages with a fishing community have cofradia de pescadores – restaurants run by their fishing guilds. These establishments can be relied on for quality local fish and seafood and they cater primarily for Canarios.\n\nTenerife really is a nirvana for seafood lovers. Some of the sophisticated hotels down in the island’s south are dedicated to showcasing local and sustainable cuisine. Among them are the svelte Royal Hideaway Corales Beach, which has Frank Gehry-worthy curves.\n\nAt the ocean-facing Starfish Atlantic Grill, next to the pool at Royal Hideaway Corales Suites, I join a fish-tasting workshop. Here I am introduced to more unusual local catches, including morena frita (fried moray eel) with a mayonnaise made from the fish head and grilled cherne or stone bass as well as chiperones (baby squid) served encebollada – slow-cooked with onions.\n\nA local chef prepares escaldón de gofio according to his grandmother’s recipe. Gofio is toasted grains, usually wheat and corn. These ingredients have origins in the earliest known pre-conquest inhabitants of the island, the Guanche. They continue to be a popular ingredient not only in savoury dishes, but in desserts too.\n\nA fish broth is prepared, then some of the stock is mixed with gofio and crushed garlic and onion. The dish, with a texture rather like an Asian congee, is served with curls of red onion (to scoop it up with) and fiery, red mojo made with pimentón (Spanish smoked paprika) and chilli pepper, garlic and olive oil.\n\nSay cheese\n\nTenerife, I discover, also has plenty of its own cheeses, mostly goat and sheep. Starfish has a diverse range on its dedicated cheese trolley. I enjoy queso arica, a hard goat’s milk cheese with a reddish-brown rind. Its hue comes from the olive oil, paprika and gofi in which it is brushed. I’m less keen on the local favourite almogrote, an over-cured cheese, grated and pounded in a mortar with olive oil, garlic, chilli and paprika.\n\nFresh ingredients are bountiful on Tenerife. The combination of abundant sunshine hours, volcanic soils, water from Mount Teide and cooling trade winds make the island an ideal place to grow, including a huge variety of potatoes, tomatoes, corn, papaya, sugar cane (Tenerife rums are superb), and, of course, bananas. Most favoured are a smaller, sweeter variety known as platano canario.\n\nGrape vines have also been planted in Tenerife since before the New World explorations. The island’s position off the coast of Africa made it a vital staging post on long voyages from Europe to the Americas, including Columbus’s epic trip of 1492.\n\nMany of the vineyards are on precarious terraces. And, because Tenerife escaped phylloxera, the disease that blighted European vineyards in the mid-19th century, truly old vines are common. There are 82 varieties of grapes, 30 produced commercially. Among the wine estates is Suertes del Marques, which is credited with beginning Tenerife’s wine-making revolution in the late 90s.\n\nQuite apart from the exceptional wine, locals love frequenting the “Guachinche”, an inexpensive way to eat out that is found mostly in the north of Tenerife. Guachinche are pop-ups that are only allowed to operate where a local producer is serving their own wine. These are typically quaffable house wines, rather than award-winning cuvées. Guachinche are family-run and serve only traditional dishes, such as stews of Canarian chickpea with salted pork rib, chorizo, tomato, pepper, cumin and saffron.\n\nGuachinche El Surtidor, which is close to Santa Cruz, sits among vineyards and avocado trees and has a huge terrace, and is so widely popular that long waits are likely, especially on a Sunday.\n\nHere I enjoy the home-made food, served in huge quantities. Among the feast are croquetas, hunks of grilled lamb, a goat or bean stew, a huge Canarian style mixed salad complete with sweetcorn, and an almond dessert, such as Prince Alberto. It is hard to spend more than €15 a head. Just beyond the tourist hotspots, Tenerife offers so much more than laminated Spanglish menus – and at a reasonable price."
