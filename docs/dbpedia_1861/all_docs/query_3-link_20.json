        "text": "Cristiana Oliveira\n\nRector of Universidad Europea de Canarias.\n\nIt is with pride, but also with great responsibility, that I assume the role of Rector of Universidad Europea de Canarias. I am aware of the challenges that higher education currently faces in order to maintain its leading position in terms of its main value—excellence.\n\nSince opening, Universidad Europea de Canarias—based in La Orotava, Tenerife—has placed emphasis on its ability to face an educational environment marked by globalisation and the need for increased competitiveness, as well as advancements in technology, infrastructure and tools that open up new possibilities for methodological changes and business models.\n\n“We promote internationality with placements in renowned schools within the network and encourage the mobility of both students and professors.”\n\nCristiana Oliveira, General Director and Rector of Universidad Europea de Canarias\n\nSince it was established, Universidad Europea de Canarias has aimed to train professionals who are effectively prepared to respond to the demands of a global world, add value to their professions, and contribute to social progress with an entrepreneurial spirit and ethical integrity. To this end, we transfer knowledge through socially relevant applied research that further contributes to progress and places us at the forefront of intellectual and technical development.\n\nI am a fervent advocate of committing to the most varied ‘pedagogical’ projects that include diverse contents, formats, means of access and ways of producing knowledge. For this reason, Universidad Europea de Canarias challenges itself by adopting a broad mix of learning methodologies, standardising the use of digital technologies and virtual learning. Future professionals in today’s society require not only the best preparation in their chosen discipline, but also cross-disciplinary knowledge that will enable them to be competitive and competent.\n\nTo ensure that our students are optimally prepared, we advocate a model based on knowledge, skills and values. We are committed to this cross-disciplinary approach as an instrument for linking the educational sector with family and society, and to provide an integrated approach to our programmes in order to offer our students a holistic education.\n\nFurthermore, at Universidad Europea de Canarias, we prepare students for the current employment market. We do so by immersing students into the market through agreements with companies and public and private institutions. We promote internationality with placements in renowned schools within the group and encourage the mobility of both students and professors. University and society go hand-in-hand as we both share the same responsibility: to develop individuals who will better our future.\n\nIn this sense, the Canary Islands are an opportunity for the Universidad Europea. They are a multicultural territory where people of different roots meet and idiosyncrasies converge—this is akin to our university environment, which is comprised of unique beings who, together, form part of a global world.\n\nAnd this is where our entire community has come together in our commitment to establishing an academic institution that advances the European Higher Education Area through comprehensive university training that favours employability, social responsibility and knowledge generation.\n\nIt is the perfect combination, and that is why I am grateful for your both past efforts and your future enthusiasm as we continue advancing on our path."
