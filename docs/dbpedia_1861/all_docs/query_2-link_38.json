        "text": "The tourism sector is strongly influenced by market trends, for this reason an increase in economic activity requires greater demand for tourism, while a recession or economic crisis can lead to a very important downturn in this sector. In addition to the influence generated by the economy, global crisis scenarios, such as in the case of health care issues, produce a sharp drop in the number of tourists. The tourism sector cannot be considered as a homogeneous sector; in fact, several aspects could have consequences on the tourist flows , precisely due to the economic effects. The objective of this research is therefore to analyze the history of tourism development in the Canary Islands, which represents one of the destinations with the highest number of tourists. The research will help us to understand how, in the past, the tourism sector has reacted to various crisis scenarios with particularly effective answers, allowing us to imagine possible strategies, especially focused on br...\n\nBefore the economic crisis of 2008, Spain's tourism economy was held up as a global model of how to ascend the virtuous tourism “ladder” from budget beachfront package tours to more profitable cultural tourism that emphasizes art museums, cuisine, and heritage. This article examines how the maturation of the tourism industry in Spain became a symbol of democratization and European integration in the 1980s and 1990s. The piece then considers how the 2008 crisis challenged public confidence in the tourism economy due to the scale of the real estate crash, revelations of corruption and misappropriation of public funds, and crushing regional debt. Finally, it shows how the new political geography of Europe is divided between creditor countries, from the European core, that visit and debtor countries, in the Mediterranean, that are visited.\n\nThe outbreak of the Great Crisis in 2008 has awakened the interest in the role of crisis within social sciences. Nevertheless, broadly speaking, tourism studies have given very little attention to the moments of crisis. In the case of the Balearic Islands, while there are important works on the historical evolution of the tourist space, those tend to consider crises as blank moments. For this reason, this article focuses on the role played by crises in the production of the Balearics' space, by analyzing both moments of destruction and restructuring of the political economy. From the understanding of the different crises, from the Civil War to the present, we can conclude that the booms of the Balearic Islands are the indisputable fruit of those crises. El papel de las crisis en la producción, destrucción y reestructuración de los espacios turísticos. El caso de las Islas Baleares RESUMEN El estallido de la Gran Crisis en 2008 ha despertado la reflexión sobre las crisis en el seno de las ciencias sociales. Sin embargo, los estudios turísticos han prestado mayoritariamente poca atención a los momentos de crisis. Pese a que en el caso de las Islas Baleares hay importantes trabajos sobre la evolución histórica del espacio turístico, en estos las crisis suelen considerarse como momentos en blanco. Por ello, este artículo se centra en el papel que las crisis han jugado en la producción del espacio balear, analizando tanto los momentos de destrucción como los de reestructuración de la economía política. A partir de la comprensión de las diferentes crisis, desde la Guerra Civil hasta la actual, se concluye que los booms turísticos baleares son fruto indiscutible de aquellas crisis.\n\nTouristification refers to the multi-dimensional transformation of an area due to severe and rapid tourism intensification, which can harm that place's inhabitants in different ways. The activity's boom in the 2010s brought about an exponential increase in short-term tourist rentals (STRs) in traditionally non-tourist areas across cities worldwide, triggering or expanding displacement dynamics. The study delves into the connections between touristification and displacement and how the latter has conditioned neighbors' lives. As the health crisis abruptly stopped tourist hypermobility, we also question how displacement has been affected and the ways in which it might evolve in the post-pandemic city. We focus on Seville, the capital of Andalusia in southern Spain, a region highly dependent on the tourism and real estate sectors that has annually broken its visitors' records until the Covid-19 pandemic broke out. We reflect upon how local populations in central and increasingly tourist neighborhoods have experienced expulsion before and amidst the pandemic through thirty interviews with residents and displacees from different socioeconomic backgrounds in Seville's historic district. We conclude that the reconversion of STRs into long-term leases during and after the pandemic has resolved little compared with the damage already done.\n\nFrom its outset, the specialized literature in tourism fields has adamantly focused on the fragility of the industry. As it is best known, service sectors are inevitably sensitive to external or internal threats. Over decades, tourism research explored different academic paradigms in quest of answers to a pungent question: what is the future of the tourism industry? From different angles, scholars have devoted considerable time and effort to implement conceptual models to protect the tourism and hospitality industries. Nevertheless, the turn of the century witnessed a new stage of uncertainty, fear and anxiety for the West. Just after the attacks on the US in 2001, policymakers, practitioners and academicians enthusiastically adopted the risk perception theory as a valid guideline for understanding how the organic image of affected destinations can be protected. From that moment onwards, it was argued that the industry was in jeopardy because of countless global risks. These risks included political violence, terrorism, crime, natural disasters, and the environmental crisis, without mentioning virus outbreaks. It is difficult to resist the impression that these global dangers plausibly altered the forms of defining tourism as well as leisure activities worldwide. With the benefits of hindsight, far from being solved, these problems have certainly aggravated in the threshold of time. The radicalization of political violence, associated with an acceleration of climate change paved the pathways for the rise of new paradigms. Ultimately, experts agreed we live in a context of constant crisis. The concept of prevention or the precautionary doctrine (which illuminated scholars` works in past years) has very well set the pace for adaptation (adaptancy) as a main conceptual corpus of applied research today. New (morbid) forms of tourism have come to stay. Having said this, the present book, which gathers well-known and global experts specialized in the tourism crisis, explores not only the different crises the sector is facing but also its future in the years to come. The main argument toys with the belief that any crisis opens the doors to new opportunities, stages or moments that lead to the mutation of the industry. This book is recommended to post-graduate students, policy-makers, practitioners, and scholars who are interested in the turbulent times the tourism industry is going through."
