        "text": "This morning, join us for an optional excursion to Teide National Park. Created in 1954, it is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The last time the volcano erupted was in 1909. You’ll experience an astonishing view from the top of the crater, and you will be able to stroll around a bit to experience it all from different angles.\n\nThis afternoon, we’ll set off on an optional visit to Puerto de la Cruz to meander down the charming streets lined with gardens, beautiful homes, and quaint churches. We’ll stop at the Mirador de Humbolt, a lookout point with sweeping views of the Orotava Valley and its banana plantations before visiting the Orchid Garden Sitio Litre.\n\nWhen La Belle des Océans casts off for its cruise through the Canary Islands, our crew will welcome you on the Sun Deck for a cocktail. Join us for dinner and an evening of entertainment. Our ship will cruise to La Palma overnight.\n\nTake advantage of our morning at sea to attend a lecture.\n\nIn the afternoon, feel free to join us for an optional excursion to the heart of the island. We'll hit the road to the Caldera de Taburiente for some spectacular views. First, we'll visit the Santuario de Nuestra Señora de Las Nieves, a lovely whitewashed sanctuary housing the venerated Virgin of the Snows. Our tour will then take us along mountain roads and through extraordinary scenery to the Caldera de Taburiente. We'll stop at a traditional 17th-century farm—surrounded by gorgeous gardens and breathtaking views—for a refreshing snack. On the way back, a brief stop at the Mirador de la Concepcion overlook will give you an impressive view of the coast and northern part of the island.\n\nOur ship will cruise to La Gomera overnight.\n\nWe'll spend the morning cruising. Take advantage of a quiet moment on LA BELLE DES OCEANS to catch some rays poolside or enjoy a treatment in our wellness salon. More active passengers can keep in shape in the fitness center, and history buffs can attend the lecture in the lounge.\n\nJoin us for an optional excursion to the island of La Gomera this afternoon. We'll visit Garajonay National Park, which is blanketed with thick, bay-tree forests. This UNESCO World Heritage Site offers a striking contrast to the rest of the archipelago. The park sits under an almost constant haze of fog from the trade winds and the surrounding waters, which gives it an eerie atmosphere. We'll pass through the quaint villages of Hermigua, Las Rosas, and Agulo—whose sweet charm led to the nickname \"The Bonbon of La Gomera.\" We'll stop for a typical island tea time and listen to a demonstration of Silbo Gomero, the whistled language used by the islanders. We'll enter Garajonay National Park to see the Roque Agando rock formation, the symbol of the island, jutting far above the greenery of the forests.\n\nOur ship will cruise to Gran Canaria. We'll enjoy dinner and an evening of entertainment.\n\nWe set out on an optional excursion to Las Palmas and the Bandama Caldera. We'll begin in old-time Vegueta and the Casa de Colon, a colonial-style mansion with exhibits about the history of the Canary Islands and their link with the New World. We'll continue on to the Bandama Caldera, a volcanic crater that reaches 1,867 feet above sea level (569 m).\n\nIn the afternoon, join us for an optional excursion to Teror and the Garden of La Marquesa de Arucas. Teror is a place of pilgrimage for all the island's inhabitants as it houses the statue of the patron saint of the island in its basilica, the Virgen del Pino. Afterwards, we'll head to Arucas, one of the most beautiful cities in Gran Canaria. We'll see the outside of the imposing, black cathedral and visit the lovely Garden of La Marquesa de Arucas, home to 400 species of tropical and subtropical plants.\n\nOur ship will cast off for Fuerteventura. In celebration of our last cruise through the Canary Islands, join our crew on the Sun Deck for a cocktail together. Tonight is our festive gala evening.\n\nJoin us for an optional excursion called \"The Secrets of Fuerteventura.\" We'll begin towards the northern part of the island at the Finca Torres, where we'll discover how local goat cheese is made. The internationally renowned goat cheeses produced in Fuerteventura have been awarded the highest \"Golden Cheese Award\" for five consecutive years. At the end of our tour, we'll enjoy a tasting of this famous delicacy. We'll then continue on to the small village of Tiscamanita to visit a cosmetics producer who uses aloe vera, one of the most prominent crops on the island. You'll learn everything you'll need to know about this surprising plant. Lastly, we'll experience Betancuria, the island's first colony and former capital. French explorer Jean de Béthencourt founded Betancuria at the beginning of the 15th century. He chose the area within the valley to be protected from pirate attacks. Despite his strategy, pirates razed the village in 1593.\n\nWe'll spend the afternoon cruising to Lanzarote. Lecture.\n\nThis morning, join us for an optional excursion to Timanfaya National Park. Lanzarote is truly a unique place. Seventy-five percent of the island’s surface is covered with craters and lava flows dating back to massive volcanic eruptions 270 years ago. The Fire Mountains in the park possess a singular beauty. At the heart of the stone and rock vineyards in Geria, we’ll enjoy a tasting of wine and cheese at one of the oldest bodegas on the island. This afternoon, join us for an optional excursion to learn about César Manrique, one of the most important artists in the Canary Islands. Jameos del Agua is the art, culture, and tourism center where his talents can be experienced firsthand. Afterwards, we’ll head to the Mirador del Rio to take in the outstanding views of the moon-like landscape. Lastly, we’ll visit the César Manrique House Museum, an incarnation of his talents. For the last evening on board, enjoy the show of traditional songs in the Salon and Bar."
