        "text": "A British woman living on the island of La Palma was given 10 minutes to pack her possessions and memories into a car as molten rock and lava bore down on her family home after a volcanic eruption.\n\n“The lava is passing through it now,” Nikki Batley, 46, told i on Wednesday afternoon as she choked back tears. “My house will be under lava in the next two three hours, I never thought this would happen.”\n\nMs Batley lives in Todoque, the last village between the lava still spewing from Sunday’s volcanic eruption and the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nShe ran from her house with her son, 11, and her 81-year-old mother-in-law when the Cumbre Vieja volcano erupted. “We got out really fast and left everything behind. It was terrifying, I honestly have never in my entire life felt so terrified,” she said.\n\n“When the mouth of the volcano opened, it is literally directly above us, I was on the phone to my dad, it felt like a big earthquake.\n\n“My partner immediately called saying, it’s exploded, it’s right above where you are, get out now. I had to get my mother-in-law, keep her calm, get my dog and my son and we legged it.”\n\nEnglish teacher Ms Batley has lived in La Palma since 1998 after moving from Harlow in Essex. She met her partner, Pedro Castro Ramos, 15 years ago and they live with their son, John Castro Batley, in Mr Ramos’s mother’s childhood home.\n\nAs lava gushed from the Canary Islands’ first volcanic eruption on land in 50 years, Ms Batley could do nothing but watch helplessly as magma oozed towards her home.\n\n“We were terrified, we didn’t know how fast the lava was going to come out or down or whether we’d be piled down with big rocks,” she said.\n\n“My son was in a panic and my mother-in-law was in such a state. That was her house that she grew up in.\n\n“I was trying to drive out of there with my eyes filled with tears, I was trying to hold it together and not lose it in front of my boy.\n\n“As we started to drive away we saw this huge tower of billowing smoke going up with a lot of force.”\n\nShe said the “frightening spectacle” of the lava was more visible at night and the family could see a “big chimney of black smoke coming up.”\n\nThey are among 6,000 locals and tourists evacuated as lava slowly creeps towards the sea, having already destroyed at least 190 houses.\n\nThe family was able to return briefly on Tuesday after authorities allowed them 10 minutes to salvage their belongings. “Our life was whatever we could fit into a Berlingo car,” Ms Batley said.\n\nThe family are staying at the apartment of a friend of a friend, which they must leave at the end of the month. After that, Ms Batley said, they may have to sleep in their car.\n\nShe, like many other islanders she has spoken to, does not have home insurance. Her son’s school is near her house and “if my house goes, his school will go too”.\n\n“We don’t know what we are going to do, we have to start again from zero,” she said. “If by some miracle the lava stops and the house is saved, we won’t be able to go back for months because the lava has blocked off the road. There’s a foot of ash everywhere and we can’t breathe in the smoke.”\n\nWhat is Cumbre Vieja?\n\nCumbre Vieja is an active volcano in the southern part of La Palma island. It forms a ridge which is 1,949m (6,394ft) high at its tallest point, running roughly north-south. It has several craters on its summit ridge and flanks. It erupted twice in the 20th century, in 1949 and again in 1971.\n\nOn Wednesday experts said the lava could take several more days to cover the remaining 2km to the sea, as it advances at a rate of 200m per hour.\n\n“The lava is moving so slowly it’s painstaking to watch it, you don’t know if it’s going to stop or pass through and destroy your house,” Ms Batley said.\n\n“Nobody has been hurt, which, at the end of the day, is the most important thing. But everything that we have worked for and built up over the years in this house has gone.”"
