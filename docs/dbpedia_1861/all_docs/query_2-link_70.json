        "text": "The Port of San Sebastian de La Gomera has been historically considered by many authors as the best in the Canary Islands. His point was the landing trim behind the Punta del Buen Paso [Good Pass Cape], the Jila Bay, which protected the Northeast winds or trade winds, particularly noticeable in summer, and allowed jump ashore directly. There was built in 1952 the current dock-wharf of the port. In this, the yacht harbour occupies the northern half of the Jila Bay, while much of the levee-wharf of the port has been completed on the South half of the Jila Bay. The ferry docking point, where archaeological materials recovered, comes from the area that would be the main anchorage for galleons and frigates in the XV-XVIII centuries, as seen in the two planes of Lope de Mendoza (1662 - 66). The underwater ceramic set is surprisingly homogeneous, even perhaps a possible wreck, with a timeline between 1450-1525, and possible extensions to 1600, coinciding with the first visits of Christopher Columbus to La Gomera from 1492 to 1498. Key words: La Gomera, Port of San Sebastian, underwater survey, wheel made pottery, XV-XVI centuries.\n\nEn este trabajo se presentan los resultados de los análisis realizados sobre los res-tos arqueofaunísticos, tanto de vertebrados e invertebrados, recuperados en el sitio Laguna del Telégrafo, ubicado en la localidad arqueológica Cabo Blanco (costa norte de Santa Cruz, Patagonia argentina). Este sitio se encuentra emplazado en el borde de una antigua planicie de mareas que actualmente constituye una laguna temporaria. Se trata de un conchero de pequeñas dimensiones en el cual se excavaron 2 m 2 , y cuya antigüedad es de ca. 2300 años AP. Durante las tareas de excavación se identificó una lente de valvas en posición subsuperficial, en la cual se recuperaron gran cantidad de restos faunísticos (óseos y malacológicos), líticos y antracológicos, así como también un nudo de cuero. Se analiza y discute la posible funcionalidad del sitio y las características formacionales del depósito arqueológico. / / In this paper we present the results of archaeofaunal remains analysis from both vertebrates and invertebrates, recovered from the Laguna del Telégrafo site, located in the Cabo Blanco archaeological area (North coast of Santa Cruz, Argentine Patagonia). This site is situated on the edge of an ancient tidal plain, which exists today as a seasonal lagoon. The site is a small shell midden dating to c. 2300 BP. A 2 m 2 test-pit was excavated revealing a dense subsurface lens of shells from which a great quantity of faunal (bone and malacological), lithic and anthracological remains were recovered, including a leather knot. Here we analyze and discuss the possible function of the site as well as the formational characteristics of the archaeological deposit.\n\nIn aboriginal times, the low bed of the ravine of Saint Andrew or Abicore, and las Huertas or Ibaute, which fall into Saint Andrew, was the residence of King of Anaga as two distribution of land licenses of 1517 and 1518, with potential irrigated land in La Rosetta, at the foot of the southern slope of the hill of El Cerrillar, next to the current Suculún neighbourhood, where the King cave could be. In its vicinity, the main burial cave of Anaga, with more than 50 individuals, was located oceanfront, on the right bank of the ravine of Saint Andrew. Among several mummified remains, highlight a well preserved mummy of an adult man about 25 or 30 years old, MVC 1-M49, which comes from the former collection of the Scientific Cabinet of Tenerife. The importance of the anchorage of Saint Andrew was the presence of water in the ravine throughout the year, abundance of wood, and in particular, because to approach the port of Santa Cruz de Tenerife it was necessary to go sailing along the coast from Saint Andrew anchorage. Therefore was build a circular guard tower in 1706, rebuilt in 1769, where the Terror bombard sank during the defense against Nelson's fleet in July 1797. This small boat could not be found during the underwater archaeological survey in 2011, perhaps because we only studied the western sector of anchorage. Key words: Tenerife, Chiefdom of Anaga, Guanches, Archaeological Survey, Anchorage of Saint Andrew.\n\nAlthough the second half of the 19th century was the time of the greatest number of mummy discoveries on the island of Tenerife, with a minimum of 50 individuals, most of them were not the result of scientific archaeological investigations. The beginning of the activity of the Scientific Cabinet of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, directed by Dr. Bethencourt Alfonso, with field work mainly between 1875-85, led to the recovery of numerous skulls, but very few mummies, except for fragmented specimens from El Chorrillo (El Rosario) and Araya (Candelaria), together with an infant mummy from the Barranco del Infierno (Adeje). On occasions he must have examined them in private collections, as happened with a mummy from the Cuevas del Roque in Las Cañadas del Teide or several from the Juan Luis ravine in La Ladera (Güímar), but he does not provide additional information on the owners or if the mummies were sold abroad. The promulgation of the Archaeological Excavations Law in July 1911 did not prevent the collection of some 50 burials from the San Andrés cave by Albert Hooton in July 1915 and others in the south of Tenerife, nor their illegal export to Boston to the Peabody Museum at Harvard University, but it caused a controversy in the press and the Civil Governor ordered for the first time the confiscation of the remains and the prohibition of their export. Keywords: Tenerife, mummies, guanche, nineteenth century, antique collecting. Aunque la segunda mitad del siglo xix fue el momento de mayor número de hallazgos de momias en la isla de Tenerife, con un mínimo de 50 individuos, la mayor parte de ellos no fueron resultado de investigaciones arqueológicas científicas. El inicio de la actividad del Gabinete Científico de Santa Cruz de Tenerife, dirigido por el doctor Bethencourt Alfonso, con trabajos de campo principalmente entre 1875-1885, propició recuperar numerosos cráneos, pero muy pocas momias, salvo ejemplares fragmentados de El Chorrillo (El Rosario) y Araya (Candelaria), junto con una momia infantil del barranco del Infierno (Adeje). En ocasiones las debió examinar en colecciones privadas, como sucedió con una momia de las Cuevas del Roque en Las Cañadas del Teide o con varias del barranco de Juan Luis en La Ladera (Güímar). Palabras clave: Tenerife, momias, guanches, siglo xix, coleccionismo de antigüedades.\n\nThe port of Santa Cruz de Añazo has its origin in the foundation around 1465-66 of a nearby tower at the mouth of the ravine of Araguygo or Santos. The anchoring area was located in La Caleta, sometimes called Blas Díaz from the mid-sixteenth century or as anchoring of the Aduana –Customs- in the second half of the eighteenth century. Next to La Caleta, a small pier was built in 1513 at its western end. Since the construction of a castle in 1577, it was forbidden to anchor inside La Caleta, and only allowed inside if there was a storm. The pier was moved to the eastern end of La Caleta in the Riviere project of 1740, completed in 1753. It was extended and its direction changed with the Clavijo project of 1848, finalized in 1863. The old anchorage was filled in 1908, and lost for underwater archeology, and the castle of San Cristóbal –Saint Christopher- was demolished in 1928. On the other hand, since 1911 dredging has been done in the port. The underwater geophysical survey with side-scan sonar conducted in 2016 could not detect submerged metallic elements such as cannons of a wreck. The last finds of iron cannons in the port are not submarines, but they come mostly from artillery pieces located in the surroundings of the old castle of San Cristobal. Key words: Tenerife, port of Santa Cruz, historical evolution, geophysical underwater survey, wheel made pottery, XVI-XVIII centuries, iron cannons\n\nIn November of 1997 was developed an underwater archaeological survey in the Beach of San Blas (Candelaria, Tenerife, Canary Islands), where were detected sherds of olive jars of the centuries XVI-XVIII A.D. and, as of depths of -2.5 m., remains of rectangular stone blocks, from the structure of the Castle of San Pedro. The castle was dragged by a storm the 7-November-1826, to be overflowed the waters of the Barranco de Tapia, that also levelled the convent of the Dominicos and the provisional chapel of the Virgin of Candelaria with its image. Key Words: Underwater Archaeology. Survey. Olive Jar"
