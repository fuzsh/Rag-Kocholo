        "text": "Province of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, also Province of Santa Cruz (Spanish: Provincia de Santa Cruz de Tenerife), is a province of Spain, consisting of the western part of the autonomous community of the Canary Islands. It consists of about half of the Atlantic archipelago: the islands of Tenerife, La Gomera, El Hierro, and La Palma. It occupies an area of 3,381 km2 (1,305 sq mi). It also includes a series of adjacent roques (those of Salmor, Fasnia, Bonanza, Garachico and Anaga).\n\nIts capital is the city of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (commonly known as Santa Cruz), on the island of Tenerife (Spain's most populous island). At the start of 2023 the province had 1,067,173 inhabitants and a density of 315.6 /km2, making it the province of Spain with the sixth highest population density, higher than that of the province of Las Palmas (the eastern half of the Canary Islands). 19.6% live in the capital, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, which is also the capital of the Autonomous Community of the Canary Islands. There are 54 municipalities in the province; see List of municipalities in Santa Cruz de Tenerife. Tenerife is the most populated island of the Canary Islands and most populous island of Spain. The island of Tenerife has the highest altitude of Spain (Teide 3718 m).\n\nEarlier issued vehicle license plates in this province bear the first two letters \"TF\" (named after Tenerife). Nowadays the plates share the same numbering system as in mainland Spain."
