In simple terms, Blepharoplasty is a cosmetic surgery that alters the appearance of the eyelids. This type of surgery can be used to correct drooping upper eyelids or puffy bags under the eyes. It is important to note that Blepharoplasty is not just a vanity procedure – it can also improve vision in some cases. If you are considering this type of surgery, be sure to consult with a board-certified plastic surgeon to discuss your options.\n\nOtoplasty\n\nOtoplasty is a surgical procedure often used to correct structural abnormalities of the ear. Angular or protruding ears can be brought closer to the head, and skin defects can also be corrected. This procedure can be performed on children as young as five, and the results are usually permanent.\n\nRhinoplasty\n\nRhinoplasty, or a \"nose job,\" is a surgical procedure to change the shape of your nose. This can be done for aesthetic reasons, or to improve breathing function. Rhinoplasty can involve changing the size and shape of the nose bone, as well as the soft tissues.\n\nBichectomy\n\nBichectomy is typically performed to correct facial asymmetry. The surgery involves making incisions in the buccal fat pads. These fat pads are located in the cheek area. The surgery is performed under general anesthesia.\n\nMiniLifting\n\nMiniLifting is the perfect way to refreshen your appearance without surgery or needles. It's a quick and easy procedure that can be done in the comfort of your own home.\n\nLipofilling\n\nLipofilling is a minimally invasive, minimally tissue-reactive autologous fat grafting procedure in which fat is extracted from one area of the body using gentle liposuction, purified, and then injected into another area to fill in wrinkles, lines, or creases. This innovative technique can help improve the appearance of problem areas on the face and body without the need for more drastic measures like surgery.\n\nHigh Definition Lipo\n\nHigh Definition Lipo is a cutting-edge cosmetic procedure that can help you achieve the perfectly sculpted body you've always wanted. High Definition Lipo uses state-of-the-art technology to target and remove unwanted fat cells from specific areas of the body. By targeting problem areas and providing targeted sculpting and contouring, High Definition Lipo can give you the results you desire with minimal downtime.\n\nBreast Surgery\n\nMany women choose to have breast surgery to improve their appearance. Breast surgery can be used to augment the bust or reduce its size. Some women opt for breast surgery after having children, while others do it for cosmetic reasons. No matter the reason, breast surgery can be a life-changing experience.\n\nBreast Augmentation\n\nBreast Reduction\n\nFemale Intimate Surgery\n\nFemale intimate surgery is something that many women feel sensitive about. It can be a tough decision to make, but ultimately it is a very personal choice. Every woman deserves to feel confident and comfortable in her own body, and if surgery is what it takes to achieve that, then it is definitely worth considering.\n\nLabiaplasty\n\nReduction of the Mount of Venus\n\nHymenoplasty\n\nHere you can find real Patient Reviews for Plastic Surgery in Spain by Instituto de Cirugia Avanzada:\n\nSanty Abreu\n\n“I want to especially recommend the Institute of Advanced Surgery for its clear commitment to the patient and its professionalism.
