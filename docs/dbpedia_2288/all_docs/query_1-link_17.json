        "text": "Karl Eusebius (11 April 1611 – 5 April 1684) was the Prince of Liechtenstein. He inherited this title in 1627 from his father Karl I. He was 16 and thus considered underage, and his uncles Prince Gundakar and Maximillian acted as regents until 1632. From 1639 to 1641 Karl was Chief Captain of High and Low Silesia.\n\nAfter the Thirty Years' War Karl effectively restored his dominions economically. Karl was also an extensive patron of architecture of the period. He formed the early plans for Plumlov Castle, which in fact his son the future Hans-Adam I oversaw the construction of.\n\nHe died in Schwarzkosteletz.\n\nMarriage and issue\n\nKarl married his niece, Princess Johanna Beatrix von Dietrichstein-Nikolsburg (c. 1625 – 26 March 1676) on 6 August 1644. They had nine children:"
