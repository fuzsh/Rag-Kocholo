        "text": "Francia Orientalis, Germany\n\nThe German Confederation, 1815-1866\n\nBelieve it or not, the Congress of Vienna (1814-1815) greatly simplified the political division of Germany. The Holy Roman Empire of 1648 contained 234 territorial units, with 51 Free Cities, and multiple ecclesiastical states, like the great Archbishoprics of Salzburg, Magdeburg, and Trier and the Bishopric of Münster. Nevertheless, the 32 entities that remained after Vienna (with only 4 Free Cities and no ecclesiastical territories) were still a mess. The \"German Confederation\" established by the Congress (which makes it sound like the successor of Napoleon's \"Confederation of the Rhine\"), with exactly the same boundaries as the Empire of 1648, had even less power than the state that, according to Voltaire, was neither Holy, nor Roman, nor an Empire. As an institution the Confederation collapsed when Prussia and Austria went to war in 1866. All the pieces, except for Austria itself, Liechtenstein, and Luxembourg, were then scooped up by Prussia into the new German Empire of 1871. The maps here are based on E.J. Passant, A Short History of Germany, 1815-1945 [Cambridge University Press, 1962]. Some errors in Passant are corrected with sources listed at individual listings. At this scale some detail is lost: There is even more fragmenation than what you see here (e.g. Brunswick was in seven pieces, not just five). Note that in each map, territories in yellow are possessions of non-German states.\n\nEmpire of Austria\n\nThe Austrian Empire was self-proclaimed by the Hapsburgs after Napoleon crowned himself Emperor in 1804. Since Napoleon already was obviously not going to allow the election of another Hapsburg as Holy Roman Emperor, and actually did abolish the Empire in 1806, they were one step ahead of him.\n\nKingdom of Prussia, creates German Empire, 1871\n\nKingdom of Bavaria, joins German Empire, 1871\n\nKingdom of Saxony, joins German Empire, 1871\n\nKingdom of Hanover, to Prussia, 1866\n\nKingdom of Württemberg, joins German Empire, 1871\n\nSince the original mediaeval Empire was based on the Kingdom of the East Franks, it never made any sense that there would be other kingdoms inside it. Bohemia was acquired and created a Kingdom by the German Emperors, perhaps with the sense that it was still in some sense external to East Francia; and the Margrave of Brandenburg became the King of Prussia, far outside the Empire. The other Kingdoms were all created either by Napoleon or by the Congress of Vienna after the Holy Roman Empire was abolished. The Kingdom of Saxony suffered the most at the Congress of Vienna, penalized by Prussia for having been an ally of France. Bavaria, although it had been an ally of France also, did rather well at Vienna, retaining the family lands in both the Rhenish and the Upper Palatinate and the extensive lands that had been attached to it by Napoleon. The King of Hanover was also the King of England until 1837, when the Salic Law passed over Queen Victoria. Later this left Hanover, as an ally of Austria, at the mercy of Prussia.\n\nElectorate of Hesse-Cassel, to Prussia, 1866\n\nNapoleon made the Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel an Elector of the Holy Roman Empire in 1803. Since this was a much better title than Landgrave, the ruler of Hesse-Cassel got it recognized at the Congress of Vienna. So, until 1866, there was still one Elector of the non-existent Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nGrand Duchy of Baden, joins German Empire, 1871\n\nGrand Duchy of Hesse-Darmstadt, joins German Empire, 1871\n\nGrand Duchy of Luxembourg, Netherlands; independent, 1890\n\nGrand Duchy of Mecklenburg, joins German Empire, 1871\n\nGrand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar, joins German Empire, 1871\n\nGrand Duchy of Oldenburg, joins German Empire, 1871\n\nLuxembourg lost half its territory when Belgium became independent in 1830. Then in 1890 the Salic Law prevented Queen Wilhelmina from inheriting the Duchy and it became independent. Later, the Salic Law was simply set aside, and two Grand Duchesses have since ruled. The area of Belgium derived from Luxemboug is still called \"Luxembourg,\" which is an interesting situation given, for instance, the objection of Greece to Macedonia calling itself \"Macedonia,\" which the Greeks say implies a claim on Greek Macedonia. So, does Luxembourg claim Belgian Luxembourg, or does Belgium claim all of Luxembourg? I'm confused.\n\nDuchies of Holstein and Lauenburg, Denmark; to Austria, 1864; to Prussia, 1866\n\nDuchy of Brunswick, joins German Empire, 1871\n\nDuchy of Saxe-Gotha, passes to Saxe-Coburg, 1826\n\nDuchy of Saxe-Coburg, joins German Empire, 1871\n\nDuchy of Saxe-Meiningen, joins German Empire, 1871\n\nDuchy of Saxe-Hildburghausen, passes to Saxe-Meiningen, 1826\n\nDuchy and Principality of Nassau, Usingen, & Nassau-Weilburg, to Prussia, 1866\n\nThe Duchies of Holstein and Lauenburg were ruled by Denmark, together with the Danish Duchy of Schleswig, which contained both German and Danish speakers. Prussia and Austria occupied the Duchies in 1864, with Austria taking Holstein and Prussia Schleswig. A falling out over this led to the Prussian defeat of Austria in 1866, with Prussia taking all the Duchies. Part of Schleswig was returned to Denmark after World War I, when a plebiscite was mandated by the Treaty of Versailles. A son of the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, Albert, married Queen Victoria of England. Their daughter Victoria married the future Emperor Frederick of Germany. They became the parents of Emperor Wilhelm II.\n\nDuchies of Anhalt (Dessau, Bernburg, & Köthen), united 1863, joins German Empire, 1871\n\nPrincipality of Schwarzburg, joins German Empire, 1871\n\nPrincipality of Hohenzollern, ceded to Prussia, 1849\n\nPrincipality of Liechtenstein, independent, 1866\n\nPrincipality of Waldeck, joins German Empire, 1871\n\nPrincipality of Reuß, joins German Empire, 1871\n\nPrincipality of Lippe (Schaumburg & Detmold), joins German Empire, 1871\n\nLangravate of Hesse-Homburg, to Hesse-Darmstadt then Prussia, 1866\n\nPrincipality of Layen (?!), to Baden, 1814\n\nLiechtenstein discovered, to everyone's surprise, that it was one of the Allies in World War II, because it had never formally ended hostilities, as an ally of Austria, against Prussia in 1866. Passant [A Short History of Germany, 1815-1945] shows some mistakes when it comes to these states. His source, which he says is a map, The German Confederated States [London, 1839], must have contained the errors: (1) What he shows as the \"Principalities\" of Anhalt had become Duchies in 1806/7; (2) What he shows as the \"Principality\" of Hesse-Homberg was never a Principality but only a Landgravate; and (3) The Principality of Layen, listed by Passant, is not actually shown on the map. This curiosity is treated under the entry in question. The 1839 map was evidently not quite up to date with some of the small domains.\n\nFree City of Lübeck, joins German Empire, 1871\n\nFree City of Hamburg, joins German Empire, 1871\n\nFree City of Bremen, joins German Empire, 1871\n\nFree City of Frankfurt-am-Main, to Prussia, 1866\n\nThere had been 51 Free Cities under the Holy Roman Empire. Vienna cut this down to four. Frankfurt held a special status, both as the place of the election of the old Emperors (of their coronation too, after Ferdinand I, and of their portraits, held in the Römer Saal), and as the headquarters of the German Confederation, where a German National Assembly was convened in 1848. The triumph of Prussia ended both Frankfurt's independence and its status. I would like to know why, when West Germany needed a more practical capital than the isolated Berlin, it choose the obscure Bonn rather than Frankfurt, whose historical associations were not only of mediaeval Germany, but of liberal and republican movements in the 19th century. Now, with a reunited Germany, the capital has returned to Berlin, whose associations are entirely of Prussia, Kaiser, and Hitler. See more about Frankfurt under the Rothschild's. Lübeck, Hamburg, and Bremen were the final members of the Hanseatic League, was finally abolished in 1862.\n\nStem Duchies Index\n\nFrancia Index\n\nPhilosophy of History\n\nHome Page\n\nCopyright (c) 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2011, 2016, 2018, 2019 Kelley L. Ross, Ph.D. All Rights Reserved\n\nCounts & Dukes of Berg,\n\nJülich, Mark, & Cleves\n\nThis collection of small Counties that become small Duchies straddles the border between the Stem Duchies of Saxony and Lower Lorraine. Cleves and Jülich are along or to the west of the Rhine, in Lower Lorraine, while the Mark, Berg, and Ravensberg are further inland, in Saxony. Ravenstein was a small territory on the Maas completely surrounded by the United Provinces of the Netherlands. They are treated together because they do become unified through marriage and then, as a whole, became a matter of serious political conflict when the Duke John William died in 1609. There were no male heirs, and the Emperor Rudolf II claimed the lands as defaulted to the Empire. He sent an army under the Archduke Leopold to occupy them. But this was disputed by John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg, whose mother was John William's sister, and William Wolfgang, Duke of Neuburg, whose mother was another sister. John Sigismund was a Lutheran and William Wolfgang a Calvinist. They pooled their resources, rallied the Protestants (and, well, the French), and managed to expel the Austrians. Their agreement was to share the rule of the Duchies. But they had a falling out. William Wolfgang converted to Catholicism and drew Bavaria and the Catholic League of German princes in on his side. John Sigismund countered by switching to Calvinism, which was more to the liking of Dutch and French Protestants. Despite these maneuvers, the business was settled in 1614 with a provisional partition, Cleves, Mark, and Ravensberg going to Brandenburg, Jülich and Cleves to Neuberg. This was made permanent in 1666. Besides looking something like a preliminary skirmish for the Thirty Years War, this transaction is of interest because it gave Brandenburg, soon to be the Kingdom of Prussia, a foothold on the Rhine. Neuberg was of the House of Wittelsbach, heirs of the Palatinate and Bavaria, all of whose lands would be united in 1777. From the Congress of Vienna, Prussia took away all the lands on both sides of the lower Rhine. One might also note that Anne of Cleves, the 4th wife of King Henry VIII of England, was an aunt of the Duke John William.\n\nThe genealogy of Cleves, etc. was complied mainly from the Erzählende genealogische Stammtafeln zur europäischen Geschichte, Volume I, Part 2, Deutsche Kaiser-, Königs-, Herzogs- und Grafenhäuser II [Andreas Thiele, Third Edition, R. G. Fischer Verlag, 1997, pp.599-613], with some details from other volumes. The discussion of the succession dispute draws on The Rise of Brandenburg-Prussia to 1786, by Sidney B. Fay & Klaus Epstein [1937, Holt, Rinehart & Winston, 1964].\n\nGerman Confederation Index\n\nStem Duchies Index\n\nFrancia Index\n\nCounts, Dukes & Kings\n\nof Württemberg Louis ICount,\n\n1137-1181 Emich1137-1154 Henry1181-1201 Louis II1201-1228 Eberhard1228-1241 Ulrich I1241-1265 Ulrich II1265-1279 Eberhard I\n\nthe Illustrious1279-1325 Ulrich III1325-1344 Eberhard II\n\nthe Whiner1344-1392 Ulrich IV1344-1366 Eberhard III\n\nthe Mild1392-1417 Eberhard IV1417-1419 Louis IUrach,\n\n1419-1441,\n\nd.1450 Ulrich V1419-1480 Eberhard V,\n\nI as DukeUrach,\n\n1457-1496 Duke,\n\n1495-1496 Eberhard VI,\n\nII as Duke1480-1498 Duke,\n\n1496-1498,\n\nd.1504 Ulrich I1498-1519,\n\n1534-1550 Austria, 1519-1534 Christopher1550-1568 Louis III\n\nthe Pious1568-1593 Frederick I1593-1608 John\n\nFrederick1608-1628 Eberhard III1628-1674 William Louis1674-1677 Eberhard IV\n\nLouis1677-1733 Charles I\n\nAlexander1733-1737 Charles II\n\nEugene1737-1793 Louis Eugene1793-1795 Frederick II1795-1797 Frederick\n\n(III)Duke,\n\n1797-1806;\n\nElector,\n\n1803-1806 King,\n\n1806-1816 Ludwig\n\nFrederick\n\nAlexanderDuke,\n\n1806-1817 William I1816-1864 Charles1864-1891 German Empire, 1871 William II1891-1918,\n\nd.1921\n\nPrinces of Liechtenstein Charles1608-1627 Gundakar1623-1658 Hartman1658-1686 John (Johann/Hans)\n\nAdam I1699-1712 Joseph Wenzel1712-1718,\n\n1748-1772 Anthony Florian1718-1721 Joseph John Adam1721-1732 John Nepomonk Charles1732-1748 Franz Josef I1772-1781 Aloysius I1781-1805 John I1805-1836 Aloysius II1836-1858 John II the Good1858-1929 Independent, 1866 Franz1929-1938 Franz Josef II1938-1989 John III Adam/\n\nHans Adam II1989-\n\nLiechtenstein, tucked away in the Alps between Switzerland and Austria, in the Valley of Rhine before it flows into Lake Constance, was the only small German state to avoid getting swept up into the German Empire. Hitler might have added it to the Third Reich, but perhaps he overlooked it.\n\nThe Principality is hardly of strategic significance. But when World War I ended, Liechtenstein, to the astonishment of all, came to be counted among the Allies; for its declaration of war against Prussia in 1866 and never formally been ended by any treaty. Strictly speaking, it had been at war with Prussia, grown into Germany, ever since. Meanwhile, its greatest claim to fame seems to have largely come from its postage stamps.\n\nThe original flag of Liechtenstein, adopted officially in 1921, is in the bicolor form that is so familiar from German States (and even European states like Poland, Monaco, and San Marino). At the 1936 Olympics, however, the Liechtensteiners were suprised to discover that their flag was identical to that of Haiti. The crown was therefore added in 1937. The Haitians also modified their flag.\n\nThe Heir of Liechtenstein, Aloys (or Alois), has married an heiress, Sophie, of the Wittelsbachs. While the Princes of Liechtenstein are certainly venerable enough, the Wittelsbachs are another matter altogether. But Sophie also happens to be in the line of descent of the British House of Stuart, making her son by Alois, Joseph Wenzel, the Heir of Stuart claims to the British Throne.\n\nWürttemberg, the heart of the old Duchy of Swabia, seems to have avoided most of the spotlight of history. In 1803, Napoleon made it an Electorate of the Holy Roman Empire but then, when he abolished the Empire in 1806, the Duchy was elevated to a Kingdom. Having gone along with the French Empire, Württemberg then went along with the German Empire in 1871, and the Kings survived until all the princely states were abolished in 1918. In modern Germany, the flag of the State of Baden-Württemberg combines the upper black stripe of Württemberg and the lower yellow stripe of Baden.\n\nThe genealogy for some of the last Dukes and most of the Kings of Württemberg highlights a connection to the British Royal Family. Queen Mary of Teck, of the House of Württemberg, wife of King George V, was also a great-granddaugher of King George III, through her mother. The great Queen Mary oceanliner, now permanently docked in Long Beach, California, is named after Mary of Teck. The story is that the President of the Cunard line told King George V that their new ship would be name after the most illustrious Queen in British history, meaning Elizabeth I. However, King George then thanked him and said that Queen Mary would be flattered. So the Cunard line named the ship after Mary.\n\nThe list for Württemberg was taken entirely from Brian Tompsett's Royal and Noble genealogy. The genealogy for Württemberg was from the Erzählende genealogische Stammtafeln zur europäischen Geschichte, Volume I, Part 2, Deutsche Kaiser-, Königs-, Herzogs- und Grafenhäuser II [Andreas Thiele, Third Edition, R. G. Fischer Verlag, 1997, pp.342-346]. The list for Liechtenstein comes from Tompsett and Bruce R. Gordon's Regnal Chronologies. The genealogy has now been updated simply with information from Wikipedia. I had originally missed the descent of King William II. Since William himself had no sons, the Throne of Württemberg would have passed to Albrecht, on a collaterial line. However, by then the Kingdom no longer existed. The reversed crown for \"pretenders\" simply indicates the descent of the Head of the House of Württemberg. Since we tend to find disposessed royality often still marrying each other, we have the striking case here of the intermarriage of Württemberg with the family of the Orléanist Pretenders to the Thone of France.\n\nGerman Confederation Index\n\nStem Duchies Index\n\nFrancia Index\n\nLords, Counts, & Princes of Lippe Herman of Lipped.1096 Bernard ILord, 1123-1158 Herman I1124-1160 Bernard II1160-1224 Herman II1196-1229 Simon1229-1277 Bernard III1229-1265 Herman III1265-1274 Bernard IV1265-1275 Simon I1275-1344 Simon IId.1334 Otto1344-1360 Bernard V1344-1365 Simon III1360-1410 Bernard VI1410-1415 Simon IV1415-1429/30 Bernard VII the Warlike1430-1511 Simon V1511-1528 Count, 1528-1536 Bernard VIII1536-1563 Simon VI1563-1613 Simon VIIDetmold,\n\n1613-1627Philip ISchaumburg,\n\n1647-1681 Simon Louis1627-1636 Simon Philip1636-1650 John Bernard1650-1652 Herman Adolph1652-1666 Simon Henry1666-1697Frederick\n\nChristian1681-1728 Frederick\n\nAdolph1697-1718 Simon Henry\n\nAdolph1718-1720 Prince,\n\n1720-1734Albert\n\nWolfgang1728-1748 Simon Augustus1734-1782William\n\nFrederick,\n\nDon Quixote1748-1777 Leopold I1782-1802Philip II1777-1787 George I1787-1807 Leopold II1802-1851Prince,\n\n1807-1860 Leopold III1851-1875Adolph I1860-1893 Woldemar1875-1895 Alexander1895-1905George II1893-1911 Leopold IV of\n\nLippe-Biesterfeld1905-1918,\n\nd.1949Adolph II1911-1918,\n\nd.1936\n\nIn 1815 Lippe consisted of at least three discontinuous pieces in between Hanover, Brunswick, and Westphalian Prussia.

Various brances of the family arose. Some died out. Another assumed the important Electoral office of Brandenburg. Other another continued in small Counties, later Principalities, in southern Germany, to be reunited in the service, at least, of the Northern family, and to contribute Royalty to Romania.\n\nWith, probably, little enough to do in their small Counties, many of the Counts occupied themselves in military service to the Emperors; and in one generation, no less than three brothers were killed in the struggle that the Emperor Maximilian waged against France to secure the Burgundian Succession.\n\nAfter Count Charles I's death in 1576, the Southern succession simplified to two lines, as given below.\n\nThis genealogy is taken entirely out of the Erzählende genealogische Stammtafeln zur europäischen Geschichte, Volume I, Part 1, Deutsche Kaiser-, Königs-, Herzogs- und Grafenhäuser I [Andreas Thiele, Third Edition, R.

At the end, the line was divided between Hechingen and Sigmaringen -- the latter is actually on the Danube, north of Lake Constance. Hechingen and Sigmaringen separated in 1575. The division between this line of southern Princes and the northern Hohenzollerns of Brandenburg was with two sons of Frederick I, Burggraf of Nuremberg, who died around 1200. One son, Conrad I (d.1260/61), led to the northern Hohenzollerns, the other, Frederick II (d.1251/55), led to the southern Hohenzollerns. The ten generations that separate Frederick II from Charles I in the genealogy at left are given in the table at The Descent of the Hohenzollern above.\n\nIn 1849 both Princes abdicated and ceded the whole Principality to their distance cousin, the King of Prussia. They were rewarded in 1850 with royal status and important commissions under the Kingdom. Charles Anthony, the last sovereign prince of Sigmaringen, was even the Prime Minister of Prussia from 1858 to 1862, not long (6 months) before Otto von Bismarck. The heirs of Sigmaringen, however, found sovereinty elsewhere, as Kings of Romania. All the Kings of Romania and the surviving heirs are Hohenzollerns.\n\nThis genealogy is taken out of the Erzählende genealogische Stammtafeln zur europäischen Geschichte, Volume I, Part 1, Deutsche Kaiser-, Königs-, Herzogs- und Grafenhäuser I [Andreas Thiele, Third Edition, R.

By founding the city of Bern in 1191, Duke Berthold V of Zähringen indicates to us one of the centers of Zähringen power. Burgundy east of the Jura and west of the Reuss River was known as the \"Lesser Duchy\" of Burgundy (Burgundia Minor, klein Burgund), while around Bern itself was the Landgravate (Landgrafschaft) of Burgundy. However, Berthold died without heirs. Bern itself was made a Imperial City by the Emperor Frederick II in 1218.

Fischer Verlag, 1997, p.352], \"his death without heirs meant the complete disintegration of the German Southwest.\" This disintegration allowed for the development of Switzerland, in whose shadow Burgundy is forgotten. Bern joined the Swiss Confederation in 1353.\n\nMeanwhile, however, a collateral line of the family had become the Margraves of Baden. They continued there until the 20th century.\n\nMargraves & Grand\n\nDukes of Baden;\n\nZähringens Herman I1064-1073,\n\nd. 1074 Herman II1073-1130 Margrave\n\nof Baden,\n\n1112 Herman III1130-1160 Herman IV1160-1190 Herman V1190-1243 Herman VI1243-1250 Frederick I1250-1268 Rudolf I1243-1288 Rudolf II1288-1295 Hesso1288-1297 Rudolf Hesso1297-1335 Rudolf III1288-1332 Herman VII1288-1291 Frederick II1291-1333 Herman VIII1333-1353 Rudolf IV1291-1348 Rudolf V1348-1361 Frederick III1348-1353 Rudolf VI1353-1372 Rudolf VII1372-1391 Bernard I1372-1431 James I1431-1453 George1453-1454,\n\nd. 1484 Bernard II1453-1458 Charles I1453-1475 Christopher I1475-1515,\n\nd.1527 Philip I1515-1533 Ernest1515-1552,\n\nd.1553 Baden-Durlach,\n\n1535 Bernard IV1552-1553 Charles II1552-1577 Ernest Frederick1577-1590 James III1577-1590 Ernest James1590-1591 George Frederick1577-1622,\n\nd.1638 Frederick V1622-1659 Frederick VI1659-1677 Frederick VII1677-1709 Charles III William1709-1738 founds Karlsruhe Karl Friedrich1738-1811 inherits\n\nBaden-Baden,\n\n1771 Elector,\n\n1803;\n\nGrand Duke,\n\n1806 Karl1811-1819 Ludwig I1818-1830 Leopold1830-1852 Ludwig II1852-1856,\n\nd.1858 Friedrich I1856-1907 German Empire, 1871 Friedrich II1907-1918,\n\nd.1928\n\nBaden was a relatively large state along the east bank of the Rhine, running north deep into Germany, and in the south along the Swiss border all the way to Lake Constance. Two branches of the Margravate divided in 1535, but the Baden-Baden line ended in 1771.\n\nBernard III1515-1536 Baden-Baden,\n\n1535 Christopher II1536-1556,\n\nd.1575 Edward\n\nFortunatus1588-1594,\n\nd.1600 Philibert1536-1569 Philip II1569-1588 William1622-1677 Hermann (d.1691), son of William, commanded 2nd Imperial & Saxon infantry, Center of Christian Relief Army at Siege of Vienna, 1683 Louis William1677-1707 Defeats Turks with Imperial Army in Hungary, 1686; Blenheim campaign with Eugene of Savoy & Duke of Marlborough, 1704; dies of wound Louis George1707-1761 Augustus George1761-1771\n\nThe most outstanding figure of either line may have been Louis William of Baden-Baden, who as an Imperial General defeated the Turks in 1686 and then campaigned in the War of the Spanish Succession with Eugène of Savoy (whose aunt Louise was his mother) and John Churchill, the Duke of Marlborough, who had marched into Bavaria from Flanders.\n\nUnfortunately, Louis William was of the old school of commanders who liked sieges and disliked pitched battles. Since both Marlborough and Eugène intended to fight battles, this was not a good match; yet the Margrave, who was also pretty self-important, was the one nominallly in command.\n\nHaving sent Eugène off, the Duke persuaded Louis William that they needed to take the crossing of the Danube at Donauworth, which was defended by the fortress of Schellenberg, which had only ever fallen to one enemy, Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden. With great personal bravery the Margrave may have actually carried the day and won the battle, but he was wounded in the process. His horse fell on him and crushed his foot. This wound was to cost him his life, but at first its severity was not apparent.\n\nThis action was preliminary to the Battle of Blenheim. Marlborough and Eugène knew that a battle against what were actually superior French forces would not be agreeable to the Margrave. Since they knew he liked sieges, they urged him to attack the city of Ingolstadt; and he took the bait. When Marlborough and Eugène then combined to defeat the French, Louis William perceived their trick, was furious, and never forgave them -- despite the certainty that he would not have agreed to their action in the first place -- as he in fact obstructed their efforts to follow up on the victory. Indeed, he went on to besiege Landau, which ate up the rest of the compaigning season, rather proving the point for Marlborough and Eugène.\n\nIn subsequent operations, as Louis William seemed to hesitate and prevaricate, Eugene and Churchill began to suspect him of disaffection or even dealing with the French. This was probably a combination of his continuing resentment and trouble from his unhealed foot. Only his death revealed the sad truth, that he had been laboring with a mortal wound.\n\nLouis William's uncle, Hermann, had distinguished himself before Vienna in 1683. Commanding troups intended as a reserve, Hermann nevertheless attacked the Turks, with great success.\n\nNapoleon bestowed the office of Elector of the Holy Roman Empire on Baden in 1803; but this didn't last long, since Napoleon then abolished the Empire in 1806. In compensation, Karl Friedrich was made a Grand Duke. Subsequent Dukes were wise enough not to oppose Prussia; Baden joined the German Empire in 1871; and Zähringen rule lasted until the German princely states were all abolished in 1918.\n\nThis list and genealogy was originally taken entirely from Brian Tompsett's Royal and Noble genealogy.

Twelve generations elapse from Sizzo to Henry XXXI, as shown at left.\n\nVarious branch lines, Leutenberg, Käfernburg, Wachsenburg, and Blankenburg, had reduced to two by 1815, Sonderhausen and Rudolstadt, both of which derived from Günther XL of Blankenburg. At left only the direct line of Blankerburg is shown. Below, the full lines of Sonderhausen and Rudolstadt are given.\n\nConveniently, the Rival Emperor, Günther of Schwarzburg, is in the Blankenburg line, the brother of Henry X. He was killed in battle against the Emperor Charles IV.\n\nThis genealogy is taken entirely out of the Erzählende genealogische Stammtafeln zur europäischen Geschichte, Volume I, Part 2, Deutsche Kaiser-, Königs-, Herzogs- und Grafenhäuser II [Andreas Thiele, Third Edition, R. G. Fischer Verlag, 1997].\n\nBoth Sonderhausen and Rudolstadt lines became Principalities in 1697.\n\nThe last Sonderhausen Prince died in 1909 and the whole of Schwarzburg was reunified, but this was just in time for the princely states to end in 1918.\n\nGerman Confederation Index\n\nStem Duchies Index\n\nFrancia Index\n\nPrinces & Dukes of Anhalt\n\nThe genealogy of Anhalt here begins with Joachim Ernest in 1551 mainly because he ended up inheriting all of the fragments of Anhalt that had become distributed in earlier lines. He himself then has no less than five sons among whom the Principality becomes fragmented all over again. The first Prince of Anhalt was Henry I in 1212. From Henry to Joachim Ernest was nine generations.\n\nFar and away the most noteworthy connection of the House of Anhalt is the marriage of Sophia Augusta, daughter of Christian Augustus of Anhalt- Zerbst, to the Russian Tsar Peter III (d.1762). Sophia Augusta quickly becomes the Sovereign in her own right, as the Empress Catharine II the Great of Russia. The subsequent Romanov family is all descended from her.\n\nIn 1806 and 1807 Napoleon made the three remaining Princes of Anhalt into Dukes. The male line of Anhalt-Köthen then died out in 1847, and the line of Anhalt-Bernburg in 1863. Anhalt-Dessau thus gathers in all of Anhalt, though of course the Duke then joined the German Empire in 1871, and all power was lost in 1918.\n\nThis genealogy is taken entirely out of the Erzählende genealogische Stammtafeln zur europäischen Geschichte, Volume I, Part 2, Deutsche Kaiser-, Königs-, Herzogs- und Grafenhäuser II [Andreas Thiele, Third Edition, R.

The first Count of Schwalenberg was Widekind I (1127-1137). Adolf I comes five generations later. The heir of the line is now Wittekind, grandson of Frederick II, born in 1936. Wittekind did not marry until 1988 and does not have any children, but his two uncles have many descendants.\n\nThis list is taken entirely out of the Erzählende genealogische Stammtafeln zur europäischen Geschichte, Volume I, Part 2, Deutsche Kaiser-, Königs-, Herzogs- und Grafenhäuser II [Andreas Thiele, Third Edition, R.

There were other lines besides the ones shown here, and these themselves follow succession to different sub-domains, but this diagram traces the descend of the two final Princes, beginning with Henry XIII when the lines separate. The bewildering thing about Reuß is that every single heir is named \"Henry\" (Heinrich). The numbering doubtless follows some logic for the sub-domains, but this is very difficult to reconstruct systematically. As it is, the straight succession gives numbers that look completely scrambled and bizarre.\n\nThis genealogy is taken entirely out of the Erzählende genealogische Stammtafeln zur europäischen Geschichte, Volume I, Part 2, Deutsche Kaiser-, Königs-, Herzogs- und Grafenhäuser II [Andreas Thiele, Third Edition, R.

Passant's A Short History of Germany, 1815-1945 [Cambridge University Press, 1962] lists a \"Principality of Layen\" as one of the members of the German Confederation in 1815. However, Layen is not then shown on the attendant map. His source, which he says is a map, The German Confederated States [London, 1839], must have contained this anomaly. A correspondent then called to my attention the entry for \"Leyen\" in Bruce R. Gordon's Regnal Chronologies. Gordon explained that Leyen was a Principality by dispensation of Napoleon from 1806 to 1814. If Leyen is then Passant's \"Layen,\" in 1815 it had already been annexed to Baden. Gordon says that Leyen was \"a small territory in the Rhineland, between Speyer and Worms\" and that it was ruled by the \"Lords of Adendorf\" who \"became Barons of the Empire in 1653, and Counts of the Empire in 1711.\"\n\nLords, Counts, &\n\nPrince of Layen/Leyen Hugo Ernest1653-1665 Charles\n\nCaspar1665-1711 Count,\n\n1711-1739 Frederick\n\nFerdinand\n\nFrancis\n\nAnthony1739-1760 Francis\n\nCharles1760-1775 Philip Francis1775-1814 Prince of\n\nLeyen,\n\n1806-1814,\n\nd.1829 to Baden, 1814\n\nI then was able to find Leyen in the Erzählende genealogische Stammtafeln zur europäischen Geschichte, Volume III, Ergänzungsband [Andreas Thiele, Second Edition, R. G. Fischer Verlag, 2001, p.68]. Thiele lists Hugo Ernest, whom he says became a Reichs-Freiherr of Leyen in 1663, which must be Gordon's \"Baron of the Empire\" (though off by ten years), but then has him dying in 1665, not Gordon's 1670. Unfortunately, Thiele does not list the descendants of Hugo Ernest, but he does say that they became Counts in 1711 (agreeing with Gordon) and Princes in 1806. We do get mention of a subsequent Count, Francis Charles, who is cited, as \"Karl,\" as the husband of Maria Anna Helene of Dalberg (d.1804, p.10). It is certainly Francis Charles since he is listed as a Count of Leyen who died in 1775. There is another connecton between Leyen and Dahlberg, since earlier a niece of Hugo Ernest, Anna Catharine, married Philip Francis Eberhard, Treasurer of Worms and great-grandfather of Maria Anna Helene. Also Hugo Ernest was a brother of Karl Kaspar, Archbishop Elector of Trier (not the Charles Caspar who succeeds Hugo Ernest).\n\nFurther information has now come from a correspondent in the Netherlands, who has provided the entire genealogy of Gondorf-Adendorf-Leyen from Detlev Schwennicke's Europäische Stammtafeln, Standesherrliche Häuser I, Neue Folge, Volume IV (Verlag J.A. Stargardt, Marburg, 1981, tables 39-42). I have reproduced this above at right, beginning with Werner. The ancestor of the line is said to have been Engelbertus of Guntreve (Gondorf), who was living around 1158-1160. Schwenniche also has Hugo Ernest dying in 1665, but then has him becoming the Reichs-Freiherr in 1653, not 1663 like Thiele.\n\nGerman Confederation Index\n\nStem Duchies Index\n\nFrancia Index\n\nPhilosophy of History\n\nHome Page"
