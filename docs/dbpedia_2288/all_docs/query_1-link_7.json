        "text": "Liechtenstein Princely Family History\n\nPrince Josef Wenzel I (1696-1772), Prince of Liechtenstein\n\nPrince Josef Wenzel I was the eldest son of Prince Philip Erasmus and Princess Christina Theresa, née Countess von Löwenstein-Wertheim-Rochefort.\n\nHe mainly devoted his life to a successful military career, reaching the high ranks of field marshal and generalissimo in Italy in 1745 and of General Chief Commander in Hungary eight years later; he also served as ambassador of the Holy Roman Emperor to the Kingdom of France and as Imperial envoy in Berlin.\n\nAccording to his biographies, he reigned the principality three times: the first time between 1712 and 1718, as heir to Prince Johann Adam I, being succeeded by his uncle Anton Florian; the second time between 1732 and 1745, as regent for the minor Prince Johann Nepomuk Karl (grandson of Prince Anton Florian); and the third time from 1748 to 1772, as successor to Prince Johann Nepomuk Karl.\n\nDoes anyone know why he reigned the first time, and therefore how did his succession to Prince Johann Adam I happen?\n\nI wonder that, because his uncle Prince Anton Florian was the older brother of his father, and therefore he should have succeded to Prince Johann Adam I in 1712, as his nearest male relative (as shown in this genealogical table, from the website of the Princely Family). Why was Prince Anton Florian skipped in 1712?\n\nPrince Johann I Joseph (1760-1836)\n\nFrom 1806 to 1813, during the reign of Prince Johann I Joseph, Liechtenstein was a member of the Confederation of the Rhine set up by Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\nJohann I Joseph's full name was Johann Baptist Josef Adam Johann Nepomuk Aloys Franz de Paula.\n\n​\n\nJohann I Joseph was Prince of Liechtenstein between 1805 and 1806 and from 1814 to 1836.\n\n​\n\nPrince Josef Wenzel inherited 632 paintings from Hans Adam I.\n\n​\n\nSomeone can tell me more about the prince Josef-emanuel of liechtenstein, please?\n\nPrince Josef-Emanuel Leopold Marie is the son of Prince Nikolaus and Princess Margaretha.\n\nJosef-Emanuel was born in Brussels-Uccle, Belgium on May 7, 1989.\n\nHe attended the Royal Military Academy in Sandhurst, England.\n\n​\n\nDo all Royals with the title of Prince or Princess of Liechtenstein also bear the title of Count or Countess of Rietberg?\n\n​\n\nYes they do. According to the House Laws of the Princely House, all the members of the Princely House bear the titles Prince(ss) of Liechtenstein and Count(ess) Rietberg, with the style of Serene Highness.\n\nThe only exceptions are the Reigning Prince (Fürst), whose full title is Reigning Prince of Liechtenstein, Duke of Troppau and Jägerndorf, Count Rietberg, Sovereign of the House of Liechtenstein, and the eldest son of the Reigning Prince, whose title is Hereditary Prince of Liechtenstein, Count Rietberg.\n\nMAfan, Thank you for the explanation of the title of Count or Countess of Rietberg.\n\n​\n\nList of monarchs of Liechtenstein\n\nKarl I 20 December 1608 - 12 February 1627(18 years, 54 days)\n\nKarl Eusebius 12 February 1627 - 5 April 1684(57 years, 53 days) Son of Karl I\n\nHans-Adam I 5 April 1684 - 16 June 1712(28 years, 72 days) Son of Karl Eusebius\n\nJosef Wenzel I 16 June 1712 - 12 March 1718(5 years, 269 days) Great-grandnephew of Karl I\n\nAnton Florian 12 March 1718 - 11 October 1721(3 years, 213 days) Uncle of Josef Wenzel I\n\nJosef Johann Adam 11 October 1721 - 17 December 1732(11 years, 67 days) Son of Anton Florian\n\nJohann Nepomuk Karl 17 December 1732 - 22 December 1748(16 years, 5 days) Son of Josef Johann Adam\n\nJosef Wenzel I 22 December 1748 - 10 February 1772(23 years, 50 days) Great-grandnephew of Karl I\n\nFranz Josef I 10 February 1772 - 18 August 1781(9 years, 189 days) Nephew of Josef Wenzel I\n\nAloys I 18 August 1781 - 24 March 1805(23 years, 218 days) Son of Franz Joseph I Liechtenstein\n\nJohann I Josef 24 March 1805 - 20 April 1836(31 years, 27 days) Son of Franz Joseph I Liechtenstein\n\nAloys II 20 April 1836 - 12 November 1858(22 years, 206 days) Son of Johann I Josef Liechtenstein\n\nJohann II 12 November 1858 - 11 February 1929(70 years, 91 days) Son of Aloys II Liechtenstein\n\nFranz I 11 February 1929 - 25 July 1938(9 years, 164 days) Son of Aloys II\n\nFranz Josef II 25 July 1938 - 13 November 1989(51 years, 111 days) Great-great-grandson of Johann I Josef\n\nHans-Adam II 13 November 1989 - current\n\nThe House of Liechtenstein: An Overview\n\nThe House of Liechtenstein, from which the principality takes its name, is the family which reigns by constitutional, hereditary right over the nation of Liechtenstein. Only dynastic members of the family are eligible to inherit the throne. The dynasty's membership, rights and responsibilities are defined by a law of the family, which is enforced by the reigning prince and may be altered by vote among the family's dynasts, but which may not be altered by the Government or Parliament of Liechtenstein.\n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Liechtenstein\n\nNext we present the family tree of the Princely Family of Liechtenstein.\n\nKarl I (30 July 1569 – 12 February 1627)\n\nIn 1600, Karl married Anna Maria Šemberová, Baroness of Boskovice and Černá Hora and Lady of Aussee (1575–1625).
