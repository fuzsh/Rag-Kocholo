        "text": "The winery is located in the municipality of Wilfersdorf in the north of the Lower Austrian wine-growing region of Weinviertel. The noble family of Liechtenstein was founded as early as the 13th century by Heinrich I. His sons entered the service of Rudolf of Habsburg (1218-1299). His sons entered the service of Rudolf of Habsburg (1218-1291). The family subsequently acquired large areas of vineyards. One of the descendants was Gundaker, who received die Güter Wilfersdorf, Mistelbach, Poysdorf and Ringelsdorf. Wilfersdorf Castle has been in uninterrupted family ownership since 1436. Progressive wine-growing methods were already introduced at that time. In 1636, for example, a cellar regulation was issued which, among other things, precisely regulated the \"Zuberaithung von Wein mit Schwebl\". The domain of the Prince of Liechtenstein includes the Hofkellerei Stiftung Fürst Liechtenstein and Wilfersdorf Castle in Wilfersdorf, as well as the Hofkellerei with the Vinothek and the speciality restaurant Torkel in Vaduz. The vineyards of the Vaduz domain are among the best sites in the Rhine Valley. The four-hectare Herawingert has been owned by the princely family since 1712 and is the most important vineyard in the Principality of Liechtenstein."
