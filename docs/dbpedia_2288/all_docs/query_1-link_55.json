        "text": "The depicted CoA of Karel Eusebius z Lichtenštejna (Karl Eusebius, Prince of Liechtenstein), former ruler of Opava Duchy, you can find above the main entrance of the Church of St. Adalbert (Kostel Sv. Vojtecha) in Opava. This CoA (\"Karl\" branch of the family) is different from the standard and well known (\"Gundakker\" branch of family) Liechtenstein' one. In its right upper quarter is CoA of Tas of Boskovice (white comb in the red field) instead CoA of East Frisian family Cirksena (or a maiden eagle displayed sable the human part argent crowned and armed or).\n\nKarl Eusebius, Prince of Liechtenstein (September 12, 1611 – April 5, 1684) was the Prince of Liechtenstein. He inherited this title in 1627 from his father Karl I. He was 16 and thus considered underage and his uncles Prince Gundakar and Maximillian acted as regents until 1632. From 1639 to 1641 Karl was Chief Captain of High and Low Silesia. After the Thirty Years' War Karl did a meritous job of economically restoring his dominions. Karl was also an extensive patron of architecture of the period. [wiki]\n\nMonumental Church of St. Adalbert (Kostel Sv. Vojtecha), core of the former Jesuits residence in Opava, is one of the most distinctive Baroque monuments in former capital of Opava' Duchy."
