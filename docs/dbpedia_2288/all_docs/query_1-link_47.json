        "text": "Countess Georgina von Wilczek was born on 24 October 1921 in Austria as the daughter of Ferdinand Maria, Count von Wilczek, and Countess Norbertine Kinsky von Wchinitz und Tettau. She was known as Gina in the family. Tragically, her mother died in March 1923 after giving birth to a stillborn child.\n\nGeorgina received her formal education in Vienna at a private Catholic school. She studied art history and applied arts and later studied French, Italian and English at the University of Vienna. She earned a diploma to act as an interpreter.\n\nShe probably met her future husband, Franz Joseph II, Prince of Liechtenstein, in early 1942. He was also her third cousin, and he had been the reigning Prince of Liechtenstein since 1938. They had an age difference of 15 years, but it didn’t bother them, and their friendship eventually turned to love. Their engagement was announced on 30 December 1942. They were married on 7 March 1943 at the Cathedral of St. Florin in Vaduz. It was the first time that the wedding of a ruling Prince had taken place in Liechtenstein. During the following weeks, the newlyweds visited all eleven communes of Liechtenstein.\n\nTheir first child, the current Hans-Adam II, Prince of Liechtenstein, was born on 14 February 1945. Four other children followed: Prince Philipp (born 19 August 1946), Prince Nikolaus (born 24 October 1947), Princess Nora (born 31 October 1950) and Prince Franz Josef “Wenzel” (born 19 November 1962 – died 28 February 1991).\n\nAlthough Liechtenstein had remained neutral throughout the Second World War, the country suffered a gasoline shortage, and Georgina took to travelling by bicycle. She also established the Liechtenstein Red Cross when refugees began to arrive. Georgina was its president from until 1985 when she handed the reins to her daughter-in-law, Marie.\n\nHer last public appearance was on 29 July 1989 at the wedding of Prince Gundakar of Liechtenstein to Princess Marie of Orleans. She would die on 18 October 1989, probably of cancer. A communique later said, ″Her family was with her when she passed away peacefully shortly after receiving the last sacraments.” Her husband, who was also in poor health, collapsed at her bed. He would die less than a month later on 13 November. They are now buried together in the Cathedral of St. Florin in Vaduz.\n\nHer memory remains alive in the principality with the Princess Gina Trail."
