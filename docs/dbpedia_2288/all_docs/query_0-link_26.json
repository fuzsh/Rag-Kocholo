        "text": "This article attempts to give new impetus to the research on trading and collecting paintings in Vienna in the second half of the 18 th interpretation of printed sales catalogs from his possession and the analysis of newspaper notices as well as of recently found documents concerning different private collections.\n\nThis is the first book by Julius Schlosser to appear in English. Written in 1907, it offers an excellent translation of a text that is unusually difficult in many ways. It documents the history of collecting in the era before the first art museums, before the definitions of art we are familiar with, and is based on his work as curator of the Ambras collection then in Vienna and now largely reinstalled in the castle near Innsbruck. It gives insight into one aspect of Schlosser’s early work, but not yet into the better known methodological and theoretical issues that occupied him later\n\nAnderson’s retrieval of Nijs is admirable piece of scholarship. As she demonstrates, this great facilitator in the early history of fine art collecting by the English has been treated unfairly by historians in their desire to find a scoundrel. it constitutes an essential supplement and corrective to Luzio’s foundational study, La galleria dei Gonzaga veduta all’Inghilterra nel 1627–28(1913). To provide a fresh analysis of the sale within a reconstruction of the merchant’s career\n\nMillions of paintings were produced in the Dutch Republic. The works that we know and see in museums today constitute only the tip of the iceberg — the top-quality part. But what else was painted? This book explores the low-quality end of the seventeenth-century art market and outlines the significance of that production in the genre of history paintings, which in traditional art historical studies, is usually linked to high prices, famous painters, and elite buyers. Angela Jager analyses the producers, suppliers, and consumers active in this segment to gain insight into this enormous market for cheap history paintings. What did the supply consist of in terms of quantity, quality, price, and subject? Who produced all these works and which production methods did these painters employ? Who distributed these paintings, to whom, and which strategies were used to market them? Who bought these paintings, and why?\n\nThe inventories of three seventeenth-century art dealers in Amsterdam containing hundreds of paintings with an average value of less than 4 guilders show a high concentration of history painting. This essay explores the mass market for history painting in Amsterdam in the Golden Age by analyzing the stocks-in-trade of three art dealers: what did the art dealers sell, and how did they manage to sell history painting at such low prices? As an example, works by Barend Jansz. Slordt, who produced history painting in large numbers for one of the art dealers, will be studied closely to acquire insight into production costs: what materials did Slordt use and what methods did he apply to paint as economically as possible?\n\nDownload the Introduction here!
