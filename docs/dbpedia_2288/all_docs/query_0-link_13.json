        "text": "History of the Grand Priory of Bohemia\n\nThe Johanniter Order was invited to Bohemia by Prince Vladislav II, who had taken part in the Second Crusade with the forces of King Conrad II of Germany, during which he had learned of the Order’s activities. At some time during the years 1156-1159 the Johannites acquired land to the south of the bishop’s court by the Judith Bridge, later destroyed, in Prague."
