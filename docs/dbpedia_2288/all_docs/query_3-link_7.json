        "text": "The Principality of Liechtenstein is a constitutional hereditary monarchy on a democratic and parliamentary basis. The Princely House thus has a significant political role in the reputation and the development of the country for the benefit of its people.\n\nThe Reigning Prince is the Head of State of Liechtenstein. He exercises state power together with the People in accordance with the Liechtenstein Constitution and the laws of the country.\n\nThe Reigning Prince and the People have individual rights and duties independently of each other. These oblige both sides to work together. In the Principality of Liechtenstein, for example, a law can only come into force if it has been approved by the Reigning Prince and the People. The People do this either indirectly through the members of parliament or through the direct democratic path of a referendum.\n\nThe Liechtenstein Constitution dates from 1921 and uniquely combines a parliamentary democracy with a politically active monarch and pronounced direct democratic rights of the people.\n\nLiechtenstein's constitution of 1921 remained largely unchanged despite the political turbulence and upheavals in 20th century Europe. Only in 2003, after a comprehensive debate on the role of the monarchy in Liechtenstein, a major constitutional reform took place. In a referendum, 64.3 percent of the people voted in favour of the reform proposed by the Princely House. The counter-proposal received only 16.6 percent of the votes. The turnout was 87.7 percent.\n\nThe emblems\n\nThe coat of arms of the Princely House has been considered the large national coat of arms of Liechtenstein since 1719. At that time, the County of Vaduz and the Lordship of Schellenberg were elevated to the status of an Imperial Principality.\n\nThe coat of arms consists of six motifs. A heart shield, the golden-red ancestral coat of arms of the Liechtensteins, forms the centre. At the top left is a gold-crowned eagle referring to Silesia; below it is the red and silver coat of arms of the Duchy of Troppau. The diamond wreath at the top right stands for the coat of arms of the Kuenringer family and the black virgin eagle below refers to Prince Gundaker's first wife Agnes of East Frisia. At the lower tip of the coat of arms, a golden hunting horn hanging from a golden cord is visible, referring to the Duchy of Jägerndorf.\n\nThe decorations\n\nThe recognition of outstanding achievements through titles, orders and decorations has a long tradition in the Princely House of Liechtenstein. The Princes of Liechtenstein themselves have been honoured for their services time and again over the centuries.\n\nAs Head of State, the Prince may confer titles. Common titles are: Princely Councillor, Princely Court Councillor, Princely Judicial Councillor, Princely Commercial Councillor, Princely Study Councillor, Clerical Councillor. Noble titles with the predicate \"von\" as well as the titles \"Baron\" and \"Count\" are very rarely awarded."
