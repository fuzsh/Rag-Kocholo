Surgery-addicted social media star Mary Magdalene has revealed what she looked like before she began getting work done.

In a post shared to Instagram on Friday, the 30-year-old showed her fans photos from her childhood.

In the images, Mary is a fresh-faced pre-teen as she poses for photos taken on the seaside.

She looks quite different to her appearance these days, which includes augmented lips and 10kg breast implants.

The heavily tattooed model had her first procedure done at the age of 21, when she was working as a stripper and escort.

Over the years, her surgeries have included a brow lift, fat transfers, multiple nose and boob jobs, veneers, liposuction, butt implants, porcelain veneers and more.

Earlier this year, she had a fourth nose job to create a 'Barbie nose', along with cat-eye surgery and eyebrow implants.

Mary became a social media sensation in 2018 after she almost died during an operation in Colombia to enlarge her vagina.

'I had to get two blood transfusions. The doctor said I was losing so much blood, and turning very pale. He thought I was going to die,' she previously told The Sun.

Explaining the bizarre procedure on the No Jumper podcast, Mary said she wanted her nether regions to look 'inflated' so she could have 'the world's fattest vagina'.

She also has butt implants, and has had three separate Brazilian butt lifts on top of that, along with illegal 'under the table' silicone injections.

Mary has additionally had 5000cc breast implants, and over the years her breast augmentations have left her with a 10kg chest.
