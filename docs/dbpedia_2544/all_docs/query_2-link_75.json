        "text": "Andrea Mantegna (1430-1506), Entombment of Christ, circa 1470 or 1490, Engraving on greyish-white laid paper, 30,6 cm x 44,9 cm, 1958.21.\n\nAndrea Mantegna was one of the first renowned Italian artists to take an interest in engraving in the mid-fifteenth century through his contacts with the German community living in Italy. In this work, he emphasized the tragic mourning of Jesus’s loved ones at his burial. Mary Magdalene’s face contorts in a paroxysm of pain. She looks at Christ's dead body and surrounds it with her despair, her arms raised in the air, her hair underlining the tumult that inhabits her. Her mouth, opened wide, echoes the darkness of the cave that will receive the corpse.\n\n***\n\nAlbrecht Dürer (1471-1528), Crucifixion (round), 1519, Engraving, Diameter: 6.6 cm, 1975.50.\n\nAlbrecht Dürer's smallest known engraving, this design was probably created for Emperor Maximilian for a now lost gold medal for a hat or the knob of a sword. Dürer would have made several impressions in addition to the one given to the emperor. In the image, Mary Magdalene sits at the foot of the cross, embracing the wood and looking at Christ. Unlike Jesus, John, and the Virgin, she has no halo. We can recognize her by her long hair and her position, which is often represented in the iconographic tradition. Indeed, she lacks the kind of veil worn by the other women in the crowd. Her posture manifests both pain and love—and suggests a carnal embrace. Her strong, central gaze affirms her role as a witness."
