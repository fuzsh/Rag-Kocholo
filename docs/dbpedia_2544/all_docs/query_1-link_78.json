        "text": "Mary Magdalene was a devoted follower of Jesus, who supported him in his ministry and was present at his crucifixion. She is most celebrated for being the first person to witness Jesus' resurrection, according to all four Gospels.\n\nFew women from the Bible receive as much press and intrigue from both Christians and non-Christians alike as Mary Magdalene. From Broadway hits such as Jesus Christ Superstar to Dan Brown’s Da Vinci Code, I have read more about her past than Scripture has indicated.\n\nIn this article, we’ll discuss the true identity of one of the most notorious women who followed Jesus during his ministry, and we’ll expel popular, false ideas that have arisen about her throughout history.\n\nMary Magdalene: Table of Contents\n\nBible Verses\n\nStory\n\nStereotypes\n\nProstitute\n\nSignificance\n\nInteresting Facts\n\nWhat Does the Bible Say About Mary Magdalene?\n\nWe only have one hint at Mary Magdalene’s life before she followed Jesus. When He casts seven (or possibly more) demons out of her, as Luke 8:1-3 says, Mary Magdalene does a complete turnaround and follows Jesus for the rest of His ministry.\n\nHere’s what else we know about her:\n\nMary Magdalene, among a couple of other women, financially supported Jesus and the disciples (Luke 8:1-3).\n\nShe witnessed Jesus’ death and was the first person to see Him resurrected (John 20:11-18).\n\nAnd she likely awaited the descent of the Holy Spirit after Jesus ascended (Acts 1:14).\n\nAside from that, we don’t have many clear details about her from Scripture.\n\nStory of Mary Magdalene\n\nMary Magdalene was a significant follower of Jesus Christ, whose life was dramatically changed after encountering Him. Initially, she was described as being possessed by seven demons, from which Jesus liberated her. This profound experience led her to become one of Jesus's most faithful followers, accompanying Him in His travels and ministering to His needs.\n\nMary Magdalene's loyalty and dedication were most evident during Jesus's crucifixion and burial. When many of Jesus's disciples deserted Him, Mary Magdalene remained steadfast, witnessing His crucifixion. She was also present at His burial and was the first to discover the empty tomb on Easter Sunday. This made her the first person to see the resurrected Christ and thus the first to share the news of His resurrection, earning her the title \"apostle to the apostles\".\n\nFalse Stereotypes about Mary Magdalene\n\nWestern Christianity has assigned roles to Mary Magdalene, which the historical person did not seem to fulfill. Western art and modern media have falsely depicted Mary Magdalene as a prostitute and even as the wife of Jesus. Let’s look deeper into these false stereotypes.\n\n1. Mary Magdalene was Jesus’s wife. (She wasn’t.)\n\nFor instance, some have said Mary and Jesus were either lovers or husband and wife. Some have pointed to a heretical document the size of a business card known as “The Gospel of Jesus’ Wife” as evidence for this.\n\nMary Magdalene did not marry Jesus. Not only would this have been impossible, considering He remained single throughout His public ministry, but He ascended into Heaven after His resurrection.\n\nFurthermore, God would not marry humans. Not to mention, if the Nephilim spoken of back in Genesis 6:1-4 were in fact fallen angels (supernatural beings) who had children with humans, then God saw the wickedness that came about from these unions. One theory of the Nephilim suggests one of the reasons the Great Flood happened was to wipe out the unnatural result of supernatural beings and humans having children.\n\n2. Mary Magdalene was a former prostitute. (She wasn’t.)\n\nMary Magdalene, as it seems according to Scripture, was likely not a prostitute. Some people associate her with the prostitute who washes Jesus’ feet (Luke 7:36-50), but no biblical verse ties the two.\n\nSome have also suggested Mary Magdalene is the woman caught in adultery, but again, Scripture does not give that woman a name (John 8:1-11).\n\nWhy Do So Many Christians Claim She Was a Prostitute?\n\nIf no Scriptural evidence directly ties her to this role, where did the prostitute affiliation come from?\n\nIn the 6th century, Pope Gregory the Great authoritatively pronounced that the sinful woman mentioned in Luke 7:36-50 was the same person as Mary Magdalene. He even asserted that Mary Magdalene and Mary of Bethany were the same person. The Eastern Orthodox Church never linked Mary Magdalene’s identity with the sinful woman in Luke 7.\n\nMary Ann Beavis explained for Baylor University’s Center for Christian Ethics:\n\n“Although Gregory did not actually call her a prostitute, he interpreted the 'seven demons' of which she had been exorcised as the totality of vices, and asserted that the ointment she used to anoint Jesus’ feet had previously been used by her to perfume her body for sensual purposes. Subsequently, the legend of Mary Magdalene, the sister of Martha and Lazarus, as a beautiful, vain, and lustful young woman saved from a life of sin by her devotion to Jesus became dominant in western (Catholic) Christianity, although the eastern (Orthodox) church continued to regard Mary Magdalene and Mary of Bethany as distinct saints, and identified neither with Luke’s sinner.”\n\nAlthough the Western church, since the late 20th century, has attempted to undo the false representations of Mary in the past, some of those misconceptions still linger, especially in popular culture.\n\nThe Significance of Mary Magdalene's Story\n\n1. It matters that we clarify Jesus never had a wife. God would never engage in sexual relations with His creation. He would consider that to be an abomination. We need to eradicate any affiliation of Mary Magdalene as Jesus’ wife.\n\n2. We must ensure we have the historical facts right about anything mentioned in the Bible, even something that seems insignificant. Nonbelievers will nitpick Scriptures to try and find something inaccurate historically so they can try to disprove its credibility. If we have an inaccurate picture of something even small, they will use that as evidence against the infallibility of Scripture.\n\n3. Mary is a radical character in the New Testament—the first to witness the resurrection—and we must make sure to get her story right since Christians and unbelievers alike seem fascinated with her.\n\nAlthough all in all, we can take away from Mary that she lived a life apart from God until she had an encounter with Jesus, which radically changed her life. She went from a life oppressed by seven or more demons to participating in Jesus’ ministry and witnessing the greatest miracle of all time.\n\n7 Things You Didn't Know About Mary Magdalene\n\nThis video touches on things most Christians often don't know about Mary Magdalene. Although I can't cover everything below, I would like to highlight some of them that do appear in the video.\n\nAs mentioned in the video, Jesus set Mary Magdalene free from the grip of seven demons. Seven usually have a completeness factor to it in Scripture. Perhaps more dwelled inside of her than a mere seven. But this goes to show the power Jesus exemplified. To not only cast out one demon out of a person but at least seven.\n\nAlso, I appreciate how this video mentions how Mary (as well as many other women) supported the ministry of Jesus financially. When we give with loving hearts in church, we don't often understand how much our gift can help build the kingdom. Scripture calls us to give of our time and effort, but also, it does require of us to give in a financial sense. After all, the money does come from God. We render to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is God's. And we give with joyful hearts, just as Mary Magdalene did when Jesus preached and traveled.\n\nHope Bolinger is a literary agent at C.Y.L.E. and a graduate of Taylor University's professional writing program.
