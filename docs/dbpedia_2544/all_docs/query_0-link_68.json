However I had to have at least one shot of the Basilica at Vezelay on my stream. This is  the most beautiful church I have ever visited and I have been there often. It has a purity that is almost unique, no colour, no stained glass just a triumph of stone and light, it has a strange quality of stillness. As a committed humanist I have always felt that if I were ever going to have a religious experience then Vezelay would be the place it would happen. I have sat for hours in this abbey I have seen the sun rise  and set through its windows I have listened to Bach and to plainchant  so many, many memories. So once again apologies for the image, hopefully when I visit it again I will finally manage to create a shot worthy of this church\n\t\n\tA little bit about the church\n\tVézelay Abbey (now known as Basilique Sainte-Marie-Madeleine) was a Benedictine and Cluniac monastery in Vézelay in the Yonne département in Burgundy, France. The Benedictine abbey church of Ste-Marie-Madeleine (or Basilica of St. Mary Magdalene), with its complicated program of imagery in sculpted capitals and portals, is one of the outstanding masterpieces of Burgundian Romanesque art and architecture. The church and hill at Vézelay were added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites in 1979. In 1976, after more than eight centuries, Hugues Delautre, one of the Franciscan fathers in charge of servicing the Vézelay sanctuary since 1966, discovers that not only the orientation axis of La Madeleine, but also its internal structure, have been determined taking into account the position of the earth relatively to the sun. Every year, the John the Baptist's feast day reveals the cosmic dimensions of this church: at the full midday of the summer solstice, when the sun is at its upper culmination over the earth, the light coming through the southern clerestorey windows create luminous spots that exactly locate in the full midst of the nave with a rigorous precision. \n\t\n\tTHANKS FOR YOUR VISIT HAVE A GREAT DAY\n\tTo see   <a href=\"http://www.flickriver.com/photos/21506908@N07/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">keithhull's photos on Flickriver</a>",
