        "text": "â€” Pity poor Mary Magdalene.\n\nLong a favorite of religious artists, she has played a leading role in works ranging from Renaissance paintings to just about every movie made about Jesus' life. But that stardom has come with a price.\n\nFew of Jesus' followers have been saddled with a more notorious reputation over the centuries. She's viewed as the bad girl of the Gospels - the reformed harlot who's the polar opposite of the Virgin Mary. Or, thanks to the best-selling thriller The Da Vinci Code, she's seen as Jesus' secret love interest. But the New Testament never identifies her as either.\n\n\"She has been so under-rated,\" said Joan Baldridge, an art historian and member of Trinity Episcopal Cathedral in Little Rock.\n\n\"Yes, she's very popular. Yes, there's lots of art about her. But it's all sexual stuff. She was either a prostitute or the current fad is that she was Jesus' wife. None of that, to me, is accurate. The accurate portrayal of her is so much more important.\"\n\nBaldridge is following a new wave of scholarship that seeks to return Mary Magdalene to her place as an important disciple of Jesus - the one witness to the Crucifixion and Resurrection named in all four Gospels.\n\nBaldridge did her master's thesis at New York University on Mary Magdalene and the depictions of her in art. For the last five years, she has given lectures on Magdalene to churches and secular groups in New York, Chicago and across the state, from Fayetteville to Texarkana. On Palm Sunday, she concluded a three-week lecture series at St. Mark's Episcopal Church in Little Rock.\n\nThe New Testament offers few clues as to Mary Magdalene's background before she joined Jesus. Many scholars speculate that her last name refers to Magdala, a fishing village in Galilee where she might have grown up.\n\nThe Gospels of Mark and\n\nLuke identify her as a womanJesus healed of seven demons. Luke, in its eighth chapter, lists Mary Magdalene with a group of women who support Jesus' ministry \"out of their means.\" But in the previous chapter, Luke tells the story of an unnamed penitent woman who anoints Christ's feet with oil and wets them with her tears.\n\nPope Gregory the Great deserves credit or blame for fusing the two women in the popular imagination during a sermon in the late sixth century.\n\nConfusing matters still further, the pope merged Mary Magdalene with Mary of Bethany, the sister of Martha and Lazarus. John's Gospel says Mary of Bethany anointed Christ's feet before the Last Supper.\n\nGregory the Great's interpretation prevailed for nearly 1,400 years. Throughout the Middle Ages, miracle plays and pictures frequently showed Magdalene as weeping for her sins. Because of these tearful depictions, the English contraction of Magdalene's name - \"maudlin\" - soon took on the connotation of effusive sentimentality.\n\nMeanwhile, other legends developed about Mary Magdalene's life after Jesus' Ascension. One common story in Western Christianity is that she sailed away with Martha and Lazarus and spent the rest of her life in a cave repenting of her sins. As the years passed, her clothes dwindled into rags and she had nothing to cover her but her long, curly hair.\n\nThis image of the later penitent Magdalene proved a popular one with artists such as Renaissance painter Titian. Baldridge said the story (which Magdalene shared with another penitent fallen woman named Mary of Egypt) gave Renaissance artists an excuse to depict the naked human form.\n\n\"It gave the men an excuse to have pinups in their apartments,\" Baldridge said. \"They could say 'Oh, but this is holy.'\"\n\nIn 1969, the Catholic Church officially separated Luke's sinful woman, Mary of Bethany, and Mary Magdalene during a revision of its missal - the book containing the services of Mass throughout the year.\n\nThe change has been slow filtering out into the pews. As recently as Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ in 2004, Magdalene was still shown as an ex-prostitute. That remains a popular interpretation with many Protestants.\n\n\"When we deal with Mary Magdalene we deal with her as a person who is redeemed,\" said the Rev. Bill Bowen, pastor of Village Baptist Church in Bella Vista.\n\n\"You can only speak authoritatively about what Scripture plainly says. ... But I would say - and I can only speak for me - that her background was as a prostitute because you can make inferences from other verses.\"\n\nBut Baldridge is not alone in trying to rehabilitate Mary Magdalene's image. The evangelical group Campus Crusade for Christ is now distributing in North America a direct-to-DVD film called Magdalena: Released From Shame, which depicts Jesus' interactions with variouswomen in the Gospels.\n\nThe movie shows footage from the Jesus film based on the Gospel of Luke that the group has already distributed around the world. After a short run in movie theaters in 1979, Jesus was translated into 1,000 languages and has become standard viewing for church groups.\n\nThe film shows Mary Magdalene narrating Jesus' life. It also shows her before she met Christ as a woman whose demon possession takes the form of insanity, not lust.\n\nJill Schrag, one of three producers of the film, said she sees the prostitution story as a smear on Magdalene's reputation. Her story is dramatic enough without an illicit early career, Schrag says.\n\n\"She went from a demoniac to a follower of Jesus to a witness of the Resurrection to becoming basically the first person to proclaim the resurrection of Christ,\" Schrag said. \"That really made the perfect climax to the film.\"\n\nIn choosing which scenes from the Gospels to show, the filmmakers conducted surveys with women around the world to discover which of Jesus' interactions with women touched them the most.\n\nThe film shows Jesus' conversation with a Samaritan woman at the well, his healing a woman who struggled through a crowd to touch his garment, and his forgiveness of a woman caught in adultery and threatened with stoning. The story of the sinful woman anointing Christ's feet did not make the cut.\n\n\"[The incident] just didn't come to the fore when we interviewed women around the world,\" Schrag said.\n\nPlaywright and actress Allison Allen took a far different view in creating the musical Magdalene, which recently had run at a Southern California theater. She said the idea for the musical came to her in college after a friend was raped.\n\nIn Allen's telling, Mary Magdalene is raped at 14, and her resulting emotional turmoil leads her into a life of prostitution before she encounters Jesus.\n\n\"When you see Christ drove seven demons out of her, youhave to wonder what in the world she was into to be in that state,\" she said. \"To me, something had devastated her life even if Scripture doesn't put exact words on what that was. And then meeting Christ gave her an experience like Paul on the road to Damascus.\"\n\nAllen, who will speak at the Women of Faith Conference next month in North Little Rock, said she thinks most women identify with Magdalene because she's an acknowledged broken person whom Christ saves.\n\nThe Rev. Erik Pohlmeier, pastor of the Catholic Church of St. John the Baptist in Hot Springs, said Christians may never know for sure whether Magdalene had a past life as a woman of ill repute.\n\nHe points out that Pope Gregory the Great was likely a lot closer to the oral tradition than today's biblical scholars.\n\nBut, he said, the most important detail of Mary Magdalene's life was her distinction as an \"Apostle to the Apostles.\"\n\n\"She was the first witness of the Gospel and of course, that was Jesus' choice,\" he said. \"It wasn't just happenstance. It wasn't just because she happened to be there. Jesus was in control of how he revealed himself after the Resurrection. She was the one chosen by God for that purpose.\"\n\nTo learn more about the film Magdalena: Released From Shame, visit www.magdalena today.com."
