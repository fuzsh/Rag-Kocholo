        "text": "Mary Magdalene was not a prostitute.\n\nShe became a prostitute around 500 years after her death. In 591 A.D., Pope Gregory proclaimed her a “sinful woman,” a euphemism for either a sex worker or a promiscuous woman. It was not until 1969 that the Catholic Church corrected its “mistaken” identity: Mary Magdalene was not a prostitute.\n\nBut, as any woman who has ever been slut-shamed knows, the stigma persists.\n\nMary Magdalene reclaimed by the feminine movement\n\nDespite being baptized twice, I was not raised Christian—apart from celebrating Christmas and Easter. I remember being surprised to learn that Jesus was Jewish when I was young. I don’t remember when I first heard that Mary Magdalene wasn’t a prostitute. But I’m sure I found it more reason to find Christianity a hypocritical and oppressive institution.\n\nAlthough I proclaimed myself an atheist in my twenties, I was always a spiritual seeker. In my thirties, my seeking took me to greater depths during a serious illness and my spirituality shifted from an intellectual pursuit to a life-saving one. This is when I came across a growing movement dedicated to “the Feminine.”"
