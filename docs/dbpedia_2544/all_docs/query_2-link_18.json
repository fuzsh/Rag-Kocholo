        "text": "In 2018 Jennifer Ristine, a Consecrated Woman of Regnum Christi, was determined to write a book that addressed three years of fielding questions about Mary Magdalene. Since 2014 she had lived and worked in Magdala, the ancient city believed to be Mary Magdalane’s hometown. Amidst the plethora of debates, diverse theories, and various ideologies that seemed to hijack this saint for their own agendas, she wanted to offer a panoramic view of the possibilities of who this saint is, so as to appreciate the nucleus of the message she may have wished to transmit today, which is nothing less than refocusing on Jesus Christ and his saving grace.\n\nJennifer’s main thesis is that we need to put aside the constant debates about the saint to appreciate the essential elements present in all the traditions that corroborate with the Scriptural Mary Magdalene. Firstly, the evangelist Luke refers to her as Mary called the Magdalene, out of whom came seven demons” (Lk 8:2). Debates aside about what constitutes the demons, this reveals that she was a women in need of healing and liberation. She experienced that through an encounter with the unconditional love of Jesus.\n\nSecond, Mary is documented as one of several women who helped to support Jesus in his ministry. “These women were helping to support them out of their own means” (Luke 8:3). What precisely those means were is not clear. Theories abound from her having inherited wealth from her father or a husband. Few imagine an independent woman with savvy business sense. But here we can imagine a woman who desired to following her Rabonni with whatever time, talent, and treasure that she possessed.\n\nThird, Mary is present in the Paschal Mystery, faithful at the foot of the cross (Jn 19:25), with a longing heart at the empty tomb (Jn 20:1), and the first recorded witness of the resurrected Christ (Jn 20:11-17). The trajectory from the “woman from whom seven demons came out” to her fidelity at the foot of the cross leaves much to speculation. But the end result is obvious. This woman possesses a heart that has left behind “idols” for the sake of her beloved Master. An incredible transformation must have taken place, one which we are also called to, one that inevitably passes through the mystery of the cross.\n\nFourth, she is entrusted with the greatest news in human history, Jesus is alive. She gives witness in word and deed, with joy and enthusiasm to those called to be foundation stones of the nascent Church. “I have seen the Lord!” (Jn 20:18). Is there any greater message? It is the vision for which every human heart longs and which she was honored to receive. Face to face with her beloved, she cannot but help run and cry out with joy to share the Good News of salvation.\n\nLet us learn from her what it means to center our hearts on Jesus Christ, to let him love us as he desires to, and to follow him even to the foot of the Christ. Then from the depth of our convicted faith, we can “run” forth to proclaim, “I too have seen the Lord!”\n\nJennifer Ristine is the author of Mary Magdalene: Insights from Ancient Magdala, a Novena Reflection called Nine Days with Mary Magdalene, and an upcoming work of historical fiction, Becoming Magdalene."
