        "text": "The bauble figurine represents Saint Mary Magdalene and it is a part of a collection of educational baubles called “New Testament”. It is designed to be hung on a Christmas Tree or exposed on a display stand.\n\nSaint Mary Magdalene is presented with a red egg and a container of ointment in her hands, and a skull at her feet.\n\nShe joined Jesus after he healed her: “After this, Jesus travelled about from one town and village to another, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve were with him, and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases: Mary (called Magdalene) from whom seven demons had come out;” [Luke 8, 1-2].\n\nShe accompanied Jesus till the end: “Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.”[John 19, 25]\n\nShe was the one to discover the empty tomb: “Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance.” [J 20, 1]\n\nMary Magdalene was the first one to whom Jesus appeared after His Resurrection: “He asked her, “Woman, why are you crying? Who is it you are looking for?”\n\nThinking he was the gardener, she said, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will get him.”Jesus said to her, “Mary.”She turned toward him and cried out in Aramaic, “Rabboni!” (which means “Teacher”).\n\nJesus said, “Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’ Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news: “I have seen the Lord!” And she told them that he had said these things to her.” [J 20, 15-18]"
