It stars Rooney Mara, Joaquin Phoenix, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Tahar Rahim.\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the National Gallery in London on February 26, 2018. It was released in the United Kingdom on March 16, 2018, by Universal Pictures, in Australia on March 22, 2018, by Transmission Films, and in the United States on April 12, 2019, by IFC Films. It is the last film score completed by composer Jóhann Jóhannsson before his death.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the year AD 30 when Judea was under the control of the Roman Empire, a woman named Mary from the small town of Magdala begins to follow Jesus of Nazareth. Her family and father try to interfere with her departing from her home, but she sends them away. She accepts baptism from Jesus and accepts his charge for her and the other apostles to baptize in the name of the Father. She appears to be fully as one with the other apostles in asserting the authority of the spirit of Jesus working through her on behalf of the followers of Jesus.\n\nThis causes conflict with the other male disciples, including Saint Peter. Mary follows Jesus all the way to the Crucifixion and Resurrection. She tries to tell other disciples but they dismiss her. Peter says she weakened the group and Jesus and they part ways, with Mary vowing to carry on the message with her own voice.\n\nIn the closing captions, Mary is first identified as having been wrongly called a common prostitute by the early church in the first millennium. In the third millennium, she has come to be accepted as one of the followers of Jesus who was among the twelve apostles and together with them.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nRooney Mara as Mary Magdalene\n\nJoaquin Phoenix as Jesus of Nazareth\n\nChiwetel Ejiofor as Peter\n\nTahar Rahim as Judas\n\nSarah-Sofie Boussnina as Martha, Mary's friend\n\nHadas Yaron as Sarah\n\nLubna Azabal as Susannah\n\nLior Raz as Magdala Community Leader\n\nRyan Corr as Joseph\n\nTchéky Karyo as Elisha, Mary's father\n\nJacopo Olmo Antinori as Magdala Man\n\nShira Haas as Leah\n\nUri Gavriel as Philip\n\nDavid Schofield as Thomas\n\nCharles Babalola as Andrew\n\nTawfeek Barhom as James\n\nTzachi Halevy as Ephraim, a potential suitor for Mary\n\nZohar Strauss as John\n\nMichael Moshonov as Matthew\n\nAriane Labed as Rachel\n\nTheo Theodoridis as Lazarus\n\nDenis Ménochet as Daniel, Mary's brother\n\nIrit Sheleg as Mary, Jesus's mother\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nIn February 2016, Rooney Mara joined the cast of the film portraying the titular role of Mary Magdalene, with Garth Davis directing the film, Universal Pictures, Film4 Productions and See-Saw Films co-produced the film, with Iain Canning and Emile Sherman serving as producers.[7] In April 2016, Mara's partner Joaquin Phoenix was in talks to portray the role of Jesus Christ.[8] In July 2016, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Tahar Rahim joined the cast of the film.[9][10] In September 2016, Hadas Yaron joined the cast of the film.[11] Hildur Guðnadóttir and Jóhann Jóhannsson composed the film's score, the latter's final score before his death in February 2018.[12][13]\n\nPrincipal photography began on October 3, 2016[14] and concluded on December 2, 2016.[15] The film was shot in Rome and in multiple locations in Southern Italy including Matera in Basilicata, Gravina in Puglia in Apulia, Trapani in Sicily and Naples[16] in Campania.[17]\n\nRelease\n\n[edit]\n\nIn February 2016, it was reported that The Weinstein Company would distribute the film.[18] It was originally scheduled to be released in the United States and Canada on November 24, 2017.[19] In August 2017, the release was pushed back to March 30, 2018.[20] In January 2018, it was pulled from the schedule.[21] In March 2018, it was announced The Weinstein Company would no longer distribute the film, and the producers were attempting to find another distributor to release the film.[22] IFC Films distributed the film in the United States on April 12, 2019.[23]\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the National Gallery in London on February 26, 2018.[24] It screened at the Audi Dublin International Film Festival on February 28, 2018.[25] It was released in Australia on March 22, 2018.[26]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 44%, based on 114 reviews, with an average rating of 5.6/10.
