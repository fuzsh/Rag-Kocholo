        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe Basilica of Mary Magdalene in St. Maximin-en-Var is a huge edifice that dominates the surrounding village and flat countryside. The structure was begun in the late thirteenth century according to a plan by Pierre d'Angicourt. Construction continued in fits and starts for over 200 years, and the last bays were completed only in 1532. In 1772, when the organ was built, the basilica was part of a Dominican Monastery, which the monks were forced to leave during the revolution a few years later. After the revolution the basilica was restored to religious life as a parish church. The budget allowed the organ to be maintained, but not modernized, which resulted - - happily enough - - in its preservation. In spite of some minor changes (including a modern pedalboard), the organ remains a monument of organ-building in late eighteenth-century France.\n\nThe organ was built by Jean-Esprit Isnard, a builder who was active in southern France from about 1740 until the 1770's. Although he built instruments from Toulouse to Aix-en-Provence, only the St. Maximin organ remains today in an almost unaltered state.\n\nThe case is typical of the French Classical organ in keeping all the pipes of the main case at one level. Its unusual width, comprising five towers separated by flats of pipes, is the result of changes made in the original plan for the instrument, which called for an 8' organ of more modest dimensions. The embracing curve of the main case - - seen more clearly in the second photograph - - gives it a visual interest that prevents it from appearing to be merely a vast wall in the building.\n\nThe stops are unremarkable, and for the most part fit the pattern one would expect in a Classical French organ. The lack of a 4' Flûte is not surprising on an Grand Orgue of only fourteen stops, and at this point in the development of the French organ, the presence of a 5 1/3' in its place is not unheard of. Similarly, the two reeds on the Récit were found on earlier organs, although most imstruments had only one of them.\n\nThere are other real innovations here, however.\n\nThere are two mixtures on the Grand Orgue called \"Fourniture,\" rather than only one. The Grande Fourniture is lower in pitch, and is needed to support the 16' Montre, which was not part of the original specification for the organ.\n\nThe \"Dessus de trompette en chamade\" is an unusual stop for a French Classical organ. It is a \"dessus\" stop in that it plays only from middle c up; its en chamade position gives it a presence in the room that goes far beyond the elegant balance found in earlier French Classical organs.\n\nThe Flûte at 8' pitch on the Positif is uncommon, especially when there is on 4' flute on the division.\n\nThe most notable innovation in this organ, however, is found in the Résonance division. This division is played from manual III, with a permanent coupler allowing its stops to be played from the pedal keyboard. The division, along with the Positif, can also be coupled to the Grand Orgue. The stops of the Résonance are themselves divided, as shown here:"
