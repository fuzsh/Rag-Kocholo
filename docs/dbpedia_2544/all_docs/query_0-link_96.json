        "text": "The highly-anticipated Season 4 finale of The Chosen is airing tonight. As you watch the emotional events unfold, you might be curious about whether there will be a fifth season of The Chosen and when it will be released. Read on to learn everything to know about The Chosen Season 5.\n\nThe Chosen is a faith-based series created, directed, and co-written by Dallas Jenkins. The historical drama is set in Judaea and Galilee in the 1st century and follows the life and ministry of Jesus of Nazareth and the people who met and interacted with him. Jonathan Roumie plays Jesus Christ, while Shahar Isaac, Elizabeth Tabish, Paras Patel, Noah James, George H. Xanthis, and more also star.\n\nThe fourth season premiered in theaters earlier this year. After lengthy streaming delays due to legal issues, viewers were finally able to start watching the new episodes at home starting in early June. Jenkins described Season 4 as the most emotional season \"by far,\" but hinted that Season 5 will be even more emotional because of the events it will cover.\n\n“I mean, we’re covering the most famous and impactful week in the history of the world — Holy Week,” the creator told Deseret News in May. Discover everything to know about The Chosen Season 5, including the confirmed cast, plot, and release date.\n\nWill There Be The Chosen Season 5?\n\nYes, The Chosen has been renewed for a fifth season and is set to have seven seasons in total. Jenkins and a couple of writers have been planning the future of the show, including its ending.\n\n“We went to Sundance, spent a couple of days there and just plotted out the outlines and started to work on some of the scripts for Season 6 and 7 because we really want to make sure that we know where we’re going with everything,” the director told Deseret News.\n\nHas Filming Started For The Chosen Season 5?\n\nYes, filming for The Chosen Season 5 began in April 2024. Production started in Utah before moving to Texas — the show’s home base — for the rest of production this summer.\n\n“The response to Season 4 has been overwhelming so far, which provides a nice lift for us as we head into filming,” Jenkins said to Variety. “Of course, we’re about to try to portray the most famous week in the history of humans, so the euphoria from the previous season never lasts long. The entire Season 6 will cover one day, so covering one week in Season 5 feels luxurious.”\n\nForbes'The Chosen' Season 4 Finally Gets A Streaming Release Date\n\nWhen Is The Chosen Season 5 Coming Out?\n\nIt’s currently unknown when The Chosen Season 5 will be released. However, if production continues as scheduled, Season 5 could premiere sometime in early-to-mid 2025, based on previous release patterns.\n\nFor example, Season 4 of The Chosen resumed filming in July 2023 after receiving a SAG-AFTRA Interim Agreement to continue production during the now-resolved actor’s strike. The series premiered in theaters approximately six to seven months later on February 1, 2024.\n\nThe Chosen has not yet announced whether Season 5 will receive a theatrical release like Season 4. If it does, the series will likely stagger episodes in theaters like it did with Season 4. Eventually, Season 5 will be available on The Chosen TV and certain streaming services a few weeks or months after.\n\nWho Is In The Chosen Season 5 Cast?\n\nThe entire Season 4 cast of The Chosen will come back for the next installment, including Jonathan Roumie as Jesus Christ, according to Variety. Check out some of the returning cast members below.\n\nJonathan Roumie as Jesus Christ\n\nShahar Isaac as Simon Peter\n\nParas Patel as Matthew\n\nElizabeth Tabish as Mary Magdalene\n\nNoah James as Andrew\n\nGeorge H. Xanthis as John\n\nAbe Bueno-Jallad as Big James\n\nJordan Walker Ross as Little James\n\nGiavani Cairo as Thaddeus\n\nJoey Vahedi as Thomas\n\nAlaa Safi as Simon the Zealot\n\nAustin Reed Alleman as Nathanael\n\nReza Diako as Philip\n\nVanessa Benavente as Mother Mary\n\nYasmine Al-Bustami as Ramah\n\nLuke Dimyan as Judas\n\nLara Silva as Eden\n\nand more.\n\nWarning: Spoilers ahead for The Chosen Season 4, Episodes 7-8.\n\nWhat Will The Chosen Season 5 Be About?\n\nSeason 5 of The Chosen will resume where Season 4 left off — during Holy Week before the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. In the finale, Jesus and His apostles go to Bethany to comfort Lazarus’ sisters, Martha and Mary, after Lazarus has been dead for four days. They go to Lazarus’ tomb, where Jesus raises Lazarus from the dead. Upon hearing this, the Sanhedrin, specifically the High Priest, wants Jesus to be handed over to the Romans to be killed.\n\nJenkins told Variety that he’s most excited to work on the set for the Garden of Gethsemane, where Jesus gets betrayed and arrested. “No one’s ever seen what we’ve got planned for that sequence,” he added.\n\nThe Chosen started as a crowd-funded streaming project in 2017. The show found immense success across various streaming platforms, including Prime Video, Peacock, Netflix, and The CW. By the end of 2022, 108 million people worldwide had watched at least part of one episode, according to a study by independent consultant Sandy Padula.\n\nStay tuned to learn more about The Chosen Season 5."
