        "text": "In the heart of the capital, in the elegant neighborhood best known for its two famous landmarks, the Arc de Triomphe and the Avenue des Champs-Elysées, the Church of the Madeleine, recognizable by its grand columns, stands imposingly. This summer, the building where the Mass marking the opening of the Olympic truce was celebrated July 19 finds itself at the center of the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games.\n\nFrom the church's entrance, one can see the dome of the Invalides, where archery events are held, and the Place de la Concorde, the site for BMX and skateboard competitions. This strategic geographical location has made this large Parisian church, with its Greek temple-like appearance, a perfect place to become the spiritual center of Paris during the Olympic Games.\n\nIn late July, the flow of visitors showed no sign of slowing down. Some entered the Madeleine out of curiosity, for heritage interest, to find some cool air, or to shelter from the rain, depending on the whims of Parisian weather. Others lit a candle and prayed for a moment, like Christine and her husband, Joël, in front of the Our Lady of Athletes chapel, which was inaugurated in September 2023 for the Rugby World Cup in France.\n\nThe retired couple, originally from Brest, prayed for their eldest son. “Six years ago, he was seriously injured in a skiing accident and was miraculously healed. He went skiing again for the first time this winter, thanks b to God.”\n\nConcerts and vigils at the Madeleine\n\nTo accommodate visitors — believers and non-believers alike — during this extraordinary period at the Madeleine, the church, known for its acoustics, planned a specific program. Over three weeks, Christian artists will perform in various musical genres, including traditional classical music concerts, Christian praise, reggae, and gospel.\n\n“We want to reach a very broad audience while offering an openness to new forms of Christian music,” explained Isabelle de Chatellus, director of Holy Games, the Catholic Church's mobilization project for the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games.\n\nClarisse, a 28-year-old Parisian nurse, came with friends to the prayer vigil organized by the Emmanuel Community. She was almost disheartened to be in Paris for the Olympics: “But evenings like this allow us to experience this period differently.” Beside her, Henri, who works in a consulting firm and is a Holy Games volunteer during the Games, is happy to “bear witness to his faith” during this global event, especially after the controversies surrounding the opening ceremony.\n\n250 volunteers\n\nLike him, nearly 250 volunteers have come forward to assist the 50 parishes mobilized during the Olympics. Daily masses are celebrated for a different nation each day, led by young people, with evenings of testimonies, prayer vigils, and adoration. “All the major spiritual events take place at the Madeleine, apart from the blessing of athletes held at the Basilica of Saint-Denis,” de Chatellus explained.\n\nSports naturally hold a place of honor as well. Every afternoon, visitors are invited to run 30 meters on a specially painted athletics track alongside the church to create a \"relay of nations for peace,\" de Chatellus said. \"Once they have run, they are invited to enter the church and light a candle for an athlete of their choice.”\n\nFor the director of Holy Games, sport is indeed an opportunity to share faith: \"Mary Magdalene was the first to run to the apostles to announce the resurrection of Jesus. It's up to us to do the same, to run to announce the good news.\"\n\nThis Olympic adventure will undoubtedly leave a lasting impression on the spirit of this church, first imagined by Napoleon as a temple dedicated to the glory of his army and which hosted Johnny Hallyday's funeral ceremony in 2017.\n\n“The Olympic Games will become part of the history of the Madeleine, and the chapel of athletes will likely remain,” said Msgr. Patrick Chauvet, pastor of the church. “This church, where one can come to rest after sports events, can also be a place, after the Olympic experience, where one comes after life's trials, like Mary Magdalene who found rest at the feet of Christ.”\n\n------\n\nInterfaith Meeting in the courtyard of Notre-Dame\n\nFollowing the Mass for the opening of the Olympic truce, the Paris Games will be marked by another significant spiritual moment August 4. An interfaith meeting will be held in the courtyard of Notre Dame, “demonstrating the desire for peace carried by the representatives of religions,” with leaders of the five major religions present at the multifaith center of the Olympic Village. The presence of Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee, was announced for this event, which will reflect on the theme “How do sports connect with the best of our humanity?”"
