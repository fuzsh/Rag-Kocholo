        "text": "The Ointment of the Magdalene (Le parfum de Madeleine)\n\nJames Tissot\n\nEuropean Art\n\nMary Magdalene kneels before Christ and anoints his feet, wiping away the excess oil with her hair, a gesture of deference and devotion. The disciples—especially Judas Iscariot, Tissot notes, in a commentary based on John’s account—are indignant at the gesture’s expense, asking could not this costly ointment be sold and its profits given to the poor? However, Jesus defends Mary’s prescience: “She did it,” he tells them, “for my burial.”\n\nMEDIUM Opaque watercolor over graphite on gray wove paper\n\nPlace Made: France\n\nDATES 1886–1894\n\nDIMENSIONS Image: 8 3/4 x 10 15/16 in.
