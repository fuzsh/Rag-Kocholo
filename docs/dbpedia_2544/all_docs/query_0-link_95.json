        "text": "The most terrifying thing that can happen to a patent owner is receiving an inter partes review (IPR) petition. This is a tool that accused infringers can use to invalidate patents. And they have … to alarming effect. As we’ve discussed, the kill rate at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) is staggering. The PTAB – or, as regular listeners of this audience more commonly know it, the “Patent Death Squad” – has racked up a claim execution rate north of 84% and the death of thousands of valid patents at the hands of infringers looking to profit from innovations they didn’t invest in to create. This is an institution that is clearly out of balance and screaming for reform.\n\nAnd while we continue to diligently work toward those necessary reform solutions, we also have to deal with the world as it is and craft the highest quality, most future-proof patents possible. So we’re dedicating Part 2 of our series on patent quality to creating a guide for how to help IPR-proof your patent – things you can do when you write and prosecute patent applications before an examiner to maximize the likelihood that the resulting patent will survive the IPR that it will eventually experience if it’s a valuable patent.\n\nDrafting and Prosecution Pointers to Help Survive an IPR\n\nOutside of building awareness, lobbying representatives, and voting accordingly, there’s not much we can do as practitioners and inventors when it comes to PTAB injustices like panel stacking, conflicts of interest, ethical codes, evidentiary standards, standing requirements, and serial petitioning. And while there is less that can be done for those who’ve already lost their property rights, knowing the rules of the game and reducing invalidation surface area for those currently in the drafting and prosecution stages can go a LONG WAY to increasing your odds of patent survival down the road. To help author this important guide, we’ve enlisted the help of someone who’s spent considerable time in the belly of the beast, successfully representing both petitioners and patent owners.\n\nGuest Host: Matt Phillips\n\nMatt Phillips is an experienced patent attorney and educator who draws from a deep well of real-world expertise built from both sides of the IPR table. His practice focuses on post-grant proceedings, including review proceedings at the PTAB, reexaminations, and reissues. According to Matt, post-grant proceedings are about 80% of what he’s done for the past 10-15 years. He also created and taught the “Post-Grant Patent Practice” course for the Patent Resources Group for eleven years and is a co-author of a two-volume treatise of the same name. Matt has taught as an adjunct law school professor. He has published over 40 articles on post-grant patent topics and has been an invited speaker around the country and internationally on post-grant topics.\n\nEpisode Overview: Quality Patents Part 2\n\nBuilding nicely on so much of the framework established by Kristen Hansen in the prior episode of this series on crafting quality patents, Matt and the panel discuss:\n\nWhat the PTAB is, its two primary functions, and what IPRs are\n\nWhy Matt thinks we need to reevaluate assumed best practices that were established pre-America Invents Act (AIA)\n\nMatt’s Top 10 (11) Prosecution Pointers to Survive an IPR\n\nBest Practices Paradigm Shift\n\nSome of these tips will seem unnatural and contrary to conventional wisdom. In fact, your first reaction might be that some of them are heretical. But times have changed. The AIA ushered in a sea change in the way patents are enforced and litigated. If you have not adapted your patent drafting and prosecution practices accordingly, you are doing a disservice to your clients. The old “best practices” do not always make sense anymore. Old-fashioned “best practices” would always strive for claim breadth and a breadth-preserving record. But that was premised on an assumption that an accused infringer would seek an “early out” of litigation by seeking summary judgment of noninfringement based on a narrow claim construction.\n\nToday, however, page one of every accused infringer’s playbook is to seek an early, cheap “out” by promptly filing an IPR petition at the PTAB and a motion for stay at the district court. Why? Because unpatentability can be easily shown with a mere preponderance of the evidence to PTAB judges who are comfortable finding claims obvious and strongly skeptical of secondary considerations. That’s a complete flip of the pre-AIA world. You now need to obtain patents with that in mind.\n\nMatt’s Prosecution Pointers to Survive an IPR\n\nFor the complete heretical context and justification, you’ll have to listen to the episode, but the following is a brief overview of Matt’s Top 10 … or rather 11 with the bonus because, as Matt says, “Like that amplifier in Spinal Tap, my list goes to 11”.\n\nConduct thorough pre-filing prior-art searches.\n\nInclude claims, claims, claims, and more claims.\n\nDraft a crystal-clear, super-detailed specification that unquestionably satisfies 35 U.S.C. § 112(a).\n\nDraft the application as if the claims as granted are set in stone and will be interpreted under the broadest reasonable interpretation, not just Phillips.\n\nConsider defining some claim terms.\n\nConsider using some “patent profanity.”\n\nConsider telling the story of the invention.\n\nBuild an evidence-laden prosecution history.\n\nKeep a continuation or divisional pending.\n\nIf no continuation is possible, consider reissue.\n\nFile for and obtain foreign patents.\n\nDiscussion Panel\n\nMatt is joined today by our always exceptional group of IP experts, including:\n\nAshley Sloat, President and Director of Patent Strategy at Aurora\n\nDavid Jackrel, President of Jackrel Consulting\n\nKristen Hansen, Patent Strategy Specialist at Aurora\n\nMarie Smyth, Patent Agent at Brake Hughes Bellermann LLP\n\nTy Davis, Patent Strategy Associate at Aurora\n\nMossoff Minute: Injunctive Relief Studies\n\nIn this month’s double-feature Mossoff Minute, Professor Adam Mossoff discusses a pair of recent studies featuring significant statistical analysis empirically proving that there are fundamental issues with the patent system when it comes to obtaining injunctions to stop infringers from stealing IP. A 2006 SCOTUS decision created a new test for receiving injunctions. It’s been widely asserted that this decision had radical, negative effects on patent owners’ abilities to enforce their property rights.\n\nThis claim has now been confirmed with a new study done by Kristina Acri née Lybecker of Colorado College in a rigorous statistical analysis. Since the eBay decision, patent owners who license patents have seen a reduction of 91.2% in their ability to obtain injunctions when people are using their patents without their permission (even manufacturing companies have seen a reduction of 66.7%!).\n\nThe justification for the decision is historically wrong. Adam also discusses his own research into the historical application of the four-factor test the Supreme Court wrongly relied upon in its decision that sent injunctive relief into its present death spiral.\n\nAfter recording, exciting news also broke that the RESTORE Act was introduced in Congress to restore the presumption that courts will issue an injunction to stop patent infringers. This bill has been sponsored by Senator Chris Coons, Senator Tom Cotton, Representative Nate Moran, and Representative Madeleine Dean. Stay tuned as we’ll be unpacking this news with Adam in next month’s installment. We’re also publishing excerpts as short-form videos on Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, and TikTok\n\nRelated Listening and Reading\n\nTo further explore the topics discussed, see the following past episodes and resources:"
