Jesus, Mary Magdalene, and Martha at Bethany (Jésus à Bethanie, Marie, Madeleine et Marthe)

James Tissot

European Art

Invited to Bethany, where the siblings Lazarus and Martha reside, Jesus finds respite from his ministry and peace to converse with friends. Intent on listening to Jesus, the Magdalene takes a place at his feet—much to the frustration of Martha, who expects her help with the guests, Tissot relates. The Magdalene’s devoted discipleship proves unflagging throughout the narrative from the ministry to the Passion and the Resurrection; and, accordingly, her posture here at the feet of Christ finds echoes in later episodes.
