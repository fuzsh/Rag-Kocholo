Her visionary approach and deep understanding of UX principles have consistently guided us in designing comprehensive end-to-end experiences. Her leadership style fosters a supportive and inclusive environment where everyone can thrive. Along with this recommendation, I want to express my gratitude.”\n\n“I worked with Ale at FutureGov as she led a growing Service Design team and community of practice. Ale was always completely dedicated to creating an environment for all of the team to thrive, providing support, and creating the time and space for that to happen. She has always been honest, open, and has provided plenty of constructive challenge and feedback when working with me. Ale sets a great example for others as a design leader and manager.”"
