        "text": "Did you know that withdrawing money abroad can cost you a lot of money: sometimes for 100 Euros you can pay 10 Euros fees. The same can happens while paying in a shop with your credit card. It probably also already happened to you. You just didn’t notice. We tell you some tricks how avoid this and how to pay the best.\n\nYesterday I met a German guy on the petrol station in Poznan (Poland) who asked my: »Where is the closest place to exchange money?« – »Why you don’t you use your credit card and the ATM?«, I asked him. – »Because the exchange rate on the cash machine is so bad«, he answered. That was the moment when I understood I really have to write this blog post. He was simply tricked by the cash machine and also while paying for his petrol again.\n\nSome years ago, when I started to travel to Poland more often I had the same reflex: I better change my money on the train station at the currency exchange office (“Kantor” in Polish). The lady there offered an exchange rate of: 1 Euro = 4,25 Polish Zloty (PLN). At the same time the cash machine next to her office offered me an exchange rate of 1 Euro = 3.85 Polish Zloty.\n\nThat’s a difference of nearly 10 percent. »Crazy!«, I thought. So I started to research, how this can happen.\n\nIf you don’t feel like understanding everything, there is summary at the end of this post.\n\nHow the exchange office earns money?\n\nIf you ask Google for an exchange rate you will get the mid market rates (which is a value between the selling the buying prices on the global currency market). This gives you a slight feeling of what you might expect, when exchanging money abroad.\n\nA local exchange office usually has an service fee (e.g. 5%). To find out the best options I called today some exchange office and banks and Berlin and asked: »How many Euros do you give me for 10.000 Polish Zlotys (PLN)?«\n\nIn Berlin downtown Euro Change offices you get 2,173 Euros (1 € = 4,60 PLN). At TraxelEx at the Berlin Tegel Airport the rate was – like usually on airports – worse: 2,033 Euros (1 € = 4,92 PLN). But if you change your money in Warsaw (for example at Kantor Apollo) you would get 2,347 Euros. Finally I still called the hotline of my bank (HVB UniCredit). The lady told my: »Why do you ask me an not Google?« – »Google told me to expect 2,354 Euro. But I guess that’s not what you will give me.« After 10 Minutes she found out, that it’s not so easy and I actually just get 2,145 Euro (1€ = 4,66) – which is 209 Euros (or 9 percent less than Google told me). What did I learn?\n\nIf you have cash and want to use an exchange office you should:\n\ncompare exchange rates between you country and your abroad destination before you start. At the Berlin Airport you loose 13 percent compared to the Warsaw office. That’s a difference of 314 Euros!\n\nDon’t change everything at the airports. In most of the cases you find better rates in downtown offices.\n\nCheck Google before to get an approximate feeling for the exchange rate you can expect.\n\nBut usually I prefer not to have too much cash in my pockets. So how about debit/credit cards and ATMs?\n\nHow to avoid bad exchange rates at the ATMs and in shops?\n\nLet’s come back to the guy on the petrol station. If you travel to a foreign country with another currency the cash machine will to ask if you want to withdrawal with currency conversion or without currency conversion. Here you should always use the without conversion option.\n\nWithout conversion means, that your local bank will exchange the money. This will give you a good exchange rate. If you choose instead the with conversion option (= dynamic currency conversion), you will get a guaranteed exchange rate, but the ATM/bank can add an up to 10 percent service fee. This is where you loose money. But you can avoid this by using the without conversion option.\n\nI noticed that EuroNet ATMs are usually really expensive. If you use the without conversion some ATMs even show sometimes Warning – Do you really want to do that? In my opinion this is a fraud and it should be forbidden! However – you know what to do!\n\nHow to avoid credit card service fees at the ATM?\n\n– With Credit Cards –\n\nThere are several way to withdrawal money in other countries without any fee. Some banks offer credit cards that allow you to get money for free.\n\nThe best you can do in Germany is getting a Visa Card of the DKB bank. Since many years I have such a card I never pay any fees. If you are from Germany, you should definitely use the free DKB Bank Visa Card. To get the card takes some days, so better do it now.\n\nThere are also other bank that offer such a credit card, but they either cost a lot of money every year (e.g at Deutsche Bank) or they are hard to get (e.g. Santander Bank). So in Germany the DKB Visa Card is the best option.\n\nIf you do not have such a card you pay with a credit card usually 1,75% fee.\n\n– With Maestro-/ EC-Cards / v Pay –\n\nAt home you usually can withdrawal money for free with a EC-Card/Meastro when you go to an ATM of you bank or some partner bank. This does not necessarily work in other countries, but it is worth to check carefully the website of your bank.\n\nWith my Maestro Card of the German HVB Unicredit and get money at all Unicredit banks/partner banks in all over Europe. Check the website of your bank to check where you can get money without any charge. Deutsche Bank also has partner banks in many Countries. So before you go on a trip, check the website of your bank!\n\nIf your bank does not have a partner bank you will pay between 3 and 10 Euros. That’s a lot.\n\nHow to pay the in a shop without fees?\n\nWithin the Euro zone you usually also do not pay fees with the Maestro / EC Card / vPay when you pay in a shop or restaurant.\n\nBut if you pay in a country with another currency (like Germans in Poland, Czech Republic or Switzerland – or the other way round) you will have a fee of 1% (at least at Unicredit). So every payment in the shop coasts me between 1.50 Euro (min) and 5.50 Euros (max). With a credit card (Visa, Master Card) I would pay 1.75 percent of the price. So cash is the only option without fees in non Euro countries.\n\nBut also in the shop they play the excange rate fraud: When paying at this Polish petrol, the lady also asked me: »Do you want to pay in Euro or Polish Zloty«? Thats’s the same thing like on the cash machine – “With conversion or without?”. Here the right answer is »In Zloty«. Always use the local currency! The payment terminal companies to do the same trick as the cash machine – if you convert from your home currency they add the same service charge (at the petrol station the difference 9 percent).\n\nSummary – what is the best way to pay?\n\nSo – what is the best way to get money and to pay in a foreign country?\n\nIf you are from and you pay within the Eurozone:\n\nNo ATM fee: Check the website of your bank about and find ou in which foreign (partner) bank you can withdrawl for free with you EC / Maestro / vPay card\n\nNo shop fee: Just pay in the shop with you EC / Maestro / vPay card and you will have no fees (But: this does not apply for Credit Cards like Master Card or Visa Card)\n\nIf the country you visit has a different currency than your home country …..\n\nNo ATM fee: Check the website of your bank about and find out in which foreign (partner) bank you can withdrawl for free with you EC / Maestro / vPay card\n\nNo ATM fee: Check if there’s a bank which offers a credit card for travelling without fees on ATMs. In Germany you can for example start a free account at DKB bank and withdrawl worldwide for free\n\nNo exchange fee: If you withdrawal, always us the option: no currency conversion.\n\nNo shop free: Only if you pay with cash you will not have any fees in the shop. Get your money at the ATM.\n\nGood exchange rates: If you have to exchange money, check first online to get an idea about average course. Don’t change all you money at the airports – the have usually worse rates. Check if it’s better to change at home or in the country of your destination.\n\nAll those little details I learned and checked on my own, during our little and big family travels. Right now I don’t even want to think how much money we have lost in those games;), but since I know now more about it – I wanted to share it with all of you. If you have also some tips – just give us a comment!\n\nIf you think this information is worth sharing – ↓ there are the buttons for it ;) Thanks.\n\nThis post is also available in: German\n\nOur first book is out!"
