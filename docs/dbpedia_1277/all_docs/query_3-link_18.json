She should have given up immediately ... to make a statement - visible to the audience and the world. 2) Imane is a coward and psychopath who obviously doesn't have the guts to box against men - and can only beat up girls. He is a disgrace. 3) The problem was introduced from the top. The solution can only come from the bottom. 4) The power lies with the women. They must say NO. As in the French Revolution. As in #metoo. Women's sports need a #ustoo movement. It takes courageous women to start it; and courageous referees and officials to support it. Every woman who competes against a biological man is hurting women's sports - and therefore women. Anyone who watches and perhaps even applauds is a disgrace to humanity. To all women: Unite and stand up against this crap. Together you are strong!\n\nKudos to Knights üíú of Bengal for such commanding performance at Finals to clinch the trophy for 3rd time after a decade. This won't be possible without the GOATam's guidance or Narine's burst at the top or Shreyas on field decisions but maybe the most important of all is Abhishek Nayar's who built the solid Indian core in Mumbai throughout the year. Knight Riders Sports - Kolkata, Trinbago, Abu Dhabi and Los Angeles Knight Riders looked invincibles in this #TATAIPL & only got beaten thrice which is least number of defeats to win IPL matching Inaugural edition number with RR. But they got an huge headache as to to retain whom & whom not going into mega auctions. Huge shoutout to the #OrangeArmy üß°who changed the outlook of T20 Cricket with record breaking totals, highest score of 125 in powerplay only & really played exhilarating game till league stage but ran out of gas in latter half to elude them from Gold. Nonetheless this has been super Spectacle season as an audience as in earlier season we used to get bore in the middle of the season as it felt like overdose but this time with Highest scores being chased [262 by PBKS] & 1260 Sixes most in 17 IPL. It didn't not felt like not watching at any point of time. Great to know that BCCI has also decided to reward all groundsmen & curators with 10 lakhs as they prepared some lovely pitches. Mostly in #IPL2025 Impact player rule getting scrapped out, would love to see more emergence of pure all-rounders in the shortest version of this sport which India really seeksüëÄ Batters brings you Sponsorships & bowlers brings you Championships is quote used by KP/GG which is a fact backed by numbers & data. #AmiKKR\n\nDay 4 of #ParisOlympics 2024 is D-Day for India. Kindly Read to understand why - Today's performance will boost our medal tally or else we are heading for another below 10 performance. Athletes to watch out - Prediction #Shooting Manu/Sarabjot - Bronze ü•â Shreyasi Singh - Qualify #Rowing Balraj Panwar - Elimination in QF Men's #Hockey - Win vs IRE #Archery Bhajan Kaur and Ankita Bhakat - Advance To R/16 Dhiraj - Likely To Qualify for R/16 #Boxing Antim Panghal - Win #Equestrian - Anush might be a dark horse for India. #Badminton #Sat-Chi Duo is likely to win their game if they do so against a tough opponent it will be great. PS- They are already qualified for Quarter Finals A big day awaits India. I wish at least 90% of my prediction comes true it will be a big boost or else we are nowhere close to 10+ medals.\n\nThe Evolution of Cricket in India: From British Arrival to the First Match: Nex News Network www.nexnews.org Cricket, introduced to India by the British in the early 1700s, has a rich history that spans centuries. The first recorded cricket match in India took place in 1721, marking the beginning of a sport that would capture the nation's imagination for generations to come. In 1848, the Parsi community established the Oriental Cricket Club in Bombay, laying the foundation for organized cricket in India. This club, the first of its kind in the country, paved the way for the sport's popularity among Indians. Despite a slow start, cricket gained momentum as European teams began inviting Parsi players to participate in matches. In 1877, the first official cricket match was played in India, marking a significant milestone in the sport's history on the subcontinent. Today, cricket holds a special place in the hearts of millions of Indians, with the Indian Premier League (IPL) being one of the most-watched sporting events in the world. #CricketInIndia #IndianCricket #HistoricCricket #ParsiCricket #BritishIndia #FirstCricketMatch #OrientalCricketClub #CricketHistory #SportsInIndia #IndianSports #ParsiCommunity #IPL #CricketFever #SportingHeritage #IndianCulture #CricketLegacy #ColonialSports #IndianSportsHistory #CricketEvolution #FirstMatch1877\n\nLast chance at both redemption and legacy for India‚Äôs legendary duo The sight of Virat Kohli consoling Rohit Sharma after India‚Äôs semi final win told a deep story. One is global brand with a worldwide fan base. The other is a lovable superstar who has humanized stardom in the country. One has a rockstar persona while the other‚Äôs whimsical nature and a seemingly out of shape physique makes you question his fitness. For the last decade, Virat and Rohit have carried the baton from Tendulkar, Dravid and Ganguly and continued the legacy of the great Indian batsman. Both of them have had hall of fame careers, with their names firmly placed right at the top of Indian batting echelon. And while both of them are World Cup winners, curiously neither of them have won it together. Which is why the wounds from Ahmedabad 2023 still run deep especially for these two batting greats. Both Virat and Rohit had stellar campaigns last year, but neither could bat India out of trouble on a tricky pitch in the final. Many people believed that it was a time for change, with some even debating whether we should include both of them for this year‚Äôs T20 campaign. And during this tournament, while both have showed flashes, neither of them have come close to their imperious best as in previous WC campaigns. It is unlikely we will see both of them again when the next WC rolls around, which is why Sunday is their last shot at both redemption and legacy. For two people who have given so much joy to a generation of Indians, Virat and Rohit have the fans behind them like never before. 140Cr will be cheering India, with a special emphasis on the opening pair. If this is a Bollywood movie, the ending is set in stone. But cricket does not necessarily write happy endings does it?!\n\n#Talentserve#task51#blog1 IPL Success Stories: Inspiring Journeys of Overcoming Challenges and Achieving Greatness: Rising Beyond Boundaries: IPL Success Stories - Tales of Triumph, Grit, and Glory Chris Gayle: The Unstoppable Force.
