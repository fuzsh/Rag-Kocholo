        "text": "Big surprise at Concord Iasi Open! The main favorite, eliminated in the round of 16. Four Romanians qualified in the quarters of the doubles event\n\nThe 5th edition of the ATP Challenger 100 Concord Iași Open scheduled, on Wednesday, at the Ciric Sports Base, the first four matches of the round of 16 in the singles draw, as well as seven matches of the first round in doubles.\n\nAfter four of the seeds left the race in the first round, today we had another big surprise.\n\nThe main favorite, the Argentine Camilo Ugo Carabelli, ranked 100 ATP, was eliminated in the round of 16 by the French Valentin Royer, world number 204, score 7-6 (3), 6-2, after a match that lasted one hour and 50 minutes .\n\nRoyer will play in the quarters with the sixth favorite, the Bolivian Hugo Dellien, the 171st ATP place, the one who defeated the Jordanian Abdullah Shelbayh in minimum sets, score 6-4, 6-4. With the same score, the Spanish Javier Barranco Cosano passed the Ukrainian Vitaliy Sachko.\n\nAnd Argentina's Juan Pablo Ficovich advances to the quarterfinals, after a three-set victory over Russia's Bogdan Bobrov, who came from the qualifiers, score 4-6, 6-1, 6-2. Until the eighth, Bobrov eliminated the Romanian players Matei Onofrei, Dan Tomescu and Filip Jianu.\n\nIn the quarters, Ficovich will meet the Spaniard Cosano.\n\nFour Romanians in the quarters of the doubles event\n\nAlso on Wednesday, the last seven matches of the first round of the doubles were played, in which five Romanian players were trained.\n\nMatei Onofrei from Iași qualified for the quarters together with Tomas Lipovsek Puches from Argentina, the two benefiting from the abandonment of the favorite pair 3 formed by the Frenchman Jonathan Eysseric and the American George Goldhoff, after only one game (1-0).\n\nAlexandru Jecan also qualified for the quarterfinals, together with Polish Szymon Walkow, after 6-2, 7-6 (3) with the couple Dmitry Popko (Kazakhstan) / Aisam-Ul-Haq Qureshi (Pakistan).\n\nInstead, Gabi Boitan and Dan Alexandru Tomescu stopped in the first round, being eliminated by the favorite pair 4 consisting of Poles Karol Drzewiecki and Piotr Matuszewski, score 6-4, 6-3.\n\nDaniel Uță also left the tournament in the first round. The Romanian player, aged only 17, was paired with the experienced Czech Jiri Vesely, 30 years old, and the two succumbed to the pair of Luis Brito (Brazil) / Roy Stepanov (Israel).\n\nCezar Crețu and Bogdan Pavel also qualified in the quarters of the doubles event on Tuesday.\n\nCezar Crețu and Gabi Boitan play on Thursday for a place in the quarters\n\nOn Thursday, the last four matches of the round of 16 at the Concord Iași Open are scheduled, and the two representatives of our country remaining in the race, Cezar Crețu and Gabi Boitan, will also be on the scoreboard. Both Romanian players eliminated one seed each in the first round.\n\nCezar Crețu from Iesian, 23 years old, 376th ATP place, will play with Dmitry Popko, from Kazakhstan, 27 years old, world number 222. Last week, Popko contested the final of the ATP Challenger 75 tournament in Brașov, being defeated by the Bolivian Murkel Dellien, 3-6, 5-7.\n\nThe Kazakh eliminated in Brașov, among others, Ștefan Paloși (in the round of 16) and Filip Jianu (in the quarterfinals). Crețu stopped in the quarters in Brașov, being eliminated by the Bosnian Nerman Fatic.\n\nFor his part, Gabi Adrian Boitan, 24 years old, ATP place 382, ​​will play in the round of 16 with the Spaniard Martin Landaluce, 18 years old, world number 304, a player who is preparing at Rafael Nadal's Academy. Boitan will enter first on \"Central\", not before 16.30, and after his match Cezar Crețu will play, in the fourth match on the central arena. No Romanian player has reached the quarter-finals stage in Iași in the first 4 editions, so Boitan and Crețu could tick off a first at the Ciric Sports Base on Thursday.\n\nIt should be noted that so far 5 favorites have been eliminated at the Concord Iasi Open: the Argentinian Ugo Camilo Carabelli (1), the Spanish Albert Ramos Vinolas (2), the Argentinian Roman Andres Burruchaga (4), the American Nicolas Moreno de Alboran (5) and the Brazilian Gustavo Heide (7).\n\nFull results for Wednesday, July 10:\n\nSimple / Optimal\n\n[6] Hugo Dellien (Bolivia) - Abdullah Shelbayh (Jordan) 6-4, 6-4\n\nJavier Barranco Cosano (Spain) - [Alt] Vitaliy Sachko (Ukraine) 6-4, 6-4\n\nJuan Pablo Ficovich (Argentina) - [Q] Bogdan Bobrov (Russia) 4-6, 6-1, 6-2\n\nValentin Royer (France) - [1] Camilo Ugo Carabelli (Argentina) 7-6 (3), 6-2\n\nDouble / Round I\n\nLuis Britto (Brazil) / Roy Stepanov (Israel) - [WC] Daniel Uță (Romania) / Jiri Vesely (Czech Republic) 6-3, 7-6 (2)\n\n[1] Luis David Martinez (Venezuela) / Cristian Rodriguez (Colombia) vs Scott Duncan (Great Britain) / Hunter Reese (USA) 6-2, 7-6 (3)\n\nAlexandru Jecan (Romania) / Szymon Walkow (Poland) - Dmitry Popko (Kazakhstan) / Aisam-Ul-Haq Qureshi (Pakistan) 6-2, 7-6 (3)\n\n[4] Karol Drzewiecki (Poland) / Piotr Matuszewski (Poland) vs [Other] Gabi Adrian Boitan (Romania) / Dan Alexandru Tomescu (Romania) 6-4, 6-3\n\n[2] Anirudh Chandrasekar (India) / Arjun Kadhe (India) - Abdullah Shelbayh (Jordan) / Adolfo Daniel Vallejo (Paraguay) 7-6 (6), 6-2\n\n[Other] Tomas Lipovsek Puches (Argentina) / Matei Cristian Onofrei (Romania) vs [3] Jonathan Eysseric (France) / George Goldhoff (USA) 1-0 withdrawal\n\nVladyslav Orlov (Ukraine) / David Stevenson (Great Britain) - Hugo Dellien (Bolivia) / Murkel Dellien (Bolivia) 6-2, 6-1\n\n---\n\nSchedule for Thursday, July 11:\n\nCentral Ground / Start time 12.00\n\n[3] Juan Manuel Cerundolo (Argentina) vs Adolfo Daniel Vallejo (Paraguay)\n\n[8] Enzo Couacaud (France) vs Dalibor Svrcina (Czech Republic)\n\nNot before 4:30 p.m\n\nMartin Landaluce (Spain) vs [WC] Gabi Adrian Boitan (Romania)\n\nDmitry Popko (Kazakhstan) vs [WC] Cezar Cretu (Romania)\n\nField 5 / Start time 13.00\n\n[4] Karol Drzewiecki (Poland) / Piotr Matuszewski (Poland) vs Vladyslav Orlov (Ukraine) / David Stevenson (Great Britain)\n\n[1] Luis David Martinez (Venezuela) / Cristian Rodriguez (Colombia) vs Alexandru Jecan (Romania) / Szymon Walkow (Poland)\n\nLuis Britto (Brazil) / Roy Stepanov (Israel) vs [Alt] Tomas Lipovsek Puches (Argentina) / Matei Cristian Onofrei (Romania)"
