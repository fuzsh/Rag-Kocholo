        "text": "Nets at Pacers, 7 p.m. Friday, FSI\n\nIn a season featuring a remolded offense, a deeper roster and a change in philosophy, coach Frank Vogel is still adjusting as the Indiana Pacers progress. On nights such as Wednesday, Vogel finds himself having to prepare more before games than he did the past two years.\n\nNot only did Vogel have to study for the Dallas Mavericks, but he also needed to take a close look at his Pacers. His plan came down to one question, one he will ask himself many times this season: Which lineup – the small, spread one or a traditional one with two tall defenders to protect the paint – best benefits the Pacers that night?\n\nWith each game, Vogel is learning more about his team and how its ability to be flexible can be a strength. Vogel’s decision to play a traditional lineup against the Mavericks for much of the game led the Pacers to a 107-81 victory.\n\nThe determining factor for Vogel was Dirk Nowitzki, the Mavericks’ 7-foot aging star and leading scorer. Vogel wanted Lavoy Allen and Jordan Hill to guard Nowitzki rather than have C.J. Miles, a 6-6 perimeter player, have to take on a tough defensive assignment. Allen and Hill were able to effectively guard Nowitzki, who finished with 13 points on 6-of-16 shooting.\n\n“It really wasn’t a difficult decision,” Vogel said of playing the big lineup. “Every game every year we just get a little better understanding of who we are, this year probably more than ever because of the different combinations we’re playing, the different matchups. Hopefully we keep making good decisions with it.”\n\n• BOX SCORE: Pacers 107, Mavericks 81\n\nIan Mahinmi was able to alter many of the Mavericks’ shots at the rim. From there, the Pacers (15-9) played solid perimeter defense and controlled the tempo.\n\nThis game, unlike many this season, did not feature many plays that were produced in the open court or in transition. That allowed Vogel to direct his team more from the sideline and the Pacers, particularly in the second half, ran their offense to precision.\n\nThe Pacers outscored the Mavericks 62-34 after halftime.\n\n“I think our guys have adapted to the offensive versatility of playing with two bigs and the structure that comes along with that verses the randomness of playing with a spread lineup,” Vogel said before the game. “We’re continuing to grow with a right balance of when to be big and when to be small, making sure we’re using our weapons the right way.”\n\nC.J. Miles, who came off the bench in order for Allen to start at the power forward position, led the Pacers with 20 points on 7-of-13 shooting. Miles said he understood why Vogel wanted him to not start because he could match up with Dallas’ Chandler Parsons when the Mavericks tried to play a small lineup.\n\nThat move allowed Miles to lead the Pacers’ second unit. He finished with the Pacers outscoring the Mavericks by 13 points in his 28 minutes.\n\n“He’s been good and it took us a little while to get used to it because we had a stretch where we played so many games the same way,” Miles said of Vogel. “Now as the season goes, and we know a switch (to the lineup) could be coming, it’s easy to flip over the switch. I think the other thing (Vogel) is looking at is their second unit. If their second unit is going to be really small, then you start big because Lavoy can guard Dirk and then I can come in so that we don’t have to change our game plan during the game.”\n\nPaul George and Monta Ellis each finished with 19 points despite struggling to find their rhythm at times.\n\nEllis had his worst shooting half of the season against his former team in the first half. He missed his first nine shots, but adjusted and attacked the basket more to make seven of his nine attempts in the second half.\n\n“I love to see them aggressive, I love to see them attacking,” George said of Miles and Ellis. “It just opens the game up for everyone.”\n\nGeorge played Wednesday despite having an upper respiratory infection that forced him to miss practice Tuesday. He still felt pain in his chest during the team’s shootaround hours before the game, but felt his condition had improved enough to be on the court.\n\n“I felt all right,” George said. “I had a couple moments here and there wheezing, but for the most part I was good.”\n\nAllen leaves game with injury\n\nAllen hobbled off the court during the third quarter after he sprained his right ankle after making a driving layup. Vogel called a timeout after the next possession when he noticed Allen was in pain. Allen was taken into the locker room after he appeared to land on another player’s foot.\n\nHe finished with eight points and four rebounds in 18 minutes.\n\n“He just told me he rolled it and that it wasn’t that bad,” Vogel said.\n\nCall Star reporter Nate Taylor at (317) 444-6484.
