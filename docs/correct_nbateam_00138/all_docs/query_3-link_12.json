        "text": "The 2011 championship holds a special place in his heart, as it is the greatest moment of his career. But at the same time, it is also an unforgettable moment for NBA fans. “I hope many people remember that championship. People still remember it like it was yesterday ,” said the veteran center. For that success to come, of course, the group of players that had been created also played a role. “I played alongside great players. Dirk Nowitzki did great things, Jason Kidd too, Jason Terry, JJ Barea, Tyson Chandler. They were all amazing characters, they came together and found a way to lead the team to the title” , he underlined, before standing on what people tell him when they meet him on the street.\n\nBy the numbers, on a personal level, the 2010-11 season was not the most productive of his career. “I don’t know if it was the most enjoyable, but it was definitely the most memorable,” he replies bluntly, just before explaining the degree of difficulty involved in winning the championship in the top basketball league on the planet. “People don’t understand how hard it is to win an NBA championship. It’s terribly difficult. When you win you achieve something great that changes your life forever. Since 2011 I have managed to achieve something that cannot be compared with anything. It’s a unique moment and that’s what makes it special. You see teams that won 2,3,4,5 championships. You can’t understand how difficult it is to achieve something like that . “\n\nFormer NBA star Ian Mahinmi, who won the 2011 Championship with the Dallas Mavericks, has tipped the Milwaukee Bucks to defend their title this year, even ahead of a ‘young’ Mavs side. Mahinmi, who was a guest at the Basketball Africa League [BAL] launch of the refurbished Tersana Sports Club basketball court in Cairo, felt that the Bucks, who lead the Bulls 1-0 in the Playoffs, were peaking at the right time. “Obviously, it’s really hard to go against the champs, especially when I feel that the Bucks have gotten better over the summer,” Mahinmi told ESPN. “They’ve played tremendously well to [get into] a position where they’re getting to the playoffs with momentum; they’re getting in the playoffs healthy. If I had to put my money on something, it would be the Bucks [winning the title]."
