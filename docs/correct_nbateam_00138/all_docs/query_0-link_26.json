        "text": "LAS VEGAS - Newest Maverick Ian Mahinmi will make his debut with the team in the final two Summer League games.\n\nAs expected, the Mavericks came to terms Monday with Mahinmi, the 6-11 center who has spent the last three seasons with San Antonio, although he missed all of 2008-09 with an ankle injury.\n\nMahinmi agreed to a two-year contract that starts at the NBA veteran's minimum of about $850,000.\n\nA big reason why he is signing with the Mavericks is Roddy Beaubois. The two have been close friends for some time and will play together this summer on the French national team at the World Championships.\n\n\"He's a very good friend of mine and he's a good player,\" Beaubois said of Mahinmi. \"He'll be good for our team. I've never played with him, but he's my boy and he likes to work and wants to get better. I'm happy for him\"\n\nRick Carlisle said it was Mahinmi's potential that has the Mavericks excited.\n\n\"He's a young, athletic big guy that we like as a prospect,\" Carlisle said. \"He can help us a little now and we think he can get better.\"\n\nThe 230-pound Mahinmi played sparingly with the Spurs, seeing more action with the National Basketball Development League Austin Toros. In 26 games with the Spurs last year, Mahinmi averaged 3.9 points and 2.0 rebounds.\n\nMavs get first summer win: The Mavericks got off the goose egg in Summer League play Monday night, thanks to J.R. Giddens and Beaubois.\n\nGiddens, the former first-round pick of the Boston Celtics, caught an inbounds lob pass with 0.3 seconds left and quickly flipped it in to force overtime. Then Beaubois took over with a 3-pointer with 28.9 seconds to go and a mid-range jumper with 1 second left in overtime to secure a 73-72 victory. The Mavericks are 1-2 in the summer league.\n\nBeaubois had 15 points and seven assists, although he did turn the ball over six times.\n\nStern warnings: NBA commissioner David Stern and representatives from all 30 teams met in Las Vegas to talk about collective bargaining and about questions raised by Mavericks' owner Mark Cuban about players tampering during the week leading up to free agency.\n\nStern made it clear he has no problem with players talking with each other about free agency.\n\nBut he also said that LeBron James and Cleveland owner Dan Gilbert could have handled the situation better.\n\n\"Had he [James] asked my advice in advance, I might have suggested that he advise Cleveland at an earlier time than apparently he did that he was leaving, even without announcing where he was going,\" Stern said. \"I would have advised him not to embark on what has been come known as 'The Decision,' I think that the advice that he received on this was poor. His performance was fine. His honesty and his integrity shine through. But this decision was illconceived, badly produced and poorly executed.\""
