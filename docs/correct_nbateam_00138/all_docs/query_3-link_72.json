        "text": "Mahinmi announced Tuesday during an appearance on BeIn Sports' \"NBA Extra Show\" that he has retired from professional basketball.\n\nAfter not finding an opportunity at the NBA level or playing overseas in 2020-21, the 34-year-old Mahinmi had already looked to be trending toward retirement, but it wasn't until Tuesday that he officially confirmed as much. A 2005 first-round pick, Mahinmi spent parts of 12 seasons in the NBA with San Antonio, Dallas, Indiana and Washington, bringing most of his value on the defensive end. He retires with averages of 5.2 points and 4.4 rebounds in 16.8 minutes per game over 618 career regular-season appearances. He captured his lone NBA championship as a member of the Mavericks in 2010-11.\n\nMahinmi (groin) is available for Saturday's scrimmage against the Clippers, Fred Katz of The Athletic reports.\n\nMahinmi missed the Wizards' first scrimmage while dealing with a minor groin injury. Since then, he's healed, and he'll take the court against the Clippers.\n\nMahinmi will not play in Wednesday's scrimmage against the Nuggets due to a groin injury, Fred Katz of The Athletic reports.\n\nThe injury isn't anything serious, but the Wizards are opting to be extra cautious for a scrimmage. With Thomas Bryant likely to only play around eight minutes as well, Moritz Wagner should see plenty of action.\n\nPer head coach Scott Brooks, Mahinmi (foot) will play on Friday against the Cavaliers.\n\nAfter initially being deemed questionable on Thursday for Friday's game against the Cavaliers, Mahinmi will suit up. Following the all-star break, the big man will look to continue a relatively impressive year in which he has averaged a career high in blocks per game.\n\nMahinmi is questionable for Friday's contest against Cleveland due to a right foot injury, Chase Hughes of NBC Sports Washington reports.\n\nIt's unclear exactly how Mahinmi suffered the foot injury, as the center nearly tallied a double-double over 30 minutes of action in the Wizards' final contest before the All-Star break. Nevertheless, Mahinmi is officially deemed questionable Friday.\n\nMahinmi had nine points (3-7 FG, 3-4 FT), 10 rebounds, one assist, one steal and one block in 30 minutes during Wednesday's 114-96 win over the Knicks.\n\nMahinmi continues to hold down the fort as the starting center with Thomas Bryant (foot) still sidelined. It's unclear if Bryant will be ready to return after the All-Star break and, as long as he's not available, Mahinmi makes for a decent dart throw in daily leagues on nights when the matchup is on the friendly side.\n\nMahinmi will remain in the starting lineup Monday against the Warriors, Fred Katz of The Athletic reports.\n\nWashington is getting both Rui Hachimura and Moe Wagner back from injury, but the Wizards will stick with Mahinmi at center, with Wagner and Thomas Bryant coming off the bench. At some point, Bryant will likely recapture the starting job, but the Wizards are keeping him on a minutes limit for the time being.\n\nMahinmi had 21 points (9-10 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 2-3 FT) to go with seven rebounds, three blocks, two steals and one assist in 23 minutes Monday in the Wizards' 106-100 win over the Pistons.\n\nThe performance was easily one of the best of the season for Mahinmi, who continues to start at center even with Thomas Bryant having since returned from a foot injury. The efficiency from the field in particular was impressive from Mahinmi, but he shouldn't be expected to replicate this sort of output on the offensive end moving forward. Moreover, the likelihood that Bryant gradually moves into a 30-minute role would suppress Mahinmi's chances of making a consistent impact.\n\nMahinmi racked up 15 points (5-7 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 4-4 FT), seven assists, six rebounds, two steals and one block in 31 minutes during Sunday's 127-116 loss to the Jazz.\n\nMahinmi finished with a career high in assists while producing an extremely well-rounded and efficient stat line. Thomas Bryant (foot) returned to the lineup following a six-game absence but did so in a reserve role and is expected to be eased back into the flow slowly. As a result, Mahinmi may be in line to earn another sizable share of minutes during Wednesday's matchup versus the Bulls."
