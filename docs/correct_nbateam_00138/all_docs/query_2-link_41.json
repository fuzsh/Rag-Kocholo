Barnes and Huerter are signed beyond this season, however, and the Bulls likely are looking for expiring money in return for DeRozan.In addition, with Chicago being only $11 million from the tax line with 13 contracts in hand, the Bulls almost certainly don't want to take back much money from Sacramento.Thus, the biggest complication here seems to be the Kings would need to pay two different teams in draft capital: First, to a team with room or a large trade exception like the Pistons or Jazz to take one of Barnes, Lyles or Huerter, and second, to the Bulls for completing the DeRozan sign-and-trade.(Note Chicago could likely take a smaller contract like that of McDaniels' $4.7 million or Duarte's $5.8 million off their hands as part of the deal — McDaniels can't be aggregated to offset DeRozan's salary, but he can still be in the trade — but Sacramento still needs to find a landing zone for a larger contract).So, if you're wondering why we aren't progressing more quickly from \"mutual interest\" to a deal, that's why.There are a lot of complicated moving parts here, and in addition the three clearly interested parties (the Kings, the Bulls and DeRozan), it almost certainly requires another team's involvement to get to the finish line. Lastly, one final, small wrinkle to watch for: If Sacramento is sending Duarte or McDaniels to Chicago, the Bulls could include veteran forward Torrey Craig as offsetting salary, which would thus allow them to get the maximal trade exception for DeRozan's outbound salary.",

Replacement players can be a great band-aid over a wound in need of stitches. The Clippers have done an admirable job, but they're still worse off.\n\nAs for the Nuggets, there isn't a planet where replacing Kentavious Caldwell-Pope with Christian Braun is good, especially considering they currently have no backups for Braun.\n\nWith the Bulls, I guess maybe DeMar DeRozan could return to Chicago, but this team needs to do a full teardown. Trading Alex Caruso for Josh Giddey was not enough. Unfortunately for them, the Bulls can't give Zach LaVine away in a trade right now.\n\nAs for Atlanta, I believe it's worse after the Dejounte Murray trade and plugging a solid rookie into the rotation with new No. 1 overall pick Zaccharie Risacher. The Hawks are hoping addition by subtraction will help their fate.\n\nSign up to receive to The Bounce, The Athletic's daily NBA newsletter.\n\nIt’s pretty obvious OKC, fresh off 57 wins last season, got better by adding Alex Caruso and Isaiah Hartenstein while giving up only Josh Giddey. The Thunder should be atop the West again. While some have concerns about Dallas losing Derrick Jones Jr., Naji Marshall can defend, and 34-year-old Klay Thompson still knows how to shoot and play team ball. Also, the Mavericks have a full training camp and preseason with Daniel Gafford and P.J. Washington, two midseason additions who transformed their defense on the fly. The Spurs upgrading their point guard rotation by going from experiments (Jeremy Sochan) to one of the wisest ever (Chris Paul) will help transform them.\n\nAlso, I know this will sound crazy to many – and maybe it'll be proven dumb at some point – but I think the Warriors sneakily got better. Yes, it sucks to lose Thompson, and we can’t undervalue them losing CP3 too. But they're bringing in De'Anthony Melton, Kyle Anderson and Buddy Hield. Golden State is deeper, is bigger, has more defense and added one hell of a shooter in Hield. Maybe Hield is not as good as prime Thompson, but he's more accurate than the current version.\n\nSign up to receive to The Bounce, The Athletic's daily NBA newsletter.\n\nIt’ll be jarring to witness, the Warriors' rock star in another band. Paired with Luka Dončić and not Steph Curry.\n\nBut as the old adage goes, loving something means letting it go. Love's hardest and yet most necessary gesture is liberation, the sacrifice required to accept absence in the name of freedom. Klay's gift to the Bay Area, outside of his most beautiful shooting form and the indelible moments he created, was his sovereignty.\n\nHe moved as a free spirit in an industry of concocted personalities within an era of trends and conformity. His ability and willingness to choose his path, veering away from the box of his profession, in some way granted permission for his fans to do the same. Riding with Klay meant being yourself. Klay Thompson was his own man.\n\nThat's why he had to go. Because for the last five years, Klay hasn't been free. He with the liberated aura had become imprisoned. His determination to recapture his past, to reach the Hall of Fame bar he set for himself, seemed so consuming as to entrap him.\n\nRead the rest of my column on Klay Thompson's departure.\n\nThe Knicks have amended the Mikal Bridges trade, league sources tell The Athletic, a move that has been likely since they and the Brooklyn Nets agreed to the swap on June 25. New York will now include 27-year-old forward Mamadi Diakite and free-agent guard Shake Milton, who it will sign-and-trade, according to league sources. Brooklyn will add Keita Bates-Diop.\n\nThe original construction of the trade (Bojan Bogdanović and a haul of draft picks for Bridges) entailed the Knicks taking back more money than they sent out, which would have hard capped them at the $178.1-million first apron. Had the Knicks not edited the exchange, their payroll would have been only $5 million shy of that number, which they could not have exceeded under any circumstances. Flexibility would have scrunched.\n\nNow, it won't.\n\nThe Knicks adding Milton's and Diakite's salaries to the deal isn't about saving themselves money. It's about opening up new possibilities.\n\nAs New York is now taking back less money than it's sending out in the trade, avoiding the hard cap at the first apron, it can venture as high as the $188.9-million second apron, which it is now approximately $15 million below.\n\nThat is enough room to re-sign big man Precious Achiuwa, who could earn anywhere from $5 million a year to a hair more than that, and use the taxpayer midlevel exception, a $5.2 million tool that allows the Knicks to sign a free agent for up to that price.\n\nRead more here.\n\nWith their first free agent agreement, the Milwaukee Bucks attempted to shore up the guard spots on their roster by grabbing 6-foot-5 combo guard Delon Wright. With this second agreement, the Bucks targeted greater depth at wing and forward.\n\nLast season, Taurean Prince appeared in 78 games and started 49 times for the Los Angeles Lakers under then-Lakers head coach (and current Bucks lead assistant coach) Darvin Ham. The 30-year-old Prince averaged 8.9 points and 2.9 rebounds in 27 minutes per game while knocking down 39.6 percent from 3 on 4.6 attempts from deep per game. While the 6-foot-6 wing with a 7-foot wingspan spent the majority of his time at power forward in his three stops before Los Angeles, Prince played small forward 70 percent of the time last season with the Lakers, according to positional estimates from Cleaning the Glass.\n\nPrince might not slot into the Bucks starting lineup with their core four, but he could be a valuable asset for the team off the bench, giving them size and shooting at small forward and also a potential forward in small-ball units with Giannis Antetokounmpo."
