        "text": "The 2010s are ending today. We already reflected back upon the 10 most meaningful Mavericks this decade, but it’s interesting to think about some things that almost happened, or could have happened, or maybe should have happened, and wonder what they might have been. Everything below is fiction, but that’s the fun of it.\n\nWhat if … the title team stayed together?\n\nIt’s this franchise’s most discussed and most debated What If of the decade. The 2011 team made a magical run fueled by Dirk Nowitzki’s unwavering will and a motley cast that fit together perfectly around him. It created memories, moments, emotions and legacies that will never fade. It cannot be taken away. And then, after achieving glory in Game 6 of those NBA Finals, after the champagne-fueled night that followed, after the off-key rendition of “We Are The Champions” sung by the German hero himself, that team departed ways and never played another game together again.\n\nThe ensuing lockout condensed the offseason timeline, but when the collective bargaining agreement was finally signed and Dallas began its free agency plans, the most notable plans were the ones the team didn’t have. There were no plans to offer a long-term deal to Tyson Chandler, Caron Butler or J.J. Barea. (Barea actually made the Mavericks promise that they would bring him back later in his career, which they held up.) You know the rest: the decline of the older guards, the condensed post-lockout schedule doing this older roster no favors, the commitment to cap space, the first-round sweep at the hands of the Oklahoma City Thunder. What if none of that happened? What if Dallas just brought back the title team?\n\nLet’s say Chandler and Barea both give Dallas slight discounts on the contracts they ultimately signed, so Chandler comes back on a four-year, $55 million deal while Barea signs for $3.5 million per season. Dallas always seemed likely to let Caron Butler walk, especially since he ended up signing a two-year, $16-million deal with the Clippers. I can’t see Dallas matching that. The same goes for DeShawn Stevenson: Dallas got everything they could out of the streaky shooting forward and would have moved on that summer regardless. The spirit of the title team lived in Chandler and Barea. Those are the two they had to have brought back.\n\nIn that post-trophy 2011-12 season, Dallas ended up replacing both players in-house. They used Brendan Haywood and Ian Mahinmi as a center platoon while adding Delonte West at the minimum to their guard rotation that included Jason Terry, Jason Kidd, Dominique Jones and, yes, Rodrigue Beaubois. (I’m not doing a What If scenario on Beaubois’ untapped potential, but that was the next one on my list.) With Barea back, the team wouldn’t have added West. The other key additions made were Lamar Odom, Vince Carter and Brandan Wright. I think they would have passed on Odom while still adding Carter at the mini-MLE and Wright at the minimum. They would have been pushing $90 million on the salary sheet despite a salary cap of $58 million that season, and adding Odom for almost nothing would have been too much money. With three centers, they actually might have skipped Wright, too.\n\nThat would have given you this roster that season, plus two more players signed at the minimum. (Yi Jianlian somehow played 30 games for them that season.)\n\nDallas finished 36-30 that season with the stripped-down roster, placing eighth on defense but only 22nd offensively. I blame that on the failed Odom experiment – he played more than 1,000 minutes before Dallas waived him – and Kidd’s further decline. With Barea there to smooth over Kidd’s struggles and Nowitzki still in his prime, that offense would have finished top-15, at least. Chandler’s return improves the defense, too, and let’s say Dallas finishes 42-26. That vaults them from the seventh seed in the Western Conference to the third, and changes their first-round matchup from young juggernaut Oklahoma City to the Lob City Clippers. (With the butterfly effect in play here, it could have also been the funky post-Carmelo Nuggets or even the Grit ‘n’ Grind Grizzlies.) Regardless of the opponent, Dallas probably beats them in the first round and sets up the semifinals showdown against the Thunder. It’s probably Oklahoma City who wins that series. In the first-round series they did actually play, James Harden torched Dallas off the Thunder bench while Kevin Durant averaged 27 points per game. Dallas still wouldn’t have any real answer for those two, even if they would have a punchier attack on the other end.\n\nKidd, Terry and Haywood all saw their contracts expire that summer of 2012, but Dallas would still have about $53 million committed with their title team approach with a salary cap still around $58 million. That’s not much room for flexibility, but in retrospect, the one thing we learned in the early 2010s is how easy it was to move contracts and clear space. Dallas certainly could have freed up some room by dealing Carter and Beaubois. Maybe they still sign O.J. Mayo or Darren Collison, re-sign Terry, and send off Kidd. The offense might start looking more like the one in the 2014-15 season before the Rajon Rondo trade, one that was on pace to be the greatest offense in league history. They would still be missing Monta Ellis, a vital part of that equation, but Barea would be a decent facsimile, and the offense unquestionably would have improved.\n\nThere’s no question Dallas gets out of the first round more than once if they went with this approach. I don’t think they would have made the Finals in 2012 or 2013, nor would they have beat Miami either time. But you can think hard about what might have happened in 2014: A weakened Miami team limped into the Finals and got trounced by San Antonio, the same Spurs team that nearly lost in the first round to Rick Carlisle’s eighth-seeded Mavericks. The championship ended up being wide open that year, one season before Golden State’s dynasty emerged. What if Dallas had headed into that postseason with a Nowitzki-Chandler-Marion-Barea core and some smart-fitting pieces around them? We saw what a similar team did one year later against a tougher conference. I wonder about that a lot.\n\nYou know what they say about hindsight, but if nothing else, this would have handled Nowitzki’s final few great seasons with dignity.\n\nWhat if … Deron Williams and Dwight Howard signed here?\n\nThis is why Dallas broke up the title team. There’s a very real idea that Mark Cuban had been assured they were signing in Dallas during the summer of 2012 when he went ahead with that. Deron Williams and Dwight Howard had planned this out, knowing their free agencies would align and planning to join one team together. That team was going to be Dallas. With so many contracts expiring in 2012, the Mavericks very nearly had the cap space for two max contracts – they were riding on the idea that each would take a small discount – and they still had Dirk Nowitzki. They made one mistake: They trusted Dwight Howard.\n\nHoward stunned Orlando, his own agent and basketball media when he opted into the final year of his deal with the Magic. Before that happened, headlines were being published that said things like, “Report: Execs think Dwight Howard, Deron Williams will join Mavericks.” But Howard’s decision erased his pending free agency and shifted it to the summer of 2013. Just like that, Dallas lost what would have been their most effective selling point in the coming Deron Williams negotiations: the allure of a Big Three with Dwight Howard in Dallas. They proceeded to lose a bidding war to the Nets, who were armed with more money to offer Williams thanks to the new CBA — and a last-minute trade for Gerald Wallace that won him over. It was a dumb trade, sure, but it worked.\n\nThat this didn’t happen is for the best. You can wonder how a Nowitzki-Williams-Howard trio might have played that 2012-13 season; they would have been really good that year, with Howard still near his defensive peak and the Nowitzki-Williams pick-and-roll morphing into something dangerous. I’m not convinced that team could have beaten San Antonio, Miami or even Oklahoma City, though, not without seeing what Dallas could have put around them. These super teams have historically done best in Year Two, but Williams’ decline started in earnest the next season and Howard began losing effectiveness one year later. Those contracts would have hamstrung Dallas until the 2016-17 summer, where they might have given up hope and started rebuilding in earnest. Maybe they lose for two seasons and end up drafting a Slovenian superstar in 2018. Life is funny like that, how maybe this could have happened and nothing would have changed.\n\nFor Dirk Nowitzki’s sake, though, I’m glad he never had to play with Dwight Howard.\n\nWhat if … the Mavericks drafted Giannis Antetokounmpo?\n\nDonnie Nelson wanted to draft him. He swore that he would be great. In the seasons that have followed, it appears Mark Cuban feels humbled after overruling his team president on this decision. It certainly helped make sure Dallas went and drafted Luka Doncic. Cuban, regardless what he thought of the kid, wasn’t going to undermine Nelson on international players he said would be superstars twice.\n\nBut with the 13th overall selection in the 2013 NBA Draft, Dallas traded down once, then twice, and settled on Shane Larkin, who’s currently playing in Turkey. They chose him, and his slightly lower cap hold, over Giannis Antetokounmpo, the draft’s 15th pick. Cuban desperately wanted another try at signing two superstars; the team needed as much cap space as possible to do so. If his plan succeeded, a teenaged project from Greece wasn’t going to be an ideal fit for a star-laden roster trying to win a championship anyway.\n\nLet’s travel back to 2013 and give Donnie Nelson some Jedi mind trick powers. “You will listen to my draft advice,” he murmurs quietly to Cuban while sitting next to him in the war room. Antetokounmpo joins the Mavericks.\n\nThe first question is whether he still develops into the same player, but I think it’s pretty certain he does. Antetokounmpo, still, isn’t the most skillful player in the league. He’s just the most physically dominant force we’ve seen since peak LeBron or prime Shaq, using his eternally extending arms and Ford-F-150-lookin’ frame to crinkle up defenses like torn apart wrapping paper on Christmas morning. Milwaukee did plenty to turn him into this, both with his on-court development and workout room success. But Dallas would have realized his potential and done the same. By his third year, Antetokounmpo’s 21-year-old season, it was clear he was turning into a star. Two years later, he had added the ‘super-‘ prefix to his stardom.\n\nThe 2013-14, ’14-15, and ’15-16 seasons probably happen the same way. The Mavericks maybe win a playoff series in 2016, actually, as Antetokounmpo played 35 minutes per game that season and averaged nearly 17 points. The previous season, Carlisle would have been slow to trust this youngster and his strange skillset. In 2016, however, Dallas would have probably gone into the postseason with Antetokounmpo and Nowitzki joined by Wesley Matthews, Chandler Parsons and Deron Williams around them. Zaza Pachulia might still have been the nominal starter, but it would have been in name only. (I don’t think that Antetokounmpo’s presence would have swayed DeAndre Jordan’s decision the previous summer.)\n\nYou know? I do think that Dallas pursues Hassan Whiteside in 2016 – and he actually would have signed with them thanks to Antetokounmpo. They would have still needed a center. The contract would have turned out to be a disaster, and it’s really not possible to accurately imagine what would have happened after that. Bad contracts aren’t death sentences like they used to be; Miami certainly rebounded just fine from the Whiteside one. Dallas, another great front office, would have the same opportunity while still employing Giannis Antetokounmpo. I’m certain that he would love it here. I just checked: There are at least six places within a mile of the American Airlines Center that sell smoothies.\n\nDallas would probably be a title contender. Antetokounmpo’s ascendence unfortunately would have missed Nowitzki’s final great year, that 2015-16 season, but an older Dirk would have been a great frontcourt partner for the Greek Freak in his final few seasons. Dallas wouldn’t have drafted Dennis Smith Jr. or Luka Doncic, of course. They might have somehow figured out how to trade for Kristaps Porzingis, though. That would inadvertently lead them to the current Bucks model, with Porzingis as their version of Brook Lopez amped up 500 percent.\n\nIt would be fun. It’s also fun that Dallas ended up drafting the only player in the league you could reasonably think about starting a franchise with over Antetokounmpo right now. In this specific instance, all things worked out in the end.\n\nWhat if … Dirk left?\n\nIn the late 2000s, Nowitzki started talking about how he would consider leaving for a season or two if he could never win a championship in Dallas. He said so pragmatically, never with any joy. Dallas was his home, but his competitive side fueled his tireless work ethic. That competitiveness has still never been talked about enough. Other stars in this league will share quirky anecdotes for long national profiles about how they refuse to lose at games like Connect Four or Uno. Nowitzki instead chose to channel every damn ounce of his competitiveness into basketball alone.\n\nSo, yes, I absolutely do believe that he would have considered it. If the Brandon Roy comeback had broken Dallas in that first-round series, it would have been yet another postseason gut punch to a franchise that was still reeling from 2006 and 2007. Or maybe if Oklahoma City had been a little spunkier, a little more mature and had knocked out Dallas in those Western Conference finals. What if LeBron James hadn’t struggled like he did in those Finals? Dallas did things that caused him to struggle, certainly. But LeBron is a top-two player in this league’s history, and there’s an alternate history where he figures it out.\n\nCuban absolutely would have continued chasing superstars after the 2011 season if they had lost, perhaps with even more urgency. They still would have moved on from Kidd and Terry in 2012. I don’t think Dirk would have even seriously considered leaving until the 2013-14 season ended and another extension expired. Even then, his love for Dallas probably wins out. That 2015-16 season would have made sense. He was 37, still able to put up 20 points per night, obviously willing to take a smaller role on a good team. He could have gone to Golden State and played beautiful basketball with a rising dynasty, even if he would have hated joining the reigning champions. He would have made sure they didn’t blow a 3-1 lead to the Cavaliers the following year, that’s for sure. Nowitzki would not have gone that far – would not have left home – to lose three straight and see his title hopes dashed again.\n\nI wonder if he even could have done it at the very end. I’m glad he never had to make that choice. That 2011 championship meant more to him than it will ever mean to anyone else. It meant he would never, ever leave.\n\nPhoto by Dylan Buell/Getty Images"
