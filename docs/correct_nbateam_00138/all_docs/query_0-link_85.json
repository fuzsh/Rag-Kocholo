        "text": "Pacers 100, Raptors 83\n\nGeorge Hill and Ian Mahinmi each scored 22 points, Paul George added 19 and the host Indiana Pacers beat the Toronto Raptors on Saturday to tie the first-round playoff series at 2-2.\n\nGame 5 in the best-of-seven series is Tuesday night in Toronto.\n\nJonas Valanciunas led Toronto with 16 points, and Kyle Lowry and DeMarre Carroll each had 12.\n\nIndiana scored the first seven points, took control with a 3-point spree late in the first quarter and led by as much as 25 points in the first half. Toronto, which never led or tied the score, cut it to 57-42 at halftime, but couldn’t got closer than 11 in the second half.\n\nTwo days after one of their most embarrassing home games of the season, the Pacers turned things around in a big way. They played with passion and energy, shared the ball and defended. And they were more aggressive on the glass, too. Everything coach Frank Vogel tried worked.\n\nIndiana jumped to a quick lead, extended it to 28-14 when Hill and Monta Ellis made successive 3s late in the first quarter and made it 33-17 as they limited the Raptors to no baskets during a span of 7:34.\n\nThe Pacers were just getting started, too.\n\nThey used a 14-4 run to extend the lead to 53-28 with 3:26 left in the half, forced as many turnovers in the first 20 minutes as they had in all of Game 3 and won easily on a night George was 6-of-16 from the field.\n\nToronto got as close as 69-58 late in the third and had a chance to get even closer when Rodney Stuckey was called for a clear-path foul with 36.9 seconds left.\n\nBut Bismack Biymobo missed both free throws and the Raptors threw it away on the ensuing possession.\n\nMahinmi also had 10 rebounds and five assists, both playoff career highs, to go with his career-best point total.\n\nHornets 96, Heat 80\n\nJeremy Lin scored 18 points, Kemba Walker had 17 and the host Charlotte Hornets beat the Miami Heat night to snap a 12-game playoff losing streak and earn their first postseason victory in 14 years.\n\nRookie Frank Kaminsky, who got the starting nod, scored eight of his 15 points during an 18-0 run in the third quarter that broke open a 53-all game.\n\nThe Heat lead the series 2-1, with Game 4 set for Monday night.\n\nMarvin Williams, a non-factor in the first two games, had 12 points and 14 rebounds for the Hornets.\n\nLuol Deng scored 19 points on five 3-pointers, and Dwyane Wade added 17 for Miami. Hassan Whiteside had 13 points and 18 rebounds but battled foul trouble.\n\nMiami, which shot 58 percent from the field in the first two games, was limited to 34 percent shooting.\n\nThunder 119, ?Mavericks 108\n\nRussell Westbrook had 25 points and 15 assists, and Oklahoma City beat host Dallas, taking a commanding 3-1 lead in a testy first-round series that got quite a bit testier.\n\nEnes Kanter had his second straight playoff career high with 28 points for the Thunder, who never trailed in two games in Dallas after the Mavericks evened the series with a one-point win in Oklahoma City following a 38-point loss in the opener.\n\nKevin Durant scored 19 points before he was ejected in the final minute for a flagrant foul on Dallas’ Justin Anderson. It was the last of several tense moments, and ­Dallas team security had to make sure Durant didn’t leave the court in front of the Mavericks bench.\n\nDirk Nowitzki had 27 points and eight rebounds for the Mavericks.\n\nLate Friday: ?San Antonio 96, Memphis 87\n\nKawhi Leonard scored 32 points, and the San Antonio Spurs beat the host Memphis Grizzlies night to take a 3-0 lead in their Western Conference first-round series.\n\nThe Spurs are a win away from their ninth postseason series sweep and third against ­Memphis. They finished the game on a 13-6 run in the final 3:41, and Leonard, the two-time Defensive Player of the Year, scored 13 points in the quarter as he shot 11-of-22 for the game and 6-of-9 from 3-point range.\n\nLaMarcus Aldridge added 16 points and 10 rebounds. Danny Green and Manu Ginobili each added 11 points for San Antonio.\n\nZach Randolph led Memphis with 20 points and 11 rebounds on 6-of-21 shooting.\n\nNOTEBOOK: ?Curry expected to play\n\nStephen Curry is expected to play Sunday in Game 4 of Golden State’s first-round series.\n\nCurry sprained his right ankle in the series opener and missed the last two games. Golden State won the first one without him, but Houston took Game 3 on Thursday night to cut the series deficit to 2-1.\n\nThe Warriors officially listed him as probable, but coach Steve Kerr says he expects him to play.\n\nCurry participated in a 5-on-5 scrimmage in practice Saturday and says that if he doesn’t have any setbacks he “should be good” for Sunday."
