        "text": "Unfortunately for the Mavericks, the woebegone Cleveland Cavaliers were only history when a 27-foot missile from Cavs guard Anthony Parker banged off the rim with a couple seconds remaining on Monday night at American Airlines Center.\n\nWith that, the hottest team in the NBA squeaked by the worst team, 99-96, to extend its winning streak to nine games. The Mavs (36-15) keep their half-game lead over the Los Angeles Lakers for second place in the Western Conference.\n\nThe Cavs (8-44) are saddled with a 25-game losing streak. They came to town already owners of the longest NBA losing streak in the course of a season and leave having broken an overall mark for futility set by their ancestors over two seasons in 1982.\n\nEven so, Cleveland outscored the Mavericks, 34-9, on fastbreak points.\n\nMavs guard Jason Terry, who led the team with 23 points, insisted the tough game was just what Dallas expected.\n\n“A team fighting for their life, don’t want to make history,” he said.\n\n“They’ve been in every game , scoring over a hundred points. That’s a good ballclub.”\n\nBut the balance of the team, said coach Rick Carlisle, lacked focus and came out with a lack of energy.\n\nStill, the Mavs shook off early struggles to build a 17-point lead in the second quarter. Yet the Cavs crawled back into the game to pull even two minutes into the fourth period.\n\nThe Mavs owned what appeared to be a comfortable lead of 97-87 with 2:42 to play, only to see Cleveland fight back to within 97-94 with 1:41 left in the fourth quarter.\n\nTerry’s pull-up jumper with 35.9 seconds left gave Dallas five points of breathing room. But Cleveland center J.J. Hickson, who led the Cavs with 26 points and 12 rebounds, had a put-back with 30.3 seconds to go. Then Dirk Nowitzki, hampered much of the night after injuring his right wrist in the final minute of the first quarter, lost the ball to Cavs guard Ramon Sessions with 9.9 seconds left.\n\nAfter Parker’s long-range try missed, Cavs forward Antawn Jamison came up with the rebound. But there wasn’t enough time for Cleveland to get one more shot.\n\nNowitzki was limited to 12 points playing 31 minutes, his time reduced while his wrist was being tended to for much of the second quarter.\n\nWhen the team returned from the locker room after halftime, his wrist was taped.\n\nCarlisle received energy — and production — from backup center Ian Mahinmi, who collected 11 points and eight rebounds. Mahinmi played 20 minutes as Carlisle chose him instead of Brend an Haywood not only to spell Tyson Chandler in the middle but also to play alongside Chandler in the fourth quarter when Carlisle thought Nowitzki and Shawn Marion were tired.\n\n“He was by far our best player,” Carlisle said. “He was doing the things consistently that we needed to do as a team all night. And that was just being extremely alert, being ready to react and respond, quick to the ball, willing to give up his body, take charges.”\n\nLongest losing streaks\n\nLongest losing streaks from the four major professional sports leagues:\n\n*—current"
