        "text": "Someday, Ian Mahinimi’s baritone will bellow through the Verizon Center practice facility. That voice — infused with a thick French accent and saturated with boundless joy — will welcome strangers with “Good morning!” or remind teammates to have “Fresh legs tonight!” One day, Mahinmi will feel comfortable enough to be his unfettered, loud self.\n\nBut for now, Mahinmi’s voice is subdued. He leans against a brick wall, his ailing right knee protected by a brace, and adjusts to this new routine of speaking to reporters 20 feet away from the practice court. The PR staff did things differently in Indiana, where he played last.\n\nThough his voice seems more suited for a wake, the optimist in Mahinmi searches for and then finds the silver lining to life as the new kid on the block.\n\n“It’s a process,” Mahinmi said Thursday morning after the Washington Wizards‘ shoot-around hours before the Wizards’ preseason 100-77 win over the Philadelphia 76ers. “I learned in this league — this is my fourth team — I’ve learned you have to embrace the challenge and the process. You have to be patient and roll with punches because eventually stuff is going to go well, if you do the right thing and your heart is in the right place.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Mahinmi, a native of Rouen, France, begins his ninth season in the NBA, he practices the art of patience. It will take time, he says, to fit in completely with his new team.\n\nOn the surface, Mahinmi has 64 million reasons to feel comfortable.\n\nMonumental Sports’s new platform will stream live games, just not Caps or Wizards\n\nMahinmi, 29, a career backup center who won an NBA title with the Dallas Mavericks in 2011, became Washington’s most expensive free agent signing over the summer. In a perfect storm of a player blossoming at the right time — last season with the Pacers, Mahinmi was elevated to the starting lineup and enjoyed career highs in points (9.3), rebounds (7.1) and blocks (1.1) per game — and the NBA salary cap skyrocketing, he inked the most lucrative deal of his long career months before his 30th birthday.\n\nThe four-year, $64 million contract makes Mahinmi the second-highest paid player on the roster, ahead of franchise point guard John Wall and behind only Bradley Beal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I’m a big believer that everything happens for a reason. I’ve put a lot of work in, and I feel like I’ve gotten better every year, and this is a big reward,” Mahinmi said. “I feel like I’ve been through every position. I’ve been the 10th, 11th guy. … I’ve been the backup. I’ve been the starter. I’ve played in playoff games, won a championship, and I felt like I’ve been through a lot of battles. It’s a big payday, of course, but that’s not what I’m looking at. I’m looking at finally people kind of recognizing the type of player that I am and what I can bring to the team and what [kind of] person I am.”\n\nAll those zeroes in his contract mean the Wizards expect big things from the big man, but Mahinmi earned the money only after reaching peak confidence with his game and his role with the Pacers. The confidence showed on the court because he had spent four birthdays in Indiana and become as close as brothers with several teammates. Mahinmi still considers George Hill, a former teammate now with the Utah Jazz, one of his best friends.\n\n“With the Pacers, I don’t like to bring that up too much because that’s such a different story,” Mahinmi said. “The Pacers were definitely a good chapter in my life, but a lot of stuff came into that. It’s kind of hard to put words into it. It’s kind of hard to explain. When you spend four years with guys, with the same coaches … you get very familiar and become a family. It becomes more than just teammates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“It gets to a point where you can fully play your game and [reach] your best potential because you feel comfortable and confident [after] you’ve been through so much battles and you get to a point where you know exactly what to expect,” he continued. “It was a good chapter, but here this is a new chapter. Everything has to be redone again.”\n\nNow the work begins in Washington, and it will take longer than two weeks to establish bonds within the new locker room. Mahinmi met most of his teammates for the first time at the Wizards’ media day. Then, only a few days into training camp, knee soreness held him out of practices, disrupting the on-court chemistry he wants to build.\n\nOn Thursday night, as the backup center Mahinmi finished with seven points and four rebounds in 14 minutes. Mahinmi knows adjusting back into a reserve role will take time. But someday, and he hopes it’s soon, he will feel more like himself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I’ve been trying to be a little bit more vocal, and it’s a process. It’ll get there,” Mahinmi said. “You have to earn [teammates’] confidence, their trust. It’s all over again. I feel like I’m back with my first year with the Pacers. I didn’t know [many people], but George Hill and I had to [take it] one day at time and show that you can rely on me, that I’m going to be there for them on and off the court. This is how I feel right now. It’s not the easiest thing to deal with, but I’ve done it before, so I’m going to be all right.”"
