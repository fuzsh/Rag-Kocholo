        "text": "Former San Antonio Spurs forward Ian Mahinmi touched on his journey from San Antonio to the Dallas and how playing with Dirk Nowitzki changed his career.\n\nMahinmi was selected by the Spurs in the 2005 NBA Draft and played two seasons in the silver and black. He was with the team during the height of the Spurs and Mavericks rivalry during which both teams battled for West supremacy.\n\nMahinmi would later join the Mavericks after his time with the Spurs ended and considering he came from the Mavs' chief Texas rival.\n\n\"When I went [to Dallas in 2010], I was fairly young and I didn't know what to expect. Coming from the Spurs to the Mavs, it's a big rivalry. I used to hate those guys as a Spur. I used to hate Jason Terry. I used to hate Dirk.\"\n\nThe Spurs and Mavericks games were hotly contested and nail-biters. It is understandable a young NBA player would get sucked into the rivalry but he has matured since.\n\nMahinmi looks at Nowitzki to be one of his biggest influences in the NBA.\n\n\"Dirk is definitely nothing like people could perceive of him from the outside. People don't really know him. They see this big German, kind of mean looking guy. But actually, Dirk is one of the genuinely funniest guys and teammates you will ever be around. Dirk is so funny, you have no idea. He is always joking. He is always teasing you. He is always talking s***.\"\n\nMahinmi would go on to win a championship with Dallas and share a huge moment with Nowitzki.\n\nMahinmi may have played his final game against Nowitzki when the Washington Wizards faced off against the Mavericks recently.\n\nIf it was indeed one of Nowitzki's final games, Mahinmi wants people to understand that Nowitzki was much more than just an amazing player - he was always a great person.\n\n“Sometimes I get mad talking to people because some people that only see Dirk now, they forget how great he was and how great of a game-changer he was,\" Mahinmi said. \"If you see [Kristaps] Porzingis and [Kevin Durant], all those guys are basically guards that play the power forward. The way the game has evolved now is basically because of Dirk.\"\n\nThe Spurs host the Mavericks to end the regular-season. It could also mark the final time Nowitzki faces his biggest NBA rival in his storied career."
