        "text": "Hard to believe it’s been 10 years since the Dallas Mavericks vanquished the Miami Heat’s Big 3 of LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in the 2011 NBA Finals.\n\nWith the 10-year anniversary upon us we’re taking a look at some of the key contributors of that championship team and where they are today:\n\nJJ Barea, PG\n\nNow 36, Barea re-signed with the Mavericks before the season but was waived during training camp. Spent part of this season with Movistar Estudiantes of the Spanish League, where he averaged 12.6 points and 4.7 assists. This summer he will play for Cangrejeros de Santurce in his native Puerto Rico and in that country’s Olympic qualifying effort.\n\nRodrigue Beaubois, PG\n\nHe was injured for most of 2010-11 season and not on the playoff roster. He spent all 182 career NBA games were as a Maverick; last game was in 2013 before injuries (mostly foot) derailed his NBA career. His international career has thrived, though. Last month Beaubois, 33, and fellow ex-Mav Shane Larkin, led Turkish powerhouse Anadolu Efes to the EuroLeague championship.\n\nCorey Brewer, SF\n\nHe signed with Mavs as a free agent on March 3, 2011 and played only 23 minutes during the playoff run and not at all during the Finals. His 5 points, 1 assist, 1 steal, 1 rebound in 8:21 of Game 1 against the reigning champion Lakers helped spark that key comeback win in the Western Conference semifinals. Now 35, he last played for Sacramento in 2019-20 and served as a player development coach for New Orleans this past season.\n\nCaron Butler, SF\n\nHis 15.0 scoring average was third-highest on the 2010-11 Mavericks when he tore his patella tendon on Jan. 1. His NBA career ended in 2016 with Sacramento. Now 41, he is a Miami Heat assistant coach and his biography Tuff Juice: My Journey from the Streets to the NBA is being turned into a Mark Wahlberg-produced biopic.\n\nBrian Cardinal, SF\n\nDuring the ’11 playoff run “The Custodian” played two minutes against Portland, 14 against the Lakers, zero against Oklahoma City, but 30 gritty minutes in the Finals, sealing his place in Mavericks lore. Cardinal last played in the NBA in 2012, for the Mavericks. Now 44, he and his wife, fellow former Purdue basketball standout Danielle Bird (’99 Boilermakers national title team), have a son and two daughters. Cardinal Court, Purdue’s practice gym, is named in honor of their donations. Brian works in the Purdue athletic department in external relations.\n\nTyson Chandler, C\n\nChandler, 38, played only two of his 19 NBA seasons in Dallas but will always be one of the biggest Mavericks fan-favorites. He last played in 2019-20, with Houston, but had discussions with the Knicks this season about possibly returning for New York’s playoff run.\n\nBrendan Haywood, C\n\nHaywood averaged 18 minutes off the bench in the 2010-11 regular season, backing up Chandler. During that season’s playoff run he played 113 minutes against Portland, 62 against the Lakers, 74 against OKC but only 25 in the Finals. Now 41, he last played in 2015, with Cleveland. He is an analyst for ESPN, CBS, NBA TV and SiriusXM.\n\nDominique Jones, SG\n\nA first-round pick in 2010, Jones played all 80 of his NBA games as a Maverick, 18 of which were during the championship season. He last played in the NBA in 2013, but has had a remarkable renaissance in international basketball, primarily in China, currently with the Jilin Northeast Tigers. His 37.8-point average in 2019-20 was No. 2 in the league, and his 38.2-point average this season led the league.\n\nJason Kidd, PG\n\nKidd’s playing career ended in 2013, but he’s remained in the league as head coach in Brooklyn (2013-14), Milwaukee (2014-18) and currently as a Lakers assistant. Now 48, he recently removed his name from consideration to replace Terry Stotts in Portland. Enshrined into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2018.\n\nIan Mahinmi, C\n\nMahinmi played two seasons in Dallas and his NBA career appears to have ended in 2019-20, in Washington. Now 34, he founded the Ian Mahinmi I AM Foundation in 2017 to empower and mentor children in his native France, and in his NBA stops. Last summer he drove four hours to Wylie, Texas, to join a peaceful protest in the aftermath of George Floyd’s death.\n\nShawn Marion, SF\n\nNow 43, Marion remains largely unsung as the Mavericks’ defensive stalwart of the title run. He’s also overdue for induction to the Naismith Hall. He last played in 2015, with Cleveland. He competed with fellow former-Maverick Cedric Ceballos in the Amazing Race, Season 30, and currently serves as an Inclusion Ambassador for the Mavericks while splitting time between his native Chicago and Rockwall.\n\nDirk Nowitzki, PF\n\nThe Mavericks icon turns 43 next week and is retired in Dallas, Texas.\n\nDeShawn Stevenson, SG\n\nA starter for the last 54 games of the title season, and for most of the title run, Stevenson played an off-the-bench role after JJ Barea was inserted as starter beginning in Game 4 of the Finals, yet his tenacity didn’t wane and he was a key contributor against the Heat. He last played in the NBA for Atlanta in 2013 and in recent years has been one of the top stars of the Big3 league.\n\nPeja Stojakovic, SF\n\nThe 2010-11 season was Stojakovic’s last in the NBA. He signed with the Mavericks on Jan. 24, 2011, four days after being waived by Toronto. During Dallas’ title run he played 141 minutes against Portland, 101 against the Lakers, 82 against Oklahoma City and only 26 in the Finals, but his 3-point shooting was huge in the early rounds. Stojakovic worked for the Kings from 2015 until last August, when he stepped down as general manager.\n\nJason Terry, SG\n\nTerry scored a team-high 27 points in the Game 6 title-clinching victory over Miami, thereby backing his mid-series challenge to LeBron James that he couldn’t continue to ground “The Jet.” Terry, 43, last played in the NBA in 2018, for Milwaukee. He was the Texas Legends’ assistant general manager until last season, when he took an assistant coaching position at his alma mater, Arizona.\n\nRelated:Luka Doncic, teammates reflect on memories of Mavs’ 2011 championship ahead of 10-year anniversary"
