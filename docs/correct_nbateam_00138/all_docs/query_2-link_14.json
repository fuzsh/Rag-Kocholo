        "text": "The Dallas Morning News is reporting the Mavs have finally jumped in the hunt to shore up their front line by making an offer to Brazilian power forward/center Rafael Hettsheimeir.\n\nNot a household name to most, Hettsheimeir has spent the last few years playing in Spain, most recently with CAI Zaragoza in Liga ACB, after starting his career in his native Brazil. Last season, the 6'10\" big man averaged 13.3 points and 6.4 rebounds in 30.1 minutes per game.\n\nHettsheimeir recently had knee surgery and will not play in the Olympics, but DMN reports he is expected to visit the U.S. soon to evaluate his physical condition and possibly meet with NBA teams.\n\nVarious online sources, including NBAdraftnet, indicate the prospects on Hettsheimeir were cautiously optimistic on a possible career when he entered the market in 2007-08, possessing many of the basic skills and strength for competitive European hoops but possibly needing grooming for success in the NBA.\n\nThe Mavericks are largely a mixed bag of uncertainty right now and seem to be looking at a roster rich with other PF/Cs at the current time.\n\nWith centers Brendan Haywood a strong candidate for amnesty and Ian Mahinmi being courted more aggressively by other teams, the Mavericks currently have a roster that includes Brandan Wright, Yi Jianlian and rookie Bernard James, who are all likely to play both positions, as well as Dirk Nowitzki.\n\nCurrent Brazilian players in the NBA include Leandro Barbosa, Nenê, Tiago Splitter and flop specialist Anderson Varejão."
