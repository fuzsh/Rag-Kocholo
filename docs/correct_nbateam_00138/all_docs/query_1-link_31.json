        "text": "LAS VEGAS - The Mavericks are close to signing former San Antonio Spurs center Ian Mahinmi, NBA sources said Sunday.\n\nMahinmi (6-11) played 26 games for the Spurs last season and is an unrestricted free agent. He averaged 3.9 points and 2.0 rebounds in six minutes per game last season. Several NBA sources said the 25-year-old Frenchman is ready to make a significant improvement moving forward.\n\nThe Mavericks signed center Brendan Haywood to a six-year deal last week, but Erick Dampier is on a non-guaranteed contract. Dampier is likely to be either traded or waived before the Mavericks would have to pay the $13 million for the final year of his deal.\n\nIf the Mavericks secure Mahinmi, who would at the very most require the bi-annual exception of about $1.9 million, it could be a sign that Dampier no longer is in the team's plans.\n\nMahinmi was the 28th overall pick in the 2005 draft but did not get to the Spurs organization until 2007.\n\nHe played 46 games in the NBA Development League in 2007-08 and averaged 17 points and eight rebounds. He missed virtually all of the 2008-09 season with a right ankle injury."
