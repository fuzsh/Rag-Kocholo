        "text": "With the fifth anniversary of the Mavericks' 2011 NBA championship coming Sunday, let's take a look at the key members of the championship team, what they did in the finals and what they have done lately.\n\nOwner Mark Cuban\n\nIt took him more than a decade to win a title.\n\nNow, he's as obsessed as ever to make sure he doesn't finish with just one. And when he's not thinking Mavs, the team's owner is busy commenting on the ongoing presidential campaign, appearing on Shark Tank, making personal appearances and dealing with a zillion other things. Oh, the hectic life of a billionaire.\n\nCoach Rick Carlisle\n\nPushed all the right buttons with a lineup change in Game 4 to help the Mavericks win their first NBA title.\n\nHas the respect that comes with being one of the top-five coaches in the NBA. Oh, and he also has a five-year deal with the Mavericks that he signed in November of 2015.\n\nAssistant coach Dwane Casey\n\nWas responsible for a tougher-than-meets-the-eye defense. He is the Toronto Raptors' head coach, having assumed that position in 2011-12, the year following the Mavs' title run. His Raptors teams have won the Atlantic Division the past three seasons.\n\nAssistant coach Terry Stotts\n\nEngineered an efficient pick-and-roll offense. Since leaving the Mavericks, Stotts has become an institution as Portland’s head coach. The Trail Blazers won the Northwest Division in 2014-15 and finished second last season. Twice under Stotts, the Blazers have advanced to the Western Conference semifinals.\n\nDirk Nowitzki\n\nAveraged 26 points and 9.7 rebounds and was named MVP.\n\nStill going strong after 18 seasons, Dirk is now married and a proud father. After opting out of his contract during the offseason, Nowitzki re-signed with the Mavericks for two years and $50 million. And let us not forget he averaged 18.3 points per game in his 18th season.\n\nShawn Marion\n\nAveraged 13.7 points and helped keep LeBron James under wraps.\n\nThe Matrix is living the good life in Chicago after retiring last year.\n\nTyson Chandler\n\nAveraged 9.7 points and 8.8 rebounds.\n\nPlaying for the Phoenix Suns after returning to Dallas in 2014-15. Chandler signed a four-year, $52 million deal with the Suns in July of 2015. Last season, he became the first Suns player to have consecutive 20-rebound games.\n\nJason Kidd\n\nAveraged 7.7 points, 6.3 assists.\n\nRetired as a player after 2012-13 season, now head coach of Milwaukee after having that position with the Brooklyn Nets in 2013-14. Kidd's teams made the playoffs in his first two seasons as a head coach but missed out in 2015-16.\n\nJ.J. Barea\n\nStarted the last three games, all wins.\n\nLeft in free agency, but back with the Mavericks now as a key role player. One of the most popular Mavs, Barea played in 74 games for Dallas last season, averaging 10.9 points and 4.1 assists.\n\nJason Terry\n\nAveraged 18 points off the bench.\n\nStill playing at age 38, eyeing a coaching career when he’s done. Terry has played for three NBA teams since leaving the runway in Dallas ... Boston (2012-13), Brooklyn (2013-14) and Houston (2014-16).\n\nIan Mahinmi\n\nHit a buzzer-beater in third quarter of Game 6 that stole momentum.\n\nAfter leaving Dallas, he played last four years for Indiana. On July 7, 2016, Mahinmi signed a four-year, $64 million contract with the Washington Wizards.\n\nDeShawn Stevenson\n\nPlayed sticky defense and averaged 7 points.\n\nStevenson last played in the NBA for Atlanta in 2012-2013. He and four other New Jersey Nets were traded to Atlanta for Joe Johnson. He was waived by the Hawks in August of 2013.\n\nBrian Cardinal\n\nBit player who had a huge role in the locker room.\n\n\"The Custodian\" retired after 2011-12 season and works in fundraising for his alma mater, Purdue.\n\nPeja Stojakovic\n\nPlayed sparingly, but was huge in earlier playoff series.\n\nRetired a champion and now is director of player personnel for Sacramento and GM of the Reno Bighorns, the Kings' D-League affiliate.\n\nDominque Jones\n\nWas responsible for playing LeBron James on the scout team.\n\nHis last season with the Mavericks was 2012-13 and he has been playing professionally in China the last three seasons.\n\nRoddy Beaubois\n\nWas injured throughout the playoff run.\n\nHe played in the French League from 2014-16 and on July 22, 2016 he signed a two-year deal with Laboral Kutxa Baskonia.\n\nCorey Brewer\n\nPlayed sparingly after trade from Minnesota.\n\nSince his one season in Dallas, Brewer has played for Denver, Minnesota and Houston. He flourished in uptempo styles, most recently the last two seasons with the Rockets.\n\nCaron Butler\n\nSuffered season-ending knee injury in January.\n\nHe was never the same, but has stayed in the league, playing with Sacramento last season after stints with the Clippers, Bucks, Thunder and Pistons.\n\nBrendan Haywood\n\nPlayed briefly, but had bigger role earlier in the playoffs.\n\nHas bounced around the league (Charlotte and Cleveland) but was waived by the Portland Trail Blazers in July of 2015. He retired from the NBA and is now a college basketball announcer for CBS Sports."
