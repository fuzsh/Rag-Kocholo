        "text": "The Pacers made the curious move of shipping guards Darren Collison and Dahntay Jones to Dallas, in exchange for backup center Ian Mahinmi. Per Draft Express and the Indy Star: “Indiana will acquire Ian Mahinmi (4-years, 16 million) in a sign and trade with Dallas. Darren Collison and Danhtay Jones go to Dallas. […] Mahinmi agreed to a four-year, $16-million deal with the Mavericks prior to the trade to the Pacers. The Pacers likely aren’t finished making moves. Shooting guard Gerald Green, who met with the Pacers last week, is close to agreeing to deal with them to fill the role as the scoring wing player off the bench. The Pacers are also trying to work out a sign-and-trade deal with the Charlotte Bobcats for point guard D.J. Augustin to be George Hill’s backup, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. Mahinmi, who also met with Pacers officials last week, averaged 5.8 points and 4.7 rebounds in 61 games last season for the Mavericks. He’ll play behind Roy Hibbert, who recently agreed to a four-year, $58-million deal with the Pacers. Collison will have a chance to play for former Pacers coach Rick Carlisle and be Dallas’ starting point guard next season. Collison lost his starting job to Hill late last season after injuring his groin. Collison averaged 10.4 points and 4.8 assists last season. Jones, who signed to be the Pacers’ defensive stopper in 2009, never formed an identity during this three seasons with the team.”"
