        "text": "Native Puerto Rican Alvin Morales is a longtime basketball fan, but for a while there were few fellow islanders worth following in the NBA beyond Carlos Arroyo, a point guard who’s played for several teams — including the Miami Heat.\n\nThat changed about five years ago, when a fast-moving little guard named Jose “J.J.” Barea joined the Dallas Mavericks.\n\n“The speed that he has, the commitment — you can see that he really makes an effort out there,” said Morales, a Microsoft support engineer. “He changes the pace of the game completely. … We’re not tall down there [in Puerto Rico], so the way he plays and penetrates, that’s the way we play.”\n\nThe Mavericks have reached the NBA Finals with five players on the roster who were born outside the continental U.S. That diversity has instilled pride among local residents of international ancestry, who find kinship with players like Barea, Germany’s Dirk Nowitzki, Serbia’s Peja Stojakovic and Frenchmen Roddy Beaubois and Ian Mahinmi.\n\nThe diversity might even be part of a formula for success, according to Interbasket.net, a website dedicated to international basketball. And more than 250 foreign journalists are in Dallas to cover the 2011 NBA Finals, the most widely distributed title series in league history, being broadcast to 215 countries in 46 languages.\n\nMorales, who has both a Barea jersey and a T-shirt that he wore to Game 3 of the NBA Finals on Sunday, grew up about 30 minutes away from Barea’s hometown of Mayaguez.\n\n“We don’t have a whole lot of players in the NBA, and having one or two makes us very proud,” Morales said.\n\nPuerto Ricans in the Dallas-Fort Worth area number more than 250,000, said Ray Rodriguez, an international tourism consultant active in the community. In Puerto Rico, he said, sports fans support anyone who makes good outside the island, but many especially admire what Barea has been able to accomplish despite being a 6-foot point guard among much taller players.\n\n“I am a big fan of J.J. Barea,” said Carmen Curran of McKinney, a Puerto Rican native who shares her culinary knowledge on a website called Rican Recipes. “I would like to make him a home-cooked meal.”\n\nSimilar affection surrounds Mavs forward Peja Stojakovic, a native of Belgrade, in the former Yugoslavia.\n\n“We’re obviously very pleased that we have players like Peja here,” said Ricky Simic, founder of Holy Three Hierarchs Serbian Orthodox Church in Irving. “Everybody talks about Peja whenever we talk about the sport.”\n\nBut the team’s most well-known foreign-born player is Nowitzki, a native of Würzburg, Germany, whose roots are a source of pride for thousands of area residents of German background.\n\n“People who otherwise would not be enthused by any kind of sports, because of Nowitzki, they have become a Mavericks fan,” said Tillman Hein, former president of the Dallas Goethe Center, a cultural organization.\n\nOne such person is real estate broker Traute Malhotra, who would probably pay little attention to basketball were it not for the All-Star forward. “The only reason I have anything to do with it is because of Dirk,” she said.\n\nMalhotra directs the North Texas chapter of the German American Chamber of Commerce, which once donated its annual auction proceeds to the nonprofit Dirk Nowtizki Foundation for children. But while Germans feel strongly about their native son, few wear their support on their sleeves on a regular basis, responding instead with typically understated pride.\n\n“Germans may have a passion for something, but they don’t advertise it very loudly,” said Carmen Ramirez, who edits the Goethe Center’s newsletter and is co-chairing this fall’s Pioneer Ball, a German community celebration.\n\n“One of the things I do hear them say is, ‘Oh yeah, Dirk gave up a huge part of his salary to make the team better,’” Ramirez said. “This is the thing the Germans notice — the idea that we take care of others in our community. That’s very strong in German culture.”\n\nMeanwhile, this isn’t the first time the Mavericks’ lineup has featured two Frenchmen, with Tariq Abdul-Wahad and Antoine Rigaudeau on the team’s 2002-03 roster. Back then, the French-American Chamber of Commerce of Dallas-Fort Worth honored the pair at a special reception held at a French restaurant in Dallas’ West Village area, with the French consulate general in attendance.\n\n“It was a fabulous event,” said Isabelle De Wulf, the chamber’s executive director. “We had over 100 people.”\n\nFor Mahinmi and Beaubois — a native of Guadeloupe, a French Caribbean island — the main issue might be that they aren’t Tony Parker, the San Antonio Spurs guard and Frenchman who’s been an NBA All-Star and Finals MVP.\n\n“These players are not extremely well-known,” said chamber president Scott Brown. “But [people] do like the fact that the Mavericks are a more international team. And they love Dirk Nowitzki.”\n\nGoing global may actually be a good thing, according to Interbasket.net, which studied NBA rosters for five consecutive NBA seasons, ending with 2008-09, and found this: The 10 teams with the most international diversity — the Mavericks placed eighth — won 57 percent of their games.\n\nMeanwhile, the 10 teams with the fewest numbers of foreign-born players won only 44 percent of the time.\n\nBut that might not mean much after all. Two of those teams — the Boston Celtics and, uh, the Miami Heat — won titles during those years without any global representation whatsoever.\n\nStill, national ties run deep. According to Karl Kuby Sr., who opened Kuby’s Sausage House 50 years ago, Nowitzki visited the German restaurant several times when he first came to Dallas, but eventually it became too hard for a 7-footer not to draw a crowd.\n\n“Where he goes, the people flock around, and he can’t eat,” Kuby said. “He’s a tall guy.”"
