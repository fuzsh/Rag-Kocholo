        "text": "TG-Data is mandated by the IPCC Panel to provide guidance to the Data Distribution Centre (DDC) on curation, traceability, stability, availability and transparency of data and scenarios related to the reports of the IPCC. Together with the DDC, the Task Group facilitates the availability and consistent use of climate change-related data and scenarios in support of the implementation of the IPCC’s programme of work. TG-Data replaces the Task Group on Data and Scenario Support for Impact and Climate Analysis (TGICA) mandated to facilitate the distribution and application of climate change-related data and scenarios to enable research and sharing of information across the three IPCC Working Groups. At its 47th Session on 13-16 March 2018, the IPCC adopted Decision IPCC-XLVII-9 where TGICA was renamed to Task Group on Data Support for Climate Change Assessments (TG-Data) with new Terms of Reference for TG-Data as well as Guidance for the Data Distribution Centre (DDC).\n\n1. TG-Data Meetings\n\nThe Task Group membership meets regularly to co-ordinate and manage its activities as detailed in its reports submitted to the Panel. Progress reports to the Panel on TG Data activities can be found here. Below the list of Panel presentations.\n\nSixtieth Session of the IPCC, Istanbul, Switzerland, 16 – 19 January 2023 (IPCC-LX/Doc. 11)\n\nFifty-Seventh Session of the IPCC, Geneva, Switzerland, 27 – 30 September 2022 (IPCC-LVII/INF. 7, Rev. 1)\n\nFifty-Third (bis) Session of the IPCC, Electronic Session, 22 – 26 March 2021 (IPCC-LIII(bis)/INF. 6, Rev.3)\n\nFifty-Second Session of the IPCC, Paris, France, 24 – 28 February 2020 (IPCC-LII/Doc. 8, Rev. 1)\n\nForty-Ninth Session of the IPCC, Kyoto, Japan, 8 – 12 May 2019 (IPCC-XLIX/Doc. 7, Corr.1)\n\n2. Outreach activities\n\nTG-Data’s purpose encompasses facilitating, in cooperation with DDC, the availability and use of climate change related data resulting from the activities of the IPCC in accordance with the mandate of the IPCC. This has included outreach activities and events.\n\nSixth Assessment Cycle\n\nInteractive Atlas Regional Webinars\n\nTG-Data together with Working Group I prepared outreach activities linked to the outcomes of the Working Group I report that was released in August 2021. The objectives of these activities were to:\n\nPresent the main results of the Working Group I report;\n\nEngage with the regional research practitioner community over specific regional domains;\n\nPresent the data availability with special emphasis on the Interactive Atlas (IA) providing regional information and synthesis (from the Technical Summary and the regional chapters 10-11-12-Atlas Chapters).\n\nDetails of the different outreach events are available here.\n\nIPCC TG-Data Scenario Database and Scenario Explorer Webinars\n\nThe IPCC Task Group on Data Support for Climate Change Assessments (TG-Data) together with the DDC organized an online webinar series focused on using IPCC Working Group III AR6 Scenarios Database and Scenario Explorer. The webinars are aimed at researchers and practitioners. The interactive sessions highlighted the data aspects of using the Database and the Explorer, including data availability and FAIR data principles, how to access and terms of use of data.\n\nThe objectives of these events were to:\n\nPresent the main results of the Working Group IIII contribution to the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report;\n\nEngage with the regional research practitioner community over specific regional domains;\n\nPresent the data availability with special emphasis on the AR6 Scenarios Database and Scenario Explorer providing regional information and synthesis.\n\nDetails of the different outreach events are available here.\n\nGuidance material\n\nThis section provides guidance material on best practices on treatment and accessing data relevant for climate-related research that has been used or produced in AR6 reports. For information on how to access relevant databases and tools used within the AR6 report you are referred to the following webpage. Data used in the construction of figures is described in detail in the DDC data catalogue.\n\nAdditionally, TG-Data has produced the following documents describing:\n\nFair guidance document\n\nLicensing guidance document"
