        "text": "Memory & Movement Charlotte exists because of the vision, commitment and tireless dedication of Dr. Charles Edwards and his wife Mary. From the very beginning, both have poured passion, sweat equity, immense talent and financial resources into our mission to help all families dealing with memory and movement disorders. Dr. Edwards develops and maintains deep relationships with patients and caregivers and many call him - \"Chuck\" to most - a mentor and a friend.\n\nA Charlotte native, Dr. Edwards graduated from University of Virginia and UNC School of Medicine. He completed a residency in surgery at Duke University Medical Center and had a successful first career as a cardiovascular surgeon in Charlotte. A tremor in his hand forced him to find a new specialization in 2010, after thirty years in the operating room. Inspired by his parents' dementia journey, he returned to medical school at Johns Hopkins for a fellowship in dementia care and came home to Charlotte to establish this practice, with a focus on comprehensive clinical care, emotional support and education for both patients and caregivers."
