        "text": "STOCKTON, Calif. – A big week for Pacific athletics saw #5 men's water polo defeat the number three team in the country, women's soccer remain unbeaten, women's volleyball take home the Central Cal Challenge title and more. Women's swimming & diving opens its season this week, and Golf opens its season in Colorado.\n\nMonday, Sept. 19 – Tuesday, Sept. 20 – Men's Golf at Ram Masters Invitational – For the third time in the past four seasons, the Pacific men's golf team will compete in the Ram Masters Invitational at the Fort Collins Country Club to open the season. The three-round tournament will feature three teams that competed in the 2022 Division I Regionals in Colorado State, Denver, and Colorado. Competing in a 16-team field a season ago, the Tigers earned a second-place finish, with Maverick Pavletich, Leonardo Rigamonti, and Griffin Long attaining top-20 finishes.\n\nTuesday, Sept. 20 – Men's Soccer vs. UC Davis, 7 p.m. – Back at home after four straight away games, the Tigers will look to get on a winning streak before the start of conference play. UC Davis is winless to start the season.\n\nThursday, Sept. 22 – Volleyball at Gonzaga, Charlotte Y. Martin Centre, 6 p.m. – After earning eight wins during the non-conference schedule, the Pacific volleyball team begins West Coast Conference play as the Tigers travel to Spokane, Wash., to take on Gonzaga. Alexa Edwards led the team offensively through the 12 non-conference matches of the season, accumulating 184 kills and a kill per set ratio of 3.91, ranking second and third in the conference, respectively.\n\nThe Tigers hold a 15-4 advantage over the Bulldogs since the first meeting in 1997 and have won six of the eight contests played in Spokane. The Tigers won both matches last season, defeating the Bulldogs on the road on October 2 before sweeping the Zags three weeks later at the Alex G. Spanos Center.\n\nThursday, Sept. 22 – Men's Soccer at San Jose State, 7 p.m. – After a quick respite at home, the Tigers head back on the road, taking on San Jose State. The Spartans are coming off a road win over UC Davis.\n\nFriday, Sept. 23 – Men's Water Polo vs. UC San Diego at MPSF Tournament, 6 p.m. – The Tigers come off a 5-0 weekend, including a win against #3 USC in the team's home opener. They face the Tritons in the first game of the MPSF Tournament at Stanford. The teams haven't met since 2017, when the Tigers had a dominant 21-8 win. The Tigers are 5-5 against the Tritons.\n\nSaturday, Sept. 24 – Women's Swimming & Diving host Cal State East Bay, Chris Kjeldsen Pool, 11 a.m. – The Pacific women's swimming & diving team opens its season with its home opener Saturday. The Tigers are 2-0 against the Pioneers, with the last meeting between the two teams almost precisely one year before this meet. Attendance is free of charge at the Chris Kjeldsen Pool for swim meets.\n\nSaturday, Sept. 24 – Men's Water Polo vs. TBD at MPSF Tournament, TBD – Pacific will play its second game of the MPSF Tournament at Stanford on Saturday. The team's opponent will depend on the outcomes of Friday's games.\n\nSaturday, Sept. 24 – Volleyball at Portland, Chiles Center, 7 p.m. – The Tigers continue conference play as the team faces off against Portland and wraps up its 14-match road trip to begin the season. Since the first-ever meeting between the two programs in 2007, the Tigers have a 16-3 record against the Pilots, with 14 wins coming after rejoining the conference in 2013. The Tigers defeated the Pilots twice last season and have not dropped a contest at Portland since the 2019 season.\n\nSunday, Sept. 25 – Women's Soccer hosts Santa Clara, Knoles Field, 1 p.m. – The final non-conference game for the Tigers comes against one of the top teams in the WCC, Santa Clara. The Tigers look to continue their fantastic run to start the season. Santa Clara is 3-5 to start the year and looks to rebound before conference play begins. This game serves as Alumni and Family Day."
