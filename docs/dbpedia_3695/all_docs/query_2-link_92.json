The Smith Center became the home of the Tar Heels in 1986 and has since become a cherished traditional symbol of Carolina basketball.\n\nThe Tar Heels have been in the top five in the national attendance leaders every year but one since the Smith Center hosted its first full season in 1986-87.\n\nThe first game in the Smith Center featured No. 1 Carolina defeating No. 3 Duke, 95-92, in a battle of unbeaten teams on Jan. 18, 1986. The first Tar Heel basket was scored by Carolina center Warren Martin off a pass from Kenny Smith.\n\nRECENT RENOVATIONS\n\nThe Smith Center has undergone a number of improvements to keep it on the cutting edge of basketball arenas. The building has added a new ribbon board surrounding the court for the 2012-13 season and completely renovated the locker room and behind-the-scenes team areas prior to the 2016-17 season.\n\nIn 2018, the court was named \"Roy Williams Court\" with the signature of the Hall-of-Fame coach added in two locations on the playing floor. Also prior to the 2018-19 season, four new 19' x 100' videoboards were installed in each upper corner of the arena, replacing the existing 17.8' x 23.6' video boards. In 2019 and 2022, additional accessible seating was added in multiple locations around the concourse level of the Smith Center.\n\nThe men's basketball offices were completely renovated and expanded in 2010, while the team's varsity hallway also received a facelift.\n\nThe arena's lights and sound system were replaced and the training, weight and equipment rooms were expanded and renovated for 2009-10. A hydrotherapy room was added for the 2008-09 season.\n\nIn 2006-07, the seats in the lower level and upper level ring were replaced. The playing floor was completely refinished and refurbished for the 2007-08 campaign.\n\nFour high-resolution video boards were installed for the 2005-06 season. The boards measure 17.8 feet x 23.6 feet. At the same time, two 50-foot ribbon boards were added to the fascia around the upper level and a 40-foot video board was added to the front of the scorer's table.\n\nIn 2000-01, a standing-room-only section reserved for students opened on the baseline closest to the Carolina bench. The Rams Club funded a $150,000 renovation that allowed approximately 400 students to move courtside.\n\nIn May 1980, the Department of Athletics, in conjunction with the Educational Foundation, embarked on a mission to raise millions of dollars from private donations to construct an arena. The real inspiration for the fund-raising effort came from the campaign chairman, the late Hargrove \"Skipper\" Bowles.\n\nSix years, 2,362 donors and over $34 million later, the premiere basketball arena in America became a reality. Dedicated in September 1986 as the Dean Edwards Smith Center, the 300,000-square-foot structure stands on seven and one-half acres of the University's south campus. Over 20,000 cubic yards of rock were removed to make room for the 340-foot-wide, 380-foot-long and 140-foot-high building.\n\nDIRECTIONS\n\nFROM VIRGINIA AND POINTS NORTH Take I-85 South to Durham, NC.
