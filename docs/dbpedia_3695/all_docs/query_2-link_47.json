Mitchell led CSUN on defense in all three matches, collecting a team-high 52 digs. She posted double figures in digs in all three matches, including a CSUN season-high 21 against Air Force. For the season, Mitchell is averaging 4.73 digs per set which ranks third among all Big West players after one week of play.\n\nMATADOR QUICK SETS\n\nIn addition to Mitchell, the Matadors got several impressive other individual performances during their stay in Colorado. Lauryn Anderson overcame a tough start against Drake by putting down a career-high 18 kills on a career-high 28 swings to hit .500 against Air Force. Anderson then led all CSUN hitters with 12 kills on .429 hitting in the Matadors' straight-set win over Texas A&M-Commerce. Emily Sparks, a two-year member of the CSUN beach volleyball team (2021-22), served seven aces in two matches (AFA, TAMUC) including a season-high five aces against the Falcons. With her aces average of 0.64 per set over 11 sets, Sparks currently leads the Big West ... Magdalena Juric picked up her first career kill against Air Force ... Nicole Nevarez is closing in on 800 career kills as she enters this weekend with 793 ... The Matadors rank second in the Big West in opponent hitting at .167.\n\nTOURNAMENT TIME\n\nThis weekend's Gonzaga Invitational marks the second of three tournaments on CSUN's 32-match regular-season schedule. After taking on teams from the Missouri Valley (Drake), Mountain West (Air Force) Southland (Texas A&M-Commerce) last weekend, the Matadors will take on another Mountain West team (Nevada) this weekend along with teams from the Big Sky Conference (Idaho State) and West Coast Conference (Gonzaga).\n\nNext weekend, CSUN travels to the Bay Area to take on Penn in Moraga and the USF Dons in San Francisco (Sept. 9). The Matadors return to Moraga on Sept. 10 to take on Saint Mary's for the first time since 2017. The Matadors conclude the non-conference slate with three matches at the Wildcat Classic in Tucson, Ariz. as the Matadors face UTEP and Texas A&M-Corpus Christi on Sept. 16 followed by their final non-conference match against host Arizona on Sept. 17. The 20-match Big West Conference schedule opens with a two-match road trip (Sept. 23-24) as CSUN travels to UC Irvine and UC San Diego during the conference-opening weekend.\n\nCSUN IN SEASON OPENERS\n\nCSUN slipped to 20-22 (.476) all-time in season openers after falling in straight sets to Drake last Friday. The Matadors have now dropped six straight season openers dating back to the 2015 season. CSUN's last season-opening win came over UNLV at the USD Invitational in San Diego in 2014.\n\nPRICE NAMED CSUN'S DIRECTOR OF WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL\n\nJohn Price was named Director of Women's Volleyball at CSUN in June of 2022. He will oversee both the indoor and beach volleyball programs. Price returned to the CSUN indoor program in 2021 where he served as an assistant on interim head coach Susie Terrusa's staff. Price previously as an assistant coach on Jeff Stork's women's volleyball coaching staff from 2012-2015. He also served one season as the head coach of the CSUN women's volleyball team in 1993, compiling a record of 12-17 as an NCAA Independent.\n\nPrice's CSUN resume also includes 12 seasons as the head coach of the nationally-ranked Matador men's volleyball team (1986-1997) where he amassed an overall record of 194-158 (.551) leading CSUN to a 23-10 record and a berth in the 1993 NCAA Championship match where the Matadors fell to UCLA. Price then moved on to CSU Bakersfield women's volleyball and remains the winningest coach in program history. He posted a career record of 232-169 (.579) over 14 seasons, leading the Roadrunners to a 28-4 overall record in his first season. Price was also at the helm of the CSUB program when the school made the transition from NCAA Division II to Division I status. Price's 2008 squad was the first Roadrunner team in any sport to post a winning record (18-15) in the school's Division I era.\n\nLOOKING AHEAD"
