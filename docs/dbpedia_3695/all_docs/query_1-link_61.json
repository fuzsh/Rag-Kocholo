Martin Centre\n\nLAST SEASON\n\nConsistent excellence has become the norm for CWU Head Coach Mario Andaya and his program. That excellence reached new heights in 2018. The team made their seventh-straight NCAA West Regional appearance and captured a quarterfinal win for the first time in seven seasons. The Wildcats took on Cal State Los Angeles in the quarterfinals. They would go on to outlast the Golden Eagles in five sets. Their season came to a close in the semifinals. The Wildcats took on Cal State University San Bernardino who were ranked No. 1 in the country heading into the match. The Coyotes handled the Wildcats in four sets.\n\nThe Wildcats finished the 2018 campaign with a 23-6 overall record and were 16-4 in Great Northwest Athletic Conference play.\n\nGNAC PRESEASON COACHES POLL\n\nThe Great Northwest Athletic Conference announced its Volleyball Preseason Coaches Poll on Thursday. The Wildcats were chosen to tie for the top spot with rival Western Washington, as both teams totaled 114 points.\n\nThe Wildcats earned four first place votes in the 2019 GNAC Preseason Coaches Poll. The Wildcat offense influenced votes from other coaches. In 2018, the team led the GNAC and ranked 10th in the nation with 14.43 kills per set. The Wildcat defense is stout as well. The team ranked eighth nationally with 2.53 blocks per set in 2018.\n\nAVCA PRESEASON COACHES POLL\n\nThe American Volleyball Coaches Association announced their preseason coaches poll today. The Central Washington University volleyball team landed inside the top 25.

Her efforts earned herself a All-GNAC honorable mention.\n\nEntering the 2019 season, Morgan, Swart, Aihara and Webb are anticipated to make up the core of the Wildcat team. Their performance in 2018 speaks for itself. Another Wildcat expected to make noise this season is Diana Fa'amausili. In 2016, Fa'amasuli earned GNAC Freshman of the Year honors as a member of Alaska Anchorage. After missing last season, Fa'amasuli's return is anticipated by the Wildcats. Julia Mellander, Lexi Schamadan and Madison Lee hope to add valuable contributions to the Wildcats in 2019.\n\nKEY ADDITIONS\n\nAn exciting crop of new talent join Coach Andaya and the Wildcats in 2019. The Wildcats welcome seven new student-athletes to the team this season. Several come to the team with outstanding backgrounds.\n\nOutside hitter Ashley Kaufman joins the Wildcats from Lake City High School in Hayden, Idaho. Kaufman was a four-year letterwinner who earned First Team All-League honors in each of those years. Kaufman made the State All-Tournament team from the time she was a sophomore. Kaufman capped a fabulous high school career by hearing the High School North Idaho Female Athlete of the Year in 2018.\n\nAlyssa Smith is an outside hitter form Yakima, Washington. Smith was a part of a West Valley team that won the 4A State Title. Smith was First Team All-League as a member for the Rams in 2017 and 2018.\n\nSetter Macy Wilke joins the Wildcats from Phoenix, Arizona. Wilke has big match experience, starting in three consecutive state championship games. Sunnyslope High School won the state title in 2017. In 2018, Wilke recorded 921 assists, the second most in 5A.\n\n\"It's always exciting to play, but our approach to this weekend is to see how far along we are after a week of learning,\" Coach Andaya said. \"By no means are we accelerating our process for this match but we want to compete for sure. We have some things we need to be good at early on, and this will give us a benchmark to see how we're doing.\"\n\nBULLDOGS IN 2018\n\nThe Bulldogs opened their 2018 season with a bang, sweeping the Les Schwab West Coast Conference Challenge hosted by Portland State. During that tournament, the Bulldogs took care of the Pac-12's California in five sets. The Bulldogs found success in five set matches throughout the season, as the team on five of the seven five set matches they competed in. The Bulldogs failed to make the West Coast Conference tournament, finishing the season 8-10 in conference and 20-13 overall.\n\nBULLDOG STANDOUT\n\nSarah Penner picked up her second-straight All-WCC honor as she was named All-West Coast Conference Honorable Mention after being named to the All-Freshman team a season ago. Penner led the Bulldogs in kills, attacks and points for the second-straight season, finishing with 313 kills hitting .184 for 2.93 kills per set.
