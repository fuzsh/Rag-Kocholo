        "text": "For Veterans and Service members\n\nYou may receive Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) (Formerly known as Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment) services to help with job training, education, employment accommodations, resume development, and job seeking skills coaching. Other services may be provided to assist Veterans and Service members in starting their own businesses or independent living services for those who are severely disabled and unable to work in traditional employment. To learn more about the VR&E program, review the VR&E Process page, and the tabs and links on this page. Click on the \"How to Apply\" tab to apply for VR&E services.\n\nFor Employers\n\nVeterans leave military service with a wealth of transferable skills and professional experiences. Salary subsidies, assistive technology, non-paid work experiences, and special employer incentives may be available from VA to help you hire those who have served. Explore what VA offers to make hiring or rehiring a Veteran with a service-connected disability that much easier.\n\nIf you are an employer who is interested in hiring VR&E participants, contact us at employmentsrv.vbaco@va.gov.\n\nFor Family Members\n\nIf you support a Veteran or Servicemember with a service-connected disability, who faces difficult employment challenges, there may be little left in the household budget for your higher education and career advancement. VA may offer assistance to help you assess your career goals and abilities, find your next job, further your education and skills, and identify places where you can get job training.\n\nVA may extend vocational counseling and support to family members on topics including:\n\nEducation and Career Counseling\n\nReadjustment Counseling\n\nCareer Assessments\n\nBenefits for Children with Disabilities (Chapter 18)\n\nDependent Educational Assistance (Chapter 35)\n\nChoosing a School"
