Try providers out in a non-emergency situation, so you're ready if the need arises. Also, talk with people you trust — including family, friends and neighbors — about helping out in an emergency. It's a good idea to have contact information for the person with dementia's medical team as well as a list of all current medications (with dosage and frequency taken) easily accessible at all times.\n\nTypes of respite care\n\nIn-home care services offer a range of options including:\n\nCompanion services to the individual with companionship and supervised activities\n\nPersonal care or home health aide services to provide assistance with bathing, dressing, toileting and exercising\n\nHomemaker or maid services to help with laundry, shopping and preparing meals\n\nSkilled care services to help with medication and other medical services\n\nAdult day centers offer a place where the person with Alzheimer's can be with others in a safe environment. Staff leads planned activities, such as music and art programs. Transportation and meals are often provided.\n\nLong-term care communities may offer the option for a stay overnight, for a few days or a few weeks. Overnight care allows caregivers to take an extended break or vacation while the person with dementia stays in a supervised, safe environment. The cost for these services varies and is usually not covered by insurance or Medicare.\n\nTip: Sometimes, a person with dementia may have difficulty adjusting to a new environment. Regular stays can allow the overall adjustment to become easier.\n\nLearn more: In-Home Care, Adult Day Centers, Long-term Care Communities\n\nOvercoming concerns\n\nIt's normal to be apprehensive about trying something new.
