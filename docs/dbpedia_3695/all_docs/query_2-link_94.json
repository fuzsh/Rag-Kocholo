        "text": "However, St. Martin has always had tunnel vision as far as the business model of Broadway for the past, present, and future. She is a fierce defender of the current business model, which is essentially trickle-down economics for Broadway; make sure the wealthy customers are taken care of (According to The Broadway League’s own research, the average household income of the current theatre audience is $261,000), while leaving just enough breadcrumbs for everyone else and tell them they should be grateful for said breadcrumbs.\n\nIn other words, dare we say it, she tells the non-affluent theatre-going audience, “Let them eat cake.”\n\nRead her own words and judge for yourself.\n\nIn Part 1 of the interview with Broadwaynews.com, one of the first pain points she brings up is the fact that international tourism is still down from pre-pandemic. St. Martin says:\n\n“Of course, international tourists, the loss of them is significant because they are the ones that stay longer, buy more tickets. So you have to make up for somebody that buys five tickets with five different people that buy one ticket. That’s one of the reasons why domestic tourism is really very helpful. So I feel very good about it.”\n\nAlways pay attention to things “commissioners” emphasize. Her assertion that tourists, especially international tourists, buy more tickets than local audiences is of course factually correct.\n\nBut she never centers a solution around how to get local audiences to buy more tickets (like, say, lower ticket prices or a loyalty program). Her statement above suggests it is a fact of life that domestic tourists will not buy multiple tickets, and the only solution to get ticket sales back to pre-pandemic levels is for international tourists to come back to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nIn other words, creating an environment for domestic audiences to be willing and able to see multiple shows isn’t on her agenda. They are fine with breadcrumbs. She wants the international tourists back, who are insensitive to high ticket prices.\n\nHoooo boy.\n\nNext, in part 1, she tries to claim that Broadway is more family-friendly than ever before. She says:\n\n“[Back then,] 8 percent of our audience was under 25; now 15 to 20 percent is under 25. So that clearly means we’ve done more family shows.”\n\nFirst, about 28% of the country is between the ages of 5 and 25. So it’s not exactly a crowning achievement to get to between “15% and 20% under 25. Also, I’m certain she has an exact number here between 15%-20% since she knows exactly 8% were under 25 back then. I suspect the real number is on the low end of the range. I would have loved for broadwaynews.com to push back on any or all of this, but oh well.\n\nSecond, since when is under 25 years old a good barometer for family-aged people? Are 20-year-olds children now? I hope St. Martin knows that you’re legally an adult at 18 years old.\n\nMy guess is the data she has isn’t so kind to those under 18 years old, so she cherry-picked the under 25 statistic and hopes no one thinks that it isn’t possible that hit shows like Hamilton have a unique appeal to the college-age audience.\n\nI would have loved for broadwaynews.com to follow up on this, but, once again, oh well.\n\nSt. Martin is clearly content with kids, and college-age adults, most of whom are lacking in financial means, being underrepresented in the theatre audience.\n\nSpeaking of kids, St. Martin continues in Part 1 (yep, we’re still in Part 1, she said some amazing things in this interview, what can we say) about Kids Night in Broadway, a promotion we wrote about basically being a sham of a family night promotion. Guess what? She basically admits ‘Kids Night On Broadway’ is a sham!\n\nSt. Martin says about KNOB:\n\n“Kids Night on Broadway is not really about selling tickets ’cause it’s a one-night thing, but it’s about reminding everyone with kids what shows are on Broadway that are good for kids.”\n\nRead that quote again. She admits she basically used families as a prop to promote Broadway. She admits it was never about giving away tickets to families who can’t afford tickets at the list price. And, as we wrote at the time when you run a free ticket promotion on a Tuesday night during a school week, you’re damn right you’re not giving away many tickets.\n\nTrickle-down economics might be too kind a way to describe St. Martin’s views about theatre economics.\n\nBut wait, there’s more.\n\nIn Part 2, St. Martin discusses the challenges of selling tickets to local audiences, some of whom work in the city, but who are still not yet working five days a week in the office. She says:\n\n“What I do see is that more and more businesses are beginning to require less remote work. And we know from office occupancies that we’ve lost a lot of businesses that have moved out of the city or let their leases expire and they have more remote work. But on the other hand, you have [certain investment banks] saying, “You will be back to work or you won’t have a job in the office.”\n\nShe says this in a positive light (read for yourself), as if coming back to work in an office, in a city with what is usually an awful commute, even for locals, is a desirable thing for Broadway.\n\nNow, again, as a simple matter of fact, transactionally, New York City businesses forcing their employees to work 5 days in the office is a better thing for Broadway.\n\nBut of course, working remotely for many families is a great way to help make ends meet and spend more time with their kids. Nope, according to St. Martin, speaking willingly to the media, working remotely is yet another obstacle in St. Martin’s eyes for Broadway to overcome, nothing more, nothing less. No mention of how maybe Broadway should be able to accommodate non-NYC residents and workers better.\n\nAgain, pay attention to what commissioners say and don’t say, and pay attention to the lack of empathy displayed. All of it speaks volumes."
