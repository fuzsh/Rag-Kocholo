        "text": "The first BMX freestyle park qualification rounds of the Olympic Qualifier Series Shanghai took place on Friday (17 May) in what can only be described as an explosion of energy.\n\nWith straight progression to tomorrow's final on 18 May for the top 12 finishers per gender, the athletes could not afford any major slip-ups over two runs.\n\nAn MC took his place at the top of the main ramp, hyping up the riders and crowd before each run, before the DJ took over with a variety of hip-hop tracks during the run.\n\nIt clearly did the trick for the local athletes, with the People's Republic of China sealing a 1-2-3 finish in the women's event courtesy of 2023 world silver medallist Sun Sibei, Sun Jiaqi, and Deng Yawen respectively.\n\nThings weren't so straightforward for Olympic champ Charlotte Worthington of Great Britain, however, who only just managed to qualify for the final after finishing in 11th.\n\n“My only job today was to qualify, to get through. I will be in the top 12 (final), so that’s the job done. There’s a lot of changes to be made ahead of tomorrow,\" Worthington said after.\n\n“I feel the first round (qualifying) sometimes adds more pressure because you got to get through. I’m always scrapping my first run, getting the worst one out of the way. Today’s done, I’m looking forward to tomorrow.”\n\nOn her mental health struggles after winning gold at Tokyo 2020, she said:\n\n“I feel a lot better. This time a year ago, I couldn’t go to my local skatepark, drop in and ride with my best mates because I was so anxious. My mind was running a million miles an hour and jumping into the future.\n\n“So to not be able to drop in without crying, to be able to stand on the world stage, to be able to compete alongside some tough competition is a huge win for me. Sometimes I just have to remind myself of that. Because I have such high expectations and I am capable of so much.\"\n\nTwo other Olympic medallists in the USA's Hannah Roberts, who is also the reigning world champion, and Nikita Ducarroz of Switzerland also safely progressed."
