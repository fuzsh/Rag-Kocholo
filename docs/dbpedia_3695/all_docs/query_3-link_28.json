        "text": "HENRY DUTTON\n\nHenry joined the CentriKid family in 2008, serving as a summer staffer, Production Director, Camp Pastor, and Camp Director. He served on the CentriKid HQ team from 2012-2016, and returned in 2022. During the interim, Henry served for 5 years as a Student and Family Pastor at a church in the western suburbs of Chicago, and he served his family for 2 years as a stay-at-home dad. Henry received both his undergraduate and master’s degrees from Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in North Carolina. He and his wife, Amy, have three young children.\n\nEmail henry\n\nConnor Seay\n\nHi my name is Connor Seay! I am a third grade teacher in Spartanburg, SC. I have a passion for working with students and children. I was a staffer at CentriKid for three summers where I got to travel across the country sharing the gospel! I am excited to be a part of CentriKid again serving as a camp pastor! I cannot wait to see what God has in store for this summer!\n\nJonathan and Emily Martin\n\nJonathan & Emily can’t wait to start their 7th summer with CentriKid! They are full-time singer-songwriters and worship leaders based out of Nashville, TN. They have a passion for creating music rooted in and filled with the Word as a powerful resource for personal and corporate worship, family worship, scripture memory, and everyday encouragement in the lives of believers. Over the past 10 years, they’ve released 7 albums and travel the country with their three kids (Judah, June and Milo) sharing their songs and leading worship in hopes of encouraging the body of Christ to see and love Jesus more through the gift of His Word. They are also contracted songwriters with Lifeway Kids and have written several songs for “The Gospel Project” curriculum as well as CentriKid.\n\nBrian Wood\n\nPastor Brian grew up in a small town in North Carolina. He grew up in the church but didn’t live a life devoted to Jesus. In fact, it was at a party in 2010 that God called him out of a purposeless life and into the life that Jesus truly desired for him. That same year, Brian heard God’s call into ministry. Since then, he has made it his mission to share the Good News about Jesus. Brian has degrees in Nursing, as well as Biblical Studies. He also received his Masters of Arts in Theological Studies.\n\nPastor Brian the senior pastor at Seven Cities Church. He is married to his beautiful wife, Kristen. They have 4 children: Graysen, Emma Rae, Blake, and Katie Melei. Katie Melei is still awaiting their arrival to China so she can be adopted into her forever home. Pastor Brian is one of the most outgoing and energetic people that you will ever meet. His love for Jesus and people are evident. He loves to run, golf and hunt. He is a country boy at heart but still walks around in skinny jeans (not the cowboy kind). His passion is preaching and evangelizing, and he loves to put a smile on someone’s face.\n\nHunter Smith\n\nHunter Smith is a native of Kentucky and has been a Student Pastor in churches in Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. He is a graduate of New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary and is currently serving as the Jr. High Student Pastor at Mount Zion Baptist Church in Huntsville, Alabama. Hunter’s passion is ministering to young students and aiding in the transition in between children’s and student ministry. He has served one year prior as a camp pastor for CentriKid and worked two summers of Fuge Camps. Hunter has been married to his wife, Sarah, for four years. They are the proud owners of the world’s greatest hound dog and are expecting their first son, Hank, this Spring!"
