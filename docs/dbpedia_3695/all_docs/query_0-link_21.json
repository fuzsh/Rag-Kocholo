        "meta_description": "Luger Field is a versatile outdoor sports field that is claimed to be one of the best sporting facilities on the west coast. Part of the Gonzaga University, the venue is used as a training field as well as to host competitive sporting matches. Largely used to host university soccer (football) matches, this venue comes to life when the university's team takes the field. The fairly modern field is well-equipped with grandstands, locker rooms, flood lights and a landscaped grass pitch that offers a spectacular playing and spectating experience.",
