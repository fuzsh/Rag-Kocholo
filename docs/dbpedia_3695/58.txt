From resume building to building friendships.

There are clubs and activities that become resume highlights and that those that create lifelong memories. At UNC Charlotte, we have lots of both.

Lynx Blue Line

Opening March 16, 2018, the new light rail stations at Ninth Street – beside UNC Charlotte Center City – J.W. Clay at North Tryon Street and Cameron Boulevard at Wallis Hall (near North Deck) will bring the convenience of light rail to the University doorstep.

Campus Culture

Plays, dance recitals, exhibitions, concerts and more provide a range of artistic offerings to engage and inspire.

Game Day

Never a dull moment here. Home to a multitude of professional sports including football, basketball, baseball, hockey, lacrosse and auto racing, Charlotte has a lot to cheer for.

Botanical Bliss

Nestled among campus are some of the Southeast’s top gardens and trails. The University boasts 10 acres of outdoor gardens, a flourishing greenhouse and a tropical plant courtyard.

Big City Living

It has a small town feel, but Charlotte offers a decidedly cosmopolitan core. Uptown is bustling with restaurants, nightlife, cultural arts and musical entertainment.

The Great Outdoors

With a temperate climate and range of recreational offerings, you may never want to go inside. Check out the U.S. National White Water Center, sprawling Lake Norman or explore the city’s 37 miles of greenway trails.

Athletics & Recreation

While you can take in exciting D1 action right on campus, our athletics don't begin and end with spectator sports. Get in the game! There's plenty to choose from.

Way beyond fine. Try Amazing!

When someone says the food is fine, that means it's just okay. For a higher standard in college cuisine, check out UNC Charlotte's eatery options. And be sure to pack your appetite.
