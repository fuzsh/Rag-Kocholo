The 51,240 square foot Volkar Center for Athletic Achievement was designed to help student-athletes succeed in competition, in the classroom and in the community. The $24 million facility houses student athlete support services, weight room, nutrition center, basketball practice court, Athletics Hall of Fame, offices and meeting areas. Combined with spaces in the adjacent Charlotte Y. Martin Centre and McCarthey Athletic Center, the building provides Gonzaga's student athletes with among the finest facilities and support services in the nation.

ALSC has a long history of providing architectural services for Gonzaga University's athletic facilities. Additional include the original John F. Kennedy Pavilion, Charlotte Y. Martin Centre, Rudolph Fitness Center, Patterson Baseball Complex and McCarthey Athletic Center.

"ALSC has been a vital part of Gonzaga University's planning team for 15 years and delivers another world-class facility. Having the right people in the game is key to athletic success; having ALSC involved has been the key to success with our athletic facilities."

Mike Roth, Director of Athletics (retired), Gonzaga University
