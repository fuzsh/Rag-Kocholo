        "text": "Harry L. Hughes, 90, of Bucyrus, died December 21, 2021, at Altercare of Bucyrus.\n\nHarry was born July 4, 1931, to the late Hugh T. and Reba M. (Craner) Hughes in Bucyrus. He was a 1949 Bucyrus High School graduate. Harry married the love of his life, the late Betty J. Gossman, May 26, 1951, before being drafted into the U.S. Navy during the Korean Conflict. He served over three years before returning home to work as a maintenance mechanic for Timken Co. Harry worked there until his retirement in 1993. He was a member of the American Legion Post 181.\n\nHarry was a hard worker and a family-oriented man. He always lent a helping hand when his family needed assistance with projects. He enjoyed antiquing, gardening, woodworking and vacationing to warmer states in the winter. He and Betty traveled to many different states, but Hawaii was their most visited on five separate occasions. Harry and his sons, grandsons, and great grandsons started an annual fishing trip every summer for the last twelve years.\n\nHarry is survived by his sons, Charles (Melanie) Hughes, Steve (Linda) Hughes, Rick (Erin) Hughes, and Randy Hughes; grandchildren, Melissa (Kyle) Renfro, Jennifer (Jeremy) King, Steve Hughes, Jr., Chris Hughes, Mike (Kelsey) Hughes, Matt (Brooke) Hughes, Bill (Rebecca) Hughes, Megan Hughes, Lindsay (Joe) Ormsby, Allison (Brian) Fulcher, Joel (Christine Nguyen) Warren; and 20 great-grandchildren. He was preceded in death by his wife of 56 years; son, John Hughes; brother, Rev. Robert Hughes; and sister, Marilyn Harrer.\n\nHarry’s family will receive friends Tuesday, December 28 at Wise Funeral Service from 10AM – 11AM. A graveside service will follow in Oakwood Cemetery with Pastor Mike Corwin officiating. Memorial contributions can be made payable to the American Legion Post 181 or Gifts to the Yanks Who Gave and sent to the funeral home at 129 W. Warren St., Bucyrus, Ohio 44820.
