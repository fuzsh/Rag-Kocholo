        "text": "WESTPORT’S Harry Hughes of Portwest, winner of the EY Entrepreneur Of The Year Ireland, travelled to Monaco earlier this month for the 18th EY World Entrepreneur of the Year Awards.\n\nMr. Hughes was among winners representing more than 50 countries to compete for the world title and cement their legacy by entering the EY World Entrepreneur Of The Year Hall of Fame, joining more than 700 previous finalists of the event since 2001.\n\nHarry was joined by his brothers Cathal Hughes and Eoin Hughes, also of Portwest, his wife Deirdre, and their extended family in Monaco for the celebrations.\n\nSpeaking from Monaco, Harry commented: “I was very proud to represent Westport and Ireland on the world stage, and to compete with stunning entrepreneurs from all over the world, most of whom were from places much bigger than Westport.\n\n“It was a fantastic experience to be in the company of the world’s leading entrepreneurs, and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Since becoming involved in the Irish EY Entrepreneur Of The Year programme, I have been able to tap into the alumni network, which has been extremely valuable. When my brothers and I got involved in the family business it was a very different and it will continue to evolve as we grow.”\n\nFounded in Westport in 1904, Portwest is the world’s fastest growing safety company, manufacturing and distributing safety products in 120 countries. The company has achieved 20% compound growth every single year for the past 40 years. It currently has about 3,000 staff and will reach 5,000 within 12 months. It is also targeting €1 billion turnover and over 10,000 jobs in developing countries within seven years.\n\nRubens Menin, chairman of Brazil-based MRV Engenharia e Participações S.A., was named EY World Entrepreneur Of The Year 2018 at the gala ceremony at the Salle des Etoiles in Monte Carlo."
