        "text": "We were sorry to hear of the recent passing of Harry Hughes who managed the Spurs Shop for 11 years during the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nPrior to his time at White Hart Lane, Harry was a highly accomplished centre-half who played for the likes of Chelsea, Bournemouth and Gillingham.\n\nWhile at Dean Court he captained the Cherries side that knocked Spurs out of the FA Cup in the fifth round in February, 1957. The then Third Division side also eliminated Wolves before losing to Manchester United at the quarter-final stage. United, who lost to Aston Villa in the final, won the First Division title that season with Spurs in second place, as an illustration of just how good Harryâ€™s team were that season.\n\nWe extend our condolences to his wife Joyce plus his family and friends at this sad time."
