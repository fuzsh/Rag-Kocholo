        "text": "Gillingham Football Club pays tribute to former Gills skipper Harry Hughes\n\nEveryone at Gillingham Football Club was deeply saddened to learn of the passing of former Gills centre-half and club captain Harry Hughes who passed away recently, aged 84.\n\nHarry was born in Nuneaton and played professionally for Chelsea and Bournemouth before moving to Priestfield in the summer of 1958. A rock at the heart of the Gills defence, Harry made 32 league and cup appearances in his first season, despite suffering a broken jaw against Plymouth in the FA Cup.\n\nHe remained ever-present for the club throughout the 1959/60 and 60/61 campaigns scoring 16 goals in 221 League and Cup outings for Gillingham. Many of those goals came from the penalty spot, with Harry’s infamous long run-up intimidating many an opposition keeper.\n\nHe moved on to Guildford City in 1963, who he later managed, along with Woking, and was also involved in the England Youth set up.\n\nOur thoughts are with Harry’s wife Joyce, children Mandy and Simon, his grandchildren and friends at this sad time."
