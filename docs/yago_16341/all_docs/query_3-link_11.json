        "text": "You likely knew him as Harry Hughes but quite a few people knew him as Poppa Harry.\n\nHe entered the world on July 16th 1929 in Lela, Oklahoma and lived a life full of success and adventure until he left us quietly on September 30th, 2021 after a long battle with Parkinson's disease. Through his battle Harry never lost his light for life, love for his family, his passion for hard work or hunger for success.\n\nWhen you think about Harry you don’t think quiet and reserved. He was bold, outspoken and a leader to the entire family. He was hilarious and ornery but had the biggest servant heart. He never met a man he didn’t like and he loved bigger than anyone, too...especially his beautiful bride. Harry married the love of his life, Mabel, on September 8th 1950 and together they built a beautiful life and family, recently celebrating 71 wonderful years of marriage. Their love was a fairytale, one to look up to for sure.\n\nMany people knew of Harry’s accomplishments in the oilfield and recognized him for the love he poured into our community. From the multiple housing additions to tearing down old houses and donating land, time and money to many, MANY projects...he always cared about the growth and success of Perry and it’s people.\n\nBefore they started Three Sands and broke out into the oil business, Harry ran the Perry Paint and Body Shop for 25 years, still serving the community and the people any way he could.\n\nIf there was a synonym for Harry Hughes it would be hard work, no doubt. Second in line would be ‘selfless’.\n\nSo many people have said, “Harry was a good man to me.” and “Harry did a lot for me.” friends and family, alike. If help was needed, he was there. If there was work to be done, he was there.\n\nHarry did have a carefree and adventurous side. He and Mabel traveled all over the world with family and friends and he could often be caught with a fishing pole in his hand. He did have a bad habit of starting an oil well project right before a vacation, though!\n\nMore than anything, Harry loved his family. He worked hard for each and every one of them and left behind a legacy that will never be forgotten.\n\nHarry leaves behind his beautiful bride, Mabel, and their three children; Beverly Coldiron and husband Dan, Rosanna Behara and husband Max and Harry ‘Bub’ Hughes Jr. Their five grandchildren; Trey Coldiron and wife Marty, Abbi Coldiron, Justin Jackson and wife Candace, Melissa McNabb and husband Jason, Kristen Hughes and Stephanie Hughes. Their ten great grandchildren; Dalton Coldiron, Keely Coldiron, Aspen Coldiron, Hunter Coldiron, Spencer Coldiron, Destiny Thedford, Abrianna Jackson, Wyatt Boyd, Rylee Boyd, Maelie Rodebush, Jayden Hughes and Jacob Hughes. Their two great-great grandchildren; Amariana Coldiron and Wrenley Thedford and numerous other friends and family members who will forever celebrate the full and vibrant life he led.\n\nMemorial service will be held on Wednesday, October 13, 2021 at 2:00pm at The First United Methodist Church in Perry.\n\nCondolences may be sent to the family via an online guestbook at www.dightonmarler.com."
