Fox.\n\nHarry graduated from Uniontown Senior High School in 1948 and was a member of the Fayette County Championship Baseball Team in his senior year. A carpenter by trade, at age 19, he became president of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America Local 1010 (1952) and celebrated being a 50- year Journeyman Member in 2002.

His military service was completed in 1954 as a member of Company B, 844th Engineering Battalion.\n\nEducation has always been a primary focus throughout his life. He attended Waynesburg College for 2.5 years to study accounting. He then transferred to West Virginia University for 3.5 years where he earned a B.S. Degree in Industrial Engineering in 1960. This led to obtaining his Professional Engineers License in 1966 and was registered to practice in the state of PA. In 1977, as a professional engineer, he was one of the first 5 charter members inducted into the WVU Academy of Industrial Engineers which honors outstanding and prestigious graduates. Harry was a life member of the Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers, Pittsburgh, PA chapter.\n\nAlways trying to gain knowledge, Harry has accumulated many credit hours in other areas such as real estate, securities, school administration, estate planning, and 1.5 years of criminal law at La Salle University.

This was a group (now defunct) that met monthly and shared whatever knowledge that they had acquired.
