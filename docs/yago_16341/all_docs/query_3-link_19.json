        "text": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_R._Hughes\n\nHarry Roe Hughes (born November 13, 1926), a member of the United States Democratic Party, was the 57th Governor of Maryland in the United States from 1979 to 1987.\n\nEarly life and family\n\nBorn in Easton, Maryland, Hughes attended Caroline County, Maryland, Public Schools before attending the Mercersburg Academy in Mercersburg, Pennsylvania. After school, Hughes served in the U.S. Naval Air Corps during the Second World War.\n\nAfter the War, Hughes continued his education by attending Mount Saint Mary's University and the University of Maryland, from which he graduated in 1949. At Maryland he was a member of the Alpha Psi chapter of the Theta Chi social fraternity. He received his law degree from The George Washington University Law School in 1952 and was admitted to the Maryland Bar the same year. Hughes married his wife, Patricia Donoho Hughes, on June 30, 1951. They have two daughters, Ann and Elizabeth. Patricia Hughes died on January 20, 2010, in Denton at the age of 79.\n\nPrior to his election as governor, Hughes was an attorney and one-time professional baseball player in the Eastern Shore Baseball League.[2] From 1966–1970, Hughes was the chairman of the Democratic State Central Committee.\n\nPolitical career\n\nHughes began his political career as a member of the Maryland House of Delegates from 1955–1959, representing Caroline County. He was elected a member of the Maryland Senate in 1959 for district 15, representing Caroline, Cecil, Kent, Queen Anne's and Talbot Counties. In 1971, Hughes was offered and accepted the position of Secretary of Transportation for the state. In 1978, however, Hughes resigned from his position because of a disagreement in the State Department of Transportation regarding the construction of a subway in Baltimore City.\n\nRural voters criticize his tenure in the legislature for casting a deciding vote that ended the practice of allowing for at least one state senator or delegate per county. As of 2008, no General Assembly Member has been elected from Hughes' native Caroline County for thirteen consecutive years.\n\nHughes was elected governor in 1978 after defeating Lieutenant Governor Blair Lee III in the Democratic primary election, and Republican John Glenn Beall, Jr. in the general election. Among other things, Hughes was a strong advocate for the Chesapeake Bay. He signed into law such legislation as that approving the Chesapeake Bay Agreement, which set into motion efforts to protect the Bay from pollution and excessive hunting.\n\nAlso during his administration, Maryland foreign trade with China was initiated. The Savings and Loan crisis, involving the failure of many savings and loan organizations across the United States hit Maryland near the end Hughes' tenure with the run at Old Court Savings and Loans, but nevertheless steps were taken to insure Maryland savings and loans organizations. Hughes served two terms, defeating Republican challenger Robert A. Pascal in 1982, and concluded his governorship in 1987.\n\nIn 1986 both Hughes and Michael D. Barnes unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate seat being vacated by Charles \"Mac\" Mathias. They lost to Barbara Mikulski, who went on to win the general election.\n\nPost-gubernatorial career\n\nFollowing his tenure as governor, he was a member of the Chesapeake Bay Trust from 1995–2003; a member of the Board of Regents of the University System of Maryland from 1996–2000; the chairman of the Blue Ribbon Citizens Pfiesteria Commission in 1997; the chairman of the Maryland Appellate Judicial Nominating Commission from 1999–2003; and a member of the Committee to Establish the Maryland Survivors Scholarship Fund from 2001–2002.\n\nHe published an autobiography in 2006."
