        "text": "Katharine Hepburn, born in Hartford, Connecticut in 1907, was a legendary American actress known for her fierce independence and spirited personality. She was the second of six children to a successful urologist father and a feminist campaigner mother. Her upbringing was unconventional for the time, as both her parents emphasized intellectual development and encouraged self-thinking. Hepburn's acting career spanned over six decades, during which she won four Academy Awards for Best Actress, a record till date. After graduating from Bryn Mawr College, she began her stage career before moving to Hollywood in the 1930s. Her first major film role was in A Bill of Divorcement (1932), after which she played strong-willed, sophisticated women in a series of films such as Little Women (1933) and Morning Glory (1933), the latter earning her the first of her four Oscars. Despite experiencing a downturn in her career during the mid-1940s, Hepburn achieved a remarkable comeback with a string of hit films including The African Queen (1951), Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967), The Lion in Winter (1968), and On Golden Pond (1981). Her off-screen life was as colorful as her on-screen one, with a long-term relationship with actor Spencer Tracy that lasted until his death in 1967. Katharine Hepburn passed away in 2003 at the age of 96, leaving behind a legacy of groundbreaking performances and a fearless approach to life and work.\n\nCatharine Drew Gilpin Faust (born September 18, 1947) is an American historian and was the 28th President of Harvard University, the first woman to serve in that role. Faust is the former dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study; she is Harvard's first president since 1672 without an undergraduate or graduate degree from Harvard and the first to have been raised in the South.In 2014, she was ranked by Forbes as the 33rd most powerful woman in the world. On February 11, 2018, it was officially announced that Lawrence Bacow would succeed her on July 1, 2018."
