        "text": "Antony Sher and Gregory Doran, theatre’s leading gay power couple, have been together for 28 years. Both on and off the stage they trust each other ‘beyond any description’, they tell Patricia Nicol\n\nWork doesn't come home: Anthony Sher and Gregory Doran of the Royal Shakespeare Company at the Noel Coward Theatre (Picture: Rebecca Reid)\n\nPatricia Nicol14 May 2015\n\nIt turns out that plays move home with just as much anxiety as we do. The foyer of the Noël Coward Theatre is piled high with silver trunks. Designer Stephen Brimson Lewis emerges from the royal circle looking fraught. “My furniture didn’t look that big in Stratford,” he whispers, gesturing towards a Forties tenement rising up from the stage.\n\nYet when they arrive in the chintzy sitting room of the theatre’s royal box, Antony Sher and artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Company, Gregory Doran, seem happily impervious to the hammering and drilling going on in the auditorium behind them.\n\nEverything will be in place by tonight, the official opening of the West End transfer of Arthur Miller’s Death of a Salesman, starring Sher as the embattled Willy Loman and Harriet Walter as Loman’s wife Linda.\n\nIt is, insists Sher, sheer luck that he and Doran — a couple for 28 years — have been doing so much work together recently. “Both times one of us stepped in,” he explains.\n\nSher has just published The Year of the Fat Knight: the Falstaff Diaries, his journal and sketches from last year. In the book he explains he only ended up playing Shakespeare’s roguish senior citizen in Doran’s well-received Henry IV Parts I and II (at the Barbican in December) because Ian McKellen suggested it, after rejecting the part himself. Another director, meanwhile, would have steered Sher in Miller’s great American tragedy had the late playwright’s estate allowed it.\n\nSher on Stage: Antony Sher as Willy Loman with Harriet Walter as Linda Loman in Death of a Salesman\n\nSomething the couple had long planned to do together is next year’s King Lear, to mark the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare’s death. Now, with Falstaff, Loman and Lear, Sher, who turns 66 next month, will present a compelling triptych of failing ageing men.\n\nSher was already a star, playing Shylock for the RSC, when he met Doran, then also an actor “giving my Solanio”, 10 years his junior. Did their eyes meet across the boards?\n\n“For me it was very swift and very deep,” recalls Doran dreamily. “This month, 28 years ago.”\n\nThey will also celebrate the 10th anniversary of their civil partnership this December, though, says Sher: “That was just the law catching up with us.\n\n“In the worst days of Aids there were terrible stories about gay men being ill in hospital and families not letting their partners visit them or go to the funeral. Our families are very close but it still feels the most valuable thing to have that next-of-kin status.”\n\nIt is worth pausing here to think of the progress our country — and Sher’s native South Africa — have made since he arrived here in 1968. “It’s amazing,” he says. “This journey in my short life from complete illegality where I was brought up to us being able to have a civil partnership — extraordinary.”\n\nSher was 19, a Jewish boy from Cape Town, fresh from national service in apartheid-era South Africa, when he came to London to audition for drama school. It was only a year after the Sexual Offences Act 1967 had decriminalised homosexuality for consenting over-21-year-olds. “Oh, was I breaking the law then?” he asks his partner impishly. If he was, he did so, covertly: at the time Sher closeted his homosexuality (also, that he was Jewish and South African) and married a student girlfriend. “I now look back and think what a terrible waste of time and energy to try and be what you’re not,” he says.\n\nDoran feels that “in a soft political way” it has always been important for he and Sher to be open about their relationship.\n\nLatest theatre reviews\n\nDoran took over at the RSC in January 2013. They refer to it as “The Job”, which comes with its own rather grand-sounding house in Stratford-upon-Avon. They also have a home in Islington. One of the reasons Sher resisted being cast as Falstaff was that it might lead to accusations of nepotism — although the couple have worked extensively over the years. “As an actor I trust this director beyond any description,” says Sher.\n\nThey are also delighted to be working again with Harriet Walter. The three did a famous Macbeth together back in 1999. “That instinctiveness to almost know what the other person is thinking is worth its weight in gold if you’re playing a couple,” says Sher.\n\nAre they professionally brutal with one another? “Oh, yes,” says Doran.\n\nThey do strive, however, not to bring the work home. “We learned the hard way the first time with Titus Andronicus,” says Sher. “We’d come in still talking about work, have a couple of G&Ts and suddenly the crockery started flying. Terribly brutal.” Doran ’fesses up to the plate-throwing.\n\nA further challenge to the couple’s obvious equanimity came in the mid-Nineties, when Sher sought treatment for a cocaine habit. “You pull each other through the dark times and that is what makes you so strong and the trust so implicit,” says Doran.\n\nFalstaff, Willy Loman, Lear: these are monumental parts. “People who call us luvvies should try learning one,” says Sher. “Then I’d like to stand in the wings as they go on, knowing they’ll be out there for three hours. Then let’s talk about luvvies.”\n\nStratford traditionalists objected when Doran staged Salesman on the anniversary of Shakespeare’s birthday. There are parallels to be drawn with King Lear, though. “You do see a man dementing,” says Doran.\n\nFor Sher, a further similarity is “the compassion. The main characters are failures. They’re small people. He’s a has-been. Yet Miller somehow makes every single person in that audience respond to it. It’s quite amazing to feel that happen in the theatre.”\n\nAway from the theatre, the couple relax with “safari holidays and a really enjoyable night in front of the telly. We’re not party-goers,” says Sher.\n\nDoran likes to cook. Has Sher done more of that since “The Job” started? Clearly not. “My excuse is I’m a white South African.”\n\nDeath of a Salesman is at the Noël Coward Theatre, WC2 (0844 482 5138, noelcowardtheatre.co.uk) until July 18.
