        "text": "Whenever the Royal Shakespeare Company pays a visit to Broadway, it is, by definition, a major theatrical event. Usually the R.S.C. has been represented in New York by a single production, last season with ''All's Well That Ends Well,'' ''Good'' in 1982 and the year before by the landmark two-part version of ''The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby.'' This season the R.S.C. returns with two plays, ''Much Ado About Nothing'' and ''Cyrano de Bergerac'' (now in previews, opening Oct. 14 at the Gershwin), a repertory season that is more representative of the company's founding principle. The R.S.C. is arguably the finest ensemble classical repertory theater in the world today.\n\nEnsemble acting in repertory, especially in classics, is the essence of the R.S.C., as exemplified in the current instances by Derek Jacobi shifting from the misogynistic Benedick in ''Much Ado'' to the romance-obsessed Cyrano and by Sinead Cusack doubling as the acid-tongued Beatrice and the adoring Roxanne.\n\nHowever, even as theatergoers admire the versatility of the actors, they should be aware that what is being seen on Broadway still represents only a slim sampling of the work of a company that is unmatched for its productivity and for its reserve strength.\n\nThe productivity is a matter of annual record. The R.S.C. presents more than 30 new, individual productions each season on various stages - its two theaters at the Barbican Center in London, its two theaters in Stratford-on- Avon, in transfers and extended engagements on London's West End and in its tours through England (with particular emphasis on Newcastle-upon- Tyne, which has become a third home), Europe and America. At the moment, 32 actors are appearing at the Gershwin, a fraction of the number working with the company; there are almost 200 on the active roster. At present there are 20 productions running in England, including five plays by Shakespeare at Stratford and three at the Barbican. When one considers that the average American institutional theater presents from six to eight shows a year, it is evident that the R.S.C. is a monumental producing organization. That productivity is matched by quality. For its own health - and for the health of the theater at large - the company consistently replenishes itself with new actors and directors.\n\nThough the R.S.C. has produced stars, its principle is the opposite of the star system. It operates as a family, organic and mutually responsive to one another's needs and to the needs of the company. In recent years such actors as Ian McKellen, Alan Howard, Ben Kingsley, Roger Rees, David Threlfall, Cheryl Campbell, Jane Lapotaire, Zo\"e Wanamaker, Sinead Cusack and Harriet Walter, among many others, have done some of their best work within the R.S.C. ensemble. Most recently there is the case of Antony Sher, whose promise was fulfilled playing the title role in ''Richard III'' at Stratford.\n\nMany of these actors, such as Mr. Rees and Mr. Kingsley, rose right up through the ranks. Early in their careers both of them were walk-ons trailing Mr. Howard in Trevor Nunn's 1966 production of ''The Revenger's Tragedy,'' a play that marked the turning point in Mr. Nunn's own career. It solidified his directorial reputation and led partly to his ascension as Peter Hall's successor as artistic director; Mr. Nunn brought in Terry Hands as joint artistic director in 1979.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
