        "text": "BBC Four will celebrate the life of Sir Antony Sher on Sunday with an evening of programmes dedicated to the acclaimed actor, who died in December.\n\nThe centrepiece will be an 8pm screening of our 2014 production of Henry IV Part I, in which Antony plays the loveable rogue Falstaff. Directed by Gregory Doran, RSC Artistic Director and Antonyâ€™s husband, the production originally opened Stratford-upon-Avon, followed by a UK tour, a season in London and performances in China.\n\nBefore the screening, you can see Antony Sher and Gregory Doran in conversation with Sue MacGregor at 7pm (first broadcast in 2015), in which they talk about their shared passion for Shakespeare and their remarkable collection of productions at the RSC. Then at 10.45pm there will be another chance to see 2009's Mark Lawson Talks to Antony Sher, where Sir Antony discusses growing up as a white South African, working with Gregory Doran and bringing Shakespeare to life."
