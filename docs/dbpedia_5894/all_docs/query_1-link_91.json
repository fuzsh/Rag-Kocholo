        "text": "I saw Sir Ian McKellen play Prospero live and that really stuck with me.\n\nI also loved Ralph Fiennes as Anthony in &C\n\nProbably not the greatest performance ever, but Hammed Animashaun as Bottom in the the Bridge Theatre Midsummer Night's Dream made me see the character, and the play, in a whole different way, and gave such depth and emotion and tenderness to what is generally a bit of a slapstick role.\n\nI do like Shakespeare a lot but struggle a bit with performances as I'm a quite insistent that they should follow the text with no variation which they never do.\n\nI know this is a bit weird but it's me.\n\nFavourite play is the Scottish one.\n\nOne of my favourites was the RSC production of Hamlet (quite) a few years ago that had David Tennant and Patrick Stewart. But do not ask what the tickets cost.\n\nWe saw Adrian Lester as Othello and Rory Kinnear as Iago at the National Theatre. It was absolutely spellbinding. For the last 30 mins you could have heard a pin drop in the theatre - I don't think I took a breath.\n\nAmazing performances.\n\nUnimaginableWindBird · 29/12/2023 18:27\n\nProbably not the greatest performance ever, but Hammed Animashaun as Bottom in the the Bridge Theatre Midsummer Night's Dream made me see the character, and the play, in a whole different way, and gave such depth and emotion and tenderness to what is generally a bit of a slapstick role.\n\nAgreed, he was great.\n\nAgain, not claiming this is the best ever but I was amazed by Paul Ready (the wet dad from Motherland) as Macbeth at the Sam Wanamaker a few years ago. Such a good production and a properly coherent account of Macbeth’s decline and sense of the pull of fate.\n\nIsn’t it wonderful when you see someone who completely changes your understanding of the play, or shows you a new slant?\n\nOthello with David Harewood, Clare Skinner and Simon Russell Beale in 1997. I still think about it regularly despite it being over 25 years ago.\n\nTamsin Greig as Beatrice in Much Ado. SO good that it was impossible to watch anyone else on stage.\n\nThe only one I can actually remember is seeing Kenneth Branagh as Hamlet on a school trip to Stratford.\n\nAt one time the BBC put on classical plays on Sunday evening. I remember Troilus and Cressida\n\nI saw Kenneth Branagh as Hamlet 30 odd years ago on a school trip. I fell in love with him and Shakespeare. Earlier this month I saw him again as King Lear.\n\nI still love him, though I don't watch/read Shakespeare as much as I would like.\n\n@UnimaginableWindBird agree.\n\nEdward Bennet as Macduff. I think it was Polly Findlay’s production maybe 2018/19 and it had great concepts that didn’t quite carry. But the scene where Macduff hears that his family has been murdered was incredibly powerful and the contrast between Macduff and Macbeth on one hand and Malcolm on the other in that moment was everything.\n\nI saw that Adrian Lestor/Rory Kinnear Othello at the National. It was incredible.\n\nNo one has done Romeo as well as Leonardo Di Caprio in the film for me.\n\nBen Whishall was brilliant at Brutus in a recent Julius Caesar."
