        "text": "Advocis Education Foundation Bursary\n\nThe Advocis Education Foundation has established a bursary to be awarded annually to a student entering the JD Program at Osgoode Hall Law School. The recipient of the bursary will be determined on the basis of past academic performance and financial need. The amount of the bursary will constitute the annual income from a fund of approximately $7,000 donated by the Foundation. While it is intended that this bursary be used primarily as an entrance bursary on the basis outlined above, the Foundation is also prepared to allow it to be awarded in any year as an in-course bursary if a greater need is perceived in that area. In addition, the bursary may not be awarded in any year with the intention of making two awards in a subsequent year or of adding the non-awarded income to the fund to generate higher awards in future years. The bursary may also be split among two or more recipients in any year.\n\nChristina and Diamantis Alexandris Bursary\n\nGina Alexandris ’91, founder of Osgoode’s Career Services Office, and Assistant Dean Student Services, between 2000 and 2009, created this bursary to honour her parents who immigrated from Greece to build a new life in Canada. Their journey was, at times, challenging but they were dedicated to their daughters and the education they needed to be successful. Hardworking and respectful to all, they believed strongly in paying it forward and helping others. This bursary is given to a JD student in financial need with preference given to a student who is first generation.\n\nHarry W. Arthurs Bursary Fund\n\nFriends and colleagues of Harry W. Arthurs set up this fund in recognition of his commitment to increasing the diversity of and accessibility to the Law School when he stepped down as Dean in 1977. The fund provides bursaries to first-year students in financial need.\n\nDylan Augruso ’16 Memorial Bursary\n\nThis bursary, established by Dickinson Wright LLP, honours the life and legacy of Dylan Augruso, a young, but highly talented and revered, civil litigation associate with the Toronto office. While maintaining a busy practice, Dylan always found ways to combine his passions. Throughout his career, he participated in the Osgoode Mentor Program, volunteered as duty counsel at the Toronto Small Claims Court and the Sport Dispute Resolution Centre of Canada, and was an accomplished speaker and writer who often appeared in legal publications. Still, he made time for playing (and watching) soccer, spending time with family and friends, and raising his labradoodle with his fiancée.\n\nThe funds for this endowment were matched by Osgoode Hall Law School through the No Barriers initiative that supports JD students in financial need who face visible and invisible obstacles like income; mental health; racial, cultural and gender inequalities; or physical and learning challenges.\n\nCarlo Baldassarra Award\n\nThe Carlo Baldassarra Award was created by the law firm of Goldman Spring Kichler & Sanders LLP in honour of Greenpark Homes 50th anniversary and as a tribute to Carlo, his talent, vision and dedication to his business, family and community. It will be given annually to a student in the JD program in financial need who has demonstrated achievement in the area of Real Estate Law.\n\nCarlo Baldassarra emigrated to Canada from Italy in 1958, at the age of 19. His first job in Canada was as a carpenter. Possessing a keen business sense and an understanding of the value of hard work, he was able to turn those qualities into unrivaled success in the real estate development and construction industry. A decade after arriving on Canadian shores, Carlo created Greenpark Homes, along with partners Jack Wine and Phillip Rechtsman. It would soon grow to become Canada’s largest homebuilder.\n\nJohn M. Barber Award\n\nIn memory of John M. Barber, former Osgoode Hall Law School faculty member, this award is to assist students in the JD Program who have demonstrated financial need.\n\nWilliam and Edward Barrack and John Joseph Radey Bursary\n\nWilliam and Edward Barrack and John Joseph Radey each faced personal and physical challenges with grace and courage. None of them lived to celebrate their 50th birthday. The McCarthy Tetrault Foundation has made a donation, the annual income from which will be made available in the form of a bursary to students in the JD program who are Canadian citizen/permanent residents, Ontario residents and who demonstrate financial need. Preference will be given to students who are facing personal challenges.\n\nBastedo Stewart & Smith Bursary\n\nThomas J. Bastedo (LLB 1969), Joanne Stewart (LLB 1981) and Bryan Smith (LLB 1987) are partners in a family law practice in Toronto. They established this bursary in gratitude of the education they each received at Osgoode Hall Law School and to help students who require some financial assistance to complete their degree. This bursary will be given annually to a student who is a Canadian citizen/permanent resident, Ontario resident. Recipients must demonstrate financial need and an interest in family law.\n\nMichelle and Guy Berman Bursary\n\nMichelle (Geller) and Guy Berman met in 1998 when they were both students in the LLB program and credit Osgoode as the foundation for much of their future success. They created this annual award on the occasion of their 18th wedding anniversary to assist a current JD student in financial need.\n\nSandra Birnbaum Bursary\n\nSandra Birnbaum ’77, LL.M ’99 entered Osgoode Hall Law School as a mature student after working for many years as a teacher. In 1999, she was appointed a Master of the Superior Court of Justice for Ontario. In appreciation of the opportunities her legal education provided, she wishes to assist other students with their Osgoode experience. This bursary will be given annually to a JD student who is a Canadian citizen/permanent resident/protected person, an Ontario resident and who demonstrates financial need.\n\nHoward Black ’83 ’01 (LLM) Award\n\nEstablished in 2010 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Howard Black’s call to the bar by his mother, Beverly Black. Howard began teaching at Osgoode as an Adjunct Faculty member in 1992 and quickly became one of the most popular instructors. He was recognized with the Osgoode Teaching Award for Adjunct Faculty in 2004. His professionalism, sincerity, kindness and generosity have endeared him to students, faculty and staff. The award will be given annually to a student in the JD program on the basis of academic excellence and financial need. The recipient must be a Canadian citizen, permanent resident, or protected person and a resident of Ontario.\n\nBlake, Cassels & Graydon LLP Access Bursary\n\nAs part of its continued commitment to diversity in the legal profession, the firm of Blake, Cassels & Graydon LLP has established two entrance bursaries, each in the amount of $1,500, to be awarded annually to students entering first year and who are in financial need. These bursaries are intended to assist individuals with good academic potential who are from groups which confront or who have themselves confronted identifiable social, educational and/or economic barriers to education.\n\nJeffrey Blidner Award\n\nIn his 25 years at Goodman and Carr LLP, Jeffrey Blidner (LL.B ’72) earned a reputation as an outstanding senior corporate and securities lawyer. The firm established this award to honour their friend and colleague and to celebrate his distinguished career. This award will be given to a student who is enrolled in or has completed a business law related clinical program at Osgoode Hall Law School. Recipients must demonstrate academic excellence and financial need.\n\nNorman Borins, Stephen Borins and Jennifer Borins Sutton Memorial Bursary\n\nThe Norman Borins Memorial Bursary was established in 1992 by the family, former colleagues and friends of Norman Borins, a graduate of the class of 1930 at Osgoode. Mr. Borins had a long and distinguished career at the criminal bar as both an assistant Crown Attorney and a partner at Croll and Borins, and its successor firms. Jennifer Sutton Borins, a graduate of the class of 1985, was greatly influenced by her grandfather, Norman, in choosing law as a career. Jennifer was a devoted wife and mother, a practicing lawyer and skillful legal editor and an accomplished musician. On her passing in 2003, her family and friends thought it appropriate to rename this bursary in memory of Jennifer and her grandfather. By establishing the bursary, the Borins family acknowledges the financial difficulties experienced by contemporary law students. The interest generated by the endowed fund will be used to provide assistance to Osgoode students requiring financial support. As the Ontario government provides matching funds for a portion of the endowment, some of the bursaries will be limited to Canadian citizens and permanent residents of Canada who are Ontario residents.\n\nRudolph P. Bratty Award\n\nRudolph P. Bratty graduated from Osgoode Hall Law School in 1957 and went on to a distinguished career in real estate law and land development. He has generously given his time and support to numerous charitable organizations. This award will be given to students registered in the JD program at Osgoode Hall Law School who have demonstrated academic achievement and financial need. The Ontario Student Opportunity Trust Fund has matched a portion of the endowment, therefore, to be eligible some recipients must be Canadian citizens/permanent residents and Ontario residents.\n\nAbe Bresver Award with CFPDP\n\nAbe Bresver greatly respected the study of law and took great pride when his eldest nephew, David Bresver, graduated from Osgoode Hall in 1971.\n\nEducation was highest on Abe Bresver’s list of values and priorities, having grown up on the prairies as the eldest of five children. Unfortunately, the economic hardships endured by immigrants to Canada meant that only one would eventually attend university. As the oldest boy, another unfortunate sign of the time, he was able to do so. He knew from personal experience how it felt to be the “other” and to be considered lesser than his classmates. Abe Bresver was able to face these obstacles as a member of a minority group and surmount them to become a respected Chartered Accountant and successful businessman.\n\nOn Abe Bresver’s death in 2007, pursuant to a bequest in his will, the Feiga Bresver Academic Fund was created to honour his late mother. Its mandate is to support those seeking post-secondary education and the possibility of participating in scientific research who might not have the economic means to do so.\n\nCombining his regard for the law and his sensitivity to challenges faced by students to fulfill their dreams, supporting an endowment fund at Osgoode Hall Law School that gives preference to students with physical disabilities in partnership with “A Seat at the Table” and the Canadian Foundation for Physically Disabled Persons (CFPDP) is a most appropriate continuation of Abe Bresver’s vision.\n\nThe funds for this endowment were matched by Osgoode Hall Law School through the No Barriers Initiative and will support JD students in financial need who face visible and invisible obstacles like income; mental health, racial, cultural and gender inequalities; or physical and learning challenges. Preference will be given to students with physical disabilities.\n\nOnie Brown Memorial Bursary\n\nMrs. C.M. Muskat, B.A., Barrister of Toronto, has established a bursary in memory of the late Onie Brown, Q.C., Barrister, of Osgoode Hall, 1928-55.

This bursary will be given annually to an Osgoode student who is a Canadian citizen/permanent resident, a resident of Ontario, and who demonstrates financial need. Preference will be given to a sole support parent.\n\nArchie Campbell Memorial Bursary\n\nEstablished by the classmates and friends of Justice Archie Campbell ’67, who was an active member of the Law School, most notably as a columnist for the Obiter Dicta. A beloved teacher and highly respected jurist who embodied the best characteristics of the bench: a deep knowledge and respect of the law, and the wisdom to apply it fairly. Archie lived life to the fullest and made sure those around him enjoyed it too. He will be sadly missed by all who knew him.\n\nThis bursary will be given annually to a JD student who is a Canadian citizen, permanent resident or protected person and a resident of Ontario who demonstrates financial need.\n\nCraig Carter ’86 (LLM) Memorial Award\n\nFasken Martineau DuMoulin LLP created this award as a tribute to their long-time partner, colleague and friend, Craig Carter.

In 2015, he was recognized for this outstanding career with the Law Society Medal and the Ontario Bar Association’s Distinguished Service Award in 2017.\n\nThis award will be given annually to a student in the JD program who demonstrates financial need. Preference will be given to a student with an interest in real estate law.\n\nThe Honourable Madam Justice Moira Lenore Caswell Award\n\nThe family, friends and colleagues of the Honourable Madam Justice Moira Caswell have established this award to honour her distinguished career as a lawyer and a judge. As one of the 14 women in her class, Madam Justice Caswell graduated from Osgoode with an LLB in 1960 and was called to the Bar in 1962. She practiced commercial and real estate law for 20 years and was appointed as one of Her Majesty’s Council in 1978. From 1968 to 1981 she was an instructor for the Law Society of Upper Canada.
