        "text": "Veteran actor Sir Antony Sher has died of cancer aged 72, the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) has announced.\n\nHe was widely regarded as one of the country's finest contemporary classical actors, with a long association with the company.\n\nIts artistic director and Sir Antony's husband, Gregory Doran, had taken compassionate leave to care for him.\n\nThe company said it was \"deeply saddened\" by the news.\n\nRSC chair Shriti Vadera said the actor was \"beloved\" in the organisation \"and touched and enriched the lives of so many people\".\n\n\"Our thoughts and sincere condolences are with Greg, and with Antony's family and their friends at this devastating time,\" added Catherine Mallyon, RSC executive director and Erica Whyman, acting artistic director.\n\nSir Antony's film appearances included Shakespeare in Love and Mrs Brown, while his RSC credits included Richard III and Macbeth. He also appeared in TV series including The History Man and the BBC's Murphy's Law.\n\nOnce described by the Prince of Wales as his favourite actor, Sir Antony played many of the great Shakespearean roles, from King Lear to Shylock.\n\nBut it was his portrayal of Richard III as a villainous hunchback on crutches which won him an Olivier Award in 1985.\n\nAllow Instagram content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Instagram .

The mark of a true artist\".\n\nSinger Gary Kemp, of Spandau Ballet, said some of his \"most powerful theatre-viewing experiences\" had occurred while watching Sir Antony.\n\nSouth African-raised Sir Antony joined the RSC in 1982.\n\nIn his early teens he had elocution classes, which helped him to overcome the shyness he had felt as a boy.\n\nBut he almost gave up on his acting career after an early rejection from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada) in London.\n\n\"That was my beginning in this country and I took the rejections very seriously,\" he told The Telegraph in 2018,\n\n\"I assumed the examiners knew best, but my mother, who was a very ambitious Jewish woman, was absolutely determined that they were wrong and kept me going. I honestly think I would have given up if it weren't for her.\"\n\n'Never went to university'\n\nSir Antony became an honorary associate artist with the RSC, based in Stratford-upon-Avon in Warwickshire.\n\nIn 2010, he told the BBC about his first visit there and described it as one of the most significant experiences of his life.\n\nFive years later, he took issue with Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes' opinion that one needed a university education to properly understand Shakespeare.\n\n\"I am sorry, that is nonsense,\" said Sir Antony in an interview with the BBC's Sue MacGregor.\n\n\"I never went to university but my job as a Shakespeare actor - and I have done a lot of them now - is to work hard on conveying the meaning.\"\n\nHe added: \"It's not a university degree you need, it's the craft of speaking Shakespeare, which we at the RSC work very hard at.\"\n\nSir Antony was knighted in 2000, and in 2005, with Mr Doran, who he met at the RSC, became one of the first gay couples to enter into a civil partnership in the UK.\n\nFellow actor and playwright John Kani said in a tribute: \"Both Tony Sher and I were born when our country, South Africa, was the worst place a child could be born let alone to be raised by parents who worked very hard to prepare their children for a difficult future - Apartheid South Africa. By the grace of his God and my ancestors, like Romeo and Juliet we found each other in 1973.\n\n\"We travelled together as compatriots, comrades in the struggle for a better South Africa, as fellow artists... I am at peace with you my friend and myself. Exit my King. Your Brother.\""
