        "text": "LONDON (AP) â Antony Sher, one of the most acclaimed Shakespearean actors of his generation, has died aged 72, the Royal Shakespeare Company said Friday.\n\nSher had been diagnosed with terminal cancer earlier this year. His husband, Royal Shakespeare Company Artistic Director Gregory Doran, took leave from his job to care for him.\n\nBorn in Cape Town, South Africa in 1949, Sher moved to Britain in the late 1960s to study drama. He joined the RSC in 1982 and had a breakthrough role in 1984 as the usurping king in âRichard III.â\n\nHe went on to play most of Shakespeareâs meaty male roles, including Falstaff in the âHenry IVâ plays, Leontes in âThe Winterâs Tale,â Shylock in âThe Merchant of Venice,â Iago in âOthelloâ and the title characters in âMacbethâ and âKing Lear.â\n\nNon-Shakespearean roles for the company, based in the Bardâs hometown of Stratford-upon-Avon, included Willy Loman in Arthur Miller's âDeath of a Salesmanâ and the title role in Moliere's âTartuffe.â\n\nSher also performed with Liverpoolâs innovative Everyman Theatre and at many of Londonâs main theaters, getting his first West End starring role as a drag artist in Harvey Fiersteinâs âTorch Song Trilogy.â He won the 1985 best-actor Olivier Award jointly for âTorch Song Trilogyâ and âRichard III.â\n\nHe gained a second Olivier, as well as a Tony Award nomination for playing artist Stanley Spencer in Pam Gemsâ âStanleyâ at the National Theatre and on Broadway.\n\nAfter winning acclaim as a pillar of British theater, Sher began to explore both his Jewish and his South African heritage.\n\nHe adapted Primo Leviâs powerful Auschwitz memoir âIf This is a Manâ into a one-man stage show, âPrimo,â that ran on Broadway in 2005.\n\nHe created the solo show despite being afflicted with debilitating stage fright.\n\nâIf you suffer from stage fright, is it a good idea to perform a one-man show? The answer, surprisingly, turns out to be yes,â Sher told the Associated Press in 2005. âIt is the best cure for stage fright in the world, because itâs make or break. Thereâs no middle ground.â\n\nSher's last role for the RSC came in 2019 in South African writer John Kaniâs âKunene and The King.â Sher played a veteran actor diagnosed with cancer, looked after by a Black South African carer.\n\nKani, who starred opposite Sher, said the two men had been âcomrades in the struggle for a better South Africa.â\n\nOn television, Sher starred as a memorably sleazy university lecturer in 1981 BBC series âThe History Man.â His film roles included Dr. Moth in âShakespeare in Love,â Benjamin Disraeli in âMrs Brownâ and Adolf Hitler in âChurchill: The Hollywood Years.â\n\nSher also wrote several novels and theatrical memoirs, along with an autobiography, âBeside Myself,â and exhibited his paintings and drawings in galleries. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2000, becoming Sir Antony Sher.\n\nâI think he always felt like an outsider and his outsiderâs vision was his strength,â said Harriet Walter, who starred opposite Sher in âMacbethâ and âDeath of a Salesman.â\n\nâHe had abundant creative energy and protean powers and an almost clinical curiosity about what makes people tick,â she said.\n\nShakespeare scholar James Shapiro said Sherâs performances âprofoundly deepened my understanding of Shakespeare.â\n\nâHe was a brilliant actor and an incredibly kind and thoughtful person,â Shapiro said. âHamlet put it best: âtake him for all in all, I shall not look upon his like again.ââ\n\nSher and Doran were one of the first couples to have a civil partnership in Britain after same-sex unions were legalized in 2005. They married in 2015 when the U.K. legalized gay marriage.\n\nCopyright 2021 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
