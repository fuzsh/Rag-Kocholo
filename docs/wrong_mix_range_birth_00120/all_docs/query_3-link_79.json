        "text": "NEW YORK – February 22, 2024 –The Songwriters Hall of Fame announced today that Diane Warren will be the 2024 recipient of the esteemed Johnny Mercer Award at the Songwriters Hall of Fame Induction and Awards Gala slated for Thursday, June 13, 2024, at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in New York City.\n\nThe Johnny Mercer Award, the highest honor bestowed by the Songwriters Hall of Fame, is exclusively reserved for a songwriter or songwriting team who has already been inducted in a prior year and whose body of work is of such high quality and impact that it upholds the gold standard set by the legendary Johnny Mercer. Diane Warren was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2001.\n\nSHOF Chairman Nile Rodgers said, “The songwriting community is filled with many special people who have delivered incomparable songs that have made the world go round. Within that special group of people, Diane Warren is unique; she is a force of nature that, despite her enormous success from “Rhythm Of The Night” to “I Don’t Want To Miss A Thing” and at least 100 (15!) Academy Award nominations, she shows up to write songs every morning at 8 am! I am delighted to see her receive the esteemed Johnny Mercer Award from the Songwriters Hall of Fame, which is the gold bar standard. Diane is that and more!”\n\nDiane Warren said, “I'm beyond honored to receive the Johnny Mercer Award, especially looking at the names of the other songwriters who have gotten this great honor. When I was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, my mom was there and finally understood that I could make a living and life being what I was born to be and wake up every day loving to be… a songwriter. Now, both she and my dad will be looking down on me with big smiles on their faces. Thank you, Songwriters Hall of Fame.\"\n\nOne of modern music's most celebrated songwriters, Diane Warren, has penned nine #1 and thirty-three top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 and is tied for having written the most #1 songs as a sole writer in Billboard history. Her distinguished catalogue features beloved songs including “Only Love Can Hurt Like This,” “Un-Break My Heart,” and “If I Could Turn Back Time.”\n\nShe has received 15 Academy Award nominations, is a GRAMMY winner with 15 nominations, an EMMY winner, and a two-time Golden Globe winner whose songs have been featured in more than 150 films, including chart-topping hits “Nothing’s Gonna Stop Us Now” (Mannequin, 1987) “Because You Loved Me” (Up Close and Personal, 1996) “How Do I Live” ( Con Air, 1997) “I Don’t Want To Miss A Thing” (Armageddon, 1998 ) and “Til It Happens To You” (The Hunting Ground, 2015). In November 2022, Warren became the first songwriter in history to receive an Honorary Oscar, as voted on by the Academy's Board of Governors. Most recently, she wrote the original song \"The Fire Inside,\" performed by Becky G for the film Flamin' Hot, directed by Eva Longoria, which marked her 15th Oscar nomination.\n\nThe sole owner of Realsongs, her publishing company and the most successful female-owned and operated business in the music industry, Diane Warren is a recipient of a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, a nod to her legendary career, having worked with many of today's most popular artists, including Beyonce, Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift, H.E.R., Snoop Dogg, Paloma Faith, Jon Batiste, Maren Morris, and Justin Bieber, in addition to having written songs for the world's most iconic artist such as Whitney Houston, Cher, Celine Dion, Mariah Carey, Reba McEntire, and many more.\n\nInductees at this year’s event include Hillary Lindsey, Timothy Mosley p/k/a Timbaland, Dean Pitchford, Bill Berry, Peter Buck, Mike Mills, Michael Stipe p/k/a R.E.M., and Donald Fagen and Walter Becker p/k/a Steely Dan.\n\nAbout The Songwriters Hall of Fame:\n\nThe Songwriters Hall of Fame celebrates songwriters, educates the public with regard to their achievements, and produces a spectrum of professional programs devoted to the development of new songwriting talent through workshops, showcases, scholarships and Master Sessions at NYU Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development, University of North Carolina and at Stuyvesant High School.
