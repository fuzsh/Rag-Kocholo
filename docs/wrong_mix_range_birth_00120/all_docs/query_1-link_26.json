        "text": "SAVANNAH, Ga. (WTOC) - Savannah’s City Council officially decided on the future of the Civic Center Thursday afternoon.\n\nCouncil members voted 7 to 1 in favor of the option to demolish the Martin Luther King Jr. Junior Arena and renovate the Johnny Mercer Theatre, ballroom and community meeting spaces at the facility.\n\nSavannah Mayor Van Johnson said, “this is going to be a major, major undertaking.”\n\nAccording to city staff, the plan comes with an estimated net cost of $90 to $120 million and would restore seven squares of the Oglethorpe plan.\n\nNot all council members applauded the move.\n\n1st district Alderwoman Bernetta Lanier was the lone “no” vote citing worries about where events held at the current MLK Jr. arena will now take place.\n\n“There’s no plan for that use to come back somewhere else. We didn’t deal with that issue of those many people who were concerned about the MLK and that needed community space. We left that dangling out there,” said Alderwoman Lanier.\n\nCity manager Jay Melder said, “there is space to build a purpose-built building that could service those needs.”\n\nMembers of Savannah’s art community called Thursday’s vote a win, saying the Johnny Mercer theater desperately needs renovations.\n\n“It’s really monumental for the performing arts,” said Savannah Philharmonic Executive Director Amy Williams. “It feels kind of cavernous and you can’t necessarily hear well and, really all of that is fixable.”\n\nTalks about what to do with the Civic Center have been ongoing for years but have recently intensified following the Enmarket Arena’s opening.\n\n“I wanted to make sure that we understood what our decision meant, and what it meant to the entire community,” said District 2 Alderman Detric Leggett.\n\nNew plans for the 52-year-old facility that leaders say will have lasting impacts across the city for many more decades to come.\n\nMayor Van Johnson says Thursday was merely a starting point with several more decisions about what will go here needing to be made.\n\nAmong the things council will prioritize for the parcel, according to this resolution, are housing, keeping the name of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr and prohibiting the development of new hotels on this parcel."
