I have a few old pictures of the LemEEs and some unidentified people from Pilleys Island I believe. They are probably vintage 1890. My greatgrandmother was a Jane(or Jean) Louise MacKenzie (nee Giane Louise LeMee) and was born Nov. 11, 1866 in Fleur de Lyse NF. She was the daughter of Jean Marie LeMee and Ann Walsh. She married Hector MacKenzie Sept. 30, 1882 in MINGS. Hector MacKenzie died in a mine accident at Pilleys Island on August 21, 1896.The mine was closed not long after. Jane (or Jean) subsequently married a Tom Downey and had two children Mick and Dan. Both sons were apparently placed in a mental institution in St.. John's. They would have probably been born 1898-1905. Jane had a brother Frank who worked in St.. John's and was a superintendent of the locomotive shop of Newfoundland railways. (b apparently Oct.. 10, 1870) /He was alive in 1920s as my Uncle recalls visiting him. Jean died in St.. John's and was waked by my grandfather at 33 Barnes Road or in his Military Trail home bounding on Barnes Rd. She apparently died between 1926 and 1935 as best I can determine. She was also in a mental institution. And could have been buried as a MacKenzie or Downey. My gggrandfather was Jean Marie LeMee who was a French fisherman. He apparently jumped ship in about 1850 in North Central Newfoundland. According to his gravestone he was born 1833 in Benoc (or Benic) France. He died in April 21, 1914 in Coachman's Cove , Newfoundland (I have a photo of him , his wife and their grave stone).\n\nExtent of research: Limited\n\n[August/98][November/2002]\n\nMACKEY (JOSEPH)\n\nResearcher: Peggy Schmitt - PEGGY-SCHMITT@WANADOO.FR\n\nAddress:14 RUE DE L'EGLISE 51150 AIGNY FRANCE\n\nPhone: 06.71.99.95.52\n\nDescription: Found a bracelet: (* is for what I can't read) \"Joseph * Mackey Newfoundland Ne* *****\" Must have been lost during world war 1 (Blue puttees?)

They lived in St. Johns, Newfoundland where they gave birth to their son Robert Jr (who I am calling Robert III) around 1859. Robert Sr (Robert II) may have been a baker at 44 Duckworth St in St. Johns in 1864 (or there is a slight possibility he may have died in Quebec in 1863, there is some confusion due to similar names). If he is not the one who died in Quebec, then he was born 1821 May 15 in St. John's to parents Robert (I) Arroll and Ann (surname unknown).
