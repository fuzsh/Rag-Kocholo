        "text": "Born in Kent and raised with his seven siblings by two working parents, Johnny learned early on in his life the vital qualities of teamwork, dedication and perseverance. He achieved ‘average’ results at school, where he spent more time on the sports field than in the classroom. Being part of a large working family and contributing to the family home meant that employment and not university beckoned, and Johnny worked as an intern in the financial sector of the City of London. From a military family, and with three brothers in the Royal Navy, Johnny could only resist the allure of the military for so long. He elected for the Army over the Royal Navy and subsequently graduated from Sandhurst in 2002. He served from the tactical to the strategic level throughout a career across the globe, including multiple combat operations.\n\nJohnny lives with his wife Felicity who he met at school, and his two young children. It was a simple desire to improve the community in which his children are growing up in that initially attracted him into politics. He resents inequality and prejudice, and resolved that the best way to change it was to put himself forward. In October 2013 Johnny was selected by the Conservative Party to fight his local marginal seat of Plymouth Moor View, and won the seat in the 2015 General Election.\n\nJohnny serves on both the House of Commons Defence and Health Select Committees. He was reelected in 2017 after only two years in the job with an almost five-fold increase in his majority.\n\nJohnny speaks regularly in the House of Commons with a focus on defence, veterans, mental health and transport issues. His book, We Were Warriors, was published in 2017."
