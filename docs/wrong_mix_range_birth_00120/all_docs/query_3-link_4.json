John Herndon Mercer was born on November 18, 1909, in Savannah, Georgia. At a young age, Johnny became fascinated with the lyrical storytelling of the songs sung by local Gullah-Geechee fishermen and the vaudeville performers of the day. Around 1924, Mercer wrote his first song, “Sister Susie, Strut Your Stuff.” Already a well-known Jazz enthusiast by the time he moved to New York City in 1928, he continued to work a day job while writing songs at night. His first big break came in 1933 when he composed the lyrics for “Lazybones” with music by Hoagy Carmichael. He then moved to Los Angeles and began a career writing hit songs for Hollywood productions. Mercer won four Oscars during his lifetime, including his third Best Song Academy Award in 1961 for “Moon River,” for which he also won his first Grammy. Mercer wrote it with Henry Mancini for the film “Breakfast At Tiffany’s” and inspired by the waterways around his native Savannah. Mercer has been honored by the United States Postal Service with a postage stamp created in his likeness, and, locally, with the dedication of the Johnny Mercer Theatre at the Savannah Civic Center and a bronze statue in Ellis Square in 2009. Mercer passed away in 1976 and is buried in Savannah’s Bonaventure Cemetery.\n\nPortrait of Johnny Mercer, New York, N.Y., between 1946-1948, photograph by William P.
