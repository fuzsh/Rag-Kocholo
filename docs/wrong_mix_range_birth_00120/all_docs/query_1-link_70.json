        "text": "Plymouth MP Johnny Mercer has explained why he didn’t attend the Plymouth City Council local election count on Thursday night – and said reports of his political demise has been exaggerated.\n\nThe Conservative MP for Moor View was not present at the Life Centre on Thursday night, with his absence being noted by Labour politicians. But Mr Mercer explained that he was not at the count because one of his children was ill.\n\nLabour won 15 of the 19 seats available in the local election, with nine of those new victories. It means the party now has 42 seats after gaining councillors in St Budeaux , Budshead, Plymstock Dunstone, Plymstock Radford, Ham, Honicknowle, Compton, Peverell and Southway .\n\nRead More\n\nPlymouth Labour hails 'fantastic' result and now calls for general election\n\nDefence spending will be transformative for Devonport Dockyard\n\nA jubilant Labour leader Tudor Evans said the result was a disaster for the Conservatives , who won just one seat, and said the result showed a public appetite for a general election - and a Labour government. Luke Pollard, Labour MP for Sutton and Devonport, hailed a “brilliant set of results”. He said: “Nine Labour gains shows there is real trust in the Labour Party, a real affection for the future of our city and I think that what we need is a general election.\n\nExtrapolating the vote share from the local elections would see Labour candidate Fred Thomas win the Plymouth Moor View seat at a General Election. But Mr Mercer said he is up for the challenge of retaining his seat.\n\nHe said: “Local elections (these were for local councillors) were indeed difficult for the Conservatives last night. I congratulate those who won in the Labour Party and commiserate with those who lost. I am especially proud of Chris Wood's victory in Eggbuckland who won for the Conservatives, denying Toady [corr] Evans his much wanted clean sweep.\n\n\"It is odd that every candidate who won for Labour, at what should have been a moment to celebrate, instead decided to use their moment to launch a diatribe about me. I wasn't even there - I have a child who is sick at the moment - but such is the class of this crowd. The good news is Labour will still have to do significantly better than they did last night to win a majority in Parliament - pretty astounding given the challenges the Government have faced down in recent years.\n\n\"So as someone once said, I'm afraid reports of my demise have been heavily exaggerated. I'm feeling pretty chipper about the General Election when I get to go out and properly fight for my seat. It will be hard - of that I have no doubt.\"\n\nMr Mercer, who has taken to referring to Plymouth City Council Labour Leader Tudor Evans as \"Toady Evans\" on social media and now in an official statement, added: \"Labour will run - as is traditional with a weak candidate - a highly personal campaign. But I am proud of all we have achieved and I look forward to the challenge.\""
