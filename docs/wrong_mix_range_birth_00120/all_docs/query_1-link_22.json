        "text": "CANYON REJUVENATION DEPT.\n\nWe’ve had only one and a half inches of rain this season. That’s poor.\n\nIn early spring of 2019 I explored what I call Flow Falls above “the Grotto,” which had recently been rejuvenated by heavy rains,15-odd inches. Re-View and be rejuvenated yourself. It may be years before this insignificant, exquisite place gets to put on a show like this. I forgot about this film because I thought I had spoiled all my footage — the glare in the slot-canyon was so intense that day, shot after shot went to white. Yesterday, to cheer myself up I went back over the footage…it was so nice. I thought, maybe Mabel Mercer could make it all work ; she can do anything…Patient Reader, she did! Click and be transported to the ephemeral Eden of a seasonal waterfall through some of the most fascinating geology on God’s green Earth:\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1YB0IyZ1peE3OvvOvP_ujn-29DYpoS8n3/view?usp=sharing\n\nFor years, Clio and I had tried to explore this fascinating little side chamber off La Tuna Canyon in the green Verdugo Hills; but the slender bowl at the bottom had always been overgrown, just a dry rocky “theatre” at the bottom of a 50 foot trail down from the road. Pretty, and romantic, but the ledge sealed the place off from the barricade of brown dead live oak and fiery red poison oak above. I didn’t even notice the syncline, it was so covered with blackberry brambles. Since we were in drought in those years, there was no “flow” at all here, ever. It looked like an old abandoned quarry. I didn’t dream such a picayune place could support a spring, much less a waterfall. Then HUGE fires in 2017 scourged it, choking it even more with thick muddy ashes and debris. Then 2019’s fierce rains flushed it out and rejuvenated the whole drainage. I’ll continue to document this astonishing vest-pocket Yosemite as I visit.\n\n“My Shining Hour” (1943), from The Sky’s the Limit. Music by Harold Arlen, words by Johnny Mercer.\n\nThe guitar is a legacy of Spanish culture in America. Los Angeles is, and always has been, the capital of Spanish culture in America, and Los Angeles has developed from these roots an awesome — indeed unparalleled — guitar history.\n\nLos Angeles, and later Hollywood, and later still North Hollywood, have been since 1849 the destination of every dreamer with a six-string. (Remember that the “Western” portion of “Country/Western” refers to Hollywood, not Nashville; and that Capitol Records, at Hollywood/Vine, was the launching place of the Beatles, among other greats, to world audiences.) Hollywood Boulevard still attracts people of staggering talent and heartbreaking genius.\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1c336lh1FactDkvNg7pLqEJYVbCJFuIzn/view?usp=sharing\n\nClick above to hear “Ringo” singing about Hollywood. (True, Ringo isn’t a guitar player, but the other Fab 3 were.) The group is “Ticket to Ride,” a wonderful Beatles cover band that appeared in NoHo Park last month. I saw “Beatlemania” four times at the Winter Garden Theatre on Broadway in the early 80s; but this Beatles concert, free, under the stars, a few steps from my front door, on the cool eucalyptus-scented green, where weed was perfectly legal, was pure heaven.\n\nGene Autry, Woody Guthrie, Roy Rogers, native Richie Valens, Les Ford, and Frank Zappa are representative of great LA guitarists who are recognized for developing and popularizing the art and the instrument. Their beats and choruses and chords and rhythms and riffs, and the recording techniques they pioneered, are the ground work for the most popular music the world ever knew.\n\nClick below for Brad Raisin, one of the local singer-songwriters who blesses the City of the Queen of Angels by composing among her sage-scented breezes, and performing his songs at Kulak’s Woodshed in Valley Village. Here’s Raisin’s catchy take on “Hollywood Blvd.”, a brand new song, live from North Hollywood, premiered just last week.\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1K_J3p-2BqG1mqK0qg8myj-P0n1lnYoNQ/view?usp=sharing\n\nOne of America’s greatest heroes, Gen. Hugh Mercer, commemorated in bronze in the middle of his adopted hometown: Fredericksburg, VA.\n\nGeorge Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Monroe, James Madison, and Robert E. Lee all accomplished important and memorable deeds in Fredericksburg; so it is a significant tribute that this Scots immigrant-American patriot’s statue takes pride of place here.\n\nApprenticed as a Scots lad to an herbalist, apothecary, and barber-surgeon, Mercer was not an Edinburgh University-trained medical doctor. But in the 18th century, this meant that he was actually valuable and effective as a healer; especially, he proved, on battlefields. As a young Scots firebrand, he fought at Culloden with Bonnie Prince Charlie, earning the enmity of the British. So he fled to Virginia, where he throve as a druggist in the bustling Scots mercantile colony at the Falls of the Rappahannock, then a new capital of the frontier Piedmont district.\n\nHis military experience proved too valuable to the colonial governors (many of these, Dinwiddie included, were Scots themselves) to worry about his Whiggish politics. In the French and Indian War, Mercer was commissioned, along with his co-officer Col. George Washington, to secure the West Virginia/Pennsylvania backcountry that controlled the headwaters of the mighty Ohio River, gateway to the West. Mercer and Washington and Braddock captured Fort Duquesne from the French, and, legend has it, Mercer re-named the Fort after Parliamentary leader William Pitt. Thus, Mercer was founder of Pittsburgh.\n\nBefore the Revolution. he was active in Fredericksburg’s enlightened Masonic Lodge, and (with John Paul Jones, and the other Founding Fathers mentioned above) he organized the local Committee of Safety. After Lexinrgton and Concord, Mercer served under his friend Washington in the Continental Army. In this capacity he fortified the New Jersey Palisades; thus he founded Fort Lee (which Mercer named for his immediate superior, that odious turncoat and soon-to-be disgraced coward of Monmouth, Gen. Henry Charles Lee.)\n\nMercer was the military genius of the Battle of Trenton. It was his plan for Washington to take the army out of Valley Forge, put them in rowboats across the icy Delaware, and attack the strongly-fortified British barracks at Trenton. Thus the Yankees did, on Christmas Night, 1777, and Washington’s victory over the surprised, drunken Hessians was the turning point of the War.\n\nA few freezing days later, Mercer was the hero of the Battle of Princeton. After fierce fighting, Mercer was bayoneted seven times and left on the field for dead. When his men discovered him, Mercer refused to be carried off. His brigade rallied, and, with tears streaming down their frozen cheeks, they propped him up on an oak where he could survey the battlefield. There they stood as a honor guard around their commander, until the battle was won. (In a story worthy of Mercer’s countryman Sir James Frazer: the Mercer Oak became the emblem of Princeton and Mercer County, NJ; and the tree itself became a sacred shrine for centuries; it survived, in an hallowed commemoratory grove in Princeton, until 2000; when lightning struck it mortally. Clones, I believe, have been made, and may be thriving in the park, and other New Jersey gardens.)\n\nThe hero was taken to Philadelphia but (or, thus?) he was dead by the end of January, 1778. (Despite the heroic measures of one of the finest doctors in the world: the Philadelphia Quaker, Penn professor, gone-back-to-Edinburgh-to-train, medical doctor, Benjamin Rush.)\n\nOdd, I think, that the hero of Culloden and Princeton is buried in Christ Church cemetery; for it is the mother Anglican graveyard in Philadelpha. Notwithstanding, Mercer was buried there 240 years ago this month.\n\nR.I.P., Brigadier-General Hugh Mercer.\n\nMercer’s large family flourished in Virginia, in New Jersey, and in Savannah, part of the fascinating Scottish influence among the South’s economic elite. Mercer and his oak physically embody the Virginia Scots’ ties to the Scots Presbyterian intellectual stronghold, Princeton, NJ.\n\nBut really folks, i’m only kvelling over Hugh, because he was the first American ancestor of Savannah, GA’s, and Hollywood’s, songwriting legend: the phenomenal Johnny Mercer, Father of the Great American Songbook, and founder of Capitol Records. More on HIM, in future blog entries."
