        "text": "Johnny Mercer tells veterans to be 'proud' of work in Afghanistan\n\nThe Conservative MP for Plymouth Moor View, 40, travels to the front line in the war in Ukraine in a new documentary shown this afternoon. Channel 4’s ‘Ukraine: On the Front Line with Johnny Mercer’ sees the soldier-turned-politician experience Russia’s invasion of the country first-hand. In the 30-minute film, part of the ‘Dispatches’ series, Mr Mercer travels from Kraków in Poland to the Ukrainian city of Lviv.\n\nThe ex-veterans minister, who resigned last year, also goes to Kyiv, where Russian troops have advanced on the suburbs of the capital and shelled the city centre.\n\nThe Tory MP spent a week in Ukraine with explorer and veteran Levison Wood, and director Neil Bonner.\n\nThe trio were invited on the trip by Ukrainian MPs to highlight the stark realities of the war, offer their support and help tell the stories of the millions of citizens forced from their homes.\n\nJohnny said: “I want this film to communicate the amazing resilience and bravery of the people we met in Kyiv.\n\n“I hope it will help my colleagues and the British public make the right decisions about how we can all support Ukraine to get through this conflict, which is our generation’s righteous fight.”\n\nJUST IN: Russian conscripts unleash fury over ‘80-year-old’ rifles - ‘They don’t f***ing fire!’\n\nMr Mercer has already experienced the horrors of war during his own military career with the British Army.\n\nThe ex-squaddie is known today for stubbornly advocating for veterans’ rights and those of his constituents.\n\nBut before winning his Plymouth seat for the Tories in 2015, he spent 12 years in the armed forces.\n\nHis career started with a stint in the City of London before he graduated from the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, in June 2003.\n\nHe was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery before being promoted to lieutenant in April 2005.\n\nMr Mercer mostly served with the 29th Commando Regiment Royal Artillery and third Regiment Royal Horse Artillery.\n\nHe completed three tours of Afghanistan as a liaison and training officer with the Afghan forces.\n\nThe MP was with a special forces unit and oversaw artillery and air strikes to support troops on the ground.\n\nHe opened up about his time in Afghanistan in his 2017 memoir, ‘We Were Warriors: A Powerful and Moving Story of Courage Under Fire’.\n\nThe former soldier gave a gripping account of his time in Afghanistan after British and American forces invaded the middle eastern country to topple the Taliban in 2001.\n\nDON'T MISS:\n\nPutin humiliation as Russian troops are ‘switching sides’ to join Ukraine's forces [LATEST]\n\nRoyal POLL: Should Queen take a backseat to Charles after Prince Andrew decision? [INSIGHT]\n\nQueen's eerie doomsday speech for breakout of nuclear war unearthed [ANALYSIS]\n\nMr Mercer wrote about his and his colleagues’ bloody fight with militants of the fundamentalist group, which regained control of Afghanistan last year.\n\nThe MP included incredibly personal details about the death of his close friend Lance Bombardier Mark Chandler.\n\nThe soldier was shot in the face next to Mr Mercer during his third tour of Afghanistan in 2010.\n\nMark’s death “stung” Mr Mercer, who revealed in a Twitter post last year how his friend “died in his arms”.\n\nMr Mercer retired from the military in December 2013 with the rank of captain.\n\nAfter more than three years as an MP, Mr Mercer won Channel 4 reality show ‘Celebrity Hunted’ in November 2018.\n\nLast April, he resigned from Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Cabinet as veterans minister over a new piece of legislation after claiming he was sacked by text.\n\nThe politician was angry that the Overseas Operations (Service Personnel and Veterans) Bill did not extend to protect veterans who fought in the Troubles in Northern Ireland.\n\n‘Ukraine: On the Front Line with Johnny Mercer’ airs on Channel 4 this afternoon from 5:30pm."
