        "text": "The Savannah Philharmonic (SavPhil) and Savannah Music Festival (SMF) attended a presentation from architect and urban planner Christian Sottile at a City Council meeting last spring where a plan was presented for the redevelopment of the Civic Center site downtown. The proposed plan includes the largest restoration of the Oglethorpe Plan in Savannah’s history, returning six of the 10 blocks that were lost in Elbert and Orleans wards when the Civic Center was built in 1972. In order to do so, the Martin Luther King Jr. Arena would be demolished, but the Johnny Mercer Theatre would remain standing and undergo a full renovation to incorporate contemporary technology and performance industry-standard acoustics, as well as a complete décor makeover.\n\nAs understanding and momentum build around the proposed plan for the current Savannah Civic Center, the SavPhil and SMF fully support the renovation of the historic Johnny Mercer Theatre. The theater offers an infrastructure that, if lost, would be expensive to recreate andwould prohibit certain performances from taking place in Savannah. Further, it is a very important gathering place for our community.\n\nThe Johnny Mercer Theatre is part of an important portfolio of entertainment venues, including the Enmarket Arena, the Lucas Theatre for the Arts, and Trustees Theater, among others, that provide a broad range of entertainment options. Each space serves a unique function allowing different types of presentations. Within this portfolio, the Mercer has an infrastructure that none of the others have, including a large-scale fly system—a pulley system that allows scenery backdrops and lighting to be moved in and out for a Broadway-caliber theatrical performance such as Phantom of the Opera. Many Broadway shows also require an orchestra pit, which it has, and the seating capacity of 2,566 is also the perfect size for acts like the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, the Tedeschi Trucks Band, Wilco, Bonnie Raitt, or Bob Dylan.\n\nCurrently, the Savannah Philharmonic performs at the Lucas Theatre for the Arts throughout their season, and with the organization’s 15th anniversary on the horizon they are looking to the future. The annual Savannah Music Festival is held throughout 9-12 venues across the City and having the opportunity to plan for performances in the iconic venue would be a tremendous asset. Additionally, both organizations could continue to utilize the Mercer as a site for youth concerts and educational activities.\n\nWhile the decision to move forward with the project has not yet been voted on and determined, and completion of the proposed Mercer project would be years away, now is the time for crucial conversations and key planning meetings between the City of Savannah and arts organizations from the Savannah community to emphasize the importance of the Mercer, discuss potential uses for a renovated theater, and ensure that the needs of the arts community are met.\n\nThe Savannah Philharmonic and Savannah Music Festival share the vision of what has been proposed and are eager to be instrumental members of the team that will bring the project to fruition."
