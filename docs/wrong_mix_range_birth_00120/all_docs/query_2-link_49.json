        "text": "(1909–76). Known for his descriptive flair and clever wording, Johnny Mercer produced some 1,000 lyrics during a career that spanned more than four decades.\n\nJohn Herndon Mercer was born on November 18, 1909, in Savannah, Georgia. Although he originally wanted to be an actor when he moved to New York after high school, he instead found success as a lyricist. In 1930 one of his first songs, “Out of Breath and Scared to Death of You,” was used in the revue Garrick Gaieties. He later moved to Hollywood and found his niche writing lyrics to music for motion pictures. Mercer also performed frequently on the radio during the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nMercer was the first lyricist to win four Academy Awards, taking honors for “On the Atchison, Topeka, and the Santa Fe” from The Harvey Girls (1946), “In the Cool, Cool, Cool of the Evening” from Here Comes the Groom (1951), “Moon River” from Breakfast at Tiffany’s (1961), and “Days of Wine and Roses” from the film of the same name (1962). The last two, collaborations with Henry Mancini, also earned Grammy Awards as song of the year.\n\nMercer formed a variety of musical partnerships during his career. He teamed with Harold Arlen for the songs “Blues in the Night” (1941), “That Old Black Magic” (1942), and “One for My Baby” (1943). The two men also collaborated on the Broadway musicals St. Louis Woman (1946, known for the song “Come Rain or Come Shine”) and Saratoga (1959). Other notable partnerships produced the songs “Lazybones” (with Hoagy Carmichael, 1933), “Hooray for Hollywood” (with Richard Whiting, 1938), and “Jeepers Creepers” (with Harry Warren, 1938). Mercer and Gene DePaul scored the film Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954) and the Broadway production of Li’l Abner (1956).\n\nAlthough known mainly for his lyrics, Mercer wrote both words and music for several songs, including “I’m an Old Cowhand,” sung by Bing Crosby in the movie Rhythm on the Range (1936), and “Something’s Gotta Give,” from Daddy Long Legs (1955). He also sang some of his own material, such as “Ac-cent-tchu-ate the Positive” (1945) and “Baby, It’s Cold Outside” (with Margaret Whiting, 1949).\n\nAfter undergoing an operation for a brain tumor in 1975, Mercer died on June 25, 1976, in Los Angeles, California. Capitol Records, which he cofounded in 1942, celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1992 by releasing a collection of Mercer’s tunes performed by some of the label’s most famous artists. The American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers established an award in his honor."
