        "text": "The article is an attempt to identify a few common themes in a body of work while at the same time thinking about Sweden as especially conducive to pessimistic thinking regarding the decline in the moral economy of the world. Ever since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the new found independence of the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, Swedish film-makers have repeatedly crossed the Baltic Sea in search of subject matter not readily available in the supposedly well-ordered domestic setting at home. In these films, the former communist territories have almost invariably been imagined as marked by malaise, decay, a crumbling infrastructure and as destinations for sex tourism. Social security appears at a low ebb, poverty is rampant and phenomena such as for instance prostitution, trafficking, drug use and orphanism all seem to be on the rise. Possibly the most famous example of such a film is Lukas Moodyson’s 2002 Lilja 4-ever (Lilya 4-ever), the story of an orphaned teenage girl from the former Eastern bloc who ultimately is manipulated into coming to Sweden for a life as an involuntary sex worker. However, Moodysson’s film is not a monolith. The article is an attempt to identify a few common themes in this body of work."
