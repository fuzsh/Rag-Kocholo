        "text": "This film is about wanting to go and leave everything behind, it’s about abandonment, about the rich who think that everything can be bought and about the poor who have to sell everything they have. It’s a film about discouragement, about death, about an eternal friendship, about a flame that refuses to be extinguished. (— Maud Geffray)\n\nAfter three short films, Lukas Moodyson directed “Fucking Åmål”, which earned him a Teddy Award and four Guldbagge Awards, including best film. He carried on with the acclaimed Together (2000) followed by Lilya 4-ever (2002), A Hole in my Heart (2003), Container (2006) and Mammoth (2009). In 2013, he adapted We are the best! based on a comic book written by his wife, Coco Moodysson."
