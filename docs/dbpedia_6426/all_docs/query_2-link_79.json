        "text": "We Are the Best!, the new film from acclaimed Swedish director Lukas Moodysson (Lilya 4-Ever), is gathering steam in Cannes with Metrodome snatching up U.K. rights to the 1980s period piece after seeing a three-minute promo screened by sales agent TrustNordisk.\n\nMetrodome, which released Moodysson’s Lilya 4-Ever and Together in Britain, was the first to board the in-production feature, which is based on the graphic novel of the same name by Moodysson’s wife Coco, a well-known comics artist in Sweden.\n\nThe film follows three young misfits growing up in 1980s Stockholm.\n\nLars Jonsson is producing We Are the Best! for Memfis Film with Film i Vast, SVT and Zentropa as co-producers. The Swedish release is set for October.\n\nWe Are the Best! is billed as a return to Moodysson’s funnier, lighter films, such as F-ing Amal (1998) and Together, compared with the darker fare of his more recent work, such as Mammoth (2009) and A Hole in My Heart (2004)."
