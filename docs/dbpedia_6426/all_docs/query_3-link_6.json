        "text": "In the former Soviet Union, teenage girl Lilya (Oksana Akinshina) finds herself with nowhere left to turn when she is abandoned by her mother and neglected by her aunt. Vulnerable to exploitation and rejected by the local community, Lilya thinks her luck has changed when she meets the charming Andrei, who tells her to move to Sweden—however, the worst is yet to come. Shocking and moving in equal measure, Lukas Moodysson’s unflinching third feature was the recipient of several awards and has also been used by humanitarian organization to illustrate the very real horrors it presents."
