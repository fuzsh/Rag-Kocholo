Pixieish, mohawk-sporting Klara and her best friend Bobo are 13-year-old rebels looking for a cause. Despite having no instrumentsâor discernible musical talentâthe two put all their energy into forming an all-girl punk band, recruiting their shy, classical guitar-playing schoolmate Hedwig as a third wheel. With tender affection for its young characters, We Are the Best! paints a joyous and sharply observant portrait of the rebellious spirit of youth and growing up different.",

Earns Its Title.\"\n\n- The Village Voice\n\n\"It may be temporarily impossible to erase the grin from your face while watching Lukas Moodyssonâs We Are the Best, because it very thankfully lives up to its lofty title.\"\n\n- Under the Radar Magazine\n\n\"The groupâs anthem âHate the Sportâ is inspired by a stuffy gym teacher, and itâs maybe the catchiest thing youâll hear this year.\"\n\n- Under the Radar Magazine\n\n\"Gets under your skin, into your heart, and refuses to be forgotten.\"\n\n- Cinema Blend\n\n\" No film Iâve seen so far this year has provided the sheer moviegoing pleasure of 'We Are the Best!â\"\n\n- NY POST\n\n\"Irresistible.\"\n\n- AV CLUB\n\n\"The feel good movie of the year.\"\n\n- Twitch\n\n\"A BLISSFULLY FUNNY FILM.

Itâs satisfying.\"\n\n- Nerdist\n\n\"Touching.\"\n\n- SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE\n\n\"A Must-see summer movie\"\n\n- Nylon\n\n\"A NEW MASTERPIECE.\"\n\n- Pitchfork\n\n\"Will rock your world.\"\n\n- THE OREGONIAN\n\n\"Spontaneously, infectiously, endearingly fun.\"\n\n- Newsday"
