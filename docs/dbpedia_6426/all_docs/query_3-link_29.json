        "text": "It is very hard to put into words Lilya 4-Ever's penetrating effect. Phrases containing \"eviscerating\" or \"harrowing\" seem somehow understated or out of place. I suppose a more accurate word would simply be \"honest\". In this film, much like his previous \"Show Me Love\" Lukas Moodysson pulls no punches on his viewers. Shot in a gritty, almost documentary style there appears to be very little patterned manipulation - no cinematic slight of hand... but of course, there is. Perhaps this is his greatest credit; creating a focused story with almost cascading suffering for the main character, and having it appear so uncontrived. I attempted to joke about this to myself in my first viewing, hoping, I suppose, to remove myself from the tragic circumstances on screen. I think instead it may have sensitized me further.\n\nThere are two separate scenes in the film where the major characters (Lilja and Volodya) are carving their names in a wooden bench, as if to remind someone in the world that they exist. In reflection it is heartbreaking. The greatest compliment I can give this film is that it reminded me of the work of two of my favorite filmmakers - The Dardenne brothers - Jean-Pierre and Luc. Like their films, there are obvious political undertones as Moodysson shows the rich attempting to buy their happiness and the poor forced to sell everything they have (excluding their souls). It exposed an injustice far away that never reaches the human interest stories of my newspapers. If I was to compare it to a film of the past I would say it was an updated version of Bresson's \"Mouchette\" - a story of a young teenager attempting to survive. Like the Dardenne's the casting seems to be of paramount importance and Oksana Akinshina was a perfect choice. Her attractive face is often underplayed to her innocent expressions."
