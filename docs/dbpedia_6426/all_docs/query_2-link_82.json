        "text": "LILYA 4-EVER [ 1/2]\n\nIn Russian and Swedish, with English subtitles. Running time: 105 minutes. Not rated (sex, violence). At the Lincoln Plaza and the Cinema Village.\n\n—–\n\nLUKAS Moodysson’s two previous films, the teen-lesbian drama “Show Me Love” and the communal comedy “Together,” only hinted at the talent of the Swedish director.\n\nHis newest, “Lilya 4-Ever,” proves Moodysson to be one of the brightest young directors today.\n\nLilya is a poverty-stricken, 16-year-old girl living in a dreary Russian suburb.\n\nWhen her mother abandons Lilya and goes to America, the fragile girl is left on her own.\n\nHer nasty aunt takes over Lilya’s apartment, sending the girl to a battered flat elsewhere.\n\nIt isn’t surprising that she forms a brother-sister relationship with a cocky 11-year-old street kid, and the two fantasize about a better life.\n\nBut times are hard for Lilya. She turns to prostitution, vomiting after her first trick.\n\nThen she meets a good-looking, seemingly nice guy who promises to take her away to a better life in Sweden.\n\nHe sends her on ahead. At the airport, she is met by a man who takes her to an apartment and locks her in.\n\nIt takes awhile, but Lilya realizes that she has been sold into prostitution slavery, an all-too-common tragedy in Europe.\n\nLilya is portrayed by Oksana Akinshina, who gives a dynamic, heartbreaking performance.\n\nHer only previous film was Russian director Sergei Bodrov Jr.’s “Brothers” (2001). She played 13-year-old Sveta, who goes on the lam with her half-sister to escape mobsters seeking the money they claim Sveta’s gangster dad owes them.\n\nShe was wonderful in that role, but is even more astonishing in “Lilya 4-Ever.”\n\n(Akinshina made one film after “Lilya 4-Ever,” and is working on a second.)\n\nMoodysson takes on a sensitive subject, and he conveys its horrors without even a hint of exploitation.\n\nAs in “Show Me Love,” the director proves that he can coax fine performances from untrained young people.\n\nSurreal fantasy sequences serve as brief respites from the otherwise serious mood of “Lilya 4-Ever.”\n\nPerhaps the film will draw attention to the serious problem of young women being forced into prostitution in Europe – and help fight it."
