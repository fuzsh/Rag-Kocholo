        "text": "Is a commune still a commune if it only has two members? A quarter-century after we last met Lukas Moodysson’s Together family in his 2000 film about a group of pants-optional Swedish hippies striving to create a domestic utopia in 1975, only Göran and Klas remain in their dusty Stockholm house. Together 99 (Tillsammans 99) reunites the original friends at a late-nineties birthday party to see how the political and personal vagaries of the intervening years have affected Signe, Elisabeth, Klasse, Erik and friends.\n\nThe first film opens with a house heaving at the edges, but by millennium’s-end the collective dream has been reduced to the world’s smallest commune, in which two lonely men bicker and fuss over the correct way to do the dishes. It’s a far cry from the futuristic, horny, body-positive energy of the original, which, in the words of Letterboxd member Jack, is “a brilliant, freewheeling piece on family, time and identity.” “Together is always toeing the line between comedy and drama,” Christof agrees, “with the dominant mood being one of light-heartedness, despite also tackling hard subjects [such] as domestic violence in a sincere way.”\n\nLukas, I can’t express what a pleasure it was to see Lisa Lindgren and Henrik Lundström and the rest of the cast again. Why did you want to bring them back together?\n\nLukas Moodysson: Well, it took a long time for me to want that, because I felt like I wasn’t really interested in what was happening to them after a year or two, or even ten or so. I just felt like, ‘No, I should leave them alone.’ But then, when you get older, there are some things that you feel like happened quite recently, and you think about it and you realize it was actually twenty or 30 years ago… I think I needed that kind of perspective, the craziness of feeling that something is sort of close but also very, very far away. So then I started just fantasizing a little bit about what happened to the commune.\n\nMy first instinct was of course that the commune disintegrated completely, and then I felt like, ‘Oh, then I have to make a film about all these fragmented lives, and that doesn’t really sound like fun.’ But then I felt like there could be two people still there, and it could be Göran and Klas, and that would be so cute. And the next thing that came was also Erik. He was so extremely political, even communist—not only socialist, but communist in 1975—and he had to have had to make that turn in some way. So those were the starting points.\n\nI was reading Letterboxd reviews this morning of the first film, just to get a refreshed sense of what it was we loved about Together the first time round. I mean, apart from this one review by Lea, who writes that Göran is the number one girl boss in the world. Would you like to respond to that?\n\nNo, I think that stands for itself.\n\nThe main theme is this beautiful sense that people who watch it feel like they genuinely think it could make you a better human, these films, together. And, especially, being struck by how tender you are with your characters, and that even the worst of them are treated with care—and even get redemptive arcs.\n\nYeah. But that’s also one of the reasons why I watch not a lot of movies, because that’s what I lack when I see things. Because I want people to be treated kindly because I don’t think you should make movies about people that you don’t like in some way. I can throw as much dirt on them during the whole film, but in the end, there has to be some kind of sympathy with them and so on.\n\nI grew up with really, I think, dark music and things like The Cure, that were the biggest inspiration for me in my whole life. There is not a lot of humor in The Cure, but the feeling that there is something like, in all this darkness, there is also something warm and intimate. And closeness in some way. And something euphoric also. When I make films, I can take that and I can add the humor.\n\nI saw The Boy and the Heron yesterday—have you seen the new Miyazaki film?\n\nNo.\n\nSo that’s one film I’ve seen here this week, and a couple of others and now yours, Together 99, which feel like they’re getting at the idea of how to live. How it should be.\n\nOr, at least in my case, how it should be possible at least to try to live. Because I think in some ways, the film destroys any idea that this idea could actually work, of living this sort of alternative lifestyle in a non-nuclear family and so on. But in the end, the dream is not really dead because they are there. So I think it’s about something like, that there are possibilities, still.\n\nBoth films feature arguments about the dishes in the opening scenes. Talk to me about the microaggressions involved in dirty dishes in a household, and how we as a community can solve that problem.\n\nI’ve become really good at doing the dishes, so it’s not a problem for me really these days. I’m not perfect, but I think I’m quite good at doing dishes. We’ve been married for almost 30 years, and after a while, you... It doesn’t have to be sharing. Some people can be better at some things and in some places. So, for example, we have a van, a camper van, and in that, my wife cooks all the food because I can’t. But at home, I cook all the food because she can’t. You have to sort of portion out what people are good at.\n\nYeah, but there’s something very specific about how fucked-up dishes make people.\n\nFor me, doing laundry is worse. That’s more of a conflict area. I don’t really feel like I’m very good at doing the laundry. I’m better at doing the dishes, I think.\n\nAnd sorry I keep banging on about the dishes, but watching Together and then Together 99, and the fact that it’s a thing in both, had me feeling like, ‘If we can solve this issue, we can solve humanity’s problems.’ One of the things, right, is that someone could be doing the dishes and the person who’s not doing them will stand right there going, ‘You’re doing it wrong’.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut at least that person’s doing the dishes. This person’s just criticizing.\n\nBut it’s also really disgusting when Göran, in the beginning, when it’s, I believe Klas, when he says that, “It’s not really clean because you’re using cold water. You can’t do the dishes in cold water.” I actually agree there with Klas. I think you should do the dishes all right, really. Sloppy dishes, no.\n\nYou did something really interesting with music this time: there’s very little of it, and it’s either much older or very contemporary to 1999. Swedish superstars ABBA were such a major soundtrack feature of Together, and then you come to ’99 and we’re a long way from the seventies—it’s all about the rave scene.\n\nWell, it’s also a reaction for me personally against what I feel: that [in] so many films and even more TV series, it’s overloaded by music. I just don’t want to push people in telling them how to feel here and add sad music or energetic music. I just want people to sort of see the film in itself.\n\nNormally in a party like that, because it’s a dinner and a party, they should listen to music, and I really didn’t want them to so I had to invent the idea that the amplifier was broken so they couldn’t listen to any music. They could only listen on this old thing that I don’t know the word for in English [gramophone], which meant that they had to listen to music actually from their parents’ generation, which makes it sort of nostalgic for them. Which also, for me, adds a kind of weird atmosphere to the whole thing, because that music is also from the Second World War, so it doesn’t really add up, which makes it sort of strange in a way.\n\nAnd then, with this film, I think a lot of time I just wanted to just push them into as much chaos as possible as a director, and just take as many chances as possible, because I never really read the script. I feel like there are two persons in me: there’s one who writes the script and then there is the director who doesn’t really care about the script. Occasionally I have to go back to the script because I think ‘maybe all that dialogue that I wrote that was actually good, so let’s stick to that dialogue’, but a lot of the times they just improvise quite a lot, actually.\n\nAlso I have a cinematographer [Ellinor Hallin] who’s great at just letting go and just seeing what happens, so we never really plan anything except when it’s sort of technically difficult. Like, if it takes place outside, in darkness, then we unfortunately had to put up a lamp or something like that, but otherwise everything is made in natural light and so on. So we just played around.\n\nEven though [the cast] were in the first film, I think they were a bit surprised in the beginning that everything was so loose the whole time. I was always running around and didn’t know where my shoes were, and just lost everything and just had people to help me find my script, and I don’t know. I need a lot of help when I’m directing because I never really know what to do after lunch and so on. The only thing I want to do when I’m directing is sort of be in the present and try to make some kind of life there. And then it was just fun to watch them, because they’re really good.\n\nYour highest-rated film according to the Letterboxd community is Lilya 4-ever. What's the highest-rated in your heart of the films you’ve made?\n\nI could say this new one, but if I should say some of the old, I would probably say We Are the Best! because I think it also has some of that loose and beautiful atmosphere where things are sort of gliding and not really story-driven necessarily. And also some kind of freedom in the way the actors are behaving and what they’re saying and so on. I really like it. At least in Sweden, in the beginning, it didn’t really get a huge audience, but I think it’s continued to live in a way and is finding new audiences in places. So that’s my favorite film, I think.\n\nI’m so happy to hear it, because I am a huge audience for that film. I have a special request. Now that you’ve made a sequel to Together, last question for you, Lukas, could you please one day revisit the We Are the Best! girls?\n\nThis is something I have been thinking about, but I’m a little bit afraid it would be like I have to put them in pain. Because you can’t really make a film about them just being happy for the rest of their lives, so it has a bit to be Career Girls. I’m not sure if I want to put them in a lot of pain and having children and divorce and all of that. I think, ‘Shouldn’t they just be there as some kind of little figures that took place in the past, and then you can think back at them?’ I don’t know. It would be too simple to put them in a place where they still have a punk band... You have to give me a suggestion: what happens to them?\n\nYou need to read Viv Albertine’s book, Clothes, Clothes, Clothes. Music, Music, Music. Boys, Boys, Boys. That’ll give you all the inspiration you need for why we might revisit them.\n\nI will do that. Thanks for the idea."
