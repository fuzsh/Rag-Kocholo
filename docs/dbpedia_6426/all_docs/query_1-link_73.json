        "text": "Exclusive: The Swedish director’s sequel to his 2000 hit movie is due to start filming in August-September.\n\nREinvent International Sales has just closed the first pre-sales with September Film for the Benelux and Film Europe for the Czech Republic and Slovakia.\n\nSweden’s top writer/director Lukas Moodysson (Show Me Love, Lilya 4-ever, We Are the Best!) has set Together 99 two decades after the first film which sold around 2.5 million tickets worldwide and picked up various international awards. Gustaf Hammarsten (Thunder in my Heart, Midnight Sun) will be reprising his title role as Göran, the gentle and conflict-avoiding character. But instead of the idealistic group of hippies who gathered around him and freely shared their communal living in the first film, here the group is reduced to two people: Göran and Klasse, played again by Shanti Roney. Feeling a bit lonely, the two characters decide to do a reunion with their old friends."
