        "text": "The film is produced by Memfis Film in co-production with SF Studios and Film i Väst. SF Studios will distribute the film in the Nordics and Reinvent handles international sales. Together 99 is expected to premiere in Swedish cinemas in 2023 followed by an international release.\n\nTogether 99 tells the story of a group of very different individuals who in 1975 lived in a commune called “Together”. Now it is 1999, 24 years later, and the collective has turned into the world's smallest. The commune consists of only two people - Göran and Klasse. Feeling a bit lonely, the idea occurs of a reunion with their old friends…\n\n\"Together 99 will be the world's saddest comedy. It´s about getting old, looking back, regretting everything you have done, or regretting nothing, lying awake at night missing someone you have not met in twenty years, longing back, looking forward. And about the collective - it has shrunk drastically, there are not many left. Almost everyone has gone their separate ways. What has become of them? Has it gone well or badly? Who has become famous and who has ended up in a madhouse? Are the dreams from the seven-ties alive or are they dead? Does Göran still eat porridge?”, says Lukas Moodysson, director.\n\nThe film is written and directed by award-winning director Lukas Moodysson, who has made iconic films as Show Me Love (1998), Together (2000), Lilya 4-ever (2002), the international film Mammoth (2009) and We Are the Best! (2013). All co-produced with Film i Väst. Recently Moodysson has directed the series Gösta (2019) for HBO.\n\nGustaf Hammarsten (Thunder in my Heart, Brüno, Together) returns in the role as Göran, the sweet-hearted, conflict-avoiding character that the commune used to center around, and Shanti Roney (Applause, Nymphomaniac: Vol 2, Breaking Out) plays his friend Klasse. The other cast will be announced in August as the production starts.\n\n\"The film will be funny, dark and warm-hearted, classic Moodysson. It´s a great pleasure to continue the story about Together”, says Lars Jönsson, producer at Memfis Film.\n\nThe film is produced by Memfis Film, with producers Lars Jönsson (Show Me Love, Lilya 4-ever, Together, Gösta) and Anna Carlsten (Day by Day, The Dark Heart, Anxious People), that has produced many successful and award-winning films. The previous film Together was praised by audiences and critics both in Sweden and internationally and has sold approximately 2,500,000 cinema tickets worldwide.\n\nTogether 99 is a co-production between Memfis Film, SF Studios, Film i Väst and Zentropa Entertainments, with support from the Swedish Film Institute and Nordisk Film & TV Fond. SF Studios also distributes the film in the Nordics and REinvent handles international sales. The film is expected to premiere in Swedish cinemas in September 2023, followed by an international release."
