        "text": "COLOGNE, Germany — Mexican star Gael Garcia Bernal will topline “Mammoth,” the English-language debut from Swedish director Lukas Moodysson.\n\n“Mammoth” is a domestic drama revolving around a young couple, their child and their Filipino nanny, played by Filipino actress Marife Necisito. Casting for the other roles is under way.\n\nMoodysson, director of the critically acclaimed features “Show Me Love,” “Together” and “Lilya 4-ever,” plans to shoot “Mammoth” in Sweden, New York, Thailand and the Philippines.\n\nThe film is a co-production among Sweden’s Memfis Film, Denmark’s Zentropa Entertainment and Zentropa’s new German outpost, Zentropa Berlin.\n\nFunding will come from a patchwork of subsidy bodies in Sweden, Germany and Denmark as well as from the Eurimages fund.\n\nZentropa’s Peter Aalbaek Jensen and director Lars von Trier will produce “Mammoth” along with Zentropa Berlin managing director Maria Kopf. Danish sales group Trust Film, under new CEO Rikke Ennis, will handle international sales.\n\nBernal is shooting Fernando Meirelles’ literary adaptation “Blindness” alongside Julianne Moore."
