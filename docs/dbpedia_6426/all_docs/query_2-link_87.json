        "text": "Ingmar Bergman, Sweden’s most celebrated auteur, anointed his countryman Lukas Moodysson “a young master.” Mr. Moodysson was a published poet at 17 and, thanks to his first film, “Show Me Love,” was widely considered the new voice of Swedish cinema before he hit 30. Yet he has reacted with a kind of overgrown teenage disdain for the establishment: He has berated and made obscene gestures toward audiences and critics at awards receptions, avoided the press and once declared himself the most hated man in his native country. The guy was a stone punk.\n\n“I’m not sure I would use that word, but if you grow up with something, it stays with you the rest of your life,” Mr. Moodysson, now 45, said by telephone from Malmo, Sweden. “A lot of what I took away from punk I really appreciate today. Not believing in authorities is a good thing, and the belief that I can do whatever I want.”"
