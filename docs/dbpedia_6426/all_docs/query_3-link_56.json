        "text": "in\n\nLilya 4-Ever (2002)\n\nDirector: Lukas Moodysson\n\nWriter: Lukas Moodysson\n\nCast: Oksana Akinshina, Artyom Bogucharskiy, Pavel Ponomaryov\n\nGenre: Bio Pic Drama\n\nAbout: Based on the true life story of Lilya a 16 year old girl from Estonia who is take to Sweden and forced into prostitution.\n\nReview: This is one powerful movie. I like films that are 'indie films', small budget and up close and personal and Lilya 4-Ever certainly is that and much more.\n\nI was really impressed with the first hour when we see Lilya in the slums of Russia, I kept thinking I was watching a documentary and Lilya and her young friend Volodya were real people....and that's powerful film making! I felt like I was transported to those run-down flats and I was watching real life unfold. It wasn't pretty, but it seemed very real.\n\nThe actresses who played Lilya (Oksana Akinsjina) was amazing! I never thought she was acting, it was like she was a real person and that's high praise. Same for the boy Volodya (Artiom Bogutjarskij) he was really good too, and together they had a real chemistry and a bond that came through and made the bleakness, a bit easier to watch.\n\nThe second part when she's forced into prostitution in Sweden, I could barely watch that, as it was so sad and so horrible for that to happen to her. I didn't like the Sweden part as much. I wanted to see more about how the illegal trafficking was done and the effects it had on her psychologically. We see a number of close-up scenes of guys with her and after a while that stopped being effective and I thought became counterproductive...I just wanted to see more from Lilya herself.\n\nLilya 4-Ever made a big impact on me and most movies don't do that."
