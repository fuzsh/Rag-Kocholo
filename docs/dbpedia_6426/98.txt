LILYA 4 EVER

Sweden, 2002, 109 minutes, Colour.

Oksana Akinshina, Artiom Bogus Charskia

Directed by Lukas Moodysson.

Lilya Forever is a powerful Swedish film, winner of many European awards. It was written and directed by Luke Moodysson, celebrated director of such films as Show Me Love, Together, A Hole in My Heart.

The film is a perspective on eastern Europe at the turn of the 21st century, especially focusing on young people and their rackets in child prostitution. Lilya is a Russian, living with her boyfriend, who meets an attractive man from Scandinavia and goes with him only to find herself trapped. The film is well acted, focuses on the themes of desperation in eastern Europe and the exploitation by the West.

The film is a drama rather than a documentary â€“ though it speaks to important issues. A similar film, coming from Poland in 2005, was Justine is Your Name, a story of a young woman tricked in Poland and going into Germany.

Following the other teenagers who were older, offering them glue? His friendship with Lilya, their being together, talking to one another, her inviting him in?
