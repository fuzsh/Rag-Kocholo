        "text": "At the tender age of 11, actor Henry Thomas rose to overnight stardom in one of the biggest films of all time, \"E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial\" (1982), only to recede temporarily from the spotlight before returning to a career marked by a combination of made-for-TV, independent, and mainstream film projects. As a young man he handled himself admirably in Milo Forman's \"Valmont\" (1989) opposite classically-trained thespian Colin Firth, and even managed to bring some depth to the role of a young Norman Bates in \"Psycho IV: The Beginning\" (Showtime, 1990). He found work in epics on both the big and small screen, playing the na√Øve younger brother of Brad Pitt in \"Legends of the Fall\" (1994), and as Ishmael, sole-survivor of Ahab's ill-fated quest for revenge in the miniseries \"Moby Dick\" (USA, 1998). While his supporting role in \"All the Pretty Horses\" (2000) may not have led to a hit film, his turn in Martin Scorsese's violent \"Gangs of New York\" (2002) helped move Thomas past the limitations of forever being Elliot from \"E.T.\" Guest turns on television series, such as \"Without a Trace\" (CBS, 2002-09), and supporting roles in major feature films like the romantic melodrama \"Dear John\" (2010), maintained a consistently visible profile for the working actor. Avoiding the usual pitfalls experienced by most child stars - including \"E.T.\" co-star, Drew Barrymore - Thomas wisely gave himself time to grow up off camera, which allowed audiences to accept him as a seasoned adult actor upon his return to the screen."
