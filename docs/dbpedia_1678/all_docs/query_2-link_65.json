And that’s not including all the TV series Netflix picks up from broadcast and cable networks. Below is our regularly updated guide to the 50 best shows on Netflix in the United States. Each recommendation comes with a secondary pick, too, for 100 suggestions in all.

In the decades since, the show’s reputation has waxed and waned; although these days its rep is on an upswing, as old fans and new get drawn into the mind-bending puzzles, memorable characters, big-budget polish and impressive narrative scope that makes “Lost” so entertaining. Our critic wrote, “Behind all the suspense and scary music, ‘Lost’ shows traces of sly humor — and that is a rare and valuable thing on a network drama.” (The popular science-fiction and horror pastiche “Stranger Things” is one of the many series influenced by the mysteries and character-building of “Lost.”)\n\nWatch it on Netflix\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
