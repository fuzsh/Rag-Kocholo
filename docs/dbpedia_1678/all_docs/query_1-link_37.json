These events brought visibility and awareness to issues of inclusion through yoga.\n\nPast OIX Events\n\nSpring 2024 Events\n\nLGBTQ+ Discussion Group Meeting (Spring 2024)\n\nDate & Time: Multiple dates and times, see more details below\n\nLocation: 430 Kimball Tower, South Campus (Zoom link available on request)\n\nIntended Audience: Open Event\n\nThe goal of this group is to provide support, resources, and community to LGBTQ+ faculty, staff, and students and their allies at UB. This discussion group is located on the South Campus as it gives folks that are primarily on this campus a safe space here. This group is open to anyone who wishes to join from all programs and campuses.

Johnson (Harvard) to discuss the theme of \"Reading for Liberation: The Bible in Black and Jewish Political Thought\" in this David Blitzer Lecture. Professor Susannah Heschel, Eli M. Black Distinguished Professor of Jewish Studies at Dartmouth College, will open with \"Living in Sadistic Times: The Bible, Modernity, and the Quest for Hope.\" The rise of mass death, destruction, and cruelty marks the modern period less as Kant’s vaunted era of rationalism and the universal human and far more as an era of the Marquis de Sade’s depiction of sadism. Sadism, as distinct from aggression, has been manifested in modernity in collusion with the rise of racism, resulting in terrible destruction, including for religion. What hope can we find in the Bible’s promise of redemption and its challenge for religious faith?\n\nProfessor Terrence L. Johnson , Charles G. Adams Professor of African American Religious Studies at Harvard University, will offer \"We are Not Saved: Social Death, Scripture, and 'Scripturalizing' the Race.\" His lecture will consider both the limits and opportunities of engaging Scripture as a talking book concept, a dialogical exchange between the reader and text, and community and text. Afropessimism raises several questions about the emancipatory ends of the talking book and relevancy for the current political moment. Each scholar will offer a brief lecture, then turn to conversation and open Q & A. All are welcome to the 4:45pm opening reception and 5:30pm lecture.\n\nFor more information, please visit the Event Webpage or the UB Calendar Link.

These attacks have exacerbated existing health and social disparities, emboldened violent anti-trans forces, and further marginalized trans and non-gender conforming people. The current social moment requires serious reflection on the state of trans rights, wellbeing, and responses that address the various disparities facing trans and non-gender conforming people. This panel will discuss the political climate and ways public health as a discipline can respond to trans health disparities and the conditions underlying them.\n\nFor more information please visit the Eventbrite Registration Page or the UB Calendar Link and for questions please contact Ebehitale Imobhio via email at ebehital@buffalo.edu.\n\nSponsored by the UB School of Public Health and Health Professions and the Office of Inclusive Excellence\n\nUB’s Inaugural Arab American Heritage Month Celebration (4/25/2023)\n\nDate & Time: Tuesday, April 25, 2023, 3:00-4:30pm\n\nLocation: Student Union 210 (Landmark Room)\n\nIntended Audience: University Community and Alumni\n\nPlease join us to celebrate Eid Al Fitr and April’s designation of Arab American Heritage Month for the first time here at UB!

Feminist legal scholars, however, have levelled critiques at the image of the detached and objective judge as a masculinist fantasy, a \"Herculean superhero of ancient mythology,\" according to the British law professor Erika Rackley. This talk investigates some of that ancient mythology alongside some other ancient visions of judging more in line with contemporary feminist ideas about relational decision-making. It also asks us to think about what we imagine and demand of justices today.\n\nPreceding the lecture a kosher luncheon, open to all students and faculty, is taking place.

Are you prepared to eat less (or no) meat in the dining halls? Greatly reduce attending conferences in person? Pay a fee for the carbon you emitted to commute to UB? Throw on a sweater to account for a two degree thermostat drop? Our world and our campus demand strong and swift action to mitigate and adapt to our changing climate and while many of our solutions will create greater opportunity and advance our mission of teaching, research and engagement, it is also clear that we will need to make sacrifices, specific investments and collective changes to enable broader systems transformation.\n\nJoin us for a difficult, open, fun and much needed conversation centered around what we are willing to do as an institution, a collective and as individuals to meet the challenge and how it can help advance our university’s climate action strategy.

Their talk is entitled \"Queer Indigenous Poetics: Diné 'tradition,' 'relationality,' and inhuman desire.\" The ongoing 2005 Diné Marriage Act established on and by the Navajo Nation continues to consider same-sex and same-gender marriages “void and prohibited” on the basis of cultural significance, often citing the Diné creation story to argue marriage as between one man and one woman despite the obvious queerness of that first union: rather than one ‘man’, Changing Woman marries Jóhonaaʼéí, the sun. This presentation addresses how gendered notions of ‘tradition’ impact tribal relations on the Navajo Nation through Jake Skeet’s poetry collection Eyes Bottle Dark with a Mouthful of Flowers (2019). Drawing Melissa K. Nelson’s term eco-eroticism and from what Dana Luciano and Mel Y. Chen refers to as the ‘transmaterial affections’ between nonhuman entities, this talk illustrates how Skeets invokes a reframing of the notion k’e (kinship) which insists that Diné histories are founded on a queer past and a queer longing that stresses the potentiality of another world outside the ‘here and now.’\n\nCj Jackson is a Diné writer and scholar from the Navajo Nation in Arizona. Their work primarily focuses on queer Indigenous poetics and the cultural and political formulation of relational ethics in the wake of historical dispossession and environmental catastrophe. Jackson is a current postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Indigenous Studies at the University at Buffalo.\n\nFor more information, please visit the UB Calendar link.

The purpose of this phenomenological narrative study was to explore societal expectations that affect Black undergraduate women with natural hair who attend a predominantly white institution (PWI) and their hair identity in academia. The research examined racial microaggressions directed specifically towards Black women like “Can I touch your hair?” and how Black women and their hair are intersectionally undermined to a point where people can degrade and bully their hair choices. The investigation led to uncovering how Black hair and identity are intertwined and how Black women, despite societal expectations, are embracing their natural hair.\n\nFor more information and to register, please visit the Event Registration Page.\n\nSponsored by the Professional Staff Senate Inclusion and Diversity Committee.\n\nTough Topics: The Model Minority Myth (4/23/2024)\n\nDate & Time: Tuesday, April 23, 2024, 3:30pm - 4:30pm\n\nLocation: 240 Student Union, North Campus\n\nIntended Audience: Open Event\n\nThe ‘model minority myth’ enforces harmful stereotypes and expectations of Asian American individuals.

The concept of “trans longevity” engages with all that enables more-than-survival for transpeople today, for a long time to come. While attending to the precariousness of trans lives, trans longevity resists the specter of death organizing (cis) narratives and institutional configurations of transness – and is informed instead by trans archives that emphatically assert trans presence, by trans histories that offer templates for continuation through and beyond our present. If trans futurity seems to require a leap to better times ahead, trans longevity proposes trans-futures in more tangible, scalable terms, supplying lived links embedded in today and its enduring pasts to a renovated collective long-haul.
