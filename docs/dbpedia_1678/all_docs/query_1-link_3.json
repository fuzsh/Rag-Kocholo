He was the only child of Henry Jackson Thomas Sr., a hydraulic machinist, and Carolyn, a homemaker. From the age of five, Henry aspired to become a film actor.\n\nHe attended East Central High School, which was close to his home, and later enrolled at Blinn College.

Initially, his parents were hesitant about his acting ambitions but eventually supported him when he turned eight.\n\nHenry Thomas in E.T. the Extra Terrestrial\n\nEarly career\n\nHenry Thomas embarked on his acting journey in the early 1980s. As a smart and talented child, he exuded confidence in his abilities. By 1981, he had made his big-screen debut in the film “Raggedy Man,” starring alongside Eric Roberts, Sissy Spacek, and Sam Shepard. The young actor felt at ease with these seasoned stars and left a positive impression on the crew. His performance was well-received by both audiences and critics.\n\nHenry was even nominated for the Young Artist Award for his role. That same year, he appeared in the TV movie “The Steeler and the Pittsburgh Kid” with Jim Brinson and Lonny Chapman. While this film didn’t have the same impact as “Raggedy Man,” it still highlighted his talent, attracting the attention of many directors and casting agents.\n\nHenry Thomas in The Quest\n\n“E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial” and Global Fame\n\nHenry Thomas’s acting skills caught the eye of numerous filmmakers, including the acclaimed director Steven Spielberg. By that time, Spielberg had already achieved significant success with films like “Jaws,” “Close Encounters of the Third Kind,” “1941,” and “Raiders of the Lost Ark.” Casting for his new movie, Spielberg invited Thomas to audition.\n\nReports suggest that Henry’s audition greatly impressed Spielberg, even moving him to tears. The boy had to portray sadness and convincingly drew on the memory of his deceased dog. Following this powerful audition, Henry was immediately cast in the lead role of Spielberg’s upcoming film, “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,” which premiered on May 26, 1982.\n\nUpon its release, Spielberg’s film, featuring Henry alongside Drew Barrymore, Peter Coyote, Dee Wallace-Stone, and others, became an instant hit. With a budget of $10.5 million, “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial” grossed over $663 million worldwide. The film received nominations for the Oscars, Golden Globes, and various other awards.\n\nCritics and audiences alike praised Henry Thomas’s outstanding performance. He was nominated for Best Young Actor for the second consecutive year and deservedly won the award in 1983. This role catapulted him to global fame. Additionally, one of the iconic scenes from “E.T.” was immortalized in the logo of Amblin Entertainment, a production company founded by Spielberg and his friends.\n\nHenry Jackson Thomas Jr. Movies and TV Shows\n\nDoctor Sleep\n\nThe Bartender / Jack Torrance\n\nThe Haunting of Hill House\n\nYoung Hugh Crain\n\nGerald’s Game\n\nTom\n\nOuija: Origin of Evil\n\nFather Tom Hogan\n\nDear John\n\nTim\n\n11:14\n\nJack\n\nGangs of New York\n\nJohnny Sirocco\n\nThe Mentalist\n\nTommy Lisbon\n\nLegends of the Fall\n\nSamuel Ludlow\n\nE.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\n\nElliott\n\nCareer\n\nDespite the sudden fame that came his way, Henry Thomas chose to prioritize his education.
