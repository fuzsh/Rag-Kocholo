        "text": "Henry Jackson Thomas Jr. (born September 9, 1971) is an American actor and musician. He is best known for his breakout role in Steven Spielberg's film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nThomas was born in San Antonio, Texas. His mother, Carolyn L. (née Davis), is a homemaker and his father, Henry Jackson Thomas Sr., is a hydraulic machinist. He attended East Central High School and Blinn College. Thomas married Marie Zielcke on May 10, 2004. They had a daughter, Hazel. The couple were divorced in 2007. Thomas also has two children with his current wife Annalee.\n\nCareer[]\n\nActing[]\n\nThomas struggled with the popularity he gained in the months following the release of ET.\n\nMusic[]\n\nThomas wrote songs and played guitar for the San Antonio band, The Blue Heelers (named for the breed of dog), in the 1990s. Although the band was not signed to a record label, its self-produced album Twister was warmly received and enjoyed statewide radio play. Thomas continued to write and record songs. In 1998, his song \"Truckstop Coffee\" (recorded with the Blue Heelers) appeared on V2's soundtrack for Niagara, Niagara. In 2003, Thomas and Nikki Sudden collaborated on the music for Mika Kaurismäki's film Honey Baby, which featured four original songs written and performed by Thomas as the fictional musician Tom Brackett. An album was in the works, but Sudden died unexpectedly in 2006.\n\nFilmography[]\n\nFilm Year Title Role Notes 1981 Raggedy Man Harry Film debut 1982 E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial Elliott 1984 Misunderstood Andrew 1984 Cloak & Dagger Davey Osborne 1985 Frog Dreaming Cody 1989 Valmont Raphael Danceny 1993 Fire in the Sky Greg Hayes 1994 Curse of the Starving Class Wesley Tate 1994 Legends of the Fall Samuel Ludlow 1997 Niagara, Niagara Seth 1997 Suicide Kings Avery Chasten 1997 Bombshell Buck Hogan 1999 Fever Nick Parker 2000 The House That Screamed Jack Gillton Direct-to-video 2000 A Good Baby Raymond Toker 2000 All the Pretty Horses Lacey Rawlins 2001 The Quickie Alex 2002 Dead in the Water Jeff 2002 I'm with Lucy Barry 2002 Gangs of New York Johnny Sirocco 2003 I Capture the Castle Simon Cotton 2003 11:14 Jack 2004 Dead Birds William 2006 The Hard Easy Paul Weston 2007 The Last Sin Eater Man of God 2007 Suffering Man's Charity Eric Rykell 2008 Red Velvet Aaron 2010 Dear John Tim 2011 The Last Ride Hank Williams Sr. 2013 Big Sur Philip Whalen 2016 Ouija: Origin of Evil Father Tom Hogan 2017 Gerald's Game Tom\n\nTelevision Year Title Role Notes 1990 Psycho IV: The Beginning Young Norman Bates Movie 1992 A Taste for Killing Cary Sloan Movie 1995 Indictment: The McMartin Trial Ray Buckey Movie 1996 Riders of the Purple Sage Bern Venters Movie 1998 Moby Dick Ishmael Miniseries 1999 Happy Face Murders Dylan McCarthy Movie 2005 Masters of Horror Jamie Episode: \"Chocolate\" 2006 Desperation Peter Jackson Movie 2006 Nightmares & Dreamscapes: From the Stories of Stephen King Robert Fornoy Episode: \"The End of the Whole Mess\" 2007–08 Without a Trace Franklin Romar 2 episodes 2009 CSI: Crime Scene Investigation Jeremy Kent Episode: \"If I Had a Hammer\" 2011 The Mentalist Thomas Lisbon Episode: \"Where in the World is Carmine O'Brien?\" 2013–14 Betrayal T.J.

The Extra-Terrestrial and he's a young boy who befriends E.T. He was born on February 13, 1971, in Los Angeles, California, USA.\n\nElliott's best friend is E.T.\n\nDuring Science class, Elliott's connection made him release hundreds of frogs which were going to be dissected and told the frogs to run, claiming he was saving them. (Elliott did this because E.T. was reading a comic that showed a superhero rescuing an alien.) At home, E.T. then turned on the Television and saw the movie The Quiet Man and saw the scene where Elliott hugged Casey. The psychic connection with Elliott and E.T. caused Elliott to kiss a girl in her class who he did not really like in the same manner while the rest of the kids were panicking because of the frogs, who were rapidly escaping the school.\n\nBecause he disturbed in the class, Elliott was sent to the principal's office and sent home, most likely suspended.\n\nThen Elliott came home from school not having much memory on what happened at school and he came to his room and E.T. said \"E.T. phone home\" and that was Elliot's sign saying he needs to go home.\n\nThe following day(Halloween), he rode his bike with E.T. in it to find a place to build the communicator and to get there faster E.T. made the bike fly!They also crossed the moon and as soon as Elliot saw them cross the moon, he shouted with joy!\n\nElliott and E.T. stayed in the forest the whole night. In the morning, Elliott's mother was telling the police what Elliott looked like and etc. when he came home.She was happy but Elliott had been cold. Later, Elliott tells Micheal to go find E.T. Micheal does but finds E.T. in a river,almost dead. He brings him home. Elliot and his siblings are in the bathroom when Mary (the mother) comes in and is terrified of E.T. They all rush downstairs when astronauts start invading their house like a mob of zombies. Scientists rush in and set up. E.T. and Elliott are being tested on and E.T. loses his connection with him,dying after. He isn't dead,oh no, E.T. was very much alive. He escapes with the help of Elliott, his brother, and his brother's friends,who all help escape the police and scientists.They head towards the ship. E.T and Elliot share a hug before he departs. E.T points his glowing finger at Elliot's forehead and says \"I'll be right here\". As the ship takes off, it leaves a beautiful rainbow in the sky, with everyone looking happily at it.\n\nFinding E.T.[1][]\n\nElliott found E.T. when he heard strange noises outside and finally led the alien into his room with Reese's Pieces.\n\nElliott soon befriended E.T and the next day feigned illness so he could stay home to play with E.T. Elliott found out the Alien had an expendable neck and could breathe underwater.\n\nThe next day, Elliott had to go to school. However, he unknowingly had a psychic connection to E.T. and did whatever the alien did and felt whatever the alien felt.\n\nRolesEdit[]\n\nIn The Many Adventures of Jiminy Cricket and Jiminy Cricket's Grand Adventure: The Search For Henry Thomas He played as Christopher Robin\n\nIn Floop and the Chocolate Factory (1971) and Henry Thomas and the Chocolate Factory He played as Charlie Bucket\n\nIn The Rescuers Down Under (brucesmovies1 style) He played as Cody\n\nIn Bernard and Friends He played as Derek\n\nIn Dodger (Shrek) He played as Pinocchio\n\nIn The Yellow Man in Cenntral Park He played as Gus\n\nIn Judahzan He played as Young Tarzan\n\nIn Bart Simpsonambi He played as Young Thumper\n\nIn Bedknobs and Broomsticks (brucesmovies1 style) He played as Paul\n\nIn Limpet Pan He played as Michael Darling\n\nIn Beauty and the Simpson He played as Chip (Human)\n\nPortayals[]\n\nDodger The Extra-Terrestrial He played by Bart Simpson\n\nGallery[]\n\nMain Article: Henry Thomas/Gallery"
