        "text": "Synopsis\n\n\"E.T.\" is undoubtedly a beloved film cherished by audiences of all ages since its release in 1982. Crafted by Steven Spielberg and Melissa Mathison, the story continues to captivate viewers, drawing them to screens year after year.\n\nRumors of a sequel to the beloved '80s classic \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\" titled 'The Return to Earth' have been circulating, but it's time to set the record straight. Despite claims from various media platforms, there is no such sequel in the works. This misinformation has stirred up excitement among fans, but unfortunately, it's all a hoax.\n\nOrigins of the Hoax\n\nAs per a report by Dexerto, a page on Facebook has been doing rounds with a poster of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. As per the report, the deceptive Facebook page behind the fake sequel has a history of spreading false rumors, including fake news about reboots and remakes of popular films like The Golden Girls and Cars. The announcement of 'The Return to Earth' sequel, accompanied by a fabricated poster stating the reunion of Henry Thomas and Drew Barrymore was merely another attempt to mislead eager fans.\n\nThe Reality\n\nWhile Spielberg and Melissa Mathison did contemplate a sequel titled \"E.T. II: Nocturnal Fears\" shortly after the original film's success, those plans were ultimately abandoned. Actor Henry Thomas, who portrayed Elliott in the original movie, expressed in 2022 that a feature-length sequel would not be appropriate. Thus, any claims of a new installment cannot be true.\n\nThe Only Official Sequel\n\nThe only official follow-up to \"E.T.\" is a four-minute commercial released in 2019 called \"E.T. A Holiday Reunion.\" This short film reunites Elliott, now an adult with his own family, with his extraterrestrial friend for a heartwarming holiday celebration. However, it's important to note that this is not a full-length sequel but rather a brief reunion for nostalgic purposes.\n\nWhere to Watch\n\nFor fans eager to revisit the magic of the original \"E.T.,\" there are plenty of options available. The film can be rented or purchased digitally on-demand, or physical copies can be found on platforms like Amazon in both DVD and Blu-ray formats. Additionally, for those interested in discovering new films, there are numerous recommendations for April streaming options to explore.\n\nDespite rumors and fake announcements, there are no plans for a sequel titled 'The Return to Earth.' For now, fans can enjoy the original film and cherish the memories it brings without falling prey to false speculation.\n\nFAQs:\n\nWill there be an E.T. 2 movie?\n\nAs of now, there is no release date set for ET 2. The creators of the original film are hesitant about producing a sequel, concerned that it might tarnish the legacy of the beloved cult-classic. However, rumors of a sequel to Steven Spielberg's ET gained momentum recently, fueled by a fan-made poster circulating online, sparking speculation among fans.\n\nHow did E.T. come back to life?\n\nThe theory suggests that the connection between E.T. and his people kept him alive, and when he was stranded, he lost that connection. According to this logic, when his people eventually returned and repaired the connection, it caused his heart to glow and revived him, as depicted in the ending of the E.T. movie.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nDisclaimer Statement: This content is authored by a 3rd party.
