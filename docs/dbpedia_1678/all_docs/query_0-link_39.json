        "text": "Henry Thomas, former child star of “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial” fame, was arrested Monday in Oregon for a DUI.\n\nAccording to Tualatin police, authorities found Thomas passed out behind the wheel of his car after they responded to a call from a concerned passerby about a suspicious vehicle. The Tualatin PD told The Times Tuesday that Thomas’ vehicle was not moving and had apparently sat idle through multiple light cycles at an intersection.\n\nAfter finding Thomas on the scene, Tualatin police took him into custody on suspicion of a driving under the influence of intoxicants. According to the Washington County Sheriff’s Office, Thomas was admitted to the Washington County Jail at 1:48 a.m. and released at 9:37 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nHis court date is scheduled for Nov. 1 at 8:30 a.m. A representative for Thomas declined The Times’ request for comment Tuesday.\n\nAfter his star-making turn as the alien-loving Elliott in Steven Spielberg’s “E.T.,” Thomas has gone on to appear in several films and TV shows, including “11:14,” “Legends of the Fall,” “Cloak & Dagger” and, most recently, Netflix’s horror anthology series “The Haunting of Hill House.”\n\nHe’s set to star next in the upcoming thriller “Dreamkatcher,” which is in postproduction and scheduled for release in January. He also will play superhero doctor Charles McNider in DC Comics’ “Stargirl,” which is currently filming, according to IMDb."
