        "text": "American actress and model (born 1979)\n\nRachael Leigh Cook (born October 4, 1979[1]) is an American actress and model. She has starred in the films The Baby-Sitters Club (1995), She's All That (1999), and Josie and the Pussycats (2001), and in the television series Into the West and Perception. She is also the voice behind various characters in Robot Chicken and Tifa Lockhart in the Final Fantasy series, starting with the English version of the film Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. Since 2016, her television appearances have primarily been made-for-TV movies on the Hallmark Channel.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nRachael Leigh Cook was born on October 4, 1979,[1] in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the daughter of Thomas Howard Cook, a social worker and former stand-up comedian, and JoAnn, a cooking instructor and weaver.[2] She is of part English and Italian descent. Cook first appeared in a public service announcement for foster care at seven years of age and began working as a child print model at the age of 10, including nationwide advertisements for Target and appearing on the boxes of Milk-Bone dog biscuits. She attended Clara Barton Open School, Laurel Springs School, and Minneapolis South High School.[citation needed]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nCook began auditioning for acting work at age 14.[2] She made her screen debut as an actress in the 1995 film The Baby-Sitters Club. She also played a role in the adventure film Tom and Huck, released in December 1995. In 1996, her modeling agency sent her to star in a short film, 26 Summer Street. In 1997, Cook appeared in a leading role in the film Country Justice as a 15-year-old rape victim who is impregnated by her rapist.\n\nIn 1999, Cook starred in her breakout role in the sleeper hit[dubious – discuss] film She's All That,[3] a romantic comedy that so far is the most financially successful film of her career. In 2000, she starred opposite Elijah Wood in the well-received The Bumblebee Flies Anyway. She took the lead role in 2001's Josie and the Pussycats, which turned out to be a box office failure, although it has since become a cult classic.[4]\n\nIn 2000, she was the cover girl for the U.S. March/April issue of FHM. She also starred in the music video for New Found Glory's 2000 single \"Dressed to Kill\".[5] In 2002, she was ranked No. 26 in Stuff magazine's \"102 Sexiest Women in the World\". In 2003, she starred in the film 11:14 as Cheri. She also appeared as a main cast member in the 2005 television miniseries Into the West produced by Steven Spielberg. In 2006, she appeared in the music video for Daniel Powter's \"Love You Lately\".\n\nIn 2007, Cook was seen in the big screen adaptation of Nancy Drew. She played the female lead in the independent sports drama The Final Season. She has appeared in numerous episodes of the Seth Green comedies Titan Maximum and Robot Chicken. In 2008, she guest-starred as Abigail Lytar in two third-season episodes of the USA Network series Psych. She reprised the role in the following season.\n\nIn February 2010, Cook signed on to play the female lead role in Fox TV's comedy pilot Nirvana.[6] She had a role in the Western horror film Vampire, the English-language feature debut of Japanese director Iwai Shunji.[7] In 2012, Cook signed on to play the female lead role in the TNT crime drama series Perception opposite Eric McCormack. She starred in the independent film Broken Kingdom, which was directed by her husband Daniel Gillies. She also appeared in a Funny or Die sketch with Chad Michael Murray.[8][9]\n\nCook starred in the Hallmark Channel original film Summer Love in 2016.[10] In the same year, she starred in another Hallmark film, Autumn In the Vineyard, followed by its sequel Summer in the Vineyard in 2017.[11] 2017 also saw Cook develop, star and executive produce the Hallmark Channel film Frozen in Love, which was broadcast in January 2018 as part of the channel's 'Winterfest' season of programming.[12][13]\n\nCook provided the voice for Chelsea Cunningham on the Kids' WB animated series Batman Beyond and in the animated film Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker. Cook voiced Tifa Lockhart in the video games Kingdom Hearts II, Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII and Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy, as well as the film Final Fantasy VII Advent Children. In 2011, she voiced the character of Jaesa Willsaam in the MMO game, Star Wars: The Old Republic. Cook's latest voice-over role is for the video game Yakuza in which she voices the role of Reina. In 2020 Cook appeared in the fifteenth season of Criminal Minds playing the role of Max in the final episodes of the series.[14]\n\nCook owns her own production company, Ben's Sister Productions (in reference to her younger brother Ben Cook). She produced and starred in the film Love, Guaranteed, which debuted on Netflix on September 3, 2020.[15]\n\nPublic service\n\n[edit]\n\nCook first gained national attention in 1997, when she was featured in an updated This Is Your Brain on Drugs public service announcement (PSA) television advertisement, in which she proceeds to destroy a kitchen with a frying pan.[16]\n\nIn 2011, she was selected by the Obama administration as a Champion of Change for Arts Education.[17]\n\nIn June 2012, she began to award a small scholarship to students between ages 14 and 19. The scholarship helps pay for career classes, mentoring programs, and other school fees.[2]\n\nIn 2017, Rachael Leigh Cook reprised her \"This Is Your Brain on Drugs\" role twenty years later for a PSA by the Drug Policy Alliance critiquing the War on Drugs and its contribution to mass incarceration, structural racism and poverty. The ad was posted to YouTube on April 20, 2017, in recognition of 4/20.[16]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nCook married New Zealand-Canadian actor Daniel Gillies on August 8, 2004,[18] whom she had dated since 2001.[19] They have two children: a daughter born in September 2013[20] and a son born in April 2015.[21] The couple separated in June 2019 and divorced in 2021.[22][23][24]\n\nCook is a vegetarian.[25]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1995 Mary Anne Spier 1995 Tom and Huck Becky Thatcher 1996 Carpool Kayla 1997 Young 'Jackie-O' 1997 Country Justice Emma Baker 1997 The Eighteenth Angel Lucy Stanton 1998 All I Wanna Do Abigail 'Abby' Sawyer 1998 Dolores 1998 Living Out Loud Teenage Judith Moore 1999 Vera Johnson 1999 She's All That Laney Boggs 1999 Cassie 2000 Sally Beth 2000 Get Carter Doreen Carter 2000 Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker Chelsea Cunningham Voice; direct-to-video[26] 2001 Antitrust Lisa Calighan 2001 Blow Dry Christina Robertson 2001 Texas Rangers Caroline Dukes 2001 Josie and the Pussycats Josie McCoy 2001 Tangled Jenny Kelley 2002 29 Palms The Waitress 2003 Bookies Hunter 2003 Scorched Shmally 2003 Ruthie 2003 11:14 Cheri 2003 Tempo Jenny Travile 2004 Stateside Dori Lawrence 2004 American Crime Jesse St. Claire Direct-to-video 2005 Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children Tifa Lockhart Voice[26] 2006 My First Wedding Vanessa Direct-to-video 2007 Descent Allison Direct-to-video 2007 All Hat Chrissie Nugent Direct-to-video 2007 Nancy Drew Jane Brighton 2007 Polly Hudson 2007 Blonde Ambition Haley 2009 Amanda Manning Direct-to-video 2009 Bob Funk Ms. Thorne Direct-to-video 2009 Falling Up Caitlin O'Shea Direct-to-video 2011 Vampire Laura King Direct-to-video 2011 The Family Tree Rachel Levy Direct-to-video 2012 Broken Kingdom Marilyn Direct-to-video 2014 Red Sky Karen Brooks Direct-to-video 2017 Hermia 2020 Love, Guaranteed Susan Also producer 2021 He's All That Anna Sawyer 2022 Spirit Halloween: The Movie Sue 2023 A Tourist's Guide to Love Amanda Riley Also producer\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1997 True Women Young Georgia Lawshe Miniseries 1997 Tracey Lane TV movie 1998 Cassie Boussard Episode: \"Glyphic\" 1999 Dawson's Creek Devon 3 episodes 2000 Batman Beyond Chelsea Cunningham 2 episodes; voice role 2004 Fearless Gaia Moore Unsold pilot 2005 Into the West Clara Wheeler Miniseries 2005 Las Vegas Penny Posin Recurring role 2005 I Love the '80s 3-D Herself TV documentary; 2 episodes 2006–2019 Robot Chicken various Recurring voice roles 2008 Ghost Whisperer Grace Adams Episode: \"Big Chills\" 2008–2010 Psych Abigail Lytar Recurring role 2009 Titan Maximum Lt.
