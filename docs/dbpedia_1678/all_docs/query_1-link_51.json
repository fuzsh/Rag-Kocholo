Applications are now open for students entering 9th -12th grade in September 2017. Created as a follow-up experience to our Science of Smart Cities program, ieSoSC is an opportunity that offers 5 weeks of intensive STEM instruction and mentoring on the NYU Tandon School of Engineering’s Downtown Brooklyn campus in technology and engineering skills, design and prototyping, built around real world ‘smart city’ applications and research.\n\nPrimarily (but not exclusively) intended for students that previously completed Science of Smart Cities, ieSoSC will show through hands-on projects, instruction and activities how to take coding/computer science, engineering and technology skills to another level by applying those skills to advanced smart cities ideas. Participants will work with our graduate and undergraduate student-experts in increasingly sophisticated hands-on programming and engineering projects.\n\nThe program incorporates time devoted to concepts and processes related to entrepreneurship and design thinking. During the second half of the program, participants will form 4-person teams and apply their new skills and knowledge in engineering, technology and entrepreneurship to ideate, research/document, prototype and present a device(s)/app that use sensors; programming; data collection, analysis and reporting; and, wireless communication technologies and protocols, in an ‘internet of things’ approach to a “smart cities design challenge” that creates a product that could be used by municipal agencies, the general public, businesses and/or other user groups.\n\nDuring the design challenge phase, high school participants will work in their teams with our graduate and undergraduate student-instructors. These instructors will assist with all aspects of the work, helping to resolve technical challenges, providing input and feedback, and otherwise coaching and mentoring participants through the prototyping and presentation processes. Each team will have a small budget for materials and equipment, and participants will receive public presentation training using improvisation techniques through a partnership with Irondale Theater.\n\nThe program culminates for each team in a public presentation at which engineers, urban planners, business people and other smart cities experts hear from participants about their idea, prototype, and how it is intended to be applied to solve a real world problem or challenge.\n\nProgram runs full days (approximately 10am to 5pm), five days a week\n\nOur campus is located at 6 MetroTech Center in Downtown Brooklyn\n\nieSoSC is free to attend, thanks to support from National Grid\n\nLunch, snacks are not provided.
