During the summers, he and his Yale classmates stayed in New Haven and opened a summer stock theater called the \"New Haven Free Theater.\"[1] They performed various plays including Woyzeck,[1] and Just Add Water (improv night).[1] He also performed in the political piece The American Pig at the Joseph Papp Public Theater for the New York Shakespeare Festival in New York City, along with classmates James Keach, James Naughton, and Jill Eikenberry.[1]\n\nAfter graduation, he joined the Yale Repertory Theatre company.[1][2] During the 1970-71 season, Winkler appeared in Story Theater Reportory (October 1970)[3] as the Rabbi in Gimpel the Fool[3] (and also appeared in Saint Julian the Hospitaler and Olympian Games).[3] He also appeared as the youngest son in The Revenger's Tragedy (Nov-December, 1970),[3] Tommy's nephew in Where Has Tommy Flowers Gone? (January 1971),[3] Young Siward in Macbeth (Feb-March 1971),[3] Andres in Woyzeck and Play (April 1971),[3] and Master of Ceremonies/Prow/Couple 2/Horses/Milliner in Two by Brecht and Weill: The Little Mahagonny and The Seven Deadly Sins (May–June, 1971[3] and January 20–29, 1972.[4]\n\nWinkler then moved back to New York, working in theater, television commercials, and the independent film The Lords of Flatbush (1974), with then unknown Sylvester Stallone. After a short period in Los Angeles, he won the role of Arthur \"Fonzie\" Fonzarelli (on the 1974-1984 American television series Happy Days). He also portrayed Jack Dunne in Heroes (1977), Andy in the Carl Reiner film The One and Only (1978), and Chuck Lumley in Ron Howard's Night Shift (1982). In addition, he gained recognition as an executive producer for works such as MacGyver, Dead Man's Gun, the CBS Schoolbreak Special: \"All the Kids Do It\", Hollywood Squares, and Who Are the DeBolts? And Where Did They Get Nineteen Kids?\n\nWinkler has evolved into a character actor,[5] portraying roles such as the high school principal Arthur Himbry in Scream, Coach Klein in Adam Sandler's The Waterboy, Barry Zuckerkorn in Arrested Development, Sy Mittleman in Childrens Hospital, Dr. Saperstein in Parks and Recreation, Mr. Rock in the Hank Zipzer BBC series, Eddie R. Lawson in Royal Pains, Fritz in Monsters at Work, Uncle Joe in The French Dispatch, Al Pratt (Uncle Al) in Black Adam, and Gene Cousineau in Barry. He also appears in five Christmas films: An American Christmas Carol as Benedict Slade (1979), Katharine Hepburn's last film One Christmas as Dad (1994), The Most Wonderful Time of the Year as Uncle Ralph (2008), Mr. Rock in Hank Zipzer's Christmas Catastrophe (2016), and Grandpa Bill in All I Want For Christmas is You (2017).
