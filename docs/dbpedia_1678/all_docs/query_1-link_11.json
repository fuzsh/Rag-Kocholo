        "text": "The Death of Mr Lazarescu\n\n(150 mins, 15)\n\nDirected by Cristi Puiu; starring Ion Fiscuteanu, Luminita Gheorghiu\n\nAtomised\n\n(109 mins, 15)\n\nDirected by Oskar Roehler; starring Moritz Bleibtreu, Christian Ulmen, Martina Gedeck, Franka Potente, Nina Hoss\n\nEllie Parker\n\n(95 mins, 15)\n\nDirected by Scott Coffey; starring Naomi Watts, Scott Coffey, Chevy Chase, Rebecca Rigg\n\n11:14\n\n(86 mins, 15)\n\nDirected by Greg Marcks; starring Henry Thomas, Hilary Swank, Patrick Swayze, Barbara Hershey\n\nTaxi Driver\n\n(113 mins, 18)\n\nDirected by Martin Scorsese; starring Robert De Niro, Cybill Shepherd, Jodie Foster, Harvey Keitel, Albert Brooks\n\nOne of the most harrowing and wholly convincing movies I've seen for several years, Cristi Puiu's The Death of Mr Lazarescu, tells a story that could take place in any country in the world today boasting something by way of a health service. It happens, however, to be set in Bucharest, capital of Romania, where the eponymous 62-year-old widower is insulted, injured, patronised and generally ill-treated during the last eight or nine hours of his life from mid-evening to dawn the next day. He leads a lonely life in a squalid apartment with three cats, drinks dangerous hooch and eats badly. His wife died of cancer 10 years previously, his daughter has moved to Canada and largely communicates with him through his sister, whom he rarely sees. No one cares for him apart from his surly next-door neighbours, and they don't really like him much.\n\nIt's a claustrophobic movie that only gets out of doors when the terminally ill Lazarescu is transported from one hospital to another (four in all) on a night when an ill-equipped, understaffed health service has been stretched beyond endurance by a major traffic accident. He has pains in his head and stomach and vomits regularly. As the night goes on his condition worsens and he becomes increasingly incoherent. Overworked doctors and nurses lecture him about his drinking, making him feel guilty for his condition, and they pass him on from one department to another. Only a middle-aged nurse from the ambulance that originally picked him up has any compassion, in consequence of which she receives abuse and reprimands from doctors and senior nurses. Lazarescu has spent his whole life under a variety of repressive, irresponsible regimes of the right and the left that have consistently ignored the common people and he's ended up a piece of meat on an inhumane conveyor belt. And they ask him: why do you drink?\n\nThe acting is movie naturalism at its best. Ion Fiscuteanu as Lazarescu is magnificent, as is Luminita Gheorghiu as the nurse who gives the audience some hope for humanity. This is a film to see and experience, and it justifies its 150 minutes running time.\n\nBased on Michel Houellebecq's novel Les Particules El√©mentaires, Oskar Roehler's Atomised (aka Elementarteilchen) is a watchable tale about half-brothers born in Germany in the 1960s to a neglectful hippy mother who grow up with different grandparents. Bruno becomes a plump, shy, introspective scientist, a molecular biologist of international repute, but still a virgin in his thirties. The handsome Michael, a high-school literature teacher, lives in a world of sexual fantasy that undermines his real relationships with women. Then Bruno meets up with the childhood sweetheart who still loves him, and Michael finds a woman to share his fantasies. Happiness beckons, but in a darkly comic way things go wrong. Roehler and Houellebecq are clearly attempting to make some larger statement about life and discontent in the western world due to scientific advancement and loss of religious belief. Little of this comes across in the movie.\n\nDeveloped from a short movie that was well received at the Sundance Festival five years ago, Scott Coffey's low-budget Ellie Parker is a wry account of the terrible life of a young Australian actress struggling to make her way in Hollywood. Played by the film's co-producer, Naomi Watts (who became a star while this film was being made), Ellie rushes from audition to audition, practising her lines and changing her clothes as she drives. She has a lousy agent, a cheating boyfriend, a competitive girlfriend, and a big, vulnerable heart. The movie begins with Ellie filming a death scene underneath the 'Hollywood' sign (reminding us of Dory Previn's song 'Mary C. Brown and the Hollywood Sign'), and at one point Ellie drives past a cinema showing a double-bill of the movie versions of Joan Didion's Play it As it Lays and Nathanael West's The Day of the Locust, two classic novels about the tragic underside of the Hollywood experience. This is the distinguished company Coffey and Watts want to keep. They don't quite belong there, but it's an honest, frequently very funny meander down Sunset.\n\nGreg Marcks's 11:14 is also a low-budget movie co-produced by one of its stars (Hilary Swank) and is a poor example of that genre of thrillers (like Crash and 21 Grams) that appear to be telling a variety of different stories, which all turn out to be connected. In this case a car crash, an accidental death, a faked robbery, a financial scam and a man having his penis shot off around 11.15pm one night in a small American town. It's all less interesting than it sounds."
