        "text": "Preview:\n\nAl Pacino and Jessica Chastain will lead the cast of ‘Lear, Rex’.\n\nBernard Rose adapted the play for the new movie and will direct.\n\nRachel Brosnahan, LaKeith Stanfield and Peter Dinklage are also all among a starry cast.\n\nAl Pacino just can’t stay away from the Bard. The actor, who has appeared in several Shakespeare adaptations (and one or two movies inspired by his work), will once more tackle the legendary playwright’s work with a new interpretation of ‘King Lear’.\n\nAnd he’ll be joined in what is called ‘Lear, Rex’ (“Rex” meaning “king”, “monarch” or “ruler” in Latin, language fans!) by occasional co-star Jessica Chastain and a host of famous faces.\n\nWhat’s the story of ‘Lear Rex’?\n\nFrom the sounds of it, writer/director Bernard Rose is sticking relatively close to the story as laid out by the play… Pacino will be an aging King who divides his land between his three daughters to prevent future conflict.\n\nBut he rejects the youngest daughter, Cordelia who loves him and places his trust in her malevolent sisters, who strip him of his power and condemn him to a wretched wasteland of horror and insanity. Tch… you kids today, with your lust for power and your overthrowing of the monarchy!\n\nRelated Article: Al Pacino and Dan Stevens to Play Priests in New Horror Movie ‘The Ritual’\n\nWho else is in ‘Lear Rex’?\n\nAlongside Pacino and Chastain (who plays Goneril, one of the older daughters who plot against their naive old dad), the already impressive cast for this one also includes Ariana DeBose as Cordelia (the youngest daughter), Rachel Brosnahan as Regan (Goneril’s scheme-happy sister), Peter Dinklage as the Fool, Danny Huston as Albany, Chris Messina as Cornwall, LaKeith Stanfield as Edmund, Ted Levine as Kent, Matthew Jacobs as Gloucester, Rhys Coiro as Oswald and Stephen Dorff as Poor Tom.\n\nBarry Navidi is reuniting with Pacino to produce the new film, having worked on several movies with the star (including ‘Salomé’ and ‘Wilde Salomé’, which also starred Chastain.)\n\n‘Lear Rex’: the director and producer speak\n\nHere’s what Bernard Rose said about the movie in a statement to Deadline:\n\n“It is enormously exciting to get the opportunity to work with this extraordinary cast that Al, Barry and Sharon [casting director Sharon Howard-Field] have put together to tackle this radical, but accessible adaptation of Shakespeare’s greatest play.”\n\nAnd here’s what producer Navidi had to say:\n\n“I am delighted to have the opportunity to collaborate with Bernard Rose. His artistic vision, combined with a talented ensemble cast of players led by Al Pacino, promises to take us on a remarkable and unforgettable cinematic experience. We are merging the worlds of Shakespeare and Hollywood. This marks the commencement of an exciting new chapter, one that Al has poured his heart and soul into. It is a privilege for me to join forces with my dear friend once more, and to contribute to his enduring legacy.”\n\nWhen will ‘Lear Rex’ be in theaters?\n\nWith the distribution rights yet to be sold, there is no current release date for ‘Lear Rex’. The cameras are set to start rolling on August 12th and we can’t imagine such a star-studded film –– even a Shakespeare adaptation with its occasional cultural language barrier –– sitting in the marketplace for too long.\n\nOther Movies Based On William Shakespeare's Work:\n\n'West Side Story' (1961)\n\n'Romeo and Juliet' (1968)\n\n'Hamlet' (1991)\n\n'Much Ado About Nothing' (1993)\n\n'Othello' (1995)\n\n'Richard III' (1995)\n\n'Hamlet' (1996)\n\n'10 Things I Hate About You' (1999)\n\n'A Midsummer Night's Dream' (1999)\n\n'Coriolanus' (2012)\n\n'Warm Bodies' (2013)\n\n'King Lear' (2018)\n\n'West Side Story' (2021)\n\n'The Tragedy of Macbeth' (2021)"
