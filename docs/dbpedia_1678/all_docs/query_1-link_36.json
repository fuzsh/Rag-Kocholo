        "text": "The Struggle for Suffrage\n\nToday marks the anniversary of the Nineteenth Amendment becoming enshrined in the U.S. Constitution. The amendment, which granted women the right to vote, was first proposed in 1878 and reintroduced in every U.S. Congress thereafter. The amendment finally passed Congress in June 1919—after decades of tireless efforts by suffragists—and was added to the Constitution on August 26, 1920.\n\nHealth News\n\nA global health emergency has emerged in central Africa, and a new COVID-19 vaccine rolls out ahead of flu season.\n\nThe mpox crisis\n\nThe mpox crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has been declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organization following the spread of the disease to nearby previously unaffected African countries. Mpox is caused by the monkeypox virus, a member of the same virus family that causes smallpox and cowpox. A new strain of the virus began to spread rapidly earlier this year in the DRC, which reported approximately 14,000 cases and 511 deaths as of mid-August.\n\nA longer mosquito season\n\nMosquito season is growing longer in much of the contiguous United States as global warming results in an extended summer, according to an analysis of weather patterns from 1979 to 2022 by nonprofit organization Climate Central. That trend represents a growing public-health concern as the pests can transmit diseases such as malaria and the West Nile and Zika viruses. (And while we're at it, why do mosquito bites itch so much?)\n\nUpdated COVID-19 vaccine\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved an updated version of the COVID-19 vaccine on Thursday, allowing manufacturers Pfizer and Moderna to immediately begin distributing the doses. With new strains of the virus taking hold and flu season lurking just around the corner, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is urging everyone 6 months and older to receive the updated shot.\n\nCopyright E.R. Degginger/Bruce Coleman Inc.\n\nBritannica Money\n\nDiscover all you need to know about retirement, investing, and household finance, without the jargon or agenda.
