        "text": "American actor\n\nFor other people named Henry Thomas, see Henry Thomas (disambiguation).\n\nHenry Jackson Thomas[1] (born September 9, 1971)[2] is an American actor. He began his career as a child actor and had the lead role of Elliott Taylor in the film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), for which he won a Young Artist Award and received a Golden Globe Award, a BAFTA Award, and Saturn Award nominations. Thomas also had roles in other films, including Cloak & Dagger (1984), Fire in the Sky (1993), Legends of the Fall (1994), Suicide Kings (1997), All the Pretty Horses (2000), Gangs of New York (2002), 11:14 (2003), and Dear John (2010). Thomas was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film for his role in the television film Indictment: The McMartin Trial (1997).\n\nMore recently, Thomas collaborated with filmmaker Mike Flanagan, appearing in the films Ouija: Origin of Evil (2016), Gerald's Game (2017) and Doctor Sleep (2019) as well as the television series The Haunting of Hill House (2018) (which earned him a Saturn Award) and its follow-up series The Haunting of Bly Manor (2020). In 2021, he had a main role in Flanagan's horror series Midnight Mass, and, in 2023, he starred as one of the Usher siblings in The Fall of the House of Usher (2023), also by Flanagan.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nThomas was born in San Antonio, Texas.[1] He attended East Central High School and Blinn College.[1][3]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nActing\n\n[edit]\n\nThomas struggled with the popularity he gained in the months following the release of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.[4] In November 2019, Thomas reprised his role as Elliott for an Xfinity & Sky UK commercial, in which E.T. returns to visit a now-adult Elliott and his family for the holidays.[5]\n\nSince 2016, Thomas has worked frequently with filmmaker Mike Flanagan, appearing in his films Ouija: Origin of Evil, Gerald's Game and Doctor Sleep, as well as in the Netflix horror series The Haunting of Hill House, which Flanagan created and directed. Thomas also has a role in Flanagan's follow up to The Haunting of Hill House, The Haunting of Bly Manor, and Flanagan's mini-series Midnight Mass.\n\nThomas worked in Stargirl portraying Doctor Mid-Nite and voicing his A.I. counterpart \"Chuck\" until the latter role was recast with Alex Collins in season two.\n\nMusic\n\n[edit]\n\nThomas wrote songs and played guitar for a San Antonio band, The Blue Heelers (named for the breed of dog), in the 1990s. Although the band was not signed to a record label, it self-produced an album, Twister. Thomas continued to write and record songs. In 1998, his song \"Truckstop Coffee\" (recorded with the Blue Heelers) appeared on V2's soundtrack for Niagara, Niagara.[6] In 2003, Thomas and Nikki Sudden collaborated on the music for Mika Kaurismäki's film Honey Baby, which featured four original songs written and performed by Thomas as the fictional musician Tom Brackett.[7] An album was in the works, but Sudden died unexpectedly in 2006.[8]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nThomas married actress Marie Zielcke on May 10, 2004. They had a daughter, Hazel. The couple were divorced in 2007. Thomas also has two children with his current wife Annalee,[9][4] and in 2014 moved to Wilsonville, Oregon.\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1981 Raggedy Man Harry 1982 E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial Elliott 1984 Misunderstood Andrew 1984 Cloak & Dagger Davey Osborne 1985 Frog Dreaming Cody 1988 Murder One Billy Isaacs 1989 Valmont Raphael Danceny 1993 Fire in the Sky Greg Hayes 1994 Curse of the Starving Class Wesley Tate 1994 Legends of the Fall Samuel Ludlow 1997 Niagara, Niagara Seth 1997 Suicide Kings Avery Chasten 1997 Bombshell Buck Hogan 1999 Fever Nick Parker 2000 The House That Screamed Jack Gillton Direct-to-video 2000 A Good Baby Raymond Toker 2000 All the Pretty Horses Lacey Rawlins 2001 The Quickie Alex 2002 Dead in the Water Jeff 2002 I'm with Lucy Barry 2002 Gangs of New York Johnny Sirocco 2003 I Capture the Castle Simon Cotton 2003 11:14 Jack 2003 Honey Baby Tom Brackett 2003 Briar Patch Edgar MacBeth 2004 Dead Birds William 2006 The Hard Easy Paul Weston 2007 The Last Sin Eater Man of God 2007 Suffering Man's Charity Eric Rykell 2008 Red Velvet Aaron 2010 Dear John Tim 2011 The Last Ride Hank Williams Sr. 2013 Big Sur Philip Whalen 2016 Ouija: Origin of Evil Father Tom Hogan 2017 Gerald's Game Tom Burlingame 2019 The Great Alaskan Race Thompson 2019 Doctor Sleep The Bartender / Jack Torrance 2019 A Holiday Reunion Elliott Short film 2021 To All the Boys: Always and Forever Mr. Kavinski 2022 Sam & Kate Ron 2022 Crawlspace Robert Mitchell 2023 Pet Sematary: Bloodlines Dan Crandall\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1990 Psycho IV: The Beginning Young Norman Bates Television film 1992 A Taste for Killing Cary Sloan Television film 1995 Indictment: The McMartin Trial Ray Buckey Television film 1996 Riders of the Purple Sage Bern Venters Television film 1998 Moby Dick Ishmael Miniseries 1999 Happy Face Murders Dylan McCarthy Television film 2005 Masters of Horror Jamie Episode: \"Chocolate\" 2006 Stephen King's Desperation Peter Jackson Television film 2006 Nightmares & Dreamscapes: From the Stories of Stephen King Robert Fornoy Episode: \"The End of the Whole Mess\" 2007–08 Without a Trace Franklin Romar 2 episodes 2009 CSI: Crime Scene Investigation Jeremy Kent Episode: \"If I Had a Hammer\" 2011 The Mentalist Thomas Lisbon Episode: \"Where in the World is Carmine O'Brien?\" 2013–14 Betrayal T.J.
