        "text": "Henry Diltz may not be the only person who can say he was at both West Point and Woodstock, but he’s the only one who has also taken pictures of Neil Young playing with nocturnal primates.\n\nOne Friday afternoon in August, after more than eight decades of wild and improbable life, Diltz was on the phone in his kitchen in North Hollywood, Calif., making arrangements to shoot some musician friends: the ’70s soft-rockers America, who were playing the following night.\n\nDiltz was not the first of the great rock ’n’ roll photographers. Ask him and he’ll name professional forebears like Jim Marshall, who also made defining images of the rock era — Hendrix letting a chord ring, Dylan kicking a tire, Johnny Cash flipping the bird.\n\nDiltz is compactly built, with a gray ponytail, a ringer in old age for the actor Seymour Cassel, a John Cassavetes mainstay. He falls asleep at night listening to George Noory on “Coast to Coast AM” rapping with the paranoid faithful about lucid dreams, conspiracies, immortality. In the morning he does a series of chakra-awakening exercises and takes a few moments to say hello, in his head, to some of the people he’s known who’ve gone to the other side.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
