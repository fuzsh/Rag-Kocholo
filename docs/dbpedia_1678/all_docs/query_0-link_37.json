        "text": "With a sweeping score from John Williams and bikes that could fly — thanks to a pumpkin-headed alien who just wanted to \"phone home\" — Steven Spielberg's E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial was an instant box office success upon its 1982 release, surpassing Star Wars to hold the top spot as the highest grossing movie for over a decade.\n\nThe film centers around a lost alien and a 10-year-old boy, Elliott (Henry Thomas), who takes him in. As authorities try to track and capture the extra-terrestrial interloper, the newfound friends form a symbiotic connection, with their well-being hinged on each other. Love and friendship ultimately save the day while audiences around the world were left in tears.\n\nElliott is a middle sibling, and his older brother has a friend group, which meant the cast was comprised of young actors such as Drew Barrymore, who have since stayed in the public eye or purposefully walked away from it (K.C. Martel), as well as adults with extensive careers still ahead of them (Peter Coyote).\n\nSee what the cast of E.T. has been up to since the supernatural movie premiered.\n\n01 of 07\n\nDrew Barrymore as Gertie\n\nOnly 7 years old at the time of filming, E.T. catapulted a young Barrymore — a.k.a. Gertie — to superstardom. Following the release, Barrymore began a fruitful career in Hollywood, starting with 1984's Firestarter. Barrymore also starred in Poison Ivy (1992), The Wedding Singer (1998), Ever After: A Cinderella Story (1998), Never Been Kissed (1999), Charlie's Angels (2000), Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle (2003), 50 First Dates (2004) and Music and Lyrics (2007).\n\nHer performance in the 2009 HBO biographical film Grey Gardens earned her an Emmy nomination and a Golden Globe win for best actress. That same year Barrymore made her directorial debut in the sports dramedy Whip It.\n\nBarrymore launched her own daytime talk show, The Drew Barrymore Show, in September 2020 on CBS. In January 2023, the network announced its renewal through 2024, as reported by Variety.\n\nAlthough the star took a hiatus from acting in 2021, she remains hard at work in other professional endeavors. Later that year, Barrymore released her first cookbook Rebel Homemaker alongside chef Pilar Valdes and a new lifestyle magazine called Drew Magazine. She's continued to expand her lifestyle brand, launching Flower Beauty and Flower Home and furthering her partnership with Walmart for her Beautiful cookware line.\n\nBarrymore has two daughters, Olive and Frankie, whom she shares with ex-husband Will Kopelman. The pair finalized their divorce in August 2016 after four years of marriage. Though she hasn't publicly revealed any names, Barrymore told Whoopi Goldberg in December 2022 that she's dating again.\n\n02 of 07\n\nHenry Thomas as Elliott\n\nThomas was just 10 years old when he took on the lead role of Elliott, for which he earned a Golden Globe nomination. E.T. was his third film. The movie's success sparked a lengthy career on the big screen, including Legends of the Fall (1994), Gangs of New York (2002), 11:14 (2003), Dear John (2010), To All the Boys: Always and Forever (2021) and Crawlspace (2002). Thomas earned another Golden Globe nomination in 1996 for his role in the 1995 HBO film Indictment: The McMartin Trial.\n\nHe has also appeared on series such as Betrayal, The Haunting of Hill House, Stargirl, The Haunting of Bly Manor and Midnight Mass. In the 1990s and early 2000s, Thomas played in many unsigned bands and independently released several albums.\n\nThomas was also arrested in Oregon in October 2019 on suspicion of DUI. He was booked for misdemeanor driving under the influence of intoxicants. Thomas was reportedly asleep at the wheel, forcing the Tualatin Police Department to wake him up, according to TMZ at the time.\n\nThe actor has three children: daughter Hazel from his previous marriage to Marie Zielcke and two kids with his wife Annalee Fery, whom he wed in 2009.\n\n03 of 07\n\nC. Thomas Howell as Tyler\n\nLike several of his costars, then 13-year-old C. Thomas Howell got his start in E.T. and went on to star in The Outsiders (1983) and Gettysburg (1993), as well as on shows like The Walking Dead and Criminal Minds.\n\nHowell has also appeared in a few superhero movies, including The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) and Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox (2013).\n\nThe actor has three children, Dashiell, Isabelle and Liam, with his ex-wife, Sylvie Anderson.\n\n04 of 07\n\nK.C. Martel as Greg\n\nK.C. Martel already had several television credits before joining E.T. in the role of Greg. After the film's release, the actor continued his work on the small screen, most notably on Growing Pains, his final Hollywood project.\n\nMartel has since retired from acting and now works in wealth management. The former actor is married with two children.\n\n05 of 07\n\nRobert MacNaughton as Michael\n\nIn E.T., Robert MacNaughton starred as Elliott and Gertie's big brother Michael. MacNaughton also formed a close bond with costar Thomas, revealing to Yahoo Movies in 2017 how he and Thomas would play Dungeons & Dragons on set. Spielberg, he recalled, asked to join them.\n\nAlthough MacNaughton seemingly retired from acting in the late 1980s, he appeared in 2015's Frankenstein vs. The Mummy and Laugh Killer Laugh, costarring wife Bianca Hunter. The couple has a son named Noah.\n\n06 of 07\n\nPeter Coyote as Keys\n\nPeter Coyote found his first mainstream role as Keys in E.T. and has since become an award-winning household name. Some of Coyote's notable film credits include Jagged Edge (1985), Patch Adams (1998), Femme Fatale (2002) and A Walk to Remember (2002). He has been nominated two times for an Emmy, winning in 2015 for narrating an episode of the Ken Burns' documentary The Roosevelts: An Intimate History. The actor is known for his other voice work at the Academy Awards and Olympic Winter Games.\n\nCoyote is a lifelong political activist and has worked to promote countercultural ideals and anti-consumerism. He has two children from previous relationships.\n\n07 of 07\n\nDee Wallace as Mary\n\nDee Wallace already had a busy career on TV before joining the cast of E.T., where she played Gertie and Elliott's mother, Mary. After the film's release, she starred in the horror films Cujo (1983) and The Frighteners (1996). She also appeared on The New Lassie, Sons & Daughters, General Hospital and Just Add Magic, among dozens of other projects.\n\nWallace has authored several self-help books and delivered a TED talk in 2019.\n\nShe has one daughter, Gabriel, with her late husband, Christopher Stone."
