Thinking he killed whoever it is, Jack tries to hide the body. From there, we backtrack to follow the chain of events of five different characters and five different storylines that all converge on Jack's accident at 11:14pm. \"...a dark, comic romp that takes advantage of every single thing you see...\" W A Powell, The Gate. With Rachael Leigh Cook, Barbara Hershey, Patrick Swayze and Hilary Swank."
