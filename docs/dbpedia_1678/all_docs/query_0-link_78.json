        "text": "Acting\n\nThomas struggled with the popularity he gained in the months following the release of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.[4] In November 2019, Thomas reprised his role as Elliott for an Xfinity & Sky UK commercial, in which E.T. returns to visit a now-adult Elliott and his family for the holidays.[5]\n\nSince 2016, Thomas has worked frequently with filmmaker Mike Flanagan, appearing in his films Ouija: Origin of Evil, Gerald's Game and Doctor Sleep, as well as in the Netflix horror series The Haunting of Hill House, which Flanagan created and directed. Thomas also has a role in Flanagan's follow up to The Haunting of Hill House, The Haunting of Bly Manor, and Flanagan's mini-series Midnight Mass.\n\nThomas worked in Stargirl portraying Doctor Mid-Nite and voicing his A.I. counterpart \"Chuck\" until the latter role was recast with Alex Collins in season two.\n\nMusic\n\nThomas wrote songs and played guitar for a San Antonio band, The Blue Heelers (named for the breed of dog), in the 1990s. Although the band was not signed to a record label, it self-produced an album, Twister. Thomas continued to write and record songs. In 1998, his song \"Truckstop Coffee\" (recorded with the Blue Heelers) appeared on V2's soundtrack for Niagara, Niagara.[6] In 2003, Thomas and Nikki Sudden collaborated on the music for Mika Kaurism√§ki's film Honey Baby, which featured four original songs written and performed by Thomas as the fictional musician Tom Brackett.[7] An album was in the works, but Sudden died unexpectedly in 2006.[8]"
