Haydon announces Ravinia Festival’s complete 2024 summer lineup, offering 60 artist debuts and more than 100 concerts ranging from rock/pop, R&B, classical, jazz, and country, to movies with live orchestra, dance performances, Fiesta Ravinia, and more. Summer 2024 also features the annual six-week summer residency by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (CSO) with Chief Conductor Marin Alsop and a range of classical offerings from solo recitals and chamber music to semi-staged opera and dance.\n\n“With an extraordinary range of concerts and artists, we are excited to offer an inspiring and captivating season for everyone who comes to Ravinia,” said Haydon, Ravinia’s President and CEO. “Whether in Bennett Gordon Hall, Martin Theatre, Pavilion, Lawn, or Carousel, concertgoers will surely experience the spirit of summer with incredible music under the stars.”\n\nBREAKING BARRIERS FESTIVAL\n\nRavinia launched its annual Breaking Barriers Festival in 2022 to spotlight and celebrate women in classical music, particularly in areas where they are radically underrepresented, such as conducting and composing. Marin Alsop curated the inaugural festival, which focused on women conductors, having observed that “it may still be easier for a woman to lead a G7 nation or rise to the rank of four-star general than become the music director of a major American orchestra.”\n\nThis summer, Breaking Barriers 2024 focuses on women leaders in music and space. The festival, which takes place July 26–27, features a Pavilion concert, panel discussions, a composer workshop, and more, presented in collaboration with The Chicago Network (TCN), New Music USA, and the Taki Alsop Conducting Fellowship. Alongside Alsop, the guest leaders include Vanessa Reed, President & CEO of New Music USA, Michelle Larson, President & CEO of Adler Planetarium, Vicky Kalogera, D.I. Linzer Distinguished University Professor in Physics and Astronomy and CIERA Director at Northwestern University, as well as NASA Astronaut Nicole Stott and composer Augusta Read Thomas, among others.\n\nThe centerpiece of the festival weekend is a CSO concert on Friday, July 26, with repertoire inspired by astronomy and led by Alsop. The program will feature The Planets by Gustav Holst with the Apollo Chorus of Chicago, as well as a symphonic-suite edition of The Moons Symphony by Amanda Lee Falkenberg, accompanied by visual effects.\n\nIn addition, Ravinia is pleased to host the annual conference for the Taki Alsop Conducting Fellowship (TACF) alumni during the Breaking Barriers weekend, offering the awardees the opportunity to experience not only rehearsals and concerts, but a dedicated program of masterclasses, workshops, coachings, networking opportunities, and panel discussions. For the last 20 years, TACF laureates have received intensive coaching, mentorship, and financial support to deepen their skills and broaden opportunities on the podiums of the world.\n\nCHICAGO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA\n\nThe CSO’s annual six-week residency—July 12 through August 18 this season—features three weeks of programs led by Alsop and three weeks with distinguished guest conductors.\n\nJuly 12 – The CSO opens its 88th summer season at Ravinia with Alsop and two featured soloists, soprano Masabane Cecilia Rangwanasha* and pianist Michelle Cann.* In an evening of American music, the orchestra opens with Aaron Copland’s beloved classic Appalachian Spring followed by James P. Johnson’s Charleston, highlighting this early jazz piano leader’s influence and the iconic dance of the same name. Rangwanasha is in the spotlight for Samuel Barber’s evocative portrait of a small boy in the American South, Knoxville: Summer of 1915. The program wraps with a celebration of the 100th anniversary of George Gershwin’s Rhapsody in Blue, with Cann at the keyboard making her CSO debut.\n\nJuly 13 – South African cellist-composer Abel Selaocoe* joins Alsop and debuts with the CSO performing his Four Spirits, which “takes the concerto format to thrillingly unprecedented places” (Bachtrack). Themes of ancestral wisdom, faith, and community permeate the program, as the piece is put in perspective alongside Ludwig van Beethoven’s monumental Fifth Symphony and its distinct explorations of fate.\n\nJuly 19 – Conductor Ted Sperling joins the CSO with special guest vocalists to celebrate two iconic pop songwriters, Stevie Wonder and Paul Simon.\n\nJuly 20 – Alsop and the CSO take the stage for Gustav Mahler’s final major work for orchestra, Symphony No. 9. Voted as the greatest symphony of all-time in BBC Music Magazine, the evening-long work has beguiled audiences since its 1912 premiere by Bruno Walter and the Vienna Philharmonic.\n\nJuly 21 – Winner of the gold medal at the International Chopin Competition and recipient of many esteemed prizes, Japanese pianist Hayato Sumino* reunites with Alsop and makes his Ravinia and CSO debuts performing Fryderyk Chopin’s Piano Concerto No. 1. In the second half of the program, Alsop explores symphonic storytelling during the turn of the 19th century, leading the CSO in Richard Strauss’s tone poem Don Juan and Maurice Ravel’s choreographic symphony Daphnis et Chloé (Suite No. 2).\n\nJuly 25 – Mendelssohn's hit violin concerto, played by Augustin Hadelich^, is in the spotlight as Alsop leads the CSO. Also featured on the program are Bernstein’s joyous Symphonic Dances from West Side Story and Stravinsky's timeless Firebird Suite. Conductor Alena Hron*, the 2024–26 Taki Alsop Fellow, guests on the podium to lead Geroge Walker’s Icarus in Orbit.\n\nJuly 26 – The centerpiece of Breaking Barriers 2024 is a space-themed concert complete with visuals and introductions by NASA specialists. Alsop conducts the orchestra in Holst’s The Planets, followed by a suite from Falkenberg’s The Moons Symphony. Audiences will see science come alive and hear from planetary scientists, including Astronaut Nicole Stott together with the composer, as they discuss how Falkenberg’s symphony offers new perspectives for humanity to contemplate our home in the cosmos.\n\nJuly 28 – Taki Alsop Conducting Fellowship alum Carolyn Kuan* leads this year’s Tchaikovsky Spectacular, complete with Ravinia’s signature cannons in the 1812 Overture. Making her CSO debut, she opens the program with the complete music from the first act of The Nutcracker. Desirée Ruhstrat also makes her CSO debut as the soloist for the cherished Violin Concerto.\n\nAugust 2 – Conductor Valentina Peleggi, another TACF alum, returns to Ravinia and the CSO, following a guest appearance during last summer’s Breaking Barriers Festival, to join with esteemed pianist Jorge Federico Osorio on Beethoven’s “Emperor” Concerto. Peleggi will also lead Tchaikovsky’s Francesca da Rimini and Respighi’s Pines of Rome.\n\nAugust 4 – Music director, conductor, and arranger Kevin Stites explores the music of legendary performer and film composer Henry Mancini for the annual Gala Benefit Evening. Curated and hosted by actor Rob Lindley, “Mancini at 100: The Music of Henry Mancini, from the big screen, to the small screen, to the stage and beyond” features Broadway vocalists Jessie Mueller* (Waitress, Beautiful: The Carole King Musical), Norm Lewis* (The Phantom of the Opera, Les Misérables), and Karen Mason* (Sunset Boulevard), with all three making their Ravinia and CSO debuts.\n\nAugust 9 & 11 – The CSO delves into operatic repertory as a semi-staging of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s Idomeneo is conducted by Los Angeles Opera (and former Ravinia) Music Director James Conlon in the Martin Theatre. The work, set in Crete in 1200 BCE and telling a story from the Trojan War, shines light on a talented group of singers. Starring are tenor Matthew Polenzani as Greek king Idomeneo, mezzo-soprano Samantha Hankey* as Idamante, soprano Andrea Carroll* as princess Ilia, and soprano Alexandria Shiner* as princess Elettra.\n\nAugust 10 – Conlon will lead an all-Mozart program with the CSO in the festival’s Pavilion between the opera performances. The program will feature both of the composer’s G-minor symphonies—the “little” No. 25, K. 183, and the “great” No. 40, K. 550—along with the Violin Concerto No. 5, welcoming James Ehnes as soloist on the violin.\n\nAugust 18 – Conductor Jonathan Rush, a frequent Ravinia guest in recent seasons and former assistant to Alsop, returns to the CSO podium. Chicago native Rachel Barton Pine takes the stage with Rush and the orchestra as the soloist for José White Lafitte’s Violin Concerto and Niccolò Paganini’s La Campanella.\n\nNATIONAL SEMINARIO RAVINIA: ORCHESTRAS FOR ALL\n\nRavinia’s Reach Teach Play education programs serve more than 20,000 young people across the Chicago area each year. Reach Teach Play’s many offerings provide children and families in underserved areas of Cook and Lake Counties with music education and live music performances in their schools, communities, and at Ravinia through a portfolio of high-quality and inclusive programs, including Sistema Ravinia. This transformational orchestral program fosters social development year-round through daily ensemble and orchestral training for 4th–12th-grade students in Chicago and Lake County public schools.\n\nThis summer, under the leadership of Chief Conductor Marin Alsop, Ravinia will host the second National Seminario Ravinia: Orchestras For All, a gathering of more than 100 students from El Sistema–inspired organizations in 18 states, Canada, Mexico, Greece, and Sweden, including Sistema Ravinia. Participating students will experience four days of orchestral training and mentorship from members of the National Seminario Ravinia’s Orchestra Partner, the National Orchestral Institute + Festival (NOI+F).\n\nThe Seminario, which takes place July 7–11, culminates in a side-by-side Pavilion concert with NOI+F on July 10. NOI+F musicians will perform multiple pieces with Seminario students as well as Mahler’s First Symphony on their own, conducted by Alsop and Lead Seminario Conductor Jessica Altarriba, a 2024–26 Taki Alsop Award recipient. In addition, Ravinia will provide an opportunity for the Seminario chaperones to engage in creative music-making workshops led by Seminario partner El Sistema USA.\n\nVisit the website to learn more about Ravinia’s Reach Teach Play programs.

Since opening its doors, RSMI has offered coachings, masterclasses, and performance opportunities to over 1,600 exceptional musicians, many of whom have cultivated highly visible and successful careers in performance, artistic leadership, and music education.\n\nThis summer marks esteemed violinist Midori’s first summer as Artistic Director of RSMI’s Piano & Strings Program. Midori succeeds acclaimed violinist Miriam Fried, who had held that position since 1994, following the tenures of the late Robert Mann (1988) and Walter Levin (1989–93).\n\nAbout her appointment, Midori said, “I am very much looking forward to being involved in RSMI in this new capacity. Working with young musicians has been central to my career, and this program is one of the most important of its kind in the music field.”\n\nRSMI musicians perform roughly two dozen programs during the summer season on their home stage, the purpose-built Bennett Gordon Hall. All concerts are open to the public and are a mix of free and ticketed events. Most performances are also live-streamed or later uploaded to Ravinia’s YouTube channel.\n\nBridges Competition: Now in its sixth year, Ravinia’s 2024 Bridges Composition Competition performances spotlight its winners, who merge the genres of jazz and classical chamber music in their new works.
