As our community continues to grow, these showings offer more opportunities for The Franklin Theatre to be a gathering in beautiful Downtown Franklin, Tennessee.”\n\nThis new series gives movie fans the chance to watch their favorite shows on the big screen again in a beautiful, art-deco inspired auditorium. Themed lighting and decorations, concessions and drink specials, and coordinated pre-show music will make these showings a more immersive experience than a typical night at the movies.\n\nOpening in 1937 with the film Night Must Fall, starring Robert Montgomery and Rosalind Russell, The Franklin Theatre has been a home for movies in Franklin’s Historic Downtown since its beginning. Even through its renovation and reopening, movies have remained a key focal point in The Franklin Theatre’s programming efforts.\n\n“Movies at The Franklin Theatre are a pastime we love and stand by,” added Chad Gilbert. “With this new series, we’re creating a more intentional home for movie lovers in Franklin and Middle Tennessee.”\n\nFor ticket information, visit www.franklintheatre.com/movies or call 615-538-2076.\n\nThe film, set on the Natchez Trace, follows the events surrounding the death of the famed American explorer & will feature Q & A with Director & Actor\n\nA story of the allegedly unresolved 1809 demise of a national hero, Mysterious Circumstance, directed by Clark Richey, sheds light on Meriwether Lewis’s death by gunshot on the Natchez Trace, an isolated frontier road connecting Nashville, Tennessee, to Natchez, Mississippi. The film explores if the famed explorer committed suicide as history reports or was his end far more sinister?\n\nIn the film, entangled versions of Lewis’s tragic ending at a remote Tennessee inn are imagined by his friend Alexander Wilson (Billy Slaughter, Mindhunter) during a tense encounter with Priscilla Grinder (Gousset, The Card Counter) – the only witness to Lewis’s final night alive. The historical thriller brings together an award-winning cast and crew that includes Schneider (The Dukes of Hazzard), Sonny Marinelli (Entourage) and Evan Williams (Versailles) as Lewis.\n\n“We’re thrilled to have the opportunity to premiere Mysterious Circumstance, at the historic Franklin Theatre,” said Eric Dilts, Managing Director of The Franklin Theatre. “Set just southwest of Franklin, this film is an opportunity for us to shine a light on the rich, and sometimes complicated, history of Middle Tennessee.”\n\nIn addition to the screening of Mysterious Circumstance, the evening will include brief remarks before the film and a Q & A with writer & director Clark Richey and Amye Gousset, lead actress & producer immediately following.\n\nTickets and more information can be found at www.franklintheatre.com/mysterious-circumstance/. Tickets are also available by calling 615-538-2076, or visiting the box office at 419 Main Street, Franklin, TN.\n\nFan favorites, like White Christmas and National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation,\n\nreturn to The Historic Franklin Theatre and go on sale this Friday.\n\nWe are excited to announce Republic Bank as the presenting sponsor for its holiday movie screenings throughout December. As part of their month-long “Christmas in July” promotion, all holiday movies will go on sale Friday, July 22 at 11:00 AM.\n\n“Holiday movies at The Franklin Theatre have become a staple for many families in middle Tennessee,” said The Franklin Theatre’s Managing Director, Eric Dilts. “Our 2022 lineup is sure to excite all audiences with the beloved classics and fan-favorites. These holiday screenings often sell out, so everyone is encouraged to make their holiday viewing plans now if they can. Also, as a corporate partner that is helping keep this tradition alive, we’re thrilled to have Republic Bank work with us this year to bring these cherished movies to our historic theatre”.\n\n“Republic Bank, for over 40 years, has really strived to be a community partner in all the markets that we serve. The Franklin Theatre, to us, is a treasure here. Not only for the historical aspect, but for the entertainment value that it brings,” said Chad Hart, Tennessee Market President for Republic Bank. “It’s become a time-honored tradition for many families in Williamson County to enjoy some of the holiday shows, and we’re excited to be part of it this year.”\n\nAs an added benefit, patrons that purchase any “Christmas in July” movie or live show will be entered to win a Franklin Theatre prize package that includes Franklin Theatre Merchandise, concessions and (non-holiday) movie vouchers, and a $100 Franklin Theatre gift card.\n\nThe “Christmas in July” movie lineup will include:\n\nTHE LAST HOLIDAY; December 6th, 2022\n\nELF; December 10th, 2022\n\nTHIS CHRISTMAS; December 12th, 2022\n\nA CHRISTMAS STORY; December 13th, 2022\n\nNATIONAL LAMPOON’S CHRISTMAS VACATION; December 18th & 19th, 2022\n\nHOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS; December 19th, 2022\n\nIT’S A WONDERFUL LIFE; December 20th, 22nd, & 23rd, 2022\n\nTHE POLAR EXPRESS; December 21st & 22nd, 2022\n\nWHITE CHRISTMAS; December 22nd, 2022\n\nAdditional showings may be added throughout the season.

The Warner Bros. Pictures film, which premiered on June 24th, explores the relationship between Elvis (played by Austin Butler) and his enigmatic manager, Colonel Tom Parker (played by Tom Hanks).\n\nAmong those in attendance were Nashville-based music producer and composer Shannon Sanders, The McCrary Sisters, and two of Elvis’ former bandmates, Tony Brown and Larry Strickland. Sanders moderated a short panel with Brown and Strickland who shared memories and insights from their time working with Elvis.\n\nSanders, who plays a pentecostal pastor in the film, surprised the crowd with a video call from director “Baz Luhrmann.” Luhrmann thanked everyone for their attendance and support and signed off by leading a chant of “it’s time to take care of business!”\n\nThis event served as both a film premiere and a fundraiser for the non-profit The Franklin Theatre. Events like this help us further our mission of providing world-class performing arts experiences to diverse Williamson County residents and visitors. We’d like to thank our staff for their hard work in producing this high-quality event, our advisory board for their continued leadership and oversight, our 1937 Society members, our Franklin Theatre donors, and all who attended on Wednesday. Special thanks to our in-kind event partners Cromwell Media, 102.1 The Ville, Menu Maker Catering, Leiper’s Fork Distillery, Curio Brewing Company, and Bite Club Baked Goods.\n\nThe Franklin Theatre ‘Elvis’ Premiere Press Coverage:\n\nWilliamson Homepage >\n\nBeginning with small, private rental events, theater now looking to bring back live entertainment, movies and hybrid live-streamed shows that conform to current COVID restrictions\n\nFRANKLIN, TN (March 10, 2020) – After going dark to public performances last year due to COVID-19 restrictions, the Heritage Foundation of Williamson County, TN, parent organization of The Franklin Theatre, is excited to announce the theater’s phased reopening plan for 2021.\n\nCurrently the theater is open for private rentals, including Monday nights through April where another local non-profit, Studio Tenn, is hosting its popular virtual talk show: Studio Tenn Talks: Conversations with Patrick Cassidy. In addition, as part of its mission to be a platform for local philanthropy, The Franklin Theatre is currently working in partnership with local video production companies and The Community Foundation of Middle Tennessee (CFMT) to provide an opportunity for non-profits to film affordable promotional videos to support their participation in The Big Payback, CFMT’s annual 24-hour giving event that kicks off on Wednesday, May 5 at 6 p.m.\n\nThe current reopening plan, which will be modified as needed based on any future COVID-related restrictions, will bring back limited-capacity weekend movies, limited-capacity plus livestream performances through June. Until the state guidelines indicate otherwise, the theater’s capacity is approximately 75 guests, which accounts for adequate social distancing.\n\nBeginning in July, the theater will begin presenting movies and live performances with increasing regularity and possible increased capacity. The Franklin Theatre will continue to follow the governor’s Tennessee Pledge and CDC guidelines and update reopening plans as needed.\n\nThe theater’s box office will reopen with limited hours beginning on Friday, March 12, in time for Sandi Patty’s ticket on-sale date. The box office’s limited hours will run through April and will be 11 a.m. – 5 p.m. on Friday, Saturdays and Sundays. In addition to new shows going on sale over the next several weeks, many 2021-2022 shows are currently on sale.\n\nSandi Patty (Limited Capacity & Livestream) – Saturday, May 8 | 3 p.m. & 7 p.m.\n\nDeborah Allen (Limited Capacity & Livestream) – Saturday, June 5 | 2 p.m. & 8 p.m. – ON SALE FRIDAY, APRIL 2\n\nThe Isaacs – Friday, July 9 | 8 p.m. – CURRENTLY ON SALE\n\nJames Gregory – Saturday, July 10 | 8 p.m. – ON SALE FRIDAY, APRIL 2\n\nJeff Allen – Thursday, July 15 | 8 p.m. – CURRENTLY ON SALE\n\nLarry Carlton – Saturday, July 17 | 8 p.m. – ON SALE FRIDAY, APRIL 9\n\nFarewell Angelina – Thursday, July 29 | 8 p.m. – CURRENTLY ON SALE\n\nJohn Ford Coley, Billy Dean & Tom Wurth – Backgrounds and Bridges Acoustic Tour – Thursday, August 5 | 8 p.m. – CURRENTLY ON SALE\n\nAllie Colleen – Friday, August 6 | 8 p.m. – CURRENTLY ON SALE\n\nHenry Cho – Saturday, August 14 | 4 p.m. & 8 p.m. – CURRENTLY ON SALE\n\nGary Puckett & The Union Gap – Thursday, August 19 & Friday, August 20 | 8 p.m. – ON SALE FRIDAY, APRIL 16\n\nDavid Wilcox – Saturday, August 21 | 8 p.m. – CURRENTLY ON SALE\n\nBJ Thomas – Friday, August 27 & Saturday, August 28 | 8 p.m. – CURRENTLY ON SALE\n\n“We are emerging from an incredibly challenging season for The Franklin Theatre,” said Heritage Foundation COO Meg Hershey. “While we had to temporarily close the doors to public events, we are diligently working behind the scenes to reschedule some of the amazing programming that was planned for last year. We couldn’t be more excited about getting this cherished venue back open to continue its mission, bringing inspiring arts and entertainment experiences to our community.”\n\nHershey went on to say that surviving an unprecedented season which left the theater with very few options for programming has been nothing short of challenging.\n\n“This theater has been sustained by the community’s embrace of underwritten marquee messages, limited small group private rental events and through the commitment of corporate sponsors and donors of the nonprofit Heritage Foundation and its division The Franklin Theatre,” she said.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation is also making plans for a 10th anniversary celebration later this year to commemorate 10 years since the theater’s restoration and grand re-opening.\n\nThe Franklin Theatre, which has been closed to the public since mid-March in response to state guidelines regarding COVID-19, will reopen to the public on June 12 at 7 p.m. with a showing of Monty Python and The Holy Grail (PG). The theater is also bringing back the popular Silver Matinee series on June 17, with a showing of Some Like It Hot(1959).\n\nTheater Executive Director Paul T. Couch and his team have been hard at work\n\nduring the closure rescheduling shows that were slated during the latter part of\n\nMarch through June and working on how and when the theater could safely reopen\n\nto patrons. He said many of the live performances have been rescheduled in lieu of\n\nbeing cancelled and it was determined showing of movies would be the best way to\n\nease safely back into operations.\n\nWhen the theater reopens on June 12, patrons, along with the theater staff, will be\n\nrequired to wear cloth face coverings while in the theater and seating capacity will\n\nbe limited to achieve social distancing safety measures.\n\n“We have been preparing behind the scenes while waiting on clear guidelines from\n\nthe state on how and when we are able to reopen the theater,” Couch said. “Our\n\nfirst priority is to consider the safety of our staff and guests. We didn’t want to open\n\nuntil we were certain we could provide that. We are excited to open with a timeless\n\ncomedy classic and look forward to seeing patrons back in the theater seats in a few\n\nweeks.”\n\nIn an effort to provide a contact-free experience, tickets for each show will need to\n\nbe purchased in advance at www.franklintheatre.com. All seating will be done with\n\nrespect to social distancing guidelines. Contact-free purchases can be made from\n\nthe theater’s concession stand.\n\nJUNE MOVIES INCLUDE:\n\n“Monty Python & the Holy Grail” (PG)\n\n“The Goonies” (PG)\n\n“Labyrinth” (PG)\n\n“Some Like It Hot” (1959)\n\n“How to Train Your Dragon” (PG)\n\n“Field of Dreams” (PG)\n\n“Roman Holiday” (1953)\n\n“Shoplifters” (R)\n\nFOR FULL MOVIE SCHEDULE VISIT: https://www.franklintheatre.com/tickets/movies/\n\nFor COVID-19 Guidelines & Requirements: https://www.franklintheatre.com/coronavirus/\n\nWe look forward to announcing details on live performances at a later date.\n\nHaving received more than 200 submissions the festival program, the final films have been selected for the 2019 Franklin International Independent Film Festival. The opening night for FIIFF will be held at the Franklin Theater on August 14, 2019 with screen local film director, Barbara Hall’s American Masters film “CHARLEY PRIDE, I’m Just Me.”\n\n“I could not be more excited about the program lineup,” said Nancy Puetz. President of Williamson County Cultural Arts Commission. “The storytelling brought by this amazing group of filmmakers is exciting, thought-provoking and most of all entertaining. These filmmakers have carved out their carefully drawn images for film lovers and other filmmakers with a keen eye and great respect for the process.
