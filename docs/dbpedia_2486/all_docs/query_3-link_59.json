        "text": "Michael John Bauer, a beacon of generosity and a true friend to all who knew him, passed away peacefully on November 27, 2023, at the age of 73. Born on August 13, 1950, in Rockville Centre, New York, Michael's life was one of dedication, thoughtfulness, and service. Predeceased by his parents, Adam F. Bauer and Irene Boyd, Michael's memory is cherished by his loving siblings, Wendy and her husband Paul Hetrick, Adam Bauer, and Maryellen Hermance. His presence in their lives was a source of joy and unwavering support, and his absence will be deeply felt. Michael was a proud and active member of Alcoholics Anonymous, where he celebrated over forty years of sobriety. His journey and commitment to recovery were an inspiration to many, and his generous spirit made him a mentor and a guiding light for those who walked the path of sobriety alongside him. Beyond his contributions to the community, Michael had a passion for technology. He found great pleasure in working on and rebuilding Apple computers. His skill and patience in restoring these machines were akin to an artist bringing a canvas to life. His friends and family often marveled at his ability to breathe new life into what many would consider outdated technology. Those who knew Michael will remember him as a man who lived his life with kindness and a warm smile for everyone he met. His friendly demeanor was contagious, and he had the rare ability to make people feel genuinely seen and heard. As we bid farewell to Michael John Bauer, we celebrate a life well-livedâ€”a life filled with purpose, love, and an enduring legacy of friendship and service. His spirit will continue to shine brightly in the hearts of all who were fortunate enough to know him.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, is so desired, the family would like donations to Good Shepherd Hospice, 12470 Telecom Drive Suite 301, Temple Terrace, Florida 33637.\n\nServices will be held privately by the family.\n\nOnline condolences can be made at www.haught.care.\n\nFuneral arrangements were trusted to Haught Funeral Home, 708 W. Dr. MLK Jr. Blvd Plant City, FL 33563, (813) 717-9300\n\nTo send flowers to the family or plant a tree in memory of Michael John Bauer, please visit our floral store."
