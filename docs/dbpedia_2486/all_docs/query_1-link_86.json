        "text": "July 6, 2021\n\nPlease don't let me be reincarnated as a fire hydrant.\n\nI had the privilege of being acquainted with Mike Bauer and family. He was a perfectly good English teacher, who one day, decided he'd quit teaching to write that book that he'd had in his head for many years. I got the impression that Mrs Bauer wasn't too keen on the idea. Well here he is, many years later, a world-famous, prize-winning author! (Very slight exaggeration there.)\n\nI just loved this book. The last few chapters brought a wee tear to my eye, as I remembered my childhood buddy who also had a rather sad ending. He was a very naughty labrador who caused much havoc in the neighbourhood but he was my best friend and I was his. I remember how empty the house felt, and how long I cried when my parents told me he had to be put down (I didn't even know what that meant). I wish he was here at my feet even now - 50 years later.\n\nAnyway - this is a great book. Simply language and short chapters make it something you could read to your child at night. Hmm. Maybe not the last three chapters. This is really a book for all ages, especially if you have/had a flee-bitten friend.\n\nOnya Mike. You done good. AND I only found one grammatical error and no typos. I give you an A+.\n\nAugust 14, 2013\n\nShort-listed for The Children's Book Council of Australia awards, Michael Gerard Bauer is and award-wining and best-selling children's fiction author.\n\nThis book tells the story of Mister Mosely and the Ingram family.\n\nWhilst discussing some very grown up issues including financial hardship, depression, new siblings, job loss and infidelity, this is purely and simply a book about a boy and his dog. It also touches heavily on how a pet, especially a dog becomes a member of the family, they're there when times are good and bad and they'll show you undying affection even when the world seems to be at its blackest. Most of all though, this is a great children's book. It would be a good book to read with your child if you are thinking about getting a dog because underlying all the stories are bolstered by the principles that every potential pet owner should consider, dogs live for a long time, need to be trained and fed and exercised and loved and are a lifelong commitment.\n\nJune 28, 2021\n\nI hope everyone has a Mr. Moseley once in their lifetimes.\n\nOctober 8, 2010\n\nThe usual thing to say about books like this is that anyone who has ever loved (and lost) a beloved pet will adore it (and BYO tissues), and that is certainly true of Just a Dog, but it's also selling it a little short if one were to leave it at that. Just a Dog is a beautifully balanced and modulated sequence of stories about Mr Mosely (aka Moe), best-beloved dog of the Ingram family, told by the eldest child, Corey. As Corey relates funny and sad and scary stories about Moe, he also reveals much about the hardships and trials, as well as the joys and loves that come to his family over those dog years. It's a beautiful device, but it only works so well because Moe is such a great dog-character, and Corey rings so deeply true as a child-narrator who doesn't entirely understand everything that's going on in his family, but who does, at the heart of it, understand Family. And it's also just a really lovely book about a great dog and the boy who loved him. And you can never have too many of those.\n\nSeptember 21, 2012\n\nTen year old Corey narrates the reader through a series of stories about his dog Mr. Mosley. Mr. Mosley was supposed to be a pure-bred Dalmatian but instead he seems to be part Dalmatian and part Great Dane. As the title suggests, Mr. Moe is more that just a dog for Corey and his family, he is a friend and family member that shares funny moments, sad moments, and tough moments with the family. Mr. Moe knows how to help everyone in the family in their times of need.\n\nWow does this book take you on an emotional roller coaster! If you are going to be reading this book in a public place, please be aware that I laughed out loud and shed a few tears while reading this book. As an animal lover, and a dog owner, it was so easy to relate to Corey and his stories about Mr. Moe. I loved hearing about Mr. Moe’s puppyhood and the trouble he got into. As things start getting tense in Corey’s family, Mr. Moe becomes the one constant that helps him get through. This book is sure to touch the hearts of readers young and old!\n\nDecember 14, 2010\n\nSob. Sob. Sobbed my way through the last few chapters. MGB owes me a box of tissues and a nights sleep. Another one of Dans favourites for the year and the best dog book I've read in a long time. This has been a firm favourite at school since it was published late this year. At the launch of this book I was HORRIFIED to learn that MGB's own children did not grow up with a family dog! I was SURE that to have written this well about a dog the author must have a dog curled up on his feet as he wrote every word. Just goes to show that MGB can write. The man can def write!\n\nNovember 5, 2015\n\nthis book is grate i love it it so sweet it have so much details its a grate book no its an amazing book i think everyone should read this book it is really good\n\nFebruary 23, 2024\n\nThis is a great book for anyone who’ve ever had a beloved pet, at any time in their lives. I’ve had my “Mr. Mosely” and had to say goodbye to him 2 days after his 16th birthday.\n\nI guess this is a book for juveniles/YA but I don’t let that bother me. I like any book that’s well written and of interest to me.\n\nSo hooray for this. 5 stars.\n\nNovember 29, 2018\n\nthis book is an amazing book that i loved because it is very emotional and a good book in general\n\nJanuary 15, 2022\n\nAdding this to my recommendations for dog lovers, it is a journal of sorts written by a boy and all the stories about his beloved dog. You can tell where the book is going from the start, but there are sweet stories in between about the dog's life. Woven into the stories are struggle the boy is having with his parents fighting and dad losing his job.\n\nNovember 29, 2017\n\nTalk this dog met a good the host，a think this dog is very lucky ,it is very loyal ,he always happy master ,and its host is very love it ,make well with it ,help him when the owner is having trouble, it story I'm really touched，I like it book very much.\n\nJanuary 2, 2015\n\nMy 9 year old son is all about dog stories right now so \"Just A Dog\" was the latest book I to read to him. As we began to read the book, it was clear that the author was a child. The writting style consisted of short sentences without a lot of detail. But, kids are also known for being very honest and not having the filters that so many of us adults do, and this was true here. The stories about this boy and his dog ranged from funny to sad. What surprised me was the underlying story of the authors mother and father and their financial and marital issues. As an adult, I found this uncomfortable but it didnt seem to phase my son. The one thing I must warn about it that this book does not have a happy ending. If the death of a pet is something that could upset your child then avoid this book. I wish I had known this before I began reading. By the time I came to that part of the story though, my son insisted that I continue so I did. The loss of the dog was upsetting to my son but the thing that really bothered him was the discourse in the marriage. My son has talked to me a few times about how the mom and dad fought nod how sad this made the author. Overall I enjoyed the book and so did my son, but I would not recommend it to a sensitive child or a child under the age of 12.\n\nJanuary 4, 2016\n\nSometimes a dog isn't just a dog--sometimes he's the glue the holds a whole family together.\n\nMr. Mosely is a special dog. Not just because he's so big (he's part Great Dane.) Not just because he's all white (with one black spot under his eye and a heart shaped splotch on his chest.) Not just because he's clumsy, or because of tricks (he only knows one, and it's not very good.) He's special because he seems to know exactly what everyone in Corey's family needs, even when they don't know themselves. This is the story of Mr. Mosely, from his puppyhood to the last time he curls up on the back porch. It's the story of how sometimes a dog isn't \"just a dog\". Sometimes he's the glue the holds a whole family together.\n\nSeptember 12, 2018\n\nWell this was an emotional roller coaster. I read this aloud to my grade 4 students - which I don't regret but I don't think I'll do it again. I like the concept of reading about tough, real-life things. Kids are exposed to tough stuff, and need to know that it's ok to cry if you feel sad etc.\n\nI certainly agree with other reviewers that it's surprising that the author didn't grow up with a dog! I cuddled my own dog very hard when I got home after finishing this one!\n\nSeptember 8, 2017\n\nAbsolutely fell in love with this book. It will make you cry, laugh and in general, this book will make you feel all sorts of emotions. While reading this book, I could not stop, literally stayed up at night trying to finish the book. P.S, keep a box of tissues next to you!!\n\nNovember 24, 2020\n\nThinking it’s a story about just a dog who fits into people’s lives, and their experiences which it is - but it’s so much more. Mr Mosely wraps you in a family hug when the pressures of life are just too much.\n\nOctober 7, 2014\n\nThe dog in this story is much more than just a family pet.\n\nNovember 2, 2014\n\nIt is really good if you like dogs and also if you like sad stories because this one got to me.\n\nOctober 15, 2017\n\nI read this when I was about 9, and it was the first book that made me cry.\n\nApril 17, 2018\n\nOh my gosh my heart hurts. A great book for young readers but ideally ones that haven’t lost a dog or they’re going to be wailing and spewing snot all over into several tissues like I was, a grown woman in her thirties.\n\nNo one was ever as happy to see me as Mr. Moesly wise. He always made me feel good. Even if I got into trouble at school or lost something or some kids were being idiots and saying or doing stuff, it didn’t make any difference to Moe. He just went nuts every time like I was some kind of hero or a movie star are the most important person in the world. And that’s sort of how I felt.\n\nAnd this is why we have pets, especially dogs. It’s why, after losing my dog, I immediately had to seek out a new friend. But this short book (with no pictures, save the cover) is so grand. It takes readers into all the aspects of life touches by a dog: the morning paper, sleeping arrangements, thunderstorms, new babies, marriage squabbles, lost jobs, and life lessons.\n\nEven if I was bawling in the bathroom for a good while over it, this book is worth the read. Our dogs teach us many, many things, and ten year old narrator Corey aptly notes:\n\nMaybe I learned [how to wait] from Mr. Mosely. Maybe it’s the one trick he taught me. That sometimes, no matter how much you want something, the very best thing you can do is wait, just like he did wait for stuff to happen or stop happening, for things to heal up and get better or for someone to come home. I reckon that’s a pretty good track to learn, from just a dog.\n\nJanuary 9, 2017\n\nI recently read an interesting book titled “Just a Dog”, written by Michael G. Bauer. The book detailed the life of a dog named Mr. Mosely and his owner Corey. This unique dog story shows how he looks to the way he interacts with his owner and family. He appears to be part Great Dane and part Dalmatian. Mr. Mosely is a big dog mostly white, with a wonky black heart shaped marking on his chest. He also has half of his left ear black and a black tear marking under his right eye. Mr. Mosely has an uncanny ability to anticipate Corey’s needs, before he reflects them. Corey depends on Mr. Mosley to be his friend during their time together to get him through the good and the bad.\n\nThis fictional animal story was a tear jerker at times, but also had inspirational moments that lifted your spirits. I enjoyed how Corey told the story from his personal journal about life with his dog. Mr. Bauer drew from some of his real life experiences with his dog “Penny”. I think 8th graders that like reading this book, might also like “The Art of Racing in the Rain” by Garth Stein because both books show a strong connection between the pet and the owner.\n\nMay 16, 2018\n\nJust A Dog is an amazing story about a dog and his family. Corey is a 10 year old boy who gets a little puppy and named him Mr.Mosley. He was little until he grew out of the puppy stage, Mr.Mosley is half great dane so he’s a pretty big dog. He is a very loyal and protective dog for Corey and his family.He's special because he seems to know exactly what everyone in Corey's family needs, even when they don't know themselves.This is the story of Mr. Mosely, from his puppyhood to the last time he curls up on the back porch. It's the story of how sometimes a dog isn't \"just a dog\". Sometimes he's the glue the holds a whole family together. This book is for dog lovers for sure! It was written for a younger audience. Even though it is written for a younger audience it was still a great book! Was very heart touching and really hit hard. I would for sure give this book a 10/10. If you love to read books about animals and dogs this book is for you. This book really connects with me because i had a dog who was the same way in my family when i was younger. If I could read this book again i so would. Definitely recommend it!\n\nDecember 20, 2020\n\nMister Mosly è un enorme cane bianco con qualche macchiolina nera, che il piccolo Corey Ingram sceglie da una numerosa cucciolata di festanti pallette pelose. Tra tutti Mister Mosly è quello che rimane in disparte, in attesa di essere notato e scelto.\n\nIl cucciolo, com'è prevedibile, sconvolge i ritmi della vita familiare, portando caos, ma anche tanto amore ed una contagiosa allegria.\n\nCorey, voce narrante di questa storia per grandi e piccini, ci racconta avventure e disavventure che riguardano Mister Mosly, le quali si intrecciano con la vita quotidiana della famiglia Ingram.\n\nPurtroppo arriva anche il momento della separazione definitiva...\n\nUn libro delizioso, a tratti spassoso, caratterizzato da frasi brevi e linguaggio semplice, in grado di arrivare al cuore dei lettori di ogni età.\n\nCome non immedesimarsi con le gioie, i dolori e il senso di vuoto che i nostri amici a 4 zampe ci danno e ci hanno dato!\n\nMarch 9, 2018\n\nMeine Meinung:\n\nMister Matti ist ein toller Hund, wie man ihn sich wünscht. Er mag zwar kein echter Dalmatiner sein, doch ein paar Punkte hat er schon. Die außergewöhnlichsten direkt über dem Herzen und unter dem Auge die aussieht wie eine Träne. Matti kann einiges. Mit Engelsgeduld erträgt er das er geschmückt wird, wie ein Weihnachtsbaum und kämpft auch mal gegen ungeliebte Stofftiere. Die Geschichte berührt, lässt einen nicht kalt. Klar und einfach in der Sprache gelingt es den Kindern die Erebnisse von Corey und Matti, gut zu verstehen. Auch Tränen blieben nicht aus. Bei Lisa und auch mir nicht. Wer Hundegeschichten mag, darf sehr gern zu diesem Buch greifen, das ein ganzes Hundeleben beinhaltet.\n\nZusammenfassung:\n\nWunderbare Geschichten über einen tollen Familienhund.\n\nJanuary 15, 2019\n\nMr. Mosely is a special dog. Not just because he's so big, not just because he's all white, not just because he's clumsy. He's special because he seems to know exactly what everyone in Corey's family needs, even when they don't know themselves. This is the story of Mr. Mosely, from his puppyhood to the last time he curls up on the back porch. It's the story of how sometimes a dog isn't \"just a dog\". Sometimes he's the glue to hold a whole family together.\n\nDogs are the best friends of human beings. Dogs are loyal, smart, friendly, understanding, loving, funny. They are exactly family members. A dog devotes a whole life to the owner who brings happiness and comfort sometimes a dog isn’t just a dog\n\nSeptember 22, 2023\n\nThis is a good book in that it captures a lot of what makes our furry family members special. It also hurts to read because, frankly, there's only one ending to these kinds of books if it's about the life of the animal, vs. something more episodic like Ribsy. I haven't even had dogs in my life for long (relatives, one temporary roommate), and this book speaks to me about the depth of a dog's love.\n\nAbsolutely recommended for dog lovers, but grab some tissues. :(\n\nJanuary 6, 2018\n\nThis story is call “Just a Dog” by Micheal Gerard Bauer, it’s talk about a dog and a family’s story, it’s a funny and warm story.\n\nIn the beginning, a dog came to a family, the family some like it, but some dislike and avoid his in, but at end he stril stay in this family.\n\nIn the middle, he did a big a trouble, so the family are some angry.\n\nIn the end, the family apologizes he and readmit.\n\nIn this story, I learn use my heart, to know about, another people do for my is or isn’t good for me.\n\nMay 23, 2017\n\nJust a Dog by Michael Gerard Bauer is a sad book. This book is about a boy who has a dog named Mr. Mosely. This dog is a very special dog to the family because the dog has been by their side since day one. But one day a tragic thing happens to Mr. Mosely. I like this book because it is really sad and it makes you cry.\n\nApril 21, 2024\n\nThere are some cute stories in this journal written from a young boy’s point of view. However, the park story was cringe-worthy since it just ended without discussing what he should have done differently. Also the fighting scenes, even the playful ones between the parents, took away from the various happy and sad Mister Mosley stories."
