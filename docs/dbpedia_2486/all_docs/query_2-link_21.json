I went on to be a dispatcher for NMBPD for several years while he worked in NM. Our paths still crossed quite often and my heart was broken when he was shot. I will never forget that morning and seeing the news. Just knowing it was a friend alone was devastating.\n\nShawn Tuttle Schaefer (frmr Dispatcher)\n\nNMBPD but friend outside our departments"
