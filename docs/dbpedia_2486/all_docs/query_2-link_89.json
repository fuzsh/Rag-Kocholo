        "text": "Police in northeast Nebraska have identified a man whose body was found inside an apartment building chimney in Norfolk last Thursday, but they’re still not sure about the circumstances that led to his death.\n\nNorfolk Police Captain Michael Bauer says 29-year-old Zachariah Andrews was identified by scars, marks, tattoos and an identification card found with his body.\n\nAndrews was last seen alive Sept. 15, the day before police received a call from a tenant of the apartment building who said he heard a man yelling for help.\n\nBy the time officers arrived, the yelling had stopped, and officers couldn’t locate anyone. A missing-person report on Andrews was taken on Oct. 3. Police believe the death was an accident, but an investigation is ongoing."
