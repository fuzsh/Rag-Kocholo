        "text": "Reflections for Detective Sergeant Steven Ernest Bauer\n\nGrowing up, my Mom and I went to Rum Runner Bay every Sunday. Steve and his brother Mike as well as nephew Jamie were there every week. I went on to be a dispatcher for NMBPD for several years while he worked in NM. Our paths still crossed quite often and my heart was broken when he was shot. I will never forget that morning and seeing the news. Just knowing it was a friend alone was devastating.\n\nShawn Tuttle Schaefer (frmr Dispatcher)\n\nNMBPD but friend outside our departments\n\nI remember Steven Bauer even all these years later. He worked the 7th avenue Flea Market where I grew up. He was one of the nicest people I ever met. Kind, thoughtful and even as a child it caught my attention as something so very special about him. How he brought a smile to people's faces. When I heard of his death, it was devastating, I couldn't understand how this could happen or make sense of it. His death was a great loss to our community and to his family.\n\nCaroline Williams\n\ncitizen\n\nRest in peace Detective Sergeant Bauer. Never forgotten as I drive by NW 7th Avenue and see the sign with your heroic name affixed to it.\n\nRabbi Lewis S. Davis\n\nRest in peace Detective Sergeant Bauer. I have driven several times by the street sign bearing your humbled and heroic name on NW 7th Avenue and NW 135th Street. I remember your Inspector's Funeral at Fulford Methodist Church in North Miami Beach, Florida with the helicopters hovering overhead. My dad may he rest in peace was a longtime New York City police officer serving thirty-eight years with the 102nd precinct in Richmond Hill in Kew Gardens, a part of the borough of Queens.\n\nRabbi Lewis S.

Your sacrifice is not forgotten.\n\nOfficer 11169\n\nIt is hard to believe it has been 20 years since that terrible day.\n\nIt remains the toughest day of my life and yet that terrible day taught me the greatest lesson in life. When you walk out that door with your uniform on, nobody thinks it can happen to them. We all take life for granted, but that day made a young policer offer grow up real fast. My life was never the same, I learned the true meaning of life, what truly is important and not to take any day for granted. You were our \"class clown\" and you still are when we all get together and talk about the crazy things you did. NMPD and the world lost a great human being. You are always thought of and missed, and in my mind will always stay \"Forever Young\"\n\nOfficer Patricia Pereira\n\nNorth Miami Police fellow officer\n\nYour heroism and service is honored today, the 20th anniversary of your death. Your memory lives and you continue to inspire. Thank you for your service. My cherished son Larry Lasater was a fellow police officer murdered in the line of duty on April 24, 2005 while serving as a Pittsburg, CA police officer.\n\nTime never diminishes respect and your memory will always be honored and revered. I pray for solace for all those who love and miss you for I know the pain and pride are forever.\n\nPhyllis Loya\n\nMom of fallen California Officer Larry Lasater, Pittsburg PD, eow 4/24/05\n\nI drive by the Kislak bank where your life was taken Sgt. Bauer. Your bravery and courage will never be forgotten. i grew up and lived in NMB where your Inspector's Funeral was held at Fulford Methodist Church. I saw the helicopters in the air that day.

To think we couldn't say goodbye, Before you closed your eyes. No one can see us weeping, all our tears from aching hearts while other are sleeping. If we had one lifetime wish, A dream that could come true, We'd pray to God, With all our hearts, FOR YESTERDAY AND YOU\n\nCaroline Bauer\n\nWife\n\nWell Steve, It has been a long time. I remember a time when we talked of getting shot on duty and we never thought that it would really happen. We were the good guys, but it did happen. At work you were always one to make a joke, and one of the first to backup another officer.\n\nI know that you loved your family and always tried to do what you thought was right and for that you did good.\n\nAt your funneral, as I sat in the church, I felt the reality that you were not coming back. I could visualize you sitting above and telling everyone that you were fine, but that did not relieve the greif that those of us left behind felt.\n\nYou are in my thoughts and one day I will see you again.\n\nDet. Jim Waldron ( retired)\n\nfriend, North Miami Police Dept\n\nYou remain in my thoughts and heart. ...Forever Young (just like you said) Your heart was as huge as your smile!

Miami during Officer Bauer's service\n\nSteve . . . whenever I hear the song \"Forever Young\" I still think of you. Sunday night, as I read your name, along with the others, at the State FOP candlelight memorial ceremony at the Capitol, it occurred to me . . . you truly are forever young!\n\nSgt.
