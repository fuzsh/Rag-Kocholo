        "text": "Linda S. Bauer, 74, of River Edge, passed away on July 30, 2024. She is survived by her son Michael Bauer and his wife Pia, and cherished grandchildren Kai Michael Bauer (20 months) and newborn Marcus Drew Bauer, whom Linda met just days before she passed. Also survived by her sisters, Donna Castrignano and her husband Steve, and Denise Rosado. Predeceased by her husband Edwin Bauer (2010) and her son Marc Bauer (2019).\n\nLinda was born in Queens, NY to Nelson Rosado and Susan (née Russo). She worked in the Human Resources Department of Hudson City Savings Bank in Paramus.\n\nLinda will be remembered by family and friends for her boundless positive energy, selflessness, and countless acts of kindness. She was loved and relied-upon throughout Bergen County, providing many with jobs at the bank, window treatments and tailoring favors. She lived a full and joyful life, always embracing a “yes” mentality. Linda spent most of her time sewing, knitting, and crocheting, never once frowning or taking a moment to rest. She had a remarkable ability to make people feel welcomed and special, even if she had just met them for the first time. Linda never left the house without a smile on her face and her Dom DeLuise chocolate cake, a sweet reminder of her love for life and the joy she brought to everyone around her."
