        "text": "ABERDEEN, S.D. (Dakota News Now) - Although no new information has been released, authorities say they’ve received several tips related to the disappearance of Aberdeen native Morgan Bauer since the search of a property in Porterdale, Georgia, last week.\n\nAfter 19-year-old Bauer moved to the Atlanta area in February of 2016 and vanished just two weeks later, her case had very few new developments for more than seven years.\n\nThat changed last week when Sgt. Michael Walden of the Porterdale Police Department confirmed that a search of a property at 2 South Broad Street in Porterdale was in relation to Bauer’s case.\n\nOn Monday, Walden wrote on the Porterdale Police Department’s Facebook page that the investigation is continuing, and the department has received several tips and information thanks to media coverage of the search.\n\nWhen asked if this information meant another search of the property was being conducted, Porterdale Chief of Police Jason Cripps said no specific details could be given at this time.\n\nDakota News Now will continue to cover developments in Bauer’s case as more details are released."
