        "text": "00:00:00:00 - 00:00:19:18\n\nHelo Hancock\n\nNow let's meet the second candidate for Kootenai County Sheriff, Mike Bauer. Mike, thank you for joining us this evening. Why don't you take one minute and introduce yourself and explain to the audience why you're running for Kootenai County sheriff?\n\nMike Bauer\n\nSure. I'd be happy to. my name is Mike Bauer. I live in Harrison. I've been there for 13 years.\n\n00:00:19:20 - 00:00:41:04\n\nMike Bauer\n\nI'm a previous candidate for sheriff in 2020. I was a candidate for clerk in 2022. I ran successful in 2020. And, I saw that, this particular race had no opponent in the Republican primary. And I thought, well, I don't want Bob to have to take the whole summer off. I'll join it. I'll join in the fray.\n\n00:00:41:06 - 00:01:03:17\n\nMike Bauer\n\nHe knows me, I know him. I've watched his work over the last three years. Three and a half years that he's been the sheriff. I'm not displeased with it. I came up with a, a little saying, that, I stole from somebody else. Was to be a good sheriff. You have to be smart enough to do the job, but dumb enough to ask for it.\n\n00:01:03:19 - 00:01:27:00\n\nMike Bauer\n\nAnd Bob would appreciate that. my experience at the LA County Sheriff's Department, 33 years, very similar to his, but in a different generation when I joined the department. Bob was six years old. and so, anyway, I, I felt like it was, appropriate to get back, get in the race and discuss some issues for the public that may not have been discussed.\n\n00:01:27:02 - 00:01:54:10\n\nHelo Hancock\n\nOkay. Well, thank you. So we've got three questions. You'll have two minutes for each of these questions. And the first question we have for you, Mike, is as you probably know, Hayden City of Hayden is considering creating its own police force rather than having a contract, which they do now with the Kootenai County sheriff's office. What would you tell the residents of Hayden, about what you believe Hayden should do in this scenario?\n\n00:01:54:12 - 00:02:22:13\n\nMike Bauer\n\nYou know, I've spoken to a city council member who was concerned about whether or not the city could decide what the staffing level was, or whether the sheriff would impose a staffing level on them that that the sheriff wanted. And, I am not sure that that's resolved. I think it would be best for sheriff, to negotiate with the city council, to avoid the expense of a separate police department.\n\n00:02:22:18 - 00:02:57:13\n\nMike Bauer\n\nBut that's certainly there, right? let me say that some of the national standards for the proportion of population to police officers may not apply here. We may have a little different type of an environment. and, and so, my comments to that individual was that I, if I were elected sheriff, I would not require a staffing level that I would essentially have them assume responsibility for the safety level of their citizens in their city, and that I would honor their staffing level.\n\n00:02:57:15 - 00:03:29:11\n\nHelo Hancock\n\nOkay. So kind of a hybrid. great. So, Mike, the second question we have for our sheriff candidates this evening, is how do you view the role of the sheriff when working with other jurisdictions inside the county to promote public safety?\n\nMike Bauer\n\nThe sheriff should be a leader in the county. The sheriff, should have. If everything is, properly budgeted and staffed, should have, more resources than these other cities.\n\n00:03:29:11 - 00:04:03:06\n\nMike Bauer\n\nEspecially when you talk about natural disasters. You talk about, rescue, and you talk about, the, the, special, say special weapons teams, deployments and that sort of thing. And so it has to be a cooperative venture. I think, I think that, that that this the sheriff should be, have an open door policy for these cities and, and ask them, what can we do to make it make your life easier and what is it that your department needs?\n\n00:04:03:08 - 00:04:28:12\n\nMike Bauer\n\nIt's my theory that the Las Vegas, Metro Police Department, merger of the 70s is something that we may need to look at in this area. And I could see and I would look at if I were elected sheriff, if the budgets didn't hold, if we had financial problems, I would be very open to discussing with the city a merger between the sheriff of the city and a metropolitan Police Department here.\n\n00:04:28:14 - 00:04:53:20\n\nMike Bauer\n\nThat, has had some beneficial, financial outcome for, for the Las Vegas area, but, we may we may not have the political will for that here, but it's something that I would consider. in that case, they they use the sheriff, elected sheriff. They stayed with an elected official in charge of the county operation is Las Vegas.\n\n00:04:53:20 - 00:05:19:08\n\nMike Bauer\n\nMetro police Department is what it's called. My view is that Lee white certainly welcome to be the sheriff in charge of that. If he if if there were a merger to be done in the next four years.\n\nHelo Hancock\n\nOkay. Thank you. And the third question we have for you is, is really about the uniqueness of of the office and the political nature that it that it holds.\n\n00:05:19:09 - 00:05:57:20\n\nHelo Hancock\n\nObviously, the sheriff is an elected position. in your opinion, how far into the political realm should the sheriff go when it comes to campaigning and political party functions versus in the office, in uniform, out on the streets, type management and leadership?\n\nMike Bauer\n\nAnd let me say that I became aware in 2020 that the county has no employee political activity policy and that, concerned me because of some of the activities, of employees using county equipment to do political activity, something that's usually not acceptable in other areas.\n\n00:05:57:22 - 00:06:22:13\n\nMike Bauer\n\nMy, my comments, it's, effectively to, to Wolfinger at that time where this was probably inappropriate and I don't know whether it's continued or not. so one of my goals would be to establish, an employee political, activity policy. It could be very similar to what the state has the state has a very strict one in the county.\n\n00:06:22:13 - 00:06:44:03\n\nMike Bauer\n\nDoesn't have any at all, is my understanding. the sheriff was paid very well. The sheriff was, full time job. he should be doing his job. He shouldn't be out politicking. That should be on his off time. That should be weekends or nights or or that sort of thing. But, but it. Sheriff, and the certain levels, the FLSA exempt employee.\n\n00:06:44:03 - 00:07:07:04\n\nMike Bauer\n\nIt's no overtime. it's hard to hold somebody to that, eight hour a day work, but still, I think morally, as a sheriff, I owe the county my full time. And politicking is secondary. And in my opinion, if you're a member of the KCRCC and you're in good standing with them, you don't have to work that hard anyway.\n\n00:07:07:04 - 00:07:41:04\n\nMike Bauer\n\nAnd that's one of the reasons that I'm running, is because they have locked this down to the point where the voters can't express their frustration with what they see. In a, in a, in an election. And so they need there's way too many, unopposed candidates in this county, in my opinion. And that was one of the reasons that I got into this race was to try to give some opinion, give them a chance to express themselves about what they wanted for a sheriff.\n\n00:07:41:06 - 00:08:02:04\n\nHelo Hancock\n\nOkay, great. Well, we appreciate the answers, those questions. And now you'll have one minute to to share with the voters of Kootenai County. any final thoughts you have or a closing statement, what you would want them to know about why they should vote for you?\n\nMike Bauer\n\nLet me say that I didn't come here to say that Bob's not doing a good job.\n\n00:08:02:04 - 00:08:39:02\n\nMike Bauer\n\nI didn't come here to say that the sheriff's office, is in trouble. that's not my. That's not my intention, but my. But but I, I do know that I have probably three times the administrative experience that that that candidate had in 2020. And in that particular election, he won by 3000 votes in a very tight primary and was swept into office because I filed as an independent and KCRCC postcard of the county, you either vote for this guy or you are a rhino.\n\n00:08:39:04 - 00:09:01:02\n\nMike Bauer\n\nI. I just want the voters to know that if you're dissatisfied or you want to see a change, or you want somebody else as your sheriff, I'm available. and your other only other option is that you wait till November and you take a look at, Dan Wilson. And that's the only option that the voters have.\n\n00:09:01:04 - 00:09:19:14\n\nHelo Hancock\n\nWell, Mike, we really appreciate you being here this evening and and responding to the questions and telling the voters or about yourself and where you stand on some of these important issues that are that are in the minds of the citizens of Kootenai County. We appreciate you and and enjoy your responses. And thank you very much."
