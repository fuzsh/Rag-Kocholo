        "text": "Michael Francis “Mikey” Bauer, age 53 of Reedsburg, passed away unexpectedly on Thursday, October 17, 2019 while doing what he loved; hunting in Colorado with his best friends.\n\nMike was born on September 17, 1966 in Richland Center, Wisconsin, to parents Len and Erma (Wells) Bauer. He graduated from Weston High School in 1984 and went on to earn his B.S. in Business Administration at Cardinal Stritch. Mike was employed by Seats in Reedsburg for over 30 years, most recently as the Manufacturing Engineering Manager.\n\nMike was united in marriage to Lisa Herritz on May 23, 1991. He was a loving father to three children; Manda, Cameron, and Trevor and Papa to Braxton.\n\nMike was an avid hunter, passionate Badger and Packer fan, enjoyed participating in pool league, cooking for family and friends, and spending time “gardening” at what his friends jokingly called the garden bar. He was heavily involved in the Caz Turkey Busters, which is an organization that helps people in need in the greater Cazenovia area, provides scholarships, and works on various environmental projects.\n\nMike will be remembered for his huge heart, always willing to lend a hand, his humor, ability to always make everyone feel welcome, and his love of Bud Light.\n\nMike is survived by his wife of 28 years Lisa Bauer, children Manda (Bruce) Hansen, Cameron (Olivia) Bauer, Trevor (Elaine Wood) Bauer, grandson Braxton Bauer, parents Len and Erma Bauer, siblings Elaine (Ken) Nockerts, Steve Bauer, Joyce (Tim) Templin, Roger (Jen) Bauer, Rod (Amy Raspiller) Bauer, Sheila (Dennis) Pickel, Sharon Frey, Kathy (Rich Greenwood) Bauer, mother-in-law Mary Herritz, brother and sister-in-law Randy and Brenda Hoege, as well as many nieces, nephews, relatives and friends.\n\nMike is joined in heaven by his brother Phillip Bauer, nephew Danny Bauer, brother-in-law David “Frenchie” Frey, and father-in-law Ken Herritz.\n\nFuneral Services for Mike will be held Monday, October 28, 2019, at 11:00 am, at Farber Funeral Home, Reedsburg, with Reverend Paul Crolius officiating. Visitation will be on Sunday, October 27, 2019, from 3:00 pm until 7:00 pm, and on Monday from 10:00 am until the time of service at the funeral home. Private burial will take place at a later date at Greenwood Cemetery. In lieu of flowers, memorials can be made to the Caz Turkey Busters.\n\nFarber Funeral Home is assisting the family with arrangements."
