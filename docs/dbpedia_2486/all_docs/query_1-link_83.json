        "text": "RILEY - Mike Bauer, 66, of Riley passed away unexpectedly in his home on February 22, 2023. His passing was the result of CO2 poisoning after a fire started in his home.\n\nHe was born on Aug. 8, 1956, in Terre Haute, to Dorothy and Bill Bauer. He was a Navy veteran. He worked in the carpet industry for many years. Later, he worked for local clients in the Riley area. He worked so hard his entire life.\n\nHe was lovingly known as \"Pappidy Mike\" and \"Creek Freak\" by his family and friends. He was an avid outdoorsman who had so much love and respect for the environment. He watched the sunrise every morning, as it brought him joy. His favorite place on earth was kayaking down Sugar Creek with his family. He never met a stranger on the creek, and always helped direct kayaks in tight spots. He collected fossils for most of his life, and liked to make things with them for his loved ones. He was also an avid photographer and took the most beautiful photos. He had an amazing laugh and always lit up any room that he was in. He enjoyed many sports but loved USAC racing, Green Bay Packers football and IU basketball.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents and brother, Gary Bauer.\n\nHe is survived by his daughters, Jessica Bauer (Brian) and Ashley Bauer (Daniel); sister, Katrina (Jon) Watson; and brother, Karl Eric (Krista) Bauer. He has 4 grandkids, Madison Yockey and Phoenix, and Uriah and Stone Saenz. He had 2 great-grandsons. He loved his grandkids with all of his heart and was so happy to be called Pappidy. He is also survived by cousins, nieces, nephews and special friends.\n\nPer his wishes, a funeral will not be held. He chose to be cremated and have his ashes spread at Sugar Creek by his loved ones, while kayaking and celebrating his life.\n\nwww.debaunfuneralhomes.com"
