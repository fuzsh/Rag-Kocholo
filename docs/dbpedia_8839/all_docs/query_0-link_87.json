The Concordia football team opens its 2004 season with a 7:30 p.m. home game against Doane on Sept. 4 before traveling to Nebraska Wesleyan for a 6 p.m. game on Sept. 11.\n\nA combination of outstanding veterans and talented recruits provide optimism with 17 seniors providing a veteran leadership base for Concordia to build on 5-5 records racked up in both 2003 and 2002. A major goal will be to keep quarterback Kurt Earl healthy, a downfall last year when he was out four games with injuries. Meyer said a versatile and explosive offense with the Longmont, Colo., senior at the controls will challenge opposing defenses.\n\nThe inexperienced Bulldogs in 2003 lost five games in a row after winning the season opener, but came back to capture four in a row before losing the season finale.\n\nEleven teams will take the field this fall to compete for the Great Plains Athletic Conference crown. Defending champion Sioux Falls is preseason pick for No. 1 with the Bulldogs tabbed for an eighth-place finish. Northwestern and Midland Lutheran were the other top favorites.\n\n“We have a very solid offensive line that also has good size,” Meyer said of the unit anchored by All-GPAC Terrance Gillian, a senior from Lancaster, Texas. “We lack depth in the defensive line and at linebacker.”\n\nJunior running back Phillip Elder (Paris, Texas) will be back after being sidelined with a broken leg a year ago. The Bulldogs will be developing young fullbacks and receivers with Brent Tuxhorn, a sophomore from Auburn, Neb., and Duffy Davis, a junior from Ainsworth, Neb., hopefully responding to the challenge. Anthony Ogden, a three-year starter from Lincoln, Neb., is at cornerback and Meyer labels senior Nick Cavalliero (Mesa, Ariz.) the GPAC’s best safety with Albert Greenwood (Beaumont, Texas, senior) and Dominique Weatherspoon (Pineland, Texas, sophomore) contributing at cornerback. Senior Justin Hannemann of Lincoln, Neb., is strong at defensive end and Seth Clemmer (Brandon, Miss., junior), C.J. Rust (Geneva, Neb., senior), Jack Galusha (Fairmont, Neb., sophomore) and Jake Bauer (Lame Deer, Mont., junior) solid at linebacker.\n\nMike Voss, junior offensive lineman, Hanneman and Bauer earned GPAC honorable mention a year ago. The Bulldogs have seven returning starters on offense in Earl, Elder, Davis, Voss, Gillian, senior lineman Dennis Robbins (Alliance, Neb.) and senior tight end Aaron Caughey (Campbell, Neb.). The defense also brings back seven ’03 starters in Hanneman, Clemmer, Rust, Bauer, Ogden, Cavalliero and sophomore back Patrick Daberkow from Madison, Neb.\n\nThe team theme, “Fight for Your Brothers,” is from Nehemiah 4:14. Meyer sees the team preparing to embrace the theme with importance in their daily lives as well as for the competition on the football field.\n\nThe kicking game probably will be turned over to two freshmen, Cort Johnson (Amarillo, Texas) to handle the punting and Jim Niemczyk out of Lutheran North of St. Louis taking on place-kicking. Meyer labeled his class of 38 freshman as the best group of newcomers in numbers and quality that he has seen in four or five years.\n\n“It was a good year,” he said. Among them is Ed Bittick, who was named the best offensive back/receiver in Greater Houston All-Star Classic and was rated among the top five track sprinters in the Houston area; Matt Baller, a nose guard at Exeter-Milligan (Neb.) High School who participated in the Nebraska Eight-Man All-Star game; Samuel Meyer of Marcus High in Flower Mound, Texas, at offensive guard; Johan Stal, a wide receiver from Sweden; and JaMaine Lewis, running back from St. Louis. Jeff Neujahr, a transfer from Chadron State out of Gothenburg, Neb., also could make a difference at running back.\n\nBulldogs open season with 27-12 victory over Doane\n\n4 SEP 2004\n\nPhillip Elder exploded for a 70-yard touchdown run to put Concordia in front, 27-6, midway in the fourth quarter as Doane fell in the season opener for both teams. Tiger defensive back Quentin Bradley returned a fumble 72 yards in the final minutes to make the final 27-12 before a crowd of 3,121 at Seward on Sept. 4.\n\nConcordia marched to score on its opening drive with a bootleg pass from Kurt Earl to Aaron Caughey covering the final four yards. It was 7-6 at the half. Concordia covered 96 yards in 10 plays with Earl hitting Duffy Davis on a 37-yard pass for a score at 5:07 of the third quarter to make it 14-6.\n\nElder also scored on a two-yard run early in the fourth quarter. A late Doane threat was thwarted when defensive lineman Justin Hannemann gathered in a pass that bounced out of a Doane receiver’s hands when he was hit by Nick Cavalliero. The turnover inside the Concordia 20 set up Elder's long run. Jim Niemczyk kicked three extra points.\n\nThe Bulldogs dominated the stats with 24 first downs to 13 and 480 total yards of offense to 203 for the Tigers. Elder averaged 10.2 yards on 21 carries and Earl hit 13 of 22 passes for 173 yards. The Bulldogs held Jeff Luebbe, one of the 2003 GPAC rushing leaders, to 79 yards in 24 carries. Luebbe scored the first Doane TD on a three-yard run with 1:58 left in the first quarter. Coach Courtney Meyer added it was a bit surprising – and encouraging -- to see how the Bulldogs controlled the line of scrimmage most of the game. “It’s the best we have run the ball against Doane in the past seven years,” he said.\n\nThe Bulldogs played together on both sides of the ball and he was encouraged with their ability to play with poise and self-control in the second half. Elder showed he is a back to be reckoned with, he said, and his passion for the game was infectious for the team.\n\nOther plus points include the knowledge that quarterback Kurt Earl did not get sacked and the defense never gave up a big play, led by coverage by Cavalliero and Anthony Ogden.\n\nSophomore linebacker Jack Galusha had three solo tackles and eight assists to lead the defense in his first game and Meyer was pleased with the effort of linemen Hannemann and Seth Clemmer.\n\nElder gained 216 yards in 21 carries to lead the GPAC in rushing and Kellin Bretschneider had 39 in 12 tries. Duffy Davis caught six passes for 86 yards while Earl connected on 13 of 22 passes for 173 yards.\n\n”It boils down to a lot of people making strong contributions,” Meyer said, adding that T.C. Carter, a cornerback, and Steven Hambric, a safety, were among the freshmen getting into the action. His coordinators, Bill McAllister on offense and Tim Preuss on defense, did a great job of mixing calls to frustrate the Tigers.\n\nNebraska Wesleyan comes from behind for 31-24 victory\n\n11 SEP 2004\n\nNebraska Wesleyan, down by two touchdowns with nine minutes remaining, launched an aerial attack that earned a 31-24 GPAC victory at Lincoln on the night of Sept. 11.\n\nThe Wesleyan defense forced three Bulldog turnovers in the final seven minutes. Both teams are 1-1 in GPAC play.\n\nJim Niemcyzk's field goal opened the scoring at 10:36 on the Bulldogs' first possessions and Philip Elder's two-yard plunge on the next possession made it 10-0. Brent Tuxhort caught a 30-yard pass from Kurt Earl late in the first half, which ended at 17-7.\n\nElder broke loose for a 19-yard scoring run to make it 24-10 on the first series of the fourth quarter. Concordia, which didn't give up a turnover in the first three quarters, gave it up three times in the final seven minutes.\n\nA 26-yard TD pass from Danny Hansen to Tyler Gingery with 23 seconds remaining gave the Prairie Wolves the final lead. Gingery had three touchdowns on pass receptions.\n\nJack Galusha, Nate Weber and Jacob Bauer all had four tackles and two assists for the Bulldog defense with Bauer credited with two sacks.\n\nThe Bulldogs outgained Wesleyan in rushing, 206-112, but the Prairie Wolves were tops in passing, 267-208. Total yards found Concordia with 414 and NWU with 379.\n\nRust's TD on interception ignites 55-13 win over DWU\n\n28 SEP 2004\n\nIt took C.J. Rust only two minutes to set the tone in Concordia’s 55-13 victory over Dakota Wesleyan in a Great Plains Athletic Conference football game on a hot and breezy Sept. 18 in Seward.\n\nThe senior linebacker from Geneva, Neb., intercepted a Derek Falor tipped pass on the Tigers’ fifth play of the game and returned it 19 yards for a touchdown. It was the first of four Tiger passes the Bulldogs picked off during the afternoon game that left them with a 2-1 record for the season and in the GPAC. Two additional turnovers on fumbles contributed to the third straight loss for DWU, two in GPAC play. It was 21-7 at half.\n\nAlthough the Tigers controlled the ball for 34 minutes, the Bulldogs made the most of the 26 minutes they had possession.\n\nConcordia came out of the DWU game without any major injuries, although fans suffered a scare when quarterback Kurt Earl was sidelined midway in the first quarter as stitches were required to close a laceration on the finger of his left hand. There was more good news as safety Nick Cavalliero’s brace allowed him to play with his leg injury.\n\nWide receiver Duffy Davis and safety Dominique Weatherspoon are expected to be ready for action next week at Sioux Falls.\n\nCoach Courtney Meyer was pleased with the Bulldog running offense as they gained 343 yards in 54 carries. Philip Elder was over the 100-yard mark by one in 20 carries as he scored three touchdowns and picked up an extra point when he fell on a blocked kick in the end zone. Kevin Bretschneider was close behind with 92 yards in 14 carries and JaMaine Lewis averaged 21.3 yards in three carries. “The defense creating turnovers speaks volumes to how we’re playing,” Meyer said.\n\nA punt blocked by Steve Hambric on the first series of the second half set up an Elder eight-yard TD run that spread the margin to 28-7. Meyer was pleased with the discipline and poise shown by the Bulldogs after the disappointing 31-24 last-minute loss to Nebraska Wesleyan the previous week.\n\nAfter Rust’s opening TD, Dakota Wesleyan made it 8-7 with 9:39 left in the half on Falor’s one-yard plunge. It was set up by a fumble recovery at the Bulldog 33 and interrupted only by a Hambric pass interception and fumble.\n\nConcordia responded with a 75-yard march with the TD coming on a fourth-and-nine play at the Tiger 28 on a pass from Earl to Zach Davis at 5:41. On the next series, Concordia moved 83 yards with a 33-yard Earl to Jeff Neujahr pass play to the DWU two. That set up Bretschneider’s TD plunge at 1:37. Falor’s 22-yard pass to Aaron James capped a 73-yard touchdown drive with 7:32 left in the third period.\n\nEd Bittick recovered a Tiger fumble at the Bulldog 25 and fought his way to the DWU nine. Two rushes by Neujahr, the last for three yards, put the ball in the end zone with 2:32 left in the period to make it 35-13.\n\nAlbert Greenwood brought a pass he intercepted back 31 yards to the Wesleyan 15 .Three plays later Elder scored from three yards out . Another Elder three-yard TD run capped a 49-yard drive midway through the fourth quarter.\n\nCasey Makey’s interception of a Falor pass at the Bulldog 20 set up the final Concordia touchdown, a 13-yard run by JaMaine Lewis with 3:16 remaining. Justin Hannemann added six extra-point conversions for the Bulldogs.\n\nThe Bulldogs rushed for 343 yards compared to 159 for DWU and led in first downs, 20-17. The Tigers connected on 12 of 29 passes for 148 yards compared to four of 10 for 90 yards for Concordia. Total offensive yards found the Bulldogs best, 433 to 307.\n\nNAIA #2 Sioux Falls wins 27th straight, 30-13 over Bulldogs\n\n25 SEP 2004\n\nJoe Wright connected with Charles Johnson on a 42-yard pass play with 13 seconds left to make it 20-13 at half and NAIA #2 Sioux Falls added 10 for a 30-13 GPAC victory on Sept. 25 at Sioux Falls.\n\nBulldog freshman Ed Bittick returned the opening kickoff 95 yards to put Concordia on the scoreboard, but the Cougars came back with scoring pass plays of 54 and 91 yards to lead, 13-7, at the end of the first quarter.\n\nConcordia scored on a 12-yard pass from Kurt Earl to Duffy Davis at 9:19 of the second quarter to cap a 70-yard drive but failed to convert the extra point.
