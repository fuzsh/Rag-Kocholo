        "text": "The Winters Brothers Biography\n\nVeteran Southern Rockers, Dennis and Donnie Winters, were both born in southern Florida and moved to the hills of Tennessee at a very young age. And for the last three decades, band leader Dennis Winters has carried on the legacy of The Winters Brothers Band. When the band begins a performance, you feel the commitment all the way to the soul. Their electricity excites everyone around, and their professional experience shines through with ease. Dennis Winters is the third generation of musicians in his family.\n\nHis grandfather \"Pop\" Winters began the \"picking\" tradition. His band \"The Southern Strollers,\" were performing and recording in the late 40's. His father Don Winters, Sr., had a successful career on his own with recordings on RCA and DECA Records. He was also a part of The Marty Robbins Show. During his 23 years with Marty, he was part of the band, the trio, and a featured solo artist. With music in his blood it just comes natural for Dennis. The Winters Brothers first album was appropriately called \"The Winters Brothers Band.\" It was released on ATCO/Atlantic Records and earned the band acceptance around the world. It featured the songs, \"I Can't Help It\", \"Smoky Mountain Log Cabin Jones\" and \"Shotgun Rider.\" \"Sang Her Love Songs\" was later recorded live at the Volunteer Jam (which was an event hosted by the Charlie Daniels Band), and is featured on the Volunteer Jams III and IV album, an EPIC Records release. Their second album on ATCO/Atlantic Records was \"Coast to Coast\" and was held back due to legal complications. On EPIC Records, Charlie Daniels Band Volunteer Jam VI, the brothers recorded their song \"Rich Kids.\" In the early 80's, brother Donnie left the band to pursue a solo career. He returned for a short stay to work on third album \"Keep On Runnin\" released on StarTrack Records based in Nashville, TN. The band then took a break from touring while Dennis went to work for Waylon Jennings. Inspired by David Corlew, Charlie Daniels Band manager, to release another Southern Rock album, Dennis began writing new songs for their first release in 10 years, appropriately titled \"Southern Rockers,\" released on SouthStarRecords. This CD features 8 new southern rock songs and 4 originals from the first album that were recorded live in Nashville on November 27, 1999. All songs were written and produced by Dennis Winters and his brother for SouthStarRecords and received great reviews and picked up air play across the world. Shortly thereafter, Donnie left the band for a career in recording engineering. The Winters Brothers Band is noted for their high energy, electrifying, live performances, loaded with soulful jams and nonstop excitement. Headlining countless shows, they are the most proud of their charity work, which has gained them respect around the world. Some of these include Farm Aid, Department of Human Services to raise funds for Abused Children, American Veterans, Muscular Dystrophy Association and many, many more. They were awarded the status of Tennessee Colonels by their home state for their charity work. As well as headlining they have toured with and played on the same bill with such acts as Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Allman Brothers Band, The Charlie Daniels Band, The Marshall Tucker Band, Molly Hatchet, 38 Special, Outlaws, Bob Seger, Jimmy Buffett, Grinderswitch, Bonnie Bramlett, Wet Willie, Blackfoot, Stillwater, Pure Prairie League, Firefall, Sea Level, Dixie Dreggs, Atlanta Rhythym Section, Elvin Bishop, Delbert McClinton, Neil Young, John Mellencamp and many, many more. Longtime friend and guitarist extraordinnaire Jaime LaRitz joined the band and, with Dennis, co-produced the band's 5th release \"Southwest Stampede\" in 2004 for SouthStarRecords. The album has received excellent sales and reviews and has been penned in Europe as the \"Sgt Pepper's of Southern Rock.\" The band is enjoying a very successful recording and touring career, currently working on a new blues cd and a \"live\" cd for SouthStarRecords, as well as the re-release of The Winters Brothers Band original LP on CD. The Winters Brothers Band current lineup consists of Chad Booher from Bristol, TN on drums, Ricky Burke from Springfield, TN on bass and backup vocals and Jaime LaRitz from Nashville, TN on lead, slide and backup vocals.\n\nThe newest members of the Winters Brothers Band is the harmonic sound of \"The Southern Belles,\" Casey, Cody, and Carly Winters. That's right! A new generation of the Winters singing back up, and appearing on select shows. Make sure you check out the excellent work they did on \"Tasty\" from the Southern Rockers CD and their stellar vocals on the Southwest Stampede CD. The three sisters are featured performers on the bands \"live\" shows. The Winters Brothers Band Annual Southern Summer Jam was held every June, the day before Father's day on the family's farm located in Nolensville, TN. The 30th Annual ( and final) Southern Summer Jam was held in June 2009. The Winters Brothers Band's CD's and live performances are in the style you are accustomed to hearing, a true southern \"Jammin\" experience for dedicated and new fans alike. Beginning with The Allman Brothers and continuing through the years with top selling bands like Lynyrd Skynyrd, Marshall Tucker and Charlie Daniels, the South has maintained a reputation for producing some of the hottest bands in the country. Following a family tradition, this includes The Winters Brothers Band. Dennis can also take credit for writing many of Marty Robbins songs"
