        "text": "Julie Ann Mills was born April 30, 1963 in Orange, California with Arthrogryposis, a birth defect that has left her without the use of her hands and limited use of her legs. Julie began mouth painting at the age of 3. She enjoys painting animals and nature scenes in watercolors. She has shown her work at craft fairs, Art Galleries and in several group exhibitions in Eugene, Oregon where she now resides with her two children.\n\nPictured above: “Bridge in Autumn ” by Mills-Testi.\n\nGlenDick always loved nature and drawing. He studied at Temple University, where he earned a degree in landscape architecture. One year later, in 1995, Glen broke his neck in an accident, paralyzing him from the chest down.\n\nSince his accident, Glen has taught himself to paint with his mouth, concentrating his artwork on the beauty and solace he finds in nature, and the wonder of seeing it through his daughter’s eyes.\n\n“Glen is an advocate for disability education, and recently published a children’s book: “We Can Go Anywhere: My Adventures on Daddy’s Chair.” Glen currently lives outside of Philadelphia with his wife and daughter\n\nGlen is became a student member of the Association of Mouth and Foot Painting Artists in 2019.\n\nPictured above: “A Walk in the Snow” by Dick.\n\nBelinda Jacay was born in 2006 in a small town in the Andes of Peru called Tarma.
