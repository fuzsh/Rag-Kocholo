        "text": "On Saturday, May 11, Garth Brooks has quite a gig lined up.\n\nThat evening, the “Friends In Low Places” crooner is slated to perform in Vatican City for Pope Francis.\n\nHe’ll be joined by Super Bowl-winning quarterback — and recent roast subject — Tom Brady on the trip, who is speaking at a Vatican roundtable on sports.\n\nAfter that high-profile set, the 62-year-old Brooks will return to Sin City and pick up his ongoing ‘Plus One’ residency at Las Vegas’ Caesars Palace’s 4,000-seat Colosseum which resumes in late June.\n\nFrom there, he’ll headline 26 more concerts at the venue — and at one festival in Panama City Beach, FL this summer — all the way up until December of this year.\n\nAnd if you happen to see him twice at the Colosseum, it won’t be the worst thing in the world.\n\nAt all shows, Brooks mixes things up to make sure every concert is different from the last.\n\n“The Garth crowd is the best crowd in the world to play for,” the 62-year-old crooner told ABC7. “They’ll let us fail, they’ll let us try things. That’s why I love coming to Vegas because here, even though each show is in the same place, each show does not have to be the same.”\n\nIf this sounds like the show for you, it isn’t too late to score seats for all upcoming ‘Plus One’ concerts.\n\nAt the time of publication, the lowest price we could find was $112 before fees on Vivid Seats.\n\nOther shows have tickets starting anywhere from $113 to $274 before fees.\n\nWant to find the concert that makes the most sense for your schedule?\n\nWe’ve got everything you need to know and more about Garth Brooks’ ‘Plus One’ Las Vegas residency below.\n\nAll prices listed above are subject to fluctuation.\n\nGarth Brooks ticket prices 2024\n\nA complete calendar including all Colosseum show dates, start times and links to the cheapest tickets available can be found here:\n\n(Note: The New York Post confirmed all above prices at the publication time. All prices are in US dollars, subject to fluctuation and include additional fees at checkout.)\n\nVivid Seats is a verified secondary market ticketing platform, and prices may be higher or lower than face value, depending on demand.\n\nThey offer a 100% buyer guarantee that states your transaction will be safe and secure and your tickets will be delivered prior to the event.\n\nKickoff Jam 2024\n\nIn addition to the Vatican City and Las Vegas shows, Brooks has also been tapped to perform at the 2024 Kickoff Jam in Panama City Beach, FL, taking place July 30 through Aug. 1.\n\nHe’ll be joined by fellow big names Carrie Underwood, Alabama, Randy Travis, Rhett Akins and Randy Houser at the three-day extravaganza.\n\nWant to go?\n\nYou can grab three-day Kickoff Jam passes here.\n\nGarth Brooks set list\n\nAs we mentioned above, Brooks takes pains to ensure no two shows are the same.\n\nSo, while the set list from Set List FM below may not be what you hear when you see Brooks live, it should give you a good idea of what to expect:\n\n01.) “Three Wooden Crosses” (Randy Travis cover)\n\n02.) “Rocket Man (I Think It’s Going to Be a Long, Long Time)” (Elton John cover)\n\n03.) “Rodeo”\n\n04.) “Two of a Kind, Workin’ on a Full House” (Dennis Robbins cover)\n\n05.) “Two Piña Coladas”\n\n06.) “Much Too Young (to Feel This Damn Old)”\n\n07.) “The River”\n\n08.) “Night Moves” (Bob Seger & the Silver Bullet Band cover)\n\n09.) “That Summer”\n\n10.) “Turn the Page” (Bob Seger cover)\n\n11.) “The Thunder Rolls”\n\n12.) “New Way to Fly”\n\n13.) “Unanswered Prayers”\n\n14.) “Shallow” (Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper cover)\n\n15.) “Golden Ring” (George Jones & Tammy Wynette cover)\n\n16.) “Whiskey to Wine”\n\n17.) “She’s in Love With the Boy” (Trisha Yearwood cover)\n\n18.) “Callin’ Baton Rouge” (The Oak Ridge Boys cover)\n\n19.) “Papa Loved Mama”\n\n20.) “Shameless” (Billy Joel cover)\n\n21.) “Shout” (The Isley Brothers cover)\n\n22.) “The Dance” (Tony Arata cover)\n\nEncore\n\n23.) “Piano Man” (Billy Joel cover)\n\n24.) “You Never Even Call Me by My Name” (Steve Goodman cover)\n\n25.) “Friends in Low Places” (Dewayne Blackwell cover)\n\n26.) “Standing Outside the Fire”\n\nGarth Brooks new music\n\nOn Nov. 7, 2023 Brooks released his 17th studio album “Time Traveler” through Bass Pro Shops.\n\nComprised of ten tracks, the record is a boot-scootin’ good time that should have you line dancing in no time.\n\nIf you want to hear the upbeat lead single “Rodeo Man,” you can find it at Amazon Music.\n\nTo buy the album, you’ll have to purchase the CD in person at Bass Pro Shops.\n\nGarth Brooks’ “Plus One” residency details\n\nBrooks’ “Plus One” residency will be more intimate than his typical stadium shows.\n\nAt each performance, Brooks is mostly taking the stage by himself. He won’t fully go it alone, though. On select tracks, his band will join him during the set. Otherwise, they’ll be sitting in the audience.\n\nThat doesn’t mean the show won’t be an ambitious thrill ride.\n\n“There’s those songs that you put the windows down and you turn the radio up kind of thing. I love that,” he said. “I (also) want it to get really quiet, right? You want it to get really loud, and then, hopefully, what happens is these people feel like they’ve just been through a hurricane at the end of the show.”\n\nTo hear the Brooks himself explain what he has planned for his unique Caesars show — appearances from his wife Trisha Yearwood, new music and more — check out his seven-minute Good Morning America interview from 2022 below.\n\nOther huge Las Vegas concerts in 2024\n\nLas Vegas residencies don’t just happen.\n\nOne has to be a truly established artist with a well-known body of work to sell out concerts on the Vegas Strip continually.\n\nHere are just five of the biggest residencies from household names with huge hits you’ll want to sing along to when they play in the Entertainment Capital of the World.\n\n• Shania Twain\n\n• Dead and Company\n\n• Carrie Underwood\n\n• Adele\n\n• Bruno Mars\n\nNot going to be in Sin City this year? Take a look at our list of the 50 biggest country stars on tour in 2024 to find the show for you.\n\nWhy you should trust ‘Post Wanted’ by the New York Post"
