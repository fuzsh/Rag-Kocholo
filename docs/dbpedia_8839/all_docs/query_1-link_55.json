        "text": "Jason’s wrestling story starts in 1st grade when he brought a flier home from school. His dad quickly recognized his ambition and talent. He took Jason around the country competing. He became the first RMN Triple Crown winner- he credits this to attending all the camps, practices, and tournaments Utah had to offer. At the time, Utah had a lot of programs that were very encouraging and accepting of him splitting his time between them. He attended Devils Den, Treehouse Athletic Club, Specialize, and multiple other Utah youth programs before eventually joining Vandit, ran by Gabe Vigil. Jason attended Springville High School and is a proud Red Devil, coached by Justin Judkins. His high school accomplishments are as impressive as they are lengthy. A career high for him was becoming a 4-time state champion. His record was 191-2 with 98 career pins. Jason won multiple National Championships in all three styles and was the Dave Schultz National Award winner. He was on The Dapper Dan and US Dream Team.\n\nAt Vandit, Gabe was a big influence in choosing his alma mater, Boise State University.\n\nAt Boise State, Jason became the first freshman ever to become a then Pac-10, now Pac-12 Champion. He went on to win 2 more conference championships. He was a 4x NCAA qualifier. In 2011 he became an All-American placing 3rd. His senior season he made it to the NCAA Finals and finished runner-up. As Jason worked on his college career and academics- he also wrestled the Freestyle circuit. He finished top 6 at the Olympic Trials. He made two U20 World Teams and a U23 World Team, his best finish was 5th place at the World Championships. He hit a goal of 100+ college wins and was Pac-12 Athlete of the Year. He contributes a lot of his success to his coaches Greg Randall, Chris Owens, and Kirk White.\n\nAfter Boise, he continued wrestling at the Nebraska Wrestling Training Center. He won the Pan Am Championship and medaled in various National and International competitions. Nebraska helped him realize his love of coaching.\n\nIn 2016, he landed a job at Fresno State University as an assistant coach under Troy Steiner. He helped coach multiple athletes to All-American achievements and success on and off the mat. There he continued his competitive career training at The Valley Regional Training Center. In 2018 he won The US Open Championship and World Team Trials. He wrestled in the Final X, making the USA National team as the alternate. After the pandemic, Fresno State dropped its program.\n\nJason’s dream has always been to coach in his home state and share with the community the knowledge he has gained throughout his career.\n\nJason coached at UVU from 2021-2022. He decided to step away from the wrestling life and has been successful in a new career path. Of course, he couldn’t completely stay away and continues to coach youth wrestlers both new and elite. Hoping to help as many wrestlers and programs as he can.\n\nJason says his greatest accomplishment is the life he shares with his wife, Abbey, and their children Violet, Kitt, and Jaylen.\n\nBrock Moore’s wrestling journey began on the mats of Pleasant Grove’s Little Mountain Grapplers Wrestling program. It was here that the foundations of his passion for the sport were laid by hall of fame coach Norm Sanderson, igniting a flame that would burn bright through the years. The lessons learned during those formative years would serve as the bedrock for his future success.\n\nBrock was a state champion at Pleasant Grove High School coached by the hall of fame great, Darol Henry. He continued to a higher level of competition at Northwest College in Powell, Wyoming providing him with new challenges and opportunities to showcase his talent. His journey also included a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Chicago, Illinois. This period of service further enriched his character, instilling values of humility, compassion, and community spirit qualities that would define his coaching philosophy.\n\nMoore earned a Bachelor's Degree in Physical Education from Southern Utah University and a Master's Degree in Education Technology from Grand Canyon University. Throughout his educational journey, Moore never strayed far from the wrestling mat. He served as an assistant wrestling coach at Orem High School while attending Utah Valley University, and later continued his coaching legacy as an assistant at Cedar City High School during his time at Southern Utah University.\n\nMoore's coaching prowess truly blossomed during his tenure at Pleasant Grove High School. As both a teacher and wrestling coach, his impact was undeniable. As a teacher, he was recognized earning the SHAPE-Utah Physical Education Teacher of the Year, The Best of Alpine award for outstanding service, and the UAHPERD Secondary Physical Education Teacher of the Year. He coached several state championship weightlifting teams and individuals. He is a Silver Level USA wrestling coach. The Vikings wrestling team soared under his guidance, securing an astounding total of 12 team state championships, more than 600 dual match wins, many sectional and regional titles, along with numerous individual All-Americans and state titles. He also was voted region and state Coach of the Year a great number of times. In 2013 he was named the West Sectional Coach of the Year, and in 2021 Moore received the Distinguished Service Award for his outstanding contributions as 6A Coach of the Year in all sports. His ability to mentor and shape young athletes into champions was a testament to his commitment to the sport and his students' growth.\n\nTom Ramage was born on a farm .4 miles south of Price, Utah where he grew up and attended school. Tom got a taste for wrestling in junior high when wrestling coach, Nick Caputo, saw him wrestling in PE class and encouraged him to try out for the team. Tom won his first heavyweight wrestling championship that same year at Price Junior High.\n\nTom attended Carbon High School where he lettered in track, baseball, football and wrestling. He won the Utah AAU heavyweight championship in Salt Lake City his junior year of high school. Due to family conflicts, he was unable to defend his championship title his senior year.\n\nTom was awarded a football scholarship at Utah State University where he continued to wrestle in the off-season. Tom wrestled at Utah State University for 4 years and never missed a meet. His senior year, he was awarded the Eddie Peterson Award for best multi-sport athlete and was an Honorable Mention All American in football. Tom was drafted into the NFL by the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nUpon graduation from Utah State University, Tom began his coaching career. He became the wrestling, track and football coach at Bear River High School. He also began to officiate wrestling and did so for 20 years at dual meets, tournaments and state championship matches.\n\nTom was named head wrestling coach for Utah State University from 1963, where he coached for 4 years. During that time, he helped to form the Mountain Intercollegiate Wrestling Association. Tom hit the recruiting circuit hard, recruiting and coaching notable wrestlers such as Tom Foster, Bob Broughton and Ron McBride, just to name a few. Under his leadership, his teams grew better and stronger every year. In 1965, Utah State University qualified 6 wrestlers for the NCAA National Wrestling Tournament, where they placed 6th as a team.\n\nToday, Tom and his wife of over 60 years, Winona, live in Orem, Utah, where he remains an avid fan of the sport of wrestling. He has passed his passion to his sons and grandsons who he has enjoyed watching as they continue his legacy.\n\nCandace Workman began wrestling when she was seven years old and immediately fell in love with the sport. She stated out winning a junior high state title then compiled seven age group national titles and numerous All-American Honors, all before entering high school. She wrestled for Uintah High School where she became a trailblazer for women’s wrestling in Utah by placing 3rd at Region and 6th at State her sophomore year. She was the Region 10 champion both her junior and senior year. She made history in 2008 by becoming the first female to advance to the UHSAA State Wrestling Finals. She was selected to the 2008 Asics Girls High School All American Wrestling Team. She was a two time Jr. Nationals Freestyle finalist, a FILA Juniors National Champion and a four time Rocky Mountain Nationals Champion.\n\nIn 2009, Candace was the recipient of the BJ Stupak Olympic Scholarship where she attended the United States Olympic Education Center at Northern Michigan University. The following year she transferred to the United States Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs where she began training as a full time resident athlete for USA Wrestling where she remained through 2016. She was a University National Champion in 2011, a United States Olympic Trials Qualifier Champion in 2012, she placed 4th at the 2013 World Team Trials, 4th at the US Open National Championships as well as winning her second University National Championship in 2013- making the University World Team. She placed 7th at 2015 Senior Nationals, and in 2016 Candace placed fourth at the USA Olympic Team Trials. She is extremely grateful for the opportunities she has had to travel the world internationally representing USA Wrestling and Titan Mercury Wrestling Club.\n\nIn 2017, Candace returned to Vernal to help maintain the strong Uintah Wrestling tradition and give back to the community that has supported her throughout her wrestling career. She is the head coach of the Uintah Wrestling Club and is an assistant coach for the Uintah Jr. High and Uintah High School programs. In 2019 Candace was given the opportunity to coach the USA Wrestling Cadet Women’s PanAm Team which brought home the gold team title. She looks forward to continuing her coaching career for Uintah, Utah and USA Wrestling. “As a kid, I never really thought of myself as a ‘girl’ wrestler, I always just wanted to be a wrestler. Now as a coach, I don’t really think of myself as a ‘girl’ coach. I am a coach who happens to be a girl.\" –Candace Workman\n\nSanderson was born in Pleasant Grove, UT. He started wrestling in 9th grade during Darold Henry’s rookie coaching year. He was a member of Pleasant Grove’s first two state championship teams. He wrestled at BYU where he was a WAC Champion. He was a 3X NCAA Qualifier. At that time, the NCAA only placed 6 wrestlers. By today’s standards, Steve would have been a NCAA All-American.\n\nDuring his early years, Steve helped his father as an official for the United States Wrestling Federation and developed a love for coaching while helping young wrestlers at his father's club, the Little Mountain Grapplers. He built programs where ever he was. Sanderson is most known for building the wrestling programs at Viewmont High School, Wasatch High School, and Altamont High School. His teams at Wasatch were ranked top 5 in the nation from 1993 through 1997 (USA Today). During that time, Wasatch was the only public high school in the top 5. Steve also played a major role in 2 other of Wasatch’s top 10 teams (2004 and 2005).\n\nSanderson helped over 100 young men across the top of the podium at the Utah State tournament including his four sons who won 14 individual state titles, 6 trips to the NCAA finals, and earned 8 NCAA designations as NCAA All-Americans. His son, Cael, won the Olympic Gold Medal in the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Greece. All of Steve’s sons are now wrestling coaches: Cael and Cody at Penn State University, Cole and South Summit High School and Cyler at Sanderson Wrestling Academy.\n\nSteve spent 30+ years providing wrestling opportunities for Utah wrestlers as the State Director, National Teams Director, and Kids Divisional Director for USA Wrestling – Utah. Sanderson was presented with numerous Coach of the Year Awards, was inducted into the UWCA Hall of Fame in 2008 and inducted into the Utah Sports Hall of Fame in 2011. In 2019, the NHSCA presented him with Thomas Joseph Marquis Award.\n\nSteve has always had a way of instilling confidence in his wrestlers. Many have said with him in their corner they felt like they could beat anyone. Sanderson was always looking for a better way, or better technique. He always carried a notebook to tournaments and clinics. His family often teased him for arriving at championship events early in order to watch how the athletes warmed up. His room was always open to any wrestlers who wanted to get better. In Steve’s coaching career, he has had the opportunity to coach thousands of athletes. He taught them single legs and double legs, but more importantly he taught them to be good people, to be strong, to work hard and to never give up. As God looks down, I am confident, that He looks down on Steve with joy and great pride. Not because of his success as a coach, but because he has spent life serving and building young men.\n\nToby Tobiasson's wrestling pedigree began when the country boy came to town in 1962 to start high school and graduated in 1966. He realized he was ill-prepared to play basketball but recognized that throwing critters and wrestlers were similar. This set his path for the next fifty years.\n\nAfter a respectable high school wrestling career, Toby began refereeing high school wrestling in Colorado in 1975, eventually becoming an Area Director for high school officials. He continued to referee high school wrestling for approximately forty years in Colorado, New Mexico and Utah.\n\nToby began coaching Folkstyle, Freestyle and Greco Roman club wrestling in 1981. As time passed he began refereeing local USA Wrestling tournaments. This progressed to working regional and national events as well.

After a contentious time in the National Leadership of the United States Wrestling Official's Association (USWOA), Toby ran for election as Secretary to the Executive Board. He served in that capacity for 14 years from 2006 until his retirement in 2019.\n\nToby has received several national level accolades including the Outstanding Official at Cadet Nationals, the Outstanding Greco Official at Cadet National Duals, The Outstanding Greco Official at Junior National Duals, the Glen Blackman Award for outstanding up and coming official, the Phil Portuese Award for outstanding USWOA trainer and mentor, the USWOA Official of the Year and the Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nMike Ripplinger was born April of 1955 in Driggs, Idaho and started wrestling in the 6th grade where he would practice for 2 weeks during the year with a small tournament at the end.

Upon his return from his mission Mike wrestled at Ricks College and placed 3rdat Regionals and 4that the Junior College Nationals. Upon graduating from Ricks College Mike married Tracey and have been happily married every since.\n\nMike’s next wrestling venture placed him at Weber State wrestling for their team, he wrestled 2 years for the Division 1 program and then worked as a student trainer and coach at Weber State as a graduate assistant. Mike then landed an assistant coaching job at Alta High School in Utah for one year and then was offered the head coaching job at Box Elder High School. In his first year at Box Elder they finished 7th in the state which was the 1984-1985 year. In 1987 and 1988 Box Elder finished 2nd in state and in 1989 Box Elder won their first state title under Coach Mike Ripplinger stopping Brighton’s string of 10 consecutive state titles. Again in 1999, 2000 and 2001 Box Elder won 3 more state titles and finished runner ups 3 more years preceding that. Mike added another 2 state titles and 6 more runner up finishes after 2002 to his resume.\n\nOver Mike’s coaching year’s Box Elder won 25 region titles, 6 state titles, and 13 runner up finishes. Mike has coached 58 state champions, 64 second place winners and overall 298 placers which is an average of 8.7 placers per year and 19 All Americans. He was also voted coach of the year 7 times and National Coach of the Year in 2005. Mike is one of Utah’s finest coaches and has built Box Elder to be a state power in his time.\n\nRobert Steele was first introduced to wrestling when his older brother came home from high school and said he wanted to join the wrestling team. Robert's first match was at BYU at a freestyle tournament in 7th grade where he placed third and loved the sport ever since.\n\nIn high school he placed third in State his Junior year for Orem High school under coach Fred Rowland. The summer between his Junior and Senior year he traveled with the USA Utah wrestling team as they went to Mexico City for the Jr Olympics where he placed third. During his senior year he won the 4A state championship at 167 lbs with a 51-0 record.\n\nRobert loved playing football and wrestling. He was offered a football scholarship to Snow College after being an All-State linebacker. He accepted the opportunity and competed in both football and wrestling. While a Freshman, he placed third in the Western Regionals in Phoenix which qualified him for Nationals where he also finished third. Robert finished his Sophomore year 35-1 losing in the Championship match. After Snow College Robert went to BYU where he was a two-time WAC champion. His Senior year he was the Western Region Champion.\n\nRobert started his coaching career at Payson High school. He was there for 5 years and coached 3 individual state champions. In 1987 Robert accepted a coaching position at Orem High school, his alma mater. He coached for 15 more years and coached three State Team championships (1994, 1995, 1996) and 11 individual champions.\n\nWrestling has been a huge part of Robert's life. Along the way he married his high school sweet heart Laurel Carlile. They have seven children and 12 grandchildren. Robert would like to thank his high school sweetheart for allowing him to spend so much time with wrestling.\n\nAs a child, Jeff found happiness in sports and became a great gymnast. During the off-season he looked for a sport that helped him keep in shape for gymnastics. Wrestling was that sport. He soon found that, in fact, he was a better wrestler than he was gymnast.\n\nWhile attending Yuma High School in Arizona, Jeff was a 4-time letterman in gymnastics and 2-time letterman in wrestling. He won two state championships in Arizona and was recognized as the top athlete at Yuma High for his accomplishments in gymnastics and wrestling. His athletic accomplishments earned him a scholarship to the University of Utah where he wrestled.\n\nIn 1967, Jeff won the Western Regional Olympic Trials in San Diego, CA. He was the first wrestler from Utah to do so. During the Preliminary Olympic Trails, he broke his collarbone and separated his sternum in a match against Richard Sophman who was the 1960 and 1964 Olympic bronze medalist. The injury ended his run at the 1968 Olympics.\n\nIn 1975, Jeff began working to organize the Sundance Wrestling Club. He donated a tremendous amount of time and money to kids from all over in order to promote and support the sport of wrestling. With Bill Killpack by his side, the two grew the club into a successful organization. Bill and his son eventually took over the club with Jeff’s vision for the future in mind. Many high schools have an affiliation with Sundance Wrestling Club and the legacy of Jeff Winderlin.\n\nSports were a very big part of Ross’ High School experience. Ross played football for 3 of his four years and was voted a captain of the football team his senior year. However, Ross’ true love was the sport of wrestling where he excelled placing high in the California CIF sports program and received a scholarship offer to Brigham Young University.\n\nWith three young boys in the home, Ross would love to wrestle with his sons on the living room floor.
