        "text": "Some other consideration’s for Portage County’s greatest athlete:\n\nFOOTBALL\n\n@winVikings: Dakoda Miller (RB, OLB, KR) of Waterloo. The kid never left the field and played every play at 100 mph. One of the most coachable kids I’ve ever had the pleasure to mentor.\n\n@ThomRosato: Chuck Moore (1996) of Mogadore. Hurt his knee in the (playoff) semifinals and still played at a high level in state game. Maybe the greatest RB in Portage County history. Went on to win national championship at Mount Union and Gagliardi Trophy as well.\n\n@h3ftyl3fty: I played with (Mogadore’s) Chuck Moore and Tommy Lee is my brother, and I can’t pick one between them. I compare Chuck to Michael and Tommy to LeBron. Chuck’s the most intense competitor I’ve ever been around and Tommy’s the most gifted freak athlete I was around.\n\n@mnutter: Tommy Lee was so dominant! In league games, it was an automatic 4 to 5 yards when he touched the ball. You just simply could not stop him.\n\n@TheJFlashy: (Rootstown’s) Caleb Kaut. I felt like I was watching a human cheat code before his injury. After his injury, still he was amazing.\n\n@MarkKnopick: Brian McClure of Rootstown. Three-sport athlete and led team to the regional finals in 1981. Went on to Bowling Green to set many records. Played for the Buffalo Bills.\n\n@GreenmenFB: Anthony Melchiori (WR/DB/K/P/KR) of Aurora. In a game in 2011, he did this in a seven-play succession to break open at 14-14 tie vs. Revere. 1. Returned KO 87 yards for TD; 2. Kicked XP; 3. Recovered his own onside kick; 4. Caught a 50-yard TD pass; 5. Kicked XP; 6. Kicked kickoff out of endzone; 7. Intercepted a pass on defense. He is in our record book for receiving, kicking and punting and was a shutdown corner on defense! A complete FB player. Went on to become a four-year All-MAC punter at Kent State.\n\n@WhyLee_tOSU: Alex Macek of Garfield. War G-Men.\n\n@JakeLieberth44: Logan Thut of Crestwood. In the 2016 football season, he was Division IV Player of the Year (Northeast Inland District) and rushed for 2,597 yards and 46 TDs.\n\n@coachahrens17: (Kent Roosevelt offensive lineman) Ryan Anderson. He was a man amongst boys.\n\n@MchoodJason: Dennis Robbins of Mogadore. He did not have to throw much all (1996) season with Chuck Moore at RB. He was the best passing QB I think Portage County ever had. Still holds most passing records for Division VI state-title games from the ’96 comeback. He was the main reason we won.\n\n@bpife: Dana Wright, Kent Roosevelt (1982). He was unstoppable.\n\n@NickWagner05: Having been on the opposite sideline as a coach at Youngstown Christian and going against him twice, Gary Strain from Mogadore was a beast!!\n\n@D_McC23: (Crestwood’s) Michael Picone. When you talk about a player that can do everything and is good at it all, Picone is exactly who I think of. Blocked kicks, forced fumbles, big hits and blazing speed with the ball in his hands! On top of all that, he’s the most selfless player I know.\n\n@DJFedor: Kevin Porco, Crestwood RB. He was the best I ever saw and rarely played in the fourth quarter.\n\n@Sophiethedog1: Paul Campbell…Ravenna during the mid-1970’s. Played fullback at Ohio State for Woody Hayes.\n\n@brantparsons: Brian McClure — Rootstown. He was an incredible athlete and nearly took the (1981 Rovers) team to the state finals. I was just a kid, but my dad was the principal at the school then, so we went to every game.\n\nBOYS SOCCER\n\n@unlvalumni: Andrew Sway (GK). Goalkeeper of the Year in the PTC all four years.\n\n@ThundercatJonez: Ronnie Moss — Rootstown. He was a couple of years above me. One of the most dominant players I’ve seen in the league. League Player of the Year. The guy could decide games by himself. Not many conversations with him, but he was fun to play against.\n\nT&F AND XC\n\n@h3ftyl3fty: (Mogadore’s) Kim Kreiner needs to be on this list. Went to the Olympics in the javelin. All-American at Kent State.\n\n@jakacki_ke: Bridget Franek (Crestwood) and her complete domination of the OHSAA state track meet! Was more than phenomenal and best part, more humble than most!\n\n@NHPreps: I remember seeing (Bridget Franek) at the Berkshire Earlybird one year and when she came out the woods, everyone SWORE she missed part of the course — she was so far ahead of everyone else. But, nah, she was just that good.\n\n@bcymanski: Bridget Franek. Absolutely dominant in /XC? And T&F, winning Crestwood state championship in 2006 (where she was four races on a hot June day).\n\n@JohnBen25531060: Distance runner would be (Garfield’s) Tyler Klouda. Holds school records in the 1,600, 3,200 and 5K. Six times was Runner of the Year and 11 times All-Ohio.\n\n@gbrake222: Lauren Jones — Garfield. Eighteen varsity letters in six sports. Three-tinme state discus champion and Valedictorian. University of Oklahoma.\n\n@jmbelden98: Bridget Franek. Hands down.\n\n@hamifan1: Watching Bridget Franek run for Crestwood. She is the best female athlete out of Portage County.\n\n@carolynwysong: Bridget Franek = 100% correct!\n\nSOFTBALL\n\n@CoachVanderink: Brittany Vanderink of Crestwood (2003). You cannot argue with Bridget Franek. She was unbelievable, but my sister Brittany Vanderink (Bakalar) has to be up there with her. Gatorade Player of the Year, to in OHSAA history in hits, average, steals, runs. Ohio State recruit and Third Team All-American at OSU.\n\n@gbrake222: Paige Halliwill — Mogadore. Fearless. Leftie. Diving catches in CF. Cannon arm. Excels at any sport she has ever played! Marshall commit.\n\nBASEBALL\n\n@AaronRauber: (Crestwood’s) Chuck Crowder. He had 435 strikeouts in his high-school career. Most dominant pitcher I have ever seen in 25-plus years of high-school baseball.\n\n@LarryGeddes: (Windham’s) Jake Eye. If you were around in the early 90’s and from Portage County, then you heard of Jake Eye. Phenomenal athlete, dominating in presence alone. Graet family man, who continues to give back to not only his own hometown, but to each and everyone who knows him.\n\n@JRoborecki: Chuck Crowder. Won basically every HS baseball award there is. Drafted in the third round out of high school and elected to go to Georgia Tech instead. Ended up being drafted by the Rockies after graduating from college.\n\nBOYS BASKETBALL\n\n@FallDalton: Tommy Bissler of Garfield. In the 2016-17 season, he put up 41 points against Cardinal, then dropped 36 on Waterloo the next game. That same year, he put up 24 points and 20 boards against Windham. Truly one of the best teammates I’ve ever had in any sport.\n\n@Brian__Callahan: Ravenna honorable judge Thomas Carnes (1964).\n\n@T_Herch: Greatest HS athlete I ever played with was Eric Schiele. He had a 69-point game and 60-point game.\n\n@Sophiethedog1: Oscar Wilmington (Ravenna 1979). Led Ravenna to one of few Metro titles."
