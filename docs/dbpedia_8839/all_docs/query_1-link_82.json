        "text": "The top students at the Fowler College of Business in 2011 with their most influential faculty members were (from left to right): Tim Schulz Van Endert, Blue Robbins, Ryan Aanerud, Will Snyder, Tracie Davidson, Steven Osinski, Andrew Do, Blake Currey, Robert Judge, Celestine Casserley.\n\nWhen the class of 2011 graduated from the San Diego State University College of Business Administration (now the Fowler College of Business), five undergraduate students were chosen as the top students in their major by the faculty in each department.\n\nThose five students — Ryan Aanerud (accounting), Blake Currey (finance), Tim Schulz Van Endert (management), Celestine Casserley (management information systems) and Tracie Davidson (marketing) — each selected their most influential faculty member to join them on stage during their commencement ceremony which took place on May 21, 2011.\n\nDavidson was named the Most Outstanding Student in the college and during the ceremony, she led the tassel-turning tradition signifying the graduates have earned their degrees.\n\nThe SDSU Fowler News Team recently reconnected with these top graduates to see how their stories have unfolded during the last decade. The young alumni have found success in a variety of different roles in diverse industries such as law, retail and real estate. Here’s what they shared:\n\nAccounting: Ryan Aanerud\n\nMost Influential Professor: Will Snyder\n\nRyan Aanerud Q&A\n\nToday, Ryan Aanerud works for the Campari Group in New York City.\n\n1. What has happened in your life since you left SDSU 10 years ago?\n\nAfter leaving SDSU, I started working in public accounting at EY in San Diego. Three years later, I moved to San Francisco where I started down the path of corporate finance at Banana Republic. After a couple of years and roles at the company, I was recruited to work in financial planning and analysis at an alcohol company and I relocated to New York City. Along the way, I have had the opportunity to make great friends personally and professionally and travel to numerous countries around the world.\n\n2. Where are you working now? What is your title?\n\nI am currently working in New York City for Campari Group - a global alcohol supplier with a wide portfolio of brands. I am a financial planning and analysis manager in the Brands Division, which entails corporate finance (forecasting, budgeting, reporting and analysis) and functional partnership with our marketing teams.\n\n3. What was your favorite memory from SDSU?\n\nI made a lot of great memories while at SDSU, but my favorite memory would be my semester in leadership with Beta Alpha Psi, the professional accounting society. Not only did it give me the opportunity to meet like-minded students who would go on to be part of my network, but it also gave me early insight into professional life after college. I highly recommend all students join one of the career-focused professional on societies campus.\n\n4. What was the most important lesson you learned at SDSU?\n\nThe most important lesson I learned at SDSU was time management. I tried to pile on as many courses, extracurriculars, and social events into my last several years to maximize my experience. It's a nice reminder during busy days and weeks now that I've handled the stress before - and without the paycheck!\n\n5. What advice would you give current SDSU business students?\n\nA number of my professors mentioned the importance of IT and systems knowledge in the corporate world, but it cannot be overstated how valuable you will be to your employer with solid technical skills. Companies are constantly investing in new user software and back-end systems to improve productivity, profitability, and to stay competitive. Pay attention to the preferred systems experience you see from employers and consider classes and online training to build your technical resume.\n\nManagement: Tim Schulz Van Endert\n\nMost Influential Professor: Blue Robbins\n\nTim Schulz Van Endert Q&A\n\nToday, Tim Schulz Van Endert is a Ph.D. student at Free University in Berlin, Germany.\n\n1. What has happened in your life since you left SDSU 10 years ago?\n\nAfter graduating from SDSU I initially worked in a marketing start-up in my hometown of Berlin, Germany for two years to get some work experience. The learning curve was steep, but my plan was always to get a master’s degree and I chose to attend the two-year business program at Humboldt University of Berlin. After graduation, I started working at EY’s (Ernst & Young) consulting practice. After 2.5 years of long working hours, countless PowerPoint slides and hotel rooms around Europe, I decided to go back into academia and to get a Ph.D.\n\n2. Where are you working now? What is your title?\n\nI am a Ph.D. student in behavioral economics at the Free University of Berlin, doing research on the relationship between digital media use and decision-making.\n\n3. What was your favorite memory from SDSU?\n\nThere are so many great memories from my time at the Mesa, but if I had to name one it would probably be walking around the beautiful campus with my father before the first week of my freshman year. Somehow, we both knew in that moment that it was the beginning of a life-changing experience for me.\n\n4. What was the most important lesson you learned at SDSU?\n\nI learned my most important lesson from Professor Blue Robbins in my last semester at State after he had experienced some serious health issues, which he thankfully was able to overcome. He encouraged us students to not hold back on our feelings for our loved ones because so many unexpected things can happen in life. These words have become ingrained in my mind as I went through hardship in the last decade. I still regularly exchange e-mails with Professor Robbins and meet up with him every time I visit SDSU.\n\n5. What advice would you give current SDSU business students?\n\nThe things you learn in the business department are incredibly valuable and useful. But instead of using that knowledge for only your own success, you might want to consider how you can contribute to solving the many societal challenges (e.g. climate change, poverty) that we (still) face today.\n\nMarketing: Tracie Davidson\n\nMost Influential Professor: Steven Osinski\n\nTracie Davidson Q&A\n\nToday, Davidson lives in Los Angeles and is an executive team leader at Target.\n\n1. What has happened in your life since you left SDSU 10 years ago?\n\nSeeking new opportunities — while not straying too far from that Southern California sunshine — I moved to Los Angeles. Cliché as it sounds, I have worked hard to be able to play hard, which for me means traveling to explore new countries and cultures.\n\n2. Where are you working now? What is your title?\n\nI am an executive team leader at Target. This past year has made me appreciate my position more than ever while playing a critical role in providing our communities with essential goods and committing to serve, in good times as well as bad.\n\n3. What was your favorite memory from SDSU?\n\nInstead of identifying one specific memory, I will just say that some of my friendships developed in dorms, classes, and extracurricular activities continue to be my most cherished.\n\n4. What was the most important lesson you learned at SDSU?\n\nI learned the importance of balance, and as a result, time management. Working, studying, and having a social life required me to be intentional, refine my priorities, stay focused, and be self-aware. That lesson still serves me well to this day.\n\n5. What advice would you give current SDSU business students?\n\nFirst, take a moment to acknowledge and appreciate your accomplishments! You are amazing! After you have fully showered yourself in self-praise, recognize that continuous learning is key. Find your preferred method for expanding your knowledge and stay vigilant I like to read as many books as possible to satisfy my curiosity but find what works for you and keep evolving into the best version of yourself.\n\nFinance: Blake Currey\n\nMost Influential Professor: Andrew Do\n\nBlake Currey Q&A\n\nToday, Blake Currey works for the United States District Court for the Southern District of California.\n\n1. What has happened in your life since you left SDSU 10 years ago?\n\nI journeyed all the way across the Mesa to attend law school at the University of San Diego School of Law. During law school, I had the privilege of interning for two local federal judges. Along with their staff, they provided exceptional mentorship and training that made me into the attorney I am today. After graduating summa cum laude, I passed the California Bar Exam and joined a national law firm with an office in Downtown San Diego. I practiced commercial litigation and real estate law, where my undergraduate finance and real estate courses repeatedly paid dividends. I have since returned to working for the federal court system—this time as an attorney.\n\n2. Where are you working now? What is your title?\n\nI work as an attorney at the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, which is headquartered in San Diego. My title is judicial law clerk. I help the United States district judge who I serve resolve lawsuits filed in federal court. In addition to constitutional and criminal cases, we handle a variety of disputes that touch on aspects of business, including those involving contracts, securities, trade secrets, insurance, real estate, false advertising, and unfair competition. Ten years later, my foundational business courses regularly make it easier to understand these areas of law and the reasons for the litigants’ disputes.\n\nOne of my favorite parts of this role is that I can pay it forward by mentoring and training law students who join us as interns. I also serve on the board of directors for the Federal Bar Association, San Diego Chapter, where our mission is to serve the interests of the federal legal community and strengthen the quality of the federal legal profession by promoting professionalism, inclusiveness, and civility.\n\n3. What was your favorite memory from SDSU?\n\nI loved my time at SDSU, so it is hard to pinpoint just one memory. Beyond watching Kawhi Leonard play for the Aztecs, my favorite memory was my time competing on SDSU Forensics—the college’s competitive speech and debate team. I participated in competitions on campus and traveled with the team to compete at other colleges. These experiences were filled with comradery. And my time on Forensics bolstered my confidence, improved my public speaking skills, and sharpened my ability to think quickly on my feet.\n\n4. What was the most important lesson you learned at SDSU?\n\nThe ability to read, interpret, and think critically about financial statements and budgets. Accounting can seem like a foreign language if you have never taken a business course. But once you learn this skill, it will prove useful in almost any role that touches on businesses or other organizations.\n\n5. What advice would you give current SDSU business students?\n\nYou should enjoy the journey, but no matter what you plan to do afterwards, get the most out of your time at SDSU. I ended up not working in the field of my major: finance. And although I had made the decision to go to law school before completing my major, I am grateful that I invested the time to learn as much as possible from my business courses. That knowledge has repeatedly proved invaluable both in my personal and professional life.\n\nFinance: Celestine Casserley\n\nMost Infleuntial Professor: Robert Judge\n\nCelestine Casserley Q&A\n\nToday, Celestine Casserley lives in Hawaii and works for Divvy Homes.\n\n1. What has happened in your life since you left SDSU 10 years ago?\n\nMy life took many paths after my time at SDSU, most were unexpected and wonderful! After I graduated, I did a quick traveling stint in Europe before returning to San Diego to start my career as a financial analyst. My expectation was to live in San Diego for the foreseeable future; however, it turns out that was not meant to be. After two years, I found myself envious of previous classmates' adventures abroad, so I decided to take the leap and move to Australia. I worked at a financial advisor’s office in Melbourne, but again realized I had not satiated my travel bug. For the next few months, I decided to explore Australia and the surrounding countries in Southeast Asia (Philippians, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, Thailand). From there, I thought it was time to buckle down and circle back to my career (while still traveling), so I moved to England for two years and worked at a start-up human resources consultancy. After four years abroad, I found my way back to California to the City by the Bay, San Francisco, where I started working for a startup fintech real estate company, Divvy Homes. However, now I am fortunate enough to be able to work remotely in my home state of Hawaii with my husband.\n\n2. Where are you working now? What is your title?\n\nMy current title is head of underwriting for Divvy Homes. Our goal is to provide a bridge to homeownership for all families.\n\n3. What was your favorite memory from SDSU?\n\nMy favorite memory at SDSU is, of course, the people…and the gym! When I was at SDSU the basketball team made it to the Sweet 16. At that time I was not a huge basketball fan and, honestly, didn't know much about the sport. I remember having barbecues and watching games with friends to support the team! I have been a fan of basketball ever since.\n\n4. What was the most important lesson you learned at SDSU?\n\nAt SDSU, I learned that even if you don't know much about an area where you have an interest, follow the path that you find most fascinating and not what you are best at. I knew nothing about Information technology before I decided to major in management information systems. All I knew is my classes and professors captured my curiosity and I wanted to learn more.\n\n5. What advice would you give current SDSU business students?\n\nYou do not need to go down the path society expects of you, you should choose the path that most excites you. I have found that following this guidance has opened unexpected doors which led to unbelievable adventures."
