        "text": "Research Involvement\n\nResearch Project\n\nWhen I participated in UROP, I was focused on bird mating behavior. More specifically, the interactions that two species have, and how that plays a role in reproductive success. Currently, I’m working on a proposal for research regarding dog coat genetics!\n\nHow do you hope to impact your students as a UROP Leader?\n\nI hope to help students understand how research works and the role that research plays in their daily lives. UROP is an amazing opportunity that exposes students to the ins and outs of research. I hope to impact my students by helping them understand their place in research, growing in their interests and hobbies, and helping them incorporate what they love into a research project. I’m so excited for the upcoming year!\n\nOther Interests\n\nI love all animals (I am on the pre-vet track), so my cats and dogs are my pride and joy. I also love music and music festivals! I love getting music recommendations from friends. I’ve been shooting film and developing my own photos for about 6 years, and I also love to rock climb!\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nI conducted a small research project for my ENT3607 class that focused on the mental health of FSU students.\n\nResearch Project\n\nMy current research focus is whether there is discrimination in the accounting field. Additionally, we are looking into which factors (college GPA, participation in college organizations as a student, leadership experience in college, participation in a mentorship program) led FSU accounting alumni to success.\n\nHow has UROP impacted your time at FSU?\n\nUROP has impacted my time at FSU significantly. I have fallen in love with doing research and have truly learned the importance of research. I have also made so many connections, including with my UROP Leaders, my mentor, the other students working on the same project as me, other UROP Leaders, and my classmates. Additionally, I have discovered that I enjoy teaching. Being a UROP Leader has allowed me to work on my public speaking skills and become more confident. Overall, UROP has made me a better person both personally and professionally.\n\nOther Interests\n\nI love photography, going to the gym and hanging out with my family and friends.\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nIn 2020-2021, I worked with the Leadership Learning Research Center (LLRC) at Florida State to determine whether academic leadership programs are taught through a positional, relational, or hybrid lens. In 2021, I showcased my project at the Florida Undergraduate Research Conference (FURC).\n\nResearch Project\n\nOver the summer, I was directly involved in research at Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida. I examined breast cancer patients' humoral and cellular responses after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. Additionally, I researched how single and multiagent chemotherapy affects the robustness of antibody-mediated responses.\n\nHow has UROP impacted your time at FSU?\n\nHonestly, UROP was the best thing to ever happen to me. As a sophomore, I was extremely intimidated by the research community after being rejected multiple times throughout the year. Being a part of UROP gave me the opportunity to choose the research I wanted to be a part of and feel welcomed by a supportive community. I have grown immensely throughout the program from being a shy, UROP student to a confident UROP leader. The skills that I've learned through UROP will follow me throughout the rest of my career and future endeavors.\n\nOther Interests\n\nTalk to me about writing, reading, cat videos, or Game of Thrones!\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nResearch Project\n\nI work in the Shatruk Lab under the department of Chemistry & Biochemistry. We study transition metal complexes that have spin crossover, a spin state change due to external stimulus. This phenomenon that occurs in these materials are promising for the development of new stimuli responsive materials. My project was synthesizing the organic ligand and reacting it with iron to create the spin crossover complex. The complex is still being studied to determine its properties.\n\nHow do you hope to impact your students as a UROP Leader?\n\nAs a UROP leader, I would really like to show my students all that FSU has to offer. There are so many resources and opportunities that students are provided with. A very relevant example of this is research, FSU has a multitude of research projects across every field. Entering a research space allows students to grow academically as well as professionally. I would like to help my students get as much out of research, if not more, as I have during my experience.\n\nOther Interests\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nNone other than the UROP colloquium and my UROP research, however I look forward to expanding my research endeavors!\n\nResearch Project\n\nMy current research focus is the \"Statistical Modeling on Cell Encapsulation\". In my research, we utilize probability distribution and statistical analysis to find the probability of cells per micro-fluidic droplet in a droplet generation system where cells are encapsulated. There are many biological, mathematical, and physical aspects of the research, however my main focus is the statistical and mathematical portion that combines the biological aspects and physical parameters and explains the probabilities of the randomness associated with droplet generation systems.\n\nHow do you hope to impact your students as a UROP Leader?\n\nAs a UROP Leader, I hope to impact my students tremendously in various ways. I would like to encourage them to branch out of their comfort zones and reach out to the research community, and mentors on campus. I want my students to be able to find their research and become passionate with their contributions. At the same time, I want my students to find comfort in our classroom environment as a guide outside their academic lives. I want to impact the stigma my students may have on the classroom setting and the difficulties of research. As a UROP leader, I hope to pave the way of a nice open environment for my students that encourages them to feed their research passions.\n\nOther Interests\n\nOutside of school and UROP, I have many things that I love to do. I love to read, go to the beach, and hangout with my friends. I am also a really big foodie, so I always love reading new recipes and finding new restaurants wherever I am.\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nDuring UROP, I worked with Dr. Annika Culver on her book The Shogun's Grand Niece which is a microhistory of a Japanese noble family living in the United States, but who kept deep ties to Japan. My work focused on the Japanese immigrant experience in the US, particularly during World War II and the internment camps. I am also part of the Rosenstrasse Foundation on campus where we are creating a larger database of acts of civil courage under the Nazi regime across Germany and occupied territories with an emphasis on the Rosenstrasse Protests.\n\nResearch Project\n\nI am currently working on an Honors in the Major exploring the role of gender find determining \"privileged\" status for Jewish-Christian marriages under the Nazi regime under the tutelage of Dr. Nathan Stoltzfus.\n\nHow has UROP impacted your time at FSU?\n\nUROP taught me integral research skills for my field of study, including how to use more specialized sources like national and state databases. Even more than that it gave me the confidence to start my own independent research by giving me a place to start and contacts within the department to guide me. It also helped me narrow down what I was (and was not) interested in, allowing emt o choose a topic that I would find rewarding instead of grueling.\n\nOther Interests\n\nI love to read, write, crochet, and play guitar.\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nI participated in archival research during my time in UROP and helped an FSU professor collect data for an upcoming book on the grandniece of the last Shogun of Japan! I am also an @fsuhistory social media intern and conduct mini-research projects that I turn into digital content. Right now, I'm working on a series about the history of dolls from around the world, encompassing everything from matryoshkas to Barbies!\n\nResearch Project\n\nI just finished a Senior Seminar thesis on media representation, folk religion, and violence which focused on Santa Muerte- an often misunderstood Catholic folk saint- in the United States. Folk religion is my current research focus but I also dabble in women's history, history in the Southern United States, and new religious movements.\n\nHow do you hope to impact your students as a UROP Leader?\n\nI want to help students develop the skills to become active and independent researchers throughout their time at FSU. By introducing FSU's amazing resources and guiding students to think critically about pursuing research, I hope to guide my students to be self-driven and prepared for their future in any field.\n\nOther Interests\n\nI am an avid coffee lover and when I'm not at one of FSU's libraries working I'm usually at an amazing Tallahassee cafe! I also love poetry, my cats, and astrology. I'm a novice crochet-er and a retail therapy patient!\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nI have done biochemistry research as a UROP student studying RNA stability using differential scanning fluorimetry. I recently sparked an interest in doing 3D printing with food and was able to learn and help create alginates for 3D printing with pea protein.\n\nResearch Project\n\nCurrently, I assist with research at The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory where I study micro-robotics. This research focuses on analyzing the collective behavior, motion, and the forces exerted by the magnetic hematite micro-motors using optical tweezers and UV light. This research aims to create bio-hybrid hematite particles by attaching bacteria flagella and archaea archaella to the particles. These micro-motors are biocompatible and are on the nanoscale which makes them useful for localized medicine applications.\n\nHow has UROP impacted your time at FSU?\n\nUROP introduced me to the many research opportunities available to undergraduate students and how to get started. This program allowed me learn valuable lab skills and help me find out my research interests. UROP has also provided me with so many resources that allowed me to get the most out of being a student at FSU. It has been a great experience for me and I would recommend any student to apply that wants to get involved in research.\n\nOther Interests\n\nRunning is one of my favorite hobbies. I have gotten the opportunity to run for FSU's Women's Cross Country and Track teams for the past three years. I enjoy finding a new trail to run on and I love when I get to see a pretty sunrise or sunset. Another one of my hobbies is cooking. I enjoy trying out new foods and perfecting my own recipes.\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nWhen I was in UROP my research project looked at the effects of microstructures on multilingual learners. I have always really enjoyed learning about multilingualism in my field. I also participated in a research project looking at the impact of different types of praise on 1st and 2nd graders.\n\nResearch Project\n\nCurrently I am doing research in the field of audiology. We are looking at the impact of multitasking on the auditory pathway. We are doing this by using an EEG along with various hearing tests.\n\nHow has UROP impacted your time at FSU?\n\nUROP has impacted my time at FSU in a variety of ways. For one, UROP truly introduced me to research when I didn't know much about it before. It also helped me realize my passion for research. It also helped me learn how to present in a public place to people who don't know about my research. The course itself was amazing as I learned a lot about campus resources that I didn't know about before. The course really helped guide us through our research experience. I adored my time in UROP.\n\nOther Interests\n\nI love going on adventures whether that be going on a hike, going to the beach, or visiting a cute town. I also really love crocheting, reading, going to the gym, and cooking.\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nClinical Research Assistant - Worked as a part of an interdisciplinary team investigating the effects of carbohydrates ingestion on patient vascular function, assisted with data entry and analysis, patient communication, blood sample centrifugation, and other key aspects of the research process.\n\nResearch Project\n\nI am currently working on a review paper about how different health literacy and numeracy scales are used for patient-oriented research studies. A part of a bigger project about creating patient portal software to bridge gaps between patient interpretation of lab results and their understanding and management of online medical records. I am also doing a systematic review of different types of gynecological cancer such as ovarian, cervical, etc.\n\nHow has UROP impacted your time at FSU?\n\nI think there have been two significant impacts that UROP has had on my time at FSU. Firstly, UROP has really helped me realize my future career path. I came into UROP undecided about what I was going to do in the future, and getting the opportunity to work with patients in a clinical setting and improve the healthcare system through UROP has aided my decision/passion for attending medical school and one day becoming a physician. Secondly, I think the relationships made through UROP are something that I have not been able to find in any other programs that I am a part of at FSU. Not only have I made friends with peers also in the UROP program, but my relationship with my research mentor has been one of the best relationships I have created at FSU. Having a research mentor who genuinely cares about your well-being and helps you learn what you like and don't like about research is so special. My whole research group and I are still extremely close even though our project has ended. I am so thankful that I was part of a group that made me love research and have an amazing experience as a UROP student.\n\nOther Interests\n\nI am an avid reader of psychological thrillers and love to spend time with my dogs! I am also the founder and president of a registered student organization here at FSU called Health Equality Reassurance and Education for You, AKA H.E.R.E. For You! H.E.R.E. For You strives to educate students and the community on women’s health and wellness. In affiliation with Florida State University’s Gynecology Clinic, this organization seeks to create more awareness surrounding the women’s health resources provided by FSU. Our club aims to support all FSU students who can benefit from the advice and treatment that FSU’s Women’s Clinic provides.\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nResearch Project\n\nRose participated in UROP her freshman year at Florida State. She worked under Dr. Daniel Bates and assisted with tasks related to his dissertation \"The Evolution of Spanish Vowel Perception\". Bates focus was to explore the acquisition of Spanish vowels by English-speaking learners. Rose's tasks specifically included organizing data and discarding errors on Excel, proofreading documents, and distributing survey links.\n\nHow do you hope to impact your students as a UROP Leader?\n\nRose inspires to impact her students through various ways as a UROP leader. For one, she hopes to equip with them with the skills and knowledge they need to be successful research assistants and future researchers themselves. She aims to not only provide them with the resources they need to excel in the classroom, but as a student attending Florida State as well. She aims to always be of aid to her students whether that be helping them with finding a research project or organizations/activities students should engage to propel their academic and professional development.\n\nOther Interests\n\nRose has a keen interest in makeup. She enjoys watching makeup videos and pinning \"future-looks\" on her Pinterest boards. Some of her other hobbies include deep cleaning, drinking tea and hanging out with her friends!\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nResearch Project\n\nMy current research examines the potential benefits of creatine, a popular athletic supplement, on cardiovascular and metabolic health, specifically in sedentary adults. In our lab, we are fortunate enough to utilize the novel microdialysis testing procedure, something that is rather rare in labs across the country. From our pilot data, we have seen a correlation between creatine supplementation and improved microvascular blood flow, as well as blood sugar stability following a high-sugar meal.\n\nHow do you hope to impact your students as a UROP Leader?\n\nI hope to guide students through this introduction to their undergraduate research career, as it can be a daunting task where many may be asking themselves, 'where do I start?'. Additionally, I hope to serve as an older, more experienced mentor for my younger students regarding life at FSU in general, whether it pertains to classes, campus recreation, clubs, etc.\n\nOther Interests\n\nIn Tallahassee during the school year, I am involved with Greek Life and really enjoy the intramural sports FSU has to offer. When back home in Tampa, I enjoy being outdoors and near the ocean, especially to go fishing.\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nI also participate in archaeology of the African Diaspora in South America volunteering on the Haciendas of Nasca Archaeological Project creating photogrammetric models of artifacts for public access. Additionally, I have research interests in Andean archaeology and bioarchaeology, and I will be attending an archaeological field school in Huarmey, Peru this summer through the El Campanario Archaeological Project.\n\nResearch Project\n\nMy primary research focus is in historical archaeology in the Southeastern United States, specifically in plantation archaeology in Louisiana through the Evergreen Plantation Archaeological Survey (EPAS). Currently, I am researching the collected material culture from the site with specific attention to glassware and glass fragments with the aim of reconstructing what life was like for the descendants of enslaved African Americans who continued to live and work on the plantation up until the early 1940s.\n\nHow has UROP impacted your time at FSU?\n\nUROP had played an instrumental role in my professional development in the field of archaeology that would not have been probable independently. Through UROP I have established a close relationship with my mentor and graduate students that I have collaborated with and assisted, which has led to the creation of a growing network of professional and personal connections. My mentor assisted me in attending the Society for American Archaeologists Conference where I was given credits for my contribution to our research as a co-author on three papers related to our project. In addition, through UROP I have identified my topic for my honors thesis, allowing me to begin my honors-in-the-major project a year earlier than originally planned.\n\nOther Interests\n\nI was also involved in the Anthropology Society at FSU (ASFSU), though stepping back to focus more time on my research projects for the next year.\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nResearch Project\n\nI plan on pursuing a career in research focused on crime analysis, mapping, and profiling. Currently, I am focused on expanding my experiences in research in whatever way I can by participating in lab research with professors here at Florida State. I am also interested in neuropsychology as it relates to deviance and criminal behavior.\n\nHow has UROP impacted your time at FSU?\n\nParticipating in UROP was one of the best decisions I could've made in my early college years. Not only did it provide me with an incredible and one of a kind experience, it inspired me to continue to pursue my research interests. Being able to see the behind the scenes of research at a top-ranked University has been a privilege. Being a student in UROP allowed me to find confidence in myself, discover more about my own interests, and has opened the door to so many other opportunities.\n\nOther Interests\n\nWhen I'm not in school at FSU, I am at home in St. Augustine laying on the beach or playing with the animals on my farms. I enjoy reading, cooking, and spending time with my friends. If I wasn't pursuing a career in research, I would definitely work with children either by teaching or working at a daycare.\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nDuring my freshman year, I researched U.S. and Japanese relations post-World War II as portrayed through film under the supervision of Dr. Christina Owens. I had a specific focus on the portrayal of the American ninja and the archetype’s connections to white saviorism, cultural appropriation, and a variety of other factors that may have influenced the relationship between the aforementioned countries.\n\nResearch Project\n\nMy current research focus examines the intersection between the arts and contemporary social justice. I am examining the historical basis for the use of the arts in social justice movements and exploring how this might have shifted or evolved in contemporary discourse.\n\nHow do you hope to impact your students as a UROP Leader?\n\nI hope to impact my students as a UROP Leader by leaving them with one new curiosity they hadn’t entered class with. Research is all about finding intersections and commonalities between your passions and interests, and if students leave my class with one new question or curiosity they didn’t enter with (just as I left UROP with a newfound interest in film) then I’ll feel fulfilled in my position.\n\nOther Interests\n\nIn my spare time, I enjoy playing guitar, reading, and going to the gym. I serve on the executive boards for the American Student Union and South Asian Student Association and would highly recommend students get involved in those spaces if they are interested!\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nDuring my time in UROP I worked on a math psychology research project.\n\nResearch Project\n\nI am very interested in Human Factors and Industrial Organizational Psychology, however currently I am working on a criminology project with professor Joseph Schwartz analyzing data he collected from a correctional facility.\n\nHow do you hope to impact your students as a UROP Leader?\n\nAs a UROP leader I hope to guide students to find the best path for them by providing resources and support. FSU has a wide variety of resources that every student can use for free that's just a little bit difficult to navigate or not be overwhelmed with alone. As a student leader, I wish to help my students make the best use they can of resources on campus, and I hope to leave them with skills that will help them long after my class.\n\nOther Interests\n\nLove music, my favorite genres are alt-rock, electroswing, and my favorite bands are Tally Hall, Lemon Demon, and Caravan Palace. I also have an interest for media history and pop culture. You'll often catch me at the ASLC watching a movie.\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nResearch Project\n\nOur research focuses on the neurodegenerative disease “Huntington’s disease” and the mechanical insights to the process of autophagy (misfolded protein degradation) in the mutant Huntington protein of yeast models.\n\nHow has UROP impacted your time at FSU?\n\nUROP has been an amazing opportunity to segue into research exposure and experience. I was able to find the research lab that I have now been a part of for two years from the UROP program, and I absolutely love my research lab. I have made so many connections with PhD candidates and research professors, and have learned so many different experimental procedures and analyses. Because I had such a great experience with the research process, I wanted to become a UROP leader to help people like me with little prior research knowledge to become aware of the undergraduate research opportunities and benefits.\n\nOther Interests\n\nBesides research, I take part in dance marathon as a morale captain, am Vice President of Finance for the Medical Fraternity Phi Delta Epsilon, and am a dancer in Level Dance Company/ have danced since I was three years old! I love to read and love animals!\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nDuring my senior year of high school, I conducted a study analyzing how learning choral music in German could affect pronouncing German correctly outside of a musical setting for my AP Research project.\n\nResearch Project\n\nCurrently, I am exploring my cultural heritage and finding the connections between Filipino and Moroccan vocal music for my Honors in the Major thesis.\n\nHow has UROP impacted your time at FSU?\n\nBeing in UROP has helped expose me to a bunch of research fields that I would not have otherwise gone out of my way to learn about without being introduced to it first. It has also been highlighted to me that there needs to be better representation for research in the arts which has motivated me to discover the research that graduate students and faculty members in my college are conducting. I have been inspired to help contribute to more research created in the field of music along with finding ways to make it more interdisciplinary for more people to be interested in it.\n\nOther Interests\n\nI currently serve as a Programming Coordinator for the Asian American Student Union because I am dedicated to sharing Asian cultures and representation with the students of FSU in a fun way. In my free time, I enjoy video editing, exploring new places, visiting different restaurants, and being in water- either swimming or coxing a boat with the FSU Rowing Club.\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nI have not participated in other research-related activities, but I hope to pursue an Honors in the Major project in Fall 2023!\n\nResearch Project\n\nMy current research focuses on how Covid 19 impacted the farming community and what can be done to make sure they are protected in the future. Farmworkers were not given the proper resources (masks, Covid tests) during the pandemic which put them at substantial risk of catching the virus. I have conducted literature reviews, interviews, and have come up with a list of ways that this kind of negative treatment could be avoided in the future.\n\nHow has UROP impacted your time at FSU?\n\nUROP has impacted my time at FSU by giving me a boost into my first research project, which I do not think I could have gotten on my own. My UROP leaders supported me as I struggled to find research initially, and the colloquium taught me a lot about research that I did not know before. I am very thankful for the UROP program as it helped me find my passion in research and continue to do that after completing it.\n\nOther Interests\n\nSome hobbies are reading, writing, volunteering around Tallahassee, and having fun with my friends!\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nResearch Project\n\nMy research experience began in high school when I spent three years completing a research project which investigated the effects of G. parvispora on mitigating K. brevis during Red Tide blooms. I continued with research in college and during my UROP experience, I spent time developing algorithm which assesses the relationship between biomass density of T. Testudinum, a common Floridian seagrass, and the nutrient concentrations in the surrounding estuaries throughout several coastal regions in South Florida. I continued with this project after UROP, focusing on investigating K. brevis population behaviors, nutrient profiles, etc. while also assisting in culturing algae populations in the lab.\n\nHow do you hope to impact your students as a UROP Leader?\n\nI am excited to share with others my passion and enthusiasm for research and scientific discovery. UROP heightened my curiosity and allowed me to ask questions and connect concepts learned in the classroom to the real world. I hope to encourage students to investigate their research inquiries and not be afraid to fail. Their successes and failures are equally substantive and impressive, and I am eager to assist students throughout their research experiences. I hope to share my stories and research wisdom with them, and hope that students are able to possibly learn from my research experiences, successes, and failures. I hope to give students the confidence they need to present at the URS, and, even if they decide after UROP is over that they do not enjoy research, I hope that they learned a great deal about it and the process. Most importantly, I want my students to have someone to rely on, whether it be research related or not, and to be the person students can go to when they are experiencing challenges. I hope to leave a lasting imprint on my students as I will support and encourage them to reach for their goals and beyond.\n\nOther Interests\n\nSwimming\n\nReading\n\nHiking\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nOver the summer, I worked as a research intern at Mayo Clinic Florida where I was involved in two projects in the Department of Social Work. The two projects I worked on were titled, Advanced Care Planning in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic and Financial Preparedness in Kidney/Pancreas Patients Post-Transplant. Prior to this, I conducted research with the Children's National Hospital in Washington, D.C. understanding the role of the Childhood Opportunity Index in surrounding communities, and the role the hospital can directly play in community engagement. As a UROP student, I worked with the College of Human Sciences on a project titled, The Role of NADPH Oxidase in Endothelial Function.\n\nResearch Project\n\nI am currently a Global Scholar working on understanding how the social determinants of health are used in Jacksonville, Florida. Additionally, I am working on a capstone project for my major understanding the impacts of cellphone usage on sleep patterns in college-aged students.\n\nHow has UROP impacted your time at FSU?\n\nAs a UROP student, I was introduced to many different students with like-minded goals, as well as faculty and staff that allowed me to make connections both inside and beyond my immediate interest. Supported by the UROP leadership, I was provided various resources and made aware of numerous opportunities that allowed me to get involved very early on in my academic career. UROP helped to initiate a passion of mine to continually seek information, apply myself in ways I did not know I could, and create long-lasting connections with peers and staff.\n\nOther Interests\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nI conducted research about an innovative educational curriculum called the Morphological Awareness Pathway to Reading (MAR-P), which focuses on morphological awareness to improve students’ reading abilities. The MAR-P curriculum is based on a wealth of research that emphasizes the vital role that morphological awareness plays in the development of reading comprehension. Students work on morpheme recognition, analysis, and manipulation through engaging, hands-on exercises.\n\nResearch Project\n\nI am currently conducting research at the FSU Coastal and Marine Laboratory under Dr. Grubbs and Annais Bonilla. The project looks at maternal investment in rays, specifically the Atlantic stingray, and the energetic costs of reproduction. My work includes the collections of the species, husbandry, bait collections, and experimental trials that quantify the oxygen consumption in the species throughout their gestational period.\n\nHow has UROP impacted your time at FSU?\n\nUROP overall has been nothing but an amazing experience for me. I can confidently say that I came into UROP as one student and came out as a new and improved student. It gave me the opportunity to collaborate with research mentors with amazing projects. Participating in research taught me how to think critically, analyze data, and interpret results. Furthermore, it has taught me how to problem solve. After being in UROP, my time management skills have significantly improved. Having to balance research tasks, deadlines, school related homework and exams, clubs, and extracurricular activities enhanced my management abilities. It has also taught me that it is all right to step out of your comfort zone and indulge in research that does not correlate with your current major.\n\nOther Interests\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nI am looking into Cancer Research and Diabetes Research.\n\nResearch Project\n\nMy current research focus is Pre-Service STEM teachers and the educational system. My research looked into the ways that pre-service STEM teachers (PSTs) use talk-moves and vulnerability to connect with other PSTs. This research looks into the community building that takes place with PSTs and how these PSTs can use this community in the real world with students and other teachers. We used video data of interviews and classroom discussions to do Multimodal Discourse Analysis. We believe this research will help future teachers and the educational grow.\n\nHow has UROP impacted your time at FSU?\n\nUROP is really a special program in which it connects students with research happening here at Florida State University. I was looking for research, and I did not know where to start or who to even ask. Having UROP really helped me find so many professors and research projects that I had no clue existed. During my time in UROP, I found so many new friends and peers that are all so passionate about research. UROP taught me how to speak and communicate in a professional sense. The program opened my eyes to new topics and research fields I didn't know I was interested in. The most important thing UROP gave me was my research mentor. My mentor has become a great friend in which I can have support from and guidance. I am so glad that I applied to UROP.\n\nOther Interests\n\nInvolvements: Medical Response Unit at FSU, UROP Leader, Emergency Medical Technician (EMT)\n\nHobbies: Reading and Movies, Running and Exercise, Dancing and Singing, Going to National Parks and Nature Trails\n\nInterests: Music (EDM, pop, rap, and country), My favorite Artists are Dom Dolla, Harry Styles, Zach Bryan, and Taylor Swift :)\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nI hope to apply for an IDEA grant for the summer of 2025, in which I will research the ways that memoirs describe mother-daughter relationships for minority women.\n\nResearch Project\n\nFor my UROP project, I conducted research that focused on building mobile libraries for rural/ underprivileged areas in the Southern United States. Through this project, I learned about how to make literature accessible to different demographics and how technology can bridge the gaps in education. In the future, I would like to conduct research that focuses on how marginalized people use literature to express their experiences.\n\nHow do you hope to impact your students as a UROP Leader?\n\nI hope to get my students excited about research and inform them of the many opportunities that it can offer. While research can be intimidating, it is an incredibly rewarding experience that anyone who has the opportunity to participate in values greatly. Sharing my personal love for research will hopefully inspire a similar love for research in others. Additionally, I want to be someone that my students can rely on as a mentor within UROP and beyond.\n\nOther Interests\n\nOutside of UROP, I enjoy reading, journaling, and hanging out with my friends and family.\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nResearch Project\n\nI am a research assistant in one of the studies under the Anxiety and Behavioral Health Clinic at Florida State University.

In this past, I have worked with a focus on anxiety and PTSD, and currently have a focus on insecurities and gender vulnerability.\n\nHow do you hope to impact your students as a UROP Leader?\n\nI currently serve as a UROP Leader for STEM transfer students, a section that I had hoped to teach when I initially applied for the program. This section has a special place in my heart because choosing to change schools is very brave and the transition can be difficult initially. I hope to be able to facilitate a relationship with my students that communicates support, while helping bridge the gap between research and fun for them. I aspire to help my students find the aspects of their research that bring them joy and challenge them to become better researchers. In addition to this, I want them to understand how their research impacts the world around them and the importance of their work. Choosing to engage in research at an undergraduate level is an incredible accomplishment and rare opportunity, and I want to celebrate students who choose to do it!\n\nOther Interests\n\nInvolvements: EMT, Emergency Room Technician, Research Assistant, Campus Recreation Outdoor Pursuits Trip Leader, Vice President of Inclusion for Pi Beta Phi, English Language Mentor, Rotary International\n\nHobbies: Hiking, Camping, Learning New Languages\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nResearch Project\n\nWhile I am a finance major, during the UROP program I assisted in social science research. I worked on a meta-research project that analyzed the peer review process itself, and inquired about researchers' opinions on blind review, a relatively new development in the peer review process world in which the reviewers and the comments on an article submitted to a journal are made public. My research interests are still in the social sciences and humanities, however, I am currently not working on any research projects.\n\nHow do you hope to impact your students as a UROP Leader?\n\nI was very nervous entering college; I was born and raised in Saudi Arabia and came to America and FSU alone. My UROP Leaders did a great job of connecting with us and making the entire experience less daunting. They told us about all the resources FSU offers, and I frequently asked them questions about almost everything related to the college experience. I hope to carry that forward to my UROP section. I aim to be a resource and ease their transition into not only the research world but the college world in general. I also hope to show them how valuable of an opportunity the UROP program is, and encourage them to continue research beyond the program.\n\nOther Interests\n\nIn my free time I like weightlifting, running, and watching movies.\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nThe research I completed for my UROP project was with the Ma group in the development of new functional materials with controlled chemical and physical properties for applications in a range of technological areas from energy to environmental and information technologies. The research activities involved material synthesis and characterization, device fabrication and testing, and theoretical computation and simulation. Materials of interest ranged from organics to metallo-organics, polymers, and organic/inorganic hybrids. The major purpose of the research was to study the underlying chemical and physical properties of new materials, and understand how molecular structure and processing conditions control the material properties and affect their performance in devices. The end of the research is fundamental knowledge of the structure-property-processing-performance relationships that allow for the further development of materials and devices with desired properties and performance.\n\nResearch Project\n\nI am currently doing a DIS with the Shatruk group in advanced functional materials. Our current research interests include molecular qubits for quantum information processing, photo-switchable molecular materials, intermetallic magnets for magnetic refrigeration and electric vehicles, and quantum magnetic materials with non-trivial spin textures for spintronic applications. The disciplinary focus of our work lies within inorganic materials chemistry, with strong interdisciplinary crossover to physical and organic chemistry, as well as to condensed matter physics and machine learning. The research includes diverse training in inorganic and organic syntheses, X-ray and neutron scattering methods, magnetic and electrical property measurements, optical, infrared, NMR, and EPR spectroscopy, as well as computational approaches to elucidation and discovery of new functional materials.\n\nHow has UROP impacted your time at FSU?\n\nUROP has greatly impacted my time at FSU in many ways. I have been exposed to many things that most undergraduate students do not get the chance to see. Completing research in my undergraduate years at FSU has made me more confident in my lab abilities and knowledge which I apply to my course and hopefully, will apply to my future career. I have also been able to make connections with many research professors and have been published in a paper. I have many techniques and experiences under my belt because of UROP and it has been an amazing experience overall.\n\nOther Interests\n\nI enjoy cooking, traveling, and animals. I studied abroad with FSU's international program in Valencia, Spain and it was also a once-in-a-lifetime experience that I would recommend to anyone.\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nResearch Project\n\nMy current research focuses on sustainability and the turnover intentions of environmental nonprofit employees. We are also focusing on the concept of eco-anxiety and how it is affecting whether NPO employees choose to stay or quit their jobs.\n\nHow has UROP impacted your time at FSU?\n\nBefore college, I did not know that undergraduate students could be involved with research and assist FSU's faculty. When my roommate told me about UROP freshman year, I applied and was so excited to receive my acceptance. Since then, I have had a fantastic opportunity to work with my mentor, a PhD student, and use his advice in research, academics, and everyday life. The CRE has also taught me about resources FSU offers that I would have not familiarized myself with otherwise. Through this opportunity, I have met the most amazing people and hope to be a part of that support network for future UROP students.\n\nOther Interests\n\nI am involved with club tennis and will serve as vice president for the upcoming year on the executive board. I am also a member of the FSU Belly Dancers, and I love staying active both on campus and at the gym.

I am using behavioral analysis software, BORIS, to analyze videos I took in Bonaire, Caribbean Netherlands, and identify grazing behaviors in foureye butterflyfish, Chaetodon capistratus.\n\nHow has UROP impacted your time at FSU?\n\nUROP has provided me with amazing opportunities to engage in research at FSU. I joined UROP during my freshman year and participated in research involving cyanobacterial mat coverage in coral reef ecosystems. During my time on this project, I earned my SCUBA certification so I would be able to take the AAUS Scientific Diving class. By taking this class and earning my Scientific Diving certification, I would be able to participate in underwater research. During my sophomore year, I took the class and was offered a position as a researcher for the summer of 2021. I went to Bonaire, Caribbean Netherlands to assist with a graduate student's work on parrotfish. During my time there, I was allowed to begin my own research project on butterflyfish grazing. Once we returned, I started a DIS and worked on my own research. Through the graduate student I worked with, I learned about the Darling Marine Center in Walpole, Maine. I spent the summer of 2022 there assisting one of the research assistants with SCUBA-related activities, such as cleaning biofouling off of water quality buoys.\n\nOther Interests\n\nI am the president for FAEP:FSU (Florida Association of Environmental Professionals at FSU) and the treasurer for Seminole Scuba Club.\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nMy research experience began in UROP with a clinical research study, and I am co-authored on the manuscript that is now in the publication process in an interpersonal violence journal.\n\nResearch Project\n\nCurrently, I’m an undergraduate research assistant in a developmental psychology lab, collecting and entering data for a graduate project. Additionally, I am conducting an honors thesis investigating psycholinguistic factors in letter-naming speed as it relates to reading ability.\n\nHow has UROP impacted your time at FSU?\n\nPrior to research engagement, I was unaware of how to contribute to my field as an undergraduate. However, finding specific interests in my majors positioned me to not only work alongside other intellectuals but also serve in helping other undergraduates acknowledge their potential, as well as pursue academic engagement opportunities outside the classroom.\n\nOther Interests\n\nA non-research related organization I'm involved in on campus is Lady Spirit Hunters. We are most known for providing face-paintings at FSU athletic events (football, basketball, volleyball, baseball, etc). If you spot me at a FSU sporting event feel free to ask for a face painting! We also engage in philanthropy events such as Dance Marathon, Relay for Life, and Camp Kesem fundraisers in addition to our member engagement activities.\n\nSome personal hobbies or interests I have include playing racquetball, drawing, tumbling, and watching comedies, reality-TV, or dramas.\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nPreviously I participated in research that involves digital media art. I mainly collected data for artists' open-call opportunities nationally.\n\nResearch Project\n\nI am currently not participating in research, but I am interested in being a part of any research within my discipline of criminology. I haven't gotten a chance to be a part of criminology research, so if I were to participate it would be that.\n\nHow has UROP impacted your time at FSU?\n\nI was a freshman when I participated in UROP, and I think I have learned a lot of skills through the program. If it weren't for UROP, I wouldn't have participated in research, mostly because I didn't know how to approach professors or didn't think I was eligible. But being a part of UROP has brought me out of my shell and into the real world. As a freshman, there are so many things that you need to do, meet new friends, and adapt to a new environment, and being a part of this program has taught me academic skills and social skills, which I am grateful for. Also, the research I was a part of was related to digital media art, which is not in my discipline, and I think it helped me to open my eyes to something that I didn't know before, which was fascinating to learn!\n\nOther Interests\n\nI am a part of Lambda Alpha Epsilon, a criminology fraternity!\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nDuring my UROP experience, I worked in a biomedical research lab in the FSU College of Medicine.

Ultimately, I aspire to cultivate a community of driven and engaged scholars who are equipped with the knowledge, skills, and confidence to make meaningful contributions to their fields and society at large.\n\nOther Interests\n\nI enjoy staying involved in various campus organizations, including the Honors Program, Student Government Association, the Asian American Student Union, and serving as a Resident Assistant. I'm passionate about meeting new people from diverse backgrounds and seizing every opportunity to learn and grow. Whether it's through engaging in campus organizations or participating in community events, I thrive on connecting with others and broadening my perspective. In my free time, I also enjoy practicing yoga, photography, exploring new cuisines, and going to brunch with friends.\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nI also partake in independent research activities that help further my creative practice, as most of my written and painted pieces are created in response to historical events.\n\nResearch Project\n\nMy primary research focus centers around how archival art historical evidence can aid the dissemination of information regarding works of art that are often overlooked within the canonical context. I have utilized some of this information whilst working on the \"Dante Today\" project, as I was in charge of writing and publishing posts regarding contemporary works of art that had little or no information on their background. Currently, I am also dedicating my attention to the exploration of Artemisia Gentileschi's art practice, specifically concerning how her trial affected some of her pieces — which often displayed violently graphic themes.\n\nHow has UROP impacted your time at FSU?\n\nUROP has strongly impacted my time at FSU because it granted me the opportunity to independently explore certain academic subjects of interest that, within a classroom context, can often become suppressed or molded. This program has helped me set goals that furthered my personal cultural enrichment as well as my professional skills.\n\nOther Interests\n\nIn my spare time, I like to read, write, and paint. I also enjoy going on hikes and immersing myself in nature.\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nResearch Project\n\nMy current research focus is Women's Health with a focus on rural Honduras. I remained involved with the project I did my UROP poster on, which assessed Honduran healthcare practitioners' knowledge, attitude, and preparedness to assist patients experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV). We are now exploring alternate studies while we wait for IRB approval on our original project, while retaining that same focus on women's health in rural Honduras.\n\nHow has UROP impacted your time at FSU?\n\nUROP was an incredible experience to start off my freshman year. It gave me the opportunity to slowly dip into the field of research rather than having to dive in head-first. This eliminated a lot of the fear and risk that surrounds the independent search for research projects. Through the UROP program, I not only had support from my UROP Leader, but also from my peers, the program's directors, and eventually my mentor. While working on this project, I've been able to collaborate with people in Honduras as well as some of my peers at FSU, and after the program finished I was able to not only remain part of the Women's Health team but also go on to teach a UROP section of my own.\n\nOther Interests\n\nOne of my main interests is writing, mostly fiction or poetry, and to supplement that I also engage in leisure reading. Apart from that, I enjoy salsa dancing and other forms of Latin dance, which has led me to the salsa classes at FSU given by Corazón Dancers. A general interest of mine is study abroad, and I had the incredible opportunity to meet this lifelong goal in Fall of 2023 when I studied in Valencia, which I'd be more than happy to discuss with anyone who might be interested.\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nResearch Project\n\nMy research has focused on observing behaviors in mothers feeding their infants, as well as cataloging the type of frequency of therapy strategies being used by school-based SLPs treating speech-sound disorders.\n\nHow do you hope to impact your students as a UROP Leader?\n\nI hope to guide students through the research process in a way that is non-intimidating and inclusive of all interests. Research can be done by all students in all majors, and underclassmen can massively contribute to the work being done by labs at FSU even if they haven't had any prior experience. Becoming a researcher isn't about knowing everything about a topic or having a Ph.D. - it's about having the willingness to learn, adapt, and grow! UROP is an amazing experience for students to embark on their research journey with structure and support, and it's been amazing to watch my students develop both their skillsets and their confidence throughout the years.\n\nOther Interests\n\nIn my free time, I serve on the Executive Board of Alpha Delta Pi sorority and love to spend time with my sisters. I also love exercise, yoga, and journaling. On a Saturday afternoon during the Fall, you'll definitely find me cheering on our Noles at Doak Campbell Stadium!\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nAlong with my UROP assistantship, I participated in the Research-Intensive Bachelor's Certificate (RIBC) for Political Science. Through this program, I was able to take courses on advanced political science research methods and meet with various faculty about the role of research in my field. The program culminated with my cohort and I designing an original research experiment and we worked to submit the coauthored paper to a political science journal. Additionally, I participated in a research internship with FSU's Department of Political Science where I was able to continue exploring the topics I had studied during my time in UROP with official guidance.\n\nResearch Project\n\nCurrently, I am studying the influence of costly signaling on public support for military action in regards to the state of Sino-US relations. Particularly in how signals might produce a provocative effect instead of a deterrent effect. I have also studied the effects of interbranch oversight on public perception of covert foreign policy.\n\nHow do you hope to impact your students as a UROP Leader?\n\nAs a UROP Leader, I hope to encourage students to love research and to passionately chase after knowledge - whether they do so formally through academia or through their chosen careers. Research is an incredible opportunity for students to explore their personal interests and learn more about the world around them. The skillsets learned from it are truly invaluable, even when the tasks seem tedious. But what is more, is the students' ability to connect with a subject or topic that they love, and I hope to foster their enthusiasm for knowledge during my time as their leader. The world needs more passionate, critical thinkers and I hope to guide my students to take that role with confidence.\n\nOther Interests\n\nFormally, I am also involved with the University Honors Program. Outside of research, I love to draw, read, and take long walks around campus! I also enjoy trying new flavors of tea and hanging out with my dog, Ducky.\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nI have attended a few poster competitions at FSU, and I attended the 2022 Chemical Senses Retreat as a spectator.\n\nResearch Project\n\nNeuroscience/ Biology\n\nHow do you hope to impact your students as a UROP Leader?\n\nBecoming a UROP leader has enabled me to build long-lasting, invaluable relationships. This opportunity has allowed me to hone professional skills including my communication, interpersonal, and leadership skills.\n\nBecause I want to enter a competitive field, it is imperative that I learn how to be a great, effective leader. That is, someone who guides and motivates a group of people successfully. Someone who instills values such as integrity, hard work, and professionalism. I believe that I always need to be the best version of myself. Thus, inspiring others to be the best versions of themselves is something I would look forward to every class as a UROP leader.\n\nAs a UROP student a years ago, I gained invaluable knowledge from my mentors, who were instrumental in my growth process, helping me realize my full potential and pushing me beyond my comfort zone. As a current UROP Leader I aim to be the kind of leader whom students can confide in and look to for advice.\n\nOther Interests\n\nI'm a pre-med student, with a passion for medicine and sciences. I love giving back to the community, which is why I volunteer at TMH.\n\nI'm part of the FSU Equestrian Club, and I'm on the Dressage Competitive team. I love being around animals (specially horses and dogs)\n\nI' m a member of a social service sorority, Delta Nu Zeta; and I'm also a mentor for FSU freshmen that have earned an AA degree while they were in high school.\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nResearch Project\n\nMy research focus involves sport and performance psychology with a smaller focus in counseling. As a member of the Laboratory for Emotions, Groups, and Organizations (LEGO Lab), a research group in FSU's sport psychology department, I have worked on projects examining emotional facets of group sports. These projects looked at topics such as how the presence of pride and envy impact team performance, what emotions are experienced in response to teammate injury, and psychological-state focus in baseball, just to name a few. Sport psychology is a new and growing field, and I am lucky to be at a university with such a renowned program for it. If sport psychology is something you have an interest in, feel free to reach out!\n\nHow has UROP impacted your time at FSU?\n\nUROP has impacted my time at FSU by providing me the resources to find and get involved with research in my relatively smaller field. Coming to FSU as an incoming freshman, I knew that undergrad research was something I was interested in doing, but I wasn't sure how. After getting into UROP, this program streamlined the whole process, greatly aiding my involvement in undergrad research. As a result, I have had the opportunity to continue working with the research lab UROP helped me apply to and grow my network significantly.\n\nOther Interests\n\nOutside of research and academics, I am involved at FSU's Askew Student Life Center (ASLC). As the Co-Sponsorship Senior Programmer, I will be playing movies for students every week! I encourage everyone to check out a film at the ASLC sometime. I am also a big proponent of the local Tallahassee music scene. There are so many bands made up of fellow students that perform all the time, so check them out!\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nI volunteer within Dr. Lisa Eckel’s Neuroscience Lab, where I perform animal maintenance and care and attend regular lab meetings. The research project I am currently involved in focuses on the role of estrogens on attenuating weight gain in female rats. This lab has provided me with a well-rounded foundation for the experimental process, from both a behavior and brain perspective.\n\nResearch Project\n\nI have been a part of the Hammock lab, a social and developmental neuroscience research lab, from Summer 2022 - current. We focus on the role of oxytocin in relation to postnatal brain and behavior development via an animal model. I completed my Honors in the Major Thesis project under Dr. Elizabeth Hammock and Alicia Gonzalez. My project focused on the evaluation of oxytocin and touch on neonatal thalamus c-Fos activity in mice. I investigated the role of oxytocin as a modulator of experience-dependent development through social touch circuitry. I plan to continue pursuing research under Dr. Hammock while at FSU. In the future, I hope to study the effects of early life stress on microglia activity and postnatal neural circuitry development.\n\nHow do you hope to impact your students as a UROP Leader?\n\nI hope to impact my students as a UROP Leader by conveying the benefits of becoming immersed within research, and by teaching students how to properly get involved without feeling overwhelmed. I want to help guide other undergraduate students in the journey of discovering their research interests, and learning how to navigate the process of searching for and contacting research professors. I want to instill my passion and appreciation for research in other undergraduate students, and convey to them that their research skills will help guide them in all areas of life.\n\nOther Interests\n\nBeyond the classroom while at FSU, I was a part of the FSU Women’s Swimming and Diving team (August 2021 - August 2023), in which I competed as a 10-meter platform diver. Additionally, I'm a part of the pre-medical chapter of Phi Delta Epsilon at FSU (FL Zeta), participating in numerous fundraising and volunteering events. In my free time, I love to run, do yoga, and bake, with my specialty being cheesecake. I am currently training for a triathlon, and plan to run in the next Tallahassee Half-Marathon!\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nResearch Project\n\nMy research with Dr. Carli Zegers from the FSU College of Nursing focuses on improving healthcare translation standards for Spanish-speaking populations. Coming from a Hispanic background, I'm passionate about addressing linguistic disparities in healthcare. By evaluating the effectiveness of these standards, particularly in conveying culturally sensitive medical information, we aim to enhance health literacy and outcomes.\n\nHow do you hope to impact your students as a UROP Leader?\n\nI want to help develop students' skills, knowledge, and confidence so they can enjoy participating in research and continue exploring their interests, passions, and goals. I also hope to be a mentor for them throughout their time at FSU; whether it relates to academics or not, I want them to know I will always be there to help however I can!\n\nOther Interests\n\nI love music (I play the violin, piano, and flute), drawing, and watching movies with friends! At FSU, I’m a part of the Medical Response Unit and the Phi Delta Epsilon Medical Fraternity.\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nResearch Project\n\nMy current research focus involves the field of nursing. During my time in high school, I worked in a lab at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County where I researched more effective cures for prostate cancer using mice and rats as cancer models. Additionally, I had a smaller project of my own where I worked to optimize transfection protocols of Hela cells using green fluorescent protein (GFP). While in UROP, I was given the opportunity to work under The Center for Leadership and Social Change where I participated in the Leadership Programs Project. The main goal of this project was to obtain data on educational leadership programs located throughout the country.\n\nHow do you hope to impact your students as a UROP Leader?\n\nAs a UROP leader, I hope to share my passion for research with my students while guiding them throughout their own research journey. Engaging in research during undergraduate education is extremely beneficial and I am excited to provide my students with all of the tools and resources they need to succeed!\n\nOther Interests\n\nDuring my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, going to the beach, and being involved within my Panhellenic sorority, Pi Beta Phi!\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nResearch Project\n\nMy current research focus is in the use of artificial intelligence to create specific binaural beats. These binaural beats could be used to effect relaxation into a listener under the guise of any music of their choosing. If successful, the use of binaural beats may be able to assist with chronic or acute pain treatment.\n\nHow has UROP impacted your time at FSU?\n\nWhen I first entered UROP, I wasn't quite sure of what I had gotten myself into. I knew a little about research, but didn't possess the skills to come up with my own research project and explore that idea. With the help of my mentors and Alicia, I not only became knowledgeable about he scientific method, the process of research, and how symposiums are conducted, but I also formed connections with my research mentor, as well as others in my lab. The experience has been invaluable to the development of my public-speaking/marketing skills and has given me the confidence to pursue any research opportunity in the future.\n\nOther Interests\n\nI'm currently an Emergency Medical Responder in the Medical Response Unit on campus.\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nIn 2022, I was awarded the IDEA Grant to begin my own venture in creating a rapid STD test for chlamydia and gonorrhea. In juggling classes, I still partake in this independent venture research project. As mentioned above, I served as the lead research assistant at Mayo Clinic in the peak of the pandemic. Researching, analyzing data, and synthesizing solutions allowed for my first publication and has since fueled my love for research.\n\nResearch Project\n\nAdvocacy through research has always been my mission and research focus through any project I partake in. In researching at Mayo Clinic, it was finding alternative detective methods to SARS-CoV-2 to diminish the deaths among minority and disenfranchised communities. In UROP, it was advocating for an electronic health record in developing countries as a member of the Global Health Collaborative Project. In my own research, I study fast detective methods for sexually transmitted diseases to better sexual health for college students, disenfranchised communities, and the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nHow do you hope to impact your students as a UROP Leader?\n\nAs a UROP leader, I want my students to see the beauty and multiplicity of research. One does not have to be in the lab all day, if they do not long to be in the lab. There are so many different avenues and facets of research that one can partake in. My love for advocacy and innovation led me to begin my own venture. It was not my love for photosynthesis rather it was my zeal to help people and create a lasting impact. In serving students, I try to debunk these misconceptions and allow them to find the research that captivates and inspires them. Allow your passions and interests to drive you to your destined research project. In a sense, it is like picking a show to binge for the next year. You won't binge a show that you are not interested in just like you shouldn't choose a project that you don't want to partake in. Like many things in life, research is personalized to each and every individual.\n\nOther Interests\n\nWorking Out, Advocacy and Awareness, Lover of Music and Dance, and the African Student Association President\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nI recently completed a summer research internship, in the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program through the National Science Foundation (NSF). During my eight weeks this past summer, I conducted semi-structured interviews with local Muslim community leaders in the South regarding their hate crime & victimization experiences. It was an amazing experience, especially because it closely related to the research I do through the Hate Crime Research & Policy Institute. Besides being a research assistant and teaching assistant, I am also an undergraduate research ambassador, serving on FSU's Student Council for Undergraduate Research & Creativity.\n\nResearch Project\n\nMy primary research involves utilizing open-source data to create a database of federal hate crime offenders in the United States. The focus of this project is on the offenders themselves, and later, identifying commonalities within them. These include variables such as their educational background, religious background, histories of trauma and/or victimization, as well as the extent to which radicalization/hate group involvement is present, among other factors. This work is done for Dr. Brendan Lantz, the Director of the Hate Crime Research & Policy Institute.\n\nHow has UROP impacted your time at FSU?\n\nUROP has significantly impacted my time at FSU. As a criminology major, I began my studies at FSU with the plan of going to law school or possibly joining the FBI. Since I completed the UROP program, I fell in love with research and decided instead of law school, I was passionate about pursuing my Ph.D. in Criminology & Justice Policy. I had always been interested in activism from a young age, and social science research provided me with the tools to identify and analyze greater issues within our justice system.\n\nOther Interests\n\nI am a huge fan of horror movies, going to FSU's basketball games, and spending time at Strozier with my friends!\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nResearch Project\n\nMy research focuses on using artificial intelligence (AI) in health informatics to help patients, especially the elderly, understand medical lab test results better. I'm working on a project called LabGenie, where we're training AI models to answer questions about lab results accurately. But sometimes, patients don't know what questions to ask or may get the wrong information. So, the goal is to figure out how to make the AI smarter by finding trustworthy health sources and organizing them into a format that the AI can understand. This way, patients can ask simple questions and get reliable answers. We're also making it easy for patients to use this system, even if they're unfamiliar with health terms. Ultimately, I hope this research helps patients feel more confident about their health decisions.\n\nHow has UROP impacted your time at FSU?\n\nUROP has impacted my time at FSU by allowing me to get a deeper understanding of my field of study and interests by having hands-on experience working on projects. I am able to approach every problem with good critical thinking and proactivity. Due to the UROP program, I am now more certain of my intentions for going to graduate school.\n\nOther Interests\n\nI enjoy reading, taking walks, and trying new foods!\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nI was lucky to be awarded an IDEA grant, and I used my project to participate in presentation and conference opportunities like Posters at the Capitol and ACC Meeting of the Minds.\n\nResearch Project\n\nCurrently, I am not involved in research. However, my previous research experiences focused on clinical psychology, particularly trauma and anxiety.\n\nHow has UROP impacted your time at FSU?\n\nUROP allowed me to gain research experiences that greatly influenced my time at FSU and supported my academic growth. I have met incredible mentors and peer researchers through UROP, and the program also allowed me to pursue other amazing opportunities like conferences and networking. Without UROP, I would not have been able to accomplish many of my goals that I had when I initially chose to attend FSU.\n\nOther Interests\n\nIn my free time, I love baking, knitting, and hanging out with my cats at home!\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nResearch Project\n\nMy current research is centered around hate crime offenders. We are attempting to build a database to attach typologies to the offenders, as well as to mine as much information about them as possible. The typologies we use are retaliatory, defensive, mission, and thrill-seeking. The database has a set of holistic factors such as offender background, motivation, crime, victim background, location, etc. We use these pieces of information to determine what typology category the offender fits under.\n\nHow do you hope to impact your students as a UROP Leader?\n\nI hope that as a UROP leader, I can impact students in a positive way. I would love to inspire them not only in their field of study, but to push their boundaries so that they explore new academic fields. I want them to feel comfortable with research, mentor relationships, public speaking, and research dissemination. My goal is for everyone to leave my class knowing that they are ready for any and all research opportunities that they may experience through FSU and beyond.\n\nOther Interests\n\nI play the violin. I’m a very sporty person- I’ve played tennis for almost seven years but I enjoy playing all sports. I am really interested in volunteering as well so I am very involved in my commmunity.\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nDuring the Summer of 2021, I worked with Doctor Frankie Wong and Doctor Eugenia Millender from the FSU Center for Population Sciences for Health Equity. I completed abstract screenings that explored how prejudice and racism negatively impact minority groups with cardiovascular diseases. Throughout this research experience, I learned how to use the software program known as Covidence.\n\nResearch Project\n\nMy research focused on the effects that siblings have on childhood obesity. My research mentor for this project was Doctor SoHyun Park from the FSU College of Nursing. During this research project, I learned how to analyze scientific literature and how to conduct a literature review. I collaborated with another student and presented my findings at the Undergraduate Spring 2021 Symposium. According to my findings, children who have other siblings are less likely to become obese throughout their childhood.\n\nHow has UROP impacted your time at FSU?\n\nThe UROP program has been one of the highlights of my time at Florida State University. During my sophomore year, I joined the UROP program and fell in love with research. My UROP Leaders motivated me to work hard on my research project and inspired me to become a UROP Leader. Their guidance and knowledge about research helped me prosper in my research experience. The most rewarding part about becoming a UROP Leader is seeing my students thrive in their research projects. When I attended the Spring 2021 Undergraduate Symposium, I was filled with joy because I had how their hard work paid off. Lastly, the UROP program has introduced me to other students who enjoy teaching also conducting research. I cannot wait to see the impact that my fellow UROP Leaders and students will have on the field of research.\n\nOther Interests\n\nAs a nursing major, I am interested in the health disparities that exist in the healthcare field. In the future, I hope to explore different ways that we can promote social inclusivity and reduce the mortality rates in some minority groups. I have begun to work on promoting social inclusivity at the FSU College of Nursing by serving on the Seminole Nursing Executive Board as the \"Breakthrough to Nursing Director.\" My main role is to promote social change in the college, as well as to encourage more minority groups to join the FSU College of Nursing. Lastly, when I graduate I hope to work in a Level I Trauma Intensive Care Unit as a Registered Nurse.\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nResearch Project\n\nMy research focus within Social Psychology is on prejudice, bias, and social motivations, with cross-cultural analysis. My current research explores the intergroup dynamic of prejudice, the perceived malleability of prejudiced mindsets, and how we can promote collective action for groups experiencing oppression. My previous UROP project titled “The Malleability of Prejudiced Mindsets\" was a Psychological exploration of these two questions: 1) Do people with prejudiced mindsets have the capacity for change? and; 2) How do beliefs about prejudice change the way people interact?\n\nHow do you hope to impact your students as a UROP Leader?\n\nMy goal as a UROP leader is to be a facilitator of personal growth, a motivator for academic challenge, and a cheerleader for student achievement. My philosophy on teaching stems from the belief that every student deserves to feel like they have a valued role in the classroom, regardless of identity or educational level. As a student-teacher with a psychology and cross-cultural communications focus, I understand the ways that students of diverse cultural backgrounds and learning styles contribute to the classroom in unique and important ways. Every student should feel welcome in the educational space we create together, allowing students to feel that they are an integral part of a team of learners. To me, learning is about challenging oneself to grow, engaging in critical thinking, and fostering curiosity. I encourage students not to just leave learning to the classroom, but to use the skills they have gained throughout their experience with me as a leader in all areas of their lives. It is essential to create an open dialogue from leader to student, enabling students to feel comfortable and confident speaking about any issues that they may be facing so we can work to build a solution that is best for them. In my UROP Colloquium, I implement evidence-based strategies for the greatest level of success among my students. Cooperative learning and inquiry-based approaches allow students to use think-pair-share and small group collaborations to encourage critical thinking and independent research. It is my hope that by leading in a compassionate, communicative, structured, and dedicated manner, I can facilitate the development of mutual trust, respect, and empathy. Ultimately, I aim to uplift my students in order for them to achieve the greatest degree of personal fulfillment from their research opportunities and from the UROP program as a whole.\n\nOther Interests\n\nCatch me hammocking on Landis, weightlifting with Girl Gains, volunteering with the Food Recovery Network around campus, and working as an Ambassador for International Programs!\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nThis summer, 2024, I will be attending the Oxford University Consortium of Human Rights to collaborate with students from across the country in the UK! This includes attending workshops, lectures, discussions, and more with professors, peers, scholars, and even FSU students and faculty! I am super excited for this opportunity and to see how it relates to the research I do here!\n\nAs a UROP student my freshman year, I assisted my mentor, Bobbie Renfro, in the preparing and analyzing of samples and photographs of her experimental sponges implemented into Alligator Reef in Islamorada Key, Florida. This was under the jurisdiction of Dr. Wulff in the FSU Marine Biology Labs. Later that year, I ran my own in lab experiment determining the amount of food necessary to keep marine sponge organisms alive in a closed aquaculture system in the lab. I then presented my research at the Undergraduate Research Symposium, and presented my findings at the 2023 Florida Undergraduate Research Conference. There, I was able to connect with researchers, professors and universities around the state and the world! I continued on volunteering in the Wulff Laboratory until the end of Spring 2023 and even went to Islamorada with my mentor on a brief field excursion to check her samples in the wild for updates!\n\nResearch Project\n\nThis past year I assisted in the meta-analysis data collection lab under PhD Candidate, Julia Saltzman in the Marine Turtle Research, Ecology, and Conservation group with Dr. Mariana Fuentes. I, then, conducted my own mini meta-analysis on the interactions between orca whales and vessels, created a poster and presented that at the 2024 Florida Undergraduate Research Conference.\n\nHow has UROP impacted your time at FSU?\n\nUROP not only opened my eyes to an entirely new field of study that I have fallen in love with, but it made me feel more connected and at home on campus. This program allows me to get experience first hand in specific areas within my field and provide me the chance to learn and grow alongside esteemed faculty, graduate students, and peers. My UROP mentor has become more than just that, she is a friend and guide. She has been able to connect me with new laboratories and opportunities that I would have never learned about. And being able to present my personal research at conferences across the state is incredibly fulfilling and I have learned so much from the feedback I received! Joining UROP was one of the best things I did as a Freshman at FSU, and I strongly encourage everyone to apply!\n\nOther Interests\n\nThis is my second year teaching UROP and I absolutely LOVE IT! We had so much fun in class last year and I cannot wait to do it again this year!\n\nI love marine animals and hope to one day own my own marine mammal sanctuary! I am planning to study Marine Biology Conservation and Policy in a PhD program post-grad! As a Classics second major, I learn a lot about Greek history and mythology and absolutely love it! If you are at all interested, I would love to chat more about that!\n\nHere are some other orgs I am involved in on campus:\n\n- (future) 4th year member of the FSU Flying High Circus\n\n- (forwarded) Executive Directer of the SGA Jewish Student Union\n\n- Phi Mu Sorority\n\n- FSU Honors Program\n\n- Global Citizenship Certificate (future) Recipient\n\n- Order of Omega Member\n\n- FSU College of Arts and Sciences Philanthropy Advisor (Student Foundation)\n\n- Garnet and Gold Scholar Society Member\n\n- FSU International Programs: Florence 2023 Summer Program\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nResearch Project\n\nI am currently in an evolutionary social psychology lab studying how people respond to selfish behaviors in group dynamics. I find all social psychology interesting but social evolutionary psychology specifically has quickly become one of my passions in research. It takes into account how the environment of our evolutionary ancestors can translate to our behaviors today in modern environments that often don't match those of our past.\n\nHow has UROP impacted your time at FSU?\n\nWhen I first applied to UROP I wanted to get involved with research because I knew it was important for grad school. However, since then UROP has opened up so many doors to amazing opportunities. I got to present at research conferences outside of just FSU, which inspired a passion for not just conducting research but sharing and teaching on the findings! I also got to make great connections, not just my mentor but my prospective PI for my honors thesis next semester, which I would not have been able to conduct had I not taken part in UROP. It has truly been such a powerful tool to more possibilities on campus.\n\nOther Interests\n\nResearch Involvement\n\nWith research, I have participated in various legal public service endeavors. In Summer 2023, I served as an Intern Investigator at the Public Defender Services for the District of Columbia providing effective representation to adult & juvenile indigent defendants accused of the most complex & serious crimes. Alongside, I served as a Legal Intern at do Campo & Thornton, P.A. representing victims of international terrorism by achieving compensation through the United States Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Act. Additionally, I served as an Investigative Intern at the Leon County Public Defender's Office by conducting in-custody in-takes of indigent defendants accused of misdemeanor offenses. As I plan to become a Public Defender, I hope to continue developing the emotional intelligence, knowledge, & influential experience to pursue effective advocacy efforts in protecting the constitutional rights of indigent defendants facing death sentences.\n\nResearch Project\n\nAt the DeVoe L. Moore Center in the College of Social Sciences & Public Policy under the supervision of Dr. Crystal Taylor & Dr. Samuel Staley, I research the usage of eminent domain in regards to a public infrastructure project within the City of Tallahassee, Capital Cascades Trail Project. I examine compensation provided to displaced tenants of Boynton-Still, a historically vulnerable Black neighborhood. The dissemination & publication of such research serves to promote civic engagement within local government proceedings, knowledge of federal requirements, & advocacy towards preventing the removal of Black communities. I presented at the Undergraduate Research Symposium, the DeVoe L. Moore Fall & Spring Symposium, & the Florida Undergraduate Research Conference & will be conducting an Honors in the Major Thesis.\n\nHow do you hope to impact your students as a UROP Leader?\n\nI serve to impact students by understanding the importance of research as a platform to promote advocacy about societal issues in fields of social sciences & humanities. I aim to provide mentorship throughout the colloquium to ensure students have the necessary guidance, knowledge, & support to overcome challenges & engage in personal & academic growth. I hope to encourage students to be confident in pursuing interests through conducting research as well as other involvement at Florida State University to develop impactful experiences be applied in future career endeavors.\n\nOther Interests\n\nUniversity Honors Program, Honors in the Major, Honors Legal Scholars Program, Institute of Politics Fellowship, Center for the Advancement of Human Rights, Global Scholars Program, Garnet & Gold Key Leadership Honorary, The DeVoe L.
