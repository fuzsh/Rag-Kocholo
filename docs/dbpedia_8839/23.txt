For the 69th year, the Town of Robbins closed its streets for Farmers Day, which the fire department hosts as a fundraiser.

Things kicked off Thursday with the Farmers Day 5K and gospel music night. On Friday night, bands performed on two stages, and people could see the glow of fireworks for miles. Vendors lined the streets both nights, and the smell of funnel cakes, BBQ, turkey legs, and other carnival foods filled the air. Kids enjoyed rides and games.

Saturday morning, the horse parade took over the streets, with hundreds lining the sidewalk to see the wagons and horses. In the afternoon, the tractor parade finished just before severe weather sent everyone running for cover.

After the storms cleared, the town and fire department announced on their Facebook pages that Farmers Day was back on. Most vendors and food trucks opened back up, and bands went on as planned.

Dr. William McDuffie received the Robbins Hometown Hero Award.
