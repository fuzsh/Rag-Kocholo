        "text": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature is awarded annually to an author from any country who has, in the words of Alfred Nobel, produced \"the most outstanding work of an idealistic tendency\". The \"work\" in this case generally refers to an author's work as a whole, not to any individual work, though individual works are sometimes cited in the awards. The Swedish Academy decides who, if anyone, will receive the prize in any given year.\n\nThe original citation of Nobel's will led to much controversy. In the original Swedish, the word idealisk can be translated as either \"idealistic\" or \"ideal\". In earlier years the Nobel Committee stuck closely to the intent of the will, and left out certain world-renowned writers such as Leo Tolstoy and Henrik Ibsen for the Prize, probably because their works were not \"idealistic\" enough. In later years the wording is interpreted much more liberally, and the Prize is awarded, as is often argued that it should be, for lasting literary merit. However, the award continues to generate some amount of controversy as more famous names in literature are sometimes neglected in favor of less widely received ones, as in Dario Fo in 1997. However, this may be seen as unavoidable in all literary awards based on subjective opinions. Whether or not the committee has been unduly biased towards certain political perspectives is a matter of discussion.\n\nContents\n\n1 Nomination procedure\n\n2 List of Nobel Laureates in Literature\n\n3 See also\n\n4 External links\n\nNomination procedure\n\nEach year the Swedish Academy sends out requests for nominations of candidates for the Nobel Prize in Literature. Members of the Academy, members of literature academies and societies, professors of literature and language, former Nobel literature laureates, and the presidents of writers' organizations are all allowed to nominate a candidate. However, it is not possible to nominate oneself.\n\nThousands of requests are sent out each year, and about fifty proposals are returned. These proposals must be received by the Academy by February 1, after which they are examined by the Nobel Committee. By April, the Academy narrows the field to around twenty candidates, and by summer the list is reduced further to some five names. In October that year, members of the Academy vote, and the candidate who receives more than half the number of votes is named the Nobel Laureate in Literature. The process is similar to those of other Nobel Prizes.\n\nThe prize money of the Nobel Prize has been fluctuating since its inauguration but as present stands at 10 million Swedish krona. The winner also wins a gold medal and a Nobel diploma.\n\nList of Nobel Laureates in Literature\n\nList of Nobel Prize laureates in Literature from 1901 to the present day.\n\nYear Name Country Language(s) 1901 Sully Prudhomme France French 1902 Theodor Mommsen Germany German 1903 BjÃ¸rnstjerne BjÃ¸rnson Norway Norwegian 1904 FrÃ©dÃ©ric Mistral France Occitan JosÃ© Echegaray y Eizaguirre Spain Spanish 1905 Henryk Sienkiewicz Poland Polish 1906 GiosuÃ¨ Carducci Italy Italian 1907 Rudyard Kipling United Kingdom English 1908 Rudolf Christoph Eucken Germany German 1909 Selma LagerlÃ¶f Sweden Swedish 1910 Paul Heyse Germany German 1911 Count Maurice Maeterlinck Belgium French 1912 Gerhart Hauptmann Germany German 1913 Rabindranath Tagore India Bengali 1915 Romain Rolland France French 1916 Verner von Heidenstam Sweden Swedish 1917 Karl Adolph Gjellerup Denmark Danish Henrik Pontoppidan Denmark Danish 1919 Carl Spitteler Switzerland German 1920 Knut Hamsun Norway Norwegian 1921 Anatole France France French 1922 Jacinto Benavente Spain Spanish 1923 William Butler Yeats Ireland English 1924 WÅadysÅaw Reymont Poland Polish 1925 George Bernard Shaw Ireland English 1926 Grazia Deledda Italy Italian 1927 Henri Bergson France French 1928 Sigrid Undset Norway Norwegian 1929 Thomas Mann Germany German 1930 Sinclair Lewis United States English 1931 Erik Axel Karlfeldt Sweden Swedish 1932 John Galsworthy United Kingdom English 1933 Ivan Alekseyevich Bunin Russia (in exile) Russian 1934 Luigi Pirandello Italy Italian 1936 Eugene O'Neill United States English 1937 Roger Martin du Gard France French 1938 Pearl S.
