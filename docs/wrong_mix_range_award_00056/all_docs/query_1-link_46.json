Of late, it has been interpreted to favor authors promoting human rights. The Nobel prize literature winners award was established by Swedish dynamite inventor Alfred Nobel. The Nobel prize literature winners prize includes a gold medal, a diploma, money and international recognition. The Nobel prizes are presented annually on 10th December (the anniversary of Nobel’s death) in the Stockholm town hall, Sweden. Five other Nobel Prizes are also awarded for outstanding contributions in physics, chemistry, medicine/physiology, economic sciences and peace.\n\nNobel prize literature winners list compiled by A C, last updated\n\nADDucation Tips: Click column headings with arrows to sort Nobel prize literature winners.
