        "text": "Literature 1963\n\nGiorgos Seferis (ÎÎ¹ÏÏÎ³Î¿Ï Î£ÎµÏÎ­ÏÎ·Ï) (February 29, 1900 â September 20, 1971) was one of the most important Greek poets of the 20th century. He also pursued a career in the Greek foreign service, culminating in his appointment as Ambassador to the UK, a post which he held from 1957 to 1962.\n\n'Seferis' was a pen name, a variation on his family name, Seferiadis.\n\nBiography\n\nSeferis was born in Urla near Smyrna in Asia Minor (now Ä°zmir, Turkey). His father, Stelios Seferiadis, was a lawyer, and later a professor at the University of Athens, as well as a poet and translator in his own right. He was also a staunch Venizelist and a supporter of the demotic Greek language over the formal, official language (katharevousa). Both of these attitudes influenced his son. In 1914 the family moved to Athens, where Seferis completed his secondary school education. He continued his studies in Paris from 1918 to 1925, studying law at the Sorbonne. While he was there, in September 1922, Smyrna was occupied by the Turks and its Greek population, including Seferis' family, fled. Seferis would not visit Smyrna again until 1950; the sense of being an exile from his childhood home would inform much of Seferis' poetry, showing itself particularly in his interest in the story of Odysseus.\n\nMarried Maria Zannou ('Maro') on 10th April 1941.\n\nIn exile with the Greek government in Egypt and South Africa during the Second World War.\n\nSeferis was greatly influenced by Kavafis, T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound.\n\nCyprus\n\nSeferis first visited Cyprus in 1952. He immediately fell in love with the island, partly because of its resemblance, in its landscape, the mixture of populations, and in its traditions, to his childhood summer home in Skala. His book of poems Imerologio Katastromatos III was inspired by the island, and mostly written there â bringing to an end a period of six or seven years in which Seferis had not produced any poetry. Its original title was Cyprus, where it was ordained for meâ¦, a quotation from Euripidesâ Helen, in which Helenâs brother Teucer states that Apollo has decreed that Cyprus shall be his home; it made clear the optimistic sense of homecoming Seferis felt on discovering the island. Seferis changed the title in the 1959 edition of his poems.\n\nPolitically, Cyprus was entangled in the dispute between the UK, Greece and Turkey over its international status. Over the next few years, Seferis made use of his position in the diplomatic service to strive towards a resolution of the Cyprus dispute, investing a great deal of personal effort and emotion. This was one of the few areas in his life in which he allowed the personal and the political to mix.\n\nThe Nobel Prize\n\nIn 1963, Seferis was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature \"for his eminent lyrical writing, inspired by a deep feeling for the Hellenic world of culture.\" [1] Seferis was the first Greek to receive the prize (and the only, until Odysseas Elytis became a Nobel laureate in 1979). His nationality, and the role he had played in the 20th century renaissance of Greek literature and culture, were probably a large contributing factor to the award decision. But in his acceptance speech, Seferis chose to emphasise his own humanist philosophy, concluding: \"When on his way to Thebes Oedipus encountered the Sphinx, his answer to its riddle was: 'Man'. That simple word destroyed the monster. We have many monsters to destroy. Let us think of the answer of Oedipus.\" [2] While Seferis has sometimes been considered a nationalist poet, his 'Hellenism' had more to do with his identifying a unifying strand of humanism in the continuity of Greek culture and literature.\n\nStatement of 1969\n\nIn 1967 the repressive nationalist, right-wing Regime of the Colonels took power in Greece after a coup d'Ã©tat. After two years marked by widespread censorship, political detentions and torture, Seferis took a stand against the regime. On 28 March 1969, he made a statement on the BBC World Service [3], with copies simultaneously distributed to every newspaper in Athens. In authoritative and absolute terms, he stated \"This anomaly must end\".\n\nSeferis did not live to see the end of the junta in 1974, the direct result of Turkeyâs invasion of Cyprus, which had been prompted by the juntaâs attempt to overthrow Cyprusâ Archbishop Makarios.\n\nAt his funeral, huge crowds followed his coffin through the streets of Athens, singing Mikis Theodorakisâ setting of Seferisâ poem 'Denial' (then banned); he had become a popular hero for his resistance to the regime.\n\nOther\n\nIn 1999, there was a dispute over the naming of a street in Ãzmir Yorgos Seferis Sokagi (a Turkification of Giorgos Seferis), due to continuing ill-feeling around the Greco-Turkish War in the 1920s.\n\nIn 2004, the band Sigmatropic released \"16 Haikus and Other Stories,\" an LP dedicated to and lyrically derived from Seferis' work.\n\nWorks\n\nPoetry\n\nStrofi Î£ÏÏÎ¿ÏÎ® (1931)\n\nSterna Î£ÏÎ­ÏÎ½Î± (1932)\n\nMythistorima (1935)\n\nTetradio Gymnasmaton (1940)\n\nImerologio Katastromatos I (1940)\n\nImerologio Katastromatos II (1944)\n\nKichli (1947)\n\nImerologio Katastromatos III (1955)\n\nTria Kryfa Poiimata (1966)\n\nProse\n\nDokimes (Essays) 3 vols.
