        "text": "There is hardly any speculation about the status of Nobel Prize. The people who outperform in their fields and have creative or intellectual achievements are honored by this prestigious award.\n\nNobel Prize was initiated in 1901 and is given in honor of Alfred Nobel who was a Swedish chemist, engineer, inventor, businessman, and philanthropist. Since then it is the most prestigious award that outweighs all other awards. It sets the excellence status for generations to come. Nobel Prize is given for various fields including medicine, mathematics, chemistry, literature, peace, physiology, physics.\n\nNobel Prize is given for literature as well. Literature is the field of study that continues to travel through time and space. It reveals the holistic picture of the society- historic, social, cultural, political, and economic fronts. By studying literature, one becomes capable of interpreting things in a manner which perhaps none but they can. Literature is not based on hard and fast rules. It accepts the individual perspectives, provided a due support to one’s argument is presented.\n\nHere is a table representing the winners of Nobel Prize in literature, with the country winning the maximum awards on the top.\n\nYear Laureate Country Language(s) Genre(s) 1901 Sully Prudhomme France French poetry, essay 1904 Frédéric Mistral France Provençal poetry, philology 1915 Romain Rolland France French novel 1921 Anatole France France French novel, poetry 1927 Henri Bergson France French philosophy 1933 Ivan Bunin France (Born in Russian Empire) Russian short story, poetry, novel 1937 Roger Martin du Gard France French novel 1947 André Gide France French novel, essay 1952 François Mauriac France French novel, short story 1957 Albert Camus France (Born in French Algeria) French novel, short story, drama, philosophy, essay 1960 Saint-John Perse France (Born in Guadeloupe) French poetry 1964 Jean-Paul Sartre France French novel, philosophy, drama, literary criticism, screenplay 1985 Claude Simon France (Born in French Madagascar) French novel 2000 Gao Xingjian France (since 1998) China (1940–1998) Chinese novel, drama, literary criticism 2008 J.
