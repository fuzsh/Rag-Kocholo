        "text": "George Seferis (born March 13, 1900, Smyrna, Anatolia, Ottoman Empire [now İzmir, Tur.]—died Sept. 20, 1971, Athens, Greece) was a Greek poet, essayist, and diplomat who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1963.\n\nAfter studying law in Paris, Seferis joined the Greek diplomatic service and served in London and Albania prior to World War II, during which time he was in exile with the free Greek government. Following the war he held posts in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Iraq and served as Greek ambassador in London (1957–62).\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nFamous Poets and Poetic Form\n\nSeferis was at once acclaimed as “the poet of the future” on the publication of Strofí (1931; “Turning Point”), his first collection of poems. It was followed by I stérna (1932; “The Cistern”), Mithistórima (1935; “Myth-History”), Imerolóyio katastrómatos I (1940; “Log Book I”), Tetrádhio yimnasmáton (1940; “Exercise Book”), Imerolóyio katastrómatos II (1945), the long poem Kíkhli (1947; “Thrush”), Imerolóyio katastrómatos III (1955), and Tría krifá poiímata (1966; “Three Secret Poems”). Selections of his poetry have been widely translated; the most comprehensive collection in English translation is George Seferis: Complete Poems (1995). Seferis also translated poetry into Greek and wrote essays."
