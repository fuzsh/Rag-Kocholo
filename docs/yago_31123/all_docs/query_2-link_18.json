        "text": "Anterolateral ankle impingement: findings and diagnostic accuracy with ultrasound imaging.\n\nPubMed\n\nMcCarthy, C L; Wilson, D J; Coltman, T P\n\n2008-03-01\n\nThe objective was to evaluate the findings and diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound in antero-lateral ankle impingement (ALI) with clinical and arthroscopic correlation. Seventeen elite footballers with chronic ankle pain were referred for ultrasound with a clinical diagnosis of ALI (n = 8) or a control condition (n = 9; lateral mechanical instability, osteochondral defect, intra-articular bodies and osteoarthritis). Ultrasound examination included the antero-lateral gutter for abnormal synovial tissue (synovitic lesion), lateral ligament integrity, tibiotalar joint and osseous spurs of the distal tibia and talus. Ultrasound findings were correlated with subsequent arthroscopic appearance. Ultrasound examination detected a synovitic mass in the antero-lateral gutter in all 8 footballers with clinical ALI (100%) and in 2 patients with a control diagnosis (22%). Arthroscopic correlation of antero-lateral synovitis and fibrosis was present in all 10 cases (100%). The synovitic lesion was seen at ultrasound as a nodular soft tissue mass of mixed echogenicity within the antero-lateral gutter, which extruded anteriorly with manual compression of the distal fibula against the tibia. Increased blood supply was detected using power Doppler imaging in only 1 patient. The synovitic lesion measured >10 mm in its maximum dimension in 7 footballers with clinical ALI and <10 mm in the control group. Additional ultrasound findings in patients with abnormal antero-lateral synovial tissue included an anterior talofibular ligament injury in all patients (n = 10), a tibiotalar joint effusion (n = 6) and osseous spurs (n = 4). Antero-lateral synovitic tissue was accurately identified at ultrasound in the absence of an effusion (n = 4). No synovitic lesion was detected at ultrasound or arthroscopy in the remaining 7 patients with a control diagnosis. Ultrasound is accurate in detecting synovitic lesions within the antero-lateral gutter, demonstrating associated ligamentous injuries and in\n\nThe arm posture in children with unilateral Cerebral Palsy is mainly related to antero-posterior gait instability.\n\nPubMed\n\nMeyns, Pieter; Duysens, Jacques; Desloovere, Kaat\n\n2016-09-01\n\nIn this observational case-control study we aimed to determine whether altered arm postures in children with unilateral CP (uniCP) are related to gait instability in a specific direction. Antero-posterior and medio-lateral Foot Placement Estimator instability measures and arm posture measures (vertical and antero-posterior hand position, sagittal and frontal upper arm elevation angle) were determined in eleven uniCP (7 years-10 months) and twenty-four typically developing children (9 years-6 months) at two walking speeds. Spearman-rank correlation analyses were made to examine the relationship between antero-posterior and medio-lateral arm posture and gait instability. Arm posture in both planes was related to antero-posterior instability (e.g. sagittal and frontal upper arm elevation angle correlated moderately with antero-posterior instability; R=0.41, p<0.001, R=-0.47, p<0.001). In uniCP, increased antero-posterior instability was associated with a higher (R=-0.62, p=0.002) and more frontal position of the hemiplegic hand (R=-0.58, p=0.005), while the non-hemiplegic upper arm was rotated more backward (R=0.63, p=0.002) and both upper arms rotated more sideways (hemiplegic: R=-0.58, p=0.004; non-hemiplegic: R=-0.55, p=0.008). The altered non-hemiplegic (sagittal and frontal) arm posture in uniCP may be a compensation to reduce antero-posterior gait instability. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

An array of potential specific targets for pharmacologic intervention can be applied to ALI/ARDS as one disease. Although a working definition of ALI/ARDS that includes pulmonary and extrapulmonary causes can have benefit in standardizing supportive care, it can also complicate assessments of the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. In this article, definitions that have been recently used for ALI/ARDS in various clinical studies are discussed individually. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Inc.

CT enables skeletal muscle to be quantified, whereas BMI cannot accurately reflect body composition. The purpose was to evaluate prognostic value of modified ALI (mALI) using CT-determined L3 muscle index (L3MI, muscle area at L3/height2) beyond original ALI. L3MIs were calculated using the CT images of 186 consecutive patients with SCLC taken at diagnosis, and mALI was defined as L3MI x serum albumin/NLR. Using chi-squared test determined maximum cut-offs for low ALI and low mALI, the prognostic values of low ALI and low mALI were tested using Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards analysis. Finally, deviance statistics was used to test whether the goodness of fit of the prognostic model is improved by adding mALI as an extra variable. Patients with low ALI (cut-off, 31.1, n = 94) had shorter OS than patients with high ALI (median, 6.8 months vs. 15.8 months; p < 0.001), and patients with low mALI (cut-off 67.7, n = 94) had shorter OS than patients with high mALI (median, 6.8 months vs. 16.5 months; p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in estimates of median survival time between low ALI and low mALI (z = 0.000, p = 1.000) and between high ALI and high mALI (z = 0.330, p = 0.740). Multivariable analysis showed that low ALI was an independent prognostic factor for shorter OS (HR, 1.67, p = 0.004), along with advanced age (HR, 1.49, p = 0.045), extensive disease (HR, 2.27, p < 0.001), supportive care only (HR, 7.86, p < 0.001), and elevated LDH (HR, 1.45, p = 0.037). Furthermore, goodness of fit of this prognostic model was not significantly increased by adding mALI as an extra variable (LR difference = 2.220, p = 0.136). The present study confirms mALI using CT-determined L3MI has no additional prognostic value beyond original ALI using BMI.

It has been found that the new A-Li bond appearing upon the addition of Li/sup +/ to Ali/sub k/ is formed with the participation of only the p/sub A/ AO's from the atom A. In contrast to the case of the hydrides AK/sub k/ and the fluorides AF/sub k/, in the case of the lithides ALi/sub k/ and ALi/sub k+1//sup +/, themoreÂ Â» lone pair of the atom A consists of its almost pure s/sub A/ AO, which maintains its spherical shape, is not active stereochemically, and practically does not participate in the bonding.

The bonding in them is delocalized over all the atoms comparing the molecule, and the two-center approach and Gillespie's rules are, in principle, not suitable.Â«Â less\n\nThe changes of lumbar muscle flexion-relaxation phenomenon due to antero-posteriorly slanted ground surfaces.\n\nPubMed\n\nHu, Boyi; Ning, Xiaopeng; Dai, Fei; Almuhaidib, Ibrahim\n\n2016-09-01\n\nUneven ground surface is a common occupational injury risk factor in industries such as agriculture, fishing, transportation and construction. Studies have shown that antero-posteriorly slanted ground surfaces could reduce spinal stability and increase the risk of falling. In this study, the influence of antero-posteriorly slanted ground surfaces on lumbar flexion-relaxation responses was investigated. Fourteen healthy participants performed sagittally symmetric and asymmetric trunk bending motions on one flat and two antero-posteriorly slanted surfaces (-15Â° (uphill facing) and 15Â° (downhill facing)), while lumbar muscle electromyography and trunk kinematics were recorded. Results showed that standing on a downhill facing slanted surface delays the onset of lumbar muscle flexion-relaxation phenomenon (FRP), while standing on an uphill facing ground causes lumbar muscle FRP to occur earlier. In addition, compared to symmetric bending, when performing asymmetric bending, FRP occurred earlier on the contralateral side of lumbar muscles and significantly smaller maximum lumbar flexion and trunk inclination angles were observed. Practitioner Summary: Uneven ground surface is a common risk factor among a number of industries. In this study, we investigated the influence of antero-posteriorly slanted ground surface on trunk biomechanics during trunk bending. Results showed the slanted surface alters the lumbar tissue load-sharing mechanism in both sagittally symmetric and asymmetric bending.\n\nSurfactant Therapy of ALI and ARDS\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRaghavendran, K; Willson, D; Notter, RH\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThis article examines exogenous lung surfactant replacement therapy and its utility in mitigating clinical acute lung injury (ALI) and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Biophysical research has documented that lung surfactant dysfunction can be reversed or mitigated by increasing surfactant concentration, and multiple studies in animals with ALI/ARDS have shown that respiratory function and pulmonary mechanics in vivo can be improved by exogenous surfactant administration. Exogenous surfactant therapy is a routine intervention in neonatal intensive care, and is life-saving in preventing or treating the neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS) in premature infants. In applications relevant for lung injury-related respiratory failure and ALI/ARDS, surfactant therapy has been shown to be beneficial in term infants with pneumonia and meconium aspiration lung injury, and in children up to age 21 with direct pulmonary forms of ALI/ARDS. However, extension of exogenous surfactant therapy to adults with respiratory failure and clinical ALI/ARDS remains a challenge. Coverage here reviews clinical studies of surfactant therapy in pediatric and adult patients with ALI/ARDS, particularly focusing on its potential advantages in patients with direct pulmonary forms of these syndromes. Also discussed is the rationale for mechanism-based therapies utilizing exogenous surfactant in combination with agents targeting other aspects of the multifaceted pathophysiology of inflammatory lung injury. Additional factors affecting the efficacy of exogenous surfactant therapy in ALI/ARDS are also described, including the difficulty of effectively delivering surfactants to injured lungs and the existence of activity differences between clinical surfactant drugs.

The partitioning of the source program among the processors is automatically accomplished. The code is converted into a data flow graph, analyzed and divided among the processors to minimize the overall execution time in the presence of interprocessor communication delays. This paper describes ALI from the user's point of view and includes a detailed example of the application of ALI to a specific dynamic system simulation.\n\nCan tibial plateau fractures be reduced and stabilised through an angiosome-sparing antero-lateral approach?\n\nPubMed\n\nSolomon, Lucian B; Boopalan, P R J V C; Chakrabarty, Adhiraj; Callary, Stuart A\n\n2014-04-01\n\nTibial plateau fractures (TPFs) are an independent, non-modifiable risk factor for surgical site infections (SSIs). Current antero-lateral approaches to the knee dissect through the anterior tibial angiosome (ATA), which may contribute to a higher rate of SSIs. The aim of this study was to develop an angiosome-sparing antero-lateral approach to allow reduction and fixation of lateral TPFs and to investigate its feasibility in a consecutive cohort. Twenty cadaveric knees were dissected to define the position of the vessels supplying the ATA from the lateral tibial condyle to the skin perforators. Based on these results, an angiosome-sparing surgical approach to treat lateral TPFs was developed. Fifteen consecutive patients were subsequently treated through this approach. Clinical outcomes included assessment of SSI and Lysholm score. Fracture healing and stability were assessed using the Rasmussen score and radiostereometric analysis (RSA). At the latest follow-up between 1 and 4 years, there was no report of SSI. Nine patients (60%) had good or excellent Lysholm scores. The mean Rasmussen score at final follow-up was 17 (median 18, range 14-18) with 10 patients (66%) graded as excellent. Fracture fragment migration measured using RSA was below 2mm in all cases. This study has demonstrated that an angiosome-sparing antero-lateral approach to the lateral tibial plateau is feasible. Adequate stability of these fracture types was achieved by positioning a buttress plate away from the bone and superficial to the regional fascial layer as an 'internal-external fixator'. The angiosome-sparing approach developed was able to be used in a prospective cohort and the clinical results to date are encouraging. Future clinical studies need to investigate the potential benefits of this surgical approach when compared with the previously described antero-lateral approaches. Crown Copyright Â© 2013.

Surgical resection is usually recommended in case of morbidity associated with the goiterâs mass effect or for suspicion of malignancy difficult to diagnose without resection. Intrathoracic goiters are usually resected through a cervical approach, with sternotomy needed in selected cases. We report a case of antero mediastinal retrosternal goiter in old age patient undergoing surgical excision by combined cervical and hybrid robot-assisted approach. All steps of the thoracic procedure were completely performed using the da Vinci robot system with final extension of a port-site incision to extract the specimen. This approach provides more advantages than sternotomy regarding post operative clinical benefits and allows a more accurate surgical resection in the antero-superior mediastinum than conventional thoracoscopy. PMID:29707373\n\nContemporary ventilator management in patients with and at risk of ALI/ARDS.\n\nPubMed\n\nChang, Steven Y; Dabbagh, Ousama; Gajic, Ognen; Patrawalla, Amee; Elie, Marie-Carmelle; Talmor, Daniel S; Malhotra, Atul; Adesanya, Adebola; Anderson, Harry L; Blum, James M; Park, Pauline K; Gong, Michelle Ng\n\n2013-04-01\n\nVentilator practices in patients at risk for acute lung injury (ALI) and ARDS are unclear. We examined factors associated with choice of set tidal volumes (VT), and whether VT < 8 mL/kg predicted body weight (PBW) relates to the development of ALI/ARDS. We performed a secondary analysis of a multicenter cohort of adult subjects at risk of lung injury with and without ALI/ARDS at onset of invasive ventilation. Descriptive statistics were used to describe ventilator practices in specific settings and ALI/ARDS risk groups. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the factors associated with the use of VT < 8 mL/kg PBW and the relationship of VT to ALI/ARDS development and outcome. Of 829 mechanically ventilated patients, 107 met the criteria for ALI/ARDS at time of intubation, and 161 developed ALI/ARDS after intubation (post-intubation ALI/ARDS). There was significant intercenter variability in initial ventilator settings, and in the incidence of ALI/ARDS and post-intubation ALI/ARDS. The median VT was 7.96 (IQR 7.14-8.94) mL/kg PBW in ALI/ARDS subjects, and 8.45 (IQR 7.50-9.55) mL/kg PBW in subjects without ALI/ARDS (P = .004). VT decreased from 8.40 (IQR 7.38-9.37) mL/kg PBW to 7.97 (IQR 6.90-9.23) mL/kg PBW (P < .001) in those developing post-intubation ALI/ARDS. Among subjects without ALI/ARDS, VT â¥ 8 mL/kg PBW was associated with shorter height and higher body mass index, while subjects with pneumonia were less likely to get â¥ 8 mL/kg PBW. Initial VT â¥ 8 mL/kg PBW was not associated with the post-intubation ALI/ARDS (adjusted odds ratio 1.30, 95% CI 0.74-2.29) or worse outcomes. Post-intubation ALI/ARDS subjects had mortality similar to subjects intubated with ALI/ARDS. Clinicians seem to respond to ALI/ARDS with lower initial VT. Initial VT, however, was not associated with the development of post-intubation ALI/ARDS or other outcomes.\n\nCharacterization of ALD grown TixAlyN and TixAlyC thin films\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKinnunen, S. A.; Malm, J.; Arstila, K.; Lahtinen, M.; Sajavaara, T.\n\n2017-09-01\n\nAtomic layer deposition (ALD) was used to grow TixAlyN and TixAlyC thin films using trimethylaluminum (TMA), titanium tetrachloride and ammonia as precursors. Deposition temperature was varied between 325 Â°C and 500 Â°C. Films were also annealed in vacuum and N2-atmosphere at 600-1000 Â°C. Wide range of characterization methods was used including time-of-flight elastic recoil detection analysis (ToF-ERDA), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), X-ray reflectometry (XRR), Raman spectroscopy, ellipsometry, helium ion microscopy (HIM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and 4-point probe measurement for resistivity. Deposited films were roughly 100 nm thick and contained mainly desired elements. Carbon, chlorine and hydrogen were found to be the main impurities.\n\nEnhancing the AliEn Web Service Authentication\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhu, Jianlin; Saiz, Pablo; Carminati, Federico; Betev, Latchezar; Zhou, Daicui; Mendez Lorenzo, Patricia; Grigoras, Alina Gabriela; Grigoras, Costin; Furano, Fabrizio; Schreiner, Steffen; Vladimirovna Datskova, Olga; Sankar Banerjee, Subho; Zhang, Guoping\n\n2011-12-01\n\nWeb Services are an XML based technology that allow applications to communicate with each other across disparate systems. Web Services are becoming the de facto standard that enable inter operability between heterogeneous processes and systems. AliEn2 is a grid environment based on web services. The AliEn2 services can be divided in three categories: Central services, deployed once per organization; Site services, deployed on each of the participating centers; Job Agents running on the worker nodes automatically. A security model to protect these services is essential for the whole system. Current implementations of web server, such as Apache, are not suitable to be used within the grid environment. Apache with the mod_ssl and OpenSSL only supports the X.509 certificates. But in the grid environment, the common credential is the proxy certificate for the purpose of providing restricted proxy and delegation. An Authentication framework was taken for AliEn2 web services to add the ability to accept X.509 certificates and proxy certificates from client-side to Apache Web Server. The authentication framework could also allow the generation of access control policies to limit access to the AliEn2 web services.\n\n[Antero-medial incision of knee joint for the treatment of intercondylar fracture of femur].\n\nPubMed\n\nYin, Zi-Fei; Sun, Bin-Feng; Yang, Xiao-Hai; Wang, Qing; Qian, Ping-Kang; Wu, Xiao-Feng; Xu, Feng\n\n2017-12-25\n\nTo explore the clinical effect of antero-medial incision of knee joint in treating intercondylar fracture of femur. From September 2012 to March 2015, 24 patients with intercondylar fracture of femur were selected, including 17 males and 7 females, aged from 20 to 65 years old with an average of(38.3Â±9.5) years old. Among them, 12 cases were caused by traffic accident, 8 cases were caused by falling injury and 4 cases were caused by falling down. All patients were closed fractures. The time from injury to hospital was from 30 min to 8 h with an average of(2.2Â±0.3) h. According to AO classification, 4 cases were type B1, 3 type B2, 2 type B3, 5 type C1, 6 type C2 and 4 type C3. All patients were treated with antero-medial incision of knee joint. Operative time, blood loss and postoperative complications were observed and recovery of keen function was evaluated by Kolmert scoring. All patients were followed-up from 6 to 12 months with average of (9.0Â±1.7) months. Operative time ranged from 50 to 90 min with an average of (70.0Â±8.2) min; blood loss ranged from 90 to 400 ml with an average of (180Â±36) ml; negative pressure flow was from 30 to 90 ml, with an average of (50.0Â±7.1) ml. All fracture were healed at stage I without loosening of internal fixator, fracture nonunion, and deep vein thrombosis. According to Kolmert scoring, 16 patients got excellent result, 5 patients good and 3 fair. Antero-medial incision of knee joint in treating intercondylar fracture of femur, which has advantages of good fracture reduction, less injury of soft tissue and simple operation, could obtain good clinical results.\n\nCharles Bonnet syndrome in hemianopia, following antero-mesial temporal lobectomy for drug-resistant epilepsy.\n\nPubMed\n\nContardi, Sara; Rubboli, Guido; Giulioni, Marco; Michelucci, Roberto; Pizza, Fabio; Gardella, Elena; Pinardi, Federica; Bartolomei, Ilaria; Tassinari, Carlo Alberto\n\n2007-09-01\n\nCharles Bonnet syndrome (CBS) is a disorder characterized by the occurrence of complex visual hallucinations in patients with acquired impairment of vision and without psychiatric disorders. In spite of the high incidence of visual field defects following antero-mesial temporal lobectomy for refractory temporal lobe epilepsy, reports of CBS in patients who underwent this surgical procedure are surprisingly rare. We describe a patient operated on for drug-resistant epilepsy. As a result of left antero-mesial temporal resection, she presented right homonymous hemianopia. A few days after surgery, she started complaining of visual hallucinations, such as static or moving \"Lilliputian\" human figures, or countryside scenes, restricted to the hemianopic field. The patient was fully aware of their fictitious nature. These disturbances disappeared progressively over a few weeks. The incidence of CBS associated with visual field defects following epilepsy surgery might be underestimated. Patients with post-surgical CBS should be reassured that it is not an epileptic phenomenon, and that it has a benign, self-limiting, course which does not usually require treatment.\n\nAliEnâALICE environment on the GRID\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSaiz, P.; Aphecetche, L.; BunÄiÄ, P.; PiskaÄ, R.; Revsbech, J.-E.; Å ego, V.; Alice Collaboration\n\n2003-04-01\n\nAliEn ( http://alien.cern.ch) (ALICE Environment) is a Grid framework built on top of the latest Internet standards for information exchange and authentication (SOAP, PKI) and common Open Source components.

Acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) is one of the main clinical complications in severe malaria. The murine model DBA/2 reproduces the clinical signs of ALI/ARDS in humans, when infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA. High levels of HO-1 were reported in cases of severe malaria. Our data indicated that the HO-1 mRNA and protein expression are increased in mice that develop malaria-associated ALI/ARDS (MA-ALI/ARDS). Additionally, the hemin, a HO-1 inducing drug, prevented mice from developing MA-ALI/ARDS when administered prior to the development of MA-ALI/ARDS in this model. Also, hemin treatment showed an amelioration of respiratory parameters in mice, high VEGF levels in the sera, and a decrease in vascular permeability in the lung, which are signs of ALI/ARDS. Therefore, the induction of HO-1 before the development of MA-ALI/ARDS could be protective. However, the increased expression of HO-1 on the onset of MA-ALI/ARDS development may represent an effort to revert the phenotype of this syndrome by the host. We therefore confirm that HO-1 inducing drugs could be used for prevention of MA-ALI/ARDS in humans.\n\nPredictive Criteria to Study the Pathogenesis of Malaria-Associated ALI/ARDS in Mice\n\nPubMed Central\n\nOrtolan, Luana S.; Sercundes, Michelle K.; Debone, Daniela; Hagen, Stefano C. F.; D' ImpÃ©rio Lima, Maria Regina; Alvarez, JosÃ© M.; Marinho, Claudio R. F.; Epiphanio, Sabrina\n\n2014-01-01\n\nMalaria-associated acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) often results in morbidity and mortality. Murine models to study malaria-associated ALI/ARDS have been described; we still lack a method of distinguishing which mice will develop ALI/ARDS before death. This work aimed to characterize malaria-associated ALI/ARDS in a murine model and to demonstrate the first method to predict whether mice are suffering from ALI/ARDS before death. DBA/2 mice infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA developing ALI/ARDS or hyperparasitemia (HP) were compared using histopathology, PaO2 measurement, pulmonary X-ray, breathing capacity, lung permeability, and serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels according to either the day of death or the suggested predictive criteria. We proposed a model to predict malaria-associated ALI/ARDS using breathing patterns (enhanced pause and frequency respiration) and parasitemia as predictive criteria from mice whose cause of death was known to retrospectively diagnose the sacrificed mice as likely to die of ALI/ARDS as early as 7 days after infection. Using this method, we showed increased VEGF levels and increased lung permeability in mice predicted to die of ALI/ARDS. This proposed method for accurately identifying mice suffering from ALI/ARDS before death will enable the use of this model to study the pathogenesis of this disease.

The extracellular binding of the last group to the bone morphogenetic proteins prevents them from activating their receptors, and the relative ventralizer:antagonist ratio is thought to specify different dorso-ventral cell fates. Here, by taking advantage of a non-genetic interference method using a specific competitive inhibitor, the Lefty-related gene product Antivin, we provide evidence that cell fate along the antero-posterior axis of the zebrafish embryo is controlled by the morphogenetic activity of another transforming growth factor-beta superfamily subgroup--the Activin and Nodal-related factors. Increasing antivin doses progressively deleted posterior fates within the ectoderm, eventually resulting in the removal of all fates except forebrain and eyes. In contrast, overexpression of activin or nodal-related factors converted ectoderm that was fated to be forebrain into more posterior ectodermal or mesendodermal fates. We propose that modulation of intercellular signalling by Antivin/Activin and Nodal-related factors provides a mechanism for the graded establishment of cell fates along the antero-posterior axis of the zebrafish embryo.\n\nSite Protection Program and Progress Report of Ali Observatory, Tibet\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYao, Yongqiang; Zhou, Yunhe; Wang, Xiaohua; He, Jun; Zhou, Shu\n\n2015-08-01\n\nThe Ali observatory, Tibet, is a promising new site identified through ten year site survey over west China, and it is of significance to establish rules of site protection during site development. The site protection program is described with five aspects: site monitoring, technical support, local government support, specific organization, and public education. The long-term sky brightness monitoring is ready with site testing instruments and basic for light pollution measurement; the monitoring also includes directions of main light sources, providing periodical reports and suggestions for coordinating meetings. The technical supports with institutes and manufacturers help to publish lighting standards and replace light fixtures; the research pays special attention to the blue-rich sources, which impact the important application of high altitude sites. An official leading group towards development and protection of astronomical resources has been established by Ali government; one of its tasks is to issue regulations against light pollution, including special restrictions of airport, mine, and winter heating, and to supervise lighting inspection and rectification. A site protection office under the official group and local astronomical society are organized by Ali observatory; the office can coordinate in government levels and promote related activities. A specific website operated by the protection office releases activity propaganda, evaluation results, and technical comparison with other observatories. Both the site protection office and Ali observatory take responsibility for public education, including popular science lectures, light pollution and energy conservation education. Ali Night Sky Park has been constructed and opens in 2014, and provides a popular place and observational experience. The establishment of Ali Observatory and Night Sky Park brings unexpected social influence, and the starry sky trip to Ali becomes a new format of culture\n\nMPC and ALI: their basis and their comparison\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nKennedy, W.E. Jr.; Watson, E.C.\n\nRadiation protection regulations in the United States have evolved from the recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) and the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP). In 1959, the ICRP issued Publication 2 which contained specific recommendations on dose rate limits, permissible body burdens, metabolic data for radionuclides, and maximum permissible concentrations (MPC) in air or water. Over the next 20 years, new information became available concerning the effects of radiation, the uptake and retention of radionuclides, and the radioactive decay schemes of parent radionuclides. To include this newer information, the ICRP issued Publication 30 inmoreÂ Â» 1978 to supersede Publication 2. One of the secondary limits defined in Publication 30 is the annual limit of intake (ALI). Radionuclide specific ALI values are intended to replace MPC values in determining whether or not ambient air and water concentrations are sufficiently low to maintain the dose to workers within accepted dose rate limits. In this paper, we discuss the derivation of MPC and ALI values, compare inhalation committed dose equivalent factors derived from ICRP Publications 2 and 30, and discuss the practical implications of using either MPC or ALI in determining compliance with occupational exposure limits. 6 references.Â«Â less\n\nOptimization of exposure index values for the antero-posterior pelvis and antero-posterior knee examination\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nButler, M. L.; Rainford, L.; Last, J.; Brennan, P. C.\n\n2009-02-01\n\nIntroduction The American Association of Medical Physicists is currently standardizing the exposure index (EI) value. Recent studies have questioned whether the EI value offered by manufacturers is optimal. This current work establishes optimum EIs for the antero-posterior (AP) projections of a pelvis and knee on a Carestream Health (Kodak) CR system and compares these with manufacturers recommended EI values from a patient dose and image quality perspective. Methodology Human cadavers were used to produce images of clinically relevant standards. Several exposures were taken to achieve various EI values and corresponding entrance surface doses (ESD) were measured using thermoluminescent dosimeters. Image quality was assessed by 5 experienced clinicians using anatomical criteria judged against a reference image. Visualization of image specific common abnormalities was also analyzed to establish diagnostic efficacy. Results A rise in ESD for both examinations, consistent with increasing EI was shown. Anatomic image quality was deemed to be acceptable at an EI of 1560 for the AP pelvis and 1590 for the AP knee. From manufacturers recommended values, a significant reduction in ESD (p=0.02) of 38% and 33% for the pelvis and knee respectively was noted. Initial pathological analysis suggests that diagnostic efficacy at lower EI values may be projection-specific. Conclusion The data in this study emphasize the need for clinical centres to consider establishing their own EI guidelines, and not necessarily relying on manufacturers recommendations. Normal and abnormal images must be used in this process.\n\nHigh-frequency oscillatory ventilation in ALI/ARDS.\n\nPubMed\n\nAli, Sammy; Ferguson, Niall D\n\n2011-07-01\n\nIn the last 2 decades, our goals for mechanical ventilatory support in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or acute lung injury (ALI) have changed dramatically. Several randomized controlled trials have built on a substantial body of preclinical work to demonstrate that the way in which we employ mechanical ventilation has an impact on important patient outcomes. Avoiding ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) is now a major focus when clinicians are considering which ventilatory strategy to employ in patients with ALI/ARDS. Physicians are searching for methods that may further limit VILI, while still achieving adequate gas exchange. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Firstly, the feeding input signal is modulated by lateral inhibition network to suppress background. Then, the linking input is modulated by ALI, and linking weight matrix is generated adaptively by calculating ALI coefficient of each pixel. Finally, the binary image is generated through the nonlinear modulation and the pulse generator in PCNN. The experimental results show that the segmentation effect as well as the values of contrast across region and uniformity across region of the proposed method are better than the OTSU method, maximum entropy method, the methods based on conventional PCNN and visual attention, and the proposed method has excellent performance in extracting IR dim small target from complex background.\n\nMuhammad Ali's Fighting Words: The Paradox of Violence in Nonviolent Rhetoric\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nGorsevski, Ellen W.; Butterworth, Michael L.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nWhile Muhammad Ali has been the subject of countless articles and books written by sports historians and journalists, rhetorical scholars have largely ignored him.

Methods: The blood distribution of 509 apparent healthy volunteers of Tueti County and Gal County, Tibet, which were randomly selected from September to November in 2016; 137 Tibetan blood donors, from 2016 September to2017 July and 84 Tibetan blood donors from 2015 August to 2017 July was analyzed retrospectively. The blood type was tested by the slide method. By reviewing the Chinese and foreign language database, seven articles on Tibetan blood group distribution were obtained. And the data of the blood distribution of the Ali area population and the Tibet Tibetan population were compared. Results: The ABO phenotype frequencies of 507 apparent healthy people, 137 blood donors and 84 recipients were B>O>A>AB. The composition ratio were 36.1%, 34.5%, 21.5 %, 7.9%; 40.1%, 35.0%, 17.5%, 7.3%; 39.3%, 34.5%, 20.2%, 6.0%.There was no statistically significant difference in blood group distribution between the donors and the recipients ( P >0.05). And there was no significant difference in the blood group distribution between Ali and Shigatse, Nagqu, Lhasa, Shannan. However, the differences between Ali and Qamdo, Nyingchi areas were statistically significant. Conclusion: The geographical position of the blood from the west to east, B type shows a downward trend, O type blood composition ratio shows an upward trend.\n\nGround-based multi-station spectroscopic imaging with ALIS. - Scientific highlights, project status and future prospects\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBrÃ¤ndstrÃ¶m; Gustavsson, BjÃ¶rn; Pellinen-Wannberg, Asta; Sandahl, Ingrid; Sergienko, Tima; Steen, Ake\n\n2005-08-01\n\nThe Auroral Large Imaging System (ALIS) was first proposed at the ESA-PAC meeting in Lahnstein 1989. The first spectroscopic imaging station was operational in 1994, and since then up to six stations have been in simultaneous operation. Each station has a scientific-grade CCD-detector and a filter-wheel for narrow-band interference-filters with six positions. The field-of-view is around 70Â°. Each imager is mounted in a positioning system, enabling imaging of a common volume from several sites. This enables triangulation and tomography. Raw data from ALIS is freely available at (\"http://alis.irf.se\") and ALIS is open for scientific colaboration. ALIS made the first unambiguous observations of Radio-induced optical emissions at high latitudes, and the detection of water in a Leonid meteor-trail. Both rockets and satellite coordination are considered for future observations with ALIS.\n\n[Advance on human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells for treatment of ALI in severe burns].\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Yu; Hu, Xiaohong\n\n2017-01-01\n\nSevere burn is often accompanied by multiple organ damage. Acute lung injury (ALI) is one of the most common complications, and often occurs in the early stage of severe burns. If it is not treated in time, it will progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which will be a serious threat to the lives of patients. At present, the treatment of ALI in patients with severe burn is still remained in some common ways, such as the liquid resuscitation, the primary wound treatment, ventilation support, and anti-infection. In recently, human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) have been found having some good effects on ALI caused by various causes, but few reports on the efficacy of ALI caused by severe burns were reported. By reviewing the mechanism of stem cell therapy for ALI, therapeutic potential of hUCMSCs in the treatment of severe burns with ALI and a new approach for clinical treatment was provided.\n\nTransmasseteric antero-parotid approach for open reduction and internal fixation of condylar fractures.\n\nPubMed\n\nWilson, A W; Ethunandan, M; Brennan, P A\n\n2005-02-01\n\nThe morbidity that results from surgical approaches to the condylar neck, and the time-consuming nature of the operation inhibits many surgeons from using open reduction and internal fixation for the treatment of condylar fractures. The many approaches that have been described stand testimony to the disadvantages of the individual techniques. The most common problems are limited access and injury to the facial nerve. We describe the transmasseteric antero-parotid (TMAP) technique, which offers swift access to the condylar neck while substantially reducing the risk to the facial nerve and eliminating the complications associated with transparotid approaches.\n\nNeutrophil extracellular traps contribute to the pathogenesis of acid-aspiration-induced ALI/ARDS.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Haitao; Zhou, Xiaoting; Tan, Hongyi; Hu, Yongbin; Zhang, Lemeng; Liu, Shuai; Dai, Minhui; Li, Yi; Li, Qian; Mao, Zhi; Pan, Pinhua; Su, Xiaoli; Hu, Chengpin\n\n2018-01-05\n\nAcute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) is a manifestation of systemic inflammation in the lungs, but the factors that trigger inflammation in ALI/ARDS are unclear. We hypothesized that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) contribute to the pathogenesis of acid aspiration-induced ALI/ARDS. Analysis of bronchial aspirates from ARDS patients showed that NETs were significantly correlated with the degree of ARDS (r = -0.5846, p = 0.0359). NETs in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of acid-aspiration mice were significantly higher (141.6 Â± 23.08) at 3 h after injury than those in the sham group (1234 Â± 101.9; p = 0.003, n = 5 per group). Exogenous NETs aggravated lung injury, while alvelestat and DNase markedly attenuated the intensity of ARDS. We investigated whether NETs are involved in the severity of gastric aspiration-induced ARDS. Then, a hydrochloric acid aspiration-induced ALI murine model was used to assess whether NETs are pathogenic and whether targeting NETs is protective. Exogenous NETs were administered to mice. Alvelestat can inhibit neutrophil elastase (NE), which serves an important role in NET formation, so we investigated whether alvelestat could protect against ALI in cell and mouse models. NETs may contribute to ALI/ARDS by promoting tissue damage and systemic inflammation. Targeting NETs by alvelestat may be a potential therapeutic strategy.\n\nCross calibration of the Landsat-7 ETM+ and EO-1 ALI sensor\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nChander, G.; Meyer, D.J.; Helder, D.L.\n\n2004-01-01\n\nAs part of the Earth Observer 1 (EO-1) Mission, the Advanced Land Imager (ALI) demonstrates a potential technological direction for Landsat Data Continuity Missions. To evaluate ALI's capabilities in this role, a cross-calibration methodology has been developed using image pairs from the Landsat-7 (L7) Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and EO-1 (ALI) to verify the radiometric calibration of ALI with respect to the well-calibrated L7 ETM+ sensor. Results have been obtained using two different approaches. The first approach involves calibration of nearly simultaneous surface observations based on image statistics from areas observed simultaneously by the two sensors. The second approach uses vicarious calibration techniques to compare the predicted top-of-atmosphere radiance derived from ground reference data collected during the overpass to the measured radiance obtained from the sensor. The results indicate that the relative sensor chip assemblies gains agree with the ETM+ visible and near-infrared bands to within 2% and the shortwave infrared bands to within 4%.\n\n76 FR 62494 - Designation of Ibrahim `Awwad Ibrahim `Ali al-Badri, Also Known as Dr. Ibrahim `Awwad Ibrahim...\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2011-10-07\n\n...

The result of phonon band structure shows B2-phase AlY exhibits dynamical stability. Then, the elastic properties of AlY under high pressure have been discussed. The elastic constants of AlY increase monotonically with the increase of the pressure and all the elastic constants meet the mechanical stability standard under high pressure. By analyzing the Poissonâs ratio Î½ and the value of B/G of AlY, we first predicted that AlY undergoes transformation from brittleness to ductility at 30 GPa and high pressure can improve the ductility. To obtain the thermodynamic properties of B2-phase AlY, the quasi-harmonic Debye model has been employed. Debye temperature ÎD, thermal expansion coefficient Î±, heat capacity Cp and GrÃ¼neisen parameter Î³ of B2-phase AlY are systematically explored at pressure of 0-75 GPa and temperature of 0-700 K.\n\nDifferential expression of THOC1 and ALY mRNP biogenesis/export factors in human cancers.\n\nPubMed\n\nDomÃ­nguez-SÃ¡nchez, MarÃ­a S; SÃ¡ez, Carmen; JapÃ³n, Miguel A; Aguilera, AndrÃ©s; Luna, Rosa\n\n2011-02-17\n\nOne key step in gene expression is the biogenesis of mRNA ribonucleoparticle complexes (mRNPs). Formation of the mRNP requires the participation of a number of conserved factors such as the THO complex. THO interacts physically and functionally with the Sub2/UAP56 RNA-dependent ATPase, and the Yra1/REF1/ALY RNA-binding protein linking transcription, mRNA export and genome integrity. Given the link between genome instability and cancer, we have performed a comparative analysis of the expression patterns of THOC1, a THO complex subunit, and ALY in tumor samples. The mRNA levels were measured by quantitative real-time PCR and hybridization of a tumor tissue cDNA array; and the protein levels and distribution by immunostaining of a custom tissue array containing a set of paraffin-embedded samples of different tumor and normal tissues followed by statistical analysis. We show that the expression of two mRNP factors, THOC1 and ALY are altered in several tumor tissues. THOC1 mRNA and protein levels are up-regulated in ovarian and lung tumors and down-regulated in those of testis and skin, whereas ALY is altered in a wide variety of tumors. In contrast to THOC1, ALY protein is highly detected in normal proliferative cells, but poorly in high-grade cancers. These results suggest a differential connection between tumorogenesis and the expression levels of human THO and ALY. This study opens the possibility of defining mRNP biogenesis factors as putative players in cell proliferation that could contribute to tumor development.\n\nDifferential expression of THOC1 and ALY mRNP biogenesis/export factors in human cancers\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBackground One key step in gene expression is the biogenesis of mRNA ribonucleoparticle complexes (mRNPs).

In this study, the liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry method for the simultaneous quantitation of six major quassinoids of Tongkat Ali (eurycomanone, 13,21-dihydroeurycomanone, 13Î±(21)-epoxyeurycomanone, 14,15Î²-dihydroxyklaineanone, eurycomalactone, and longilactone) was developed and validated. Using the developed method, the content of the six quassinoids was measured in Tongkat Ali containing dietary supplement tablets or capsules, and the resulting data were used to confirm the presence of Tongkat Ali in those products. Among the six quassinoids, eurycomanone was the most abundant quassinoid in all samples tested. The developed method would be useful for the quality assessment of Tongkat Ali containing dietary supplements. Â© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Spectral information extraction from ASTER, ALI, and Hyperion data has great ability to assist geologists in all disciplines to map the distribution and detect the rock units exposed at the earth's surface. The near coincidence of Earth Observing System (EOS)/Terra and Earth Observing One (EO-1) platforms allows acquiring ASTER, ALI, and Hyperion imagery of the same ground areas, resulting accurate information for geological mapping applications especially in the reconnaissance stages of hydrothermal copper and gold exploration, chromite, magnetite, massive sulfide and uranium ore deposits, mineral components of soils and structural interpretation at both regional and district scales. Shortwave length infrared and thermal infrared bands of ASTER have sufficient spectral resolution to map fundamental absorptions of hydroxyl mineral groups and silica and carbonate minerals for regional mapping purposes. Ferric-iron bearing minerals can be discriminated using six unique wavelength bands of ALI spanning the visible and near infrared. Hyperion visible and near infrared bands (0.4 to 1.0 Î¼m) and shortwave infrared bands (0.9 to 2.5 Î¼m) allowed to produce image maps of iron oxide minerals, hydroxyl-bearing minerals, sulfates and carbonates in association with hydrothermal alteration assemblages, respectively. The techniques and achievements reviewed in the present paper can further introduce the efficacy of ASTER, ALI, and Hyperion data for future mineral and lithological mapping and exploration of the porphyry copper, epithermal gold, chromite, magnetite, massive sulfide and uranium ore deposits especially in arid and semi-arid territory.\n\nNonempirical electron-correlation calculations on ALi/sub k/ and Ali/sub k+1//sup +/ clusters formed with elements from the second and third periods\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMebel', A.M.; Klimenko, N.M.; Charkin, O.P.\n\nSeveral basic sets have been used (from 3-21 G/sub A//asterisk/ to DZHD + P/sub A/) with electron correlation in the Meller-Plesset MP3 approximation in nonempirical calculations on ALi/sub k+1//sup +/ and ALi/sub K+1//sup +/ lithium clusters (CLi/sub 2/, CLi/sub 3//sup +/, NLi/sub 3/, NLi/sub 4//sup +/, OLi/sub 2/, OLi/sub 3//sup +/, etc.) formed with elements from the second and third periods in the lowest singlet states.

We retrospectively investigated the usefulness of the ALI to predict chemotherapy response and survival in 212 patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) treated with R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone) chemotherapy. Patients were allocated to a low ALI group (n = 82, 38.7%) or a high ALI group (n = 130, 61.3%) according to an optimal pretreatment ALI cut-off value of 15.5 as determined by receiver operating curve analysis. The low ALI group displayed more adverse clinical characteristics, lower rates of complete remission (54.9 vs. 75.4%, p = 0.008), and poorer 5-year progression-free (PFS, 58.1 vs. 77.3%, p = 0.006) and overall (OS, 64.2 vs. 80.2%, p = 0.008) survival. Multivariate analysis showed that low ALI was found to independently predict shorter PFS and OS. Interestingly, a low ALI reverted to a high ALI during treatment in 58 patients (27.4%), and the 5-year OS of these patients was better than that of patients whose ALI remained low (n = 24, 72.5 vs. 24%, p < 0.001). ALI might be an easily available marker for predicting clinical outcomes in DLBCL patients treated with R-CHOP chemotherapy. Â© 2017 S.

This ex vivo oviduct epithelium is capable of supporting embryo development in co-culture up to the blastocyst stage without addition of embryo culture medium. However, blastocyst rates in co-culture were markedly lower than in conventional in vitro embryo production procedures. In the present study, we assessed target gene expression of ALI-BOEC derived embryos to test their similarity to embryos from conventional in vitro embryo culture. We screened previously published data from developing bovine embryos and selected 41 genes which are either differentially expressed during embryo development, or reflect differences between various in vitro culture conditions or in vitro and in vivo embryos. Target gene expression was measured in 8-cell embryos and blastocysts using a 48.48 Dynamic Arrayâ¢ on a Biomark HD instrument. For comparison with the ALI-BOEC system, we generated embryos by two different standard IVP protocols. The culture conditions lead to differential gene expression in both 8-cell embryos and blastocysts. Across the expression of all target genes the embryos developing on ALI-BOEC did not depart from conventional IVP embryos. These first results prove that gene expression in ALI-BOEC embryos is not largely aberrant. However, there was no clear indication for a more in vivo-like target gene expression of these embryos. This calls for further optimization of the ALI-BOEC system to increase its efficiency both quantitatively and qualitatively.\n\nThalamic atrophy in antero-medial and dorsal nuclei correlates with six-month outcome after severe brain injuryâ\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLutkenhoff, Evan S.; McArthur, David L.; Hua, Xue; Thompson, Paul M.; Vespa, Paul M.; Monti, Martin M.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe primary and secondary damage to neural tissue inflicted by traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of death and disability. The secondary processes, in particular, are of great clinical interest because of their potential susceptibility to intervention. We address the dynamics of tissue degeneration in cortico-subcortical circuits after severe brain injury by assessing volume change in individual thalamic nuclei over the first six-months post-injury in a sample of 25 moderate to severe traumatic brain injury patients. Using tensor-based morphometry, we observed significant localized thalamic atrophy over the six-month period in antero-dorsal limbic nuclei as well as in medio-dorsal association nuclei. Importantly, the degree of atrophy in these nuclei was predictive, even after controlling for full-brain volume change, of behavioral outcome at six-months post-injury. Furthermore, employing a data-driven decision tree model, we found that physiological measures, namely the extent of atrophy in the anterior thalamic nucleus, were the most predictive variables of whether patients had regained consciousness by six-months, followed by behavioral measures. Overall, these findings suggest that the secondary non-mechanical degenerative processes triggered by severe brain injury are still ongoing after the first week post-trauma and target specifically antero-medial and dorsal thalamic nuclei. This result therefore offers a potential window of intervention, and a specific target region, in agreement with the view that specific cortico-thalamo-cortical circuits are crucial to the maintenance of large-scale network neural activity and thereby the restoration of cognitive function after severe brain injury.

To move forward, one must generate and control propulsive forces. To achieve this, it is necessary to create and tune a distance between the centre of mass (CoM) and the centre of pressure (CoP) along the antero-posterior axis. We hypothesize that learning to walk consists of learning how to calibrate these self-generated propulsive forces to control such distance. We investigated this question with six infants (three girls and three boys) who we followed up weekly for the first 8 weeks after the onset of walking and then biweekly until they reached 14-16 weeks of walking experience. The infants' walking patterns (kinematics and propelling forces) were captured via synched motion analysis and force plate. The results show that the distance between the CoM and the CoP along the antero-posterior axis increased rapidly during the first months of learning to walk and that this increase was correlated with an increase in velocity. The initial small values of (CoM-CoP) observed at walking onset, coupled with small velocity are interpreted as the solution infants adopted to satisfy a compromise between the need to generate propulsive forces to move forward while simultaneously controlling the disequilibrium resulting from creating a with distance between the CoM and CoP.\n\nDoes advanced lung inflammation index (ALI) have prognostic significance in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer?\n\nPubMed\n\nOzyurek, Berna Akinci; Ozdemirel, Tugce Sahin; Ozden, Sertac Buyukyaylaci; ErdoÄan, Yurdanur; Ozmen, Ozlem; Kaplan, Bekir; Kaplan, Tugba\n\n2018-01-22\n\nLung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed and death-related cancer type and is more frequent in males. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for about 85% of all case. In this study, it was aimed to research the relationship between advanced lung inflammation index (ALI) and the primary mass maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and C-reactive protein (CRP) at initial diagnosis and the prognostic value of ALI in determining the survival in metastatic NSCLC. A total of 112 patients diagnosed as stage 4 non-small-lung cancer in our hospital between January 2006 and December 2013 were included in this study. ALI was calculated as body mass index (BMI)Â ÃÂ serum albumin/neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). The patients were divided into two groups as ALIÂ <Â 18 (high inflammation) and ALIÂ â¥Â 18 (low inflammation). The log-rank test and Cox proportional hazard model were used to identify predictors of mortality. Evaluation was made of 94 male and 18 female patients with a mean age of 59.7Â Â±Â 9.9Â years. A statistically significant negative relationship was determined between ALI and CRP values (PÂ <Â .001), but no relationship was found between ALI and SUVmax values (PÂ =Â .436). The median survival time in patients with ALIÂ <Â 18 was 12Â months and, in those with ALIÂ â¥Â 18, it was 16Â months (PÂ =Â .095). ALI is an easily calculated indicator of inflammation in lung cancer patients. Values <18 can be considered to predict a poor prognosis.

Following calibration, the ALI and ASTER datasets were co-registered and joined to produce a 13-channel reflectance cube spanning the Visible to Short Wave Infrared (0.4-2.4 ??m). Eigen analysis and comparison of the Hyperion data with the ALI + ASTER reflectance data, as well as mapping results using various ALI+ASTER data subsets, provided insights into the information dimensionality of all the data. In particular, high spectral resolution, low signal-to-noise Hyperion data were only marginally better for mineral mapping than the merged 13-channel, low spectral resolution, high signal-to-noise ALI + ASTER dataset. Neither the Hyperion nor the combined ALI + ASTER datasets had sufficient information dimensionality for mapping the diverse range of surface materials exposed on the Altiplano. However, it is possible to optimize the use of the multispectral data for mineral-mapping purposes by careful data subsetting, and by employing other appropriate image-processing strategies.\n\nJAliEn - A new interface between the AliEn jobs and the central services\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGrigoras, A. G.; Grigoras, C.; Pedreira, M. M.; Saiz, P.; Schreiner, S.\n\n2014-06-01\n\nSince the ALICE experiment began data taking in early 2010, the amount of end user jobs on the AliEn Grid has increased significantly. Presently 1/3 of the 40K CPU cores available to ALICE are occupied by jobs submitted by about 400 distinct users, individually or in organized analysis trains. The overall stability of the AliEn middleware has been excellent throughout the 3 years of running, but the massive amount of end-user analysis and its specific requirements and load has revealed few components which can be improved. One of them is the interface between users and central AliEn services (catalogue, job submission system) which we are currently re-implementing in Java. The interface provides persistent connection with enhanced data and job submission authenticity. In this paper we will describe the architecture of the new interface, the ROOT binding which enables the use of a single interface in addition to the standard UNIX-like access shell and the new security-related features.\n\nSecuring the AliEn File Catalogue - Enforcing authorization with accountable file operations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSchreiner, Steffen; Bagnasco, Stefano; Sankar Banerjee, Subho; Betev, Latchezar; Carminati, Federico; Vladimirovna Datskova, Olga; Furano, Fabrizio; Grigoras, Alina; Grigoras, Costin; Mendez Lorenzo, Patricia; Peters, Andreas Joachim; Saiz, Pablo; Zhu, Jianlin\n\n2011-12-01\n\nThe AliEn Grid Services, as operated by the ALICE Collaboration in its global physics analysis grid framework, is based on a central File Catalogue together with a distributed set of storage systems and the possibility to register links to external data resources. This paper describes several identified vulnerabilities in the AliEn File Catalogue access protocol regarding fraud and unauthorized file alteration and presents a more secure and revised design: a new mechanism, called LFN Booking Table, is introduced in order to keep track of access authorization in the transient state of files entering or leaving the File Catalogue. Due to a simplification of the original Access Envelope mechanism for xrootd-protocol-based storage systems, fundamental computational improvements of the mechanism were achieved as well as an up to 50% reduction of the credential's size. By extending the access protocol with signed status messages from the underlying storage system, the File Catalogue receives trusted information about a file's size and checksum and the protocol is no longer dependent on client trust. Altogether, the revised design complies with atomic and consistent transactions and allows for accountable, authentic, and traceable file operations. This paper describes these changes as part and beyond the development of AliEn version 2.19.\n\nSidi Ali Ou Azza (L4): A New Moroccan Fall\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChennaoui Aoudjehane, H.; Agee, C.

A.; Feofilov, A. G.; Manuilova, R. O.; Yankovsky, V. A.; Rezac, L.; Pesnell, W. D.; Goldberg, R. A.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThe Accelerated Lambda Iteration (ALI) technique was developed in stellar astrophysics at the beginning of 1990s for solving the non-LTE radiative transfer problem in atomic lines and multiplets in stellar atmospheres. It was later successfully applied to modeling the non-LTE emissions and radiative cooling/heating in the vibrational-rotational bands of molecules in planetary atmospheres. Similar to the standard lambda iterations ALI operates with the matrices of minimal dimension. However, it provides higher convergence rate and stability due to removing from the iterating process the photons trapped in the optically thick line cores. In the current ALI-ARMS (ALI for Atmospheric Radiation and Molecular Spectra) code version additional acceleration of calculations is provided by utilizing the opacity distribution function (ODF) approach and \"decoupling\". The former allows replacing the band branches by single lines of special shape, whereas the latter treats non-linearity caused by strong near-resonant vibration-vibrational level coupling without additional linearizing the statistical equilibrium equations. Latest code application for the non-LTE diagnostics of the molecular band emissions of Earth's and Martian atmospheres as well as for the non-LTE IR cooling/heating calculations are discussed.\n\nLand cover mapping with emphasis to burnt area delineation using co-orbital ALI and Landsat TM imagery\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPetropoulos, George P.; Kontoes, Charalambos C.; Keramitsoglou, Iphigenia\n\n2012-08-01\n\nIn this study, the potential of EO-1 Advanced Land Imager (ALI) radiometer for land cover and especially burnt area mapping from a single image analysis is investigated. Co-orbital imagery from the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) was also utilised for comparison purposes. Both images were acquired shortly after the suppression of a fire occurred during the summer of 2009 North-East of Athens, the capital of Greece. The Maximum Likelihood (ML), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) classifiers were parameterised and subsequently applied to the acquired satellite datasets. Evaluation of the land use/cover mapping accuracy was based on the error matrix statistics. Also, the McNemar test was used to evaluate the statistical significance of the differences between the approaches tested. Derived burnt area estimates were validated against the operationally deployed Services and Applications For Emergency Response (SAFER) Burnt Scar Mapping service. All classifiers applied to either ALI or TM imagery proved flexible enough to map land cover and also to extract the burnt area from other land surface types. The highest total classification accuracy and burnt area detection capability was returned from the application of SVMs to ALI data. This was due to the SVMs ability to identify an optimal separating hyperplane for best classes' separation that was able to better utilise ALI's advanced technological characteristics in comparison to those of TM sensor. This study is to our knowledge the first of its kind, effectively demonstrating the benefits of the combined application of SVMs to ALI data further implying that ALI technology may prove highly valuable in mapping burnt areas and land use/cover if it is incorporated into the development of Landsat 8 mission, planned to be launched in the coming years.\n\nBmAly Is an Important Factor in Meiotic Progression and Spermatid Differentiation in Bombyx mori (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZhang, Pengjie; Zhong, Jinfeng; Cao, Guangli; Xue, Renyu; Gong, Chengliang\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAbstract The Drosophila melanogaster â always earlyâ gene ( Dmaly ), which is required for G2/M cell-cycle control and spermatid differentiation, is one of the meiotic arrest genes. To study the Bombyx mori aly gene ( Bmaly ), the cDNA of Bmaly was cloned and sequenced, and the results showed that the open reading frame of Bmaly is 1,713âbp in length, encoding 570 amino acid residues, in which a domain in an Rb-related pathway was found. Phylogenetic analysis based on the amino acid sequence of conserved regions showed that Aly from different insects gathered together, except for DmAly and Culex quinquefasciatus Aly, which were not clustered to a subgroup according to insect order. The Bmaly gene was inserted into expression vector pGS-21a(+) and then the recombinant protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and used to immunize mice to prepare the antibody against BmAly. Immunofluorescence examination showed that BmAly was distributed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of BmN cell. The Bmaly gene expression could not be detected in the silk gland, malpighian tubule, fat body, or midgut of the silkworm. Expression levels of the Bmaly gene were detected in the gonadal tissues, where the levels in the testes were 10 times higher than that in the ovaries. Moreover, Bmaly expression was detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction at different stages of B . mori testis development, at which fifth instar was relatively grossly expressed. The result suggested Bmaly was abundantly expressed in primary spermatocytes and prespermatids. To further explore the function of Bmaly , Bmaly siRNA was injected into third and fourth instar silkworm larvae, which markedly inhibited the development of sperm cells. These results together suggest that Bmaly is a meiotic arrest gene that plays an important role in spermatogenesis.

Particularly, biomarkers essential for its early diagnosis and prognosis are lacking. Methods Recent studies suggest that alveolar macrophages (AMs) at the exudative phase of ALI/ARDS initiate, amplify and perpetuate inflammatory responses, while they resolve inflammation in the recovery phase to prevent further tissue injury and perpetuated inflammation in the lung. Therefore, proteins relevant to this functional switch could be valuable biomarkers for ALI/ARDS diagnosis and prognosis. We thus conducted comparative analysis of the AM proteome to assess its dynamic proteomic changes during ALI/ARDS progression and recovery. Results 135 proteins were characterized to be differentially expressed between AMs at the exudative and recovery phase. MALDI-TOF-MS and peptide mass fingerprint (PMF) analysis characterized 27 informative proteins, in which 17 proteins were found with a marked increase at the recovery phase, while the rest of 10 proteins were manifested by the significantly higher levels of expression at the exudative phase. Conclusions Given the role of above identified proteins played in the regulation of inflammatory responses, cell skeleton organization, oxidative stress, apoptosis and metabolism, they have the potential to serve as biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognosis in the setting of patients with ALI/ARDS.

The primary goals of this study are to determine the interrater reliability (IRR) of the ALiEM AIR rating score and determine its correlation with expert educator gestalt. We also determine the minimum number of educator-raters needed to achieve acceptable reliability. Eight educators each rated 83 online educational posts with the ALiEM AIR scale. Items include accuracy, usage of evidence-based medicine, referencing, utility, and the Best Evidence in Emergency Medicine rating score. A generalizability study was conducted to determine IRR and rating variance contributions of facets such as rater, blogs, posts, and topic. A randomized selection of 40 blog posts previously rated through ALiEM AIR was then rated again by a blinded group of expert medical educators according to their gestalt. Their gestalt impression was subsequently correlated with the ALiEM AIR score. The IRR for the ALiEM AIR rating scale was 0.81 during the 6-month pilot period. Decision studies showed that at least 9 raters were required to achieve this reliability. Spearman correlations between mean AIR score and the mean expert gestalt ratings were 0.40 for recommendation for learners and 0.35 for their colleagues. The ALiEM AIR scale is a moderately to highly reliable, 5-question tool when used by medical educators for rating online resources. The score displays a fair correlation with expert educator gestalt in regard to the quality of the resources. The score displays a fair correlation with educator gestalt.

In this paper, these data are used to evaluate five sites for millimeter-wave (mm-wave) observations. These include two established sites (South Pole and Chajnantor, Atacama), and three new sites (Ali in Tibet, Dome A in Antarctica, and Summit Camp in Greenland). Atmospheric properties including precipitable water vapor (PWV), sky brightness temperature fluctuations, and ice and liquid water paths are derived and compared.

The lower site in Ali (5250 m) planned for the first stage of observations at 90/150 GHz provides conditions comparable to those on the Chajnantor Plateau. These analyses confirm Ali to be an excellent mm-wave site in the Northern Hemisphere that will complement well-established Southern sites.

Although studies have found abnormal FC in regions of the default mode network (DMN), no study has investigated the FC of specific regions within the anterior DMN based on cytoarchitectonic subdivisions of the antero-medial pre-frontal cortex (PFC). Studies from different areas in the field have shown regions within the anterior DMN to be involved in emotional intelligence. Although abnormalities in this region have been observed in depression, the relationship between the ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) function and emotional intelligence has yet to be investigated in depressed individuals. Twenty-one medication-free, non-treatment resistant, depressed patients and 21 healthy controls underwent a resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging session. The participants also completed an ability-based measure of emotional intelligence: the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test. FC maps of Brodmann areas (BA) 25, 10 m, 10r, and 10p were created and compared between the two groups. Mixed-effects analyses showed that the more anterior seeds encompassed larger areas of the DMN. Compared to healthy controls, depressed patients had significantly lower connectivity between BA10p and the right insula and between BA25 and the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex. Exploratory analyses showed an association between vmPFC connectivity and emotional intelligence. These results suggest that individuals with depression have reduced FC between antero-medial PFC regions and regions involved in emotional regulation compared to control subjects. Moreover, vmPFC functional connectivity appears linked to emotional intelligence. Â© The Author 2015.

A year before the issue of this revised 10 CFR Part 20, the ICRP dispatched Publication 61 (1990). This new ICRP report employed different dose limits, in addition to incorporating more recent biological information and variations in physiological and different tissue weighing factors for various organs. An investigation of the numerical differences in the Annual Limit on Intake (ALI) reported in this moremoreÂ Â» recent international regulations and those of the new regulations was thus undertaken. Overall means, medians, modes, maximum, minimum, and ranges of the percent changes are almost identical for ingestion and inhalation, although the percent difference between 10 CFR and ICRP Publication 61 showed minor differences for individual radionuclides. Approximately 334 of 1,351 radionuclides for inhalation and 173 of 771 radionuclides for ingestion have much less restrictive ALIs in the new ICRP recommendations than in the old, with some of those limits increased by at least a factor of two. Approximately 51% of the radionuclides for ingestion intake and 48% of radionuclides for inhalation intake showed changes of greater than 25%. The radionuclides observed to have much less restrictive ALIs are primarily the radionuclides of thorium, mercury, plutonium, uranium, and americium which have short effective clearance rates. While many countries have already applied the ICRP 61 recommendations to their radiation protection standards, using the ICRP 30 recommendation in the United States does not match the international standards even when the values of the ALIs are adjusted for differences in dose limits.Â«Â less\n\nAdult Literacy Information and Evaluation System (ALIES): Background, Status and Future Directions.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nCook, Jacqueline; And Others\n\nThis document describes the Adult Literacy Information and Evaluation System (ALIES), which is the management information system for New York City's citywide adult education program expansion effort begun in 1984.

Here we demonstrate that closely related proteins Aly2/Art3 and Aly1/Art6, which are poorly characterized members of the arrestin-like protein family, mediate endocytosis of the aspartic acid/glutamic acid transporter Dip5. In aly2Î cells, Dip5 is stabilized at the plasma membrane and is not endocytosed efficiently. Efficient ubiquitination of Dip5 is dependent on Aly2. aly1Î cells also show deficiency in Dip5 endocytosis, although less remarkably than aly2Î cells. Aly2 physically interacts in vivo with Rsp5 at its PY motif and also with Dip5, thus serving as an adaptor linking Rsp5 with Dip5 to achieve Dip5 ubiquitination. Importantly, the interaction between Aly2 and Dip5 is accelerated in response to elevated aspartic acid availability. This result indicates that the regulation of Dip5 endocytosis is accomplished by dynamic recruitment of Rsp5 via Aly2.

We dynamically analyzed the brittle deformation of this specific structural high using four different methods in order to better constrain the tectonic evolution of this key-area in the Afar depression. Paleostress inversions appear highly consistent using the four methods, which a posteriori validates this approach. Computed paleostress fields document two major signals: an early E-W extensional field, and a later transcurrent field, kinematically consistent with the previous one. The Ali Sabieh range may have evolved continuously during Oligo-Miocene times from large-scale extensional to transcurrent tectonism, as the result of probable local stress permutation between Ï1 and Ï2 stress axes.\n\nALI (Autonomous Lunar Investigator): Revolutionary Approach to Exploring the Moon with Addressable Reconfigurable Technology\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nClark, P.

The results for BeLi/sup +/, BeLi/sup 2/, BeLi/sub 4/, and MgLi/sub 2/ have been refined with consideration of the electron correlation in the framework of the theory of self-consistent electron pairs (SCEP). It has been shown that the stability of ALi/sub 2k/ increases with increasing size of the clus"
