The pagus Lommensis (Lommegau, in German) was the predecessor of the county of Namur, although it is not certain that the two were precisely co-extensive. The division of Lotharingian territories agreed 8 Aug 870 between Ludwig II \"der Deutsche\" King of the East Franks and his half-brother Charles II \"le Chauve\" King of the West Franks allocated \" comitatum Lomensem \" to King Charles . Vanderkindere suggests that the pagus Lommensis was one of the counties held by Giselbert, father of Reginar [I] Comte de Hainaut . The earliest specific mention so far identified of a count in this pagus is a charter dated 884. Thereafter, only isolated references have been found until the early 10th century. It has not yet proved possible to prove any family relationship between the earliest counts (see Chapter 1). Berengar, referred to in early 10th century sources as count in the pagus Lommensis, is first named as Comte de Namur in a charter dated 919. It is assumed that he constructed the first castle at Namur, presumably at that time a mere wooden fortification, although the primary source which confirms that this is correct has not yet been identified. Flodoard's Annals record that in 960 Comte Robert I, Berengar's successor, fortified the castle of Namur against Bruno Archbishop of Köln, son of Henrich I King of Germany , who was Robert's suzerain in his capacity as duke of Lotharingia. Robert I's descendants in the male line continued to rule the county of Namur until the late 12th century (see Chapter 2). It is assumed that they were vassals of the dukes of Lower Lotharingia, after Emperor Heinrich II confirmed the establishment of this duchy in 1012, although the primary sources which confirm this have not yet been identified.\n\nHenri de Namur, son of Godefroi Comte de Namur, succeeded his maternal cousin in 1136 as Comte de Luxembourg, the latter being united with Namur after Henri succeeded his father three years later. A succession crisis was triggered in Namur and Luxembourg after the unexpected birth in 1186 of a daughter to the septuagenarian Comte Henri, who had previously designated his brother-in-law Baudouin IV Comte de Hainaut as his successor. The matter was adjudicated by Heinrich VI King of Germany in favour of the Comte de Hainaut, and later confirmed by Emperor Friedrich I \"Barbarossa\" who created him Marquis de Namur. Under the compromise agreed in 1190, Namur was transferred immediately to Hainaut, to which the counties of La Roche and Durbuy would also revert after Comte Henri died. The arrangement did not specify the fate of Luxembourg, but Comte Henri continued to rule this county. The matter did not end there. Thibaut I Comte de Bar, who married Ermensende de Luxembourg in 1197, besieged Philippe Marquis de Namur in his castle and forced the negotiation of the Treaty of Dinant (signed 26 Jul 1199), under which Baudouin IX Count of Flanders and Hainaut (older brother of Marquis Philippe) inherited the larger part of the county of Namur, while Ermensende retained the counties of Luxembourg, Durbuy and La Roche, as well as that part of the county of Namur which lay on the right bank of the river Meuse. On the death of Marquis Philippe in 1212, Namur was inherited by his sister Yolande, the wife of Pierre [II] Seigneur de Courtenay who was later elected as Pierre I Latin Emperor of Constantinople (see Chapter 3). Four of her children succeeded successively as Marquis de Namur, until 1263 when her youngest son Baudouin, ex-Emperor of Constantinople, sold his rights to Namur to Guy de Dampierre Count of Flanders.\n\nGuy Count of Flanders appointed his son Jean as governor of the county of Namur in 1297, and transferred his rights to the county to him in 1298 (see Chapter 4). Jean and his successors used the title \"Comte de Namur\". The precise process by which the title \"Marquis\" ceased to be used has not yet been researched. As the county of Namur continued to lie within imperial jurisdiction, it is unclear why use of the title would not have continued, despite the territory being held by a younger branch of the family of the counts of Flanders who were at that time vassals of the kings of France. One possibility is that the Flemish counts did not wish the junior branch of their family to bear a title which was hierarchically superior to their own. Jean III Comte de Namur, last legitimate descendant in the male line of Comte Jean I, sold the county of Namur to Philippe \"le Bon\" Duke of Burgundy 23 Apr 1421, subject to a continuing life interest. On the death of Comte Jean in 1429, the county was incorporated into the Burgundian territories in the Low Countries which, by a twist of dynastic fate, passed to the Habsburg family as a result of the marriage in 1477 of Marie, daughter and heiress of the last Valois duke of Burgundy, to Archduke Maximilian.\n\nThe families of other nobility in the county of Namur are set out in Chapter 5.\n\nChapter 1. COMTE in PAGUS LOMMENSIS\n\n1. ROBERT, son of --- (-after [884]) . Emperor Karl III granted property \"in comitatu Laumacense in villa Merendrec\" to \"Sanctio\" vassal of \"Rotbertus comes\" by undated charter, placed in the compilation with charters dated 884 . This document represents the earliest mention so far identified of a specific count in \"comitatus Lomacensis\", although the edition indicates doubts about the authenticity of the charter. It is unclear from the text whether Count Robert was count within the territory but this is a reasonable assumption. The onomastic connection with the later counts of Namur is obvious but the precise family relationship, if any, has not been ascertained.\n\nChapter 2. COMTES de NAMUR [907]-1190\n\n1. BERENGAR, son of --- ([875/85]-before 946) . The origins of Count Berengar are unknown. His birth date is estimated on the assumption that he was adult when he is named in the charter dated 907 (see below). Comte in pagus Lommensis. \"Hludouucus rex\" confirmed the donation by \"bone memoriæ Kisala illustris femina\" of the abbey of Fosse \"in pago Lominse in comitatu Perengarii\" to the church of Liège with the consent of \" Kepeharti comitis\" by charter dated 26 Oct 907 in which among \"fidelium nostrum\" was listed \"Purchart filius Vualahonis\" . Ludwig IV \"das Kind\" King of Germany confirmed a donation of property including \" in pago ac in comitatu Lummensi cuius nunc adest comes Perengarius\" to the church of Tongern at the request of \"Kepehardus et Reginharius comites\" and with the consent of \"Albuini eo tempore illius comitis\" by charter dated 18 Jan 908 . Charles III \"le Simple\" King of the West Franks restored Kloster Süsteren to the abbey of Prüm by charter dated 19 Jan 916 which names \"fidelium nostrorum Widricus comes palatii, Richuuinus comes, Gislebertus, Matfridus, Beringerius comites, Theodericus comes, Reinherus comes, Erleboldus\" . \"Berengarii comitis Namurcensis\" subscribed a charter dated 2 Jun 919 under which Gerard de Stave donated property to the abbey of Brogne . Flodoard's Annals record that \"Berengarius\" captured \"Giselbertum\" (referring to the duke of Lotharingia) and only freed him after receiving \"filiis Ragenarii fratris ipsius Gisleberti\" as hostages, after which Giselbert ravaged the lands of \"Berengarii, Ragenariique fratris sui et Isaac comitis\" . Count of the castle of Namur. The Vita Gerardi Abbatis Broniense records that \"comes Berengarius Nammucensi castro præsidebat\" and that he took Gerard under his protection . m --- [von Maasgau], daughter of REGINAR [I] \"Langhals\" Graf `von Maasgau [Comte de Hainaut] & his wife Alberada ---. Flodoard's Annals refer to the wife of \"Berengarius\" as \"sororem [Gislebertum]\" but do not name her . According to Europäische Stammtafeln , she was heiress of \"comitatus Lomacensis\". Presumably this is suggested because both her father and her husband are recorded as counts \"in pago Lominse\", and on the assumption that her husband succeeded her father. However, this assumes that the \"pagus\" is identical with the county, and that each pagus was ruled by only one count at any one time. It is, however, clear from the development of the county structure in Germany that the counties were not geographically coincident with the pagi. References to two or three different comitati within one pagus are frequent in imperial diplomas, as are references to the comitatus of a single comes spreading into more than one pagus. It is not therefore a safe assumption, in the absence of further documentary proof, that Berengar owed his position in \"comitatus Lomacensis\" to his wife.\n\n1. ROBERT [I] ([920/25]-before 981) . Robert succeeded as Comte de Namur, maybe as direct successor to Berengar as no documentary record has been found of another intervening count in the area, although this is not certain. The earliest reference to Robert is the charter dated 2 Jun 946 under which \"Rotbertus comes\" donated the villa of Melin \"in comitatu meo\" to the abbey of Waulsort . According to Europäische Stammtafeln , Robert was the son of Berengar. However, the only evidence so far identified that Robert may have been a descendant of Berengar is provided by the Vita Gerardi Abbatis Broniense which records that \"comes Berengarius Nammucensi castro præsidebat\" commenting that \"cuius stirpis posteritas ibidem hactenus perstat\" . This convoluted reference suggests that the relationship may have been less direct than father/son: maybe Robert was Berengar's grandson, the son of Berengar's daughter. This appears to be corroborated by the chronology of the births in the family. If Giselbert, son of Robert [I], was born in [955/60], it is unlikely that his father was born before [920/25] at the earliest, bearing in mind that he was presumably an adult at the time of the 946 charter. Assuming that the birth date range of Berengar is correct as shown above, Robert would most likely have been born earlier than this if he had been Berengar's son. The fact that Robert named his second son Giselbert also suggests a family connection with Berengar, whose wife was the sister of Giselbert Duke of Lotharingia, although it is somewhat surprising that the name Berengar itself is not repeated among Robert's descendants. Another indication of Robert's family background is provided by the Gesta Abbatum Gemblacensium which names \"Rotbertus comes Namucensis\" as the most powerful of the \"cæteri fratres et nepotes pii patris nostri [Wicperti]\", while recording that he oppressed the abbey of Gembloux . If this is correct, Robert's maternal grandmother was Osburga, whose first husband was St Wicbert's father (see Chapter 5.A). \"Otto rex\" granted property \"quod Ymmo in villa Castra et in pago Darnegouue ac in comitatu Rotberti comitis\" to \"fideli nostro Tietboldo\" by charter dated 11 Jun 958 . Flodoard's Annals record that in 960 \"Rotbertus\", enemy of Bruno Archbishop of Köln (son of Henrich I King of Germany), fortified \"Namuurum castrum\" against the archbishop . \"Rotbertus comes\" subscribed a charter dated 961 under which Erluin abbé of Gembloux exchanged property . The Gesta Abbatum Lobiensium names \"comite Roberto\" and records that \"Ratherius\" died \"apud Namurcum\" , an event dated elsewhere to 974. m ---. The name of the wife of Robert is not known. Thierry Stasser suggests that she may have been [Liutgarde], daughter of Adalbert Graf [von Metz], emphasising that this is purely speculative based only on onomastics . Comte Robert [I] & his wife had [five] children:\n\na) ALBERT (-shortly before 1011) . Albert, Gislebert and Ratbod are named as sons of Comte Robert in a charter dated 981 . He succeeded as ALBERT I Comte de Namur.\n\n- see below.\n\nb) GISELBERT ([955/60]-). The Gesta Abbatum Lobiensium records that \"Gislabertus, ex quatuor comitis Roberti filiis unus\" accompanied \"Mathildem comitissam\" to the abbey of Lobbes . This event is not dated but is recorded in the Gesta several paragraphs after an event dated to 974. His birth date range is estimated on the assumption that Giselbert was a young adult when he visited Lobbes, dated some time between 975 and 980. Albert, Gislebert and Ratbod are named as sons of Comte Robert in a charter dated 981 .\n\nc) RATBOD [Robert] . Albert, Gislebert and Ratbod are named as sons of Comte Robert in a charter dated 981 .\n\nd) son (-[before 981]). As the Gesta Abbatum Lobiensium records \"Gislabertus, ex quatuor comitis Roberti filiis unus\" , it is known that Comte Robert had a fourth son but no further information relating to him has been found. He presumably died before 981 as he is not named with his brothers in the charter of that date.\n\ne) [LIUTGARDE . Vanderkindere suggests that the wife of Arnoul [II] Comte de Cambrai may have been the daughter of Robert [I] Comte de Namur, both because the couple's son was named Albert and also because Liutgarde held property at Hanret in Darnau pagus which was divided between Namur and Brabant . No other information has been identified from which any alternative ancestry can be deduced for Liutgarde. Liutgarde possessed the alleu de Hanret, Hesbaye . \"Arnulfus comes Valencencianensis et uxor eius Liutgardis cum filio suo Adalberto\" donated property to Saint-Pierre-au-Mont-Blandin at Gent by charter dated 994 . m ARNOUL [II] Comte de Cambrai, son of ARNOUL [I] Comte de Cambrai & his wife Berta --- (-23 Oct 1012).]\n\nALBERT, son of ROBERT [I] Comte de Namur & his wife --- (-shortly before 1011) . Albert, Gislebert and Ratbod are named as sons of Comte Robert in a charter dated 981 . He succeeded as ALBERT I Comte de Namur. \"Otto rex\" confirmed the privileges of Brogne abbey \"in pago Lomacensis situm\" by charter dated 992 which names \"comiti Namuci Adelberto\" . His date of death is suggested by a record, dated to 1011, of a monk from St Vaast d'Arras dreaming of hell where he recognised \"Albertum Namucensium comitatui\" being tortured, the episode being incorporated into a circular letter from Richard Bishop of Verdun to all abbeys .\n\nm (990) ERMENGARDE, daughter of CHARLES Duke of Lower Lotharingia [Carolingian] & wife Adelais de Troyes ([970/75]-after 1013). The Genealogica comitum Buloniensium records that \"Karolus dux\" was father of \"Ermengardem et Gerbergam\" . The Gesta Abbatem Trudonensium, on the other hand, names \"Hermegardam Namursi cometissam\" as only daughter of \"Ottoni duci Lotharingiæ\", son of Duke Charles . This appears chronologically difficult to sustain, assuming that Ermengarde was the mother of Albert's children as shown below. It would also mean that her daughter Liutgarde could not have been the mother of Baldric [II] Bishop of Liège (see below), already tight chronologically if Ermengarde married in 990. The Fundatio Ecclesiæ S Albani Namucensis is less specific on Ermengarde's origin when it names her son \"comes Albertus secundus, ortus ex patre Lothariensi\" and refers to his mother as \"matre vero Francigena Ermengarde, nobilissimam Francorum regum prosapiam trahente\" . The date of her marriage is suggested by the fact that Richer does not name her among the children who were imprisoned with her father in 991: \"Karolum cum uxore Adelaide et filio Ludovico, et filiabus duabus, quarum altera Gerberga, altera Adelaidis dicebatur, necnon et Arnulfo nepote\" . This presumably indicates that her marriage predated this imprisonment. It has been suggested that Ermengarde was Albert [I]'s second wife, considering the likely difference in their ages . If this is correct, it is unlikely that there were any surviving children from his earlier marriage as Albert's successor (presumably his eldest surviving son) was the son of his surviving wife, presumably Ermengarde, as shown by the Gesta Episcoporum Cameracensium which records that, after the battle of Hougaerde/Hoegaarden (dated to 1013), Lambert Comte de Louvain captured \"Herimannum comitem\" and placed him in the custody of \"Rotberdo Namurcensi comite\", before he was released after the intervention of \"Rotbodi comitis mater\" .\n\nComte Albert I & his wife had [six] children:\n\n1. ROBERT de Namur (-before 1031). The Fundatio Ecclesiæ S Albani Namucensis names \"comes Albertus secundus, ortus ex patre Lothariensi, matre vero Francigena Ermengarde, nobilissimam Francorum regum prosapiam trahente\" , which is assumed to indicate that Comte Albert and Ermengardis were the parents of Robert. He succeeded as ROBERT II Comte de Namur. The Gesta Episcoporum Cameracensium records that, after the battle of Hougaerde/Hoegaarden (dated to 1013), Lambert Comte de Louvain captured \"Herimannum comitem\" and placed him in the custody of \"Rotberdo Namurcensi comite\", before he was released after the intervention of \"Rotbodi comitis mater\" . The Miracula Sancti Veroni names \"comitem Ratbodum\" when recording that he recovered from fever after being taken to the relics of St Veronus . \"Heinricus Romanorum imperator augustus\" brought under his protection the abbey of Saint-Jean de Florennes \"in pago et in comitatu Lommensi sitam, cuius nunc comes adest Ratbodus\", founded by Gerard Bishop of Cambrai, by charter dated 1018 . m ---. No reference has been found to the wife of Comte Robert II. Comte Robert II & his wife had one child:\n\na) son . The Miracula Sancti Gengulfi name \"Radbodus Namurcensium comes\" and record that \"filio suo morte gravatu\" was cured by St Gengulf . No other reference has been found to this child, who presumably died young.\n\n2. ALBERT de Namur (-[1063/64]) . The Genealogica comitum Buloniensium records that \"Ermengardis\" was mother of \"Albertum comitem de Namuco\" . He succeeded his brother as ALBERT II Comte de Namur. He founded Saint-Aubain at Namur, as shown by the Fundatio Ecclesiæ S Albani Namucensis which records \"comes Albertus secundus, ortus ex patre Lothariensi, matre vero Francigena Ermengarde, nobilissimam Francorum regum prosapiam trahente\" as founder of the church . The Gesta Episcoporum Leodiensium records \"bellum apud Rivoniam\" in 1048 where \"Albertus Namucensis\" was killed by \"Godefrido duce\" . m REGELINDIS of Lower Lotharingia, daughter of GOZELON I Duke of Lower Lotharingia & his wife ---. The Fundatio ecclesiæ Sancti Albani Namurcensis refers to the wife of \"comes Albertus secundus\" as \"Gothelonis ducis filia\" but does not name her . The Chronicon Hanoniense names \"Gosseclone ducis Lotharingie [filia] Raelendem\" as wife of \"Alberto comiti\" . The Genealogica ex Stirpe Sancti Arnulfi names \"Godefridum ducem, Odam et Regelindam\" as children of \"Gozelo, frater Arnulphi et Godefridi\" . Her birth date range is estimated from her eldest son being born before 1035. She was given Durbuy as her dowry by her father. Comte Albert II & his wife had two children:\n\na) ALBERT de Namur (before 10 Aug 1035-22 Jun 1102) . The Genealogica comitum Buloniensium records that \"Albertum comitem de Namuco\" was father of \"Albertum et fratrem eius Heinricum comitem de Durboio\" . He succeeded his father as ALBERT III Comte de Namur.\n\n- see below.\n\nb) HENRI [I] de Namur (-after 23 Apr 1088) . The Genealogica comitum Buloniensium records that \"Albertum comitem de Namuco\" was father of \"Albertum et fratrem eius Heinricum comitem de Durboio\" . The Chronicon Huberti names \"Albertus comes Namucensis et Henricus Durboiensis\", but does not specify the relationship between them . Comte de Durbuy. \"Heinricus Romanorum imperator augustus\" confirmed donations to St Jakob, Liège by charter dated 23 Apr 1088, at the request of \"Heinrico comite de Durbui\" .\n\n- COMTES de DURBUY.\n\n3. HADWIDE de Namur ([1005/10]-28 Jan [1080]) . The Genealogica ex Stirpe Sancti Arnulfi names \"Hadewidem et Emmam de Los\" as the two daughters of \"Ermengardis [filiæ Karoli ducis]\" and as mother of \"Theodericum ducem et Gerardum comitem fratres\" . It is likely that Hedwig was born during that latter part of the married life of her parents, given her own death in [1080] and her father's death before 1010. The Liber Memoriales of Remiremont records the donation of \"Haduydis ducissa consentientibus filiis suis duce Teoderico atque comite Girardo\" . \"Hadewidis ductrix\" founded the abbey of Châtenois by charter dated to after 1075, confirmed \"post obitum ductricis Hadewidis\" by \"dux Theodericus filius eius\" . m GERARD Duke of Upper Lotharingia, son of GERHARD Graf & his wife Gisela --- (-Remiremont [14 Apr] or 11 Aug [1070]).\n\n4. [LIUTGARDE [Emma] de Namur . The Genealogica ex Stirpe Sancti Arnulfi names \"Hadewidem et Emmam de Los\" as the two daughters of \"Ermengardis [filiæ Karoli ducis]\" . The primary sources are contradictory regarding the identify of Liutgarde´s husband. The Gesta Abbatem Trudonensium names \"Lutgarde filia Hermegardis Namurcensis comitissæ, Ottonis prefati ducis filie\" as wife of \"Ottonis comitis de Los\", and the couple as parents of Baldric [II] Bishop of Liège . From a chronological point of view, it is impossible for a daughter of Albert I Comte de Namur and his wife Ermengarde (married in 990) to have been the mother of Baldric Bishop of Liège (installed as bishop in 1008). Another version is provided by the Vita Arnulfi which names \"Lugerdam, Godam, Ermengardam\" as the three sisters of \"Albertus comes Namurcensis\", adding that Liutgarde was the mother of \"Emmonem et Ottonem fratrem eius\" . No primary source has so far been found which names the father of the brothers Emmo and Otto. From a chronological point of view, it is possible that their father was Giselbert, son of Otto. If this is correct, it is possible that Liutgarde´s husband was Giselbert Comte de Looz. [m OTTO Comte [de Looz], son of ---] (-[before 1016]).] [m GISELBERT Comte de Looz, son of OTTO Comte [de Looz] & his wife --- (-[1044/46]).]\n\n5. GODA de Namur . The Vita Arnulfi names \"Lugerdam, Godam, Ermengardam\" as the three sisters of \"Albertus comes Namurcensis\", specifying that Goda was mother of \"Meinsindam matrem sancti Arnulfi episcopi Suessioniæ\" , although this may not be a reliable source as it is inaccurate in recording the descendants of Goda's supposed sister Liutgarde. m ---.

The Genealogica comitum Buloniensium records that \"Albertum comitem de Namuco\" was father of \"Albertum et fratrem eius Heinricum comitem de Durboio\" . He succeeded his father in [1063/64] as ALBERT III Comte de Namur. He claimed to succeed to the inheritance of his first cousin Godefroi III \"Le Bossu\" Duke of Lower Lotharingia in 1076, challenging the succession of Godefroi de Bouillon [Boulogne] and at one point unsuccessfully besieging the castle of Bouillon. As guardian of her interests in Lotharingia, Matilda of Tuscany granted Albert the county of Verdun which Theoderic Bishop of Verdun had bestowed on her in 1076, in order to thwart Godefroi de Bouillon´s inheritance . In addition, Emperor Heinrich IV appointed Albert as vice-duke of Lower Lotharingia in 1076 to rule for his infant son Konrad, whom he had installed as Duke of Lower Lotharingia . \"Heinricus tertius Romanorum imperator augustus\" confirmed the foundation of St Jakob, Liège by \"Albertus comes Nammucensium filiis [suis] Godefrido, Heinrico, Alberto\" by charter dated 1 Jun 1101 .

The Genealogia ex stirpe Sancti Arnulfi names \"Idam Namucensem uxorem Angelberti marchionis et Gertrudem comitissam Flandrensem\" as children of \"Bernardum\" . On her marriage, she brought her husband extensive lands north-east of the castle of Bouillon which later formed the county of La Roche . According to the Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines, her husband's claim to Bouillon was through the property brought by his wife .

The precise relationship is not known. His name suggests a close connection with the family of the Comtes de Huy (see the document LOWER LOTHARINGIA NOBILITY): maybe he was the same person as one of the individuals named there.\n\nB. SEIGNEURS de BEAUFORT\n\nThe medieval castle of Beaufort-sur-Meuse was located adjacent to the confluence of the rivers Solières and Meuse, a few kilometres west of Huy in the present-day Belgian province of Liège. The castle was built in [1184/94] on the site of an old church . Another family, maybe related, acquired the castle of Spontin in the county of Namur and were ancestors of the extant family of the dukes of Beaufort-Spontin (see SEIGNEURS de SPONTIN in the present document). These families were studied by Goethals in the mid-19th century who indicates common lines of descent . However, Goethals not only fails to cite sufficient primary sources to corroborate his early generations, but in many places his reconstructions are wildly inaccurate and bear no relationship to the primary sources quoted below. Goethals cites a Généalogie de Beaufort justifiée par-devant la chambre héraldique de Brabant in 1737 (citing Lefort, manuscrit aux archives de Liège): maybe this document included spurious connections on which he relied blindly. Extracts from some of the original sources quoted by Goethals have been incorporated below, but the commentary in his work should be treated with considerable caution.\n\nThree brothers, parents not identified. The sources quoted below indicate that they were ministeriales of Huy. They were presumably unconnected with the family of the avoués de Huy which is shown below (see AVOUES de HUY). The common use of the name Lambert in the two families is interesting, although the connection could have been through the female line.\n\n1.

Her parentage and marriage are indicated by the charter dated 15 Aug 1245 in which [her son] Henri chevalier et sire dOpprebais named the testamentary executors of [feu] son grand-père Arnoud [de Walhain] . As dowry, she was presumably granted Opprebais which was recorded as held by her father and was held by her son (see below). m secondly as her second husband, CECILE ---, widow of GUY [III] Seigneur de Séry et Lalobbe , daughter of --- (-after 1247).

The wife of Henri Seigneur de Beaumont is named in two different sources, one specifying her parentage, the other her name. For presentational purposes, it is assumed that both documents refer to the same person, although the possibility of two different marriages cannot be excluded. Jacques de Hemricourt records that mess. Istasses ly viez Persans de Haneffe and his wife had five daughters, of whom ...ly tirce al saingnor de Bealfor sor Mouze...qui ont des hoirs; desqueis issirent ly saingnors de Beafort, qui vendirent leur terre al conte de Namur . Beatrix relicte de jadis Henry seigneur de Beaufort chevalier, comme aussy mademoiselle Clemence fille dudit seigneur Henry...mademoiselle Sophie fille ainée du souvent dit Henry donated la disme de Benz, de Beaufort et de Gyvres to Solières by charter dated Jul 1274 .

Heiress of Beaufort. Sohier chevalier et sire de Bialfort et Soffie de Bialfort femme a devant dit Sohier confirmed that messires Ernus qui jadis fut chevalier et sire de Bialfort had during his lifetime donated la disme...de Bialfort et de Benz, de Gievres to Solières, with the consent of ses oirs...monsagneur Henry chevalier, Ernus et Wathier si freres et Clemence lor sure, by charter dated late Aug 1281, sealed by Saingnor Rasson chevalier jadit seigneur de Liedekerke, saingnor Sohier chevalier jadit seigneur de Bialfort et dame Soffie dame de Bialfort jadite femme et epouse a dit seignur Sohier . Borman & Poncelet indicate that Sophie was fille soit dArnold, soit de Wauthier , which is incompatible with the Aug 1281 charter. Goethals says that her marriage was arranged by Jean dEnghien Bishop of Liège , which if correct dates the event to after 1274 when he was elected bishop. m ([Jul 1274/Sep 1280]) SIGER van Gavre, son of RASO [X] van Gavre Heer van Liederkerke & his wife Marguerite dEnghien ([1240/50?]-after 24 Nov 1299).\n\nii) CLEMENCE de Beaufort . Beatrix relicte de jadis Henry seigneur de Beaufort chevalier, comme aussy mademoiselle Clemence fille dudit seigneur Henry...mademoiselle Sophie fille ainée du souvent dit Henry donated la disme de Benz, de Beaufort et de Gyvres to Solières by charter dated Jul 1274 .\n\nb)ARNAUD [II] de Beaufort (-[24 Dec 1301/29 Sep 1305], bur Signy). Waltherus de Barch advocatus Hoiensis, Rigaldus, Egidius, Johannes fratres ac milites de Belloforti noted that Arnoldus miles quondam dominus de Belloforti...et executores testamenti sui had donated medietatem...decime...de Benz et de Bialfort to Solières, where he was buried, with the consent of Henrici militis, Arnoldi, Waltheri et Clementie heredum suorum, by charter dated 21 Sep 1250 .

The explanation for Arnaud [II] being seigneur de Beaufort at the same time as his brother Henri has not been found. Goethals assumes that Arnaud [I] was the donor named in Oct 1258/1259 , which is disproved by the 21 Sep 1250 charter quoted above which confirms that Arnaud [I] was already deceased at that time. Henri and Arnaud [II] presumably inherited their fathers seigneurie jointly: could they have been twins? Another question is whether Arnaud [II] was the unnamed brother of Henri in the [8 Feb] 1263 charter quoted above, a possibility which seems reasonable if the two brothers were joint seigneurs. Seigneur de Séry et de Lalobbe: Arnous de Biaufort chevaliers sires de Seris et de la Lobe and Alis sa femme dame des mêmes lieux acted in a charter dated Apr 1284 .

The chronology suggests that Alix may have been another daughter of Arnaud [II] de Beaufort. If that is correct, her absence from her supposed mothers 29 Sep 1305 testament could be explained if she was already married at the time. m VILAIN de Resson [Aulnay], son of --- (-before 13 Feb 1323).]\n\nc) GAUTHIER de Beaufort (-after 1264). Waltherus de Barch advocatus Hoiensis, Rigaldus, Egidius, Johannes fratres ac milites de Belloforti noted that Arnoldus miles quondam dominus de Belloforti...et executores testamenti sui had donated medietatem...decime...de Benz et de Bialfort to Solières, where he was buried, with the consent of Henrici militis, Arnoldi, Waltheri et Clementie heredum suorum, by charter dated 21 Sep 1250 .

Seigneur de Goesnes. A charter dated 1242 records that Walterus de Belloforti miles quondam domini de Guenes had donated decimam...apud Ramelou to Solières . He is named as brother of Sibylle in the [Feb] 1229 charter quoted below. He was buried at Solières 6 Feb 1242 . m (after Mar [1229/30]) as her second husband, LUCIE de Douchery, widow of HUGUES de Chiny Seigneur de Mellier et de Neufchâteau, daughter of RENAUD de Douchery & his wife --- (-after Apr 1244). Her parentage is confirmed by the charter dated Mar 1220 under which [her first husband] Hugues Seigneur de Malières acknowledged estre homme lige de son cousin Henry comte de Bar after the homage de son neveu Louis comte de Chiny and promised that, after the death of M. Renaud de Douchery son beau-père, he would retake land en fief dudit comte . Lucie dame de Marliers et chastelainne de Maisieres et...Thiebaus ses fiz sires dou Nuefchastel en Ardenne founded a chapel à Saint Bale deleiz Donchery by charter dated Mar 1229 (O.S.?) . Lucia domina de Marliers...et filius meus dominus Theobaldus miles...assensu, confirmed a donation made by domini Hugonis quondam mariti mei to Orval by charter dated 24 Apr 1234 . Her second marriage is confirmed by the Apr 1244 charter cited below. Lucie dame de Marliers et Thiebaus mes filz sires del Nufchastel donated various properties to Orval by charter dated Jun 1239 . She married thirdly Aubry de Certisy [Courtiézy]: Bauduins sire dAutri granted his rights au bois dArches, la moitié de ce je avoie ancontre monsignor Aubri de Certisi et madame de Marliers sa femme, to Hugues [III] Comte de Rethel by charter dated Oct 1239 . Lucie châtelaine de Mézières donated property to Mézières Saint-Pierre, for the anniversaries of Regnaud son père, dIsabelle sa fille, de Hugues de Mellier son premier mari, de Wautier de Beaufort son second époux, dAubri de Courtisi son troisième mari encore vivant, de Thibaut de Mellier son fils, by charter dated Apr 1244 .\n\n3. SIBYLLE de Beaufort ([1200?]-after 30 Jan 1270, bur Solières) . [There remains a certain amount of doubt regarding Sibylles place in the Beaufort family. A charter records declarations of fiefholders of Liège Saint-Lambert, given le dimanche jour devant le chandeleur 1229 (O.S.?), convoked by Dame Sibille Dame de Clermont who had donated to Solières les alus...de bois de Bialfort ki li heurent de par Men Seignor Watir se frère ense deveitz and who had granted a fourth part to Mes Sires Jakenes de Clermont with a life interest to Messire Simons freres a devant dit Jakemen de Clermont chanone de St-Lambier a Lige . This document is basically the same as the 1269 document quoted below, with a different date. The reference to the donors brother Gauthier en se veveit suggests that the date in the earlier document was mistranscribed and that the later date is correct. If that is correct, Mes Sires Jakenes de Clermont was Jacques [II] de Clermont, Sibylles supposed son, although it is somewhat surprising that the family relationship is not specified in the document. If the 1229 date was correct, Jacques would have been Jacques [I] de Clermont, Sibylles husband, in which case the reason for Sibylle granting a life interest to her husbands brother (who would have had no blood relationship to the Beaufort family) is unclear. Another possibility is that Sibylle was the second wife of Jacques [II] de Clermont (the solution adopted by Borman & Poncelet ), which would mean that she belonged to a later generation of the Beaufort family. However, in that case there seems even less reason for Sibylle to have granted any property interest to her two stepsons neither of whom would have had any Beaufort connection. In conclusion therefore, the 1269 is preferred, indicating that Sybilles husband was Jacques [I]. This conclusion appears corroborated by the 29 May 1264 charter quoted below which names Sibylles supposed brothers Jean and Rigaud as oncles of Jacques [II].] [If that conclusion is correct, the following two documents refer to, but do not name, Sibylle who was acting for her minor son Jacques [II] after the death of her husband: \"Ly abbe de Flone et sire Arnuz de Beafort\" notified the choice of arbitrators to decide a dispute between Flône and \"le damme de Clermont et Jakemin se filh\" by charter dated 25 Nov 1234 . A charter dated 6 Jul 1235 records the arbitral decision in the dispute between Flône and \"domina de Claromonte et Jacobus filius eius\" concerning fishing rights in the Meuse .] Alix Duchess of Brabant, by charter dated 29 May 1264, recorded the settlement between the murderers of Godefroit et Jakemin son frere de Flepe and mon sainor Jakemon de Cleirmont ki oncles estoit a Godefroi et a Jakemin devant dis de par le mere et tot son linaige et..., whereby the murderers left on crusade, the said Jacques sharing the decision regarding their return, substituting for him successively messires Johans de Bealfort ses oncles...messires Rygaulz de Bealfort li sires de Falaiz . Her suggested birth date indicates that Sibylle was one of her parents older children. A charter records declarations of fiefholders of Liège Saint-Lambert, given le diurs devant le Chandeloir 1269 (O.S.), relating to el teroir de bois de Bialfort, convoked by dame Sibilhe dame de Clermont who had donated to Solières les alus...de bois de Bialfort ki li heurent de par Men Seignor Watir se frère en se veveit and who had granted a fourth part to mes sires Jakemes de Clermont with a lif"
