She made her first appearance on screen on September 19th, 2003 and left the show on November 10th, 2009. Hiersche then returned for a guest stint on January 29th, 2010 and left the show again on February 11th 2010. Her role as the lesbian businesswoman was praised by critics and became a fan favorite with a strong following.\n\nStorylines\n\nWe get to know Carla as the oldest daughter of the aristocrat Johannes von Lahnstein (Thomas Gumpert) and a very smart and strong businesswoman. She is a lesbian, but because she is afraid her father would contravenes her, she starts out keeping her sexual orientation a secret. Only her younger brother Leonard (Lars Korten) knows about Carla's love for women.\n\nWhen Carla meets Hanna Novak (Katharina Dalichau), a straight woman, who is in a relationship with the attorney Lars Schneider (Herbert Ulrich), she falls in love with her. she, however, doesn't think that she has any chance. Hanna and Carla begin to build a deep and good friendship which shatters when Hanna gets confronted with Carla's feelings for her. Hanna tells her that she loves Lars and isn't bisexual. Carla understands, but can't go on with their friendship. When Carla keeps a distance to her, Hanna notices that she cares for Carla and might feel more for her than she thought.\n\nMeanwhile, Carla develops a friendship with Bernd von Beyenbach (Ron Holzschuh), who falls in love with the young and attractive countess. But every approach that Bernd is doing fails and he can't tell why. When Bernd witnesses a fight between Carla and her former lover, her assistant Evelyn Thoma, she tells Bernd the truth. Carla wants to buy Bernd's silence about her homosexuality, but Bernd tells her that he remains silent because of their friendship. Carla sees that she found a good and loyal friend in Bernd. When Evelyn crashes Johannes' wedding with CÃ©cile de Maron (Yvonne Burbach) to tell everyone that Carla is a lesbian, Bernd comes to her rescue and presents himself as Carla's fiancÃ©. To Carla's shock, Johannes takes the moment and makes an official announcement about his daughters engagement. Bernd moves in with Carla to present them as a happy couple.\n\nWhen Hanna hears about Carla's engagement with Bernd, she is shocked and confused and comes to the castle to speak with Carla. After she knows about the circumstances, she is happy and confesses her love to Carla. When Lars finds out that Hanna left him for Carla, he wants revenge, but Hanna can persuade him to stay quiet. Meanwhile, Carla finally wants to tell her father the truth but at the last minute she can't go through with it. Bernd on the other side is happy to stay and continue as Carla's fiancÃ©. A role he quickly learned to live with.\n\nHanna and Carla have a secret love affair, but their relationship has to face trouble, when Bernd's daughter Vanessa (Inez BjÃ¶rg David) wants to take revenge on Lars for rejecting her and asserts that he raped her. Lars sees that Vanessa's lie could ruin him and blackmails Bernd with his fake engagement to Carla. When Hanna finds out about Lars' situation, she wants to help him but Lars is still upset that she left him for Carla. They have a huge fight, in which Lars pushes her down the stairs by accident. Hanna is wounded, but won't see a doctor. When Leonard looks after her and sees a blue stain on her back, he persuades her to go in the hospital. The diagnose is a shock, when Hanna needs surgery and loses a kidney. Carla is worried about her and despairs when the doctors tell Hanna that her second kidney is soon to fail too. Hanna's nephew Felix von Beyenbach (Stefan Kirch) and Lars ask all their friends to get tested for a donation, but all results are negative - except for one: Hanna's hated sister Sylvia Jones (Heike Brentano) is the perfect donor. Hanna, however, doesn't want anything from Sylvia. Carla is very upset over it and fears to lose Hanna for good. When Hanna sees how much Carla is suffering over the situation, she decides to take Sylvia's kidney.\n\nAfter the successful donation, Carla is happy to finally have her great love safe and with her but Hanna is hunted by nightmares about her death. She is convinced that she will die. Hanna reconciles with her sister and enjoys a getaway with Carla. When they get back, Hanna and Carla spend a night on the Rhein, where Carla gets confronted with Hanna's prevision about her death. Carla can't believe it and dreams about a future together with Hanna. They both fall asleep and spend the whole night on the water. When Carla wakes up the next morning, she realizes that Hanna is dead. She falls into a shock, while Hanna's body gets picked up. Days later, she realizes that Hanna is really gone and in her grief over her great love, she tells Ansgar (Wolfram Grandezka) about her love for Hanna, not knowing that he will hold that against his sister.\n\nCarla finally wants to come clean to her father about her sexual orientation, but Ansgar talks her out of it. When her former lover, Evelyn Thoma, returns in Carla's life, Ansgar hopes that they will get close again. Carla doesn't want anything to do with Evelyn. Ansgar installs a web cam and hopes that he gets prove out of Carla's own mouth. Meanwhile, with Hanna's sudden death, Carla decides to make her camouflage perfect and wants to marry Bernd. On the wedding day, Ansgar sends Johannes a video with Carla's confession about her homosexuality. Disappointed by his daughter, she tries to explain everything to him, but Johannes wouldn't let her and wants her to marry Bernd. With tears in her eyes, Carla gives Bernd the word of consent.\n\nCarla's marriage with Bernd gets rocky, when she sees more and more what Bernd is really interested: the title and money of the Lahnstein family. He gets a position at the Lahnstein Holding, but soon gets unpopular by Ansgar and Johannes. Later, Bernd even becomes a prime suspect in the murder of Donald Rush (Andreas Engelmann), but is found innocent after Sylvia alibi's in the last minute. Bernd isn't Carla's only problem. His daughter Vanessa fears that she could lose the luxuries afforded by Bernd's marriage to Carla and tells Carla that she is a lesbian herself to get her friendship. Carla has a short affair with Anke Hoffmann, but Vanessa claims that Anke is interested in her, which destroys the relationship between Carla and her. Soon, Carla realizes that Vanessa played her. When Bernd is proved innocent, she has finally had enough and files for divorce.\n\nFollowing the drama with Bernd, Carla meets Susanne Brandner (Claudia Scarpatetti), who was recently divorced from her husband Alex (Frank Behnke) and who had moved back to her hometown from Buenos Aires. Susanne has an adopted son, Paul (Tobias SchÃ¶nenberg), and also had custody of her stepdaughter, Lisa (Lilli Hollunder), but longed for another child. In fall 2006, Carla and Susanne marry and decide to have a baby together. Susanne wants Lars Schneider to be the father for their child. Carla is skeptical because of her history with Lars but when she sees that she and Lars can be friends, she agrees. Susanne wants to carry the baby and is heartbroken when she discovers that she is infertile. Then Carla agrees to bear the baby, even though she has a problem again with the fact that Lars will be the father. She eventually resigns herself to that fact and gets pregnant through a sperm donation. During her pregnancy, Carla decides to work in New York for some time, before she returns to the wedding of her best friend Nathalie KÃ¤ppler (Jenny Winkler) with her brother Ansgar.\n\nWith her long departure, she soon needs to realizes that a lot has happened, when she finds Susanne and Lars as good friends. Carla gets really disappointed, when she finds out that Susanne's daughter Lisa was kidnapped while she was in New York and Carla didn't tell her about that. The problems between them get more serious when Susanne begins to develop serious romantic feelings for Lars. Carla feels that Susanne is slipping away from their marriage and has a one-night-stand with her old fried Frederike von Traunitz. Even though the birth of their daughter Sophia brings Carla and Susanne close again, they soon realize that their marriage failed. They get divorced on december 21st 2007, where both confess that they will always have feelings for each other. After a relationship with Lars didn't work out for Susanne, because of her feelings for Carla, Susanne decides to leave town and search together with daughter Lisa for happiness in France, where her son Paul has lived for a while now.\n\nAfter her marriage with Susanne failed, Carla becomes more and more a businesswoman, after her father died after his plan crashed. She becomes the majority owner of the Lahnstein empire and works together with her stepmother Elisabeth (Martina Servatius). When her daughter Sophia gets kidnapped by Adrian Degenhardt (Klaus Zmorek), Carla fears to see her daughter never again. They pay twice ransom to the - for the Lahnsteins - anonymous kidnapper, before it is Adrian that \"rescues\" Sophia. Constantin (Milan Marcus) gets suspicious about Adrian's involvement in Sophia's kidnapping, but nothing can be proved and Adrian remains as Sophia's rescuer. After the shocking kidnapping of her daughter, Carla is working a lot again and begins to long for a new relationship. Elisabeth and Nathalie try to pair her with somebody (Ilka), but it doesn't work out.\n\nBut Carla's next destined meeting comes, when she meets the young, attractive and saucy Stella Mann (Anne Wis). Carla gets splashed with water by Stella, when she drives through a puddle. It's a big surprise for both women when Stella later wants to have the job as the new caretaker on Castle KÃ¶nigsbrunn.\n\nsource wikipedia\n\nZuletzt geÃ¤ndert von Novemberstern am 04.05.2010, 20:48, insgesamt 1-mal geÃ¤ndert.\n\nscreenshot me\n\nall rights reserved to das erste.de\n\nAnsgar von Lahnstein\n\nAnsgar Eduard Johannes von Lahnstein is portrayed by actor Wolfram Grandezka.

His complicated relationship with his family; having to prove himself to his father, rival his half-siblings and developing a new rivalry with his uncle Ludwig von Lahnstein against the deep love for his son and the honest feelings for his father and his half-sister Carla.\n\nStorylines\n\nAnsgar is the oldest son of Johannes von Lahnstein. Since his childhood he was under pressure and he always has the feeling that he never was enough for his father. The only people that ever understood him, was his late mother Francesca. He was always jealous on his two younger siblings Leonard and Carla. After his professional training, he left KÃ¶nigsbrunn and moved to Singapore to managed a branch of the 'Lahnstein Bank'. To make Johannes proud, Ansgar is always into illegal business to become what he wants. After years in Singapore, he returns in January 2004 to his family. Carla called him, because she is worried that the new wife of their father is after the family legacy. Also his new half-sister Nico isn't easy to handle. His first actions are to take over a media concern, 'Beyenbach AllMedia', but the CEO Sylvia Jones is a smart business-woman and wouldn't give up so easy. 'Ryan Cosmetics', a subsidiary company of 'Beyenbach AllMedia', is also affected. Ansgar buys both companies and cost the lifework of Elisabeth Brandner. Then, Ansgar finds out that his sister Carla is a lesbian at his fathers wedding, when Carla's former lover bobbed up. But Carla doesn't want a coming out and wants to marry Bernd von Beyenbach.

Sylvia becomes Ansgar's job and he has to leave the holding. She can argue Johannes to leave things with Rush for the moment. Tanja proffers to speak with Rush about the deal and - as Tanja planned it - Rush tries to kill her. Johannes is thankful to her and Tanja is back in Johannes' favor. Then, she kills Rush and puts the guilt on Bernd. The first suspicion falls on Ansgar, what was part of Tanja's plan. When the police wants to speak with Ansgar, Tanja offering him an alibi, if he marries her. Ansgar agrees, but Johannes finds out, that the alibi was a fake and wants Tanja out of KÃ¶nigsbrunn. Now it time for Tanja's last trump and she says in front of anybody, that she knows the identity of the real killer: Bernd von Beyenbach! Bernd seeks for an alibi and finds out, that Sylvia Jones saw him on a main rood. But Sylvia hates Bernd, after he takes the fault of the death of his brother and his wife, and doesn't wanna give it to him. Now, Ansgar wants back in the company - with Tanja's help. She engaged Hagen Berg to make Sylvia fall in love with him. And her plan works out, but then Hagen falls in love with Sylvia too. Ansgar informs anyone that Carla is a lesbian and suspends the guit to Sylvia and Hagen. After that, Johannes fires Sylvia. Tanja plans to kill Hagen, but Sylvia can rescue him and both leave DÃ¼sseldorf. When Tanja finds out, that Hagen isn't dead, she is furious. The murder case about Donald Rush goes in the second round. Bernd is short to his conviction, but then Sylvia arrives in the court room and tells that Bernd is innocent. Ansgar believes that the police will go after him again, but Tanja wants to put the guilt now on Sylvia. But her plan doesn't works out and Sylvia moves together with Hagen to Canada. Relieved, Tanja breaks down.\n\nTanja is pregnant with Ansgar's child and realizes that she has feelings for the father of her child. The police investigates the murder of Donald Rush again. Johannes wants to pretend his son and believes that Tanja is the murderer. For that reason, Tanja decides to have the baby and to have a pressure on Ansgar. He wants Tanja out of his life and wants to find - together with Bernd - proof that she killed Rush. But Tanja is faster and kills the only man, who could know something. Ansgar is desperately and finds out about Tanja's pregnancy. He wants an abortion, but it's too late for that. Ansgar kidnaps Tanja and locked her in a house. But Tanja can break out and leaves the country.\n\nOne year later, Tanja comes back to DÃ¼sseldorf and wants that Ansgar would be a father for their son Hannes. He agrees, but he doesn't wants to be a husbund for Tanja. Both of them fight about the custody. After a plot by Tanja, the court gave Ansgar the custody. Tanja swore revenge.\n\nIn March 2007, Ansgar marries his big love Nathalie and wants to be a family with Hannes and her. But Tanja has other plans and wants to flee with her son.\n\nIn August 2008, after a blackmail from Tanja, he divorces Nathalie and needs to marry Tanja to get his then former wife out of jail. Ansgar tries to get away from Tanja as soon as possible, but that is more complicated than he expected. He still as a love affair with Nathalie, which leads Tanja to several schemes to break them up completely. Nathalie stays strong, but then gives Ansgar up anyway; not longer wanting to be the third person in a marriage.\n\nsource wikipedia\n\nscreenshot me\n\nall rights reserved to das erste.de\n\nNathalie KÃ¤ppler\n\nNathalie KÃ¤ppler (formerly von Lahnstein) is portrayed by actress Jenny Winkler. She made her first appearance on screen on November 12th in 2004.\n\nCharacter's background\n\nChildhood\n\nNathalie grows up in the East Germany and lost her parents, when she fled to West Germany during the DDR. She finds a new home by her aunt Elke KÃ¤ppler (Elke Bludau). Elke works as head maid for the aristocratic Lahnstein family. Nathalie grows up with them and soon finds good friends in Carla (Claudia Hiersche) and her brother Leonard (Lars Korten). With their oldest brother Ansgar (Wolfram Grandezka), Nathalie's relationship isn't so good. He makes always fun of her and likes to play his little games with him. But even through, Nathalie has a crush on him, which Ansgar never saw or doesn't want to see. With eighteen years, she leaves her aunt Elke and the Lahnstein family to study aboard to become a professional interpreter.\n\nNathalie's Return\n\nIn 2004, after ten years, Nathalie returns to her old homes and reunites with her friends and aunt Elke. When the arrogant Ansgar first sees her, he can't remember who she is, but finds out eventually, that Nathalie is the kid he grew up with and became a very attractive woman since then. Nathalie truly didn't forget Ansgar or the feelings she once had for him. But she denies them now, seeing his arrogant type and despises him for that. Carla is happy that her old best friend returned and they remember old times together. Then Nathalie begins to support Carla in her war against Ansgar, when she finds out, that he outed his sister as a lesbian. Ansgar tries to frighten Nathalie, but it doesn't work, so that he tries to play the friends against each other. But Nathalie stays on Carla's side and proves Ansgar once and for all that she isn't this naive kid anymore. Nathalie begins to work as professional interpreter for Johannes (Thomas Gumpert) and the 'Lahnstein Holding'.\n\nLars and Nathalie\n\nBy an accident, Nathalie meets the smart and attractive attorney Lars Schneider (Herbert Ulrich). Soon after they met, Lars begins to fall for Nathalie and she can't deny her feelings for Lars either. After a few approaches they become a couple. But soon later, Nathalie sees that she can't really love Lars. When he finds out about Nathalie's second thoughts to their relationship, he wants to end it, which becomes reality, when Lars becomes a generous job offer in Hamburg. After a lovely goodbye from Nathalie, Lars leaves DÃ¼sseldorf and leaves Nathalie sad behind.\n\nWhen Lars returns more than one year later, they both remain as friends. When Nathalie, who is now married to Ansgar has serious problems with him and becomes an addict to alcohol, Lars is the one who is always there for her. He even rescues her from attempted suicide. After Nathalie went to rehab both come closer again. Lars is working on Nathalie's divorce from Ansgar, when they get even closer and spend a night together. After this night, Nathalie sees what a person Lars really is for her and tells him that she has deep feelings for him. While Nathalie is filing for divorce, Lars and her become a couple again. But Ansgar wants Nathalie back and sets up Olivia Schneider (Kristina DÃ¶rfer), Lars' niece, to break the happy couple up. Ansgar has success, when Lars cheats on Nathalie with Kitty KÃ¼bler. When Nathalie sees a sex tape about Lars' cheating, she breaks up with him. Lars tries to rescue his relationship to her, but Nathalie doesn't want him back.\n\nAnsgar and Nathalie\n\nSince she was a teenager, Nathalie fell for Ansgar. When she returns after years as an attractive woman, Ansgar first recognizes her. After she and Lars broke up for the first time, Ansgar sees his chance and wants to be with Nathalie. But Ansgar already has a fiancÃ©e with unpredictable Tanja von Anstetten (Miriam Lahnstein), who sees Ansgar as her key into the Lahnstein family. Tanja gets really jealous and even plans to murder Nathalie, but her plan fails. After Tanja leaves town for a while, Ansgar and Nathalie get closer. They both spend a passionate night together, but Nathalie soon regrets the sex with Ansgar. But soon, Ansgar shows true feelings to Nathalie, and against all warnings, she and Ansgar become a couple. But at this time, Nathalie doesn't know that Ansgar is poisoning his own father to get to the Lahnstein fortune. To keep his good image to his father, Ansgar soon proposes to Nathalie. She refuses to say 'yes', but then she does anyway. But Ansgar begins to really care for Nathalie and regrets to have proposed to her only to look good to Johannes. When Ansgar takes the proposal back, Nathalie is really disappointed. But she doesn't give up and makes a proposal herself. Ansgar can't believe that Nathalie really loves him that much and happily says 'yes'. But Johannes is the only one who is as happy for them as they are.\n\nAnsgar, who really loves Nathalie, hopes that she stays on his side, when she finds out about Ansgar's intrigue against Johannes. But Nathalie has a hard time dealing with that and searches for comfort by her old friend Gregor Mann (Andreas Jancke). This comfort turns out as a one-night-stand and Nathalie soon gets the diagnoses that she is pregnant. Nathalie has no other choice and tells Ansgar about her night with Gregor. Ansgar is very disappointed and breaks his engagement to Nathalie. Gregor wants to be there for Nathalie and wants to be a father for the child that Nathalie is expecting, but she eventually loses the baby.\n\nMeanwhile, Tanja returns with her son Hannes (then played by Daniel and Simon KÃ¼hn) and the father is no other than Ansgar. She hopes that she now has a future with Ansgar with the potential heir to the Lahnstein dynasty. But Ansgar isn't thinking about getting back with Tanja, because he still has strong feelings for Nathalie. And finally she is the one, who helps Ansgar to be a real father to his son. The former couple gets closer again and Ansgar is thinking of a family together with Hannes and Nathalie. He tells her how he fells and that he still loves her. Ansgar and Nathalie become eventually a couple again, which makes Tanja really unhappy, because she thinks that Nathalie would become Hannes' mother and she would lose her son sooner or later. For Tanja it gets even worse, when Ansgar proposes to her again. Tanja tries to break them up, before they get married, but doesn't have success. Tanja promises Nathalie right before the wedding that this would be the last happy day of her life and she should enjoy this day.\n\nAnd Tanja's promise turns out to come true, when Hannes gets missing, while she was watching him, soon after the wedding. Ansgar blames Nathalie and can't cope with the lost of his son. He soon begins affairs, one of them with Olivia Schneider. Nathalie becomes an addict to alcohol and Ansgar only wants to keep Nathalie as his wife for the press and to pretend a strong family in public. But Nathalie's world more and more falls apart and she tries to win Ansgar back and fails over and over again. One day, when she is driving after she drunk a lot, Nathalie hits Charlie Schneider (Gabriele Metzger), Lars' older sister. She tells Ansgar and he covers the crime, but only to keep the name Lahnstein clean. After that, Ansgar loses any respect for Nathalie and treats her like crap. He even puts her into psychiatry, when she begins a desperate affair with Ansgar's enemy Adrian Degenhardt (Klaus Zmorek) to get back at him. Nathalie can't stop drinking and only sees one way out: She wants to kill herself by jumping from a bridge, after she realizes that Adrian only used her too. And even hold her hostage, when Nathalie finds out, that Adrian is Leonard's real father. But Lars comes to her rescue. After that, Nathalie goes to a rehab facility.\n\nWhen she returns, she sees that her marriage with Ansgar is over and wants a divorce. But soon, Ansgar sees that Nathalie could help him to win back custody of Hannes, which he lost to his sister Carla.

The car accident, in which Francesca supposedly died, was faked to safe her own but also the lives of her children. Scared that the mafia would harm him, she had to stay away.

Ansgar decides that he has to be sure and asks her some things from his childhood that only his mother could knew about. Maria doesn't want to answer some questions and proving herself to Ansgar.

Charlie is happy when Oliver comes to DÃ¼sseldorf. Charlie and Oliver's mother Henriette (Susanne Seuffert) haven't had the best relationship and she kept Charlie from Oliver's childhood. Oliver is a young dreamer and bisexual. His first relationship with a man, the doctor Tom Seifert (Kay BÃ¶ger), was very complicated. His mother showed up and Oliver kept his relationship with Tom as a secret. The sister of Tom, Alexa (Kerstin Kramer), helped him out and played the role of alibi girlfriend. But Henriette finds out about Oliver's relationship with Tom and is disgusted and puts the fault on Charlie. Henriette wants Oliver to end things with Tom or she would stop giving him money to live. Oliver breaks with his mother and Charlie promises him that she will provide for him.\n\nAfter his relationship with Tom ends in 2002, Oliver leaves DÃ¼sseldorf and begins to work as steward. Five years later, on November 2, 2007, Oliver comes back for the christening of his cousin Sophia von Lahnstein, daughter of his uncle Lars (Herbert Ulrich). He also reunites with Charlie and his other cousin Olivia (Kristina DÃ¶rfer). He moves into a flat-share and becomes friends with Coco Faber (Mariangela Seclsi) and her boyfriend Christian Mann (Thore SchÃ¶lermann). But Christian begins to have a problem with Oliver when he finds out that he also sleeps with men. With the tension between Christian and Oliver going on, Coco's friendship with Oliver becomes a problem in her relationship with Christian. After another fight, she goes out with Oliver and kisses him. Oliver wants to just forget about it, but Coco realizes that she is falling in love with him. Christian decides to give his friendship with Oliver another chance and it works and they become close friends. Coco isn't happy about that and tells Christian's sister-in-law Sarah Hofmann (Sina-Valeska Jung) about the kiss and her feelings for Oliver. At this time, Oliver realizes his feelings for Coco's boyfriend Christian.\n\nAfter this realization Oliver begins to want a relationship with Christian. When Christian finds out about the kiss that Oliver and Coco shared he becomes very angry with Oliver. He yells at Oliver \"Why should I believe that you don't have feelings for Coco?\" To which Oliver responds with a kiss for Christian as well. Christian at first thinks that all Oliver was trying to do was break up himself and Coco. Oliver tries to put the record straight and tells Christian that it was never his plan to break them up, but that he is in love with Christian. Christian becomes very withdrawn towards Coco who soon leaves the show giving Christian her blessing to start a relationship with Oliver as she can tell he also has feelings for him. Oliver and Christian are very strange around each other. Each not wanting to give away his true feelings. Christian starts to talk on a coming out website about his feelings for Oliver, never knowing that he was talking to Oliver anonymously on the website. Neither man knew he was speaking to the other. When Oliver posts a picture of himself on the website Christian thinks that Oliver knew it was him all along and was playing a joke with his feelings. Oliver responds that if Christian was having all these thoughts about coming out then he must be gay. Which Christian then denies and a kiss ensues followed by sex. The next day Christian tells Oliver that it was good they had sex, because he now knows that he is not interested in men. The guys also look for a new flatmate now that Coco is gone. Judith Hagendorf (Katrin HeÃŸ) moves in and comments on their closeness thinking them a gay couple which Christian denies. A few days later after getting pressure from his brother to date, Christian goes out with Mariam, a fellow waitress at No Limits. They go to a club and Christian sees Oliver with another guy and a fight erupts when the guy makes a pass at Oliver. Oliver accuses Christian of being jealous which Christian denies. Later on in the flat both Christian and Oliver admit they love one another, have sex again and begin to date secretly. Christian is scared to come out to his brother as he is the only family he has. Oliver is okay with Christian taking his time and Judith discovers Oliver and Christian's relationship. In the meantime, Christian has been given a contract by Wolle, a boxing contractor who hates gay people, so Christian hides his relationship with Oliver. When Christian wants to come clean to everyone, Oliver stops him and resolves to keep their love a secret as long as it takes to get Christian into the boxing world. When Christian falls into the temptation of taking steroids, Oliver reasons with him and stops him from doing so. Wolle by chance sees the two of them hugging and confronts them to which Christian denies everything and accuses Oliver of making a pass at him. Wolle hits back by making stinging remarks to Oliver and asks him to keep away from Christian.\n\nChristian fires Wolle as his manager. Gregor is confused as to why Christian has done this and offers to be his brother's manager. Christian is unsure whether to accept this offer, as he has still not come out to Gregor, who is oblivious to Olli's relationship with Christian. Olli comforts Christian and later that evening an unsuspecting Gregor walks in on them in a passionate clinch. Olli confirms their relationship to Gregor, who leaves promptly without comment. Christian believes his brother is not accepting of his relationship with Olli, and confronts Gregor, but Gregor still makes no remark. Olli finally breaks and also confronts Gregor, who finally realises what Christian believes Gregor thinks about the relationship. Gregor tells Christian that he accepts his brother's sexuality: the only reason he was angry was that Christian felt that he couldn't come out to his brother. They agree to stick together no matter what. Trouble soon arises again as Gregor feels that Christian needs a \"beard\" to cover his relationship with Olli and get back on terms with Wolle. This comes in the form of Judith, and for a while, everything is OK, until Fabian, who has been dating Judith, becomes annoyed as they have no time together. Things get even worse when Axel, another boxer under Wolle spots Fabian and Judith together. Believing Judith is having an affair with Fabian, Axel punches him. However, this means that Judith and Christian can end their fake relationship without question.\n\nFor a few weeks Oliver and Christian are minor characters in the soap while other storylines develop. In July Christian is preparing for his fight with Axel: if he wins, he will move into the National German Boxing Championship. His determination to win nearly destroy's his relationship with Olli, as he spends no time with his boyfriend, ending in a big argument just before Christian fights Axel. During the first part of the match, Olli stays at the apartment. After talking with Lydia, he realises that his relationship with Christian is not worth giving up on, and rushes to the boxing ring. Christian and Axel start boxing, but within a few minutes, Christian is knocked to the ground, unable to get back up again. Olli arrives just in time to encourage Christian to get back on his feet and continue fighting, until a few rounds later it is Axel who gets knocked to the ground, and doesn't get up, making Christian the winner. As Christian celebrates his victory, Olli joins him in the ring, and Christian publicly comes out by kissing Olli in front of the crowd. At the celebration party at \"No Limits\" later that evening, Olli and Christian are the last people left. Olli persuades Christian to go and take a bath while he cleans up. Just as Olli is locking the door Axel bursts in with a nightstick, eager for revenge, and badly beats Olli while Christian relaxes in his bath. Christian finds Olli lying under the bar, and rushes him to hospital, where the Doctors confirm that he will be okay. Christian blames himself for Olli's attack, and vows to get revenge.\n\nOlli and Christian start looking for a newspaper or magazine that will publish an article on Homophobia in Boxing. Unfortunately, they are rejected by every publisher, until Constantin saves the day by persuading his lesbian Aunt, Carla von Lahnstein, to enlist the help of a contact to get their story published. Carla manages to convince her contact to publish their story, on the grounds that Axel is charged with assault. However, due to lack of evidence Axel is released without charge, and the contact won't put their article in the magazine, for fear of being sued for libel. Carla refuses to be beaten and buys an entire Publishing Company, unafraid of being sued. The article is finally published, though it is not exactly what they hoped for.\n\nMeanwhile Olli is suffering from persistent headaches, but hides it from his friends and family, including Christian. While he and Christian are celebrating the possibility of getting a fellow boxer, Kai, to give evidence against Axel, Olli suddenly collapses, and is rushed to hospital again. He is found to have a brain haemorrhage, and has to have a life-threatening operation to stop it. Christian is terrified Olli won't make it, and slips away while everyone waits to find Axel. Unbeknownst to his boyfriend, Olli comes through the operation OK, but is in an artificial coma, and won't wake up for a few hours. While the rest of their family and friends rejoice at the news, Christian finally finds Axel, and is about to attack him with a baseball bat, when Olli's cousin Olivia, who also doesn't know about Olli pulling through, stops him, reminding him about his probation. Christian goes to the boxing club, and tries to persuade them to support him, but to no avail. On finding out Olli has pulled through he rushes back to the hospital to be with his boyfriend when he wakes up. Kai visits them, refusing to give evidence against Axel for fear of being discriminated against. Later on Kai sends Christian a confusing text, telling him to meet him at the Boxing Club. Christian lies to Olli and tells him he is going to the cafeteria and sneaks out to meet Kai. Olivia eventually tells Olli where his boyfriend has gone, leaving Olli scared but powerless to help. Christian arrives at the boxing club to find everyone, including Axel and Kai, waiting for him. Axel threatens to beat up Christian, not knowing that Kai has arranged for Police to hear their every word. They intervene and arrest Axel: Kai has decided to give evidence. Christian is even more surprised when the rest of the boxers welcome him back with open arms; free to be friends with him now Axel has gone. Christian returns to the Hospital to explain to Olli what has happened, and everything is well again.\n\nsource wikipedia"
