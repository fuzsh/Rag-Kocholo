        "text": "About Saint Cecilia\n\nHas there ever been a time when music has helped you in a way? Regardless of whether it was an energetic song getting you into your workout zone or a soothing ballad calming you down after a frustrating day, music has a way of helping us express emotions and get into the right mindset for different things. Some people use music occasionally for comfort, and others use it daily for the enjoyment of themselves and others. Music can be used for prayer, for play, and many other causes. It makes sense that this powerful method of expression would be attributed to one of the most venerated martyrs of Christianity.\n\nBorn around the 2nd or 3rd century A.D., Saint Cecilia is a woman shrouded in mystery and honored as a martyr. Popular tradition holds that she, the daughter of a wealthy family, was promised in marriage to a Roman pagan named Valerian, despite the fact that she had already vowed her virginity to God, fasting and praying that her promise be preserved. It is said that on the day of her wedding she heard heavenly music inside her heart, and that very same wedding night she confronted Valerian. She told him that she was betrothed to an angel, one who jealously guarded her body, and warned Valerian that he must be careful not to violate her virginity. Valerian insisted upon meeting this angel, and Cecilia sent him to the 3rd milestone on the Via Appia where he should meet the Bishop, Pope Urbanus. He was baptized by the pope and returned to Cecilia, where an angel came, crowning them with roses and lilies. Valerian’s brother, Tiburtius, came to visit them and was also converted to Christianity. It is also said that the brothers Cecilia converted became adamant witnesses to Christ, distributing rich alms and burying those who died glorifying Christ.\n\nThough the preceding stories were tradition, we know these following facts of their martyrdoms as historical truth. It did not take long for the Roman Prefect Turcius Almachius to notice the three Christian’s acts and condemn them to death. Maximus, the officer entrusted with the carrying through of this sentence, was converted as well and martyred by the sword with the two brothers. In light of this sudden betrayal, more trustworthy officers of the prefect were sent with haste to imprison Cecilia. Before being taken prisoner she made for her home to be used as a church after her inevitable martyrdom. She was taken before the prefect and condemned to suffocation in the baths of her home. Cecilia remained unscathed after spending quite a while in the overheated room, much to the frustration and confusion of her Roman holders, and the prefect sent in an executioner to finish the job. The executioner struck her neck thrice with a sword in an attempt to decapitate her, but failed with every stroke to separate her head from her shoulders. The Romans left her to die, bathed in a pool of her own blood. Miraculously, she lived three days more, preaching, converting pagans, favoring the poor, and making arrangements for her house to be dedicated as a place of worship. After her three days of suffering in prayer, St. Cecilia’s soul was passed over to God, her body buried in the Catacomb of Callistus by Pope Urbanus.\n\nUsually depicted with the crown of martyrdom or an organ, St. Cecilia is credited as the patron saint of musicians largely for her large following of musical dedication and her experience of heavenly music at her wedding. Her feast day is celebrated on the 22nd of November. St. Cecilia has opened up the doors of liturgical music, reminding us of the importance of faith through song in the lives of Christians throughout the church and the world.\n\nShop St. Cecilia Medals and Rosaries\n\nMore About St. Cecilia\n\nSt. Cecilia is often pictured with a musical instrument, and many musicians may pray for her guidance before a performance or recital. But why is St. Cecilia the patroness of music? And what is the rest of the story on this beautiful and well-loved saint?\n\nSt. Cecilia was born in the 2nd or 3rd century to a wealthy Christian family. From her childhood, she was promised to marry a man named Valerian, who was a pagan. St. Cecilia, however, had dedicated herself completely to God, and wore sackcloth, fasted and prayed in the hopes that she would be able to maintain her promise of virginity to God by convincing Valerian to marry someone else. Her efforts were in vain, though, and St. Cecilia and Valerian were married. During the wedding celebration, St. Cecilia heard heavenly music in her heart while the crowd around her engaged in bawdy and improper behavior. On their wedding night, St. Cecilia revealed to Valerian that she had promised her virginity to God, and that she was guarded by an angel sent to keep her pure. Valerian asked to see the angel, and St. Cecilia sent him to speak with Pope Urban.\n\nAccounts of how Valerian saw St. Cecilia’s angel vary; however, after meeting with Pope Urban, Valerian was convinced of St. Cecilia’s promise to God, and he himself was baptized a Christian. Upon returning home to St. Cecilia, they were both visited by an angel who bestowed a heavenly crown on each of their heads. Following this event, Valerian’s brother, Tibertius, is also converted to Christianity.\n\nValerian and Tibertius, both newly baptized and zealous for the Faith, decided to make it their mission to give a respectful burial to the Christian martyrs of the time. Due to this, the Roman prefect sentenced both of them to death. This did not stop St. Cecilia from sharing the Faith with all she met, trying to convert as many to Christianity as she could. The Roman prefect discovered her actions, and she too was sentenced to death. Her death was to be conducted by locking her in the bathhouse, and lighting the fires until she suffocated. The fires raged on and on, but after a full day and night, St. Cecilia was still alive. The prefect then ordered that St. Cecilia was to be beheaded. The executioner struck her neck with his axe three times, but was unable to completely behead her. She lay, badly wounded, for three days. As she lay dying, people came to her and she continued to preach and convert many to the heart of God. On the third day of her suffering, she died.\n\nHer remains were exhumed in 1599 and were incorrupt. This site is where the church of St. Cecilia was built in Rome. In this church, there is a statue over the spot where her body was discovered, depicting a woman lying on the ground, with her head turned away and a mark at her neck where she was struck with the axe.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages in Europe, devotion to St. Cecilia spread as many songs, poems, and paintings were created in her honor. In 1584 she was named patroness of the academy of music which was founded in Rome, Italy. She has been featured in many works, by artists such as Raphael, Rubens, Domenichino. Chaucer mentions her in “The Canterbury Tales.” Even the Andrews Sisters, in 1941, sang a song entitled, “The Shrine of St. Cecilia.”\n\nFind beautiful medals that honor Saint Cecilia here.\n\nThe Patronage of St. Cecilia\n\nSt. Cecilia is the patron saint of: the blind, bodily purity, composers, music and musicians, musical instrument makers, poets, and singers.
