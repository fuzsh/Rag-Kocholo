        "text": "Odile Marin\n\n(née Bazin)\n\nSuddenly, on Tuesday morning, October 10, 2023, our dear Madame Odile Marin of Winnipeg, Manitoba passed away at the age of 79 years.\n\nShe is predeceased by her husband Marcel who she loved very much and by her parents Romain and Gabrielle Bazin. She leaves to mourn her passing six children, Gaëtan, Louis (Pier Angeli), Sylvain (Cheryl), Alain (Rebecca), Ian (Catherine), Martin (Phyllis), 14 grandchildren, and 9 great grandchildren; six brothers and sisters, Thérèse, Léo, Denise, Cecile, Marial, Eugène and numerous nephews and nieces, relatives, and friends.\n\nOdile was a woman of great faith. She was a devoted and loving wife to her husband Marcel, of 38 years. Together they raised six wonderful sons. She often volunteered for events and funerals and attended mass on a regular basis. She was an assistant Postmaster at the Haywood Post Office for numerous years. Odile loved working in the garden, she loved birds and adored flowers. She was always interested in learning about other places, people, and cultures through her many travelling adventures around the world. She will be forever loved by her family and community and will be missed greatly.\n\nWe are especially grateful to the health care providers who administered care for Odile for her short stay at Health Sciences Center Winnipeg. We would also like to thank Adam's Funeral Home for their care and guidance through this difficult time.\n\nFuneral Mass will be celebrated at the Haywood Roman Catholic Church on Wednesday, October 18, 2023, at 2:00 p.m. preceded by Recitation of the Rosary, eulogy and video tribute at 1:30 p.m. Interment will follow in the Parish Cemetery.\n\nThe service will be available to view via Live Streaming. If you would like your name to appear in the guestbook, please email your name to office@afh.ca\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations may be made to Roman Catholic Missions, or to a charity of your choice.\n\nAdam's Funeral Home of Notre Dame de Lourdes, Manitoba in care of arrangements. Phone 248-2201 or 1-888-400-2326. www.afh.ca"
