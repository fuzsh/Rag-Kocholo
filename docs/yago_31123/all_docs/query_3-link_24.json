The minister of music (Angelo) provided music that was Holy Ghost filled and up-lifting.\n\nThe programs/bookmarks were beautiful and well done. The funeral DVD was well done. May God bless all of you. Thanks!\n\nTo the entire staff that was so helpful during a very difficult time in my life.\n\nI want to sincerely thank you for the unconditional love you showed me and my family. I truly appreciate you all from the heart.\n\n“Excellent service. Professional. Punctual. Everything (was) good about them. I just referred my sister to Shuler’s for a service this Saturday. Everything was done as we wanted. It was very helpful to us because this was the first funeral I had to plan in my life. They did such a wonderful job, so professional. I fell in love with Mr. Tony Austin (director of operations); the way he talks, the way he interacts with you. He was so kind and so gentle. It was all very well done.”\n\nNaudra Green, Boynton Beach, FL\n\nThis was my first personal experience dealing with the death and arrangements for a loved one. I was very grateful that it was you. Your calmness, and knowledge of the business and dealing with different personalities. The professional manner in which you handled my husband, allowing me the time to carry out my request, explaining why things were done that way, showing me the steps in the process provided me closure in this chapter of my life. He looked real and at rest and I thank you. All my needs were met in a classy professional manner, even after he was laid to rest. I will definitely be recommending your services.\n\nThank you for making a time in our lives where there was confusion less of a chore. Our beloved Roosevelt would have been truly pleased with the way you conducted business, and extended care to his family.\n\nMay God continue to bless you individually and collectively. We are indebted to you."
