        "text": "Suggests Beyoncé Should Let JAY-Z Be With Other Women\n\nIt’s no secret that Kanye West and his big brethren in music, JAY-Z, have had a rocky relationship over the years. As the two have made a classic album together amongst other moves, somewhere a long the line, the Brooklynite distanced himself from the outspoken MC.\n\nWhen asked about the state of his and JAY-Z’s relationship and lyrics from Hov’s “Moment of Clarity,” Ye responded to Owens, “Drake is the best rapper ever by the numbers, JAY-Z is the greatest rapper ever by the inspiration.” When breaking down what he meant, Ye unexpectedly said, “Yonce needs to let [JAY-Z] get some pu**y. Go to the DR or something.”\n\nHe then compared himself and JAY-Z to firefighters when it comes to combating issues in the music industry and beyond. “In order to be a good firefighter, you gotta be willing to run into that fire, and that’s what makes me the number one firefighter,” he declared. “That’s what makes me Michael, because I’ll run into that fire for the people in the burning building.” He referred to the latter as “society.”\n\nElsewhere, Ye also suggested that Bey and Jay lost the “best decision maker” on their team: him.\n\nConsiders Planned Parenthood The \"Black\" Version Of A \"Holocaust Museum\"\n\nAround the 18-minute mark of their conversation, Ye spoke on Jewish people and their own trauma from the Holocaust.\n\nYe claimed that the abortion rates amongst their community are way less, almost non-existent, than rates in the Black community. He then recalled his Drink Champs interview, where he told one of the hosts that he wanted him to go to “[Black people’s] Holocaust museum: Planned Parenthood.”\n\n“We’re still in the Holocaust,” he told Owens as she intensely listened. “6,000,000 Jewish people died in the Holocaust, over 20,000,000 darker Jews – Black people – have been aborted. More babies are aborted in New York than born.”\n\nBlack People Only Own \"Trauma, The N-word, and Braids\"\n\nKanye has been vocal for some time about his stance that Black people are “still slaves.”\n\nWhen speaking on Black people’s centuries of mistreatment, Ye suggested that as a community, it’s time to “dispel the trauma” and move forward. He then went on to say that he feels that “all Black people own are trauma, the word ni**a, and braids.” As Owens let out a chuckle, he added that Black people have discouraged other races from “getting braids” because of “appropriation.”\n\nYe then challenged his own community to have ownership in other areas with the rhetorical questions: “Where’s our land appropriation? Where’s our company appropriation? Where’s our brand appropriation?”\n\nHe also countered other races appropriating Black culture with, “But we’re the walking billboards for Louis Vuitton and Balenciaga.”\n\n'Black Panther' Movie Was Made To Erase The Black Panther Movement\n\nVaguely speaking on the late George Floyd, Ye gave the take that he was a “drug addict” and his death by police has some how made him into a hero like Dr. Martin Luther King. He then added that he felt “they” tried to do the same thing with the Black Panther movement by creating the Marvel superhero movie of the same name.\n\n“We’re gonna replace my dad, who was a real Black Panther, with the Disney version of Black Panthers?” he said. “And the fact that Virgil passed, no I don’t mean Virgil, I mean George passed, I don’t mean George, I mean Chad passed — now you can’t talk about Black Panther or you can’t point out that Black Panther was actually being used to erase my father’s legacy and what he fought for with the actual Black Panthers.”\n\nKanye’s father, Ray West, is a former Black Panther member and was one of the first Black photojournalists at The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nReveals He Was \"Drunk\" When He Wrote The DEFCON Tweet\n\nWhen asked of some about his anti-semitic comments he made, he admitted that his DEFCON tweet was made under the influence of Hennessy.\n\n“I was drinking when I put up the DEFCON tweet,” the 47-year-old said. “You wanna know what alcohol I had inside me? Hennessy. It turns us gray. The demons [come out].” When asked why he did not disclose that as he was being crucified for his remarks, he said he didn’t want his words “discredited” because he still considered them to be “truth.”\n\nThis wouldn’t be the first time Ye had an outburst while on Henny. Ye admitted that he was drinking the cognac when he interrupted Taylor Swift’s acceptance speech at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.\n\n“If I had to do it all over again, what would I have done? Would I have worn a leather shirt? Would I have drank half a bottle of Hennessy and gave the rest of it to the audience…?” he said while accepting the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at that time.\n\nThought Of Changing His Name To \"Christian Billionaire Ye\"\n\nDuring the interview, Ye claimed that he considered changing his name to “Christian Billionaire Ye.”\n\n“My name is Ye. I take it like you’re calling Caitlyn [Jenner] ‘Bruce.’ My name is Ye. Also, refer to me as ‘Billionaire.’ Christian Billionaire Ye,” he expressed. “Matter of fact, I may legally change my name to ‘Christian Billionaire Ye’, so you’re forced to call me it.”\n\nAccording to The Guardian, the Chicagoan legally changed his name to Ye in October 2021. A Los Angeles judge approved the name update, leaving him without a middle or last name. The petition was filed in August 2021 for “personal reasons.”\n\n“I believe ‘Ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you. So I’m you, I’m us, it’s us,” he explained the new name in 2018, when he first spoke of changing his birthname. He added that he “went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – just being a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.”"
