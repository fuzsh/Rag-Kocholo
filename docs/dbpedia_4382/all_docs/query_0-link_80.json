        "text": "How come it's always Martin vs Taylor and not Taylor vs gibson or martin vs gibson? It was the whole Martin vs Taylor hype that made me skip a lot of gibson acoustics. I did try some, but everytime I do it's gibson's with dead strings so I know I'm not hearing it's potential. I use to be hardcore taylor until I heard some martins with brand spanking new strings. Do Gibson's just have a certain lower end dogma abotuthem or something? From a recording artist point of view I personally like the sounds of guitars that come out of a gibson player's cd the best out of the three. unplugged I like Martin and plugged in live I like Taylor. so why is gibson being left out in the cold?\n\nMy take on this is Gibson has a long history of below average acoustics. I'd say right now Montana is turning out some very fine guitars. but their reputation proceeds them. In the mid '70's I bought a '58 J-200. Absolutely gorgeous guitar, fun to play, but it should have stayed a tree. The J-200 was very boomy, no articulation at all. I sold it and bought a D-35. Oh, so THAT was what I had been missing.\n\nMy point is, Gibson has made great and not so great guitars. They tend to be more heavily braced which kind of closes the sound up IMHO. Having said that, I've recently played some new Gibson acoustics that I would place along side anything Martin is making right now. To me, Gibson acoustics are not very consistent, but once you find the right one, wow.\n\nI think that the issue of QC with Gibson has been rather \"spotty\". A 1960's Hummingbird bares little resemblance to a new one......if any......... It is very difficult (at least for me) to find a new J-45 that resembles a vintage model (in build or tone). Yet these problems don't seem to affect a non mass producing company like Santa Cruz..............sorry..........getting OT......\n\nThe other issue, is the fact that both Martin & Taylor have designed models that are lower priced and that pretty much create a closer competition between comparible builds and various tone............ ...........meaning that if you prefer a darker or brighter tone..........desire a certain playability factor..........and finally............set a price point............Taylor vs. Martin can make an interesting debate between closer contenders...........\n\nI agree that Gibson has had some quality issues in the past...especially in the mid 70's Norlin era. But Martins from that time period weren't so great either (huge thick rosewood bridgeplates) Both companies seemed to learn from the mistakes by the 1980s and are making fine guitars today. Labor saving CNC routing technology allowed them to avoid grunt work and concentrate of cosmetics and tone. Nowdays I think Gibson hummingbirds, J-185s and J200's are awesome guitars with a character that make Taylors and Martins sound sterile. The jumbo maple Gibsons particularly beat out Taylors and Martins in my opinion for constistency and tone in side by side comparisons at most music stores I've been to. I have 2 early 90's J200's and they are absolute heaven for strumming and singing with alone with no electronics around.\n\nOriginally posted by guitarcapo\n\nI agree that Gibson has had some quality issues in the past...especially in the mid 70's Norlin era.

I in no way mean't to downplay a quality Gibson instrument..........just the ones that are over priced because of their headstock namesake............and the ones that don't live up (build & tone quality) to their predecessors.\n\nNo, I still look at them but when I stack the best of what the small builders have up against the best of the factory builders there is just no comparison. Now if the factory guitars really cost less and provide incredible value like the Larrivee. I find it hard to resist but my days of getting teary eyed over Gibson and Martin are over. I am finally free of that illusion. Not that they dont make a few great ones here and there but I can get the same exact model types except a much better guitar for the same ball park price or a little more.\n\nLarrivee is one of my exceptions simply because of the incredible value and what I see as great quality for the dollar. I would buy more Martins but the ones I end up liking usually cost as much as a hand made guitar so why bother and so few of them really strike me as truly wonderful. To me it's more about craftsmanship and attention to detail you get when hundreds of guitars are not squirted out per day or week.\n\nMy point is simply this. When you look at the forest dont just see 3 trees. Look at the whole forest. To have a conversation about 3 brands is almost equivalent to tunnel vision or blinders.\n\nI'm not sure how that ties in with communism\n\nOriginally posted by WilsonMak\n\nLittle brother. what do you mean you can get a handcraftred guitar for the price of a martin? The HD-28's I've seen are all in the 2.5K range while the goodall and collings and santa cruz's I've seen are in the 3K+\n\nCustom luthiers I've seen are all 4K+?\n\nThere's actually very little difference when you factor in everything. 500 bucks ? I'd simply say take every purchase and do your research. There are many hand built small builders with fantastic deals but you wont get them on Musicians Friend or at GC. You do have to research more but in the long run you actually save money because you are not buying and selling guitars graduating up through the ranks. You also may possibly get more guitar for the money and be happier. For example my SCGC was one of the nicest VS they make. It cost me about 500.00 more than the full MSRP of the Gibson I liked. It was one of the best decisions I ever made. It also cost alot less than buying a 4-5K vintage 1940/50s Gibson that I considered. And it sounds better for that matter.\n\nIt's a judgement call but all I am saying is do your research. SCGC sells the Prewar D and OM for as low as 2k and those things have won contests with Martins 3 times their price. The values are there but you do have to look harder.\n\nDont look at just the brands I favor. Look at as many as possible. One real eye opener is to visit a REAL guitar shop with some high end guitars. In a few years of doing that alot you will easily be able to hear the differences in the average new Martin and many other brands that are not THAT much more expensive. In some cases even just as cheap. The deals are out there.\n\nAs far as hand builders. Check out the hand made AJ Gibson style guitars at www.cbguitars.com . I think he makes a Gibson better than Gibson for about 2K. Now hows THAT for amazing?\n\nhttp://www.cbguitars.com/guitars.htm\n\nWilson look at this one !!!!!\n\nhttp://www.cbguitars.com/Special-Mahogany42.htm\n\n:)"
