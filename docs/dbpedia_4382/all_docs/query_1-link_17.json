The first is positive youth development in school and community settings. The second is community-engaged learning in higher education settings. I strive to conduct community-engaged and -based research (i.e., action research, community-based participatory research) that promotes social justice and equity.\n\nLINKS\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/taylor-martin95/"
