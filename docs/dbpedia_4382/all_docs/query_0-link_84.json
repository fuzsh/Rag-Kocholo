When I played the new standard D28, it was so much more responsive than the previous version, that I realized that the forward shifted braces had as much or maybe even more contribution to the ultra responsive and lively top, than scalloped braces have. The best of both worlds is obviously both forward shifted and scalloped, for the most responsive top. And, the HD35 is actually the liveliest of all because it has even lighter 1/4\" scalloped braces, rather than the 5/16\" ones on D28 models.\n\nI am in the minority but Gibsons are wonderful. It’s just a plain working guitar and doesn’t have the boutique image of a Martin or Taylor.\n\nI had a couple of really basic LG-0 parlor student guitars.\n\nI know this will piss off @DougMen lol\n\nNo, I like them, but like all acoustics, and maybe even more so than Martins, every piece of wood is different, and Gibsons are very inconsistent, so there are J200s, J45s, Hummingbirds, Doves, Songwriters, Southern Jumbos, and LG-0s that are magic, are there are also some that are real dogs. This is once again speaking from personal experience, and from playing dozens of Gibson acoustics at the store over my 15 years working there, and over all different models in their range. Taylors are the most consistent and Gibsons the least so, with Martin in-between the two, but the very best Taylors never approach the magic of a really really good Martin or Gibson, IMO.\n\nI find Taylor’s to be infinitely more playable than Martins - I’ve played a few Martins that are literally a battle between left hand and guitar. But nothing is more subjective than acoustic guitar preferences.\n\nMartin just ships their guitars with higher action, because if it's too high for a player's taste, it's very simple to lower the saddle a bit by sanding down the bottom. If the saddle is too low for your taste, then you have to put a whole new saddle in. But, also, in relation to your comment, Taylor makes their guitars for electric players, while Martin makes theirs for acoustic players who aren't afraid to build up their strength to get the best sound AND playability from their guitar. On an acoustic, as on a Strat or Tele, the best tone is achieved with a bit higher action and a more aggressive attack, rather than the ultra low action and feather light touch used on a LP or shred style guitar."
