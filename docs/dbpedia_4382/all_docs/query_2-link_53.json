        "text": "TULSA, Okla. – Razorback All-American and rising sophomore Maria Jose Marin was medalist after two rounds of stroke play at the 124th USGA U.S. Women’s Amateur, played at Tulsa’s historic Southern Hills Country Club. Marin was one of four Razorbacks to advance to match play, which starts Wednesday with the Round of 64.\n\nMarin fired rounds of 69-69 for a 4-under-par total of 138. She was the only golfer to shoot in the 60’s each round and was one shot better than second place – Melanie Green (70-69=139).\n\nIn addition to Marin, Kendall Todd, Reagan Zibilski and Cory Lopez made the cut to compete in the match play.\n\nTodd and Zinbilski each fired a 71 on Tuesday. Todd climbed 18 spots and tied for 16th (74-71+145 / +3) while Zibilski rocketed 32 spots up the leaderboard to tie for 20th (75-71=146 / +4). Lopez posted back-to-back rounds of 75 and tied for 45th.\n\nOverall, Arkansas had six current athletes qualify, tying Texas for most among any programs. Incoming freshman Natalie Blonien tied for 75th (78-74=152) and rising sophomore Abbey Schutte tied for 145th (80-83=163).\n\nTwelve of the top 25 players in the World Amateur Golf Ranking/WAGR® who entered the week survived the cut. A 13th player ranked among the top 25, Amanda Sambach, is one of 20 players in a playoff for the remaining 10 spots in match play.\n\nMarin, currently ranked No. 15 in the WAGR, will take the No. 1 seed into the Round of 64, which begins Wednesday at 8:30 a.m. CDT. Two years ago in Bowling Green, Ky., Marin made it to the semifinals of the 2022 U.S. Girls’ Junior.\n\n“It feels incredible,” said Marin, of earning medalist honors. “Pins were as hard as yesterday, and we had to be strategic in our positions. Putts had to be on point, and we had to be very careful with some shots. I think I did that with my dad [on the bag]. He knows me, he’s my coach and we get along pretty good, so I think we made the right decisions to score well.”\n\n“It’s a really good golf course for match play,” said Marin. “You have to be very smart with your decisions. If you have the right yardage and a good pin, you can make lots and lots of birdies, so it’ll be interesting tomorrow.”\n\nThe Round of 64 will begin at 8:30 am (CT). GOLF Channel will broadcast live from 2-5 pm (CT).\n\nMORE INFORMATION\n\nKeep up with all of the latest news and information and get behind the scenes looks into our program on our social media accounts.
