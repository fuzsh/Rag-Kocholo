        "text": "Taylor Swift has seen this film before... and she didn't like the ending.\n\nKanye West has once again created controversy between himself and Swift after releasing new song lyrics mentioning the 14-time Grammy winner and her boyfriend, Travis Kelce.\n\nThe lyrics were a triggering reminder of Kanye's 2016 song \"Famous,\" in which he sings, \"I feel like me and Taylor might still have s-- / I made that b----- famous.\"\n\nAt the time, Taylor was never aware that he called her a \"b----,' however, his then-wife, Kim Kardashian, released edited audio from their conversation making it seem like the \"Enchanted\" performer approved of the lyric.\n\nTaylor and the \"Heartless\" hitmaker's feud dates back to 2009 when Kanye jumped on stage at the MTV Video Music Awards and interrupted the \"Shake It Off\" singer's acceptance speech for Best Female Video.\n\nKanye grabbed the microphone and insisted Beyoncé should have won the award instead.\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for the OK! newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what OK! has to offer. It’s gossip too good to wait for!\n\n\"You have a fully manufactured frame job, in an illegally recorded phone call, which Kim Kardashian edited and then put out to say to everyone that I was a liar,\" Taylor recalled, fully calling out the SKIMS co-founder by name. \"That took me down psychologically to a place I’ve never been before.\"\n\nAs a result of the immense hate the pop star faced, Taylor \"moved to a foreign country\" and \"didn’t leave a rental house for a year.\"\n\n\"I was afraid to get on phone calls. I pushed away most people in my life because I didn’t trust anyone anymore. I went down really, really hard,\" she admitted. \"I thought that moment of backlash was going to define me negatively for the rest of my life.\"\n\nTaylor has since gained back her spark and remains one of the most famous and powerful women in the world."
