A polarizing figure because of her combative style and controversial views, Greene first drew national attention when running for Congress because she had promoted QAnon conspiracy theories on social media. By positioning herself as a prominent voice of the Make America Great Again (MAGA) political movement, a coalition of right-wing populists that coalesced during the presidency of Donald Trump (2017–21), she gained the attention of prominent Republican leaders.\n\nEarly life\n\nMarjorie Taylor was the first child of Robert (“Bob”) Taylor and Carrie Fidelle (“Delle”) Bacon. Bob Taylor, a Michigander from a blue-collar family, had moved to Georgia a few years earlier and opened a construction company. Delle Bacon was from Milledgeville, a small town southeast of Atlanta that served as Georgia’s state capital until Reconstruction. Her mother, Marjorie Bacon, was Taylor’s namesake.\n\nTaylor grew up in the northeastern suburbs of Atlanta. She was a typical neighbourhood kid and was well liked by those who knew her at South Forsyth High School. She never showed signs of interest in political leadership, nor did she seem to have any particularly grand aspirations. She was engaged in her father’s local business, working for the company while in high school.\n\nPersonal life\n\nTaylor studied business administration at the University of Georgia. She met her husband-to-be, Perry Greene, while studying. The couple married in 1995 and Taylor appended her husband’s surname to her maiden name. She earned her bachelor’s degree in 1996, and the couple went on to help manage the Taylor family business. They started a family of their own in 1998 with the birth of the first of their three children.\n\nIn 2006 Perry Greene took over leadership of the company. Marjorie Taylor Greene was listed as its chief financial officer from 2007 to 2011. She became active in CrossFit in 2011 and made it an important component of her lifestyle for several years. Along with a partner she opened a commercial gym in 2013. She later sold her stake in 2016.\n\nGreene filed for divorce in 2012, after she allegedly had affairs with two men that she had met while doing CrossFit. The couple reconciled, but Perry filed for divorce 10 years later, stating that the marriage had been “irretrievably broken.” The divorce was finalized in December 2022.\n\nOnline political activity and engagement with QAnon\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nUntil 2016 Greene was largely inactive when it came to politics. She did not vote in the 2012 presidential election or the 2014 midterm elections. But when Trump hit the campaign trail for the 2016 presidential race, she found him refreshingly down-to-earth. “He was someone I could relate to…And I thought, ‘finally, maybe this is someone who will do something about the things that deeply bother me.’” She still did not make it out to the polls that year. But in a sign that she was beginning to feel that she could make a difference, she made a onetime donation to Trump’s campaign in October 2016.\n\nIn the months leading up to the election, U.S. intelligence agencies began looking into attempts by the Russian government to meddle in the election, including cyberattacks against the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and a computer network that was being used by Hillary Clinton’s campaign. While assessments made public before the November election denied any connection between Russian activities and the Trump campaign, the intelligence community concluded in December that Russia had intended to benefit Trump’s bid for president.\n\nThe controversy was intriguing and animating for Greene. As allegations of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign surfaced in the months that followed, she sought to understand the debate. She did not feel she could get reliable information by listening to CNN or the Fox News Channel, so she tried to find information on her own. “What I did was I started looking up things on the Internet, asking questions, like most people do every day, use Google.” Like many Americans at that time, she looked for answers but found narratives that confirmed some of her preconceived notions. QAnon caught her attention, helping construct a false reality for her that was reinforced by her interactions on social media platforms. When in 2021 she publicly disavowed some of the conspiracy theories that she had once espoused, she conceded that she had fallen for them simply by exploring them and engaging with them.\n\nGreene’s participation in these online communities spurred her turn to political activism, primarily by means of commentary. In 2017 she began contributing to a Web blog, AmericanTruthSeekers.com. The website identified itself as “Your place to find the truth of your world”—even while its alarmist headlines kept readers abreast of all the latest scandals of a supposed Clinton-led cabal. She wrote lengthy posts on her social media accounts that lacked logic or structure; perhaps the most infamous of these was a 2018 essay that suggested that recent wildfires had been caused by space lasers owned by the Rothschild family. Between 2017 and 2019 she posted videos to Facebook that contained incendiary statements, including her assertion that Black Americans are “held slaves to the Democratic Party,” and conspiracy theories, including that the September 11 attacks were an inside job.\n\nRun for U.S. Congress\n\nIn March 2019 the Senate held hearings on gun control. Greene traveled to Washington, D.C., to have her say as a private gun owner. Armed with her camera, she found herself routinely ignored on Capitol Hill, including by Republican legislators and staffers. Meanwhile, she noticed that lawmakers were meeting with David Hogg, one of the student survivors of a high-school shooting that took place a year earlier and who had become a recognizable advocate for gun control. In one video she follows Hogg and ridicules him, accusing him of using children to take away her Second Amendment rights.\n\nIf Greene was not going to be heard in Congress as a citizen, then she was determined to have her say as a member. In May she filed to run in the Republican primaries in Georgia’s 6th congressional district, where she had been living. But that district was volatile in the highly competitive election cycle of 2020, and Republicans were eager to avoid a messy primary. Members of the House Freedom Caucus reportedly pushed Greene to run instead in Georgia’s 14th congressional district, a heavily conservative district whose representative was not seeking reelection; she agreed to switch. During her campaign for the 14th district, she garnered national attention for her endorsement of QAnon and her controversial posts on social media, leading many Republican figures to condemn her statements and to back her primary opponent. She won the primary election and was unopposed in the general election when her Democratic opponent moved out of state. Although she had not previously lived in the district, many of its residents liked her staunchly held values and firebrand approach. They also appreciated her willingness to defy the Republican establishment.\n\nFirst year in Congress\n\nGreene appeared for her swearing-in on January 3, 2021, wearing a black face mask with the words “TRUMP WON” emblazoned across the front. She was one of the many Trump supporters who contended that the election had gone in Trump’s favour, even though the results showed a clear victory for Joe Biden in both the electoral college and the popular vote. Three days later a mob stormed the U.S. Capitol, seeking to interfere with the certification of the electoral college votes. Hours later, after the Capitol had been secured, Greene joined more than a hundred fellow Republicans in formally challenging the results of the election. She objected to the votes submitted by Michigan, which was one of the states that Trump had carried in 2016 but not in 2020. Her objection was dismissed, however, because it lacked the required backing of any U.S. Senator.\n\nIn her first months in Congress, Greene did little to make friends. She was often combative with her fellow legislators, Republican and Democrat alike. She found herself shut out from much of congressional business, similar to when she had visited the Capitol in 2019. But this time she could obstruct legislation—whether because it was just one of the few waves she could make or because she wanted to hold lawmakers accountable for even the most mundane of the legislature’s measures. She objected to one voice vote after another, not only derailing some bills from moving forward but also forcing her colleagues in both parties to record their positions and open their votes up for scrutiny.\n\nMeanwhile, she proved to be a force to be reckoned with. Unencumbered by committee assignments, she made appearances at rallies and conferences, where her claims of a stolen election helped bolster her appeal as a populist. By April Greene had raised millions of dollars in political donations from individual donors. At the end of the year, only 3 of the 212 Republican members of the House had surpassed her in fundraising—even though she did not receive funds from corporate donors.\n\nIn January 2022 Twitter permanently suspended Greene’s personal account after it issued repeated warnings to her about using the platform to spread misinformation. The offending tweets included false claims about the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the vaccination campaign, including a tweet that alleged that the vaccines “do not reduce the spread of the virus” and another that charged that the vaccine had caused “extremely high amounts” of deaths. In November the account was among those reinstated by Elon Musk, along with Trump’s account, after Musk had bought out the company in October. Greene’s congressional account remained active and unaffected throughout the period of her suspension.\n\nThe Voice of MAGA in Congress\n\nThat during her first term Greene represented a powerful segment of the Republican base was not lost on Kevin McCarthy, then the minority leader of the House. He began meeting with her regularly. He also invited her to policy meetings so that he could hear her take on important matters. Whether he agreed with her position on the issues, he understood that many voters (and donors) across the country shared her perspective.\n\nIn the 2022 midterm elections Greene was reelected in a landslide, while Republicans won control of the House by just a narrow margin. Her position in Congress was safely assured, but McCarthy’s leadership was not. He needed the support of Greene and other far-right colleagues whom she could muster. Aware of her importance to McCarthy, she threw her support behind him as Speaker of the House, abandoning efforts by other populists to deny him the speakership, which he eventually won. Days later, he awarded her seats on the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability and the House Committee on Homeland Security.\n\nThe Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica"
