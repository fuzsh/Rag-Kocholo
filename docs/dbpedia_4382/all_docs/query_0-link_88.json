        "text": "Research in a Nutshell\n\nWe study why mutations occur where they do and what effect they have when they arise. Genetic mutations are important, they are responsible for inherited disease, drive the development of cancer, allow bacteria and viruses to escape our drugs and immune system, and provide the raw material for evolution. Most of our research spans our three core aims:\n\n1. Understanding mutational processes. What processes go wrong in our cells to create mutations and how damage to our DNA contributes to this. We are especially interested in the mutations that get inherited from one generation to the next, and those that drive the progression to cancer.\n\n2. Interpreting genetic variation. Revealing which mutations have an important biological effect and which are less important. This helps genetic diagnosis and matching the cancer treatment to the patient. We are increasingly realising that combinations of mutations are important for how cells grow and the development of cancer."
