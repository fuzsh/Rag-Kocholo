        "text": "If shades of Bart Simpson abound in such a story, it's nothing on East Coast Chicken Supper, Taylor's debut play for the Traverse Theatre.\n\nAn everyday tale of small-town drug dealing among friends in low places, East Coast Chicken Supper is full of people opening their big mouths, saying too much and not knowing when to hold back.\n\nIn a way, the machine-gun exchanges between the gang of mates holed up in a cottage on the edge of a housing estate are an extension of Taylor's own unguarded patter. For a guy not long back in town after spending 17 years in London, there may also be an element of his own prodigal's return riding through the play.\n\n\"I wanted to write something about someone coming back, \" Taylor says. \"That was before I'd even got the story. I loved Pinter's The Homecoming and Buried Child by Sam Shepard, and I wanted to get that sense of return.\n\nEspecially in Scotland, because Scotland's a great place, but it always has this problem about selfimage. It's not like Ireland, which has this sort of Celtic confidence.\n\nPeople leave here all the time.\n\nTalent leaves here and eventually you hope they'll come back.\"\n\nIf Taylor's instinctive sense of national pride inadvertently sounds like it could be an ad for VisitScotland, chances are its sub-Trainspotting content and wise-guy amorality won't get tourist board approval just yet. Its depiction of a black market entrepreneurial spirit ref lects a recent study of \"feral\" youths who, as in the play, deal drugs as a means to an end. Armed with knives and guns, it's the money in their pocket that matters and they'll do anything to put it there.\n\nIn another life, with better education and career opportunities, they might just have ended up running the world.\n\n\"These guys are very intelligent, \" he points out. \"They just happen to sell drugs. I grew up in an environment were some people take drugs and some people sell them. It's just the world we're living in and is no big deal. If these guys had grown up in a different sort of environment they might have been high-fliers in the city or something, but these choices aren't open to them. It's not like America, where class doesn't really matter and where there are scholarships for everyone. In this country you're not really encouraged to do well. The infrastructure isn't there to achieve.\"\n\nEast Coast Chicken Supper isn't some worthy issue-based drugs play. Rather, you get the impression that the dealing is used as a contemporary framing device for an old-fashioned tale of greed. Where David Mamet used real estate in Glengarry Glen Ross, Taylor has used bags of white powder.\n\n\"If anything, \" he points out, \"drug taking's pretty passe now.\n\nIt's so commonplace, we all pretty much know someone who can get something. There's so many people who smoke weed or like a sniff of cocaine that it's not a big deal any more. Having said that, if people stopped taking cocaine, places like London would fall apart.\"\n\nAh, London. You get the impression Taylor had something of a love/hate relationship with the place, even before he moved back up north. Taylor trained as an actor there at The Drama Centre but, rather than square up to the looming treadmill of auditions and casting calls, ended up working for the council.\n\n\"No disrespect to anyone in the acting profession, \" he says now, \"but getting a walk-on part in The Bill was never going to satisfy my creative juices.\"As for the city itself, \"I need some kind of view and I'm sorry but the River Thames doesn't cut it for me. I can't see no tide there. There's no salty smell. London's like a facsimile in that way. A facsimile of the sea. That's not the quality of life I wanted.\"\n\nGiven both East Coast Chicken Supper's Fife locale and its gritty realist subject matter, Taylor's play is likely to face inevitable comparisons with Gagarin Way, Gregory Burke's similarly styled postTarantino meditation on money, violence and the impotence of political systems. If it's cut from the same cloth, however, it's more a generational thing over opportunistic bandwagon jumping.\n\n\"The only similarity, \" according to Taylor, \"is that all my characters are working-class. Just because one guy from Fife wrote a play it doesn't mean that no-one else from Fife can. If people want to lump them together as some kind of movement then it's to their detriment.\"\n\nTaylor is, however, steeped in the high-octane language of postmodern film culture. As well as Mamet, Pinter and Shepard, he cites Ingmar Bergman and German auteur RainerWerner Fassbinder as influences. Television, too, seeps into East Coast Chicken Supper.\n\nAmerican television, that is.\n\n\"There's something sexy about American cop shows, \" according to Taylor. \"They all carry guns, but they talk brilliantly as well. One thing you can say about The Bill is it certainly ain't sexy.\"\n\nThere's something of this selfconscious sexiness in Taylor's work too. It's something about the way young men like to play at being tough guys. Taylor recognises this in himself and, judging by his attire of summer festival beanie hat and sky-blue T-shirt that suggests he fought the early 1990s Madchester wars, you can guess the sort of gang he hangs out with.\n\n\"I know a lot of cool people, \" he laughs. \"I'm lucky like that. All my mates are the coolest people on the planet. They've got swagger.\n\nThey're comfortable in themselves, even though they're all playing a part. We're all playing a part in some way.\"\n\nWhat part then, is Taylor playing today?\n\n\"Sometimes, \" he ruminates, \"I'm playing the guy who likes to pretend he's stupid. Then again, sometimes I actually am stupid, \" he says, his big mouth striking again.\n\nEast Coast Chicken Supper is at the Tron Theatre, Glasgow, this Friday and Saturday; Traverse Theatre, Edinburgh, August 2-28."
