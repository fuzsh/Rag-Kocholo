        "text": "Dude, you've just asked the acoustic equivalent of \"What are the best pickups?\" or \"What's the best amp?\" The unanswerable question! The thread we all love to hate!\n\nThe short answer is, it depends. Go play a bunch and see what you like.\n\nThe long answer:\n\nMartins are what people think of when they think of acoustic guitars. These are old-fashioned, high-quality, traditional sounding acoustic guitars, the guitar upon which just about every other guitar is patterned. They have a rich and bassy tone and are designed to be loud and proud. Plenty of people have rocked out and played the blues on Martins, but they are equally at home in country, bluegrass, folk...any music that doesn't demand a gut-strung classical guitar or a muted jazz archtop.\n\nGibsons are also high-quality acoustic guitars. They generally have a dryer and woodier tone than a Martin, so they're favored by songwriters or people who want to sing easily over the guitar. They're less traditional with more bling, but they're not nontraditional. This is the rock-and-rollingest of the guitar brands you mentioned. They are also, in my opinion, overpriced. Imagine that...an overpriced Gibson.\n\nTaylors are the newest to the scene, having only been around a few decades. Taylors are known for a brighter tone than Martins or Gibsons. They have traditional styling but are nontraditional in their bracing, construction and tone woods, which gives them a unique sound. Taylors are known for excellent playability, and for having a bolt-on neck. The bolt-on neck, as you may have heard on a strat forum somewhere, makes future neck resets or adjustments very easy, as opposed to the traditional glued-in dovetail neck, which requires some disassembly of the guitar to reset the neck after 20 years. To me, Taylors are the best value for the money. They are stereotyped as \"church guitars\" but Dave Matthews, Zac Brown and Jason Mraz all play Taylors.\n\nAll are high-quality, professional-grade, made in the USA guitars when you get past the beginner models, like the laminate Martins or the Taylor 100 and 200 series. (And those don't exactly suck.)\n\nBut there are a LOT of other great acoustics out there. You can go high-end with a Santa Cruz, Froggy Bottom, Collings, Huss & Dalton or similar \"boutique\" brand. Seagulls/Godin-family guitars are high quality, made-in-Canada, super-affordable guitars. People love Guilds--now made in the USA at their own factory since Fender sold them off. A Guild USA 12-string is THE gold standard for 12-strings. Takamine has a huge following, especially for gigging. The big three from China--Eastman, Blueridge, and Recording King--all make high-quality guitars for reasonable prices (Eastman being considered the best of the three). Ovation is made in the USA again after a brief shutdown--again, huge for gigging. Yamaha--how did I forget Yamaha? The Honda or Toyota of guitars--high-quality, reliable, affordable, reasonably stylish. Breedlove, Bedell, PRS, Gretsch, Ibanez. Raingsong and Blackbird carbon-fiber guitars. Fender makes a lot of acoustics. They aren't well-regarded but I think some of their higher-end stuff is supposed to be nice.\n\nWith so many choices, it's best to go back to the short answer.\n\nI was in kind of a similar situation almost a 2 years ago. In my case I had tried a lot of Gibson and had totally fallen in love with both the sound and feel of the Emmylou Harris L200 from Gibson.\n\nThat thing had me lingering on every note. I had made it clear for the shop that I want that guitar. Don't let anyone with dirty fingers touch that beauty!\n\nI went to a jam at a pub and played like I have never played before by then. Then this girl comes on stage with her Martin and has us mesmerised for 45 minutes .\n\nI went up to compliment her and say how amazing she played, we sat down had a long conversation and went into guitars suddenly. She said this is my dad's old D28.\n\nAnd I say what the hell is a D28? She lent me the guitar and I played with it. I was blowed away. It had such a beautiful midrange, the kind that a acoustic guitar only gets when it's played for years and years.\n\nI went home and scratch down everything and started over. It took me to months to dare myself into the guitar shop. And I went and the guy laughs and says \"Don't worry I didn't let any dirty fingers touch your guitar\"\n\nI don't want that I said. I want to try that D28 you have hanging there. I went into a practice room and honestly I spent over 3 hours straight there.\n\nI came out and payed for it. But still to this day I find that emmylou Harris L200 was just as good as the D28, but it lacked the nice glimmering midrange.\n\nYou know when take one note, just one note and find it sound amazing, I felt that for every note on that guitar full of sweet spots.\n\nI will without a doubt buy the Emmylou Harris L200 someday. I loved that guitar too.\n\nI really honestly think the only guitar out Gibson range the Emmylou Harris L200 that can match a Martin D28.\n\nNot a hummingbird.\n\nSorry for the long story I couldn't help myself."
