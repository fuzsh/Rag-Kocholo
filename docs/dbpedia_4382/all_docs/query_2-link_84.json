        "text": "Taylor and Martin are two of the most popular and frequently compared acoustic guitar brands. If you’re looking for an exceptional quality acoustic guitar, then you can’t go wrong with either. But how do you know which is the best brand for you?\n\nIn this article, I’ll compare the tone and playability of Martin and Taylor acoustic guitars as well as break-down the ranges so you can see which models are most suitable for you.\n\nTaylor vs Martin\n\nMartin acoustic guitars have a warmer tone with more bass and lower-mids than Taylor guitars which have a brighter and more modern tone with more treble and upper-mids. In general, Taylor guitars allow you to adjust the action more easily due to their adjustable necks, unlike Martin guitars.\n\nBrand Overview\n\nBefore we jump into the comparisons, let’s go through a quick overview of each brand and the shapes available so you can see what kinds of acoustic guitars are comparable.\n\nTaylor\n\nTaylor make acoustic guitars in several shapes:\n\nGrand Concert: small body\n\nBaby: 3/4 size dreadnought\n\nGrand Auditorium: mid-sized guitar\n\nBig Baby: 15/16 size dreadnought\n\nDreadnought\n\nGrand Pacific: round shoulder dreadnought\n\nGrand Theatre: scaled-down version of the Grand Orchestra\n\nGrand Symphony: larger than a Grand Auditorium with a soundport cutaway\n\nGrand Orchestra: super jumbo style\n\nJumbo: only available for custom orders currently\n\nHere are some images (all link to Amazon) to show the different shapes.\n\nTaylor use 3 digit naming system to identify each model:\n\n1st Digit: the series. Models in the same series have the same back and side wood.\n\n2nd Digit: string number and top wood hardness. 1 = 6 string with soft top wood e.g. spruce, 2 = 6 string with hard top wood, 5 = 12 string with soft top wood, 6 = 12 string with hard top wood.\n\n3rd Digit: body shape. 0 = dreadnought, 2 = grand concert, 4 = grand auditorium, 6 = grand symphony, 7 = grand pacific, 8 = grand orchestra.\n\nSome models also have 1 or 2 letters after them. An “E” indicates that it’s an acoustic-electric model and a “C” indicates that it has a cutaway.\n\nMartin\n\nMartin make several acoustic guitar shapes which are all coded:\n\n0\n\n00\n\n000 (Auditorium)\n\nOM (Orchestra)\n\nGP (Grand Performance)\n\nM (Grand Auditorium)\n\nD (Dreadnought)\n\nJ (Jumbo)\n\nThe acoustic-electric versions all have an “E” at the end of the product name.\n\nHere are images (all link to Amazon) of some of the different Martin shapes.\n\nComparable Shapes\n\nHere is a list of comparable acoustic guitar shapes from Taylor and Martin, since they all use different naming systems.\n\nSmall body: Taylor Grand Concert and Martin 0/ 00 shapes\n\nMid-Sized: Taylor Grand Auditorium and Martin 000/ OM/GP shapes\n\nDreadnought: Taylor Dreadnought/ Big Baby/ Grand Pacific and Martin Dreadnough (D) shapes\n\nLarge-Body: Taylor Grand Orchestra/ Grand Symphony and Martin Jumbo shapes\n\nCheck out my in-depth comparison between the Taylor GS Mini and Martin Little Martin.\n\nTone Comparison\n\nMartin acoustic guitars typically have a classic sound with more emphasis on the bass and lower-mids giving them a warmer and fuller tone compared to Taylor guitars which have more emphasis on the treble and upper-mids giving them a more modern tone with increased clarity.\n\nIt’s important to note that these generalisations can get thrown out of the window depending on which models are being compared. The tone of an acoustic guitar varies depending on the shape, tone wood and bracing pattern used and each guitar in the range will sound different.\n\nMost modern Taylor guitars use V-class bracing resulting in a brighter tone, whereas Martin guitars typically use X-class bracing which sounds warmer and fuller.\n\nCheck out my comparison between X and V-Class bracing to learn about the differences.\n\nHere are some YouTube comparisons of similar Taylor and Martin models so you can listen to the difference. It’s really best to try the models in your price range out in person in the store so you can listen to the differences and decide which one sounds best to you.\n\nComparison #1 Taylor Builder’s Edition 717 vs Martin HD-28\n\nComparison #2 Taylor 314 vs Martin 00-18\n\nTaylor 214ce Deluxe vs Martin GPC-13e\n\nComfort and Playability\n\nTaylor acoustic guitars are generally easier and more forgiving than Martin acoustic guitars. Taylor acoustic guitars allow you to adjust the neck angle to get the ideal action whereas Martin guitars have a set neck so you cannot adjust the action. Taylor guitars typically have a smaller fretboard radius.\n\nPlayability and comfort is very subjective though, and both brands make guitars with different neck profiles and shapes to suit different players. It’s always recommended to try different models in a guitar store to know what feels best to you.\n\nCountry of Manufacture\n\nTaylor and Martin both produce their guitars in Mexico and the USA. Taylor make their more affordable guitars in Mexico which range between $500 and $1500. Their more premium guitars typically start at $1300 and are made in the USA.\n\nMartin make most models under $1300 in Mexico and most models over $1500 in the USA. This means that similarly priced guitars from both brands are highly likely to be made in the same country.\n\nCheck out these guides to learn more:\n\nWhere are Martin guitars made?\n\nWhere are Taylor guitars made?\n\nRange Comparison\n\nNow we’ve been through some comparisons, I wanted to put together some tables so you can find comparable models from Taylor and Martin easily and quickly. The tables below are split into different body shapes and are all ordered from the lowest to the highest price (at the time of writing).\n\nThe tables are very large because they contain pretty much every model available from Taylor and Martin at the time of writing but try not to get overwhelmed by looking at every entry! The tables are just here so you can pick out models that have suitable specifications in your price range so you can compare them further.\n\nCategories:\n\nSmall Body\n\nMid-Sized\n\nAcoustic\n\nLarge Body\n\nSmall Body\n\nTaylor Grand Concert and Martin 0/ 00 shapes\n\nMid-Size\n\nTaylor Grand Auditorium and Martin 000/ OM/GP shapes\n\nDreadnought\n\nTaylor Dreadnought/ Big Baby/ Grand Pacific and Martin Dreadnough (D) shapes\n\nLarge Body\n\nTaylor Grand Orchestra/ Grand Symphony and Martin Jumbo shapes\n\nWhich Acoustic Guitar is Best for You?\n\nThis brings us to the ultimate question, should you get a Martin or a Taylor? My best advice is to use the tables above to identify which models are in your price range and then try them in the store. This will allow you to figure out which feels and sounds the best to you.\n\nIf you can, try and do a blind tone-test by asking a friend to play the guitars with your back to them, so you can remove an preconceived notions and decide once and for all, which sounds best to you.\n\nHere are some key points to finish up this article with:\n\nTaylor guitars have a more modern and brighter tone.\n\nMartin guitars have a warmer and fuller tone.\n\nTaylor guitars allow you to fine-tune the action more than Martin guitars.\n\nTaylor guitars typically have a smaller fretboard radius than Martin guitars.\n\nMartin guitars typically start at a lower price than Taylor guitars and better cater the under $1000 bracket.\n\nTaylor cater for the large-body (e.g. Jumbo) and small-body market more than Martin.\n\nMartin are better known for their dreadnought range compared to Taylor.\n\nHere are some more articles you might find useful:"
