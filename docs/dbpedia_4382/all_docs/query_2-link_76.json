        "text": "Steve Martin said he rejected Lorne Michaels' offer to play Tim Walz on \"Saturday Night Live.\"\n\nStand-up comedian Jim Gaffigan is a popular pick to play Kamala Harris' running mate on \"SNL.\"\n\nFans also suggested Jim O'Heir, Al Franken, Danny DeVito, and Rick Moranis as options.\n\nSteve Martin knows that fans wanted him to play Tim Walz on \"Saturday Night Live,\" but he's already turned down the job.\n\n\"I wanted to say no and, by the way, he wanted me to say no,\" Martin told The Los Angeles Times, referring to a conversation with \"SNL\" creator and producer Lorne Michaels. \"I said, 'Lorne, I'm not an impressionist. You need someone who can really nail the guy.' I was picked because I have gray hair and glasses.\"\n\nMartin said that Michaels called him on Wednesday with an offer to portray Walz on the long-running sketch comedy series. Aside from saying that he's \"not an impressionist,\" Martin also pointed to the time commitment as a drawback.\n\n\"It's ongoing,\" he said. \"It's not like you do it once and get applause and never do it again. Again, they need a real impressionist to do that. They're gonna find somebody really, really good. I'd be struggling.\"\n\nWalz was announced on Tuesday as Kamala Harris' vice presidential running mate for the 2024 US presidential election. The election will provide plenty of fodder for \"SNL,\" which returns for season 50 on September 28. Maya Rudolph is reportedly set to return as Harris.\n\nSince Walz was selected as Harris' running mate, the internet has been having a field day sharing their opinions on who should play him on the show. Martin was perhaps the most popular choice, but in light of his turning down the role, here are other actors who fans think could do the role justice.\n\nStand-up comedian and actor Jim Gaffigan is a frontrunner\n\n\"Why does everyone want Steve Martin to play Tim Walz on SNL when @JimGaffigan is right there?\" one person wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter).\n\n'Parks and Recreation' star Jim O'Heir is a strong contender\n\n\"Congrats to Jim O'Heir on what I imagine will be a very busy autumn, specifically on Saturday nights,\" one person wrote on X, adding photos of O'Heir and Walz for comparison.\n\nO'Heir responded to being a contender by writing on X that he doesn't \"mind being in the mix.\"\n\nDanny DeVito is another pick\n\nFormer US senator and 'SNL' alum Al Franken is another name that's been suggested\n\nMany fans think 'Ghostbusters' star Rick Moranis should play Walz\n\n\"And everyone saying Steve Martin is the \"must play Tim Walz\" on SNL, I raise you... Rick Moranis,\" a fan wrote on X.\n\n\"He won't do it but if SNL could get Rick Moranis to play Tim Walzâ€¦the internet would break,\" another person said.\n\nPeople think John Goodman could embody Walz's demeanor\n\n\"I keep saying John Goodman. He gets the enthusiasm down,\" one person said on X.\n\n\"John Goodman is right there,\" another fan said.\n\nActor and comedian Richard Kind has also been suggested\n\n\"Steve Martin turned down SNL when asked to play Tim Walz so I'm officially starting a DRAFT RICHARD KIND movement,\" a fan wrote on X."
