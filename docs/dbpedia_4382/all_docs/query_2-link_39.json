Kuehn, seeded 32nd after stroke play, won her opening match 7&5. She is ranked eighth in WAGR and was a four-time All-American at Wake Forest.\n\nTodd will face Gabby Woods in the Round of 32.\n\nThursday’s action will include the Rounds of 32 and 16. Once again, GOLF Channel will provide live coverage from 2-5 pm (CT).\n\nMarin defeated Leigha Devine, 6&5. In fact, Marin only lost one hole, the par-3, 8th, to cruise to the win. The Razorback All-American took an early 3-up lead by winning holes 2, 3 and 5. After Devine won the 8th hole, Marin bounced back by winning holes 9, 11, 12 and 13 to take the commanding 6-up lead with just five holes to play.\n\nTodd, a rising senior with the Razorbacks, took down Lauren Calderon, 4&3, in the opening Round of 64.
