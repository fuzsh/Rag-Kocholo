        "text": "My main research interests concern the evolution, ecology and conservation of marine and freshwater fishes. My research has a particular emphasis on using molecular methods to elucidate ecological and evolutionary processes including classical tools such as microsatellite markers and Sanger sequencing, coupled with next-generation sequencing. My evolutionary interests include polyploidy, speciation and mimicry particularly in Neotropical Corydoras catfishes. My more applied interests include fisheries induced evolution using the guppy as a model system, population structure and traceability of marine and freshwater fishes using SNP markers, predator/prey relationships using DNA based methods and conservation genetics of UK freshwater fishes.\n\nLab website: http://www.uea.ac.uk/~b141/index.html\n\nThe origins and implications of polyploidy in Corydoras catfishes\n\nTraceability of marine fish and fish products\n\nPopulation and conservation genetics of freshwater and marine fishes.\n\nExperimental study of fisheries induced evolution using the guppy as a model system.\n\nPhD Positions\n\nClick here for current PhD opportunities in Biological Sciences. But feel free to email me to discuss projects outside these areas and alternative sources of funding.\n\nPostdocs & Fellows\n\nI am always happy to discuss possibilities for postdoctoral work and collaborations. Possible funding routes include EU Marie Curie fellowships, Brazilian Science without borders opportunities etc."
