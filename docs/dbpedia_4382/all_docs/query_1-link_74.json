        "text": "A scabrously funny look at âyoung enterpriseâ in modern Scotland.\n\nIn a small Fife town, somethingâs cooking at the cottage at the end of the estate. Gibbyâs back from London and heâs got some explaining to do. AWOL for over a year from the drug-dealing business set up by him and his childhood friends Fred and Stew, Gibby has no idea what heâs been missing out on. With the whisky in, the drugs out and the chicken stir-fry on, what started as a fraught reunion may end up a final fling.\n\nMartin J. Taylorâs play East Coast Chicken Supper was first staged at the Traverse Theatre, Edinburgh, in 2005. It won an Edinburgh Fringe First Award.\n\nâSharp characterisation, snappy, sassy dialogue and a nice unpredictabilityâ\n\n- The Times\n\nâMassively promising. Whatâs striking is the sheer energy and inventiveness with which Taylor spins out his variations on this single comic idea. Taylorâs early dialogue blazes with talent and potentialâ\n\n- Scotsman\n\nâExceedingly well-observed - disturbingly honestâ\n\n- Evening News\n\nâMore than enough buzz, balls, black humour and razor-sharp writing to declare it a hitâ\n\n- Metro\n\nEdinburgh Fringe First Award"
