        "text": "Martin Taylor\n\nMartin Taylor was born in 1954 and is based in Northamptonshire. He studied at the Ealing School of Art, Wimbledon School of Art and Goldsmith's College.\n\nMartin's work reflects his love of nature, played out in exquisitely detailed studies of the countryside surrounding his studio, a converted stable on a farm. Every season brings fresh inspiration, and to achieve the precision and focus so characteristic of his work Martin paints \"en plein air\", returning to the same position for weeks at a time even in deepest winter. The combination of intricate detail and careful composition in his work celebrates nature on every scale, from the twigs on the forest floor to the clouds skimming the vast skies. Having previously worked with watercolours and drawings Martin is now working in oils in the studio, in pursuit of an even greater freedom of expression and intensity of colour.\n\nTaylor has won two RWS (Royal Watercolour Society) awards: the Chris Beetles award (1988) and the Jeffrey Archer award in (1989), and subsequently exhibited at the Chris Beetles Gallery for a number of years."
