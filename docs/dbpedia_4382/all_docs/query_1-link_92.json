        "text": "As long as there are artists like Henry Taylor around, painting is in little danger of dying. That is because Taylor, like most great painters, has reinvented the medium for his own purposes, reshaped it to his own particular needs.\n\nThose needs seem complex, encompassing and exceptionally empathetic. They are those of an ambitious artist attempting to give as full an account as he can of Black life in America, starting with his own, and spiraling out to family, friends and fellow artists (some of whom are white) as well as Black figures from politics and culture, and urgent issues like incarceration and racial violence.\n\nIn “Henry Taylor: B Side,” a thrilling survey at the Whitney Museum, you will see paintings of the artist watching his toddler daughter feed herself; Barack and Michelle Obama sitting cozy on a couch; Philando Castile dying in his car after being shot by a Minneapolis policeman; a self-portrait based on a 16th-century portrait of King Henry V in profile wearing royal regalia; and the great Chuck Berry performing for a group of slightly dazed-looking white teenagers.\n\nOne of the best-known paintings in the show is “Hammons meets a hyena on holiday” (2016). It monumentalizes an indelible photograph of the artist David Hammons selling snowballs on the Bowery, a 1983 performance piece. But Taylor makes Hammons even more remarkable, taking Hammons back to his symbolic roots — in front of the red ocher facade of the Great Mosque at Djenné in Mali — with a grinning hyena nearby. He understands the futility of snowballs in Africa.\n\nAll these images gain power from Taylor’s paint handling, which tends to be startlingly tough and direct. It proceeds in slabs of untempered color and skirmishes of brushwork, sidestepping traditional notions of finish and beauty. It conveys something of the harshness his sitters often face in this country and the resiliency that springs from it. Taylor’s paint also makes his figures very present. As do their staring, often dissimilar eyes. They suggest a strong bond between artist and his subject, with paint as the conduit. But if the exteriors are rough, his sitters are granted a fully developed interiority, which takes delicacy and can keep you pondering their expressions — and the feelings behind them.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
