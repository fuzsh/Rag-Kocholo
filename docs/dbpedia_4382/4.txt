Sir Martin Taylor, FRS, Professor of Pure Mathematics and Past Vice-President and Physical Secretary of the Royal Society, took up office as Warden of Merton College on 2 October 2010, and retired on 30 September 2018. Sir Martin was a Professor of Pure Mathematics at Manchester, after moving from Trinity College, Cambridge in 1986. Most recently his research has led him to study various aspects of arithmetic geometry: in particular, he and his collaborators have demonstrated how geometric properties of zeros of integral polynomials in many variables can be determined by the behaviour associated L-functions. Sir Martin read Mathematics at Pembroke College, Oxford before gaining a PhD at King's College London.

In 1982 he was awarded the London Mathematical Society's Whitehead Prize and the Adams Prize (shared) in 1983. He became President of the London Mathematical Society in 1998, and in the same year was given an EPSRC Senior Fellowship. In 2003 he received a Royal Society Wolfson Merit Award and became Chairman of the International Review of Mathematics (Steering group).
