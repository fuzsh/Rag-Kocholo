A scabrously funny look at âyoung enterpriseâ in modern Scotland.

In a small Fife town, somethingâs cooking at the cottage at the end of the estate. Gibbyâs back from London and heâs got some explaining to do. AWOL for over a year from the drug-dealing business set up by him and his childhood friends Fred and Stew, Gibby has no idea what heâs been missing out on. With the whisky in, the drugs out and the chicken stir-fry on, what started as a fraught reunion may end up a final fling.

Martin J. Taylorâs play East Coast Chicken Supper was first staged at the Traverse Theatre, Edinburgh, in 2005. It won an Edinburgh Fringe First Award.

âSharp characterisation, snappy, sassy dialogue and a nice unpredictabilityâ

- The Times

âMassively promising. Whatâs striking is the sheer energy and inventiveness with which Taylor spins out his variations on this single comic idea. Taylorâs early dialogue blazes with talent and potentialâ
