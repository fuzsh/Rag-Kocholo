So apologies, there may be some spoilers ahead. I would urge you to read the book anyway, simply because it’s one of the best crime novels ever written with a denouement to die for!\n\nI have delayed writing about the various adaptations of Death on the Nile for the simple fact that I had to give myself time to think about the newest film. I didn’t want to write a knee jerk reaction to what is a very different interpretation of the book to the one I was expecting. Kenneth Branagh had already started to take Poirot in a new direction with Murder on the Orient Express. However, his second outing as Hercule is even more audacious. The screen play is by Michael Green and with Branagh directing as well as starring. There have been mixed reviews and the predictable horror and dismay amongst Agatha fans that there have been changes from the book. I have no problem with this. They are, after all, adaptations. There is no point in repeating the same film or TV episode over and over. It’s a controversial area though, there is no doubt. Purists can be passionate about their opinions on liberties taken with the original text. After all, why tinker with perfection? But, as we saw with the most recent adaptation of And Then There Were None, sometimes those changes can produce a new, vibrant take on the book which shines fresh light on the plot and characters. The question is, however, how far is too far when adaptations change key elements of the book? It is hotly debated, particularly where Hercule Poirot is concerned and this most recent version of him.\n\nI’m not going to analyse every single adaptation of Death on the Nile that there has ever been. So, apologies if you were in your local production and I have failed to mention it. Agatha Christie did adapt the novel into a stage play herself and it was performed in the West End in the forties under the title Murder on the Nile, and also on Broadway. It was also performed under the title Hidden Horizons in Dundee in 1944. Unbelievably, I am not old enough to have seen any of these productions. I took the view for this piece that it was far more productive to focus on the three main films of this book as there is so much to compare in these very different interpretations.\n\nI will, however, just mention some of the other notable adaptations. There is the inevitable video game and my inevitable confession that I’m awful at it and can’t really understand the purpose of it. I fear I am not their target audience and this Nile cruise ship has sailed for me, I’m afraid.\n\nThere’s also a graphic novel, which first came out in French but is available in English now. Again, I will have to hold my hands up to the fact that I don’t generally read many graphic novels and it’s not a format I’m very keen on. The artwork in this one is good. It’s readily available to buy for around £20 so here is the link and you can make your own mind up about that if you prefer to see little drawings of Poirot with your words.\n\nOne medium I do love though, is audiobooks or radio dramatizations. Fortunately, there is a fabulous one available of Death on the Nile with John Moffatt as Poirot and Donald Sinden nearly stealing the show as Colonel Race. Moffatt is so good as Poirot and this 1997 version is perfect for a Sunday afternoon. Thankfully, it’s been available to buy on Audible since 2010, as the cassette of the production costs over £70. Here’s the link to buy the much more modestly priced audiobook.\n\nDeath on the Nile was published in 1937 and is one of Agatha Christie’s most famous and loved novels. This is perhaps why adaptations of it are so debated and quarrelled over. I’ve seen some truly unbelievable comments about the most recent film which I will not be quoting! It is a love triangle with very unexpected angles. Linnet Ridgeway is fabulously wealthy and friends with Jacqueline de Bellefort. Jacqueline is engaged to Simon Doyle who, upon seeing the beautiful, rich Linnet is beguiled into ditching poor Jacqueline and immediately marrying the wealthy heiress. They honeymoon in Egypt. Plain sailing so far. However, Jacqueline, having planned out married life with Simon decides she’s not missing out on what should have been her honeymoon and joins them to indulge in some fairly blatant stalking and harassment. The murders, of course, begin quite swiftly. It seems that everyone onboard the Karnak has reason to kill the victim, with a whole host of unusual and grudge bearing characters watching the newlyweds. It is, although glamorous and ingenious, one of the darkest stories. The ending reveals a plan so savage and clinical that it is breath-taking. This is a very twisted doomed love story. One of the most cold-hearted aspects of it is that someone who would kill for the over-whelming love of another will also stand by and watch that person sleep with someone else for money. The killers in this one are beyond redemption.\n\nWith its cast of lavish potential killers, the glamorous backdrop of Egypt and one of the most ingenious solutions in crime fiction, it is ripe for adaptation. The three major ones I will be looking at are firstly, the 1978 John Guillermin film adapted by Anthony Shaffer and starring Peter Ustinov as Poirot; the 2004 TV production for Agatha Christie’s Poirot (season nine episode three) with David Suchet as Poirot; and, of course, lastly the recent delayed 2022 Kenneth Branagh version. Each benefit from the ability to attract an all star cast but they are three very different films with three very different detectives.\n\nThe case of the three Poirots.\n\nFor many people reading this, the 1978 film will occupy a special place in their hearts. When the iconic Nino Rota music begins it announces a great epic of a movie. Its release in New York was timed to coincide with the sale of tickets for the Treasures of Tutankhamun exhibition at the Met, which itself had sparked a mini revival of Egyptomania. The poster for the film was altered to pay homage to this, with Tutankhamun’s head appearing on it.\n\nIt is a sumptuous movie, indulging in the vast wealth of some of the characters and the grand vistas of Egypt. It is largely faithful to the book, although there are some changes. What is surprising more than anything is the portrayal of Poirot himself.\n\nThis film was following on the heels of the 1974 Murder on the Orient Express with Albert Finney playing a very different version of Poirot. He, however, reportedly refused the offer to reprise the role, blaming the overwhelming heat of Egypt, which would not have been particularly easy with the almost pierrot-like make-up he had donned for the role. Ustinov was chosen as a complete departure. And he was!\n\nAlthough Ustinov played Poirot six times, he is strikingly dissimilar to the detective described in the books, both physically and emotionally. Ustinov is a warmer, more endearing rendition of the character but in some ways that seems to be at the expense of the sharp, detached intellect. He is no longer a stiff obsessive but more a bon viveur in a pith helmet. He is not the Poirot of the books but on some levels that doesn’t detract from the film.\n\nDavid Suchet’s portrayal is much closer to Agatha’s creation. He famously studied the mannerisms in the books and recently spoke about these in his live shows. He focuses the voice in the head, as Poirot is all about the head; the walk is small, precise steps which Suchet explained he perfected by imagining he was clenching a coin between his buttocks! He is, for many, the living embodiment of the detective. Perhaps this is because he played the role for so long that we have become conditioned to see him as this. This version of Death on the Nile was filmed in 2004 by which time Suchet was already synonymous with the role he had taken on in 1989. But his studious, meticulous portrayal is at its best here. His analysis of the detail of the character would have met with the detective’s approval. At one point in this version, he even has a tiny case for his cigarette ash. His usual swan topped cane is occasionally swapped for one with a telescope on top for sightseeing. He is for many, myself included, the consummate Poirot.\n\nThis leaves some very uncomfortable patent shoes for anyone else to fill. Kenneth Branagh has not attempted to do this. He is not portraying Suchet portraying Poirot. He is a new breed of Poirot and, like Ustinov, he seeks to stamp some of himself on this. We saw in Murder on the Orient Express that he was a more athletic, superhero style detective. That is still the case here. He uses his cane not to see sights but to trap a snake, perhaps a nod towards David Niven’s Colonel Race in the Ustinov version killing the cobra with a sword concealed in his cane. But it is not the Colonel’s heroics this time. It is Poirot in the hero role. He is dramatic. When he wishes to begin his denouement and close the guests in he stands, legs wide and fires a gun into the air. He runs (something I can’t imagine either of the other Poirot’s doing). He fights. He cries.\n\nHe also has an ever-deepening backstory. In Murder on the Orient Express, a lost love was hinted at. In this, we meet her. There is a whole backstory scene added to show Poirot’s newly imagined exploits in the First World War. This is no retired Belgian police officer we are being shown here, but a war hero who suffered extreme trauma and disfigurement. In some ways, as a lifelong fan, I have to admit I found this quite challenging. I understand what they are trying to achieve and how they are attempting to get behind who is the man Poirot, not just the detective, but this was still, nonetheless, quite a leap to take the character in this direction.\n\nWe also, as a result of this, discover the reason Poirot wears such an extravagant moustache and it is incredibly shocking on first viewing. I won’t spoil it for those who have not seen it, but when the man behind the mask/moustache is revealed, it has distinct overtones of him being the damaged anti-hero akin to a Batman character. I see that they are trying to provide reasons for why Poirot is how he is, but it’s not subtle and I’m sure many Christie fans didn’t enjoy their hero being literally butchered. But they already have me as a guaranteed audience. They are looking for new people to add to that and perhaps the concept of the man behind the moustache is a good hook for that.\n\nDavid Suchet is, conversely, all about subtlety. He provides all the finer nuances of Poirot’s character and its formation. In the books, Poirot is a very particular man, a very difficult and unique character. He is not self-pitying or pathetic in any way. He is often self-aggrandising and irritating but his behaviour and his mannerisms are never portrayed as damaged. He can be quite cold and clinical in his work. Nonetheless, David Suchet builds a person with each small character trait, a look, a doubt, a friendship which all culminates in creating a finely balanced character portrayal that is parfait. He does not rely on a dramatic physical deformity or enormous trauma to create a whole nuanced man. We see his heart-felt thrill at meeting his friend Colonel Race, we hear his warning to Jacqueline to bury her dead and his admonishment of Linnet when he tells her she has everything whilst Jacqueline has nothing. He can be a warm, sympathetic man but never an emotion filled, unpredictable man who is falling in love with one of the suspects.\n\nIn the Branagh version, the lady in question and object of his possible affections is Salome Ottobourne. She even says to Poirot, whoever she was she did a ‘job’ on him. In other words, he is not just physically damaged but broken emotionally. This seems a little at odds with the man who lives in his head, who is driven by the dispassionate need for method and for the little grey cells. This is a Poirot driven by his reckless heart and the unpredictability of that.\n\nChanging characters\n\nEagle eyed readers will have recoiled perhaps at the idea of a) Poirot having a love interest (there is small mention of this in the books – a young lady he could no longer see as she couldn’t cook and there is, of course, Countess Rossakoff) but more shockingly than that, b) it’s Salome Ottobourne! If, like me, you associate this name with the utterly marvellous Angela Lansbury dressed in every scarf she owns and swaying like she’s in a force ten gale at sea, then this will seem extraordinary. However, Salome has had a makeover too. She’s now a jazz singer with a gun in her hat. Her daughter Rosalie is now her niece and is in love with Bouc. I hear another gasp!\n\nThat’s right, Bouc is back. Played by the fabulous Tom Bateman. I can see why they would not want to say goodbye to this character and perhaps attempt to create a sidekick. He replaces Colonel Race in that respect, which is a shame as Colonel Race is a wonderful character. In the Suchet version Race is played by James Fox but the standout Race has to be the utterly marvellous David Niven in the Ustinov version. He is dapper, witty and utterly embodies the old school chap that is the Colonel.\n\nBouc is a lot more feckless than Race, weak but fun. Here we find him under the very large thumb of his mother, played by Annette Bening. In some ways they are also taking on the Tim Allerton and his mother role. The Allertons are both equally charmless. They are missing from the Ustinov film as well and don’t really add a lot to the Suchet version.\n\nBizarrely though, and perhaps to fit with the romance aspect, this Bouc character takes on the role of Salome in seeing one of the murders but being prevented from revealing who that is at the crucial moment by the killer. How did he see this? He was also the jewel thief. So a lot of the narrative and plotting has been poured into this one character and it feels a little imposed as a result.\n\nChanging the plot\n\nThe main problem with this character’s role, however, is his coat. It’s missing at one point and provides a clue for Poirot. But also Bouc’s mother is painting a picture of her son on the pyramids and paints him with a green coat when in fact it was red. This is one of the problems I have with the film. (spoiler ahead!)\n\nTo insert this supposedly clever plot point that Poirot spots, the key to the murder has been changed in this film and that is very problematic. Agatha Christie’s plotting is very tight and so many tiny strands come together to work perfectly. If one element is changed, the whole house of cards can collapse. It is a brave, or reckless, person who thinks they can simply tinker around with those intricate plots without creating chaos and plot holes elsewhere. Instead of the killer using red nail varnish to create the illusion that they have been shot, here they choose to switch that for red paint because the maid has forgotten to bring the nail varnish from the hotel. This is unbelievable. The killers have planned this for weeks, have sacrificed everything, even married to facilitate this audacious murder and yet the one item they depended on for it to work, they just leave to the whim of chance that it will be there. We are asked also to believe that a woman like Linnet Ridgeway travels with only one red nail varnish on her honeymoon for a month. Even then, if we can accept all this, there are other women on board who have red nail varnish. Salome Ottobourne is clearly shown in many scenes to be wearing red nail varnish! She’s a performer there for weeks. She would have red nail varnish with her.\n\nAnd so would Mrs von Schuyler played by Jennifer Saunders. Not one of these women had a bottle with them for a holiday or job in Egypt for so long? The boat is awash with red nail varnish but instead of stealing that, the killer changes tack on the central nub of the plot and resorts to stealing a tiny tube of red paint which would definitely not have run in the required way and quantities like blood. To insert the ‘clever’ plot point of Bouc’s coat changing colour in the painting, what they have done is create havoc with the rest of the plot. They have brought in an aspect of unbelievability. To believe that you can just add a new clue to an Agatha Christie story without it sending shock waves through every other aspect is foolhardy. And, unfortunately, has made the plot much weaker than that of the book. It stretches believability too far. Neither of the other two films tinker with the central mechanics of the plot because it’s brilliant and, most importantly, the plot in the book works.\n\nThe major characters\n\nOf course, the central part of the story is the unusual love triangle that is not what it appears to be at all. For this to work, it needs the three people at the heart of it to play perfectly, for each new angle we see revealed to fit.\n\nIn the Ustinov version we have Simon MacCorkindale as Simon Doyle. He is everything he should be. Attractive, seemingly innocent and guileless, all boyish charm. He works perfectly alongside Lois Chiles. She has just the right blend of beauty and charisma. When Jacqui says he was just dazzled by her, we can believe that easily. Her costumes are magnificent, particularly when she dances at the cataract hotel. The heels of her shoes had diamonds in them. No wonder Anthony Powell won the Oscar for costume design.\n\nDo the main couple work as well in the other adaptations? I don’t think so although the couple in the Ustinov version set a high bench mark. Emily Blunt and JJ Field in the Suchet version are believably a couple. Blunt has rather unusual blonde hair. She’s also not as strong with as much self-belief as Chiles’s Linnet. JJ Field isn’t quite as dazzled by her. He isn’t quite as in love. Sometimes he even seems a little tired of it all!\n\nThen, of course, there is the couple in the Branagh version. They have attracted a lot of comment. Is this Linnet dazzling? Yes, undoubtedly. She’s Wonder Woman, after all. But something is lacking in Gal Gadot’s reimagining. Does she seem in love with Simon Doyle? She’s a woman with a whole host of suitors, some of whom we are led to believe are on board. And yet she chooses this man, who we never really see her head over heels in love with. This is not the all consuming affair that breaks her friend’s heart. Which is slightly understandable. Armie Hammer has now appeared in adaptations of two of my all time favourite books, this and Rebecca. I’m not going to comment on the off screen situation but on screen, is he boyish? No. Is he the lovely Simple Simon? No. He is slightly sleazy and gauche, referring openly at the wedding celebrations to Linnet’s money paying for her own wedding present. He’s also a little too old and somewhat brutish. He even looks like he could be the… well, I’ll leave that there. I come back to, is it believable. Could these two intelligent beautiful women be so obsessed with him as to die for love? Pickings must have been slim, is all I can imagine.\n\nOf course, for the triangle to exist there has to be the wronged woman – Jacquelin de Bellefort. This was a role made for Mia Farrow. She is skittish, possibly a little unhinged and capable of anything. And yet, she is so achingly vulnerable. Her relationship with Ustinov’s Poirot is beautiful. She is like an excited child, eating her chocolates, dancing around and when she says, Oh Simon it’s all too perfect, we know she believes whole heartedly in the power of love and will do utterly anything to preserve that.\n\nIt’s a little unfair to compare anyone else’s portrayal of the part with this. Emma Griffiths Malin in Suchet’s version is a careful representation and she never really takes the brakes off. We don’t really see the utterly out of control passion that drives her.\n\nHowever, Emma Mackey in the Branagh version is the best thing about the film. She is astonishingly, beautifully insane. Her mania for love is clear from the very beginning. She has keen eyes, searching out everything. She’s clever and capable of mad acts of jealousy, of following newlyweds around just to punish them or even observe them. Her abandonment is painful. Her rage unbearable. She could shoot her ex-lover. She could easily kill. When Mackey is on camera no one is looking anywhere else. The only problem being of course that we have to believe that Simon would be distracted by another.\n\nThe supporting cast\n\nAll of the films benefit from Agatha Christie adaptations attracting all star casts. There are some utterly delightful performances in all three of the versions. The stand out ones I think are:\n\nColonel Race – David Niven (Ustinov version) – I’ve already mentioned how he is the consummate gentleman and provides an excellent foil for Poirot, in more ways than one. He represents the traditional justice system. Although, the man he’s pursuing in the book, Richetti, never appears in the adaptations. Nor does Mr Fanthorpe for that matter. But David Niven is dapper, quick witted and slightly playful. He is an absolute joy to watch.\n\nBette Davis – Mrs van Schuyler (Ustinov version) A legend who feels as though she really has stepped out of the pages of an Agatha Christie novel. The formidable presence is there in every scene and her double act with a young Maggie Smith is magnificent.\n\nIn the Suchet version, Mrs van Schuyler is played by Judy Parfitt and she has a vicious nature very reminiscent of Mrs Boynton in Appointment with Death. Daisy Donovan is the meek Cornelia Robson. This is a quite disturbing, domineering relationship. Whereas in the Branagh version French and Saunders perform the double act for comic effect much of the time. French is Bowers (Bowers and Cornelia are a little interchangeable in the various productions and there doesn’t seem any need to have both) and Saunders is Mrs van Schuyler who is now elevated to Linnet’s godmother and is in a relationship with Bowers.\n\nMaggie Smith – Bowers – Tortured by her employer, sarcastic and sharp as a stiletto. When she says, I could kill her on that score alone, we’re in no doubt that she could.\n\nMrs Ottobourne – This is a difficult one. In the Ustinov version it is the utterly fabulous Angela Lansbury, no stranger to Agatha Christie adaptations. As the slightly tipsy, over the top writer who has fallen on harder times, she is magnificent. Her scene in the bar where she says this crocodile has lost its croc is superb. But then there is the portrayal by Frances De La Tour in the Suchet version. This is every bit as good. Her luring of Poirot onto the dance floor is perfect. It’s very hard to choose between these two performances. As I discussed earlier, the Branagh version takes this in an entirely different direction with Sophie Okonedo as a nightclub singer and possible love interest. It does give her a reason for being on the boat which seems to be top of their thoughts in this production. Each character is given a definite reason for being present, primarily as part of the wedding party. Salome Ottobourne’s is a role that should have a lightness to it. However, here it is much more serious. Although, she does have the wonderful line, ‘I’ve had a handful of husbands. Each one a handful.’\n\nFerguson (Jon Finch in the Ustinov version and Alistair Mackenzie in the Suchet version) and Dr Bessner (played by Steve Pemberton in the Suchet version and Jack Warden in the Ustinov) are rolled into one in the Branagh version in the form of Dr Windlesham, the lord incognito. He’s also a previous lover of Linnet. In the book, Windlesham is mooted by the gossip columns as a potential suitor to Linnet. He even proposes to her but she turns him down as she realises she would no longer be queen, simply his ‘queen consort.’ Windlesham is played by Russell Brand, which obviously attracts some comment. The accent slips a little in places but he does a good job of representing that huge theme in the book of overwhelming love and how that can easily lead to sadness and jealousy.\n\nThe maid, Louise Bourget, does of course become very important to the plot but is often quite weak in the productions. Jane Birkin took on the role in the Ustinov role, Felicite du Jeu in the Suchet, and Rose Leslie in the most recent version. One maid who isn’t credited on the Ustinov version is the wonderful Celia Imrie in a very early role.\n\nEgypt\n\nEach film captures the grandeur of Egypt, the great tombs to the long dead, mighty and rich foreshadowing the death which is to come. The Nile features heavily, of course. Usually synonymous with being the giver of life, Agatha Christie chose to call this Death on the Nile. Each film illustrates that feeling of them being dragged along down a river they cannot escape from. The constant rhythmic beat of the paddle steamer plays underneath, particularly in the Branagh version where one death even shows the body on it turning as if on a great wheel of life. The noise of the boat was actually so loud on the Ustinov version that some scenes had to be dubbed over. The overpowering heat adds to the rising tension and claustrophobia onboard. In the Ustinov version the heat was almost overbearing for many of the cast.\n\nThe Egypt aspect is emphasised in the Branagh version, even though all filming took place in England. In particular when Gal Gadot, dressed as the Queen of the Egypt, Cleopatra, sits up high on a pedestal and utters the line, ‘I have immortal longings in me,’ referencing Shakespeare’s Antony and Cleopatra (Act 5 s 2):\n\n‘Give me my robe, put on my crown; I have\n\nImmortal longings in me.’\n\nThese are, of course, the robe and crown of death for Cleopatra. The parallels go further with the taking of the lover, the asp that has just attempted to bite Linett. There are echoes of the queen even in the boat itself. Enobarbus says of Cleopatra:\n\n‘The barge she sat in like a burnished throne\n\nBurned on the water.’\n\n(Antony and Cleopatra Act 2 s2)\n\nBranagh’s version has the Karnak as a great gleaming burnished throne for his divine, alluring immortal and these obsessive fires will burn each other out but in a very different way to the one depicted by Shakespeare.\n\nFor Branagh’s version, she is a doomed goddess. But she is not the only one. Jacqui arrives dressed in red to the wedding party where everything is white. She rises from the Nile as a very different kind of goddess, the golden wings on her dress perhaps referencing Nephythys, the goddess of death. This Nile is not the giver of life but the bringer of death.\n\nIn terms of the overall feel, each of these films is very different. The original Ustinov version is playful in parts, with such moments as the camel/donkey ride up to the temple and the jolly music. The Suchet version is much darker with a distinct air of melancholy to many of the scenes. It is meticulously observed, dark and very serious in parts. There’s a feeling from the beginning that tragedy is stalking them.\n\nHowever, the Branagh version also embraces something else as well. From the opening nightclub scene, they are clearly attempting to create a much sexier atmosphere. This is not just love. This is lust. All-consuming desire which feels illicit from the very beginning. The dancing is a little excruciating but the overall atmosphere of the film is good. This is, after all, a book about desire and where that can lead. The novel does in fact have the exclusive nightclub Chez Ma Tante and this is the first time Poirot sees Jacqueline with Simon. He says she ‘cares too much’ and that is the real centre of this book. Her love is all consuming and from that very moment we know it is on dangerous tracks. People often dismiss Agatha Christie as being cosy, not literary enough. But this novel is a masterclass in creating darkness out of love. Wealth and beauty are synonymous with seductive danger. This is symbolised in Linnet’s pearls, the Tiffany Yellow Diamond in the Branagh version. Gal Gadot wears a replica in the film, but Beyonce wore the real thing in the video shown just before the movie at the cinema.\n\nLove and the different forms it takes, is embedded deeply in this book and takes centre stage in all three films, most notably the Branagh version where most of the characters are, instead of rejoicing in love, battling with some form of it, including Poirot himself. Friendship, lovers, rejected lovers, unattainable love, mother/son relationships, lost love, they are all on this burnished barge heading towards destruction.\n\nBranagh with his theatrical background has taken the idea that the crooked love triangle at the centre, with its overwhelming desire that we know can only end badly, is nothing short of Shakespearean in its tragedy. Each film’s depiction of this is very different but this book was written eighty-six years ago and its themes are still as relevant, the mystery still as ingenious and the films continue to be made. Let’s hope this will be the same in another eighty-six years’ time. We wait to see what direction the new character of Poirot will go in the next Branagh movie. Already, there are distinct differences. Hallowe’en Party is being transported to post war Italy for A Haunting in Venice. Branagh has spoken about his desire to create a cinematic universe of Christie films, including Miss Marple. I leave you to ponder that.\n\nThank you for reading and I will be back soon with more adaptation analysis.\n\nAdapting Agatha 10 – As easy as ABC\n\n*** SPOILER ALERT*** I do try to avoid spoilers, particularly the big one! However, little things might slip through the net and sometimes it is unavoidable when discussing the details of individual adaptations compared to one another.\n\nFear.\n\nThis is a book about the very nature of our fears and someone who knows how to manipulate them. Agatha Christie does of course but in this book, the killer trades on the public’s fear to lay a false trail. It’s about the creation of mass fear and how to enhance that through the media. So it’s still very relevant today and enormously attractive to film makers. There have been many adaptations of this wonderful novel. It’s one of her best and has a beautiful darkness to it which has been captured with varying degrees of success in a wide array of series, films and other media. I won’t be exploring every single adaptation as there are many and some much better than others. If this means that I might not mention your favourite adaptation which you saw at the local village hall in 1942, I apologise. However, I will be focusing on the stand out versions.\n\nThe novel was published in 1936 and is often said to be one of the first novels exploring the idea of a serial killer. There is seemingly a mad man on the loose and there is much discussion of motiveless crime, including Jack the Ripper. And indeed whether a madman does in fact have any motivation. The doctor tells us, ‘A deadly logic is one of the special characteristics of acute mania.’ Someone is killing people in alphabetical order, Mrs Ascher in Andover being the first and the following murders seem to create a similar pattern. A copy of the ABC train guide is left at the scene of each crime. The killer styles himself ABC, sending notes in the manner of the Ripper notes. Not only does this scheme instantly attract fear but it is also used to great effect to tease Hercule Poirot, who, let’s face it, does not enjoy being teased about anything, least of all his own abilities. It is almost as if Agatha is sitting at her desk, devising ways to torture her famous detective. She taunts him at every turn. It’s often said that Agatha Christie speaks to us through Ariadne Oliver, but in this book, she at points inhabits the persona that the killer seeks to create. She taunts Poirot with the things that will get to him the most in letters from the killer. ‘Mr Hercule Poirot , You fancy yourself, don’t you, at solving mysteries that are too difficult.’ She goes on, ‘Let us see, Mr Clever Poirot, just how clever you can be.’ You can almost picture Agatha sitting down to her desk and smiling as she penned these words to her own infuriating creation.\n\nWith the second letter, she refers to the little game she is playing to amuse herself. ‘First game to me, I think.’ ‘But the fun’s only just beginning.’ She concludes the letter with ‘What a merry time we are having.’ The third letter takes an even more unpleasant, teasing tone as the idea of the homicidal maniac grows stronger and the book even darker. It begins with the patronising, ‘Poor Mr Poirot.’ For ardent fans of the Belgian sleuth, this is hard to read and it would perhaps have been quite shocking to fans in 1936 that the killer himself is speaking directly to their star. It continues in a sneering tone, ‘Not so good at these little criminal matters as you thought yourself, are you? Rather past your prime, perhaps?’ ‘It’s a bit dull having it all my own way, you know.’ She attacks both his age and his intellect in these letters and it’s almost as if his fans are being goaded now. The reader can’t help but think, ‘You show ‘em, Poirot! Come on.’ We all know, of course, that he will be successful but at that moment we are deep in the dark night of the soul right alongside him. Just as with Holmes and Moriarty, the author has raised the terrible and distinct possibility that this time our hero has met his match. All we can do is will him on.\n\nThere are some fantastic red herrings along the way as well. The whole story is of course one big red herring. But the parallel story of Alexander Bonaparte Cust (ABC) holds equal fascination. Hastings narrates most of the book, but for these sections, Agatha Christie (AC), switches the point of view to being ‘not from Captain Hastings’ personal narrative.’ The story of the stocking salesman who is weak and damaged, is both touching and frightening. Are we watching a psychotic killer in the throes of his agonized life? Agatha Christie herself is doing exactly what the press and the hysteria are doing around the case in the book, she is creating a perfect monster. He is disturbing because he is different. This is a theme that comes up for Poirot himself repeatedly. He is different, doesn’t quite fit in. It’s not just that he is often referred to as a ‘foreigner’ but that he is foreign in so many other ways. His obsessiveness, his eccentricities, his own choice of being alone. In some ways, Cust is another way of looking at Poirot and judging him. Just as with the letters, it is another black mirror for Poirot. Cust is seen as ‘other’ just as Poirot himself is. Here, it becomes much more disturbing but there is still that pitying tone following him. Our fears are played on again by Agatha Christie. The fear of the different. This has provided a rich vein of interpretation for those adapting the novel. Many of the themes in this book have. Not just the obvious fear created by the killer on the loose but Poirot’s own fear of failing and, by extension, our own fear that he really has in fact met his match.\n\nFor a novel with so many layers and themes, there have been a lot of adaptations that don’t quite seem to exploit the full potential. On the screen there was the 1965 film The Alphabet Murders. This stars Tony Randall as Poirot and Robert Morley as Hastings. It’s probably glaringly obvious from the cover above that this is a comedy very much born of the 1960s. It’s has that farce like, slightly disjointed feel to it and, of course, women running around – because that’s what women did to be funny in the ‘60s. Margaret Rutherford appears as Miss Marple for some unknown reason and her real life husband is with her. There are definitely none of the finer nuances of the book and none of the themes are touched on. It has a feel of almost poking fun at the whole genre and mocking it. It’s a bit like Carry on Poirot really and you can certainly see why Agatha Christie never really warmed to the idea of Hercule Poirot being on film.\n\nIn terms of other media, the book had previously been adapted for radio in 1943 for the Suspense series. This starred Charles Laughton, an actor Agatha Christie had seen in an adaptation of Witness for the Prosecution which she reputedly did like and he was, of course, a magnificent actor. However in this particular adaptation he plays Cust and there is no Poirot at all. It’s by no means an awful adaptation but, for me, a major part of the book is those parallel lines of watching Poirot trying to figure it out and seeing our supposed killer, Cust, dissolving as he is hunted. Really I would say that any Poirot with no Poirot, or for that matter, any non-Marple book that has Miss Marple inserted into it, doesn’t really add to the story for me and, in fact, often detracts from it.\n\nA much better audio version, in my opinion, is the 2000 BBC Radio 4 full casts dramatization starring the fabulous John Moffatt, Simon Williams and Philip Jackson. This is still readily available and Michael Bakewell’s excellent dramatization is well worth listening to.\n\nThere have been a number of other adaptations along the way in all different kinds of media. There was the interesting anime version in the series Agatha Christie’s Great Detectives Poirot and Marple (2004). This looks really quite beautiful aesthetically. There was also the 2009 adaptation in the series Les Petits Meurtes d’Agatha, which has quite a loyal following. In 2005 there was another loosely based version made for Japanese TV called Meitantei Akafuji Takashi. And there are the usual selection of games for PC, Xbox and PS4, all of which I’m appalling at so it would be unfair of me to judge them.\n\nHowever, the two stand out adaptations of The ABC Murders are of course the David Suchet version in 1992 as part of the Agatha Christie’s Poirot series and the subsequent Sarah Phelps’ mini series of 2018. They are very different from one another and both have their admirers and critics.\n\nDavid Suchet of course made the role of Poirot his own and for many he is the ideal representation of the character. He has said that the novel The ABC Murders is his favourite and that this was also his favourite adaptation as well. It’s not difficult to see why. The Clive Exton script is fabulous and, as with many of the adaptations in this series, is largely faithful to the novel. There are some changes but I don’t think they are significant enough to be detrimental. There’s no Inspector Crome or Dr Thompson and in this version, Hastings has returned from holiday rather than his farm, presumably for where this episode sits in the continuing series. There’s also an addition of a souvenir he returns with, a rather smelly cayman which he shot. Although a little odd, it does add to the wonderful friendship these two characters have. The look on Hastings’ face when Poirot says he can stay with him is so wonderful. The deep and abiding warmth of their relationship is one of the many joys of this series and also brings an appropriate level of humour. It’s not the slapstick silliness of the previous version, but there is a mischievous wry smile in some of the scenes which works perfectly. One particular scene I love is at dinner.\n\nHP: I did not say this before Hastings because perhaps it would have been mistaken for self importance, a characteristic I dislike more than any other.\n\nHastings: (Long pause with soup spoon. Wide disbelieving eyes.) Oh right. (pause) Delicious soup this.\n\nIt is a beautiful scene and highlights some of the subtle humour that is in Agatha Christie’s work, even in some of the darker books such as this one.\n\nThis scene from the book always makes me smile and is based on their wonderful friendship.\n\n‘I put a few things in a suitcase whilst Poirot once more rang up Scotland Yard.\n\nA few minutes later he came into the bedroom and demanded :\n\n‘Mais qu’est ce que vous faites la?’\n\n‘I was packing for you. I thought it would save time.’\n\n‘Vous eprouvez trop d’emotion, Hastings. It affects your hands and your wits. Is that a way to fold a coat? And regard what you have done to my pyjamas. If the hairwash breaks what will befall them?’\n\n‘Good heavens, Poirot,’ I cried, ‘this is a matter of life and death. What does it matter what happens to our clothes?’\n\n‘You have no sense of proportion, Hastings.’\n\nThe elegant touch of humour right in the middle of the characters hunting a supposed serial killer is superb and the relationship between David Suchet’s Poirot and Hugh Fraser’s Hastings, reflects this perfectly. A wonderful example of this is when they are washing the dishes together and discussing the case – a prime spot for thinking, as Agatha herself said. Poirot passes the washed plate back to Hastings repeatedly as it doesn’t look clean enough to him. Hastings doesn’t seem to notice and just continues to wash the same plate repeatedly.\n\nThe other major relationship in the book, of course, is that between Poirot and Cust. We see their lives in parallel and how the hunted and the possible killer are evolving as the murders progress. There is a fabulous scene in which we can see a visual representation of this when Cust and Poirot sit face to face which David Suchet discusses in his book Poirot and Me. Cust is so central to any adaptation of this book and Donald Sumpter plays it beautifully in this version. He is that combination of damaged, frightened, painfully shy and self conscious at the same time as being unfortunately quite repulsive. When he sits on a train opposite two women, they look at him suspiciously, warily simply because of the character he so instantly and obviously is. We feel sympathy for this pathetic man, which David Suchet captures very sensitively. But at the same time, we are scared, on our guard and very aware that this man could be capable of terrible acts, even murder. We are immediately unsettled by this man who is traumatised by war and blighted by epilepsy. He is a very difficult man to love or even empathise with. A figure to pity and fear.\n\nFear of the different is very much a theme that is central to the Sarah Phelps’ version. Fear takes centre stage in this much darker production. There is no heart warming relationship between Poirot and Hastings gilded with humour in this version. In fact, there’s no Hastings at all! But that is not the greatest departure from what audiences were used to. Aficionados and Agatha Christie fans were as shocked by this production as those loyal to the David Suchet series.\n\nThe main source of controversy was Poirot himself. John Malkovich, a fine actor, was cast as a very different kind of Poirot. First of all there was his look. Clearly, he is quite a slender man. He’s bald and there are no elaborate moustaches. His facial hair is a figure of fun at one point where it’s clear he has dyed it and the dye begins to run in front of the police. (His use of Revivit is discussed in the book but not in such an embarrassing fashion). There is a pathetic element to him. This is a man past his prime. His glory days are gone. So a new fear arises. There is a fear of becoming irrelevant, being forgotten. When he visits the police station, he is not welcomed as the great Hercule Poirot. He is told to ‘take a seat with the other members of the public.’ He keeps old fan letters and there is a distinct nod from the writers to the die hard fans who are watching, when one such letter says, ‘We do think you’re really rather marvellous!’\n\nHe’s even reduced to performing murder mystery parties at country house parties and it’s commented on that these are old hat as there’s ‘not the demand for it anymore.’ Ironically, of course, this production turns the concept on its head by pointing out that the story does indeed end up being set in a country house where the murderer resides!\n\nPoirot is aging and alone. There is none of the little family we see created in the Suchet version of Hastings, Japp and, in other productions, Miss Lemon. Alongside this, the inevitable spectre of death arises. Inspector Japp dies and we see his funeral, which really is a lot to bear for most fans! Poirot is even accused of lying to Japp for years about being a policeman in Belgium. There’s no record of him. Japp’s reputation was ruined by this. ‘He just broke,’ Rupert Grint’s harsh Crome tells Poirot. Not only does Japp die but he was destroyed by Poirot. All the sacred cows are smashed in this production, which at times seems a little extreme.\n\nThis is a very bleak, stark production showing us a raw, human version of Poirot with all his fears and paranoias. His charmingly eccentric foibles are now more addictive behaviour patterns emerging from deep seated traumas. He won’t even let the policeman use his toilet! We’re taken back to a violent, horrific past in Belgium in flashbacks that are entirely a creation that does not come from the books. He’s the victim of the invasion and his past even becomes a new thread of the mystery. Crome says, ‘Your word is worthless. You’re not who you say you are. Who the hell are you?’ A new strand arises that even links Poirot to the victims, partly involving him delivering a baby, the suggestion being this is even more of a pointed attack on Poirot than just the wish to beat him at the game as the letters say.\n\nHe is deeply religious and his faith is tested. He has a giant crucifix over his bed in a sparse bedroom. This is not Suchet’s beautiful art deco Whitehaven. This is a cell where a tortured, lonely man resides. In one flashback to 1914, we see Poirot arriving in England. He says, ‘I’m a refugee.’ This feeling of alienation is a strong theme running through the whole series.\n\nHe is in direct parallel to Cust, played by Eamon Farren, who is also forced to live alone. He is in a bed bug ridden hovel run by the utterly rancid Mrs Marbury played by Shirley Henderson. She farms out her daughter as a prostitute to the residents, including the truly disgusting Treadgold, who at one point we see at breakfast and Cust focuses in on a giant boil on his neck before bursting his fried egg. This is an horrifically closed in moment that encapsulates what this production is seeking to highlight – the appalling lives that many were forced to live, that stands in direct contrast to those who live in the excesses of Churston. This seamy underbelly of life is, of course, how many were forced to live at the time. Very few would have enjoyed the supposed life of Agatha Christie’s golden age.\n\nCust is also alienated by his own demons. He too is a tortured soul, by his epilepsy, his anxiety, his acute sensitivity, his pain. He not only tortures himself but asks the young prostitute to torture him by driving her heels into open sores on his back, as Poirot says, to numb the pain in his head. This is a deeply uncomfortable thing to watch and does in itself alienate a large proportion of the usual Agatha Christie audience. But it creates a man who is so tortured that he himself believes he may well have committed the murders that grip the nation. The memory black outs that facilitate this possibility being a pre cursor to the psychological thrillers that are so popular now such as Girl on a Train. It also ties into the idea that Crome suggests that this man is a ‘deranged, sexual pervert,’ not words one usually associates with a Christmas special. But it is so disturbingly real that we can believe we are looking into the face of manic killer because he is so other.\n\nHowever, what it does do is play on the idea that the press are whipping up a fury that he is a faceless beast. It is creating a monster that not even Poirot can stop. That fear of failure, not just for Poirot, but for us the audience is ever present. Poirot is repeatedly teased and goaded by the letters, that end playfully on the words, ‘Chin, chin.’ Again, poking fun at the posh people’s game of it all.\n\nThe other characters are played wonderfully, in particular Tara Fitzgerald as the ailing, fragile Lady Hermione as she is called here, who in this version we have seen earlier as so exuberant and full of life at one of Poirot’s murder mysteries for her own birthday party. We are even taken back to five years ago when Poirot attended Churston and we see him dramatically announcing ‘I catch killers!’ and that blood will be our entertainment. The party begin chanting, ‘Birthday murder.’ It’s all very meta at this point, pointing out our own predilection for seeing blood, death and murder mysteries as a source of entertainment. The concept of the league, the grouping together of friends and relatives of the victims isn’t very strong in this. They are a fractured bunch, many of whom are not wholly sympathetic characters and are increasingly impatient with Poirot and the police. The deaths are of course incredibly graphic and brutal.\n\nThere are many things to like in this version, not least of all the picking up of themes that are present in the book, especially the parallel lines, which we see in the wonderful train track opening credits that play on the railway metaphor and the calling card of the ABC rail guide. The presentation of new slants on Poirot does open the door for other dramatic interpretations. It would be rather sad if we said the David Suchet version was the consummate Poirot so there’s no point in doing anymore. I do think there are some excesses in the Sarah Phelps’ version. The believability of John Malkovich as Poirot is stretched a lot. But there are things that go to the very heart of the book which are examined in beautiful detail, not least of all the fears this book plays on. It is in many ways an unusual, ground breaking book that has a very dark side to it. It’s certainly not a comedy or farce as has been portrayed before. If new audiences are going to be attracted to adaptations of Agatha Christie, I think it’s essential to keep these fresh and alive. There’s no point in seeking to copy what has gone before or parody those. Perhaps sometimes this leads to going off topic a little but sometimes this can lead to new light being cast on the story. I look forward to seeing if Mr Branagh is tempted to adapt this one.\n\nAdapting Agatha 9 – Endings. Sleeping Murder\n\n***SPOILER ALERT – some aspects of the following might give a little away. ***\n\nThis is one of my favourite Agatha Christie books. There is so much poignancy to it and interweaving stories of lost love or obsessive love. I think part of its allure comes from the fact that it is a book with its own story. Although the last Miss Marple book to be published, it was not the last she wrote. It was written during the Blitz when Agatha Christie was in London. She wrote this and Curtain, Hercule Poirot’s last book, in case she was killed in an air raid. She gifted Sleeping Murder to her husband, Max Mallowan, and Curtain to her daughter, Rosalind. They were then locked in a bank vault to be published in the event of her death.\n\nHowever, the story does not end there. This intriguing history has been much disputed. John Curran in his excellent book, Agatha Christie’s Secret Notebooks, suggests that Agatha Christie’s own notebooks reveal the book was still being planned as late as November 1948 as it is named under a section entitled ‘plans.’ Whether that refers to a first draft or perhaps some other plans such as a re-write or even re-naming is not clear though.\n\nThe book had many different titles in its pre-publication history. Firstly, Murder in Retrospect, then Cover Her Face – which it had to be changed from as the wonderful P.D. James got there first with her novel in 1962 (a title that comes from the words of the play The Duchess of Malfi which features in Sleeping Murder.) Agatha Christie’s agent, Edmund Cork had royalty statements from 1940 which show that the author was charged for typing the novel up when it was called Murder in Retrospect. She also drew up the legal documents that year to gift it to her husband before it was placed in the bank vault. And there it stayed with its partner, Curtain, until Agatha Christie knew she would not write any more Miss Marple or Poirot books and she authorised their publication. Curtain was released from its vault first, in 1975, but sadly she never saw the publication of Sleeping Murder in October 1976 as she had passed away in January 1976. Part of my love for this book is in this deeply touching story surrounding its history, but the story itself is magnificent.\n\nThe book has a beautiful sad romance to it. There are so many tales of frustrated love or lost love overlaying the much darker obsessive love at the centre of Sleeping Murder. It’s so sensitively written with a very gentle sadness to it, alongside the truly disturbing killer at the core. Helen journeys out to Walter Fane to marry him but decides she doesn’t love him and he loses his bride to be. He has already lost his first wife. Helen herself meets Richard Erskine onboard ship and there is a truly deep love between them but he is already married and that relationship falls away too. When Helen does marry, her husband Major Halliday dies in abject misery with very fragile sanity as a result of his belief that he killed his wife. These are heart rending tales of lost love, perhaps as a result of them being written as a goodbye to Miss Marple, perhaps because of the time they were written when so many people lost loved ones during the war. When Agatha Christie signed the document gifting this book to her beloved husband Max she wrote of her ‘natural love and affection for him.’\n\nThe story surrounding the book and the story within the book have such an elegant poignancy to them that they really do demand to be adapted with a sense of that and a very gentle touch. Joan Hickson’s sixth outing as Miss Marple does just that. Screened in January 1987, it is a very faithful adaptation and the script by Ken Taylor is very respectful of the book, not just in its adherence to the story and the characters but also the over-arching atmosphere of the book. If there is a criticism of the book, it is that the starting point for the plot, that of Gwenda being drawn to the childhood home she’d forgotten existed, is somewhat far-fetched. But I personally feel that this element of the guiding hand of fate is beautifully realised in such details as the cornflower wallpaper, the doors she shouldn’t know exist and the layout of the garden. It brings in that aspect Agatha Christie is so good at, the little thought that something else might be at work here, perhaps something more sinister or even supernatural. Many of the reviews I’ve read mention how dark and even frightening people found this when it was first aired.\n\nThe Joan Hickson version perfectly captures this. Another aspect readers sometimes mention with regard to this book is, of course, the timeline of Miss Marple herself. Although it is the last published Marple, it wasn’t, of course written last. That means Miss Marple is actually quite sprightly in this one, whereas in earlier published books she has already been told to slow down by her doctor and advised to no longer garden. In Sleeping Murder she is forever gardening and it is quite an integral part of the plot of the book. We also meet Dolly Bantry’s husband, Colonel Bantry who we have, of course, been told has died in The Mirror Crack’d From Side to Side. But Joan Hickson overcomes any of the possible issues with her finely nuanced performance that perfectly captures the shrewd, intelligent and kind Miss Marple we all love in the books. Joan Hickson herself was 80 years old when filming this but she’s as sprightly as the ‘young’ Miss Marple we have in Sleeping Murder.\n\nThe setting exactly evokes Anstell Manor, with Cadhay House in Ottery Saint Mary being used. At one point there is even a poster on the wall advertising ‘Ottery Saint Mary village church fete’ to be held at Cadhay House. The supporting cast is wonderful, in particular Geraldine Alexander is a perfect Gwenda Reed. This is such a central character that the casting has to be good on this and she does not disappoint, caught on that boundary between being a young bride, excited by her new home and troubled terribly by the memories that start to plague her. Incidentally, eagle eyed viewers will have seen Geraldine Alexander on our screens recently as Mrs Wilson – the housekeeper at Bridgerton House.\n\nGeraldine McEwan was a fabulous Miss Marple. Her mixture of sharp intelligence, generosity and mischief were beautifully pitched. However, in Sleeping Murder, the first episode of her second series of Marple which aired in 2006, although she still shines through, the changes to the storyline made by Stephen Churchett unfortunately did produce quite a lot of controversy. It had become obvious with the first ITV series of Marple that these episodes were not going to stick slavishly to the books or attempt to replicate the wonderful Miss Hickson. But this adaptation in particular strays so far from the book that it become a little difficult at points and did lead to criticism from purists. It’s always exciting to have new adaptations and to see new ways of working the storylines. I’d be very happy to see new versions of the Miss Marple stories being made. But this version of Sleeping Murder veers off in some unusual directions at points that I don’t quite understand the need for.\n\nThere are a lot of changes so I will just focus on the major ones that I think perhaps detract a little from the narrative. Firstly, Gwenda’s mother and step-mother are rolled into one. This is not perhaps so egregious but the story takes on a different role for Gwenda’s mother, that of the reformed thief who fakes her own death. I’m not sure I really characterised this person like that. It left a little unpleasant sense that she was a liar and, notably, had lied to her own daughter. In a way, it sullied the memory of her. But most importantly, I didn’t really understand the need for this change. We are also left without her husband, Gwenda’s father’s, tragic demise, losing his mind and guilt ridden until his death. In this version, he’s simply pushed off a cliff. He’s denied that extremely sad and poetic end that Agatha Christie had given him.\n\nI think like most viewers who loved this book, all this could have been over-looked if it were not for the inclusion of The Funnybones. They are a singing and dancing music hall act comprised of Sarah Parish as a somewhat geeky, fast playing xylophone musician who shoots to fame, alongside a wistful Paul McGann, Dawn French and Martin Kemp. I’m not sure what the thought process was behind this insertion and I think, for me, it detracted a little from the narrative and the flow of tension. Some purist Agatha Christie fans even went as far as to use words such as ‘spoof’ and ‘farce.’ Although, I’m not sure it veers that far. It does seem a little unnecessary given that there is already the ‘play-within-the-play’ aspect to this with Gwenda visiting a production of The Duchess of Malfi. Harriet Walter is a very excellent Duchess seen for a few moments on the stage!\n\nThere is the usual star-studded cast for these more modern versions and in the most part they work well. Sophia Myles plays an excellent Gwenda (Halliday here as she hasn’t married Mr Reed). She’s charming with just the right nervous edge to her, even though her storyline has also been changed enormously from the book, giving her doubts about her forthcoming marriage. She has a new sidekick in the form of Hugh Hornbeam played by Aidan McArdle instead of a husband and a new romance element has been written in here. To some extent it works and perhaps even fits with the concept of love in the book but again I’m not really sure it adds a great deal.\n\nOne slight note is that Phillip Davis as Dr Kennedy is very good but given the nature of his character and his unwholesome obsession, perhaps making him so creepy with a hurried, perspiring look, might stand out a little too much, particularly given the reason for his actions.\n\nThere are a few more adaptations in other languages, such as the French version of Les Petits Meurtres d’Agatha Christie which features Larosiere and Lampion and makes no suggestion that it follows the original books. There is also a Syrian version and, of course, the Japanese animated version which I will leave you to discover yourselves.\n\nI will just quickly mention the wonderful 2001 audio play featuring June Whitfield as Miss Marple. She is an excellent Marple and has done many audio versions of Agatha Christie’s work. They’re definitely worth seeking out. Julian Glover is perfect in this version as Dr Kennedy.\n\nWhatever the true history is of this book, it still captivates and leaves that beautiful sense of loss and love. Agatha Christie in her autobiography says she ‘had written an extra two books during the first years of the war’ and that ‘those two books, when written, were put in the vaults of a bank.’ I’m afraid I’m inclined to always believe everything Agatha Christie said. But as Miss Marple warned, ‘It really is very dangerous to believe people. I never have for years.’\n\nAdapting Agatha 8 – The Moving Finger\n\n*** There will be some SPOILERS in the following***\n\nYesterday was the anniversary of the death of Agatha Christie in 1976 and so I thought it might be fitting to remember her by looking at one of her favourite novels – The Moving Finger. In her autobiography she says, ‘I find that another I am really pleased with is The Moving Finger. It is a great test to re-read what one has written some seventeen or eighteen years before. One’s view changes. Some do not stand the test of time, others do.’ It really is what most authors are hoping for, that their books will stand the test of time and this one does so perfectly.\n\nWritten in 1942, like many of Agatha Christie’s works, its first publication was a serialisation (Colliers Weekly). It was first published as a book in America in 1942 and in the UK in 1943. Set in the classic English village of Lymstock in Devon it is told by a young pilot, Jerry Burton, who is injured and comes to the village with his sister, Joanna, to recover. This, of course, was one of Agatha Christie’s books which was published during the Second World War so why is it that this book has withstood the test of time so well? It is the subject matter at its heart that is still so fresh and familiar. As soon as the Burton’s arrive, they receive a poison pen letter accusing them of not being siblings at all but rather lovers. They soon discover that this sleepy little village has been under siege by the writer of these anonymous letters. One by one, each villager is accused of a host of indiscretions. This book plays beautifully with the very familiar idea that behind those quaint little English gardens and chintz curtains there are secrets. It is not so perfect as it looks. Village life and the intricate web of lies and whispered gossip that so often exists is put under the microscope here. How easy it is to start a rumour, even if it is unfounded. It is a classic Agatha Christie setting with a very relatable theme that is still very much alive to this day. Village gossip.\n\nOf course, it being Agatha Christie, it appears to have deadly consequences. Mrs Symmington, wife of the village solicitor, is found dead with one of the anonymous letters, a bottle of cyanide and a note saying ‘I can’t go on.’ A suicide verdict is brought in. This is another layer of commentary on village life that Agatha Christie introduces. The terrible consequences that can result from such a dangerous game. Gossip and idle chatter is harmful. Then there is the further layer, when the maid is found dead, the police make the classic assumption that if it is a vicious neighbourhood gossip, it must be a middle-aged woman. Of course, it’s ripe ground for our assumptions to be played with so we over-look all the clues. The letters cloud our judgement of what we really should be able to see and when we do, we realise that we don’t have that ability to push aside the irrelevant chatter. We listen to it. Only Miss Marple can clear away all the mist and see it for what it really is.\n\nThis is a fantastic book with so many hidden layers. There are a host of wonderful characters and a setting that is perfect Agatha Christie. And, of course, there is Miss Marple at her very best. Which makes it a fabulous book to be adapted. There are three main adaptations. The Joan Hickson Miss Marple version of 1985; Geraldine McEwan’s version in 2006 for Agatha Christie’s Marple; and the June Whitfield 2001 radio adaptation. There is also a French TV series Les petits meurtres d’Agatha Christie and although these were popular, they do not feature Miss Marple and it is a very loose adaptation.\n\nThe first adaptation for television was the Joan Hickson version in 1985 which was a two part adaptation. This was her second outing as Miss Marple, the first being The Body in the Library, and the marvellous relationship between this actor and the producer Guy Slater is already on full display. The adaptation was helped enormously by Agatha Christie’s daughter, Rosalind Hicks’ close working relationship with the production. Joan Hickson is fabulous in the role, showing her shrewd intellect alongside a wonderful sense of humour. It’s so beautifully observed, particularly given that in the original novel, Miss Marple is missing for a large part. There are some other notably good characters played here by Michael Culver as Edward Symmington; the wonderful Sabrina Franklyn as Joanna Burton; and Deborah Appleby is a very good Megan.\n\nBut it’s the setting itself and the atmosphere created around Miss Marple that is also stand out in this production. There is that immediate sense of a pretty little village community hiding nasty secrets in the famous credits that at first seem like harmless watercolours but on further inspection reveal a more sinister intent. Nether Wallop is as always the perfect backdrop for the quintessential English village ready to play host to a series of vile murders and intrigue. It’s a familiar, reassuring setting that lures us in beautifully and then the deaths begin. This version was almost universally applauded and Joan Hickson has remained the gold standard for productions of Miss Marple.\n\nSo it was very much a mindful decision to bring a different interpretation to the Agatha Christie’s Marple series. This has not been without its critics, not least of all because Miss Marple is inserted into adaptations of books she never appeared in and whole plot lines and murderers were changed. Purists find this utterly reprehensible. And whilst some of the thinking behind creating something new rather than trying to present a second rate copy of the Joan Hickson versions, is laudable, there are some mis-steps. However, The Moving Finger is not one of them. Geraldine McEwan is pitch perfect in her portrayal of a very delicate, almost bird-like Miss Marple who twitters around the village but her razor sharp intellect suddenly cuts through a scene. Like Joan Hickson, she is shrewd and determined whilst being the most inoffensive, polite and kind old lady we find so easy to imagine as one of our own delightful old relatives.\n\nThis is a far more stylised version than the Joan Hickson version. It’s set after the war and the fashions are beautifully recreated. Emilia Fox, no stranger to Agatha Christie adaptations, is fabulously stylish as Joanna Burton, with her bright red lipstick and pinch waist skirts.\n\nSo too is Kelly Brook and Talulah Riley who blossoms with a trip to the dressmakers! This really is an all star cast. Ken Russell puts in a delightfully disturbing turn as the vicar with his wife played by Frances de la Tour; Sean Pertwee is a brilliantly earnest Dr Griffith; John Sessions is a perfect Mr Pye; and Harry Enfield is surprisingly good as Mr Symmington. The role of the books narrator, however, was somewhat changed in character which not everyone agrees with. Jerry Burton is played by James d’Arcy but this time we see him as a self-destructive, somewhat self-absorbed, drunk who has attempted to take his life. In some respects, it is a representation of the post-war misery many young men suffered. However, is this the place for that analysis? It is a little jarring to have the representation of a quiet idyll with the usual array of characters and then introduce such a tortured soul. It seems to be the way with more modern adaptations that the emotional turmoil of some of the characters has to be played up much more. Arguably though, there is scope within the depiction of some of the people who are so disturbed that they are driven to kill.\n\nPutting this aside, this is a very fun, stylish adaptation that is one of the best this series produced, not least of all because it doesn’t veer too far away from the original work as many of the later productions did.\n\nI must also mention, finally, the wonderful June Whitfield radio version of 2001. This, as with all her outings as Miss Marple, is pitch perfect and evokes the village atmosphere beautifully. It is almost as if Miss Marple were sitting down to read the book to you herself. A fantastic version.\n\nThank you very much for reading and, as always, if you have any comment I’d love to hear them.\n\nAdapting Agatha 7 – A Bundle of Fun!\n\nNovember 30, 2020victoriadowdEdit”Adapting Agatha 7 – A Bundle of Fun!”\n\nAs with all the Adapting Agatha series, I’ll begin with a ***SPOILER ALERT ***. I find it almost impossible to talk meaningfully about individual adaptations without giving away at least something. I would hate to do so and spoil future readers’ enjoyment of the novels. So if you haven’t done already, please read The Secret of Chimneys and The Seven Dials Mystery before reading on!\n\nThe adaptation of The Secret of Chimneys for the Marple series in 2010 could on first inspection be said to have it all, perhaps too much. The perfect setting of a wonderful country house, Chimneys; there’s a ball; cocktails; jewels; murder; and the usual star-studded cast. And, of course, Miss Marple. And, although Julia McKenzie isn’t my favourite Miss Marple, my feelings don’t run as deep as many Agatha Christie fans who were very upset by this particular adaptation. Some refuse to even watch it. Why? Because it’s not a Miss Marple book at all. The Secret of Chimneys does not have Miss Marple in it at all, but as with The Seven Dials Mystery, it features Lady Eileen Brent, known as ‘Bundle’, and Superintendent Battle, along with a host of other characters who appear in both books. The adaptation of The Secret of Chimneys was another episode of the Marple series that continued with the idea that all of Agatha Christie’s books were fair game and could be used and filleted in any fashion to attract new audiences. It was seen more as a body of work to be adapted rather than each stand-alone book. Quite apart from it not being a Miss Marple book, the murderer is changed, huge parts of the plot are altered, a large section of a different story, The Herb of Death is slotted in and many of the characters are changed. So can this really still be called an adaptation of the novel by Agatha Christie bearing the name The Secret of Chimneys?\n\nAfter Chorion bought shares in Agatha Christie Ltd, adaptations took a whole new direction from 2004 onwards. From the very beginning, the Marple series had made huge changes to plot and character in many of the adaptations. The Secret of Chimneys was not the first time Miss Marple had been squeezed into a story that she’d never been in before.\n\nThe general approach of all these adaptations was to bring something new, something different to the Miss Marple character. It could well have been through fear of looking like a poor imitation of the Joan Hickson adaptations. Gemma Jones was always mooted as a favourite to play Miss Marple but was considered too close to Joan Hickson’s interpretation to risk. However, throughout the long running series which began with Geraldine McKewan in 2004 and ended with Julia McKenzie in 2013, the producers hadn’t been afraid to take risks in other areas and go in new directions. Many of the stories they adapted for Marple were not Miss Marple books at all. Even for the productions where they were, changes to era, characters and plot were often quite extreme. Many Agatha Christie fans see this as sacrilegious and attempting to use the name Marple for productions that bear little resemblance to Agatha Christie’s original work. Some fans are outraged at the use of Agatha Christie’s material to cobble together something `new.’ I’ve touched on this before in previous articles. I don’t believe in the idea one fan mooted of ‘Joan Hickson is Miss Marple. The end.’ I would never want to see an end to Agatha Christie adaptations. I love nothing better than a new Agatha Christie adaptation, given how many times I’ve watched the old ones! It’s always interesting to see a new dynamic or take on the books. And, in fairness, there’s a lot to love in the Marple series. They’re great fun, with a host of fabulous actors. The settings are magnificent and very reminiscent of the books. And they did indeed bring in a whole new audience. But many fans see them as verging on pastiche, particularly the ones, such as The Secret of Chimneys, where the era is shifted and some believe the whole production begins to take on the feel of a parody rather than an adaptation.\n\nThe Secret of Chimneys was written in 1925 and is an exciting mix of murder mystery and treasure hunt with a healthy dose of espionage thrown in for good measure. There’s blackmail, murders, Kings and fictional countries. Agatha Christie uses Herzoslovakia as she does more than once in her books. There’s even the Koh-i-Noor diamond stolen from the Tower of London. Misdirection, concealed identities and international conspiracies mix together to create what Agatha Christie called ‘the light-hearted thriller type.’ It has echoes of The Thirty Nine Steps, with its secret societies and codes. There’s even a flavour of The Prisoner of Zenda with the Balkan intrigues and characters. There’s a touch of Sherlock Holmes, indeed one of the characters is even called Holmes, and the cast of characters with their bright-young-things vibe has definite echoes of P.G. Wodehouse. So you can see from page one that it’s not the standard, tightly plotted Agatha Christie novel.\n\nLady Eileen Brent, aka Bundle, features in this novel and is even more central in the follow up book, The Seven Dials Mystery. Both are set at Chimneys, which is based on Abney Hall in Cheshire, and both feature many of the same characters.\n\nBundle is at the centre of the bright-young-things group. In The Secret of Chimneys she is nineteen years old (she talks about being twelve in an incident that occurred seven years ago). Bill Eversleigh says of her, ‘She’s simply it.’ As in the ‘It Girl.’ She’s the kind of girl who drives a wonderful sports car far too fast. In The Seven Dials Mystery she even thinks she’s run someone over, but is relieved to discover they’ve only been shot! She’s attractive, receiving two proposals of marriage in The Seven Dials Mystery. And smart enough to be made an offer to become one of the seven dials herself at the end of the book. She’s fantastic fun as well. Lomax, aka ‘Codders’ who is one of her proposed suitors, says of her in The Secret of Chimneys, she’s ‘charming, simply charming.’ However, he does go on to say she’s ‘quite a child.’ But by the time we meet her four years later in The Seven Dials Mystery she is much more mature and is, in fact, the heroine of that book. She has changed in those years. It’s interesting to note that The Secret of Chimneys was released the year before Agatha Christie’s famous disappearance and the turbulence that erupted in her life. There is a subtle change in Bundle’s character by the time we see her again in Seven Dials. She is less the little girl and more competent, worldly wise, brave. However, it’s fair to say that there’s still that element of mischief. She’s still only twenty-three – a little reckless and definitely still `simply it.’\n\nIn the 1981 film of The Seven Dials Mystery, directed by Tony Wharmby, Bundle is played beautifully by Cheryl Campbell. She’s wide-eyed, young, vivacious and fiercely bright. She’s the perfect mix of scatty and sharp. This was another all-star production with Sir John Gielgud, Harry Andrews and Rula Lenska. It received 17.6 million viewers but there were still sceptics who thought this was a ‘minor Christie’ to choose to adapt and that such a stellar production should have been reserved for a more well-known Agatha Christie.\n\nBundle is also performed beautifully in the 2005 audio book by Emilia Fox. She’s absolutely perfect and is `simply it.’ It would have been wonderful to see her perform the role on screen.\n\nUnfortunately, this production does suffer a little, as many audio books do, from the fact that she also has to perform all the male characters but that’s easily overlooked as the rest of the production is superb.\n\nSadly, Bundle is another one of the major problems with the 2010 adaptation for the Marple series. This time she is played by Dervla Kirwan, who is generally wonderful in most things, but unfortunately she is entirely unsuited to this role and plays it with a surly unhappiness.\n\nShe’s much older than in the books, although it is set in 1955 looking back to the ball of 1932. There is no joie de vivre, no mischief and her role is hugely played down. That is, of course, in no small part due to the fact that Miss Marple has suddenly popped up in her story when she should not be there. Making room for Miss Marple in your murder mystery is bound to lead to casualties. And Bundle is the main one. Side-lined and demoted to a new role of sister of Lady Virginia. Bundle does have sisters in the book, two Dulcie and Daisy, but not Virginia – she’s George’s cousin in the books. Lady Virginia is also thrown into the spotlight and to some extent steals Bundle’s place. Add to this another detective, Inspector Finch (changed from Superintendent Battle), and it really is a case of two many sleuths spoil the plot. Finch is played wonderfully though by Stephen Dillane and is very cool, detached and thoughtful. The interplay between him and Miss Marple is, however, a little stilted and again there is that feeling that there are too many detectives in this production. It must be one of the only times in my life I’ve ever considered a situation might be better without Miss Marple in it, which is rather inconvenient given this is an episode of Marple!\n\nThe rest of the cast is very good but the huge changes to the plot completely change the nature of their characters. The murderer is changed, which casts one of the characters in a very different light and leads to the espionage aspect being a side issue to the murder and more of a red herring. The huge swathes of plot that are changed, lead to some plot holes and this being a very different experience to the book. It’s probably more appropriate to say it’s based on the works of Agatha Christie rather than an actual adaptation of one of her novels, which is a shame because this is a very good book indeed. Sadly, given the nature of the plot changes, particularly in regard to the identity of the murderer, it leaves it very difficult to imagine an adaptation of The Seven Dials Mystery could in any way have stemmed from this. Which is a great shame as that is a wonderful book.\n\nThere is one other adaptation of The Secret of Chimneys which I must mention and that is one written by Agatha Christie herself. It’s a play called simply Chimneys which she wrote in 1931but was only rediscovered recently by the artistic director of a the Vertigo Mystery Theatre, John Paul Fischbach and, consequently, was never performed until 2003. The full wonderful story of how it was unearthed is here and is definitely worth a read. It’s to be hoped that one day this is adapted for the screen and will do more justice to the novel than the 2010 adaptation.\n\nThank you so much for reading and look out for something a little different in the run up to Christmas. I’ll be choosing my top ten Agatha Christie novels alongside my top ten crime novels of this year in my Jingle all the Slay murder mystery post (and yes, I am calling it that. It’s almost Christmas!)\n\nAdapting Agatha 6: Hallowe’en Party\n\nOctober 21, 2020victoriadowdEdit”Adapting Agatha 6: Hallowe’en Party”\n\nHello everyone. I hope you’re well and welcome to another Adapting Agatha article. I’ll include the usual ***SPOILER ALERT*** so if you haven’t already read this one, or watched it, I’d urge you to do so before reading any further – also, because it’s a great book and adaptation and both are well worth seeking out.\n\nAs we head into the darker nights and Hallowe’en approaches, I thought it might be quite fun to look at Agatha Christie’s Hallowe’en Party this time and its adaptations. This isn’t one of her most well-known novels and there aren’t quite as many adaptations as there are of some of the greats. It’s also one of her later works. First serialised in Woman’s Own in 1969 and then published the same year by Collins Crime Club in the UK. Sadly, it wasn’t particularly well reviewed. Some describing it as a ‘disappointment.’ Obviously, Agatha Christie fans loved it though. It’s one of Poirot’s last outings and some suggested that Poirot himself seems ‘weary’ (Toronto Daily Star). That’s possibly not too surprising given that on H.R.F Keating’s estimates, Poirot must have been about 124 years old!\n\nThere is a definite sense of the winds of change in society that might not be taking everyone with them. This is Poirot in the late 1960s. The year this novel appeared was the year man first stepped on the moon, the Beatles gave their last performance on top of the Apple Building, Concorde appeared. It’s the year of Woodstock, with sex and drugs and rock n’roll, and the year of Charles Manson. Even murder had a very different face to the one usually associated with Agatha Christie.\n\nThere are numerous references in the book to a world that is moving on and perhaps not in the right direction, at least according to some of its characters. There is a lot of commentary on society and justice, how many people are now free to roam the streets who would previously not have been. Capital punishment had ended in 1965, so unlike most of Agatha Christie’s murderers, these ones would not face the noose. There is frequent reference to how unsafe children now are, taking lifts from strangers and sensational reports on such things in the media. Interestingly though, it is Mrs Drake herself who voices her disquiet about the dangers lurking for children nowadays – she is in fact the child’s murderer when she says this.\n\nThere are even references to computers sneaking in – Ariadne Oliver refers to how much like one Poirot is. She, however, casts doubt on whether they are in fact a good thing. As we know, the wonderful crime writer Ariadne is often used as Agatha Christie’s own mouthpiece. She gives a very beautiful aside on the nature of being a crime writer with a foreign detective when someone asks her why she chose a Finn, she says ruefully, ‘I’ve often wondered.’ Perhaps a little comment on the Belgian detective. Agatha Christie basically talks straight to the reader through Ariadne Oliver when she says, ‘Now, if I was going to make a book about all these people, how should I do it?’ There then follows an extremely funny interlude where various people openly comment on Ariadne’s books to her, clearly something Agatha Christie, and I might add, most crime writers have experienced! ‘I read one of your books,’ one character tells Ariadne. ‘It was quite good.’ Joyce then goes on to add. ‘I didn’t like that one.’ I can say from personal experience, this is a very realistic scenario. People are not shy of giving crime writer’s their opinion and suggesting much better plots and this was obviously something Agatha Christie would have had a lifetime of by this point in her career.\n\nThis is in many ways a more reflective book than some of her earlier ones. There is very much the sense of a career’s worth of experience and knowledge. But also a life that was watching the world change very quickly. Aside from the concerns over increase in violent crime and the way children are being brought up, there are other comments on small every day changes such as the fact that pumpkins at Hallowe’en are this new novelty from America (although still seen primarily on Thanksgiving). There are little insights into the author’s views on this brave new world and how she feels about it, ‘nowadays things always happen to frustrate one,’ Ariadne says. Although there are some small differences between Ariadne Oliver and Agatha Christie (particularly her booming voice which was very different to the author’s) there is an undoubted resemblance and we can see in this book a more world weary voice coming through. Agatha Christie was seventy-nine years old when this book was written and published. This book sees both the author and Poirot concerned for this new modern world of the late 60s that is changing so fast. They are old. ‘Many of the evenings were dull, now, Hercule Poirot thought.’\n\nIt’s no surprise then, that the most notable adaptation of this book is set in the 1930s instead of the 60s. The 2010 David Suchet version takes the viewers back to that Golden Age and, I hesitate to say, this is one of the few occasions when I think the adaptation might just be a little more enjoyable for it. Whilst it isn’t my favourite Agatha Christie book, and I don’t think it is many people’s, it is one of the best David Suchet Poirot episodes and a magnificent performance from him, which is measured to absolute perfection. The Mark Gatiss screenplay is incredibly atmospheric. The unsettling, constant whispered chant of ‘Snip Snap dragon’ from the children playing snapdragon, brings a very spooky, Hallowe’en feel to the action. Poirot himself is listening to a ghost story on the radio, which sounds suspiciously like Mr Gatiss himself is reading it. Even the end Poirot music is adapted slightly to give it a Dance Macabre edge.\n\nThere is a slight problem with moving the action to the 30s rather than the 60s, in that Hallowe’en parties and dressing as green faced witches would not really have been a practice then. Agatha Christie herself tells us that the pumpkin carving ritual isn’t entirely popular at Hallowe’en even in America at the time of the book and is still really associated with Thanksgiving. However, I think we can forgive this as the added atmosphere and creepy Hallowe’en feel is magnificently dramatic and works to make the story far more sinister. There are graveyards, pumpkin phantoms and the character of Mrs Goodbody is enhanced to make her genuinely witch-like. In the book she is simply a cleaner who is expected at the party and asked to dress up as a witch, rather than the frightening crone who bursts in. Garfield warns us that Matthew Hopkins, the Witchfinder General, was very active around that area with ‘ducking stools and drowning.’ He then goes on to explain how the ducking stool works.\n\nOther somewhat ghoulish characters are added, such as Rowena Drake’s truly awful children Edmund Drake and, the hilariously named sister, Frances Drake. Edmund tells us ‘Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live,’ as he reads from a book entitled Witchfinder General Matthew Hopkins. Poirot even begins his denouement with the magnificent, ‘It was a dark and stormy night.’ He tells us this is a ‘tale of carnage and horror’ with ‘the garden drenched in the blood of the innocent.’\n\nThis dramatic, almost Hammer Horror style adaptation, is gloriously spooky, just as one would expect from a Mark Gatiss screenplay. In his 2010 BBC documentary, A History of Horror, he referred to the 1968 film Witchfinder General as an example of what he called the sub-genre ‘folk horror,’ which this episode definitely has undertones of – a sleepy village with the local witch and a strange party that leads to death has echoes of The Wicker Man, which Mark Gatiss also groups in this unholy trinity of films. One of the final scenes, involving Garfield abducting Miranda with the purpose of sacrificing her, has grotesque masks, gowns and a very ethereal caped girl who is almost spirit-like. Another example of Agatha Christie referencing child abduction by unlikely villains lurking ready to pounce on the innocent.\n\nMichael Garfield is played wonderfully by Julian Rhind-Tutt (no stranger to Agatha Christie adaptations – most notably in Ordeal by Innocence.) Although he doesn’t have the dark hair and sculpted beard of the book, he is the very ‘beautiful’ man who captivates the women of the neighbourhood. He has that strange, enigmatic quality that ensnares so many of the characters and leads to their demise. Beauty is very much a theme of both the book and this adaptation. His crazed passion for beauty and it’s creation is almost madness. Bodies buried in his beloved garden are merely ‘compost’ for his beautiful creation. But he too inspires madness and obsession in so many, particularly those such as Rowena Drake who is willing to kill a child, willing to sacrifice anything for this man. Deborah Findlay plays this to perfection. Although she doesn’t have the golden hair tinged with grey or the blue eyes Agatha Christie gave her, she is very much the type who might be a stern magistrate, as she is imagined in the book. She is also clinging to her looks, her beauty, her attraction. Like other characters in the book such as the landlord’s wife, she is an older woman trying to feel loved and adored. ‘Getting perhaps a bit long in the tooth,’ as the landlord’s wife is described but liked her men ‘young.’ There is this constant theme of the corruption of the innocent, of striving to capture beauty and that is presented perfectly in this 2010 adaptation.\n\nThere are some quite significant changes to plot and character but this TV version stays true to the feeling of the book. Notably, Michael Garfield doesn’t commit suicide but is taken away, perhaps Agatha Christie still needed her murderers to die but TV audiences don’t now. Other changes include, the addition of a vicar; Superintendent Spence is removed (which is rather sad as he featured in the previous Mrs McGinty’s Dead); Olga is not found in a well but beneath the beloved garden; the garden itself becomes part of Rowena Drake’s estate rather than a converted quarry; Miss Whittaker, played by the fabulous Fenella Woolgar, witnesses the dropping of the vase by Mrs Drake not Ariadne Oliver; and the death of Rowena Drake’s husband is quite sensibly explained as being committed by Garfield. This is by no means an exhaustive list of the changes.\n\nBut perhaps one of the most unusual decisions is to have Ariadne Oliver sick in bed for much of this adaptation. Zoe Wanamaker is a perfect Ariadne though, as she is in other adaptations, and her little asides concerning being an author are absolutely wonderful. One particular scene involving the cold ridden Ariadne sitting up in bed surrounded by edits grumbling about her ‘child of an editor’ is perfect and later her noting that ‘writers are prone to wild ideas’ steps over into that meta world she inhabits in Agatha Christie’s books.\n\nBut despite its plot and character changes, this adaptation stays very faithful to the atmosphere of the book, if not enhancing it even further. That small village claustrophobia and strange local tradition and folklore is fabulously captured. It is wonderful viewing for a ‘dark and stormy night’ and pays homage very subtly to the ghostly and ghoulish films of yesteryear. It is, sadly, the only TV adaptation there has been of this book and there are no films of it. I suspect its strange quirky take on old traditions would not appeal to the new Kenneth Branagh Poirot film audiences who expect a little more luxury and adventure from their Agatha Christie movies in the form of the Nile or the Orient Express. But if you’re looking for the quintessential English village with all its history and resentments, jealousies and obsessions – this is one for you.\n\nThere is, also, a fantastic audio book narrated by Hugh Fraser (Captain Hastings) and a full cast version that is brilliant starring John Moffatt as Poirot and Stephanie Cole as Ariadne Oliver. These two are both worth seeking out and listening to – perhaps on a ‘dark and stormy night.’\n\nAdapting Agatha 5 – Evil Under the Sun. A tribute to Dame Diana Rigg\n\nSeptember 12, 2020victoriadowdEdit”Adapting Agatha 5 – Evil Under the Sun. A tribute to Dame Diana Rigg”\n\nIt was a huge sadness to hear of the death of Dame Diana Rigg – a glorious actress in so many ways. Not just beautiful but immensely talented, with an effortless glamour that was magnetic. She had an inherently intelligent, astute nature that meant she could play in Shakespeare, The Worst Witch and Game of Thrones with equal grace, intellect and a truly beguiling screen presence. She was both Emma Peel and James Bond’s on screen wife. This column is all about Agatha Christie adaptations and I had begun work on writing about Evil under the Sun when the sad news broke that Dame Diana Rigg had sadly passed away. I had considered not putting this out but I thought it might serve as my small tribute to her in one of her most iconic roles and one loved so very much by Agatha Christie fans. How very fortunate we are to have her as Arlena Stuart forever. She embodies the character Agatha Christie wrote.\n\nAs usual I will begin with a ***SPOILER*** alert. I find it almost impossible to talk about adaptations without giving something away so please don’t continue if you haven’t read the book or seen the films. It’s a good one!!\n\nThe 1982 version of Evil Under the Sun is one of the best adaptations of her novels. This is Agatha Christie at her best, an island populated by the good, the bad and the suspicious, there’s a death and everyone has a motive. It’s Hercule Poirot at his finest too, in full holiday mode and sipping cocktails whilst analysing his fellow guests’ every move. The movie star, Arlena Stuart now Marshall after her recent marriage, is perfectly played by Diana Rigg. She is the icon, the demandingly gorgeous superstar who can command a room just by walking through it. One of the most magnificent moments in the film is when she sings You’re the Top to a room of captivated guests. Dame Maggie Smith, playing the wonderful hotel owner, Daphne Castle decides to join in and the most fantastic duel of the divas ensues. It is a classic scene.\n\nThe two great actresses are wonderful in these roles and deliver some fabulous lines such as:\n\nArlena Stuart: Oh, dear! I’m the last to arrive.\n\nDaphne Castle: Have a sausage. You must be starving having to wait all that time in your room.\n\nIncidentally, a small piece of Agatha Christie adaptation trivia is that the children of both these wonderful actresses appeared together in a later Agatha Christie adaptation – the 1989 Poirot episode of Five Little Pigs in which Toby Stephens (Maggie Smith’s son) was cast alongside Rachael Stirling (Diana Rigg’s daughter).\n\nIn every scene that Diana Rigg is in, she is utterly enthralling. Her costumes are magnificent, she is groomed to perfection and the audience immediately knows this is an icon in her prime.\n\nBut she does, as with every major Agatha Christie adaption, have the benefit of a magnificent cast. There are some wonderful performances in this version. Colin Blakely is fabulous as ‘muck and brass’ Sir Horace Blatt; James Mason is very suave as Odell Gardner and some have suggested that he takes on a very ‘meta’ voice in that he outlines the principles of the ‘whodunnit’ for the author; Jane Birkin and Nicholas Clay are very convincing, beautiful murderers; Maggie Smiths’ Daphne Castle (an amalgamation of Mrs Castle and Rosamund Darnley of the books) is a perfect blend of brash and heart-warming; and Roddy McDowall is on flying form as the flamboyant Rex Brewster. This character has been changed to a man for the movie instead of being Emily Brewster. A few other characters have been dropped entirely, including Reverend Lane and Major Barry. Then, of course, there is Peter Ustinov’s Poirot.\n\nPeter Ustinov appeared as the Belgian sleuth six times. There were three made for TV movies (Thirteen at Dinner, Dead Man’s Folly and Murder in Three Acts). Thirteen at Dinner was based on Lord Edgware Dies and also starred David Suchet as Inspector Japp. Peter Ustinov had previously appeared as Poirot in the magnificent Death on the Nile in 1978 (also starring Jane Birkin and Maggie Smith). However, Christie’s daughter Rosalind Hicks observed Ustinov during a rehearsal and said, “That’s not Poirot! He isn’t at all like that!” Ustinov overheard and remarked “He is now!“\n\nFor many, sadly, Peter Ustinov did not embody the Poirot of the books. His version was fun, endearing and extremely charming but was not the Hercule Poirot of the books. There is a comical, almost farcical nature to him at times. He is the bon viveur on tour, the reluctant celebrity who performs magic tricks with eggs for children. In some ways, he appears as a comedy version of a bombastic colonel at times veering into a musical hall or Carry On persona. The scene where he pretends to swim is somewhat ridiculous, particularly given the bathing suit which Peter Ustinov himself designed, complete with hat. The character of Poirot in the books does, of course, have a lighter side to him and at times his slightly eccentric behaviour is marvelled at by others. This is a new and criticised aspect of the Kenneth Branagh version of Poirot but those traits are there in the books. However, I feel they were somewhat over-played in this Peter Ustinov adaptation. The whole tone of the film is, although fun, a little tongue in cheek.\n\nThat said, it is a joy of film that didn’t do particularly well at the box office but has a huge cult following amongst many fans. Sadly, this Guy Hamilton version put an end to the franchise of producers John Brabourne and Richard Goodwin which is sad as it comes through very strongly just how much fun the cast and production crew were having on this film.\n\nIn 1999 the excellent Joh Moffatt starred in the radio adaptation that had a fabulous Iain Glen as Patrick Redfern and Fiona Fullerton as Arlena Marshall. I would have loved to see these actors play in a TV or film adaptation. They are absolutely perfect in the roles and it’s a wonderful radio play I would recommend to anyone.\n\nUnusually, this is one of the very few occasions that I would say the David Suchet 2001 version does not quite live up to the earlier 1982 film. David Suchet is a far more nuanced Poirot and has had the advantage of an enormous number of years to carry this character forward and really embody the role. For some, he is the Poirot. However, his version of Evil Under the Sun is not quite as fulfilling as the 1982 film version.\n\nThe setting, however, for this David Suchet version, is one of my favourites and one I have spoken about before in this column – Burgh Island, the Devon Island that inspired Agatha Christie. Pixie Cove is based on The Mermaid Pool (which I’ve recently had the honour of swimming in but I’ll save you from the photos of that!)\n\nIt’s also the island that inspired And Then There Were None. This David Suchet version of Evil Under the Sun is beautifully shot there. He travels over on the fantastic sea tractor and what better way can there be to journey to a hotel? It’s the most unique and wonderful way to arrive and on the way over you can even see the beach hut where Agatha Christie "
