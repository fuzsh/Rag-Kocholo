        "text": "Tameka Empson is a fan favourite on EastEnders, with her character known for her funny wit and heartfelt gestures.\n\nKim Fox has faced many challenges on the soap, from her husband Vincent Hubbard's disappearance, suffering a miscarriage and giving birth to baby girl, Pearl, prematurely.\n\nHowever, not much is known about her life away from the soap.\n\nRead more: Inside EastEnders star Colin Salmon’s 35-year marriage with wife and career change\n\nHow old is Tameka and where is she from?\n\nTameka was born on 15 April 1977, making him 46 years old. She is originally from London in England.\n\nHer parents immigrated to England from the Ivory Coast, before welcoming the EastEnders star.\n\nThe soap star has two sisters, named Margaret and Emilia Jane.\n\nWhen she was younger, she joined the Anna Scher Theatre School, a performing arts school based in Islington, Greater London. She began studying there at the age of seven in 1985.\n\nWhat has Tameka acted in?\n\nOne of Tameka’s first acting credits was in 1996, when she appeared in the film Beautiful Thing. She played Leah Russell, the next-door neighbour of the main characters.\n\nTwo years later, she acted in the 1998 film Babymother, where she was the love rival to the main character.\n\nOver the years, she has also starred in many theatrical productions, including as Billie in the original cast of Our House, a musical featuring songs from the ska/pop band Madness.\n\nIn 2008, Tamela appeared in the BBC sitcom Beautiful People and in the thriller show Whitechapel, before landing the role of Kim Fox, the half-sister of Denise Fox, in EastEnders.\n\nShe has remained on the programme since 2009, and has won several awards from 2011’s Inside Soap Awards for Funniest Performance and 2022 British Soap Awards’s award for Best Comedy Performance.\n\nHow many children does Tameka have?\n\nTameka has two children, a nearly three-year-old son and a daughter named Nylah who turned seven years old this year.\n\n“I've been contributing to the human race… I have a baby boy, a bouncing baby boy,” she shared on Loose Women.\n\nShe opened up about why she chose to keep her pregnancy private and away from sharing that she was expecting.\n\nThe actress added: “It wasn't so much deliberate. I just wanted to enjoy it. A baby comes and you want to enjoy it before everyone says, ‘How's he doing... etc..'' But now he's here and he's loud!’”\n\nTameka also spoke about what it was like welcoming a baby during lockdown.\n\n“[It's] a challenge... nothing prepares you for it,” she said.\n\n“My daughter is six and we're doing homeschooling, and then you've got a newborn and you've got to watch everything… he's sleeping now, which helps. I'm made of the good stuff, I've come through it OK.”\n\nGet the latest RSVP headlines straight to your inbox for free by signing up to our newsletter"
