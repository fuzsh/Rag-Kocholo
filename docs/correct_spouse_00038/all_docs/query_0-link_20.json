        "text": "Emilia Fox is an English actress with a career that spans film, television and theatre. With a filmography as long as her family’s movie history, Fox is a busy actress who may never have lost a job. Ever since breaking the news with her role as Dorota in the 2002 biopic, The Pianist, Emilia Fox has never looked back. She went on to impress with notable roles in films like The Soul Keeper which earned her her first ever award – the Flaiano Film Award for Best Actress. Since 2004, she has played Dr. Nikki Alexander in the BBC crime drama series, Silent Witness\n\nFamily of Emilia Fox, daughter\n\nEmilia Fox comes from a popular English actorEmpire. Her paternal grandfather, Robin Fox, was a theater agent, actor and the chairman of the English theater company. Her father, Edward Fox, is a stage, film and television actor. As of 2018, he remains quite active in the industry. He had a small role in the 2018 action film, Johnny English Strikes Again\n\nEmilia’s mother, Joanna David (née Joanna)Elizabeth Hacking) is an actress who is highly regarded for her work in television. His brother Frederick “Freddie” Fox is also an actor born on April 5, 1989. He is recognized for his theatrical performances. Emilia Fox has an actress, sister-in-law Lucy Fox, from her father’s first marriage to actresses Tracy Reed, who died of liver cancer in May 2012.\n\nFox’s uncle, Fox (her father’s brother) as well as her children (her cousins), Jack, Laurence and Lydia all have acting careers. Emilia Fox’s great-grandmother, Hilda Hanbury, and her sister, Lily Hanbury, were both actresses.\n\nEmilia Fox has a daughter named Rose Gilley from her relationship with actor Jeremy Gilley. Many believe Emilia’s daughter will grow up in her parents’ footsteps, but young Rose already seems to know what she wants and has described acting as a business rather than a job. Her mother made Rose’s thoughts on acting known during her interview on The Graham Norton Show in May 2018. She revealed that her daughter would rather go to college and have a regular job.\n\nIs she married, who is the partner or the husband?\n\nAs of this writing, Emilia Fox is a divorcee and a single mother. The actress is known for her many high profile relationships in the past. Although she is without a husband at the moment, Fox revealed during an interview with The Times UK in 2017 that she is open to establishing a relationship if the right person comes along.\n\nIn the same interview, Fox said that while her past relationships haven’t worked out the way she would have liked, she doesn’t view them as failures and has only learned from what she described as ” unique experiences”.\n\nHer high-profile relationship history dates back to the year 2000, when she started dating comedian Vic Reeves. They met on the set of the BBC One drama Randall & Hopkirk. With Reeves still married to someone else, he hired Emilia. However, they soon ended up making mutual decisions.\n\nEmilia Fox then briefly dated fashion designer Toby Mott before starting a relationship with actor Jared Harris, son of Irish actor Richard Harris. The couple married in 2005 in what turned out to be a short-lived marriage. They separated in 2008 and finalized their divorce in 2010. Fox would later blame their divorce on their long-distance relationship as well as a tragic miscarriage she suffered in 2007. She also revealed that she never paid attention to his emotions after the divorce.\n\nWith her divorce from Jared Harris finally, Emilia Fox began dating actor Jeremy Gilley, and in May 2010 it was announced that she was pregnant. She gave birth to a baby girl named Rose in November 2010. Unfortunately, welcoming a bundle of joy together wasn’t enough to cement their relationship, as the couple split in 2011.\n\nFox then moved on to celebrity chef Marco PierreWhite who she dated for a year between 2012 and 2013. Since their split, the actress seems to have slowed down her whirlwind romances and made her daughter Rose her priority."
