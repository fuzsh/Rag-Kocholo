She comes from a thespian family — her mother is actress Joanna David (née Joanne Elizabeth Hacking) and her father is actor Edward Fox. Her uncle is James Fox (set to appear in Merlin Series 5) and her cousins Laurence and Lydia also have successful acting careers. She has a brother Freddie and a half sister Lucy. She was educated at the independent Bryanston School and the University of Oxford where she studied English Literature.\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nShe had a relationship with Toby Mott.\n\nIn July 2005, she married British actor Jared Harris, the son of the deceased Irish actor Richard Harris. The couple announced their split in 2008 and Harris filed for divorce in January 2009. They divorced following the breakdown of their long-distance relationship and her miscarriage in 2007. Fox also had entered into a relationship with actor Jeremy Gilley. In May 2010 it was reported that Fox was pregnant with their child. The Harris-Fox divorce was final in June 2010.
