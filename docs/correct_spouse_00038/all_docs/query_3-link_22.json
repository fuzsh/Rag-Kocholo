        "text": "It might be the depths of winter, but actress Emilia Fox is dreaming of the hazy days of summer when she bonded – over cake – with Dawn French. The pair spent three months filming in idyllic Cornish villages and became firm friends, even though they were playing fierce love rivals in Sky’s new drama, Delicious.\n\n“We bonded straight away, appropriately over a slice of fruit cake, and from that moment it was a total joy to work with her,” says Emilia, 42. “Even at 5.30am, we’d natter away in the make-up chair.\n\n“As you can imagine with Dawn, there were some very funny moments. We did a very dramatic scene and I turned on my heel to flounce out and fell flat on my face. I tried to keep going even though she was howling with laughter – which was definitely not in the script.”\n\nIn the four-part series, Emilia plays Sam, who is married to philandering chef and hotel owner Leo (Iain Glen). Dawn is his ex-wife, Gina.\n\nBoth women have children by Leo and are doing their best to remain on cordial terms – until Sam discovers he is having an affair. She first assumes it is with the hotel’s glamorous young junior manager and is stunned to discover it is with the older Gina.\n\n“It’s been really interesting to be able to explore these characters,” says Emilia.\n\n“Gina is a woman in her fifties who is a sensual and passionate cook, and Sam is a woman in her forties who may look confident on the outside, but underneath is extremely fragile and vulnerable and suffers anxiety about getting older and having to work hard to remain attractive.\n\n“The drama is also about wives as mothers, being fierce lionesses protecting their children. At the heart of it is the story of a relationship between two women who love and lose the same man.\n\n“It deals with friendship, betrayal, parenting and being the ex, and I think they are things audiences will identify with and relate to because of the challenging and unpredictable highs and lows that life throws at you and the ever-changing complex relationships we have with each other.”\n\nThe actress has had her fair share of changing and complex relationships. Her exes include comedian Vic Reeves, to whom she was engaged in 2000, and artist and fashion designer Toby Mott.\n\nShe wed Mad Men’s Jared Harris in 2005, but split from him in 2008. In 2010, she gave birth to Rose, her daughter with actor Jeremy Gilley. She has recently been linked to chef Marco Pierre White, a relationship that is now reportedly over, but she is not keen to discuss her personal life today.\n\nThe relationship she will talk about, however, is the one with her daughter Rose, who is now six. They spent the summer holidays in a cottage in Cornwall. When she wasn’t filming in the Grade-II listed country house of Pentillie Castle and at Port Eliot, Emilia was off to the beach with Rose for some proper Enid Blyton-style adventures.\n\n“We went off exploring lots of lovely little secret coves together and hung out with my aunt and uncle and cousins, who live in Cornwall.\n\nEmilia Fox on crying in pub\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

What a dream job, eh?” Emilia laughs.\n\nHer other dream job has been as forensic pathologist Dr Nikki Alexander in the BBC crime drama Silent Witness, a role she has played since 2004. She will be returning to the show next year for the 20th series.\n\n“I’ve loved playing Nikki and I enjoy being part of that series, which has given me a wonderful stability and familiarity. That’s a joy as an actor,” she says. “Plus, I am so lucky because the studio is only five minutes away from my house in London, which means I can be home if I am not working or have a scene off.\n\nSo I can be there for tea, bath and bedtime with Rose, who is the most important part of my life.\n\n“Being a mother makes you grow, bloom and blossom in all sorts of ways. Your priorities change, of course. Rose comes first in every decision that is made. You live in the present with a child and I think you learn so much from children, seeing the world through their eyes.\n\n“I am constantly surprised by Rose’s observations on life. They are so true and to the point. And of course you have to make the jigsaw puzzle of life fit better because you are fitting someone else in. But what a pleasure.”\n\nSince having had her daughter, Emilia has reconnected with old friends who are themselves mothers. Her best friend – since her schooldays – is the actress Lara Cazalet.\n\n“We’ve known each other since we were 13 and now we are back at the school gates together, but this time with our daughters who go to the same school. Female friendships couldn’t be more important to me and you learn that true friends are there through the good and the hard times. They are invaluable,” she says.\n\nEmilia is also close to her cousin, Lewis actor Laurence Fox, formerly married to Billie Piper, and is planning to spend some time with him over the Christmas and New Year period.\n\n“I’ll definitely see my mum and dad and brother and sister over Christmas,” she says. “And I am pretty sure I will see Laurence and his boys, plus any other members of the family who are around. It is such a large family that everyone is always in different places, so we’ve never done anything all in the same room at the same time. That would be a first.”\n\nComing from an acting dynasty hasn’t always been easy for Emilia, who originally dismissed the idea of following in the footsteps of her actor parents, Joanna David and Edward Fox, and her two uncles, the actor James and the film producer Robert Fox.\n\n“I didn’t want to be an actor and wanted to avoid doing what everyone else in the family had done. I had grown up with my rose-tinted spectacles off about what the profession is like and the highs and the lows, unlike my brother Freddie, who wanted to act almost from the moment he was born,” she says.\n\nEmilia hadn’t really believed that acting was in the blood until she took part in the TV show Who Do You Think You Are? when she was pregnant.\n\n“I was really surprised to find out there is a whole family tree of people who have all gone into the same world and have a real love of it,” says Emilia, who learnt her great-grandmother Hilda and great-aunt Lilly were well-known actresses in their day. They also had a distant connection to Ellen Terry, the leading Shakespearean actress of her day.\n\nWhether her daughter follows in her footsteps is yet to be seen, but for now Emilia is revelling in the fact that Rose is happily settled into school life.\n\n“She has done her reception year where you are waving them off at the school gate and thinking, ‘Oh my God, how will I survive the day?’ The highlight of 2016 has to be her starting year one and going in through the school gates happy and with all her friends,” Emilia says. “You have to try and make the most of every moment in life and having a child makes you super-aware of that.”\n\nStrangely, Silent Witness had an impact on Emilia’s life in ways she could never have imagined. “Having been to autopsies and seen someone who loses their life at a completely untimely moment, the thought that I came away with was to make the most of your life. So I guess that’s what I am doing.”\n\nDelicious is on December 30 at 9pm on Sky 1."
