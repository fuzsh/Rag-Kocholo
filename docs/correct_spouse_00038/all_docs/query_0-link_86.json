        "text": "Emilia Fox has reportedly split from her fiance Luc Chaudhary 18 months after they met on celebrity dating app Raya.\n\nThe Silent Witness star, 46, got engaged to the talent agent last year and they had planned to marry in the summer of 2021.\n\nHowever, The Sun on Sunday reports the pair have now called it quits.\n\nA source told the publication: \"Emilia was disappointed to find they didn’t have a future but there’s no going back now. It’s over.\"\n\nThe paper reports Emilia has asked Luc to move out of the home they shared in London and returned her engagement ring to him.\n\nEmilia was previously married to actor Jared Harris. They wed in 2005 but parted ways three years later.\n\nTheir divorce was finalised in 2010. She also has a daughter, Rose, from her relationship with actor Jeremy Gilley who she dated from 2009 until 2012.\n\nShe also previously dated celebrity chef Marco Pierre White.\n\nSpeaking after her divorce from Harris, Emilia admitted she was excited about being back on the dating scene.\n\nShe told The Sun : \"It’s fun dating again and finding someone who you really enjoy being with. I love romance. I’m a great believer in second, third — even fourth chances at love.”\n\nEmilia also previously spoke about the difficulties of dating as a mum, admitting she was happy being single while Rose was small.\n\nShe told You magazine: \"When children are little, it is difficult, but you can be on your own and that can be a healthy thing.\n\n\"Too often the tendency is to jump from relationship to relationship and I love knowing that I am happy in my own company.\n\n\"Also, my responsibilities to Rose would be a massive consideration before I brought someone new into my life.\"\n\nMirror Online has contacted a representative for Emilia for comment."
