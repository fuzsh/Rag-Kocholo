        "text": "Emilia Fox has been playing the leading role of Dr. Nikki Alexander on Silent Witness for almost 20 years. But she's definitely not the only member of her family to grace our screens in recent years.\n\nThe Silent Witness actress, 48, is part of a thespian family, with both parents prominent actors. Her mother Joanna David, 75, recently featured in House of the Dragon as Lady Joselyn Redwyne. Her father Edward Fox, 85, starred in The Day of the Jackal, 1973.\n\nHer mother Joanna featured in Season 1, Episode 3 of House of the Dragon. She previously starred as Mrs. Gardiner in Pride and Prejudice - the adaptation featuring Colin Firth in 1995.\n\nRead More: Death In Paradise star Don Warrington has a famous soap star wife\n\nDiscover, learn, grow. We are Curiously. Follow us on TikTok, Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.\n\nEmilia is currently dating Netflix producer Jonathan Stadlen and lives in West London. Emilia said her new partner makes her \"heart dance\" due to the \"open and honest\" communication they share, she told Good Housekeeping.\n\nEmilia has been married once, to British actor Jared Harris, who played King George VI in The Crown. The pair were married for five years until 2010.\n\nThe actress has a 12-year-old daughter, Rose Gilley, who she had with Jeremy Gilley, 54, following the break up of her marriage in 2010. Jeremy is also an actor, filmmaker, and founder of the nonprofit organisation Peace One Day.\n\nMost well-known is Emila's connection to the controversial actor Laurence Fox who is her cousin. The actress appeared on Celebrity Gogglebox with Laurence in 2019.\n\nDuring the coronavirus pandemic, Laurence participated in anti-lockdown protests and opposed the George Floyd protests. He launched the Reclaim party, a political party that he said would defend freedom of speech and reform the BBC. This all led to him being dropped by his agent in November 2020.\n\nSpeaking about her cousin, Emilia told The Times : \"Laurence is my cousin, he's family and I love my family. I think he’d be the first to advocate that people can have different opinions on things.\n\n\"We've had very different life experiences and Laurence’s political life is nothing to do with my relationship with him. We’ve had some amazing times together and we’ve been very mutually supportive of our personal lives.\""
