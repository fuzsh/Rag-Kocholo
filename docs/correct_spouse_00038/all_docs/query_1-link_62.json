        "text": "Emilia Fox is best-known for playing Dr Nikki Alexander in the BBC detective drama Silent Witness. Long-time fans of the show will know that the 48-year-old actress from Hammersmith, London, took on her iconic role back in 2004, replacing Amanda Burton.\n\nSome fans of the star might be surprised to know that Emilia isn't the only actor in her family. She has very famous parents - actor Edward Fox known for The Day of the Jackal, and Joanna David who you might recognise from the 1995 series Pride and Prejudice - and an equally famous brother.\n\nFox has had a impressive career over the years - and it's not just from starring in Silent Witness. Emilia has starred in recognised films and shows such as the TV adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. She was also in the 2002 Roman Polanksi movie, The Pianist.\n\nREAD MORE: Joel Dommett's marriage to supermodel wife and forgotten role in Casualty\n\nHer brother is actor Freddie Fox, who you will probably recognise from series Cucumber and Banana, and he played Jeremy Bamber in White House Farm. Emilia also has a more infamous cousin in Laurence Fox, the Lewis actor who turned controversial in 2020 as he promoted antivaxx theories.\n\nShe recently spoke to the Guardian about growing up in West London, saying: \"It was always Dad eating Mum’s homemade marmalade on big, buttered chunks of toast. Dad would take us to Regent’s Park to feed the ducks, while Mum got a roast on the table. They’d invite friends over who were happy to play games and cards with me. Sunday evenings I’d play the piano with Dad. I can still picture my little hands on top of his as he played.\"\n\nEmilia has also dated famous star in that past as she was previously married to her Hollywood actor ex-husband Jared Francis Harris. The couple married in 2005, but sadly went their separate ways when Harris filed for divorce in 2009 according to an article published by TMZ.\n\nThe BAFTA awards winner starred in a string of TV shows and films including the hit US show Mad Men, The Crown and Sherlock Holmes. Harris is the child of Harry Potter legend and late actor Richard Harris, who was famed for his role as Professor Albus Dumbledore in the first two films in the fantasy movie franchise.\n\nWhen her marriage to Jared ended, Fox began a relationship with actor Jeremy Gilley in 2010. The couple share one child together, their daughter Rose.\n\nWant more from MyLondon? Sign up to our daily newsletters for all the latest and greatest from across London here.\n\nREAD NEXT:"
