Her uncle is James Fox and her cousins Laurence and Lydia also have successful acting careers.[4] She has a brother Freddie and a half sister Lucy.[1] She was educated at the independent Bryanston School where she played the cello, and at St Catherine's College, Oxford, where she read English.[5][6][7]Her great-great grandfather was Samson Fox, a self-made millionaire, and her great-grandmother was the actress Hilda Hanbury, sister of Lily Hanbury.[8] Through Hanbury, she is related to the Terry family of actors.[9]\n\nIn 2000 Fox was engaged to the comedian Vic Reeves.[10][11] Shortly after this she began dating the artist and fashion designer Toby Mott,[12] but the couple ended the relationship soon afterwards. In July 2005, she married the British actor Jared Harris, the son of the Irish actor Richard Harris. The couple announced their split in 2008, and Harris filed for divorce in January 2009.[13] The divorce followed the breakdown of their long-distance relationship and her having a miscarriage in 2007.[14] Fox later entered into a relationship with actor Jeremy Gilley, and in May 2010 it was reported that Fox was pregnant with their child.[15] The Harris-Fox divorce was finalised in June 2010.

In 1998 she starred with Ben Miles in the adaptation of Catherine Cookson's The Round Tower as the young Vanessa Radcliffe, a wealthy girl from an affluent family who is forced to leave her home after becoming pregnant.

Therewind format in which the show was shot traced the development of the killer streak of Fox's character. (Fox and Dance both appeared in ITV1's Henry VIII, but Dance's role of the Duke of Buckingham was limited as his character was arrested for treason less than fifteen minutes into the first half, while Fox's scenes as the doomed third Queen Jane Seymour dominated the first half of the second episode). In the 2008 English language DVD re-release of the cult 2006 Norwegian animated film Free Jimmy, Fox voiced the character of \"Bettina\". The dialogue was written by Simon Pegg and other actors included Pegg himself and Woody Harrelson.
