        "text": "Actress Emilia Fox was romantically linked to some very famous faces before she fell in love with her TV producer boyfriend.\n\nThe 49-year-old actress - who is cousins with controversial actor Laurence Fox - is best known for portraying Dr Nikki Alexander in BBC's Silent Witness since 2004. Away from the cameras, Emilia is loved up with her partner, Jonathan Stadlen, whom she met through a mutual friend three years ago.\n\nShe recently gushed over their cute routine of declaring their love for each other every night and said they feel like they're married, despite having not tied the knot. But before the star found her 'home' in Jonathan, she was engaged to a well-known comedian, married to a British actor, and dated a top chef.\n\nIn 2000, Emilia was engaged to comedic Vic Reeves, after meeting him on the set of Randall and Hopkirk. She then dated designer Toby Mott, before marrying actor Jared Harris in July 2005. The couple suffered a heartbreaking miscarriage in 2007 and their long-distance relationship broke down shortly after, as they announced their separation and filed for divorce in 2009.\n\nAt the time, Emilia told The Sun: \"It's fun dating again and finding someone who you really enjoy being with. I love romance. I'm a great believer in second, third - even fourth chances at love.\" The following year, Emilia began a relationship with actor Jeremy Gilley and they had a daughter called Rose, before splitting up in 2011.\n\nThe actress went on to have a rollercoaster romance with chef Marco Pierre White, who was 13 years her senior. In 2016, they parted ways, and three years later, she sparked a romance with millionaire banker Luc Chaudhray, whom she met on the celebrity dating app Raya.\n\nThe couple were set to marry and were reportedly keen to have children at the earliest possible moment. A source told The Sun in 2020: \"Emilia and Luc are hopelessly in love. They're both parents and looking forward to blending their families into one. They're desperate to start a family of their own too, but only once they are married.\" But soon after their engagement, they called it quits.\n\nA source told the same publication: \"Emilia was disappointed to find they didn't have a future but there's no going back now. It's over.\" It was reported Emilia had asked Luc to move out of the home they shared in London and she returned her engagement ring to him. The star previously spoke out about the difficulties of dating as a mum, admitting she was happy being single while Rose was small.\n\nShe told You magazine: \"When children are little, it is difficult, but you can be on your own and that can be a healthy thing. Too often the tendency is to jump from relationship to relationship and I love knowing that I am happy in my own company. Also, my responsibilities to Rose would be a massive consideration before I brought someone new into my life.\""
