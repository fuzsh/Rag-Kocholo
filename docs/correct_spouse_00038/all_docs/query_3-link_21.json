        "text": "<templatestyles src=\"Module:Infobox/styles.css\"></templatestyles>\n\nEmilia Rose Elizabeth Fox[1][2] (born 31 July 1974) is an English actress, known for her role as Dr. Nikki Alexander on BBC crime drama Silent Witness, having joined the cast in 2004 following the departure of Amanda Burton. Fox is now the longest serving cast member since the departures of Tom Ward in 2012 and William Gaminara in 2013. She also appeared as Morgause in the BBC’s Merlin beginning in the programme's second series. She was educated at Bryanston School in Blandford, Dorset.\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nFox was born in Hammersmith, London, England.[3] She comes from a thespian family — her mother is actress Joanna David (née Joanna Elizabeth Hacking) and her father is actor Edward Fox. Her uncle is James Fox and her cousins Jack, Laurence and Lydia also have successful acting careers.[4] She has a brother Freddie, also an actor, and a half sister Lucy.[1] She was educated at the independent Bryanston School where she played the cello, and at St Catherine's College, Oxford, where she read English.[5][6] Her great-great grandfather was Samson Fox, a self-made millionaire, and her great-grandmother was the actress Hilda Hanbury, sister of Lily Hanbury. Her grandfather was Robin Fox, a theatrical agent.[7] Through Hanbury, she is related to the Terry family of actors.[8]\n\nIn 2000 Fox was engaged to the comedian Vic Reeves.[9][10] In July 2005, she married the British actor Jared Harris, the son of the Irish actor Richard Harris. The couple announced their split in 2008, and Harris filed for divorce in January 2009.[11] The divorce followed the breakdown of their long-distance relationship and her having a miscarriage in 2007.[12]\n\nFox later entered into a relationship with actor Jeremy Gilley, and in May 2010 it was reported that Fox was pregnant with their child.[13] The Harris-Fox divorce was finalised in June 2010. In November 2010, Fox gave birth to a baby girl named Rose.[14]\n\nFox is a patron of the environmental and human rights charity the Environmental Justice Foundation.[15] She speaks German and French. She plays the cello, the piano and the trumpet.[16]\n\nCareer[]\n\nFox first appeared as Georgiana, the sister of Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy, in the 1995 television adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, followed by her role as the second Mrs. de Winter in the 1997 television adaptation of Rebecca opposite Charles Dance. In 1998 she starred with Ben Miles in the adaptation of Catherine Cookson's The Round Tower as the young Vanessa Radcliffe, a wealthy girl from an affluent family who is forced to leave her home after becoming pregnant. Fox played Jeannie Hurst in the 2000 remake of Randall and Hopkirk. In 2003, she played Jane Seymour in a two-part television biographical film about King Henry VIII. She also played the title role in Katherine Howard, directed by Robin Lefevre at the Chichester Festival Theatre in 1998.\n\nIn 2004, she joined the cast of the crime drama, Silent Witness & as of 2017, she is still in the show and has now played the role of Nikki Alexander for 13 years. Also, in 2004, she played Lady Margaret in Part 2 of Gunpowder, Treason and Plot, the mini-series about James I (James VI in Scotland) and the Gunpowder Plot. In 2005 she played Rosie Jones in the film Keeping Mum and in 2008 she played Sister Jean in Baillie Walsh's Flashbacks of a Fool with Daniel Craig. She also starred in Things To Do Before You're 30, with Billie Piper, who would later marry her first cousin Laurence Fox. She was cast as Lynne Frederick in the 2004 film The Life and Death of Peter Sellers starring Geoffrey Rush in the lead role. A whole section of the film focusing on the Frederick/Sellers relationship was removed in the final edit. (She can be seen briefly in a background shot towards the end of the film) The deleted scenes with Fox can be found with others among the special features on the DVD release of the film.\n\n2007 saw Fox reunited with her Rebecca co-star Charles Dance when they starred together in the ITV1 mini-series Fallen Angel, which saw Fox as serial killer Rosie Byfield, with Dance appearing as her father. The rewind format in which the show was shot traced the development of the killer streak of Fox's character. (Fox and Dance both appeared in ITV1's Henry VIII, but Dance's role of the Duke of Buckingham was limited as his character was arrested for treason less than fifteen minutes into the first half, while Fox's scenes as the doomed third Queen Jane Seymour dominated the first half of the second episode). In the 2008 English language DVD re-release of the cult 2006 Norwegian animated film Free Jimmy, Fox voiced the character of \"Bettina\". The dialogue was written by Simon Pegg and other actors included Pegg himself and Woody Harrelson. Emilia Fox narrates the popular children's book We're Going on a Bear Hunt (by Michael Rosen and Helen Oxenbury) with Kevin Whately in a special edition book and DVD set. She appeared as Morgause in the second series of BBC's Merlin in 2009. She returned for the third series and the fourth. Also in 2009, she portrayed Queen Elizabeth II in the Channel 4 documentary entitled The Queen.\n\nFor Doctor Who she narrated the character, Lady Winters, in the Doctor Who Adventure Game, The Gunpowder Plot, (2011).[17] She previously played Berenice in the Eighth Doctor audio drama Nevermore.[18] She was on Who Do You Think You Are, a British TV show which looked at people's family trees, in 2011. The next year, she played Lady Portia Alresford in Upstairs Downstairs.[19]\n\nFilmography[]\n\nFilm Year Title Role Notes 1999 Pippa Short film 2000 Gina Short film 2002 Dorota 2002 Hideous Man Girl on swing Short film 2002 Sabina Spielrein 2003 3 Blind Mice Claire Bligh 2003 Fay 2004 Lynne Frederick (uncredited) 2004/2006 Cashback Sharon Short film later expanded into a full-length feature film 2005 Things to Do Before You're 30 Kate 2005 Nancy Browning 2005 Keeping Mum Rosie Jones 2006 Free Jimmy Bettina Voice (English version) 2006 Cashback Sharon Pintey 2007 Honeymoon Dawn Short film 2008 Flashbacks of a Fool Sister Jean 2009 Dorian Gray Lady Victoria Wotton 2010 Sarah Short film 2010 Ways to Live Forever Mother 2011 Doris 2013 Suspension of Disbelief Claire Jones 2013 Not Ever Emily Short Film 2014 The Devil's Harvest Nadya\n\nTelevision Year Title Role Notes 1995 Pride and Prejudice Georgiana Darcy TV miniseries 1997 Rebecca The Second Mrs. de Winter TV film 1997 Bright Hair Ann Devenish TV film 1997 Karoline von Esterhazy TV film 1998 Blink Nicki TV short 1998 Verdict Charlie Moyes Episode: \"The Doctor's Opinion\" 1999 Vanessa Ratcliffe TV film 1999 Shooting the Past Spig TV film 1999 Minette Roland Episode: \"The Scarlet Pimpernel\" 1999 David Copperfield Clara Copperfield TV film 2000 Other People's Children Dale Episode: \"1.3\" 2000 TV series 2000–2001 Randall & Hopkirk Jeannie 11 episodes 2001 Bad Blood Jackie Shipton TV film 2002 Coupling Wilma Lettings Episode: \"Faithless\"\n\nEpisode: \"Unconditional Sex\" 2003 Helen of Troy Cassandra, Princess of Troy TV film 2003 Henry VIII Jane Seymour TV film 2004 Gunpowder, Treason & Plot Lady Margaret TV film 2004–present Silent Witness Dr. Nikki Alexander 120 episodes 2006 Amy Dudley TV miniseries 2006 Agatha Christie's Marple: The Moving Finger Joanna Burton TV film 2006 Born Equal Laura TV film 2007 Fallen Angel Angel\n\nRosemary Byfield Episode: \"The Four Last Things\"\n\nEpisode: \"The Judgement of Strangers\" 2007 Ballet Shoes Sylvia Brown TV film 2008 Consuming Passion Kirstie, a 30-something university English lecturer TV film dramatising Mills and Boon 2008 TV film 2008 The Queen Queen Elizabeth II Episode: \"Sisters\" 2009–2011 Merlin Morgause 11 episodes 2010 Bookaboo Episode: \"The Spider and the Fly\" 2012 Upstairs Downstairs Lady Portia Alresford Episode: \"A Perfect Specimen of Womanhood\" 2012 Falcón Ines Episode: \"The Blind Man of Seville\" 2013 The Wrong Mans Scarlett 2014 The Secrets Episode: \"The Lie\" 2015 The Casual Vacancy Julia Sweetlove 2015 Bear Grylls: Mission Survive Herself, contestant Six-part TV series 2016— Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway[20] Herself TV miniseries\n\n\"Who Shot Simon Cowell?\" (Series 13)\n\n\"The Missing Crown Jewels\" (Series 14) Home From Home Penny Pilot + upcoming series 2016 The Tunnel Vanessa Hamilton Series 2 2016— Delicious Sam Sky1 series\n\nTheatreography[]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1996–1997 The Cherry Orchard Anya Royal Shakespeare Company 1998 Katherine Howard Katherine Howard Chichester Festival Theatre 1999 Good Donmar Warehouse 2000 Richard II Almeida Theatre 2000 Coriolanus Almeida Theatre 2003–2004 Les Liaisons dangereuses Playhouse Theatre 2014 Rapture, Blister, Burn Hampstead Theatre 2017 Sex With Strangers Olivia Hampstead Theatre\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]"
