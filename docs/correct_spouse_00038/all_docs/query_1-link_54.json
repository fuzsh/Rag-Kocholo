        "text": "As a teenager, I put myself under a crazy amount of pressure. It was all entirely self-induced. My parents never pushed me, but they did provide me with an amazing education [she attended Bryanston, a leading boarding school in Dorset] and I wanted to prove myself to them to say thank you. I made it to Oxford, but it is not that I am particularly clever, much more that I am a worker bee. The important thing about being a parent is allowing your children to be who they want to be. My mum and dad were brilliant at that. I was in my first year at Oxford reading English literature when I got my acting break in Pride and Prejudice (she played Darcy’s younger sister opposite Colin Firth in the BBC adaptation) during the summer holidays. I could have been swept along by that, but my parents said, ‘Stay at university and enjoy yourself because you’ll never get that time again.’ Those were wise words – they gave me the luxury of time to work out what it was I really wanted. My mum’s breakdown was a bonding force. When I was in my early 20s, she had to have a brain operation for a skull condition called Chiari 1 malformation, and afterwards she suffered from postoperative depression. She had always been such a pillar of strength and, by God, when I saw her so helpless, it made me pull my socks up. More recently she has suffered from Meniere’s disease, a disorder of the inner ear that affects your balance and can be crippling. Thankfully, she is much better now, but looking after her has made us much tighter as a family. Dad is a rare Fox and a true gentleman. He doesn’t get talked about so much because he is rock solid. But he is also very funny and can make us all laugh, even during the difficult times. We made a film together a few years ago in Toronto and that experience brought a whole new dimension to our relationship. It was good to go out to supper with him after a day of shooting and talk as colleagues rather than father and daughter. And now I love watching him as a doting grandparent. He has this wonderful way of letting children feel their way to him rather than diving in and scaring them away. Sometimes it is only when you lose things that you finally grow up and start to value what is important. I had a miscarriage when I was 31, which was a massive wake-up call. I was ten weeks’ pregnant and at the time I thought my world had ended. I’d spent my 20s focusing on my career, but like a lot of women, I had assumed that having a child would be my rite of passage. Losing my baby made me reassess everything [the father was her then husband, actor Jared Harris, son of Richard Harris and star of Mad Men – they subsequently, amicably, divorced]. I realised I was far from alone – thousands of women have miscarriages and recover from them. I also realised that I really wanted to be a mum, which ultimately was a good thing. Like every mother, I am trying to find the balance. My mother sacrificed her work for our family life. Her priority was always stability for Fred and me and she turned work down if it meant being away from us. I have to work, but I’m definitely more choosy now about how long and how far I am prepared to be away from home. Luckily, the Silent Witness studio is five minutes from my house, so I go back and forth all the time. I’ve always had an enormous sense of independence. But I know that sometimes I can be too independent. It is important to be able to share your life – so that is a work in progress for me. And now that I have Rose, I have a dependant, so everything is shifting. I’m not thinking about a relationship right now. I used to plan everything, but I can’t know what my future holds and I can’t begin to get my thoughts around that. I have to accept what life is for me at the moment, and that is no bad thing because children live in the present, so Rose and I are in the same place. The virtue I value above all others is kindness. Several people have returned to my life recently and been so kind and thoughtful. There is a flower seller at Borough Market in London who is like my fairy godfather – he always knows how to cheer me up. And the other day my dear friend the jeweller Alex Monroe asked me to pop round because he had something for me. It was a gold necklace with two tiny pendants – a rose and a fox – for my Rose Fox. How kind is that? I haven’t taken it off. The older I get, the more I find imperfection attractive. At work, people do my hair and make-up and I have a part to play and it is a lovely, brief escape. But in real life, putting on a front is just too tiring. I find the more I open I am about my vulnerabilities, the more honest people are with me."
