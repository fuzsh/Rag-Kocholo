        "text": "The legal papers were lodged not in Britain, where they married, but at the Los Angeles County Superior Court. They cited \"irreconcilable differences\". Emilia, 34, has returned to the marital home in Acton, west London, after moving out of the house they shared in California. \"It's very sad, but not something I want to talk about,\" she tells Mandrake.\n\nEmilia met Jared, who is 13 years her senior, on the set of Les Liaisons Dangereuses in 2003 and once described him as the \"king of romance\". His mother, Elizabeth, was Harris's first wife and went on to marry Jonathan Aitken, the former Tory minister.\n\nThe couple were reported to have become estranged last year. Emilia had been linked to O T Fagbenle, her co-star in the BBC television drama Consuming Passions. She insisted that photographs of her supposedly staring \"adoringly'' into the eyes of the Nigerian actor were \"completely innocent\"."
