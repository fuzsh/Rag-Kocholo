        "text": "I've always really liked Emilia Fox since I first saw her in the Randall & Hopkirk (Deceased) remake, and she's been fantastic in Merlin.\n\nAll the best to her and family.\n\n0\n\nDon't think the baby has anything to do with Jared, they've been divorced a while\n\nWhoops! Knew it was wrong when I was writing it! Teaches me to do things when half asleep!\n\nEdit: Too late to edit it! Well congratulations and apologies to Jeremy!\n\n0\n\nPleased for her BUT why the hell do people say 'Welcomes' in regards to new borns? do they shake its hand and say welcome to our family/world ect.?\n\n0\n\nPleased for her BUT why the hell do people say 'Welcomes' in regards to new borns? do they shake its hand and say welcome to our family/world ect.?\n\nI know. I hate that too! It's so pretentious.\n\nYou either give birth to a child, or adopt one. Why can't people use plain English .\n\nPleased for Emilia anyway. She's a very charismatic actor and I've enjoyed her in Merlin, even though she's been given some rotten dialogue this series :rolleyes:.\n\n0"
