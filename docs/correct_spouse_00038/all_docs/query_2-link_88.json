        "text": "About Emilia\n\nFox was born in Hammersmith, London in England, UK. She comes from a thespian family — her mother is actress Joanna David (née Joanna Elizabeth Hacking) and her father is actor Edward Fox. Her uncle is James Fox and her cousins Jack, Laurence and Lydia also have successful acting careers. She has a brother Freddie, also an actor, and a half sister Lucy. She was educated at the independent Bryanston School where she played the cello, and at St Catherine’s College, Oxford, where she read English. Her great-great grandfather was Samson Fox, a self-made millionaire, and her great-grandmother was the actress Hilda Hanbury, sister of Lily Hanbury. Her grandfather was Robin Fox, a theatrical agent. Through Hanbury, she is related to the Terry family of actors.\n\nIn 2000 Fox was engaged to the comedian Vic Reeves. In July 2005, she married the British actor Jared Harris, the son of the Irish actor Richard Harris. The couple announced their split in 2008, and Harris filed for divorce in January 2009.[11] The divorce followed the breakdown of their long-distance relationship and her having a miscarriage in 2007.\n\nFox later entered into a relationship with actor Jeremy Gilley, and in May 2010 it was reported that Fox was pregnant with their child. The Harris-Fox divorce was finalised in June 2010. In November 2010, Fox gave birth to a baby girl named Rose."
