        "text": "Silent Witness star Emilia Fox has revealed how she suffered a secret miscarriage - which she blames for wrecking her marriage.\n\nThe 35-year-old actress who plays Dr Nikki Alexander in the BBC crime drama, lost her baby two years ago.\n\nIt had a devastating effect on her relationship with actor Jared Harris - son of Hollywood legend Richard Harris.\n\nEmilia said: \"We didn't explore enough the impact that had on both of us. At the time I thought, 'OK, so physically I'm better. Let's just carry on with life'.\n\n\"I thought it was like a horrible illness that you get over.\"\n\nEmilia, who plays a young Elizabeth II in C4's The Queen next month, revealed she had been in therapy since her marriage broke down. She is now dating actor Jeremy Gilley.\n\nShe said: \"One think I've learned is that we should have shared more.\""
