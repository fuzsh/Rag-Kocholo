        "text": "Joanna’s actor daughter, Silent Witness star Emilia Fox, once affectionately described her and her father Edward Fox as “my down-to-earth and unworldly parents” – which is perhaps why I seem to have been admitted into the Fox family’s lair on washing day, with a laden clothes horse in the hall and the family help, Fatima, dashing away with the steam iron behind us……\n\nLast year, Emilia talked about how looking after her mother during Joanna’s\n\nrecuperation had made the whole family “much tighter” – as did the birth nearly three years ago of Emilia’s golden-haired daughter Rose, whom Joanna now looks after once a week to give Emilia and her nanny a break. Rose is Joanna’s first biological grandchild, although she has played granny for more than two decades to Harry, the son of her stepdaughter Lucy, now Viscountess Gormanston – Edward Fox’s 53-year-old daughter by his first wife, the late Dr Strangelove actress Tracy Reed\n\nOver the years, daughter Emilia, now 39, has given the family more than enough cause for concern, with a chequered romantic history that Joanna once described, diplomatically, as “not an enviable one”: it includes a brief engagement to the comedian Vic Reeves, a three-year marriage to Mad Men star Jared Harris, and a similarly short-lived relationship with Rose’s father, the film-maker and peace activist Jeremy Gilley, which ended two years ago, leaving her a single parent.\n\nJoanna, however, refuses to fret. “Whether Millie gets married again is so out of my business. As her mother, all I can hope for is her personal happiness.” Admitting her fondness for Emilia’s ex-husband (“I adored Jared”), she also says she is relieved that, though separated from her daughter, “Jeremy is a much more supportive dad, thank goodness, than mine ever was”."
