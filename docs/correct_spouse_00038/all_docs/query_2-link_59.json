        "text": "I didn't realise my upbringing was unusual until my teens. As the child of two actors, I presumed that visiting film sets and being surrounded by colourful characters was normal. It was only when I was older that I became aware that our house in Dorset was a little Bohemian. It had no mains water so I had to explain to visiting friends that you couldn't flush the loo or have a bath unless there had been heavy rainfall. But that's the charm of my parents and the way they lived. It demonstrated that they didn't feel the need to dress up for the occasion, which is why people are at their truest when they are around my parents.\n\nI'm as protective of my parents today as they were of me when I was a child. They weren't discouraging when I went into acting but I sense they just didn't want me to get into anything that might have broken my heart. When I was starting out I fought against their reticence but now I understand their concern, so consequently I tend not to take my problems to them too much. I try to protect them from anything too upsetting.\n\nWhen I was growing up I wanted to be my half-sister Lucy. She was 14 years older than me and was impossibly glamorous. I grew up in awe of her. By the time my brother Freddie was born, I was 15 so there was no sibling rivalry there either. In a sense we were all only children as we had the devoted attention of our parents during our early childhoods.\n\nMy grandmother, Angela, was the Fox family matriarch. She was magnetic but also wicked. She had this huge life force and was great fun but she would play each member of the family off against each other, which could make for extremely dramatic Christmases. I can remember the turkey flying through the air one year. Not thrown by her, but at her. I was too little to know what the dispute was all about but I remember finding it fascinating that she could create such drama.\n\nWitnessing my marriage breakdown has been tough for my parents. I don't think it's right to hide the really important things from your parents so they were the first people I talked to. They've been very supportive but they love Jared in his own right and have built a relationship separate from me, so I was aware of their split allegiances.\n\nMy mother was very ill when I was 18. She had a brain operation and then a nervous breakdown. It's very strange when you see your parents, who have always been your pillars of strength, suddenly become vulnerable. You don't know whether to be angry that they are not strong or devastated. You are totally helpless. Very recently, she has become seriously ill again. Because she has been given a second chance to tell us all how much she loves us, I've woken up to the fact that of just how much I value my family."
