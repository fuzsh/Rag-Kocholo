We’ve been together nearly three years, and we still do it.\"\n\nEmilia Continued: \"We very much feel like we are married, but we're not actually married.\n\n\"We choose to marry each other every day; not in an official capacity, but by choice of being with each other. So it's a daily marriage of love.\"\n\nThe 'Pianist' star - who has also enjoyed romances with the likes of Vic Reeves and Marco Pierre White - gushed: \"To find someone who I'm so totally compatible with is amazing.\"\n\nEmilia is grateful that they are able to work through any issues they have and loves how \"supportive\" and \"understanding\" her man is.\n\nShe said: \"We work through all the things that we bring with our history too, we really talk and communicate.\n\nFrom my history of having therapy, I find it very refreshing to be with someone who wants to do that together.\n\nAnd he's got children, so he understands parenting.\n\n\"It's very supportive.\n\n\"He's the most loving, the most kind, the most thoughtful, the most generous-spirited man, and I feel very together with him. And that's a really lovely feeling. I definitely know how lucky I am.\""
