        "text": "Emilia Fox has confirmed her split from fiancé Luc Chaudhary – revealing that the pair separated five months ago.\n\nThe actress, 46, who is best known for playing Dr Nikki Alexander in BBC series Silent Witness, set the record straight on speculation surrounding the break up by sharing a statement to Instagram.\n\nShe confirmed that herself and Luc are no longer together and chose to call it quits both ‘amicably and respectfully’.\n\nHitting back at reports claiming she had kicked Luc out of her London home, Emilia stressed that he had lived independently from her throughout her relationship and such speculation is untrue.\n\nHer statement read: ‘The newspaper articles that have appeared regarding the break up of the relationship between Luc Chaudhary and myself are both hurtful and untrue.\n\n‘I did not kick Luc out of my home. Luc and his wonderful sons lived independently in their own home throughout our relationship. Both our families had love and respect for us and our relationship.’\n\nIt continued: ‘5 months ago Luc and I decided to part ways. It was done amicably, respectfully and with great consideration to our children.\n\n‘We still both care immensely about each other’s kids and about each other which is why these articles would be damaging for them to read or be told about.’\n\nEmilia said: ‘We remained quiet about our break up, because it was and is a private matter to us.’\n\nHer statement came after sources had claimed to The Sun that Emilia had asked Luc to leave her home in London and alleged her family ‘weren’t keen’ on her ex.\n\nThe TV star and Luc got engaged late last year and had plans to tie the knot next summer in 2021. News of their split comes after the pair had spent 18 months together.\n\nWhile Luc is father to two sons, Emilia is mum to daughter Rose, nine, who she shares with ex Jeremy Gilley.\n\nEarlier this year, Emilia had opened up on her romance and revealed it was ‘fun’ to be dating again.\n\nShe told Good Housekeeping: ‘It’s fun dating again and finding someone who you really enjoy being with. I love romance. I’m a great believer in second, third… even fourth chances at love.’\n\nEmilia was previously married to actor Jared Harris in 2005. They split three years later in 2008, with their divorce being finalised the following year.\n\nMetro.co.uk has reached out to Emilia’s rep for comment.\n\nMORE : Saturday Night Live’s Kate McKinnon makes epic dig at JK Rowling during psychic reading with Adele"
