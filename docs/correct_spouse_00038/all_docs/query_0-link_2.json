        "text": "British/Irish actor\n\nJared Francis Harris (born 24 August 1961) is a British actor.[1] His roles include Lane Pryce in the drama series Mad Men (2009–2012), for which he was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series; King George VI in the historical drama series The Crown (2016–2017); and Valery Legasov in the miniseries Chernobyl (2019), for which he won the BAFTA TV Award for Best Actor and was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie.[2]\n\nHarris also had roles as David Robert Jones in the science fiction series Fringe (2008–2012), Anderson Dawes on the science fiction series The Expanse (2015–2017) and Captain Francis Crozier in the series The Terror (2018). He is also known for his significant supporting roles in films such as Mr. Deeds (2002), The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008), Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011), Lincoln (2012), Allied (2016), Hari Seldon, a leading character in the science fiction series Foundation (2021), and as John in Reawakening (2024).\n\nHarris was born on 24 August 1961 in Hammersmith, London, the second of three sons of Irish actor Richard Harris and his first wife, Welsh actress Elizabeth Rees-Williams (1936–2022).[3] His younger brother is actor Jamie Harris, his older brother is director Damian Harris and his maternal grandfather was politician David Rees-Williams, 1st Baron Ogmore.[4]\n\nHarris was educated at Ladycross School, a former preparatory boarding independent school in the coastal town of Seaford in East Sussex, as were his brothers Jamie and Damian. He says, \"They were famous for discipline, with cold showers every morning\", and that \"You were never known by your first name there. You were either called by your number, or your last name. Since there were three of us, Damian was 'Harris Ma' for major. I was 'Harris Mi' for minor, and Jamie was 'Harris Minimus,' being the youngest and the smallest\".[5] He then attended Downside School, a Catholic boarding independent school in the village of Stratton-on-the-Fosse (near the market town of Shepton Mallet) in Somerset, in South West England.[5] He went on to Duke University in the U.S., graduating in 1984 with a BFA in drama, then returned to England to train as an actor at the Central School of Speech and Drama, graduating in 1989.[6]\n\nHarris began his film career directing Darkmoor (1983), an unfinished feature-length film for Duke University's Freewater Films. His first film appearance as an actor was in The Rachel Papers (1989). He took minor roles in films such as the western romance Far and Away (1992), the historical epic The Last of the Mohicans (1992), and the crime drama Natural Born Killers (1994). He took the role of Benmont Tench in Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man (1995). He portrayed the role of the aged Will Robinson in the 1998 movie adaptation of the television series Lost in Space. That same year he portrayed Vladimir in the controversial black comedy drama film Happiness (1998), written and directed by Todd Solondz. He portrayed Kenneth Branagh's character's doppelgänger in How to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog (2000).\n\nOther notable roles include Andy Warhol in I Shot Andy Warhol, John Lennon in the television movie Two of Us (2000) and King Henry VIII in the 2003 BBC film adaptation of the novel The Other Boleyn Girl. Harris portrayed Dr. Charles Ashford in Resident Evil: Apocalypse (2004). He portrayed the gruff Captain Anderson in the BBC2 adaptation of To the Ends of the Earth; Mac McGrath in the movie Mr. Deeds; Eamon Quinn on the FX series The Riches; and David Robert Jones on Fringe.\n\nHe gained widespread fame for his portrayal of Lane Pryce in the AMC period drama series Mad Men from 2009 until 2012. The show focuses on the lives of Ad Men in New York City during the 1960s. He first appeared in season three where he arrives as a British newcomer to Sterling Cooper, and later becomes a partner of the new agency Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. Paul MacInnes of The Guardian wrote of Lane Pryce, \"For much of his three season tenure on the show, Lane has seemed like the archetypal Englishman...He was polite, courteous, dry-witted, stingy. He was also apparently logical and keenly stoic, keeping calm and carrying on when Sterling Cooper broke up and its successor nearly went under.\"[7] Harris received critical acclaim for his final appearance in the episode \"Commissions and Fees\" as well as a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, losing to Aaron Paul for Breaking Bad in 2012. He returned to the series to direct the 11th episode of season 7, which aired in 2015.\n\nHe portrayed Ulysses S. Grant in Steven Spielberg's acclaimed historical drama film Lincoln (2012).[8]\n\nHis portrayal of King George VI in the first season of The Crown received praise from critic Matt Zoller Seitz, who stated that despite the series' large ensemble, \"Harris still manages to communicate the character’s understated sensitivity and awareness of his circumscribed role in England’s drama so poignantly that one can’t help being moved by the performance\".[9] He received nominations for the British Academy Television Award for Best Supporting Actor and the Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Guest Performer in a Drama Series.\n\nHe portrayed Captain Francis Crozier in the 2018 series The Terror, based on the Dan Simmons novel of the same name that provided a fictional account of the fate of Franklin's lost expedition. In November 2018, Harris was one of the first recipients of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society's Louie Kamookak Medal, awarded \"for making Canada's geography better known to Canadians and to the world\", for his portrayal of Captain Crozier. Harris said that he was \"gratified\" that the series inspired curiosity about the real expedition, remarking, \"It’s sort of fitting that history will recall that it was the RCGS that first recognized The Terror, and that we as the recipients walked in the footsteps of Louie Kamookak.\"[10]\n\nIn 2019, Harris portrayed Valery Legasov in the acclaimed miniseries Chernobyl, which revolves around the Chernobyl disaster of 1986 and the cleanup efforts that followed.[11] For that role he won the British Academy Television Award for Best Actor and was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie and Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Film. The series was produced by HBO in the United States and Sky UK in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn March 2019, Harris joined Jared Leto in Sony's Spider-Man spinoff Morbius.[12] He plays the developer of psychohistory Hari Seldon in the Foundation television series produced for Apple TV+ which premiered in September 2021.[13] In March 2021, Harris was announced to have joined the cast of the biographical drama film Rothko, directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson.[14]\n\nIn 2024, he played the father of a returning missing child in the British psychological thriller film Reawakening, alongside Erin Doherty and Juliet Stevenson.[15]\n\nHarris married Jacqueline Goldenberg in 1989 and they divorced three years later.[16] On 16 July 2005, Harris married actress Emilia Fox,[17] the daughter of actors Edward Fox and Joanna David, and filed for divorce in January 2009;[18] the divorce was finalised in June 2010.\n\nIn April 2009, Harris met Allegra Riggio, a lighting designer and television host,[19] at a comedy club where a mutual friend was performing.[19][20] They married on 9 November 2013.[21] Harris resides in Los Angeles.[6]\n\nKey † Denotes works that have not yet been released\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1989 The Rachel Papers Geoff 1992 Far and Away Paddy The Last of the Mohicans British Lieutenant The Public Eye Danny the Doorman 1994 Natural Born Killers London Boy Nadja Edgar 1995 Smoke Jimmy Rose Dead Man Benmont Tench Blue in the Face Jimmy Rose Tall Tale Head Thug Pug 1996 I Shot Andy Warhol Andy Warhol Gold in the Streets Owen 1997 Fathers' Day Lee Sunday Ray Chinese Box William White Lies Jacob Reese 1998 Happiness Vlad B.
