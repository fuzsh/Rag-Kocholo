        "text": "Long running BBC drama Silent Witness will return to screens on Monday, January 8 for its 27th series. Emilia Fox - who has played Dr Nikki Alexander on the show since 2004 - returns to the hit series.\n\nEmilia took over from Amanda Burton, who was the original series lead. Many members of the 49-year-old actress’ family are in the acting profession and her cousin is controversial actor turned right wing pundit Laurence Fox, who last year was involved in 2023’s most complained about TV moment.\n\nDespite his divisive political opinions, Emilia has said that she still “loves” her cousin. Speaking to The Times in 2021, she said: “I don’t know what emails you’ve had, but Laurence is my cousin, he’s family and I love my family. I think he’d be the first to advocate that people can have different opinions on things.\n\nREAD MORE: Susanna Reid close to tears as she reads message from Kate Garraway to Good Morning Britain viewers\n\nREAD MORE: Stacey Solomon says 'it doesn't feel real' after being rushed to hospital on holiday\n\n“We’ve had very different life experiences and Laurence’s political life has nothing to do with my relationship with him. We’ve had some amazing times together and we’ve been very mutually supportive of our personal lives.”\n\nEmilia, who is now in a relationship with TV producer Jonathan Stadley, was previously married to Hollywood actor Jared Harris between 2005 and 2010.\n\nFollowing her separation from Jared, Emilia began a relationship with actor Jeremy Gilley and in May 2010 it was reported that she was pregnant with their child. The pair split in 2011.\n\nThen, Emilia dated chef Marco Pierre White from 2012 to 2016 and Luc Chaudhary from 2019 to 2020. She was also previously engaged to comedian Vic Reeves in the past and was also in a relationship with designer Toby Mott.\n\nAside from her role in Silent Witness, Emilia has also appeared in several other television shows and films. These include Pride & Prejudice, The Pianist and Flashbacks of a Fool opposite James Bond actor Daniel Craig."
