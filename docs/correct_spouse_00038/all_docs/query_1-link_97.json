And the highest placed English speaking actress, as she should be. Glad Tilda Swinton also made it at no.13.\n\nI'm sure the inclusion and high placement of Keanu Reeves will generate some controversy (they knew what they were doing.lol!), but it really goes to show how much goodwill and respect he's generated as a film actor and movie star this century, after being a punchline for so much of his early career. He may be far too high, but this is a classic critics move of helping elevate the rep of an actor who never got enough plaudits or respect. You should be proud of yer boy stephen . He's come a long way. Reeves aside, it's a mostly uncontroversial list. Filled with highly respected actors and undervalued but gifted character actors like Wes Studi and Rob Morgan.

After Inside Llewyn Davis, I thought for sure he was going to be huge, and he'd win an Oscar within 10 years and at least be nominated for one in 5 years, and while I think he's doing alright for himself, I don't know that he's lived up to that initial promise. I mean his performance in ILD is fantastic, and if it were just about greatest performances this century, he would definitely deserve to be on the list, but I don't know that I'd include him over the likes of people Franklin mentioned. Or even Tom Hanks, Adam Driver, Brian Tyree Henry, Matthew McConaughey, or even Sam Rockwell who I feel has become a little one-note lately at least in terms of what roles he's been taking, seem like they've been more consistent and put out more great performances this decade. Two really great performances doesn't equal the consistency or output that those other names have had this decade imo.\n\nI don't have a problem with MBJ being on the list because he I think he's made more of a lasting impression than Isaac and has been more consistent, at least so far, but maybe a little high. I would maybe switch him and Ali.\n\nPost by morton on\n\nThis list is pretty awful - are more than 1/2 of the \"greatest\" actors of the 21st century PoC?\n\nSo \"woke\"!\n\nBut lists are made to make fun of so with that in mind........\n\nObservations:\n\nKeanu Reeves at 4 is classic wtf-ery, and I love the whole idea of him but nah.\n\nDenzel at 1 is um........well not \"#1\" to me.......but really without Hanks, DiCaprio, Bale, Bridges, Oldman at all that looks more absurd than it would if he beat his genuine rivals.\n\nDiCaprio missing is as preposterous as Reeves making it - especially since compared to the guy at number 1 - he has nearly twice as many Oscar nods in the era (for example), bigger and far better films etc than him - that's not anti-'Zel bias, those are facts........but especially with Michael B.

Seriously... Wes Studi? 21st century? They don't even have anything real to say. He was WASTED in Hostiles.\n\nStill, regardless of what you make of the choices (nobody is ever going to agree on that, and at least this isn't just all the usual suspects) most of it really is a very interesting read with some occasional great really insightful or illuminating bits. Also, love, love, love the inclusion of Rob Morgan.\n\nActually until the top 5 the only parts I didn't find particularly interesting (aside from the aforementioned Studi bit) were Denzel and Bong's writeups for Viola and Song (One of which is just thoroughly uninteresting, and the other of which is just the most banal list of basic observations anyone that's watched his movies could tell you) and the bit on Servillo.\n\nThen you get to the top 5, and when it should get better I think it gets worse. I love the Huppert stuff, but the other 4? Like between Kidman, Keanu, Day-Lewis and Denzel the only bit that I found even well written was the part on Denzel's intro in Fences. They're all just about what great kinds of stars they are, and how a couple of them so often rise above crap material. The Denzel one is just filled with the kinds of superficial superlatives I like these two so much primarily because they always go out of their way to avoid them.\n\nThe Reeves one HAS to be a troll job to get attention because it is both the least convincing thing on the list, and just flat out inaccurate. He IS a great star, and he has a few damn fine performances to his name, but he only really, truly became a figure of fun IN the 21st century with the Matrix sequels that they totally gloss over. John Wick has absolutely rehabbed his image (and what they say about him in there as opposed to someone like Gerry Butler is not wrong) but it ain't much.\n\nPost by ibbi on\n\nHonestly, the only explanation for most of this list is they must have gotten some complaints about diversity or something. Seriously... Wes Studi? 21st century? They don't even have anything real to say. He was WASTED in Hostiles.\n\nWell, Studi won an honorary Oscar last year, and is insanely prolific (even this century). It's possible that in their function as film critics, they've had the opportunity to see him do a lot of superlative work in obscure movies that were never on our radar. And I do know from the work I have seen him in, that he is an exceptional actor.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I LOVE that guy. But if they have indeed seen him do superlative work in the last 20 years then they should talk about it rather than a movie in which his underuse was criminal.\n\nPost by sirchuck23 on\n\n.....and homegirl Nicole Kidman in at no.5.
