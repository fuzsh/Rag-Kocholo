        "text": "Happily, the 35-year-old actress was, however, prepared to model a selection of bridal gowns recently for the designer Kate Halfpenny, her best friend and stylist.\n\n\"I started doing wedding dresses about two years ago and designed two of the dresses that Emilia wore at her own wedding to Jared,\" Kate tells Mandrake. Emilia who is best know for her role in Silent Witness, plays a young Elizabeth II in Channel 4's The Queen later this month.\n\nActor's brave role\n\nWhile it has become de rigueur for television actors to pull out of West End shows at the first sign of a few sniffles, Robert Daws takes the view that the show must go on despite being knocked unconscious while defending his family.\n\nThe debonair star of Public Property, at the Trafalgar Studios, was disturbed by drunken shouting and abuse at 1am outside his house in Ampthill, Bedfordshire. Daws, 50, who is married to Amy Robbins, his co-star in The Royal, went to ask the perpetrator if he would mind moving on and not swearing and shouting as he had young children asleep inside. The man punched him to the ground and Daws was taken to hospital unconscious.\n\n\"He is carrying on with his role as a newsreader, despite suffering from post-traumatic shock,\" says a pal. \"He is not pressing charges.\"\n\nFlight of fancy\n\nNick Clegg, the Lib Dem leader, and Carol Ann Duffy, the Poet Laureate, were among those protesting at Heathrow yesterday by planting trees on the site of the proposed third runway. Curiously, Alain de Botton, who was recently paid to be Heathrow's \"writer in residence\", has also sponsored a tree. \"I feel entitled to say what I like,\" declares the philosopher. \"I did one project with Heathrow; I am not an employee. I love airports and air travel, and recognise that if our society is to tolerate them we are all going to have to learn to fly a lot less.\""
