        "text": "Earlier this year, Tanya Reynolds confirmed she won’t be returning as alien erotica-enthusiast Lily Iglehart in Sex Education Season 4. But fans needn’t worry, as the actor will still be getting plenty of screen time, courtesy of Channel 4’s new drama I Hate You. Written by Robert Popper, the comedy follows Charlotte (Reynolds) and Rebecca (Melissa Saint), who play 20-something best friends navigating the highs and lows of life. But what do we know of Reynolds’ life away from the cameras?\n\nIn a recent interview with Digital Spy, Reynolds, who turned 30 last year, opened up about her 20s being somewhat of a “hot mess.” Looking back on the formative decade, she remarked: “My 20s were lovely, but I just was so unsure of myself and just kind of a bit of a high-functioning mess. So yeah, there's been something quite cathartic about playing the extremity of that in the show [I Hate You], playing someone who is just a high-functioning mess.” Highlighting how she and her on-screen character are at very different stages of their lives, she continued: “It was just really nice to be a 30-year-old grown up playing this playing this 20-something chaotic idiot. But I'm glad that I'm personally out of that phase of my life.”\n\nAs for her off-screen dating life, the actor isn’t known for discussing that in her interviews. However, people who follow Tanya Reynolds’ Instagram may have spotted a familiar face. Fellow actor Freddie Fox makes regular appearances, modelling for arty snaps captured by Reynolds herself. Fox and Reynolds co-starred in the 2019 film Fanny Lye Deliver’d. The pair have been linked in various reports since 2020, with The Sun previously claiming that the two quarantined together at Fox’s home during lockdown."
