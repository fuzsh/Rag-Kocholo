        "text": "Stephen Graham has enjoyed continued success following his critically acclaimed performance in the 2006 BAFTA best picture winner This is England. Other notable credits include The Street, Accused, Parade’s End, playing Al Capone in Scorsese’s Boardwalk Empire. Television credits include Little Boy Blue, The Watchman, Decline and Fall, The Secret Agent, Taboo, Save Me, Line Of Duty, The Virtues, A Christmas Carol, White House Farm, The North Water, Time and Jack Thorne’s drama Help. In 2022, Stephen will star in the final series of Peaky Blinders.\n\nStephen’s film credits include Public Enemies, The Fields, London Boulevard, Season of the Witch, Pirates of The Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, Get Santa, A Patch Of Fog, Pirates Of The Caribbean 5: Dead Men Tell No Tales. His recent credits, include, Film Stars Don’t Die in Liverpool, Funny Cow and Journey’s End, Rocketman, The Irishman and Greyhound. In 2020, Stephen set up Matriarch Productions with Hannah Walters and have filmed their first project Boiling Point.\n\n\"When I was researching young-onset Alzheimer’s for my character Tony in the Channel 4 drama Help, I was privileged to work with Rare Dementia Support (RDS), funded by The National Brain Appeal. I saw first-hand, what an absolute lifeline these support groups are for people, their loved ones and carers affected by rare dementias. These are often people with jobs and young families and their worlds are turned upside-down when they get a dementia diagnosis that is rare, genetic or early onset. I found the experience of talking to people affected really humbling. That is why I am supporting The National Brain Appeal, whose funding is key to developing vital RDS services and who are now fundraising for the world’s first RDS Centre.\"\n\nNula Suchet, born in Dublin, has a background in the arts and design. She was location artist for the A&E television series Early Man, narrated by Walter Cronkite. In between television assignments, she worked as an interior designer in London, Paris and New York. Her work has been published in many notable interior magazines. In 2004 her late husband James was diagnosed with Pick’s Disease. This dreadful illness led to a harrowingly slow decline and inevitable death. In 2019 Nula published her book, The Longest Farewell, which chronicles her journey through dementia, and how she was able to turn despair into happiness. Film rights have been bought, and production is due to begin in 2024-25. In 2016 she married John Suchet, whose wife Bonnie had died of dementia.\n\n“It took three GPs, a Harley Street consultant, and eventually a neurologist, to diagnose my late husband James, aged 58, with Pick’s Disease. During eleven years of caring for him, I was to discover that dementia was the outcast of diseases. Thanks to The National Brain Appeal there is now help for people like me, and I support it with all my heart.”\n\nHaving successfully spent more than 40 years in the notoriously fickle world of showbusiness, Jimmy Tarbuck has hosted numerous television shows, variety shows, chat shows and game shows and his cheeky grin and boy-next-door charms have won him fans far away from his native Liverpool.\n\nJimmy has achieved many awards as both an entertainer and a charity fundraiser.
