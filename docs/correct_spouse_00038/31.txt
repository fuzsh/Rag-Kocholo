Emilia Fox has filed for divorce from actor husband Jared Harris.

The British actress married Harris, the son of late Harry Potter star Richard Harris, in 2005 after a two-year relationship.

According to TMZ, Harris has started divorce proceedings at Los Angeles County Superior Court, citing "irreconcilable differences" as the reason for the split.

A source told the Daily Mail in November that Fox and Harris "are not suited to each other", adding: "She is very successful and incredibly nice, whereas Jared is darker and more troubled."

A spokesman for the couple refused to comment.
