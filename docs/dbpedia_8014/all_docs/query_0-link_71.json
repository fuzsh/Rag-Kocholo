For me, being part of the regulatory community is about accelerating access to medicines for patients through streamlined, integrated and digitally enabled submission processes. Regulators and Health Authorities continue to embrace this innovation as patients often can’t afford to wait for life-changing medicines. Global agencies and health systems are continually amending the regulatory frameworks that we must adhere to, all for the benefit of patient access to medicines. Some health systems have been slower than others to overhaul frameworks but all change is welcome as these changes will help to make it faster and easier to gain approval and to run clinical trials in the countries around the world, this can only have a positive impact for patients. Earlier in the year the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) made some of the biggest changes in 20 years to allow for increased speed and efficiencies when running clinical trials within the country. Additionally, the European Commission has adopted a proposal for a new directive and a new Regulation, which will revise and replace the existing general pharmaceutical legislation. Everyone within the Regulatory industry should welcome these changes as they will enable faster availability of medicines to people that need them most and moves away from a ‘one-size-fits-all’ system approach. Currently there is no prediction on adoption of the legislation and prior to the announcement there had been many industry challenges to the suggested framework, yet one thing remains clear, everyone is supportive of innovations that improve timely access to treatments. As industry innovation continues, we as an organization must continue to partner with Regulatory bodies to get innovative medicines to patients, faster. https://lnkd.in/eSbHpz85 #regulatoryframeworks #clinicaltrials\n\nHealthcare is entering a defining moment, with an opportunity to embrace a new wave of innovation. Yet if Europe is to realise the full potential of these breakthroughs, it is vital that people across the region have more timely and equitable access to these treatments. It is with this potential in mind that I take up a new position on the Board of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) – the main body representing the research-based biopharmaceutical industry in Europe. Alongside my peers from world-leading pharmaceutical companies, I will be working to help deliver on EFPIA’s mission to create an environment that enables our industry to innovate, thrive and deliver new therapies across Europe. At Pfizer, our goal is to change the lives of one billion patients a year by 2027 – but as EFPIA’s mission alludes, this is only possible with the right policy and legislative environment in place. Europe is often seen as a pharmaceutical powerhouse, with the skilled workforce, academic infrastructure, multi-national institutions, and manufacturing capability making it a location of choice for life science investment. Yet in spite of all this expertise and promise there is still significant inequity in access to new medicines. Patients in Europe are having to wait 517 days for access to innovative treatments on average, ranging from 128 days up to a staggering 1,351 days.* This is an unacceptable situation, and I believe our industry is and should remain an important voice in profiling and remedying this issue. Timely and equitable access is a cause I am deeply passionate about. Through my new role on the EFPIA Board, I am committed to finding and fighting for solutions in partnership with policymakers and stakeholders across Europe, based on a shared understanding of the root causes of unavailability and access delays. This is a real opportunity to create a modernised system that can embrace the next generation of medicines and vaccines. Together, I hope we can achieve a healthier and stronger Europe. * https://lnkd.in/egnbJgvd #EFPIA #HealthPolicy #LifeSciences #HealthofEurope #MedicineAccess\n\nThe UK has identified the Life sciences industry as critical to the country's economy. There are great strengths in science, high quality and increasingly speedy authorisation (MHRA) and cost-effectiveness decision making (NICE), a universal healthcare system and increasingly usable data. However, there are consistent complaints that pricing is too low and that access is too variable with good uptake for some medicines (usually more specialist) and slow and uneven uptake for others. While the NHS spends £18b on medicine, the value to the economy is far more than that including revenue from clinical trials, R&D and manufacturing, as well as access to better treatment which means additional years lived in good health and therefore greater economic contribution. The The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) launched its manifesto for growth last night highlighting what is needed for investment. See the CF summary of this below https://lnkd.in/eb25hdwd #ABPI #LifeSciences #GeneralElection #Cfsnapshot MSD AbbVie The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson Novo Nordisk UCB Roche Pfizer Novartis UK Takeda Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThis week, I participated in an EFPIA - European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations Board meeting, representing CSL Vifor. Beyond the critical importance of contributing to healthcare discussions, as I've done with #LIR and #LEEM in the past, it gave me the opportunity to reconnect with the many talented industry leaders after several years outside the European Union. During the meeting, as a Board, we once again emphasized the vital importance of fostering a competitive and appealing EU environment. Currently, the Heads of Government are engaged in discussions aimed at enhancing ‘open strategic autonomy’ within Europe. This concept revolves around reducing our reliance on other regions, across key sectors, including healthcare. This involves bringing back the production of active pharmaceutical ingredients, establishing strategic stocks, and building emergency production capacities right here in Europe. The pharmaceutical manufacturers operating in Europe will be key partners in the pursuit of achieving European strategic autonomy. However, as pharmaceutical companies, we are concerned that the draft EU Pharmaceutical Package, as proposed by the EU Commission, could potentially reduce investments in Europe while reducing access to innovative treatment for European patients. The time for action is now! It is our collective responsibility to guarantee that Europe continues to develop innovative, effective and safe medicines, ensuring patients receive the treatments they need. In this endeavor, CSL Vifor is prepared to collaborate with the pharmaceutical industry and all stakeholders to work towards a future where healthcare innovation thrives, and patients receive the care they deserve. I look forward sharing more updates of my EFPIA journey, and I am interested in hearing your thoughts and experiences on how we can work together to enhance Europe’s competitiveness, health and resilience. #EFPIA #HealthcareLeaders #Innovation #EUpharmaceuticals\n\nSAVE THE DATE: Drug Channels Leadership Forum, March 17-19, 2025: I am pleased to announce the inaugural Drug Channels Leadership Forum! This unique, new event will be held from March 17 to 19, 2025, at the Turnberry Resort and Spa in Miami. The Leadership Forum will be an executive gathering where drug channel leaders can network and discuss key issues and challenges facing the commercial healthcare system. We intend to bring together people from the entire drug channel: pharmaceutical manufacturers, pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), health plans, insurers, and plan sponsors, wholesalers and distributors, pharmacies, providers, buying groups, government officials, and more. I’m personally assembling the agenda, which will be a mix of one-on-one fireside chats with industry leaders combined with hard-hitting, topical panel discussions. And of course, I'll be there to moderate the entire event and lead the fireside chats. Thanks to DCI’s partnership with HMP Global, we can bring this novel event to the drug channels community. To maximize the value of networking and learning, the event will have a limited number of attendees. Click here to request an invitation. We will also have a very limited number of sponsors.
