        "text": "The British Generic Manufacturers Association (BGMA) in conjunction with the regulatory body the MHRA, runs a successful forum focusing on ensuring the manufacturing quality of generic medicines in the UK.\n\nThe group meets three times a year to share and discuss the latest issues which impact on the quality of generic medicines. The forum brings together generic medicines companies, those who provide manufacturing and quality control services, as well as the MHRA.\n\nPaul Fleming, the BGMA’s Technical Director, said: “As regulatory requirements and supply chains become ever more complex, supporting high quality standards is vitally important for the pharmaceutical industry, patients and the value we deliver to the NHS. From a generic medicines perspective, the forum is an important outlet which is closely aligned with the regulator allowing increased mutual understanding as well as the ability to share the latest information quickly and easily.\n\n“Quality is a key component in ensuring that patients get their medicines in a timely and affordable manner. Our forum provides a vital conduit between industry and the regulator on a topic which is critically important to the successful operation of the generic medicines marketplace in the UK, Europe and internationally.”\n\nThe BGMA operates through a series of expert working groups that cover Regulatory Affairs, Economic & Commercial (Pricing, Reimbursement, Market Access, etc), Secondary Care, Sustainability, NHS Partnership, Legal Issues and a specialist sector group on Biosimilars via our sister organisation the British Biosimilars Association (BBA www.britishbiosimilars.co.uk). These groups are overseen by the Board.\n\nThe working group chairs and vice-chairs are elected by the members of each group and ratified by the Board, which is the Association's decision making body and which meets six times a year.\n\nThe working group chairs and vice-chairs report and recommend to the Board, thus ensuring that the Association's policies and activities are member-driven and that all members have an equal input to the decision making.\n\nDisclosure of transfers of value in 2023\n\nAs an affiliate of Medicines for Europe, and based on its Code of Conduct, BGMA asks that member companies record and publish their transfers of value (in kind or actual) for the previous calendar year (2023) to healthcare professionals, healthcare organisations and patient organisations. Members can publish their return by any one of the following three ways:\n\nOn companies' websites\n\nOn other publicly accessible websites (notably on Disclosure UK)\n\nOn the BGMA's website\n\nThe following companies have requested for the BGMA to publish their annual transfers of value for 2023.\n\nCompany Name of healthcare organisation, patient organisation or number of healthcare professionals that received a transfer of value Category of transfer of value (fee for service / consultancy, conference, meeting or event sponsorship, grants and donations, other) Total value Aspire Pharma NHS Confederation Services Company Ltd Two conferences Â£9,150 Primary Care Respiratory Society UK Conference Â£4,233 Primary Care Commissioning CIC Conference Â£1,997 National Paediatric Respiratory & Allergy Nurses Group Meeting Meeting sponsorship Â£625 Antibiotic Research UK Charity donation towards the delivery of the charity's annual event Â£6,000 21 healthcare professionals All for consultancy support, ranging from Â£200 to Â£44,816.25, with an average fee of Â£3,306.81 Â£69,443 Hikma (UK) Nil return Niche Generics Limited Nil return Panpharma UK Ltd Nil return Reig Jofre UK Nil return Rivopharm UK Ltd Nil return\n\nFor queries, please contact robert.russellpavier@britishgenerics.co.uk"
