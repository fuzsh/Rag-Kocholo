        "text": "Judy Woodruff:\n\nThe first doses of the long-awaited COVID-19 vaccine are on their way to the United Kingdom, the first Western country to grant emergency authorization.\n\nThe vaccine, manufactured by U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, is yet to be approved in the U.S., it's already making its way to the U.K. from a factory in a tiny town in Belgium.\n\nSpecial correspondent Lucy Hough reports.\n\nLucy Hough:\n\nTrucks are carrying the temperature-sensitive COVID-19 vaccine to the U.K. from Pfizer's plant in Puurs, Belgium, where it is being manufactured on a massive scale. It's a process which began hours after the vaccine was authorized by U.K. health regulators; 800,000 doses will arrive in the coming days.\n\nThe first shipments mark a milestone for scientists at BioNTech, who partnered with Pfizer, and are now at the forefront of a medical and scientific breakthrough.\n\nKoen Van Den Heuvel:\n\nWe say now that the hope of the world is here in Puurs, and we are going to save the world. From here, you can export products worldwide in a fairly quick way. And that's our greatest advantage, our strategic asset.\n\nLucy Hough:\n\nPfizer began its operation here in the mid-1960s, when postwar investment flooded into Belgium. It now employs one in 10 people in the town, and has recruited extra numbers to cope with demand caused by the pandemic.\n\nSince the summer, the work force here has been concentrating on the rollout of the coronavirus vaccine. In the plant behind me is a sports stadium-sized facility packed with freezers ready to store hundreds of thousands of doses at minus-94 degrees, ready to be shipped out to the world.\n\nLocals are stunned to find themselves at the center of a global vaccine race. The Puurs plant will produce most of the 1.3 billion shots Pfizer hopes to deliver in 2021 globally. But living next door to a major pharmaceutical hub doesn't guarantee better access to a shot.\n\nLuc Lelievre:\n\nWe realized from the other day people are coming from all over. We had some Russians last week, some people from France. So, it's like the whole world discovered Puurs all of a sudden. And, yes, we're very proud of all of it, very happy.\n\nLucy Hough:\n\nA few miles south of Puurs, Brussels Airport is preparing for its role as a key distribution hub. A United Airlines flight has already flown from here to Chicago with the first mass air shipment in preparation for impending approval. The Pfizer vaccine requires extremely cold storage temperatures, others, standard refrigeration.\n\nPfizer has already slashed its original rollout targets due to obstacles in the cold chain. With each vaccine having different requirements in terms of transportation, packing and storage, global distribution will be no easy feat.\n\nNathan De Valck:\n\nWell, maintaining the right transport temperature to protect the packaging against temperature shocks is extremely important throughout the whole logistical supply chain.\n\nSo, in order to do that, we need the right type of infrastructure. And we have more than 30,000 square meters of temperature-controlled rooms at the airport.\n\nLucy Hough:\n\nPending authorization, the U.S. and Europe share a hope to begin administering the first vaccines by the end of this year, prioritizing front-line health workers and the most vulnerable.\n\nThe U.S. expects to receive a total of 40 million doses from Pfizer and competitor Moderna by the end of this year. That's enough to vaccinate 20 million people.\n\nThe vaccines are one of four that could be rolled out globally by spring 2021, offering hope for an end to the pandemic that has already claimed 1.5 million lives.\n\nFor the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I'm Lucy Hough in Puurs."
