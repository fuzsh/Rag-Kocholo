        "text": "Get the latest Covid-19 booster updates, from what the side effects are, to how long boosters take to be effective.\n\nUpdated 2 October 2023\n\nWhat's on this page\n\nTop questions\n\nWho is being offered a Covid-19 booster?\n\nHow long does the booster last, and how effective is it?\n\nHow long does it take for the booster to be effective?\n\nI am immunosuppressed or immunocompromised, can I have a booster?\n\nWhat is a dual vaccine, or Omicron booster?\n\nCovid-19 booster side effects\n\nWhat are the side effects of the booster, and how long do they last?\n\nWhat are the side effects of the Moderna booster?\n\nWhat are the side effects of the Pfizer booster?\n\nIs myocarditis more common after the booster vaccine?\n\nTop questions\n\nWho is being offered a Covid-19 booster?\n\nThe vaccine is the best way to protect yourself against serious illness and hospitalisation from Covid-19. This is why people at higher risk, such as older people and those in clinical risk groups, are being offered another booster dose this autumn. The following groups are eligible:\n\nresidents in a care home for older adults\n\nall adults aged 65 years and over\n\npeople aged 6 months to 64 years in a clinical risk group, such as people who are pregnant or immunosuppressed (a full list is laid out in the Covid-19 Immunisation Green Book)\n\nfrontline health and social care workers\n\npeople aged 12 to 64 years who are household contacts of someone who is immunosuppressed (as detailed in the Green Book)\n\npeople aged 16 to 64 years who are carers or staff working in care homes for older adults (as detailed in the Green Book).\n\nIf you are in one of these groups, you can book your booster by visiting the NHS website, using the NHS App or calling 119. You may also be offered a vaccination by GP surgeries or other local NHS services.\n\nThe Covid-19 virus is constantly changing. This means that even if you have had the vaccine before, your level of immunity is likely to be weaker than it was last year. Because of this, the NHS is encouraging those eligible to top up their protection as soon as possible ahead of the winter months.\n\nHow long does the booster last, and how effective is it?\n\nResearch published in the Lancet in July 2023 looked at how effective a third dose of the monovalent vaccine is at preventing hospitalisation from Covid-19. In people aged 65 or over, the vaccine was 50% effective at preventing serious illness, for up to six months after a third dose. More than a year (14 months) after vaccination, the effectiveness was still about the same level. In people aged 18 to 64 years, the vaccine was 30% effective after six months.\n\nThe research also looked at the effectiveness of the autumn 2022 bivalent booster. Having this booster meant that two to four weeks later, people aged 50 years and older had an extra 53% protection compared to those who didn't have it.\n\nAdditionally, a study published in The Lancet in April 2023 found that people over 65 who had the bivalent booster were 72% less likely to need a hospital visit and 68% less likely to die from Covid-19, compared to people over 65 who did not receive a bivalent booster.\n\nHow long does it take for the booster to be effective?\n\nStudies have shown very high protection begins one or two weeks after receiving the booster jab.\n\nA trial by Pfizer suggests that from seven days onwards, a booster dose of Pfizer is extremely effective at preventing illness from Covid-19.\n\nI am immunosuppressed or immunocompromised, can I have a booster?\n\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has recommended that everyone over 6 months with a weakened immune system has an autumn booster.\n\nThis includes people whose immune systems do not work properly due to disease or treatment. For example, organ transplant recipients, those taking steroids, or cancer patients who are having chemotherapy. See Table 3 of the Covid-19 Immunisation Green Book for a full list.\n\nWhat is a dual vaccine, or Omicron booster?\n\nUpdated versions of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have been approved for use in the UK.\n\nThese updated vaccines are 'bivalent' vaccines, which means they offer protection against both the original coronavirus, as well as the Omicron variants BA.4 and BA.5. You might also see them referred to as a ‘dual vaccine’, ‘dual variant vaccine’ or ‘Omicron booster’.\n\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI)’s guidance is that getting any Covid jab is more important than receiving a particular vaccine.\n\nWe're here for you with information and support\n\nOur fortnightly Heart Matters newsletter includes the latest updates about staying healthy when you have a heart condition, such as support for healthy eating, staying active and your emotional wellbeing.\n\nI'd like to sign up\n\nBooster side effects\n\nWhat are the side effects of the booster, and how long do they last?\n\nSide effects of the booster are likely to be mild and short-lived. They often include things like pain or tenderness where you had the injection, fatigue, and headache.\n\nFor more information about the side effects of Covid-19 vaccines, please visit the NHS website.\n\nWhat are the side effects of the Moderna booster?\n\nSide effects for the Moderna vaccine when used as a booster include pain or tenderness where you had the injection, swelling of the lymph nodes in the arm where you had the injection, tiredness, headache, muscle or joint pain, chills, nausea, vomiting, fever, or rash.\n\nThese side effects are similar whether you have the Moderna bivalent vaccine (also known as Omicron booster) or the original Moderna vaccine.\n\nIf you do experience side effects, these are likely to be mild and last no more than a few days.\n\nFind out more information about possible side effects for the Moderna vaccine.\n\nWhat are the side effects of the Pfizer booster?\n\nSymptoms for the Pfizer booster may include pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache, muscle and joint pain, fever and chills. The side effects may be milder after a booster than after previous doses.\n\nResearch from the UK COV-Boost trial suggests that Pfizer as a booster could have fewer side effects than Moderna, although there were some differences between different groups (see what are the side effects of the Moderna booster?)\n\nGet more information about possible side effects of the Pfizer vaccine.\n\nIs myocarditis more common after the booster vaccine?\n\nMyocarditis and pericarditis are very rare side effects of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.\n\nData published by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) shows that myocarditis and pericarditis are less common after a booster jab, than after the first two doses of the vaccine, and this risk is already very small.\n\nRead more about the Covid-19 vaccines and the rare risk of myocarditis."
