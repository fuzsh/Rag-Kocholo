Let the person giving you the vaccine know if you feel faint or lightheaded.\n\nHow soon can I have the vaccine after surgery or having a stent?\n\nYou may be asked to wait a few days between surgery and getting your vaccine. This is so that any reaction you have to the operation can be separated from any reaction to the vaccination.\n\nIf you’ve had a stent fitted (angioplasty), it does not necessarily need to cause any delay with getting your vaccine, especially if the procedure was planned and there are no complications.\n\nIf you’re not sure, check with the medical team who looked after you when you had your stent fitted.\n\nIs the vaccine safe for people taking heart medications?\n\nYes, the Covid-19 vaccine is safe for people taking heart medications. This includes beta blockers, statins, blood pressure drugs and other heart medicines.\n\nYour medication will not stop the vaccine from working, and the vaccine will not cause problems with your medication.\n\nIs the vaccine safe for people taking blood thinners (anticoagulants)?\n\nIn general, yes, but you should let the person giving you the vaccine know that you are taking an anticoagulant. As with any injection, there is some risk of bleeding.\n\nThe Covid-19 vaccine is injected into the muscle of your upper arm. Injections into your muscle may bleed a little more than injections that are given under the skin, but less than those that are given into a vein.\n\nIf you are taking a blood thinner such as warfarin, or a new anticoagulant called a DOAC (direct oral anticoagulants), the bleeding may take a little longer to stop and you may get more bruising on your upper arm.\n\nPublic Health England and the UK Department of Health have said that you can have the vaccine if your anticoagulant treatment is stable.\n\nThat means that you will have been taking the same dose for a while and, if you are on warfarin, your INR checks are up to date and your latest INR level was in the right range.\n\nIs the vaccine safe for people taking antiplatelet drugs?\n\nYes, the vaccine is safe for people taking clopidogrel and other antiplatelet medications. You may experience a little more bruising around the injection site.\n\nEffectiveness\n\nDo Covid-19 vaccines work?\n\nCovid-19 vaccines have been proven to be very effective at preventing serious illness, hospitalisation and death from the virus.\n\nWe also know that boosters offer more protection against serious illness and hospitalisation from Covid-19, which is why it’s important to have a booster if you are offered one.\n\nResults of the COALESCE study, published in January 2024, looked at the health records of 67 million people aged five and over in the UK from 1 June to 30 September 2022.\n\nThe researchers found that not having all eligible Covid-19 vaccine doses was associated with more hospitalisations and deaths across all age groups.\n\nThe study also found that people aged 75 and above who did not receive all the doses they were eligible for were twice as likely to become severely ill with Covid-19, compared to those who were fully vaccinated.\n\nThe researchers estimated that 7,180 hospitalisations and deaths could have been prevented if the UK population had been fully vaccinated in the four months from 1 June to 30 September 2022.\n\nPeople aged 75 and over are also eligible for the Sanofi/GSK monovalent booster vaccine.\n\nIn a May 2024 study of over 14,000 people from this age group published in the journal eClinicalMedicine, the Sanofi/GSK booster was around 30 per cent effective at preventing hospitalisation five to nine weeks following vaccination.\n\nVisit the NHS for more information on the effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines.\n\nCan they prevent heart problems?\n\nThere is some evidence that Covid-19 vaccines are associated with a lower risk of heart attack and stroke.\n\nThis may be because Covid-19 is linked to a higher risk of blood clots. These can block blood supply to the heart or the brain, which is the cause of heart attacks and stroke.\n\nA study of nearly 46 million adults in England published in July 2024 in the journal Nature Communications found that in the 13 to 24 weeks after the first dose of any Covid-19 vaccine doctors saw 10% fewer cases of blood clots in the arteries (arterial thromboses) including heart attacks and strokes, than they did in those who did not get vaccinated.\n\nAnd 13-24 weeks after a second dose of the Pfizer vaccine, the incidence of these events was 20 per cent lower in this group compared to those who only had one dose of Covid-19 vaccine, reported the study which was part funded by British Heart Foundation (BHF).\n\nThe research was led by the universities of Cambridge, Bristol and Edinburgh and enabled by BHF Data Science Centre at Health Data Research UK.\n\nCo-first author Dr Samantha Ip, a research associate at the University of Cambridge, said: “This research further supports the large body of evidence on the effectiveness of the Covid-19 vaccination programme, which has been shown to provide protection against severe Covid-19 and saved millions of lives worldwide.”\n\nHow long do they stay effective?\n\nResearch suggests that the vaccine is effective at preventing serious illness for at least six months.\n\nA February 2023 report by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) found that six months after the bivalent vaccine (bivalent means it targets two strains of Covid-19), most people can expect some degree of protection, with around 60 per cent vaccine effectiveness against serious illness.\n\nMeanwhile, research published in The Lancet in July 2023 found that a third dose of the monovalent vaccine (which only targets one strain) was around 50 per cent effective at preventing hospitalisation from Covid-19 for up to 14 months in people aged 65 or over.\n\nAnd for people aged between 18 and 64, the vaccine was 18 per cent effective at preventing serious illness 12 to 14 months after a third dose.\n\nHow quickly do they work?\n\nIt may take a few weeks to build up protection from your first dose of Covid-19 vaccine. Your body should respond more quickly to any future doses.\n\nSide effects\n\nWhat side effects do the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have?\n\nLike all medicines, vaccines can cause side effects, although many people do not get any side effects at all.\n\nIn the UK, tens of millions of people have now had a Covid-19 vaccine, and reports of serious side effects have been very small.\n\nThe vast majority of side effects for both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are mild and short-term.\n\nThe most common are:\n\npain at the injection site\n\ntiredness\n\nheadache\n\nmuscle pain\n\nchills\n\nThe Moderna vaccine can also give you joint pain.\n\nTry not to worry if your arm starts to hurt the next day. This is not a cause for concern and will usually be gone within a day or two.\n\nThese side effects tend to be stronger after the second dose, but should still only last a day or two.\n\nOften side effects are just a sign that the vaccine is doing its job.\n\nSome people might feel slightly unwell because their immune system is responding to the protein, but this is not Covid-19 and the vaccine cannot give you the virus.\n\nYou can take paracetamol to treat any of these side effects.\n\nWhat side effects does the Sanofi/GSK vaccine have?\n\nAs with other Covid-19 vaccines, you’re very unlikely to get any serious side effects, as these are very rare.\n\nSome people experience temporary side effects such as:\n\nsoreness at the injection site\n\ntiredness\n\nheadache\n\nfever\n\nmuscle pain\n\njoint pain\n\nYou can take paracetamol to treat these, and they do not usually last for more than a couple of days.\n\nGetting the vaccine\n\nWho can get a Covid-19 vaccine?\n\nThe Covid-19 vaccine is now only available on the NHS at certain times of year, such as spring and autumn, for people at risk of serious illness.\n\nThis includes:\n\nresidents in a care home for older adults\n\nall adults aged 75 years and over\n\npeople aged six months to 74 years with a weakened immune system (immunosuppression)\n\nHowever, the criteria may change in the future.\n\nIf you do not belong to any of these groups, you may wish to consider getting a Covid-19 vaccine privately, which costs between £45 up to £100 at a pharmacy.\n\nRead more about vaccine booster programmes.\n\nHow to book a vaccine appointment\n\nIf you are eligible, you should be invited by your GP or the NHS to book an appointment when seasonal programmes start again.\n\nIn England you can book online or attend a walk-in appointment at a pharmacy.\n\nIn Northern Ireland you can book an appointment at a Trust clinic. Some walk-in appointments may also be available — visit the Trust's website for more information\n\nIf you live in Scotland, you can book online or attend a walk-in clinic\n\nIf you live in Wales, details on how to book can be found on your health board's website\n\nYou need to be registered with a GP to book your vaccine appointment.\n\nAnyone in the UK can register with a GP.\n\nFind out more information about registering with a GP.\n\nWhat to read next..."
