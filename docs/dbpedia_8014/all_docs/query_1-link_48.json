        "text": "When I made the difficult decision to leave my practice as a physician and join the biopharmaceutical industry, I was motivated by the exponential impact I could have on people’s lives. Looking back, my gut instinct proved to be right. From the start, human ingenuity, and the drive to translate science into healthcare breakthroughs has fueled a deep optimism which has guided my career. I’ve witnessed scientific advances that were unimaginable in my early days, and discoveries that have changed the lives of millions of people. I’ve worked alongside extraordinary scientists and colleagues, been challenged in my assumptions, and have allowed inspiration to strike from unexpected sources. Over the course of my 15-year career at Pfizer, surrounded by thousands of brilliant medicine and vaccine hunters, I’ve had the humbling privilege of delivering more than 35 innovative approvals. No doubt, the honor of a lifetime. I’ve arrived at another pivotal point in my life and career, and it’s again time to make a difficult decision. The decision to leave Pfizer is not one that came quickly or easily, however, I again rely on my gut instinct to guide me forward. Over the coming months, it will be my privilege to work with Albert Bourla to find the next leader for Pfizer Research & Development. As I think about the next chapter in my life, I continue with steadfast optimism for what the future holds for human health – knowing science will continue to deliver discoveries that today seem inconceivable. I hope that I can contribute to the next wave of breakthroughs in exciting, new ways, working with the next generation of scientific leaders who are pushing the boundaries of science. This rewarding career would have been impossible without the selfless and unwavering support of my wife and children. Their sacrifices were many – moving across the globe and sustaining me through long hours. I’m looking forward to showing them how very grateful I am, playing more chess, and hopefully, training one of our dogs. I will always be rooting for science and my wonderful Pfizer family. It has been my honor to work alongside this talented, committed, and driven group of people. Thank you for the opportunity and the passion, for finding a path to a breakthrough where we thought there was none, and for always believing that #ScienceWillWin https://lnkd.in/eyMvZCCf"
