        "text": "Topline\n\nBritain’s drug regulator has advised people with a history of “significant” allergies to avoid the Covid-19 vaccine produced by Pfizer and BioNTech after two healthcare workers experienced severe allergic reactions on the first day of the vaccine’s rollout, leading many to question whether or not it is safe to receive the shot, which is expected to be authorized for emergency use in the U.S. this week.\n\nKey Facts\n\nKey Background\n\nThe U.K., which approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine last week, kicked off a nationwide immunization campaign Tuesday. Other regulators are clearly happy with the vaccine’s safety, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which has already released a report deeming the vaccine to most likely be safe and to meet its standards. This report does outline a very small number of people who potentially experienced an allergic reaction, though it is unclear how severe these might have been. This figure was marginally higher in those receiving the vaccine (0.63%) than those receiving a placebo (0.51%).\n\nWhat We Don’t Know\n\nAs Shakir notes, many more people are exposed to vaccines after they are authorized, opening the possibilities for unexpected reactions. It is possible more could emerge, which is why vaccinators are vigilant. While the U.K.’s response may seem heavy handed for just two allergic reactions, experts have praised the speed and robust nature of the regulator’s response, indicating an effective monitoring system for any future issues.\n\nWhat To Watch For\n\nThe U.K. was fast in approving Pfizer’s vaccine, and other regulators are expected to follow shortly. Canada, for example, authorized the vaccine for emergency use Wednesday, a day after reports of allergic reactions. Another vaccine, from Moderna, is also undergoing review, and will also need to be reviewed for possible adverse events once rolled out.\n\nCrucial Quote\n\nProfessor Peter Openshaw, a professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London said: “As with all food and medications, there is a very small chance of an allergic reaction to any vaccine. However, it is important that we put this risk in perspective.” He said Pfizer and BioNTech had monitored the possibility of allergic reactions and reported “a very small number... in both the vaccine and placebo” groups of the phase 3 clinical trial.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nU.K. Regulator Warns People With ‘Significant’ Allergies To Avoid Pfizer-BioNTech Vaccine (Forbes)\n\nFDA Review Of Pfizer Vaccine Data Confirms Protection Against Covid-19 Infection (Forbes)\n\n‘V-Day’: U.K. Kicks Off Western World’s First Covid-19 Vaccination Campaign (Forbes)\n\nHere’s Why The U.K. Beat The U.S. To Approve A Covid-19 Vaccine For Emergency Use (Forbes)\n\nThe U.S. Has Ordered Enough Of Pfizer’s Covid-19 Vaccine For 50 Million People—But That’s All (Forbes)\n\nTrump Wants To Go Down In History As The Man Who Ended Covid-19, Claiming Moderna Vaccine Success As His Own (Forbes)\n\nPfizer Board Member Gottlieb Confirms Trump Administration Rejected ‘Multiple’ Offers For More Vaccine Doses (Forbes)"
