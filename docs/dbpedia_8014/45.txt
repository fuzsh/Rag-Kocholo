Welcome to the Pfizer UK Molecule to Market Virtual Experience Programme. We are so excited to have you here!

You can get a taste of what it’s like to work for Pfizer, one of the world’s premier biopharmaceutical companies. If you’re interested in science but want to know what else is out there apart from being a nurse, researcher or doctor or are interested in business that creates real change to deliver ‘Breakthroughs that change patients’ lives’, come on in!

We don’t just do research. You can learn how to get new medicines into the hands of patients that need them. You’ll discover all the parts that come after the crucial science-based steps of our awesome research & development scientists. Take a look behind the scenes at the pharmaceutical industry and join some of our team members to go through how a new medicine is reimbursed for use in the NHS in the UK, how to develop a market position for it and how to build a ‘go to market’ strategy.
