Steve Mason is the hard-working foreman at the Imperial Iron Works, with big ideas and an even bigger heart. John Stillman, the elderly owner of the foundry, takes him under his wing after the mason impresses him with his cost-cutting methods. Upon the old man's death, Steve inherits both his factory and fortune. This creates resentment among the spoiled members of Stillman's family, including his pretty young daughter, Janet. Bad feelings turn to outright rebellion when he decides to limit their out-of-control spending. Looking for payback, Janet steals the company from right under its new owner's nose with the help of one of her father's old business rivals. With the ousted Steve preparing to head to the unemployment line, Janet finds herself having second thoughts when she realizes that she has fallen in love with the stalwart young man.

Based on a novel by French author Georges Ohnet, The Iron Master had already been adapted to film multiple times by the time of its 1933 release. The most popular of these was American Methods (1917) starring William Farnum. This Allied Pictures production, however, is the first made during the sound era. Ironically, it would be upstaged overseas when legendary director Abel Gance released his own version in French only a few months later. Star Reginald Denny had been a popular leading man during the silent era, but the advent of sound and his heavy British accent caused the actor some difficulty during this transitional period. Afterwards he found his niche playing supporting parts in films such as The Little Minister (1934), Anna Karenina (1935), and Rebecca (1940). The lovely Lila Lee co-starred with Rudolph Valentino in Blood and Sand (1922) and Lon Chaney in The Unholy Three (1930).
