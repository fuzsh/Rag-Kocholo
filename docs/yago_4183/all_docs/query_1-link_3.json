        "text": "Description\n\nIM2000 Self Spotting Machine\n\nThe Ironmaster IM2000 Self-Spotting Machine is the culmination of a decades-long process of designing a multi-functional gym machine that is compact, long-lasting, and easy to use.\n\nPatterned after the traditional Smith machine but with notable improvements over its forerunner, the IM2000 allows you to do a wide range of exercises to target all your muscle groups without taking up a lot of space.\n\nThis is the latest model of the Ironmaster machine and while it has many improvements over older models, it still has the core design features that makes it so amazing to have in your gym. Our unique and patented quick-lock guided barbell system guarantees its smooth operation, long service life, and most importantly, your safety.\n\nExtremely safe\n\nWith the IM2000 Self-Spotting Machine, you can train each body part in at least three different ways safely. It is packed with safety features like lockout holes that are accurately measured and placed at close intervals so you can have the confidence to work out on your own.\n\nPerform presses and squats alone without worrying about your safety.\n\nThe lockout holes are only 1.7 inches apart to ensure that you won't get stuck while working out alone.\n\nHeavy-duty springs provide additional support for the lifting bar.\n\nSecondary safety stops offer added protection as well as limit the range of the cable system.\n\nThis machine allows you to reach your maximum muscle failure without increasing your risk for injury.\n\nMulti-functional and complete\n\nYou can target each body part in different ways using this versatile machine and the several attachments that are compatible with it. The IM2000 is the perfect self-spotting weight lifting system for any home gym owner who prefers doing full-body workouts.\n\nTrain your shoulders, chest, back, arms, legs and core with this all-around training system.\n\nPerform a variety of exercises to target different body parts using the several attachments that you can connect to this self-spotting machine. (See the IM2000 poster for some of the exercises you can do with it.)\n\nYou will find there almost unlimited ways to use this system.\n\nHeavy-duty and long-lasting\n\nThe IM2000 Self-Spotting Machine is made of superior quality, commercial-grade materials and has a high weight load capacity for its lifting bar and cable system. Our unique patented design for its slide rails prevents friction and premature wear.\n\nThe frame is constructed from 11 gauge structural steel.\n\nThe lifting bar is rated for 1,000 lbs.\n\nThe cable system is rated for 350 lbs.\n\nOur unique slide bushing and slide rail system do not require constant lubrication with grease. This means less mess and dirt sticking to your machine, which leads to premature deterioration.\n\nUnlike other multi-functional machines and designs that use plastic bushings, we use a special polymer bushing to ensure a smooth sliding action over our specially coated slide rails made of compatible materials.\n\nOur patented design for the IM2000 has proven its ability to perform smoothly and stand the test of time in schools, police and fire departments and commercial and home gyms around the world.\n\nSpace-efficient and relatively lightweight\n\nThe IM2000 Self-Spotting Machine was developed to give you optimum workout capabilities while occupying a relatively small footprint and weighing relatively less than commercial gym equipment. This is why it's perfect for home gyms or personal use.\n\nFrame dimensions are 48 inches wide x 48 inches deep, x 84.5 inches high.\n\nThe lifting bar is 73 inches wide. It weighs 36 lbs with the Olympic Sleeve Adapters and 32 lbs without them. The grip width area of the bar is 42 inches and 1.25\" diameter.\n\nWe recommend allotting a floor space of 7 feet wide x 5-6 feet deep and a ceiling height of at least 87 inches for assembly clearance and use. (Note: you will need more height with the optional Ultimate Chin Up). If you have any questions regarding ceiling clearance, please contact Customer Service.\n\nErgonomically designed\n\nThe ergonomic design of the IM2000 Self-Spotting Machine allows you to perform exercises more effectively and naturally. With a simple modification of its parts, you can do a completely different set of exercises that target other parts of your body.\n\nThe ergonomic lifting bar locks out to the front instead of to the back for a faster and more natural movement, making it easy to switch to heavier weights when doing press exercises like the bench press.\n\nThe construction of the high/low pulley system that makes use of the weight carriage offers a smoother, more comfortable and free-flowing movement.\n\nThe low pulley device has wheels that allow it to easily swing into place.\n\nBudget-friendly\n\nUsing the base frame of the IM2000 Self-Spotting System as your foundation, you can build your own custom exercise machine by adding other attachments and accessories. This offers bigger savings compared to purchasing several different cages and machines or getting a membership at a commercial gym.\n\nEasy to assemble\n\nApart from that, this machine comes with an assembly guide and hardware kit for easier installation.\n\nYou only need two adjustable wrenches to put all the parts together.\n\nYour purchase includes a hardware kit that contains all the other tools you will need to set up your IM2000.\n\nAssembly and operating instructions are included.\n\nNotes:\n\nThe IM2000 Self-Spotting Machine is only the base model. The Super Bench, weights and other attachments shown in the photos are not included. They are sold separately and available for purchase in custom packages.\n\nBase unit includes the following:\n\nmain frame\n\nlifting bar with Olympic adapters (for use with both standard and Olympic weight plates)\n\nstandard plate holders\n\nlat pull bar\n\nupper and lower pulley/cable system\n\nPlease allocate 2 weeks for shipping. This Ironmaster product is usually delivered via truck for the lower 48 US states. Please contact us if you want it delivered in other destinations."
