        "text": "Description\n\nSuper Bench PRO V2\n\nThe best got even better! You asked, so here it is, the improved Super Bench PRO Version 2 with customer-driven updates: Loaded with new upgrades while retaining all the great features of the Super Bench PRO and the original Super Bench. The Super Bench PRO bench has been discontinued and replaced by the V2.\n\nSummary of Main Improvements\n\nBelow are the key modifications we made on the Super Bench PRO (SB PRO #1002) to transform it into Version 2:\n\nIntegrated bench handle makes it easier to tilt and roll.\n\nLaser etched numbers on the locking ring so you will always be sure of the exact pressing angle. (Numbers on one side as shown)\n\nStandard hybrid dual width bench pad. Uses our original heavy duty leather pattern vinyl and gives you two width zones.\n\nAdditional higher incline seat tube insertion point for better overhead pressing position.\n\nFully adjustable and functional\n\nPerform different kinds of exercises with the Super Bench PRO V2. Its 11 lock-out angles give you incline, decline, flat and upright positions for a wide range of movements.\n\nThis bench can be angled at 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 85 degrees.\n\nNote: we recommend using the Crunch Situp attachment with the bench for decline angles to help hold your legs. Minimal angles are possible without the attachment.\n\nThe incline seat has 3 positions. The incline seat height in the 85 degree position can be set to either 12.5\", 14.5\" or 23.5\" from the floor, while the top of main pad is 24.5\" above the seat in the highest position. Top of main pad is 35.5\" in the lowest incline seat position. 33.5\" in the center position.\n\nStands up vertically to save space.\n\nBase dimensions: narrow foot is 12.5\" wide and longer foot is 21\" wide. Bench length is 47\" overall.\n\nCompatible with the Ironmaster Super Bench System of Attachments\n\nThe Super Bench PRO V2 can be outfitted with most Super Bench attachments. All accessories with names that have /PRO in the are completely compatible with it. If you're unsure of the compatibility or need an adapter for some of your equipment, feel free to get in touch with us.\n\nUse with Ironmaster attachments like the Crunch Sit-up, Dip Bar Handles, Chin Up Bar, and Preacher Curl.\n\nThe Leg Attachment PRO designed for leg extensions and leg curls is designed to fit this new bench specifically.\n\nUse with the Cable Tower, Hypercore and more. Note: We have developed a new universal bench adapter, which is included in current stocks of the Cable Tower. This can be purchased separately if you have and older standard Cable Tower pieces that were only made to fit the original Super Bench.\n\nComfortable workouts\n\nFrom its lower height to the solid feel of its commercial quality pad, the Super Bench PRO is designed with your comfort in mind.\n\nIts high-density commercial grade pad is 44\" x (10.25\"/12.25\") x 2.5\" thick and makes use of durably stitched vinyl upholstery making it firm and comfortable.\n\nThe incline seat pad is tapered towards the front to give your legs more room to move and can be adjusted up or down for optimum comfort.\n\nThe incline seat moves with the backrest pad at any angle so they will always be perpendicular to each other, unlike other benches where the seat can have a shallow angle causing the user to slide off. This seat can be removed, leaving a large gapless pad.\n\nEasy to assemble\n\nApart from the feet, the Super Bench PRO is pre-assembled upon shipping. It only requires simple tools to set up so you can practically start working out a few minutes after taking it out of the box!\n\nPre-assembled parts will save you time and effort in setting it up.\n\nThe dual-position incline seat easily plugs in from the side without any pins.\n\nIts unique machine-cut ring with foot lever adjustment can be operated from both sides of the bench and clicks into place instantly for secure positioning (patented design US 6,994,661).\n\nCompact, lightweight and movable\n\nThe Super Bench PRO V2 is the ultimate space saver in your gym. Compact and lightweight but still ultra strong. Wheels and a convenient handle have also been included as a standard accessory for the equipment instead of an optional add-on so you can move the bench around your gym or roll it out of the way after use with ease.\n\nEverything stays intact even when you lift or move the bench. Nothing unfolds or needs to be dismantled prior to moving it around.\n\nThe bench alone weighs 65lbs without the incline seat and 69 with it. (Shipping weight 79lbs at 50\" x 13\" x 19\".)\n\nIts ultra-strong platform is still light enough to lift and move even without using the wheels.\n\nComplete with transport wheels on the longer foot tube. (You can install the wheels on either end of the bench as desired; plus, kits for both an additional wheel kit and bench handle are available if you want to have wheels and handles on both ends!)\n\nSuperior construction\n\nLike its predecessors, the Super Bench PRO V2 is manufactured from top-rated materials for superior build quality.\n\nConstructed from 11 & 12 gauge super strong steel frame, this bench has a 1000-lb weight load capacity in the flat position.\n\nIt has a 600-lb weight load capacity in incline and upright positions.\n\nIt includes a unique laser-cut ring with foot lever adjustment that can be operated from both sides of the bench (patented design US 6,994,661).\n\nIts high-density and thick commercial grade pad is furnished with durable vinyl upholstery.\n\nFor extra protection against rust and wear and tear, the Super Bench PRO V2 is equipped with a textured, black powder-coated frame with chrome components.\n\nHere is what makes this model different than the original Super Bench:"
