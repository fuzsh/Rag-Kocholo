A campaign can be set in the sprawling City of Splendors itself, or Waterdeep can be used as a model of a fantasy city by DMs wishing to create their own large port cities without using the FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign setting. Waterdeep is a city of intrigue and wonders; in its streets and buildings can be found almost every variety of beings and activities, goods, and interests. Carefully handled, the City will come to life, and give players and Dungeon Masters a continuing, ever-developing locale in which characters can adventure, to return to as a base while adventuring up and down the Sword Coast by ship or in the wilderland of the North. I know. Waterdeep can serve such a longlasting role in a campaign, because the City of Splendors was the beginning of my original FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign, and has been used continuously in play since then, providing delights and challenges for characters from levels 0 through 16 down the years from 1975 and the original D&D® boxed set through the multi-volume AD&D® rule books of today. This book describes the major features of ants, and the layout of the City wards, but life in Waterdeep, some important inhabitleaves room for DMs to develop their own characters and local details. For those employing the FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign setting, a section on the Citys surroundings is included, and for all AD&D game players, a number of possible adventures set in the City, or beginning within its walls, are described. These are largely presented in outline form, so that DMs can change characters, settings, treasures, and the pacing to suit their own campaigns. The next chapter tries to give you somefied to better suit their own adventures. thing of the feel of life in Waterdeep, and describes money and commerce, some of the natural hazards of City life, and current events of interest. The sections that follow detail in turn the various Factions and Guilds active in the City; the Noble Families of Waterdeep; and individual Non-Player Characters (NPCs) suitable for use in play. Suggested adventures involving the City of Splendors are then given, and our book closes with a description of the Citys immediate surroundings. We begin with brief summaries of the geography and history of the North, and then of the City of Splendors, providing an understanding of why Waterdeep is the way it is, and a guide for DM innovations. A summary of the government, laws, and how justice is enforced and administered in the City of Splendors follows. Each of the districts, or wards of the City is then viewed. DMs should note that many buildings remain open for use in their own adventures, and most structures in Waterdeep are three or four storeys in height, containing private apartments or offices (not detailed herein) above the street-level shops. DMs should bear in mind that many minor features of Waterdeep change with time, and can readily be modi2 Well met, all! I give you Waterdeep; my city. Let it now be your city, too, and if you treat Waterdeep as a real place, as I have done, it will live for you, too. Many happy hours of AD&D game play in a campaign can use only those details of the Citys streets and people contained herein. Further development of Waterdeeps sewers, dungeons, and intrigue could even keep a campaign going for years without any player character ever setting foot outside the City walls. So read on, and walk the streets of Waterdeep the Great, Crown of the North, with (of course) the standard warning: keep weapon to hand and eyes attentive...\n\nChapter 1: AN INTRODUCTION TO THE NORTH The North is a term applied to many different areas of Faerûn, depending upon whos speaking. In these pages, and in tradetalk over much of the Realms, it refers to that area between the Sword Coast and Anauroch (the Great Desert). The southern boundary of this region is the cause of much dispute. To many a satrap of Calimshan, the cold land of savages and beasts begins at the northern border of Amn. To a Waterdhavian (a native of Waterdeep), the North begins at the City and stretches due east to the Desert, taking in everything north of that line. Most sages agree that the North begins somewhere to the south of that, but they disagree on just where. Most use the Winding Water as a boundary. This book uses the Waterdhavian boundary. The North has been known as the Savage Frontier for many years. It is a rugged, heavily wooded wilderness only lightly ruled by humans. Such civilization envelops the coastal regions (as far inland as the Long Road that runs from Mirabar to Waterdeep) securely; the vast, open rolling valley lands of the river Dessarin less securely; and the eastern region, dominated by the High Forest and mountains, only as far as the points of their ready swords. One thousand years ago, the North consisted of a number of civilized elven and dwarvish realms surrounded by a wilderness roamed by fearsome monsters, and such races as orcs, trolls, hobgoblins, and bugbears. Human tribes were few and primitive, dwelling along the coast. The lower birth rates of the demi-human races rendered them less able to replace casualties suffered in their almost continual fighting with the aggressive humanoids, and with the years their number dwindled. They have been steadily pushed southward by the ever-expanding, fecund orc tribes, abandoning realm after realm, or being overwhelmed by numbers and slaughtered. The many resulting, largely-empty dwarven delves and holds are what human adventurers refer to as dungeons. The demi-humans, although they achieved many splendid victories in battle, could not stem the humanoid tide even when they united (see the Fallen Kingdom, page 5). Today, the dwarves remain only around the richest mithril mines in the North, and no known elven settlements of any size exist north of Evereska. The rise of human power in the North outstripped even the growth of the orcs, and prevented the collapse of civilization in the area. The North remains a land of riches, mineral wealth equalled nowhere else in the known Realms, and seemingly endless strands of timber of a size not often found elsewhere. Game is plentiful, and the landscape is beautiful. But danger is always lurking; for the most part, the law of the North is the law of the sword. Traveler, you have been warned. TRADE AND TRAVEL IN THE NORTH There are fortunes to be made in the North, for those willing to risk its dangers. Sword Coast shipping is imperilled by the often fierce weather and by piracy (sometimes covertly supported by Luskan, a city which would like to control all waterborne trade). Overland travel is menaced by many monsters, an as a result is usually in the form of large, well-armed caravans, accompanied by clerics and magic-users if possible. The terrain and the need for constant vigilance keeps caravan travel slow. Twenty-five miles a day is a very respectable pace. Horses and draft oxen cannot be used to exhaustion when one might be attacked at any moment. Naval travel averages twice that daily rate. The northernmost settlements of the Sword Coast exist because of rich mines, and sent their ores south by ship. Mirabar, inland, is the richest of these, and must send its metals overland to its Southern markets via the Long Road, or by road to the port of Luskan (the river Mirar is not navigable). From Luskan, the older, High Road runs along the coast to Port Llast and Neverwinter. It continues through Leilon, cutting east around the Men, and thence to Waterdeep Mere of Dead The Long Road runs south from Mirabar through the desolate Crags, to the village of Longsaddle, past Beruns Hill, and thence to Triboar. The Dessarian grasslands open out to the east of the Road here, stretching south to the sea at Waterdeep. The Long Road continues beside the Dessarin to the City, through a series of small settlements spaced a days travel or so apart. To the east, in the Dessarian valley lies Nesmé, the only settlement in an area roamed by trolls. The lands to the east of the valley are largely uncivilized, although they once held great kingdoms of dwarves and men and elves. From the Ice Mountains (known to be home to remorhaz and frost giants) to the north, this region descends into lesser peaks where orcs dwell in uncounted thousands. Whenever their numbers grow intolerably great for the available territory, the orcs issue forth in great hordes and sweep south. They have taken one city, The Citadel of Many Arrows, and their numbers are more than sufficient to hold it. The mithril mines (the richest delvings known to exist in all Faerûn) keep the dwarves in the northeast, where their mighty fortress, Citadel Adbar, and savage courage keep the orcs at bay. A trade-road built by the ancient dwarven King Adbar brings the wealth of the dwarves south, and then the road branches east to Ascore and west to the fortified city of Sundabar. From Sundabar trade can go west overland to Silverymoon, largest city of the far North, and (for the warmest months of the summer) by river (the Rauvin) to Everlund. Silverymoon is a strong, bustling city, the height of human culture in the Northern interior. To its west lies The Heralds Holdfast, along on a crag. To its south lies Everlund, and beyond it the vast and mysterious High Forest, little visited by men. It is drained to the south by the Unicorn Run. Far to the east of the Run, the Forest ends at the banks of Delimbiyr, the River Shining, which is navigable as far as the fortified town of Loudwater. Long ago, wagons took trade around the Shining Falls and back onto the river, which is navigable from there up to its headwaters. Here of old elves lived in numbers in the eastern High Forest. The remains of an old road and a ruined port, names forgotten with time, mark the site of their now-abandoned land. The elves of Eaerlann (for so the abandoned elven kingdom was known) were few, and embittered by long strife with orcs. When Ascalhorn fell to evil, becoming Hellgate Keep, the elves left, traveling southwest, and vanishedover the sea to Evermeet, the first realm of elves in Faerûn known to have done so. Druids came into the deserted woodlands to preserve the old, lovingly-cared-for trees, the Tall Trees, and remain there yet, defying the strength of Hellgate Keep. Strong garrisons of men and dwarves from Everlund, Silverymoon, Sundabar, and Citadel Adbar now together hold Turnstone Pass, barring the forces of Hellgate Keep from the lands to the west, but there is constant fighting merely to hold the Pass. BERUNS HILL This local landmark is a bare-topped, conical hill that commands a splendid view of the valley of the river Dessarin to the east. 3\n\nThis lookout has often been used in times of trouble to watch for advancing orc tribes coming down from the north and east. It is named for the famous ranger Berun, who met his end here at the hands of such a horde. He failed to stop the orcs, but slew over three hundred singlehanded ere he Fifty years later, an orc horde of awesome size poured down from Dead Orc Pass to the east, and surrounded the Citadel. The orcs attacked heedless of losses, and after four months The Battle of Many Arrows (socalled because of the defenders fired every arrow they possessed down into the massed was overwhelmed. Bandi ts some times watch from the hilltop for the approach of likely victims. Northern legend has it that a dwarven tomb lies under the Hill, rich in golden armor and treasures, but none have ever found it, and no dwarves of today know any more of it than the legend. CITADEL ADBAR This mighty fortress is named for the ancient dwarven King Adbar, who built it over a thousand years ago when the lands about were Delzoun, the Northkingdom of the dwarves. Quarried of granite, the Citadel can house up to 60,000 dwarves in comfort; men will find its defensive tunnels and hallways too dark and too cramped. The Citadel today holds around 14,000; the savage courage of these dwarven warriors, under King Harbromm, protects the mithril mines in the mountains nearby from the endless orcs that threaten to sweep this last hold of the dwarves away. Citadel Adbar still produces the finest metals (sword-blades, forge-bars, and axe-and-pick heads are the most numerous forms in which trade leaves the Citadel) in the North. The dwarves output has dwindled in recent years, however, as the number of miners grow fewer and orc raids upon the trade-caravans (which travel west from Adbar to the city of Sundabar) grow fiercer. The banner of Citadel Adbar bears the ForgeMark of the King in red upon a silver field: an upright single-bladed handaxe enclosed by a circle of flames. CITADEL OF MANY ARROWS, THE This fortified city was once the dwarven hold of Felbarr, part of the realm of Delzoun (q.v.). It stands on a rocky mount in the center of a wide mountain valley, and was once home to 25,000 dwarves. When the dwarves North, Felbarrfar from any stillbegan to withdraw from the productive mineswas the first settlement to be abandoned. Some three hundred winters ago the dwarves left it, and humans from three Silverymoon garrisoned it with over thousand troops. Skirmishes with orc raiders began almost immediately. orcs below, and the orcs ignored their casualties and kept climbing, until the walls were heaped about the dead) ended with the fall of the Citadel and the slaughter of its garrison. The orcs moved in, in strength. Today, some 40,000 orcs are crammed into the fortress-city, and their patrols regularly harry travelers on the road between Silverymoon and Sundabar, and test the very gates of those two cities. The orcs are far too numerous to dislodge, and constantly threaten to overwhelm Sundabar, or Silverymoon, or both. The leader of the orcs of the Citadel is thought to be one Obould, a giant orc of considerable fighting prowess. CITADEL OF THE MISTS, THE This isolated castle lies in the northern fringes of the High Forest. It is the home of the Mistmaster, an illusionist of great power. Some believe him to be of the 26th level of achievement. There he dwells with a small household staff, including the 8th level monk Iltmul (currently the Green Master of Dragons, once the White Master of Dragons) and the pegasi he loves to raise and train. Great treasure is rumored to lie in the Mistmasters vaults, but few have even seen the Citadel, let alone passed within. It does have some sort of magical, monstrous guardians, by all reports, and (when the Mistmaster wishes) is cloaked in thick, swirling mists. DELIMBIYR, THE RIVER SHINING This clear, cool river forms the eastern and southern boundaries of the High Forest, as it runs over a thousand miles from its headwaters in the Nether Mountains to the sea west of Daggerford. The River Shining is fast-flowing, and its waters are mint-sweet and safe to drink. It is home to many szorp, a brown, trout-like fish whose white flesh is tasty and which forms much of the daily diet of the inhabitants of Loudwater. Delimbiyr is navigable from its mouth to Loudwater, and from above The Shining Falls to its headwaters. DELZOUN The Northkingdom of the dwarves, named for its founder, Delzoun is only a shining 4 memory today. Once it stretched from the Ice Mountains in the utter north to the Nether Mountains in the south, bordered on the east by the Narrow Sea (now vanished; the Great Desert lies there today), and on the west by Silvery Moon Pass (just east of present day Silverymoon). The world was two thousand years younger then. Delzoun was a rich and proud land, perhaps the height of dwarven power; its smiths crafted intricate and beautiful mechanisms to ease every task; the great dwarven families grew rich and famous, and gold shown everywhere about the persons and homes of the dwarves of Delzoun. The dwarves ranged across the North building holds for themselves and (for hire) for men, and their work endures still. They were a happy and hearty people. That is all gone now. Today, Citadel Adbar (q.v.) guards the richest mines still known to the Longbeards (dwarven elders), and orcs menace men and dwarves on all sides. A trade-road built by the ancient dwarven king Adbar runs south from the Citadel to the Fork, once the site of the grand mansion of the dwarven hero Ghaurin, but today merely a meeting of roads in the wilderness. One road runs east to ruined Ascore, once a port on the Narrow Sea. It is still rumored to contain treasures and some feel evil that keeps even orcs away from it. The other road runs west to Sundabar (q.v.), now a city of menand that, save for some forgotten dwarven tombs tunnelled into the mountains about, is all that remains of the Northkingdom. King Harbomm probably rules 16,000 dwarves from Citadel Adbar, no more, and the numbers of his people dwindle each year; the births of young dwarves do not keep pace with the battle losses. DESSARIN, RIVER The cold and deep River Dessarin flows into the sea just south of Waterdeep, at Zundbridge. Its waters are home to the silver shalass, fish that are a delicacy across the North. The Dessarin itself rises in the Lost Mountains, two isolated peaks in the High Forest, barely five hundred miles northeast of the City of Splendors, but the Dessarin is fed by many other rivers and streams. The waters of the Surbrin come down from the Endless Ice Sea, north of the Wall (the mountain range that marks the northern edge of habitable land in the North). Two rivers join the Surbrin from the east: the Laughingflow (the original elven name has been forgotten; only its rough\n\ntranslation survives), and the Rauvin, named for a legendary dwarven explorer, which runs east into the heart of the old dwarven kingdom of Delzoun (q.v.). A small boat can take travelers from the sea all the way to icy falls east of Dead Orc Pass if orcattacks and Tymoras blessing allow. This network of rivers is fordable at Ironford and at Dead Horse Ford, east of Yartar. It is bridged at The Stone Bridge, Yartar, Nesmé, Silverymoon, Everlund and Sundabar. Its upper reaches form a vast, open, grassy basin, rising in the east into the moors. These lands are still roamed by trolls today; in the past, the everlasting ones were so numerous that the fires set to burn their corpses raged so often that men thought the land would never be green again. The Evermoors have proven not to be forever barren, however. EAERLANN Even this elven kingdoms name is forgotten to all but a few in the North. Once, it stretched from Turnstone Pass in the north to The Shining Falls in the south, holding the upper valley of the River Shining and The High Forest to a hundred miles west of the Delimbiyr. Its peoples and deeds are lost with time gone over the sea to fabled Evermeet. Today, the remains of an old road and an abandoned, ruined port mark the site of Eaerlanns trade-link to the lands west and south of itonce, wagons took trade around The Shining Falls and back onto the river, and up and down the River Shining Eaerlanns slim barges were seen often. Today, not even treasures remain, or at least none have yet reported finding any. Adventurers, it should be noted, do still go looking, as do forces from Hellgate Keep (q.v.) EVERLUND Lying to the south of Silverymoon and the river Rauvin, the walled city of Everlund is home to many human caravan-masters, adventurers, and tradesmen. A council of six Elders rules here. The population, always changing with the travel trade demands, is usually around 12,000, of all non-evil races. Everlund is an open city, tolerant like Waterdeep, but it must he ever-vigilant against trolls to the west, orcs from the mountains to the northeast, and the fell power of Hellgate Keep to the east. The Council hires adventurers to patrol outside the city, and to bolster its defenses when large-scale attacks are feared. FALLEN KINGDOM, THE This now-vanished realm was a short-lived effort to stem the demi-human decline in the North by uniting elves and dwarves and humans in a common realm. The realm was smashed by the repeated attacks of vast orc hordes, although the slaughter done to the orcs drove them back north for some generations. The Fallen Kingdom had many names; the real one is lost with time, among the names of its various districts (such as Ardeep). The term Fallen Kingdom today refers to the rolling wilderlands due east to the City of Splendors, although this was only the northwest end of the long-ago united realm. FALLEN LANDS, THE This is the present-day name for the strip of habitable land west of Anauroch, stretching between the Far Forests (now overrun by evil things out of Hellgate Keep) and Weathercote Wood. The Fallen Lands are now home only to monsters, it seems, although rumors persist of powerful mages inhabiting the southern end, and hurling back the evil creatures of Hellgate Keep with their art. This was once part of the realm of Netheril, a kingdom of mages who could not stem the expansion of the Great Desert; some sages say that many of them set out south across the Realms to find a new home, and founded the present-day realm of Halruaa. Reports from the adventurers Vanthorm and Haladan indicate that when they visited The Fallen Lands some five winters ago, they observed a beholder of awesome size directing hobgoblin servants to capture monstrous beasts and conduct a strange bestial breeding program. FIRESHEAR An isolated mining city on the frigid northern arm of the Sword Coast, this cold and grim human city is the site of extremely rich veins of copper and silver, exposed in an unusual rift caused by a long-ago volcanic explosion (or perhaps a meteor strike) that blasted out a large bowl-like crater, shearing away tons of rock (hence, Fireshear) to expose the metallic ores for easy discovery and mining. Fireshear is ruled by three Senior Merchants (one of Mirabar, one of Neverwinter, and one of Waterdeep) who ensure that the city falls under the control of no other city of the North. Fireshears 15,000 inhabitants are all miners; all elsegoods, food, and services comes by ship during the summer, when the ice allows. Fireshears arms are a crossed blade, pick, and shovel at the base of an orange, leaping flame on an ice blue field. GAUNTLGRYM Gauntlgrym is a large underground city built by dwarves for men in the early years of the amicable existence of dwarves, elves, and men in the North. It is now abandoned and holds great riches. All who have ever heard the ballads and tales of bards in the North know this; what none have known is the precise location of this potential treasure-trove. The dwarves themselves know only that it lies north of the Dessarin and its tributaries, near the valley of Khedrun. (Khedrun, pronounced Ka-hed-ROON, was a famous dwarven hero who in legend carved out the homeland of the dwarves in the North with his axe from lands dark with wolves, orcs, and bugbears; he really existed, but so long ago that none know what of his story is fancy and what is fact.) A few adventurers returned to Waterdeep in triumph with news of Gauntlgryms discovery a season ago, set out once more to recover its treasures, and have not been heard from since. HELLGATE KEEP In olden days, when the elven kingdom of Eaerlann began to suffer attacks from orcs coming down from the north, and the human realm of Netheril to the east across the mountains was passing away under the onslaught of the Great Desert, the elves built a great fortress in the head-valley of the river Delimbiyr, commanding Turnstone Pass to the northwest and their own northern borders. That citadel, and its task of defending against orcs, the elves turned over to men. Over hundreds of years of success, followed by a generation of peace, when no orcs came, the citys people grew proud and splendid. The fortified city, known as Ascalhorn (it was built on a jutting crag known as Ascals Horn), was thought of, as Silverymoon is today, as another Myth Drannor. The folk of Ascalhorn dabbled in sorcery, planning to recapture Myth Drannors splendor and powerand succeeded only in destroying themselves. One ambitious dabbler opened a gate to the Nine Hells in secret, seeking aid, and received it. The city was slowly infiltrated by devils, at first only as skulking servitors, quiet and quick, but subsequently as schemers and gobetweens, subverting many mages to embrace lichdom and then rising to torture and devour the citizenry with cruel ease. In desperation, many turned to arcane books of 5\n\nlore and summoned demonkind to battle the servants of the Hellsa strategy that worked far too well, as hordes of demons poured into Ascalhorn and overwhelmed humans, devils, and liches alike (a few liches remain as servants, intrepid adventurers report). Ascalhorn became a ghoul-hold, guarded by cambion troops, and ruled by at least one Type VI demon. The citys troops are commanded by a deathknight, who leads or directs many patrols in the lands about. The city, now known as Hellgate Keep, is shunned by men. Human and dwarven forces have several times failed to take the city, but its troops have been likewise rebuffed in attacks on Citadel Adbar, Sundabar, and Silverymoon. Those cities, reinforced by the open city of Everlund, hold Turnstone Pass, albeit shakily, against Hellgate Keeps forces to prevent unchecked and unheralded attacks throughout the North by the Keeps armies. HELMS HOLD Southeast of Neverwinter lies an isolated monastery dedicated to the worship of the god Helm. Founded some eight winters ago by a retired member of the famed Company of Crazed Venturers (of Waterdeep), the monastery was at first a single farm known as Helms Stead. It has grown greatly, and been fortified (hence its new name) against bandit and monster attacks, and now numbers some 700 devout worshipers of Helm. The founder, Dumal Erard, became the White Master of Dragons by defeating Iltmul at The Citadel of Mists (q.v.). Dumal has had to defend his own title many times (see Hlam, in the Selected Non-Player Characters section). HERALDS HOLDFAST, THE West of Silverymoon is the spell-guarded citadel of Old Night, one of the five High Heralds of western Faerûn. The Heralds Holdfast is a precious library of heraldry and genealogy of the known human, elven, dwarven, halfling, and gnomish peoples as far back as records can be traced. It is said to be an invincible fortress, and is respected by both good and evil races of the North even some details of the histories and badges of orcs. hobgoblins, and goblins are said to be preserved within its walls. HIGH FOREST, THE This vast woodland covers much of the eastern central North, stretching for almost five hundred miles from its southern edges (near Secomber) to its northern end (near Turnstone Pass). The High Forest is home to most known races of intelligent woodland creatures. Treants, the wood-rulers, are closest to Everlund, and that part of the High Forest is known as The Woods of Turlang after the treants aeons-old leader, Turlang the Thoughtful. Men know little of the interior of the High Forest, although korred are known to inhabit the headwaters of the Dessarin, and several networks of subterranean caverns underlie the Forests western edge. The Unicorn Run (q.v.) enters the interior of The High Forest from the south. To the east, along the western bank of the upper Delimbiyr, elves of old had a realm, Eaerlann (q.v.), now abandoned. They left when Ascalhorn became Hellgate Keep (q.v.), but druids moved into that region known as the Tall Trees, to preserve and defend the forest, and may be encountered there yet. The Forest is so vast that travelers can, and have, found every sort of woodland creature in its green, shadowed depths. Rumors of lost cities and treasure regularly surface in taverns about the North but the truth is, few dare to investigate. Of the most powerful adventurers who dwell in seclusion in the North most have avoided The High Forest (the Mistmaster and the Nine being the only exceptions, and in both cases they have not settled in the Forests interior). Archmages of power great enough to rival demigods have chosen the orc-infested regions of the far North (The Lonely Tower, on the shore of The Endless Ice Sea, for example, and Tulruns Tent, usually to be found in the eastern Coldwood, near the Ice Mountains) rather than settle in the High Forest. Lesser men have been much slower to cut trees and carve roads into these woods than they have in the Dragonreach lands. There is something about this vast green land that warns civilization away...Tapann, god of the korred, perhaps? Silvanus? Only timeand with it, intrepid explorationstill tell. ICEFLOW, THE This, chilling, fast-rushing river thunders down out of the icy interior of the northern arm of the Sword Coast. It is not navigable by any normal means. Its waters are just above freezing, and travel at terrifying speed down through a great ice gorge. In spring and high summer, great slabs of ice break off the gorge walls and fall into the waters, shattering with the force of a triplestrength ice storm as they spray the vicinity with boulders of broken ice. These chunks of ice are then swept down the gorge and 6 out to sea, to drift south amid the great icebergs from the Sea of Moving Ice. Remorhaz are known to lair in the vicinity, and great horrors known as ice spiders or snow spiders have also been encountered here. Human prospectors who made it back found no rich ores in what they could reach of the walls, but there are persistent rumors of ancient ruins and buried riches in secret places in the gorge. IRONMASTER This isolated, stone-towered city of mountain dwarves is built into the rock walls of a frozen valley; many of its storage chambers and passageways are tunnelled out of never-melting ice, so that the buildings merge directly into the valley-side. Ironmaster is home to around 9,000 hard-working dwarves; no non-dwarven races are welcome in this city. From the deepest tunnelpassages of the city mine-shafts lead down to extensive iron depositsnot rich or rare, but far greater in extent than found elsewhere. The dwarves refine this, and fashion it into pots, pans, and forge-bars (flat bars that a smith elsewhere can readily forge into something). Ironmasters arms are a red anvil on a grey, diamond-shaped field, the long points of the diamond vertical. Its ruler is Lord Clanmaster Strogue Sstar (LG dwarf, 9th level fighter). LEILON This small human mining town sprawls along the High Road, on the Sword Coast. It lacks walls (an earthen bank surmounted by a wooden palisade shields it from the landward side, but where the road pierces these works there are no gates), and also lacks a proper harbor. A dozen massive, battered barges are loaded in the shallows in the spring and summer, and are poled and then rowed out to meet ships and unload by means of rickety cranes that rise from the stems of the barges into their holds. Needless to say, this is a fair-weather operation only, and tricky even then if the wind is fresh and the seas high. Increasingly, Waterdhavian entrepreneurs have sent wagons north to buy the copper, nickel, and silver of Leilon at bargain prices and take it south to sell at Waterdeeps harbor. Leilons mines are guarded by the Lances of Leilon, a force of some two hundred fullyarmed, mounted lancers used to fighting off pirates, orcs, bugbears, and trolls. Each lancer carries an axe and knife, usually a sword of some sort, his lance, and a light\n\ncrossbow which he is experienced in firing from horseback. Leilons total population is some 3,000; its ruler is Pelindar Filmarva, Lord of Leilon. Leilon is a firm ally of Waterdeep, and considered a friend of the Lords who is a 9th level NG; magic-user, and lives in the Ivy Mansion, Harpell House, on the hill in the center of Longsaddle. mereza Sulphontis (q.v., Chapter 2) once put it, and can be found all down the Sword Coast. The citys population is approximately 16,000, exclusively human, and they do not welcome visitors. The only known accommodations for travelers presently in the fortified City of Sails are The Cutlass, a notorious dive on the docks, and the Seven Sails Inn. LOUDWATER Alliance. In the mountains east of Leilons This town of 4,000 lies almost at the midLuskan is ruled by five High Captains, who command a standing army of two hundred spearmen, and at least fourteen warships (each with a crew of seventy archers). In peacetime, these warships operate as mines is at least one important abandoned dwarf-hold, Southkrypt, said to be home to many strange and dangerous creatures. point of the River Shining, and spans the river with a spectacular arching bridge made over a thousand years ago by the dwarf Iirkos Stoneshoulder for the elves who lived there at the time. Few elves are left here today, although almost a quarter of the towns inhabitants are half-elven (the rest are human). Here the river has been cut into a wide pool to skirt around unthrusting rocks and to provide a loading and unloading area for cargo that of old went overland to north of The Shining Falls (and back to the river), and today goes east to Llorkh, for LLORKH Many old nearly-worked-out mines tunnel the mountains to the east and north of this isolated town. Two thousand humans live here, and perhaps three hundred dwarves. Llorkh was once ruled by a succession of human lords, respected retired miners or fighters, but recently the last of these, Phintarn Redblade, was found dead unsanctioned pirates (the High Captains direct them, but pretend they are independents operating in defiance of Luskan law) up and down the Sword Coast, trying to make all shippers use only Luskan ships or only Luskan as a port, by preying on all other ships, and on all shipping that visits Waterdeep (Waterdeeps fighting ships are on constant patrol because of this). Luskans pirates have no connection with the pirates of the Pirate Isles south and west of Amn. Luskan has waged almost constant war against naval powers its Captains feel they can defeat; recently, they crushed Ruathym. In the past, they have raided but been defeated by Mintarn and Orlumbor (supported by Waterdeep and Amn) and slaughtered on the seas by the ships of Lantan, whom they no longer molest or even speak of. The Zhentarim are said to have tried to negotiate an alliance with Luskan several times (it is not known if they have at last succeeded), and adventurers are advised to keep an eye on this perennial trouble spot of the North. at the base of the Lords Keep, and overnight a new Lord seized the Keep and the throne: the mage Geildarr. Since his arrival, Zhentarim caravans have begun to arrive in Llorkh from the east, bringing muchneeded wealth to the town. Dwarves have begun to quietly disappear since Geildarr became Lord, and it is whispered that some have been murdered as Phintarn was, and that Geildarr is a member of the Zhentarim. The caravans spend much gold as they take on men and beast of Llorkh for their last overland trek to Loudwater, where tradebarges will take their wares on to Secomber or the Coast. The Lord has declared one aged dwarf, Thianos Ironskull, a cleric of Moradin (8th level, LG) outlaw, and is said to have men searching for him. The Lord has brought with him almost four hundred purple-cloaked Lords Men: chainarmored men-at-arms, fully armed and experienced in battle, to defend the town and enforce the Lords will. The Lords Men have already fought one major battle with the evil forces of Hellgate Keep, on the banks of the Delimbiyr above The Shining Falls, forcing the Hellgate Keep forces back. assembly into caravans there. Loudwater is a beautiful place, where green, grassy banks line the river, and great trees overhang it; the many wooden buildings of the town are of all shapes and sizes, overgrown by hanging plants and ivy until they seem to blend almost back into the forest itself. Loudwater is defended by patrols of warriors, usually twenty strong, who muster some three hundred in all, under the command of two gauntlets: Harazos Thelbrimm (LN, 5th level fighter) and Kalahar Twohands (CG, half-elven, 6th level fighter), who is under the command of the High Lord of Loudwater (ruler of the town and its claimed lands, which extend for two days ride up and down the river). The present High Lord is Nanathlor Greysword an 11th level NG cavalier of the nobility of Nimbral, which he left in his youth some fifty years ago to found his own land in the savage North; instead, he rose to rule a place that needed him. MERE OF DEAD MEN, THE A vat salt swamp stretches along the Sword Coast shore here for over a hundred miles, reaching a width of over thirty miles at its greatest extent. It is a desolate, insecthaunted place, seldom visited by men, and home to many fell creatures. The Mere of Dead Men was named for the thousands of men slain here when orc hordes that outnumbered them overwhelmed and routed them by striking south from the present-day site of Triboar and east across The Stone Bridge and Ironford. The orcs pursued the men westwards between the coastal peaks, and slaughtered the human army as it was forced back into the icy waves. Travelers on the High Road, which skirts the Mere to the east, have been known to travel for three days and nights without LUSKAN A maritime merchant city, Luskan is fierce, warlike, and proud. An important port (lying at the mouth of the unnavigable river Mirar), Luskan serves as the chief transfer point for the mineral wealth of the mines of Mirabar (q.v.). The Mirar is fast, icy cold, and rocky, but a road parallels it inland to Mirabar, and down this road come many wagons of forge-bars for the markets of all Faerun. The perils of both the High Road (along the coast) and the Long Road (in the interior) south from Mirabar relegate most metal trade to ships out of Luskan. Luskans traders wear furs, haughty expressions, and ready swords, as SamLONGSADDLE This tiny agricultural village (population: 130) is notable as the home of the Harpell family. Many Harpells have been mages of influence in the North (such as the presentday adventurer Malchor Harpell, detailed in Selected Non-player Characters). Longsaddle is the local daily farmers market, and boasts a waystables, an inn, The Gilded Horseshoe, and a stirrup-maker and bell-caster. The village Elder (ruler) is Adanac Harpell, present head of the family. 7\n\nstopping to avoid camping near the Mere. Will-o-(the)-wisps bobbing over the Mere are common sights by night on this stretch of the High Road. Legends speak of floating islands in the midst of the Mere, of lizardmen commanded by liches, and even of a penanggalan of monstrous size that haunts the area, but few are moved to investigate the dark water of the swamp to learn dire truth for themselves. The richest city north of Waterdeep is Mirabar, chief mining center of the North. The Mines of Mirabar provide almost all known metals, in vast quantities, and are guarded from orcs and the monsters of the peaks by a standing army of almost a thousand men who ride mountain ponies in summer and trained rothe in winter. The rich, cold grey stone city is surrounded by mines. The worked-out mines to the west and south of the city, across the Mirar, are now used to quarry building stone and rubble to shore up the evercrumbling gravel roads that carry Mirabars metal wealth south and west to the rest of Faerun. Mirabars Councillors meet each fall in the Hall of Sparkling Stones to determine where and when to sell their metal, mindful of who will use it to forge weapons to make war on whom. Over the Council rules Elastul Raurym, MIRABAR (MEER-ah-barr) Marchion of Mirabar. His bodyguards all sport armor plated with platinum, number sixty-four, and are commanded by four hammers (6th level fighters), Djassar, Hulmm, Kriiador, and Turvon. The city is noted for its ever-hot forges and fine gems, and is crowded with grim men (some 19,000) and even grimmer dwarves (4,000 strong). The Royal Badge of Mirabar is an upright double-bladed axe with a pointed haft and a flaring, flat base, of rust red hue. It is usually displayed on a black field, but sometimes on a purple field, and (on ship pennants) on white. Mirabars merchants own many ships based in Luskan. NESMÉ (NEEZ-may) This trading-town is the only settlement in the Evermoors. A circular, fortified settlement of some six thousand residents, Nesmé is ruled by the priests and priestesses of Waukeen, and welcomes all who come to carry on honest trade. On its west, Nesmé has a fortified bridge over the river Surbrin, and fortified stables, paddocks, and stock-pens; to the east, beyond the walls, lie forty or so farms under the protection of the Riders of Nesmé. In the center of the city rises the spired temple of Waukeen; the First Speaker of the city council is the High Priestess Jygil Zelnathra (N, 10th level), and the lesser clergy of the temple 8 hold the majority of the voting-stones of the Council. They are usually opposed on Council by Tessarin Longtresses Alaraun, a wizardess (NG, 13th level magic user) who believes priests have no business running any government, particularly not that of the place that was her home first. Jygil needs Tessarins support in times of attack; the storms she summons have often proved crucial to the disruption of attacking orc hordes, and the two women have a grudging respect for each other, so they maintain an armed truce in Council. The Riders of Nesmé, based in the stables on the west bank of the Surbrin, are 400 strong. Besides patrolling the Evermoors for two days ride on either bank around Nesmé, they defend the city when the orcs come (at least once every ten years; usually more often). They also police the population of Nesmé, which has a higher turnover than most settlements due to the total dominance of trade (which in the North always involves travel). NETHERIL This long-ago realm lay to the east of the river Delimbiyr, stretching from the Nether Mountains (which gained their name from this realm) to Evereska in the south, and east to the Narrow Sea, whose shores once ran southeast from Ascore (see Delzoun,\n\nabove) for hundreds of miles ere the Great Desert swallowed it. Netheril was a realm of mages, and many items of wondrous magic were crafted here, still to be found in treasure hordes and tombs across the Realms. Dekanter is the only known surviving ruin of Netheril, although it holds no magic any longer. Legend holds that the mages of Netheril tried by titanic efforts of art to stem the advancing desert, and failing whereupon they took to the air on carpets and other magical conveyances, and on bestial steeds of many rare and wondrous forms, and searched for a new home. Most sages believe that Netherils culture was at its height some four thousand years ago, and that it was the earliest human civilization in the North. It was abandoned approximately three thousand years ago. Others hold that those dates are far too old; Netherils fall cannot be more than a thousand years ago, at the most. Hard evidence, thus far, does not exist to support or deny any conjecture on the issue. It is known that adventuring band after bandit band after mercenary company searches The Fallen Lands and the Deserts Edge in hopes of gaining some of Netherils lost magic. Few admit any success. NEVERWINTER (see also entry in THE FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Set) This friendly city of craftsmen bustles with business, but does it quietly; it avoids controversy and warfare, keeping within its walls and dealing with the outside world largely through merchants of Waterdeep. On the rare occasions when armed men (from Luskan) or orcs (not so rare) have shown up outside the city walls, explosive missiles lobbed among them in such numbers that it seemed a hailstorm, as one observer put it, have sent them away again, in much reduced numbers. Catapults and missiles alike were devised by the hard-working craftsmen of the city. The city also has more conventional forces; an army of 400 archers and spearmen who guard the city walls and harbor, and patrol the High Road as far as Port Llast (q.v.) to the north, and a hundred miles south towards Leilon on the other. In peacetime, sixty of these are always retraining, sixty are on leave, for rest and relaxation, and sixty are serving as the citys Watch (police). Like all else in The City of Skilled Hands, they are efficient, quiet, and make sure their work gets done properly. The city is ruled by Lord Nasher (NG, ST 18/ 09, CHA 17, 12th level fighter), a former adventurer who gained much magic in his career, and now employs it to defend himself and his bodyguard, the Neverwinter Nine. Nasher is an amiable but fearless balding man who enjoys music and hearing of other lands and peoples. He rules some 17,000 subjects. The water-clocks and multi-hued lamps of the city are known and sought throughout the Realms, as is the reputation of the citys gardeners, who in summer fill the city with fruitbearing trees and hanging plants, and contrive to keep flowers blooming throughout the severe winter. Most say the city got its name from this feat; others hold that it is due to the Neverwinter river that flows through the city from the deep woods to the east; its waters are so warm that Neverwinters harbor never freezes. The Neverwinter woods have never been logged by men, and even today are largely unknown. The depths are said to harbor fearsome creatures, and locally are shunned and feared. Orc hordes always go around the woods, never through them. To the southeast of Neverwinter lies Helms Hold (q.v.); on the eastern edge of the Neverwinter woods rises The Tower of Twilight (q.v.). The Royal Badge of Neverwinter consists of a white swirl connecting three white snowflakes. Silver and blue haloes encircle the flakes. PORT LlAST On the High Road some thirty-five miles north of Neverwinter stands Port Llast, a small town (of 700 inhabitants) now known mainly for its skilled stonecutters. Port Llast is ruled by a First Captain, and is closely allied to Neverwinter (largely to avoid being conquered by Luskan, who would like to have a more southerly harbor for its warships). The current First Captain is Haeromos Dothwintyl, a retired stonemason (LN, 0 level fighter ST 17, WIS 17). Port Llast was once of great importance to men. When orc tribes and hostile duergar held the lands where Luskan now stands, it was the last port (hence its name), the northernmost human access to the mineral riches of the North. Then, it was twenty times as populous as it is today, and much larger; much of the City walls were battered down by orcs, or plundered since for use in repairing local homes, but the shattered remnants can still be seen circling around the town to the east, in lands now used as gardens and burial grounds or let to go back to forest. SILVERYMOON The largest city of the North (that is, north of Waterdeep), Silverymoon is home to 26,000 men, elves, half-elves, dwarves, gnomes, and halflings. All live in harmony under the wise rule of Alustriel, High Lady of Silverymoon (CG, IN 18, WIS 17, DEX 16, CHA 17, 22nd level magic user). Alustriel uses her magic sparingly but her natural kindness and graceand acquired shrewd diplomacy often, to keep the demi-humans and humans of the North largely at peace with each other. Some say Silverymoons values and preservation of music, learning, and the arts echo lost Myth Drannorthe fabled lost city where elves, dwarves and men worked together to bring knowledgeparticularly magical knowledgeand the arts to a pinnacle never elsewhere achieved, before or since. Certainly its armies of men and halfelves persist in behaving as though no orc threat existed in their gallantry and enthusiasm, and have won several impossible battles due to their boldness, persistence, and the timely magical aid of the Mistmaster and the one known only as Shadowcloak. They are known as The Knights In Silver, for their appearance in a battle as described by the bard Mintiper Moonsilver in a ballad. Silverymoon lies on the northern bank of the river Rauvin, its walls curving in a halfcircle from the rivers waters. It has extensive docks and an arching magical moon-bridge of invisible force fields across the Rauvin. The bridge is visible only in moonlight, and its central arch can be reduced to nothingness by magical means, spilling attackers into the river, or allowing tall-masted ships to pass. Silverymoons Royal Badge is a thin crescent moon curving to the right, a single star sheltering under its uppermost horn. The moon and star are both of silver, and the whole is displayed on a royal blue field (or graven on grey stone to mark the boundaries of Silverymoons claimed lands). Alustriels palace is just within the eastern arc of the city walls, east of the vast open market, and is heavily guarded by magic-users of all ranks loyal to her, and warriors of skill. There are major temples to Helm, Lathander, Milil, Oghma, and Selune in Silverymoon. This massive stone arch spans the River Dessarin without ceremony or accompanying settlement, rising lonely and weathered in the midst of rolling grasslands without a road or building to be seen as far as the eye can scan. STONE BRIDGE, THE 9\n\nBuilt by dwarves five thousand years ago to link the now-ruined Halls of the Hunting Axe (a ruined dwarven city thirty miles south and east of the bridge; its tumbled stones can still be seen today, although those wishing to visit are warned that despite much butchery, leucrotta repeatedly lair in the place) with nowforgotten dwarven holds somewhere to the northwest. The Bridge was built to span the broadest imaginable spring flood of the Dessaring and it rises in a great arc, without supporting pillars, some two miles in length, reaching a height of four hundred feet above the waters of the Dessarin (at normal flow). The dwarves explain the awesome size of the bridgeand its continued survival, despite armies clashing on it and mages hurling mighty spells to and from it, over the years to the fact that it was built in homage to Moradin the Soulforger, and is in fact a temple to him. It is true that some lawful good dwarves do make pilgrimages there, and that at least once in times of darkness for the dwarves Moradin appeared on the bridge. STRONGHOLD OF THE NINE, THE This cavern complex is a former dwarfhold rebuilt by the Nine. This famous adventuring band, led by the archmage Laeral, is largely retired today; they make their home in the seclusion of the High Forest, as far up the Unicorn Run as men dare go. The Stronghold is known to have strange and powerful magical guardians (including nagas and golems). The Nine are known to have gained much treasure over the years, however, and much of it is undoubtedly in the Stronghold (if any are foolhardy or desperate enough to face nine veteran adventurers, the least of which is 14th level, on their home ground!). SUNDABAR This fortified city, once home to dwarves, now houses men. Extensively rebuilt by men friendly to dwarves, it now trades with Citadel Adbar and Silverymoon, and can field an army of 2000 to turn back orc hordes. Its coffers were rich enough to hire the Flaming Fist mercenary company (see THE FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Set) once, to swing through Dead Orc Pass and fall upon an orc horde from behind. Great was the slaughter that day, and great the victory of men and dwarves. Sundabars population averages 36,000, and it is ruled by Helm Dwarf-friend, Master of Sundabar (NG 14th level fighter). Sundabar is known for its woodworkers, who produce carved furniture, musical instruments, and travel-chests of unusual beauty and durability. TOWER OF TWILIGHT, THE On the eastern edge of the Neverwinter Woods, a days ride west of Longsaddle, stands The Tower of Twilight. This lone tower rises from an island in a small lake that drains into the woods to the west, and is the abode of Malchor Harpell (see Selected Non-Player Characters) and his apprentices and companions (Aflame and Nanitha, also detailed in Chapter 7). Its defenses are unknown. Aerial steeds are known to be able to land in or on the Tower itself. TRIBOAR (TRY-bore) This small walled town is strategically located where the Long Road and the major trail to the east (sometimes called the Evermoor Way, although a commonly-used name for the route has never really been settled upon). Its people number approximately 2,500, and elect a Lord Protector every seven years to lead the town militia. An able human fighter, Faurael Blackhammer (NG, ST 17, IN 16, 6th level fighter), has held this post for the last thirty years. Triboar has two good smithies and a wagonmaker of note. Several ranches in the lands to the west bring their horses here to sell to travelers. Gathered armies have often set forth from Triboar to meet orc hordes pouring south out of the mountains. Triboars name is thought to have come from a travelerss tale of slaying three boars in a day, here, long ago. UNICORN RUN, THE This cool, gently-flowing river rises in the mountains at the very heart of The High Forest (thought by some to be home to many nymphs), where few civilized beings have ever been, all down the ages, save elves who do not talk. The Stronghold of the Nine (see above) lies partway up the Run, and unicorns inhabit the woods near its banks in the vicinity, and are known to travel up and down the river (hence its name). There is a legend that an elven king buried the treasure of all his court somewhere along the Run, when fleeing from orcs and hobgoblins who had pursued his people from the the far North, and never returnedslain shortly thereafter by the orcs. Another legend holds that the god Mielikki inhabits the Forest near the Run and is often seen wandering in the woods near it. Harpers say that this legend is plain truth, and make occasional pilgrimages to certain groves there. Certainly the Runs vale within The High Forest is one of the most beautiful regions of all Faerûn. Bards who have come here tend to sing of it for the rest of their lives. The Nines adventures have become far fewer since they settled on the Run, and halflings from Secomber regularly travel upriver to just within the Forests edge to bury their dead. One famous halfling adventurer, Gaultham Longtoes, is known to have said, after visiting the Run, I have seen the unicorns, and can die content. WEATHERCOTE WOOD This isolated wood is avoided by all save the bravest (or most foolish) adventurers; it has existed since before the fall of Netheril, persist despite Anaurochs advance, and seems to be a place of fell magic. Blue mists and glowing lights are often seen in its interior by Zhentarim caravans passing in the night, to and from Llorkh (q.v.) to the west. The elves say that gates to other worlds lie in the depths of Weathercote, and that mages of awesome power from other worlds have come to Faerûn to dwell in the Woods and guard the gates to prevent others of their kind from using them. The truth of this is not known neither spells nor psionics seem able to penetrate the Woods interior, and those who go in to see do not come out again. YARTAR (YAR-tarr) This fortifed town is the site of a bridge over the Surbrin, just north of its confluence with the Dessarin. Yartar is home to some 6,000 men, and is the site of a major temple to Tymora. Many barges are built here, for use up and down the river, and the folk of Yartar traditionally fish the Three Rivers (the Dessarin, Surbrin, and Laughing-flow) near their docks for much of their table fare. Yartar is the scene of the vast Shieldmeet of the outcasts, bandits, homeless, and isolated landholders of the North, who gather here in the thousands. Yartars ruler, the Waterbaron, is presently Alahar Khaumfros (LN, ST 16, 4th level fighter). He commands an Official barge that can carry two hundred men, and a mounted army, The Shields of Yartar to fill it if need be. More often, they police the town and defend it against wandering orcs and trolls. 10\n\nChapter 2: AN INTRODUCTION TO THE CITY OF WATERDEEP A BRIEF GEOGRAPHY OF WATERDEEP The City of Splendors lies on the western coast of Faerûn, north of Amn. That region is known as the Sword Coast, because for many years it was ruled by the might of swordarms rather than by any laws or treaties (and some folk in the South still hold it to be so). Waterdeeps boundaries are strictly controlled by the mysterious rulers of the City, the Lords of Waterdeep. Waterdeep is guarded by a wall from its southern tip to the northern end of the City of the Dead, where there is a sheer cliff of over a hundred feet in height, by the Trollwall (so named because of its earliest form it was intended primarily to hold off trolls), which rises up again after the cliff lessens to a height that attackers could scale, and extends as far as the Trolltower, or Northtower, before doubling back south to meet the sea. This wall is pierced by four gates: the South Gate; the River Gate; Northgate; and Westgate. Within the walls, the city of Waterdeep sprawls to the shore, except where restrained by edict of the Lords, who forbid any habitation of encroachment into the City of the Dead, the public streets, and the slopes of Mount Waterdeep around Castle Waterdeep. The Watch (City police) divide the City into seven districts, or wards. These are Castle Ward, the City of the Dead, Sea Ward, North Ward, The Trades Ward, Dock Ward, and Southern Ward. Divisions between these districts are not obvious to a visitor to the City. Industry and other activities are not restricted to this or that ward (the exception being the City of the Dead). The complex ward boundaries are shown on a map included in this book. l Castle Ward contains Mount Waterdeep, the Castle itself, Piergeirons Palace, and many of the barracks and other public buildings around them. Generally only the wealthy live here, and then only if they are involved in the daily intrigue and night life open social cut-and-thrust of City life. l Sea Ward lies to the north and west of Castle Ward, all along the seacoast. It contains most of the large temple complexes found in the City of Splendors, and many large private villas of the noble families and the very rich non-nobles. If one is not noble, and not a swinger or diplomat, but becomes very wealthy, the Sea Ward is the place to live. l North Ward takes in the eastern portion of the northern end of the sprawling City, as far south as The City of the Dead. It contains many noble villas and grand houses, but the presence of many inns and rooming-houses make it slightly less haughty in overall character than Sea Ward. North Ward inhabitants are generally thought of as very respectable and prosperous. l The City of the Dead is a walled cemetery, strictly patrolled by the Watch. So one may live or even sleep overnight therein. It is kept in a beautiful, park-like open condition, and is used as a launching and meeting place by natives of Waterdeep at all hours. l The Trades Ward lies generally to the south of Castle Ward and The City of the Dead, and is an arbitrary slice of the bustling commercial area of the City, where most moderately wealthy merchants live, and much of the Citys light-goods and respectable trade takes place. l Southern Ward, as its name implies, is the southern end of Waterdeep, and dominated by the caravan trade, with its necessary stables and warehouses. Many poor but honest Waterdhavians live here. l The Dock Ward takes in the entire dock area from the Mountain to the southern end of the City, and is the most crowded, dirty, and rough district of the City. The vital commerce (and shady dealings) of Waterdeep keep its streets busy at all hours. Any aerial visitor to the City of Splendors arriving from the south can clearly see the general topography of Waterdeep; the City resembles a flat board raised at its north end, and slightly tilted downwards on the west so that it slopes down towards the Mountain, leveling off along The Way of the Dragon. Mount Waterdeep is of course the highest point in Waterdeep; its seaswept flanks rise to shield much of the City beyond from the worst coastal storm winds, peaking some seven hundred feet above the waves. An eyrie for aerial traffic, garrisoned by the City Guard (the difference between Guard and Watch is explained later in this chapter), shelters below the peak on the landward side. From it, the Citys defensive naval combat throwers are commanded, and patrol squadrons of griffonriders fly. As a port, Waterdeep provides an excellent natural deep-water harbor (hence its name) and shipbuilding facilities; over four hundred vessels can dock at once. Waterdeep maintains a small navy of sixteen fast 11 rakers: slim top-armored vessels that can carry up to seventy troops each, and that are armed with fire-pot catapults and large deck-mounted crossbows. These ships have armored bow rams, banks of oars (and a normal crew of thirtysix to man them), and two masts for crowding sails on in pursuit or when speed is essential. The navys base is fortified Deepwatch Isle, which protects the harbor mouth from weather and from seaborne attackers, and is garrisoned by almost a thousand guardsmen at all times. At least two naval rakers are always on patrol outside the harbor, and another two are on ready duty within the harbor. At least four others will be on extended patrol somewhere off the Sword Coast on any day in peacetime. These warships are supported by over twenty small lateen-sailed galleys, or strikers, and fifteen large, wallowing troop-and-supply vessels. (For AD&D® game statistics of these vessels, refer to the Waterdhavian Ship Table listed under The Order of Master Shipwrights in Chapter 5.) Most merchant ships of the Realms can average fifty miles or so per day, in moderately favorable conditions. Sailing in the Sword Coast region is dangerous to impossible (as one goes northwards and icebergs become more common) during the harsh storms of winter. Storms are almost continuous in the month of Hammer, and frequent in the two months that follow, becoming increasingly fierce but shorter, and with longer intervals between. Thereafter, in the fourth month, they are replaced by cold, heavy rains that rarely involve lightning or high winds, and are fairly safe (if uncomfortable) for sailing. The City of Waterdeep is built upon the rock and rubble of the slopes of Mount Waterdeep, built up and quarried flat over generations of habitation. At least three major networks of underground passages are known to exist beneath Waterdeeps busy streets. Undermountain, a deep, many-leveled former dwarven city and implies, lies largely beneath Mount Waterdeep, is the largest and most famous (in tavern-talk) of these. The Dungeon of the Crypt, so named because its above-ground entrance is one of the crypts in The City of the Dead, lies under the North Ward, and is less spoken of. The third of these labyrinths is the city sewers, detailed in this book. The major mine of great antiquity that, as its name\n\nchannels of the sewers are navigable, and the secondary channels may be crawled or swum by man-sized beings of bravery (or stupidity), daring, and agility, although the curious are warned that the sewers have gratings at awkward places to prevent their use as a subterranean highway and to hamper the movements of less desirable visitors from the sea depths. Fresh, clean water (for drinking and cooking) in Waterdeep comes from deep wells under Castle Waterdeep and under Farwatch Tower, and from shallow wells. These wells are attended at all times by members of the Watch. To deliberately poison or attempt to block access to or fill in one of these wells is an offense punishable by immediate (i.e. as soon as the offender is within blades reach) death. Spillwater, the not-quite-so-clean water used for bathing and washing of animals, buildings, and equipment, and for the watering of plants, is gained from cisterns on the roofs and in the cellars of most buildings in Waterdeep; cellar cisterns are fed by sloping catchbasins on roofs, and have gratings to filter solid debris that finds its way onto the roof out of the collected water as it flows down wall pipes into the cellar; smaller roofcisterns are merely open-topped basins, and are cleaned often by users below to avoid contact with dead pigeons and the like. Used spillwater is referred to as nightwater, and is used to sluice chamber pots into the sewers. Waterdeeps population rarely falls below 122,000 beings. The actual number varies greatly with the seasons, as so much of it consists of those visiting in the course of conducting trade. In times of busiest trade, the City often holds five times as many. Such busy times (apart from special occasions caused by wars, bountiful harvests, Shieldmeetdescribed in the Campaign Setand the like) occur fairly regularly at full spring, when winter is fully gone without threat to the reasonable-minded of its return and the transportation routes over land and sea are fully open, and after the fall harvest in the North (before the threat of winters mud can become a reality, closing the roads, and the granaries and warehouses are bursting with food destined for the South). A BRIEF HISTORY OF WATERDEEP To most inhabitants of the Realms, Waterdeep the Mighty, the City of Splendors, Crown of the North, is a place that has always been there. It is a vast and colorful, tolerant and eclectic crossroads city where peoples of all hospitable races meet, and the most wondrous and exciting works and achievements are seen. Waterdeep is seen as the cradle of, and foremost in, invention and innovation in the creative endeavors of all cities in the Sword Coast lands and perhaps in all Faerûn. Inhabitants of other cities in Amn and Calismshan on the Coast, and of Cormyr, Sembia, Thay, and other realms inland, may dispute thisbut they are disputing a known (if unadmitted) supremacy. The creative endeavors Waterdeeps merchants and nobles deal in include magic, art, music, and craftwork: that is, the carving and combining of wood, metal, glass, and other materials into tools and useful items of ever-increasing beauty, precision, and efficiency. Few now known the true history of this great city, which had its beginnings over a thousand years ago, when the North was truly what Southerners still call it sneeringly: the savage North. In those days, most of the North was covered with vast, tall forests of ancient green, and inhabited by dwarves and goblinkind (in the most northern mountains and foothills) and elves (in widelyscattered forest enclaves everywhere else). A few primitive human tribes lived along the Sword Coast, fishing and hunting and gathering in spring and fall to trade their furs for the merchants jewelry and metal tools, or the occasionally-available weapon or two, with vessels sailing in from the South. In the spring, these vessels came primarily to cut and take huge trees for shipbuilding, trees being no longer available in such large sizes farther south. In the fall, the vessels came in to cut timber for their own repairs, or to take on a cargo of wood if the misfortunes of trading had left their holds low or empty, for want of anything better. Most of these trademoots were at a certain place where there was a great natural deepwater harbor, protected from the sea by a rocky spur of land, an arm of an isolated coastal crag, and a rocky island beyond it. Over the years, the forest was cut back farther and farther from the shore, and 12 some tribes began to stay most of the year there, farming the cleared land (and, the wiser among them reasoned, controlling some of the timber, which they could claim as theirs and trade for more weaponry and tools). Such claims and raids from tribes finding the squatters rich with tools and weaponry gained from frequent trade brought attacks from land and sea, and the squatting tribes were slaughtered by the more warlike tribes. Notable among these tribes was that led by Nimoar, a chieftain who directed his people to seize the farms, and the ramshackle wooden docks, tradingsheds, and storage barns that had come into being by the deepwater harbor over the years, settle there themselves, and erect a log palisade within an earthen embankment, to protect the holdings. Nimoars people did so, withstood several pirate and tribal raids, and prospered. Farther north, orc tribes had outgrown their mountain strongholds. Attempts to expand underground met with fierce dwarven resistance (although many small gnomish colonies were overwhelmed and wiped out), and the orcs spread out on the surface of the land, coming south and down out of the mountains, hurling their seemingly endless numbers against all who stood in their path. Here and there elven enclaves held out, but the push southwards displaced many other northern inhabitants, including the everlasting ones (trolls), who came down into the newly-cleared lands northeast of Nimoars Hold, those lands now known as the Troll-moors. Nimoar died of old age during this time of increasing danger. Younger War Lords led the men of Waterdeep (for so the shipcaptains called the harbor) in battles against the trolls. There were many bloody struggles between men and trolls for a decade, until the magic of a Northern youth named Ahghairon turned the fortunes of war against the trolls, and the everlasting ones were destroyed or scattered. Fearing further attacks, the men of Waterdeep raised a small keep on the slopes of Mount Waterdeep above their farms, where fire arrows from on high could defend against attacking trolls. Many men of outlying tribes who had come to the settlement for safety from the trolls stayed, and expanded the walls with new farms several times. War Lords ruled the Free City of Waterdeep, holding it independent and increasingly wealthy as years passed. Ahghairon rose slowly in skill and power\n\nwith the passage of years, until he became a great mage. He discovered a supply of potions of longevity (or learned the art of making such), for he lived on, still physically a man in his prime, for decade upon decade. In his 112th winter, Ahghairon had a sharp disagreement with Raurlor, who was then Warlord of Waterdeep. Raurlor wanted to use Waterdeeps acquired wealth and strength-of-arms to create an empire in the North, with Waterdeep its capital (and Raurlor its ruler), and gathered armies for the purpose. Ahghairon defied him before all the people, and Raurlor ordered that the mage be chained. Ahghairon struck aside with magic all who sought to lay hands on him, until in a fury Raurlor drew his own blade and struck at the mage. Ahghairon rose into the air, just out of reach, and as the infuriated Warlord slashed repeatedly at his rising feet, gestured. Raurlors blade was transformed in his hand, from steel into a hissing serpent. The Warlord was bitten, and died of the venom before the shocked people assembled there. Ahghairon then gathered all the captains of Waterdeeps army, and all the seniors of the families of Waterdeep. While runners were sent to gather them to the Palace, flames roared and crackled in the Warlords empty chairof-state at Ahghairons bidding, so that noone sat there. Then at a gesture from the mage, the flames were gone as though they had never been, leaving the chair unmarked. Ahghairon seated himself, then, and proclaimed himself the first Lord of Waterdeep, saying that henceforth wisdom and not armed might would rule in the city. He would gather some fewin secretto rule as Lords with him, masked and disguised when they appeared to the people, but equal to him in authority and free of coercion by any, himself included. These Lords could serve as long as they wished, and were to be drawn from all walks of life in the city. The people heard, and agreed, and for the next two hundred years, Ahghairon ruled Waterdeep with his unknown fellow Lords. Over the years, the masked Lords were a group of sometimes six, sometimes seven, betimes five, who appeared seldom and said little. Some whispered that they were Ahghairons servants, or even automatons magically controlled by the Old Mage, but Ahghairons justice was swift and fair, his laws good, his guardsmen polite and ready to help as well as apprehend, and the people of Waterdeep approved. The years passed in peace and prosperity. The North was opened to humans. Roads built under Ahghairons direction linked it together, from the ruins of the Fallen Kingdom (see Chapter 1), which had been shattered by goblin races attacks before men were numerous in the North, to the cities that would later become Amn. Waterdeep grew fivefold in size and wealth. From all over the Realms folk began to come to the Crown of the North, drawn by money and among them came those who rob and cheat and steal. When word of the doings of such extending beyond simple theft to deception-in-workmanship and the appearance of many fly-by-night impostorcraftsmen reached Ahghairons ears, he called together the senior merchants, the Noble Ones, and suggested that they form guilds as was done in the far South, and police the unscrupulous of their own professions. Some resisted, or were furious, but most saw the advantages of such an arrangement, particularly if they were free to set matters up themselves, and not have less favorable arrangements forced upon them. The Guilds were created forthwith. Waterdeep continued to grow in size and prosperity. Twice more the city walls were expanded, and its merchants traveled the world over, bringing back exotic goods from afar, and spreading word of the citys wealth to remote lands. In the South some listened with an eye to conquest or at least plunder, but swords were already out in those southern lands in a time of widespread strife, and no invaders came. At length Ahghairons health failed. He died, and was buried with ceremony in his tower, which was sealed up against thieves and fools. Those who had learned the arts of magic from the Old Mage came to salute him, and to cast the most potent protective magics they knew upon his resting-place (which, it is believed, remains inviolate today). There was great turmoil in the City as the Guildmasters argued amongst themselves as to who should govern the City, and more than one merchant of power was found murdered. Groups of liveried bodyguards appeared openly armed on the streets, accompanying their masters, and two very troubled months passed as they bickered and parleyed (and occasionally duelled in the streets). At last the Guildmaster decided that all Masters should rule Waterdeep together, in a council. The lesser nobles and many townsfolk protested, saying that the 13 Lords by right ruled, but the Guildmasters said that the Lords had not been seen since Ahghairons death, and that they must always have been golems or zombies controlled by Ahghairon himself, to conceal his lone rule. And indeed, the Lords were silent and unseen, and continued to be so. In truth, the Lords were real men and women, whose identities had been learned, over the years, by certain professionally curious Guildmasters, who had ordered them slain by their own closemouthed, loyal servants following Ahghairons death. The only Lords still surviving (those whose names and faces had remained secret) were Baeron, a woodworker, and Shilarn, an apprentice magic-user. These surviving Lords kept very quiet, and waited. The Guildmasters thought that all the living Lords of the City had been eliminated, and took firm rule over Waterdeep. The Guildmasters ruled Waterdeep for only six years ere their self-interested squabbling led to bloodshed. A few armed quarrels and murders quickly erupted into a brief but vicious series of street fights and midnight attacks. This strife, sometimes termed the Guildwars by sages (although it was never as long-drawn-out or so formal as to be called a war when it was taking place), left all but two Guildmasters dead, most of the Citys best minds stilled, and much of the Citys gold wasted or plundered with the Guilds in disarray. The surviving Guildmasters were Lhorar Gildeggh of the Shipwrights, and Ehlemm Zoar of the Gemcutters. These two, ruthless manipulators both, were well-matched and could not overcome each other, though their private armies clashed often in the streets. At length they sickened of bloodshed, after many of both their families had been found lifeless in the gutters, and agreed to rule together. Two thrones were set up in Castle Waterdeep, and from then the two argued bitterly over this and that, and the City was a place of tension and fear. All matters, including the recognition of new Guildmasters to the government of the headless guilds, had to come before the Two Lords Magister, as Lhorar and Ehlemm were called. Few matters were settled. One day to the Courts of the Lord Magister came two people masked and robed as the Lords of Waterdeep had been of old. Where these two came from no one knew, but they appeared in the Castles Great Hall where the Courts were, and commanded the Lords Magister to leave the City forth-\n\nwith. Laughing, the Lords Magister refused, whereupon the shorter of the two masked intruders (the lady Shilarn, once apprentice to Ahghairon, and his undeclared heir as first Lord of the City) blasted them with fire and lightning, and their very thrones were shattered and tumbled. The taller of the two intruders (Baeron) then called for the heads of the noble houses to come to them, or leave the City forthwith and forever, if they cared not to come by nightfall. All in the Courts heard, and the news was cried in the streets. The surviving nobles came, reluctantly and with bodyguards, expecting such a summons to be a trap. Baeron spoke to them and the crowd of curious townsfolk that had also come, saying, this must not happen again. If Waterdeep was to be safe once more, he told them, all must support what he and his fellow Lord now planned, as they had supported Ahghairon in the past. The two would choose others to be Lords as before, he said, and they would rule in secret, as beforesave for himself. He removed his mask, and said, I am Baeron. I would be Lord as Ahghairon was before. I would be safe in this my city again. And the folk of Waterdeep there agreed. Shilarn, still masked, commanded that the houses of the Two Lords Magister be Outcast. There was protest, and she raised her hands that had blasted the thrones, and it was still again. And the house of Gildeggh and of Zoar were outcast. Peace returned to the City, and Waterdhavians to their labors. To inhibit discovery of who the Lords were, Baeron selected certain men of character whom he knew well, and appointed them Magisters (Black Robes, they were soon called, from their robes of office) under the Lords, to judge and apply the laws of Waterdeep in daily affairs. These Magisters he paid well, to raise them from temptation, and gave lodgings to those who feared for safety to dwell among the people. To so serve, he told the City, was a burden, not a proud misuse of authority, and if any wished to no longer serve, or were found wanting, they were not to be vilified, but accorded respect. And over the Magisters the Lords sat in their Court, to correct and overrule the judgments of the Magisters. Baeron told the people that none were to decry or belittle any judgments of Magisters that the Lord saw fit to alter or cast aside. If any thought ill of the offices or those who held them they could turn back to the rule of sword and whim, and perish as had those before them. Before the Lords Court Baeron encouraged people to speak freely for the length of a short candles burning, without fear of chastisement or reproach from the Lords for anything said, as long as they spoke openly and answered questions or opposing views put to them by any there. Thus, he held, just grievances of folk would be heard, no matter how small the matter or lowly the speaker. And so it was. Slow to take hold, until people knew it for careful justice, but enduring beyond Baerons time, and beyond Shilarns time, and beyond the time of their daughter Lhestyn The Masked Lady, who wed Zelphar Arunsun of Neverwinter, and was mother to Khelben Blackstaff Arunsun, a Lord of Waterdeep today, who knows the secrets of long years as Ahghairon did. And as the years have passed, Waterdeep has grown in size and variety, flourishing with good trade under the tolerance and protection of strong defenders and good government; there is no city of the Realms able to rival Waterdeep the Mighty in all these things today. AND NOW THE NEWS... News spreads rapidly in Waterdeep. The diplomats and those who ship goods by land or sea to or from the Realms afar have a professional interest in learning of current events (and rumors) speedily, and many others take a natural interest in such information. Waterdeeps crossroads nature makes it a very good place to hear of thingsand falsehoods are more likely to be revealed in the City of Splendors than it other cities of the Realms, because such a large number of widely-traveled beings of experience and knowledge are gathered there. If PCs go seeking information, a DM should exploit the role-playing possibilities, following the general guideline that only technical information or Guild secrets are for sale (and rarely, state secrets; these are almost always details of the doings, intentions, and military strength of other realms and citystates, not Waterdeep itself). All else is given in return for only a drink or a trade of information. Contacts or sources are never revealed except to fellow adventurers or Guild members. If the PCs attempt to spread news or rumors, a DM must judge their effectiveness according to their methods and current events in the City. Generally, seven days is the longest news will take to spread throughout the City. News of Palace doings or public disputes in main streets is usually everywhere by the evening of the day after the events occurred. Below follow a few items of current news in the City (a DM should develop his or her own constant stream of similar rumors and facts; if kept fairly constant, they seem real and not a deliberate, hey, heres an adventure! ploy, although any may be so developed by interested DMs). In addition, the news of the Realms found in the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Set may be used. All information therein is current as of early Mirtul, in the Year of the Prince.  Nather, a merchant from Amn, has been robbed of six identical very valuable statues. The seven-foot-tall elven male nudes, sculpted of white marble by unknown artisans long ago, are said to be very heavy, fragile, and incredibly life-like. They vanished from the locked interior of a warehouse in the docks area, without disturbing a dozen private guards. Magic is suspected. The City Watch has contacted The Watchful Order of Magists & Protectors for professional assistance.  Alusair Nacacia, a princess of far-off Cormyr who has been missing for over a year, and is sought after by her father, King Azoun IV, who has offered 12,000 pieces of gold and a knighthood for her safe return, has been seen in the City. She is said to be living as an adventurer, and as the companion of one of the powerful mages of Waterdeep, but it is not known which one. A man who boasted that he knew was found petrified at his corner tavern seat moments after he spoke, and his stone form subsequently and mysteriously shattered. Alusair is known to he slim, short, and winsomely beautiful; impish and dark-eyed, the diplomat Aszundar Zel of Neverwinter described her three winters ago, after a court visit. Since Alusairs disappearance, many wild and colorful rumors as to her whereabouts have made the rounds.  Zulmark Korathar, the famous fighter-adventurer, is said to be gathering companions to form a new adventuring company, to explore certain abandoned dwarven cities he has located under mountains in the North. Interested Fist (#272 parties can find him most nights in The Bloody Presper & Snail Streets, Dock Ward); the grizzled, one-eyed veteran of The Blue Mask and The Riders of the Night adventuring companies (both now disbanded) is said to know the North as few other living men do, and to have fought more fearsome monsters than any men livingif at least half of the tales he tells over a jack of wine are to be believed.  On two nights in the past month, wyverns have been seen in the night skies over the City. Griffon-mounted Guard patrols sent aloft found nothing, so magic is suspected. The Watchful Order of Magists & Protectors fears that an evil mage of Waterdeep or a nearby, hidden locale has developed a spell that summons and/or teleports wyverns, and controls them in servitude to the caster. No attacks or thefts connected to the sightings have yet been reported. POLITICS, CRIME & PUNISHMENT Herein the formal politics of Waterdeep are discussedthe intrigue of guilds, contending factions, and power groups is left to a 14\n\nlater chapter. A general note is necessary, however; social level is far less important in Waterdeep than in other cities of the Realms (and presumably, elsewhere); the crossroads nature of the City and the upand-down fortunes of those who make their living in trade makes the inhabitants of the City of Splendors tolerant of a wide variety of peoples, with widely varying customs, religions, incomes, and interests. A paladin native to Waterdeep, for example, would readily accept that people who reject rigid authority are just as good and worthy of his aid and protection as their more enlightened neighbors, unless they are actively evil. In like manner, a cavalier might think himself above a dungsweeper of the Citys streets, but he would never act more superior in dealings with the sweeper beyond a slight condescension and a simplification of speech and manners. Low birth or station is not in Waterdeep a recipe for ridicule or rudeness from ones betters, beyond what ones actions would earn from ones equals in any case. Visiting cavaliers and paladins are, of course, a different matter, although they are soon enlightened by those of all walks of life (or by the Watch, if they are very objectionable). Live and let live is a good description of the attitude of most Waterdhavians to their neighbors; everyone is busy in the pursuit of wealth, and prudes, gossips, and folk who wish to tell others how to act, think, and live are more a source of entertainment than a serious social force. Government Waterdeep is presently governed by sixteen Lords of Waterdeep, who are seen by the general populace only when sitting in the Lords Court, identities concealed by identical masks and robes. It is rare indeed for more than seven Lords to sit in Court on a given occasion. This democratic council has a largely secret membership. Everyone knows that Piergeiron the Paladinson, Warden of Waterdeep (= commander of the City Guard), Overmaster of the Guilds, and Commander of the Watch is a Lord of Waterdeep. The paladin sits openly in his golden-spired palace conducting the Citys diplomatic and legal business. Among the citizens, it is generally agreed that the archmage Khelben Blackstaff Arunsun is also of the Lords (perhaps chief among them), but no one who knows the identities of the other Lords for certain has made them public knowledge. One hears the names Mirt, Larissa, and Texter. DMs are encouraged to develop their own Lordssix are left undescribed here, although one should bear in mind that any Lords created should be of fairly low public profile (i.e. should not be noble, and cannot be Guildmasters), and must be of essentially good alignment (probably neutral, or perhaps lawful) to fit the established character of the council, which already has its share of chaotic good members, notably Mirt. This will allow DMs to use Lords behind the scenes to influence events in Waterdeep, foiling any players who read this and learn the identities of the Lords given here, and allow DMs some elbow room for future modifications that a completely open and set membership would not permit (and the mystery adds to the fun). The penalty for impersonating a Lord is death: on the spot, without delay, with speak with the dead magics employed later to find out why, as time permits. The Lords all know each other, and Piergeiron can demand that they unmask to him at any time (refusal is itself a capital offense). PIERGEIRON the Paladinson Palace, all wards 14th (or greater?) level paladin LG Tyr Human male Piergeiron is the only openly-known Lord of Waterdeep, and speaks for all the Lords. He is also the City of Splendors chief diplomat to foreign powers and its chief defender, being both Commander of the Watch and Warden (commander) of the Guard. As Overmaster of the Guilds, he has clear authority to override Guild law, and his decree is the only absolute law in this city of interpretation and subtle evasion. As such, he is very safe from Waterdhavians and his life is threatened by foreign powers, such as Amn, Calimshan, and Luskan, for the same reason: he is so above reproach, and so able in his administration and justice, that the City flourishes. Waterdhavians could not conceive of a better man to fill the offices Piergeiron discharges; those wishing the City ill want to remove him if at all possible. Piergeiron speaks seldom, and slowly; as a result, he is sometimes snidely known as the Thickskull, though never to his face. He is not stupid, but often pretends to be, to draw others out into verbal admissions they might otherwise not make. His grander nickname is due to the fact that his father Athar, The Shining Knight, The Arm of MIRT the Moneylender Mirts Mansion, all wards Fighter of unknown level CG Tymora Human male 1 5 Tyr, was a very of the North. famous paladin adventurer KHELBEN Blackstaff ARUNSUN (KELLben AIR-un-sun) Blackstaff Tower, all wards, travels widely (including extraplanar) 26th (or greater?) level magic-user LN (strong Good tendencies) Mystra Human Male Khelben is the most powerful and influential archmage of the Sword Coast, and is one of the rulers of Waterdeep (although he does not admit this openly, most in the North suspect him of being so). Allied to the Harpers, and instrumental in keeping the Lords Alliance (of Silverymoon, Sundabar, Neverwinter, and other good cities of the North, with Waterdeep) intact, Khelben is always working to influence this or that occurrence or trend, looking years ahead. He is a forester and a painter, and has tutored many mages of note (including Malchor Harpell, Savengriff, and Nain). Khelben appears as a tall (6), wellmuscled, bearded man with a receding hairline, black hair shot through with silver, and a distinguished manner. He is gravely wise, not pompous, and is fully learned in the history, lore, and traditions of magic as practised by humans in the North since the rise from barbarism. It is suggested that DMs adjust Khelbens level upwards to ten levels above the strongest PC, for use in humbling runaway characters. Note that Khelben can escape by an Elminsters evasion (improved contingency) spell if he gets into trouble, and can always call on Malchor, Nain, and Savengriff for aid if need be, by means of a sending. A fat, casual, hard-drinking man, coarsemannered and gruff (in earlier days, also lusty and brawling), Mirt is really one of the most shrewd Lords of Waterdeep, even if secretly romantic and soft-hearted. Often seen wheezing about from tavern to tavern in food-stained clothing, Mirt the Moneylender is a very rich man. He was once a successful mercenary general of the North and Sword Coast lands, Mirt the Merciless. Mirt is one of the most influential Lords, well-loved by his fellows (even the paladins). He is wise in tactics and in judging the char-\n\nacters of beings of all races and creeds. Mirts constant companion is the young fighter Asper, whom he once rescued as an infant from a sacked city, and whom he regards as his little girl, despite her nowmatured beauty. (Asper is a fighter of unknown level, DEX 17 CHA 16, CG, worships Tymora, and is a lithe, petite beauty, soft-spoken yet merry.) Larissa Neathal 4th level fighter NG Sune Larissa Neathal is a courtesan of Waterdeep who plays a giggling, empty-headed sex-kitten with all the visiting envoys and diplomats she has time for, and gathers all the information for the Lords that she can this way. When weary or upset, however, she turns to Durnan (see below) for comfort. Her capacity for court parties is legendary, and she can dance all day and all night if necessary, without apparent ill effects. She is either immune to most poisons or sleep drugs, or has some sort of magical protection against these. Texter 17th (or greater) level paladin LG Texter is a paladin, like Piergeiron a follower of Tyr. Unlike Piergeiron, Texter has little patience for ceremony, and prefers to be out and about doing things, such as leading road and ship patrols around Waterdeep tirelessly. His vigilance has prevented the City of Splendors from being surprised by attacking enemies on several occasions. Every so often, Texter feels he has to renew his faith and dedication by solitary rides into the Northern wilderness, where he singlehandedly battles any orcs, trolls, or other evil creatures he encounters, and inspects firsthand conditions in the North. Texter is almost fearless, but he is not stupid. He will consider attacking twelve orcs single-handed to be fair odds, but will retreat before an orc horde to warn the city, rather then charging to attack. Durnan 12th level (or greater) fighter NG Durnan the Wanderer is a retired (?) fighter who now runs The Yawning Portal inn (building #4) in Waterdeep (which contains a well-like shaft leading down into Undermountain, the subterranean ways under Mount Waterdeep). He is a closemouthed, prudent man who hates unfairness and injustice, but is tolerant of the differing interests of others, until they draw a weapon in his inn, whereupon he promptly punishes them severely on the spot. Durnan and Mirt are old friends, once companions in adventure. Many years before he met Mirt in a sea-battle, Durnan was a solitary, wandering adventurer, who traveled the North extensively. Durnan was born somewhere in the remote North, and especially hates hobgoblins. Mirt believes that Durnans family, friends, and neighbors were slain by hobgoblins, leaving Durnan homeless when he was a child, but this is no more than a guess; Durnan will not talk of such things. When Durnan doesnt want to answer any questions, he will simply look at the questioner with a calm, expressionless face and say nothing. He shouts in battle, but rarely gets into verbal arguments, retreating instead into silence.
