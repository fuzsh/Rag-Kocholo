        "text": "Sterling Iron and Railway Company\n\nRecords, 1740-1918\n\nSC14069\n\nView catalog record\n\nRelated Index\n\nSurname Index to the Sterling Iron and Railway Company Finding Aid\n\nHistorical Note:\n\nThe Sterling Iron and Railway Company, which was situated in Ramapo (Rockland County), New York, operated under various names from 1736 until 1923.Â Early records indicate the original name of the firm was Sterling Forge and Furnace Company.Â Â This company can trace its history back to 1736 when Cornelius Board and Timothy Ward obtained 150 acres of the Sterling tract and built a bloomery and forge, turning out the first iron made at Sterling. Four years later, Board sold his interest in Sterling to Ward. Following this transaction, the ownership of the ironworks seems to have been shared by a number of individuals, including William Smith, James Burling, William Hawxhurst, and Abel Noble.\n\nThe 1760s saw a period of expansion at the ironworks with such products as pig and bar iron, cart, wagon and chair spindles, anchors, teakettles, skillets, pots, refined iron, and potash being produced. Just who the actual owners were during this period of expansion is not clear.\n\nThe first furnace at Sterling had been erected in 1751 and a year later, Abel Noble and his father, William, had constructed a forge near the furnace, producing their first anchors in 1753. In October 1758 William Hawxhurst and Abel Noble signed articles of co-partnership regarding the manufacturing of iron at Sterling and most likely Noble and Hawxhurst had a financial interest in the company. It was also around this time that the first of the Townsend family became affiliated with the Sterling Ironworks. Although the exact date of Peter Townsend's association with Sterling is disputed by historians, a ledger page shows that by February 1768 he was in partnership with Abel Noble.\n\nDespite complaints from Peter Townsend regarding the shortage of working men, Sterling remained a hub of activity during the American Revolution. The ironworks performed a valuable service by providing the Continental Army with arms and ammunition and supplying anchors for Navy warships. Sterling also had a more direct role in the war effort. In February 1778 Peter Townsend agreed to produce an iron chain for the Continental Army. The chain was to be placed across the Hudson River at West Point and was to serve as a barrier to British vessels. The chain was laid in place on April 30, 1778 but remained untested, as the British never did attempt to cross it.\n\nIn 1783 Peter Townsend died, leaving his share of the ironworks to his wife Hannah (the daughter of William Hawxhurst) and to their two sons, Peter and Isaac. In 1797, Abel Noble, senior proprietor and part owner, sold his interest to Peter Townsend II, thus giving control of the ironworks, for the most part, to the Townsend family. The Townsends were joined in 1812 by Daniel and William Jackson and Henry McCoun who erected a saw works at Sterling and who attained a part ownership in the ironworks as well. The Sterling Ironworks were granted rights of incorporation by the New York State Legislature on April 1, 1814, and shortly thereafter, Peter Townsend completed construction of a cannon foundry on the Sterling site. The first cannon were produced in 1817 but, in spite of initial success, the foundry proved unprofitable and the federal government probably assumed control.\n\nLittle is known about Sterling from 1817 to 1825. It appears that legal difficulties or financial trouble hampered the ironworks as available records for this period deal with Southfield furnace rather than Sterling. The title of a pamphlet published at this time, \"Report of the Committee Appointed to Examine the Condition of the Sterling Iron Works,\" further hints at some sort of financial or legal tangle.\n\nBusiness at Sterling continued as usual during the 1830s and 1840s and little of consequence occurred until 1856 when the Townsends decided to sell the ironworks. A nine-page pamphlet entitled \"A Map: Showing the Location of the Sterling Iron Estate, Orange County, New York\" was published and sent to prominent men in the iron industry. However, no buyer was found and it was not until 1864 that the Townsends were able to sell their iron estate. On April 1, with the aid of David Crawford, Jr., the son-in-law of Peter Townsend III, the property was sold to the Sterling Iron and Railway Company, which had been formed to assume control of the ironworks. Peter Townsend III had substantial interest in the company and he was joined by several prominent men, including Thomas A. Scott, president of the Pennsylvania Railroad and assistant secretary of war during the Civil War, Jay Cooke, the financier, Joel Barlow Morehead, Samuel L.M. Barlow and George C. Clarke. In November 1867 a separate company, the Sterling Mountain Railway Company, was established for the purpose of managing the railroad branch of the company.\n\nFrom the post-Civil War period until 1890, there is a gap in the Sterling records and not much is known about the ironworks during this time. However, by 1890 it was evident that business had begun to falter and in 1892 there was a reorganization of the company. Macgrane Coxe was named president but the depression of 1892-1896 led to a further decline and frequent changes in the leadership of the company continued. James D. Rowland of Philadelphia succeeded Cox as president and he was followed by Theodore Price in 1905. H.A. Van Alstyne assumed leadership of the company in 1911 and continued in that capacity until 1920.Â In 1918, all the holdings of the company were leased to Ramapo Ore Company. There was a brief flurry of activity at Sterling during World War I but it ceased with the war's end and on July 1, 1923, all operations ceased.\n\nFor further information regarding the Sterling ironworks and the other ironworks of the Ramapos, see James M. Ransom's Vanishing Ironworks of the Ramapos: The Story of the Forges, Furnaces and Mines of the New Jersey-New York Border Area upon which this account has been based. A detailed account of the forging of the chain across the Hudson is given by Macgrane Coxe in The Sterling Furnace and the West Point Chain: An Historical Address. See also Chapter IV of Ransom's Vanishing Ironworks of the Ramapos.\n\nProvenance Note:\n\nThe records of Sterling Iron and Railway Company were acquired by the New York State Library from multiple sources.Â The first group was purchased in March 1954 from James Lewis Hook of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, a dealer of early American books and manuscripts.Â This group comprises the contents of boxes 1-13 which were accessioned in as SC14069 in July 1957.Â The second group of records was purchased in February 1982 from Denning House and subsequently accessioned as SC17562.Â This group was collated with SC14069 in December 2003 and now comprises most of the records found in boxes 14-19.Â The third group of records was purchased ca. July 1985 from Harold Nestler, a historical manuscripts dealer, and subsequently accessioned as SC18613. This group was collated with SC14069 in August 2009, and placed in box 20.Â The fourth group of records was purchased in December 2003 from Carmen D. Valentino, dealer of rare books and manuscripts in Philadelphia.Â These records are found in folders 15-17 in box 19.Â\n\nScope and Content Note:\n\nThe records of Sterling Iron and Railway Company relate to the operations of the iron foundry, which were situated in the Ramapo mountain range in southeastern New York near the New Jersey border. The Sterling Ironworks, one of the oldest, largest and most productive of the ironworks that lay nestled in the Ramapo Mountains, operated from 1736 to 1920.\n\nThese records include accounts, receipts, ledger books, correspondence, documents dealing with iron production, etc. In addition to this, there are many documents dealing with the activities of the proprietors of the Sterling Ironworks, especially of the Townsend family which controlled the works for most of the period it was in operation. There are many deeds, bonds and mortgages, leases and releases, articles of agreement, assignments of judgment, etc. A few documents concern ironworks other than Sterling, such as the Southfield furnace and Augusta forge, but these are relatively few. Some of the more important documents are listed in the brief descriptions found at the beginning of each section of the collection.\n\nSeries Descriptions:\n\nLetters Related to the Manufacture of Arms and Ammunition for the Federal Government, 1799-1826 (Items 1-68: Box 1; Item 69: Box 12)Â\n\nThese documents are mostly letters relating to orders for cannon and ammunition and concerning other matters regarding armaments made by Sterling Forge and Sterling Anchory.

On April 1, 1864, through the intercession of David Crawford, Jr., the son-in-law of Peter Townsend III, all of the property of the Sterling Iron Works was sold to the recently-formed Sterling Iron and Railway Co. Peter Townsend III had a large interest in the company and he was joined by several prominent men including Thomas A. Scott, president of the Pennsylvania Railroad and assistant secretary of war during the Civil War, Jay Cooke, the financier, Joel Barlow Morehead, Samuel L.M. Barlow, and George C. Clark.\n\nIn November 1867 a separate company, the Sterling Mountain Railway Co., was formed to assume control of the railroad operations. As of November 30, 1867 its officers were J.
