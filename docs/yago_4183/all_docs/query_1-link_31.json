        "text": "Mike (Source: Ironmaster.com)\n\nFor some time now I have been searching, mostly casually, for a weighted vest that fit my needs. I could never quite pull the trigger - whether due to price, appearance, or reviews - but I took it as a sign when the IM email listing this item popped up. It has provided convenient workout density, and the ease of changing the weights has allowed for my wife to utilize it as well. The vest feels bulletproof, and much like all of the Ironmaster products I have purchased over the years (im2000, cable tower, multiple benches, several sets of of DB handles, plates, accessories, etc.), the quality if fantastic.\n\nJason (Source: Ironmaster.com)\n\nThe weight sits up high for me. The vest feels short but I think they are supposed to be. Used it 2 times so far and a first time user of a weighted vest. Feels very durable and is secure enough for a short jog or brisk walks when loaded up. Here is something to note they rate it for 70lbs but each pocket is able to hold 2 x 5lbs which in the end is 80lbs total. so make sure to not over stress your vest by mistake. It may hold up but there is a reason they reduced the rating likely due to premature wear and tear users experienced. unless you are fairly strong donning this vest fully weighted is a challenge so you may need some help loading the rear plates. The velcro straps hold strong, the extra thinner strap I have not found a need for as of yet but I also have not used this vest a lot nor have done any runs with it. Brisk walks, stairs, squats and some jumping around. I hope it holds up a long time. It is winter here and I still work up a sweat quickly in this so will be much worse in warm months. Breathable and durable enough for 70lbs don't exactly go hand in hand.\n\nRoss (Source: Ironmaster.com)\n\nI have used this vest since the original version was first introduced and i couldn't be happier. Unlike most other vests on the market that have a fixed weight or are barely adjustable this one can be customized down to a single pound. If you own the dumbbells this is a must. My favs are being able to do weighted pushups, pullups and dips. Last but not least IRONMASTER's customer service is top notch which is something very hard to come by these days.\n\nJason Fischer (Source: Ironmaster.com)\n\nI have had Iron Master adjustable dumbbells for several years and LOVE them. Super solid. I saw the vest when I was visiting the site and thought it could be a great add for walks and maybe weightless leg training...step-ups, lunges, etc. It is well made and solid. I’ve enjoyed walking with not crazy weight, but the additional definitely pushes you more. It is a no-brainer add if you have the dumbbells. I’m pleased with the add for my purposes. I don’t partake in weighted dips or pull-ups, it’s hard enough for me without additional weight! Good add for variety type workouts for sure. :)"
