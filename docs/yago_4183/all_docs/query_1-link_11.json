        "text": "By coincidence, I'm reading Arnold's book!\n\nFrom _My Game And Yours_ by Arnold Palmer, copyright 1963, 1965; 8th printing, LLC# 65-15025, page 93 in Chapter X, How to Buy a Set of Clubs and the Right Ball for You:\n\n\"You probably know about my putter for it's had a lot of publicity. I've had it since 1957 and I've filed it, scraped it and soldered it until it looks nothing at all like the original. I can't even remember how it looked at the beginning. The only time I ever came close to throwing it away was after the first round of the 1962 British Open, when everything else about my game was going well but my putting was awful. My wife saved the day, both for the putter and for me. She noticed that I had finally managed to file so much off the bottom that all I had left was a blade so narrow that it kept hitting the ball below center. I immediately soldered some more metal to the bottom and my putting improved at once. Had it not been for Winnie's sharp eye, I probably would never have won the tournament.\n\nI used to use a different putter, sometimes in every new round of a tournament; but in recent years I've always relied on Old Faithful and I think I'd be lost without her. But still I'm not satisfied; I'm constantly looking for a new putter that will give me even better results. A few times I've thought I'd found the new love for which I'm seeking, but when the chips were down in a tournament I always went back to Old Faithful.\"\n\nThe drawing is on page 116, from poor photos elsewhere in the book, it had a back flange that looks sortof like an 8802:\n\n[attachment=2462549:Arnold Palmer's Puttercropped.jpg]\n\n[quote name='majic' timestamp='1413567395' post='10305655']\n\nI am not a collector of this putter but I am pretty darn sure it was an IMG5. The reason Randy was selling perfect originals for this money it was the putter Jumbo Ozaki used and in Japan you could not find one. My first one of this style came from my Mom and its here somewhere. Green Shafted 3852. I have at my shop another hand me down early chrome shaft. IMG5 and i will try to find them. The picture in the book is an IMG5. The best putter I ever saw was Al Doyle. He used a no offset IM model. Next a Tad Moore and he won everything with this putter and i made a replica called a Rookie 47 of it.\n\n[/quote]\n\nTommy Armour Ironmaster putters were desigated as follows\n\nIM =Ironmaster=34 1/2 inches\n\nIMG= goose neck=34 1/2 inches IMP,IMGP=34 1/2 inches with profeel shaft\n\nIM5 =35 inches or IMG5\n\nIM6=36 inches or IMG6\n\nIMGL=ladies which was 33 1/2 inches long\n\nIMGT=glass shaft 34 1/2 inches long\n\nCHARLEY PENNA\n\n[quote name='majic' timestamp='1413567395' post='10305655']\n\nI am not a collector of this putter but I am pretty darn sure it was an IMG5.

Do you remember if that was the case?\n\nI loved watching him play. I always enjoy watching someone who is committed to doing it his way, even if it defies the conventional.\n\n[quote name='majic' timestamp='1413567395' post='10305655']\n\nI am not a collector of this putter but I am pretty darn sure it was an IMG5.

He started using this putter in 1957. Pictures of it show a very long hosel.\n\nAnother story that Randy Jensen told me is that he said he saw a putter that was supposed to Arnies IM. He said a collector owned it who got it from Tony Lemas caddy. I find that story hard to believe also since supposedly Arnie loaned his putter to Tony Lema in 64 when Tony won the British, Arnie was injured and could not play that year. Story is Tony gave it back to Arnie, So what putter did Randy see??\n\nAll I want to see is the soleplate. I have lots up great pictures of Arnie putting with it, but none of the pictures show the stamping on the sole of the putter.\n\nI have a message out to Howdy,Arnies dentist who took thousands of pictures of Arnie hoping he has one.\n\nI was researching Arnold Palmer 'The Original' putters a few years ago, and stumbled across the thread on PutterTalk (by drewspin) about Arnold Palmer's history with Wilson and the Designed By Arnold Putter putter. Someone mentioned Walker Inman, Jr.'s name in a comment. I was supposed to play in an event and knew I'd see Walker there, so I re-read the thread. Then, on Thursday 9/4/08, I got to ask him what he knew about the history of this putter. It inspired about 45 minutes of conversation, which was very fascinating.\n\nWalker told me that the putter that Arnold Palmer used in his 1962 Master's victory, as well as many other events, was actually his (Walker's). It was a Tommy Armour IronMaster that Walker had bent (under-slung and off-set), then added more weight to the flange. He and Palmer played practice rounds and tournament rounds quite often and once Arnold saw his putter, he asked Walker to let him try it. He loved it and wouldn't give it back. Walker was accustomed to custom-tweaking his clubs, so he knew he could probably craft another one like it. Apparently, there was some kind of \"honor code\" on tour back in the days when it wasn't easy to find your perfect set of clubs. If you let someone try one of your clubs and he ended up using it with success, out of respect you couldn't get it back until he stopped using it.\n\nLong story short, he ended up getting the putter back from Wilson Sporting Goods (Palmer had given it to them briefly to use as a model of what he wanted the DBAP to look like) and kept it in his Pro Shop at Scioto CC in Columbus, Ohio. Apparently, one of his assistants named Jay starting using it. The assistant got a winter job at Augusta National and a man in the Master's Museum saw it and asked the assistant to let him have it for the museum. Walker was upset, but what could he do? He said that he had stamped his name into the sole and that the last few letters of his name was still visible. He may still try to get it back someday, but the Master's Museum curators will probably lay a guilt trip on him.\n\nThere's way more to this story, but I'll spare the details. His stories about \"under-slinging\" putters and Palmer's eye for clubs were just the tip of the iceberg that could have led to a thousand more hours of conversation. Walker could write a book the size of \"War and Peace\" about his Tour days.\n\n[quote name='dbleag' timestamp='1413820347' post='10319569']\n\nI was researching Arnold Palmer 'The Original' putters a few years ago, and stumbled across the thread on PutterTalk (by drewspin) about Arnold Palmer's history with Wilson and the Designed By Arnold Putter putter.

Apparently, there was some kind of \"honor code\" on tour back in the days when it wasn't easy to find your perfect set of clubs. If you let someone try one of your clubs and he ended up using it with success, out of respect you couldn't get it back until he stopped using it.\n\nLong story short, he ended up getting the putter back from Wilson Sporting Goods (Palmer had given it to them briefly to use as a model of what he wanted the DBAP to look like) and kept it in his Pro Shop at Scioto CC in Columbus, Ohio. Apparently, one of his assistants named Jay starting using it. The assistant got a winter job at Augusta National and a man in the Master's Museum saw it and asked the assistant to let him have it for the museum. Walker was upset, but what could he do? He said that he had stamped his name into the sole and that the last few letters of his name was still visible. He may still try to get it back someday, but the Master's Museum curators will probably lay a guilt trip on him.\n\nThere's way more to this story, but I'll spare the details. His stories about \"under-slinging\" putters and Palmer's eye for clubs were just the tip of the iceberg that could have led to a thousand more hours of conversation. Walker could write a book the size of \"War and Peace\" about his Tour days.\n\n[/quote]\n\nI think that code of honor may still be in existence.\n\nI once loaned Keith Fergus a T P Mills Tour #1 model - the original one with the pencil shaft. He won the Jack Nicklaus Memorial tournament with it. I never saw the putter again.\n\nTexsport\n\n[quote name='dbleag' timestamp='1413820347' post='10319569']\n\nI was researching Arnold Palmer 'The Original' putters a few years ago, and stumbled across the thread on PutterTalk (by drewspin) about Arnold Palmer's history with Wilson and the Designed By Arnold Putter putter. Someone mentioned Walker Inman, Jr.'s name in a comment. I was supposed to play in an event and knew I'd see Walker there, so I re-read the thread. Then, on Thursday 9/4/08, I got to ask him what he knew about the history of this putter. It inspired about 45 minutes of conversation, which was very fascinating.\n\nWalker told me that the putter that Arnold Palmer used in his 1962 Master's victory, as well as many other events, was actually his (Walker's). It was a Tommy Armour IronMaster that Walker had bent (under-slung and off-set), then added more weight to the flange.
