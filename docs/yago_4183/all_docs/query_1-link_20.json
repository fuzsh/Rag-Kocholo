        "text": "Description\n\nFeatures:\n\nQuick-Lock handle design lets you add or remove plates with just a partial turn of the locking screws! US Patent 7,182,716\n\nAdjust from 5-45 lbs each in 2.5 lb increments in just seconds. (45 lbs each dumbbell = 90 lbs total)\n\nChange weights on any flat surface. The Dumbbell Stand is not included but is available separately.\n\nSet includes two handles with four locking screws, 12 ea. 5 lb plates and 4 ea. 2.5 lb plates. Handles weigh 5 lbs empty and each locking screw weighs 2.5 lbs so the starting weight is 10 lbs each dumbbell before plates are added. 35 lbs of plates can be loaded on each handle.\n\nDumbbells lock up tight with no rattling or looseness. They feel just like traditional fixed weight dumbbells and are not restrictive in the ways you can grip them.\n\nChrome plated steel handles with diamond knurled grips.\n\nHeavy Duty - go ahead and drop them. No plastic or fragile parts!\n\nLifetime warranty!\n\nAdd-on kits available to expand the set to 75lbs each or go all the way up to 120 lbs each dumbbell.\n\nDumbbell dimensions are just 6.7\" square x 11.5\" long at the 45lb size and just 9\" long at 20lbs size. Handle grip diameter is 1.25\" and there is 6.5\" grip width inside.\n\nThe weight plates are marked in both LBS and KGS.\n\nWe've had a lot of questions about upgrading to heavier weights in the future so we now offer an upgrade weight kit. The dumbbell handles and locking screws are the same parts as the 75 lb set so you can add more weight to the 45 lb set if you need it. Add up to 30 lbs per dumbbell with the standard included handles and locking screws. You can find the upgrade kit here: 75 lb Upgrade Kit"
