        "text": "The Ironmaster's Mansion also known as the \"Big House\" was the social and business center of Hopewell Furnace. It was the home to the furnace owner's family, the central office for the furnace, a place of hospitality for guests, and a boarding house for single workers. The house has 19 rooms on four floors. The oldest part of the house dates to circa 1800. Subsequent additions throughout the 19th C. expanded the house you see today.\n\nThe basement contains a kitchen and dining room for the use by the furnace's moulders and other iron workers. The furnace's main office, family parlor, kitchen and dining room were on the first floor. The family and guest bedrooms were on the second. The family's children, servants and boarders likely lived in different parts of the attic and rear wing."
