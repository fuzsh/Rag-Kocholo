        "text": "CategoriesObject typeMaterials and techniques\n\nIron, cast, painted\n\nBrief description\n\nCast iron bench, painted, made by the Coalbrookdale Company, designed by Christopher Dresser. England, c. 1870.\n\nPhysical description\n\nCast iron bench, now painted yellow. Cast in four separate panels, the seat frame, the back, and the two sides.The openwork design of the back is made up of an intricate symmetrical pattern of heart shapes and scrolls, decorated with five petalled flowers. The two side panels incorporate trefoil arches and leafy scrolls. All the panels are bolted together by means of three rods.Five wooden slats screwed in place into the seat frame are probably replacements of the originals.\n\nMade by the Coalbrookdale Company iron foundry, of Shropshire, and offered in its catalogue as the 'Mediaeval' model. It was probably designed by Christopher Dresser (1834-1904), and its design is loosely inspired by medieval manuscripts of the 12th-13th century. It was available in three painted colour options, bronzed, green or chocolate.\n\nDimensions\n\nHeight: 87cm\n\nWidth: 192.8cm\n\nDepth of seat depth: 40.5cm\n\nMarks and inscriptions\n\nCOALBROOKDALE (The mark is stamped twice, in the middle of the front seat frame and on the back frame, top centre.)\n\nDiamond shaped Registered Design. (This design is dated to 22 April 1870. This is stamped to the front leg at each side.)\n\nPattern No. 240809 (Stamped onto each of the back legs.)\n\nGallery labelHistorical context\n\nChristopher Dresser believed that it was possible to bring some of the qualities of wrought-ironwork into the cheaper production of cast ironwork. He was designing for the Coalbrookdale firm from 1867 to the 1880s, producing a series of distinctive hallstands, umbrella stands and garden furniture.This design was registered by the firm on 22nd April 1870 as no. 240809.\n\nCast iron is an alloy of iron and other elements, principally carbon. It has a crystalline structure and melts easily, which makes it particularly suitable for casting, when it is poured into moulds to form items.Casting makes it possible to produce numerous examples, and generally foundries used the same model for decades. Other foundries would also cast models from another foundry's original, which meant that the same example was produced by many different firms.Coalbrookdale was unusual in that it almost always marked its products.\n\nProduction\n\nMade and marked by the Coalbrookdale Company\n\nSummary\n\nChristopher Dresser (1834-1904), the renowned and prolific designer in all media, believed that it was possible to bring some of the qualitites of wrought-ironwork into the cheaper production of cast ironwork.
