        "text": "This movie is an artifact: there was a time cinema didn't have any rules or conventions, and directors didn't need to pack their movies into 90 to 120 minute egg rolls of entertainment (La Roue was originally 9 hours long). Yes, we got Diazs, Tárrs and some others nowadays, but damn it, it's just not the same.\n\nThe Wheel (or La Roue) is 4 hours of straightforward drama that constantly reminds us that there's nothing like movies in the art world; the camerawork and editing are like nothing I've seen yet it makes up so much other works, it's a dazzle to watch.\n\nAbout the narrative, there's a lot I can compare to PTA's There Will be Blood, not only…\n\nDirected by Abel Gance (Napoléon), La Roue exhibits a degree of technical accomplishment which is extraordinary for the earliness of its production, particularly in its remarkably distinctive editing. At a most basic level, it's the equivalent of everything which could have been committed to celluloid at the time of its production, while at the same time gesturing as the forerunner to many of the techniques that are still routinely in employment nearly one hundred years later.\n\nThe movie’s visual creativeness and originality penetrates virtually every frame and the momentum of the films editing patterns itself to the events on the screen, from tranquillity to ferociousness. Admittedly it's not an effortless watch, nor is it the most entertaining at four and…\n\nThis is really only interesting as technical achievement and historical curio - the excessive length isn't really earned and furthermore the narrative is extremely stupid and actually kind of fucked up. Yet, the cutting is constantly a flex - but never for ideas, Gance is only interested in feeling, and we can see here that the main purpose for Gance's rapid cutting is to produce a active, instinctual and involuntary response to the mere movement of phenomena - an approach which may have actually been necessary to produce any emotion out of such an absurd and ridiculous scenario. It's often forgotten (like Gance today, I guess) that for all of his formal aplomb, that he was a deeply conservative filmmaker…\n\nCinematic Time Capsule\n\n1923 Marathon - Film #8\n\n”Good Lord, the track is still open! The 2020 will collide with all this!”\n\nWhen chaos and destruction at a French railroad depot leaves an young girl orphaned, a kindly widowed engineer decides she might make a perfect sister and friend for his young son. Well, cut to years later, and faster than you can say ‘OEDIPUS REX!’ things have gotten rather complicated, weird and outta control.\n\n”Listen, Hersan. I’m going to tell you about the most horrible thing that could ever happen to a man.”\n\nI love it when I stumble across a pioneering artist who truly cares about their art and throws everything they can into pushing the boundaries of…\n\n\"Love torments me like nothing else can. And I engrave my heart in the soul of this violin before I die. This my secret will remain hidden, but much closer to your lips. And when you play in the twilight, sliding the bow over my secret, you will say to yourself, captivated, turning your head:‘Has someone just spoken to me of love?’\"\n\nAbel Gance is the man. The revolutionary technical advancements were expected, but here I am truly won over by the romanticism that takes the forefront in this picture and further recontextualizes the rest of his works as pure romantic works. Gance is a romantic at his core. He is notably inspired by the works of the legendary…\n\n7th Abel Gance (after La Folie du Docteur Tube, Napoleon, Mater Dolorosa, Au Secours!, End of the World and J'Accuse (1919))\n\nPart 5 of the Longest Month of My Life\n\nNow the challenge starts to get tough; only with some serious dedication was I able to make this in two days, though it could have been less had it not been for a piercing migraine. Still, I am incredibly pleased to have seen this in its near seven hour form, probably the longest we'll ever get to see it; Gance's original version was, apparently, nine hours, but it seems there's two hours completely lost to the mists of time, so here we are. Whether a full rating is possible considering…\n\nthe wheel of life of turns. the wheel of love turns. the wheel of industry turns, leaving those abandoned by its relentless charge to form small communities of happiness, away from the pride and prejudices of modern life. welcome to oedipus’s tale for the 20th century; ‘tis an expanded tragedy which breathes and speaks the language of earthly troubles and miracles.\n\nit’s formally perfect, this La Roue. looked at a distance, one might be forgiven into thinking it shouldn’t work, with a rather contained tale of tragedy spanning nearly seven hours. the magic, however, is in the hands of magician abel gance. his tools? ferocious editing, painted colours, an eye for haunting landscapes to work as backdrops for pivotal…\n\nPhew. 4 1/2 hours. A silent film. Something I never thought I'd do until the 1001 list came along and said \"Hey, we've got long silent films for you to watch\", so here I am.\n\nI've gotta be honest, this is something I would've never done, but it was honestly a pretty rewarding watch, especially near the end of this behemoth. Obviously, considering its runtime its not the most entertaining piece of media you could watch today, but I still found it rather intriguing to think about. The amount of hard work that went into something like this is unimaginable, but those involved in the making of La Roue are true pioneers of the film industry. That's the main reason…\n\nthe grand european working class drama bisected by smokey lighting and a rapid emotional editing style that wasn't really rediscovered in the west until the mid 80s: this has more in common the moody romanticism of tony scott's the hunger or the industrial domesticity of michael bay's armageddon than it does with most of its epic length contemporaries.\n\nit's an affecting romance built on the tried and true principles of proto-pulp serial literature like hugo or dumas, but instead of transplanting the dialogue-heavy content of those books into silent film narrative, which wouldn't have worked in the slightest at the time and perhaps even less now, it replicates their structure in several astonishing set piece sequences. we don't get the…\n\nI honestly thought I'd never see this on the big screen. I thought that I'd spend the rest of my life watching this on laptops and televisions, asking friends in increasingly futile gestures to see it, maybe someday renting out a theater for an exorbitant price and playing all 7 hours in full, but only for a really special occasion. And now I've finally seen it. The way it was meant to be seen.\n\nThis may be the greatest cinematic achievement of all time. Admittedly I have not seen Gance's follow-up to this, Napoleon, but from the bits and pieces I've seen of it, while it certainly surpasses La Roue in its spectacle, it is the combination of characterization, writing,…"
