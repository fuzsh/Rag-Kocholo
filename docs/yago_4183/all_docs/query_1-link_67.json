        "text": "50K\n\nOur 50K course was designed to give you the chance to experience all the best of the northern Michaux. You will find yourself quickly navigating sandstone boulder ridges, woodland savannah, and lush rhododendron creeksides. We will guide you (via fantastic course marking) to nearly every great vista in this part of the forest using primarily single-track trail interspersed with occasional grassy double-track (and less than 4 miles total of gravel or asphalt road). Six kick-butt aid stations will be distributed along the way to keep you zippy and encouraged. Take on this incredible 50K Michaux tour this Fall!!\n\n20 Miler\n\nOur 20-mile course follows the exact first 19.7miles of the 50K course, scrambling over sandstone boulders, cruising through woodland savannah, and flowing along rhododendron-lined creeksides. We will guide you (via fantastic course marking) through this fantastic section of the Michaux using primarily single-track trail interspersed with occasional grassy double-track (and less than 2.5 miles total of gravel or asphalt road). Four kick-butt aid stations will be distributed along the way to keep you feeling zippy and encouraged. A truly fantastic way to spend an autumn morning!\n\n15K\n\nSign yourself up for a journey through the rugged beauty of the northern Michaux State Forest with our moderate 15K course, a friendly blend of flow and challenge.
