        "text": "2\n\nOre, Fuel, and Other Natural Resources\n\nArtisans at an ironworks fed ore, fuel, flux, and air into their furnaces. They used waterwheels or turbines to power blowing engines and rolling mills, and flowing water to cool furnaces. They needed refractory bricks, stone, and sand. Coal, limestone, and iron ore (except bog ore) were nonrenewable natural resources: once consumed, they were gone forever. However, an ironmaster could regrow wood suitable for making charcoal in twenty to thirty years. When he took water from a stream for power and for cooling his furnaces, he returned it to the stream warmer and at a lower elevation but available to the next user downstream. Air was free to all. Until the 1840s most ironmakers got power from wood and water, the renewable energy resources. Thereafter, they turned increasingly to mineral coal because of the high cost of cutting, hauling, and coaling wood, and the convenience of steam power.\n\nIRON ORE\n\nAlthough some people without access to good ores successfully smelted iron-containing soils,1 ironmasters sought to minimize their expenditure of energy and labor by smelting rich ore. Americans often believed that possession of particular ores or fuels would make them wealthy. Most of these believers learned the hard way that they needed skill coupled with close, thoughtful supervision of every detail of their technique as much as they needed a specific natural resource.\n\nIron ore contained one or more of the iron oxide minerals hematite (Fe2O3), magnetite (Fe3O4), and siderite (FeCO3) or the hydrated forms of iron oxide, goethite or limonite, along with minerals (called gangue) that did not yield iron. Because these ores were abundant, ironmakers never smelted iron sulfide minerals, such as pyrite (FeS2), and so did not cause the environmental degradation from sulfur-laden emissions that accompanied production of metals such as copper or lead from sulfide ores. Miners drilled and blasted to extract the iron ores they found in veins or pods within hard rock. Ore formed by burial of rock weathered at the earth’s surface made layered deposits that miners could dig in open pits. They could simply scoop up the ore that formed on the bottoms of bogs. There were few places in North America where some form of iron ore could not be found nearby.\n\nUp-welling iron-rich groundwater precipitated bog ore in wetlands with the aid of certain bacteria. Colonial ironworkers found bog ore particularly easy to use. They called newly formed crusts of iron oxide “loam ore”; it was relatively low grade. Left undisturbed, loam ore consolidated into “seed ore” containing about 45 percent iron and eventually into “massive ore” containing up to 53 percent iron. Bog ore renewed itself after mining. Typically, groundwater flowing into a bog made enough ore to be worth harvesting within about twenty years. Wetlands provided a continuous supply of ore when the harvesting rate was kept below the replacement rate.2 An observer in Massachusetts, Doctor Forbes, noticed in 1793 that artisans at the Raynham forge had been harvesting ore from an adjacent pond for eighty years with little evidence of diminution of the supply. Forbes thought that “the time may come when it will be as easy to raise a bed of bog ore as a bed of carrots.”3 Proprietors of forges and furnaces in coastal New Jersey and Maryland sustained their works on bog ore until competition from lower priced iron smelted with mineral coal in Pennsylvania put them out of business in the 1840s. Because most of the deposits were under water, digging bog ore left few traces other than small waterways made for the ore boats.4\n\nOther early ironmakers dug ore from shallow pits or in small openings they made in mineral veins. Some managed to use mines along the routes their wagons followed as they returned from delivering finished iron, thereby reducing their transportation costs. Initially, miners dug the ore by hand (Fig. 2-1). As they made their pits deeper, they constructed switchback roads for teams to draw the ore out in wagons. Later, they adopted scrapers pulled by cables wound on winches. When they reached depths of about a hundred feet, they drove carefully timbered slopes into the ore and used pumps to keep the water level down. When they ceased mining and stopped the pumps, the pits filled. In the Salisbury ironmaking district in Connecticut, the mines are now lakes surrounded by woodland and carefully tended lawns.\n\nThe operators of the anthracite-fired furnaces in eastern Pennsylvania needed more ore than did the proprietors of the older charcoal-fired furnaces. They found it in layers resting on the sandstones that made up the ridges in the area. Additionally, farmers discovered pods of ore above the limestones that underlay the Lehigh Valley at depths down to a hundred feet. Some turned to mining in preference to farming and opened ore pits on their land. As they dug deeper, they constructed drifts, slopes, and shafts. Mines and washeries dotted the Lehigh Valley landscape through the last sixty years of the nineteenth century. Ore hauling made an even bigger impact on the environment than mining. Few of the numerous mines were near a railroad, so mine operators had to haul their ore in wagons along dirt roads that were inadequate for this heavy traffic. “Ore for the furnaces was hauled by heavy teams from various mines throughout the County. A line of teams nearly a mile in length was a customary sight. During rainy seasons, the ore roads’ became well nigh impassable.”5\n\nBlast furnace operators in eastern Pennsylvania got much of the magnetite they blended with the local limonite ores from mines in New Jersey and the Adirondacks by canal or later by railway. Miners dug magnetite in underground, hard-rock mines (Fig. 2-2). Usually, little surface evidence remains from this kind of iron mining: the mine remains in the Ramapo hills of New Jersey consist of some cuts on hillsides where miners dug out veins of magnetite along with openings, many now sealed, to underground workings. Ironworkers began taking magnetite ore at the Mount Hope mine in Morris County, New Jersey, about 1710 and continued to work it until 1959. They sent their greatest production in the mid-nineteenth century to the new anthracite furnaces in eastern Pennsylvania.6\n\nAfter mid-century, ironmasters west of the Appalachians brought ore from northern Michigan by boat to ports on the lower lakes and then by rail to their furnaces. The large scale of open-pit iron mining west of the Appalachians is visible along Minnesota’s iron ranges. Lumber and wheat merchants developed the port of Duluth at the head of Lake Superior between 1850 and 1870. Explorers found the ores of the nearby Vermilion Range in the 1870s, and state geologist Newton H. Winchell made a thorough exploration in 1878. The Minnesota Mining Company, organized in 1882, built a railroad to Two Harbors and had ore production under way by 1882. In 1889 the Merritt brothers began exploring the Mesabi Range, where they found soft, rich ore in 1890. Following an ore rush in 1892, capitalists invested in large-scale mining and shipping facilities to move the ore to ports on the lower lakes. Lumbermen had already cut over the Mesabi before miners began taking out ore. Edmund J. Longyear, who in 1890 did the first exploratory drilling in the Mesabi, remembered how “old choppings, windfalls, fires, underbrush, and swamps … combined to make the scene a desolate one … Both white and red, or Norway, pines of majestic proportions as well as considerable hardwood, covered the area. I remember seeing deer, partridge, and one moose on our trip. I am glad I saw those beautiful trees before they vanished. For anyone who knows the modern appearance of the Mesabi Range, it would be impossible to form a true mental picture of the original … Few areas of the United States have been so completely altered by man.”7\n\nNear Hibbing, the Hull-Rust mine is now a hole 1 mile wide and nearly 4 miles long reaching down 535 feet. Waste dumps surround much of Hibbing. All this waste would hardly begin to fill the pit if it were put back: artisans in Pennsylvania and Ohio converted most of the excavated material to iron and slag long ago. According to one observer, residents of the area have developed a strange affection for the great, abandoned, open pits of the Iron Range, seeing them as manmade Grand Canyons, aweinspiring because of their size.8\n\nAs educated individuals turned their attention to the application of science to economic development in the early nineteenth century, some of them convinced their state legislatures to appropriate money for geological surveys intended to find economically useful mineral resources. College professor Denison Olmsted suggested such a survey to the North Carolina legislature in 1821. In 1823, probably prompted by the importance of gold mining in their state, the legislators made a small appropriation for Olmsted’s expenses while he spent his summer vacations perambulating the state. Olmsted resigned his position in 1825 to become a professor at Yale, and Elisha Mitchell carried on the survey. Many state legislators imagined that geological surveys would yield economic benefits within a year of two. In North Carolina they voted to cut off funds when the surveyors produced geological descriptions rather than maps of new ore bodies.9 Tennessee appointed Gerard Troost as its state geologist in 1831.10 Virginia started its geological survey with Professor W. B. Rogers of William and Mary College in 1835. He visited many of the ironworks in the state and remarked on the need for artisans to apply science in their work.11 In Kentucky, the governor appointed William W. Mather state geologist; he concentrated his first year’s work on coal and iron resources.12 In South Carolina, Michael Tuomey began the geological survey in 1844, concentrating on economic resources.13\n\nStarting in 1836, Henry D. Rogers and a small band of enthusiastic young geologists undertook the first geological survey of Pennsylvania. As had happened earlier in North Carolina, the legislative sponsors of the survey were disappointed when Rogers’s work did not yield immediate economic benefits. They cut off support for the survey in 1841. Although Rogers later worked as a consultant for mining enterprises, he found more scope for his talents when he emigrated to Britain. Years later the Pennsylvania legislature appropriated funds for publication of Rogers’s report.14\n\nIn a narrow sense the legislators in North Carolina and Pennsylvania were right: where the land had already been explored by prospectors, the early surveys yielded little economically useful information. However, state geologists made major discoveries later, notably in Michigan and Minnesota, where they located many of the large iron ore deposits around Lake Superior.\n\nORE MILLING\n\nIdeally, the miners would send only iron minerals to the surface. However, the ore veins always contained gangue as well. The artisan who smelted the ore had both to reduce the iron mineral to metal and to free it from the gangue, usually by converting the gangue to liquid slag that would flow away from the metal. Because a lot of thermal energy was needed to make slag, ironmasters preferred to mechanically remove as much gangue from the ore as they could before smelting it. They did this at ore separators, placed as close to the mine as possible to avoid the cost of hauling waste to the smelter. Separator hands crushed and washed the ore—or, if it contained magnetite, passed it over magnets—to extract the iron minerals.15 Artisans at the smelter then roasted the ore in an open wood fire or in kilns to remove water and increase the surface on which smelting reactions could take place.16\n\nWhen iron ore gangue consisted of rock-forming minerals, such as quartz or feldspar, the sandy separator waste was similar to the sand left by deep weathering or glacial erosion. At the separators used by bloomery forge operators, this waste washed into streams and was carried away by floods. Few traces of it can be found today. However, where ironmasters beneficiated ores for blast furnaces, they sometimes made such large volumes of sandy waste that natural processes could not disperse it (Fig. 2-3).\n\nMuch of the ore miners dug in eastern Pennsylvania was surrounded by clay, some of which the miners brought up with the ore. To improve this ore enough that ironmasters would buy it, mine owners built washeries to flush off the clay. They usually ran the clay-rich wastewater into old mine pits. When grassed over, the pits filled this way are hardly recognizable as mining remains. However, Pennsylvania homeowners digging in their back yards often encounter dense layers of clay left from hundred-year-old mining operations.17 Great Lakes shipping firms began delivering ore from mines in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula to blast furnace proprietors in western Pennsylvania and northern Ohio in the 1850s. Many of these ores were so rich that furnace operators could smelt them without further preparation.18\n\nCHARCOAL FUEL\n\nIronmasters counted fuel one of their greatest costs, and they worked to reduce its consumption by smelting rich ores (so that they would have to heat and slag less gangue) and using large furnaces (where heat losses were smaller).19 American ironmasters used charcoal, anthracite, bituminous coal, and coke. They had to use charcoal in bloomery and finery forges because the sulfur in mineral coal contaminated the metal. Proprietors of blast furnaces and puddling works made their choices on the basis of the cost of the alternative fuels. They could not use wood for smelting because it would not burn hot enough, but they could fire reverberatory furnaces with it. An ironmaster got about twice as much heat from charcoal as from the same weight of wood. Additionally, the porous charcoal burned faster than either wood or mineral coal.\n\nAt a charcoal-fired forge or blast furnace, more people worked at making fuel than at any other task. At Clifton Forge in Virginia, a finery that converted pig iron to bar iron, thirty-two of the fifty-one slaves working in 1831 made charcoal: twenty-two chopped wood, three hauled it, and seven coaled it. Four slaves fined iron.20\n\nIronmasters used both hardwood and softwood charcoal. They held varying opinions about the merits of different kinds of wood. The woodland owned by the Kingdom bloomery forge in the New York Adirondacks included hemlock, birch, beech, and maple. Artisans there believed that although smelting with a mixture of hardwood and softwood charcoal ran slower, it yielded better iron than smelting with charcoal from hardwood alone.21 Connecticut blast furnace operators, however, preferred charcoal made of oak and chestnut, avoiding hemlock because of its low density.22\n\nColliers made charcoal, which contained about 90 percent carbon,23 by heating wood in an enclosure that limited access of air to the fire. The heat drove off or ignited volatile constituents, leaving a mixture of porous carbon and ash. Until the mid-nineteenth century, most European and American colliers made charcoal in a pit (also known as a meiler), a pile of wood covered with sod and charcoal dust. Starting about 1850, many colliers adopted stone or brick kilns. In the late nineteenth century, they began to collect the products of combustion for use in making chemicals such as methanol.\n\nMost Americans knew how to fell trees and haul them out of the woods. Relatively few were good colliers, and they commanded some of the highest wages at an ironworks. In the winter, axemen clearcut woodland, chopped the logs to 4-foot lengths, split larger logs so that no piece was thicker than 6 inches, and stacked the wood to dry. A collier preferred to work in the dry, windless weather of summer. He selected a spot protected from the wind with level ground and dry soil, where he could lay out a circle 30–50 feet in diameter, called a hearth. The hearth was covered with split wood, a layer of bark or moss, and a layer of sandy clay. As the wood haulers brought in the cordwood, the collier and his helpers built the pit by first placing wood around the perimeter of the hearth, erecting a chimney in the center, and then tightly packing in twenty-five to thirty cords of logs (Fig. 2-4). Connecticut colliers preferred to mix logs as small as 2 inches diameter with the larger billets in the pit to promote more even burning.24 The collier covered the pit with lapwood (small, dried branches) and sealed it with wet leaves, earth, and charcoal dust or turf with the grass side inward. The seal prevented air from entering except at openings made by the collier and retained heat. The collier had to get the thickness of the cover just right; if he made it too thin, the fire would break through and set the entire pit aflame; if it were too thick, an explosion of trapped gas could destroy the pit.\n\nOnce he had the pit fired (Fig. 2-5), the collier, aided by his helpers, watched it almost constantly during the two weeks or so it took to convert the wood to charcoal. In the first, or “sweating,” stage, they allowed the water that condensed inside the cover to escape by opening a small band near the base of the pit; they also vented the upper part of the pit to prevent steam explosions. When the sweating stage was over, the collier covered the band and left the pile for three to four days while the internal heat began to carbonize the wood. Next, he opened a ring of vents about halfway up the pit. The yellow-gray smoke from these gradually turned bluish. The color change indicated the degree of carbonization of the wood. When carbonization was complete at the level of the vents, the collier made another ring of holes lower down, repeating the process until all the wood was carbonized. He wanted combustion to travel uniformly from the top downward and outward toward the edges of the pit. As the moisture and volatiles left, the pit shrank to about one-third of its initial size. To keep the shrinkage uniform, the collier walked gingerly over the pit feeling for soft spots. By jumping gently on the cover (being careful not to break through), he shifted charring wood into any voids that had developed.25\n\nWhen the collier and his helpers raked the completed charcoal from the pit, they placed it in small piles, well separated to limit their loss if a pile ignited. Charcoal held fire a long time and might burst into flame while in a wagon on its way to an ironworks. Teamsters carried a bucket and shovel to douse any fire that broke out, but they sometimes had to abandon a load of burning charcoal along the road. Later, when ironmasters began to bring in charcoal from distant producers by rail, they sometimes lost entire carloads to fire.\n\nA collier with one or two helpers, living in small huts near the coaling grounds, tended a half-dozen or more pits. Archaeologists have located the sites of fifty-seven charcoal pits on Maryland Heights, the mountain across the Potomac River from Harpers Ferry, West Virginia.26 They were usually placed on the uphill side of roads to make transfer of the charcoal to wagons easier. Colliers working these pits supplied the Antietam Ironworks, eleven miles up the Potomac. Archaeologists at the Hopewell Village furnace site in Pennsylvania found the remains of pits arranged in circles of about 400-foot radius around the sites of colliers’ huts.27\n\nIn a busy year artisans at the Maramec Iron Works in Missouri used 650,000 bushels of charcoal made from more than 16,000 cords of wood in their blast furnace and finery hearths. Fourteen master colliers took contracts arranged to begin at two-week intervals for delivery of 400–600 bushels of charcoal per day. Each collier then had to organize a work force of five or more helpers, and each needed to have at least three pits in successive stages of carbonization at any time. Colliers who managed their work well made good money. In 1869 Jon Lawrence had a gross income of $3,008 and a net of $550 for eight months’ work. In the same year, however, Tim Gorman, through fires and poor judgment, had a net loss of $87 on his gross of $2,459.28\n\nAfter the 1850s, ironmasters who depended on charcoal fuel needed innovations in fuel production as much as in furnace operation. They found it difficult to recruit skilled colliers, and the colliers’ products were of variable quality. There was room for improved performance: as late as 1880 Americans got on average about 35 bushels per cord of wood from their charcoal pits, while Swedish colliers got as much as 59 bushels per cord.29 First, some ironmasters adopted kilns in place of pits. They built brick or stone ovens fitted with charging holes at the tops, doors at the sides, and vents around the perimeters; each would hold up to 75 cords of wood (Fig. 2-6). A collier and his helpers stacked wood in the kiln according to a regular pattern and, after the wood was fired, sealed the charging hole and door. As at a pit, they had to watch the kiln closely, adjusting the vents as wind conditions changed and carbonization progressed. The skills they needed were much the same, but they could exercise closer control over kilns than over pits. They increased their average yield to 45 bushels per cord and got a more uniform product. Some colliers experimented with heating apparatus outside their kilns and obtained a better yield.30 Ironmasters with large furnaces to fuel had lots of kilns: at the Pioneer blast furnaces in Gladstone, Michigan, in 1882, colliers worked eighty-seven beehive kilns to make 180,000 bushels of charcoal a month.31 Bloom smelters in the Adirondacks preferred kiln-made charcoal because it was free of dirt that would have added to the volume of slag formed in their hearths.32\n\nAlthough colliers could make better charcoal with kilns than with pits, they still lost the products of combustion. That situation changed by the 1880s. As early as 1830, James Ward had begun to manufacture pyroligneous acid by distillation of wood in North Adams, Massachusetts, by means of a technique first used near Glasgow, Scotland, in 1796. American entrepreneurs first established a successful wood distillation industry in 1852, at Milburn, New York. By heating the wood in iron retorts 9 feet long and 42 inches in diameter with condensers attached, they obtained 52 bushels of fully carbonized charcoal and the stock to make 216 pounds of 80 percent acetate of lime and 11 gallons of 80 percent wood alcohol from 1 cord of wood.33\n\nJ. A. Mathieu began experimenting with carbonization in retorts in 1861. He tried vessels made of various materials and in different attitudes before he found a satisfactory design. He reported charcoal yields of 66 bushels per cord with his first installation at an ironworks (the Gere Iron and Mining Company of Port Leyden, New York). Mathieu burned the gas released in the retorts once the decomposition of the wood was under way, obtaining enough heat to sustain the reaction. Because the resulting charcoal was denser than that made in pits, Gere’s founder could increase the air pressure in his blast furnace 16 percent and his furnace burden by 25 percent. In 1882 the managers of the Newberry furnace in Michigan realized $9.70 for pig, $5.50 for methanol, and $3.50 for acetate of lime for every cord of wood they carbonized.34\n\nIn their enthusiasm to cut fuel costs, other ironworks managers invested in Mathieu’s retorts. Some encountered difficulties. J. A. McArthur of the Shelby Iron Co. in Alabama complained of excessive initial and operating costs. Mathieu discovered that the Shelby colliers were attempting to convert wood the same day it was cut, while still excessively wet. W. R. Davenport of the Martel furnace in Michigan claimed he could not get enough gas to keep the retorts hot. Mathieu found that his recently arrived Swedish and Polish workers, unable to understand English, could not operate the equipment.35\n\nDistillation made charcoal strong enough to be easily shipped by rail. Ironmasters began buying charcoal from producers up to 300 miles away as an alternative to paying higher prices for locally produced fuel. With imported fuel, owners of furnaces near cities where the woodland had been built over could remain in business. To encourage this trade, railroads designed special cars for carrying charcoal. They found that while a 330-mile journey decreased the volume of the loaded coal by 16 percent due to closer packing, the loss due to pulverization was less than 0.1 percent.36\n\nAs the members of the Association of Charcoal Iron Workers rode their special train along the Ohio River into the Hanging Rock district in 1881, they had to pass several blast furnaces operating on mineral coal. They were pleased to reach the Monroe furnace, where “the odor of charcoal pits was immediately recognized.” Other observers were more likely to mention dark, heavy, disagreeable smoke. Because of these effluents, many Pennsylvania boroughs prohibited coaling within their borders. Mathieu, in advancing his plans for making charcoal in retorts, noted that when colliers operated kilns near offices and dwellings, the occupants found the pungency of the smoke and fumes so objectionable that they often took steps to force the colliers to move away.37\n\nIndividuals visiting the Adirondacks in the tours that became popular in the 1870s remarked on the dirt they found in the ironmaking communities. At Black Brook, site of a large bloomery forge,\n\neverything was black and dusty. Smelting furnaces emitted dense volumes of smoke. Huge charcoal vans and loads of iron ore constantly passed. The road for miles was lined with the huts and cabins of the employees, populous with smutty faced children. Away off on the bare hills thin columns of smoke told where the miners were delving into the bowels of the earth. Slag and iron filings paved the thoroughfares. Coal dust filled every chink and crevice. It settled thickly upon the trees, and when it rained the leaves shed rivulets of ink.38\n\nThis writer appears to have mistaken smoke from charcoal kilns as evidence of mining and probably exaggerated the amount of smoke from the bloomery hearths. Modern experimenters working with reproductions of bloomery hearths find little release of smoke except when they add fresh charcoal to the fire. Other observers confirm the pervasiveness of charcoal dust at ironworks. The Greenwood No. 1 blast furnace in Orange County, New York, smelted the iron used for the Parrot cannon made at the famous Cold Spring Foundry across the Hudson River. According to Richard Parrot,\n\na visitor would have pointed out features of the place that the inhabitants overlooked as being commonplace. He would have said that much of the charcoal escaped being fed into the furnace for it was being wafted about in clouds of dust settling on everything that couldn’t get out of the way—including the face of the visitor. By nature the local color was green, but artificially black was a good second and more generally worn.39\n\nUnlike smoke, charcoal dust settled quickly enough not to be dispersed much beyond the ironworks or the roads used by the colliers.\n\nA typical mid-nineteenth-century blast furnace, the Buena Vista in Connecticut, each year burned 356,000 bushels of charcoal, made from 11,900 cords of wood, in 475 meilers. Since the average forest yield here was 20 cords per acre, the proprietors cut about 600 acres a year. They maintained a continuous wood supply by cutting 12,000 acres in a twenty-year rotation.40 Some works held even larger acreages: Principio in Maryland had 30,000 in 1751, the Weymouth blast furnace and forge in New Jersey had 76,000 in 1801, and Monroe furnace in Ohio had 19,300 in 1881.41 However, some ironmasters gave little thought to sustaining their wood supply. The eighteenth-century proprietors of the Union blast furnace in New Jersey destroyed a forest of nearly 20,000 acres in less than fifteen years and then abandoned their investment for want of wood.42 In 1783 Samuel Hermelin noted that, because of heavy demand in south-central Pennsylvania, ironmasters could get little charcoal or timber except by buying land. Some had sufficient land so that, through careful management, they could sustain production with second-growth timber. Others abandoned their blast furnaces and forges, either because they did not want to undertake the management of extensive woodlands or because they could not raise the capital to buy sufficient acreage.43 In the eighteenth century it was relatively easy for an ironmaster to move to a new area with abundant forests.\n\nAfter the 1840s ironmasters using wood or charcoal fuel found that they had to minimize their fuel costs to retain their markets in the face of competition from users of mineral fuel. Some, such as the operators of the blast furnaces in the New River area of southwestern Virginia, had abundant woods to cut and took little interest in reforestation, perhaps realizing that with their old furnaces and scarce capital, they were unlikely to need a continuing supply of fuel.44 To minimize their fuel costs, progressive ironmasters adopted new techniques that allowed them to use their forest lands most efficiently. They could often make significant savings through small changes in traditional practices. The proprietors of the Shelby works in Alabama, by insisting that their woodcutters cut close to the ground with saws rather than axes, saved the 20 percent of the coaling wood they had previously lost in chips and stumps. To further increase yield, they made their charcoal in kilns rather than in pits.45\n\nEfficient resource use alone could not always assure a continued supply of wood at competitive prices. Some ironmasters, such as those operating furnaces around Baltimore Harbor, depended on wood merchants to find and deliver low-cost wood to them for coaling.46 Most proprietors, however, had to choose between acquiring and managing woodland for sustained yield and using up the nearby woods and then importing charcoal. In Michigan, where investors put substantial capital into modern, charcoal-fired blast furnaces after 1870, the managers of those facilities clearcut the land farther and farther away from the ironworks and then sold the cutover land as farm acreage. According to Alexander Maitland, manager of the Jackson Iron Company’s furnaces at Fayette, Michigan, the proprietors originally owned 12,500 acres of forest. They sold it off for farms as they cut it over because, he explained, “the second-growth timber … is valueless for furnace purposes so we sell the land as soon as possible after removing the first crop. The second-growth timber comes up very thick, and grows fast, and soon adds materially to the difficulty and cost of preparing for cultivation.”47 Michigan ironmasters had found that they could bring in charcoal by rail at an acceptable cost and so could buy from distant suppliers rather than adding management of woodlands to their tasks. The settlers who bought the cutover land usually found it had little agricultural value.48\n\nThe pioneer salt boilers, the first Europeans to occupy southeastern Ohio, wantonly destroyed much of the region’s forest and game. The settlers who followed them burned more forest as they began farming. Then, between 1836 and 1855, the proprietors of sixteen blast furnaces acquired altogether 71,000 acres in Vinton and Jackson Counties. They clearcut trees in the winter and gathered and coaled the logs the following spring and summer (Fig. 2-7). Colliers, unlike lumbermen, used the limbs and brush, leaving the coaled lands “in as good condition for regeneration as a forester could wish … Fire was carefully kept out, at least until the completion of coaling. As a result the new growth on these lands was vigorous.”49 Not all Ohio ironmasters followed the same plan. Some sold off their cutover land and then purchased a larger proportion of their charcoal, thereby creating a market for a cash crop that farmers who had poor soil could raise. However, most ironmasters held at least several thousand acres of forest.50\n\nMany proprietors of long-established works, or of works with large, modern furnaces, managed their woodlands to yield a continuous supply of fuel. They usually belonged to the charcoal ironworkers association. The editor of the organization’s journal, John Birkinbine, and many of his contributors wrote regularly about the need to preserve and manage forest land. In his first issue, Birkinbine noted that unlike sawmill proprietors, who cut and moved on, ironworks managers devoted resources to reforestation and so contributed to the general welfare by maintaining forest land. The association promoted both efficient use of wood and sustained production from forests:\n\nThe great consumers of charcoal are iron works, which are established as permanent industries … With the exception of a few districts, the fuel supply is usually made permanent by the proprietors of iron works securing sufficient woodland to insure this end, and the reproduction of forest growth is one of the duties of management. Therefore, while in one sense charcoal iron works are destroyers of forests, in another sense they are conservators of them. [They] more than any other one industry [are] the protectors of forests.51\n\nPopular writers of the day often failed to appreciate this conservation effort, seeing instead the immediate effects of timber harvesting and coaling. A tourist in the Adirondacks in 1889, J. Osgood, wrote that “along the line of the Chateaugay the timber has been ruthlessly burnt and cut off; the charcoal burners have devastated the region and their poor huts are to the lover of woodland scenery anything but compensation for the giants of the forest.”52 In fact, Osgood and his companion found plenty of woodland, most of it second growth. Birkinbine’s editorial comments show that Osgood’s attitude toward the colliers was common and that the public associated charcoaling with forest destruction, making it a matter of much popular concern. Birkinbine repeatedly explained the role of ironworkers as conservators of woodland.53 Today we know that nationally, the clearing of land for agriculture and lumbering was responsible for 99 percent of the consumption of forest land.54 The overall impact of ironmaking on American forests was slight.\n\nSome ironworkers held a romantic view of their industry. George Wiestling, manager of the Mont Alto Iron Company in Pennsylvania, observed of ironworkers that “their work carries them to the mountain top where the dignified pine stretches out its lofty branches to the sky … my associates have learned to love the beautiful.”55 The Mont Alto works had 20,200 acres, a blast furnace, a forge with modern equipment, and seven farms. Wiestling was ready to call out the ironworks staff to fight forest fires when needed. In the same area, the South Mountain Mining and Ore Company had the Pine Grove furnace, a forge, farms, and 27,000 acres of woodland. Both ironworks accommodated picnic parties that arrived by railroad. Members of the charcoal ironworkers’ association also liked to point out that mineral coal was an exhaustible resource while their fuel supply could continue indefinitely; they cited examples of furnaces that had operated in Pennsylvania for over a hundred years and retained stocks of 12-inch timber in the adjacent woods.56\n\nBirkinbine promoted the cause of forest management by running articles by Franklin Hough and Eduard Fernow. Hough, a medical doctor with an interest in botany, became chief of the Forestry Division of the Bureau of Agriculture in 1876. He worked to find common interests between forest users and preservationists.57 Hough also wrote about the need to manage woodlands for sustained production and to provide schools to teach forestry.58 Fernow, a German forester, took over as chief of the Division of Forestry in 1886. He contributed a series of papers on different aspects of woodland management to the charcoal ironworkers’ journal between 1881 and 1883 as part of his campaign for the efficient industrial use of wood.59\n\nThe charcoal ironworkers’ association had more than 200 members through the 1880s. Although their furnaces made only about 10 percent of the iron produced in the United States at that time, they controlled more land than any other segment of the American iron industry. In the early 1880s they focused many of their conference papers and discussions on fuel supplies and forest management. Later they gave more attention to metallurgical problems. At this time customers continued to buy charcoal-smelted pigs and blooms because they were familiar, high-quality products with established reputations at a time when users did not yet have full confidence in steel. Metallurgists improved their understanding of steel through the 1880s, and more customers adopted it. As this happened, the charcoal ironworkers found retention of a market share for their high-priced product a more pressing problem than fuel supply. They could get all the wood they needed, but they could not overcome the high labor cost of preparing charcoal. As they gradually lost their share of the market, ironmaking lost the romanticism of individuals like Wiestling and the vision of sustained management of woodland for industrial use.\n\nAs the charcoal ironworkers closed their furnaces, new owners often found uses for their properties that preserved the forest land. A fishing club took over the woodland belonging to the Buena Vista furnace in Connecticut and allowed the forest to regrow undisturbed. This land had been coppiced up to six times. After each cutting, pioneer hardwood (pin cherry, gray birch, quaking aspen) invaded. Over the long term, coppicing favored species such as red maple, oak, and chestnut, which sprouted vigorously.60\n\nIn 1877 the Adirondack Club, the first fishing and hunting club in the region, obtained a long-term lease on the 105,000 acres held by the proprietors of the Adirondack ironworks at Tahawus.61 They used the woods and streams until wartime demand for titanium in the 1940s led the U.S. government to reopen the Tahawus mine. In the late twentieth century new owners are redeveloping Tahawus for vacation homes. Pennsylvania made the woodlands of the Pine Grove and Mont Alto furnaces into state parks. In Ohio the federal and state governments acquired many ironworks’ woodlands in the 1930s, forming the Zaleski Forest, formerly belonging to the Hope and Zaleski furnaces; the Raccoon Creek Forest of 5,400 acres, which had been used by the Hamden and Vinton furnace proprietors; and Richland Furnace State Forest.62 The various public and private forest reserves are the largest survivals of the nineteenth-century American iron industry today.\n\nCOAL FUEL\n\nOnce they had learned the necessary combustion techniques, ironmasters could use either bituminous coal, which contained 70–90 percent carbon, or anthracite, which could have as much as 95 percent carbon. All these coals contained sulfur, some as much as 2.5 percent. Coals from different seams and districts varied in their properties. Those that released a strong flow of combustible gas and burned with a long flame were easiest to use in reverberatory furnaces, where the firebox was separated from the hearth. Anthracite burned with a particularly short flame. Caking coals tended to fuse when heated; free-burning coal did not cake, and when burned, the bed of coals remained open enough for air to pass through freely. Bituminous coal, found near Richmond, Virginia, and west of the Appalachians, contained more volatiles and generally more sulfur than anthracite and was easier to burn. Coal from the Pittsburgh seam in southwestern Pennsylvania made particularly good metallurgical coke.\n\nAmericans found plenty of coal but, unlike iron ore, only in particular places. However, because of its high energy content per unit weight and mechanical strength, mineral coal cost much less to transport than its energy equivalent in wood. Virginians mined bituminous coal from the fields along the James River west of Richmond and shipped it to East Coast ports in the eighteenth century. When the Royal Navy cut this trade during the War of 1812, Richmond merchants could not supply customers in eastern Pennsylvania. Nor could these Pennsylvanians get coal from the large bituminous deposits west of the Appalachians until a railway connected Philadelphia to Pittsburgh in 1852. However, they had anthracite in four coal basins in eastern Pennsylvania. When adventurers opened routes into the anthracite fields and began mining in the late 1820s, Pennsylvania innovators began a determined effort to use anthracite in ironmaking. In the next decade they succeeded, first with puddling and then with blast furnace smelting. From 1855 to 1875, Americans made more iron with anthracite than any other fuel.63 Thereafter, they relied primarily on bituminous coal from the large deposits west of the Appalachians.\n\nBecause they had such large coal resources, American miners could easily dig as much as customers wanted. They used the newly constructed canals and later railways to deliver coal reliably and economically to ironworks far removed from the mines (Fig. 2-8). Freed of the constraints on location imposed by dependence on energy derived from wood or flowing water, ironmasters who adopted coal fuel no longer had to use small furnaces and forges dispersed along waterways in the woods. They could put concentrations of blast furnaces and rolling mills along canals in cities (Fig. 2-9), leaving to others the problems of supplying the housing and community services needed by the artisans. With mineral coal, ironmasters released themselves from the limits on growth imposed by dependence on renewable fuels and from the need to schedule work around power sources, such as flowing water, that waxed and waned with the seasons. They avoided the continuing burdens of managing woodland and watersheds and maintaining dams and ponds. Instead, they ordered coal from dealers as they needed it and stored as large a reserve as they considered prudent.\n\nWhen they used charcoal, ironmasters had the environmental effects of producing their fuel right at hand. With mineral coal as fuel, they shifted the environmental consequences of obtaining energy to the mining districts and transportation routes. At first, canal boats delivered the coal. Canal builders made long, linear alterations in the landscape (Fig. 2-8). In making their water-filled channels, canal builders created barriers, like interstate highways today, that people could cross only where engineers provided bridges. Canals altered local water supplies and drainage, and when embankments broke, they flooded neighboring land. Proprietors frequently failed to adequately compensate neighboring property owners for the losses they suffered from canal construction. Although railroads mitigated some of these effects, they created new hazards for farm animals, depleted timber supplies, and often started fires along their tracks until they switched to coal fuel, after which time they rained cinders on their neighbors. Rail routes through cities and towns disrupted established street patterns or, if elevated, overshadowed existing buildings (Fig. 2-10).64\n\nMore serious than the environmental costs of transportation systems were the consequences of coal extraction borne by miners and their communities. The environmental and social degradation that accompanied coal mining took place in valleys and basins enclosed by mountains, putting it effectively out of sight and out of mind for most coal users. Inexperienced adventurers in the coal lands who aimed at extracting coal with as little investment as possible created the system of mining adopted by American mine owners. Owners and their agents offered few incentives for either managers or miners to devote resources to safe operation. Mine operators minimized their investment in ventilation systems and escape routes. Miners, working as inside contractors and paid only for the coal they brought to the surface, had to make their own decisions on how much time to spend putting up roof supports. As a result, many of them skimped on such precautions, and roof falls—a more serious problem than the spectacular fires and explosions newspaper editors wrote about—killed and injured miners day in and day out.65 While developing a rapidly increasing supply of inexpensive coal, mine owners and their agents established mining practices and attitudes toward stewardship of the land that proved to be enduring and costly.\n\nMine operators clearcut the surrounding land for mine timber. They dumped “culm,” fine particles of shale and coal waste, on the closest available open space or into adjacent streams (Fig. 2-11). Contact with sulfur in the coal turned water flowing through culm or draining out of the mines into dilute sulfuric acid that destroyed both plant and animal life in the rivers it entered. Although miners had plenty of coal left to dig, the industry declined in the twentieth century as coal customers found petroleum a more convenient and economical fuel. The environmental consequences of past mining persist, however. Old culm piles support only a sparse cover of stunted vegetation. Streams remain acidified by water draining from old workings. Fires in coal left in the parts of abandoned mines above the water table continue to burn, releasing carbon monoxide. The environmental costs of the cheap coal enjoyed by Americans in the past remain to be paid today.\n\nCOKE\n\nGentle heating drove off the volatile constituents of bituminous coal. Some coals then formed a pasty mass that, when cooled, became coke, lumps of porous carbon. English brewers had been using coke fires for drying malt when Abraham Darby tried it as blast furnace fuel shortly after 1708.66 English ironmasters made coke by partially burning piles of coal that they built around a brick chimney and covered with coke dust. The heat from the fire drove out the volatiles and in four to six days produced lumps of porous, nearly pure carbon. Initially, Americans made coke this way too. A coke burner stacked the coal into long piles about 14 feet wide containing flues filled with dry wood to help diffuse the fire and then banked up the pile with coke dust. He chose the thickness of the cover to control the burn rate. In three to five days after firing, the heat expelled the gaseous matter in the coal, the flame disappeared, and the coke burner covered the pile with wet coke dust and left it for several days. To smother the fire, he poured water down the flues so that the resultant steam extinguished the flame. He could made 60 tons of coke from 100 tons of coal, and he could control its density and strength by adjusting the burn rate.67\n\nIn about 1843 mine operators in Fayette County, Pennsylvania, began to make coke in beehive ovens instead of open heaps (Fig. 2-12); they continued to use the technique well into the twentieth century.68 They built their ovens in long banks, sometimes into a hillside, and often in double rows with a track between for a lorry to carry coal to the ovens. The lorry driver had to load an oven within a half-hour after the previous charge was drawn so that there would be enough retained heat to ignite the coal. He poured coal through the opening at the top of the oven (the tunnel head) and knew from experience, without measurement, how much to put in for a forty-eight-hour burn (to make blast furnace coke) or seventy-two-hour burn (for foundry coke). The coke burner, working on the platform in front of the ovens, then leveled the coal by hand using a large rake and bricked up the door, leaving an opening at the top to admit air. Within half an hour the temperature of the coal would reach 600–1,200°F from the heat retained in the oven walls, and the gas driven out of the coal would ignite. It made white smoke that soon turned to black with a dull red flame at the tunnel head. The burner judged the draft by the height, luminosity, and color of the flame emerging from the tunnel head and regulated it by daubing mud on the chinks between the loose bricks in the door. A large flame meant insufficient air; this made the resulting coke too soft. Excess air, indicated by little visible flame, caused excessive loss of carbon. After coking had run its allotted time, the burner unbricked the door and quenched the fire with a spray of water. He drew out the silvery coke by hand with an iron rake and carried it across the wharf in front of the ovens to railway cars (Fig. 2-13).\n\nEntering the coke yard on a sunny day was like stepping into a gritty fog bank. A burner soon learned to keep his eyes narrowed to slits so as to minimize the pricking of his eyeballs by the cinders. Muriel Sheppard, a Fayette County native, observed, “It is a surprise to find that once one is thoroughly immersed in coal smoke the sensation is rather pleasant”69—a reminder that work environments that may seem impossibly difficult to us were not necessarily perceived that way by the artisans actually doing the work.\n\nBeehive coke ovens released clouds of smoke and steam (Fig. 2-12). Since cokemakers intended to remove at least part of the sulfur in the bituminous coal they charged into their ovens, the smoke they released necessarily contained sulfur fumes as well as particulates. It would tarnish silver and brass in neighboring homes overnight.70 Where there were many ovens, the air was rarely free of smoke. Neighbors soon found that the smoke damaged trees and crops and left a covering of ash. Additionally, cokemakers often dumped enough solid wastes from their ovens into nearby creeks to impede the free flow of water.\n\nPennsylvania authorities did nothing about coke-making effluents until the very end of the century. Then, responding to public distress over the damage to the land near cokeworks, the state had W. A. Buckhout, a botanist at the Pennsylvania Agricultural Experiment Station, survey for environmental effects in the coke-making regions. He found that fumes from coke-works made adjacent land useless for other purposes. Nearby trees and crops soon showed signs of distress. He found sulfur residues causing brown spots on the leaves of trees as far as three-quarters of a mile downwind of the Mount Pleasant coke-works. Buckhout also found the forests in western Pennsylvania in generally poorer condition than those in the east and noted that in the west the forests received less care. Some species did reasonably well if the cokeworks operated only intermittently. Except in the most obvious cases, Buckhout found it difficult to fix causes for many of the specific effects he observed, and he was cautious about making generalizations.71 Perhaps some of his caution arose from reluctance to disturb the economic base of the area he studied.\n\nAmerican ironmasters got most of their coke from beehive ovens through the nineteenth century. Pennsylvanians first built by-product coke ovens to recover the volatile constituents of coal wasted by the beehive ovens at Johnstown in 1895. Although the by-product ovens reduced emission of smoke and sulfurous fumes, they released a heavy load of pollutants in their waste-water streams. Toxic organic compounds accumulated at their sites so that decommissioning a cokeworks could mean a costly clean-up.72\n\nWATER\n\nIn addition to thermal energy, ironworkers used a lot of mechanical power. They needed 15–20 horsepower to pump air into a 30-foot-high, charcoal-fired blast furnace, and up to 60 horsepower for the anthracite furnaces in use by 1850. A 1,300-pound helve hammer with a lift of 2.3 feet making 110 strokes per minute, such as might be used at a bloomery or finery forge, required 21 horsepower. A smith shaping axes or scythes under a tilt hammer used 20–35 horsepower.73 To roll 10 tons of finished bar iron a day, an ironmaster used an 80-horsepower engine to drive the rolls; if he made rails, he needed 250 horsepower to drive the rail mill.74 Because it took more power to roll steel than wrought iron (more than twice as much for rail steel),75 mill proprietors could not convert from rolling iron to steel unless they were willing to make a substantial investment in new equipment.\n\nThrough the first part of the nineteenth century, ironmasters got most of their mechanical power to run blowing engines, forge hammers, and rolling mills from flowing water. They had to locate their works along rivers or streams. They ran water through a waterwheel or turbine and returned it to the stream from which they took it without adding anything. Later, as they replaced their waterwheels and turbines by steam engines, they still needed abundant clean water to fill boilers and to cool furnace casings, tuyere nozzles, and rolls. They returned cooling water heated but otherwise unaltered. However, water used to cool rolls or hot metal picked up scale and oil. Additionally, artisans found raceways and streambanks convenient places to discard rubbish. At some ironworks, they dumped slag on river-banks. Their wastewater would then carry trash, particulates, and oil into the receiving stream.\n\nBuilders of ironworks often had to put a dam on a nearby stream to make a storage pond that would hold a reserve supply of water (Fig. 2-14). Although river water was a renewable resource, an ironmaster could not necessarily count on a stream to supply the water he needed indefinitely. Floods washed away some dams. Upstream users could accelerate siltation in storage ponds if they dumped debris into a stream. Artisans at the Hecla Forge on the Little Schuylkill River at New Ringgold, Pennsylvania, had relied on water power to pump blast air and drive their two forge hammers since 1828. They had to abandon their works in 1854 because coal debris released by miners upstream had filled the pond behind their dam, destroying their water supply.76"
