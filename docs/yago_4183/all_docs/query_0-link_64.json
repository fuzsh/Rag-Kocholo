New?\n\nbern has a splendld hlstory. It is\n\nreally one of the historio spots of tho\n\nSouth, as it was one of tho earllest\n\nsettlements ln North Carollna.

If tbe oftlcers who work\n\nunder it aro underpaid, that ls to be\n\nrogretted for tholr sake; lf they aro\n\noverpaid, that is to be regretteel tor |\n\nthe sake of the publlc. It is always\n\na safer and better plan for the peo- |\n\nple to insist that whilo thoir publio |\n\nservants shall be amply rewardod for\n\nthelr labors, tho publlc should know\n\nwhut they aro recelving. If it is not\n\nenough for them to live on in comfort,\n\nthoy should get more; if it is more\n\nthan they aro entltled to, tho unearned\n\nincrement should go to the public.\n\nMOHE TIUU'IJI.E FOI.

Another case, too, where the\n\nnewspaper was not to blamo, and\n\nthe man who said ho was mltiquoted\n\nwas to blame. Thls Incident ought\n\nto impress men who occupy publlo\n\nposltlons and who make rash state?\n\nment in the heat of passlon, only to\n\n\"lay lt on\" tho reporter, when they\n\nflnd how their utterancea appear in\n\ncold type, with the danger of trylng\n\nto blame newspapers which aro not to\n\nblame. Steve Griffin is manager ot\n\nthe Danville baseball team. On Mon?\n\nday nlgltt ho telegrnphed Tlie Times\n\nDispatch that he had resigned, be?\n\ncause the management had sold two of\n\nhis most proniising players. The mess?\n\nage was accepted in good falth and\n\nprlnted. In an afternoon newspaper\n\nyesterday, however, Griffin entered an\n\nunciualified denial, saying that he had\n\nnot resigned and, in effect. that The\n\nTimes-Dispatch had been guilty of\n\neonduct unbecoming a gentleman, or\n\nsomething of the sort.\n\nAVe print this mornlng a facsimlle\n\nof Griffin's telegram. Moreover, we\n\nhave had the telegraph compuny\n\nmake an investlgatlon at the Danville\n\nend, its report being simply that tho\n\ntelegram was filed by Griffin hlm?\n\nself.\n\nA newspaper takes an exqulsite\n\npleasure in puttlng tho mark on per?\n\nsons who try to put the mark on it.\n\nThere is no deslre to \"rub it into\" Mr.\n\nGriffin, ho is condemned by the re?\n\ncord in the case. In his telegram he\n\neven wrote the headlines: \"Griffin\n\nResigns.\" Other men occupying high?\n\ner publlc posltlons than the manager\n\nof the Danville baseball club have\n\nattempted the same sort of thlng\n\nbefore this. They havo succeeded in\n\nmaking the peoplo belleve that they\n\nwere misquoted by the newspapers,\n\nwhen they knew tho newspapers had\n\nquoted them correctly. But once\n\nthey try to put tho- blame on tho\n\nnewspaper, thvy find to their sorrow\n\nthai that same newspaper wlll let\n\nthem severely alono thereafter. lt is\n\nthe right medicine to give thom, and\n\nit Is the medicine most palnful to\n\nthose who love the glory of publicity.\n\nOccasionally, they \"get by.\" It ls\n\nworth whlle, however, to havo the re?\n\ncord as wo have It in tho case of Mr.\n\nSteve Griffin. AVe let the caso go\n\nto the Jury just on the facts, wlthout\n\nargument.\n\nTHE GOVEKNOlfS DE1.UU...ATION.\n\nThe Clifton Forge Dally Revlew can\n\n111 conceal_Jts imputience, becauso\n\nGovernor Mann has not yet announced\n\nwho wlll succeed Senator Daniel. lt\n\nsays:\n\n'?Governor Mann is taking more\n\ntime than is necessary to appoint a\n\nUnited States Senator.

Tho\n\npeople aro anxlous to know the numo\n\nof thoir next b'nlted Stules Senutor\n\nand as Governor Mann is charged Wlth\n\nthe duty of making tho appointmont.\n\nhe should not delay any longer. Of\n\ncourse, evorybody believcB that ex\n\nGovernor Swanson Is slated for United\n\nStates Senator, and so far as we know,\n\na majority of tho people want to soe\n\nMr. Swanson appointed, theroforo wo\n\nsee no need of holding the appolnt?\n\nment back.
