        "text": "Resorting to the supernatural to find something lost is a practice that can be observed over a very large range of times and places. With the affirmation of Christianity, these kinds of habits and beliefs were considered superstitious by the Church. During the early modern era, the institution appointed to control the integrity of the faithful in the Italian peninsula was the Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Roman and Universal Inquisition, which had a significant number of local tribunals spread over the territory. This essay aims to study the diffusion of the practice of finding treasures by using magical items and rituals in the area under the jurisdiction of the Sienese tribunal of the Holy Office (approximately the entire southern Tuscany), whose trial sources are preserved in the Archive of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (Vatican City). The research, based on around seventy individual cases, shows an interesting belief from a historicalâ€“anthropological point of view, namely: although in most cases people were looking for everyday objects that they had lost, sometimes, they used the same rituals to search for ancient treasures that they heard were buried or hidden in a particular place (church, field, or cellar), with the presence of guardians like spirits or demons, that had to be driven away with a prayer or an exorcism before taking possession of the treasure.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to explain why such a widespread practice as treasure hunting is related to narratives of cursed and haunted places. The reasons are many: a) the intermingling of official and folk religious elements in Orthodox Christian tradition that also serves the Greek nationalis-tic idea of continuity from Antiquity, b) the existence of evil spirits gives sufficient justification to despair, failure and ill health, by aligning otherness with misfortune, c) such narratives constitute patterns of behaviour, as they offer the terms for comprehensive oral dialogue between notions of good and evil, religious beliefs and scepticism ."
