During his tenure in Ottawa he served as Minister of Employment and Immigration, Minister Responsible for the Status of Women, Minister of Transport, Chairman of the Western Affairs Committee of Cabinet, and following a period as Official Opposition Critic in various capacities, he was appointed Minister of Human Resources Development and Minister of Western Economic Diversification. Since 1996, he served as Minister of Foreign Affairs. While travelling the world as Foreign Minister, he also searched for ways to promote Manitoba. He marketed the Port of Churchill, championed the Mid-Continent Trade Corridor, engaged the International Joint Commission to work with Manitoba and neighbouring states to reduce the kind of flooding experienced in Manitoba in 1997.
