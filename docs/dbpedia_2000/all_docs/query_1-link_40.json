        "text": "🎉 First Client Announcement 🎉 46% of newly opened accounts go inactive within the first year (💯 Jim Marous, The Financial Brand). With the cost of acquisition for new accounts well over $200, banks face a dual strain: coming out of pocket to acquire customers, while nearly half of those accounts go inactive. 💰😮 To address the risk of paying for inactive accounts, Locality Bank selected Swaystack to the personalize the post account opening onboarding and engagement journeys for its new customers. Read the good news: https://lnkd.in/e9xe6aGd In the words of COO and Co-founder Corey LeBlanc, \"Our partnership with Swaystack is a game-changer for us at Locality Bank. It bolsters our ability to deeply understand our customers from the very beginning of the relationship. Soon, we can deliver personalized insights, next best action, and product recommendations at the most opportune time.” ⏱⏳ We are excited to partner with Locality Bank to accomplish two important objectives: serve the South Florida business community and help Locality Bank punch above its weight using the power of data. For Swaystack, this is a can’t miss opportunity to boost the value Locality Bank currently generates from its next-gen digital banking and marketing automation platforms via trigger-based emails and digital banking ads personalized to each customer. 📲🏎 Thank you for believing in Simran S. and myself Keith Costello CFA, Corey LeBlanc, Drew Saito, and the entire Locality Bank team. It means the world! 🤝🚀 What are you doing to ensure your new accountholders become highly profitable and engaged? 📢📩 #localitybank #fortlauderdale #fintech #personalizedbanking #personalization #customerengagement #onboardingjourney #customerengagementplatform #bank #swaystack #miami #florida #communitybank #banking #technology #digitalbanking #hubspot #onlinebanking\n\nSince founding MK Decision in 2015 to help banks and credit unions with digital account opening, banking locally has always been important to me. I have always said to my friends and family, “I need to put my money where my mouth is and ensure my dollars are being invested into my community.” 🏘🏦 After relocating to Miami, FL in June of 2023, I decided to open an account with a local credit union ready to live up to my own standard and bank locally. I completed the application online but my attention was quickly diverted to take care of business at work. Nearly a month passed before I remembered that I submitted an application for a new checking account. I checked my email and didn’t find any follow ups from the credit union. ✍🏽🖨 In contrast, I found over a dozen emails from when I opened an account with Chime to do R&D for my previous business. The difference in approach was shocking to say the least. 📢📩 Being an entrepreneur at heart, I got to thinking, “how many credit unions have little to no follow up with members who recently opened an account? How many accounts go unfunded? How many members never even make it into digital banking let alone use their debit cards or set up direct deposit?” 💡🧐 According to 💯 Jim Marous at The Financial Brand, as many as 46% of new accounts go inactive within the first year after account opening. With the cost of acquisition for a new account well over $200, the credit union faces a dual strain: coming out of pocket to acquire members while facing the risk their accounts go inactive. ⏱⏳ The time is now to master your 60-day new account onboarding journey to build long lasting, loyal relationships that start out on the right foot from the start. 📲🏎 Here at Swaystack, Simran S. and I are personalizing onboarding and engagement journeys, via email and digital banking, to ensure members are actively using their checking accounts to get the most out of their credit union experience. ⌚️🤝🚀 Read the full story on CUInsight.com: https://lnkd.in/eC6mJUDb Thanks for helping us get the word out Lauren Culp, CUDE, Robbie Young, CUDE, and Alyssa Angurio, MBA. You are the best! 🙌🏽🎉 #fintech #personalizedbanking #personalization #memberengagement #onboardingjourney #customerengagementplatform #creditunion #bank #swaystack #cuinsights #miami #banking #technology #digitalbanking #jackhenry #fiserv #alkami #q2 #ncr\n\nOpen banking is a term that is thrown around often. But what does it really mean? Does it refer to open APIs that help us link external accounts or switch our direct deposit? 📲🏦 I propose that open banking is a culture. It is the way that we work together to help banks and credit unions solve their biggest challenges. Simran S. and I experienced open banking at its finest last week at Q2 Connect in Austin, TX. From our conversations in the lobby and hallways with good friends, to the prospect dinner that Swaystack held at North Italia, the open banking culture is alive and well. 🤝🏪 Furthermore, the conversations we had brought to light the importance of digital engagement. Nearly all the Fintechs we spoke with are focused on playing their role to create authentic, meaningful engagement with consumers and businesses alike. 📢📩 What are you doing to improve how you engage with consumers and businesses in digital banking? 👩🏾💻 Until next time, it was so great reconnecting with and meeting so many of you for the first time 🙏🏽🙌🏽: Cindy Vela Trudy McClain Ryan Hawkins Mitch Borneman Stephen Muse Adam Rogers Matthew Fehrmann Robert Harrigan Martin R.

Some ask themselves whether you are out to take their lunch. Others go out of their way to lend a helping hand simply because they believe continuous innovation is necessary for banks and credit unions to keep up with the accelerating times in this digital-first world. 📲🚀 Lauren Culp, CUDE, Robbie Young, CUDE, Alyssa Angurio, MBA, and the fantastic CUInsight.com team fit into the last group. They have made it their mission to inform the industry of the latest innovations and top challenges to solve through Fintech partners. 📰🎉 Simran S. and I are extremely grateful to the CUInsight.com team for sharing Swaystack's Hello World 👋🏽 announcement. Thank you for all your efforts to make music out of the noise and bring light where there’s darkness in the FinTech industry. 🎶💡 If you have personally benefitted from the CUInsight.com team, tell us how and when! Now’s your chance to give thanks to the team that makes it all happen. 🎊🎇 For those who have yet to read the announcement of Swaystack's personalized engagement platform built to help banks and credit unions win preferred financial institution status and stay top of wallet, here it is: https://lnkd.in/eXqcdDgY #fintech #personalizedbanking #personalization #memberengagement #customerengagementplatform #creditunion #bank #swaystack #cuinsights #miami #banking #technology #digitalbanking #jackhenry #fiserv\n\nEntering a new product category can be a daunting task for any founder. New buyer on the client side. New partners in the space. New competitive landscape. With all things new, how is a founder to find solid ground to hold onto and anchor the business to its objectives? 🧐⚓️ Last week, I had the honor of representing Swaystack's digital engagement platform at The Financial Brand Forum in Las Vegas. As this was our first conference since our Hello World on May 1st, I wanted to share a few observations I had with my “fresh eyes”: 1. Digital engagement, as a product category, has quickly become saturated with competitors all who have a unique approach or method to solving the engagement challenges banks and credit unions face. 📲 2. Digital engagement is not simply next best product recommendation but aso the measurement of product and/or service adoption. In other words, it is not enough to simply offer the end consumer the products that they do not already have with your institution. We must understand their financial journey and meet their needs just in time. Then, demonstrate the ROI from our efforts. 📊 3. Digital engagement is no longer a nice to have. Assuming your institution has worked hard to upgrade your core, digital banking, account opening, and loan origination experiences, the next best action is to maximize the value you receive from the heavy cost of this digital transformation. Stress test your digital channel infrastructure by leveraging the power of data to drive business results. ⏱ With so many new variables in my life these days, one thing that clearly remained the same was the quality people in our industry. I’m always humbled and inspired how many folks are coming together to help banks and credit unions compete with megabank and neobank technology. It takes a village and I’m grateful to have found my tribe. 🏘 A big thanks to all of you and so many more for being great human beings and guiding me on my journey: Corey LeBlanc Cassie LeBlanc Cindy Vela Eldon Tilley Ron Shevlin Sam Kilmer 💯 Jim Marous Christian Ruppe Justin Dunmyer Vishal Jhaveri Joan Clark Jessica Smedes Chad Warneke Hilary Reed Stacey Wright Amy M.

Embarking on the entrepreneurial path as our family prepares to expand weighs heavily on me but I know in my heart that it is the right time and place for my 2nd fintech venture. I want to be my most authentic self as our boy comes to this earth and entrepreneurship lights up my soul. ❤️🙏🏽 When visualizing the ideal conditions to begin my next chapter, having the right technical co-founder was imperative to me. Simran and I hit it off from our first encounter as we share the Sikh cultural background, a passion for innovation, and the desire to be change agents in the fintech ecosystem for the right reasons. 📲💬 In our discussions with financial institutions, we heard a common theme that banks and credit unions are influential members of their communities, yet their \"high touch\" approach to fueling growth has proven difficult to translate to a digital-first world. ✍🏽🖨 With consumer expectations heightened by Big Tech and e-commerce — 72% of consumers expect personalized interactions across platforms — 60% or more of bankers are behind the curve and are struggling to meet the rising consumer demand for a personal touch in a digital world. ⌚️🏦 Swaystack’s mission is to help banks and credit unions tackle this challenge and compete with megabanks and neobanks through personalized digital engagement. We are laser focused on understanding the consumer’s needs paired with the right message and channel at the right time. 👩🏽🎓⏳ We believe data-driven financial institutions will be able to punch above their weight and set themselves apart from the competition with omnichannel messaging orchestration. Swaystack is being meticulously designed to enhance digital banking and customer relationship management (CRM) systems, allowing financial institutions to: - Reduce churn - Increase account balances - Grow interchange revenue - Drive loan applications To learn more about our vision to personalize digital banking and CRMs with a single consumer engagement platform, please check out our Hello World 👋🏽 post: https://lnkd.in/dHRs-Vtg Thank you for your support and encouragement on this journey.

Asking customers what they want and by when vs. what they need, value, and are willing to pay for the solutions to their toughest problems 2. Waiting until the product is developed to fully understand my ideal customer segments, product configurations, and pricing strategy 3. Treating customers like a one size fits all product approach will meet their needs and unique use cases 4. Basing my Total Addressable Market calculations off what price I think my customers will pay vs. what they are actually willing to pay 5. Thinking that I know what the customer needs more than they do 6. Assuming that pricing strategy is a sales and finance exercise vs. a product and engineering science For those of you who are interested in joining the 15+ Banks and Credit Unions who are going through the Monetizing Innovation process with our stealth mode FinTech startup, please DM me and we'll schedule an intro call. 🚀💬⌨️ Shout out to Madhavan Ramanujam and Dr. Georg Tacke the authors of Monetizing Innovation: How Smart Companies Design the Product Around the Price. I cannot thank you enough for investing your time, energy, and resources to create a business process that puts the customer in the driver's seat to prioritize the product roadmap around need, value, and willingness to pay. 🙏🏽😎🙌🏽 Mazin S., you're the best for this book recommendation. I'm proud of your passion for innovation and personal self development. #fintech #miamitech #monetizinginnovation #startup #stealthmode #communitybanks #creditunions #financialinstitution #technology #startups #banking #jackhenry #fiserv #FIS\n\n📣 Friends and Family 📣 I hope this message finds you in good spirits as we experience the changes already upon us in 2024. Today, I’m sharing a significant milestone in my career — it's with gratitude and humility that I announce my departure from Alkami Technology to begin my next chapter. 📖 I’ll tell you what I’m doing next soon enough, but I first want to take a moment and express my appreciation for Alkami. 🚀 To the Executive Leadership Team: Stephen Bohanon, Alex Shootman, Bryan Hill, Allison Cerra, Deep Varma, Carl Cross, Julie H., Doug Linebarger and Board I am forever grateful that you continue to put everything you have behind the Digital Account Opening (DAO) team as we help credit unions and community banks compete with megabanks, strengthen their local economies, and win more deposits. ⌚️🏦 To the Leadership Team who carries on the Alkami DAO vision: Jeff Chen, Shannon M., Sundar Siva, Ayman Abi Abdallah, Jonathan Benamoz, Eddie R. Thomaz, and David Kaylor as well as all the talented, humble folks that I’ve worked with along the way, thank you for doing everything in your power and within your realm of influence to ensure the success of DAO these last 2.5 years.❤️🙌🏽 You've all helped me learn a ton, build my character, and become a better human during my tenure with Alkami. 🙏🏽 I’d also like to express my sincere thanks to all the clients and partners I’ve worked with closely to identify problems and solve them with technology. Your ability to see big challenges within your organization and collaborate with entrepreneurs and technologists to create the next generation of FinTech solutions is imperative to improve banking for the future generations in the USA.📱👩🏽🎓 As I embark on the next chapter of my career, I am honored to have met so many outstanding people (too many to name individually) who make it a joy to do my life’s work in this industry. 🚀 With love and gratitude, Har Rai Khalsa #WeAreAlkami #LifeAtAlkami #Alkami #digitalbanking #digitalaccountopening #fintech #icba #venturecenter #thinktech #entrepreneur #entrepreneurship\n\nStephen Bohanon taught me a valuable lesson in September, 2021 that taking the time to celebrate the passage of time (anniversaries, milestones, client launches, etc.) brings deeper meaning and more colorful memories to life’s experiences. 📸🖼 This past week the Alkami Technology Digital Account Opening (DAO) Team celebrated our 2-year anniversary since #mkdecision was acquired by #Alkami. To properly honor the passing of time and the memories we are building, I wanted to recount the past 2 years using a quote by Jarod Kintz, “Some things change, and some things stay the same.” Some things change: * Bank collapses of almost half a trillion dollars already in 2023 😥💔 * Bank deposit outflows of $472B in Q1, 2023 (nearly 2.5% drop with more challenges ahead as fresh Treasury Bonds with high yields apply more pressure to Community FIs competing for deposits) 📉🔻 * Megabanks and Regional Banks are losing market share to Neobanks, who have won 47% of new checking accounts opened in 2023 🏦💰 * Alkami made the strategic decision to embrace remote work versus rebuilding the in-office culture 💻🏘 * Alkami chose to double down and retool the Executive Leadership Team (ELT) with new CEO, Alex Shootman, CRO, Carl Cross, CTO, Deep Varma, CHRO, Julie H., and Chief Customer Officer, Wayne McCulloch, to level up the entire company 🚀💪🏽 * My professional focus shifted from Startup CEO, to VP, General Manager, to VP, Product for Digital Account Opening (DAO) and Loan Origination Systems (LOS) 🏗🔨 * I moved my family from San Diego to Dallas, got married, and moved the family from Dallas to Miami in preparation for little ones in the coming years ❤️🏡👼🏽 Some things stay the same: * Credit Unions and Community Banks desire to innovate and compete with Megabank and Neobank digital experiences 📱⌚️ * Alkami’s mission to deliver the digital capabilities Credit Unions and Community Banks require to compete with the Megabanks and Neobanks ⚔️💻 * Our team’s loyalty to one another and commitment to hold the customer as the north star with everything that we do 🤝🙏🏽 * My personal commitment to put the customer first and do whatever it takes to support my team along the way 💪🏽🏗🔨 Life is full of challenges and changes but how we respond to life’s events is in our control. What challenges and changes have you faced in the last two years? #WeAreAlkami #digitalaccountopening #digitalbanking #loanorigination #miami #dallas #sandiego #LifeAtAlkami #FinishStrong #Family #Alkamists\n\nAlkami Technology's 2023 Co:lab Client Conference was a success. 🎇🎉 Our clients, partners, and colleagues came together to manifest our shared mission to keep banking local. 🏦🏫 With headliners like Ron Shevlin of Cornerstone Advisors and 💯 Jim Marous of The Financial Brand, thought leadership for banking and technology to promote local economies was at its best. ⌚️📱 I was honored to represent the digital account opening and loan origination team at Alkami with two presentations on the state of the industry and what we can do about it. 🏭🛠 In my first presentation, we discussed the competition community banks and credit unions are facing from Neobanks and Megabanks when it comes to winning deposits. The community spoke and determined that Neobanks have quickly taken market share through their exceptional: * Customer Experience * Digital Marketing * Story Brands By creating enjoyable and memorable onboarding journeys, Neobanks are delighting new customers who have been attracted by purpose-driven marketing either through email, social media, or Google Ads. 💻⌨️ In the second presentation, Ryan Waterman, AAP led Laura Hartness-Smith, CTP and I through a panel discussion on how to attract business deposits and use technology to compete for SME business relationships in the digital age. 🏨🏭 It was a joy to hear how Trustmark Bank grew deposits by over $350M by actively promoting relationship-driven business. 🤝🙌 All in all, the Alkami executive leadership team held incredible general sessions and Michael Jr.'s comedy and why were on point. 🙏😇 Here's to next year! ❤️😎 #technology #customerexperience #leadership #banking #bank #banks #team #digital #digitalmarketing #community #socialmedia #google #digitalaccountopening #loanorigination #digitalbanking #Alkami #Colab #WeAreAlkami #LifeAtkami"
