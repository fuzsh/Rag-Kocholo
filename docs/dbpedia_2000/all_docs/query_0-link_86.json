Kennedy gave the convocation and reflected on the importance of legacy and memorials. “A nation reveals itself, not only by the men it produces, but by the men it honors,” he told the gathering. Kennedy feted Frost as a man of infinite importance to American culture, and congratulated Amherst for commemorating a poet rather than a president. “In America, our heroes have customarily run to men of large and dramatic accomplishment,” but the Frost Library, Kennedy noted, memorializes “our spirit.”1 By celebrating a writer rather than a statesman, a critic rather than a general, Kennedy believed that Amherst expanded our memory of the American experience. That endorsement was especially poignant because little more than a week after he addressed the college, Kennedy was dead. His assassination obscured the thrust of his argument—that in the United States, memorials and tributes skew towards men of dramatic accomplishment like generals and presidents. The public clamor to confer martyrdom on the slain president led to the proliferation of memorials at home and abroad, and the commemorative activities seemed to prove Kennedy’s point. If we count the memorials, there are few personalities larger than the president and no single office as emblematic of the American experience. Presidents leave the White House with a weighty legacy derived primarily from their role as head of state, and they often act as emblems of the era in which they serve. It is popular to summarize the national condition with epochal monikers like the “Age of 1\n\n5894_Cullinane and Ellis.indd 1\n\n04/10/18 3:38 PM\n\nmichael patrick cullinane and sylvia ellis Jackson” or the “Reagan Revolution,” and in doing so bestow an entire era to a president. Times of prosperity or stagnation affect our recollection of their stewardship, as does social progress or lack thereof. Presidential legacies come to embody their achievements, shortcomings, transgressions, and the precedents they set. In addition, the consequences of their decisions—intended or unintended—contribute to our memories of presidential administrations and help construct a legacy. Successive generations play a considerable role in determining how we consider presidential leadership, and Kennedy’s Amherst speech recognized one of the most important factors in legacy production: people. While any president can lay claim to a set of legislative accomplishments or assert their instrumentality in social progress, building a legacy requires buy-in from those who lived through presidential terms of service as well as later generations. Legacy requires mass reflection upon the past and, to a certain extent, a consensus on how we interpret history. Kennedy, for example, left an indelible mark on the national consciousness in myriad ways. We can debate the virtues of his tax cuts, Cold War brinkmanship, or the morality of his romantic dalliances and still recognize what his election represented in an era of striking cultural change, as the first Catholic president, and as a victim of assassination. Indeed, legacies may derive from opposing constituencies, and can produce divergent interpretations of the past. Kennedy’s memorial at Runnymede outside London offers a case in point.2 The stone tablet, placed at the site made famous by King John affixing his seal to the Magna Carta, celebrates Kennedy’s commitment to democracy during the Cold War. In 1968, only three years after the dedication of that memorial, anti-Vietnam War protesters attempted to destroy the tablet with a bomb, and a year later vandals spray-painted a swastika on the facade.3 Legacy is subjective, and changes as our circumstances evolve and perceptions adjust.4 Our memories of past presidents create legacy themes that then appear in memorials, and these memorials can be as varied as our memories. Moreover, such diversity in approach to presidential commemoration often produces incongruous impressions. Utilitarian memorials confer meaning by naming spaces, services, 2\n\n5894_Cullinane and Ellis.indd 2\n\n04/10/18 3:38 PM\n\nan introduction to presidential legacy and facilities. These differ greatly from artistic memorials such as bronze statues, marble temples, or the landscape and architectural designs so prevalent in Washington, DC. “Living” memorials might be considered a separate category and can take the form of endowments, scholarships, and prizes, or even literally by planting trees. Indeed, the sites and vehicles of memory extend across a range of mnemonic schemes.5 For presidents, these include regular “rankings” of their leadership, as well as countless depictions in popular culture media.6 The goal of this book is to identify and analyze the agents of and means by which presidential legacies are constructed. Because the president occupies a unique place in American consciousness, those who memorialize former presidents have made use of a wide assortment of approaches, and have done so for a variety of reasons that closely relate to a given context and set of objectives. As a result, presidential legacies change frequently and directly correlate with a given historical context and the impulses of memorializers living at that time. Analyzing the people who dedicate themselves to presidential memorialization and the methods they use will shed new light on the presidency, individual presidents, and the ways we remember historical personalities. The virtue of this collection should thus be apparent: if our perception of the past is shaped in any measure by memorialization and memorializers, we owe it to ourselves to consider these sources and their impact. Academic scholarship has shown a growing interest in the memory and legacy of American presidents, and so does the wider public.7 Barack Obama’s announcement that his presidential center will opt out of traditional management structures that share responsibility between a private foundation and the federal National Archives and Records Administration was received with compliments and controversy. Obama’s Chicago-based presidential center will forego tax-payer funding, making the venture costneutral for Americans, but in doing so it will free the Obama Foundation from federal scrutiny and regulation. The Foundation can construct an Obama legacy any way it sees fit.8 And while the thought of a runaway Obama Foundation seeking to bestow sainthood on the 43rd president might not seem a pressing 3\n\n5894_Cullinane and Ellis.indd 3\n\n04/10/18 3:38 PM\n\nmichael patrick cullinane and sylvia ellis concern to many, consider for a moment the Trump Foundation and its intentions. The agents and modes of memorialization have a considerable impact on our impression of the past. Presidential legacies can act as historical milestones by which we understand and interpret our contemporary cultural traditions. For example, in 2017, the Theodore Roosevelt statue outside the American Museum of Natural History was splashed with red paint in an apparent effort to bring attention to Roosevelt’s “patriarchy, white supremacy, and settler-colonialism.”9 The statue was nearly removed as a result of the protests, and that caused environmentalists to rage. Roosevelt’s place at the museum symbolized the president’s commitment to conservation and scientific exploration, not imperialism, although many Americans see Roosevelt as the embodiment of an immoral colonial spirit.10 Who here is right? What public debates did the controversy raise? And how do we reconcile these disagreements? Although somewhat tangential to presidential history, the hundreds of Confederate statues and memorials dismantled by municipal authorities or destroyed by mobs throughout the summer of 2017 show how public art raises fresh questions about American history and culture, long after it is erected.11 These grand acts of construction (or destruction) of memorials belong to a range of commemorative activities that stretch far beyond marble statues, presidential centers, and convocations. An assortment of cultural outputs, political acts and invocations, and public activities contribute to presidential legacies, and each chapter of this book examines one of these activities or modes. The first, by Benjamin Hufbauer, examines the presidential library and museum system. These sites of memory emerged from Franklin Roosevelt’s desire to tell “his” story to the masses. Hufbauer explains how the rise of a modern “imperial” presidency—defined in no small measure by direct engagement with the public, and appealing to American public opinion—helped create the library and museum system as part of a growing effort to propagandize presidential legacy. We can perhaps find parallels to ancient monuments, Hufbauer contends. Lyndon Johnson’s Library and Museum surely compares to an ancient wonder with its tenstorey travertine monolith (140,000 square feet of interior space) 4\n\n5894_Cullinane and Ellis.indd 4\n\n04/10/18 3:38 PM\n\nan introduction to presidential legacy set on a groomed fourteen-acre campus. In similar scale and scope, Patrick Hagopian has researched the various plans for a Dwight D. Eisenhower memorial in Washington, DC. The memorial, a grand design for a monument city like Washington, changed considerably over time due to artistic differences and interpretive disagreement. Family, famous architects, city planners, and congressmen debated Ike’s legacy and the most appropriate elements to memorialize, and curated a public site to emphasize some aspects of his life over others. Hagopian’s analysis demonstrates the contested nature of memorials and the way in which they construct legacy themes. Bricks-and-mortar memorials like presidential centers and monuments belong to a traditional style of legacy-making, but a host of unorthodox modes of memorialization may have a similar impact on public memory. Michael Patrick Cullinane’s chapter on advertising demonstrates how marketing agencies and businesses latch onto presidential legacy in order to sell products. Advertisements need not leave a permanent impression of a former president on the public consciousness; they are instead designed to draw attention to a product by using the president or presidency as a marker of the product’s reliability or quality. Marketing agencies and advertising executives may know little or nothing about presidents, in fact, or care little about the consequences of their advertising on presidential legacy, but they construct images that, in effect, depict legacies and influence public opinions. They are ephemeral in nature, but leave a trace that Cullinane argues can reveal the source of public misconceptions and myths about the presidency. Similarly, Gregory Frame examines the contemporary representations of LBJ in motion pictures, showing how producers, directors, writers, and actors shape public memory. Although less fleeting than advertisements, motion picture productions tend to put commercial gain ahead of historical accuracy. The films evaluated by Frame in Chapter 6 span fifteen years, from 2002 to 2017, and give some indication of how visual depictions of the presidency have changed over time and how they remain consistent. Frame concludes that, despite the dynamic nature of film, cinematic portrayals of presidents lean towards singular profiles that contrast with the multitudes inherent in our personalities. 5\n\n5894_Cullinane and Ellis.indd 5\n\n04/10/18 3:38 PM\n\nmichael patrick cullinane and sylvia ellis Other non-traditional forms of memorialization come via the literary route, as Kristin Cook writes. If legacy resides in film, art, and advertising, it must also surely reside in the grammar and metaphors of literature. And the types of literary text can include books and poetry as much as lawsuits, editorials, symbols, signs, and new media. Broadly conceived, Cook explores the literary legacy of presidents in sometimes overlooked texts, and argues that such scholarship has the capacity to enlarge our understanding of the past. In literature we find new patterns of legacy, and Cook compels us to consider the esoteric Louisiana Batture case as an instance of literary production that challenges our impression of Thomas Jefferson. While many of these chapters deal with commemorative activists, each president may be considered an activist for their own legacy. Three chapters of this book reflect on presidential actions that help position their place in history. Emily Charnock and Richard Damms focus on presidential “farewells.” Charnock analyzes the data surrounding presidential travel in lame duck terms. Her study shows how presidents aim to communicate achievements and avoid making reference to the failures of their administrations during their last year in office. The farewell tour is an opportunity for the president to set the tone of memorial activities in the post-presidential years, and Damms’s chapter considers the power and legacy of Eisenhower’s Farewell Address. Penning his farewell gave Ike remarkable personal interest, and the president used polling to gather information on public opinion and took great pains to consider the implications of each word. The term made famous by that speech—“military-industrial complex”— warns of a system that perpetuates war at the expense of domestic prosperity, a system that Eisenhower arguably played a part in sustaining. Damms demonstrates how the speech resonated among anti-war activists, while Ike never lost his appeal among national security stalwarts. In a similar vein, Thomas Tunstall Allcock explains how presidents use diplomacy to shape their image. Diplomatic events such as state visits can play a role in the construction of legacy, be it LBJ’s Texas barbecues or Kennedy’s gold-plated and celebrity-studded galas. Statecraft not only allows presidents to craft an image of their administrations to the world, 6\n\n5894_Cullinane and Ellis.indd 6\n\n04/10/18 3:38 PM\n\nan introduction to presidential legacy it often reacts to domestic public opinion and strengthens a president’s image at home. Tunstall Allcock advertently shows how a president uses a team of support staff to shape his image, from the First Lady to foreign dignitaries, and that the staged nature of high-level diplomacy has all the trappings of performance. A final thread of analysis the book inspects are the prompts that compel us to consider the past. Obvious mnemonic reminders come every so many years with anniversaries of presidential births, deaths, and momentous events. Mark McLay explores the power and significance of anniversaries on public memory. Although the cycles of anniversaries are unstoppable, those that stimulate the largest waves of commemorative activity often arise when multiple decades or a century passes. There is something about the numbers 50 or 100; they trigger popular calls for remembrance, McLay contends. They mobilize our thoughts. In the case of Lyndon Johnson’s legacy, which McLay examines most closely, anniversaries can be a boon or a scourge. The fiftieth anniversaries of great achievements like the Civil Rights and Voting Rights acts are followed by the fiftieth anniversary of the war in Vietnam. Which LBJ legacy emerges from our remembrance is as yet unknown. Sylvia Ellis argues that cyberspace is now a crucial site for presidential legacy formation and memorial. Future generations may well form their opinions about past presidents—and sitting presidents—through the lens of new media such as social media and video games. The book concludes with an epilogue from one of the most prolific presidential biographers: H.W. Brands. Venturing an explanation for all this presidential commemoration, Brands remarks that as presidential power grows, a reverence for the office increases and the public develops a greater interest. Almost like a celebrity, the public thirst for more information about the president creates a market for legacy and memorialization. It also creates a market for biography, a fact that Brands readily admits has led him to write about several former presidents. Had public interest gravitated to the lives of scientists, we might have more biographies of Enrico Fermi and Vera Rubin. That the presidency captures our attention so completely was exactly the point Kennedy made at the dedication of the Frost 7\n\n5894_Cullinane and Ellis.indd 7\n\n04/10/18 3:38 PM\n\nmichael patrick cullinane and sylvia ellis Library. We tend to memorialize presidents because their achievements and failures are so dramatic and grand. Because their lives play out in the pervasive view of the media, their words and deeds seep into our conversations around the dinner table, or interactions with friends and colleagues, and sometimes strangers. As a consequence, we have a stake in the presidency and what we learn from these chapters is that the process of engaging with a president’s image makes all of us agents of their legacy.\n\nNotes 1.

Bush Presidential Center was dedicated on the campus of Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas.1 President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama were there, as were former President and First Lady Bill and Hillary Clinton, Barbara and George Bush Sr., Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter, as well as a crowd of thousands and—since CNN and other networks transmitted the ceremony live—a television audience of millions. The United States Army Band played “Battle Hymn of the Republic” with its refrain “Glory, Glory, Hallelujah.” Later, fireworks exploded forming a giant “W” over the impressive neo-classical complex, which was designed by the award-winning dean of Yale’s School of Architecture, Robert A.M. Stern. Since the other, theoretically co-equal branches of the federal government do not get this kind of celebratory commemoration, the dedication of the Bush Presidential Center illuminated a significant problem facing the United States: the excessive and narcissistic aggrandizement of the presidency at the expense of rational thought about the constitutional limits on executive power. Former President Bush said in his dedication speech—optimistically fantasizing about history’s verdict on his presidency— that “when future generations come to this library and study this administration, they’re going to find out that we stayed true to our convictions—that we expanded freedom . . . and that when our\n\n11\n\n5894_Cullinane and Ellis.indd 11\n\n04/10/18 3:38 PM\n\nbenjamin hufbauer freedom came under attack, we made the tough decisions required to keep the American people safe.”2 When former President Bill Clinton spoke, however, he deflated Mr. Bush’s self-congratulation and earned a knowing laugh from the rich, powerful, and wellconnected donors who made up much of the audience by quipping that the Bush Library was just “the latest, grandest example of the eternal struggle of former presidents to rewrite history.”3 Mr. Clinton would know, since he did the same kind of rewriting of history in 2004 when his $250-million Clinton Presidential Library opened in Little Rock, Arkansas. Likewise, former President Obama is working on the Obama Presidential Center in Chicago, which might have a total price tag of as much as one billion dollars when its endowment is included, and which is scheduled to open in 2021. Presidential libraries and centers (and I will say more about the distinction between these two) are already scattered across the American landscape, from Massachusetts to California, with many more in between and new ones being built every four to eight years for as far as the eye can see. As presidential centers have more or less doubled in cost with each new US president, some questions come to mind: How did we get to this place in history, where former presidents get to create colossal temples of spin dedicated to themselves? What does presidential self-commemoration mean in the larger sweep of history? Although I’ve studied presidential libraries and centers for more than twenty years, and written a book about them with a title similar to the one for this chapter, in just the past year I’ve begun to see presidential centers in a more ominous light than before.4 Their extraordinary and at times surreal mixture of personal and political narcissism now seem to have built part of the foundation for President Donald J. Trump’s rise by helping to normalize his kind of savage political and personal self-promotion. Or, perhaps more accurately, the increasing expense, grandiosity, and self-congratulatory air of presidential libraries and centers is a symptom of an enveloping political disorder that has culminated in Mr. Trump’s campaign and presidency. Some of us can now already envision with disturbing vividness the future Trump Presidential Center, largely because it will be a direct outgrowth 12\n\n5894_Cullinane and Ellis.indd 12\n\n04/10/18 3:38 PM\n\npresidential libraries and centers of what we’ve already experienced during the eighty-year history of American presidents building monuments to themselves. These presidential temples are built with privately raised money, but from Herbert Hoover’s to George W. Bush’s, the federal government runs them in perpetuity. President Bush said in his dedication speech that “This beautiful building has my name above the door, but it belongs to you.” Presidents for many decades have claimed that they are bestowing upon us a gift for which we should be grateful, but that may not always be the case. The upcoming Obama Presidential Center, where the most notable structure on the campus-like setting resembles the base of an Egyptian obelisk, is breaking with tradition by being completely privately funded and operated, and not supported by the federal government. But that is ultimately a small difference. In the analysis of these memorials, the grandeur of the future Obama Presidential Center rests not on whether it is run by the federal government, but on how it has been inspired by examples created by past American presidents. The Obama Center will, like previous presidential centers and libraries, echo the non-democratic past, where autocratic rulers since the dawn of human history have commemorated themselves in elaborate ways. There are parallels to American presidential self-commemoration in the ancient world. The pyramids, obelisks, temples, and tombs of the pharaohs of ancient Egypt told glorified versions of their reigns, and were tended by paid priests for centuries. And the Imperial Cult of the Roman Empire made most Emperors into gods for political worship. A few Roman Emperors even had a res gestae or list of achievements engraved in stone.5 These self-proclaimed and exaggerated lists of achievements are prequels to the elaborate museum displays in presidential libraries, which are largely curated by the former presidents.6 Presidential libraries are an accepted fact of American political life, but what are their deeper meanings? How does the architecture of a presidential library reflect the personality and ideology of a president? And how do presidential libraries use and abuse the raw materials of history? This chapter will try to briefly answer these questions. 13\n\n5894_Cullinane and Ellis.indd 13\n\n04/10/18 3:38 PM\n\nbenjamin hufbauer Digging deeper, the larger issue for almost all presidential libraries is run-away power, or what historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. called The Imperial Presidency.7 Presidential libraries don’t just commemorate individual presidents, they promote an expansive view of executive power, while usually ignoring excesses, mistakes, and abuses. It’s not a coincidence that the federal presidential library was invented by Franklin Roosevelt, identified by Schlesinger as the first modern “imperial president.” Schlesinger was, like many Americans in the late 1960s and early 1970s, disturbed by the abuses of power by Presidents Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon. He showed in his book that these abuses went beyond the personality flaws of a few presidents, and were instead systemic. There was a steady gathering of power by presidents during the crises of the Great Depression, World War II, and the Cold War. Even presidents whom Schlesinger admired, like Harry Truman, extended the power of the presidency in ways that violated the Constitution by, for instance, committing the United States to war in Korea without seeking or receiving the constitutionally mandated declaration of war from Congress. In the decades since Schlesinger’s landmark book was published, the questionable use of constitutional powers by presidents of both parties have continued. For instance, after 9/11, the Bush administration authorized the CIA to engage in torture and, starting in 2009, the Obama administration used executive power to conduct extensive domestic surveillance and launch scores of foreign drone strikes. As ineffectual as recent American presidents sometimes seem, abuses of power of the kind that disturbed Schlesinger continue on in new forms. Presidential libraries and centers are, I believe, a symptom of an increasingly dysfunctional American political system, for they serve in large part to excuse the expansion and abuse of presidential power that historians say entered a new era with President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. FDR helped design the Dutch Colonial style architecture of his presidential library, the first to be federally operated, which opened on his estate at Hyde Park, New York in 1941. In creating his library, Roosevelt looked to the Rutherford B. Hayes Presidential Library in Fremont, Ohio, the first presidential library to be built, but it was Franklin Roosevelt who got the 14\n\n5894_Cullinane and Ellis.indd 14\n\n04/10/18 3:38 PM\n\npresidential libraries and centers federal government involved. The Hayes Library was founded to honor the nineteenth president and it included a museum as well as an archive of documents. Hayes, who fought in the Civil War, was said by General Ulysses S. Grant to have displayed “conspicuous gallantry on the field of battle,” and his presidency (1877–81) marked the end of Reconstruction. The Hayes Library was founded in 1916 by Webb Hayes, the President’s son, and has been maintained for a century without federal funding. In a sense, the whole presidential library phenomenon started with Hayes, but it was revolutionized by Roosevelt when he got his wish for his library to be run by the federal government. The Roosevelt Library was modest in size when compared with succeeding presidential libraries (although since its founding it’s been expanded a few times). By creating an institution with an archive for all of the records relating to his life, as well as a popular history museum that has told FDR’s story to millions of tourists, Roosevelt changed presidential commemoration in an ambitious way. Previous presidents would only have monuments built in their honor decades after they died. For instance, the Lincoln Memorial was dedicated in 1922, more than fifty years after President Lincoln’s death. Washington waited longer: eighty-five years. And many presidents before Roosevelt did not get a national monument at all. This was a better system, for do we need temples dedicated to the memories of Millard Fillmore and Chester Alan Arthur? Or to every single one of our recent presidents? Yet, thanks to Roosevelt, no matter how great, failed, or, most likely, mediocre, every American president gets to create a kind of national monument. Roosevelt was able to engineer this shift in presidential commemoration for several reasons, including changes in mass media that he used to reimagine and enlarge presidential power in the 1930s. Just as importantly, many presidential records since the time of Washington had been lost in private ownership. The private ownership of presidential papers was a tradition started when George Washington, on his retirement, shipped all of his official and personal documents to Mount Vernon. After Washington’s death, his papers were left to his nephew, who confessed that they were “extensively mutilated by rats.” The remains of Washington’s 15\n\n5894_Cullinane and Ellis.indd 15\n\n04/10/18 3:38 PM\n\nbenjamin hufbauer papers, like the remains of many presidential papers, were eventually purchased by the Library of Congress, but only after some were lost forever. Even the presidential records that found their way to the Library of Congress sometimes had unusual restrictions placed on them by relatives. For instance, many of Abraham Lincoln’s papers were unavailable to historians until 1947.8 If we have to wait until eighty years after a president’s death to get at the records, or whatever is left of them, how are we to learn from our own history? FDR knew this, and also knew that every new government program needs beneficiaries who will lend political support. To create his presidential library, Roosevelt wooed professional historians by saying that his library would be part of the recently created National Archives, and would make available to historians all of his records as soon as possible. But a secret memo that FDR wrote in 1943 makes clear that he wanted all of the most sensitive records sealed away.9 After Roosevelt’s death, a judge ruled that FDR’s public statements took precedence, and now any of us can go into the Roosevelt Library’s archive and, with the help of professional archivists, look at the personal letters that FDR had sought to restrict, as well as his presidential records. Our understanding of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt’s public and personal lives has been immeasurably enriched as a result. The recent Roosevelt documentary by Ken Burns was made possible in large part by open access to records at the Roosevelt Library. The second part of the presidential library was a museum for tourists, and FDR looked forward to the museum serving, as he said, “an appalling number of sightseers.” Initially, the museum was filled with relics, from his childhood clothes to mementos of his presidency, including, tellingly, a papier-mâché portrait of Roosevelt himself as an Egyptian sphinx. At the time, some objected to FDR’s seemingly narcissistic creation of a monument to himself. One newspaper accused Roosevelt of wanting a “Yankee Pyramid,” while a member of Congress said that “only an egocentric maniac would have the nerve to ask” for a presidential library.10 An editorial comic from the Chicago Tribune even pictured FDR as Santa Claus putting a giant present into his own stocking, saying, “Won’t he be surprised—Bless His Heart.” 16\n\n5894_Cullinane and Ellis.indd 16\n\n04/10/18 3:38 PM\n\npresidential libraries and centers The Roosevelt Library cost about $7 million when adjusted for inflation, all privately raised from FDR’s supporters. Successive presidents have built their monuments in the same way—with private money—before handing them off to the government to staff and fund (although at times presidential libraries have been expanded with federal money). It costs about $70 million a year to run the thirteen presidential libraries.11 Roosevelt was buried next to his library in 1945, and when Eleanor Roosevelt died seventeen years later she was buried next to him. Several other presidents and first ladies have also been buried at their presidential libraries. In 2004, when Ronald Reagan died, there was live TV coverage of his casket being driven up the mountainside in Simi Valley, California, to the Reagan Presidential Library, for a cinematic burial at sunset. These burial ceremonies help make presidential libraries part of what has been called the “civil religion” of the United States.12 This term, first coined by writer and philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, has been used by historians to describe our political veneration for secular “saints” like George Washington, sacred sites like the Lincoln Memorial, sacred objects like the Declaration of Independence, and rituals like the singing of the national anthem. Presidential libraries are part of this civil religion; they are sites where tourists can make pilgrimages to see the relics and read the hagiographies of presidents who, although recognized as lesser than Lincoln and Washington, are still supposed to be worthy of some degree of patriotic veneration. After Roosevelt, the construction of a presidential library seemed like a natural and necessary step. Harry S. Truman had built in Independence, Missouri, a library even grander than FDR’s, with a facade echoing Queen Hatshepsut’s temple in Egypt. As tourists enter the Truman Library, which opened in 1957, they see American artist Thomas Hart Benton’s 500-plus-square-foot mural “Independence and the Opening of the West,” which frames the entry to the Library’s most popular attraction, a 94 percent scale replica of the Oval Office. The mural and replica together create a linked message about the settlement of the West in the nineteenth century, as well as about presidential leadership in the nuclear age. During the era shown in the mural—from the 1840s 17\n\n5894_Cullinane and Ellis.indd 17\n\n04/10/18 3:38 PM\n\nbenjamin hufbauer to the 1860s—Independence was a supply station for American settlers. The painting shows how Truman’s future hometown helped the United States to achieve its “manifest destiny.” In the mural’s center, armed white men prepare to defend the women and children of their camp from two approaching Native Americans. Western movies and TV programs, which were extremely popular in the 1950s, influenced Benton’s “Independence and the Opening of the West.” Westerns during the early Cold War recast international tensions into a heroic past. As historian Stanley Corkin writes, “the Western was well-suited to convey . . . [the] rationales for post-war US foreign policy, including [those] . . . that guided the Truman administration.”13 In other words, just as settlers secured the frontier, the mural seemed to imply, President Truman and NATO helped secure the world against the Soviet Union. President Truman’s contributions to the early Civil Rights movement are also seen in the mural. The two prominent African American blacksmiths refer to a nineteenth-century African American named Hiram Young, a free black man who was the most sought-after wagon-maker in Independence.14 President Truman, with his Executive Orders to desegregate the Armed Forces and to guarantee fair civil-service employment, had, at that time, made more significant progress on civil rights than any president since Lincoln. Benton’s painting presents a microcosm of nineteenth-century American society, and prepares tourists for the Oval Office replica just beyond. As they enter, visitors stand inside the curved walls of the Oval Office where they see Truman’s desk next to the American flag and the president’s flag, which shows an eagle grasping an olive branch in one talon, and a quiver of arrows in the other. The globe that General Eisenhower gave to Truman at the end of World War II is at the other end of the room, showing the importance of America’s global role. And then Truman’s voice hails visitors from speakers hidden in the replica: “I am glad you have come to this historical institution. You are very welcome. This is Harry S. Truman speaking. This room is an exact reproduction of the Presidential Office in the West Wing of the White House, as it was in the early 1950s. The furniture, the rug, and the drapes are duplicates of those 18\n\n5894_Cullinane and Ellis.indd 18\n\n04/10/18 3:38 PM\n\npresidential libraries and centers in use at the White House when I was president of the United States.” One afternoon when I was visiting the replica, a United States Marine and his family entered. As Truman’s voice described the reproduction of his Oval Office, a boy about eight years old told his uniformed father, “That’s Harry Truman!”15 But his father replied, “That’s not the president, son. That’s an actor.” In the midst of the largest collection of Truman materials and displays in the world, the sense that Truman’s real recorded voice would instead be an actor’s impersonation offered an insight. In presidential libraries, where simulations and real history are mixed, historical “truth” is disrupted as much as it is reinforced. It is noteworthy that the Truman Library’s Oval Office replica opened just two years after the first Disneyland in California. As one of my mentors, architectural historian Reyner Banham, wrote, “Disneyland was a set for a film that was never ever going to be made, except in the mind of the visitor.”16 This is essentially the appeal of an Oval Office replica. It is an empty set for tourists to visualize cinematic narratives of presidential power. The replica was so effective at drawing tourists that in the following decades additional Oval Office replicas were built at the Kennedy, Johnson, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, and George W. Bush libraries, each highlighting the story of its president with a copy of this famous room. President Kennedy introduced the next major innovation for presidential libraries by planning to affiliate his with his alma mater, Harvard University. After Kennedy’s death, some at Harvard decided they didn’t like the idea of tourists on their campus, since only one percent of visitors to presidential libraries are researchers. New York Times architecture critic Ada Louise Huxtable humorously lampooned Harvard’s fear of “Goths overwhelming the intelligentsia.”17 Harvard did establish the Kennedy School of Government, but the Kennedy Library itself was finally located at the University of Massachusetts, on a spectacular site overlooking Boston Harbor. The Kennedy Library was also the first to have a “starchitect,” when Jacqueline Kennedy chose I.M. Pei to design the building. Pei later designed the East Building of the National Gallery of Art, 19\n\n5894_Cullinane and Ellis.indd 19\n\n04/10/18 3:38 PM\n\nbenjamin hufbauer as well as the expansion of the Louvre. Originally, the Kennedy Library was going to be a large pyramid with the top cut off, representing JFK’s tragically truncated achievements, but eventually that plan was scrapped, and Pei reimagined the concept as the glass pyramid at the Louvre. Pei’s final design for the Kennedy Library is a futuristic glass, steel, and concrete edifice. President Lyndon Johnson, with Lady Bird’s help, also hired a starchitect for his library. Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill got LBJ’s orders to design “the best presidential library in the world.” This stark building, which is brutal and subtle at the same time, represents, as some who knew him say, Johnson’s own personality. Lady Bird had told LBJ that the Oval Office replica was the top draw for tourists at the Truman Library, but Bunshaft resisted. And so LBJ called him from the real Oval Office to demand a replica. The conversation, which took place on October 10, 1968, was secretly recorded by Johnson, who said: “That’s one of the basic things! [The Oval Office] is gonna be remembered . . . a lot more than some book up there [on] a shelf . . . !” One employee of the National Archives told me that, after retiring from the presidency, LBJ used his replica as his office sometimes: “Johnson could emerge from the door behind his desk into the replica and surprise visitors almost like the Wizard of Oz coming out from behind the curtains.”18 The grandest space inside the Johnson Library is the so-called “Great Hall of Achievement.” There is a spectacular display of some of the thousands of archival boxes that contain the circa 45 million pages of documents from Johnson’s career. In 1975, when Pulitzer-prize-winning historian Robert A. Caro first walked into the building to start work on his acclaimed multivolume biography of Johnson, he felt understandably daunted.19 The Johnson Library is to a large degree a shrine to Johnson’s ego, and to the imperial presidency, but Caro’s massive and often disturbing biography has shown that the access to the historical record that this architecture symbolizes is real. The most remarkable part of the building to me, which is not open to the public, is the private apartment for the Johnsons on the top floor. The Johnson suite is an elegant modernist space, with exquisite pieces of art on display. But it’s the chrome and 20\n\n5894_Cullinane and Ellis.indd 20\n\n04/10/18 3:38 PM\n\npresidential libraries and centers marble bathroom that is the most unusual feature. Inside the large travertine shower are four industrial-strength shower heads, which are like those that Johnson had installed in his real White House bathroom. This shower perplexed his successor President Richard Nixon on his first day in the White House, because “the thing was like a fire hose; it almost knocked him down.”20 As Johnson showered in his library and then dried himself off, mirrors all over the walls and ceilings of the bathroom reflected back his image, multiplied. Up until 1974, all presidential records were still private property. Although presidents had voluntarily donated their papers to their libraries, they could still edit or destroy parts of their records. They had not done so in any significant way until President Nixon, who resigned from office when his myriad abuses of power collectively known as Watergate came to light. Nixon intended to destroy many of his self-incriminating papers and recordings. Under this threat, Congress seized Nixon’s records, and then passed a law that made all future presidential records the property of the nation.21 Some might wonder whether presidential libraries make much of a difference to a president’s reputation. The short answer is that they do. President Jimmy Carter’s reputation, for example, was tarnished when he left office in 1981. But as the New York Times put it in a prescient headline in 1986: “Reshaped Carter Image Tied to Library Opening”—and today, Carter is one of the more respected former presidents.22 It was also Carter who first morphed the presidential library into a presidential center. The Carter Center, which is next to but administratively separate from the Carter Library and Museum in Atlanta, has been so effective at living up to its motto of “Waging Peace. Fighting Disease. Building Hope” that President Carter won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002. And it also helped when, at the Carter Library’s dedication in 1986, then-President Reagan showered Carter with praise; just as President Obama’s words for George W. Bush at the Bush Center’s dedication, where Obama spoke of Mr. Bush’s “incredible strength and resolve” as well as “his compassion and generosity,” seemingly gave an immediate boost to Mr. Bush’s poll numbers. Presidential libraries help former presidents rise above partisanship, enhancing their reputations. 21\n\n5894_Cullinane and Ellis.indd 21\n\n04/10/18 3:38 PM\n\nbenjamin hufbauer But most visitors to presidential libraries are not there to do research on a given president and his administration, but instead to make a visit to the museums. Here, the exhibits, not surprisingly, tend to amount to giant campaign commercials in museum form. This is true for presidents from both parties. When the Johnson Library first opened in 1971, for instance, there was little in the museum about the ongoing Vietnam War, and instead there was praise for LBJ and his “Great Society” programs. As Newsweek wrote in 1971: “Inside the Library the visage of LBJ is as ubiquitous as Chairman Mao’s in Peking.”23 The Nixon Library originally whitewashed Watergate (although the Watergate exhibit has been completely redone in recent years, and now has an accurate account overseen by historian Timothy Naftali). The Reagan Library originally ignored Iran-Contra (also fixed in recent years). Clinton still puts his own spin on his scandals, while the new George W. Bush Library contains bronze statues of the family dogs, but the accounts of our recent wars, Hurricane Katrina, and the Great Recession diverge from those found in history books. As the decades pass, and a president and his supporters pass away, the museums usually become more balanced and accurate. But it often takes forty to fifty years before that happens, and there are no guarantees even then. Presidential library museums have so much leeway to spin history in part because they open decades before archival records become available, and it is these archival records that can help prove (or disprove) the accuracy of museum exhibits. The number of records generated by the Executive Branch has exploded in the last several decades, but there has been insufficient funding for the archivists who must process these records for release. It will take up to 100 years to fully process and release the records of recent presidents. Former President Barack Obama, in announcing plans for the future Obama Center, admitted that presidential libraries and centers were ultimately about what he called presidential “ego-tripping.”24 But Mr. Obama offered no assurances that the Obama Presidential Center would refrain from the kind of spin of past presidential centers. The major innovation of the Obama Center—its separation from the National Archives, which, as 22\n\n5894_Cullinane and Ellis.indd 22\n\n04/10/18 3:38 PM\n\npresidential libraries and centers mentioned, runs the presidential libraries and centers from Herbert Hoover to George W. Bush—was a practical decision based on financial realities. By letting the National Archives house the Obama records in existing facilities, Mr. Obama saved tens of millions of dollars he would have needed to raise to build a new, first-class archive for the records of his administration. And, further, by being privately funded and operated, the Obama Presidential Center escapes from the new legal requirement passed by Congress, and applying for the very first time to President Obama, to raise an endowment equal to 60 percent of the initial construction costs of the complex. That change in law was enacted to help defray the cost to the federal government of maintaining the facility. The Obama Presidential Center will be the first to completely eliminate the historical records and research spaces that had previously been a key justification for the existence of presidential libraries. Without historians doing research there, what will take their place? According to Mr. Obama, there will be a hill constructed for sledding during the winter, a community center, a studio for people to record music, and a lecture program. To make the land for all this possible and provide parking, Cornell Drive, a six-lane road heavily used by Chicago commuters, will be permanently closed, leading to an unknown increase in commute times and traffic on other roads. But what will ultimately be achieved, according to Mr. Obama, is “not just one building,” but a setting “like a campus” devoted to “engaged citizenship.”25 It will almost certainly have a grand interactive museum devoted to the Obama administration; one that will create the impression that Mr. Obama rarely made mistakes in his political life. If so, it will be like other presidential libraries and centers that for eighty years have tended to the legacies and the egos of former presidents. Admitting that a core problem exists with presidential propaganda at presidential centers, as former presidents Clinton and Obama have done, is not the same as solving it. As presidential libraries have evolved and grown they have become a better deal for presidents, but it’s not clear that they are as good a deal for the public. Looking to the future we can say, like the motto under the sculpture in front of the National 23\n\n5894_Cullinane and Ellis.indd 23\n\n04/10/18 3:38 PM\n\nbenjamin hufbauer Archives, that “what is past is prologue.” In other words, presidential libraries are likely to become even more expensive, larger, and glitzier centers of spin in the future, perhaps reminding us of the poem “Ozymandias” by Percy Shelley: “My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings, Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!”\n\nNotes 1.

What does it mean to “read” the life of Washington as Royall Tyler suggests, to interpret a literary sketch authored by Theodore Roosevelt or to discern New Deal realpolitik in the private writings of a Matanuska Valley colonist?1 What do we discover of presidential legacy in Jefferson’s nod to Shakespeare, or Pound’s nod to Jefferson? In Reagan’s American Life, or Carter’s Keeping Faith?2 What does it entail, beyond politics of race or reason, for President Barack Obama to invoke Atticus Finch (“a great character in American fiction”) in his 2017 Farewell Address: “You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view, until you climb into his skin and walk around in it?” And what does it signify that “his” presides as a modifier to the legacy of life in office?3 These are the concerns of this chapter. The examination begins with a simple assertion that the broadly political phenomenon of presidential legacy is an inheritance of public memory, and in order to engage it rightly, I suggest, we must admit that memory is a great multiplicity of fictions, as well as a robust cultural voice of heritage. Interpretations of presidential leadership certainly appear in enough texts, either through presidential characters or metaphors for the executive office. One can think of William Wells Brown’s entropic novel Clotel; or The President’s Daughter (1853); L. Frank Baum’s The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900), which recalls the election of 1896; likewise Harper Lee’s admonition against “fear itself” in To Kill a Mockingbird (1960) repeats FDR’s famous adage; Gore Vidal’s critical history in 26\n\n5894_Cullinane and Ellis.indd 26\n\n04/10/18 3:38 PM\n\npresidential legacy: a literary problem An Evening with Richard Nixon (1972); Philip Roth’s provocative counter-imaging in The Plot Against America (2004); even Hamilton’s enrapt cast on presidential election and administration; or twenty-first-century Mexican American verse, casting slam rhyme to the border.4 Presidential legacy in statecraft, art, and memorial is, after all, the Technicolor at-home production of a wider transnational story, pictured in its character and office via cross-woven histories, narrative omissions, prevailing scripts, and constituent views of a watching and reading world. The aims of this chapter are threefold. Firstly, it will demonstrate that there is such a thing as presidential literary legacy and that a “literary-critical” reading of executive history invites more than popular consumption or political unmasking, but constitutes a process of image-making that is essential to legacy-building. Secondly, it identifies twinned notions of literary production and heritable succession as significant ideas central to the historical evolution of the presidency and executive office. Finally, it argues for a more nuanced narrative assessment of presidential scholarship as a multimodal and multivocal production over the long arc of United States history, angling for literature as a critical pattern and conduit of legacy in the national remembrance. It contends that a symphonic host of signifiers, fictive and real, inform presidential image-making and memorialization. Thereby, this study grounds itself in a return to Washington as the founder of this tradition, and derives constructive meaning from an under-examined civil suit from the Early Republic: Livingston v. Jefferson. This case, and the precedents set by Washington, set the tone for presidential legacy for centuries to come.\n\nReading presidential history Literary legacy offers new inroads into our evaluation of presidential history. The literary view operates at cross-reflective angles, observing and examining executive form and criticism so as to clarify and interconnect written texts and discourses, the substance of narrative and character, and the intricate interlacing of recorded fact with fiction. In the entries compiled in A New Literary History of America, editors Greil Marcus and Werner Sollors offer broad 27\n\n5894_Cullinane and Ellis.indd 27\n\n04/10/18 3:38 PM\n\nkristin a. cook scope for capturing its function, expanding traditional literary-critical bounds to contend that “what is at issue [in the new literary history of America] is speech, in many forms.”5 Literature provides rich and essential resources for investigating presidential legacy more intensively, for the executive office is, and has always been, a voiced creation of the will and consent of the people. And in wrestling history backwards to the founding bequest, to the first manner of legacy handed down by the first US president, we find good reason to pursue a literary excavation, not in material substance only, but by manner of rhetorical approach. For at the close of his own inaugural chapter, “we the people” are charged by Washington’s contemporaries, within the new national frame, with the high task of close presidential reading. Delivered in 1800, during the first contested presidential election and in the context of Washington’s passing, Royall Tyler published “An Oration, Pronounced . . . In Commemoration of the Death of General George Washington.” Tyler, a polymath who fought briefly in the Revolutionary War, served as a jurist in Vermont when the state was entered into the Union, and wrote a number of plays, exhorts “fathers, friends, and fellow citizens” to mourn the loss “of our political father.”6 Whilst turning “the historic page” to read the life of Washington, Tyler’s eulogy proclaims that “a thousand [moral] volumes are too few to teach us what is virtuous and honorable. But the life of WASHINGTON is a compendium of instruction. His life is a practical treatise of the cardinal virtues. Would you learn how to live? Read his life.”7 Tracing his tribute through a sequence of memorial conditions, Tyler asks “WOULD you possess that martial courage . . . WOULD you imitate that fortitude which sustains the hero . . . WOULD you learn . . . divine grace of forgiveness . . . WOULD you excel as farmers . . . Are you ambitious of serving your country with reputation in the civil grades of Society?” Each question is accompanied by concrete direction to “pass with WASHINGTON,” to “view WASHINGTON”, and to “follow WASHINGTON.” To see him in action would, Tyler assumed, lead Americans to copy his acts in glory: WOULD you possess that dignified virtue of equanimity, in the possession of Dictatorial power, and humility in the resignation of it? Pursue WASHINGTON to the tented field, and read his Resignation 28\n\n5894_Cullinane and Ellis.indd 28\n\n04/10/18 3:38 PM\n\npresidential legacy: a literary problem of his high Commission of Commander in Chief in the armies of the United States. WOULD you impress modesty, that seal of all the Virtues, upon all your actions? Peruse his official Letters. . . . remember how like the prophet Elijah he dropt his mantle upon us in his last legacy to the people. Would you learn the true interest of America? Study attentively this precious relic; and as you study, bless, gratefully bless, the sainted lips which pronounced it.8\n\nAmerica’s republican etymology is established here by virtue and name of its common founder. For insofar as we are permitted by Tyler to read, to peruse, to study the life of Washington, the national community is directly called upon to interpret its representatives rightly as against this original and professed saintly form. The “true interest of America,” as Tyler makes plain, would be forever embalmed in close relation to Washington’s life, adhering tightly to the character of his office. “If only,” as Tyler laments, “mankind were appointed to immortality!” But as mortal sorrow is certain, he projects, such heritage must be preserved in trust by the living—accessible to citizens in each generation so as to protect the “transmitting down entire, those sacred rights which WASHINGTON obtained.”9 As soon as we introduce the concept of legacy we necessarily admit, as in Tyler’s conjuring, any number of heightened and potentially dangerous attributes of myth, where prevailing and disparate politics contend with realms of truth. Approached this way, such eulogistic imagery becomes the stuff of literary affect, emotive appeal aimed at personifying new national urgencies of socio-political construction. Tyler’s performative American mythology promotes and distends an ostensibly circumscribed governing narrative, issuing a grammatical framework for republican growth that slides into realms of legend. The presidential myth itself, however, as herein contextualized and passed down in our remembrance of Washington, is neither dissociated from reality nor static in its heritable value, but in its imaging of family resemblance and “property” bequeathed accentuates its own variable shape, and assumes the power to disavow strict limits. Presidential form—the stature and reach of Washington, the first man in office—is rendered contentious and complex in light of 29\n\n5894_Cullinane and Ellis.indd 29\n\n04/10/18 3:38 PM\n\nkristin a. cook changing “civil grades” and civic reception that must be assumed through the outplaying of United States history, the fickle inclusivity of “we” as people, audience, and judge of the past and present. The presidential subject of Tyler’s modern mythology is seen to inhere not in logical chains of falsehood or truth, but in a mobile and movable quality found in living personifications that endure as transformative social and political realities, enacted by diverse community networks. The enduring substance of mythoi, composed over long presidential history, thus highlights the varied and specious powers of fiction, yielding new interpretive problems for scholars of presidential history. Presidential legacy refers after all to a perpetually twinned genealogy, where the legacy of “Mr. President” is ever contoured through the legacy of the office itself. As Tyler demonstrates in his eulogy, fiction in both respects is unavoidable: the character of the man is bound to his office, and his office to the substance of a charactered story. What is more, the fiction of presidential unity may well be the cost of political power. As Tyler suggests, a stable American democracy is a “suspended” reality, a “majestic” idea, a myth of E Pluribus Unum personified in the role of chief executive. A president is woven into the office, and Washington into his successors. That process inculcates “a lasting sense” of shared values in the national imagining and generates in perpetuity something akin to F. Scott Fitzgerald’s “willingness of the heart.”10 As Fitzgerald conceives it in his modernist short story “The Swimmers” (1929), this willingness to secure the dream of America is harbored in “that quality of the idea” that while holding its own as a fictive unity nevertheless appears set adrift at times from the historied source(s) of its making: “they [his expatriate Americans] go elsewhere and push other water. They spend months in France and they couldn’t tell you the name of the President.”11 As evident in the grammar of Washington’s Farewell Address, this projected quality of the American will is no less bound to its presidential heritage and genealogy than it is intertwined with the mobile and variegated makeup of the people, who “with slight shades of difference” and distance, nevertheless command “a persuasive language” of individual liberty and “the continuance of 30\n\n5894_Cullinane and Ellis.indd 30\n\n04/10/18 3:38 PM\n\npresidential legacy: a literary problem the [national] Union” as one political ideal.12 How this conceit is transmitted from one generation to the next, who has the power of that transmission, and how it is interpretatively received, as Washington suggests, is the continuing problem of governance; whether at home or abroad, the political strength of the executive office is seen to rely on this imagining.13 And so in deciphering presidential myth as something manufactured, we mark those moments where man and office fail to integrate and inter-dissolve, and where narrative legacy takes shape in sharp and contrastive measures, despite or in reaction to protest, party, or faction, distance or displacement; or in splits and fissures, as with Washington himself, who while privileging the myth of office nevertheless sought to divest himself of personal fame in its glory.14 While interpreting presidential pasts in the trajectory of legacy, such disavowals must be consulted; democratic engagement must be taken into account; the performance must be assessed.15 The written-ness of political history, the agency of literature, the changing methods of cross-generational transmission, and the “warm interest” of character development must be substantively explored, using critical methods of deep literary anthropology.16 For this reason, “literary legacy” concedes a blurring of the bounds between the real and the imagined and discovers in their overlapping conceits, as Royall Tyler relates, our present “compendium of instruction.”17 This idea is echoed among Tyler’s nineteenth-century contemporaries (those who urged him to publish his “Oration,” as well as in common biographical productions and poetics of Washington remembrance) and among earlier transatlantic students of Enlightenment thought.18 Thomas Jefferson, for instance, conceptualized this in his “literary” common-place book and vivified the overlap in his library catalog prescribed to a fellow Virginian in 1771, where “Hume’s History of England,” “Blackstone’s Commentaries,” “Ld. Kaim’s Principles of Equity,” “Bolingbroke’s Philosophical Works”, and publications by Montesquieu, Sidney, and Locke sit beside entries by Shakespeare, Congreve, Smollett, Richardson, Chaucer, and Swift.19 Offering his thoughts on the formation of a private library, Jefferson here underscores the conflation of history writing and the fictive, ascribing the moral value of one’s lived 31\n\n5894_Cullinane and Ellis.indd 31\n\n04/10/18 3:38 PM\n\nkristin a. cook inheritance to the natural correspondence between the actual and the conceived. “Considering history as a moral exercise, her lessons would be too unfrequent if confined to real life. Of those recorded by historians few incidents have been attended with such circumstances as to excite in any high degree this sympathetic emotion of virtue. We are therefore wisely framed,” he counsels: to be as warmly interested for a fictitious as for a real personage. The spacious field of imagination is thus laid open to our use, and lessons may be formed to illustrate and carry home to the mind every moral rule of life. Thus a lively and lasting sense of filial duty is more effectually impressed on the mind of a son or daughter by reading King Lear, than by all the dry volumes of ethics and divinity that ever were written. This is my idea of well-written Romance, of Tragedy, Comedy, and Epic Poetry.20\n\nAlthough the history of American self-making undergoes a dramatic shift with time from early trepidation over moral effects to later modernist concerns with psychological division, such dual interest “for a fictitious as for a real personage” presents itself as an “instructive” and “illustrative” continuance over the long arc of national remembrance, relevant to the study of practical authority in presidential legacy today.21 Hence Jefferson’s notion persists, we might say, in Obama’s allusion to the fictional Atticus Finch, calling US citizens to social forbearance via sympathetic conceit; or in his autobiographical Dreams from My Father (1995), which finds its near relation, as has been said, in Ralph Ellison’s Invisible Man (1952).22 The fact that political “instruction” persists via paternal mandate, as it were, from the origins of presidential history regenerates the myth of the presidential bequest as itself a patrilineal conveyance, instantiating a form of executive governance that prevails at odds with modern democratic nation-building. “He [Washington] was the father of the country,” sounds Tyler, “good men . . . like the children of one great family, are come to weep over their father’s grave.”23 Such rhetoric arms the “call to sons” that then concludes his Oration and privileges the gendered course of the presidential line to date: “if, perchance, your homes salute you with a father’s honored name,” 32\n\n5894_Cullinane and Ellis.indd 32\n\n04/10/18 3:38 PM\n\npresidential legacy: a literary problem he exhorts, “go, call your sons, tell them of WASHINGTON; instruct them what a debt they owe their ancestors and vest them executors of his will.”24 Our twenty-first-century reading of presidential history intertextually maps and intercalates this literary field of performed and recurring values. The most obvious channels of literary legacy thus include all matter of written document and compilation: letters, papers, diaries, notebooks, and correspondence; biographies and memoirs; travel accounts, postcards, and sketches. Literary legacy includes a smattering of campaign slogans such as Harrison’s “Tippecanoe and Tyler Too,” Obama’s “Hope,” or Wilson’s “He proved the pen mightier than the sword.” It might invite transcripts of presidential recordings, such as the Johnson and Nixon tapes; or it might admit the lyrics of 2016 Nobel poet laureate Bob Dylan: “But even the president of the United States / Sometimes must have to stand naked.”25 It might include a bubbled collection of cartoon straplines, or invite Ed Murrow’s Allied on-air journalism; it might incorporate William Manchester’s Portrait of a President or Death of a President, or George W. Bush’s later presidential citation.26 Or it might comprise a multitude of fictional, poetic, and dramatic works; the nineteenth-century Anglo-French plays featuring General George Washington; Washington Irving’s supposed caricature of Jefferson in the person of William-the-Testy in A History of New York, published in 1809; Hawthorne’s The Life of Franklin Pierce—a “generally correct narrative” published by Ticknor, Reed, and Fields in 1852; or Ezra Pound’s intensive modernist Cantos, mythologizing the presidency by fragments and memorializing John Adams in poetic dialogue with Adams’s original letters.27 Certainly there is a wealth of discourse to be found in sermonwriting and song, together with that competing array of circulating texts and broadsides read, gifted, written, and arbitrated by family members, campaign hopefuls, lobbyists, judges, and emissaries, orbiting in constellation around the business of office. Literary legacy is to be increasingly derived as well from an alternate virtual cloud of texts, symbols, and signs, whereby presidential terms are nominated, reconstituted, and reinforced via cross-generational habits, diplomatic forums, and nation branding. 33\n\n5894_Cullinane and Ellis.indd 33\n\n04/10/18 3:38 PM\n\nkristin a. cook A utopian scripted “Pledge of Allegiance” adopted by Congress in 1945 under FDR fits, or the version amended in 1954 to include “under God” in Eisenhower’s term. The inaugural address, the State of the Union, the Oath, mass media coverage, “Twitter diplomacy”, and press reports, or the language of Article II whereby the role is foundationally prescribed, all belong to literary-critical assessment. Pursuing such signs into the abstract, we might recur to French theorist Jean Baudrillard’s postmodernist tour through what he referred to in the 1980s as an “astral” America, emptying all such signifiers into vast emptiness and simulation, while probing US power or “the Reagan mirage”: “As for American reality,” he writes, “even the face-lifted variety retains its vast scope, its tremendous scale . . . All societies end up wearing masks. Why not the mask of Reagan? But what remains intact is what there was at the beginning: space and the spirit of fiction.”28 From our present stance, then, which heralds a multimodal and polyvocal American Studies, and an American literary studies more particularly, we can look on this potentially discordant array of texts, performances, and discourses as joint constituents of a new American literary history, in the grand sense of Marcus and Sollors, and we might say with some certainty that “presidential literary legacy” of course incorporates all these things.29\n\nExecutive proceedings Turning to a close reading of presidential history, and moving ahead two terms from Washington’s administration, it becomes apparent that the diverse texts and discourses which shape our understanding of Thomas Jefferson’s actions as the nation’s third president, when read in constellation, serve to demonstrate the effects of literary legacy at work, permitting us to recover certain pockets, breaks, and omissions in the narrative account. Two stanzas from William Lambert’s “Ode for the Fourth of July, 1810” set the problem and tone: Let Jefferson who lately fill’d The president’s exalted seat, For wisdom fam’d, in science skill’d\n\n34\n\n5894_Cullinane and Ellis.indd 34\n\n04/10/18 3:38 PM\n\npresidential legacy: a literary problem Our praise and approbation meet, Hail Columbia, &c. Detraction’s rude and pois’nous tongue Against his worth has spread its sound;— The peals of envy may be rung, But all these arts we shall confound. Hail Columbia, &c.30\n\nA literary-critical approach to Jefferson’s early nineteenth-century dispute over the Louisiana Batture (a massive alluvial deposit along the Mississippi River that challenged territorial law and development in the young nation) allows us not only to unearth forgotten histories, but to reclaim notable erasures and rhetorical gaps as sites of new memory—as fertile grounds for reconstituting Jefferson’s legacy of individual action, as well as for deepening our treatment of the historiographical evolution of the presidential office.31 The matter of Livingston v. Jefferson evolved from a civil suit filed against Thomas Jefferson on May 16, 1810, and illustrates in both legal and literary terms the compositional friction that joins Jefferson the private man with the public man in his presidential office.32 Governed by numerous pleadings over justification, judicial precedent, and jurisdiction, the suit, though filed by the plaintiff in a federal circuit court in Virginia, threatened years of local New Orleans custom and intensified a set of national socio-political disputes over the emerging role and character of the executive.33 The case commenced following a presidential action instigated by Jefferson at the request of Louisiana territorial governor William Claiborne in 1807, forcing the removal of private citizen Edward Livingston from beachfront property that had accumulated as deposit along the banks of the Mississippi River—a piece of land referred to in French as the Batture of the Faubourg Ste Marie, or more generally, the batture, or alluvion. Livingston had commenced construction on the riverbank after acquiring an ownership interest in a parcel of the land through a decision by the court in 1805.34 Local New Orleans residents responded with outrage to Livingston’s works and urged Governor Claiborne to intervene,\n\n35\n\n5894_Cullinane and Ellis.indd 35\n\n04/10/18 3:38 PM\n\nkristin a. cook demanding that he arrest building procedures and restore the batture to the public use. Unable to settle the conflict locally, Claiborne petitioned Washington for support, and Jefferson responded to the crisis by asking then Secretary of State James Madison to involve the US Marshal. Livingston was subsequently forced from the site. Following Livingston’s eviction, and only after Jefferson had retired from office, Livingston sued Jefferson for $100,000, arguing his right to the alluvial land by asserting title to the adjacent property. This initiated a case against the government and against the public that would persist in variable form for well over a decade. Livingston’s 1810 petition, as examined here, would fail on December 5, 1811 for lack of proper jurisdiction.35 Notwithstanding the anticlimax, Livingston v. Jefferson suffered a literary post-mortem in publications rendered by both parties, principally Jefferson’s “Proceedings of the [United States] government,” a lengthy analysis of federal action, presidential decision, and law, and Livingston’s subsequent “Answer to Mr. Jefferson’s Justification,” an incensed exposition—each one attending to the case on its merits and devoted to substantive explications of legal theory and fact.36 Overburdened with pleadings, both real and fictitious, and heavy with legalese of a French, Spanish, and now American case law, the Batture matter proved “frightfully complicated,” as one historian writes, and is generally swept into footnotes on the Louisiana Purchase, mentioned in civil procedure case briefs under the “local action” rule, or produced as an aside to Marbury v. Madison.37 Unlike the Sally Hemings scandal, which has been so widely contextualized as to render it almost consistently inconsistent in the Jefferson narrative, Livingston has been routinely hung backstage, shielded in some respect from public scrutiny. In the words of nineteenth-century US Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story, “Who . . . can remember, without regret, [Jefferson’s] conduct in relation to the batture of New Orleans?”38 Or as twenty-first-century critic Ronan Degnan affirms: [I do] not dispute that Thomas Jefferson was a great national hero whose memory is properly revered to this day. Still, if all one knew about Jefferson was his conduct in the matter of the New Orleans batture and his treatment of Edward Livingston, a different conclusion would emerge, a portrait of a petty politician and a contriver 36\n\n5894_Cullinane and Ellis.indd 36\n\n04/10/18 3:38 PM\n\npresidential legacy: a literary problem extraordinaire who was not at all above manipulating the federal judiciary to serve his own selfish purposes. I end still admiring Jefferson, but less ardently . . .39\n\nDegnan’s summary hedges its bets against a simple hero-donefall scenario by folding the matter into the silhouette of Jefferson immemorial, but reading the case in full permits conflicting narratives to surface. Although dismissed before a trial on the merits, two accounts appear throughout the course of the proceedings that instantiate our current concerns: firstly as to Jefferson’s executive action, and secondly as to his presidential character. Venting reason on both fronts, Livingston and Jefferson deploy deep literary-critical and literary-inventive techniques to argue legal principle and to test executive action in form.\n\nExecutive action An analysis of rhetorical strategy reveals a stark contest in the affair over the nature and reach of presidential authority, with Livingston arguing that he was “violently dispossessed [of the alluvion] by the orders of the President of the United States” and Jefferson countering that Livingston acted “in defiance of the general right of the nation.”40 “It became my duty, as charged with the preservation of public property,” Jefferson states, “to remove the intrusion, and to maintain the citizens of the United States in their right to a common use of that beach.”41 In his Proceedings, Jefferson’s seizure of the batture is argued to have been in keeping with the executive’s “right to abate” a nuisance or danger to the city of New Orleans, where presidential authority was exercised commensurate with his duty to protect the common good. The “character & office” of the president is rhetorically figured in Jefferson’s defence via procedural dialogue with the public safety and right, and is established in legal terms as a conjoined democratic agent of the nation’s will and charge. The “Plea in Livingston v. Jefferson on Ground of Acting Officially” reads as follows: . . . the said Thomas . . . in the year 1807 aforesaid, being then and long before and since President of the said United States, in order to perform his duty as president aforesaid, according to his judgment and 37\n\n5894_Cullinane and Ellis.indd 37\n\n04/10/18 3:38 PM\n\nkristin a. cook conscience, did acting solely & exclusively in his character & office of President aforesaid, without any malice against the said Edward, direct the Marshal of the said territory, to remove, in the name & for the benefit of the United States, from the said lands messuage [sic] and Close aforesaid, any and every person, who Should have taken possession thereof or of any part thereof . . .42\n\n“But how is he,” demands Livingston in his “Answer,” “in whom the executive power is vested . . . to ascertain that which belongs to the public, what to the individual occupying it? . . . Whenever, then, he [Jefferson] erroneously thinks, or wickedly affects to think, that land in my possession belongs to the public, the president may order a regiment of dragoons to drive me from it at the point of a sabre.”43 Opposing Jefferson’s plea, Livingston decries the malicious and perceived unconstitutional exercise of that executive power in force: “Answer: My works did not threaten to drown the city. Mathematical proof of the fact. Mr. J. not high Constable of New Orleans. Local law sufficient to prevent and local authorities to abate nuisances.” Livingston further denounces Jefferson’s avowedly presidential conduct by accusing him of secret motives in forcing his removal: “why did he select my batture from so many others equally situated?” He also accuses Jefferson of undermining the dignity of his presidential office, of mistranslating records, exercising illegal authority, and “coquetting” political colleagues “over to his opinion.” Jefferson’s “declamation [was] calculated to excite prejudices against me,” Livingston contends, so as to set “his own [unlawful] justification” in false relief against a profoundly “disliked” and “unpopular” individual: “Humane conclusion that I deserved to be committed to the flames.”44 Livingston’s fiery invective wends its way through Jefferson’s nuanced argument for US title in the batture, sequenced through disputed territorial law and code, before folding itself into a so-called “Pathetic” appeal in the following verse by Spenser: Ah! little knowest thou, who hast not try’d, What hell it is, in suing long to bide, To lose good days that might be better spent,\n\n38\n\n5894_Cullinane and Ellis.indd 38\n\n04/10/18 3:38 PM\n\npresidential legacy: a literary problem To pass long nights in passive discontent . . . To eat thy heart through comfortless despair; To fawn, to crouch, to wait, to ride, to run, To spend, to give, to want, to be undone; Unhappy wight! Such hard fate doom’d to try; That curse God send unto mine enemy.45\n\nThis fictive turn, though couched as an aside, bears weight in our analysis for what it suggests in our reading of Jefferson’s actions and for how it braces our comprehension of image-making in presidential legacy more broadly. For in his emotive plea for relief, Livingston attempts to amend his own widely “unpopular” political identity by invoking a moralizing poetics, compelling shared understanding for his plight by urging positive re-evaluation of his suit and detracting from his opposition through imagined cords of (woeful) self-identification. His discursive attempts to realign the public sympathy in his favor are thus significant for their plausible effect in not only challenging Jefferson’s narrative claims to constitutionality but in sharpening public expectations of executive political engagement, particularly as to the president’s mediation of the contest between individual rights and social democratic protections. Recurring to similar conceits, Jefferson too goads the public sentiment through strategic literary appeal, employing fictive analogy and Shakespearean comedy in his “Proceedings” so as to vilify Livingston’s self-interest in the matter, such that his own legacy of individual action, read across both works, is fashioned in the public eye at the interface between competing fictions.46 Somewhat unsurprisingly, then, the problem of executive role-play in the affair is centralized, in an arch character, with respect to presidential accountability. Livingston faults Mr. J. for incriminating the members of his Cabinet Council by drawing advisers into the suit to shoulder the weight of his personal responsibility. Not only that, Livingston contends, but Jefferson desired those “servants . . . who committed the trespass” (the government on the ground, as it were) to be “made parties to the suit” for his individual actions in the affair. “The president of the United States wished the innocent ministers of his illegal acts to be made fellow-sufferers with him, for executing his\n\n39\n\n5894_Cullinane and Ellis.indd 39\n\n04/10/18 3:38 PM\n\nkristin a. cook orders!!” Livingston exclaims. From this the plaintiff extrapolates to allege a despotic and royal manner by which Jefferson confused though sheer art of “plurality” the role of President with all other political capacities—“We were called,” Jefferson avers, and as Livingston objects: As LEGISLATOR, he was to make a new law to fit the circumstances of the case; as JUDGE, he was to apply to it those facts which as a JUROR he was to ascertain, and to pronounce that sentence which, as EXECUTIVE OFFICER he was himself to carry into effect; as PRESIDENT, he was to reclaim the lands of the United States; as COMMANDER IN CHIEF of the armies, a sufficient military force was to be prepared to over-awe opposition; . . . as MAYOR . . . ; as HIGH CONSTABLE . . . ; as STREET COMMISSIONER . . . [etc.].47\n\nThat Livingston accommodated Alexander Hamilton’s views in these instances (an arrow sharply barbed) concerning powers to be delegated to the executive branch, called into play an intensive dialogue over the manner in which power should be divided within the federal government. And in a rhetorical maneuver designed to shift the weight of blame onto Jefferson alone, Livingston’s language exploited Hamilton’s suggestion in Federalist 70 that the “multiplication of the executive tends to conceal faults and destroy responsibility.”48 Despite Livingston’s attempts to deconstruct Jefferson, the late president continued to defend his conduct on the batture as the appropriate outworking of a constitutionally governed Executive, acting in its principal role as chief guardian of the public right. And in a tone reminiscent of Paine (“there is something exceedingly ridiculous”), he challenged the absurdity of Livingston’s suit: were the Executive, in the vast mass of concerns of first magnitude, which he must direct, to place his whole fortune, on the hazard of every opinion; . . . in short were every man engaged in rendering service to the public bound in his body and goods to indemnification for all his errors, [then] we must commit our public affairs to the paupers of the nation, to the sweepings of hospitals and poor-houses, who, having nothing to lose, would have nothing to risk.49\n\n40\n\n5894_Cullinane and Ellis.indd 40\n\n04/10/18 3:38 PM\n\npresidential legacy: a literary problem Although Livingston contends that even “a plea of honest error” in this “vast mass of concerns” cannot afford a “general excuse” for executive officers, Jefferson’s construction usefully prefigures the problem arising as to sovereign immunity from civil suit: “Great God!” wrote John Adams, “Is a President of the US to be Subject to a private Action of every Individual? This will soon introduce the Axiom that a President can do no wrong; or another equally curious that a President can do no right.”50 Although presidential immunity is not raised as a question of law in the suit, and finds no ruling until later in the century, the issue finds expressive figure here, and churns in literary conceit below the surface of the case.51\n\nPresidential character Implicit in Jefferson’s published “Proceedings,” then, is a fascinating character defence whereby Jefferson effectively retrieves his fragmented public self-image in order to bind apparent inconsistencies. “Recurring to the tenor of a long life of public service,” he writes, “against the charge of malice and corruption I stand conscious and erect.”52 In circulating his argument to key political supporters and members of Congress, Jefferson redresses probable gaps in his exercise of power by inventing new rhetorical linkages—legal, moral, and political—with a host of like minded thinkers, including fellow men of letters. In such manner, he positions (or wrongfully manipulates, as some allege) those who might acquit him on appeal and authors a countervailing history of presidential action in text, character, and form. His “exposition of the Batture question,” declares William Wirt, “is by far the best piece of Grecian architecture that I have ever seen, either from modern or ancient times.”53 A return from Elbridge Gerry reads as follows: I thank you for the pamphlet this day received, respecting “the intrusion of Edward Livingston”; & for your polite & friendly manner of transmitting it. The publick is much indebted to you on this, & on numerous other occasions, for performances; to which few are equal, & still fewer have a disposition.54\n\n41\n\n5894_Cullinane and Ellis.indd 41\n\n04/10/18 3:38 PM\n\nkristin a. cook And from his predecessor, President John Adams, a vote of confidence by reverse character detraction:"
