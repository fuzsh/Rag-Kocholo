        "text": "You’ve been blogging since 2002. How has the blogosphere changed in the last 9 years?\n\nI feel like people care much more about the material things — the free stuff, the trips, the awards. When I started blogging, I didn’t have comments or ads. I just blogged to tell my stories. The other stuff is nice, but if you don’t like telling stories, I don’t really see the point in blogging at all.\n\nWhat do you love most about blogging?\n\nThe most rewarding part of my blog is knowing that I am reaching people. When I write something that resonates with readers, be it something embarrassing that happened to me or dealing with my kids or grief, I feel a sense of accomplishment that I never had at a “traditional” job.\n\nIs there anything you dislike about blogging?\n\nI think there is sometimes silly jealousy toward the success of others, which I don’t understand. One woman’s success means we ALL succeed.\n\nCan you tell me a little more about your experience as a professional toilet breaker?\n\nWell, it’s a gift. I have broken seats, clogged pipes and broken handles off of numerous public and private toilets. It’s a lot easier than you’d think to break a toilet. You just have to really put your mind to it.\n\nYou are a panelist at Momversation, weighing in on all kinds of fascinating topics. What has been the most controversial topic you’ve discussed and/or the subject that was the most difficult to decide how you felt about it?\n\nI love being a part of Momversation — we talk about a vast array of subjects that always keep me on my toes. I think the most controversial topic I participated in was about vaccines and autism. The viewers were VERY vocal and opinionated about the topic. Playing moderator was difficult, but proved extremely rewarding when the majority of people were able to keep the discussion civil.\n\nWhat is your greatest dream? For yourself, your family, the world?\n\nFor myself — to find the balance I need to be a successful blogger, parent and wife.\n\nFor my family — to be as happy as possible.\n\nFor the world — peace, love and an apple pie for everyone.\n\nMore on mom bloggers"
