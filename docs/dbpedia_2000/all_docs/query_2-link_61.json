        "text": "Renowned bassist Harold Hall Robinson, the A. Margaret Bok Chair in Double Bass Studies at Curtis, was recently announced as the recipient of the 2023 Distinguished Achievement Award by the International Society of Bassists (ISB). The award recognizes bassists who have contributed their special skills, knowledge, projects and other positive works in furthering the ISB’s mission to inspire, educate, and connect.\n\nMr. Robinson served as principal bass for The Philadelphia Orchestra from 1995 to his retirement in 2022. He previously was principal bass with the National Symphony (1985–95), assistant principal bass of the Houston Symphony (1977–85), and principal bass of the New Mexico Symphony (1975–77, then known as the Albuquerque Symphony). A prizewinner at the 1982 Isle of Man Solo Competition, he has performed concertos with The Philadelphia Orchestra, the Houston Symphony and Houston Pops, the New York Philharmonic, and many other prestigious orchestras.\n\nAdditionally, the ISB has announced the recipients of its Special Recognition Awards. Of the ten honorees for 2023, Curtis double bass alumni Dr. Heather Miller Lardin (’96) won scholarship and recognition for historically informed performance and Joseph Conyers (’04) received special merit.\n\nRead the official announcement HERE.\n\nPhoto of Mr. Robinson courtesy of the Strad and Pete Checchia here at Curtis."
