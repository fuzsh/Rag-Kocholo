Quasimodo, the deformed bell-ringer, observes all of Paris reveling in the Feast of Fools, but he is held captive by his devious caretaker, the archdeacon Dom Claude Frollo. He escapes for the day and joins the boisterous crowd, only to be treated cruelly by all but the beautiful gypsy, Esmeralda. Quasimodo isn’t the only one captivated by her free spirit, though — the handsome Captain Phoebus and Frollo are equally enthralled. As the three vie for her attention, Frollo embarks on a mission to destroy the gypsies and it’s up to Quasimodo to save them all. In 1999, the musical premiered as Der Glöckner von Notre Dame in Berlin. Parental discretion is advised. Victor Hugo’s novel contains mature themes and situations, which may be distressing for young viewers.\n\nLocation: Corbett Auditorium\n\nTickets: Purchase tickets online.

But ethnomusicology is only one of several networks of circulation, including colonial administration, cultural diplomacy, educational ideology and prison rehabilitation, that have facilitated the movement and reinterpretation of the ensemble and its music outside of Indonesia. In this lecture, Maria Mendonça explores the ways in which the ensemble and its music has been reimagined and localized in Britain, drawing on her recent ethnographic film project Gamelan Encounters (2017).\n\nLocation: Baur Room\n\nAdmission: FREE\n\n____\n\n2 p.m. Sunday, Oct. 22\n\n• Guest Artist Series •\n\nAdrienne Danrich, soprano\n\nMarcus Küchle and Lydia Brown, pianist s\n\nCCM welcomes the return of alumna Adrienne Danrich (MM Voice, 1995) for this special 150th Anniversary guest artist recital.\n\nLocation: Robert J.

One of those structures is the set of incommensurable preferences: citing Martha Nussbaum’s The Fragility of Goodness, Desai finds this set embedded in notions of what makes for a good life. In this talk, Murphy demonstrates that this set also undergirds many stylistic aspects of Western classical tonal music, in direct contradiction to a prevailing trend in music-theoretical research. From this perspective, defaults such as major-minor tonality and four-part textures emerge as solutions.\n\nLocation: Baur Room\n\nAdmission: FREE\n\n____\n\n7:30 p.m. Friday, Nov. 17\n\n• Orchestra Series •\n\nSCHUBERT, STRAVINSKY AND BEETHOVEN\n\nCCM Philharmonia\n\nMark Gibson, music director\n\nAik Khai Pung, conductor\n\nSCHUBERT: Overture to “Rosamunde”\n\nSTRAVINSKY: Pulcinella Suite\n\nBEETHOVEN: Symphony No. 4 in B-Flat Major, Op. 60\n\nLocation: Walnut Hills High School, 3250 Victory Parkway, Cincinnati, OH 45207\n\nAdmission: FREE\n\n­­­____\n\n7 p.m. Saturday, Nov. 18\n\n• Starling Series •\n\nStarling Chamber Orchestra\n\nKurt Sassmannshaus, music director\n\nShowcasing the superbly talented young students from the Starling Preparatory String Project.\n\nLocation: Robert J.
