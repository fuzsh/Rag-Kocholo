        "text": "Centenary of the end o the Great War: Public lectures and talks by Professor David Stevenson\n\nThis month, Professor Stevenson gave several talks to commemorate the centenary of the end of the Great War. On 7 November, he spoke at Gresham College, Museum of London, on \"The Ending of World War I: The Road to 11 November\". His lecture re-examined how the First World War ended. Watch a recording of the event on YouTube. The following day, he gave a talk about \"The Road to the Eleventh of November: How the First World War Ended\" at the Loughton and District Historical Society, of which he now presides. Later in the month, on 13 November, he spoke on “The Armistice - Marking the 100 Years” in an event hosted by the Buckhurst Hill Residents' Society.\n\nDr Megan Black's new book: out now!\n\nDr Megan Black newest book, The Global Interior: Mineral Frontiers and American Power, was released by Harvard University Press this month. The Global Interior provides a detailed analysis of how, throughout the twentieth century and into the twenty-first, the US Department of the Interior cultivated and exploited its image as an innocuous scientific-research and environmental-management organisation in order to drive and satisfy America's insatiable demand for raw materials. Interior continues to operate in indigenous lands by coal mining and oil leasing, it pushes the boundaries of territoriality through offshore drilling, and in the guise of sharing expertise with the underdeveloped world, it has led lithium surveys in Afghanistan, among other activities abroad. Indeed, Interior is more than global: the department now manages a satellite that prospects natural resources in outer space!\n\nInterview in student-led sixth-form magazine with Professor David Stevenson\n\nA student-led publication by Bishop Stopford School, Reflections Magazine, interviewed Professor David Stevenson for the October issue in a feature entitled “Philosophy and War: How could we let this happen?”. Professor Stevenson discusses important themes such as the significance of the year 1917 (drawing from his latest monograph), the greatest impact of the First World War, and how the First World War should be commemorated and taught in the future. He is also prompted about what his advice would be to aspiring historians: “Read. Find out more about it. Use as many different means as possible to access the past. The internet is the key now to get a flavour of all types of history. Get an overview and find out about as many time periods, places and topics as possible. Read as much as you can about as many different things as you can”. Reflections Magazine is supported by a dedicated number of sixth formers, each with specific curriculum subject editorial responsibilities. Read the full interview.\n\nDr Padraic X. Scanlan's Freedom's Debtors wins second book prize\n\nCongratulations to Dr Padraic X. Scanlan for winning the American Historical Association’s James A. Rawley Book Prize 2018 for his debut monograph Freedom’s Debtors: British Antislavery in Sierra Leone in the Age of Revolution (Yale University Press, 2017). The James A. Rawley Prize in Atlantic History was created in 1998. It is offered annually to recognize outstanding historical writing that explores aspects of integration of Atlantic worlds before the 20th century. Earlier in the year, the Canadian Historical Association had also awarded Dr Padraic X. Scanlan's book its Wallace K. Ferguson Prize, which recognises outstanding scholarly books in a field of history other than Canadian history. Freedom’s Debtors offers insight into how the success of British anti-slavery policies were used to justify colonialism in Africa. British anti-slavery, widely seen as a great sacrifice of economic and political capital on the altar of humanitarianism, was in fact profitable, militarily useful, and crucial to the expansion of British power in West Africa.\n\nDr Joanna Lewis and Dr Jack Hogan present at British Academy-funded workshop in South Africa\n\nAssociate Professor Dr Joanna Lewis and LSE Fellow Dr Jack Hogan, historians of Colonial Africa, presented at a British Academy-funded international workshop in South Africa on 11 October. The workshop, “Connecting the Local and the Global in Nineteenth Century Southern Africa” took place between 9 and 11 October and was jointly hosted by the International Studies Group, University of the Free State, and the University of Dundee in Scotland. Dr Lewis delivered one of the keynote lectures, entitled “The Pathetic Death of Bwana Ingeleshi: Late 19th Century British Imperialisms in South-Central Africa and the Graveyard of Ambition”. The lecture was based on two chapters in her recently released monograph Empire of Sentiment on the death and myth of David Livingstone. Dr Jack Hogan participated in a panel on “Sinews of Globalisation: Digital Humanities and Precolonial African History”, pitching his potential upcoming project with the Institute of Historical Research.\n\nProfessor Paul Preston historical advisor in French documentary\n\nProfessor Paul Preston appeared extensively in a new French documentary, called “Les Derniers Jours de Franco” [“The Last Days of Franco”], which aired on 21 October at 22:30 on France 5. The documentary tells the story of how Franco divided, and continues to divide, Spain well past his death on 20 November 1975, after over 40 years of dictatorship. The ghost of Franco continues to haunt Spain, with the recent Catalan crisis awakening old antagonisms, and Barcelona accusing Madrid of Francoist sympathies. Carles Puigdemont, former president of Catalonia (2016-17), provides a testimony in the film. The film also includes other testimonies of those who rubbed shoulders with the Caudillo and those who fought against him. Ultimately, this documentary attempts to break the Spanish divide over Franco.\n\nDr Kristina Spohr welcomed as Inaugural Helmut Schmidt Professor at John Hopkins University\n\nDr Kristina Spohr was welcomed as inaugural Helmut Schmidt Professor at Henry A. Kissinger Center for Global Affairs in an event organised by the Foreign Policy Institute at John Hopkins SAIS. In a press release from 3 October opening the new joint program of the Helmut Schmidt Professorship in Washington DC, the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) and the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) declared the new professorship commemorates the long and deep friendship between Dr Kissinger and Chancellor Schmidt and, together with five new post-doctoral fellowships, is part of a multi-year program to enhance research on transatlantic relations at Johns Hopkins SAIS funded by the DAAD with generous support by the German Federal Foreign Office. The event, called “The United States, Europe, and World Order” took place on 3 October at Johns Hopkins University SAIS. It was held to celebrate a brand new, multi-year program featuring the new Helmut Schmidt Distinguished Professorship, this year held by Dr Kristina Spohr, and a new Post-Doctoral program in the field of international relations and history. The inaugural event began with an introduction to the program by the President of DAAD and an address on current issues by Germany’s Deputy Foreign Minister. This was followed by a discussion on the current state of world order and contemporary issues facing the United States and Europe, involving among others, Dr Kristina Spohr. Watch the full event on YouTube.\n\nNew publication \"The Unprecedented President\" by Professor Steven Casey\n\nA new article written by Professor Steven Casey was published by the H-Diplo/ISSF Policy Series America and the World – 2017 and Beyond on 2 October, edited by Robert Jervis, Joshua Rovner, and Diane Labrosse. The article, entitled “The Unprecedented President: Donald Trump and the Media in Historical Perspective” chronicles the relationship between the White House and the media in the twentieth century. Professor Casey observes that, since the start of the twentieth century, when the White House first became “a full-time propaganda machine,” the president’s relationship with the media has been in a state of constant flux. Past presidents, whether Republican or Democrat, whether dealing with print, radio, television, or the Internet, have all recognized the costs, as well as the benefits, associated with interacting with the media. Despite that, Professor Casey argues that Trump’s use of the media has been too continent, too undisciplined, too unprepared, too untruthful to fit into any pattern of previous behaviour. In this area, he is proving himself to be an unprecedented president.\n\nProfessor Steven Casey wins AJHA 2018 Book of the Year Award\n\nProfessor Steven Casey won the American Journalism Historians Association Book of the Year Award for 2018 for his latest book, The War Beat, Europe: The American Media at War against Nazi Germany published by Oxford University Press in 2017. The award, which recognises the best book in journalism history or mass media history published during the previous calendar year was presented at AJHA’s Annual Convention 4-6 October in Salt Lake City, Utah. Based on a wealth of previously untapped primary sources, Professor Casey’s book chronicles a group of highly courageous and extremely talented American journalists as they reported the war against Nazi Germany for a grateful audience back at home. War Beat, Europe, provides the first comprehensive account of what these reporters witnessed, what they were allowed to publish, and how their reports shaped the home front’s perception of some of the most pivotal battles in American history. “Our panel of judges agreed that Steven Casey’s work once again established that good history at its best should be good reading,” said Aimee Edmondson from Ohio University, chair of the book award committee. “They also agreed his book provides a landmark work for scholars, an engaging and compelling account of journalists dedicated to reporting the Allied campaigns to dislodge the German forces from Europe.” Read more about the AJHA 2018 Book of the Year Award.\n\nProfessor David Stevenson's events on the First World War\n\nIn the context of the centenary commemoration of the ending of the First World War, Professor David Stevenson spoke at a couple of public events to share his vast knowledge on the subject. On 5 October 2018 he was at the Malvern Festival of Military History for a lecture on “How It Started, How It Ended – the Continuing Debate about the Origins and Outcome of the First World War”. The following day, Professor Stevenson delivered the Presidential Lecture of the Central London Branch of the Historical Association. He spoke on \"The Road to 1918: How the First World War Ended”.\n\nProfessor Nigel Ashton on his Freedom of Information case again the Cabinet Office\n\nProfessor Ashton has written a piece for the LSE British Politics and Policy Blog (13 September) detailing his Freedom of Information case against the Cabinet Office over the release of files relating to UK policymaking and the Qaddafi regime between 1988 and 2011. The blog post follows the final, written confirmation from the Cabinet Office earlier this month that they will not be appealing any further. The case started when Professor Ashton submitted a Freedom of Information (FOI) request in 2014 for the Qaddafi-UK files. Although the request was for history not journalistic purposes, Professor Ashton’s request was rejected by the Cabinet Office on the grounds of section 14 of the FOI act concerning ‘“vexatious” requests. Professor Ashton fought the rejection (and eventual appeal) in the courts. Earlier this month, the Cabinet Office was finally forced to concede defeat as a result of a ruling issued by the Upper Tribunal in favour of Professor Ashton.\n\nStaff news, 2018-19\n\nIt gives us great pleasure to announce that Professor Steven Casey, Dr Tanya Harmer, Dr Padraic X. Scanlan and Dr Paul Stock are back this month from their sabbatical/research leave. They will be teaching in the department in 2018-19.

Dr Victoria Phillips is our 2018-19 LSE-Columbia University Visiting Professor and Dr (des) Bastian Matteo Scianna is the 2018-19 LSE-Konrad Adenauer Stiftung Fellow in Modern History. Finally, we are sad to report that Dr Heather Jones (pictured) has left the Department and the School after ten years of service to take up a chair in Modern and Contemporary European History at UCL. During her time in the Department, she has greatly contributed to the study of WWI history with many scholarly achievements and accolades, while numerous students have benefited from her dedicated teaching and wise guidance. We will miss her presence and all-round contribution enormously and we offer her our warmest congratulations on her new appointment.\n\nDr Taylor C. Sherman publishes new article in Postocolonial Studies\n\nDr Sherman has released a new article in Postcolonial Studies, entitled “’A New Type of Revolution’: Socialist Thought in India, 1940s-1960s”. Although it is often said that early postcolonial India was socialist, scholars have tended to take this term for granted. This article investigates how Indians defined socialism in the two decades after independence. Understanding how Indians defined their version of socialism, Dr Sherman argues, will help scholars re-evaluate the role of the first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, in defining the goals India pursued after independence. It will also re-orient our understanding of the expectations and limitations of the Indian state in this crucial period in Indian history. LSE users can access the article for free.\n\nHistory and Philosophy degrees at LSE highest paid five years after graduations\n\nOnce again, History and Philosophy degrees at LSE show top of the national table with earnings of above subject average five years after graduation. The latest Longitudinal Education Outcomes (LEO) dataset, released by the UK’s Department for Education on 21 June 2018, lists the “historical and philosophical studies” graduates at LSE the highest earners after 5 years. Out of all UK universities, for a cohort of male and female individuals, who graduated from LSE in 2009-10 in the field of historical and philosophical studies, their median salary was the highest at £38,000 after 5 years. The LEO pinpoints which universities produce the highest-earning graduates by subject area after they have been in the labour market for five years. The Daily Telegraphy also published the data on 15 August in an article entitled \"The UK's highest paying degrees, according to graduate salary\". Citing the DfE data, the article shows that LSE is the UK university with the highest graduate salaries for history and philosophy, economics, maths, business, law and social studies degrees.\n\nUpper Tribunal dismissed Cabinet Office appeal in favour of Professor Ashton\n\nAn appeal by Cabinet Office lawyers to deny release of copies of Downing Street files to Professor Nigel Ashton has been rejected by the Upper Tribunal. Professor Ashton has been in a long-running Freedom of Information battle with the Cabinet Office. In 2014, he requested for copies of Downing Street files that covered the period from the Lockerbie bombing of December 1988 to the revolution of 2011 that resulted in Qaddafi being deposed and murdered. He subsequently narrowed his request to files from the years 1990 to 2002. At a hearing last year, the tribunal ruled that the documents should be handed to Professor Ashton. However, government lawyers appealed against the ruling in May 2018 on the basis of being “vexatious”. The judge at the Upper Tribunal has now rejected the Cabinet Office’s appeal and upheld the decision of the First Tier Tribunal in Professor Ashton’s favour. “There is a vital public interest in understanding the course of Britain’s policy towards Libya during the Qaddafi regime”, Professor Ashton told us. “From the Lockerbie bombing to Blair’s rapprochement with Qaddafi to Cameron’s role in toppling Qaddafi’s regime, Britain was at the heart of events in Libya. I am glad that the Upper Tribunal has upheld the ruling of the First Tier Tribunal that my request for the opening of Prime Minister’s Office files which chart these vital decisions was a perfectly reasonable use of the Freedom of Information Act .”\n\nRead the full decision of the Upper Tribunal: Cabinet Office v Information Commissioner and Ashton.\n\nDr Joanna Lewis fieldwork in Somaliland\n\nDr Joanna Lewis left the UK on Friday, 20 July, to conduct research in Somaliland for her project on the reconstruction of post conflict states. In 2017, she was awarded an LSE Institute of Global Affairs-Rockefeller Grant for two years to lead a project on Somalia, entitled “‘Pathways to Resilience’: The Role of an Urban Diaspora in Post-Conflict Reconstruction, London and Hargeisa, 1991 to the Present Day.” The project, based at the Firoz Lalji LSE Centre for Africa, investigates the role of the Somali diaspora in building frameworks of social, political and financial resilience in a post-conflict urban environment. It case-studies the diasporic relationship between London and Hargeisa, capital of the unrecognised state of Somaliland, since civil war ended in 1991. As part of her research, Dr Lewis will interview Somaliland's Foreign Minister Dr Edna Adan in the Horn of Africa. Incidentally, Dr Adan and the issue of Somaliland’s status are discussed in an article in the Guardian on 20 July.\n\nNew article by Dr Ronald C. Po on China and the Global South\n\nDr Po published a new article, “China and the Global South: A Geostrategic Perspective” in the latest issue of Radical History Review (issue 131). Reluctant to side with those analysts who regard the China Dream as being equivalent to its aspiration of rising as a Pacific power, Dr Po argues that in facilitating the China Dream, over the next few decades, the Chinese government is and will be more interested in engaging with the Global South than with any other regions of the world, particularly in its military engagement in Africa and the Indian Ocean. Even though the Pacific Ocean is no less geopolitically salient, he suggests that the Pacific has not been prioritized as the foremost strategic theatre by the Chinese Communist Party since last century.\n\nNew article by Dr Kirsten E. Schulze in Terrorism and Political Violence\n\nDr Kirsten E. Schulze has co-authored a new article with Dr Julie Chernov Hwand (Goucher College) in the journal Terrorism and Political Violence, entitled \"Why They Join: Pathways into Indonesian Jihadist Organizations\", available online now. This article explores four pathways to entry into Indonesian Islamist extremist groups: study sessions, local conflict, kinship, and schools. It argues that within all four of these pathways, social bonds and relationships are the common thread in encouraging entry as well as in fostering commitment. Drawing on original fieldwork including 49 interviews with current and former members of Jemaah Islamiyah, Mujahidin KOMPAK, Darul Islam, Mujahidin Tanah Runtuh, Indonesia’s pro-ISIS network, and other jihadist groups as well as 57 depositions and court documents, this article explores the development and evolution of these pathways and how relational ties play a role in each.\n\nNew article in the CTC Sentinel by Dr Kirsten Schulze\n\nDr Kirsten Schulze has released a new article in the CTC Sentinel entitled “The Surabaya Bombings and the Evolution of the Jihadi Threat in Indonesia” (June/July 2018, Vol. 11, Issue 6). On May 13, 2018, three churches in Surabaya, Indonesia, were targeted by suicide bombers comprising one single family of six. Dr Schulze argues these are the first suicide bombings involving women and young children in Indonesia, thus marking a new modus operandi. They also show an increased capability among Indonesian Islamic State supporters when compared to previous attacks. But this increase is not necessarily indicative of a greater capacity across Indonesia’s pro-Islamic State network and the involvement of whole families reflects a broadening participation in Indonesian jihadism rather than a complete departure. The recent upsurge in violence is locally rooted, even if it is framed within the broader Islamic State ideology. The attacks also bring to the fore the role of family networks and the increased embrace of women and children in combat roles.\n\nNew co-edited book by Dr Antony Best\n\nDr Antony Best, historian of Modern Japan and Anglo-Japanese Relation, released a new co-edited volume this month with Renaissance Books, called British Foreign Secretaries and Japan, 1850-1990: Aspects of the Evolution of British Foreign Policy. The book reviews the role of British Foreign Secretaries in the formulation of British policy towards Japan from the re-opening of Japan in the middle of the nineteenth century to the end of the twentieth century. It also takes a critical look at the history of British relations with Japan over these years. British Foreign Secretaries and Japan, 1850-1990 is part of a 10-volume Japan Society's series, which includes Britain & Japan: Biographical Portraits as well as British Envoys in Japan. The book is co-edited with Hugh Cortazzi, British Ambassador to Japan (1980-1984) and editor or contributor to all the volumes in the Japan Society's series.\n\nHistory students at LSE highest earners in new IFS report\n\nOn 15 June 2018, the BBC News website highlighted a new Institute of Fiscal Studies Report which calculated the difference in earnings by subject and university choice throughout Britain five years after graduation. With this interactive content, the report illustrates the average impact the different universities and subjects would have on the future income of an individual. In the subject of History, LSE ranked #1, with average lifetime earnings boost of £14,000 for men and £15,000 for women. This is higher than from studying history at any other university. LSE was ranked higher than Oxford, St Andrews, Cambridge, KCL and UCL.\n\nDr Roham Alvandi featured in Independent article\n\nDr Alvandi was quoted in a new article published by the Independent on 12 June on the Trump-Kim summit from the view of Iran. In the article, “Iran warns North Korea not to trust the US over historic summit: ‘Trump might cancel deal before returning home'”, Dr Alvandi claims Iranians will see the summit as little more than a publicity stunt that legitimises both Mr Trump and Mr Kim. Why is the United States willing to negotiate with North Korea, a nation with a nuclear arsenal, while refusing to pursue detente with Iran, a country that has no nuclear weapons and has agreed to strict international safeguards on its civilian nuclear programme, Iranians will be asking.\n\nDr Kristina Spohr announced Inagural Helmut Schmidt Professor at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies\n\nDr Kristina Spohr will be joining the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) in Washington DC for the 2018-19 academic year as the inaugural Helmut Schmidt Distinguished Professor in the Henry A. Kissinger Center for Global Affairs. This new professorship commemorates the long and deep friendship between Dr Kissinger and Chancellor Schmidt and is part of a multi-year initiative to enhance research on transatlantic relations at SAIS funded by the German Academic Exchange Service with generous support by the German Federal Foreign Office. “The German Federal Foreign Office is thrilled to support the establishment of the Helmut Schmidt Distinguished Professor in the Henry A. Kissinger Center for Global Affairs,” said the Minister of State for international cultural policy at the German Federal Foreign Office, Michelle Müntefering. “The professorship adds an important German-U.S. transatlantic scientific perspective on how to tackle the world’s most pressing challenges. (…) the Helmut-Schmidt professorship is part of a larger effort by the German Federal Foreign Office, together with its partners, to stay actively engaged in a broad transatlantic dialogue.” Giovanni Agnelli, Distinguished Professor and Director of the Kissinger Center Francis J. Gavin said, “We are delighted to welcome Professor Kristina Spohr as the inaugural Helmut Schmidt Professor. She is an acclaimed scholar of transatlantic relations and historically informed strategy and statecraft.” Read the full press release by Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies and German Academic Exchange Service. Read a piece by the German regional daily newspaper Rheinische Post on Dr Spohr's new position (21 June, in German).\n\nThe Paulsen Programme: new €1 million fund for historians in Russia\n\nWe are very excited to announce that the department is hosting a new €1 million fund programme offering fellowships and conference grants to historians based in Russia. Funded by Dr. Frederik Paulsen Foundation, and chaired by former head of department, Professor Dominic Lieven, The Paulsen Programme at LSE has been set up to support historians in Russia whose work focuses on the imperial period from the mid-17th century to 1918. In addition to supporting scholars, The Programme will also organise two international research seminars in Saint Petersburg in collaboration with the Higher School of Economics, and an international conference in Latvia in 2022 devoted to the history of imperial Russia (c1650-1917), bringing together leading historians of imperial Russia from across the world. Major publications are planned which will bring the best current thinking and research on imperial Russia to the attention of both English and Russian-speaking historians. Applications are invited for Paulsen fellowships and conference grants for the academic year starting on 1 October 2018 and ending on 30 September 2019. The deadline for applications is 31 July 2018.\n\nFour International History students receive Partnership PhD Mobility Bursaries\n\nFour of the PhD students in the Department of International History have received Partnership PhD Mobility Bursaries. This scheme enables LSE PhD students to undertake research for two to three months at one of LSE’s institutional partners: University of California (Berkeley), the University of Cape Town, Columbia University (New York), Fudan University (Shanghai), National University of Singapore, Peking University and Sciences Po (Paris). The scheme offers a wonderful opportunity to visit another institution, to benefit from additional research resources (archival and advisory) and to experience the academic culture and professional networks of another country. Our International History PhD recipients for 2018-19 are: Katherine Arnold (pictured) who will be spending next term at the University of Cape Town. She is conducting research on ‘Between Europe and the World: German Naturalists, the Cape Colony, and the British Empire, 1781-1851’; Molly Avery, University of California, Berkeley, ‘Transnational Anticommunist Networks in Central America in the Late 1970s and Early 1980s’; Fadi Esber, Sciences Po, Paris, ‘The Politics of Partition in French Mandate Syria, 1920-1936’; and Tom Wilkinson, Columbia University (New York), ‘Youth in Colonial and Post-Colonial Northern India, 1885-1957’. They will each receive £2,500 towards travel expenses, accommodation, maintenance, educational materials and/or other education-related costs.\n\nProfessor Nigel Ashton in the Guardian: battle with Cabinet Office continues in new tribunal hearing\n\nProfessor Nigel Ashton, historian of Anglo-American relations and modern Middle East, was mentioned in an article in the Guardian on 15 May, reporting on a long-running Freedom of Information battle he has been fighting with the Cabinet Office. In 2014, Professor Ashton requested for copies of Downing Street files that covered the period from the Lockerbie bombing of December 1988 to the revolution of 2011 that resulted in Gaddafi being deposed and murdered. He subsequently narrowed his request to files from the years 1990 to 2002, but has said he may request more. At a hearing last year, the tribunal ruled that the documents should be handed to Professor Ashton. However, government lawyers are appealing against the ruling on the basis of being “vexatious” in a new hearing that took place on 16 May in London. Professor Ashton hopes ultimately to achieve a greater understanding of the role the British government played in creating Libya as it is today. “The public interest in understanding Britain’s policy towards Libya is overwhelming,” Professor Ashton told the Guardian. “It seems extraordinary that the Cabinet Office has resisted my freedom of information request at every turn.” Read the full article.\n\nDr Marina Perez de Arcos winner of Martin Abel Gonzalez Prize\n\nMany congratulations to Guest Teacher Dr Marina Perez de Arcos for winning LSE Class Teacher Award, the Department’s Martin Abel Gonzalez Prize. PhD students Isaac Scarborough (pictured) and William King were also highly commended for the prize. The prize is awarded yearly to the Department's Graduate Teaching Assistants and Guest Teachers with the best TQARO teaching scores. The prize was set up in 2011-12 and is named in memory of Martín Abel González, a Graduate Teaching Assistant who served for many years at the Department and who tragically passed away in the summer of 2011. It is a prize that recognises excellence in teaching and professionalism as these were qualities that distinguished Martín Abel González.\n\nDr Roham Alvandi in The Spectator Podcast, in the Independent and on Australia's ABC Radio National\n\nDr Roham Alvandi commented on the latest events in the Middle East in the British media. Joined by Christopher de Bellaigue he participated in an episode of the The Spectator Podcast on 10 May. They talked about the recent US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement. \"I think it’s unambiguous that the policy of the Trump administration\", Dr Alvandi said, \"very much driven by John Bolton but also by Pompeo and others is one of regime change.\" Listen to the podcast. On 11 May, he was quoted by the Independent newspaper on the Israeli-Iranian confrontation in Syria, which came just days after US President Donald Trump announced his country would withdraw from the landmark 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and six world powers. Read the full article, \"Did Iran attack Israel from Syria and why would they?\" in the Independent website. On 14 May, Dr Alvandi appeared in Australia’s ABC Radio National. He joined presenter Phillip Adams in his show “Late Night Live” to discuss the US exit from the 2015 nuclear agreement, Iran and regime change. Listen to the podcast.\n\nD Jeppe Mulich on the change of international systems for the Review of International Studies\n\nDr Jeppe Mulich, one of our LSE Fellows, has a new article out in the journal Review of International Studies. \"Transformation at the Margins: Imperial Expansion and Systemic Change in World Politics” seeks to provide a framework for addressing the question of how and why international systems change over time. Empire provides a particularly illuminating window into the topic of systemic change, in part because a major driver of historical transformations has been the expansion of empires and their encounters with other heterogeneous polities across the globe, and in part because a focus on imperial interactions highlights the limitations of existing unit-centric perspectives. LSE users can read the article for free.\n\nInternational Graduate Student Conference on the Cold War\n\nThe Department of International History was pleased to co-sponsor the International Graduate Student Conference on the Cold War, hosted this year at LSE from 3-5 May. The annual conference is jointly organised by the IDEAS Cold War Studies Project at LSE, the Centre for Cold War Studies and International History at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and the Cold War Group at George Washington University. The conference was convened this year by Dr Roham Alvandi, Associate Professor of International History and Director of the IDEAS Cold War Studies Project. A number of students and faculty from the Department participated in the conference, including Professor Vladislav Zubok, whose keynote lecture was entitled, \"The Bear That Never Barked. Soviet Estimates of the Iranian Crisis, 1953.\" Next year’s conference will take place in Washington DC.\n\nInternational History student wins LSE Volunteer 2018 Award\n\nWe are incredibly proud of Alex Selway, BSc in International Relations and History, who won the Outstanding Contribution to the LSE Community Award for his work with LSESU Raising and Giving (RAG) Society. On 26 April, the LSE Volunteer Centre and the LSESU RAG Society hosted their annual event to celebrate volunteering and fundraising at LSE. Over 60 people attended representing the student body, including LSE Students’ Union and various parts of the School. In attendance were also charities that have recruited students over the past year as volunteers and fundraisers, as well as LSE staff from LSE Careers and other professional services and academic departments. “It’s been wonderful to volunteer in so many different ways”, Alex said upon winning his Outstanding Contribution to LSE award. “I’m looking forward to starting a new chapter with RAG next year as President, which I’m sure will be very fun.” We also congratulate Saskia Roberts (BA History), who was nominated for a LSE Volunteer of the Year award for her work Action Tutoring.\n\nLSESU Student-Led Teaching Excellence Awards winners announced\n\nWe are delighted to announce that the LSE Student Union's final student panel has now chosen the winners. They have recognised Associate Professor Dr Kirsten Schulze (pictured) as a runner-up in the Inspiration Teaching category, LSE Fellow Dr Daniel Strieff as a runner-up in the Research Guidance and Support category, and Guest Teacher Dr Giovanni Graglia as a a runner-up in the Mentoring and Personal Development category and also highly commended him on the Welfare and Pastoral Support category. Overall, the awards this year led to over 900 individual nominations, with over 400 members of staff across LSE being nominated in 7 categories of awards. After careful consideration the panel recognised 1 winner, 2-5 runners-up and 4-10 highly commended staff members in each category.\n\nLeverhulme Trust Research Fellowship awarded to Professor Baer\n\nProfessor Marc David Baer has been awarded a Leverhulme Trust Research Fellowship for 2018-19. This award will allow Professor Baer, a scholar of the connected histories of Christians, Jews, and Muslims in Europe and Middle East, from the early modern era to the modern, to complete his work on the project “Guided by Goethe: German-Jewish Gay Muslim Writer Hugo Marcus, 1880-1966”. German Jew Hugo Marcus (1880-1966) is the only man to have played an important role in the world’s first gay rights movement and in establishing Islam in Europe. His life and work shed new light on the history of Islam in Europe, Muslim-Jewish relations, and the gay rights struggle. Despite his significance, Marcus is relatively unknown. What is published about him does not incorporate his being German, Jewish, Muslim, and gay. Professor Baer plans to utilise his twelve-month Leverhulme Research Fellowship to write the first biography of Marcus, based on his German-language publications, speeches, private correspondence, and personal documents.\n\nNew virtual special issue on the Cold War in Latin America edited by Dr Tanya Harmer\n\nDr Harmer has organised a virtual special issue for the Journal of Latin American Studies (JLAS), entitled “The Cold War in Latin America\" (open access). “This virtual special issue highlights some of the exciting directions that scholarship on the Cold War in Latin America has taken over the last decade”, Dr Harmer tells us in the Introduction. New interest in Latin America’s Cold War “have provided new insights into the way that the conflict affected – and was shaped by – Latin Americans’ international, transnational and global interactions as well as their domestic politics”. As a result, our understanding of the conflict has moved well beyond simplistic ideas of a distant bipolar superpower battle over the region. “The Cold War in Latin America” showcases some of the best new scholarship on the Cold War published by JLAS in previous years with articles on women, gender and morality; the “politicization and internationalization of everyday life”; and on interactions of Latin America’s revolutionary left.\n\nDr Kristina Spohr's on the scramble for the arctic\n\n“The new Cold War: The race to conquer the arctic, the world’s final frontier” is Dr Kristina Spohr’s newest analysis, published on 9 March as a cover article in the New Statesman (9-15 March). Dr Spohr, a historian of the global ending of the Cold War and author of The Global Chancellor (OUP, 2016) and Transcending the Cold War (OUP, 2016), argues that in the least regulated place on earth - the polar region - all the Arctic states are now jockeying for position while several non-Arctic states, are seeking influence, with the big money and real strategic vision coming from Beijing. Over the past decade, Putin has restored political and economic stability at home, while testing the West in its quest to transform Russia into a world power. “The Arctic is a keystone of that policy\", asserts Dr Spohr, \"because only here – as Putin said last December – is there real scope for territorial expansion and resource acquisition.” “At the end of the 19th century the great powers engaged in a scramble for Africa”, Dr Spohr continues. “Now, in the 21st century, a scramble for the Arctic is unfolding. Across one of the bleakest landscapes of the world, the race is on for gas, oil and fish and to control the emerging shipping lanes of the High North. (…) It’s time for the West to pay attention”.\n\nDavid Motadel reviews Arne Westad's The Cold War in the Times Literary Supplement\n\nDr David Motadel published a new book review of Professor Arne Westad's The Cold War: A World History (Penguin, 2017) in the 23 February issue of the Times Literary Supplement, which also includes some more general reflections on challenges of writing a global history of the twentieth century. “With a brilliant ability to condense complex historical information\", Dr Motadel argues in the review, entitled \"Persistent Chill\", \"Westad offers an authoritative, elegantly written panorama of a divided world. He takes ideas and ideologies seriously, without ignoring material forces – at a time when the fashion among many historians is a new materialism, and this is refreshing.”\n\nProfessor Anita Prazmowksa featured on BBC and CNN\n\nIn early February, Professor Prazmowska was featured in two articles regarding the Polish legislation to outlaw references to Polish death camps in Holocaust bill. The phrase, first used by Barack Obama in a 2012 speech, has led to a controversial bill which makes it illegal to accuse Poland of complicity in Nazi crimes. According to the BBC article, there is widespread agreement that Polish citizens participated in the Holocaust through the betrayal and murder of Polish Jews, but does that equal a larger Polish complicity? She responded: “this is history as a tool, as a means for a nationalistic government to accuse everyone else of betraying the nation while painting itself as the only true carriers of the Polish flag”. In the CNN article, she adds that legislation shouldn’t be used to force a particular historic interpretation, as this forms a broader attempt to revise negative aspects of history.\n\nNew article in Asian Security by Dr Kirsten E. Schulze\n\nDr Schulze published a new article in the journal Asian Security with Professor Joseph Chinyong Liow (Nanyang Technological University, Singapore), entitled “Making Jihadis, Waging Jihad: Transnational and Local Dimensions of the ISIS Phenomenon in Indonesia and Malaysia”. The article aims to explain how, where and why the transnational and local intersect as well as the role of religion, particularly in the ideological narratives and recruitment strategies of local jihadi groups. At the heart of their analysis is the question to what extent Indonesians and Malaysians were lured into joining ISIS as a result of its “universal” ideology and global recruitment strategy or whether they were instead propelled by local Indonesian and Malaysian dynamics into Syria and into “importing” and “indigenizing” ISIS to advance their own agendas. LSE users, can read the article for free.\n\nPodcast with Professor Stevenson about 1917\n\nProfessor David Stevenson participated in an episode of New Books in History podcast. He talked with Dr Krzysztof Odyniec about his latest book 1917: War, Peace and Revolution, released by Oxford University Press at the end of last year. In the podcast, recorded in January 2018, Professor Stevenson discusses the causes, course, and effects of the events of the year 1917, a turning point in the history of WWI and the evolution of the modern world. He shares insights about judging historical forces and human agency, evaluating counterfactuals, and drawing comparisons between 1917 and subsequent events of the last 100 years, including the Second World War, the Vietnam War, and conflicts of the twenty-first century. Listen to the podcast in the New Book's webiste.\n\nLSE Student Union History Society and South London Cares event with Dr Roham Alvandi\n\nOn 24 January, the LSE Student Union History Society co-hosted an event with a charity called South London Cares, inviting Dr Roham Alvandi to speak over a pizza lunch. Dr Alvandi was joined by LSE students and some of our older neighbours from south London. He spoke with them about LSE and why we study history, as well as about his own research on Iran. The neighbours (one of whom was an LSE alumnus from the 1950s) got a chance to chat with the students over lunch and were then taken on a tour of the campus by the students. “The idea was to bring our neighbours out of isolation and encourage them to come on to our campus to participate in the events that go on here,” Dr Alvandi told us. Dr Alvandi thanks the History Society and Georgina Connah, who made a huge effort in helping organising the event. He was very pleased with the student turnout, mentioning, \"it was one of those days when I really love my job!\"\n\nNew essay in History Today by Dr Gagan D. S. Sood\n\nDr Sood has published a new essay in History Today (vol. 68, no. 2, Feb. 2018) entitled “A World Revealed”. Written using research conducted for his book India and the Islamic Heartlands: An Eighteenth-Century World of Circulation and Exchange (Cambridge University Press, 2016), the article is meant to appeal to a general audience of history students, teachers and aficionados interested in extra-Western, pre-modern history. The essay focuses on an 18th-century world, spanning the Middle East and South Asia, populated by a kaleidoscope of \"ordinary\" people. It was a moment “of remarkable changes, politically, intellectually, culturally, economically and demographically; it was a moment of unscripted possibilities”, says Dr Sood. This world was historically significant in its own time, but it suddenly vanished and was subsequently forgotten. The aim of the piece is to recapture a sense of this world in the manner of a detective story, and what is revealed is, in many ways, unexpected.\n\nGuest Teacher and PhD alumna offered Max Weber Fellowship\n\nDr Corina Mavrodin has been offered a Max Weber Fellowship at the European University Institute in Florence. She is currently teaching HY 116: International History since 1890 and HY 206: The International History of the Cold War, 1945-1989 in the Department of International History. Under the supervision of Professor Piers Ludlow, her PhD thesis, “A Maverick in the Making: Romania’s de-Satellization Process and the Global Cold War (1953-1963)”, passed the viva without corrections in May 2017. At the EUI, she will expand on her doctoral research by further exploring the economic and political roots of Romania’s de-satellization process within a global context. She says, “The EUI is an unparalleled centre of academic excellence in Europe. I feel both happy and privileged to be offered the Max Weber Fellowship, which will allow me to transform my dissertation into a monograph.”\n\nDr Tanya Harmer's co-edited special journal issue out now\n\nIn 2016, Dr Harmer co-organised two international conferences in London and Mexico on Global and Transnational Histories of Latin America’s Revolutionary Left and on Intellectual Cultures of of Revolution in Latin America, respectively. Both conferences were hosted by the Latin America-Europe Cold War Research Network, coordinated by Dr Harmer and sponsored by the LSE International History Department. A special journal issue has now been released based on both conferences. Titled “Revolutionary Transnationalism in Historical Perspective: Militant Networks in the Americas”, the issue has been published in Estudios Interdisciplinarios de América Latina y el Caribe (vol. 28, no. 2) with an introduction by Dr Harmer and by Dr Alberto Martin Alvarez (Instituto Mora). The whole issue is open access.\n\nLSE Summer School: New International History Course\n\nWe are thrilled to announce LSE Summer School's first ever course offered by the Department - IR106: From Sarajevo to Baghdad: Key Decisions on War and Peace, 1914-2003 with Professor David Stevenson. The course will offer an intensive investigation of a central set of topics over the last century of international politics. It will introduce students to the international history of the two world wars and the Cold War as well as the post-Cold War period. The material should be readily accessible to students with little previous background in the field, as well as rewarding for those who already have familiarity with the content."
