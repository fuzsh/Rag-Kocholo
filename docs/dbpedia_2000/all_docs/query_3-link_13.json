        "text": "After reading this, I really think Mike Spohr and James Breakwell need to collaborate. This book shows you how to survive toddlers, and James has a book on how to fight zombies with toddlers. And by that I mean when you have toddlers, you shouldn't actually use toddlers as a weapon against zombies.\n\nThis book is filled with humor, while at the same time, actually gives out good parenting advice. Some of the situations are presented in the extreme, but that just ups the humor. Even in the extreme, I'm sure there are plenty of parents that can relate.\n\nThe images helped to add some extra enjoyment. I don't have children, but if I ever do, I will read this book again to have some sense of what to do. This isn't a book written by a child care expert, just a parent that talks about the real world, not some imaginary place where things go as planned.\n\nI was given a copy of this book by NetGally for an honest review.\n\nAuthor: Mike Spohr\n\nPublisher: Quarto Publishing Group – Voyageur Press\n\nPublication Date: 1 Aug 2017\n\nFull disclosure: I am living in a house that has been forcefully occupied by toddlers for the past two years, with no withdrawal or peace treaty in sight, as my youngest is about to get his fully fledged toddler credentials. The Toddler Survival Guide knows what I'm talking about. There are constant stand-offs, and breaches of ceasefire agreements happen multiple times a day.\n\nI enjoyed reading this humourous look at life with a toddler. It is interspersed with mock-historical accounts of toddler behaviour in history - as far back as the neanderthal toddler scrawling on the cave walls. There is also some sage advice given. Take heed. Toddlers are little ninjas.\n\nA perfect gift to any parent on their sweet baby's first birthday, as they are bound to need this shortly afterwards.\n\nThank you to the authors, publisher, and netgalley for a review copy. This is an honest review.\n\n\"If you've ever seen a horror film where zombies relentlessly come after human flesh with single-minded determination, then you've got a pretty good idea of how toddlers feel about candy.\"\n\nAs said, this book is a humorous guide to raising your toddler or praising yourself for life with toddler.\n\nAnd that's exactly what this book is! I mean while reading this book I might have laughed more than I actually have laughed during my kids' toddlerhood. I can agree with almost everything stated in this book and the ones I can't agree with, are something that I haven't done with my own: for example we haven't been in movies because I know that all hell would break loose then. :'D\n\nThis is great book to those who doesn't have kids and to those who have. At least for me it was an awesome reminder that this doesn't have to be so serious, you can do this through humor which makes everything so much easier with my toddler drawing to those new tapestries we have just put on the walls or refusing to potty training and still screaming her lungs out when she does her thing in her diaper.\n\nAfter all I'll rate this book with 4 stars. It was good, I had a blast while reading it but I would have wanted something more. It felt kind of like it's repeating itself with everything.\n\nThis was a unique way to give parenting advice. As a parent of 3 boys, that were all toddlers back to back, I could totally relate to this book. It made me laugh out loud at the circumstances that come up. Especially the part about your house; we lost 3 flat screen tvs to our toddlers. I think this would be a good gift for a dad or good humored mom of a 6 month old. I liked how they gave REAL LIFE parenting advice, along with hilarious illustrations, on what to expect. On second thought, because this book is so real, I don't know if this is best to give to a new parent, they may be fearful of what's to come (they should be!) or to give it to a parent that just survived the toddlers years as therapy from their PTSD of raising a toddler (or two). Either way , this was cute and different from most self help books.\n\nThe toddler survival guide was a humorous read for me (especially because I am currently in the toddler stage with my eldest and my youngest is not far behind). I found myself both laughing, and being horrified, but in all honesty there is so much TRUTH in this book. Toddler parents to-be really should read this so that they know what they are getting themselves into. Toddlerhood is NOT, I repeat, NOT like infancy! Its a whole new ballgame.\n\nThe Spohrs touch on real life problems that non-parents would not even know exists unless witnessed first hand. Humor was brought to situations that when knee-deep in it is not humorous in the slightest, but it is when looking back at the toddler experience.\n\nMy eldest may be one of the 1% that actually does not give trouble to go to bed, eat, go to the doctor/dentist and the like but for those that struggle, the tips and tricks in this book really would help in a more sane day to day with a toddler. As I read this survival guide (during “me time”) I nodding along with the things I already to and things I have no had to deal with because of these steps. Needless to say, my life is this book (some parts not included) and take it from me, toddler life is rough but there is a light at the end and in a couple years, I will get there HA HA! For the parents that are not yet in the toddler zone, I recommend sprucing up on your ninja reflexes because you will 100% need it!\n\nDon’t let the cuteness of a toddler fool you, they are always up to something and they move very fast. Especially when they know they’re not allowed to do said thing.\n\nI recommend this book to all parents and toddler parents to be.\n\nKey advice for parents to keep in mind when thinking of “expanding the family”.\n\n“Adding to your family when you have a toddler, to paraphrase Jim Gaffigan, is kind of like being handed a baby when you’re already drowning….- parenting a toddler and a baby at the same time will regularly approach four-kid levels of stress”\n\nI would like to thank Quarto Publishing Group (Voyageur Press Imprint), The Spohrs and Netgalley for an ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review.\n\nI also reviewed this book on: Goodreads, My blog, and Amazon\n\nThis book is also featured on my Instagram.\n\nBasically written much like a zombie survival guide, THE TODDLER SURVIVAL GUIDE is meant to amuse while showing parents how to basically toddler proof their lives. Helpful reminders about needing to step up the baby proofing because toddlers can and will climb EVERYTHING are sprinkled throughout the humor, etc.\n\nAs a non-parent surrounded by the parents of toddlers (and a few almost toddlers), the book made me laugh until I almost peed my pants, thinking of the horror stories they tell. It's like a built in birth control book, as if my friends' stories were not that enough already.\n\nThe book would be a great present for those parents who need to be reminded their struggles are not unique and they are not completely alone (all though, realistically, those parents don't have time to read a book). I'd also say it's a must read for those deciding if they are ready to have kids :-)\n\nI really enjoyed this smarmy title from authors who CLEARLY have, or have dealt with the joys of an infant developing into a psychopa-er-toddler. As a mother of a 17 month old myself, when I finally got a breath, wiped the puke and smashed banana from my shirt, removed the lego embedded in my foot and clicked off Paw Patrol for the first time in 16 god forsaken hours, it was a treat to be able to enjoy my cold coffee from 12 hours earlier and the surviving bite of a granola bar while I read that someone similar is going through the same hell....er....ordeal(?)....adventure(?). The advice was sound and simple with a twist of sarcasm and heaps of humor and anecdotes. I have a few friends whose children will soon be bursting into toddlerhood. And I can't wait for their precious, sleeping infants to erupt into insanity so I can share this gem.\n\nIf you are the parent of a toddler (and even if you only visit the home of one of these families occasionally), I'm sure you know very well that your everyday life differs greatly from the romantic vision that you had in your mind when you, along with your partner, decided to introduce a new member to your family. The first steps, the struggle with food or sleeping time, unsuccessful attempts at maintaining a social life, and various mischief are just part of the deal you take in the bundle with a small person who has come into your life.\n\nI have read many of these types of books, but this is by far the best I have read!Well done!"
