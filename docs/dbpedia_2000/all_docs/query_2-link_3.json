        "text": "laurencat said\n\nWhat it really boils down to is this: if you give someone on the internet money you absolutely can't care what happens to it after that. I see it like giving money to a beggar on the street. You have to accept that you have no way of knowing how it will be used. Maybe the person is scamming you, maybe they aren't. Maybe they desperately need money, maybe they don't. Lots of times the bloggers themselves aren't even the ones asking for the money, some fan or friend starts up a collection after something bad happens, and then it later turns out the money wasn't exactly needed, or wasn't used it this way or that and people get mad. If it really matters to you whether the money goes to past due bills, or someones college education then simply don't give it!\n\nNow, it is different in the Spohrs case, because they have a registered charity, so certainly accountability is needed. But like has been discussed, they started this thing after a personal tragedy with no prior charity-running skills, and they are learning as they go along. It seems to me, especially after Heather's post, that they are doing the best they can, and see that they need to do better. If you don't feel comfortable donating until X, Y, Z criteria are met that's fine, but going around calling this a scam is just cruel in my opinion.\n\nSnarky McSnarkypants said\n\nlaurencat said\n\nWhat it really boils down to is this: if you give someone on the internet money you absolutely can't care what happens to it after that.

If you give to a charity, it doesn't matter if it's on the internet or not – accountability is not just nice, it's required. If I'd given money to assist parents currently dealing with NICU, and I found it was going to be used for college scholarships instead, I would feel I'd been given a bait-and-switch. I'm glad to see Heather and Mike are going to address this issue. This is why you love bloggers – because they respond to complaints instead of, I don't know, threatening you with a lawsuit.\n\nAlso, to whoever said the Maddie Bags are unnecessary… Heather and Mike were inspired to create them after their own NICU experience. So obviously the things given to you in the hospital are not universally available.\n\nHeather, if you're still here… I thought Mouth Media was a PR company. Is it marketing? Are they that different? I'm kind of ignorant about all that.\n\nheather spohr said\n\nI am totally cool with questions being asked – we don't expect or want any special treatment. Everyone has something bad happen to them, we aren't any different. There are many ways be can be doing better, and it's good for us to realize that and focus on improving before we do anything else.\n\nThe standards for charity accountability are great, and we are going to get started on them right away. I emailed our web team about adding a blog section so we can easily update our donors about the things FoM is up to. It is possible to earmark donations (so, let's say you want to donate only to grants for families, or only to support packs, etc), so we'll make sure that's very clear to donors. Our treasurer is working on the annual report, so once that's available we'll have it up on the site.\n\nUp until this point, all the feedback we've received has been from parents and hospitals, so this kind of information here (about transparency, etc) is helpful. Running a charity is not what I ever wanted or expected to do with my life, so it's not something I ever prepared for. It's been a trial by fire, to say the least. But it is extremely important to us – it's our daughter's legacy, and we don't want anything to cast a shadow over it.\n\nSo anyway, thank you everyone for your valid points and suggestions – we really are taking them and implementing them. And Krister – if you aren't happy with how we used the money you sent us (thank you for your generosity, truly), I would be happy to send you a refund."
