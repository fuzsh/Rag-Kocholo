        "text": "How have they done it? What has inspired them to make Western Nevada College their home for so long?\n\nYes, Dianne Hilliard and Stephane Arrigotti have literally poured their lives into WNC. Each of the longtime employees reached 35 years of service to WNC in January. They are among 62 employees who are celebrating their Nevada System of Higher Education employment anniversaries in January.\n\nHilliard, the Admissions and Records director and registrar, is a great source of history at the college. She remembers when a bunny more specifically a jackrabbit was the colleges mascot and saw the campus grow before her eyes with the addition of the Aspen Building, Child Development Center, Reynolds Center for Technology, Joe Dini Library and Student Center, Cedar Building, John L. Harvey Field and Jack C. Davis Observatory after she started.\n\nIt has been gratifying to be part of the WNC community for so many years, witnessing many changes and watching the college grow, although we still have a small college atmosphere which I enjoy, Hilliard said.\n\nWhile Hilliard is now focused on bringing students into the college, she devoted nearly 15 years to overseeing student government when she arrived at the college in the late 1980s. She also served as a counselor for many years and was the Interim Dean of Student Services.\n\nWorking in various areas of Student Services, I have worn many hats and have been able to work with and help students in so many ways, she said. For me, its about the students and helping to make a positive difference in their lives.\n\nArrigotti actually began working at WNC in 1977 as an adjunct instructor. She became a half-time music coordinator in 1987 and a half-time community service director a few years later.\n\nIn the early days of the college, some adjuncts actually helped to run programs, as there were very few full-time faculty members, Arrigotti said. I helped hire additional faculty, took them on concert tours, developed curriculum, selected the college piano, played for commencement every year.\n\nToday, she is WNCs professor of music and director and producer of the award-winning and long-running Western Nevada Musical Theatre Company. Naturally, the college has a special place in her heart and, like Hilliard, has a historical perspective of the college that is indispensable.\n\nI have loved watching it grow from a small technical college into a respected liberal arts institution with excellent workforce training, she said. On a more personal level, I am grateful to have been given the freedom to design and nurture our musical theatre company, to pursue my visions for its growth.\n\nNo matter the challenges presented to WNC or WNMTC, we have met them as a family, working together to endure. Not all colleges have this spirit, this interpersonal support, that continues even as longtime professors retire and new faculty and administrators are hired. Even our students comment that the personal relationships at WNC are its strength. I am, and will always be, grateful for this family.\n\nJanuary has become a popular month for employees who have remained with the college for a lengthy period. Eighteen employees are celebrating at least their 10th anniversary this month and eight have surpassed 20 years of service. Besides Hilliard and Arrigotti, Julie Lewis deWitt, Kathey Brusseau, Linda Jacobsen, Robert Martinez, Dr. Thomas Kubistant and Darla Dodge are celebrating anniversaries greater than 20 years.\n\nThanks to all employees who are celebrating an anniversary this month. This commitment to WNC and all that you do in your roles at the college make Western a better place for our students!"
