New Zealand pianist Ross Carey will perform a diverse cornucopia of stylistic arrangements on the tune “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star” by plenty of worldwide contemporary composers. Combining the frivolous to the frenetic, the fragile to the fragrant, the popular to the profound, every composer has responded with good humor and imagination. Preciously including a piece titled ‘Hong Kong’ by Dominik Gadjos from the Czech Republic. The composer wrote this piece when he was just 10 years old. Another one is ‘Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star Ferry’ by Matthew Orlovich from Australia depicting a journey by Star Ferry across HK harbour! The concert also features the premiere of Ross Carey’s Variations on a Balletto for piano four hands. And Guest pianist Yuki Fung will perform a transcription of Mozart’s Turkish March. Discovering the gems of piano variations in the “Private Collection” is a privilege. Only very few concerts would offer these treasures.
