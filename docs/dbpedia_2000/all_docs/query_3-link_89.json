Mozart’s soaring “cantabile” melodies seem unfit for plucking and strumming. But if anyone could bridge that gap, it was Spanish composer-guitarist Fernando Sor. He had fought Napoleon’s superior army upon its invasion of Spain in 1808, proving he was not one to shy away from a challenge. Like Mozart himself, Sor composed operas, symphonies, and string quartets, but, unlike Mozart, the guitar was his personal weapon of choice. He pioneered a way to simultaneously play melodies and chords, as outlined in his seminal guitar method book, called by one scholar “easily the most remarkable book on guitar technique ever written.” His Introduction and Variations have become a rite of passage for aspiring guitar-virtuosos who seek to show that they, too, can make Mozart’s music sing with a guitar.\n\nSor’s Variations spin out from a charming tune, originally sung by evil minions. Since evil minions don’t sing charming tunes, opera audiences usually laugh out loud during this scene in The Magic Flute, as Papageno casts a spell upon Sarastro’s hordes with magic bells. In his Variations, Sor casts his own musical spell, first with a grand and somber introduction. The tune is thereby rendered more charming when it finally appears, and, as German is not the world’s most charming language, Sor sets the tune’s rhythm to the Italian translation of Mozart’s original (“O cara armonia” instead of “Das klinget so herrlich”). Next, Sor applies charms specific to the guitar: fanciful flourishes decorate the tune, combined with melodious, Italianate thirds and sixths. The simpler second variation laments in the style of Pamina’s aria, “Ach, ich fühl’s,” but the charms return in repeated notes (Variation 3), strumming (Variation 4), and finally triplets (Variation 5), which launch directly into a joyful coda. By the end, Sor has convinced us that Mozart and the guitar are compatible after all. Rock me, Amadeus\n\nJ.S. BACH (arr. Fisk) Cello Suite No. 1 in G Major, BWV 1007\n\nCello Suite No. 1 in G Major, BWV 1007 (ca. 1720)\n\nJOHANN SEBASTIAN BACH (1685-1750), arr. Fisk\n\nJ. S. Bach’s music for solo cello is one of the great unsolved mysteries of music history. Why did he write six cello suites? For whom, and when? It could be that the mystery surround- ing these works enhances the mystery of hearing them, for the music seems to exist apart from the world, inhabiting a soundscape that no other music has ever quite replicated. Naturally, musicologists have applied their powers of deduction to the problem, ever since Catalan cellist Pablo Casals found an obscure edition of the works in a Barcelona thrift shop, in 1890. Thanks to his performances, the suites found their way into the hearts of many and, eventually, in the case of Prelude from Suite No. 1, into Verizon commercials.\n\nIn the Baroque Era, the cello was primarily a bass instru- ment, usually heard with at least one treble instrument above it, plus harpsichord. The only surviving manuscript source, in the hand of Bach’s second wife, Anna Magdalena, calls attention to the cello’s unusually solitary pose with the special indication “senza basso,” without bass. (That didn’t stop Robert Schumann from adding his own fanciful piano accompaniments, 130 years later.) Because the suites take the cellist far outside the bass range and through forests of chords and interweaving melodies, they are still among the most difficult works cellists play. Bach himself transcribed one of the suites for lute (No. 5, in C minor), and so the transfer to guitar follows a path forged by the composer himself.\n\nIn Baroque music, G Major typically signals a pastoral sound world: delightful, outdoorsy, free of conflict. Sun radiates from the famous opening notes. The cello dances with a special kind of peaceful enthusiasm that has rendered this Prelude among the most iconic three minutes in classical music. (Yo-Yo Ma’s recent rooftop video performance with a view to the hardly pastoral Empire State Building has garnered 15 million views.)\n\nAs in all Bach suites, the unaccompanied instrument has absolute freedom over timing, which allows for the per- former’s highly individual sense of how this dance suite should ebb and flow. So dance at your own risk. Although stylized, Bach knew the dances first-hand from his days at the Knight’s Academy in Lüneburg, where noble boys gathered to learn them from a French dancing master. (Guess who played in the band for these lucky fellows.) In the Allemande (the French word for German), the Prelude’s bouncy arpeggios have given way to the more reflective and lyrical scales that bring our hypothetical couple together, arm in arm. By contrast, the Courante is all hopping and jumping; accord- ing to a leading theorist at the time, every courante should convey “a mood of sweet expectation.” The heartwarming Sarabande gives way to two tender and graceful minuets and finally the Gigue, French relative of the Irish jig. Bach’s Gigue is light-footed and genial, the musical equivalent of a smile – which you may well note on the faces of those seated around you.\n\nAGUSTÍN BARRIOS MANGORÉ Three pieces for Solo Guitar\n\nAGUSTÍN BARRIOS MANGORÉ Three pieces for Solo Guitar\n\nVals, Op. 8, No. 3 (1928)\n\nDanza Paraguaya (1928)\n\nSueño en la Floresta (1917)\n\nAGUSTÍN BARRIOS MANGORÉ (1885-1944)\n\nAgustín Barrios was born to perform. First, probably, for sheep. Of indigenous Guaraní heritage, he grew up in the remote, agrarian Misiones district of Paraguay, where he picked up his father’s guitar at age seven. Admitted to the National College in Paraguay’s capital by age 15, Barrios also studied literature and was a lifelong poet later known to hand his fans autographed poems. But his true calling was to perform on the guitar, so he eagerly traveled through Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, and Chile. When he left South\n\nAmerica, in 1930, he crafted a new stage presence, renaming himself Nitsuga (Agustín backwards) Mangoré, a Guaraní chieftain, and donning feathers and headdress. Even without the elaborate costume, however, his charisma was legendary. He captivated audiences throughout Europe before “settling” in the Caribbean (Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Cuba, and finally El Salvador).\n\nMany of Mangoré’s 300+ known guitar works draw from Paraguayan folk influences, including the first two selections heard tonight. The yearning Vals, Op. 8, No. 3, is a vals criollo, a blend of the European waltz and Peruvian folk music. Danza Paraguaya (Paraguayan Dance) is a galopa, a lively version of the Paraguayan polka. Here the guitarist must negotiate two melodies plus a bouncing accompaniment with apparent ease and charm. Sueño en la Floresta\n\n(A Dream in a Forest) is an enchanting, extended work full of romantic fantasy and feeling. In the hands of a guitarist like Mangoré or Eliot Fisk who can master its atmospheric repeated notes, it casts a truly mesmerizing spell.\n\n5 Pieces from Latin America: Homage to Alirio Diaz (1923-2016) (on occasion of his centenary)\n\n5 Pieces from Latin America: Homage to Alirio Diaz\n\n(1923-2016) (on occasion of his centenary)\n\n“Por ti mi Corazón” (1912)\n\nMANUEL M. PONCE (1882-1948)\n\nVals Venezolano (“Angostura”) Vals Venezolano (“María Luisa”) Vals Venezolano (“Tatiana”) Seis por Derecho: Joropo ANTONIO LAURO (1917-1986)\n\nA composer’s name perches permanently atop a musical score, but the performer who may have instigated, motivated, or popularized that work rarely gets any billing at all. Mozart, for example, never would have penned his famous Queen of the Night aria if he hadn’t known for a fact that his sister-in-law, Josepha Hofer, could sing well into the stratosphere. But even if the performer doesn’t inspire a work’s composition, they can compel people to listen to it. Venezuelan guitarist Alirio Diaz did that for a swath of guitar music played today. He would have turned 100 this year.\n\nDiaz first learned the cuatro, a four-stringed folk instrument, giving him valuable insight into folk styles. After picking up the classical guitar, repeated successes led him toward studies in Siena with the great Andrés Segovia, who he succeeded as a professor in 1965. Mexican composer Manuel Ponce had arranged his song “Por ti mi Corazón” (“For you my heart”) as a solo guitar piece for Segovia in the ‘20s; Diaz later assumed Segovia’s mantle, performing and promoting Ponce’s music around the world. This is a deeply felt song of love and loss: “You were my passion and brightened my pathway like a song.” But now, “You will not return…and I die of love.”\n\nDiaz was especially crucial in popularizing the music of fellow Venezuelan Antonio Lauro, whose music he edited, performed, and recorded. Lauro excelled at the Vals, a Latin American blend of the European waltz (à la Chopin) and local folk music. While the folk-influence is palpable, these are often intricate, challenging pieces. They also have a personal dimension: he dedicated each to an important person in his life. He told a student that the one dedicated to his wife, María Luisa, is “as difficult as she is.” Others went to his daughter, his son, his niece (“Tatiana”), and his home- town (“Angostura”, Ciudad Bolívar’s ancient name).

As a child, he had learned mandolin from his music-loving father, a dock worker, and made a quick leap to guitar. Paganini composed this first sonata for guitar and violin not long after he set out on his own in the town of Lucca; here he astonished the locals with his violin facility, which apparently included using it to imitate the sounds of nearby farm animals. Don’t expect any such hee-haws in his elegant Sonata Concertata, nor the demonic, supernatural qualities later ascribed to Paganini’s playing; this sunny, charming work is closer in style to Mozart than to Liszt.\n\nPaganini generously shares his melodies between violin and guitar; this is by no means a violin showpiece with guitar accompaniment. The genial but sophisticated dialogue between the instruments would have been appreciated by his dedicatee, Emilia, married to Paganini’s Genoa patron, Gian Carlo di Negro. Negro was a nobleman and poet who loved to host literary salons, where he enjoyed improvising verses, kind of like early Italian hip hop. (What rhymes with ‘salami’?) Paganini may well have played the work here. Following the sunny first movement, a deeply felt Adagio draws upon the expressive vocabulary of opera. The third movement lightens up for a spritely rondo, which gives us an inkling of Paganini’s later, more brilliant style. He had just recently started the caprices for solo violin on which his fame would ultimately rest. For today, at least, he was content to share a spotlight with the guitar.\n\nGEORGE ROCHBERG Selections from American Bouquet\n\nSelections from American Bouquet (1997)\n\nGEORGE ROCHBERG (1918-2005)\n\n(Dedicated to Eliot Fisk)\n\n“My Heart Stood Still” (Richard Rodgers)\n\n“I Only Have Eyes for You” (Harry Warren)\n\n“Deep Purple” (Peter DeRose)\n\n“Notre Dame Blues” (George Rochberg)\n\nEliot Fisk, guitar\n\nIf you’d aspired to be a respectable composer in the mid- 20th century, you’d better make sure the public hated your music. Popularity was treated with suspicion, and dissonance had become a prerequisite of intellectual rigor. “The twelve-tone composers are the only ones who have a discipline I respect,” Igor Stravinsky said in 1952. By this\n\ntime, George Rochberg had already established himself as a brilliant twelve-tone composer, but in the 1960s he became dissatisfied with what he saw as dissonant music’s limitations. “Modernism ended up allowing us only a postage- stamp-sized space to stand on,” he later said, in 1983. “We cut the rest away.”\n\nThe catalyst for his reorientation was the tragic death of his teenage son in 1964, from a brain tumor. When Rochberg reintegrated a post-romantic tonal lyricism into his works to express his grief, he caused heated controversy among musical circles. Rochberg was unapologetic. “If I want to contrast dissonant chromaticism cheek by jowl with a more accessibly tonal style, I will do so. All human gestures are available to all human beings at any time.” His approach\n\nproved prophetic; today, he is seen as a proto postmodernist, among the first to draw from multiple musical styles within a single work. His Nach Bach (After Bach), for example, quotes\n\nJ.S. Bach one moment and dissolves into pungent dissonances the next. In American Bouquet, composed for Eliot Fisk, his source material is American popular songs of the 1920s and 30s. How dare he!\n\nRochberg ruminates upon his source material rather than merely transcribing it; as he explained, “I have not made ‘arrangements’ but ‘compositions’ in which the tunes are embedded as the essential melodic thread.” His starting point is Richard Rodgers’s 1927 hit, “My Heart Stood Still,” later recorded by Ella Fitzgerald, Frank Sinatra, and even Rod Stewart. This wistful tune creates a lover’s haze: “I took one glance at you, that’s all I meant to do, and then my heart stood still.” The haze becomes even thicker in Harry Warren’s 1934 “I Only Have Eyes for You”: “Are the stars out tonight? I don’t know if it’s cloudy or bright. I only have eyes for you.” Rochberg’s music is both achingly tender and virtuosic at the same time; it often seems to float off in the air. Nostalgia reigns in Rochberg’s take on Peter DeRose’s 1934 “Deep Purple (Dreams),” but Rochberg brings us back to earth with his stomp-worthy “Notre Dame Blues,” music entirely of his own invention. Who knows, you might even clap at the end.\n\nJ. S. BACH Chaconne from Partita in D minor, BWV 1004\n\nChaconne from Partita in D minor, BWV 1004\n\nJOHANN SEBASTIAN BACH (1685-1750),\n\narr. Eliot Fisk\n\nEliot Fisk, guitar\n\nThere are few works that fascinate professional musicians like Bach’s Chaconne for solo violin. “The Chaconne is, in my opinion, one of the most wonderful and most incom- prehensible pieces of music,” Johannes Brahms reflected. “Using the technique adapted to a small instrument, the man writes a whole world of the deepest thoughts and most powerful feelings. If I could picture myself writing, or even conceiving, such a piece, I am certain that the extreme excitement and emotional tension would have driven me mad.” The work’s allure has not abated; today, musical scholars often treat it like a puzzle in need of figuring out. They give lectures to highlight its proportional adherence to Fibonacci’s “golden section”; discuss whether one should play it more briskly, like a dance, rather than a grand statement; and speculate on whether it could be a musical monument to his late first wife, Maria Barbara.\n\nThe circumstances of its composition are indeed puzzling. Why would Bach end a dance suite of short movements with a 15-minute psychological tour (de force) of over 60 different emotional states? The chaconne is, technically speaking, a dance, but Bach’s theme could hardly be less dance-like: grand and somber, it spreads across all four strings with\n\nfull chords, as if Bach’s organ was condensed into a small wooden box. He applies his theme’s underlying harmony to variations, exploring the limits of violin technique and expression, as Brahms noted. But the ultimate triumph of the work is not its cleverness but its narrative continuity.\n\nThe emotions naturally lead from one to the next, through sadness, contemplation, struggle, relief, celebration, awe, and resignation. In short, it encapsulates the human experience.\n\nBrahms did take up the challenge of transcribing it for his own instrument (the piano), a path followed by at least 200 others, including Eliot Fisk. The guitar offers six strings to the violin’s four, a considerable advantage in negotiating Bach’s simultaneous melodies, or counterpoint. Yet the challenge remains, as Brahms said, to express “a whole world of the deepest thoughts and most powerful feelings.” And performers love a good challenge.\n\nENRIQUE GRANADOS “La Maja de Goya” from 12 Tonadillas en estilo antiguo\n\n“La Maja de Goya” from 12 Tonadillas en estilo antiguo (1912)\n\nENRIQUE GRANADOS (1867-1916), arr. Fisk\n\nEnrique Granados called the painter Francisco Goya “the representative genius of Spain.” After the 150th anniversary of Goya’s birth, in 1896, Spanish intellectuals asked whether the cultivation of Spanish traditions should or should not be central to modern life. Granados believed Goya had already provided an emphatic yes in his paintings of majos and majas – residents of Madrid who paraded their Spanish pride before their Napoleonic French occupiers by wearing flamboyant anachronistic costumes, with defiant attitudes to match. Granados’s tonadilla, originally for voice and piano, is a musical tribute to Goya. Because he portrayed the Spanish\n\nmaja in all her beauty and strength, the singer imagines Goya himself as her lover: “If I could find someone to love me like Goya loved me, I would no longer yearn for better luck.”\n\nGranados’ Goya project culminated in a monumental set of seven piano pieces, Goyescas, and finally in an opera of the same name, premiered in 1915 at the Metropolitan\n\nOpera in New York. On the way home, his passenger steam- ship was torpedoed by a German U-boat, rendering him a victim of another country’s desire to occupy Spain. Yet his music remains a monument of Spanish culture, alongside Goya’s paintings.\n\nERNESTO HALFFTER Habanera\n\nHabanera (1945)\n\nERNESTO HALFFTER (1905-1989), arr. Fisk\n\nAlthough Ernesto Halffter took his surname from his father, a Prussian jeweler, he was Spanish through and through. His mother, Rosario, was a gifted pianist, and, naturally, his teacher. He later studied with Manuel de Falla, who influenced much of his music. This jewel of a Habanera is so painfully charming (especially in Fisk’s own transcription), its final sound is almost guaranteed to be the audience sighing.\n\nISAAC ALBÉNIZ Sevilla from Suite española, No. 1, Op. 47\n\nSevilla from Suite española No. 1, Op. 47 (1886)\n\nISAAC ALBÉNIZ (1860-1909), arr. Fisk\n\nIsaac Albéniz was one of the greatest composers for guitar, which is truly impressive given that he never composed a single note for guitar. He didn’t even play it, yet his piano pieces work so beautifully for the instrument that he might as well have. Although Albéniz was a pianist, he frequently entered the world of flamenco guitar music via his imagination. A gifted improviser, he could hold forth in almost any style of Spanish music. In Sevilla, he evokes the noisy flamenco guitars. The commotion clears out for the flamenco singer’s free and soulful cante jondo (“deep song”) and then the revelry returns. French composers Debussy, Ravel, and Fauré all marveled at how Albéniz could produce such guitar-like sounds from the piano. However, his music most truly sounds like the guitar…when played on the guitar.\n\nLUIGI BOCCHERINI Quintet for Guitar and Strings, G. 448 (“Fandango”)\n\nLUIGI BOCCHERINI Quintet for Guitar and Strings, G. 448 (“Fandango”)\n\nPastorale\n\nAllegro maestoso\n\nGrave assai\n\nFandango\n\nEliot Fisk, guitar\n\nAsher Wulfman, violin\n\nSarah Berger, violin\n\nMelissa Matson, viola\n\nJulia Bruskin, cello\n\nA name like Luigi Boccherini leaves no one in doubt as to his national origins, but the man certainly got around. At age 15, he left his native Lucca to study in Rome, then off to Vienna for his solo cello debut, proceeding next to the salons of Paris (where most of his music would be published), and then to Spain to join the ranks of an opera orchestra in Aranjuez. The patron of the opera there happened to be the King of Spain’s brother, Crown Prince Luis; he took to Boccherini’s music and hired him full-time to compose music for the Spanish court. Compose he did: Boccherini was extraordinarily prolific, completing nearly 100 string quartets, 30 symphonies, and 12 cello concertos. But his favorite genre of all (100+) was the string quintet with two cellos, which allowed him to tag along with the resident string quartet on a second cello. The Quintet for Guitar and Strings heard tonight draws upon material from two of these quintets and refashions it into a quintet with one cello and guitar, penned at the behest of the guitar-playing Marquis of Benavente.\n\nThe players in Boccherini’s music are often in agreement, with two playing the same melody together in thirds or sixths. Not surprisingly, his music is highly agreeable. Boccherini preferred the idioms of the galant style: short, melodious snippets, bouncing repeated notes, and gallivant- ing arpeggios. To these he brought a daredevil’s sense of anti-gravity, sending the cello, in particular, far above its typically bass-bound register. (Boccherini purportedly enjoyed playing violin music on the cello at its original high pitch.) His Guitar Quintet begins with a Boccherini specialty, imported from Italy: the pastorale. Listen for the harmoniously chirping lovebirds (violins) and a rustling brook (guitar). Once this soothing daydream comes to an end, the cellist, who seems to have just benefited from a double espresso, cries “Wake up!” at the start of the energetic Allegro maestoso.\n\nThe cello plays well above the violins in this movement, eventually rousing the whole ensemble into high spirits. In a slow introduction to the final movement, the guitar comes to the fore as if to say, “Now, let’s go to Spain.” A Spanish fandango ensues. This sensual and lively dance for couples drew consternation from the Catholic Church until in 1764 the pope himself heard one, which he enjoyed well enough not to condemn it. Part of the fandango’s attraction is that it always seems to last longer than one expects, becoming wilder and wilder. The cellist starts to bounce the bow while playing a glissando (outrageous!), and finally, here come…the castanets! Luigi Boccherini may have started out an Italian, but this movement proves he ended up a Spaniard.\n\nJuly 28: The Danish String Quartet\n\nFriday, July 28\n\n8:00 PM\n\nFirst Presbyterian Church\n\n97 E Genesee St, Skaneateles\n\nTonight’s concert and artists are sponsored by: David Graham, Fred & Ginny Marty, and Peter & Betsy McKinnell\n\nThe Danish String Quartet may well be the world’s most in-demand string quartet. The foursome from Denmark has captivated audiences worldwide with its blend of apparent ease and wild abandon. Their program showcases both their mastery of classics by Bach, Haydn, and Russian composer Dmitri Shostakovich, as well as their inimitable, joyful renditions of Nordic folk music. Hear why the Danish Quartet is “the string quartet’s best hope.” (Wall Street Journal)\n\nHAYDN String Quartet, Op. 20, No. 3\n\nHAYDN String Quartet, Op. 20, No. 3\n\nAllegro con spirito\n\nMenuetto. Allegretto\n\nPoco Adagio\n\nAllegro molto\n\nString Quartet, Op. 20, No. 3 (1772)\n\nFRANZ JOSEPH HAYDN (1732-1809)\n\nHaydn’s String Quartets, Op. 20, are the bedrock of chamber music, composed at a time when the chamber was truly where one wanted to be. Today, so-called chamber music has long since migrated to the concert hall, and the chamber itself calls to mind stiff manners and the uncomfortable outfits that the cast of Bridgerton would prefer to remove as soon as possible.\n\nJoseph Haydn, on the other hand, dressed up just to compose, and he longed to get into a chamber. In the 1770s, he was stuck in the remote Hungarian countryside in the employ of the Esterházy family, far away from the chambers of London, Paris, and Vienna, places of lively social interaction where group conversation was considered an art form. One might discuss the latest controversial musings of Rousseau or serious political ideas, but also have a good laugh; wit was essential, but only to move the conversation forward, not merely to attract attention. Madame de Staël, the famous Parisian salon hostess-with-the-mostest, compared a good conversation to strong liquor, and especially to music: it animates the spirit. Haydn’s quartets are the kind of conversations we long for today but rarely get: four people with different viewpoints actually listening to each other with respect and good humor.\n\nThe initial topic of conversation in the first movement of this quartet is serious, posed vigorously by the first violin and viola. Lively commentary ensues, guided by the first violin (the hostess), and all seem convinced that the situation is not as bad as initially feared. Further inquiry, however, exposes the weaknesses of this more optimistic view. By the end of the movement, the first violin retreats to a pensive and troubled state, where she remains for the second movement, a minuet. A minuet is typically a light, outdoorsy dance, but the first violin’s dark rumination repeatedly brings the entire group to a halt; the others try to console her, but she ends up troubling them as well. In the middle section of the same movement, a street fiddler lightens the mood, providing welcome relief. The warm, gentle third movement is the kind that made Haydn’s quartets so beloved by players\n\nJ. S. BACH Selections from The Well-Tempered Clavier and The Art of Fugue\n\nSelections from The Well-Tempered Clavier and The Art of Fugue\n\nJOHANN SEBASTIAN BACH (1685-1750),\n\narr. Danish String Quartet\n\nThe exact selections will be announced from the stage.\n\nIn transferring these beloved keyboard pieces from one player to four, a string quartet might be accused of cheating. We keyboard players have long tied our fingers into pretzels trying to play up to five distinct parts with only two hands; our copies of The Well-Tempered Clavier are filled with ridiculous fingerings like “4-3” (slide your fourth finger to your third without lifting the note). On the other hand, the logic of assigning each voice to one string player can’t be denied. Mozart first realized this, arranging several of Bach’s fugues for string quartet, given at Baron van Swieten’s Bach-centric salon in 1782. He thus escaped playing them at the keyboard and surely enjoyed his single melody on the viola.\n\nBach himself, who gladly improvised five-voice fugues on the spot, didn’t seem to mind such intellectual and physical pretzel-tying. His prowess in counterpoint was so legendary that it apparently caused Louis Marchand, a superb French composer, to skip town in the middle of the night rather than face Bach in a fugue-off the next day. In a German’s methodical manner, he composed fugues in all 24 major and minor keys, preceded by preludes (Book 1, 1722). Always one to be thorough, he did the whole thing again 20 years later (Book 2, 1742). Together, these 48 preludes and fugues frequently have been dubbed the bible of keyboard music. This double grand tour of all keys was designed to demonstrate that a “well-tempered” keyboard rendered every major and minor key beautiful, each in its own way. This has to do with how the keyboard is tuned, so that each key is smooth and pleasing, but retains a slightly different sound than all the others. (String quartets can adjust their tuning as they go, for better or for worse.) Bach searches out a special emotional character for each prelude and fugue to match its key.\n\nAt the end of his life, Bach undertook a new project to showcase his contrapuntal skills, The Art of Fugue. Here, he did not specify an instrument, composing on four separate staves, as if for four separate instruments. However, Bach clearly rendered it playable on the harpsichord, and even today, the work is most often played on a single keyboard. String quartets have taken it on with increasing frequency, driven in part by the joy of getting inside it, like riding the gears inside a magnificent clock. Bach did not quite finish the work, nor can we be certain about the order of the movements. In any case, the concentration it demands from both players and listeners leads many to perform only selected movements. While there is a high intellectual component here, to say the least, one can find a simple pleasure in following the work’s theme as Bach sends it in and out of the four voices, turns it upside down, speeds it up, slows it down, and makes it disappear and reappear, like a magician with a mischievous rabbit.\n\nSHOSTAKOVICH String Quartet No. 7 in F-sharp minor, Op. 108\n\nSHOSTAKOVICH String Quartet No. 7 in F-sharp minor, Op. 108 (1960)\n\nDMITRI SHOSTAKOVICH (1906-1975)\n\nAllegretto\n\nLento\n\nAllegro – Allegretto\n\nNo one can say exactly what Shostakovich’s string quartets are about, but every listener knows they are about something. In Soviet Russia, the string quartet turned out to be the perfect medium for Shostakovich to express his most private thoughts and intense feelings. Since string quartets bore no titles and served no official function, they couldn’t get the composer into hot water with Soviet censors. These unenviable civil servants had the job of declaring whether music upheld the slippery state doctrine of “socialist realism.” Hm, does that G# shout socialism, to you? (Hard to say.) Ever since his opera, Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk, was condemned by Stalin himself, Shostakovich depended upon what historian Richard Taruskin calls “his capacity for maintaining a poker face.” Outwardly, he espoused Soviet doctrine, a necessity for survival. Inwardly, he gathered kindling for the fire of musical expression.\n\nOne clue to the thoughts and feelings expressed in his String Quartet No. 7 is its dedication to his first wife, who had died six years earlier from colon cancer. Yet this quartet is more a psychological state than an outpouring of longing or lament. Shostakovich’s tumultuous second marriage had just ended, health problems mounted, and he was under increasing state pressure to officially join the communist party. This music sounds closed in, like someone caught in a room that is shrinking. It is the shortest and tersest of all his quartets, much of it played with rubber mutes added to the strings. The first movement’s laconic, straight-faced main theme returns several times; its increasing impishness is punctuated by a few sinister moans. A nervous energy develops (which Shostakovich himself embodied), but this ultimately dissolves into resignation. The eerie second movement seems to express a yearning from deep within that is almost overcome by hopelessness.\n\nThe final movement begins suddenly with a fierce shout of the work’s original theme, now turned upside down. The viola, unmoved, at first continues its desolate moan from the second movement but then initiates a furious fugue (a perversion of Beethoven’s finale from Op. 59, No. 3). Fear, paranoia, and obsession reign until the quartet’s opening theme returns, first shouted and then in the form of a delicate, impish dance. There is a glimmer of underlying humor that seems to represent one’s ability to cope with bleak circumstances. It provides the catharsis that brings the work to a close on a major chord.\n\nTRADITIONAL Nordic Folk Music\n\nTRADITIONAL Nordic Folk Music\n\narr.

Mozart’s title (A Little Night Music) proves that composers never can tell what will turn out to be their greatest hit. Johann Pachelbel would surely be amazed to find that one of his least ambitious works, a certain Canon in D, accompanies millions of brides down the aisle. Imagine how the temperamental Beethoven would react to news that his trifle Für Elise gets more airtime than his Missa solemnis. And Mozart, author of well over 600 works in his 35 years, could scarcely have guessed that this diminutively titled work would capture public fancy the most, 236 years later. There is no sign he even intended to have it published, and it wasn’t, until long after his death.\n\nTo be fair, Mozart’s evening serenade is as good as an evening serenade gets. This is a mature, skillfully composed work, at once familiar and inventive, quickly drafted in 1787 alongside his operatic masterpiece, Don Giovanni.\n\nNo one expected such high-quality Nachtmusik, essentially disposable party music for a certain (in this case, unknown) occasion, but Mozart couldn’t help himself. In the famous first movement, Mozart gives us the impression that music is a language we all speak: the upward swing of the opening phrase (question!) quickly finds its downward partner (answer!), like witty, genial party conversation. The delicate second movement passes onward to a jovial minuet. A rondo with a laughing theme of “ha-ha-ha-ha” brings Mozart’s musical diversion to a close.\n\nOh, and if you ever feel you’ve heard Mozart’s greatest hit one too many times, surely P. D. Q. Bach’s A Little Nightmare Music will cure you.\n\nVIJAY IYER Mozart Effects\n\nMozart Effects (2011)\n\nVIJAY IYER (B. 1971)\n\nAnna Elashvili, violin\n\nItamar Zorman, violin\n\nKyle Armbrust, viola\n\nJulia Bruskin, cello\n\nSon of Indian Tamil immigrants, American pianist-composer Vijay Iyer was born in Albany and grew up outside Rochester. After completing a degree in math and physics at Yale, he pursued a PhD in Physics at UC Berkeley but shifted his studies toward music cognition, an interest that has some bearing on Mozart Effects, composed for the Brentano Quartet (which appeared at the Skaneateles\n\nFestival in 1994). In the meantime, Iyer has grown into one of the most outside-the-box musicians of our time: a brilliant and successful jazz pianist, he also composes fully notated music for the likes of the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Silkroad Ensemble. His music brings together the rhythms of South Asia, idioms of Duke Ellington and Thelonious Monk, and an awareness of classical music.\n\nIn his commission for the Brentano Quartet, Iyer was tasked with “completing” a one-minute unfinished sketch by Mozart, K. 417d. About the new work and its title, he writes:\n\nIn 1993, a short research article was published in Nature claiming that listening to Mozart could induce a short-term IQ boost in the area of ‘spatial task performance.’ The control conditions in the experiment were ‘relaxation’ and ‘silence,’ not ‘Brahms’ or ‘Ellington,’ so there was nothing in the study to show that this effect was unique to Mozart. (On the other hand, for all they knew, the effect could have been wholly specific to the Sonata for Two Pianos in D Major, K. 448, the only piece used in the study.)\n\nNonetheless, sensationalized news about ‘the Mozart effect’ touched off a nationwide Mozart frenzy. Something about that brazenly Eurocentric claim ‘Mozart makes you smarter’ seemed to offer a quick fix for everything wrong in America. Adding to the furor, the governor of Georgia at the time decreed that every baby born in the state would receive a Mozart CD upon leaving the hospital. The self-help industry had a field day: You too can touch the untouchable genius of a great master! Unlock your true potential while you sleep! It was good old-fashioned snake oil – let’s call it Wolfgang’s revenge.\n\nFinally, in 2007 a Requiem for the Mozart effect arrived, in the form of a thorough scientific review published by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research in Germany. The conclusion: if we experience any cognitive boost at all from passive listening, it is very brief, very small, and equal for all types of music. But null results are never newsworthy, so word didn’t quite get around; the story was buried in a pauper’s grave. Few have been disabused of the idea of the Mozart effect today, and those who have still wish it to be true anyway. For a composer, to be tasked with ‘finishing’ an unfinished piece by Mozart is to serve as the punchline to a joke. There was no one I told about this commission who didn’t burst out laughing. Perhaps we are all Salieri, still haunted by those infernal cackles – Wolfgang’s revenge, yet again.\n\nMOZART Exsultate, jubilate for Soprano and Strings, K. 165\n\nExsultate, jubilate for Soprano and Strings, K. 165 (1773)\n\nWOLFGANG AMADEUS MOZART (1756-1791)\n\nExsultate, jubilate – Allegro\n\nFulget amica dies – Secco Recitative\n\nTu virginum corona – Andante\n\nAlleluja – Molto allegro\n\nKearstin Piper Brown, soprano\n\nAnna Elashvili, violin\n\nItamar Zorman, violin\n\nKyle Armbrust, viola\n\nJulia Bruskin, cello\n\nEdward Castilano, bass\n\nMozart loved sopranos. Quite literally: after meeting the four soprano sisters of the Weber family in Mannheim, he flirted with three of them, proposed to two of them, and married one of them (Constanza). Mozart had also been a soprano himself, performing several times in public until his voice broke at age 13. By that time, he had already composed four operas with soprano leads, and when he composed his Latin motet, Exsultate, jubilate, he had just finished his eighth, Lucio Silla, at age 16. However, this new motet was not composed for a soprano, technically speaking. While in Milan for his opera production, he composed the motet for the leading man in the opera, Venanzio Rauzzini. Yes, leading man (primo uomo): Rauzzini was a castrato. A (shall we say) biological alteration allowed him a ravishing yet powerful high vocal range, and Mozart greatly admired his musicianship. Exsultate, jubilate was a gift of sorts for Rauzzini, who gave its premiere in church on January 17, 1773, performing Mozart’s opera later that same day.\n\nExsultate, jubilate is essentially a concerto for voice, one of Mozart’s most virtuosic creations. The text is of somewhat secondary importance; Rauzzini himself may have penned it, but Mozart altered it for performances in Salzburg several years later. The first word, “rejoice,” sums up the overall spirit of the work. Like an instrumental concerto, the ensemble plays first, establishing an exultant atmosphere. Mozart saves the real rejoicing for the singer, however, who emits exhilarating flurries of sixteenth notes that flow through the full soprano range.\n\nA serious recitative briefly tells of storms and night, followed by “unexpected calm” and joy for a “fortunate dawn.” The lyrical second section, a prayer to the Virgin Mary, is the emotional heart of the work. Here the 16-year-old Mozart shows just how far his gift for melody had already developed; his greatest opera arias are only a hop, skip, and jump from here. The concluding “Alleluia” is so brilliant, sopranos keep it in their back pocket (so to speak) in case they need a showstopper. Mozart loved sopranos, and, thanks to music like this, sopranos love Mozart.\n\nBRAHMS Piano Quartet in C minor, Op. 60\n\nPiano Quartet in C minor, Op. 60 (1875)\n\nJOHANNES BRAHMS (1833-1897)\n\nAllegro non troppo\n\nScherzo\n\nAndante\n\nAllegro comodo\n\nItamar Zorman, violin\n\nKyle Armbrust, viola\n\nJulia Bruskin, cello\n\nAaron Wunsch, piano\n\nAnyone looking for a genial, easy-going piece of chamber music should avoid Brahms’ Piano Quartet in C minor. “On the cover you must have a picture of a head with a pistol to it,” Brahms wrote to his publisher. “Now you can form some conception of the music! I’ll send you my photograph for the purpose.” Brahms was only half joking. He had started the work 20 years earlier, at the age of 22, during a time of romantic fervor and personal tumult. He had become infatuated with Clara Schumann, wife of his mentor, Robert Schumann; Robert recently had been committed to an asylum with “psychotic melancholia” after a suicide attempt. Meanwhile, Brahms had immersed himself in romantic literature by Goethe and E. T. A. Hoffmann, including Goethe’s tale of a suicidal young man in love, Sorrows of the Young Werther. Now, 20 years later, Brahms cast his younger self in the role of Werther; he suggested his publisher to paint Werther’s costume, a blue coat and yellow breeches, over his own photograph.\n\nBrahms had a clear model for his tragic piano quartet: Mozart’s Piano Quartet in G minor, composed in 1785 at a time when almost all chamber music was genial. But whereas Mozart relented his tragic tone after the first movement, Brahms maintains it through much of his quartet. By the 1870s, chamber music had largely migrated from the chamber to the concert hall and demanded a more serious tone, virtuosity from the players, and a thicker overall sound. Brahms himself performed the premiere of this work in Vienna’s newly completed, temple-like Musikverein; today, the chamber music auditorium there is fittingly called Brahms Hall.\n\nBrahms establishes the gun-to-the-head atmosphere with severe octaves from the piano; the strings respond with despairing, two-note sighs. These turn into a longer melody that some scholars believe spells out Clara’s name (C-B[L]-A- G#[R]-A, here transposed to Eb-D-C-B-C). However autobi- ographical, its tragedy quickly amplifies with an outbreak of crashing chords. Once these dissipate, a noble and lyrical second theme reveals the true character of our protagonist. Both conflict and heroism lie ahead in the central section of the movement. A tumultuous coda crashes into the same note that opened the movement, and finally the music sinks back into sorrow and despair. The second movement bears the title “Scherzo,” the Italian word for joke, but good luck finding a single moment of humor in it. A fierce battle is immediately underway, with only a few moments of respite to come. Unlike the first movement, however, this one ends in triumph, with three C Major chords.\n\nCellists everywhere dream of playing the third movement, which begins with one of the most heartrending cello melodies in the entire repertoire. This can only be music of love, alternatingly ardent and tender. Brahms wisely chose the peaceful key of E Major for it, a welcome respite from tragic C minor. The final movement returns to that key, beginning uneasily with a four-note rhythmic motive borrowed from Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony (also in C minor). After a struggle, a heavenly chorale descends, played by the strings with a halo provided by the piano. Alas, our protagonist cannot, or will not, be redeemed, and the work ends in resignation.\n\n2023 Community Outreach Events: Following Harriet\n\n2022-23 marks the 200th anniversary of the birth (exact date unknown) of Harriet Tubman, famed abolitionist and Underground Railroad conductor. Tubman touched the lives of many who fought for freedom. Yet the journey continues today as American society debates what freedom means for individuals and society at large. We began the celebration of her legacy in 2022 with our Freedom Sounds theme. In 2023, the Following Harriet project invites composers, performing artists, longtime and new listeners of the Festival to learn from Tubman’s vision, courage, fortitude, and civic responsibility. This is a critical juncture as we emerge from the pandemic with focus, clarity, and vigor about the potential for music to move the needle towards wholeness and inclusion in the Central New York region and beyond.\n\nCredit for new Harriet Tubman image: “Beacon of Hope” by Nettrice Gaskins (2021).\n\nFriday, August 4 • 1:00 PM Seward House Museum\n\n33 South Street, Auburn NY\n\nPremiere of Fortitude, a Festival- commissioned dramatic portrayal of Harriet Tubman, featuring rising opera star Kearstin Piper Brown.\n\nThis event is free and open to the public, no ticket is required.\n\nMonday, August 14 • 5:30 PM Salt City Market\n\n484 S Salina St, Syracuse, NY 13202\n\nSolo performance featuring classical saxophonist Steven Banks.\n\nLocated outdoors in the “alleyway” in front of the mural\n\nThis event is free and open to the public, no ticket is required.\n\nTuesday, August 15 • 11:30 AM Upstate Cancer Center\n\n750 E Adams Street, Syracuse NY\n\nSaxophonist Steven Banks is joined by pianist Xak Bjerken.

Samuel Barber’s intense Cello Sonata (with Artistic Directors Julia Bruskin and Aaron Wunsch), William Grant Still’s Violin Suite based on Harlem Renaissance art and spirituals, and selections from the Great American Songbook are preludes to a Festival-commissioned dramatic portrayal of Harriet Tubman by Nailah Nombeko, featuring rising opera star Kearstin Piper Brown.\n\nBARBER Sonata for Cello and Piano, Op. 6\n\nSonata for Cello and Piano, Op. 6 (1932)\n\nSAMUEL BARBER (1910-1981)\n\nAllegro ma non troppo Adagio\n\nAllegro appassionato\n\nJulia Bruskin, cello Aaron Wunsch, piano\n\nIn the 1920s and 30s, young artists found inspiration in the new kinetic metropolis; George Gershwin, for example, said the steely rhythms of a train inspired Rhapsody in Blue. Not so for Samuel Barber. “Skyscrapers, subways, and train lights play no part in the music I write,” Barber told a music critic in 1935. Ideas for his Cello Sonata came to him on a hiking trip from Switzerland to Italy, and when he arrived at the family villa of his hiking (and romantic) partner, composer Giancarlo Menotti, he quickly started composing. “I wrote it entirely without [a] piano,” he proudly explained to his parents in a letter.\n\nOne can imagine the opening of the Cello Sonata was inspired by the craggy mountain peaks he had just crossed. Its opening themes are powerful and elemental, as if carved from granite. Yet the core of Barber’s music is always emotional. “I write what I feel,” Barber later said to explain his compositional method. Sincerity became a hallmark of his music at a time when grand emotions were treated with suspicion and irony was in. The lyrical second theme here is unabashedly romantic, pure, and heartfelt – as if from a modern Brahms. The structure of the movement, too, is Brahmsian, with well-ordered themes that convey a clear narrative.\n\nAt the opening of the second movement, the cellist steps fully into the role of a singer. Barber studied voice and was an accomplished baritone, and this expertise lent itself to the cello’s lyrical gifts. As one critic put it, in 1936, “the composer…never forgets that the instrument he is writing for was intended to sing and he gives it ample opportunity to do so.” This sad song is interrupted by a sparkling scherzo, which dances like beams of sunlight glittering on Lake Lugano beneath the villa where Barber composed the Sonata. The time he spent in Europe with Menotti was some of the happiest and the most musically productive of his life. The final movement is oceanic. Barber marked it “appassionato,” which applies to a darkly hued melody buoyed on a sea of arpeggios. Barber’s lyricism is modern in that it tends toward the darker end of the emotional spectrum, as his famous Adagio for Strings (to be heard on August 12) attests. The Sonata ends defiantly as the cello belts out its lowest note.\n\nMARGARET BONDS Troubled Water\n\nTroubled Water (1967)\n\nMARGARET BONDS (1913-1972)\n\nAaron Wunsch, piano\n\nThe African American spiritual tradition provided a well-spring of inspiration for pianist and composer Margaret Bonds. Not only did she recognize the latent musical possibilities of this source material, but she could personally relate to its themes of adversity, persistence, and spiritual triumph. Her father, a successful doctor, was denied admission to the American Medical Association based on his race, so he proceeded to form an association for black doctors.\n\nGrowing up in Chicago, she was fortunate to study with Florence Price, who had already started to integrate the spiritual with classical forms. A formidable pianist, Bonds was the first black soloist to appear with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, at age 20, performing Florence Price’s Piano Concerto. She was also one of the few black students admitted to Northwestern University, where she faced discrimination; at a low moment, she discovered a volume of poetry by Langston Hughes in the Library basement and resolved to meet and work with him, which she did. After coming to New York to study at Juilliard, she moved to Harlem and collaborated with Hughes on numerous projects. She also formed a music society to promote the works of black composers.\n\nTroubled Water, based on the spiritual “Wade in the Water,” dates from the height of the Civil Rights Era, in which Bonds took an active role. She had played a version of it in the 1950s designed for audiences to sing along, and now she refashioned it as a powerful and virtuosic solo work. The refrain, “Wade in the water…God’s a gonna trouble the water,” likely refers to enslaved people who sought a path to freedom through clouded river water that leaves footprints untraceable. Civil Rights leader John Lewis drew another meaning out of it, however, with the phrase “Make good trouble.” The spiritual melody here is always front and center, but Bonds integrates it with modern harmonies and knuckle-busting virtuosity, infused with a spirit reflective of the 1960s. A reflective middle section draws from the sensuous harmonies of French music, while the coda presses fast and furious with stark parallel fifths. It is fearless, persistent, and determined to win you over.\n\nWILLIAM GRANT STILL Suite for Violin and Piano\n\nSuite for Violin and Piano (1943)\n\nWILLIAM GRANT STILL (1895-1978)\n\nAfrican Dancer\n\nMother and Child\n\nGamin\n\nThough music is invisible, we often speak about it as if it has three dimensional properties: surface, thickness, structure. In his Violin Suite, William Grant Still renders these qualities more palpable by tying each movement to an actual sculpture by Harlem Renaissance artists: Richmond Barthé’s African Dancer, Sargent Johnson’s Mother and Child, and Augusta Savage’s Gamin. The music brings these frozen figures to life.\n\nStill grew up in Little Rock, Arkansas, where his early exposure to music included RCA classical records brought home by his stepfather and African American spirituals sung by his formerly enslaved maternal grandmother. He had a knack for teaching himself to play instruments, including the cello and oboe, but his greatest proficiency was on the violin. Still’s mother preferred he study law, but he chose to study classical music at Oberlin College. In the following year, he was hired by W. C. Handy, “the father of the blues,” as an arranger. Still, who followed Handy to New York\n\nCity, where Still worked with poet Langston Hughes and other artists of the Harlem Renaissance (including our three sculptors). His Afro-American Symphony, premiered by the Rochester Philharmonic in 1931, became the most frequently performed American symphonic work of its era by a composer of any race.\n\nThe athletic joy in the first movement of the Violin Suite reflects the ecstatic “African Dancer” depicted in Barthé’s sculpture. Still’s skillful treatment of the violin here demonstrates his expertise on the instrument he formally studied from age 15. Relief from the hard charging dance comes in a lyrical episode that brings the African dancer to America, via the blues. Still came to believe that the blues, rather than the spiritual, provided a compass for the future of African American music. The soulful second movement, “Mother and Child,” however, does show some influence of lullaby-like spirituals, such as “Steal Away to Jesus,” even if its rich, chromatic harmonies are more contemporary. It also reflects the smooth, modern lines of Johnson’s sculptures.\n\nThe third movement captures the mischief and cleverness visible in Augusta Savage’s sculpture of a street urchin, Gamin, now in the Smithsonian Museum. Despite untold hardships, this boy makes the best of the hand he’s been dealt. Still’s infectious, virtuosic music persuades us to hope he can succeed beyond the expectations we’ve set for him based on his social status and race – as Still himself did.\n\nItamar Zorman, violin Aaron Wunsch, piano\n\nNAILAH NOMBEKO Fortitude\n\nFortitude (2023)\n\nNAILAH NOMBEKO (B. 1976)\n\n(World Premiere, commissioned by the Skaneateles Festival) Text by Alicia Haymer\n\nKearstin Piper Brown, soprano\n\nItamar Zorman, violin\n\nAnna Elashvili, violin\n\nKyle Armbrust, viola\n\nJulia Bruskin, cello\n\nNailah Nombeko is from (and currently lives in) New York City, where she studied at the LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and the Mannes College of Music. Her vocal settings of diverse poetry from William Blake to Mahzi Kane are especially sensitive to the text, and she recently composed a string quartet for Ethel, premiered at National Sawdust in Brooklyn. She brings both song and quartet genres together in Fortitude, commissioned by the Skaneateles Festival for the 200th anniversary of Harriet Tubman’s birth. About the new work, Nombeko writes:\n\n“The opening violin solo marks the uncertainty of what Harriet Tubman was about to embark on. Although she was confident that this was a godly mission, the outcome was still unknown. All throughout this section Harriet was summoning the strength to escape.\n\nThere are two refrains that mark a bright spot where Harriet gathered her strength. Both refrains are woven between painful recollections of life as a slave and her escape. It was important for the melodic material in both refrains to be memorable. This helps to give the listener something to be anchored into as they follow this story. Refrain #1 marks the first place where I commit to a key. The sections where Harriet recalled life as a slave are intentionally keyless. This helps to highlight the level of uncertainty and distress that she felt.\n\nFrom the Great American Songbook: HAROLD ARLEN A Sleepin’ Bee, JEROME KERN Can’t Help Loving That Man, COLE PORTER So In Love, HAROLD ARLEN Over the Rainbow\n\nFrom the Great American Songbook:\n\nHAROLD ARLEN A Sleepin’ Bee (1954)\n\nJEROME KERN (1885-1945) / OSCAR HAMMERSTEIN II (1895-1960) Can’t Help Loving That Man (1927)\n\nCOLE PORTER (1891-1964) So In Love (1948)\n\nHAROLD ARLEN (1905-1986) Over the Rainbow (1939)\n\nKearstin Piper Brown, soprano\n\nAaron Wunsch, piano\n\nThe so-called Great American Songbook is great enough not to be containable in any one book. Its boundaries are loosely defined as influential songs from Broadway musicals,\n\nTin Pan Alley, and Hollywood films, from the 1920s to the 1960s. They often transcend their source material and are adaptable as both jazz standards and as concert pieces. Jerome Kern’s 1927 musical Show Boat is a familiar start- ing point, proving that the American musical need not be merely comedic. “Can’t Help Loving That Man” is a love song of sorts, but not only: Kern and Hammerstein apply it to a larger dramatic purpose in Show Boat, reprising it several times. Julie sings it to younger Magnolia as proof that once one has fallen in love, climbing out of it won’t be easy. But the song is framed as familiar only to African Americans, and through the boat’s black cook, the audience realizes that Julie is passing as white. Even aside from the plot, this song can be heartbreaking, as anyone who has heard Lena Horne sing it can attest.\n\nBy the 1940s, comedic musicals had transcended vaudeville, thanks in part to lyrics like those from Cole Porter in Kiss Me, Kate. The title lyric “So In Love” sounds simple enough, but Lilli (playing Shakespeare’s Katherine, the “shrew”) reveals that she is still in love with her divorced husband, the egotistical Fred (playing Petruchio), so the situation in this play-within-a-play is considerably more complicated. Porter’s brilliant lyrics bear out these complexities: “Taunt me, and hurt me, deceive me, desert me, I’m yours ‘til I die: so in love am I.” The song has been recorded by everyone from Ella Fitzgerald to Julie Andrews to Plácido Domingo.\n\nKiss Me, Kate’s producer went on to mount House of Flowers in 1954; never heard of it? It was a flop, but not for lack of talent. Truman Capote wrote the story on which it’s based, about bordellos battling for business in Haiti, and Harold Arlen provided the calypso-blues score. Its use of the steel pan drew attention, but Diahanne Carroll stole the show with her rendition of “A Sleepin’ Bee,” a song about her “one true love,” who, by the way, has yet to be found. The first line already shows her naivete: “When a bee lies sleepin’ in the palm of your hand. ” (No chance that bee will sting you, surely.) Carroll went on to become the first black woman to win a Tony award for best actress, in 1962.\n\nHollywood learned early on that an extra musical asset to a film, beyond its score, can be a single good song. The prototype, which has yet to be improved upon, was Harold Arlen’s “Over the Rainbow,” composed for The Wizard of Oz (1939). Of course, it also helps if Judy Garland is the one singing it. Arlen was on his way down Sunset Boulevard to a Chinese restaurant when the tune hit him; he pulled over and wrote out the melody, which itself resembles a rainbow, rising upward an entire octave before floating back down. Studio head Louis B. Mayer felt the song slowed down the movie and had it deleted; the director and others lobbied for it to be included and eventually prevailed. Who knows what other great songs may have actually died via the editor’s guillotine? At least the stories these songs tell are safe with you, in the concert hall.\n\nAugust 5: Kelli O’Hara, Songs From my Heart\n\n8:00 PM Concert\n\nRobinson Pavilion at Anyela’s Vineyard\n\nRain Location: TBA\n\nTonight’s concert is made possible with support from: The Noreen and Michael Falcone Fund for Artistic Excellence\n\nKelli O’Hara is sponsored by Steve and Kelly Scheinman\n\nDan Lipton is sponsored by Koko Fuller\n\nMedia Sponsor:\n\nFeatured Advertiser: Mackenzie Hughes\n\nStar of stage and screen, Kelli O’Hara, has established herself as one of Broadway’s greatest leading ladies.

When a child plays an instrument, parents play the roles of practice coach, cabby, caddy, publicity agent, and applauder in chief. Eleanor Alberga’s mother did this for her in Kingston, Jamaica; from age five, she studied piano and soon after composed her first piece, Andy, named for her family’s golden Labrador retriever. As a teenager she joined the Jamaican Folk Singers but soon\n\nafter received a scholarship to study at the Royal Academy of Music in London, where she now teaches. After the passing of her mother, she composed this tender, loving tribute to the person who first fostered her musical gifts. It is subtly based on a Jamaican folk song (later recorded by Harry Belafonte), “Come back, Liza,” which goes: “Ev’ry time me remember Liza, water come a’ me eye.” Like the folk song, Remember is emotional, and not without grief, but it also seems to quietly say what we rarely tell our parents soon enough: “Thank you.”\n\nGRIEG Holberg Suite, Op. 40\n\nHolberg Suite, Op. 40 (1885)\n\nEDVARD GRIEG (1843-1907)\n\nPraeludium\n\nSarabande\n\nGavotte\n\nAir\n\nRigaudon\n\nIf Grieg’s Holberg Suite doesn’t quite sound like his famous Peer Gynt, well, that’s entirely the point. To commemorate the 200th birthday of philosopher-playwright and fellow Bergen native Ludvig Holberg (1684-1754), Grieg composed this suite “in the olden style,” as the score declares. This was as much an act of imagination as historical practice. Grieg applied his knowledge of French and German Baroque music to the work, but the spirit of Norwegian folk music prevails, as if Handel ended up frolicking in the fields out- side Bergen.\n\nGrieg was indeed commissioned to compose an outdoor work for Holberg’s bicentenary: the town council specifically requested a cantata for male voices that could be performed next to the new Holberg statue as it was unveiled. Unfortunately for Grieg, Holberg’s birthday was on December 3. As anyone who has wintered in Norway knows, an outdoor performance in December could be less than optimal. Grieg complained to a friend: “I can see it all before me, snow, hail, storm and every kind of foul weather, huge male choir with open mouths, the rain streaming into them, myself conducting with waterproof cape, winter coat, galoshes, and umbrella…. Oh well, it’s one way of dying for one’s country!” After this ill-fated cantata, Grieg proceeded to pen a suite “From Holberg’s time” for piano; it sounds more outdoorsy than the cantata but could be safely per- formed inside, on the piano. In the following year, after audiences were consistently charmed by it, he arranged it for string orchestra, and it remains one of his most popular works.\n\nThe opening Prelude is surely music of springtime, not winter. The violins and viola rustle and bustle with energy as an optimistic, lyrical theme soars above. The gentle Sarabande, a slow Baroque dance, reminds one of Bach’s sarabande for solo cello in the same key (performed by Eliot Fisk on July 26), but the harmonic inflections point toward Grieg’s own Norwegian idioms, and the texture is richly romantic. A rustic Gavotte follows, marked by the drone bass typically associated with folk music. A songful, minor-key Air comes next, which Grieg marks “Andante religioso.” J. S. Bach’s spirit hovers over this dignified yet emotional lament.\n\nThe final movement, Rigaudon, takes its name from a lively French Baroque dance. While this movement’s poised middle section might take its cue from a courtly French ballroom, the beginning and ending sound more like a hardanger fiddle playing to a Norwegian field. In summer, of course.\n\nSCHUBERT arr. Mahler String Quartet No. 14, D. 810 (“Death and the Maiden”)\n\nString Quartet No. 14, D. 810 (“Death and the Maiden”) FRANZ SCHUBERT (1797-1828),\n\narr. Gustav Mahler (1860-1911)\n\nAllegro\n\nAndante con moto\n\nScherzo: Allegro molto\n\nPresto\n\nIn Schubert’s Vienna, death was visible in ways foreign to our society, which tends to hide it. The reasons were both cultural and circumstantial. A local tradition known as “schöne Leich’,” or “beautiful corpse,” consisted of dressing the corpse of a beloved deceased person in finery and parading it through the streets for all to see. Public funeral processions were therefore common, as Schubert himself could tell you; he was a torchbearer at Beethoven’s funeral parade in 1827, which drew some 30,000 spectators. Death was also visible in ways more horrific than honorific. Mortality rates were on the rise; Vienna had no modern hospital, no sewer system, nor any reliable source for clean water, and pollution rose dramatically due to sudden industrialization. Nine of Schubert’s siblings died in infancy, while only four survived, and that was hardly atypical.\n\nSchubert’s preoccupation with death was also personal. He had secondary syphilis, which turned his thoughts increasingly morbid. In 1824, the year he composed his “Death and the Maiden” Quartet, he wrote to his friend, Leopold Kupelwieser: “I find myself to be the most unhappy and wretched creature in the world. Imagine a man whose health will never be right again, and who in sheer despair continually makes things worse and worse instead of better…I ask you, is he not a miserable, unhappy being? …Upon retiring to bed each night I hope that I may not wake again, and each morning only recalls yesterday’s grief.” Despite this dramatic pronouncement, his quartet expresses the will to live far more than it wallows in misery.\n\nSchubert chose to anchor his new quartet with variations on the chordal accompaniment from his own song, “Death and the Maiden,” composed when he had just turned 20. The text by Matthias Claudius depicts death gently embracing a young woman who struggles to stay alive. Whereas musical expressions of death are almost invariably in the minor mode, the skeletal embrace here is warm and comforting, in a major key – rendering it equally terrifying. Schubert’s variations in the second movement are a kind of psychological rumination on his theme – anxious, defiant, terrified, and finally, accepting. Given his health condition, one can’t help but imagine Schubert working through his own emotions in this music.\n\nPreceding the variations is a highly dramatic opening movement; it starts with a dynamic of fortissimo (very loud), as if to shout, “I wish I were a symphony!” The great Viennese composer/conductor Gustav Mahler got the message, adapting the quartet for string orchestra some 75 years later. After the variations comes a short but extremely stubborn Scherzo; a delicate trio section tries to look back to a happier time, with mixed success. The final movement is in the style of an Italian saltorello, a fast dance in triple meter that typically involves jumping and convulsive arm motions. The relentless quality here suggests a totentanz (dance of death). It is punctuated by a grand chorale that offers a glimpse of redemption, but the earthly struggle ensues with ever more determination. Death may be lurking, but Schubert refuses to embrace it.\n\nPrelude Concert\n\nFeaturing the 2023 Robinson Award winner, Paul Di Folco, piano\n\nFriday, August 11\n\n7:00 PM Prelude Concert\n\n(for ticket holders only)\n\nLOWELL LIEBERMAN Gargoyles, Op. 29\n\nSHOSTAKOVICH Sonata for Cello and Piano, Op. 40\n\nDEBUSSY L’isle joyeuse\n\nAugust 11: Angels and Ghosts\n\nFriday, August 11\n\n8:00 PM Concert\n\nFirst Presbyterian Church\n\n97 E Genesee St, Skaneateles\n\nTonight’s concert is sponsored by: Don & Chacea Sundman\n\nECCO is sponsored by Armory Square Ventures, Somak Chattopadhyay & Pia Sawhney, and Jessica & Toby Millman\n\nNick Kendall is sponsored by Kevin & Sarah Goode\n\nShai Wosner is sponsored by Jacqueline Jones, Finger Lakes Sotheby’s International Realty\n\nAaron Wunsch is sponsored by The Skaneateles Consortium: George Bain, Sam & Debby Bruskin, Dana & Susan Hall, and Judy Robertson\n\nPianist Shai Wosner, known for his “remarkable blend of the intellectual, physical and even devilish sides of performance” (Chicago Sun Times), joins members of ECCO for a program of music from the spiritual to the spooky: J.

B.\n\nBeating – Quarreling\n\nPlay with Infinity\n\nGyörgy Kurtág is one among a remarkable generation of Hungarian performers and composers for whom music is far more than an entertainment, even more than a passion – it is an essential anchor of meaning in a life splintered by war and conflict. This generation witnessed both the Nazi and Communist occupations, as well as the failed revolution of 1956. Kurtág recalled: “I realized to the point of despair that nothing I had believed to constitute the world was true.”\n\nIn the 1950s, Kurtag visited a psychologist, who suggested exploring all the relationships that are possible between just two notes. This exploration resulted in a new, distinctive compositional style: very short pieces of typically 30 seconds to 3 minutes in length that highlight the beauty of expressive musical gestures.\n\nAt the same time, Kurtág studied the music of J. S. Bach, the model of integrity and purity, arranging selections from his large-scale public works for the intimate genre of piano four-hands, thereby enshrining the music in private. In recent years, however, Kurtág has frequently performed these transcriptions in public with his wife, Marta, usually on an upright piano where the keyboard faces the audience, as if to invite the listeners in on the intimate experience of playing in private.\n\nBeginning and ending our set is Kurtág’s signature Bach transcription, Gottes Zeit ist die allerbeste Zeit (“God’s time is the best of all possible times”), the first movement of Bach’s funeral cantata, originally scored for two flutes, viols, and continuo. It simply yet profoundly conveys both consolation and quiet joy, the harmony of life and death: a view of the world as it should be, not as it is. The inviting first movement of Bach’s Trio Sonata in E-Flat Major follows, originally for hands and feet (organ). Counterpoint, the name for multiple independent melodies heard at the same time, can often seem “difficult” to listeners, but Bach’s miracle here is to render it delightful and even charming.\n\nNext is Kurtág’s own flight of contrapuntal whimsy, Homage to J. S. B. (guess who). These pieces are called Games (Jatékok), so expect some playing. The childish Beating – Quarreling, for example, reminds us that adults are perfectly capable of fight- ing like children. Yet some of these “games” are also mystical; Play with Infinity depicts the fleeting events of life against the backdrop of the eternal ‘tick tock’ of time. After this contemplation of mortality follows Bach’s searching chorale, Out of the depths I cry to you, where a lone anguished voice rises, searching for answers. In Bach’s world, at least, those answers could be found. This search comes to the present with Furious Chorale, which combines an argumentative idea with a Bach-like chorale, a strange intersection of anger and serenity. One more voice from far away allows us to hear the distant voice from beyond that we yearn to hear, and the return of our opening number, Gottes Zeit, brings us home.\n\nJ. S. BACH arr.

Whereas classical chamber music usually begins with a genial gesture, Beethoven’s Trio goes off like an accidentally ignited pile of firecrackers. This upward launch has all three instruments playing at top speed and volume. The cello hovers longer than the others, and after a surprising low note from the piano, the trio relaxes into a more comfortable pose with a sunny disposition. This music won’t settle down for long, however; Beethoven marks it “Allegro vivace e con brio,” which one could loosely translate as “Fast, energetic, and did I say energetic?”\n\nThis level of hyperkinetic energy is usually associated with a symphony, which is what Beethoven had been composing. The Trio followed on the heels of his “Pastorale” Symphony, with which it shares a bustling activity and overall good humor. The Trio’s second movement, however, is notably contrasting, and here is where things get spooky. Beethoven indicates “very slowly and expressively” but also “sotto voce” (whispering), as if a voice cries out from the beyond. Beethoven’s student, Carl Czerny, wrote that this movement reminded him of the father’s ghost in Shakespeare’s Hamlet; apparently enough listeners agreed for the nickname to stick. Beethoven requires the strings to move their bows extremely slowly and sustains the uncanny atmosphere with a tremulous piano part. The sun shines again, and good humor returns in the third movement. The opening of this movement is a little like a game of freeze tag, charging forward and immediately coming to a halt. Such games are all in good fun, even its maneuvers are increasingly elaborate, like meandering, blindfolded melodies and bouts of harmonic hide-and-seek.\n\nBeethoven dedicated his two Trios, Op. 70, to Countess Anna Maria Erdödy, with whom he was sufficiently close to call her “father confessor.” She offered him lodging during the time he composed the trios and went on to negotiate an annuity for him from his greatest (and richest) supporters so that Beethoven could have a regular income. If this Trio is largely in a good mood, perhaps it is in part because Beethoven was, too.\n\nBRUCH Octet for Strings\n\nBRUCH Octet for Strings\n\nAllegro moderato\n\nAdagio\n\nAllegro molto\n\nMin-Young Kim, violin\n\nKarla Donehew Perez, violin\n\nRebecca Fischer, violin\n\nLi-Mei Liang, violin\n\nJessica Thompson, viola\n\nDov Scheindlin, viola\n\nJulia Yang, cello\n\nNate Farrington, bass\n\nOne can either think of an octet as big, or small: a string quartet on steroids, or a miniature symphony. Felix Mendelssohn, the octet’s progenitor, managed to treat the octet as both at once, with moments of quartet-like intimacy broadening into the full sound of a string symphony. Ninety-five years later, Max Bruch found a similar balance in his Octet. This work was an expansion of an earlier string quintet, a chamber genre championed by his friend, Johannes Brahms. But because Bruch’s Octet includes the double bass, an orchestral instrument, it was long assumed this work was actually intended for string orchestra.\n\nWhether you hear it as a large chamber work or a small sym- phony, there is no question the work is entirely Romantic. Composed in 1920, at a time when the most influential composers were the modernists Schoenberg and Stravinsky, his Octet appeared to many a little like bringing oil paints to a computer-aided design conference. The Octet was Bruch’s final major composition before he died in the same year at age 82. This octogenarian Octet is such an effusion of romantic feeling, however, one would think it pours from the heart of a 20-year-old. Bruch’s most famous work remains his Violin Concerto, composed when he was 28, and his style remained essentially unchanged for the follow- ing six decades.\n\nBruch’s mastery of melody and thematic development, however, show his age and wisdom. He was unapologetic about his emphasis on melody at a time when romantic lyricism had gone out of fashion; the violin, in particular, remained the greatest instrument of his affection for this reason. The violin “can sing a melody better than a piano,” Bruch said, “and melody is the soul of music.” Like Mendelssohn’s Octet, the first violin often steps into a concerto role, or singer-in-chief.\n\nThe Octet begins with a warm blanket of sound from the lower strings, echoed by a more angelic version from the violins. Soon all the strings join forces for a rich and ardent outpouring.\n\nDespite one lyrical theme after another, Bruch sustains the music’s forward momentum and finds textural variety through bustling cross rhythms (2-against-3, like Brahms). The scope of this first movement is grand and symphonic.\n\nThe second movement begins in a somber, almost funereal mood, from which a noble melody emerges. Bruch had recently lost his wife, Clara, and was already struggling with the poor health that would soon take his own life.\n\nNevertheless, he was determined not to wallow; the Octet provided a music therapy of sorts, and the second movement charts a path from the chill of grief to a warm serenity. The final movement resumes a youthful enthusiasm, an echo of Mendelssohn’s Octet (composed at age 16). The rich, upward-reaching second theme ultimately raises the spirits into an exuberant coda.\n\nAugust 12: Mozart Under the Stars\n\nSaturday, August 12\n\n8:00 PM\n\nRobinson Pavilion at Anyela’s Vineyard\n\nRain Location: Skaneateles High School\n\nTonight’s concert is sponsored by: Peter and Elsa Soderberg\n\nWITH ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FROM The Physicians Consortium: Tom Bersani, Donald Blair, Craig Byrum, Barb Connor, Randy Green, Brendan McGinn, Steven Scheinman, and Robert Weisenthal\n\nECCO is sponsored by Armory Square Ventures, Somak Chattopadhyay & Pia Sawhney, and Jessica & Toby Millman Nick Kendall is sponsored by Kevin & Sarah Goode\n\nShai Wosner is sponsored by Jacqueline Jones, Finger Lakes Sotheby’s International Realty\n\nFeatured advertiser:\n\nThe Skaneateles Festival welcomes back the “exciting conductor-less band of strings” ECCO (New Yorker).
