Majmudar stressed the value and importance of Op-Eds in advocating for change on a public platform. Op-Eds are opinion-based articles published in newspapers and written by members of the community, and can be a powerful communication tool to uplift relevant issues and opinions. Majmudar then offers tips and advice in writing and publishing an Op-Ed. Majmudar walked the workshop through picking a topic, structuring the article, implementing tools of rhetorical persuasion and web-based writing, and revising pieces to be clear, legible, and compelling. She included examples of published Op-Eds written by and about the Women in Medicine Summit, including “Knowing Your Worth and Finding Your Community: My Experiences at WIMS” by Christina Brown and “The Invisible Work of Women in Medicine: Why the WIM Summit is Necessary” by Jessica Sejo, Toni Madorsky, Anne Osuji, and Kristal Scott.\n\nSession 2\n\nThe 2023 pre-conference was held the afternoon of September 21st. Dr. Shikha Jain, Dr. Ani Gangopadhyaya, Dr. Christine Brown, Ms. Kally Dey, and Ms. Olivia Negris began the day by welcoming all guests, volunteers, and staff to the Women In Medicine Student pre-conference, an exclusive event tailored to medical students’ needs and interests. The pre-conference consisted of 3 regular sessions, 3 breakout sessions, and a final networking event between students and faculty. The student pre-conference was a collaboration between the Women in Medicine Summit and the non-profit IGNITE MED. Dr. Jain thanks and introduces IGNITE MED for the next talk.\n\nSession 3\n\nThe third session of the afternoon was led by Drs. Julia Files and Ariela Marshall who together represent IGNITE MED, a non-profit organization dedicated to providing coaching and other resources to women medical students. Julia Files, MD, an internist and professor of Medicine at the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, is the founder and chair of the board of directors of IGNITE MED. Ariela Marshall, MD, a hematology and oncology physician at the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, is the Program Education/Curriculum Chair at IGNITE MED and Co-Chair Medical Student Preconference Subcommittee at WIMS. The IGNITE MED program is offered in collaboration with the American Medical Women’s Association to provide women medical students with the resources they need to succeed through individualized coaching sessions and longitudinal courses focused on leadership and growth.\n\nSession 4\n\nThe Keynote Address was delivered by Chelsea A. Dorsey, MD, RPVI, a vascular surgeon and Associate Professor of Surgery the Associate Dean for Medical Student Academic Advising and Advancement at University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine [Exhibit 1]. She is also the Vice Chair of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in the Department of Surgery. Dr. Dorsey began by describing the unique position of medical students to think about leadership early on, even while medical school can be a challenge by itself. She went on to describe her own leadership journey, from undergraduate years at Rice University to medical school at University of Chicago, Pritzker School of Medicine. In doing so, Dr. Dorsey showed how she sought opportunities as a medical student to observe good leaders and challenge her own leadership abilities. She reviews data showing that although women are becoming a more equal part of the physician workforce, they are far less represented in the healthcare C-suite. To hopefully overcome this, Dr. Dorsey offers strategies for empowerment and success through: finding quality mentors and sponsors for different aspects of one’s career and who appreciate the experience of women in medicine, breaking through stifling constraints of traditional leadership, being an active listener, and focusing goals on what impact one will make.\n\nSession 5\n\nImmediately following the Keynote Address, Tricia Pendergrast, MD, a resident physician at the Department of Anesthesiology at Michigan Medicine, led a session titled “Best Practices of Conference Twitter Engagement.” Dr. Pendergrast first explained the importance and impact of social media engagement throughout a conference, which is more important for women physicians who experience discrepancies in professional success on social media in comparison to male physicians. She then walked through the use of her NODES Framework (Networking, Open Engagement, Live Discussion, and Self-Promotion) to advance the platforms of women in medicine on social media.[1] The session served simultaneously as training for medical student volunteers for the 2023 WIM Summit who would go on to livetweet the ensuing conference sessions.\n\nBreakout Session 1\n\nAfter a short break, the pre-conference began breakout sessions. The first breakout session consisted of three talks: “Reproductive Life Planning” led by IGNITE MED, “Leading a Life of Purpose: Finding Meaning in Medicine” led by Rakhee Bhayani, MD, and another workshop for “Demystifying the Op-Ed: Writing Workshop for Health Advocacy” led by Shivani Majmudar.\n\nDr. Julia Files and Dr. Ariela Marshall led a session on reproductive life planning, which was created in response to the high rates of infertility experienced by women physicians in comparison with the general population [Exhibit 2]. Drs. Files and Marshall discussed what options women medical students have available to them to address the possibility of infertility in the future, such as egg cryopreservation and embryo storage. Most of all, they emphasize planning ahead considering personal desires, risk for infertility, financial constraints, and year of training.\n\nRakhee Bhayani, MD, a professor of medicine at Washington University School of Medicine, led a session finding purpose and meaning as a physician in medicine. Dr. Bhayani discussed the process of identifying one’s core values, reflecting on what brings one joy in medicine, and creating an action plan. She introduced the framework of Ikigai, emphasizing the overlap between one’s desires and one’s skills to form passion. Dr. Bhayani cited a study suggesting that spending at least 20% of one’s time on the most meaningful activity to them decreased rates of burnout, and concluded by having attendees create a short-term action plan towards achieving a more fulfilling life.\n\nThe third session offered was an additional Op-Ed writing workshop presented by Shivani Majmudar.\n\nBreakout Session 2\n\nThe next set of breakout sessions were the same as the first set of breakout sessions.\n\nBreakout Session 3\n\nThe last set of breakout sessions consisted of a session titled “Enhancing Your Interview Presence” led by Dr. Ananya Gangopadhyaya and a coaching session led by Amelia Bueche, MD.\n\nAnanya Gangopadhyaya, MD, is an internist and Associate Professor of Clinical Medicine at the University of Illinois College of Medicine, Chicago and the Co-Chair of the Medical Student Preconference Subcommittee at WIMS. She led a breakout session on interview preparation meant for third and fourth year medical students to prepare for residency interviews. The session began with general tips for interviews, followed by mock interviews for attendees to gain on-site practice and feedback.\n\nAmelia Bueche, DO, a neuromusculoskeletal & osteopathic manipulative medicine specialist and founder & program director at Coaching for Institutions, led a live coaching session as a breakout session. Through offering coaching to attendees, she introduced the process of coaching to medical students to deepen their understanding of the service and distinguish it from easily confused services such as therapy or mentorship. Dr. Bueche instead demonstrates the strengths of coaching to encourage development of personal goals and work through difficult professional barriers such as perfectionism, microaggressions, work-life balance, and negotiation.\n\nSession 6\n\nAs evening closed in, the fifth session of the preconference began titled “Speed Dating For Specialties.” Medical students were given the option of speaking to physicians from thirteen different specialties, ranging from internal medicine to radiology to emergency medicine to surgery. Most physicians were available in-person, while a few attended virtually through Zoom.\n\nSession 7\n\nThe final session of the preconference was a talk titled “How to Network,” followed by a panel discussion [Exhibit 3]. The session was led by Maylyn Martinez, MD, MSc, a health disparities researcher at University of Chicago. Dr. Martinez emphasized the profound impact networking can have in closing the gender gap in leadership positions in medicine. She walked attendees through the different types of networks one should build, how to construct an effective elevator pitch, and how to best prepare so that one will be ready when opportunities arise.\n\nWrap Up\n\nAs the preconference came to an end, Dr. Jain closed out the evening and thanked attendees for coming and directed them to the networking reception for faculty and students that immediately followed.\n\nDay 1: FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 22, 2023\n\nSession 1\n\nDr. Shikha Jain welcomed everyone to the fifth annual Women in Medicine Summit, summarizing Women in Medicine’s activities including research lab, leadership programming, organizational collaborations, and new novel publications over the past year. She encouraged us to be introspective, find balance, and step outside our comfort zone networking to maximize our experience at the 2023 Women in Medicine Summit.\n\nDr. Rana Awdish, Pulmonary and Critical Care Physician, Medical Director of Care Experience at Henry Ford Health Systems, as well as renowned author of In Shock gave the opening keynote entitled “Healing with Intention” [Exhibit 4]. Dr. Awdish reflected on the drastic transition from her career as a critical care physician to a critically ill patient. This experience revealed the sides of medicine that she did not want to see - from experiencing her care team’s dialogue regarding her clinical status and withholding of medical information. She reflected on the significant shortcomings in healthcare communication and calls to action a shift in culture to cultivate community, communication, and education - even when conversations are difficult.\n\nIn the opening Plenary, titled “Dr. Heather From the Block: Community Activism in Medicine,” Dr. Heather Irobunda, a Queens-based NYC Health and Hospitals Obstetrician / Gynecologist urged us to consider how one’s lived experience affects our patients’ lives and health [Exhibit 5]. Medicine is not simply encapsulated by disease and treatment, social determinants of health such as food deserts and racial health disparity require healthcare advocacy of physicians - at the patient AND political level. She encourages us to truly listen to community members and understand their challenges, while meeting them where they are - on Social Media (Not you, sorry #MedTwitter). Data certainly drives progress, however Dr. Irobunda reminds us that storytelling and lived experiences allow us to convey these issues to the public - and that social media provides a medium for this while encouraging diverse voices to be heard.\n\nIn the session titled “Should I Stay or Should I Go,” Dr. Monica Vela, Professor of Medicine and Director of the Hispanic Center of Excellence at the University of Illinois College of Medicine shared her experience in pivoting her own career and academic decisions, highlighting the battles women in medicine face regarding career advancement and tenureship [Exhibit 6]. She described the “GIFT” method of assessing academic and career momentum in her session, highlighting critical geographic, institutional, financial, and transformational narratives to consider as women navigate career advancement inside and outside of their current institutions. She reminds us that our relationships and careers expand beyond the walls of an institution, to protect your mental and physical health, and to seek autonomy, joy and creativity.\n\nSession 2\n\nDr. Stella Safo, an HIV primary care physician, public health advocate, Assistant Professor of Clinical Medicine at Icahn School of Medicine and Founder of Just Equity for Health, opened session 2 with her talk “Beyond the Struggle: Advocacy in Healthcare Delivery,” [Exhibit 7]. She began by discussing her advocacy journey, fueled by the toxicity and harassment she experienced throughout medical training. As a female HIV physician at an STI center, she observed first hand both the stigma and discrimination against patients of color and patients living with HIV/AIDS, but also the discrimination against women patients and women physicians. Through her own experiences with toxic workplace culture, she created multiple advocacy organizations such as Just Equity for Health and the Civic Health Alliance to support others and demand institutional policy change. She elaborated on the common themes of workplace toxicity, including hypercritical job performance, cooling of relationships, differential treatment, obscure complaints, retaliation. She reminds us that silence will not protect us in toxic environments; knowing our institutional and extra-institutional rights, diligent documentation, and creating community do.\n\nThe discussion of women physician advocacy was expanded in the “Allyship in Action: Getting Men to the Table” panel [Exhibit 8]. This panel featured Karen Caitlin, former vice president of engineering at Macromedia and Adobe and author of Better Allies; Stella Safo MD, MPH, HIV primary care physician, public health advocate and founder of Just Equity for Health; Brad Johnson PhD, Professor of Psychology at the United States Naval Academy and Faculty Associate in the Graduate School of Education at Johns Hopkins University;and David G. Smith, PhD, Associate Professor at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School. Drs. Johnson and Smith are also co-authors of Good Guys: How Men Can Be Better Allies for Women in the Workplace. Highlighting the need for advocacy and allyship from men physicians, the panel reminded us that advocacy and allyship are verbs. Dr. Smith reflected on various forms of allyship, from interpersonal and organizational to public. The panel discussed approaches to address discriminatory commentary/behavior including counterfactual evidence, simply condemn, or inquire, “I’m sorry, could you explain that to me?” The group also reflected on the minority tax, where underrepresented groups bear higher burden to speak up about discrimination, when in reality it must be a collective voice. They discussed previous advocacy mistakes - reminding us to show up, apologize and own them when they occur. Finally, the panel reflected on barriers to women’s allyship such as anxiety and implicit bias, which can be mitigated through advocacy education and concrete action items.\n\nFriday’s Lunch sessions included a general lunch session, abstract lunch session, and the State of Women’s Health Lunch with Allison Yarrow, an award-winning gender equality journalist, speaker, and author; Leslie Shrock author and angel investor working at the convergence of fertility / maternal health and technology; Dr. Neel Shah, Chief Medical Officer of Maven Clinic and founder of Costs of Care and March for Moms, and Dr. Amanda Adeleye, reproductive endocrinologist at University of Chicago, moderated by Dr. Eve Bloomgarden, endocrinologist at NorthShore University Health and Chief Operating Officer of IMPACT.\n\nFriday Session 3: Breakout 1\n\nFriday afternoon the conference transitioned into its first round of seven breakout sessions. Dr. Rakhee Bhayani, Professor of Medicine and Vice Chair for the Advancement of Women’s Careers Washington University School of Medicine, and Dr. Carol Faulk, Assistant Professor of Medicine at Washington University in St Louis School of Medicine’s breakout session entitled “Belonging - Feeling Seen, Heart, and Valued” centered around the true meaning behind belonging, its benefits and insights on how to cultivate a culture of belonging. They reflected on the intersectionality and life experience each of us brings and the importance of balance within all arms of diversity, equity and inclusion. The key to belonging, and the stark contrast between this and ‘fitting in”, is creating a safe environment to thrive - be curious, transparent, and safe. Feeling connected and a sense of belonging is a basic human right and key to the evolution of workplace culture, especially within the medical community. By finding our own love language in the workplace and connecting with colleagues and peers, we can feel better connected to one another and find greater support, meaning and camaraderie in our work.\n\nDr. Shola Ezekoli, an internal medicine physician, professional coach and founder/CEO of Balance with Dr. Shola LLC and Physician Heal Yourself brand opened her breakout session “Saying NO: Why we don’t, why we should, and how we can” by describing the “art” of saying no and how doing so can open the door to our dream life. She discussed why we hesitate to say no - from childhood trauma and courtesy to fear of perception from peers and retaliation in future opportunities. She reminded us that we cannot be, do, or please everyone and everything. She encouraged us to go inward to realize our worth and identify what fuels you - and say yes to that. It protects your time and your energy while boosting your confidence and self trust. Go from Fear of Missing Out “FOMO” to Joy of Missing Out “JOMO”!\n\nDr Avital O’Glasser, Hospitalist and Associate Professor of Medicine within the Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine at Oregon Health & Science University and Karen Catlin, former vice president of engineering at Macromedia and Adobe and author of Better Allies, “Belonging in Healthcare” and the “5 Ally Actions” newsletter hosted an engaging conversation during “Being Better Allies for Women in Healthcare: A Fireside Chat.” Karen Catlin reflected on her motivations to write “Belonging in Healthcare,” including her experience as a minority woman in tech and an encounter with a woman physician who was moved by her book, which motivated her to write a healthcare-specific narrative. Whether navigating patient incivility or gender bias in the workplace, Catlin suggests a balance between finding your voice and boundaries while also prioritizing patient care. To close, our speakers emphasized becoming aware of your own privileges in order to understand the experiences of others and be an effective ally. Embrace the idea of “curious, not furious.”\n\nDr. Adaira Landry opened her breakout “How to Publish: Perspective and Opinion Pieces” by imparting the wisdom that “the best writers are the best readers.” Barriers to writing and ultimately publishing include limited mentorship and a competitive scholarly market. Her stepwise writing approach begins with finding a focus. Second, reflect on current skills, obstacles and experiences. Then, ensure work is timely, creative, and (potentially) controversial but ensures the reader learns or experiences something new by reading your work. Next, begin brainstorming a topic of interest and audience while considering a key message and the logistics of formatting, publishing, and cost. Find editors through professional and social networks and social media. Begin writing with your audience in mind, and pursue edits that improve flow, clarity, and intended tone. Find field testers to provide honest feedback before submitting and later amplifying your new work. She encouraged us to write about our passions, adding a spin that encourages others to want to read, too.\n\nDr. Lipi Roy, Addiction Medicine physician and Clinical Assistant Professor at NYU Langone Health, international speaker, media personality and host of the Health, Humor and Harmony YouTube series opened her breakout session “Storytelling for Health Advocacy using TV & Digital media platforms” with two key lessons she learned on day one of medical school: Always listen to your patients and your patients will be your best teacher - the first step to storytelling is storyListening [Exhibit 9]. Stories change the way we think and form connections and trust, while simultaneously providing medical insight. She emphasized the importance of disseminating physician and women’s voices in health messaging today. We are a highly trusted profession whose expertise can establish credibility and trust, communicate knowledge and clarify factual evidence. When we elevate women’s voices, we fuel progress through their understanding of systemic challenges and potential avenues to advocate not only for themselves, but for their families and communities. As both women and physicians, we must leverage our experiences, expertise, and voice to disseminate evidence-based information in an impactful, reliable way - storytelling provides an opportunity to leave a meaningful impact.\n\nDr. Kierstin Cates Kennedy, who serves in multiple roles at the University of Alabama at Birmingham including Internal Medicine / Pediatrics academic hospitalist, Associate Professor of Medicine and Chief Medical Officer, provided us with insight on current C-suite dynamics with her breakout entitled “Leading in the C-Suite: Why we Need YOU” [Exhibit 10]. Only 1 in 4 C-suite executives are women and 1 in 10 is a woman of color; as a result of gender socialization and the current culture within medical leadership, women physicians are leaving medicine at higher rates compared to man physicians. Women are well-suited to drive change in the C-suite through daily actions, however we must grant them the opportunity to drive change. She highlighted a model of Wellness Centered Leadership, in which we change the C-suite culture by cultivating individual and team relationships, prioritize and normalize personal wellness, and encourage improvement without perfection. The key to this culture change is not asking women to do more, it’s to become intentional and create space for the next women in leadership.\n\nDr. Diane W. Shannon, former practicing internal medicine physician now writer, author and Founder / Physician Coach at Shannon Coaching for Life, spoke to us about “Gaslighting or Imposter Syndrome? How to tell, What to do: A Workshop for Women in Healthcare” during her breakout session, reflecting on her own experiences with self doubt and its two main drivers, imposter syndrome (internally) and gaslighting (externally). She provided actionable solutions, ranging from the importance of allyship to preparing a response script and prioritizing activities that cultivate empowerment. She recommends we keep a journal, seek validation and support from our trusted peers, mentors and allies, and hold others accountable. She walked us through an exercise to assist us in breaking through perceived barriers to our individual success and reflect on the actions, thoughts, and mantras required to accomplish them. Remember, “your culture is defined by the worst behavior you tolerate” - whether self doubt is internally or externally generated, we must remember that thoughts are not always truth, and focus on replacing the negative ones with positive.\n\nFriday Session 4: Breakout 2\n\nOur second Friday breakout consisted of eight sessions, including “Building, Evolving and Sustaining a Vital Career in Medicine,” hosted by Dr. Barrett Fromme, pediatrician and professor at University of Chicago. By evaluating the current career stage, we are able to identify sources of vitality and sources of burnout - mid-career physicians are at the highest risk for burnout. Dr. Fromme shared the drivers of engagement (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27871627/), around which we can cultivate our work values and meaning, work relationships and community, our organizational fit and values within our institutions, and how to integrate work and life. Dr. Fromme reminds us that our pursuit and definition of vitality and fulfillment will change throughout the career stages and depending on personal goals, but to continue evaluating throughout every milestone to ensure your goals remain in alignment with your values and cultivate vitality.\n\nDr. George Naum, family medicine physician for 30 years, marriage and relationship coach and author, and Vanessa Naum, MBA, sex and relationship coach, both co-founders of Best Friends Again, LLC hosted their breakout session entitled “Best Friends Again: Rediscovering and Growing your Personal Relationships” to highlight the importance of effective communication to foster meaningful connection, especially in a career in medicine. They shared the lessons drawn from personal experiences within their marriage which inspired their motivation to assist physicians and other healthcare professionals to rediscover growing personal relationships, reignite their marriages and love for one another. They stressed that while ineffective communication leads to escalations and feelings of resentment, effective communication and healthy relationships have a positive impact on our wellbeing and even survival. Dr. and Mrs. Naum shared The Love Huddle, an approach to connection when struggling to come to an agreement: Both partners take 20 minutes to write out feelings, in detail. Exchange letters and read them twice - once with head and once with heart. Come together to discuss. To improve communication, we must express our feelings, take ownership of actions and apologize for wrong doings. To foster connection, we must listen, be present, and show appreciation. Our relationships are central to our happiness and investing in them is critical to our wellbeing, especially in a career like medicine.\n\nAmanda Hill, a lawyer of 22 years who has dedicated her practice to advocate for doctors, led their breakout session entitled “Contract Negotiation” with the goal of providing resources to physicians early on so they do not end up in crisis situations. Her company, Guard My Practice, offers courses on contracts, difficult people, staying out of trouble, and getting to know yourself. Hill’s messaging emphasized that knowledge is power and shares negotiation tricks. Some tactics shared include knowing your battles and priorities, always being honest, realizing everything is negotiable if you have leverage, not being afraid to walk away, and knowing your value and worth. She also highlights “the only emotion I use in negotiation is positivity and engagement.” The session continued as she discussed how to bring up issues of compliance effectively. Ms. Hill ends on a hopeful note and encourages “don’t give up - you are in a noble profession, even if it seems hard to negotiate.”\n\nFriday Session 5: Breakout 3\n\nDr. Mark Shapiro, practicing hospitalist & creator, producer & host of Explore The Space Podcast, continued the earlier conversation of man physician allyship in his breakout session “Allyship in Action: A Primer with Dr. Mark Shapiro,” [Exhibit 11]. He encouraged us to provide actionable feedback, provide affirmation and validation, and create a safe space for creative ideas. He reflects on the buzzword nature of the word “allyship,” and reminds us to identify the meaning of allyship where we are. Our central dogma of “A person struggling for inequity vs changing it” has not been solved. Allyship should be standardized at the university level and societally accepted as normal behavior, not simply an anecdote of potential energy yet to be unlocked.\n\nThe excitement of the day continued with our third Friday breakout sessions, including “Grassroots Efforts to Advocate for Change” by Dr. Halleh Akbarnia, MD, FACEP. Dr. Akbarnia is an emergency medicine physician who is dedicated to improving public health. More recently, she has been involved with Illinois Medical Professionals Action Collaborative Team (IMPACT) and vaccination efforts in Chicago. Together, they have been putting out information to healthcare providers and the public about COVID, giving lectures, community talks, and holding clinics. Dr Akbarnia has also spoken on gun violence from a personal perspective; on treating gun violence patients as a physician; and on being a leader in Moms Demand. She highlights that advocacy is action by a physician to promote those social, economic, education, and political changes that ameliorate the suffering and threats to human health and well-being that he or she identifies through his or her professional work and expertise. Dr. Akbarnia continues by outlining the ways advocacy can be built into one’s daily practice including asking patients about social needs, identifying local resources, acting to connect patients, conducting research in health equity, writing op-ed/opinion pieces to raise awareness about social medicine, and being a voice for the oppressed. Furthermore, she challenges them to consider their goals in advocacy: is it universal healthcare, gun regulation, racial justice, or public health funding? She leaves the audience members with this: action speaks louder than words - there are many ways to get involved in advocacy, it is never to late to make a change, and your voice is powerful.\n\nThe breakout sessions continued with Stacy Wood, AAC, founder of Through the Woods Consulting and lead faculty member for the WIMS Leadership Primer, in her session “Stop Setting Goals, Start Planning to Own your Journey.” She speaks on the notion that traditional goal setting is “old fashioned” and just touches the tip of the iceberg. She argues that journey mapping is more effective as it allows you to unpack your vision, organize your thoughts, prioritize your focus, and strategies. For journey mapping, Wood recommends a big board, sticky notes, and time. She further explains how to create a vision board with metrics which allows users to look at goals, remember them, and be inspired by them as they see the board every single day. She also highlights the need for the board to include metrics, clear action plans with frequencies, amounts, tactics, etc. to round out her session, she encourages the practive of revisiting journey mapping and vision boarding multiple times throughout a year, either quarterly or when big life events have occurred.\n\nThe final session of Friday’s breakout time was titled “Becoming the Architect of your Future” with Dr. Laura Desveaux PhD, PT, ACC, the executive director of Women Who Lead. She shared tactics to unlock a growth mindset including the notion that intelligence and talent can be improved. She challenges the audience to focus is on developing yourself to be better, building skills, seeking out what stretches you, finding others who challenge you, and analyzing yourself frequently. Her outline to create a growth mindset includes 1) identify what drives you, 2) visualize your success, 3) harness appreciative inquiry, 4) lock it in, write it down, and tell someone about it. Dr. Desveaux concludes with messaging on trusting the next chaper and recognizing “it’s not a NO, it’s a NOT YET.”\n\nFriday Session 6\n\nThe first day of the 2023 Women in Medicine Summit concluded with Dr. Tiffany Moon, MD in her closing keynote address titled “Social Media Use in Medicine: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly,” [Exhibit 12]. She opens by discussing the uses of social media from the consumer standpoint: to catch up with friends and family, be entertained, relieve stress, consume content for learning purposes, develop a hobby, create connection versus that of the creator: to create, to inspire, to educate, to entertain, to help, to network, and socialize. As a physician, Dr. Moon shares that social media can be used for clinical and non-clinical purposes. Clinical social media use includes building a professional reputation, direct-to-patient marketing, and networking. Non-clinical social media use includes consulting, speaking, coaching, brand partnerships, and book publishing deals. Next, she highlights some social media best practices such as: never disclose confidential patient information, never reveal your private information, never give medical advice, be familiar with your institution’s social media policy, never post about your actual patients, don’t post anything you wouldn’t want X to see. When getting started on social media, Dr. Moon suggests considering the following: What is your goal? Who is your audience? Where do they “live” online? What are your skills / assets? (teaching, humor, video creation) What do you enjoy? If you don’t enjoy it, you won’t keep it up. What time / schedule can you commit to? Consistency is key. Do you need help? She also discusses the downsides of social media use including its link to depression, anxiety, loneliness and stress as well as cyberbullying. Dr. Moon’s take on so-called HATERS is that they are individuals Having Anger Towards Everyone Reaching Success (HATERS) and challenges the audience by saying, “if you wouldn’t let them into your house, don’t let them into your head.”\n\nDay 2: SEPTEMBER 23, 2023\n\nSaturday Session 7\n\nDay two of the 2023 Women in Medicine Summit started off with a keynote address from Megan Ranney, MD, MPH, FACEP in her discussion of “New Power: How Can We Join Together to Create Change?” [Exhibit 13]. She defines the concept of new power as being made up of new models of power and new values systems for power. The goal of new power is not to hoard it but to channel it. Multiple people and parties may co-own, produce, fund, shape, and participate in new power models. These models also foster increased participation, inclusion, short-term affiliation, transparency, opt-in decision making, network, and informal governance. Dr. Ranney clarifies that not all old power models are inherently bad; it’s a continuum. She them shares multiple case examples of new power in action including AFFIRM Research and #ThisIsOurLane, #GetUsPPE, and Physician Women for Democratic Principles. All three cases she discussed shared commonalities of perceiving a need, creating a community, securing group funding, being dynamic and pivoting when a target need is met, and working with old power. She highlights that “we cannot make lasting changes without using the systems that are already in place.” Dr. Ranney captivates the audience as she closes with a call to action. Her challenge to listeners is this: Create or join a community that’s related to a need you identify. Identify your key drivers and skills. Lift others up. Create funding. Don’t give up.\n\nAfter this incredible keynote, the plenary session began. Laurie Baedke, MHA, FACHE, FACMPE, Director of Healthcare Leadership Programs at Creighton University shared her expertise in her session “Super Connected: Strategies for Networking like a Pro,” [Exhibit 14]. She emphasized that if you want to be extraordinary, you need to identify from afar the extraordinary people you want to be like, and study them. Get to know yourself to know what your brand is and what you stand for. Baedke then highlighted that women and particularly women of color face additional barriers in networking and advancing in our organizations/institutions. Moreover, women are over-mentored and under-sponsored. She then shared the complexity of introverts. “Introverts can face additional headwinds being viewed as leaders and networking, including a strong cultural bias viewing introversion as a barrier to leadership.” However, she then outlined that research confirms unique and practical value that introverts bring to leadership role. Beadle concluded with sharing four networking power practices as a challenge to the WIMS attendees: 1) plan ahead, 2) quality over quantity, 3) follow up, 4) branch out. She stated, “Self-awareness is a crucial leadership competency. Challenge yourself to know your natural relationship building style, including its strengths and limitations. And finally, practice and apply the behaviors that amplify your authority and advance your personal and professional brand.”\n\nThe morning continued with a question-and-answer-style “Gender Equity Town Hall” session with Dr. Shikha Jain [Exhibit 15]. Dr. Jain opened up the floor for questions to be directed at the other speakers, or topics of discussion that the attendees wanted to discuss more in depth. Several questions were directed at speakers in the audience, and faculty provided advice on how to create opportunities for sponsoring others. Dr. Ranney states “When there’s an opportunity that you could do yourself, instead put others’ names forward. Constantly try to be conscious of it, intentionality is key.” When asked about how to navigate approaching senior colleagues for help regarding workplace bullying, sexism, or racism, Ms. Baedke shares “you need to seek out multiple individuals to seek out a coalition. It’s good to have sound counsel from other experienced allies that maybe we’re perceiving something differently, but more often than not we need support from multiple allies and a coalition; It’s easy to ignore a single person; it’s more challenging to ignore a collective.” A comment was made by the audience acknowledging the intentionality the Summit places on having faculty speakers of diverse backgrounds, and the importance of ensuring that type of intentionality becomes the norm across the healthcare diaspora to drive real change. This morning’s session concluded with a question directed towards Dr. Jain, asking how she envisions the system changing. She responded with “it starts here, not just at this summit - but at other places like this. Have faith in the next generation, including men in the conversation to champion women, and changing language that we use to talk about these important issues. The narratives need to change: Old Power to New Power. Push back on old power models and help them realize that if they change their narrative to match yours it will help THEIR bottom line, be it finances, improved patient outcomes, institutional accolades.”\n\nSaturday Session 8\n\nAfter a short break, day two continued with Dr. Kimberly Manning, MD and Dr. Ashley McMullen, MD, co-hosts of the podcast “The Human Doctor” who share the power of intentional connection through their lens as fellow Black American Women [Exhibit 16]. They start their session with a quote from Toni Morrison’s Beloved “She is a friend of my mind. She gathers me, man. The pieces I am, she gathers them and gives them back to me in all the right order.” They share the story of how they met and introduce this with the word “kismet” which is defined as a hypothetical force or personified power that determines the course of future events, it’s really about fate and destiny. Their powerful journey of friendship continued and they shared that there was a point in that where there was a realization that they wanted this relationship to be more and they created intentional partnership. Despite power/qualification differences there is a flattening of that dynamic in their relationship by seeing each other in spaces where it isn’t easy to be seen. The duo shares that they are hoping to create spaces that allow people to bring their entire self so we can use all our cognitive energy to do good work, to do power instead of trying to be someone else. Their friendship and mentorship is a perfectly lived example of lifting as you climb, no matter where you are. Dr. Manning and Dr. McMullen round out the session emphasizing that everything is about relationships and you will not survive this work without those relationships. Moreover, they state it is not about just dropping in, you need to put in the work over time.\n\nUp next, there was “A Fireside Chat ‘’ with Dr. Vinet Arora MD, MAPP and Dr. Arghavan Salles, MD, PhD [Exhibit 17]. Dr. Arora is the Dean for Medical Education and hospitalist at the University of Chicago and Dr. Salles is a researcher with a focus on gender equity, implicit bias, diversity, inclusion, and physician well-being. They focus this chat on transitions in their careers and how these were navigated. Dr. Arora highlights stepping into her role as a dean and how she had to start thinking critically about what her school needs, as well as start building her understanding of finance. She further states “you don’t run away from the math problems - you learn them.” Dr. Salles shares how she is fellowship trained as a bariatric surgeon but now spends zero time in clinical work, and is solely devoted to her research. She shares how she has landed among people who have similar values an believe in the work she is doing, and has no regrets in this transition. Dr. Salles reflects on Dr. Arora’s experiences and responds “you take on a lot of responsibility for things, as a lot of us do, and we don’t always realize the heaviness of the things we take on.” The two physicians also discuss the complexities of building families in medicine. Dr. Salles has been publicly open about her experiences with fertility treatments, including a Time magazine article on her egg freezing. Dr. Arora comments that it took her 10 years to have two children, something she used to not share at all, though now she does. Dr. Salles comments “when you don’t share about this… you feel like you’re damaged, you’re the probem, and you feel shame.” They both reflected on the fact that 1 out of 4 female physicians will face fertility challenges and ended calling on the WIMS audience to share our struggles to make others feel less alone as there is great strength in vulnerability.\n\nSaturday Session 9: Breakout 4\n\nIn his breakout session entitled “My AAR: What I’ve learned in my 2nd profession,” Lieutenant General Mark Hertling, who finished his 38-year Army career as the Commanding General of US Army, Europe in 2012, shed a light on the similarities between the healthcare profession and the military. Both the military and healthcare hold the desire for leadership, the need to address challenges, and the importance of mentorship. They require individuals to adhere to shared ethics and values, execute unique societal functions, and maintain a commitment to continuous improvement. Leadership is essential in both fields, and female leaders can bring unique advantages. Female leaders bring unique advantages, including empathy and communication skills, which is the front lining cause of #WomenInMedicineSummit. Mentorship is crucial for professional growth and development. However, unlike the military, healthcare professionals often neglect their own physical and mental well-being.\n\nIn her breakout session entitled “Should you quit your job?” Dr. Jessi Gold, a psychiatrist, freelance writer, and fellow #WIM, explored how the COVID-19 pandemic shifted the narrative of job satisfaction, burn-out, and how that has impacted those contemplating quitting their job particularly in the context of healthcare workers. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s resignation is a classic example of a well-handled departure. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many physicians took on increased responsibilities without considering the personal toll. The cost of these responsibilities is a common concern in the field of medicine. As she discussed in her article in The New York Times on burnout, “Anything you can do to regain an element of control can be really helpful,” in mitigating signs and symptoms of burn out.\n\nDr. Gold emphasized the point that leaving a job can be seen as a privilege, as many healthcare workers define their identity by their profession, making it difficult to leave. This suggests steps to consider if one is contemplating quitting, including assessing emotional well-being, identifying specific feelings, and determining if burnout is a factor. The definition of burnout is given as emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a sense of reduced personal accomplishment, often due to a mismatch between work expectations and experience. Rates of burnout near or exceeding 50% have been documented among trainees and practicing physicians.\n\nIt is important to have systems in place, such as self-inventory, practicing gratitude by noting three good things daily, and aligning one’s workplace with personal values, to alleviate the feelings of burnout. It is easy for individuals to overlook their own burnout symptoms; checking in on others and focusing on what one can control can. In summary, there are several factors related to quitting a job, especially in the healthcare field, and the importance of recognizing and addressing burnout. Having various steps and strategies to deal with burnout and highlights the challenges in identifying burnout within oneself.\n\nDr. Disha Spath, Internal Medicine physician and the founder and CEO of The Frugal Physician and personal finance columnist of Practice Link magazine, broke down finances as it relates to #WIMS into eight key steps in her breakout session entitled “Financial Baby Steps for Women Physicians”:\n\nProtect + Insurance: This step involves having a will and estate plan, obtaining disability insurance (preferably “own occupation” disability insurance), and securing life insurance to protect your family and financial affairs.\n\nStarter Emergency Fund: Build an emergency fund of $10,000 or an amount equivalent to the highest deductible you might face. Starting with a bonus can help set this up.\n\nGameplan for Student Loans: Create a strategy for managing student loans, considering options such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), income-driven repayment plans, and consolidation.\n\nSlash Bad Debt: Eliminate high-interest debt, especially debt with interest rates exceeding 10%, like credit card debt. Evaluate different debt reduction approaches such as the debt snowball and debt avalanche.\n\nInvesting: Begin investing early to achieve financial independence. Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts and consider different investment types like stocks, bonds, mutual funds, index funds, and ETFs.\n\nPay Off Debt Except Mortgage: Prioritize paying off all non-mortgage debt. This step suggests living frugally, especially in the early years of your career.\n\nBuild a 3-6 Month Emergency Fund: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund, typically stored in high-interest savings accounts or other safe options.\n\nLive and Give Like No One Else: Focus on your long-term financial goals, such as retirement savings, before saving for other expenses, like your children’s education. Also, consider charitable giving.\n\nThe key takeaway is not to mix insurance and investing, highlighting the importance of maintaining clear financial priorities within these steps to ensure adequate financial competence while navigating the ever changing field of medicine.\n\nDr. DJ Himstedt, a highly experienced professional with training in organization development and psychology and faculty leave of the WIM Leadership Accelerator program hosted a breakout session entitled “Accelerating Your Path to Leadership” where she reflected on the elements of a quality leadership. Dr. Himstedt’s work in leadership extends beyond her role in medicine, works to help physicians and medical leaders comprehend their roles and helps them to achieve their interpersonal and professional roles. She emphasized the importance of understanding that managers are focused on doing things right, while leaders are concerned with figuring out the right thing to do. Effective leaders often need to operate from both the “balcony,” providing vision and guidance, and the “dance floor,” actively participating in tasks. Leadership involves sharing a vision, coaching, resourcing, designing roles, and supporting team dynamics, while management includes task completion, quality management, aligning team members, prioritizing tasks, and aligning people with goals.\n\nTo be a good leader, one must develop skills in both leadership and management. Dr. Himstedt highlights critical management routines such as project management, one on one meetings to build trust, and effective listening. By introducing the Individual Development Plan, which includes a future state, current developmental goal, action plan, gaps/barriers, and results/insights Dr. Himstedt discussed how WIM can enhance the opportunity to become effective leaders by encouraging the need to embrace and balance both leadership and management behaviors to succeed.\n\nSara Serritella is an award-winning journalist turned Director of Communications at the Institute for Translational Medicine that’s powered by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). She is a lecturer at The University of Chicago and UChicago’s Pritzker School of Medicine, where she co-built and teaches the first for-credit science communication courses for medical students, graduate students in UChicago’s new master’s in biomedical sciences program, and undergraduates. In her talk entitled “Rx for Realness: How to connect with the public and beyond using science communication strategies,” Sara discusses how connecting with the public can be integrated with our training as #WIM through science [Exhibit 18]. Some key points she discusses are as follows:\n\nStories have the power to change lives, as the brains of storytellers and listeners sync during storytelling.\n\nTo effectively communicate with the public, it’s essential to cut through the noise of jargon and statistics by telling authentic stories.\n\nYour audience needs to hear your authentic story, as your message won’t resonate with everyone.\n\nSteps for connecting with the public include starting with a concise “why,” eliciting emotion, sharing conflict, providing unexpected social currency, and offering practical value.\n\nUsing simple language is crucial to promoting health equity and health literacy while restoring trust.\n\nBe aware of your body language when speaking to the public to ensure you come across as relatable and engaging.\n\nThe key takeaway is that replacing facts with simple, authentic, and concrete stories can have a significant impact on audiences and promote positive change in the fields of science and medicine.\n\nDr. Angela Christine Weyand, a University of Michigan Pediatric Hematologist/Oncologist (also known as @Shematologist) hosted her breakout session “Using Social Media for Good” where she highlighted the many benefits of utilizing social media in our digital world. Social media is a powerful tool that, when harnessed for good, can have a profound and far-reaching impact. We can see this impact within the #WIMS community itself, with a growing global community of 10.7k followers on Twitter alone. By using social media as a force for good, individuals, and communities, like ours, can leverage our collective strength to address critical issues in the healthcare industry, while empowering women in medicine alike.\n\nUsing Twitter to reach out to organizations like UptoDate, using it for education and fundraising, mobilizing resources for causes such as healthcare workers versus hunger, and networking through outlets like @WIMSummit. Twitter can be a powerful tool for communication and engagement. Chiefly, finding a cause you are passionate about, considering the stakeholders involved, choosing the right platform, and assessing your time commitment can amplify your voice and the voice of the cause you are hoping to engage with. Social media highlights that people are often more receptive to your efforts than you might initially believe, making Twitter and other social media platforms, a valuable medium for good when used optimally.\n\nVidya Sri, former Human Rights Policy Fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School and co-founder of Umed.Me, Teqbahn, and Everywoman Treaty, shared her advocacy work in her breakout session “Global Speak Up Coalition: Advocacy & Inclusion in Healthcare from the Local to the Global.” The Global Speak Up Coalition is a group of public healthcare experts advocating against harassment, bullying, and discrimination in the medical field. They address issues related to fear of retaliation, physician health and wellness, and physician equity. They have developed the Speak Up App, which utilizes AI-powered reporting for anonymous documentation of specific incidents with end-to-end encryption.\n\nThe coalition’s purpose is to transform communication, improve physician well-being, prevent burnout, and offer mentorship. The coalition focuses include gender-based harassment, non-sexual harassment, micro-aggressions, and difficulties in defining and addressing these problems in real time. They emphasize the experiences of trans women, women of color, and individuals facing power dynamics in the healthcare system. They provide resources, including definitions, information dissemination strategies, connections to people with similar experiences, narratives of personal experiences, and collaborations with existing organizations. They emphasize the importance of documenting incidents in real-time and offering long-term support to those who report. They also recommend visiting websites like umed.me, umed.tech, and globalspeakupcoalition.org to learn more and engage with their mission.\n\nDr. Hansa Bhargava, pediatrician, author, speaker, Chief Medical Officer for Medscape Education and Certified Instructor of the Emory University CBCT Resiliency Program addressed the issue of physician burnout in her breakout session entitled “The Doctor’s Dilemma of Overcoming Burnout: What Are Some Evidence Based Solutions?” She stressed the connection between mental and physical health, highlighting how burnout can lead to emotional and physical problems, diminishing one’s ability to cope with stress. The 2023 Medscape Physician Burnout & Depression Report revealed an alarming increase in burnout rates and depression among physicians. Research-based techniques to reduce burnout and enhance resilience were discussed, including mindfulness programs like CBCT and the Community Resiliency Model. Dr. Bhargava also emphasized the importance of clear and calm thinking, which can benefit professionals and personal life, providing a toolkit for physicians to navigate challenging circumstances effectively.\n\nSaturday Session 10: Breakout 5\n\nDr. Shirlene Obuobi, a Ghanaian-American physician, current Cardiology Fellow at University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine, cartoonist, and author, highlighted physicians as storytellers in her session “Narrative Medicine: Write a Book.” She provided guidance for those interested in becoming authors and explained the three main publishing options: self-publishing, traditional publishing, and hybrid publishing, discussing their respective pros and cons.\n\nDifferent genres and types of books require distinct approaches, and having a literary agent is often necessary for traditional publishing. Dr. Obuobi provided valuable resources for querying agents, researching imprints, and connecting with the writing community. She discussed the process of traditional publishing, including manuscript submission and the importance of selecting a communicative and supportive agent. Writing a non-fiction book typically requires a proposal to attract an agent’s attention, and Dr. Obuobi offered insights into the time and dedication required for the writing and editing process.\n\nIn her session “Leveraging your Clinical expertise into a Leadership Position,” Dr. Anita Chandrasena, pulmonary and critical care physician and Chief Physician Executive (CPE) for the Northern California Division of CommonSpirit Health, underscored that physicians possess qualities that make them excellent leaders, such as their scientific background and problem-solving skills. She shared her personal journey, moving from academic medicine to informatics, highlighting the diverse career paths open to medical professionals in practice, public health, research, education, advocacy, and business. Emphasizing the critical role of physicians in driving large-scale healthcare changes, she positioned them as a bridge between medical knowledge and administrative decisions, always keeping the patient at the forefront.\n\nDr. Chandrasena offered valuable advice for those aspiring to transition into leadership roles, including staying open-minded, embracing curiosity, learning from mistakes, prioritizing feedback, nurturing creativity, and venturing out of one’s comfort zone. She encouraged starting small, seeking formal training, finding mentors, working on emotional intelligence, and staying humble. She suggests maintaining flexibility by exploring new opportunities while still keeping ties to the current path. The key takeaway is to allow your career to unfold naturally, remain open-minded, and be prepared to acquire new skills that may lead to unexpected opportunities, embracing adaptability and intentional learning for future success.\n\nIn her session “Roe vs Wade: My role as a physician in protecting health,” Dr. Serena Chen, Reproductive Endocrinology & Infertility / OBGYN specialist at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, discusses her advocacy and commitment to protecting reproductive healthcare, especially in the aftermath of the Roe vs. Wade decision [Exhibit 19]. She serves in many roles, including Founding Partner at the Institute for Reproductive Medicine and Science, Division Director at Cooperman Barnabas Medical Center, Chief Advocacy Officer at CCRM NJ, and Clinical Associate Professor at Rutgers NJ Medical School and Rutgers RWJ Medical Schools. She emphasized the importance of medical autonomy, asserting that every person should have the right to make informed decisions about their own reproductive health and body. Dr. Chen addressed the impact of the recent legal case, Dobbs, on in-vitro fertilization and the medical field, highlighting key points related to abortion definitions and laws. She encouraged optimism, activism, and connecting with organizations supporting reproductive health and fertility. Dr. Chen stressed the significance of language use and the need to trust and respect the patient-physician relationship to preserve medical autonomy and the right to choose, upholding the principles of trust, respect, and individual decision-making central to modern medicine.\n\nSession 11: Closing Keynote\n\nThough the conclusion of #WIMS2023 was bittersweet, Dr. Genein Letford, MEd, Creative Chief Officer of CAFFE Strategies, LLC, left us with an important note on prismatic leaders and their importance within the medical field with her “Closing Keynote Address: Prismatic Leadership,” [Exhibit 20]. She described prismatic leaders as individuals who can extract hidden skills, talents, and gifts from the people around them. They are also characterized by several key qualities, including a growth mindset, empathy, an open-minded approach to bias, cultural awareness, and the ability to shift perspectives and adapt authentically.\n\nPrismatic leaders are essential to empower everyone within an organization and that they can bring out a diverse range of abilities in their team members. It encourages the idea of “lifting as we rise” and stresses the importance of fostering a sense of community and support.\n\nThe closing remarks encouraged introspection, networking, and balancing personal and professional goals. This aligns with the purpose of the Women in Medicine Summit which gives women in medicine spaces in leadership roles and calls for positive disruption in healthcare systems to achieve gender equality quickly.\n\nPrismatic Leaders and #WIMS helps encourage empowerment, networking, and the importance of women in leadership positions to drive positive change in healthcare and other sectors that can help advance the careers of women in the medical profession.\n\nClosing Remarks\n\nAll in all, this year’s #WIMS2023 closed by encouraging engagement in the year to come via various social media platforms. Being a woman in medicine encompasses many aspects, this year we ended our summit with the following key points:\n\n- Be introspective: Think critically and identify ways to use skills you’ve learned to improve yourself and change your system\n\n- Network: Reach out to people you met at WIMS\n\n- Balance: Don’t let imposter phenomenon stop you nor let another person’s success make you feel less accomplished - remember to find time for yourself\n\n- Women are the global majority.

DeBakey Department of Surgery, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, 3Department of Surgery, Division of Pediatric Surgery, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, 4Department of Surgery, Division of Pediatric Surgery, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, Kentucky, 5Department of Surgery, Division of Pediatric Surgery, University of California, Davis, Sacramento, California, 6Department of Surgery, Division of Pediatric Surgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA\n\nIn the annals of history, there are remarkable individuals who defy societal expectations and overcome immense obstacles to achieve greatness. Dr. Benjy Frances Brooks is one such inspirational woman. Born in North Texas in 1918, she embarked on a path that would lead her to become a pioneering pediatric surgeon, shattering gender barriers and leaving an indelible mark on the history of surgery.[1] Dr. Brooks’s journey exemplifies the power of perseverance and serves as an inspiration for all who dare to challenge the status quo.\n\nDefying Expectations\n\nFrom a tender age, Dr. Brooks harbored a strong desire to become a surgeon. Even as a child, she demonstrated her skills by operating on her sister’s dolls beneath the kitchen table. However, the educational system of her time failed to recognize her potential, and in fifth grade, she was labelled as mentally disabled by her teacher. Undeterred, Dr. Brooks refused to be confined by such judgments. She firmly believed that she was destined for something greater, proclaiming later, “I didn’t fit into that sausage mill to come out a little sausage like everybody else.”[2]\n\nAchievements\n\nDespite these early obstacles, Dr. Brooks blazed her own trail. She pursued her medical degree at The University of Texas Medical Branch.[3] She then trained in surgery at the University of Pennsylvania. In the 1950s, her fellowship at Boston Children’s Hospital of Harvard Medical School set her apart as the first woman to train in surgery at Harvard.[4, 5]\n\nIt was during this time that she encountered another significant obstacle - she was hired, unseen, to train under Dr. Robert Gross.[5] Astonished by her gender-defying name, Dr. Gross initially believed the name Benjy belonged to a man. However, once she arrived, he recognized her talent and allowed her to stay and learn pediatric surgery. Dr. Brooks not only proved herself worthy but also became a leading force in her field. In 1975, when the first qualifying examination in pediatric surgery was offered, she was among the first women to earn certification for special qualifications in pediatric surgery.[6]\n\nRedefining Possibilities\n\nFollowing her training, Dr. Brooks became the first female pediatric surgeon in Texas. Joining the faculty at Texas Children’s Hospital (1958) and Baylor College of Medicine, she rose to become the founding chief of pediatric surgery at the University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston in 1973.[4] At a time when there were only 211 pediatric surgeons in North America, Dr. Brooks’ accomplishments were extraordinary. Dr. Brooks contributed to the pediatric surgical literature with research focused on burns, congenital anomalies, and hepatitis preventative medicine. Performing over 20,000 surgeries on infants, Dr. Brooks adopted novel practices that would later become standard procedures. She introduced conservative management of splenic injuries, which challenged surgical dogma and sparked controversy within the male-dominated surgical establishment.[5]\n\nLegacy and Inspiration\n\nDr. Brooks was widely recognized for her various accomplishments. She received numerous accolades, including the prestigious Horatio Alger Award and induction into the Texas Women’s Hall of Fame.[1, 4] As testament to her impact, the Benjy Brooks Foundation for Children, Inc. was established by one of her grateful patients to advance pediatric surgical care in Texas. Additionally, the women in pediatric surgery of the American Pediatric Surgical Association honoured her by naming their society committee after her, with a mission to educate, motivate, and support women pediatric surgeons in realizing their personal and professional goals.[7]\n\nDr. Benjy Brooks acknowledged the strength and resilience of the influential women who came before her, recognizing their influence on her own journey. She became a role model not only for aspiring female pediatric surgeons but also for all women who aspire to break barriers and choose careers traditionally dominated by men.\n\nThe life and achievements of Dr. Benjy Frances Brooks were revolutionary. Her determination and perseverance enabled her to overcome the limitations imposed by society, forging a path that not only defied expectations but also created opportunities for future generations. Dr. Brooks’ story is a reminder that true pioneers break down barriers, challenge norms, and leave an everlasting impact on their fields. She remains an inspiration to all who dare to dream big, fight against adversity, and forge their path to success.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.

I was used to being 1 of 2 or 1 of 3, or even the only Black person. Because of that, none of my mentors in college shared the same identity as me. However, they guided, supported, and advocated for me to excel. The best mentors I had recommended me for internships and awards, taught me about professionalism and how to stand out amongst my peers beyond academics. I cherished their support, but I also spent many days pouring over ways to mentor those after me. BIPOC students in academically rigorous career paths get messaging early on the need to support those coming after us; it is sometimes painted as if the lineage of Black excellence may cease to exist if we don’t give back. I found BIPOC students to help during medical school application season; I made sure to have lunches with freshmen from Black and Brown identities to offer resources and emotional support. These efforts multiplied when I finally got into medical school: the BIPOC students got emailed regularly for mentorship, essay help, minority afterschool programming assistance, role model panels, and upperclassmen advice sessions for new students.\n\nPeople of color often acknowledge that we stand on the shoulders of giants; these shoulders allow us to excel in medicine, to be trailblazers in various specialties, and to pursue our dreams. We are breaking glass ceilings, and walking unpaved roads in our careers. All the while, we are tasked with uplifting and guiding the next generation after us. There are currently less than 10% of female physicians who identify as women of color,[1] and the 2022 incoming class of medical students are 23% underrepresented women of color.[1] It is not sustainable to have the fate of the next generation of diverse physicians rely only on the already small minority. In a similar vein to how diversity and equity initiatives are responsibilities everyone should take on, men, white individuals, and anyone else with a majority identity need to take their spot alongside these trailblazers to ensure there is a future for them. For the current occupants of the ivory white towers of medicine, unrepresented women of color in medicine need to raise our standards for how your privilege can do more.\n\nWhen we start using terms such as “diversity”, “equity”, and “inclusion”, we need to start asking what they really mean. Diversity is about visibility and representation. While medicine has begun to ramp up its recruitment of minorities, is there a place to observe the impact of these recruitment efforts? When we think of equity, we should focus on access and opportunity alongside identifying and eliminating barriers. To medical leadership—have you actually spoken to your minority faculty and trainees? While published literature is powerful in understanding the general state of the problem, an individual’s microenvironment will always be more important in determining the biases that continue to exist. Inclusion. Perhaps the most important as an inclusive group by definition will be diverse. A shared commitment to addressing our biases in order to encourage a sense of belonging, respect and full participation is needed. Inclusion is not only thinking about someone when they are right in front of you but even more importantly, when they are not—and asking why they are not right in front of you. Inclusion is for those of dominant identities to actively start inviting minorities into certain spaces and to start advocating for them to obtain opportunities and to be spaces. Instead of asking those who have only recently been invited to the table to usher more people in, those who have been sitting at their seats for decades should take a more active role in spearheading this expansion.\n\nNote: Underrepresented women of color in medicine is categorized as African American or Black, Hispanic or Latino, and American Indian or Alaska Native by the AAMC.\n\nREFERENCE\n\n1.

To the selfless parents and devoted siblings who navigate a world that often fails to recognize their immense challenges, this narrative sheds light on the silent battles they fight while embracing what many consider a “normal” life. It is a testament to the remarkable resilience and unconditional love that defines their journey, which deserves to be celebrated. This is a life story of a Tennessee woman whose journey of immense grief and unimaginable courage transformed into something awe-inspiring and positive. Now, I am compelled to share this riveting account on a platform that can be a rallying call of support to those caring for family members with special needs.\n\nThe journey of this incredible woman began in the spring of 2017 when she gave birth to a beautiful baby girl whose arrival was a source of immense joy. For anonymity, I will refer to the baby girl as Precious. Shortly after, her life was shattered when her daughter, Precious, at the age of three months, was violently shaken by a family member. The existence of this mother-daughter duo took a dramatic turn after that pivotal moment. The mother rushed her daughter into the ER, her heart heavy with worry for her precious baby girl. Precious coded for 20 minutes, leaving her with multiple seizures and a stroke. Further, she was diagnosed with cerebral palsy and lost her vision. Additionally, doctors revealed that her brain function was limited to the brain stem alone.\n\nThe mom was caught up in a whirlwind of emotions fluctuating between intense sorrow, anguish, and moments of fleeting peace throughout the arduous journey. Initially, she remained in denial, refusing to accept the reality of the situation. She clung to the hope that things would return to normal and this nightmare would vanish. But deep down, she knew that life had changed forever. The realization slowly settled in that she was now a special needs child’s mother, which would be her life from then on. Confusion and disbelief clouded her thoughts as she navigated the unfamiliar territory of being a caregiver to a child with special needs. She constantly questioned her capabilities. “Am I enough?” The dreams of watching her daughter take her first steps or hearing her laughter felt shattered. It was a heart-wrenching realization that required immense strength to accept.\n\nThrough this process, she began to reframe her thoughts and channel her energy toward finding strength. She learned that being enough wasn’t about having all the answers or being able to fix everything. It was about embracing the imperfections that came with the journey of raising a special needs child. Precious fought with extraordinary courage despite the countless challenges, clinging to life for three arduous years. Yet, on a somber night 2020, at the age of three, her fragile body succumbed to the toll of her initial injury.\n\nAmidst her pain and sorrow, the mother transformed the darkest chapter of her life into a catalyst for good through her book, “Going Through Trials with God: Seven Lessons Learned through Shaken Baby Syndrome,” vividly sharing the invaluable insights she gained throughout their journey as the primary caregiver to her daughter. Since then, she has dedicated her life to raising awareness and imparting valuable lessons about raising a special needs child. She actively supports parents of children with special needs, empathizing with their immense pressures and difficulties, including the constant need for someone to watch over a child with special needs, often requiring 24/7 care and attention. Recognizing the financial strain of managing care, she tirelessly assists parents in navigating the complex world of acquiring government assistance and resources to lighten their burdens. She understands that people often feel intimidated by caring for a child with special needs due to a lack of knowledge. With boundless compassion, she advocates for proper care and interaction with these extraordinary children, breaking down barriers and fostering inclusivity. She aims to inspire, educate, and encourage others by imparting her daughter’s story to the world.\n\nIn the face of unspeakable adversity, this mother has turned her deepest pain into a powerful purpose, reminding us of all of the boundless strength that lies within us, that can carry us through the darkest of times, and the profound importance of cherishing every precious moment with our loved ones.\n\nINSPIRATIONAL PERSPECTIVE NUMBER 75\n\nDr. TDR – Overcoming Obstacles to Establish a Novel Surgical Field\n\nOviya Giri1, Pavai Arunachalam1, V. R. Ravikumar2\n\n1Department of Pediatric Surgery, PSG Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, 2Department of Pediatric Surgery, G. Kuppuswamy Naidu Memorial Hospital, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India\n\nIn the sphere of medical history, certain individuals stand out as beacons of inspiration. Dr. Thiruvengadasamy Dorairajan, fondly known as Dr. TDR, is one such remarkable figure who has left an impressionable mark on the field of Pediatric Surgery in India. With great determination, he embarked on a lifelong journey of innovation, mentorship, and academic excellence, transforming the landscape of pediatric surgical training in the country.\n\nA Passion Ignited\n\nDr. TDR displayed a relentless thirst for knowledge and a commitment to excellence from a young age. After graduating from Kellet High School in Chennai with the prestigious Papworth Shield, he set out to pursue his medical education at Madras Medical College.[1] It was during his medical school days that his disciplined approach to academics was reinforced through his active participation in the National Cadet Corps and the National Service Scheme.\n\nThe Mentorship that Shaped a Pioneer\n\nAfter completing his surgical training at his alma mater, Dr. TDR’s passion for Pediatric Surgery blossomed in the 1960s. Through the coveted Commonwealth Scholarship, he journeyed to Australia to train under the legendary Dr. Douglas Stephens at the Royal Children’s Hospital in Melbourne.[1] Dr. Stephens’ guidance proved to be transformative, exposing Dr. TDR to groundbreaking techniques in Pediatric Urology and anorectal anomalies. During his final days in Melbourne, his mentor Dr. Stephens presented him with a McCarthy’s miniature cystourethroscope. Armed with newfound knowledge and skills, Dr. TDR returned to India. He used this precious gift to perform numerous endourological procedures. His pivotal experience with Dr. Stephens propelled him to perform multiple pioneering pediatric surgical procedures in India. Including the first open perineal urethrostomy and posterior urethral valve excisions back when infant-sized cystoscopes and resectoscopes were not yet made available by the Indian Government. Which makes this a tremendous feat! With gratitude, he returned the gift to the Museum of Sydney Children’s Hospital in honour of Dr. Douglas Stephens. Driven by his commitment to the field, he pushed boundaries and blazed a trail where none had gone before.\n\nIn 1962, Dr. TDR founded the Department of Pediatric Surgery at Government Erskine Hospital in Madurai, India.[2] This marked the birth of the nation’s first formal Pediatric Surgery training programs. Throughout his illustrious career, Dr. TDR took on academic appointments at prestigious institutions: Madurai Medical College (1970-1979), Madras Medical College (1979-1987), Dr. MGR Medical University (1988-1994), and the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (1982-1988).[1] His commitment to mentorship and knowledge dissemination inspired countless students who would go on to shape the future of pediatric surgery in India.\n\nInnovations and Contributions\n\nDr. TDR’s contributions extended beyond his role as a mentor. He contributed extensively to early pediatric surgical literature, with research interests in megalourethra, rectal atresia, hydronephrosis, chronic calcifying pancreatitis, and racial bias in hemangiomas. Even in his seventies, he embraced the advent of laparoscopy in India and attended numerous international meetings to pursue advanced endoscopic skills. He performed the first thoracoscopic sympathectomy and remained at the forefront of minimally invasive surgery well into his eighties.[1] As one of the founders of the associations: Pediatric Endoscopic Surgeons of India and the Indian Association of Pediatric Surgeons, he laid the groundwork for future advancements in the field.[1]\n\nA Legacy Honoured\n\nDr. TDR’s contributions were phenomenally recognized. His strong commitment to the field of Pediatric Surgery earned him the prestigious “Lifetime Contribution Award” from the President of India, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam.[1] In recognition of his impact, the Pediatric Surgeons of Coimbatore, India, established a Gold Medal examination in his honor, aiming to foster early mentorship and learning opportunities for medical students. Today, Dr. T. Dorairajan is revered as a father figure of Pediatric Surgery, with his influence and legacy continuing to inspire generations of aspiring surgeons.\n\nDr. T. Dorairajan’s journey from a devoted learner to a pioneering force in Pediatric Surgery serves as a testament to the power of passion, perseverance, and mentorship. His relentless pursuit of excellence, despite challenges, has reshaped the landscape of pediatric surgical training in India. Dr. TDR’s story reminds us that with dedication and a burning desire to make a difference, we can leave an enduring impact on the world.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1. Ravikumar VR, Raveenthiran V. Professor T.

She would have preferred a 12-week leave but felt guilty about burdening her colleagues. Upon return, she resumes taking call at a more frequent level to make up for the call missed during leave.\n\nShe plans to breastfeed for 12 months, and on her first day back, brings in a breast pump, clean supplies, and a cooler. However, within two weeks, her milk supply has dipped because she cannot find time during the day to pump. Between the extra call and getting up at night with her baby, she is exhausted and dejected. She stops breastfeeding after a month.\n\nDr. A’s husband, a surgeon, is unable to drop off or pick up their baby from day care. His salary is higher, so it makes more sense for Dr. A to trim her hours. She cuts back to 0.8 FTE. Even with the reduced hours (and salary), she has to rush to leave clinic before the daycare closes and never finishes her documentation during the workday. She’s receiving reminders about unclosed charts and unseen in-box messages. She no longer enjoys her clinical work, feeling she can’t devote enough time to patient encounters. She worries every day that she’s not spending enough time with her child.\n\nWe might well ask, “Who would continue under these conditions?”\n\nThousands of physicians have left clinical practice in the last year, increasing the pressure on healthcare organizations to fulfill their mandate to provide safe, high-quality, timely care. Women physicians are a vital component of the healthcare workforce, given that more than one-third of practicing physicians are women.[1]\n\nThe vast majority of women physicians will become mothers.[2] And yet, the professional culture in medicine, short-sighted organizational policies and compensation models, and limiting social norms seriously undermine the ability of physician moms to remain in the profession. We need urgent action to address the issues driving them from medicine.\n\nFueled by societal norms, women physicians spend more time on household and child-rearing tasks than their male partners.[3] It’s also more likely that their partner works full-time compared with their male co-workers’ partners.[4]\n\nWomen physicians work differently than their male colleagues; they spend time on certain tasks (more time in the EHR and more time in patient visits). Despite indications that women physicians achieve better patient outcomes,[5] this value-added time is often not counted in productivity metrics, which generally focus on the number of patients seen or procedures completed.\n\nTo retain and support physician moms, we need a serious paradigm shift. Specifically, the medical profession, healthcare organizational leaders, and policymakers need to move to an approach that views budgetary choices, compensation models, reimbursement schedules, and workforce support policies through a different lens. Instead of applying a “let them sink or swim” attitude, we need stakeholders to be asking the question, “What do we need to do to retain and advance physician moms?”\n\nWith this new lens, Dr. A would be encouraged to take a full 12-week parental leave, and a float clinician would be available to mitigate the burden on Dr. A’s colleagues. When she returned to work, Dr. A would have access to on-site day care and be provided with regular breaks for pumping. She would have access to paid scribes, efficient workflow processes, and the support of a team to co-manage inbox messaging and documentation. The compensation model would reward high-quality care and support patient-provider relationships rather than a “churn and burn” approach.\n\nInitially, there may be resistance to this new perspective, because when enacted it will likely result in financial and other resources being distributed differently. It may be helpful to consider the difference between equality, in which each person has access to the same resource, and equity, in which each person has access to the resource they need to be most successful.\n\nWithout physician moms, healthcare organizations cannot thrive, and they may not survive. Using an equity lens, it makes perfect sense to invest in improving the work environment for physician moms. Healthcare organizations that choose to do so position themselves to have a more vibrant, stable physician workforce that can meet the unexpected events inherent in healthcare today.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.

There was a kiosk with those expensive hair straighteners and I asked a lady to put in a few curls for me as a favor. She called over to the lady at the next kiosk and asked her to find a hair clip. “She’s getting married today!”, she said. The bedazzled hair accessory supported my sparse curls, the glare only matching the sweat of my upper mustache from trying on new fajas to go under my dress. I was 20 and pregnant with twins.\n\nI just finished two years at UC Berkeley directly from Pomona High School- something that not too many people did. Pomona was loud: sounds of the ice cream truck, the elotero’s horn, ambulances and fire trucks for something that was always happening was a stark contrast to the silence of the prostitutes along Holt Ave waiting for the men coming off of work. My friends and I learned to ignore these men on our mission to enjoy Popeye’s curly fries from the change we each gathered from home. My 2-bedroom home had a screen door that was somehow always cracked open and a chipped red-painted porch that welcomed bare feet on the summer nights when my mother and I would sit outside. Going to school was my way out. I barely got used to school- reteaching myself math after getting a D in my first semester of calculus. I knew to drop Chem1A and opt for more time at the Student Learning Center and with the Biology Scholars Program because, as my sister said, “People like us don’t start with these classes.” I didn’t know what that meant, but she was one year ahead of me- both of us on need-based scholarships as first-generation college students.\n\nI met a boy in the Coast Guard, and after a short 6 months of dating, I was pregnant. He was deployed within two weeks of eloping and I began my journey of taking pre-medical classes, continuing my work-study job, and finding a place for our growing family. I got around using the bus and the golf carts that shuttled able-bodied individuals along the hills of campus. Waiting in line at a local jamba juice to satisfy my fruit craving, two jocks behind me whispered to each other “shit, that sucks.” I lived above a pizza place named Pie in the Sky with three roommates. It always smelled of pizza and that, in fact, did not suck.\n\nWhat did suck was realizing that I was on my own. I left Berkeley when he was discharged from the military and we were back in Southern California but without job stability, health insurance, or money. The police were called to keep the peace after I said I had enough. I wish I had women in my life that helped me process this. I wish I didn’t come from generations of women who didn’t stay with their husbands who either beat them or whom they financially depended on. Instead, I ended up on an air mattress with my kids, waking up next to full Pampers to change. I was starting from scratch working as a hostess at PF Changs, an administrative job at a FQHC, and finishing Physics- my last course before my units could be transferred to Berkeley so that I could graduate. After eight years, I graduated with honors.\n\nMy kids and I slept on the floor of our first apartment. I kept or fixed furniture that was left by the garbage. I finally landed a job that allowed for financial stability as a Research Associate through the cumulative experiences that summer internships provided. I worked and studied for the MCAT, and I applied to medical school. Somehow, I got through two years of medical school in a pandemic. My research endeavors focus on representation in medicine, and access to clinical trials for minority communities. I hope to share narratives of first-generation and non-traditional students in medicine to highlight our unique lens. I hope to inspire those who also are breaking cycles to pursue a dream for better days ahead.\n\nINSPIRATIONAL PERSPECTIVE NUMBER 125\n\nVoting for Health: A Medical Student’s Jou"
