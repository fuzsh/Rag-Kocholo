        "text": "Dr. Dung and his staff was really accommodating and kind. They made sure we got an appointment every month and was always sweet to my son asking him how his day was going. They really made it much more convenient for residents of Molokai to be able to get braces.\n\nResponse from the owner: Thank you so so much for your kind review! It has been an absolute joy treating your family and we hope to continue serving the Molokai community for many years to come!\n\nWe live in Molokaâ€™i and dentistry is hard to find, but this guys would fly out and service all the keiki on the island. You canâ€™t beat their customer service! They were always kind and fun at every appointment. The best of the best!\n\nResponse from the owner: Mahalo Sterling, your review made our day! We LOVE our molokai patients and are so blessed to be able to serve the community there. Glad you had a positive experience with us, safe travels back to Molokai!\n\nDr. Dung and his entire staff are absolutely amazing!! We are on vacation and my daughterâ€™s braces broke. Dr. Dung took us in and fixed it with open arms ðŸ™‚ The team is welcoming and very kind!!! My daughter was so happy and in relief with their care and attention. We are so thankful to Dr. Dung and would recommend his practice to anyone!!! Thank you so much, we canâ€™t say enough how lucky we were to find you!! ðŸ™‚ Mahalo\n\nMy son's baby tooth fell out on the plane which was still connected to his braces and they took him in with no questions asked and fixed the problem so we could enjoy our week here for vacation. The dental hygienist was so nice and went out of her way to help us. It definitely shows what kind of staff works here and we can't tell you how much we appreciated it. Thanks again!\n\nVery friendly and accommodating staff. The glue came loose from one tooth for my permanent retainer, my orthodontist is not from here and they still were able to do a rebonding with a good price, and if it still bothered me, I was able to come back for readjustment. I would definitely recommend them.\n\nWe could not have made braces possible for our daughter if it wasn't for Dung Orthodontics graciously and steadfastly serving the Molokai community. Mahalo nui loa, Drs. Dung and Tom, for your commitment and care! The entire staff was truly fantastic - from start to finish. We highly recommend anyone seeking orthodontic care to choose Dung Orthodontics!\n\nResponse from the owner: Mahalo Jane for your kind review, it made our day! It has been an absolute joy treating your daughter and we are so glad that you had a good experience with our office. We LOVE our Molokai patients and hope to continue serving the community for years to come!\n\nThis team is awesome. They make me feel like family. Always friendly, and very welcoming. You guys rock!\n\nResponse from the owner: Mahalo Kaipo for the kind words, and for trusting us with your care!\n\nI would highly recommend Dung orthodontics! We were here on vacation and my daughter had an issue with her braces. Dr. Tom got her in the same day and fixed the problem. Dr. Tom and the whole team were so very kind, generous and extremely friendly! They turned a stressful situation into a joyful experience!\n\nExtraordinary orthodontist! Dr. Shiraki is able to improvise and adapt to complicated situations without invasive surgery or extractions. The office staff is wonderful to work with. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for an orthodontist!\n\nResponse from the owner: Mahalo for your kind words! We were glad we were able to help!\n\nLife changing for my daughter and her new beautiful smile!\n\nResponse from the owner: We are grateful that you took time to let us know how much your daughter's new smile means to all of you! Thank you for being the best part of our practice!\n\nAbsolutely amazing customer service, and quality of care. I went to their Office with my teeth looking far from the greatest, but when I finished I felt like a million dollars and my teeth looked that way as well. I will continue to carry the advice that was given to me about how to maintain healthy teeth throughout life. I highly recommend, going here definitely changed my life. Thank you. (Btw military friendly)\n\nI donâ€™t have the words to describe how thankful I am to Dr. Dung and Sheena and staff! Iâ€™m here from Yokosuka, Japan for a medical procedure. I needed help with my retainers and due to the holidays and other reasons, I couldnâ€™t see an orthodontist soon enough. I called Dr. Dungs office and Sheena was AMAZING. She kept me calm and when I came in, they helped me right away. The location is great and parking is easy as well. Thank you Dr. Dung and office Ohana for helping me.\n\nWas visiting from Washington state and the retaining software for my braces had degraded and snapped on two of my teeth. After calling around and getting several quick and apologetic denials for an emergent visit from other local orthodontists, Dr. Dung was able to squeeze me in. The visit was timely and the staff and hygienist were helpful and courteous. If I lived on Oahu I would have made them my orthodontist for sure."
