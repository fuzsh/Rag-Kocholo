In this talk, we will describe work at DeepMind to develop AlphaFold, a new deep learning-based system for structure prediction that achieves high accuracy across a wide range of targets. We demonstrated our system in the 14th biennial Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP14) across a wide range of difficult targets, where the assessors judged our predictions to be at an accuracy “competitive with experiment” for approximately 2/3rds of proteins. The talk will cover both the underlying ideas of AlphaFold and the implications for biological research.\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared.\n\nPL2 What’s new? Highlight session\n\nPL2.1 Single cell, whole embryo phenotyping of pleiotropic disorders of mammalian development\n\nJana Henck1;2, Xingfan Huang3, Chengxiang Qiu3, Varun Sreenivasan1, Sascha Ulferts4, Rose Behncke4, Nils Hansmeier4, Rene Haegerling4, Alexandra Despang2, Daniel Ibrahim2, Alessa Ringel2, Michael Robson5, Lars Wittler2, Vera Kalscheuer2, Uwe Kornak6, Natja Haag7, Ingo Kurth7, Wing-Lee Chan4, David Beier8, Lauren Saunders3, Cole Trapnell3, Diane Dickel9, Axel Visel9, Len Pennacchio9, Junyue Cao10, Jay Shendure3, Malte Spielmann1;2\n\n1Universitätsklinikum Schleswig-Holstein, Human Genetics, Lübeck, Germany; 2Max Planck Institut für molekulare Genetik, Berlin, Germany; 3University of Washington, Department of Genome Sciences, Seattle, United States; 4Charité Institut für Medizinische Genetik und Humangenetik, Berlin, Germany; 5Max Planck Institut für molekulare Genetik, Development and Disease, Berlin, Germany; 6Universitätsmedizin Göttingen, Institut für Humangenetik, Göttingen, Germany; 7Universitätsklinik Aachen, Institut für Humangenetik, Aachen, Germany; 8Seattle Children’s Research Institute, Center for Developmental Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Seattle, United States; 9Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, Berkeley, United States; 10Rockefeller University, New York, United States\n\nBackground/Objectives: Mouse models represent a critical tool to study human diseases, as well as for advancing our general understanding of developmental biology. However, current phenotyping technologies lack the necessary throughput and resolution for the investigation of mutations at the organismal scale. In this study, we set out to establish single cell RNA sequencing as a tool for large scale standardized and comprehensive phenotypic analysis of whole mouse mutant embryos.\n\nMethods: In a multiplexed experiment, we applied single cell RNA sequencing to profile 104 whole mouse embryos from 22 different mutants and 4 wild type strains at embryonic stage E13.5. The mouse mutants range from established multisystem disorders to single enhancer deletions. We developed and applied several analytical frameworks for detecting differences in composition and gene expression changes across all cell types and trajectories.\n\nResults: We present a mouse mutant cell atlas (MMCA) consisting of 1.9 million single cell RNA-seq profiles and identify 300 significantly changed cell type proportions from 52 sub trajectories across the 22 mutants. Some mutants exhibited changes in dozens of trajectories (e.g., the pleiotropic consequences of altering the Sox9 regulatory landscape) whereas the impact of others was considerably more restricted. We further identified differences between widely used wild type strains, compared gain vs. loss of function mutants, and identified changes that are shared by heretofore unrelated models.\n\nConclusion: Our findings show how single cell profiling of whole embryos can enable the systematic molecular and cellular phenotypic characterization of mouse mutants with unprecedented breadth and resolution.\n\nReferences:\n\nGrants:\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared.\n\nPL2.2 Balanced chromosomal rearrangements offer insights into coding and noncoding genomic features associated with developmental disorders (virtual)\n\nChelsea Lowther1;2;3, Mana Mehrjouy4, Ryan Collins1;2;5, Mads Bak4, Olga Dudchenko6;7, Harrison Brand1;2;3, Zirui Dong8, Malene B.

However, the rarity of BCRs in the population has precluded unbiased analyses of the features and mechanisms associated with risk for DDs.\n\nMethods: We aggregated 1,420 BCR breakpoints from 406 DD cases and 304 control BCR carriers.\n\nResults: We found that BCRs were not more likely to disrupt genes in DD cases than controls but were seven-fold more likely to disrupt genes associated with dominant DDs (21.3% of cases vs. 3.4% of controls; P = 1.60 × 10-12). Moreover, BCRs that did not disrupt a known DD gene were significantly enriched for breakpoints that altered topologically associated domains (TADs) containing dominant DD genes in cases compared to controls (odds ratio [OR] = 1.43, P = 0.036). We discovered six TADs enriched for noncoding BCRs that contained known DD genes and were collectively disrupted by 7.4% of the DD cohort. Phased Hi-C analyses of five cases with noncoding BCR breakpoints localized to the TAD encompassing MEF2C confirmed extensive disruption to local 3D chromatin structures and reduced frequency of contact between the MEF2C promoter and enhancers. We further identified six genomic features enriched in TADs preferentially disrupted by noncoding BCRs in DD cases and used these features to build a model to predict TADs at risk for LRPEs across the genome.\n\nConclusion: These results emphasize the potential impact of noncoding structural variants to cause LRPEs in unsolved DD cases, as well as the complexity of predicting TAD intolerance.\n\nReferences:\n\nGrants:\n\nConflict of Interest: Chelsea Lowther: None declared, Mana Mehrjouy I am an employee of Illumina Inc., Ryan Collins: None declared, Mads Bak: None declared, Olga Dudchenko: None declared, Harrison Brand: None declared, Zirui Dong: None declared, Malene B.

However, for clinical applications it is crucial to minimize the risk of adverse effects due to unintended CRISPR-induced mutations. To increase our understanding of unintended CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing in vivo, we investigated the genomes of >1100 genome edited zebrafish larvae, juveniles and adults from two generations.\n\nMethods: We used four guide RNAs (gRNAs), previously used in functional studies, to edit the genome of fertilized zebrafish eggs at the 1-cell stage. Off-target sites were detected in vitro by Nano-OTS. We then used long-read sequencing to determine the CRISPR-Cas9 outcomes at on- and off-target sites.\n\nResults: In founder larvae, on-target editing of the four gRNAs was 93-97% efficient, and three sites across two gRNAs were identified with in vivo off-target editing. Six percent of the CRISPR-Cas9 editing outcomes corresponded to structural variants (SVs), including deletions <4.8 kb and insertions <1.4 kb. The F1 generation contained high levels of genome editing, with all alleles of 46 examined F1 juvenile fish affected by on-target mutations, including four cases of SVs. In addition, 26% of the juvenile F1 fish carried off-target mutations.\n\nConclusion: We demonstrate that large SVs and off-target mutations can be introduced in vivo and segregate to the next generation. Our results have important consequences for clinical applications, and we outline a validation method based on long-read sequencing to reduce the risk of unanticipated effects with potentially large implications.\n\nReferences:\n\nGrants:\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared.\n\nPL2.4 Loss-of-function of AMFR causes autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia by altering lipid metabolism\n\nRuizhi Deng1;2, Eva Medico Salsench1, Anita Nikoncuk1, Niko Kühn1, Reshmi Ramakrishnan3, Kristina Lanko1, Leslie Sanderson1, Herma C van der Linde1, Soheil Yousefi1, Ivan Capo4, Evita Medici van den Herik5, Marjon van Slegtenhorst1, Rick van Minkelen1, Rob Willemsen1, Walter de Valk1;2, Geert Geeven1;2, Kay Metcalfe6, Lenika De Simone7, Nancy Kuntz7, Arjan Bouman1, Lies Hoefsloot1;2, Maha Zaki8, Joseph Gleeson9, Stefan T Arold3;10, Tjakko Van Ham1, Reza Maroofian11, Stefan Barakat1;2\n\n1Erasmus MC University Medical Center, Clinical Genetics, Rotterdam, Netherlands; 2Erasmus MC University Medical Center, Whole Genome Sequencing Implementation and Research Task Force, Department of Clinical Genetics, Rotterdam, Netherlands; 3King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Computational Bioscience Research Center (CBRC), Division of Biological and Environmental Sciences and Engineering (BESE), Thuwal, Saudi Arabia; 4University of Novi Sad, Medical Faculty Novi Sad, Novi Sad, Serbia; 5Erasmus MC University Medical Center, Department of Neurology, Rotterdam, Netherlands; 6Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, Manchester Centre for Genomic Medicine, St Mary’s Hospital, Manchester, United Kingdom; 7Ann & Robert H.

Primary patient fibroblasts, neural stem cells (NSCs) and in vivo modeling using zebrafish disease mechanisms were studied including initial pre-clinical experiments for possible therapy development.\n\nResults: We identified bi-allelic truncating variants in AMFR, which encoding a RING-H2 finger E3 ubiquitin ligase anchored at the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum in 16 individuals from 7 unrelated families. Patients segregated with a phenotype of both pure as well as complex HSP consisting of global developmental delay, intellectual disability, motor dysfunction, and progressive spasticity. We show that absence of AMFR causes altered lipid metabolism leading to the accumulation of lipid droplets in NSCs, a finding which is also recapitulated in patient derived fibroblasts, both using light microscopy and electron microscopy studies. amfra-/- zebrafish larvae show similar lipid accumulation and altered locomotor activity likely phenocopying spasticity observed in patients. Interestingly, administration of an FDA approved drug partially improves the observed locomotor phenotype in amfra-/- larvae, which promises potential therapeutic interventions for this newly defined disorder.\n\nConclusion: Our study identifies bi-allelic truncating mutations in AMFR as a cause of a novel autosomal recessive HSP. Functional studies further implicate AMFR as the disease-causing gene by altering lipid metabolism which potentially could be therapeutically modulated.\n\nReferences:\n\nGrants:\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared.\n\nPL2.5 An integrated approach using multi-omics data to dissect cis-regulatory role of ultraconserved non-coding elements (UCNEs) in human retina\n\nVíctor López Soriano1, Alfredo Dueñas Rey1, Stijn Van de Sompele1, Frauke Coppieters1, Andrew Webster2, Miriam Bauwens1, Elfride De Baere1\n\n1Centrum medische genetica Gent, Gent, Belgium; 2Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom\n\nBackground/Objectives: Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has revealed an increasing number of pathogenic non-coding variants in inherited retinal diseases (IRD), with a majority of deep-intronic variants. We focus on the role of ultraconserved non-coding elements (UCNEs) defined as genomic regions >200 bp characterized by at least 95% human-chicken conservation, and their association with gene regulation and disease. Using an integrated multi-omics approach, we set out to assess a potential cis-regulatory role for active UCNEs in human retina.\n\nMethods: To predict UCNEs with active enhancer-like marks, we integrated publicly available transcriptomic (bulk and scRNA-seq) and epigenomic (ATAC-seq, DNase and histone modifications for active enhancers) datasets derived from human retinal material. WGS data from ~3,331 probands of the ophthalmological disease cohort of the 100,000 Genome Project Genomics England was mined to retrieve sequence variants (SNVs) and structural variants (SVs) within UCNEs.\n\nResults: Interrogation of multi-omics data derived from human retina revealed a total of 1,349 retina-active UCNEs. Interestingly, 40 genes under putative UCNE control are linked to an eye-disease phenotype. A total of 79 rare SNVs and 10 SVs related to genes implicated in IRD or other eye phenotypes were identified.\n\nConclusion: We identified 1,349 retina-active UCNEs potentially acting as CREs and representing an understudied target of non-coding variants that may explain missing heritability in IRD. Deciphering retinal UCNEs and their cis-regulatory landscapes will contribute to functional genome annotations in the retina and to the non-coding morbid genome of IRD. Ultimately, they may represent novel targets for treatment.\n\nReferences:\n\nGrants: StarT-H2020-MSCA-ITN-2018-N°81349, FWO1802220N.\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared.\n\nPL2.6 Noncoding regulatory mutations as driving event for the oncogenic core regulatory circuitries of neuroblastoma\n\nVincenzo Aievola1, Vito Alessandro Lasorsa2, Annalaura Montella3, Ferdinando Bonfiglio3, Matilde Tirelli4, Achille Iolascon3, Mario Capasso3\n\n1University of Naples Federico II, Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technologies, Naples, Italy; 2CEINGE Biotecnologie Avanzate, Naples, Italy; 3University of Naples Federico II, Department of Molecular Medicine and Medical Biotechnology, Naples, Italy; 4University of Milan, Milan, Italy\n\nBackground/Objectives: Neuroblastoma, a paediatric cancer composed of mesenchymal and adrenergic-like cells, can arise from impaired activity of Core Regulatory Circuitries (CRCs), Transcription Factors (TF) sets that determine the cell identity. We hypothesize that noncoding somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) altering TF binding sites (TFBSs) can affect cellular differentiation promoting cancer initiation. Our aim is to identify noncoding somatic SNVs that drive tumorigenesis by altering NB CRCs.\n\nMethods: Active TFBSs in adrenergic-like SKNBE2C neuroblastoma cells, identified through ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq, were integrated with SNVs obtained by whole genome sequencing of 151 neuroblastomas. Mutation rates of core/flanking regions were modeled using chi-square distribution. SNVs selected on CADD, FuncSeq2 and motifbreakR tools scores, were functionally tested with Luciferase assay. Expression of TFBSs target-genes, identified through HiC analysis in SKNBE2C, was evaluated using RNA-seq data of 89 patients with matched WGS. Target-genes expression values were correlated with clinical and survival data.\n\nResults: We found that transcriptionally active binding sites of TFs (PHOX2B, TBX2 and ISL1) belonging to adrenergic CRC were enriched of SNVs (FDR < 0.05). Among the selected variants, the chr7:126481446:A>C mutation was predicted to disrupt a PHOX2B motif and showed allele-specific transcriptional activity in Luciferase assay. HiC data showed significant PHOX2B motif interactions with GRM8 and PAX4, whose expression was reduced in mutated samples compared to wild types (P < 0.05). Low PAX4 expression correlated with stage 4 and reduced overall survival (P < 0.01).\n\nConclusion: This work demonstrates that combined noncoding somatic mutations affecting the CRC activity can promote neuroblastoma tumorigenesis.\n\nReferences:\n\nGrants: This work was founded by AIRC IG 2021 ID 25796.\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared.\n\nPL3 ELPAG Award Lecture\n\nPL3.1 ELPAG Award Lecture\n\nMartina Cornel\n\nOn the occasion of the ELPAG lecture I will briefly summarize my work.\n\nWe stand on shoulders of giants, and for me Leo ten Kate, Ségolène Aymé and Bartha Knoppers were amongst those giants. The latter cited as a legal basis for the The Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) Article 27 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This guarantees the rights of every individual in the world “to share in scientific advancement and its benefits”.\n\nThat attitude was already in the back of our minds when I started working with Leo ten Kate in the Northern Netherlands EUROCAT registration in 1984 in the Groningen Human Genetics department. As MD/epidemiologist I collected data on congenital anomalies, and offered physicians who notified the children to receive information, so they could use the scientific insights for the families they cared for. Also, we joined forces with patient- and parents organizations to inform mothers-to-be on the protective effects of folic acid against neural tube defects. I was scientific advisor on a national information campaign and visited the EU Parliament with spina bifida patients in wheelchairs and their assistance dogs.\n\nI later moved to Human Genetics Amsterdam as professor of Community Genetics and Public Health Genomics, and supervised PhD students on e.g. Genetics Education for Primary Care Physicians and Translating the Dynamics of Genetics into Health Care Practice. In those years Ségolène Aymé built an even more professional information service “Orphanet” including encyclopaedia, centres of expertise and information on trials and I was happy to start that in The Netherlands. I am involved in the national neonatal screening program and in the cascade screening in families for cardiogenetic conditions. As of June 1st 2022 all newborn infants in the Netherlands are offered screening for 26 conditions. The latest condition added is spinal muscular atrophy. Curative treatments are becoming available for an increasing number of conditions, and early diagnosis is needed for optimal effectiveness.\n\nListening to patients’ needs and trying to use genetic knowledge in their interest, taking into account their values is the common thread through my work.\n\nI would like encourage all ESHG visitors to apply our knowledge in the interest of future generations.\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared.\n\nPL5 ESHG Award Lecture\n\nPL5.1 ESHG Award Lecture\n\nAarno Palotie\n\nUsing the Finnish population structure and nationwide health records to understand the genetic basis of diseases\n\nPopulation isolates such as Finland provide benefits in genetic studies because the allelic spectrum of damaging alleles in any gene is often concentrated on a small number of low frequency variants (0.5% ≤ minor allele frequency < 5%), which survived the founding bottleneck, as opposed to being distributed over a much larger number of ultra-rare variants. This has been well documented for Mendelian diseases, including numerous studies on recessive diseases more common in Finland than any other population, often called as Finnish Disease Heritage. The value of the bottleneck effect in common diseases has only lately been explored. On the other hand, human genetics has matured to a point where the assessment of genotype-phenotype relationships in large populations can inform basic disease mechanisms and even benefit drug discovery efforts by identifying novel targets and informing on their potential safety profile. Finland provides special opportunities for such large-scale studies. In addition to the unique population structure, it has centralized medical records that cover comprehensive health care service usage of every resident over lifetime, like all Nordic countries. Partially stimulated by the national health care system and its registries, there is a strong tradition of epidemiological studies. These epidemiological studies have paved the way for biobank research and subsequently for large-scale genome studies. This tradition is further supported by legislation for biobanks and secondary usage of health register data. Consequently, several large-scale genomic studies have been performed or are in progress. These include the SUPER study (https://www.superfinland.fi) that collected over 10 000 psychosis cases, the Generisk study(https://www.generisk.fi) studying means how to return genetic information for participants and the FinnGen (https://www.finngen.fi), a public-private partnership project, combining genetic data with life long electronic health register data in 500 000 participants. Along with other large international projects these studies have provided insight for the field how common and rare variants contribute to disease susceptibility. The enrichment of selected, coding variants in the Finnish population provide advantages for understanding the genetic background of diseases. In the FinnGen project, among over 400 Finnish enriched diseases associations, more than 150 are coding variants. The disease associated coding variants enables to interpret functional consequences and design follow-up studies more readily than for non-coding variant associations. The FinnGen project was initiated in 2017 and Finnish biobanks have already collected over 500 000 participants for the project. FinnGen produces data freezes every six months. They consist of GWAS data generated with a population specific array and imputed against 8000 Finnish deep whole genome sequences enabling reliable identification of variants down to population frequencies around 1/1000. A safe computing environment that fulfils all data protection requirements has been built in the Google Cloud environment where partners can access individual level data but cannot download it. Results can be browsed in the FinnGen PheWeb browser. Results are made public for the entire research community after a 12 month embargo. Requests to download summary statistics can be placed here: https://www.finngen.fi/en/access_results. So far data has been downloaded by over 2000 scientists around the world. To shed light to the functional consequences of the Finnish enriched, disease associated variants various omics and cellular assays have been initiated along with deeper phenotyping.\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared.\n\nConcurrent SessionsC01 New genes in NDDs\n\nC01.1 Germline variants in tumor suppressor FBXW7 lead to impaired ubiquitination and a novel neurodevelopmental syndrome\n\nSarah Stephenson1;2, Gregory Costain3;4;5, Laura Blok6, Michael Silk7;8, Thanh-Binh Nguyen7;8, FBXW7 International consortium (multiple authors)9, Sze-Chern Lim10, Sue White2;10, David Ascher7;8;11, Annette Schenck6, Paul Lockhart1;2, John Christodoulou2;10, Tiong Yang Tan2;10\n\n1Murdoch Children’s Research Institute, Melbourne, Australia; 2University of Melbourne, Department of Paediatrics, Melbourne, Australia; 3The Hospital for Sick Children, Division of Clinical and Metabolic Genetics, Toronto, Canada; 4The Hospital for Sick Children, Program in Genetics and Genome Biology, Toronto, Canada; 5University of Toronto, Department of Paediatrics, Toronto, Canada; 6Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud university medical enter, Department of Human Genetics, Nijmegen, Netherlands; 7ACRF Facility for Innovative Cancer Drug Discovery, Bio21 Institute, Structural Biology and Bioinformatics, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Melbourne, Australia; 8Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute, Computational Biology and Clinical Informatics, Melbourne, Australia; 9Multiple affiliations, Multiple, Australia; 10Murdoch Children’s Research Institute, Victorian Clinical Genetics Services, Melbourne, Australia; 11University of Cambridge, Department of Biochemistry, Cambridge, United Kingdom\n\nBackground/Objectives: Neurodevelopmental disorders are highly heterogenous conditions resulting from abnormalities of brain architecture and/or function. FBXW7 (F-box and WD repeat domain containing 7), a recognised developmental gene and tumour suppressor, has been shown to regulate cell cycle progression, cell growth and survival by targeting substrates including CYCLIN E1/2 and NOTCH for degradation via the ubiquitin proteasome system.\n\nMethods: We used a genotype-first approach, global data sharing platforms and clinical deep phenotyping to identify individuals with FBXW7 variants. We undertook in silico protein modelling, expression of recombinant FBXW7 missense variants in cultured HEK293T cells, and pan-neuronal knockdown of the Drosophila ortholog, ago, to understand their functional impact.\n\nResults: We identified 35 individuals harbouring germline FBXW7 de novo and inherited monoallelic chromosomal deletions, nonsense, frameshift, splice site and missense variants associated with a neurodevelopmental syndrome. The FBXW7 neurodevelopmental syndrome is distinguished by global developmental delay, borderline to severe intellectual disability, hypotonia and gastrointestinal issues. Brain imaging detailed variable structural abnormalities affecting the cerebellum, corpus callosum and white matter. A crystal structure model of FBXW7 predicted missense variants clustered at the substrate-binding surface of the WD40 domain and may reduce FBXW7 substrate binding affinity. Expression of recombinant FBXW7 missense variants in cultured cells demonstrated impaired CYCLIN E1 and CYCLIN E2 turnover.

We delineate a novel autosomal recessive intellectual disability disorder, caused by variants in the GTF3C3 gene.\n\nMethods: An international collaboration, exome sequencing, molecular modelling and a knockdown Drosophila model were used to characterise the GTF3C3 variants.\n\nResults: We identified fifteen affected individuals from nine unrelated families harbouring homozygous and compound heterozygous variants in GTF3C3. Of these, thirteen individuals have recurrent variants at four positions, of which one variant is hyper-recurrent in seven individuals. The cohort manifests a core neurodevelopmental phenotype including intellectual disability and developmental delay, variable non-familial facial features and congenital anomalies, and seizures in nine individuals. Molecular modelling shows the variants cluster in a hotspot in the tetratricopeptide repeat structural motif, an ancient protein-protein interaction module. Neuronal knockdown of the Drosophila GTF3C3 ortholog causes deficits in habituation learning and seizure-like behaviour. These findings support a causal relationship of GTF3C3 variants with intellectual disability and epilepsy.\n\nConclusion: We present combined genomic and functional evidence for disruption of GTF3C3 as the aetiology for an autosomal recessive form of syndromic intellectual disability.\n\nReferences:\n\nGrants: Australian NHMRC, Centre for Research Excellence APP1117394.\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared.\n\nC01.3 A novel neurodevelopmental syndrome caused by loss-of-function of the Zinc Finger Homeobox 3 (ZFHX3) gene\n\nMaría del Rocío Pérez Baca1, Eva Z.

Here, we identify loss-of-function variation in ZFHX3 as a novel cause for syndromic intellectual disability (ID). ZFHX3, previously known as ATBF1, is a zinc-finger homeodomain transcription factor involved in multiple biological processes including cell differentiation and tumorigenesis.\n\nMethods: Through international collaboration, we collected clinical data of 34 individuals with premature truncating variants or (partial) deletions of ZFHX3. Via data-mining and multiple in vitro models we identified the subcellular localization and binding partners of ZFHX3. We used a reverse genetic approach to characterize the ZFHX3 orthologue in Drosophila melanogaster.\n\nResults: Loss-of-function variation of ZFHX3 consistently associates with (mild) ID, postnatal growth retardation, feeding difficulties, and recognizable facial characteristics as supported by artificial intelligence (Face2Gene). Publicly available and in-house generated expression data show increased expression of ZFHX3 during human brain development and neuronal differentiation. Immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry in neural stem cells and SH-SY5Y shows that ZFHX3 interacts with the chromatin remodelling BRG1/Brm-associated factor complex and the cleavage and polyadenylation complex. In addition, we identified a specific DNA methylation signature in leukocyte-derived DNA. In Drosophila melanogaster, ZFH2 is considered the ZFHX3 orthologue. We show that ZFH2 is expressed in the third instar larval brain and that its knockdown results in an adult lethal phenotype suggestive for a key role in development.\n\nConclusion: Loss-of-function variants in ZFHX3 are a novel cause for syndromic ID. Our results indicate a role for ZFHX3 in chromatin remodelling and mRNA processing.\n\nReferences:\n\nGrants: Marguerite Marie Delacroix fellowship 365X00120, BOF/STA/201909/009\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared.\n\nC01.4 Pathogenic variants in U2AF2 and PRPF19 encoding essential spliceosomal subunits cause neurodevelopmental disorders with autistic features\n\nDong Li1\n\n1Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, United States\n\nBackground/Objectives: The pre-mRNA splicing is a highly coordinated and precise process that involves numerous trans pre-mRNA binding protein factors. We describe pathogenic variants in two such factors, U2AF2 and PRPF19, guiding the early stage of splice-site choice and activating spliceosome, respectively.\n\nMethods: By exome sequencing and international matchmaking, we identified 35 unrelated individuals with 17 different de novo novel missense variants in U2AF2 and four individuals with de novo novel PFPF19 variants.\n\nResults: Four out of the 17 U2AF2 variants were recurrent in 20 individuals, representing mutation hotspots of U2AF2. Detailed clinical assessment of the affected individuals with U2AF2 or PFPF19 variants showed consistent presentations. In vitro assays demonstrated ten U2AF2 variants affected splicing and RNA binding affinity. Crystal structures of two U2AF2 mutants were determined on X-ray, which indicated that hydrogen bonds with the polypyrimidine tract nucleotides were disrupted by the bulky residue replacement or the shortened length of the side chain. Multiple neural-specific RNAis of Drosophila orthologues U2af50 and Prp19 led to mushroom body (MB) patterning defects, seizures, and social deficits. These phenotypes mimic the salient features observed in two patient cohorts. Remarkably, these phenotypes seen in flies can be rescued by wild type human U2AF2 or PRPF19 but not the variants identified in humans, highlighting the pathogenic nature of the identified variants in the two genes. RNA-Seq of fly RNAi brains revealed three downstream effectors which could rescue reduced MB volume phenotype.\n\nConclusion: In conclusion, this study extends the tally of causative genes in neurodevelopmental disorders to include two splicing factors.\n\nReferences:\n\nGrants:\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared.\n\nC01.5 De novo missense variants in the E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor KLHL20 cause a developmental disorder with intellectual disability, epilepsy and autism spectrum disorder\n\nYoeri Sleyp1, Irene Valenzuela2, Andrea Accogli3;4, Katleen Ballon5, Bruria Ben-Zeev6;7, Sam Berkovic8, Martin Broly9;10, Patrick Callaerts1, Raymond Caylor11, Perrine Charles12, Nicolas Chatron13, Lior Cohen14;15, Antonietta Coppola16, Dawn Cordeiro17, Claudia Cuccurullo16, Ivon Cuscó2, Janette diMonda18, Ramon Duran-Romaña19;20, Nina Ehilevitch21, Paula Fernández-Alvarez2, Chris Gordon22, Bertrand Isidor9, Boris Keren23, Gaetan Lesca13, Jarymke Maljaars24, Saadet Mercimek-Andrews17;25, Michelle Morrow26, Alison Muir27, Frederic Rousseau19;20, Vincenzo Salpietro4;28, Ingrid Scheffer8;29, Rhonda Schnur26, Joost Schymkowitz19;20, Erika Souche30, Jean Steyaert31, Elliot Stolerman11, Jaime Vengoechea32, Dorothée Ville33, Camerun Washington11, Karin Weiss21;34, Rinat Zaid21, Lynette Sadleir35, Heather Mefford27;36, Hilde Peeters1;30\n\n1KU Leuven, Department of Human Genetics, Leuven, Belgium; 2University Hospital Vall d’Hebron and Medicine Genetics Group & Vall d’Hebron Research Institute, Department of Clinical and Molecular Genetics, Barcelona, Spain; 3IRRCS Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Medical Genetics Unit, Genoa, Italy; 4University of Genoa, Department of Neurosciences, Rehabilitation, Ophthalmology, Genetics, Maternal and Child Health, Genoa, Italy; 5University Hospitals Leuven, Centre for Developmental Disabilities, Leuven, Belgium; 6The Edmond and Lily Safra Pediatric Hospital & Sheba Medical Center, Pediatric Neurology Department, Ramat Gan, Israel; 7Tel Aviv University, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv, Israel; 8University of Melbourne & Austin Health, Department of Medicine & Epilepsy Research Centre, Heidelberg, VIC, Australia; 9Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) de Nantes, Service de Génétique Médicale, Nantes, France; 10Swiss Institute of Genomic Medicine, Medigenome, Geneva, Switzerland; 11Greenwood Genetic Center, Greenwood, SC, United States; 12APHP, Salpêtrière Hospital Genetic Department and Reference Center for Rare Intellectual Disabilities, Paris, France; 13Hospices Civils de Lyon and NeuroMyogene Institute, CNRS UMR 5310 - INSERM U1217, Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Department of Medical Genetics, Lyon, France; 14The Genetics Institute, Barzilai University Medical Center, Ashkelon, Israel; 15Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Faculty of Health Sciences, Beer Sheba, Israel; 16Federico II University, Department of Neuroscience and Reproductive and Odontostomatological Sciences, Naples, Italy; 17The Hospital for Sick Children, Division of Clinical and Metabolic Genetics, Toronto, ON, Canada; 18Emory Healthcare, Department of Human Genetics, Atlanta, GA, United States; 19VIB-KU Leuven Center for Brain & Disease Research, Switch Laboratory, Leuven, Belgium; 20KU Leuven, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Leuven, Belgium; 21The Genetics Institute, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel; 22Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale (INSERM) & Institut Imagine & Université de Paris, Laboratory of embryology and genetics of human malformations, Paris, France; 23AP-HP.Sorbonne Université & Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Département de Génétique, Paris, France; 24KU Leuven, Parenting and Special Education Research Unit, Leuven, Belgium; 25University of Alberta, Department of Medical Genetics & Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada; 26GeneDx, Gaithersburg, MD, United States; 27University of Washington, Division of Genetic Medicine & Department of Pediatrics, Seattle, WA, United States; 28IRRCS Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Pediatric Neurology and Muscular Diseases Unit, Genoa, Italy; 29University of Melbourne & Royal Children’s Hospital, Department of Paediatrics, VIC, Australia; 30University Hospitals Leuven, Center for Human Genetics, Leuven, Belgium; 31KU Leuven, Center for Developmental Psychiatry, Leuven, Belgium; 32Emory University, Department of Human Genetics, Atlanta, GA, United States; 33Lyon University Hospital, Department of Neuropediatrics, Lyon, France; 34Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, The Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Haifa, Israel; 35University of Otago, Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, Wellington, New Zealand; 36St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, Center for Pediatric Neurological Disease Research, Memphis, TN, United States\n\nBackground/Objectives: KLHL20 is part of a CUL3-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in protein ubiquitination. KLHL20 functions as the substrate adaptor that recognizes substrates and mediates the transfer of ubiquitin to the substrates. Although KLHL20 regulates neurite outgrowth and synaptic development in animal models, its role in human neurodevelopment remains unknown. We delineate a novel neurodevelopmental disorder caused by de novo missense variants in KLHL20.\n\nMethods: Patients were ascertained by investigators through GeneMatcher. Deep phenotyping of patients with de novo missense variants in KLHL20 was performed.\n\nResults: We studied 14 patients with de novo missense variants in KLHL20, delineating a novel genetic syndrome with patients having mild to severe intellectual disability, epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Associated clinical features were spasticity, dystonia, strabismus, distal joint laxity, pectus excavatum, scoliosis, kyphosis, vascular anomalies, brachycephaly and subtle dysmorphic facial features. We observed a recurrent de novo missense variant in 11 patients ([NM_014458.4]: c.1069G>A, p.Gly357Arg). All missense variants clustered in the Kelch-type β-propeller domain of the KLHL20 protein, which shapes the substrate binding surface. Protein structure analysis revealed that two out of four missense variants destabilize the interaction of KLHL20 with DAPK1, a substrate associated with upregulated expression in the brain of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy.\n\nConclusion: Our findings implicate KLHL20 in a novel neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability, epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\n\nReferences:\n\nGrants:\n\nConflict of Interest: Yoeri Sleyp: None declared, Irene Valenzuela: None declared, Andrea Accogli: None declared, Katleen Ballon: None declared, Bruria Ben-Zeev: None declared, Sam Berkovic: None declared, Martin Broly: None declared, Patrick Callaerts: None declared, Raymond Caylor: None declared, Perrine Charles: None declared, Nicolas Chatron: None declared, Lior Cohen: None declared, Antonietta Coppola: None declared, Dawn Cordeiro: None declared, Claudia Cuccurullo: None declared, Ivon Cuscó: None declared, Janette diMonda: None declared, Ramon Duran-Romaña: None declared, Nina Ehilevitch: None declared, Paula Fernández-Alvarez: None declared, Chris Gordon: None declared, Bertrand Isidor: None declared, Boris Keren: None declared, Gaetan Lesca: None declared, Jarymke Maljaars: None declared, Saadet Mercimek-Andrews: None declared, Michelle Morrow Employee of GeneDx, Alison Muir: None declared, Frederic Rousseau: None declared, Vincenzo Salpietro: None declared, Ingrid Scheffer: None declared, Rhonda Schnur Employee of GeneDx, Joost Schymkowitz: None declared, Erika Souche: None declared, Jean Steyaert: None declared, Elliot Stolerman: None declared, Jaime Vengoechea: None declared, Dorothée Ville: None declared, Camerun Washington: None declared, Karin Weiss: None declared, Rinat Zaid: None declared, Lynette Sadleir: None declared, Heather Mefford: None declared, Hilde Peeters: None declared.\n\nC01.6 Bi-allelic variants in the neuronal cell adhesion molecule NRCAM lead to a novel neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by developmental delay, hypotonia, peripheral neuropathy or spasticity\n\nAlina Kurolap1;2;3, Florian Kreuder4, Claudia Gonzaga-Jauregui5, Morasha Plesser Duvdevani6;7, Tamar Harel6;7, Luna Tammer8, Baozhong Xin9, Somayeh Bakhtiari10;11, James Rice12, Clare van Eyk13, Jozef Gecz13;14, Jean K.

To date, only L1CAM and NFASC have been associated with neurodevelopmental disease.\n\nMethods: Patient cohort was assembled using GeneMatcher; exome/genome sequencing were used for variant identification. Protein structure analyses and mutant zebrafish studies were performed.\n\nResults: We describe 10 patients (eight families) with bi-allelic variants in the NRCAM, presenting with a neurodevelopmental syndrome of varying severity, characterized by developmental delay/intellectual disability, hypotonia, peripheral neuropathy and/or spasticity. Computational analyses of NRCAM variants, mostly clustering in the third Fn-III domain, strongly suggest a deleterious effect on protein structure and function, potentially hindering its protein-protein interactions. Studies on zebrafish nrcamaΔ mutants, revealed that mutant larvae display significantly altered swimming behavior in darkness compared to wild type larvae (p < 0.03). Moreover, nrcamaΔ larvae displayed a trend towards increased amounts of α-tubulin and 5-HT fibers in the dorsal telencephalon, suggesting an alteration in white matter tracts and projections.\n\nConclusion: Our study provides evidence that bi-allelic NRCAM disruption causes a variable form of a neurodevelopmental disorder, and broadens the knowledge on NRCAM function in nervous system development, as part of the growing role of the CAM superfamily in the CNS.\n\nReferences:\n\nGrants: NHMRC GNT1145048 and GNT1138870 (J.K.); Cerebral Palsy Alliance (J.K., F.K., M.F., M.C.K., and S.B.); State Government of Victoria and Australian Government; NIH 1R01NS106298 (M.C.K.); FWO G049217N (A.J.); NIH U01HG007672 (V.S.).\n\nConflict of Interest: Alina Kurolap: None declared, Florian Kreuder Grant from the Cerebral Palsy Alliance, Claudia Gonzaga-Jauregui Was full-time employee of the Regeneron Genetics Center and received stock options as part of compensation, Was full-time employee of the Regeneron Genetics Center and received stock options as part of compensation, Morasha Plesser Duvdevani: None declared, Tamar Harel: None declared, Luna Tammer: None declared, Baozhong Xin: None declared, Somayeh Bakhtiari Grant from the Cerebral Palsy Alliance, James Rice: None declared, Clare van Eyk: None declared, Jozef Gecz: None declared, Jean K.

This study investigates the frequency of pathogenic germline variants in a large series of unselected RCC patients.\n\nMethods: Whole genome sequencing data on 1,336 RCC cases and 6,214 controls recruited to the UK 100,000 Genomes Project, a nationwide multicentre study, was analysed to identify rare pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) short variants (SNVs and INDELs) and structural variants in 121 cancer susceptibility genes (CSGs).\n\nResults: Among 1,336 RCC participants (mean 61.3 years [±12SD], range 13-88 years; 64% male), 85 participants (6.3%; 95% CI [5.1, 7.8]) had one or more P/LP germline variant in a wider range of CSGs than previously recognised and most patients with pathogenic variants in well-established RCC-CSGs were aged <50 years.\n\nConclusion: Approximately 6% of patients with RCC unselected for family history have a germline variant requiring additional follow-up analysis and possible genetic counselling (including cascade testing). To improve diagnostic yield we suggest expanding the panel of RCC-CSGs tested to include CHEK2 and all SDHx subunits and raising the eligibility criteria for age-based testing.\n\nReferences:\n\nGrants: European Research Council\n\nNational Institute for Health Research\n\nCancer Research UK\n\nThis research was made possible through access to the data and findings generated by the 100,000 Genomes Project; http://www.genomicsengland.co.uk.\n\nConflict of Interest: Bryndis Yngvadottir: None declared, Avgi Andreou: None declared, Laia Bassaganyas: None declared, Alexey Larionov: None declared, Alex J Cornish: None declared, Daniel Chubb: None declared, Charlie N Saunders: None declared, Philip Smith: None declared, Huairen Zhang: None declared, Yasemin Cole: None declared, Genomics England Research Consortium: None declared, James Larkin: None declared, Lisa Browning: None declared, Samra Turajlic Has received speaking fees from Roche, Astra Zeneca, Novartis and Ipsen., Has the following patents filed: Indel mutations as a therapeutic target and predictive biomarker PCTGB2018/051892 and PCTGB2018/051893 and Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma Biomarkers P113326GB., Kevin Litchfield: None declared, Richard S Houlston: None declared, Eamonn R Maher: None declared.\n\nC02.2 Short and long read targeted RNAseq approaches to detect complex abnormalities for cancer susceptibility genes\n\nCamille Aucouturier1;2;3, Olivier Caron4, louise crivelli5, Philippe Denizeau6, Nicolas goardon1;2, Sosthene Barbachou7, Julien Levilly1, Celine Quesnelle7, Imène Chentli2;7, Alexandre Atkinson1;2, Agathe ricou2;7, Flavie boulouard2;7, Laurent Castera2;7, Dominique Vaur2;7, Leman Raphael2;7, Sophie krieger2;3;7\n\n1Centre François Baclesse, Laboratoire de Biologie et de Génétique du Cancer, Caen, France; 2Inserm U1245, Genomic and Personalized Medicine in Cancer and Neurological disorders, Rouen, France; 3Normandy univ, UNICAEN, Caen, France; 4Institut Gustave Roussy, Département Médecine Oncologique, Villejuif, France; 5Centre Eugène Marquis, Service d’Oncogénétique, Rennes, France; 6Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Rennes, Service de génétique clinique, Rennes, France; 1Centre François Baclesse, Laboratoire de Biologie et de Génétique du Cancer, Caen, France\n\nBackground/Objectives: Current molecular diagnostic approaches for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) are based on DNA short read sequencing of exons and flanking regions. These approaches hardly detect complex events nor characterize large genomic deletion/duplication breakpoints. Only 10% of molecular abnormalities are found within families at risk of breast and ovarian cancer. But some variants may be missed in the explored genes by this usual modality. We aim to explore these unexplained inheritances by new RNAseq approaches.\n\nMethods: We selected highly susceptible families with negative or inconclusive DNAseq HBOC panel results. We developed an innovative targeted capture of long read RNAseq analysis. This new analysis was combined with a short read RNAseq assay to explore the expression and splicing profiles of complex molecular alterations. From lymphoblast cells, long read sequencing was performed on an Oxford Nanopore Technologies® platform. The capture probes of our custom panel were designed by Integrated DNA Technologies®. Analyses were performed by a custom bioinformatics pipeline.\n\nResults: Different molecular alterations were characterized in 5 families. Retrotransposon insertions in intron 10 (2 families) and intron 13 (1 family) of BRCA1 were detected. PCR tests were designed to perform genetic counseling. A complex transcript corresponding to an intronic retention combined with an intronic genomic deletion was found in BRCA1 (1 family). Finally, we characterized tandem duplication in BRCA1 exon 8 (1 family).\n\nConclusion: Combined short and long read targeted RNAseq analyses elucidate some unexplained hereditary for highly susceptible families through the identification of complex events. These new methods optimize preventive and therapeutic cares.\n\nReferences:\n\nGrants:\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared.\n\nC02.3 Unveiling the differential disease spectrum in carriers of Pathogenic and Likely Pathogenic germline CTNNA1 variants\n\nSilvana Lobo1;2;2;3, Patrick Benusiglio4;5, Florence Coulet6, Lise Boussemart7, Golmard Lisa8, Isabel Spier9;10, Robert Hüneburg10;11, Stefan Aretz9;10, Liselotte P van Hest12, JUDITH BALMAÑA13, Sigrid Tinschert14, Bryson Katona15, Chrystelle Colas8, Paulo Pereira1;16, Carla Oliveira1;2;17\n\n1i3S – Instituto de Investigação e Inovação em Saúde, Porto, Portugal; 2IPATIMUP – Institute of Molecular Pathology and Immunology of the University of Porto, Porto, Portugal; 3International Doctoral Programme in Molecular and Cellular Biotechnology Applied to Health Sciences (BiotechHealth) from Institute of Biomedical Sciences Abel Salazar (ICBAS), University of Porto, Porto, Portugal; 4Unité fonctionnelle d’Oncogénétique clinique, Département de Génétique, Groupe Hospitalier Pitié-Salpêtrière, AP-HP.

HDGC is mainly caused by CDH1/E-cadherin variants, and by rare CTNNA1/αE-catenin germline variants for which tumour spectrum and variant-type associated causality is unknown.\n\nMethods: We collected clinical data on CTNNA1 germline variant carriers/relatives from ERN-GENTURIS collaborating Institutes, others worldwide, and the literature. We classified variants molecularly/clinically; according to HDGC-criteria; analysed genotype-phenotype associations; and developed a Drosophila melanogaster αE-catenin-knockdown model to study CTNNA1 tissue-specific impairment.\n\nResults: Fifty-two families carried rare CTNNA1 germline variants, 35% Pathogenic (PV) and 37.5% Likely Pathogenic (LPV), all considered truncating variants. Most frequent phenotypes among PV/LPV-carriers were DGC (26%, age-of-onset 43 ± 16), Gastric Cancer of unknown-histotype (GC) (6.3%, age-of-onset 53 ± 16), Breast Cancer of unknown-histotype (BC) (27%, age-of-onset 55 ± 15) and LBC (3.5%, age-of-onset 54 ± 18). Non-classical HDGC cancers had frequencies between 0.7-3.5%. In PV-carriers, DGC and LBC were dominant (respectively 38% and 4.3%), but novel phenotypes coexist in similar frequencies to LBC (e.g. thyroid cancer (3.2%)); while in LPV-carriers, non-classical HDGC phenotypes dominated (BC-62%, melanoma-2.8%). Phenotypes differed significantly between PV and LPV-families (p < 0.00001). Most PV-carrier families fulfilled HDGC criteria (81%), while no LPV-carrier family did. αE-catenin knockdown in Drosophila wing/eye created aggressive phenotypes and comorbidities in adult flies, compatible with a broad disease-spectrum.\n\nConclusion: Early-onset DGC/LBC are recurrent and frequent cancers in CTNNA1 PV-carriers, however, disease spectrum extends beyond HDGC classical phenotypes. CTNNA1 LPV-carriers disease spectrum diverges from classical-HDGC. Current data claims for phenotype-driven CTNNA1-specific variant classification rules, supported by robust in vivo testing models.\n\nReferences:\n\nGrants:\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared.\n\nC02.4 Colorectal cancer risk: the interplay of polygenic background, high-impact monogenic variants, and family history\n\nCarlo Maj1, Emadeldin Hassanin1, Hannah Klinkhammer1;2, Friederike David3, Dheeraj Bobbili4, Rana Aldisi1, Nuria Dueñas5;6, Claudia Perne3;7, Markus M Nöthen3, Robert Hüneburg7;8;9, Peter Krawitz1, Joan Brunet5;6;9;10, Gabriel Capella5;6;9, Patrick May4, Andreas Forstner3;11;12, Andreas Mayr2, Isabel Spier3;7;9, Stefan Aretz3;7;9\n\n1Institute for Genomic Statistics and Bioinformatics, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany; 2Institute for Medical Biometry, Informatics and Epidemiology, Medical Faculty, University Bonn, Bonn, Germany; 3Institute of Human Genetics, Medical Faculty, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany; 4Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine, University of Luxembourg, Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg; 5Catalan Institute of Oncology-IDIBELL, ONCOBELL, Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain; 6Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Cáncer (CIBERONC), Instituto Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain; 7National Center for Hereditary Tumor Syndromes, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany; 8Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany; 9European Reference Network on Genetic Tumour Rsik Syndromes (ERN GENTURIS), Nijmegen, Netherlands; 10Hereditary Cancer Program, Catalan Institute of Oncology-IDBIGI, Girona, Spain; 11Centre for Human Genetics, University of Marburg, Marburg, Germany; 12Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-1), Research Center Jülich, Jülich, Germany\n\nBackground/Objectives: Summarized in polygenic risk scores (PRS), the effect of common genetic variants for colorectal cancer (CRC) can be used for risk stratification.\n\nMethods: To assess the combined impact of the PRS and other main factors on CRC risk, 163,516 individuals from the UK Biobank were stratified according to: carrier status for germline pathogenic variants (PV) in CRC susceptibility genes (APC, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2); low (<20%), intermediate (20-80%), or high (>80%) PRS; and family history (FH) of CRC. Multivariable logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models were applied to compare odds ratios (OR) and to compute lifetime incidences, respectively.\n\nResults: Depending on the PRS, the CRC lifetime incidence for non-carriers ranged between 6% and 22%, compared to 40% and 74% for carriers. A positive FH of CRC was associated with an increase in the cumulative incidence to 26% in non-carriers and 98% in carriers. In non-carriers with a negative FH, but a high PRS, the CRC risk was doubled, whereas a low PRS even in the context of a FH resulted in a decreased risk. The full model including PRS, carrier status, and FH improved the area under the curve for risk prediction (0.704).\n\nConclusion: Irrespective of a sporadic or monogenic background, the CRC risk was strongly influenced by the PRS. FH, PV, and common variants all complementary contributed to CRC risk. The implementation of PRS in routine care would likely improve personalized risk stratification, which will guide tailored preventive surveillance strategies in high, intermediate, and low risk groups.\n\nReferences:\n\nGrants:\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared.\n\nC02.5 Coping with incidental findings in cancer susceptibility genes after exome sequencing in paediatric patients\n\nEstela Carrasco López1;2, Adrià López-Fernández1;2, Marta Codina-Sola3, Sara Torres-Esquius1, Guillermo Villacampa4, Victor Navarro4, Irene Valenzuela3, Belen Perez Dueñas5, Anna Maria Cueto-González3, Orland Diez Gibert1;3, Maite Torres1, Dolors Palau3, Mara Cruellas1;2, Constantino Sábado6, Elena Garcia Arumi3, Eduardo Tizzano3, Lucas Moreno6, JUDITH BALMAÑA1;2\n\n1Vall d’Hebron Institute of Oncology, Hereditary Cancer Genetics Group, Barcelona, Spain; 2Vall d’Hebron Hospital, Medical Oncology Department, Barcelona, Spain; 3Vall d’Hebron Hospital, Department of Clinical and Molecular Genetics, Barcelona, Spain; 4Vall d’Hebron Institute of Oncology, Oncology Data Science (ODysSey) Group, Barcelona, Spain; 5Vall d’Hebron Hospital, Neuropediatrics Department, Barcelona, Spain; 6Vall d’Hebron Hospital, Pediatrics Oncology and Hematology Department, Barcelona, Spain\n\nBackground/Objectives: Exome sequencing may identify pathogenic variants (PV) unrelated with the main purpose of the analysis. We investigated the frequency of secondary and incidental findings (IF) in cancer susceptibility genes (CSG), listed by the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG SF V2), clinical actionability, and psychological impact in families with an IF (cases) compared with families with cancer history and studied with CSG panel (controls).\n\nMethods: We analysed 533 exomes to identify IF. Medical records of all carriers were reviewed. Psychological impact was analysed with MICRA scale 2-6 months after results disclosure. Propensity score weighting method was used to adjust imbalance in prognostic factors in the comparison in cases (n = 32) and controls (n = 576).\n\nResults: IF’s frequency in CSG was 2% (11 index cases): 1.8% from ACMG list, three BRCA2, three PMS2, two SDHB, one BRCA1 and one MLH1; and one in RAD51C (0.2%). Predictive testing was performed in 42 relatives (18 were carriers). Out of 29 carriers, 20 enrolled for surveillance, that yielded a cancer diagnosis in four (20%): paraganglioma in three SDHB carriers, breast cancer in one BRCA2 carrier. Concerning psychological impact, MICRA mean scores in cases and controls were 21.3 versus 16.2 (total), 6.3 versus 4.2 (distress), and 8.3 versus 6.6 (uncertainty), all p < 0.001.\n\nConclusion: PVs in CSG were identified in 2% of patients who underwent exome testing for reasons unrelated to cancer predisposition. The psychological impact was higher when variant was identified as an IF. However, IF allowed early detection and prevention in families without a prior cancer diagnosis.\n\nReferences:\n\nGrants:\n\nConflict of Interest: Estela Carrasco López: None declared, Adrià López-Fernández: None declared, Marta Codina-Sola: None declared, Sara Torres-Esquius: None declared, Guillermo Villacampa GV has received research honoraria for speakers bureau from MSD and Pierre Fabrer and advisory role from Astrazeneca, Victor Navarro: None declared, Irene Valenzuela: None declared, Belen Perez Dueñas: None declared, Anna Maria Cueto-González: None declared, Orland Diez Gibert: None declared, Maite Torres: None declared, Dolors Palau: None declared, Mara Cruellas Rio Ortega Grant.\n\nAECC Grant, Constantino Sábado: None declared, Elena Garcia Arumi: None declared, Eduardo Tizzano: None declared, Lucas Moreno data monitoring committees for clinical trials sponsored by Novartis, Actuate Therapeutics, Shionogi, Incyte, the University of Southampton and the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust; had a consulting role for Novartis, Norgine, Boehringer, Ymabs and Shionogi and participated in educational activities organized by Bayer and Eusa Pharma.\n\ns member of the Executive Committee of SIOPEN (European neuroblastoma research cooperative group), an organisation which receives royalties for the sales of dinutuximab beta.\n\n, My institution receives funding from sponsors for DMC participation, advisory role or conducting industry-sponsored clinical trials., JUDITH BALMAÑA Consultant or advisory board for AZ and Pfizer.\n\nC02.6 Cancer risks by cancer type, gender and PTEN variant type in a large cohort of PTEN Hamartoma Tumour Syndrome patients\n\nLinda Hendricks1, Nicoline Hoogerbrugge1, Arjen Mensenkamp1, Joan Brunet2, Roser Lleuger-Pujol2, Hildegunn Høberg Vetti3, Marianne Tveit Haavind3, Giovanni Innella4, Daniela Turchetti4, Stefan Aretz5;6, Isabel Spier5;6, marc tischkowitz7, Arne Jahn8, Thera Links9, Maran Olderode-Berends10, Ana Blatnik11, Edward Leter12, D Gareth Evans13, Emma Woodward13, Verena Steinke-Lange14, Violetta Christophidou Anastasiadou15, Chrystelle Colas16, Marie-Charlotte Villy16, Patrick Benusiglio17, Anna Gerasimenko17, Valeria Barili18, Maud Brauchaud19, Claude Houdayer19, Bianca Tesi20;21, Emma Tham20;21, Pten Study Group22, Janneke Schuurs-Hoeijmakers1, Janet Vos1\n\n1Dept. of Human Genetics, Radboud university medical center, Nijmegen, Netherlands; 2Hereditary Cancer Program, Catalan Institute of Oncology, ONCOBELL-IDIBELL-IDIBGI-IGTP, CIBERONC, Barcelona, Spain; 3Western Norway Familial Cancer Center, Dept. of Medical Genetics, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway; 4Unit of Medical Genetics, IRCCS Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna, Bologna, Italy; 5Institute of Human Genetics, Medical Faculty, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany; 6Center for Hereditary Tumor Syndromes, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany; 7Dept. of Medical Genetics, National Institute for Health Research Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom; 8Institute for Clinical Genetics, Faculty of Medicine Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universität Dresden, Dresden, Germany; 9Dept. of Endocrinology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands; 10Dept. of Genetics, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands; 11Dept. of Clinical Cancer Genetics, Institute of Oncology Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia; 12Dept. of Clinical Genetics, Maastricht University Medical Center, Maastricht, Netherlands; 13Manchester Centre for Genomic Medicine, St Mary’s Hospital, Division of Evolution and Genomic Sciences, School of Biological Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom; 14Medical Genetics Center, Germany; Arbeitsgruppe Erbliche Gastrointestinale Tumore, Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik IV - Campus Innenstadt, Klinikum der Universität München, Munich, Germany; 15Karaiskakio Foundation, Nicosia Cyprus and Archbishop Makarios III Children’s Hospital, Nicosia, Cyprus; 16Institut Curie, Service de Génétique, Paris, France; 17UF d’oncogénétique Clinique, Dept. de Génétique, Hôspital Pitié-Salpêtrière, AP-HP, Sorbonne Université, Paris, France; 18Medical Genetics, University Hospital of Parma, Parma, Italy; 19Dept. of Genetics, Normandy Center for Genomic and Personalized Medicine, Normandie Univ, UNIROUEN, Inserm U1245 and Rouen University Hospital, Rouen, France; 20Dept. of Clinical Genetics, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden; 21Dept. of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden; 22PTEN Study Group, the Netherlands: Liselotte P. van Hest, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam;, Muriel A.

Verbeek, Radboud university medical center, Nijmegen; Yvette van Ierland, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam; Jacques C. Giltay, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht., Netherlands\n\nBackground/Objectives: PTEN Hamartoma Tumour Syndrome (PHTS) is rare with diverse phenotypes, including increased risks for breast (BC, 67-78% at age 60), endometrial (EC, 19-28%) and thyroid cancer (TC, 6-38%). Current risks are likely overestimated due to ascertainment bias. We aimed to provide more accurate and personalized cancer risks.\n\nMethods: A European, adult PHTS cohort study with data from medical files, registries and/or questionnaires. Cumulative lifetime (CLTRs) and hazard ratios were assessed with Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses, and standardized incidence ratios (SIR) were calculated. Ascertainment bias was addressed by excluding cancer indexes and incident case analyses.\n\nResults: 446 patients were included, 48% indexes, 374 with prospective follow-up years (median 6, IQR:3-10)), 159/278 females and 39/168 males had cancer. CLTRs at age 60 ranged from 68% to 85% for females (95%CI-width: 23% and 25%) and 16% to 37% for males (95%CI-widths: 25% and 62%). Female BC CLTRs ranged from 54% to 73% (95%CI-width: 24% and 30%), with two-to-three-fold increased risks by PTEN variant type and domain. EC CLTRs ranged from 5% to 18% (95%CI-widths: 16% and 25%). TC CLTRs ranged from 9% to 21% (95%CI-widths 10% and 35%). Colorectal, renal cancer and melanoma risks were <10% each.\n\nConclusion: Females have genotype-related BC risks. Highest risks include BC, EC, and TC for females, and TC for males. Risks for colorectal, renal cancer and melanoma should not be an important focus of surveillance. The lower, more accurate and personalized cancer risks from this study provide guidance for optimized risk management.\n\nReferences:\n\nGrants: PTEN Research foundation 17-001\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared.\n\nC03 Cellular differentiation and regulation\n\nC03.1 Mapping the functional impact of immune-associated regulatory elements through single-cell CRISPR-based screens\n\nCelia Alda Catalinas1, Ximena Ibarra-Soria2, Jorge Esparza Gordillo2, Christina Flouri1, Adrian Cortes2, Alison Acevedo3, Gerard Drewes1, Radu Rapiteanu1\n\n1GlaxoSmithKline Research and Development, Functional Genomics, Stevenage, United Kingdom; 2GlaxoSmithKline Research and Development, Human Genetics and Computational Biology, Stevenage, United Kingdom; 3GlaxoSmithKline Research and Development, Human Genetics and Computational Biology, Upper Providence, United States\n\nBackground/Objectives: Drug targets with human genetic evidence are twice as likely to lead to approved drugs. Yet, translating disease-associated genetic variants into functional knowledge remains a fundamental challenge of early drug discovery. GWAS and QTL studies are powerful tools to address these challenges, however, a majority of all disease associated variants cannot be mapped to causal genes by current methods.\n\nMethods: We developed a CRISPR-based, single-cell functional screening approach in primary human CD4+ T cells that enables interrogation of transcriptomic changes induced by modulation of regulatory elements at scale. We first implemented and optimized highly efficient CRISPRi in primary CD4+ T cells, and we showed that these perturbations can be read-out by single-cell transcriptomics using a CROP-seq-based approach. Subsequently, we performed a proof-of-concept pooled screen targeting previously-validated intergenic regulatory elements and transcription start sites (TSSs), profiling approximately 280,000 CD4+ T cell single-cell transcriptomes.\n\nResults: After systematically interrogating different analytical approaches to map regulatory elements to genes (SCEPTRE, Limma-Voom, MAST and Wilcoxon rank sum test), we were able to robustly detect the expected target gene downregulation for >90% of the control TSSs and the expected cis effects for >75% of the intergenic elements perturbed, validating our method.\n\nConclusion: We present a functional genomics approach that enables the generation of enhancer-gene maps at scale in a disease-relevant in vitro mode, opening up exciting new avenues for disease target identification with genetic evidence.\n\nReferences: Gasperini, M. et al.

Mutations far upstream of the SOX9 gene have been identified in patients with isolated Pierre Robin sequence (PRS), a congenital disorder characterised by underdevelopment of the lower jaw (micrognathia). We set out to explore disease mechanisms for PRS, hypothesising that patient mutations may ablate distal-acting regulatory elements such as enhancers.\n\nMethods: We leverage directed differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to cranial neural crest cells (CNCCs), progenitor cells that give rise to the majority of the vertebrate face. Using genome editing in hESCs and mouse we model PRS mutations to explore both impact on SOX9 expression and facial development.\n\nResults: We identify and characterise two enhancer clusters that regulate SOX9 expression over extreme genomic distances (up to 1.45Mb), act during a restricted window of craniofacial development and are conserved in activity down to Coelacanth fish. Mouse models of PRS provide evidence for a novel disease mechanism and demonstrate how small changes in gene dosage can lead to morphological variation. Using imaging-based approaches, we explore dramatic changes in 3D conformation of the SOX9 locus during CNCC differentiation and identify a structural element required for locus topology and robust SOX9 expression.\n\nConclusion: Together, we functionally characterize some of the most extreme long-range regulatory elements implicated in human disease, propose mechanisms driving tissue-specificity in an enhanceropathy, and uncover a role for locus topology in robust gene activation at a human disease locus.\n\nReferences: Long et al, Cell Stem Cell, 2020.\n\nGrants: 106051/Z/14/Z.\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared.\n\nC03.3 Leveraging interindividual variability of regulatory activity refines genetic regulation of gene expression in schizophrenia\n\nMaris Alver1;2, Nikolaos Lykoskoufis1, Anna Ramisch1, Halit Ongen1, Emmanouil Dermitzakis1\n\n1Insitute of Geneva, Department of Genetic Medicine and Development, Genève, Switzerland; 2Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Estonian Genome Center, Tartu, Estonia\n\nBackground/Objectives: Schizophrenia is a heritable and polygenic psychiatric disorder with limited understanding about the mechanistic changes in gene expression regulation.\n\nMethods: To elucidate on this, we integrated interindividual variability of regulatory activity (ChIP-seq for H3K27ac) with gene expression and genotype data captured from the prefrontal cortex of 272 cases and controls.\n\nResults: By systematically measuring interindividual correlation between proximal chromatin peaks, we show that regulatory element activity is structured into 10,936 and 10,376 cis-regulatory domains (CRDs) in cases and controls, respectively, of which 42% are shared. Differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched at differentially active CRDs (Fisher P = 8.72 × 10-6, OR = 1.60). In SCZ cases, at 5% FDR, we discovered in cis 867 and 796 expression QTLs (eQTLs) and CRD activity QTLs (aCRD-QTLs), respectively, of which 130 eQTLs and 40 aCRD-QTLs showed effect only in SCZ. To study the interplay among genetic variants, gene expression and CRDs, we applied Bayesian Networks to infer the most likely causal relationship for QTLs affecting both CRDs and genes. While 2/3 of the studied triplets displayed the same direction of effect from QTL onto gene/CRD in both groups, 1/3 of triplets showed change in directional effect from QTL variant onto gene expression in cases vs controls. These directional change-associated genes cluster in molecular functions related to synaptic function and dendritic spine morphology.\n\nConclusion: We show that accounting for coordinated regulatory activity provides a novel mechanistic approach to reduce the search space for unveiling genetically perturbed regulation of gene expression in schizophrenia.\n\nReferences:\n\nGrants: NCCR 51NF40-158776; ETAg PUTJD901.\n\nConflict of Interest: Maris Alver: None declared, Nikolaos Lykoskoufis: None declared, Anna Ramisch: None declared, Halit Ongen: None declared, Emmanouil Dermitzakis E.T.D is currently an employee of GSK.

Previously reported X chromosome inactivation (XCI) erosion in prolonged hiPSC cultures has raised a concern about their utility to recapitulate trait-relevant sex differences. To assess the utility of hiPSCs in the study of sex effects, we examined the gene expression differences (sex-DE) in male and female lines and estimated the impact of XCI erosion to the inference of sex-DE.\n\nMethods: We examined sex-DE genes using RNA-seq data of hiPSCs generated from fibroblasts of 122 male and 173 female healthy donors from Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Initiative (HipSci). We used allele-specific expression of X chromosome genes and XIST expression levels to identify eroded-XCI. We compared the sex-DE genes in hiPSCs with human tissues using data from GTEx.\n\nResults: Compared to males and normal females, the XCI-eroded female lines (~30%) had increased expression of X chromosome genes and additional effects to autosomal gene expression. Excluding the eroded lines improved the specificity of sex-DE analysis, yielding over 4000 sex-DE genes in hiPSCs. Comparison to postmortem human tissues revealed marked overlap in pattern of sex-DE with the highest resemblance with fibroblasts (~15% shared sex-DE).\n\nConclusion: Our results demonstrate that sex-DE is abundant in hiPSCs including both shared and distinct effects compared to somatic tissues. The closest resemblance in sex-DE was with the cell-type of origin, suggesting potential somatic memory in hiPSCs. Additionally, inclusion of XCI-eroded lines may hamper detection of sex-DE.\n\nReferences:\n\nGrants:\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared.\n\nC03.5 Systematic reconstruction of cellular trajectories across mouse embryogenesis (virtual)\n\nChengxiang Qiu1, Junyue Cao2, Beth Martin1, Tony Li1, Ian C.

Within a few weeks, a single cell zygote gives rise to millions of cells expressing a panoply of molecular programs, including much of the diversity that will subsequently be present in adult tissues. Although intensively studied, a comprehensive delineation of the major cellular trajectories that comprise mammalian development in vivo remains elusive.\n\nMethods: Here we set out to integrate several single cell RNA-seq datasets (scRNA-seq) that collectively span mouse gastrulation and organogenesis. To bridge technologies, these datasets were supplemented with new, intensive profiling of ~150,000 nuclei from a series of E8.5 embryos in 1-somite increments with an improved combinatorial indexing protocol. Overall, we define cell states at each of 19 successive stages spanning E3.5 to E13.5, heuristically connect them to their pseudo-ancestors and pseudo-descendants, and for a subset of stages, deconvolve their approximate spatial distributions.\n\nResults: Despite being constructed through automated procedures, the resulting trajectories of mammalian embryogenesis (TOME) are largely consistent with our contemporary understanding of mammalian development. We leverage TOME to nominate transcription factors (TF) and TF motifs as key regulators of each branch point at which a new cell type emerges. Finally, we apply the same procedures to single cell datasets of zebrafish and frog embryogenesis, and nominate “cell type homologs” based on shared regulators and transcriptional states.\n\nConclusion: We believe that this framing provides a useful entry point for analyses that benefit from a global view of developmental processes.\n\nReferences:\n\nGrants:\n\nConflict of Interest: Chengxiang Qiu The Bonita and David Brewer Fellowship, This work was supported by the Bonita and David Brewer Fellowship to C.Q., Junyue Cao The Rockefeller University, Beth Martin University of Washington, Tony Li: None declared, Ian C.

To understand the underlying upstream regulatory processes, single-cell data offers the unique opportunity to reconstruct personalized co-expression networks. By exploiting the large number of cells per individual, we can identify SNPs altering co-expression patterns (i.e.co-expression QTLs, co-eQTLs) using a limited number of individuals.\n\nMethods: To tackle the large multiple testing burden (SNP-Gene1-Gene2 combinations) associated with a genome-wide analysis, we conducted a co-eQTL meta-analysis across 3 scRNA-seq PBMC datasets (177 participants, 1M cells) with a novel filtering strategy, followed by a permutation-based approach.\n\nResults: Using this strategy, we identified a robust set of cell-type-specific co-eQTLs for 73 independent SNPs, affecting 946 gene pairs. These co-eQTLs provide novel insights into how disease-associated variants alter regulatory networks. For instance, the type I diabetes (T1D) SNP rs1131017 affects the co-expression between RPS26 and other ribosomal genes. Interestingly, the comparison across cell types showed distinct co-eQTLs related to T cell activation specifically within T-lymphocytes, revealing a previously overlooked process that could explain its association with T1D. This example highlights the importance of studying gene regulation at the context-specific level to understand the biological implications of genetic variation.\n\nConclusion: With the expected growth of sc-eQTL datasets, our strategy will soon identify many more co-eQTLs that help elucidate unknown disease mechanisms.\n\nReferences: van der Wijst, Nature Genetics 2018.\n\nOelen, bioRxiv, 2021.\n\nGrants: NWO Veni 192.029 (MW)\n\nHorizon2020 №860895 (MK)\n\nNWO Vici, Oncode Investigator grant (LF).\n\nConflict of Interest: Shuang Li University Medical Center Groningen, Katharina Schimid Helmholtz Center Munich, Dylan de Vries University Medical Center Groningen, Maryna Korshevniuk University Medical Center Groningen, Horizon2020 №860895, Morris Swertz University Medical Center Groningen, NWO VIDI grant number 917.164.455, Harm-Jan Westra University Medical Center Groningen, Monique van der Wijst University Medical Center Groningen, NWO Veni 192.029, Matthias Heinig Helmholtz Center Munich, BMBF computational life science 031L0203A, CZI heart seed network 2019-202666, Lude Franke University Medical Center Groningen, NWO Vici, Oncode Investigator grant.\n\nC04 Unravelling causes and mechanisms of multiple congenital anomalies\n\nC04.1 Solving patients with rare diseases within Telethon Undiagnosed Disease Program through reanalysis of exome-phenome data\n\nManuela Morleo1;2, Annalaura Torella1;2, Michele Pinelli1;3, Carmine Spampanato1, Sandro Banfi1;2, Francesca Romano2, Alfonsina Tirozzi2, Telethon Undiagnosed Disease Program Study Group1, Vincenzo Nigro1;2\n\n1Telethon Institute of Genetics and Medicine (TIGEM), Pozzuoli, Italy; 2University of Campania “Luigi Vanvitelli”, Department of Precision Medicine, Naples, Italy; 3University Federico II, Naples, Italy, Department of Molecular Medicine and Medical Biotechnologies, Naples, Italy\n\nBackground/Objectives: The Telethon Undiagnosed Diseases Program (TUDP) is a national program with the objective of identifying the causes of rare pediatric-onset single-gene disorders. Through whole exome sequencing (WES) in trio, TUDP reaches a genetic diagnosis in 50 percent of a total of 660 families. As the periodic WES variant-level data re-evaluation, and case-level data re-analysis increases the diagnostic yield, due to the constantly expanding of technical developments and scientific understanding, we then re-analyzed the cases that remained undiagnosed within the TUDP.\n\nMethods: Sequencing raw data (FastQ) derived from still-undiagnosed patients and their parents were processed using the VarGenius analysis pipeline1 based upon the updated Genome Analysis Tool-Kit (GATK4.0.5). Furthermore the phenotypic and genomic data sets were processed by the pipeline of the Horizon 2020 Solve-RD project2, and were shared internationally on matchmaker exchange platforms.\n\nResults: We found pathogenic variants in 30% of patients. For 23% of cases, disease-causing variants were identified in genes that were recognized as disease genes while the TUDP study was ongoing. For 40% of cases, pathogenic variants were identified in genes that had never previously been associated with Mendelian diseases.\n\nConclusion: We report the usefulness of periodic re-evaluation and re-interpretation of negative WES data associated with the systematical implementation of the informatic tools and with the updated biological database. Our approach revealed the molecular bases of a significative portion of previously undiagnosed rare diseases patients within TUDP, which lies within already produced data.\n\nReferences: Musacchia F, et al. 2018\n\nZurek B, et al. 2021.\n\nGrants: Telethon Undiagnosed Diseases Program (TUDP, GSP15001).\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared.\n\nC04.2 Genetic and mechanistic dissection of non-muscle actinopathies caused by ACTB or ACTG1 variants\n\nNataliya Di Donato1, Andrew Thom2, Nma Consortium1;3, Michael Seifert4, Johannes Greve5, Insa Kreimer1, Marcus Simon Kropp5, Indra Niehaus1, Matti König1, Manuel Taft5, Michael Heide6;7, Karla Krause1, Evelin Schrock1, Catherine Lawrence8, Neil Roberts9, Sara Cuvertino10, Leo Zeef11, Andrea Meinhardt1, Fernando Santos-Simarro12, Maria Costales13, Juan Cadiñanos14, Ruben Cabanillas14, Bernd Wollnik15, Sabine Hoffjan16, Kamer Tezcan17, Andrew Fry18;19, Daniela Pilz20, Grazia Mancini21, Alain Verloes22, Andreas Rump1, Dietmar Manstein5;23;24, Siddharth Banka3\n\n1University Hospital Dresden, Institute for Clinical Genetics, Dresden, Germany; 2The University of Manchester, Division of Evolution, Infection and Genomics, School of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, Manchester, United Kingdom; 3The University of Manchester, Manchester Centre for Genomic Medicine, Manchester, United Kingdom; 4TU Dresden, Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry (IMB), Carl Gustav Carus Faculty of Medicine, Dresden, Germany; 5Hannover Medical School, Institute for Biophysical Chemistry and Structural Biochemistry, Hannover, Germany; 6MPI-CBG, Dresden, Germany; 7Leibniz Institute for Primate Research, German Primate Center, Göttingen, Germany; 8The University of Manchester, Division of Neuroscience and Experimental Psychology and Lydia Becker Institute of Immunology and Inflammation, Manchester, United Kingdom; 9The University of Manchester, Division of Cell Matrix Biology and Regenerative Medicine, School of Biological Sciences, Manchester, United Kingdom; 10The University of Manchester, Division of Evolution and Genomic Sciences, School of Biological Sciences, Manchester, United Kingdom; 11The University of Manchester, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, Manchester, United Kingdom; 12La Paz University Hospital, Instituto de Genética Médica y Molecular, Madrid, Spain; 13Central University Hospital of Asturias, ORL Department, Oviedo, Spain; 14Instituto de Medicina Oncológica y Molecular de Asturias (IMOMA), Oviedo, Spain; 15University Medical Center Göttingen, Institute of Human Genetics, Göttingen, Germany; 16Ruhr-University, Department of Human Genetics, Bochum, Germany; 17Kaiser Permanente, Department of Genetics, Sacramento, United States; 18University Hospital of Wales, Institute of Medical Genetics, Cardiff, United Kingdom; 19School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Division of Cancer and Genetics, Cardiff, United Kingdom; 20Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, West of Scotland Clinical Genetics Service, Glasgow, United Kingdom; 21ErasmusMC Univ Med Center, Clinical Genetics, Rotterdam, Netherlands; 22Université Paris-Diderot, Department of Genetics, APHP-Robert DEBRE University Hospital, Paris, France; 23Hannover Medical School, Division for Structural Biochemistry, Hannover, Germany; 24Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, RESiST, Cluster of Excellence 2155, Hannover, Germany\n\nBackground/Objectives: ACTB and ACTG1 encode highly conserved cytoskeletal non-muscle actins. Some disorders caused by ACTB/ACTG1 variants have been described, but several remain undefined. Underlying disease-mechanisms are poorly understood.\n\nMethods: We performed clinical data analysis from individuals with (likely) pathogenic ACTB/ACTG1 variants and characterized patient cells, mutant proteins, patient-derived iPSC-based models and mutant mice.\n\nResults: Data from 279 patients collected via 110 members of non-muscle actinopathies consortium showed that ACTB loss-of-function (LOF) variants/gene-deletions cause a syndrome with mild neurodevelopmental"
