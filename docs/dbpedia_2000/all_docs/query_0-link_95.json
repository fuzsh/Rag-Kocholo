The characters in the scenes are a married couple and they have a difficult decision to make. Then we see the aftermath. Spoiler warning if you haven’t read the series yet but intend to. If that’s not an issue, I highly recommend checking the scenes out for learning purposes.\n\nIn case you are totally confused by the strange names and who these people are, Tarmon Gai’don means the Last Battle against the Shadow, an event foretold in a prophecy. Lan is an uncrowned king like Aragorn, except that his whole country was annexed by the Blight (a tainted area) and the monsters living there when he was a baby. He has dedicated his whole life to fighting them. Borderlands like Shienar are the countries at the edge of the Blight and defend their people from the monsters. Nynaeve, his wife, is a sorceress and an Aes Sedai, a Servant of All, who are respected but who most people are wary of. Lan is her Warder, a warrior dedicated to protecting her. He is a man with two causes and that is causing the dilemma.)\n\nStory Revisions: Keeping Track of Changes by Jami Gold\n\nStory Revisions: Keeping Track of Changes\n\nWhen Your Query Reveals a Story-Level Problem by Susan DeFreitas\n\nhttps://www.janefriedman.com/novel-query-problems/\n\nHow to Get an Extra Novel Written In a Year by Janice Hardy\n\nhttp://blog.janicehardy.com/2019/03/how-to-get-extra-novel-written-in-year.html\n\nExploring Three Ways to Structure Your Book Series by Kristen Kieffer\n\nhttps://www.well-storied.com/blog/structure-book-series\n\nFour Ways to Plot a Trilogy by Kristen Kieffer\n\nhttps://www.well-storied.com/blog/4-ways-to-plot-a-trilogy\n\nHow to Write a Trilogy: Q&A Session by Kristen Kieffer\n\nhttps://www.well-storied.com/blog/how-to-write-a-trilogy-qa-session\n\n7 Tips for Collaborating on a Novel by Dan Brotzel, Martin Jenkins, & Alex Woolf\n\nhttp://blog.janicehardy.com/2019/03/7-tips-for-collaborating-on-novel.html\n\nApp Happy: 11 Free (or Mostly Free) Mobile Apps for Writers by Jess Zafarris\n\nApp Happy: 11 Free (or Mostly Free) Mobile Apps for Writers\n\nBook Marketing, Blogging and Social Media\n\nSchmoozing For Introverts: How to Network Like a Pro by Lisa Cooper Ellison\n\nhttps://www.janefriedman.com/schmoozing-for-introverts/\n\nWhat’s More Important: Author Websites or Social Media?

Yes, many different social media are mentioned but that doesn’t mean you need to be on all of them. Choose one that sounds right for you – maybe one you’re already using. Great, stick to that one. But if your audience is on another platform than the one you’re using, consider at least checking that place out. For example if you write YA, younger people are not on Facebook much but many frequent Instagram instead)\n\nAaand then I go against my advice. Goodreads is a place where you should set up your author page even if you wouldn’t use it at all after that. Because a social media specifically created for readers? It would be silly to not have a minimum presence there.

It’s alive!\n\nI’m sorry for neglecting you. Work has been crazy since I shifted departments. Excuses, schmexcuses but I will get bi-weekly steady again.\n\nI’ve been sitting on these links for a while so it’s time to push this baby out into the world. Luckily the best writing advice and good blog posts in general don’t have an expiration date.\n\nBut if you want the freshest writing tips, I recommend you to check out the other link mash-ups in the Collected Wisdom section.\n\nNext Link Feast coming up in two weeks on Sunday. Wrote that down to my calendar even. Or I will when I find it under all the crap 😛 House work hasn’t exactly been steady either.\n\nAnyway, enjoy the links. And please leave a comment 🙂\n\nIf You Have Time For Only One Thing\n\nHow to Create a Three-Phase Writing Ritual by Debra Eve\n\nOn Writing\n\nLearning From the Masters by Gabriela Pereira (the 4 types of books writers should read)\n\n168 Hours: Time and Productivity #1 by Gene Lempp\n\nTime Managament Tip: “Yes Makes Less” by Jenny Hansen\n\nWhat’s on Your “Why To Do It” List? by Carleen Brice\n\nDreaming Big by Sharon Bially\n\n10 Steps to Finding Your Writing Voice by Jeff Goins\n\nWhen Nothing Goes Right, Go Left by Robin LaFevers\n\nFear: The Uninvited Guest by Robin LaFevers\n\nWriting Is Magic by Kristan Hoffman\n\nHow to Be an Author 24/7 by Bill Ferris\n\nFifty Lessons From Fifty Shades of Grey – Part I (Writer Unboxed)\n\nFifty Lessons From Fifty Shades of Grey – Part II (Writer Unboxed)\n\nFifty Lessons From Fifty Shades of Grey – Part III (Writer Unboxed)\n\nDrive, Don’t Chase by Jael McHenry (On following writing trends)\n\nLevels of Conflict by John Vorhaus\n\n4 Big Pitfalls in Story Opening by K.M.
