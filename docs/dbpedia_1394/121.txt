Description

Tau Kappa Epsilon Fraternity's snow sculpture for the 1960 King Kold Karnival. A tall Native American holding a hockey stick with a gopher hanging off of it. The slogan on the roof reads: " A Real Swingin' Gopher." The winter festival known as the King Kold Karnival was a staple at UND from 1951-1968. The event usually included contests, sled races, dances, beauty pageants, and most notably large snow sculptures. A brief resurgence emerged in 1979 but was not continued.
