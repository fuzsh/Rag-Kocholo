        "text": "Friday, August 6\n\nRhizome Receives $430,000 Gift from Rafaël Rozendaal\n\nArtist Rafaël Rozendaal has directed 50 percent of the sales from NFTs of his artwork Endless Nameless (2021) to Rhizome, a New York–based art-and-technology platform. In total, Rozendaal gave 164 Ether—about $430,000—to Rhizome, qualifying it as the largest gift in the organization’s 25-year history. “We’re overwhelmed by Rozendaal’s generosity, along with his vision for a digital art field where artists, platforms, and institutions build the future together,” Rhizome said in a statement.\n\nMassimo De Carlo Now Represents Diane Dal-Pra\n\nFrench artist Diane Dal-Pra is now jointly represented by Galerie Derouillon in Paris and Massimo De Carlo, which maintains spaces in Milan, London, and Hong Kong. Dal-Pra’s large-scale paintings often consider the relationship between individuals and the commodities they collect over the course of their lives, emphasizing the capability for objects to define or subsume their owner. The figures in her work often reference classical statues, further blurring the line between person and possession. She will have her first solo exhibition with Massimo De Carlo in London in March 2022.\n\nThursday, August 5\n\nPace Gallery Now Represents Jules de Balincourt\n\nJules de Balincourt, a painter known for his colorful, enigmatic visions of mythic landscapes, has joined the roster of Pace Gallery, which has locations in New York, London, Hong Kong, Seoul, Geneva, and Palo Alto, as well as temporary spaces in East Hampton and Palm Beach. Pace will share representation with Victoria Miro and Thaddaeus Ropac. De Balincourt’s paintings feature abstract figures amid uncanny versions of public spaces absent time or location—a commentary on the social and political dynamics of an increasingly globalized world. The artist has previously been the subject of solo exhibitions at the Kasseler Kunstverein in Kassel, Germany; the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth in Texas; the Mori Art Museum in Tokyo; and elsewhere. De Balincourt’s new body of work, “New Arrivals,” will debut at Pace’s East Hampton space in August, and the artist’s first solo exhibition with the gallery will take place in Hong Kong in March 2022.\n\nRichard Taittinger Gallery Now Represents Raúl Cordero\n\nRichard Taittinger Gallery in New York has added Cuban painter Raúl Cordero to its roster. Cordero’s work features figurative elements, many of them blurred or abstracted, that are presented alongside pithy phrases or ambiguous sentiments. Through these pieces, the artist interrogates the sometimes fraught relationship between looking and reading. His paintings are held by the Centre Pompidou in Paris, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the Pérez Art Museum Miami. His new installation, Overlook, will be on view in New York’s Times Square next spring.\n\nWednesday, August 4\n\nSpring/Break Art Show to Host Sculpture Exhibition During Upstate Art Weekend\n\nAs part of the Upstate Art Weekend event in New York, the Spring/Break Art Show will host a two-day sculpture exhibition in Poughkeepsie. Staged in collaboration with the River Hill Art Residency, the exhibition, titled “Upstate Immersive,” will be curated by Zahra Sherzad and run from August 28 to 29. Among the artists on tap to participate are Gracelee Lawrence, Icy and Sot, and Phaan Howng. A full artist list is available on Spring/Break’s website.\n\nViennacontemporary Fair Appoints New Director\n\nArtist, writer, and curator Boris Ondreička has been named the director of the art fair Viennacontemporary, which will this year take place September 2–5 in the Austrian capital’s Alte Post. Ondreička is the former director of the Slovakian art initiative tranzit.sk, and since 2012, he has overseen exhibitions at Vienna’s Thyssen-Bornemisza Art Contemporary space. He has also organized exhibitions across Europe, including Manifesta 8, “Being The Future” at the Republic Palace in Berlin, and “Symposion” at the Event in Birmingham.\n\nTuesday, August 3\n\nWhite Cube Now Represents Tunji Adeniyi-Jones\n\nWhite Cube gallery, which maintains spaces in London and Hong Kong, has added British painter Tunji Adeniyi-Jones to its roster. Known for his vivid color palettes and his expressive images of the body, the artist, who is now based in the U.S., draws on West African artistic traditions and mythology to create lush landscapes. Often, they are populated by Black figures who challenge forms of representation in Western painting. He will continue to be represented by Nicelle Beauchene Gallery in New York and Morán Morán gallery in Los Angeles, which will host shows of his work in the spring of next year and the fall of this year, respectively. Adeniyi-Jones’s work has also been featured in shows at 39 Great Jones Street and the Lehman College Art Gallery, both in New York. White Cube will hold its first exhibition of Adeniyi-Jones’s work in London in November; it is set to feature a suite of new paintings and works on paper.\n\nVIA Art Fund, Wagner Foundation Name 2021 Incubator Grantees\n\nThe VIA Art Fund and the Wagner Foundation have named the 2021 winners of their Incubator Grant Fund program, which is intended to recognize institutions facilitating experimental contemporary art programs. The winners this year include the Museum of Contemporary Art Tucson in Arizona, the Santa Fe Art Institute, Stove Works in Chattanooga, Tennessee, the Union for Contemporary Art in Omaha, Nebraska, and Wave Pool in Cincinnati. Each will receive $40,000 over the course of a two-year period.\n\nBaltimore Museum of Art Adds Five New Board Members\n\nThe Baltimore Museum of Art has added five new trustees to its board: actor and collector Michael Ealy; marketing executive Nupur Parekh Flynn; Lori N. Johnson, an associate professor of art history at Morgan State University in Baltimore; collector and philanthropist Anne L. Stone; and filmmaker, artist, and writer John Waters. Clair Zamoiski Segal, the chair of the BMA’s board, said in a statement, “I have no doubt that this new cohort of trustees will enhance the museum’s governance and leadership, and I look forward to sharing their commitment and passion for the BMA’s vision with the rest of the board.”\n\nMonday, August 2"
