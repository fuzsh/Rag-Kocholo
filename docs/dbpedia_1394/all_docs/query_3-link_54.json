        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nMild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a clinical diagnosis defined by objective cognitive impairment, accompanied by concern for cognitive change (voiced by the patient or a knowledgeable informant), with relative preservation of functional independence (Petersen, 2016). Though MCI was initially described as an intermediary state between normal aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) dementia, AD pathology is just one of many processes that can underlie MCI (Petersen, 2016). Other causes of MCI include cerebrovascular disease, psychiatric disease (especially depression), and various non-AD neurodegenerative pathologies, such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Lewy body disease, limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE), hippocampal sclerosis, primary age-related tauopathy (PART), and others (Petersen, 2004, Petersen, 2016, Jicha et al., 2006, Carrière et al., 2009, Pillai et al., 2016, Abner et al., 2017, Nelson et al., 2019). Increasingly, there has been recognition that, even though AD pathology remains among the most common underlying pathologic findings in MCI, the pathology is very often mixed, and a particularly common scenario is the combination of AD pathology and non-AD pathology (Abner et al., 2017). Variations in the types, amounts, and temporal distribution of concomitant non-AD pathologies may account for a great deal of the heterogeneity of MCI (Boyle et al., 2017).\n\nClinicians and researchers are faced with the task of inferring the underlying causes of MCI in individuals. In clinical settings, knowledge of the underlying pathology aids in both treatment and prognostication. Assuring the same underlying pathology is of particular importance in clinical trials that target the molecular pathology of AD. Improvements in in vivo biomarkers have helped with this, but there are several limitations. Hippocampal neurodegeneration on volumetric MRI is a commonly used structural biomarker that suggests the presence of AD pathology but is non-specific (Gordon et al., 2016). Abnormal accumulation of β-amyloid, which can be ascertained by amyloid PET or β-amyloid 1–42 (Aß42) in CSF, is specific for AD pathology, but because amyloid accumulation begins years before clinical symptom onset, it is also a common finding in asymptomatic individuals (Jack et al., 2017). Elevated phosphorylated-tau-181 (p-tau) in CSF and abnormal tau PET scans are difficult to interpret outside of the context of an abnormal β-amyloid biomarker (Jack et al., 2018). None of these commonly used AD biomarkers can confirm or exclude the possibility of concomitant non-AD pathologies. While cerebrovascular disease can be suggested by the presence of chronic lacunar infarcts or white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) on MRI of the brain, most non-AD neurodegenerative pathologies lack reliable biomarkers (Prins and Scheltens, 2015). At this time, it is very challenging to identify specific non-AD neurodegenerative pathologies in living individuals.\n\nThe National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer’s Association (NIA-AA) “A/T/(N)” [β-amyloid/Tau/(Neurodegeneration)] AD research framework is a system for conceptualizing AD biomarkers that may provide an alternative, indirect approach for identifying instances of combined AD and non-AD disease pathology (Jack et al., 2018). In this framework, individuals are classified at each timepoint according to three binary biomarkers: β-amyloid (A+/A-), tau (T+/T-), and neurodegeneration (N+/N-). The expected progression of classical “pure” AD through this biomarker schema is (1) asymptomatic development of amyloid elevation without tau or neurodegeneration [A+T-(N-)], followed, often years later, by (2) pathologic accumulation of tau [A+T+(N-)], and, finally, (3) neuronal injury and neurodegeneration [A+T+(N+)]. Clinical MCI or dementia, per the model, does not occur until all three biomarkers are abnormal. However, biomarker combinations that do not appear in this typical sequence do occur and may be indicative of other processes. For instance, the biomarker combination A+T-(N+) is thought to signify both AD and non-AD pathology. β-Amyloid signifies AD pathologic change, while neurodegeneration in the absence of tau, which is thought to be directly linked to neurodegeneration in AD, suggests a non-AD driver of neuronal injury.\n\nIn this study, we examined a group of individuals with A+T-(N+) MCI (hereafter referred to as “mismatch MCI,” for the mismatch between tau and neurodegeneration) from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) using CSF-based biomarkers for β-amyloid and tau (p-tau) and structural MRI for neurodegeneration. While the A/T/(N) framework does allow the use of CSF total tau (t-tau) as a biomarker for neurodegeneration, CSF t-tau has been found to be highly correlated with CSF p-tau and less sensitive for detection of suspected non-AD pathologies than other markers of neurodegeneration (Cousins et al., 2021); thus, hippocampal volume on structural MRI was instead chosen as the neurodegeneration biomarker in this study. We believe the mismatch group consists of individuals whose cognitive decline and atrophy are driven by concomitant non-AD pathologies rather than their AD pathologic change, which is expected to be in a preclinical state, as it is unlikely to cause symptoms in the absence of neurofibrillary tangle pathology. We compared cross-sectional and longitudinal cognition and imaging characteristics of mismatch MCI to A+T+(N+) MCI, hereafter referred to as “prodromal AD,” to investigate whether mismatch MCI differed from prodromal AD in ways that may be best explained by the presence of concomitant AD and non-AD pathology. We predicted that the mismatch MCI group would be less “AD-like” than the prodromal AD group with regard to baseline cognitive profiles and imaging characteristics, reflecting the hypothesis that non-AD pathology is driving cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration in the absence of tau. Specifically, we hypothesized that mismatch MCI would have less baseline episodic memory impairment and more executive function impairment than prodromal AD, as typical AD usually begins with marked memory loss out of proportion to other domains, while cerebrovascular disease (a particularly common non-AD pathology) typically affects executive function (Mendez et al., 1997). We also compared mismatch MCI to A-T-(N+) MCI (“neurodegeneration-only MCI”), as this group is also thought to have non-AD drivers of neurodegeneration, given the absence of amyloid, and, therefore, might be expected to display similar characteristics. We hypothesized that mismatch MCI and neurodegeneration-only MCI would have similar cognitive profiles at baseline because they likely have comparable underlying pathologies driving neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. For the longitudinal analysis of cognition, we predicted that mismatch MCI would exhibit cognitive decline at rates that were slower than prodromal AD and comparable to neurodegeneration-only MCI. Amyloid-negative cognitively normal (A- CN) participants were included as a control group.\n\nWith regard to neuroimaging, we hypothesized that, at baseline, mismatch MCI would have less cortical thinning in AD signature regions (e.g., posterior parietal lobes) (Dickerson et al., 2009) compared to prodromal AD, and that cortical thinning patterns would be similar between mismatch MCI and neurodegeneration-only MCI. Longitudinally, we hypothesized that mismatch MCI would have slower rates of atrophy in the hippocampus and extrahippocampal medial temporal lobe (MTL) regions compared to prodromal AD and that mismatch MCI and neurodegeneration-only MCI would have comparable rates of atrophy.\n\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Participants\n\nData used in this study were obtained from ADNI (adni.loni.usc.edu). ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public–private partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. For up-to-date information, see www.adni-info.org.\n\nParticipants were recruited at sites throughout the United States and Canada within ADNI during the ADNI-2 and ADNI-GO phases of the study. Baseline ages ranged from 55 to 90 years old. Participants were English- or Spanish-speaking, non-depressed, in good general health, and had baseline diagnoses of cognitively normal (CN), MCI, or AD dementia. Participants with MCI or dementia had a subjective memory complaint (voiced by the subject, the study partner, or the clinician), objective evidence of memory dysfunction (based on the Logical Memory II subscale score from the Weschler Memory Scale – Revised), and a Modified Hachinski Ischemic Score of 4 or less, indicating that a vascular etiology for the cognitive impairment is less likely. Patients with non-amnestic presentations or an existing diagnosis of multi-infarct dementia were excluded from ADNI. All selected participants underwent lumbar puncture for CSF-based AD biomarkers, a venipuncture for ApoE genotyping, structural 3 T MRI, and cognitive testing during the screening and baseline period. See http://adni.loni.usc.edu/ for a full description of the ADNI study protocols.\n\n2.2. Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents\n\nAll participants gave written informed consent per the ADNI-2 (NCT0123197) or ADNI-GO ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT01078636\",\"term_id\":\"NCT01078636\"}}NCT01078636) protocols. Study procedures were approved by each study site’s institutional review board.\n\n2.3. CSF acquisition and processing\n\nParticipants underwent fasting lumbar puncture at baseline and every other year thereafter, as participant willingness allowed. Under sterile conditions, site medical personnel collected from each participant 20 mL of CSF, 2 mL of which was sent to each site’s local lab for routine studies (cell counts, protein, and glucose) and the remainder of which was sent to the Penn AD Biomarker Fluid Bank Laboratory, where assays for Aß42, p-tau, and t-tau were performed (Shaw et al., 2009, Shaw et al., 2011, Bittner et al., 2016).\n\n2.4. A/T/(N) biomarker status determination and group formation\n\nCSF was processed with the Roche Elecsys platform (Blennow et al., 2019). β-amyloid status was determined by a cut-off of Aß42 of 980 picograms (pg) per milliliter (mL) in CSF, such that those below this cutoff were considered positive (A+) and equal to or above were considered negative (A-)(Shaw). Tau status was defined by a cut-off of p-tau of 24 pg/mL, such that above and equal to this cutoff constituted positive (T+) individuals while below were negative (T-)(Shaw; Blennow et al., 2019). Neurodegeneration positivity (N+) was defined as intracranial-volume- and age-adjusted mean hippocampal volume less than or equal to the 90th percentile hippocampal volume of 111 amyloid-positive individuals with a diagnosis of AD dementia (3171 mm3), as has been done in similar analyses (Jack et al., 2012, Wisse et al., 2015). (See section 2.6 for description of volumetric MRI methods.)\n\nUsing these cut-offs, a total of 401 participants with MCI were classified according to A/T/(N) biomarker status, and 176 of them fell into one of the three MCI groups included in the study. The baseline MCI groups consisted of 44 individuals with mismatch MCI (11.0% of total MCI cases), 84 with prodromal AD (20.9% of total MCI cases), and 48 with neurodegeneration-only MCI (12.0% of total MCI cases). Additionally, there were 161 A- CN controls. Membership in the A- CN control group was not restricted by tau or neurodegeneration status. Longitudinal analyses of cognition included everyone in the three MCI groups and the A- CN control group who underwent at least one follow-up neuropsychological battery at 12, 24, 36, or 48 months. These analyses included 43 individuals with mismatch MCI, 77 with prodromal AD, 45 with neurodegeneration-only MCI, and 152 A- CN. The longitudinal imaging analysis included 34 individuals in mismatch MCI, 61 in prodromal AD, 37 in neurodegeneration-only MCI, and 141 in A- CN.\n\nParticipants were kept in their original baseline groups for the longitudinal analyses, regardless of whether their clinical diagnosis or biomarker status changed, as the intention was to compare the trajectory of people with mismatch MCI at baseline to the other groups. Post-hoc analyses were performed to investigate the extent to which participants in the T- MCI groups (mismatch MCI and neurodegeneration MCI) progressed to T + MCI, based on CSF p-tau or tau PET, during follow-up.\n\n2.5. Cognitive assessments\n\nStudy participants underwent psychometric testing at baseline and annually thereafter. Cognitive measures included the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), the Animal Naming Test, and the Trail Making Test to assess memory, language, and executive function, respectively. During the RAVLT, the tester reads aloud a 15-word list to the participant over five consecutive trials. After each trial, the participant repeats back as many of the words as possible (Moradi et al., 2017). After a distraction task, the participant is asked to recall the words, and the number of correct responses is the 5-minute delayed recall score. In this study, immediate memory and episodic memory were assessed using the first trial and 5-minute delayed recall trial, respectively.\n\nThe Animal Naming Test is a test of category fluency (Binetti et al., 1995). Participants are given one minute to name as many animals as they can. The Trail Making Test consists of two parts – Trails A and Trails B. In Trails A, participants “connect the dots” between 25 circled numbers in consecutive order on paper; in Trails B, participants alternate between letters and numbers (1, A, 2, B, 3, C, etc.) (Tombaugh, 2004). The score for each test is the time in seconds for completion. Here, executive function was evaluated by calculating the difference between the completion times for Trails B and Trails A. Subtraction of Trails A time from Trails B time controls for processing speed, and the resulting difference is a more accurate reflection of executive function, than Trails B time alone (Corrigan and Hinkeldey, 1987).\n\nThe Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) were administered to participants as part of their baseline assessment.\n\n2.6. Neuroimaging measures\n\nParticipants underwent structural MRI scans acquired on 3 T scanners at screening, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and annually thereafter. Up-to-date information about MRI imaging protocols can be found at adni.loni.usc.edu/methods/mri-tool/mri-analysis. MRI scans were uploaded to LONI (the Laboratory for Neuroimaging). Quality control was performed by the MRI Core at the Mayo Clinic.\n\nBaseline MTL subregional measures were obtained from baseline MRI scans using automated segmentation from the tailored pipeline, Automatic Segmentation of Hippocampal Subfields-T1 (ASHS-T1) (Yushkevich et al., 2015, Xie et al., 2017, Xie et al., 2019). This pipeline provided volumes of the whole hippocampus, anterior hippocampus, and posterior hippocampus and cortical thickness measures of entorhinal cortex (ERC), Brodmann area 35 (BA35), Brodmann area 36 (BA36), and parahippocampal cortex (PHC). The right- and left-sided volumes and thicknesses were averaged for analyses. An anterior-to-posterior-hippocampal-volume ratio was also calculated, given prior work suggesting that this ratio may be associated with the presence of TDP-43 pathology (de Flores et al., 2020). WMH volumes, which were downloaded from the ADNI website, were quantified via an automated detection method that utilized T1-, T2-, and proton-density weighted MRI images, as previously described (Schwarz et al., 2009, Dadar et al., 2017).\n\nWhole-brain cortical thickness maps were constructed from baseline T1-weighted MRI images using a method based on diffeomorphic registration (Das et al., 2009), which was implemented in the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) Cortical Thickness Pipeline (Tustison et al., 2014, Wolk et al., 2017). Cortical thickness comparison maps were generated to demonstrate areas of significant difference between each MCI group and A- CN and between mismatch MCI and the other two MCI groups. Overlap maps were generated to depict mismatch MCI’s overlap of control-referenced cortical thinning with prodromal AD and neurodegeneration-only MCI, respectively.\n\nThe longitudinal imaging analysis of MTL subregion and WMH volumes included scans that occurred up to 4.5 years from baseline for each participant whose first and last MRI scans were at least 1.2 years apart. The volumes of each region in follow-up scans were estimated using Automatic Longitudinal Hippocampal Atrophy (ALOHA) software, which is an unbiased registration-based longitudinal pipeline (Das et al., 2012).\n\nExploratory analyses using baseline amyloid PET and the first tau PET scan (performed, on average, more than 5 years from baseline, based on the timing of incorporation of tau PET scans into the ADNI protocol) were also pursued using publicly available processed PET data from ADNI that included a composite measure of florbetapir PET and flortaucipir uptake in regions akin to Braak staging (Braak and Braak, 1991, Landau et al., 2015, Schöll et al., 2016). Details regarding image acquisition for florbetapir and flortuacipir PET are available on the ADNI website (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/). An additional group of amyloid-positive cognitively normal individuals (A+ CN, hereafter referred to as “preclinical AD,” with A status defined by CSF criteria, as above) was included in this post-hoc analysis in order to test the hypothesis that the mismatch MCI group and the preclinical AD group would have similar tau burden.\n\n2.7. Statistical analysis\n\nStatistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 26. Mean age at baseline MRI and years of education of mismatch MCI were compared to each of the other three groups using independent samples t-tests. All statistical tests were two-sided, and statistical significance was set at a level of < 0.05. Sex and ApoE4 carrier status (zero ApoE4 alleles versus one or two ApoE4 alleles) were compared between mismatch MCI and each of the three other groups using Pearson chi-square analyses. Median MMSE, GDS, and length of follow-up were compared between mismatch MCI and the other three groups using the Mann-Whitney U-Test for non-parametric analysis.\n\nZ-scores, referenced to baseline performance of 161 A- CN controls, were calculated for each participant’s baseline performance on the RAVLT trial 1, RAVLT 5-minute delayed recall, and the animal naming test as measures of immediate memory, episodic memory, and category fluency, respectively. To quantify executive function, Trails-B-minus-Trails-A time was calculated, and the natural log was taken to provide a more normal distribution, allowing for parametric analyses. Control-referenced Z-scores were calculated for each participant’s natural log Trails-B-minus-Trails-A time, and the negative of this Z-score is reported in order to make the results more easily comparable to the other cognitive domains – i.e., the more negative the Z-score for each cognitive measure, the poorer the performance. Baseline cognition Z-scores were adjusted for age, sex, and education using unstandardized beta coefficients from linear regression analyses of A- CN. Mean adjusted baseline cognition Z-scores are reported for each group. The mean adjusted Z-score for each cognitive domain of mismatch MCI was compared to each of the other three groups using independent-sample t-tests.\n\nMean baseline Aß42, p-tau, and t-tau levels in CSF were compared between mismatch MCI and the three other groups using independent sample t-tests. The mean volumes of the hippocampus, anterior hippocampus, and posterior hippocampus were adjusted for age and intracranial volume using unstandardized beta coefficients from linear regression analysis of 161 A- CN. Mean cortical thickness values for extrahippocampal MTL regions (ERC, BA35, BA36, and PHC) were, similarly, adjusted for age. WMH volume was log-transformed to provide a more normal distribution and adjusted for age and intracranial volume using unstandardized beta coefficients from a linear regression analysis of the 140 A- CN for whom these data were available. The mean values for each of these structural measures and log WMH volume for mismatch MCI were compared to each of the other groups using independent sample t-tests.\n\nCortical thickness maps comparing each MCI group to A- CN and mismatch MCI to each of the other two MCI groups used familywise-error- (FWE)- corrected p-values, based on the Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement (TFCE) method (Smith and Nichols, 2009), with a significance threshold of 0.05, with age, sex, and education as covariates.\n\nLinear mixed-effects models were used to compare rates of change in cognition and longitudinal volumes of anterior and posterior hippocampus, ERC, BA35, BA36, PHC, and log WMH. For the cognitive measures, Z-scores (referenced to baseline performance of 161 A- CN) from all baseline and annual follow-up neuropsychological batteries performed at or before the 48-month visit for each participant were computed. Linear mixed effects models incorporating baseline age, sex, education, baseline unadjusted Z-scores, group, time, and time*group interaction as fixed effects were run for each cognitive domain’s baseline and longitudinal unadjusted Z-scores between all four participant groups to generate graphical representations of the longitudinal change in each cognitive domain. For the longitudinal analysis of volume change in the selected MTL regions, mixed effects models incorporated baseline age, baseline volume, group, time, and time*group interaction as fixed effects. Additional linear mixed-effects models that compared mismatch MCI to each of the other three groups individually were run in order to determine differences in rates of cognitive decline, MTL region volume change, and WMH volume change. For each linear mixed effects model, a random intercept term was included to account for correlations among repeated measures.\n\nThe number of participants in mismatch MCI and neurodegeneration-only MCI who were deemed T+ at 24 and 48 months was compared using Fisher exact tests amongst those who underwent repeat lumbar puncture (LP) at these time points.\n\nTau and amyloid PET mean standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) for mismatch MCI, as well as mean number of years between baseline assessment and tau PET scan, were compared to those of the other participant groups using independent sample t-tests.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nIn this study, we utilized the NIA-AA A/T/(N) research framework (Jack et al., 2018) to compare mismatch MCI [A+T-(N+) MCI] to prodromal AD [A+T+(N+) MCI] on cross-sectional and longitudinal cognition and imaging characteristics with the expectation that mismatch MCI would be less “AD-like” and demonstrate features suggestive of non-AD pathology. This hypothesis was motivated by the notion that neurodegeneration and cognitive decline are driven by tau-based neurofibrillary tangle pathology on the AD continuum. As such, individuals with evidence of neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment in the absence of tau are likely to have a non-AD process effecting these changes, regardless of the presence of β-amyloid. Thus, we also compared mismatch MCI to neurodegeneration-only MCI [A-T-(N+) MCI], which is also thought to result from non-AD pathology.\n\nCompared to prodromal AD, the mismatch MCI group did, indeed, display characteristics that differed from a canonical “AD-like” cognitive profile. In particular, the mismatch group displayed less episodic memory impairment, as measured by verbal recall, but performed similarly on executive function, as measured by the Trail Making Test. Differences in the pattern of cognitive impairment between the mismatch and prodromal AD groups argue against the notion that the mismatch MCI group is simply earlier in the disease process than prodromal AD. Nonetheless, overall cognitive performance of the mismatch group was generally intermediate between prodromal AD and the neurodegeneration-only group. If the assumption is that the cognitive symptoms of the mismatch and neurodegeneration-only groups are primarily driven by non-AD pathology, it is unclear why mismatch MCI was more impaired at baseline. While the β-amyloid in mismatch MCI is thought to be in a preclinical stage (given normal CSF p-tau), its presence may have some bearing on the relative likelihood or distributions of other non-AD pathologies, such as amyloid angiopathy and alpha-synuclein (Swirski et al., 2014, Charidimou et al., 2018, Bassil et al., 2020). Additionally, the neurodegeneration-only group may be relatively enriched in individuals without neurodegenerative pathology, as some individuals with the A-T-(N+) biomarker status may have physiologically small hippocampi and sufficiently impaired cognitive test performance to qualify for an MCI diagnosis in ADNI without actually having a progressive syndrome.\n\nThe longitudinal cognitive data provided a clearer contrast between mismatch MCI and prodromal AD. Across all four cognitive measures, the prodromal AD group displayed greater rates of decline compared to mismatch MCI. The trajectory of the mismatch group was essentially the same as the neurodegeneration-only group, with minimal change over the four-year period. Thus, regarding the rate of decline in longitudinal cognition, the mismatch group appears to be more similar to the neurodegeneration-only group than the prodromal AD group.\n\nThe neuroimaging data also provides insight into potential differences between the groups. While the MCI groups displayed similar degrees of reduced hippocampal volume, the patterns of atrophy along the long axis of the hippocampus differed. The three groups had highly similar anterior hippocampal volumes, but the prodromal AD group had significantly greater posterior hippocampal atrophy compared to mismatch MCI which, in turn, did not differ from neurodegeneration-only MCI. We also found that the anterior-to-posterior-hippocampal-volume ratio was lower in the two T- groups than the prodromal AD group. This finding, while post-hoc, is intriguing, as one potential source of non-AD hippocampal atrophy is TDP-43, or LATE (Nelson et al., 2019). Prior work has suggested that a distinction between the pattern of tau-based neurofibrillary tangle pathology and TDP-43 is that the former has a more uniform atrophy pattern along the long axis of the hippocampus, if not a greater predilection for the posterior hippocampus, while TDP-43 pathology has been associated with relatively greater involvement of the anterior hippocampus (Lladó et al., 2018, Flores et al., 2020). Disproportionate anterior hippocampal involvement, relative to the posterior hippocampus, in the T- groups supports the notion that some proportion of the mismatch and neurodegeneration-only groups may have TDP-43 pathology.\n\nThe mismatch group also displayed elevated WMH burden relative to A- CN at baseline but did not differ from the prodromal AD group. Cerebrovascular disease may be associated with hippocampal atrophy and is another important driver of age-related cognitive decline, particularly in the domain of executive function (Fiford et al., 2017, Wolk et al., 2018, Caillaud et al., 2020, Puzo et al., 2019). The finding that mismatch MCI had a burden of WMHs that was similar to prodromal AD, but significantly greater than that of the neurodegeneration-only MCI group, also may suggest the possibility that some degree of WMH burden in both groups was driven by amyloid angiopathy, a frequent co-occurrence with cerebral amyloid and similar driver of cognitive decline (Greenberg et al., 2020). The presence of β-amyloid may have driven cognitive decline in some portion of the mismatch group, via the mechanism of cerebral amyloid angiopathy or other β-amyloid-related mechanism, particularly in light of the mismatch group’s somewhat disproportionate executive dysfunction relative to episodic memory impairment compared to prodromal AD (Case et al., 2016).\n\nLongitudinal analysis of MTL structures also revealed differences between the MCI groups, such that the mismatch MCI group had slower rates of atrophy than prodromal AD in all selected regions. Conversely, mismatch MCI had faster rates of atrophy than neurodegeneration-only MCI in most selected MTL regions. While it is not clear why the mismatch group would have greater atrophy rates in the absence of tau pathology if neurodegeneration is driven by non-AD pathology in both groups, this finding may suggest that concomitant AD pathophysiology has synergistic effects in the mismatch group or that some portion of the neurodegeneration-only MCI group lacks a neurodegenerative process. Finally, the finding that mismatch MCI had faster atrophy rates compared to controls suggests that the mismatch group had neurodegeneration beyond age-related change.\n\nThe whole-brain analyses demonstrated marked differences between the baseline atrophy patterns of mismatch MCI and prodromal AD, compared to A- CN – specifically that cortical thinning in mismatch MCI was relatively restricted to the MTL while prodromal AD had widespread cortical thinning affecting the temporal, frontal, and parietal lobes, consistent with typical AD signature regions (Dickerson et al., 2009). While these differences could reflect the mismatch MCI group simply being at an earlier phase of the same disease process as prodromal AD, the finding that MTL atrophy rates were slower in the former despite “starting” at the same place in the baseline analysis argues otherwise. The finding that the mismatch MCI map overlaps much more so with neurodegeneration-only MCI map than the prodromal AD map further supports the concept that both the mismatch and neurodegeneration-only groups reflect a non-AD pathologic process.\n\nThe finding that, in some cases, the mismatch group was intermediate between the prodromal AD and neurodegeneration-only groups does raise the possibility that mismatch MCI is simply prodromal AD at an earlier stage, perhaps sampled just before “converting” to tau positivity or reflecting lower levels of tau just below the threshold of our CSF measure. While possible, several factors make this explanation less likely, at least for a significant proportion of the mismatch group.\n\nFirst, of the limited number of the mismatch MCI group who underwent repeat LP, only 2/20 at two years and 0/9 at four years converted to tau-positivity (based on CSF p-tau). While most members of the mismatch MCI group would be expected to become tau-positive eventually, this transition is expected to occur many years after initially becoming β-amyloid-positive and would not explain the cognitive or neurodegeneration status of individuals in the mismatch MCI group during the study period unless the transition to tau-positivity occurred early on. While firm conclusions cannot be drawn based on this limited subset of participants who underwent repeat LP, particularly at 48 months, one would expect that if this group reflected subthreshold tau, a greater percentage would have passed this threshold over this timeframe. Similarly, the tau PET data demonstrates that the mean SUVR in the Braak III/IV region for the mismatch MCI group was below the previously proposed SUVR cut-off for tau positivity an average of five years from baseline. This, too, suggests that most members of the mismatch MCI group at baseline were not on the cusp of becoming tau-positive. Instead, as expected, the mismatch MCI group very closely resembles the preclinical AD group regarding PET-based biomarkers for AD. Interestingly, despite CSF Aß42 levels being essentially the same for the mismatch and prodromal group, amyloid PET at baseline was significantly lower although still in the “positive” range and highly similar to the preclinical AD group. Thus, this group also likely reflects an earlier stage of amyloid deposition than the prodromal group. While sample sizes for both the tau PET data and longitudinal CSF data are limited, these post-hoc analyses are consistent with the mismatch group containing individuals whose AD pathology is on par with a typical preclinical AD stage and thus whose impaired cognition and neurodegeneration are likely due to alternative causes.\n\nSecond, if the cognitive and neurodegenerative status of the mismatch MCI group just reflected “earlier” prodromal AD rather than changes attributable to non-AD pathology, then the mismatch MCI group would be one that lacks resilience, compared to prodromal AD, given symptoms at an earlier pathologic stage of disease. Were this the case, then mismatch MCI would be expected to have faster cognitive decline over time rather than being largely stable. Thus, the presence of alternative non-AD pathology in mismatch MCI remains the best explanation for this group’s characteristics.\n\nThe findings that the mismatch MCI group had a higher percentage of males and a lower rate of ApoE4 carriership compared to prodromal AD are of uncertain significance but do support the notion that there are biological differences between the groups and argue against the idea that mismatch MCI is merely prodromal AD at an earlier stage.\n\nThis study had several limitations. While the overall size of the MCI cohort was reasonably large, the different groups were still modest in size. Additionally, the use of a single neuropsychological test to evaluate each included cognitive domain, a strategy employed to simplify and streamline the analysis, may not fully quantify the true degree of impairment in each domain for each participant. Further, while at a group level the findings have implications for the underlying etiology of cognitive impairment and prognosis, conclusions at a single subject level are difficult to draw. It is certainly possible that some proportion of the mismatch group had early tau pathology below threshold detection that was an important driver of symptoms and progression. That said, the presence of cerebral β-amyloid, even in the presence of neurodegeneration, without evidence of tau pathology is likely to be associated with a more indolent course.\n\nThe lack of pathologic validation with autopsy data limits our ability to draw definitive conclusions regarding the pathologic underpinnings of the biomarker-defined MCI groups. The ADNI MCI cohort, which is restricted to amnestic-predominant cases with low Modified Hachinski Ischemic scores and has limited racial, socioeconomic, and educational diversity, does not represent the full breadth of MCI.\n\nThe A/T/(N) model allows researchers to select from several different methods for defining each of the three binary biomarkers, and, therefore, our choices regarding biomarker selection and cut-offs influenced the composition of the groups and the results. It is possible that selection of a neurodegeneration biomarker that was less specific for AD pathology than hippocampal volume might have led to a more inclusive and larger mismatch MCI group with stronger indicators of non-AD pathologies. Similarly, the exclusion of MCI cases that were non-amnestic or that had elevated Hachinski scores (indicating higher likelihood of a vascular etiology for cognitive symptoms) may also have blunted the strength of the conclusions, as one would expect the excluded MCI cases to fall disproportionately into the mismatch MCI and neurodegeneration-only MCI groups, rather than the prodromal AD group, and potentially contribute to making these T- MCI groups differ more markedly from the prodromal AD group in ways that might have been more strongly suggestive of non-AD pathologies. Further, the exclusion of participants who were likely to have significant cerebrovascular disease restricts the sample and compromises our ability to draw conclusions about the role of cerebrovascular disease as a non-AD pathologic driver in some cases of MCI. These points and the lack of diversity in the ADNI cohort limit the generalizability of the findings."
