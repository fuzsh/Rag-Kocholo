        "text": "Museums\n\nANU Museum of the Jewish People\n\nThe ANU Museum of the Jewish People tells the ongoing and extraordinary story of the Jewish people.\n\nRecently renovated, it offers visitors a variety of cutting-edge features, using original, advanced-technology web apps and audio guides that enhance their experience.\n\nSituated at the heart of the campus, the museum aims to connect Jewish people to their roots and strengthen their personal and collective Jewish identity.\n\nThe Museum opened in 1978 thanks to the vision of Nahum Goldmann, president of the World Jewish Congress 1954-1977. In 2005, the Israeli Knesset passed a law that defines the museum as the National Center for Jewish Communities in Israel and around the World.\n\nOpening hours:\n\nSunday - Wednesday: 10:00 - 17:00\n\nThursdays: 10:00 - 22:00\n\nFridays: 9:00 - 14:00\n\nSaturday: 10:00 - 17:00\n\nSteinhardt Museum of Natural History\n\nThe Steinhardt Museum of Natural History presents Israel’s national treasures of nature, selected from a scientific collection of five and a half million items.\n\nIn its exhibitions, you will see thousands of items gathered through the years, in rare exhibits and displays that tell the story of the natural world around us.\n\nThe mission of the museum is to inspire the acquisition of knowledge, to promote understanding, and to reinforce bonds with nature and our place within it – for the benefit of future generations.\n\nThe museum reveals scientific knowledge from research taking place within the museum itself and unique perspectives in an experiential, multi-sensory, and enjoyable way, creating a special closeness and interaction with nature that cannot be experienced anywhere else.\n\nOpening hours:\n\nMondays: 10:00 - 16:00\n\nTuesdays: 10:00 - 18:00\n\nWednesday: 10:00 - 16:00\n\nThursdays: 10:00 - 18:00\n\nFridays and Holidays: 10:00 - 15:00\n\nSaturdays: 10:00 - 18:00\n\nSundays: CLOSED\n\nGalleries\n\nGenia Schreiber University Art Gallery\n\nThe Genia Schreiber University Art Gallery is a major venue for changing art exhibitions, museum studies and a home for TAU's impressive collection of artworks, including pieces by Marcel Duchamp, Marc Chagall and Michel Kikoine. Situated at the entrance to the campus on the eastern side of Entin Square, the gallery was designed by Dan Eitan and Bracha and Dr. Michael Chyutin. The gallery was conceived as an architectural element that blends with the surrounding landscape and the buildings of the Yolanda and David Katz Faculty of the Arts nearby, making use of the special topographical conditions of the slope of the land. An integral part of this is the Levi and Fortuna Eskenazi Sculpture Garden.\n\nThe gallery mounts exhibitions on selected issues in art history with a focus on modern art, in particular Israeli art. Additional exhibitions explore aspects of architecture, archaeology, literature, theater, philosophy, and photography.\n\nThe gallery comprises a collection of creations by Marcel Duchamp donated by Arturo Schwartz from Italy, lithographs that illustrated the story of the exodus from Egypt by Marc Chagall, donated by Dr. David and Dorothy Levinson from the United States, and a collection of American prints from the 1960s and 70s donated by Viviane Bregman of the United States, all property of the university gallery. The university gallery also houses the Museum Studies Program which trains curators for work in museums.\n\nThe Gallery was founded and headed by the late Prof. Mordechai Omer, a leading trendsetter in Israel's art world and former Curator of the Tel Aviv Museum of Art. The current building, completed in 1988, is a donation of Boris Schreiber of France and the United States.\n\nThe gallery is open to the public free of charge.\n\nOpening hours:\n\nTuesdays, Thursdays: 12:00 - 20:00\n\nWednesdays: 10:00 - 16:00\n\nFridays: 10:00 - 14:00\n\nMichel Kikoïne Art Gallery\n\nThe Michel Kikoïne Art Gallery, houses Tel Aviv University's permanent art collection. It comprises 450 sq meters of exhibition space and 250 sq meters of teaching and research space. The wing is a fitting memorial to Michel Kikoïne (1892-1968), an important painter of the Paris School, whose colorful, nuanced, and lyrical style nourished 20th century artistic development. The facility was dedicated by Kikoïne's daughter, Claire Maratier-Kikoïne of France. She also donated an impressive collection of her father's works for a permanent exhibition. The wing also houses an exhibition of reproductions of self-portraits and portraits of the artists of the Paris School who were friends of Kikoïne, such as Chaim Soutine and Pincus Kremegne, as well as major artists Marc Chagall, Amedeo Modigliani, Sonia Delauney, Hanna Orlof and many others.(Pictured: Michel Kikoine, Portrait of Claire, 1953.)\n\nOpening hours:\n\nTuesdays, Thursdays: 12:00 - 20:00\n\nWednesdays: 10:00 - 16:00\n\nFridays: 10:00 - 14:00\n\nSarita and Noel Wertheim Exhibition Hall (the Sourasky Central Library)\n\nThe Sarita and Noel Wertheim Exhibition Hall in TAU's Sourasky Central Library is a major cultural center on the campus, showing art exhibitions all year round, including international shows sponsored by foreign embassies, as well as expositions of local Israeli contemporary art. The diversity and scope of exhibitions held in the Hall can be demonstrated by the breadth of subjects, ranging from world heritage sites, to the artist Frida Kahlo, to theater arts. Measuring 500 sq meters, the Exhibition Hall also serves as the entrance to the University's library for the humanities and arts, where students can mingle and can admire a huge mural by renowned artist Avraham Ofek, which dominates the entire Hall and is considered one of the University's main art treasures.\n\nOpening hours:"
