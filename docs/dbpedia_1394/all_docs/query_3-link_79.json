        "text": "Tau Lewis (b.1993) was born, lives and works in Toronto, Canada.\n\nLewis will be presenting a newly commisioned installation as part of Yorkshire Sculpture International. Lewisâ€™ self-taught practice works to assuage historical traumas and investigate black identity, agency, memory and its recovery. Her work is constructed through a combination of hand sewing and assemblage of found objects to create portraits, which take on both human and organic forms. The presentation at The Hepworth Wakefield will be her first exhibition in Europe."
