        "text": "NOTES\n\nRivulets of paint flow diagonally downward from the left and right sides of this large painting, framing a wide expanse of raw unpainted canvas. Morris Louis, along with Kenneth Noland (whose work is also on view in this gallery), developed a distinct approach to abstraction known as Color Field painting. Both Louis and Noland adapted Helen Frankenthaler’s method of stain painting; Frankenthaler poured thinned but still vibrant acrylic paints—a medium newly available in the 1950s—directly onto unprimed canvas. In this iconic example of Louis’s most important series, the \"Unfurleds,\" the artist carefully poured his paint, manipulating the canvas to control the gravitational flow of each rivulet."
