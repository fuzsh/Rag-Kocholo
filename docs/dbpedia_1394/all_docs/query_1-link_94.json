        "text": "What's a few hours delay when it's taken six years to get the Tony Smith sculpture to South Orange?\n\nI'm in the Essex County Village of South Orange today watching the installation of the 7.6-ton modular steel sculpture near the duck pond in Meadowlands Park, It is bitter cold and the holes for bolts that connect the bottom section to the base are 1/4-inch off, causing a slight delay as workers drill and paint before lowering the 5,600-pound section onto the base.Despite the set-back, Judy Wukitsch is extactic. Co-founder (with her husband, the late Lennie Pierro) of the town's municipal art gallery, Wukitsch is the driving force behind the effort to bring a Tony Smith sculpture to South Orange. Smith -- renowned teacher, architect, sculptor and painter -- was born, raised, lived and worked in South Orange. To have his massive work installed in the town park is a dream that's six years in the making.\n\nSmith's sculptures can be found in Seattle, Tokyo, Miami, New York City, San Francisco and many other big cities.\n\nUPDATE: The installation took longer than anticipated, and some more work needs to be done tomorrow. So Wukitsch and friends overlooked the white plastic covering that remained in place when they toasted the sculpture Wednesday afternoon. The workers will return Thursday. You can read about the sculpture's journey to South Orange in Friday's Star-Ledger."
