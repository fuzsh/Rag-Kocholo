For the new season, Pratt’s graduate student coordinators invited four contemporary artists to participate in a month-long residency which includes a public lecture, studio visits, and lunchtime discussions. The aim is to provide our students with exposure to a wide array of artists working in a variety of fields at various stages in their careers. The new VALS Fellow format will provide an opportunity for a deeper engagement with our community.\n\nRecent and past visiting artists include: Jeffrey Gibson, Baseera Khan, Abigail D. Deville, Edgar Heap of Birds, Jennie Jieun Lee, Shazia Sikander, Elektra KB, Nina Katchadourian, Wardell Milan, Wendy Red Star, Narcissister, Pradeep Dalal, James Hyde, Schezerade Garcia, Rochelle Feinstein, Lavar Munroe, Lorna Simpson, Rico Gatson, Nicole Eisenman, Tom Sachs, Aura Satz, Leigh Ledare, Judith Bernstein, Dan Walsh, Kalup Linzey, Keltie Ferris, LaToya Ruby Frazier, Trenton Doyle Hancock, Diana Al-Hadid, Rashaad Newsome, Dora + Maja, Nancy Grossman, Michael Berryhill, Wafaa Bilal, and Catherine Opie.\n\nThe Pratt Fine Arts Visiting Artists Lecture Series is made possible by a generous grant from the Robert Lehman Foundation.\n\nFrank WANG Yefeng – 9/19/23\n\nResidency: September 11 – October 6, 2023\n\nFrank WANG Yefeng (b. 1984, Shanghai) is a transdisciplinary artist, researcher, and digital nomad situated in-between New York City and Shanghai. Yefeng earned his MFA in Art and Technology Studies from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 2011. His projects have been featured in exhibitions internationally, including the BRIC Biennial, the OCAT Biennial, the Bangkok Art Biennale, CCS Bard Hessel Museum of Art (NY, USA), Gasworks London (LDN, UK), Pylon Lab (DRS, DE), Hyundai Motorstudio Beijing (BJ, CN), Shanghai K11 Museum (SH, CN), etc. Yefeng has also been awarded solo exhibitions, residencies, and fellowships at K11 Art Foundation (WH, CN), Smack Mellon (NY, USA), International Studio & Curatorial Program (ISCP) (NY, USA), New York Art Residency & Studios (NARS) Foundation (NY, USA), Asia Art Archive in America (NY, USA), MacDowell (NH, USA), and Vermont Studio Center (VT, USA), among others.\n\nMark Thomas Gibson – 10/17/23\n\nResidency: October 16 – November 10, 2023\n\nMark Thomas Gibson’s personal lens on American culture stems from his multifaceted viewpoint as an artist—as a black male, a professor, and an American history buff. These myriad and often colliding perspectives fuel his exploration of contemporary culture through languages of drawing, painting, print, and sculpture revealing a vision of a satirical, dystopian America where every viewer is implicated as a potential character within the story.\n\nMark Thomas Gibson (b. 1980, Miami, FL) received his BFA from The Cooper Union in 2002 and his MFA from Yale School of Art in 2013. He is represented by M+B in Los Angeles and Loyal in Stockholm. In 2016, he co-curated the traveling exhibition Black Pulp! with William Villalongo. Gibson has released two artist books, Some Monsters Loom Large (2016) and Early Retirement (2017).\n\nIn 2021, Gibson was awarded residencies at Yaddo and the Elizabeth Murray Artist Residency. He was awarded a Pew Fellowship from the Pew Center for Arts and Heritage, Philadelphia, PA and a Hodder Fellowship from Lewis Center for the Arts, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ. Gibson was most recently awarded a 2022 Guggenheim Fellowship from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, New York, NY and a Louis Comfort Tiffany Biennial Grant from the Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation, New York, NY.\n\nHis most recent solo exhibitions were at the Lewis Center for the Arts at Princeton University in 2022 and Sikkema Jenkins & Co. in 2023.\n\nTau Lewis – 2/6/24\n\nResidency: January 15 – February 9, 2024\n\nTau Lewis (b. 1993, Toronto Canada) is on exhibition at The 59th Venice Biennale and at 52 Walker, New York, NY. She has exhibited in several museums and institutions, including the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa, ON; MoMA PS1, New York, NY; New Museum, New York, NY; Hepworth Wakefield, Wakefield, UK; College Art Galleries, Saskatoon, SK; Agnes Etherington Art Centre, Kingston, ON; the Art Gallery of Mississauga, Mississauga, ON; and the Art Gallery of York University, Toronto, ON. Lewis’s work has been acquired to the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Library Collection, New York, NY; National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa, ON; Library and Archives Canada, Ottawa, ON; Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami, Miami, FL; The Hammer Museum, Los Angeles, CA; the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, Montreal, Quebec; and Grinnell College Museum of Art, Grinnell, IA. Lewis currently lives and works in Brooklyn, NY.\n\nLewis is represented by Night Gallery, Los Angeles.\n\nAmanda Phingbodhipakkiya – 2/27/24\n\nResidency: February 12 – March 8, 2024\n\nAmanda Phingbodhipakkiya is a Brooklyn-based multidisciplinary artist. Born in Atlanta to Thai and Indonesian immigrants, her practice spans participatory installations, textile, sculpture, large-scale murals, and public art campaigns.\n\nThrough defiant storytelling, her work brings forth textures, histories, and rituals to amplify marginalized voices and creates liminal spaces that heal and transform.\n\nShe is a 2023 Jerome Hill Artist Fellow in Visual Arts and Civic Practice Artist in Residence with Poster House and the San Francisco Asian Art Museum. In 2022, she transformed Lincoln Center’s campus with “GATHER: A series of monuments and rituals” that used ceremony, sound, and large-scale mixed media installations to inscribe new meaning to memory and foster belonging.\n\nAs artist-in-residence with the NYC Commission on Human Rights, Amanda’s art series celebrating the resilience of the AAPI community, “I Still Believe in Our City”, reached millions in New York City and worldwide reclaiming space on billboards, bus shelters, subway tunnels, buildings, at rallies, protests, and on the cover of TIME Magazine.\n\nHer work is held in permanent collections at the Museum of the City of New York, the Goldwell Open Air Museum, the Library of Congress, the Museum of Chinese in America, and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.\n\nIn 2023, she was appointed to the President’s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities where she advises the President on how art can foster community well-being.\n\nShe is currently building a large-scale textile installation in collaboration with the US State Department and textile communities across the US and Thailand that uplifts marginalized voices, celebrates making home and the enduring legacy of matrilineal inheritance, which will be unveiled at the Bangkok Art and Culture Center in 2024."
