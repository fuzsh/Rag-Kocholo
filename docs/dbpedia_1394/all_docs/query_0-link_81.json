Not just for art, but also for clothes, tickets, watching movies and more.” -Ivona Tau\n\nPhotography + Artificial Intelligence\n\nWe hear a lot about NFTs these days. Its virtually impossible to talk about digital art of mainstream art without hearing the term NFT.\n\nPhotography as art has been mainstream since not long after it was invented in the 19th century.\n\nIt has been my honor to blog about artists across the NFT landscape — from painters to photographers, from abstract artists to surreal animators and 3D artists.\n\nBut let’s get somewhere completely new. Most of you haven’t heard of an artist ho mixes AI and photography.\n\nIn this blog, qe interview a very special innovator who is uniting the unlikely worlds of photography and AI. Journey with me in this virtual trip to Eastern Europe to meet a coder photographer who makes some incredible art.\n\nLet’s meet Ivona Tau.\n\nWho is Ivona Tau?"
