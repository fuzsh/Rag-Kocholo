        "text": "Carrying protective plant matter on or close to the body was one way in which medieval people sought to avoid disease. Placed around the neck, this pendant may have contained an herbal compound intended to prevent illness. Its two halves, one of which has a shallow cavity, were designed to fit together snugly. Its shape, a cross in the form of the Greek letter tau, was a symbol of Saint Anthony Abbot, protector of those suffering from the skin diseases commonly and collectively known as \"Saint Anthonyâ€™s Fire\" (or sometimes ignis sacer, \"holy fire\"). The pendant may have been worn by a member of the order of Saint Anthony, which was known for treating these afflictions."
