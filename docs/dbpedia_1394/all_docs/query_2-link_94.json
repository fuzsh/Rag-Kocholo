        "text": "Tau Ceti stands 103 feet tall and is a mural you have to see in person to truly experience it, day or night, as the perceived spectrum changes with the light around it. The gradient color spectrum covers 3,811 square feet of the parking structure at the corner of Second and Brazos streets has become one of the cities most popular murals and must-see landmarks in Austin since its completion in November of 2018. When you get up close it has been known to give feelings of vertigo and dizziness due so be sure to hold on to friend!\n\nWhen you first look at the mural would you believe it was painted entirely by hand? Austin artist Josef Krostofoletti, who is originally from Nagyvarad, Transylvania, created Tau Ceti while suspended by ropes on a scaffold and painted the entire mural by hand from top to bottom with vinyl acrylic paint on concrete. The mural's title comes from a star of the same name in the constellation Cetus (you pronounce it see-tus so that way if you want to show off your new found knowledge you won't have someone correcting you) that has spectrum similar to our own sun.\n\nâ[I used] a color spectrum because, conceptually, it references unity and diversity,â says Austin artist Josef Kristofoletti of his mural Tau Ceti, âAll the colors come from one source and, together, create a complete spectrum of hues.â\n\nTau Ceti was commissioned by City of Austinâs Cultural Arts Division of the Economic Development Department for $76,000 and was created in November of 2018 for the Art in Public Places Program."
