Each Forum has projects, professional reports and, when appropriate, information about proposed legislation with ramifications for educators, women and children’s welfare. DKG has a long relationship with UNICEF and the Committee Teaching About the UN.\n\nThe Society is a philanthropic force on the international scene giving millions of dollars each year in scholarships, grants, and project support. As a member you are a part of that philanthropy. You impact education worldwide!\n\nPublishing\n\nNot only do members receive publications as a part of their membership benefits, but they also are encouraged to submit articles to both. The Delta Kappa Gamma Bulletin Journal is published 3 times a year and Bulletin Collegial Exchange Magazine is published 2 times a year. Members can also write articles for the DKG NEWS and submit artwork (photographs, videos, paintings, etc...) to the Fine Arts Gallery twice a year, once in the fall and once in the spring.\n\nDiscounts\n\nMembership in DKG offers a variety of discounts exclusively for our members. There are discounts in insurances for you and your pets, on hearing aids, rental car expenses, and waived fees at Capella University just to name a few. Additionally, members can shop through Amazon Smile, and Go Ahead Tours.\n\nTravel & Networking\n\nDKG members can experience other cultures by applying for and being selected as an international speaker. Travel costs are paid for by the International Speaker Fund (ISF) and rooming costs are paid for by the host state organization.\n\nAttending an international convention or conference and/or state organization convention affords members with the opportunity to connect with other members both locally and internationally and form life-long bonds as well as the possibility to not only view, but present workshops.\n\nLeadership\n\nEvery DKG member is considered a leader – a woman who wants to make a difference. How you choose to lead is up to you but DKG offers support for that leadership in many ways:\n\nthrough chapter and state organization opportunities;\n\ninternational executive education seminars;\n\nprofessional learning experiences during international conferences and conventions (continuing education units are offered at some of these events and at many state organization meetings.)\n\nthrough sharing of ideas in the DKG Communities and in the Discovery Learning Centre\n\nFinancial Assistance\n\nAs a DKG member, you will find opportunities for scholarships at all levels: international, state organization, and possibly even your chapter. You can also benefit from various DKGIEF grants and should a natural disaster destroy your personal property, the DKG Emergency Fund offers financial assistance in the form of a check for $500.\n\nLEARN MORE"
