        "text": "Summary of Aegean Art: Cycladic, Minoan, and Mycenaean\n\nThe rocky and sun-soaked islands of the Aegean Sea once housed civilizations that produced a wealth of unique, influential, and mysterious artworks and cultural artefacts. Spreading across these islands and even into the southern part of the mainland Greek peninsula before disappearing without a clear explanation, these cultures are remembered by the objects and ruins that have survived and been reclaimed through architectural excavation. Perhaps the best example of these cultures' ongoing appeal and mystery can be seen at the preserved ruins that make up the popular tourist site of Mycenae.\n\nThe extensive cache of art and architectural ruins left behind has been generally divided into three main styles after the societies that successively dominated the region: Cycladic, Minoan, and Mycenaean. Together these cultures both prefigure and diverge from the styles and subjects of Classical Greek Art and have proven to be massively influential on the later development of Western artistic practice, from the aesthetics of Roman Art to the Renaissance, Cubism, and Surrealism. 20th-Century European artists in particular turned to the flat and geometric abstractions of the human form seen in Cycladic art to create new styles and subvert expectations grounded in classical sensibilities and perspectives. These ancient Aegean cultures therefore represent a vital (if often unacknowledged) influence on the direction of artistic expression in Europe.\n\nKey Ideas & Accomplishments\n\nAegean Art is a lesser known but essential precursor to Classical Greek Art, establishing the parameters of visual metaphor that would be developed through the classical period in Greece and Rome. It is only through protracted archeological work that the importance of Aegean Art has become apparent, steadily revealed through the discovery of each new find.\n\nCycladic sculpture has a high degree of abstraction, particularly in its statuary, which proved to be deeply influential to 20th-Century European artists interested in \"primitive\" or \"pre-historical\" art that did not bear the weight of centuries of aesthetic tradition. There is a convincing argument to be made that Aegean Art directly inspired the abstract practice of several hugely important post-war artists, including both Pablo Picasso and Alberto Giacometti.\n\nThe Aegean culture of the Minoans developed \"buon fresco\" or true fresco, where pigments are set into wet plaster rather than painted onto a dry wall. This represents a huge advancement that facilitated the preservation of subsequent wall paintings in later cultures as well as their own, most notably in the Greek and Roman frescoes that are still vibrant today.\n\nArchitecturally, Aegean cultures demonstrated a high level of ambition and innovation. The Mycenaeans created so called beehive tombs, with an interior oblong domed space accomplished through fitted layers of stone, showing an early attempt at the arch-based structural engineering perfected by the Romans over a thousand years later. The development of this architectural form is foundational to the history of European building and ornamentation.\n\nArtworks and Artists of Aegean Art: Cycladic, Minoan, and Mycenaean\n\nBeginnings of Aegean Art: Cycladic, Minoan, and Mycenaean\n\nDefining the Time Period and Geography\n\nThe term 'Aegean Art' encompasses the artworks produced by the cultures that existed in the Aegean Sea during the Bronze Age (approximately 2800-1100 BCE). This rich culture of island communities and the southern mainland therefore predates Classical Greek and Roman Art. Life in the Aegean thrived in the second millennium BCE, although long after major civilization centers was established in Mesopotamia, Egypt, and South Asia - societies who traded with these island cultures. The variety of art coming from this region is generally attributed to three distinct yet related and often intermingling traditions - Cycladic, Minoan, and Mycenaean.\n\nCycladic art (works traced to the Cyclades islands) is the earliest, with most architectural finds dating from c. 3000 - c. 2000 BCE. This is followed by Minoan art, which is found largely on the island of Crete and dates mainly from c. 2000 - c. 1400 BCE. The last great period of Aegean civilization, c. 1400 to 1000 BCE, also encompasses settlements on the Greek mainland that are referred to as Mycenaean or, occasionally, Helladic. This art was influenced by the earlier Minoan work. Overlaps, intermingling, and historical and archeological debates about natural disasters that disrupted and shifted populations make categorical divisions between these three cultures approximate, with indistinct transitions from one dominant society to the next.\n\nCurrently, less is known about the lives of the ancient Aegeans than any other ancient peoples, such as the roughly contemporaneous Egyptians of the New and Middle Kingdoms. It is generally accepted that the Aegean civilization developed through this progression of the three major societies, with artistic remains revealing intermittent threads of continuity in imagery and techniques. Just how many people comprised each society is debated, but evidence demonstrates that some areas were quite populous throughout the era. The population at Knossos, one of several known ancient towns on Crete, has been variably estimated as between 15,000 and 50,000 people, for example.\n\nThe Discovery of Aegean Civilization\n\nHistorians first acknowledged a distinct Aegean civilization's existence after archeological excavations in the later 19th century yielded copious works of art, artifacts, and architectural ruins. These dated mainly from c. 3000 BCE to c. 1000 BCE and provided physical evidence of societies previously known primarily through legend and myth. According to authors Louise Hitchcock and Donald Preziosi, the discovery of ancient Knossos on Crete dates to 1878 when \"...the Cretan antiquarian, Minos Kalokairinos, found the remains of large storage jars on the site of Kephala, several miles south of the modern port city of Herakleion. The find sparked an intense competition to identify and uncover the prehistoric city of Knossos\". This was accomplished by British archeologist Sir Arthur Evans in 1900.\n\nEvans understood the importance of his work on Crete, not only for the practice of archeology and subsequent work on ancient sites, but for the modern world, as research that would shape the mental attitude of [his] own and future generations in \"many departments of knowledge.\" As author Philip Betancourt states, \"the art of the Aegean Bronze Age is an important chapter in the early expression of ideas through visual metaphors. [...] The arts flourished, and the examples that survive into modern times present us with images in many media - monumental wall paintings, stone architecture at large scale, elite objects of gold, silver, and other metals, interesting sculptures, and thousands of fine small pieces in many styles.\" The tripartite division of Aegean civilization and its art has also facilitated the focused study of this breadth and abundance of artistic material.\n\nGerman archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann also played a key role in proving that some of the mythical cities described in the epics of Homer were in fact real places. Schliemann's excavations at Mycenae on the mainland uncovered what author Fred Kleiner describes as startling finds, \"among them a massive fortress-palace with an imposing gateway and a circle of royal graves; other tombs featuring lofty stone domes beneath earthen mounds; quantities of gold jewelry, drinking cups, and masks; and inlaid bronze weapons.\" These finds indicated a society far older than art of the Classical era suggested. Much of what is known of the Aegean civilization today dates back to these excavations, including how its art is discussed and documented.\n\nConcepts and Styles\n\nCycladic Art: Early Statues\n\nThe earliest examples of Aegean Art come from among a group of 220 islands known as the Cyclades. The subgrouping \"Cycladic art\" relates to the art made by the inhabitants of these islands, who are understood to have been a nomadic people throughout the third millennium. According to author Philip Betancourt, \"the portable art of the Early Cycladic period consists largely of small objects that could be carried easily if a community moved. The architecture is not very monumental, the tombs are small, and except for the substantial fortification walls, only modest amounts of labor were invested in objects intended for visual communication or for permanent display.\"\n\nThis Cycladic mode of artistic production is typified through simplified anthropomorphic stone statuary. While the purpose of these objects remains a mystery, more than a thousand have been found. Historians and archeologists suggest that it is likely that they had burial and votive functions.\n\nThe basic forms of these statues are rendered in clean and flat geometric shapes. Clearly, it was important to the artists to delineate gender, done so with breast protrusions and genital outlines on the figures, most of whom are female and depicted with straight legs and bent arms resting across their stomachs. The few extant male examples sometimes have more complicated poses and attributes like belts or musical instruments. Many have retained traces of pigment, suggesting that other details were originally added with paint.\n\nWhilst statuary is the most emblematic Cycladic art form, pottery was also produced by the nomadic population. According to Betancourt, this earliest pottery, \"...was all handmade (rather than made on a potter's wheel). Bowls, jars, and other simple shapes served utilitarian functions, while a few more specialized shapes like the bottle were developed for specific purposes. [...] Oil, perhaps perfumed, is the most likely possibility for the contents, which were shipped to many places [...].\" In addition to functional objects, some pieces of pottery were discovered in what are believed to be ancient tombs, suggesting a funerary function or ritual object for use by the deceased. One of the most interesting examples of this type of object is a flat piece that resembles a frying pan.\n\nMinoan Art: Pottery, Architecture, and Wall Painting\n\nPottery of the Minoan period was more advanced than that seen in Cycladic contexts, due in large part to the development and use of a potter's wheel and kiln firing techniques. Not only were these Minoan vessels more elaborately formed with greater variety in shape, but also more highly decorated with polychrome schemes. An early Minoan type known as Kamares ware, \"named for the cave on the slope of Mount Ida where they were first discovered,\" according to Fred Kleiner, \"have been found in quantity at Phaistos and Knossos. Some examples come from as far away as Egypt and testify to the expansive trade network of the Minoans.\"\n\nDecoration on Minoan pottery was rich and varied. Kamares ware generally featured highly abstract patterns, with strong color contrasts between light and dark. Surrounded as they were by water on the island of Crete and the nearby smaller outposts they established as their culture expanded, the Minoans were deeply inspired by aquatic life. Designs featuring sea creatures, frequently the octopus and the dolphin, gave rise to an alternative description of this work as \"Marine Style\". A later decorative motif is known as the \"Palace Style\", in which, according to authors Debby Sneed and Summer Trentin, \"... the earlier decorative motifs of plants, flowers, and sea life are arranged symmetrically and in a greatly stylized manner.\" All of these decorative types were popular in Minoan trade, judging from the dispersed archeological finds across the islands of the Aegean and beyond.\n\nFrom an architectural perspective, the grandest period of Aegean civilization arguably took place on Crete during the Minoan period. Rather than the remains of simple homes found on the Cyclades from this period, excavators on Crete uncovered large architectural complexes. It is generally believed a large fire destroyed similar earlier structures in 1700 BCE, after which an extensive building campaign was launched by the Minoans, resulting in newly elaborate structures. The remains of these structures survive to today, and can be seen at their excavation sites, many of which have become popular tourist destinations. According to author Fred Kleiner, \"Although conventionally called palaces, the rebuilt structures may not have served as royal residences. They were administrative, commercial, and religious centers with courtyards for pageants, ceremonies and games, and dozens of offices, shrines, and storerooms for the collection and distribution of produce and goods. These huge complexes were the centers of Minoan life. The principal 'palaces' on Crete are at Knossos, Phaistos, Malia, Kato Zakro, and Khania.\"\n\nThe elaborate layouts of Minoan palaces evidence advanced engineering skills and detailed aesthetic ambitions. At Knossos, widely considered to be the home of King Minos (a major figure in Homer's tales), the intricate and maze-like floor plan suggests the labyrinth of the man-eating Minotaur beast, whom the hero Theseus kills to win the hand of the king's daughter in Greek mythology.\n\nMore than simply proof of masterful architectural skills, these palace complexes indicate the refined aesthetics sensibilities of the Minoans, as they are filled with beautifully rendered frescoes and mural paintings. According to Kleiner, \"the paintings depict many aspects of Minoan life (bull-leaping [generally believed to have been a popular Aegean sport], processions, and ceremonies) and of nature (birds, animals, flowers, and marine life).\" The rich detail displayed in these murals as well as the focus on movement and naturalism specifically found in Minoan landscape scenes marked a sharp contrast to the more rigid, formally rendered art of the Ancient Egyptians. Egyptian art did make it to the Aegean to some degree however, as its influence has been identified in some floral patterning and color conventions. But unlike the Egyptians, who used a dry fresco technique of painting directly onto the walls of their tombs, the Minoans invented a new technique known as wet fresco or \"buon fresco\", in which the artists painted onto a wall that had been first treated with a wet lime plaster. The results were better preserved as the pigment dried within the plaster. This technique has allowed for the remains of Aegean wall paintings to still be seen today.\n\nMycenaean Art: Architecture, Metal Work, and Terracotta Figures\n\nThe Mycenaeans, the third culture usually grouped under the term âAegean Artâ, flourished during the middle to late years of the Aegean Bronze Age, were indigenous Greeks inhabiting mainland Greece centuries before the Classical Greek civilization (as we understand it today) emerged. The Mycenaeans, an advanced people with their own culture and extensive trade practice, also showed some influence from the Minoans. Whilst for years direct ancestral links between the cultures of the Aegean had been assumed but not conclusively demonstrated, recent genetic, linguistic, and archeological work has confirmed that the Minoans and Mycenaeans are closely related to both ancient and contemporary Greeks.\n\nMycenaeans are best remembered today for the treasures found buried amongst the remains at Mycenae, the most extensive of several known Mycenaean citadels or town centers.\n\nMycenaean architecture is sometimes referred to as Cyclopean, after the giant Cyclops of Greek mythology, for its massive stone construction. One monumental form is the beehive-shaped tomb, which was constructed largely of ashlar masonry (cut stone) and sometimes covered in earth to appear as a natural mound. Notable is its dome-like interior ceiling span. This was achieved through the technique of corbeling, or raising a series of gradually sloping fitted stone courses, a technique which predates the arch technology that would define later styles of European architecture.\n\nThe largest of these tombs, found outside the Mycenae citadel, is widely known as the Treasury of Atreus, a legendary Mycenaean king. While this tomb was looted before a record of what was inside could be documented, excavations led by Henrich Schliemann uncovered large underground shafts now known as \"Grave Circles\" inside the citadel that yielded spectacular finds. Believed to be burial places for Mycenaean kings and their relatives, the graves contained a wealth of artworks buried with the bodies which provided historians with insights into the makeup and culture of the society they came from. As authors Louise Hitchcock and Donald Preziosi have noted, \"the scale of the wealth displayed in the shaft graves at Mycenae, and the power of the warrior classes for whom such objects were made, had no immediate precursors in Greece, and the growth of regional centres such as Mycenae heralds an entirely new age in the Aegean.\"\n\nAmong the treasures found in the shaft graves were funerary masks, which were the cause of some debate when Schliemann attributed one to Agamemnon, the legendary son and successor of Atreus. This is a theory which has since been disproved. As author Fred Kleiner explains, \"no one knows whether the Mycenaean masks were intended as portraits, but the artists took care to record different physical types. The masks found in Grave Circle A portray youthful faces as well as mature ones.\"\n\nOther items found in these shaft graves include highly decorative gold and metal cups, jewelry, and weaponry, all of which highlight the Mycenaeans' skill in metallurgy. This included a mastery of repoussÃ©, the hammering of forms from the back side of a metal sheet to create a sculptural relief, with details later refined from the front using other techniques. According to author Philp Betancourt, \"the sophisticated Mycenaean economic and political system led to increasing affluence among the elite members of the society,\" an affluence to which these burial objects attest.\n\nWhile the increasing wealth and power of the Mycenaean people allowed for larger sculptures to be made than in earlier Aegean societies, the most abundant works of art found in their graves and tombs were small figurative sculptures.\n\nMycenaean grave statuettes, while harking back to the simplified carved Cycladic figures of the Early Bronze Age, are generally terracotta, clay fired in kilns, and less geometric. They also frequently display better preserved painted details. Many share the gesture of upraised arms that was first seen in the \"goddess\" statues of the Minoan period. There are so many of these Mycenaean figures that, as author J. Porter explains, \"they are categorized into three main types, based on the gestures of their arms and were named by their resemblance to the letters of the Greek alphabet: tau, phi, and psi. The tau figurines fold their arms into their chest, the phi figurines clasp their hands in their stomach, and the psi figurines raise their hands.\"\n\nAs with most Aegean artworks, the purpose for the production of these Mycenaean sculptures can only be hypothesized. According to Porter, researchers have suggested that they may be representations of goddesses for votive function, or toy-like objects for children, as many have been found in children's tombs. They may have had uses in both life and death, in light of the varied find spots and evidence that some were purposely broken and discarded.\n\nLater Developments and Legacy\n\nThere is no clear historical record that accounts for the end of Aegean civilization, nor what historical links may exist between this end and the start of a later recognizably Greek civilization. Some proposed theories include one or several environmental disasters such as volcanic eruption or invading groups that decimated the population. In fact, art of the region has offered some clues to support the theory that the Aegeans faced several threats around the late second millennium BCE.\n\nAs authors Louise Hitchcock and Donald Preziosi have proposed, extensive trade that flaunted the wealth of the Mycenaeans \"may have invited piracy by renegade warriors [...] as recounted in the annals of the Hittites. Or, as the Mycenean cities fell to mercenary insiders and bands of rustic marauders from both northern Greece and central Europe, their inhabitants might, in turn, have been encouraged to flee their homes.\" Certainly, imposing architectural structures such as the Lion Gate and connected large walls surrounding the citadel at Mycenae were designed to make invasion difficult, suggesting the threat of attacks, especially when viewed alongside the warrior imagery on some late Mycenaean pottery.\n\nLegacy of Aegean Art\n\nAncient Aegean art had a profound impact on the subsequent development of artistic imagery and techniques, an influence that can be seen even in contemporary times. Regarding its primary impact on the art of Classical Greece and Rome, according to author Philip Betancourt, \"... without its long centuries of experimentation and innovation, those traditions would surely have traveled other paths.\"\n\nCuriously, not all elements of Aegean art were copied by later artists. As Betancourt states, \"...some of the Aegean Bronze Age art is surprisingly different - even shockingly different - from what came later. The rich culture we call Minoan [...] presents us with experiences that are foreign to Classical Greek and Roman ideas [...] and some of the Minoan images use concepts that are also quite alien to the ones that guided many other traditions of this part of the world.\" This uniqueness underpins the importance of Aegean Art as a period, both in its own right and as a precursor to other better-known and documented periods. As Betancourt continues, it first \"stands at the beginning of a long later history that can neither be understood nor appreciated without at least a passing acquaintance with its first chapter. Second, Cycladic, Minoan, and Mycenaean visual communication is important for its own sake. It presents some ideas in ways that have not been explored in the same fashion anywhere else, either before or since.\"\n\nOne of the most prominent legacies of the Aegeans is the development of new artmaking techniques, techniques that often emerged from day-to-day life within the island cultures. Their advancements include the use of a potter's wheel and kiln that would later become fundamental to the expansive enterprise of Ancient Greek pottery. Also, the buon fresco technique was adopted and used to great effect by future generations of artists, especially notable in Italian Renaissance art, epitomized by Michelangelo's work on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel (1508-12). It remained in use to the modern era, reaching another high point in post-revolutionary Mexico, when Diego Rivera and others refurbished public buildings with extensive mural projects.\n\nThe influence of the Aegeans on Classical Greek architecture was also significant. The grand scale and copious decoration at Minoan and Mycenaean sites was echoed and furthered in Greek temple construction in particular. In addition, the Aegean interest in the human figure, which, while simplistically rendered, can be seen from early Cycladic art through the end of Aegean civilization, laid the foundation for the focus on figuration in Greek art. Likewise the original polychrome of at least some Aegean sculpture and some nature-based design elements of Minoan wall and pottery painting can be seen in some of the decorative friezes featured on Greek temples.\n\nBeyond the direct influence that Aegean art had on Classical Greek culture, which eventually re-settled the Aegean islands, and by extension the Romans who were heavily influenced by the Greeks, Cycladic art, specifically, has impacted many modern artists. As author Julia Fiore states, \"...the avant-garde retinue - Hans Arp, Constantin BrÃ¢ncuÈi, Amedeo Modigliani, Henry Moore, Alexander Archipenko, Pablo Picasso, Jacob Epstein, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, Alberto Giacometti, Jacques Lipchitz, and Isamu Noguchi, among others\" partook in a \"... craze for these elegant, prehistoric artifacts around the turn of the century\" as part of a catch-all, emerging notion of Primitivism that included non-European as well as other early European art to mark an emphatic break from enduring realist art traditions spawned from Classical Greece. This can be seen perhaps most prominently in the angular, flatly rendered heads and elongated faces of Amedeo Modigliani's subjects in painting and sculpture. Further, according to Fiore, \"the presumed fertility function of many Cycladic artifacts [...] inhabits the sensual sculptures of Hans Arp or Alexander Archipenko, albeit in a secular, rather than religious sense.\" Even Pablo Picasso, while heavily influenced by African art, echoes Cycladic form in his early Cubist geometry as well as work of his later \"classical period.\" And the Minoan bull iconography is echoed in many of Picasso's works that featured the mythic minotaur.\n\nUseful Resources on Aegean Art: Cycladic, Minoan, and Mycenaean"
