        "text": "This raises the question: What is a great art Master? A great #artmaster is one that at such venerable age is capable of generating a succinct yet powerful statement such as #Serra ‘s one: ‘the virtual denies tactility’; and by doing so gives way to a #counter narrative on the positive impact of #AI #VR and the likes on the realm of art. As #richardserra puts it, the #virtual kills the full character of art as an #arsthetic #experience ; because, in order for the aesthetic experience to exist, one needs all the senses to be activated by art, including the tactile one. Listen to Serra for a better understanding of what a #visionary and a #master in the field of art is about!!\n\nWhether it’s the towering size of the sculptures or their fantastical subjects like witches and sea monsters, it’s hard to find a visitor at Grounds for Sculpture without a smile on their face. This sprawling art park in Hamilton Township is unlike any you’ve ever been to. There is a theme park quality to the experience and that is not meant to diminish the importance of the works found within. The park has somehow managed to make art-viewing a family-friendly activity. One reason why young people respond to the sculptures is because it’s one of the rare places where you can get right up close to them, touch them, and in some cases, such as Roberto Lugo’s Put Yourself in the Picture, climb on top of them. Everything you might need — food, snacks, coffee, even cocktails — is found here, making it easy to take your time. It is the sort of place that rewards exploration. Not all the artworks are found along the walking paths. Some are in little clearings or down side-alleys and other works can only be spied while looking in unexpected places. Grounds for Sculpture is easily accessible via public transportation. Take the Northeast Corridor train from Newark Penn Station to Hamilton Station (one stop after Princeton Junction). Right outside the station hall on the northbound side is a bus stop for #608. From there, it’s a five-minute bus ride to the park. #groundsforsculpture #hamiltontownship #ratsrestaurant\n\nbelindapiggott_article If you haven’t managed a visit, this is the last weekend to visit Hidden Rookwood 2023 where you can see the first work by our collaboration, Entangled. You’ll find this in one of the oldest parts is the cemetery, along with the thought provoking work of other artists. Below is our statement … “This is a living sculpture. Suspended mid-air, between life and death, is a bed of mycelium, the thread like root structure of mushrooms. Normally hidden underground where it decomposes organic matter, we’ve elevated it to propose an alternative to traditional burial methods. Recently developed, mycelium coffins accelerate the process of decomposition. They sequester, rather than produce, CO2. Rather than leach toxins into the soil, mycelium burials release nutrients. Working with nature we can embrace the cycle of life to offer a dignified solution to an environmental challenge, one that supports biodiversity and transforms the cemetery into an urban forest.” HIDDEN Rookwood Sculptures is an annual outdoor sculpture exhibition taking place amongst the pathways and gardens in one of the oldest sections of Rookwood Cemetery, on Dharug Land. HIDDEN 2023 exhibition: 21 October - 19 November 2023 Open sunrise to sunset Free entry https://lnkd.in/gmhhRSsi @hiddeninrookwood\n\nOn relation to the Urban Sculpture Project is very important that Sponsors Patrons Local goverments Foundations Public Institutions Private Institutions Sculpture Parks And anyone who can make possible to place sculptures outdoors get involve t-minus this project, because if not it will never will get to see the light. The importance and the values are on the table to be studied and modified if necessary, but the collaboration and maybe the direction from the groups mentioned above is indispensable. In these difficult times culture should be out on the streets and outdoor sculptures are the elements that all cultures have used through centuries to show their real potential, and the engagement of institutions is vital to succeed. #cristiandiez #minimalmood #brutalism #artepovera #tabakalera #rationalism #sculpture #modernsculptor #artcardboard #skultur #scultore #urbansculpture #esculturacontemporanea #escultura #escultor #artistportfoliomagazine #sculpteur #skulpturen #sculpteur #urbansculptures #urbansculptureart #urbanartwork #urbanartworks ©️ Cristian Diez-Sanchez\n\nMy most recent paintings are an extension of my sculpture series and focus on how new cultures and narratives are born through the urban environments we create. To live in a city is to constantly navigate geometry in the form of buildings, vehicles, street signs, manhole cover lids, and so on. How does this affect us? Does it change our way of thinking? Do we eventually merge with the city? How does it affect our relationship with the natural world? And how does the natural world interact with the urban environment?"
