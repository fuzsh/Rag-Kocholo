        "text": "Join artist Tau Lewis in conversation with Hammer Museum curator Erin Christovale about her work.\n\nTau Lewis employs arduous methods such as hand sewing, carving, and assemblage to build intricate sculptural portraits and quilts. A self-taught artist, her practice is rooted in healing personal, collective, and historical traumas through labour. The materiality of Lewisâ€™ work is often informed by her surrounding environment: she constructs out of found, gathered, and recycled materials from Toronto, New York, and outside of her family's home in Negril, Jamaica. Lewis will be included in 2021 exhibitions at the Hammer Museum, the Grinnell College Museum of Art; Prospect 5, New Orleans; Haus der Kunst, Munich; and the National Gallery of Canada. She has exhibited at museums including Oakville Galleries, the Hepworth Wakefield, UK; and College Art Galleries, Saskatoon. She has also exhibited in artist-run spaces including Mercer Union, Toronto; Plug-In Institute of Contemporary Art, Winnipeg; Gallery 44, Toronto; and 8-11, Toronto and galleries such as Cooper Cole, Toronto; Night Gallery, Los Angeles; and Jeffrey Stark, New York. Lewis lives and works in Brooklyn."
