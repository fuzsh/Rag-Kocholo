Lewis makes hand-stitched, sculptural portraits and quilts composed of upcycled materials sourced from Toronto, New York, and Negril, Jamaica, locations with personal meaning. The works “reference individuals within her immediate community as well as imagined ancestors; they are ‘celestial bodies’ or talismans who act as spiritual conduits between the past, present and future.” She was featured in “Threadbare,” a group exhibition at Stephen Friedman earlier this year. Her solo exhibition “Tau Lewis: Symphony” is on view at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, through Sept. 26. Lewis lives in Brooklyn, N.Y.\n\nAwards & Honors\n\nHOUSING gallery received The Armory Show’s 2021 Gramercy International Prize.
