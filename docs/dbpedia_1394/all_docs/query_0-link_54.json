        "text": "b. 1993, Toronto\n\nLiving in Toronto\n\nVenue\n\nOgden Museum of Southern Art\n\n925 Camp Street, New Orleans, LA 70130\n\nMonday–Sunday, 10 AM–5 PM\n\nNeighborhood\n\nDowntown/Central Business District (CBD)\n\nAbout the project\n\nTau Lewis focuses on the potential of birth and rebirth of objects and individuals. Created during the pandemic, utilizing reused and recycled fabrics, the works on view imagine life protected by environments infused with love and compassion.\n\nSurrounded by hand-sewn garlands of flowering buds, her quilted sculpture, Delight—a seated, outreaching figure—is part of a series of soft sculptures that make up T.A.U.B.I.S., the Triumphant Alliance of Ubiquitous Blossoms of Incarnate Souls. Invented by Lewis, T.A.U.B.I.S. is the name of both an alternate realm and the beings who inhabit it. In T.A.U.B.I.S., each hand-dyed blossom represents a soul who has lived to the best of their ability—they communicate and collect intel and offer guidance and foresight, and sometimes song and dance. The figure in Delight is one of several non-gendered maternal forms that—through intuitive nurturing, wisdom, and connection to the terrain—supports all life.\n\nOn both sides of the gallery hang Lewis’s tapestries that are talismans imbued with powers of protection and healing. Each quilted tapestry features and is named after a Ghanaian Adinkra symbol—ancient symbols that encompass West African concepts and worldviews and appear throughout the African diaspora, visible for instance in the wrought-iron works of New Orleans. Lewis’s utilization of Adinkra symbols points to the persistent presence of African peoples and cultures. They are used—as in the blossoms that surround Delight—to encase and protect the symmetrical fetuses unfolding at the center of the work. These wall-based works investigate the cyclical nature of life and the potential to rest in the certainty (and uncertainty) of our continued existence.\n\nPresented by the Blue Rider Group and the Deborah Buck Foundation.\n\nabout the artist\n\nTau Lewis is a self-taught multimedia artist who primarily works with textiles, carving, and assemblage of found objects. Her intention in her use of recycled and found materials is to invoke the necessity of such practices in various cultures and contexts. There is a therapeutic and cathartic element to her work in that it references past personal and collective traumas and acknowledges the restorative power of labor. She also often references her heritage and recounts real and imagined ancestral histories. In 2018 Lewis was awarded Frieze New York’s Frame Stand Prize for her solo presentation with Toronto’s Cooper Cole Gallery. Recent and upcoming solo and group exhibitions of Lewis’s work have been hosted by, among others, The Hammer, Los Angeles; Oakville Galleries, Oakville, Ontario; The Hepworth Wakefield, UK; New Museum of Contemporary Art, New York; MoMA PS1, New York; Atlanta Contemporary Art Center; Plug In Institute of Contemporary Art, Winnipeg; and the Agnes Etherington Art Centre, Kingston, Ontario. Lewis’s work can be found in the collections of the National Gallery of Canada Library and Archives, Ottawa, and the Grinnell College Museum of Art, Iowa."
