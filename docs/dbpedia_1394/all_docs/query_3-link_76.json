        "text": "On View presents images from noteworthy exhibitions\n\nFOUND AND RECYCLED TEXTILES are at the heart of Tau Lewis‘s practice. She makes labor-intensive sculptural portraits constructed with hand-sewing, quilting, and assemblage techniques. Her work explores memory, agency, and individual and collective trauma and healing. For example, recent works have considered the legacy of loss borne of the Middle Passage and what she terms “water as black geography.” For her latest body of work, on view at Oakville Galleries in Gairloch Gardens, Lewis employs imaginative myth making. She evokes outer space, envisioning an “ancestral otherworld” where the possibilities of blackness are unbound.\n\nToronto-based Lewis is participating in Prospect.5 New Orleans in November. A self-described, self-taught artist, she presented her first solo show outside North America at the 2019 Yorkshire Sculpture International at The Hepworth Wakefield in West Yorkshire, UK. In December, Cooper Cole Gallery featured a solo exhibition of her work at Art Basel Miami Beach.
