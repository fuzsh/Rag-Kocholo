Symptoms eventually grow severe enough to interfere with daily tasks.\n\nSubscribe to E-News to learn how you can help those affected by Alzheimer's.\n\nUnderstanding Alzheimer's and dementia\n\nAlzheimer's is the most common cause of dementia, a general term for memory loss and other cognitive abilities serious enough to interfere with daily life. Alzheimer's disease accounts for 60-80% of dementia cases.\n\nLearn more: What is the Difference Between Dementia and Alzheimer's?, What is Dementia, Research and Progress\n\nAlzheimer's is not a normal part of aging. The greatest known risk factor is increasing age, and the majority of people with Alzheimer's are 65 and older. Alzheimer’s disease is considered to be younger-onset Alzheimer’s if it affects a person under 65. Younger-onset can also be referred to as early-onset Alzheimer’s. People with younger-onset Alzheimer’s can be in the early, middle or late stage of the disease.\n\nLearn more: Younger/Early-Onset Alzheimer's, Risk Factors\n\n​\n\nAlzheimer's worsens over time. Alzheimer's is a progressive disease, where dementia symptoms gradually worsen over a number of years. In its early stages, memory loss is mild, but with late-stage Alzheimer's, individuals lose the ability to carry on a conversation and respond to their environment. On average, a person with Alzheimer's lives 4 to 8 years after diagnosis but can live as long as 20 years, depending on other factors.\n\nLearn more: 10 Warning Signs, Stages of Alzheimer's Disease\n\nAlzheimer's has no cure, but three treatments — aducanumab (Aduhelm®), donanemab (Kisunla™) and lecanemab (Leqembi®) — demonstrate that removing beta-amyloid, one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease, from the brain reduces cognitive and functional decline in people living with early Alzheimer’s. (Aducanumab will be discontinued on Nov. 1, 2024. Please connect with your provider on treatment options.) Other treatments can temporarily slow the worsening of dementia symptoms and improve quality of life for those with Alzheimer's and their caregivers. Today, there is a worldwide effort underway to find better ways to treat the disease, delay its onset and prevent it from developing.\n\nLearn more: Treatments, Treatment Horizon, Prevention, Clinical Trials\n\nSymptoms of Alzheimer's\n\nThe most common early symptom of Alzheimer's is difficulty remembering newly learned information.\n\nJust like the rest of our bodies, our brains change as we age. Most of us eventually notice some slowed thinking and occasional problems with remembering certain things. However, serious memory loss, confusion and other major changes in the way our minds work may be a sign that brain cells are failing.\n\nAlzheimer's changes typically begin in the part of the brain that affects learning. As Alzheimer's advances through the brain it leads to increasingly severe symptoms, including disorientation, mood and behavior changes; deepening confusion about events, time and place; unfounded suspicions about family, friends and professional caregivers; more serious memory loss and behavior changes; and difficulty speaking, swallowing and walking.\n\nPeople with memory loss or other possible signs of Alzheimer’s may find it hard to recognize they have a problem. Signs of dementia may be more obvious to family members or friends. Anyone experiencing dementia-like symptoms should see a doctor as soon as possible. If you need assistance finding a doctor with experience evaluating memory problems, your local Alzheimer's Association can help. Earlier diagnosis and intervention methods are improving dramatically, and treatment options and sources of support can improve quality of life. Two helpful support resources you can tap into are ALZConnected, our message boards and online social networking community, and Alzheimer's Navigator, a web tool that creates customized action plans, based on answers you provide through short, online surveys.\n\nTake our free, online education courses: Understanding Alzheimer's and Dementia and Know the 10 Signs: Early Detection Matters\n\nAlzheimer's and the brain\n\nMicroscopic changes in the brain begin long before the first signs of memory loss.\n\nThe brain has 100 billion nerve cells (neurons). Each nerve cell connects with many others to form communication networks. Groups of nerve cells have special jobs. Some are involved in thinking, learning and remembering. Others help us see, hear and smell.\n\nTo do their work, brain cells operate like tiny factories. They receive supplies, generate energy, construct equipment and get rid of waste. Cells also process and store information and communicate with other cells. Keeping everything running requires coordination as well as large amounts of fuel and oxygen.\n\nScientists believe Alzheimer's disease prevents parts of a cell's factory from running well. They are not sure where the trouble starts. But just like a real factory, backups and breakdowns in one system cause problems in other areas. As damage spreads, cells lose their ability to do their jobs and, eventually die, causing irreversible changes in the brain.\n\nThe role of plaques and tangles\n\nTwo abnormal structures called plaques and tangles are prime suspects in damaging and killing nerve cells.\n\nPlaques are deposits of a protein fragment called beta-amyloid (BAY-tuh AM-uh-loyd) that build up in the spaces between nerve cells.\n\nTangles are twisted fibers of another protein called tau (rhymes with “wow”) that build up inside cells.\n\nThough autopsy studies show that most people develop some plaques and tangles as they age, those with Alzheimer’s tend to develop far more and in a predictable pattern, beginning in the areas important for memory before spreading to other regions.\n\nScientists do not know exactly what role plaques and tangles play in Alzheimer's disease. Most experts believe they somehow play a critical role in blocking communication among nerve cells and disrupting processes that cells need to survive.\n\nIt's the destruction and death of nerve cells that causes memory failure, personality changes, problems carrying out daily activities and other symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nLearn More: Take the Brain Tour\n\nResearch and progress"
