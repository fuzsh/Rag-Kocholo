        "text": "A’ja Wilson just shared a video of her attempting to do Megan Thee Stallion‘s viral “Mamushi” TikTok dance, and let’s just say it wasn’t exactly a slam dunk.\n\nIn the clip posted to her Instagram Story on Tuesday, the 27-year-old Olympic athlete and her Las Vegas Aces teammate Sydney Colson try out the choreography in what appears to be a hotel room. For the most part, Wilson gets the timing of the hand gestures right but seems a little unsure before giving up in a fit of laughter. Meanwhile, her fellow hooper messes up the pace of the movements almost immediately, so she starts improvising her own dance.\n\n“tik tok bloopers are gems lmaoooo,” Wilson captioned the clip, also wishing Colson a happy birthday.\n\nIt appears that the video was filmed back in early July, when Wilson posted a different video of the pair trying out the dance in the same room and outfits. “Day One of trynna learn the Watashi Wa stahh dance w/ @sydcolson Soooo How’d we do @Megan Thee Stallion ??,” she wrote at the time.\n\nNowadays, the WNBA star is much busier leading the Team USA women’s basketball team in the 2024 Olympics. Over the weekend, the ladies beat out Germany 87-68 in the group phase; at press time, the American ballers are winning against Nigeria in their quarterfinals game. Semifinals will take place Aug. 9, while the bronze and gold medal games will go down two days later.\n\nWatch Wilson and Colson do MTS’ “Mamushi” dance below."
