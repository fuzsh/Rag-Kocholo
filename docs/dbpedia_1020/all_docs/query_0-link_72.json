When Nina Simone heard that four Black girls had been killed in the bombing of the 16th Avenue Church in Birmingham, Alabama, her first impulse was to try and build a zip gun; instead she channeled her rage into “Mississippi Goddamn,” the song that marked the emergence of Nina Simone, the Civil Rights activist. Infused with traditional hymns along with songs including “Four Women,” “I Loves You, Porgy,” and “Young, Gifted and Black,” Nina Simone: Four Women looks at an artist and the women around her as their journey leads them down a path of discovery and healing.\n\nSEEKING:\n\nNINA SIMONE (30) - A.K.A. “Peaches”. Timeless. A woman of dark skin and temperament that cloaks wounds both present and historical. Bach and the Blues infuse her life. She is a tornado...of vulnerability. Complexity is her complexion and resistance and rebellion her anthem. She should boast the agility of improvisation on the keys and the polyvocality of a herald. She should be able to hear a song only once and be able to not only perform it, but to lift the song to another level of being. She lives hard and loves the same. She has a high school education, but possesses well-rounded music training both self-taught and by private music teachers. Whatever her mood swings they should never be so pronounced to upstage her accomplishments. She should possess the attributes of a modern-day prophet.\n\nSARAH (40s) - A.K.A. “Auntie”. Also of dark skin. Her hands are rough. Molded from years of working in the white folks home since she was yea high. Groomed to put others before herself. This type of welding has created the invisible woman that she has become. Her smile is inviting never letting on that trouble lives on her horizon. Her dark skin has determined how she will be treated by the outside world. Her life has been defined by black and its volatile relationship to white. She has a remedial education at best as she comes from a large family where everyone had to work and carry their weight. She possesses the tender shoulder you can cry on and a honeysuckled voice of pain. She doesn’t sing the blues, but has lived it.\n\nSEPHRONIA (30s-40s) - Her skin is yellow. She is of a softer disposition because that is what her hair type and skin color warrant. She’s never been dark enough to cause offense, but she’s just light enough to offend herself at times. She’s the painful reminder that she is a child of violence. She’s not light enough to be white nor dark enough to be black leading to an inescapable purgatory. She’s joined the Civil Rights Movement hoping this will make her black enough and create an acceptance. Her mother doesn’t understand her and her father’s disowned her. Her mother holds her accountable for why she wasn’t able to find a man of her own. She’s opened her heart to many men who’ve made her empty promises. She is a D minor key, the saddest of them all.\n\nSWEET THING (Late 20s) - Her skin is tan. She’s enticing whether she wants to be or whether she’s paid to be. She’s been tossed to and fro by life and the blows that it’s delivered by the men that have come and gone from her life. She’s lived on the streets for quite some time and been in and out of trouble most of her life. She’s a pistol, but has still never gotten what she really wants—love. She is the kind of woman that will steal your man when you’re not looking. Her looks have been the bane of her existence since she was a little girl.\n\nSAM WAYMON / MUSICIAN (20s) - Nina’s younger brother. Plays piano, Hammond B-3 Organ, and tambourine. Stays out of Nina’s way.\n\nLITTLE WOMEN\n\nby Louisa May Alcott, adapted by Heather Chrisler | Director: Jackson Gay\n\nFirst Rehearsal: January 30, 2025\n\nPerformance Dates: February 25- March 23, 2025 (potential ext. March 30, 2025)\n\nWilson Stage, LORT B\n\nSynopsis: Louisa May Alcott’s classic novel comes to fresh life in this inventive, theatrical adaptation which follows as the March sisters – Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy – gather in the family attic. From making up fairy stories, writing for their pretend newspaper, and playing make believe, they graduate to scenes of love, loss, and – for Jo – artistic self-discovery, as they come of age against the backdrop of the American Civil War.\n\nSEEKING:\n\nLITTLE WOMAN 1: Jo\n\nLITTLE WOMAN 2: Meg, Professor Bhaer\n\nLITTLE WOMAN 3: Amy, John Brooke\n\nLITTLE WOMAN 4: Beth, Laurie\n\nPURE NATIVE\n\nby Vickie Ramirez (Tuscarora) | Director: Randy Reinholz (Choctaw) | In Association with Friends of Ganondagan and Native Voices\n\nFirst Rehearsal: March 20, 2025\n\nPerformance Dates: April 15-May 11, 2025\n\nWilson Stage, LORT B\n\nSynopsis: Brewster’s back after almost a decade and things have changed. Brews is proud of his success working for a large corporation, and wants to share it with the people of his Rez in Upstate New York. After all, it’s been a bad year, and Brews believes partnering with his corporation on a new bottled water factory would be a great opportunity for the Rez to create its own industry and sustain itself. But to his old love Connie, it’s a betrayal of everything the Haudenosaunee stand for. Who will win?\n\nNOTE: We encourage Native Americans, First Nations, Alaska Natives, or Hawaiian Natives actors to apply.
