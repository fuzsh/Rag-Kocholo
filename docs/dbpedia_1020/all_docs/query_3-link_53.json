        "text": "Paradise Earned\n\nThe Armed Forces Recreation Centers (AFRC) Resorts serve members of the U.S. Armed Forces, their families, and other authorized users. The AFRCs are Category C Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) activities operated by the U.S. Army as executive agent for the Department of Defense (DOD). Army Installation Management Command (IMCOM) G9 directly manages the AFRCs to provide all uniformed services with high-quality, affordable resort-style facilities consistent with the Army's focus on readiness and quality of life for Service Members and their Families. Personnel eligible to use AFRC guestrooms, food and beverage, recreation, facilities, and other guest services are defined below.\n\nDISABLED VETERANS EQUAL ACCESS ACT 2018\n\nIn January 2020 we received new Department of Defense/Army Regulations which expand authorized use at AFRC Resorts to Purple Heart recipients, former prisoners of war (POW), veterans with VA-documented service-connected disability ratings and Primary Family Caregivers of eligible Veterans under the VA Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers.\n\nThis expanded authorization currently does not include the Edelweiss Lodge and Resort. The new law is subject to the limitations of applicable host nation law and unresolved international agreements. If policy changes, we will update our website and social media pages.\n\nBelow are the guidelines for the new authorized users at Dragon Hill Lodge, Hale Koa Hotel and the Shades of Green Resort:\n\nVeterans who are Purple Heart recipients, veterans who are former POWs, all veterans with VA-documented service-connected disability ratings, and individuals assessed, approved, and designated as the Primary Family Caregivers of eligible veterans under the VA Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers are eligible Shades of Green Resort users when identified as follows:\n\nVeterans must present a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) indicating at least one of the three acceptable eligibility statuses (PURPLE HEART, FORMER POW, or SERVICE CONNECTED); or HEC form H623A indicating placement in VA health care priority group 8E paired with an acceptable credential like a REAL ID-compliant State driver’s license or a U.S. passport.\n\nNote: VHICs are issued to veterans enrolled in VA health care. Visit: https://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/vhic/ for information regarding eligibility for the VHIC and the application process.\n\nPrimary Family Caregivers must present their letter from the VA Office of Community Care that indicates they are assessed, approved, and designated Primary Family Caregiver of an eligible Veteran under the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers and are eligible for these privileges paired with an acceptable credential like a REAL ID-compliant state driver’s license or a U.S. passport.\n\nRestrictions apply for Disney’s Military Promotional Salute Tickets and Universal Orlando’s Military Promotional Ticket offerings."
