        "text": "I am curious yalls opinion on this. Are the marginal stat improvements with higher ranked soldiers worth the grind compared to a spaded lower rank group?\n\nExample;\n\nAxis Normandy Assaulters rank 1, I have them fully spaded with all troops max trained and with the best kit. Running this squad, I can rack up some serious score. Compared to Assaulters rank 3, the grind is significantly longer to get spaded, and using the stock squad albeit with good equipment, usually ends with slight to moderate score.\n\nIt really depends…\n\nTier 2 and 3 cost a TON more bronze to lvl and access the same perks.\n\nThe ONLY difference is the class starting perk, which is different for every soldier “tier”, AND the fact that more stats points = a slightly better %. (Example a very high green point count means a bit more stamina pool)\n\nThe only real necessary tier 2 is the flame guy, for his health perk, which combined with the 16 points health perk transforms him into a fire devil.\n\nLook at the Perk Points, if you are Happy with them You need no Tier3 .\n\nPerfectionism looks like this…\n\n75%faster Revive 8 Green Points\n\n30% more Life 16 Red Points\n\n12% faster Reload 8 Yellow Points\n\nAdditional theres more Worthfull Things.\n\nImportant are the Starter Perk Points.\n\nBuy 5 Assaulter and compare them, when You get lets say 5, Tier3Rank2 Soldiers look who of them have the most Points and pick him.\n\nYou can look in the Right Corner by Perks, which Perks are availible and how much they cost.\n\nOh yeah about that, some soldiers are not worth wasting bronze on.\n\nAs a rule of thumb:\n\nTier 1 soldiers have +3 bonus stats points\n\nTier 2 soldiers have +6 bonus stats points\n\nTier 3 soldiers, 9.\n\nIt’s important to know all soldiers come with random starting stats, and the minimum and maximum starting stats are the same for ALL soldiers class, only the bonus points change them.\n\nA “perfect” 2 star soldier will have 6/6/6 as base stats WITHOUT the bonuses. (So a perfect tier 1 rifleman will have 7/7/7, thanks to his +1 to all stats)\n\nThe worst stats at 2 stars are 4/4/4. Without bonuses. So if you draw a rifleman and he has 5/5/5, trash him immediately, Don’t even waste a single bronze order, he’s got the worst starting stats and as such won’t be able to use best perks at 5 stars.\n\nYes. Even without academy, starting stats will differ. To calculate what real starting stats your soldier have, subtract the bonus (and minuses) the class gives, you’ll then have the base stats values.\n\nHere’s the perfect stats of all star lvls, for ALL soldiers of ALL classes and ALL tiers (tiers only give more bonuses stats)\n\n1 star: 4/4/4\n\n2 stars 6/6/6\n\n3 stars 8/8/8\n\n4 stars 10/10/10\n\n5 stars 16/16/16\n\nKnow that EACH lvl up will ALWAYS give the same amount of points, which is +6 stats, divided in 3 between lvls EXEPT the 4 to 5 stars giving +18 to stats divided in 3. Those points will never exceed the perfect point charts I listed up. Know that a 3/4/4 soldier could end up 16/16/15 however.\n\nYou can predict what stats your 2 star soldier will have when 5 stars, using the chart up. If a rifleman 2 stars have 7/7/7, you know as a certainty he will be able to obtain ANY perk later, as HE WILL be 17/17/17 at max stars.\n\nBut yeah, obtaining good starting stats soldiers cost a lot of silver…\n\nNot all soldiers classes need max stars however. A rifleman does not need 17 in weapon handling, as the fast firing perk with bolt actions only cost 12 points.\n\nSame for assaulters, he only need 14 in weapon handling for vertical recoil. Exept for Kiraly users, you need 16… the recoil is crazy with it."
