        "text": "Legendary comedian and actor Steve Martin is acknowledging the chatter that he should join NBC’s Saturday Night Live to play Kamala Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. “I just learned that Tim Walz wants to go on the road with Marty Short,” Martin quipped on Threads Tuesday. The tour Martin refers to is the one he and fellow funnyman Martin Short do on the road called “The Dukes of Funny Town!” Impersonation buzz began last week when it was announced that Maya Rudolph would return to SNL to impersonate the vice president. Soon after Walz was put on the ticket, outlets (like the Daily Beast) quickly pointed out Martin and Walz’s uncanny resemblance. They do have the same white locks and glasses, after all. The comments under Martin’s thread post were flooded with fans eager to see Martin return to the show. “Your country needs you,” one commenter wrote. “It would amazing,” another chimed in."
