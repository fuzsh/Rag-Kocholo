        "meta_description": "5150: Star Army is a rewrite and update of the military and bugs sections of the original 5150.\n\nThis game has a strong focus on military skirmishes of up to about a company, with a platoon being more typical.  Each figure represents one man, alien or vehicle.  There are three basic scenarios- patrol, attack and defend, which are each altered by a system for randomly laying out the board as well as generating opposing forces for solo players.  Individual games can combine in a campaign where individual soldiers improve over time and new recruits might become available.",
