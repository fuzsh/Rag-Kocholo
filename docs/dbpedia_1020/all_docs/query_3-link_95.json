        "text": "Indian Army ranks represent the hierarchical structure and organisation of the Indian Army. These ranks signify the levels of authority, responsibility, and leadership within the military. The Field Marshal is the highest rank in the Indian Army. Understanding the Indian Army ranks is essential for comprehending the organisation’s chain of command, promotions, and career progression.\n\nIndian Army Ranks\n\nThe Indian Army follows a well-defined rank structure, including commissioned, non-commissioned, and junior commissioned officers. Each rank carries specific duties, responsibilities, and insignia that distinguish individuals within the military hierarchy. These ranks serve as a symbol of authority, leadership, and expertise within the Indian Army, defining the hierarchy and command structure that upholds the nation’s defence and security.\n\nAfter India gained independence in 1947, the Indian Army underwent significant changes, including the restructuring of its rank system. In 1950, a new set of ranks was introduced to reflect the independent status of the Indian Army. Let us explore each in detail in the coming sections.\n\nCommissioned Officer Ranks in the Indian Army\n\nCommissioned officers hold leadership positions and are responsible for commanding and leading troops. As officers progress through the ranks, their responsibilities and scope of command increase. Commissioned officers are trained extensively in leadership, tactics, and specialized skills, playing a vital role in planning and executing military operations.\n\nThe table provided below represents the ranks of Commissioned Officers in the Indian Army, along with a description of their insignia and the collar patches associated with each rank:\n\nRank Insignia Description Collar Patch Field Marshal The insignia consists of the national emblem placed over a crossed sword and baton, encircled by a lotus blossom wreath.

Havildar The insignia features three rank chevrons. Naik The insignia includes two rank chevrons.
