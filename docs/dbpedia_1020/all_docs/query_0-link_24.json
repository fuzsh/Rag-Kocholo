        "text": "Your Military Benefits\n\nThe Armed Forces Recreation Centers (AFRC) Resorts serve members of the U.S. Armed Forces, their families and other authorized users. The AFRCs are Category C Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR) activities operated by the U.S. Army as executive agent for Department of Defense (DOD). Army Installation Management Command (IMCOM) G9 directly manages the AFRCs to provide all uniformed services with high-quality, affordable resort-style facilities consistent with the Army's focus on readiness and quality of life for Service Members and their Families. Personnel eligible to use AFRC guestrooms, food and beverage, recreation, facilities and other guest services are defined below.\n\nDisabled Veterans Equal Access Act\n\nIn January 2020 we received new Department of Defense/Army Regulations which expand authorized use at AFRC Resorts to Purple Heart recipients, former prisoners of war (POW), veterans with VA-documented service-connected disability ratings and Primary Family Caregivers of eligible Veterans under the VA Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers.\n\nThis expanded authorization currently does not include the Edelweiss Lodge\n\nThe new law is subject to the limitations of applicable host nation law and international agreements that have not been resolved. If there is a change in policy we will update our website and social media pages.\n\nBelow are the guidelines for the new authorized users at Hale Koa Hotel and the Shades of Green Resort:\n\nVeterans who are Purple Heart recipients, veterans who are former POWs, all veterans with VA-documented service-connected disability ratings, and individuals assessed, approved, and designated as the Primary Family Caregivers of eligible veterans under the VA Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers are eligible users when identified as follows:\n\nVeterans must present a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) indicating at least one of the three acceptable eligibility statuses (PURPLE HEART, FORMER POW, or SERVICE CONNECTED); paired with an acceptable credentials such as a REAL ID-compliant State driver’s license or a U.S. passport.\n\nNote: VHICs are issued to veterans enrolled in VA health care. For information regarding eligibility please visit https://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/vhic/ for the application process.\n\nPrimary Family Caregivers must present their letter from the VA Office of Community Care that indicates they are assessed, approved, and designated Primary Family Caregiver of an eligible Veteran under the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers and are eligible for these privileges paired with an acceptable credential like a REAL ID-compliant state driver’s license or a U.S. passport.\n\nRestrictions apply for Disney’s Military Promotional Salute Tickets, Universal Orlando’s Military Promotional Ticket offers and the Stars and Stripes Length of Stay tickets."
