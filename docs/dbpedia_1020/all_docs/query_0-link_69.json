        "text": "A number of RuPaul’s Drag Race queens are coming for Missouri politician Valentina Gomez after a homophobic tirade about the Olympics she posted to social media.\n\n“These f—-ts should get their own f—-t category, because, before, if a man hit a woman, it used to land him in jail. Now, it gets you a gold medal at the Olympics,” Gomez — who is running for Secretary of State in Missouri — said in her video, in reference to Algerian boxer Imane Khelif, who is taking part in the Paris Olympics after she was previously disqualified from the 2023 world championship competition after failing an unspecified gender qualification test. “These are the worst Olympics in history. They’ve made a mockery out of Christianity and women. Let me remind you, there’s no such thing as a chick with a dick. Keep women’s sports female.”\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, Khelif’s passport shows that she was assigned female at birth, “which is the International Olympic Committee’s threshold for eligibility for boxing.” The IOC banned the International Boxing Association’s recognition as the global body for the sport in 2023 due to its failure to complete reforms on governance, finance and ethical issues.\n\n“If only you had a f—-t to properly wax your upper lip and eyebrows. No wonder you are bitter,” superstar Drag Race season 6 winner Bianca Del Rio responded to Gomez’s clip, according to Entertainment Weekly. Gomez has since blocked Del Rio on social media.\n\n“GIRL F— YOU! YOU PICK ME A– B—-,” All Stars season eight finalist Kandy Muse added. Shea Couleé, All Stars season five winner, also called Gomez “a clown and a loser.”"
