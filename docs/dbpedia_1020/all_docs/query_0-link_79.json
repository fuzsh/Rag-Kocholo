        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: U.S.-based distributor Synkronized has acquired world rights for supernatural romance Can You Hear Me.\n\nThe deal was brokered by Iuvit Media Sales on behalf of UK production company CYHM Ltd, which produced the film in association with Primary Wave Music (Wanna Dance With Somebody).\n\nThe mystery historical romance stars Peter Facinelli as an American soldier who is shot while serving in France in World War One but remains determined to reunite with his fiancée back in the U.K., which he does in soul if not in body.\n\nSynkronized said the acquisition marked another step towards building its biggest line-up in 24 years of domestic distribution.\n\n“Can You Hear Me is the perfect film for worldwide audiences. It has love, mystery, action, and an elevated concept that makes it a timeless film” says Synkronized CEO Alex Cohen.\n\n“We are convinced of the film’s commercial appeal to a global audience, thanks to the work of experienced Producers and a quality cast.”\n\nThe movie is directed by Simon Hunter from a screenplay by Charlotte Radford, who also co-stars. She and Facinelli are joined in the cast by James Cosmo (Game of Thrones), and John Standing (The Great Escaper).\n\nFacinelli is represented by Paradigm Talent Agency; Radford by Artist International Group, James Cosmo by United Agents, and John Standing by United Agents."
