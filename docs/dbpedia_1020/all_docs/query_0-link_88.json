        "text": "It’s SB19’s A’TIN versus Dua Lipa’s fans in the Fan Army Face-Off 2024 quarterfinals. A’TIN won last year, but can they do it again?\n\nVote now!\n\nTetris Kelly:\n\nIt’s the quarterfinals of Billboard‘s Fan Army Face-Off, and this matchup is going global. Our second match is A’TIN vs. Dua Lipa’s fans. Who could win in this five-against-one pairing? SB19 knocked out SZA, Karol G and Lana Del Rey to make it to the quarterfinals. SB19, the boy band hailing from the Philippines, has been in the game six years, and has almost 4 million Tiktok followers and 1.6 million monthly listeners with only one studio album and two EPs. While their numbers may not match some others in the quarterfinals, SB19 are the reigning Fan Army Face-Off champs.\n\nSB19:\n\nCongratulations, A’TIN, for becoming this year’s ultimate fandom!\n\nTetris Kelly:\n\nAnd when it comes to Dua, she dominated Travis Scott, Megan Thee Stallion and Peso Pluma. Dua Lipa dropped her third studio album earlier this year, boasts 10 and a half million Tiktok followers, almost 74 million monthly listeners on Spotify, and she’s won three Grammys so far.\n\nWho are you voting for? Head over to billboard.com to see who’s in the lead and cast your vote."
