        "text": "Every year, we partner with the Texas Chapter of Korean War Veterans to commemorate National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day on July 27. The Korean War Armistice was signed on July 27, 1953, marking the end of roughly three years of conflict.\n\nThis year, we had the honor of hosting nearly three dozen Korean War veterans and their families for lunch and a tour of our Austin campus. Special guests Kun Chee ‘Casey’ Youn, president of the Korean American Association - Houston; Bob Mitchell with the Korean War Veterans Association – Texas Chapter and editor of the Warrior; and Max Johnson, president of the Korean War Veteran Association – Texas Chapter also spoke at the event.\n\nMike Atencio, chair of our Military Appreciation Group and former sergeant with the Marine Corps, was moved by the Korean War veterans' stories of courage and unwavering dedication.\n\n\"It was a profound privilege for me to stand before the veterans and recognize their immense sacrifices and bravery that they demonstrated during the Korean War,\" says Atencio. \"Their service has left an indelible mark on history and has paved the way for freedoms many enjoy today.\"\n\nSamsung Austin Semiconductor's Communications and Community Affairs director Michele Glaze's father also served in the Korean War so being able to \"meet other Korean War veterans and Koreans who fought alongside them was very special.\"\n\nAfter the event at our campus, the veterans visited the Texas State Capitol to place wreaths at the Texas Korean War Veterans Memorial.\n\nKittie Maloy Gugenheim's father, Lt. Col. Ted Maloy, was assigned to the US Army 45th Infantry Division and deployed to the Korean War in March of 1951 where he served as a frontline artillery commander.\n\n\"Fully trained, the 45th was ordered to Korea to replace the First Cavalry Division. Christmas dinner was in the snow. Moving in the night, two 45th regiments were on the main line of resistance (MLR) with the third one in reserve. Snow soon became deeper and the wind stronger. As an 81mm mortar forward observer (FO), I served in combat on/or forward of the MLR at various locations calling in supporting mortar fire,\" writes Maloy about his wartime experience.\n\nMaloy stayed active in the Korean War Veterans Association - Lone Star Chapter until his passing in 2017.\n\nWhile visiting the memorial for the first time, Gugenheim brought a special item of her father's.\n\n\"This is just a wonderful day. Thank you to Samsung. It was great to come and see the monument. I brought his cap so it's almost like having him here,\" says Gugenheim.\n\nThe memorial, located on the northwest corner of the Capitol grounds, pays tribute to the more than 289,000 Texans who served in the Korean War (1950-1953). It includes the inscribed names of the 1,723 Texans either killed in action or missing in action during the conflict.\n\nDuring the Korean War, nearly 1.8 million Americans answered the call to serve. More than 36,000 of those American service members were killed in action, along with more than 7,000 Korean Augmentation to the United States Army soldiers that fought with the United States Armed Forces."
