        "text": "Final Soldier is the third installment in what I consider the finest shooter series ever made, the Star Soldier saga (with Thunderforce being a very, very close second....only the fact that they started with \"2\" turned me off).\n\nFS was released in 1991 by Hudson Soft, and unfortunately is in my opinion the weakest of the four PC-Engine Star Soldier games, the others being Super Star Soldier, Star Parodier, and Soldier Blade.\n\nThe brilliant Gunhed/Blazing Lazers is often included in this series, but as true shmup fans know, Gunhed is a Compile game and although is similar doesn't really belong in the series at all)\n\nOne favorable item about this game is that you can set your weapons before taking on the seven stages of attack waves. There are three different weapons, each with three attack modes. Besides this, you can collect missiles, and up to two side pods, which can be detonated as bombs if you get in a tight squeeze.\n\nThe graphics and music in this shooter aren't quite up to par, but ignoring that, FS is one fun shmup to tackle. The end boss alone is a nice treat, along with the wierded-out level seven.\n\nScore: 6.5/10"
