        "text": "Conflict is an inevitable result of life. On every world that harbors complex living organisms, creatures battle one another for dominance, resources, territory, or ideals. Whether youâve taken up arms to protect others, win glory, exact revenge, or simply earn a living, you are the perfect embodiment of this truth. Youâre an expert at combat of all types but tend to prefer heavy armor and weaponsâthe bigger, the better. You may be a career soldier, a fresh mercenary recruit, or a lone wolf who rejects authority, but whether rushing in for hand-to-hand combat or firing Tactical barrages, youâre a consummate warrior, never hesitating to put yourself in the Line“>line of fire to protect your friends.\n\nHit Points: 7\n\nStamina Points: 7 + Constitution modifier\n\nKey Ability Score: Your Strength helps you attack up close in melee and carry heavier weapons and armor, while your Dexterity helps you fire weapons from a distance and dodge returning fire, so you should choose either Strength or Dexterity as your key ability score. Once made, this choice cannot be changed. A high Constitution score allows you to soak up more damage.\n\nClass Skills: Acrobatics (Dex), Athletics (Str), Engineering (Int), Intimidate (Cha), Medicine (Int), Piloting (Dex), Profession (Cha, Int, or Wis), Survival (Wis)\n\nSkill Ranks per Level: 4 + Intelligence modifier\n\nProficiencies: Armor-light and heavy (and shields); Weapons-basic and advanced melee weapons, small arms, longarms, heavy weapons, sniper weapons, and grenades\n\nTable 4â9: Soldier Class Level Base Attack Bonus Fort Save Bonus Ref Save Bonus Will Save Bonus Class Features 1st +1 +2 +0 +2 Primary fighting style, primary style technique 2nd +2 +3 +0 +3 Combat feat 3rd +3 +3 +1 +3 Boost_3rd_Level”>Gear boost, weapon specialization 4th +4 +4 +1 +4 Combat feat 5th +5 +4 +1 +4 Primary style technique 6th +6 +5 +2 +5 Combat feat 7th +7 +5 +2 +5 Boost_3rd_Level”>Gear boost 8th +8 +6 +2 +6 Combat feat 9th +9 +6 +3 +6 Primary style technique, secondary fighting style, secondary style technique 10th +10 +7 +3 +7 Combat feat 11th +11 +7 +3 +7 Boost_3rd_Level”>Gear boost, soldierâs onslaught 12th +12 +8 +4 +8 Combat feat 13th +13 +8 +4 +8 Primary style technique, secondary style technique 14th +14 +9 +4 +9 Combat feat 15th +15 +9 +5 +9 Boost_3rd_Level”>Gear boost 16th +16 +10 +5 +10 Combat feat 17th +17 +10 +5 +10 Primary style technique, secondary style technique 18th +18 +11 +6 +11 Combat feat 19th +19 +11 +6 +11 Boost_3rd_Level”>Gear boost 20th +20 +12 +6 +12 Combat feat, kill shot\n\nClass Features\n\nPrimary Fighting Style 1st Level\n\nYou have a preferred fighting style that represents the type of soldier you are. Each fighting style is composed of various style techniques that you learn as you gain experience. You must pick one fighting style upon taking your first soldier level, and once made, this choice cannot be changed.\n\nDescriptions of the fighting styles you can choose from are shown here.\n\nPrimary Style Technique 1st Level\n\nAt 1st level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a style technique unique to your primary fighting style.\n\nCombat Feat 2nd Level\n\nAt 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats.\n\nWhenever you gain a new bonus feat, you can also choose to replace one of the bonus feats you have already learned with a different bonus feat. The feat you replace canât be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat or other ability. You can change only one feat at any given level, and you must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time you gain the new bonus feat.\n\nGear Boost 3rd Level\n\nAt 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you learn a trick called a gear boost that make you better with a particular type of weapon or armor. Choose from the gear boosts listed below. Some gear boosts require you to reach a certain soldier level to select them; this level is indicated in parentheses after the boostâs name.\n\nAnchoring Arcana (Su; 7th level)\n\nAs a full action, you can make a single attack with a magic weapon against a single foe. If the attack is a ranged attack, the target must be within the first range increment. Even if the attack normally affects an area or multiple targets, it affects only your selected target. If your attack hits, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to force the target to attempt a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your soldier level + your key ability score modifier). If the target fails its save, it canât voluntarily move from its current space for 1d4 rounds. This has no effect on involuntary movement, but it does prevent the creature from teleporting or moving to another plane. Once youâve struck a foe with this attack, whether it succeeds at or fails its saving throw, it is immune to this ability for 24 hours.\n\nArmored Advantage (Ex)\n\nWhen you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 insight bonus to your Kinetic Armor Class.\n\nBrutal Blast (Ex)\n\nYou gain a +2 insight bonus to damage rolls with weapons that have the blast special property (such as a scattergun). This extra damage applies only to creatures within 10 feet of you; creatures farther away take the normal amount of damage. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 soldier levels you have.\n\nBullet Barrage (Ex)\n\nYou gain a +1 insight bonus to damage rolls for weapons in the projectile category. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 soldier levels you have.\n\nElectric Arc (Ex; 7th level)\n\nWhen you hit a target with a weapon in the shock category, electricity arcs out from your original target to deal electricity damage to a secondary subject within 10 feet of the original target. This damage is equal to the weaponâs level. The secondary subject must be the creature nearest to the original target (your choice if multiple creatures are equidistant).\n\nThis gear boost does not function for weapons that have the explode or blast special property. If you use this gear boost with a weapon with the arc critical hit effect, your secondary subject for electric arc must be the same as your secondary subject for the arc critical effect.\n\nFinesse Striker (Ex)\n\nSource SCOM\n\nYou add half your soldier level to damage rolls using weapons with the operative special property.\n\nFlash Freeze (Ex; 7th level)\n\nWhen you hit a creature with a weapon in the cryo category, that creatureâs speeds are reduced by 10 feet for 1 round, to a minimum of 10 feet.\n\nHeavy Onslaught (Ex; 11th level)\n\nYour attacks with heavy weapons bypass part of the targetâs damage reduction. If your heavy weapon does not already overcome the targetâs damage reduction, treat the targetâs damage reduction as though it were 5 lower. At 15th level, treat the targetâs damage reduction as 10 lower.\n\nLaser Accuracy (Ex)\n\nYou gain a +1 insight bonus to attack rolls with weapons in the laser category.\n\nMelee Striker (Ex)\n\nAdd an additional bonus equal to half your Strength bonus to damage rolls with melee weapons.\n\nNimble Juggernaut (Ex)\n\nSource SCOM\n\nWhenever youâre wearing armor (including powered armor), you reduce your total armor check penalty by 1 (minimum 0) and total speed adjustment by 5 feet (minimum adjustment 0 feet). The armor check penalty reduction increases by 1 at 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter. At 11th level, you reduce the armorâs speed adjustment by 10 feet (minimum adjustment 0 feet). These benefits stack with similar effects, such as from the guard fighting styleâs 1st-level style technique.\n\nPlasma Immolation (Ex; 7th level)\n\nYou are expert at setting things on fire with plasma. If your attack roll with a weapon in the plasma category is a 19 (the d20 shows a 19), and the attack hits your target, the target gains the burning condition. The condition deals 1d4 fire damage if the weapon has an item level of 1st-6th, 1d8 if its item level is 7th-14th, and 2d8 if its item level is 15th or higher.\n\nPowerful Explosive (Ex; 7th level)\n\nWhen you attack with a weapon with the explode special property and a radius of 10 feet or greater, you can increase the radius of the explosion by 5 feet.\n\nSonic Resonance (Ex; 7th level)\n\nWhen you hit a creature within 30 feet of you using a weapon in the sonic category, the sonic energy continues to resonate within that creature, giving it the flat-footed condition for 1 round. If you hit multiple creatures at the same time (such as with an automatic, blast, or explode weapon), only the creature nearest to you or to the center of the explosion (your choice if multiple creatures are equidistant) is affected.\n\nUnburdened Shield (Ex)\n\nSource SCOM\n\nWhenever youâre wielding a shield, you ignore the shieldâs armor check penalty and speed adjustment (if any). If the shield has a maximum Dexterity bonus, you also ignore its maximum Dexterity bonus.\n\nWeapon Specialization (Ex) 3rd Level\n\nYou gain Weapon Specialization as a bonus feat for each weapon type this class grants you proficiency with.\n\nSecondary Fighting Style 9th Level\n\nYou choose another fighting style. Once you choose this second style, it cannot be changed.\n\nSecondary Style Technique 9th Level\n\nAt 9th level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a style technique unique to your secondary fighting style. For the purposes of these style techniques, treat your soldier level as equal to your soldier level â 8.\n\nSoldierâs Onslaught (Ex) 11th Level\n\nWhen you make a full attack, you can make up to three attacks instead of two attacks. You take a â6 penalty to these attacks instead of a â4 penalty.\n\nKill Shot (Ex) 20th Level\n\nAs a standard action, you can make a single attack against an enemy. If the attack hits and does not kill your enemy, you can expend 1 Resolve Point to force the creature to succeed at a Fortitude save or die. Once youâve used this ability on a creature (regardless of whether or not you forced it to attempt a Fortitude save), that creature is immune to your kill shot for 24 hours.\n\nAlternate Class Features\n\nSoldiers have access to the following alternate class features.\n\nAesthetic Warrior\n\nYou study fighting styles thought lost, often recorded only in the art of ancient civilizations or inferred from the shape of relic weapons and battle gear. You focus specifically ancient motions and techniques that rely on form and mobility rather than the harshness of attacks and resilience. You gain Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. You can deal lethal damage with your unarmed strikes, and the attack doesnât count as archaic. At 3rd level, you gain a unique Weapon Specialization with your unarmed strikes, allowing you to add 1-1/2 times your character level to your damage rolls for your unarmed strikes (instead of just adding your character level, as usual). If you can already add 1-1/2 your character level to your unarmed attack rolls (such as due to the vesk natural attack racial trait), you instead can add the block, grapple, and stun weapon special properties to your unarmed strikes.\n\nThis replaces the soldierâs proficiency with heavy armor and heavy weapons.\n\nFeat Boosts\n\nWhenever you would gain a gear boost, you can instead gain a technique called a feat boost that makes you better at using a specific combat feat that you have. All feat boosts require that you have a specific combat feat; this combat feat is indicated in parentheses after the feat boostâs name. You cannot select a feat boost at the same level you gain access to its related feat.\n\nAdvanced Coordination (Ex; Coordinated Shot)\n\nSource SCOM\n\nWhen you are threatening a foe with a wielded melee weapon, cover it gains from you doesnât grant it any bonus to AC against your alliesâ ranged attacks. The foe still counts as having cover for the purpose of effects such as the Coordinated Shot feat; it simply doesnât gain any cover bonuses to AC against your alliesâ attacks.\n\nBeatdown (Ex; Improved Combat Maneuver [Trip])\n\nSource SCOM\n\nWhenever a prone opponent that you threaten attempts to stand up from prone, as a reaction you can make a melee attack against that opponent. This functions similarly to an attack of opportunity, except your attack resolves before the opponentâs action (meaning theyâre still prone when your attack roll and damage are resolved). You cannot use this attack to make a combat maneuver, even if you have another ability or item that would normally allow you to do so.\n\nBodyguard Vigilance (Ex; Bodyguard)\n\nSource SCOM\n\nWhen you use the Bodyguard feat, it requires no action, but you must spend 1 Resolve Point each time after the first you use the Bodyguard feat during a single round, and each use must designate a different ally. Multiple uses of the Bodyguard feat donât increase the penalty to Armor Class that you take using this feat. If you also have In Harmâs Way, each round you can use that feat to intercept one attack per target whose AC you have increased with the Bodyguard feat.\n\nChokehold (Ex; Improved Combat Maneuver [Grapple])\n\nSource SCOM\n\nWhenever you have an opponent pinned, that foe canât speak or perform actions that involve speaking or uttering sound using their voice (such as roaring, singing, and so on). Normally this prevents the target from using language-dependent abilities unless they have limited telepathy or a similar ability.\n\nDefensive Cleave (Ex; Cleave)\n\nSource SCOM\n\nWhen you use the Cleave or Great Cleave feat, you donât take that featâs penalty to your Armor Class.\n\nDefensive Lunge (Ex; Lunge)\n\nSource SCOM\n\nWhen you use the Lunge feat, you donât take that featâs penalty to your Armor Class.\n\nGrabbing Strike (Ex; Improved Combat Maneuver [Grapple])\n\nSource SCOM\n\nWhenever you attack an opponent with an unarmed strike and the result of your attack roll exceeds the foeâs KAC by 8 or more, that foe gains the grappled condition as if you had successfully attempted a grapple combat maneuver. You must be at least 11th level to select this feat boost.\n\nGrapple Equipment (Ex; Improved Combat Maneuver [Grapple])\n\nSource SCOM\n\nWhenever you succeed at an attack roll to grapple an opponent, you can remove one item from the targetâs body that can be easily accessed, as described by the grapple combat maneuver, instead of imposing the grappled condition on your foe.\n\nLightning Kip-Up (Ex; Kip-Up)\n\nSource SCOM\n\nWhenever you have at least 1 Resolve Point, you can stand from prone as part of any other action you take. Creatures with the moxie racial trait can select this feat boost even if they do not have the Kip Up feat.\n\nMulti-Weapon Strike (Ex; Multi-Weapon Fighting)\n\nSource SCOM\n\nAs a standard action, you can make two attacks against a single foe, taking a â3 penalty to each attack. Both attacks must be made using small arms or operative melee weapons. If both attacks hit and deal the same type of damage, combine the damage and apply damage reduction, resistances, vulnerabilities, and similar effects only once.\n\nMulti-Weapon Versatility (Ex; Multi-Weapon Fighting)\n\nSource SCOM\n\nYou treat all one-handed melee weapons as if they had the operative special property for the purpose of determining whether they benefit from the Multi-Weapon Fighting feat and any other combat feats and feat boosts that list Multi-Weapon Fighting as a prerequisite.\n\nSliding Disarm (Ex; Improved Combat Maneuver [Disarm])\n\nSource SCOM\n\nWhenever you successfully use the disarm combat maneuver against an opponent, you can knock the disarmed item up to 10 feet away from the opponent in a direction of your choice.\n\nSoldierâs Adaptability (Ex; Adaptive Fighting)\n\nSource SCOM\n\nYou can use the Adaptive Fighting feat multiple times per day. Each time per day you use Adaptive Fighting after the first, you must spend 1 Resolve Point. If you use Adaptive Fighting again before a previous use expires, you replace the previously chosen feat with a different choice. If a combat feat has any daily, encounter, or target limitations, any uses of any feat chosen with this ability count toward its daily limit.\n\nSpinning Cleave (Ex; Cleave)\n\nSource SCOM\n\nWhenever you use the Cleave or Great Cleave feat, you can make subsequent attacks against foes that are not adjacent to one another, provided each foe is within your reach.\n\nSpringing Onslaught (Ex; Spring Attack)\n\nSource SCOM\n\nWhen you use Spring Attack, you can select two targets to attack during your movement instead of one. Both attacks are made with a â4 penalty. All restrictions of Spring Attack apply to both targets, and your movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity from either target. You canât target the same creature twice with this ability. You must be at least 7th level to select this feat boost.\n\nSpringing Shot (Ex; Shot on the Run)\n\nSource SCOM\n\nWhen you use Shot on the Run, you can select two targets to attack during your movement instead of one. Both attacks take a â4 penalty. All restrictions of Shot on the Run apply to both targets, and your movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity from either target. You canât target the same creature twice with this ability. You must be at least 7th level to select this feat boost.\n\nVolleying Bombardment (Ex; Opening Volley)\n\nSource SCOM\n\nWhenever you deal damage to an opponent with a ranged attack on your second or subsequent turn in a combat, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your next melee attack against that opponent, so long as this melee attack occurs before the end of your next turn.\n\nSpecial Ops Trainings\n\nWhenever you would gain a gear boost, you can instead gain a technique called special ops training that makes you better with one or more skills commonly used to perform special military operations.\n\nAdvanced Operations Specialist (Ex)\n\nSource SCOM\n\nChoose one class skill you gained from the soldier class or a soldier class feature. You gain an insight bonus to this skill equal to one-third your soldier class level (minimum +1). You can select this special ops training more than once. Each time, you select a different class skill.\n\nOperations Specialist (Ex)\n\nSource SCOM\n\nChoose one of the following skills: Bluff, Computers, Disguise, Perception, Piloting, or Stealth. Add the chosen skill to your list of soldier class skills, and gain a +1 bonus to checks with this skill. You can select this special ops training more than once. Each time, you select a different class skill.\n\nSoldier Class Builds\n\nBodyguard\n\nTheme: Mercenary\n\nYou excel at protecting others, usually taking the hits meant for your charges.\n\nAbility Scores\n\nDexterity is most important because you need it both to hit and to increase your AC, but you also need plenty of Constitution and enough Strength to comfortably carry and use heavy weapons and armor.\n\nFighting Style\n\nGuard\n\nGear Boosts\n\nArmored advantage\n\nFlash freeze (7th)\n\nFeats\n\nBodyguard\n\nEnhanced Resistance\n\nImproved Initiative\n\nIn Harmâs Way\n\nSlippery Shooter\n\nSpellbane\n\nToughness\n\nWeapon Focus (longarms or heavy weapons)\n\nSkills\n\nIntimidate\n\nMedicine\n\nSurvival\n\nClose Combatant\n\nTheme: Mercenary\n\nYou specialize in taking the fight to your foes, moving quickly and aggressively to strike them down with melee weapons.\n\nAbility Scores\n\nStrength is most important because you need it to hit your foes and deal more damage, but donât ignore Dexterity or Constitution.\n\nFighting Style\n\nBlitz\n\nGear Boosts\n\nArmored Advantage\n\nMelee Striker\n\nFeats\n\nDeflect Projectiles\n\nJet Dash\n\nMobility\n\nOpening Volley\n\nSpring Attack\n\nStep Up\n\nStep Up and Strike\n\nWeapon Focus (advanced melee weapons)\n\nSkills\n\nAcrobatics\n\nAthletics\n\nSurvival\n\nSniper\n\nTheme: Outlaw\n\nYou are skilled at dealing death from afar.\n\nAbility Scores\n\nDexterity is your most important ability score because you need it both to hit and to increase your AC, but youâre flexible in terms of your other ability scores.\n\nFighting Style\n\nSharpshoot\n\nGear Boosts\n\nBullet barrage\n\nLaser accuracy\n\nFeats\n\nDeadly Aim\n\nFar Shot\n\nImproved Initiative\n\nSkill Focus (Stealth)\n\nSlippery Shooter\n\nSpecial Weapon Proficiency (sniper rifles)\n\nWeapon Focus (sniper rifles)\n\nWeapon Specialization (sniper rifles)\n\nSkills\n\nAcrobatics\n\nPiloting\n\nStealth\n\nSpellsoldier\n\nTheme: Priest\n\nYou specialize in the use of magic to improve your combat ability.\n\nAbility Scores\n\nDexterity is your most important ability score because you need it both to hit and to increase your AC, but Strength is also important for your heavy weapons, and you need a bit of Wisdom for Connection Inkling.\n\nFighting Style\n\nArcane assailant\n\nGear Boosts\n\nAnchoring arcana (7th)\n\nHeavy onslaught (11th)\n\nFeats\n\nConnection Inkling\n\nImproved Initiative\n\nMystic Strike\n\nPenetrating Attack\n\nSkill Synergy (Intimidate, Mysticism)\n\nWeapon Focus (grenades, heavy weapons)\n\nSkills"
