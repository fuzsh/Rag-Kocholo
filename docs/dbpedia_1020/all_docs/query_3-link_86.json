        "text": "Presidential Unit Citation (Army and Air Force)\n\nThe Distinguished Unit Citation is the predecessor of the PUC (Army). On 3 November 1966, the Distinguished Unit Citation was redesignated the PUC (Army). The PUC is awarded to units of the Armed Forces of the United States and cobelligerent nations for extraordinary heroism in action against an armed enemy occurring on or after 7 December 1941. The unit must display such gallantry, determination, and esprit de corps in accomplishing its mission under extremely difficult and hazardous conditions as to set it apart from and above other units participating in the same campaign. The degree of heroism required is the same as that which would warrant award of a DSC to an individual. Extended periods of combat duty or participation in a large number of operational missions, either ground or air, is not sufficient. This award will normally be earned by units that have participated in single or successive actions covering relatively brief time spans. It is not reasonable to presume that entire units can sustain DSC performance for extended periods except under the most unusual circumstances and a written justification for an exception must be provided for recognition of any length over 30 days. Only on a rare occasions will a unit larger than a BN qualify for award of this decoration. Units larger than a BN must submit a memorandum of justification for the recommendation through the HRC, ADB (AHRC–PDP–A) to the SECARMY.\n\nRecommendations for award of the PUC to Army units will be submitted on a DA Form 7594 (Unit Award Recommendation) and processed through normal military command channels to Commander, U.S. Army Human Resources Command, Awards and Decorations Branch (AHRC–PDP–A), 1600 Spearhead Division Avenue, Fort Knox, KY 40122–5408. Recommendations will be initiated by a senior headquarters for the unit recommended for the award. Each recommendation will be submitted as promptly as practicable, supported by the following data:\n\n(1) Operational orders and reports.\n\n(2) Maps showing the terrain and the dispositions and actions of the opposing forces.\n\n(3) Casualties sustained on both sides.\n\n(4) A list of all units assigned and attached, actually present and participating in the action, and the inclusive dates of the period of service for each unit.\n\n(5) The complete official unit designation and unit identification code (UIC) must be included for each unit. Include designations and derivative UICs for subordinate elements of parent units and for all elements comprising the task force organization. When less than the entire unit is involved, but more than 65 percent of the modified table of organization and equipment (MTOE) strength, it should be indicated by a minus sign (-) next to the unit designation. When the percentage involved is less than 65 percent of a unit’s MTOE strength, the unit should be listed as a detachment of the parent unit.\n\n(6) A statement from the commander certifying that more than 65 percent of each unit’s MTOE strength participated in the action. If less than 65 percent participated, a detachment of the unit may be cited.\n\n(7) Any other pertinent material.\n\n(8) A proposed citation, naming all participating units, and the specific date and geographic location (map feature, town, province name, and so forth) of the action.\n\nEach recommendation for the PUC unit award must be formally entered into official channels within 2 years from the date of the heroism or services performed. Recommendations made after the 3-year window will be submitted in accordance with the 10 USC 1130 process. Refer to paragraph 1–14 and appendix F.\n\n(1) Recommendations for award of a unit decoration to a unit of the Armed Forces of the United States or a cobelligerent nation serving in a joint command will be submitted through command channels to the commander or military department having authority to make the award. When a recommendation covers more than one military Service, all or a portion of which were performed while the unit was operating under a joint commander; comments or a recommendation concerning the valorous actions of that unit will be obtained from the joint commander concerned.\n\n(2) Intermediate level commanders will recommend approval or disapproval for each recommendation and forward it to the next higher headquarters. If disapproval is recommended, the reasons for disapproval will be cited.\n\nThe SECARMY, on behalf of the President of the United States, is the final approval authority for the PUC.\n\nRecommendations for award of the PUC to a unit of another military Service permanently or temporarily assigned to the Army may be approved with written concurrence of that Service. The award must be approved prior to obtaining concurrence.\n\nThe award elements for the PUC (Army) are as follows: PUC Streamer (Army); Presidential Unit Emblem (Army); certificate and citation; and DAGO.\n\nPresidential Unit Citation (Navy and Marine Corps)\n\nThe Navy citation was established by Executive Order 9050 on 6 February 1942.\n\nThe Navy version has blue, yellow, and red horizontal stripes, and is the only Navy ribbon having horizontal stripes.[6] To distinguish between the two versions of the Presidential Unit Citation, the Navy version is typically referred to as the \"Navy and Marine Corps Presidential Unit Citation,\" while the Army and Air Force refer to the decoration simply as the Presidential Unit Citation. These are only worn by persons who meet the criteria at the time it is awarded to the unit. Unlike the Army, those who later join the unit do not wear it on a temporary basis.\n\nPresidential Unit Citation (Coast Guard)\n\nUnited States Coast Guard units may be awarded either the Navy or Coast Guard version of the Presidential Unit Citation, depending on which service the Coast Guard was supporting when the citation action was performed.\n\nThe current decoration is known as the \"Department of Homeland Security Presidential Unit Citation\". The original Coast Guard Presidential Unit Citation was established under the authority of Executive Order 10694 (signed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on January 10, 1957), and amended by Section 74 of Executive Order 13286 (signed by President George W. Bush on February 28, 2003) to transfer the award of the USCG PUC to the Secretary of Homeland Security.\n\nJoint Meritorious Unit Award\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAuthorized by the Secretary of Defense on June 10, 1981, this award was originally called the Department of Defense Meritorious Unit Award. It is awarded in the name of the Secretary of Defense to joint activities for meritorious achievement or service, superior to that which is normally expected, for actions in the following situations; combat with an armed enemy of the United States, a declared national emergency, or under extraordinary circumstances that involve national interests.\n\nAll joint units and activities (as defined in DOD 1348.33-M, paragraph B.1.) are eligible for award of the Joint Meritorious Unit Award (JMUA) in recognition of exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding service. However, a unit's or activities outstanding accomplishment of its normally assigned and expected mission is not in and of itself sufficient justification for award approval. Instead, qualifying achievements must be superior to that which is expected under one of the following conditions and should be operational in nature.\n\nCRITERIA\n\nEligibility for the JMUA is only to those members of the armed forces of the United States who were present at the time and directly participated in the service or achievement for 30 days or more, or for the period cited if less than 30 days, shall be authorized to wear the JMUA ribbon. Members must be permanently assigned or attached by official orders to the joint unit receiving the JMUA. Local commanders may waive, on an individual basis, the 30-day minimum time requirement for individuals (e.g., Reserve personnel on active duty and temporary duty and/or temporary assigned duty personnel), who, in the opinion of the commander contributed directly to the achievement cited, and were assigned on official orders to the awarded unit during the approved time frames. Service units or individuals deployed in support of a joint task force (JTF), but not assigned and/ or attached to the JTF by official orders, are not eligible for the JMUA, even if they are under the operational control of the JTF. The Services, may award appropriate Service unit awards to their units assigned and/or attached to a JTF. Additional awards are indicated by an oak-leaf cluster worn on the ribbon.\n\nTo find a listing of all approved JMUAs, please consult DOD 1348.33-M dated September 1996; or review a listing of approved Air Force Unit Awards from 1991 to present, or approved DOD Awards (to include the JMUA) at: United States Air Force Unit Award - DOD Awards.\n\nRIBBON DESCRIPTION\n\nThis award ribbon is identical to the Department of Defense Superior Service Medal ribbon, indicative of the fact that the service performed would have been similar to warrant the award of this medal to an individual. It has a center stripe of red, flanked on either side by equal stripes of white, light blue and gold, with a narrow stripe of light blue at the edge. The ribbon is within a gold colored 1/16 inch wide metal frame with laurel leaves. Similar to other Army and Air Force unit awards, it is worn in the same manner.\n\nAUTHORIZED DEVICES\n\nOak Leaf Cluster\n\nArmy Valorous Unit Award\n\nThe VUA may be awarded to units of the Armed Forces of the United States and cobelligerent nations for extraordinary heroism in action against an armed enemy of the United States while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force or while serving with friendly foreign forces engaged in an armed conflict against an opposing armed force in which the United States is not a belligerent party for actions occurring on or after 3 August 1963.\n\nThe VUA requires a lesser degree of gallantry, determination, and esprit de corps than that required for the PUC. Nevertheless, the unit must have performed with marked distinction under difficult and hazardous conditions in accomplishing its mission to set it apart from and above other units participating in the same conflict. The degree of heroism required is the same as that which would warrant award of the SS to an individual. Extended periods of combat duty or participation in a large number of operational missions, either ground or air, is not sufficient.This award will normally be earned by units that have participated in single or successive actions covering relatively brief time spans, not to exceed 6 months (a month is considered 30 calendar days). It is not reasonable to presume that entire units can sustain SS performance for extended periods except under the most unusual circum- stances. Only on a rare occasion will a unit larger than a BN qualify for award of this decoration. Units larger than a BN must attach a memorandum of justification for the recommendation through the HRC, ADB (AHRC–PDP–A) to the DCS, G–1.\n\nRecommendations for award of the VUA to Army units will be submitted on a DA Form 7594 and processed through normal military command channels to Commander, U.S. Army Human Resources Command, Awards and Decorations Branch (AHRC–PDP–A), 1600 Spearhead Division Avenue, Fort Knox, KY 40122–5408. Recommenda- tions will be initiated by a senior parent headquarters to the unit recommended for the award. Each recommendation will be submitted as promptly as practicable, supported by the following data:\n\n(1) Operational orders and reports.\n\n(2) Maps showing the terrain and the dispositions and actions of the opposing forces.\n\n(3) Casualties sustained on both sides.\n\n(4) A list of all units assigned and attached, actually present and participating in the action, and the inclusive dates of the period of service for each unit.\n\n(5) A statement from the commander certifying that more than 65 percent of each unit’s MTOE strength participated in the action. If less than 65 percent participated, a detachment of the unit may be cited.\n\n(6) The complete official unit designation and UIC must be included for each unit. Include designations and derivative UICs for subordinate elements of parent units and for all elements comprising the task force organization. When less than the entire unit is involved, but more than 65 percent of the MTOE strength, it should be indicated by a minus sign (-) next to the unit designation. When the percentage involved is less than 65 percent of a unit’s MTOE strength, the unit should be listed as a detachment of the parent unit.\n\n(7) Any other pertinent material.\n\n(8) A proposed citation, naming all participating units, and the specific date and geographic location (map feature, town, province name) of the action.\n\nEach recommendation for the VUA must be formally entered into official channels within 2 years from the date of the heroism or services performed. Recommendations made after the 3-year window will be submitted in accordance with the 10 USC 1130 process. (Refer to para 1–14 and app F.)\n\nRecommendations for award of a unit decoration to a unit of the Armed Forces of the United States or a cobelligerent nation serving in a joint command will be submitted through command channels to the commander or military department having authority to make the award. When a recommendation covers more than one military Service, all or a portion of which were performed while the unit was operating under a joint commander; comments or a recommendation concerning the valorous actions of that unit will be obtained from the joint commander concerned.\n\nIntermediate level commanders will recommend approval or disapproval for each recommendation and forward it to the next higher headquarters. If disapproval is recommended, the reasons for disapproval will be cited.\n\nRecommendations for award of the VUA to a unit of another military Service permanently or temporarily assigned to the Army may be approved with written concurrence of that Service. The award must be approved prior to obtaining concurrence.\n\nThe DCS, G–1 is approval authority for the VUA. The exception to this is commanders that are delegated wartime awards approval authority by the SECARMY or his or her designee in writing. For all VUAs approved in theater, authorized commanders will provide a copy of the approved POs to HRC, ADB (AHRC–PDP–\n\nA). Refer to table 7–1 on initial coordinating and processing of the VUA.\n\nRecommendations to downgrade the VUA to a MUC will not be approved.\n\nThe award elements for the VUA are as follows: VUA Streamer; VUA Emblem; certificate and citation; and DAGO.\n\nNavy Unit Commendation\n\nEligibility Requirements. Awarded by SECNAV to any unit of the Navy or Marine Corps that has distinguished itself by outstanding heroism in action against the enemy, but not sufficient to justify the award of the Presidential Unit Citation; or to any such unit that has distinguished itself by extremely meritorious service, not involving combat, but in support of military operations, rendering the unit outstanding compared to other units performing similar service. This award may also be conferred upon units of the other branches of the U.S. Armed Forces, and of armed forces of friendly foreign nations serving with the U.S. Armed Forces, provided such units meet the standards established for Navy and Marine Corps units. To justify this award, the unit must have performed service of a character comparable to that which would merit the award of a Silver Star Medal for heroism, or a Legion of Merit for meritorious service to an individual. Normal performance of duty or participation in a large number of combat missions does not, in itself, justify the award. An award will not be made to a unit for actions of one or more of its component parts, unless the unit performed uniformly as a team, in a manner justifying collective recognition.\n\nAir Force Gallant Unit Award\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nIn March 2004, the Secretary of the Air Force approved the Gallant Unit Citation to recognize organizations for outstanding heroism in combat.\n\nCRITERIA\n\nAwarded to Air Force active duty, Reserve, and Air National Guard units for extraordinary heroism in action against an armed enemy of the United States while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force on or after Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nThe GUC requires a lesser degree of gallantry, determination and esprit de corps than that required for the Presidential Unit Citation. Nevertheless, the unit must have performed with marked distinction under difficult and hazardous conditions in accomplishing its mission so as to set it apart from and above other units participating in the same conflict. The degree of heroism required is the same as that which would warrant award of the Silver Star which is awarded for gallantry and heroism of high degrees, including risk of life in action.\n\nThe GUC award will normally be earned by units that have participated in single or successive actions covering relatively brief time spans. Only on rare occasions will a unit larger than a group qualify for GUC. Although units larger than a group may submit, it will be extremely rare that a large organization will receive the GUC due to the degree of valor required. Extended periods of combat duty or participation in a large number of operational missions, either air or ground, is not sufficient.\n\nRIBBON DESCRIPTION\n\nThe GUC shall be worn immediately before the Joint Meritorious Unit Award. Subsequent awards will be denoted by Oak Leaf Clusters.\n\nAUTHORIZED DEVICES\n\nOak Leaf Cluster\n\nWEIGHTED AIRMAN PROMOTED SYSTEM POINT VALUE: 0\n\nCoast Guard Unit Commendation\n\nThe UC may be awarded to any unit that has distinguished itself by valorous or extremely meritorious service not involving combat but in support of Coast Guard operations. The Commandant may also bestow the award upon a unit of another branch of the Armed Forces of the United States, provided such unit meets the standards established for Coast Guard units. To justify the award, the service performed as a unit must be comparable to that which would merit the award of at least the MSM to an individual. When the degree of achievement or service is not sufficient to warrant the award of the UC, the Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendation should be considered. Normal performance of duty or participation in a large number of operational missions does not in itself justify the award. A Coast Guard Unit Commendation will not be awarded to a large unit for actions of one or more of its sub-units unless the entire unit performed as a team.\n\na. Recommendations. Recommendations for the UC must be prepared on a Coast Guard Award Recommendation, form CG-1650, and will include the following:\n\nA Summary of Action (SOA) of at least one page containing sufficient data and justification, in accordance with the eligibility criteria, to enable the reviewing and approving authorities to adequately consider the recommendation. Supporting documents may be attached.\n\nA complete list of all units, teams, and individuals recommended for participation, including staffs when appropriate, with dates of attachments to the recommended unit. Previous unit awards for the cited period that have been approved or recommended for any units on the list must be noted or included. If there has been no previous unit award for the cited period, a statement to this effect should be included.\n\nA proposed citation, drafted by the originator.\n\n(a) If the Operational Distinguishing Device is authorized, it must be specified in the citation.\n\n(b) In cases of a subsequent award of the UC to military personnel, a gold star is issued, and shall be specified in the citation.\n\nStandard opening phrase for citations. “For exceptionally meritorious service from (starting date) to (ending date) while . . .”\n\nStandard closing phrase for citations. “The professionalism, pride, and devotion to duty displayed by (unit name) are in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Coast Guard.”\n\nArmy Meritorious Unit Commendation\n\nThe MUC (Army) (previously called the Meritorious Service Unit Plaque) is awarded to units for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services for at least 6 continuous months during the period of military operations against an armed enemy occurring on or after 1 January 1944. Service in a combat zone is not required, but must be directly related to the combat effort. Units based in CONUS are excluded from this award, as are other units outside the area of operation. The unit must display such outstanding devotion and superior performance of exceptionally difficult tasks as to set it apart and above other units with similar missions. The degree of achievement required is the same as that which would warrant award of the LM to an individual. Recommendations for units larger than a brigade will not be submitted. For services performed during World War II, awards will be made only to service units and only for services performed between 1 January 1944 and 15 September 1946.\n\nEffective 1 March 1961, the MUC was authorized for units and/or detachments of the Armed Forces of the United States for exceptionally meritorious conduct in performance of outstanding services for at least 6 continuous months in support of military operations. Service(s), as used in this paragraph, is interpreted to relate to combat service support type activities and not to the type of activities performed by senior headquarters, combat, or combat support units.\n\nEffective 11 September 2001, the MUC is authorized for units and/or detachments of the Armed Forces of the United States for exceptionally meritorious performance for at least 6 continuous months (a month is considered 30 calendar days) during military operations against an armed enemy without regard to type of duties performed or the type of unit performing the duties.\n\nRecommendations for award of the MUC to Army units will be submitted on a DA Form 7594 and processed through normal military command channels to Commander, U.S. Army Human Resources Command, Awards and Decorations Branch (AHRC–PDP–A), 1600 Spearhead Division Avenue, Fort Knox, KY 40122–5408. Recommenda- tions will be initiated by a senior parent headquarters to the unit recommended for the award. Each recommendation will be submitted as promptly as practicable, supported by the following data:\n\n(1) List of tasks performed during the period. (2) Record of absence without leave.\n\n(3) Convictions by court-martial.\n\n(4) Punishments under Article 15, UCMJ.\n\n(5) A statement from the commander certifying that more than 65 percent of each unit’s MTOE strength partici- pated. If less than 65 percent participated, a detachment of the unit may be cited.\n\n(6) A list of all units assigned and attached actually present and the inclusive dates of the period of service for each unit. Inclusive dates do not need to cover the entire deployment period.\n\n(7) The complete official unit designation and UIC must be included for each unit. Include designations and derivative UICs for subordinate elements of parent units and for all elements comprising the task force organization. When less than the entire unit is involved, but more than 65 percent of the MTOE strength, it should be indicated by a minus sign (-) next to the unit designation. When the percentage involved is less than 65 percent of a unit’s MTOE strength, the unit should be listed as a detachment of the parent unit.\n\n(8) Any other pertinent information.\n\n(9) A proposed citation, naming all participating units, and the specific date and geographic location (map feature, town, province name, and so forth) of the service being recognized.\n\nEach recommendation for the MUC (Army) must be formally entered into official channels within 2 years from the date of the services performed. Recommendations made after the 3-year window will be submitted in accordance with the 10 USC 1130 process. Refer to paragraph 1–14 and appendix F.\n\nRecommendations for award of the MUC (Army) to a unit of the Armed Forces of the United States or a cobelligerent nation serving in a joint command will be submitted through command channels to the commander or military department having authority to make the award. When a recommendation covers actions, all or a portion of which were performed while the unit was operating under a joint commander; comments or recommendation concern- ing the meritorious performance of that unit will be obtained from the joint commander concerned.\n\nIntermediate level commanders will recommend approval or disapproval for each recommendation and forward it to the next higher headquarters. If disapproval is recommended, the reasons for disapproval will be cited.\n\nRecommendations for award of the MUC (Army) to a unit of another military Service permanently or temporarily assigned to the Army may be approved with written concurrence of that Service. The award must be approved prior to obtaining concurrence.\n\nThe DCS, G–1 is approval authority for the MUC. The exception to this is commanders that are delegated wartime awards approval authority by the SECARMY or his or her designee, in writing. For all MUCs approved in theater, authorized commanders will provide a copy of the approved POs to HRC, ADB (AHRC–PDP–A). Refer to table 7–1 on initial coordinating and processing of the MUC.\n\nThe award elements for the MUC are as follows: MUC Streamer; MUC Emblem; certificate and citation; and DAGOs.\n\nNavy Meritorious Unit Commendation\n\nEligibility Requirements. Awarded by SECNAV, CNO, or CMC to any unit of the Navy or Marine Corps that has distinguished itself, under combat or non-combat conditions, by either valorous or meritorious achievement, which renders the unit outstanding compared to other units performing similar service, but not sufficient to justify award of the Navy Unit Commendation. This award may also be conferred upon units of the other branches of the U.S. Armed Forces, and the armed forces of friendly foreign nations serving with U.S. Armed Forces, provided such units meet the standards established for Navy and Marine Corps units. To justify this award, the unit must have performed service of a character comparable to that which would merit the award of a Bronze Star Medal, or achievement of like caliber in a non-combat situation, to an individual. Normal performance of duty or participation in a large number of combat missions does not, in itself, justify the award. A n award will not be made to a unit for actions of one or more of its component parts, unless the unit performed uniformly as a team in a manner fully justifying collective recognition\n\nAir Force Meritorious Unit Award\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nIn March 2004, the Secretary of the Air Force approved the Meritorious Unit Award to recognize organizations for outstanding heroism in combat as well as outstanding achievement or service in direct support of combat operations.\n\nCRITERIA\n\nThe MUA is awarded to Air Force active duty, Reserve, and Guard units for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding achievement or service in direct support of combat operations for at least 90 continuous days during the period of military operations against an armed enemy of the United States on or after Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nThe unit must display such outstanding devotion and superior performance of exceptionally difficult tasks as to set it apart and above other units with similar missions. The degree of achievement required is the same as that which would warrant award of the Legion of Merit. Superior performance of normal mission will not alone justify award of the MUA. Service in a combat zone is not required, but service must be directly related to the combat effort. Squadrons, groups, and wings may be recommended for this award.\n\nThe MUA is not awarded to any unit or unit component previously awarded the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award, the Air Force Organizational Excellence Award, or unit awards from other service components for the same act, achievement, or service. The component commander will automatically consider all disapproved MUAs for the AFOUA.\n\nApproval authority for the MUA will be awarded by the major command (MAJCOM) commander; however, approval authority is delegated in cases when Numbered Air Force commanders are serving as Air Component commanders such as United States Central Air Forces (USCENTAF/CC).

Subsequent awards will be denoted by Oak Leaf Clusters.\n\nAUTHORIZED DEVICES\n\nOak Leaf Cluster\n\nCoast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendation\n\nThe MUC may be awarded to any unit of the Coast Guard that has distinguished itself by either valorous or meritorious achievement or service in support of Coast Guard operations not involving combat. The Commandant may also bestow the award upon a unit of another branch of the Armed Forces of the United States, provided the unit meets the standards established for Coast Guard units. To justify the award, the service performed as a unit must be comparable to that which would merit the award of at least the CGAM to an individual. Normal performance of duty or participation in a large number of operational missions does not in itself justify the award. A Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendation will not be awarded to a large unit for actions of one or more of its sub-units unless the entire unit performed as a team.\n\na. Recommendations. Recommendations for the MUC must be prepared on a Coast Guard Award Recommendation, form CG-1650, and will include the following:\n\nA complete list of all units, teams, and individuals recommended for participation, including staffs when appropriate, with dates of attachments to the recommended unit.

Circumstances may be deemed to be extraordinary when they do not represent the typical day-to-day circumstances under which the unit normally performs, or may reasonably be expected to perform, its peacetime mission. The following additional criteria also applies:\n\n(1) The unit must display such outstanding devotion and superior performance of exceptionally difficult tasks as to set the unit apart from and above other units with similar missions. For the purpose of this award, peacetime is defined as any period during which wartime or combat awards are not authorized in the geographical area in which the mission was executed. The ASUA may be awarded to units that distinguish themselves while conducting humanitarian missions for a minimum of 30 days and a maximum of 2 years; however, the ASUA will not be awarded if the same act or period of service has already been recognized by another unit award.\n\n(2) The award applies to both TOE units and table of distribution and allowances (TDA) organizations of BN size or equivalent. All TDA organizations may be considered for this award, even if comprised mostly of civilians. As an exception to policy, organizations larger than BN size or equivalent may also be submitted, but the submitting headquarters must take care to highlight the logic associated with the request to justify an exception to policy.\n\nRecommendations for award of the ASUA to Army units will be submitted on a DA Form 7594 and processed through normal military command channels to Commander, U.S. Army Human Resources Command, Awards and Decorations Branch (AHRC–PDP–A), 1600 Spearhead Division Avenue, Fort Knox, KY 40122–5408, unless it was disapproved earlier by a general officer in the chain of command. Recommendations will be initiated by a senior parent headquarters to the unit recommended for the award. Each recommendation will be submitted as promptly as practicable, supported by the following data:\n\n(1) Detailed unit mission statement.\n\n(2) Narrative outlining the period and basis for the award.\n\n(3) Record of absence without leave.\n\n(4) Convictions by courts-martial.\n\n(5) Punishments under Article 15, UCMJ.\n\n(6) A statement from the commander certifying that more than 65 percent of each unit’s MTOE strength participated in the effort being recognized. If less than 65 percent participated, a detachment of the unit may be cited.\n\n(7) A list of all units assigned and attached and the inclusive dates of the period of service for each unit.\n\n(8) The complete official unit designation and UIC must be included for each unit. Include designations and derivative UICs for subordinate elements of parent units and for all elements comprising task force organizations. When less than the entire unit is involved, but more than 65 percent of the MTOE strength, it should be indicated by a minus sign (-) next to the unit designation. When the percentage involved is less than 65 percent of a unit’s MTOE strength, the unit should be listed as a detachment of the parent unit.\n\n(9) A proposed citation, naming all participating units, and the specific date and location of the service being recognized.\n\nEach recommendation must be formally entered into military channels within 2 years from the completion of the mission or services. Achievements or service for which this award is intended to recognize will not normally exceed 12 months in duration. Recommendations made after the 3-year window will be submitted in accordance with the 10 USC 1130 process.\n\nOnly BN and smaller or comparable units organized under TOE and similar type units organized under TDA are recommended for and are eligible to receive the ASUA. Under most circumstances, headquarters type units would not be eligible for the award. Award to units larger than BN size would be infrequent.\n\nAny general officer in the chain of command may disapprove an ASUA recommendation.\n\nThe DCS, G–1 is the approval authority for the ASUA.\n\nThe award elements for the ASUA are as follows: ASUA Emblem; certificate and citation; streamer; and DAGO. h. The ASUA Lapel Pin is authorized for issue and wear by DA civilians in the employ of the decorated unit. Those individuals employed with the unit during the cited period may wear the lapel pin permanently.

The lapel pin is also authorized for optional purchase and wear on civilian clothing by qualified military personnel. Permanent and temporary wear is governed by the provisions of AR 670–1.\n\nAir Force Outstanding Unit Award\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe Air Force Outstanding Unit Award was authorized by Department of the Air Force General Order 1, Jan. 6, 1954.\n\nCRITERIA\n\nIt is awarded by the Secretary of the Air Force to numbered units that have distinguished themselves by exceptionally meritorious service or outstanding achievement that clearly sets the unit above and apart from similar units.
