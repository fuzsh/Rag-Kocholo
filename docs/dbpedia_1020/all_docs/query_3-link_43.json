        "text": "The Star League Defense Force (SLDF) was the principal military force defending the Star League, a conglomeration of star systems within roughly 500 light years of Terra. At its height the SLDF was the largest military force known to man, composed of over 100 million soldiers organized into 486 divisions.[1] The Star League Defense Force left the Inner Sphere after fighting the Amaris Civil War, when Stefan Amaris overthrew the ruling First Lord of the Star League, Richard Cameron. After a long series of bloody battles throughout the Star League, Commanding General Aleksandr Kerensky ended the coup with the liberation of Terra and the execution of Amaris. However when no new First Lord could be agreed upon by the Great Houses the Star League was dissolved. Kerensky then led the surviving 113 divisions out beyond the Inner Sphere in Operation EXODUS, hoping to save the essence of the League from the internecine violence that was to come.[2] The SLDF would return 300 years later as the Clans, a technologically superior military that invaded the Inner Sphere in 3049.\n\nOrganization and Combat Doctrines[edit]\n\nAt the birth of the Star League, the SLDF was comprised of roughly 270 regiments of ground forces (conventional armor, infantry and BattleMechs), as well as a fleet of greater than 500 capital vessels. At the outset of the Reunification War the SLDF was divided into 10 Corps. Each Corps was named based on its theater of operations and recruitment:\n\nFirst Terran Corps\n\nSecond Rigilian Corps\n\nThird Altairian Corps\n\nFourth Fomalhaut Corps\n\nFifth Sirian Corps\n\nSixth Astan Corps\n\nSeventh Procyon Corps\n\nFirst Reserve Corps\n\nSecond Reserve Corps\n\nStar Guard Corps\n\nBy 2764, the SLDF had over 15,000 regiments and just as many WarShips, JumpShips and DropShips.[3] This force was organized into 125 BattleMech divisions, 200 mechanized infantry divisions, 75 jump infantry divisions, and 50 infantry divisions, with the rest fighting as independent regiments.[4] These formations were further combined into 20 armies divided between several military regions.[5]\n\nMilitary Region Armies Terran Hegemony\n\nFirst Army\n\nFederated Suns\n\nSecond Army\n\nThird Army\n\nFourth Army\n\nCapellan Confederation\n\nFifth Army\n\nSixth Army\n\nSeventh Army\n\nFree Worlds League\n\nEighth Army\n\nNinth Army\n\nTenth Army\n\nLyran Commonwealth\n\nEleventh Army\n\nTwelfth Army\n\nThirteenth Army\n\nDraconis Combine\n\nFourteenth Army\n\nFifteenth Army\n\nSixteenth Army\n\nPeriphery\n\nSeventeenth Army\n\nEighteenth Army\n\nNineteenth Army\n\nTwentieth Army\n\nComposition[edit]\n\nArmy[edit]\n\nThough the composition of each of the Corps/Armies differed, a general rule of organization was maintained though all levels:\n\nAn Army Group was a group of Armies sharing a common strategic objective. Composition of Army Groups varied significantly during the Amaris Civil War, due to the changing strategic objectives of that conflict.\n\nArmy Groups during peace time: For the majority of the Star League era, Army Groups consisted of all the Armies assigned to one of the ten military regions. Those assigned to one of the member states were further divided into three districts and bore the name of the state's ruling family, e.g. Army Group Marik.[5] Prior to the Periphery Uprising, the SLDF had formed ten Army Groups; one for each of the member and territorial states.\n\nArmy Groups in response to the New Vandenberg Uprising: When the greater part of the SLDF deployed into the Periphery in response to the Uprising, the three existing Army Group headquarters within the three territorial states were already under so much pressure that they couldn't take over the command, control and administration of the fresh Armies joining them, and Commanding General Aleksandr Kerensky ordered the formation of three new Army Group HQs to maintain command and control of the inbound armies. These three new Army Group HQs, the Eleventh, Twelfth and Thirteenth, were responsible for the command and control of the invasions of the Taurian Concordat, Magistracy of Canopus and Outworlds Alliance, respectively. When the truth behind the Uprising came out with Stefan Amaris' coup in the Terran Hegemony, Kerensky ordered the formation of the Fourteenth Army Group HQ, which was given responsibility for the invasion of the Rim Worlds Republic, supported by the Tenth Army Group, which had previously been known as Army Group Amaris. While the invasion of the Rim Worlds Republic was underway, four more Army Groups - the Fifteenth, Sixteenth, Seventeenth and Eighteenth Army Groups - were formed as training and occupation forces.\n\nArmy Groups in preparation for Operation CHIEFTAIN: During Operation CHIEFTAIN, the invasion of the Amaris Empire, the Fifteenth and Seventeenth Army Groups became operational Army Groups. Operation CHIEFTAIN also saw four new Army Groups formed, the Nineteenth, Twentieth, Twenty-first and Twenty-second Army Groups, as well as the standing up of the Second Army Group (Army Group Marik), Fourth Army Group (Army Group Kurita) and Fifth Army Group (Army Group Davion). When the SLDF pulled out of the Rim Worlds Republic, the Twenty-third Army Group was established as a new training organization, while the last SLDF Army Group to be created was the Twenty-fourth Army Group, established as the final element of Operation CHIEFTAIN.[6]\n\nAn Army consisted of 3-4 Corps. Each of the three districts within each member state's military region was assigned its own Army.[5] Armies were not of uniform composition, and could consist of less than 140 regiments or over 300, depending on the situation. Armies were also classified in one of four broad categories:[7]\n\nA Standard Defensive Army consisted of between 180 to 220 regiments organized across two dozen divisions, with approximately nine independent regiments for scouting and rapid reaction.\n\nA Light Defensive Army was the smallest army type and consisted of only 130 regiments spread across fifteen divisions. Assigned to the Capellan Confederation these armies' small size was a reflection of that realm's small size and ease of defense.\n\nA Heavy Defensive Army was the largest of the army types and contained between 315 to 325 regiments spread across thirty-four divisions. These large formations were assigned to the Draconis Combine due to the need for a larger garrison force to counter the size and militarism of the Combine.\n\nA Mobile Army had the same composition as a standard army but included three times as many independent regiments, allowing them to respond more quickly to developing situations. All of the territorial armies and two of those assigned to the Free Worlds League were designated mobile armies.\n\nA Corps was charged with garrisoning a broad expanse of space. Their composition was fluid, the largest containing nine divisions and the smallest with only four, and were usually divided between 1-3 'Mech divisions, 2-7 infantry divisions, several independent regiments, as well as its own WarShips, transports, and support facilities. Each Corps was usually assigned 30 worlds to protect, though that number could go as high as 100.[5][8]\n\nA Division consisted of three brigades, reserves, combat and noncombat support units and an ASF Wing, although some had a brigade less or one extra. The division was the heart of the SLDF, usually charged with protecting a group of star systems within one jump radius, or one important system or planet. Divisions were usually classified as one of the following:[5][8]\n\nBattleMech Divisions consisted of two 'Mech brigades and one mechanized infantry brigade. These units were primarily considered for offensive operations.\n\nMechanized Infantry Divisions consisted of two mechanized infantry brigades and one 'Mech brigade. It was the most numerous type of unit and could participate in offensive and defensive operations, although the latter was their more usual function\n\nInfantry Divisions consisted of two nonmechanized infantry brigades and one light 'Mech brigade. Primarily defensive in nature they were also assigned to fight in terrain hazardous to mechanized forces, such as cities and mountains.\n\nJump Infantry Divisions consisted of two jump infantry brigades and one 'Mech brigade and two wings. Jump infantry were primarily used for quick-strike missions requiring speed and surprise.\n\nA Brigade consisted of 3 regiments. While 3 regiments was the ideal, this number varied throughout the history of the SLDF.[9][5]\n\nA Regimental Combat Team was a grouping of independent regiments, intended for rapid reaction faster than a relatively cumbersome division. Typically each Corps had four independent regiments grouped like this.\n\nSee also: Colossus (DropShip class)\n\nA Regiment consisted of 3 battalions and was classified as one of the following:[5][8][10]\n\nA BattleMech Regiment was typically organized as a Line Regiment, further classified as either Heavy Assault, Battle, or Striker depending on the role and weight class of their machines. Independent BattleMech Regiments were designed to operate on their own or with an infantry division against enemies too small to justify sending an entire 'Mech division. Therefore they also included non-'Mech components such companies of Jump Infantry or fighter squadrons. They were classified as Light Horse, Hussar or Dragoon depending on the role and weight class of their machines.\n\nCavalry, Armored, Aerospace and Naval (CAAN) regiments were independent Marine Corps regiments designed to operate on watery worlds, and so included blue water combat vehicles as well as 'Mechs, hovercraft and fighters.\n\nArmored Regiments were classified by their weight, Heavy, Medium, or Light, and subdivided by their motive type, whether Tracked, Wheeled or Hover. These regiments almost always consisted of just one or two types of design, though specialized battalions existed with divergent designs, and were usually attached to a division for anti-'Mech or assigned garrison duties. An armored division on defensive duties was usually assigned a battalion of mechanized infantry and engineers.\n\nArtillery Regiments had no separate classification. Each division was typically assigned a full regiment of self-propelled artillery, while some artillery regiments operated independently.\n\nInfantry Regiments were organized as Mechanized, Line, Jump or Motorized units. Mechanized regiments operated in APCs while motorized regiments used Infantry Fighting Vehicles, or IFVs, faster and more lightly armed than APCs. These regiments also contained organic armor support, typically one platoon of armor per infantry company plus an additional armor company per battalion. Line infantry had no organic transport.\n\nA Battalion usually consisted of at least three companies, also known as batteries if made up of artillery units. Some 'Mech battalions consisted of the same type of 'Mech, which helped greatly in reducing repair and maintenance problems. Occasionally, an artillery battalion would be assigned to a 'Mech or armored regiment for fire support, or attached to an independent regiment; special airmobile artillery batteries and companies had their own air transport assets for assault operations. Some armored battalions were highly specialized in their nature, with VTOL, scout/pathfinder and heavy assault types being the most common, and could be assigned at the division or even brigade level.[5][8] A Star League Reinforced Battalion had four companies of four lances each.[11]\n\nA Company usually consisted of at least three lances, or platoons if made up of infantry. BattleMech companies were almost always of the same type of 'Mech, though not necessarily the same variant. Occasionally mixed companies of 'Mechs were formed if its members had worked together through one of the Academies but qualified for different designs. These companies were assigned to independent regiments.[5][8]\n\nCombat Role[edit]\n\nGround units of the SLDF were classified and equipped depending upon role.[5][8]\n\nLine Regiments\n\nHeavy Assault BattleMech regiments consisted of mainly heavy-to-assault weight BattleMechs, with each battalion having a fourth company of artillery. The main assault force of the SLDF, most corps possessed at least a single Heavy Assault regiment.\n\nBattle BattleMech regiments were the core of most BattleMech brigades, consisting of medium-to-heavy weight 'Mechs.\n\nStriker BattleMech regiments were reconnaissance and breakthrough formations. Composed of light-to-medium weight 'Mechs, they were also the only Line unit which included organic aerial assets, a Recon company of Land-Air 'Mechs and usually pairs of ASF.\n\nIndependent Regiments\n\nDragoon BattleMech regiments were composed of heavy-to-assault weight 'Mechs, tanks and hovercraft, their primary purpose being to fight against well-equipped enemies. The independent equivalent of the heavy assault regiment, they typically reserved infantry for defensive operations.\n\nHussar BattleMech regiments were the most common of the independent regiments, composed of medium-to-heavy 'Mechs, tanks and hovercraft.\n\nLight Horse BattleMech regiments were primarily reconnaissance units, often the first one dropped onto a world to discover the enemy's strengths. Emphasizing light-to-medium weight 'Mechs and vehicles, at least two companies used dedicated information-gathering units like Ostscouts.\n\nRoyal regiments were nearly identical to Regular regiments, with two exceptions. Royal regiments consisted entirely of soldiers of Terran Hegemony birth. Further, Royal regiments were the initial beneficiaries of BattleTechnology innovations - all Royal regiments were equipped with the ultimate in weapons development. Royal regiments served as the backbone of which each military region's force was built around.[12]\n\nA list of SLDF commands is available.\n\nNavy[edit]\n\nWhile initially tied to individual divisions and corps, the reforms of Commanding Admiral David Peterson allowed for a measure of freedom for the Star League's WarShips. While some remained attached to the ground forces, and a few small or medium ships continued to operate alone or in pairs, others were combined in Squadrons of up to a dozen vessels capable of independent operation. A number of squadrons could combine into a Fleet.[10]\n\nA Line Squadron was the primary offensive formation of the Navy, packing both a terrific offensive punch and great resiliency, though not particularly agile. These squadrons were built around three or four battleships and/or carriers, protected by cruisers and frigates.\n\nA Pursuit Squadron contained ships which sacrificed a measure of defensive fortitude for the speed and firepower necessary to chase down fleeing vessels. Battlecruisers and cruisers were the core of these squadrons, though lighter ships sometimes took their place.\n\nAn Interdiction Squadron was the opposite of a pursuit squadron, designed less around chasing an opponent than containing them. As such they contained an eclectic mix of ships, from light corvettes to heavy cruisers, along with a contingent of marines and larger numbers of fighters and assault DropShips.\n\nA Fire-Support Squadron was attached to an Army formation, usually a corps though on occasion a division, to achieve space superiority and provide orbital bombardment. It consisted of a half-dozen cruisers and frigates, along with their supporting tenders.\n\nAn Escort Squadron consisted of cruisers and frigates with an effective mix of offensive, defensive and maneuverability traits, whose primary mission was the protection of other vessels.\n\nA Reconnaissance Squadron primarily served as intelligence gatherers, typically consisting of lightweight fast ships like corvettes and destroyers with the occasional cruiser, though in battle they also served as pickets for larger formations.\n\nA Transport Squadron was dedicated to carrying ground forces to and from the battlefield. In addition to the DropShips and JumpShips necessary for transporting the troops, these squadrons also contained regular WarShips such as destroyers, assault DropShips and fighters to protect them.\n\nA Science/Survey Squadron sought to expand humanity's knowledge and discover new worlds on missions which lasted months or even years. Anywhere from one to a dozen vessels constituted these types of squadrons, normally conventional DropShips and JumpShips though for hazardous duty they sometimes contained lighter WarShips.\n\nMilitary Regions[edit]\n\nGeneral Shandra Noruff-Cameron, the SLDF's first Commanding General, divided the member states into six Military Regions for organizational purposes.[12] The SLDF stationed an Army Group in the Capellan Confederation Military Region, Draconis Combine Military Region, Federated Suns Military Region, Free Worlds League Military Region, Lyran Commonwealth Military Region and Terran Military Region. The Periphery Military Region oversaw the Periphery nations as a whole, though eventually each Periphery nation was assigned its own military region.[13]\n\nCommanding Generals[edit]\n\nName Reign Rank Commanding Generals of the SLDF 2571-2801 Shandra Noruff 2571 - 2575 General Carlos Dangmar Lee 2575 - 2597 General Nicholas Kinnol 2597 - 2646 General Killian Squarn-Turk 2646 - 2680 General David Peterson 2680 - 2707 Admiral Ikolor Fredasa 2707 - 2729 General Rebecca Fetladral 2729 - 2738 General Aleksandr Kerensky 2738 - 2801 General\n\nMilitary Departments[edit]\n\nThe SLDF was organized into 15 different departments, or commands, each in charge of different aspects of organizing and managing the Star League's military forces. As it was the largest military organization in the history of humanity, each command faced unique challenges unlike their counterparts in the House armies. However, superior training and heavy reliance on computer technology allowed them to fulfill this role with as little as a third of the number of personnel required to run House military departments.[14]\n\nOperational Commands[edit]\n\nHigh[edit]\n\nHigh Command was responsible for control of the entire SLDF and presided over by the Commanding General or Admiral. When not in the field aboard a heavily modified battlecruiser, the Command's headquarters was the Citadel located next to the Court of the Star League. The Citadel was strong enough to survive an ASF ramming attack with insignificant damage and protected by a garrison of fighters and 'Mechs.[14]\n\nRegular Army[edit]\n\nThis Command was in charge of all ground forces, and was further divided into eight Sub-Commands: BattleMech, Armored, Trooper, Fighter, Artillery, Engineering, Resupply, and Planning and Strategy.[14]\n\nNaval[edit]\n\nThis Command was in charge of all space forces, and was further divided into six Sub-Commands: WarShip, DropShip, Naval AeroSpace, Transport, Marine Corps, and Planning and Strategy.[14]\n\nRoyal[edit]\n\nFormerly the High Command of the Hegemony Armed Forces, the Royal Command had two roles. The first was overseeing any issues or conflicts regarding Royal units within the army. The second, and less well-known role, was to act as a \"shadow\" High Command, issuing secret orders for Royal units to carry out.[14]\n\nSpecial Forces[edit]\n\nSpecial Forces Command held responsibility over all special units of the SLDF.[14] This included the Special Armed Services, an elite anti-terrorism organization with over 100 battalion-sized formations, also known as the Blackhearts because of the calling card they left behind on their victims' bodies.[15] The Blackhearts also made use of advanced Nighthawk power armor.\n\nSupport Commands[edit]\n\nIntelligence[edit]\n\nThis Command was given the duty of gathering and analyzing military intelligence. From human agents to remote asteroid listening posts gathering even the minutest detail, Intelligence Command maintained a fleet of disguised JumpShips to gather whatever facts were collected by these sources and deliver them to the relevant Intelligence Section for analysis.[14]\n\nSee also: Luyten 68-28 and Freedom Station\n\nMember-State Liaison[edit]\n\nMember-State Liaison Command served two different functions. The first was maintaining good relations between the SLDF and the Great Houses, with liaison officers stationed assigned to many bases located within member state territory. The second, and arguably more important, was the integration of new recruits from member states into the SLDF, ensuring they thought of themselves from then on as a citizen of the Star League, rather than of House Steiner or House Kurita.[14]\n\nReserve[edit]\n\nReserve Command was responsible for maintaining reservist formations and their supplies, as well as supervising garrison units on Hegemony worlds.[14]\n\nJudge Advocate General[edit]\n\nCharged with administering the SLDF's code of conduct, the Judge Advocate General Command was also in charge of worlds under martial law or rebellion. Military governors would remain in command of worlds until the situation had calmed enough to assign civilian administrators to take over.[14]\n\nAdministrative[edit]\n\nIn charge of the upper echelons of the SLDF bureaucracy, this Command had the responsibility of gathering and organizing records from all other Commands. It also ran many of the SLDF's military academies and boot camps.[14]\n\nMedical[edit]\n\nMedical Command was charged with the medical treatment and care of all SLDF soldiers. It maintained a fleet of medical vehicles, spacecraft and orbital stations, and had access to the most advanced medical technology in the Inner Sphere.[14]\n\nLogistical Commands[edit]\n\nReplacement-Deployment[edit]\n\nThe Replacement-Deployment Command held the responsibility of ensuring all units were at full strength. They were charged with transporting recruits to their newest assignment, as well as transporting the retired, wounded or dead back home.[14]\n\nQuartermaster[edit]\n\nThe Quartermaster Command, lead by the Director of the Quartermaster Command, was charged with the shipping of supplies and policing of military contractors to ensure full compliance with the law. This Command, in conjunction with the civilian Department of Economic Relations, also monitored the over 300 major and hundreds of smaller weapons manufacturers within the Star League. If a firm was found to have broken the law, such as sharing advanced technology with another member state, either organization had the right to seize control of the company.[14][16]\n\nTransport[edit]\n\nGiven the responsibility of organizing, regulating and tracking the transportation of men and matériel across the stars, Transport Command relied heavily on intricate timetables, constantly updated and coordinated through computer systems, to maintain quick and efficient delivery.[14]\n\nCommunications[edit]\n\nCommunications Command had, among its other duties, the most important role of maintaining the Star League's most closely guarded secret: portable hyperpulse generators.[14]\n\nMilitary Installations[edit]\n\nThe SLDF had thousands of military bases and supply depots spread throughout known space; each inhabited world was home to at least one of these installations. Of special importance were those installations built along three defensive rings designed to protect Terra. The first, known as the Home Circle, was built along the border of the Terran Hegemony. The second was built 250 light years from Terra, while the third was built 500 light years from Terra, along the border between the Inner Sphere and the Periphery. Bases along the third ring were the largest and best defended, and more evenly distributed, and most major bases along the defensive rings were home to divisions or major fleets.[17]\n\nBesides the well-known installations, hundreds, potentially thousands, of secret bases were also constructed. SLDF engineers went to great lengths to construct these hidden bases: leveling mountains, draining lakes, building islands in the middle of oceans, and camouflaging their work when construction was complete. Such was their skill that many of these installations have yet to be found, and while most were emptied prior to Operation EXODUS some still contain examples of lostech.[17]\n\nThe exact number of bases is unknown, but it appears to be huge; as an example, on Terra alone there were about 500 which survived the Amaris Coup, but ComStar never used more than 200 before the Word of Blake Jihad.[18]\n\nFort[edit]\n\nThe most common type of military installations, Forts were designed to support the soldiers and families of a single regiment. Complete with housing, communication facilities, repair bays and a spaceport, the amount and type of defensive fortifications would depend upon the hostility of its host world.[17]\n\nCastle[edit]\n\nReserved for important or rebellious worlds, Castles were built into mountainsides or beneath meters of concrete and included multiple secret tunnels.[17]\n\nCastle Brian[edit]\n\nMain article: Castle Brian\n\nThe most heavily defended of military installations, Castles Brian were first built along the Terran Hegemony's borders with its neighboring realms. Able to hold two brigades, the only sure way to eliminate one quickly was through heavy nuclear or orbital bombardment.[17]\n\nOutpost Castle[edit]\n\nVery similar to Castles Brian, Outpost Castles were built after the Reunification War to keep rebellious Periphery worlds in check.[17]\n\nPort Castle[edit]\n\nAnother variation of the Castles Brian, Port Castles included a spaceport built into the facility, allowing for relief during sieges. Because the spaceport presented a vulnerable spot in its defenses, few Port Castles were built.[17]\n\nMini-Castle[edit]\n\nA smaller version of the Castle Brian, only able to hold a single regiment. Some Castles Brian included several Mini-Castles to act as a first line of defense.[17]\n\nSupply Depot[edit]\n\nThe size and nature of a Supply Depot depended greatly upon the world it was built. On hostile worlds, most depots were built in secret or as part of a Fort or Castle.[17]\n\nNaval Base[edit]\n\nOver 500 Naval Bases serviced the SLDF, each orbital facility including shipyards, moorings, and housing. Protection was provided for by an ASF wing and two destroyers, although during the final decades that force increased to include a cruiser. One of most notorious was Camelot Command, in the Dark Nebula.[17]\n\nKnown Bases[edit]\n\nAntares base (unnamed). SLDF replenishment and resupply base in Lyran space. When Operation REVIVAL was launched in 3050, all information about this base had been lost to Inner Sphere. A small town, Alba, was built over the base. After conquering the planet, Clan Jade Falcon unearthed the huge base beneath the town, full of supplies.[19]\n\nFortress Dieron: Dieron military base, closed after the Exodus, still intact after the Jihad.\n\nDixie Castle Brian: discovered by treasure hunters in 3025 which incited an attack by Free Worlds League forces. However, almost all contents turned out to have decayed into uselessness. Some vintage SLDF laser pistol, and two barely salvageable BattleMechs were among the items retrieved.[20]\n\nHyner base, original name unknown: a military base deep inside Combine space. Probably looted by the Exodus fleet, in the thirty-first century it was totally empty, all surface buildings destroyed or buried. Only some underground tunnels were preserved.\n\nHelm Nagayan Mountain Facility: Naval base grounded, with enough BattleMechs to form several regiments, lots of supplies and the Helm Memory Core. The cache was believed destroyed when the Combine forces nuked the planet; in reality it survived in a hidden bunker which self-destructed in 3028.\n\nUnnamed base of Epsilon Eridani. Lost to history, during the Dark Age it was uncovered by the Blessed Order, who had heard rumors of his existence, turning it into their new headquarters \"Alpha Base\". Destroyed in the fighting between the Order and the Republic of the Sphere forces, in 3140.\n\nFort DelVillar: military base deep inside Combine space, on Toffen. An enormous base, it had a working HPG generator, the only one on the planet. Probably looted by Exodus fleet, in the thirty-first century was totally empty in 3062 was preserved, totally restored and used as Ghost Bear clan garrison on planet.\n\nRuins of Gabriel: Star League Naval base located near Odessa IV. Turned to Blakist base, was scuttled in 3075.\n\nThe Citadel, old Star League fortress on Caledonia, called Mount Alba by the natives, planetary governor's residence.\n\nThe \"Cavern of the Skull\", on New St. Andrews, in the periphery, was an SLDF base used later as headquarters by Stefan Amaris VII.\n\nOn the planet Crimond, the SLDF Fort Beaufort was located in a swamp area on the Condor continent, far away from the capital. It was still operative in the IlClan Era.[21]\n\nMilitary Academies[edit]\n\nOf the more than 200 accredited military academies within the Star League, over 100 of them were located on Terra. Of the rest, all but three were located within the Terran Hegemony: Sanglamore Academy, The Nagelring, and Albion Military Academy. The lack of any other foreign academies was due in part to tensions between the Star League and its member states.[22]\n\nSee Also: SLDF Academies\n\nTerran Academies[edit]\n\nThe Sandhurst Royal Military Academy in Berkshire, England, was considered one of the three foremost military academies known as the War Triad. This was in part because Michael Cameron, 2nd Director-General of the Hegemony, graduated from Sandhurst. Other notable Terran academies include, but are not limited to, West Point Military Academy, Malinovsky BattleMech and Tank Academy of Russia, Kreig Universitat of Germany, Frunze Military Academy, Annapolis Naval Academy, Kure Naval Academy of Japan, and Saint Cyr Military Academy of France.[22]\n\nIn addition, Intelligence Command administered their own academies on Terra: the Riley Intelligence College and the Samsovitch College of Intelligence Gathering.[14]\n\nWar Academy of Mars[edit]\n\nAnother member of the War Triad, the War Academy of Mars also functioned as the strategic headquarters of the SLDF.[22] Constructed in 2601, it was located in a huge canyon about 100 km southeast of Olympus Mons. In addition to vast complex of buildings, spaceports and battlefields, the cliffs of the canyon were hollowed out for additional room, including hangars and machine shops.\n\nIn the first months of the Amaris Civil War, the officers and cadets of the War Academy fought off the Twenty-third Republican Dragoons for six weeks until, in frustration, the Republican commander ordered a nuclear bombardment to wipe it out. The only surviving structures, a few sheltered buildings and some of the cliff-based hangars, were ransacked in the aftermath.[23]\n\nMilitary Academy of Aphros[edit]\n\nThe Military Academy of Aphros was the third member of the War Triad, located in Aphros, the capital of Venus.[24] Constructed in 2242, its primary responsibility was training fighter and DropShip pilots, as well as one of several institutions overseeing the Gunslinger Program during the First Hidden War.[22] The academy was destroyed during the first months of the Amaris Civil War by nuclear bombardment.\n\nCombat College of New Earth[edit]\n\nThe Combat College of New Earth was the first military academy built on an extrasolar world, New Earth. Constructed in 2331, the Combat College maintained a rivalry with Sandhurst Academy until it was destroyed in the Amaris Civil War.[22]\n\nFleet School of Keid[edit]\n\nThe third-largest naval academy, behind Annapolis and Kure, the Fleet School of Keid was responsible for training WarShip and JumpShip crews.[22]\n\nFlight Academy of Graham[edit]\n\nOne of the few schools that was both orbital and dedicated to training fighter pilots, the Flight Academy of Graham graduated over 2,000 pilots annually.[22]\n\nUniversity of Proserpina[edit]\n\nA very tradition-bound institution, the University of Proserpina was notable for graduating ten members of House Cameron. Indeed the basis of the university's unusual and rigid customs were formed by the actions of its Cameron graduates, resulting in officers with a very strong sense of snobbish superiority.[22]\n\nAwards[edit]\n\nMain article: Awards § The Star League\n\nRed Cross\n\nOrder of the Sword\n\nOrder of the Star ‎\n\nMedal of Valor\n\nOrder of the Palm\n\nMedal of Honor\n\nMedal of the Dove\n\nMcKenna Wheel\n\nMartial Olympiad[edit]\n\nMain article: Martial Olympiad\n\nThe Martial Olympiad was a series of mock combats held every four years from 2640 to 2736. The event was designed to test fighting skills and recognize the best units within the SLDF. It took place on the surface and in orbit above Mars, and later Outreach, and involved more than 100 \"events\" pitting regiments, divisions and spacecraft against each other. Precautions were made to prevent the loss of life, although deaths did occur, and while it was expensive to maintain the Olympiad was popular among troops as a way to display their skills and the public as a media event.[25]\n\nUniforms[edit]\n\nMain article: Uniforms of the SLDF\n\nThe uniforms of the SLDF were not only meant to identify the branch of service, rank and unit the soldier belonged to, but also foster esprit de corps. There famous stories of soldiers going to great lengths to protect their portable clothes-care machines to ensure their uniforms would not stay dirty, while the most shameful thing a soldier could do would be to commit a crime while wearing their uniform. In response citizens of the Star League gave soldiers in uniform great respect, and took to copying elements of their uniforms into business suits, jackets and dresses in what fashion designers called the \"Trooper Look.\" Pieces of SLDF uniforms would survive after the organization's demise in the uniforms of the five Great Houses.[26]\n\nRanks[edit]\n\nSLDF Military Rank Insignia ARMY NAVY Rank Insignia Rank Insignia Recruit Recruit Private Private Corporal Corporal Sergeant Sergeant Master Sergeant Master Sergeant Warrant Officer Warrant Officer Lieutenant Lieutenant Captain Captain Major Major Colonel Commodore Lieutenant General Rear Admiral Major General Vice Admiral General Admiral Commanding General Commanding Admiral\n\nReferences[edit]\n\nBibliography[edit]"
