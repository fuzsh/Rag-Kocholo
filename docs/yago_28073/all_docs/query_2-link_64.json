        "text": "FAQ\n\nHow can I arrange an airport wedding?\n\nIf you are interested in our offer, do not hesitate to contact us at svatby@prg.aero. Please tell us your expectations, planned date and number of people and our wedding coordinator will get back to you with an offer and a preliminary calculation. Organising an airport wedding works similarly as organizing a wedding at any other place. We recommend a personal meeting or a meeting through MS Teams to discuss the entire scenario and all the necessary details. We offer a free consultation and a free tour of the venue.\n\nWhat areas can we use for the wedding?\n\nThe airport has public and non-public areas and the wedding ceremony can take place in both of these zones.\n\nPublic area: the departure halls of Terminal 1 or 2 before security and passport control. These are areas where the check-in counters and the viewing terrace are located and are open to the public.\n\nNon-public area: the areas of the Terminal 1 or 2 departures behind the security and passport control. These are areas where the departure gates, airport VIP lounges and the apron viewing terrace are located and which are normally only accessible to departing passengers.\n\nWe will be happy to show you around the airport and introduce you to our exclusive areas.\n\nWe want to get married in a non-public area. How do we get there without a plane ticket?\n\nWe can arrange access to non-public areas of the airport. The administrative fee includes a one-time entry card for access to the airport for the engaged couple, the wedding party and the wedding guests, including the escort. To get these access cards, you must provide the necessary personal details to the wedding coordinator at least 48 hours before the wedding. The coordinator will explain the process and assist you. It is also necessary to allow time for arrival at the airport. All wedding guests must register before entering according to the instructions you will receive in due course.\n\nWhat is the maximum number of wedding guests?\n\nIt’s all up to you. We can organize small weddings with only witnesses as guests, and larger weddings for dozens of wedding guests. The wedding takes place at an international airport with the hustle and bustle of passengers, and therefore it is necessary to consider all measures related to the entry to the non-public areas of the airport. You must allow time for arrival at the airport due to the guest check-in process before entering the airport premises and certain security restrictions. You can only be on the airport premises with our escort.\n\nCan we choose an officiant by ourselves?\n\nOf course. Before booking your officiant, it is important to check if he or she can officiate a wedding at Václav Havel Airport Prague. All of our referrals have already been checked.\n\nCan we get snacks or lunch?\n\nYes, we offer a wide range of catering options. We are happy to talk about your expectations and we will create a custom offer for you.\n\nCan we choose an officiant by ourselves?\n\nYes, we offer a wide range of catering options.
