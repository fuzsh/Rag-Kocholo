        "text": "Havel was elected President of the Czech and Slovak Republic on 29 December 1989 after the successful ‘Velvet Revolution’ that put an end to the communist regime. He was then re-elected on 5 July 1990 after fully free and legitimate elections.\n\nIn July 1992, as tensions between Czechs and Slovaks grew, he resigned, saying his office was no longer in harmony with his convictions and dispositions. After that Vaclav Havel left public life for a few months. At the end of the year, however, when the onset of an independent Czech state was imminent, he ran again for the Presidency. In January 1993 he was elected first President of the Czech Republic.\n\nIn spring 1993, jointly with other heads of states, he participated in the dedication of the Holocaust Museum in Washington. Since then, he has worked towards NATO integration, which was achieved in early 1999. He sees this organisation as an instrument for democracy. Since the 1990s, when he gained the opportunity to travel freely, he has maintained an energetic schedule in foreign policy, travelling extensively. Nevertheless he has always insisted on maintaining close relations with his neighbouring countries.\n\nHavel is known for his outstanding opinions and his tireless promotion of Human rights, making great contributions to the democratic changes in his country and supporting his fellow activists worldwide.\n\nMoreover, he is a brilliant intellectual, playwright and essayist, having published numerous works before and since 1990. Havel’s writings and speeches are inspiring. He has given extraordianry addresses in various nations around the world. In his published work, he discusses spirituality and the mystery of Being. He has a global view on man and the earth, and he pleads for a new world order based on responsibility. He is the recipient of countless state decorations, international prizes, awards, and world-wide honorary doctorates.\n\nOn 27 January 1996, his wife Olga passes away, having been diagnosed with cancer. After undergoing an operation to improve his own health, Havel then married the actress Dagmar Veskrnova on 4 January 1997. On 20 January 1998, he was re-elected President of the Czech Republic, though very narrowly."
