        "text": "On Friday, the prime minister of the Czech Republic, Mr. Vladimir\n\nSpidla, collapsed during a session of Parliment. He is having a tough\n\ntime of it - classic aging population in a small country used to a\n\nhigh level of social services but no longer a tax base to support it\n\nsort of thing. End of last week, the Czechs finally had their EU\n\nCommissioner figured out (not an easy process) and everything was go\n\nspeed racer - and then the appointed EU Commissioner chickened out and\n\nresigned before he had ever started. Thus, I think, the collapse of\n\nMr. Spidla.\n\nOn Sunday, my wife and I were walking through the park on our way back\n\nfrom brunch, when we saw this phalanx of photographers walking\n\nbackwards, kneeling, shooting, walking backwards, etc. I thought, hey,\n\nmaybe Mr. Spidla is out! Yes indeed, that is who it was. He was taking\n\nhis official, \"I am not dead yet\" health of the Prime Minister and\n\nthus the country walk. He looked good, not great, but definitely not dead.\n\nNow he had maybe three body guards, each walking maybe thirty paces\n\naway from him. He was totally out in the open. While the park is right\n\nnext door to his official residence, I still had the feeling I was\n\nseeing something extraordinarily democratic - extraordinary due to its\n\nrarity in any democracratic country these days. The idea of that an\n\nexample of a free and open society would come from the Czech Republic,\n\na country which has had such difficulty with openness even in the\n\ndemocratic era, is quite restorative I think, especially in light of\n\nthe relatively recent deaths of Pim Fortuyn and Anna Lind. The\n\npolitician in public may be a vanishing presence I am afraid, but for\n\na moment, there he was. And his wife. And his dog.<div> </div>"
