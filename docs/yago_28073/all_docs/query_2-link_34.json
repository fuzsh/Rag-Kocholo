        "text": "Playwright and former Czech president Vaclav Havel withdrew his new drama Odchazeni (Leaving) from the National Theatre, which was to have produced the play in May 2008. The theatre refused to cast his wife, actress Dagmar Havlova, in a leading role. Meanwhile, other Czech as well as foreign theatres have expressed their interest in staging the long awaited play."
