        "text": "Havel’s entire life is too large a subject to cover properly in one film. The current biopic focuses on the years 1968–89, and attempts to capture part of the journey of the future president from the frivolous but successful playwright of the 1960s to becoming a human rights activist of the 1970s and then the leader of the Velvet Revolution and a global icon.\n\nThe screenplay, by director Slávek Horák and writer Rudolf Suchánek, took three years to create and mixes real events with some dramatic license. The director said the film is not intended to be a textbook. This is Horák’s second film as a director. His 2015 film Home Care (Domácí péče) was the Czech entry for the Best Foreign Film category, but was not nominated.\n\nA: I really enjoyed preparing for it. I usually shoot with people who take care of the preparation. And even here we were very careful. We prepared for a long time, read the script, and went through an acting workshop together with Slávek and Viktor. That came in handy. It’s different on the set; you don’t have time to deal with things that much. Preparation, where we all analyze everything, discuss who plays whom, what he knows about him, who he talks about, and from whom who draws resources, is my favorite part of filming.\n\nA: I really enjoyed looking at Viktor Dvořák because he really looks like Havel. Sometimes I narrowed my eyes and said to myself, “That’s unbelievable; I’m filming with Havel!” So he really enjoyed [working with] me. Cigarettes were difficult for me. That was very challenging, just like for Viktor.\n\nA: That’s a little distorted. About a year or two before I knew anything about this film, I thought that if I adored Havel as I did, I should know more about him. So I read books about Havel, his stuff, and in the end, it was really was preparation in advance; I had a more comprehensive view of him. I wasn’t preparing for Olga, I was dealing with Havel. When Slávek sent me the script and I was offered the role of Olga, I was moved. It is interesting that what I took away from the books myself and what I was most interested in was also in the script.\n\nA: With Olga, it is interesting and in a way admirable how modest she was. She didn’t go anywhere. It’s very difficult to find any conversations with her. … She was such a lady-lumberjack. But that’s just my idea of it composed of different fragments. I also read two books about her, by Pavel Kosatík and by Anna Freimanová, and from all the possible information I was looking for, I made a picture. Meeting Anna Freimanová was crucial.\n\nA: It’s complicated with Olga, she’s mysterious, you don’t know much about her. It has such a nice contrast. She is an ordinary girl from Žižkov, she trained at Baťa [shoe factory], she was sharp, vigorous, practical and yet she functioned like a queen, like a noble aristocrat, a beautiful and dignified woman.\n\nShe wasn’t an introvert, she was just closed off. She didn’t let people in too much. Or at least the ones she didn’t want. On the other hand, she organized many events in Hrádeček [the village where Havel had a cottage], various happenings, and parties. When Havel was in prison, she took over a samizdat publisher with [brother-in-law] Ivan [Havel], and she wrote a play herself. It must have been so much fun. … She was a very strong person overall.\n\nA: I don’t want to compare myself to her. I cannot. I admire her too much and, unlike her, I am, unfortunately, a relatively strong egoist. … Sometimes I deliberately push people further. Sometimes they think I’m arrogant, but I don’t care. A person can look at life and look for a situation or people who give life a chance. We only live once, and [it should be] on the edge. So people I don’t like know it very quickly. And I leave situations I don’t want to experience. I don’t want to deal with the opinions of people who do not even seek agreement’ there is no time for that.\n\nA: Positive heroes often make a mistake in life or in a story that will only lead them on the right path. Based on such failures, a person changes, and this motivates them to positive behavior. Conversely, some “negatives” are somewhere in the beginning for fragile beings who have been wounded by something and have not managed [to deal with] this blow of fate. This does not excuse them, but it is very interesting to watch such stories.\n\nI didn’t know about Havel’s “failure” for a long time, how he felt, which was in connection with his first arrest and first imprisonment. It’s not a big failure, but he blamed himself. Everyone, no matter how great a genius and who is stronger, has human weaknesses. Everyone lives with their shadow, and these shadows and weaknesses are as important as the positive things that shape us. Being able to accept your shadow is essential for life.\n\nA: I met Olga a few times, and once during a premiere, I was introduced to her together with [actress] Táňa Vilhelmová. From what I think of her now, we probably weren’t interesting partners in the conversation. We were young girls then, actresses, and I don’t think we were interesting to her.\n\nA: I met Václav Havel several times, during his birthday celebrations, at various exhibitions, at [the theater] Na Zábradlí, etc. What was beautiful about him was how he was accessible to people; he liked to have fun. I remember his last birthday in [modern art venue] DOX, which was still charming. And we also saw each other at an audition for his [2011] film [Leaving (Odcházení)], where he didn’t choose me.\n\nMy favorite experience with him was during the Karlovy Vary Film Festival when he wrote us an amnesty on a receipt from the bar. At that time, Pavel Liška and I had some trouble with the police for breaking the night’s peace, and he pardoned us on the receipt. The so-called Karlovy Vary Amnesty. It was fun, of course.\n\nA: We were there at night. We didn’t see the people below us in the movie. It was a filming trick. We waved to a green screen they stretched out there. The technical side of filming can be boring; it’s often intangible.\n\nWhat was touching, I don’t know if the scene made it into the film, was when Olga asked, “Why don’t you want Havel to be president?” And she replies, “Because I love him.” She was aware of what awaited her. She knew that Václav had to be president, but at the same time she didn’t want it. She knew her whole life would change. She didn’t want all those receptions, but she knew it had to be, even if it bothered her.\n\nShe really didn’t want to be seen, which is weird. Almost all of us want to be seen. I also have my extroverted position, I need to somehow communicate with the outside world. She was different and I don’t know many people like that.\n\nA: Beautiful. Viktor is a sweet, calm, and kind man. There was an element of nursing and motherhood in Havel’s relationship [with Olga]. And also with us. Not because of his age, but Viktor is mainly a theater actor, and his film experience is not as great as mine. Work in theater and film is different, so we often discussed different procedures together, discussed, and thus got a little closer to their relationship. Plus, he’s got disarming laughter, so you feel like laughing to hear that laughter."
