        "text": "Former Czech president and hero of the Velvet Revolution Vaclav Havel, who steered his country to independence from Soviet rule in 1989, died on Sunday at the age of 75, his office said.\n\nMr Havel died in his sleep at dawn after a lengthy illness, his secretary Sabina Tancevova said.\n\n\"In his last moment, his wife Dagmar was with him, together with one of the nuns who have been taking care of him in recent months,\" Ms Tancevova said.\n\nMr Havel, president of Czechoslovakia from 1989 to 1992 and of the successor Czech Republic from 1993 to 2003, had long battled poor health, partly caused by the five years he spent in communist jails.\n\nThe playwright and former dissident had grappled with breathing problems since he had part of his lung removed in 1996 to stop cancer.\n\nCzech prime minister Petr Necas paid tribute to Mr Havel.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"President Havel was a symbol of what happened here in 1989, he did a great deal for this country, for its peaceful switch to democracy,\" he said.\n\n\"He was the symbol and face of our republic abroad.\"\n\nGerman foreign minister Guido Westerwelle hailed him as \"the soul of the Czech revolution\".\n\nMr Havel's health problems stemmed from a poorly treated case of pneumonia he suffered while he was jailed by the communist regime in the 1980s for dissident activity.\n\nPart of his right lung was removed in December 1996 after cancer was detected. The former chain smoker has also suffered repeated lung and heart problems and underwent surgery for a pulmonary inflammation in 2009.\n\nEarlier this year, Mr Havel was taken to hospital with acute bronchitis, from which he had never seemed to fully recover.\n\nThe illness also caused \"a loss of balance, memory loss and weight loss,\" he said in an interview.\n\nThis summer, Mr Havel retreated to his house in the countryside to convalesce and last returned to Prague to meet Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama on December 10.\n\nMr Havel was born in Prague on October 5, 1936 into a wealthy family which lost its assets as the communists took power in 1948.\n\nHe established himself as a leading figure on the scene of the Czechoslovak 'theatre of the absurd' in the 1960s, before being banned from theatres after the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968.\n\nHe was responsible for drawing up Charter 77, a 1977 manifesto challenging the communists to live up to their international promises to respect human rights, and he kept fighting the regime which earned him five years in prison.\n\nAs communism was toppled in the peaceful Velvet Revolution, Mr Havel was the first-choice man to take the top job in Czechoslovakia, which split peacefully into the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993.\n\nMr Havel married actress Dagmar Veskrnova, 20 years his junior, in 1997, following the death of his first wife Olga a year earlier. He had no children."
