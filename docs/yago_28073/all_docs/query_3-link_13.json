        "text": "We are an international academic community interested in cultural dissent under Socialism in Eastern Europe.\n\nWe think that culture in Eastern Europe before 1989 meant more than socialist realism and dull propaganda art: at certain times and places alternative cultural scenes flourished despite the strict controls of socialist regimes.\n\nWe do research that tackles this rich and colourful legacy of cultural opposition in the former socialist countries of Eastern Europe by exploring and comparing collections on cultural opposition.\n\nWe tell stories of non-conformist avant-garde art, anti-establishment religious movements, civic initiatives for unofficial education and publication, dissident movements, underground punk and rock bands, alternative ways of life, even novel spiritual practices, and many more.\n\nWe create the first digital database of both online and offline private and public collections in Europe which testify to the survival of various forms of cultural opposition in the former socialist countries.\n\nWe show how these collections work, what functions they serve in their respective societies, and how they represent their holdings and findings to the national and international public.\n\nWe will recognize forms of dissent during the communist regimes and preserve these as part of our common European heritage.\n\nWe want to turn cultural dissent alive.\n\nWATCH THE VIDEO\n\nCOURAGE (“Cultural Opposition – Understanding the CultuRal HeritAGE of Dissent in the Former Socialist Countries”) is a three-year international research project funded by Horizon 2020, the EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation.\n\nBasic info\n\nCOURAGE\n\nCultural Opposition: Understanding the Cultural Heritage of Dissent in the Former Socialist Countries\n\nGrant agreement No: 692919\n\nProject Website: http://cultural-opposition.eu/\n\nStarting Date of Action: 1 February 2016\n\nEnd Date of Action: 31 January 2019\n\nNumber of Partners: 12\n\nEstimated eligible costs (EUR): 2 484 917.50\n\nTopic: Cultural opposition in the former socialist countries\n\nType of action: Research and Innovation action\n\nCall: H2020-REFLECTIVE-2014-2015/H2020-REFLECTIVE-SOCIETY-2015\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/topics/reflective-4-2015.html\n\nThis project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 692919.\n\nCounterculture, Dissent and Cultural Opposition in the Former Socialist Countries in Eastern Europe\n\nCOURAGE presents a cross-Europe documentary film festival series.\n\nStops of the Film Festival:\n\nBudapest, 1-2 June 2018\n\nPrague, 30 Sept-5 Oct 2018\n\nWarsaw, 7-9 Sept 2018\n\nGreifswald, 16-24 Oct, 2018\n\nZagreb, 19-21 Oct 2018\n\nBratislava, 7-10 Nov 2018\n\nBucharest, 16-17 Nov 2018\n\nFilm screening in the building of the European Research Council in Brussels:\n\nA Journey to the Eastern European Underground with Award Winner Films.\n\nBrussels, 28 January 2019\n\nTrailer of the Film Festival:\n\nFILMS\n\nNenad Puhovski │ Generation ‘68 │ 2016 │ 85 min │ HRV\n\nHomage to a generation. The creator still shares the youthful enthusiasm of his generation, and he nurtures the idea of a revolution that will change the world. A revolution that remains “realistic and demands the impossible”. The Croatian film poses the question: how did the events of the era affect ordinary lives and society, and it shows what later generations can do with this legacy.\n\nStephan Coates & Paul Heartfield│ Roentgenizdat│ 2017 │ 25 min │ RUS/USA\n\nCold War era Leningrad: Soviet Russia has declared jazz, rock ‘n’ roll and other genres of music illegal, but the people have responded. Giving blood every week to earn enough money to buy a recording machine, Rudy Fuchs began copying forbidden records to be sold on street corners by shady dealers…\n\nMirosław Dembiński│ Orange Alternative│ 1988 │ 22 min │ POL\n\nIn 1982, graffiti images of orange dwarfs appeared on the walls of buildings in Wrocław. They “migrated” to other cities too. These dwarfs emerged as the symbol of the countercultural formation “Pomar Alternativa” (Orange Alternative).\n\nMiroslav Janek │ Olga │ 2014 │ 84 min │ CZE\n\nThe police couldn’t break her, the castle didn’t change her: the remarkable story of Václav Havel’s reluctant first lady. Olga was a key intellectual in the 1950s and 1960s, who read his husband’s texts with a critical eye, and supported him in the hardest times. The documentary sheds light on the era in which Olga lived and on Olga herself presenting her highly original thoughts and memorable way of speaking.\n\nMária Takács │ Hot Men Cold Dictatorships │ 2015 │ 88 min │ HUN\n\nWhat was it like to be a gay man before the regime change? Where and how could one get to know others? Were gay men kept under surveillance by the system? How did groups of friends develop in the decades? How did the regime change usher in change, and how did gay movement rise in Hungary? To find answers to thee questions, four young gay men hit the road.\n\nNenad Milošević│ The Other Line│ 2016 │ 108 min │ SRB\n\nWhy were the most creative and progressive artists in Yugoslavia silenced? Why are they still silenced today? The answers presented in this film are the results of ten years of hard work. They show us the exceptional avant-garde art scene of Novi Sad (concept art, experimental music, poetry) which emerged during the late 1960s and 1970s as a cultural melting pot of innovative Yugoslav nonconformist culture.\n\nEllin Hare│ From Us to Me: Life in East Germany Then and Now│ 2016 │ 87 min │ UK\n\nIn 1987, a British film crew gained unprecedented access and was able to film everyday life inside the GDR – but only the side of life that the state let them see. 25 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall the crew returned to the places and people they had visited at the time to see how their lives have changed and how they recall the “workers’ paradise”.\n\nKeith Jones│ Vinyl Generation│ 2016 │ 72 min │ CZE/USA\n\nIn 1980s communist Czechoslovakia an emerging generation took inspiration from alternative culture, including punk rock and the neo-avantgarde, to create their own worldview, politics, and, eventually, a revolution leading to regime change. 25 years later, this unique generational perspective, more relevant than ever, is explored for the first time.\n\nSlavomír Zrebný│Footprints in the Snow│ 2015 │ 53 min │ SVK/CZE\n\nHarmless tourists or enemies of the system? The documentary is an exciting inquiry into how forbidden literature was smuggled to Czechoslovakia under the communist dictatorship. Why did people put their own freedom at risk in order to help preserve the inner freedom of others?\n\nEkaterina Minkova│ Next Stop: Odeon Cinema│ 2015 │ 69 min │ BGR\n\nSofia, Odeon Cinema: a legendary place. The city’s only archive cinema opened in 1961. Who were the guests of Odeon over the course of its existence? How did film censorship work under communism? The documentary opens a window to the Bulgarian urban culture of the past six decades.\n\nEszter Turán & Anna Koltay│ BP Underground│ 2017 │ 52 min │ HUN\n\nBudapest around 1989: concerts in stuffy basements and ruined “houses of culture” filled with sweaty youngsters in search of meaning in their lives. This film recalls the golden age of the Hungarian hardcore/punk subculture, and it asks what happened to this culture. How did the scene affect society, and what role did Budapest play in the history of punk? Which were the best bands, clothing shops, cultic pubs? What ideas did this environment creat and how have these ideas shaped thinking in Hungary up to the present day?\n\nAndrzej Wolski│ Józef Czapski: Witness of the Century, 1896-1993│ 2016 │ 58 min │ POL\n\nPainter and writer Józef Czapski was a towering figure of Polish exile. Once a follower of Cézanne, he witnessed the Russian Revolution, fought for the Polish case, was taken as a POW, and lived in post-war Paris, where he edited the most significant Polish émigré journal, Kultura. Take a journey through European history by learning about his extraordinary life.\n\nIlinca Calugareanu│ Chuck Norris vs Communism│ 2015 │ 80 min │ ROM/UK\n\nThe illegal importation of American action and religious films on VHS cassettes was a common practice in Romania during the Ceaușescu era. Since there was no official dubding, all the actors had the same voice. The most famous voice of these dubbed films was Irina Margareta Nistor, who was the voice in Romanian of an array of American stars. This film recreates the epoch’s depressing and, at the same time, sweet-and-sour atmosphere.\n\nRossen Elezov│ Colors of the Voice│ 2015 │ 88 min │ BGR\n\nA polyphonic sound captivates listeners. But what if an acappella choral performance is the work of a single person – the great jazz singer Yildiz Ibrahimova? Through the dramatic twist and turns of her life and music, we see shocking footage of the expulsion of the Bulgarian Turks across the border and the tragedy of their ruined lives.\n\nGiedre Zickyte│ Master and Tatyana│ 2015 │ 78 min │ LIT\n\nA story about a rebellious genius of photography, Vitas Luckus, and his passionate love for Tatyana Luckiene. Vitas was an extremely colourful personality: he kept a live lion in his apartment and he was among the first to document the flawed realities of the Soviet Union. A story about love and infidelity, freedom and conformity, hope and frustration, lies and the search for truth."
