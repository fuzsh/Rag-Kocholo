        "text": "The source you quoted, Vik, discusses sentences about people and their occupations, so the assumed degree of celebrity is one possible reason for choosing between a definite or indefinite or zero article. But it's certainly not the only possible reason. For example, sentences (3) and (4) might not suggest that \"John Black is quite a famous archer\" at all! The definite article might be used simply because the archer has been previously mentioned (a standard use of the definite article, as I'm sure you know): he may in fact be the least famous archer in the world.\n\nI'm afraid I find the answer given on that site rather misleading. (Still, I see 'longman' in the URL, so perhaps I shouldn't be surprised. )\n\nAlthough it's essentially about articles with appositives, the writer also refers to the need (or not) for commas. Unfortunately he or she is very inconsistent, as you noticed in the case of the claim that (7) is \"like (3) and (4)\". But for (3) and (4) it's said that \"you need the comma\", and yet (7) doesn't have one! Well spotted, Vik! The same inconsistency occurs in (5), where \"baseball player, Joe DiMaggio\" (with a comma) is given as similar to \"archer John Black\" (no comma)\n\nWhat the writer doesn't mention at all is that a comma in such sentences indicates that what follows is (grammatically) non-restrictive:\n\n- \"He was shot by the archer, (whose name, by the way, was) John Black.\" — Even without that added fact, the main statement, \"He was shot by the archer\", stands in its own right.\n\n- \"He was shot by John Black, (who, by the way, was) the archer.\" — Even without the added fact, the main statement, \"He was shot by John Black\", stands in its own right.\n\nWithout a comma, the noun phrase in apposition is restrictive:\n\n- \"The drama was written by the playwright Vaclav Havel.\" Here the playwright's name isn't incidental. It's essential to the main statement. \"The drama was written by the playwright\" wouldn't make much sense on its own. In effect \"the playwright Vaclav Havel\" can be considered as a single noun phrase: so no comma.\n\n\"He was shot by archer John Black.\n\n[...]\n\nDo I correctly understand that we may put article THE here -- and the meaning will still remain the same?\n\nFor me, yes, and yes. The form without \"the\" is a similar construction to that of a title or rank (archer John Black, Colonel James White), and this may be the idea lurking behind sentence (8) in your link (\"... playwright Vaclav Havel before he became President Vaclav Havel\") — but personally I don't feel that the presence or absence of \"the\" makes any real difference here. As Parla says, it's optional in this case.\n\nWs\n\nThank you Parla\n\nand Ws for such a detailed answer!\n\nA couple of questions\n\n1)\n\nThe form without \"the\" is a similar construction to that of a title or rank (archer John Black, Colonel James White),\n\nYes, I thought this was the only way of saying \"occupation/rank + name\". So when we say \"He was shot by THE archer John Black\", 'the' refers to 'archer' only. The same way when you say \"you need the preposition ON here\" (THE refers to 'preposition'). Am I right?\n\n2)\n\nThe same inconsistency occurs in (5), where \"baseball player, Joe DiMaggio\" (with a comma) is given as similar to \"archer John Black\" (no comma)\n\nThis thing is confusing me. The whole sentence is:\n\n\"She was married to baseball player, Joe DiMaggio.\"\n\nBut, as you said, \"a comma in such sentences indicates that what follows is (grammatically) non-restrictive\". Hence: \"She was married to baseball player.\" is supposed to work on its own, right? Without an article...?"
