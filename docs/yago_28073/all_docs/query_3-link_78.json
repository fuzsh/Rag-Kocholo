He died Dec 18 at age 75.\n\nHavel’s widow Dagmar, his brother Ivan and other family members and friends attended a private ceremony at Prague’s Vinohrady cemetery on Wednesday – exactly 15 years after Havel married Dagmar.\n\nThe urn was placed to rest alongside his first wife, Olga, who died in 1996.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Britain’s Prime Minister David Cameron were among the world leaders who attended Havel’s state funeral on Dec 23.\n\nOriginally Published: January 4, 2012 at 8:29 a.m."
