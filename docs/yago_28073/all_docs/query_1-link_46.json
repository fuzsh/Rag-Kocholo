        "text": "The Lucerna Palace has seen better days. A faded fin de siecle pile just off Prague's famous Wenceslas Square, it features a splendid art nouveau movie theater (the city's oldest), a lavish ballroom, shopping arcades and seedy cafes.\n\nThe Lucerna was built by a certain Vaclav Havel and now constitutes an acute embarrassment to the architect's namesake and grandson, the Czech president and human rights hero who had a close brush with death six months ago.\n\nThe Lucerna's style _ decaying elegance _ and prime city-center location make it a property developer's dream in the chaotic, fast-buck culture that is 1990s Prague. But the palace has become a nightmare for its owners. It's the focus of an ugly property dispute which has riven Prague's first family and dulled the hero's shining reputation for moral probity.\n\nThe cast in the Lucerna soap opera features two brothers, two women both called Dagmar and a sleek millionaire businessman who was once a communist spy. The two brothers are Vaclav Havel, Eastern Europe's philosopher-president, and Ivan, a retiring, ponytailed mathematician. The two Dagmars are the president's wife of six months and Ivan's wife, between whom there is no love lost. The millionaire ex-spy is Vaclav Junek, boss of Chemapol, once a large communist company dealing in oil and weapons.\n\nThe Lucerna, built by Grandfather Havel between 1907 and 1915, was nationalized by the Communists in 1948 and reverted to family ownership after 1989's \"Velvet Revolution.\" It's worth an estimated $12.8-million, split between Vaclav and Ivan.\n\nTired of family feuding over what to do with the palace, Ivan gave his share to his wife. Then, shortly after Vaclav stunned the country by secretly marrying well-known actress Dagmar \"Dasa\" Veskrnova in January, he shocked the nation further by going public on the property dispute.\n\nHis sister-in-law, he said in a radio interview in May, was a liar, a mentally unstable woman who was talking nonsense. The in-laws couldn't agree what to do with the Lucerna, so the president sold his share to Junek for $6.4-million.\n\nIf you were looking for a caricature of the type of career apparatchik representing everything that Vaclav Havel has fought against all his days, you might alight on Junek.\n\n\"It's an unbelievable betrayal,\" says Vladimir Mlynar, the editor of the weekly journal Respeckt. \"Junek is the symbol of the fierce, unscrupulous communist-capitalist turncoat. President Havel doesn't need to do deals with the likes of him.\".\n\nUnder the Communists, who jailed Havel for four years, Junek was stationed in Paris as a Chemapol executive, working for the Czech secret police and, effectively, the KGB. He prospers under the new regime, too, as millionaire boss of privatized Chemapol.\n\nHavel, by contrast, after triumphing over the Communists, has long subscribed to the Bob Dylan apercu that \"money doesn't talk, it swears.\" He uses his patrician radio addresses to the nation every week to berate his countrymen and promote a kinder culture: \"Are people also not beings who would willingly exchange three privatization funds for one kind smile or a tender touch?\" he pondered at the beginning of the year.\n\nThe Czechs still adore their president, the mischievous, diminutive Bohemian who took to riding a child's scooter around Prague Castle, drinking and smoking with Frank Zappa and Keith Richard, while also reading the riot act to western statesmen, accusing them of complacency and cowardice.\n\nSeven years after spearheading the revolution, the former absurdist playwright still makes Czechs proud to be Czech. He's the sole dissident hero of 1989 in Central Europe who has remained in power. And if he's fit and keen enough to run again for the presidency next year, he'll win easily.\n\nBut while Czechs are still enormously fond of their president, his poll ratings have dropped from an all-time high of 80 percent last year to around 66 percent currently._ still by far the most popular public figure.\n\nFairly or unfairly, the drop is due to the perceived influence of his second wife, Dasa Veskrnova, whom the media depict as a pushy, brassy blonde, fond of expensive designer gowns and eager to hog the limelight. The president's first wife, Olga, who died last year, was unglamorous, unfussy and widely respected.\n\nThe beer halls and hairdressing salons of Prague are alive with lewd jokes about the new first lady, who is blamed for egging Havel on in the Lucerna feud and for other gaffes. \"Everyone was shocked to learn that he was obviously having an affair with her for ages and her influence is awful. She's so rude,\" says a young, professional woman.\n\nHavel breached a Czech taboo by marrying Veskrnova at a secret ceremony on Jan.\n\n4, before a year had passed since Olga's death, and just as he was recovering from lung cancer and pneumonia that nearly killed him.\n\nThe verdict on the streets is that an ambitious Veskrnova demanded a quick marriage because she feared he would die. Havel instantly countered the public misgivings: \"Nothing can be done about it. Anyone who knows me even slightly knows that all my life I have always done only what I saw as the right thing to do, regardless of whether people like it or not.\"\n\nHer role during the extraordinary events which attended Havel's hospitalization has left eyebrows permanently raised in Prague. During the four-week drama, she was the key figure, hectoring the country's top surgeons, demanding he be moved to a better hospital, bringing in a faith-healer, denouncing the conditions and equipment and stating that Havel had been turned into \"an attraction\" for hospital staff and visitors to gawk at. Throughout that time she was not the first lady, yet.\n\nWhen it was all over and Havel was out of danger, he snubbed the surgeons who saved his life by publicly thanking only his wife and one of the dozen doctors who treated him.\n\nHavel, once a 40 cigarette-a-day man, no longer smokes, though he seems to be drinking moderately again, and his doctor says he is reasonably fit.\n\nMore than ever since the heady days of 1989-90, the country needs Havel. Several years of strong government in Prague are yielding to instability, economic crisis and political paralysis, putting a premium on Havel as the dependable figure up in the castle.\n\n\"The political situation makes Havel more of a player and he is more politically active again,\" says Michal Zantovsky, one of the leaders of the three-party government. \"He is someone we trust as a moral authority.\""
