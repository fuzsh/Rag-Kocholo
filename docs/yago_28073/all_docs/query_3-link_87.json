        "text": "Hey there, time traveller!\n\nThis article was published 03/01/2012 (4615 days ago), so information in it may no longer be current.\n\nPRAGUE – The urn carrying Vaclav Havel’s ashes has been buried at his family plot at a cemetery in the Czech capital of Prague.\n\nHavel was the dissident playwright who led the 1989 revolution that toppled four decades of communist rule before becoming the country’s president. He died Dec 18 at age 75.\n\nHavel’s widow Dagmar, his brother Ivan and other family members and friends attended a private ceremony at Prague’s Vinohrady cemetery on Wednesday — exactly 15 years after Havel married Dagmar.\n\nThe urn was placed to rest alongside his first wife, Olga, who died in 1996.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Britain’s Prime Minister David Cameron were among the world leaders who attended Havel’s state funeral on Dec 23."
