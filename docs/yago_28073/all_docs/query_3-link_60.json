        "text": "The incredible has become a reality, and yesterday, we together unveiled my new anamorphic sculpture of V√°clav Havel at V√°clav Havel Airport Prague I'm terribly tired; I haven't slept much in the last month, but I must say I'm really happy. Among other things, it's because it's finished now, and I can go take a nap. But I can manage a few more words and share with you a cool photo taken from the right angle with my little creation, photographed by Andrej Boleslavsk√Ω . I created the installation using more than 3,000 authentic items and period documents that narrate the life story of V√°clav Havel. The overwhelming majority of these things were gifted to me by you and many friends and people I reached out to during the four months I worked on the installation. Thanks to this, the sculpture gained a very significant dimension for me, and from a certain moment, I started calling it a \"national\" sculpture, which is indeed written on it. . In addition to individuals, I also approached all the institutions and foundations bearing V√°clav Havel's name, as his living legacy continues to help people even though Havel is no longer with us. You can find many of Havel's books from the V√°clav Havel Library Knihovna V√°clava Havla , gifts from the Dagmar and V√°clav Havel VIZE 97 Foundation, the Committee of Good Will - Olga Havlov√° Foundation, Charta 77 Foundation, and Konto Bari√©ry Foundation, as well as items from the Na Z√°bradl√≠ Theater and Pivovar Trutnov, where Havel worked, and even beer coasters from the Pivnice u Zlat√©ho tygra pub. . I thank all those involved for their gifts and support in the project! I also dedicated some of my personal items and a few things from our family to the installation. The installation is full of stories from Havel's life, but I'll save the commentary for another time. The commented tour takes about 40 minutes. üòä . Come to visit Prague Airport and see him in person, it is on arrivals, terminal 2."
