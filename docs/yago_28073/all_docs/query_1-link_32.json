        "text": "It has been awaited with suspense for almost two decades, by theatres and audiences alike - a new drama by the Czech playwright Vaclav Havel, whose celebrated writing career was abruptly interrupted when he was elected to be his country's president.\n\nBut it now looks like the wait for a fresh Havel work will be further prolonged following his decision to pull his latest play from Prague's National Theatre after its refusal to allow his wife to play the lead role.\n\nHavel, 70, who retired from the presidency four years ago, insists he wrote the drama Odchazeni (Leaving) especially for his wife, Dagmar Havlova. If she cannot star in it, he says, he will take it to another stage.\n\nOdchazeni is about the problems a former high-ranking politician has in relinquishing the trappings of power. Some have accused Havel of being equally high-handed in his dogged insistence that Havlova should be allowed to embody the role.\n\nBut Havel, whose plays were banned under the communist regime and who spent years in and out of prison for his dissident activities, has passionately defended his position, saying his wife's presence in the play would be only natural because for years he had promised her they would one day cooperate on stage and she gave him the motivation for writing it.\n\n\"She was present when I was writing it in the US some months ago, she lived [the presidency] alongside me, I wrote it for her, I imagined her being in it,\" the former dissident, who led the Velvet Revolution of 1989, told the daily Lidove Noviny. \"We wanted to return to the theatre together.\"\n\nSome have put the row down to the Czech public's chronic lack of sympathy towards Havlova, whom Havel married less than a year after the death of his wife Olga. Mr Havel recently admitted he had begun an affair with the actor seven years previously.\n\nHavlova, 54, who under her maiden name Veskrnova was a popular comedy actor for stage and film - and who in her most controversial role played a topless racing driver who turns into vampire - has called the row \"undignified and embarrassing\". She independently announced her withdrawal from the project, with which she said she had assisted Havel.\n\n\"Vaclav told me years ago that he was writing this play first and foremost for me,\" she said in an interview. \"I was there during the creation of the play, I read the first drafts, suggested new ideas and gave him inspiration. We debated its title together.\" She described the play as a \"beautiful, unique drama, the best Vaclav has ever written\".\n\nShe denied reports that the row had stemmed from her unreasonable financial demands.\n\nBut the National Theatre, which was due to stage the premiere, has insisted that it is the theatre's policy not to allow guest actors. It said it would fight to win back Havel.\n\n\"The National Theatre would still like to perform the newest Vaclav Havel drama, and we will try to open new talks,\" the director, Ondrej Cerny, said.\n\nMeanwhile other theatres are lining up to offer their stages instead, including Havel's former theatre, Divadlo na Zabradli (Theatre on the Balustrade), where he worked as a stagehand during his dissident days.\n\nThroughout his 14-year presidency, Havel spoke repeatedly about his desire to return to playwriting. But on leaving office he said he realised his dream had been a \"complete illusion\" because he still had too many responsibilities on the world stage as a human rights fighter and politician.\n\nSince leaving office in 2003 he has concentrated mainly on fighting for human rights in countries such as Belarus, Cuba and Burma and has struggled to find time to write.\n\nSo eagerly has the arrival of Odchazeni been awaited that it has been treated by its publisher and those close to Havel with the secrecy usually reserved for a publishing sensation such as Harry Potter. While the final version was completed two months ago, it has been made available only to a small circle of readers.\n\nWhat is known about it is that it draws on aspects of Shakespeare's King Lear and of Havel's autobiography.\n\nHavel never made a secret of the fact that he struggled to cope with the weight of responsibility that came with the role of president and the fact that the only writing he was able to do was to compose his own speeches and write the occasional lecture. He wrote the play during a five-month visit to Washington DC in 2005.\n\nYet now he says he fears the row surrounding the play will overshadow the work itself.\n\n\"I'd rather the public and critics deal with my drama and its staging rather than with speculations and half-truths about its preparation,\" he said."
