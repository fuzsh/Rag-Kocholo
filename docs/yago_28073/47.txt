Olga Havlová, one-time first lady of the Czech Republic, would have been 85 years old this year. While many people know her name, the majority mainly remember her as the wife of President Václav Havel. Few are capable of appreciating her as a personality who devoted her entire life to creating the conditions for the fomentation of civic society. As the founder of the Committee of Good Will she always fought for the rights of the most vulnerable and by means of the foundation helped the disabled, the abandoned and the socially disadvantaged.

How do today’s youth view her legacy? What does Olga Havlová represent to them? Do today’s 20-year-olds have their “own” personalities they look up to? Who are their models? What do they think of non-profit organisations, volunteering and charity and how do they make that known? Do the terms that Olga Havlová and Václav Havel identified with – truth and love, compassion and humility – have the same meanings for them? And what do those who lived through the “Havel years” as adults make of the development of society and today’s youth?

Representatives of the young generation will discuss human and moral values together.

Organised by the Václav Havel Library in cooperation with the Committee of Good Will – Olga Havlová Foundation.
