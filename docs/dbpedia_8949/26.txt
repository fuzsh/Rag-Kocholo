Otherwise Luscious Life

Postcards from downtown

I lost all my faith in love

On those stairs that November

I know it meant a lot at the time

But I can barely remember

It's been a long time

It's been a long time

You said I've been alone so long

That I've got big theories of lonely

And you said I drag them all over town

Just to look occupied

But I'm learning something

I'm doing time

Red light, green light

One, two, three

Have you come to conquer me

It's been a long time

It's been a long time

Hey, I know how to take in all kinds of heartless offers

And I've learned how to hand back a few

I've come as close to love as to walking on water

So what could I do with you, what will I do with you

I'm going out now I'll send you some postcards from downtown

I'll show you all the apartments where I got my degrees

Where I'd fall like small dreams

Where I'd fade like bright leaves

Red light, green light

One, two, three

Have you come to conquer me

It's been a long time, long time

It's been a long time

It's been a long time

Miss liberty

I'm Miss liberty

Give me your junkies

Your irresponsible drummers

I've swept my halls clean of clean

Your kitchen raiders and your wingtip dayrunners

Go plant your flags

And make your promise to my promised land

And we'll make love to the new frontier

In the hot beach sand

You'll hold me like a, a drowning man

You'll come at me too human

And drag me down again

And leave me broken like a spine

Split open like a melon

That's been dropped from a high, high place

Broken like a spine

Split open like a melon

That's been dropped

I like this country

She's like a whore

Who loves her junkies

Who loves all her sad outlaws

Lifting her skirt to tease and flirt

With the wretched who've washed up at her shores

When we die I hope someone's God

Takes us in like immigrants

And we'll make love in the leftover light

Of heaven's tenements

You'll hold me like a drowning man

You'll come at me too human

And let you drag me down again

You'll leave me broken like a spine

Split open like a melon

That's been dropped from a high, high place

Broken like a spine

Split open like a melon

That's been dropped

broken like a spine

Split open like a melon

That's been dropped, dropped

Otherwise luscious life

I'm as packed as I can handle

I could barely shut the doors

Now I'm staring down the rear view

'Til I can't see you anymore

Something that was meant to be

Something that's just you and me

Don't you know with you I fall together

I've got no time or space for this

No room or space for this strife

And I've got no need for those lips

Really you know that's just ripe cherry on an otherwise luscious life

And if anybody's looking, I'll be hanging with my girlfriends

I say these dykes and queens and jersey princesses

Have got more balls than any man I ever laid, ever laid

Something that was meant to be

Something that's just you and me

Don't you know with you I fall together

I'm gonna squash my sorrows underneath

Some other man, someone else's hands inside my jeans

Rubbing up and down my hard seams

And I'll tell him you can have my cake

And eat it too but when your mouth's dripping full of me

Will you say that I'm not sweet enough for you

My sugar's gone, I'll tell him my sugar's gone

Because you can't just blame it on

The last man who told me how the damn hungry he was, he was

Something that was meant to be

Something that's just you and me

Don't you know with you I fall together

I'm as packed as I can handle

I could barely shut the doors

I'm staring down the rear view

Oh I can't see you, no I can't see you anymore

Anymore, anymore

I've got no need for those lips

Really you know that's just ripe cherry on an otherwise luscious life

Luscious life, luscious life

Beside you

On the road to houston

God there's so much room

To think in

You're the thought I just had

In the mood I just felt

Sinking in

Beside you

Beside you

Beside you

I don't need to know you

I just need to be reminded

This could last an hour

I could search forever

And never find this again

Beside you

Beside you

Beside you

Somewhere hearts are pounding

Sometimes I just let love

Slide away

If my heart had wings

Not these heavy shoes that I would fly

Beside you

Beside you

Beside you

Paterson

The road still runs by the river

The river still pours into town

By the time you see where you're headed

You're half the way down

I was bragging on my independence

Saying love leaves you stumbling and dumb

Then i go and dissolve

Just like cotton candy

On the tip of some boy's tongue

In the crackhouse cellars

In the weary faces

In the burnt out factories

This town knows there's nowhere left to go

But all the way down

We all know there's nowhere left to go

But all the way down

But all the way down

But all the way down

Every sad old poppa was a proud young man

Full of victories that he almost won

All the mistakes he made

Pave the streets of Paterson

We made our concessions to the business

We paid our dues to the wrong guys

And got deeply screwed

But we don't let anyone tell us what to do anymore

We need our great falls

In the trash and foam floats

Every wish we've ever made

This town knows there's nowhere left to go

But all the way down

We all know there's nowhere left to go

But all the way down

But all the way down

But all the way down

But all the way down

But all the way down

Oh, mio courÃ© (oh my heart)

Oh, mio courÃ© (oh my heart)

Sto morento (I'm dying)

Ma tu non mi vedi (but you don't see me)

Oh, mio courÃ©

Oh, mio courÃ©

Sto morento

Ma tu non mi vedi

Sto morento

Ma tu non mi vedi

Just like Jack

He called me his sweet angel

And he called this sad town heaven

For a time I saw it through him

And I've appreciated that

And you, you talk just like him

Full of poetry and visions

You don't see things as they are

You're making mansions out of shacks

And you'll be thinking deep thoughts

As you're sneaking out the back

'Cause you're just like Jack

You're just like Jack

Your lips will taste like whiskey

From the local sugarshack

You'll tell me that I'm pretty

Though you're probably just bored

And everyone will love you

'Cause you blew the dust off this town

You'll leave everybody wanting

What they didn't want before

And you would touch us all so deep

But you won't let us touch you back

'Cause you're just like Jack

You're just like Jack

With all I got to keep me here

The baby and my mother

I'll probably live forever

And have nothing new to say

But don't you ever cross a river

With that restless heart of yours

You got nothing to hold onto

You'll just get swept away

But you'll be beaming like a floodlight

When the night is thick and black

'Cause you're just like Jack

You're just like Jack, just like Jack

Just like Jack, just like Jack

Touchstone

You know sometimes

Alone on nights like this

When the moon slants just right

And bounces naked light around my room

I think of you, I think of you

It's a girl who'll hold back secrets

With delicate chains

But it takes a generous woman

To break you through her heart again

I still think of you

When our bodies were together

And our dreams were always bold

When I braved your widest crossing

Just to watch myself unfold

I knew you'd be my touchstone

I could see us getting old

Remember me

I curve like a question mark

And I'm laying all alone

And I can almost feel your answer

Like a saxophone

Remember me

I came to you washed clean

And soft as a peace

I said let's climb

And all you did was reach for me

Well, I think of you, think of

And when our bodies were together

And our dreams were always bold

When I braved your widest crossing

Just to watch myself unfold

I knew you'd be my touchstone

Even when you got all cold

Sometimes, alone on nights like this

And when the moon slants just right

And bounces naked light

Naked light around my room

I think of you

Crime scene

I peeled you off like onion skin

In layers I felt myself burning again and again

I'm smaller than I was before, than I was before

Odd and even to the core

Oh, you thrill and disgust me

You're just like this city

Right down to your girders and grime

You're meanness, your muggings, your casual crimes

I'm a jersey girl, a tunnel train

Empty, then loaded, then empty again

Oh these days I'm just passing through

I'm just passing through

Someday I won't remember you

Oh you fuck like an artist

And you know that you do

You got 'em dripping in fuschia

And moaning in cobalt blue

And we all run into each other

Like watercolors

In other lives, in other countries

I loved you just the same

But I, I, I

In some lost language

My tongue has licked

The vowels in your name

I limped off like a crime scene

I took self defense classes

I now walk wide of dark alleys

And blondes with little round glasses

Showdown

Pulled out the big guns

Got my best dress on

Shit, I'd forgotten you were charming

You're disarming

Been playing too hard

This is a hard town

And all my old gang

Has broken down, somehow

I miss them all

Though not just now

We say I'm fine, how are you

Hey, hey

It's a showdown

Hey

It's a showdown

It's you and me

Got you pinned up against a stark raving skyline

It's love, yeah love

Just picks me up then lets me down

Pulled out the big guns

Got my new shoes on

I'm gonna wear a groove so deep

In your mind that everyone coming after me

Will be moving to my beat

Hey, hey

It's a showdown

Hey, yeah

It's a showdown

We got green lights down 9th avenue

We got an ice cold slice of a winter moon

We both got torture guards around our hearts

Mine used to break me down too soon

Hey, hey

It's a showdown

Hey

It's a showdown

Hey, hey

It's a showdown, showdown

Showdow, down, down

It's a showdown

Wonderful

I know that we're both treading water

I know we were just having fun

And I've still been waiting

We could've been something wonderful

You said I can't find my way round this room anymore

Since you left, I had to move my bed

And move my chest of drawers

Was I poking out the closet

Was I balled up in your sheets

Was I a smell left on your fingers

Was I the shirt you let me keep

And it's just like a man to toss away

what made him come to his senses again

I know that we're both treading water

I know we were just having some fun

And I still think we

I still think we could've been something wonderful

I know you, I know where you come from

Love's dicked you around and someone's let you down

Were they poking out the closet

Were they balled up in your sheets

Were they my smell left on your fingers

Were they the shirt you let me keep

And it's just like a man to toss away

What made him come to his senses again

I know that we're both treading water

I know we were just having some fun

And still I think we

We could've been something wonderful

La la song

He's got his la la

He's got a tambourine

And he'll play it for all the girls

Who have heartstrings

He stomps the floor

Like a matador

He says, wait, wait, wait

There she goes again

On a high climb

The back of her neck breaks my heart sometimes

So you close your eyes

You smile goodbye

You think, wait, wait, wait

Wait, wait, wait

Postcards From Downtown

Fred Astaire

I'm caught

I'm seen through

If you were a chivalrous man

You'd know what to do

You're a sad prince

You're my most humble pie

And under serious oath

You're my sweetest lie

I had a dream that you danced

Just like Fred Astaire

I sat and watched, leaning back

As you glided on air around me

I'd do anything you want

Look what you've done

I'd be a game that you play

Much too easily won

I'm too easily won

And I don't care

What you do

Who strokes your hair

Where you run off to

Mill Street tonight is twinkling like stars

Hollywood dust under seventies cars

I miss you

I'd do anything you want

Look what you've done

I'd be a game that you play

Much too easily won

I'm too easily won

And what do you remember

After too much sweet wine;

That you woke up hung-over

Or that you had a good time

Well, I had a good time

Love gets in the way

I've made love with one eye on the door

I've left good rooms with nothing to say

I wanted to love them

But love got in the way

I wanted to love them

But love gets in the way

And so what if everything's changed

And so what if I've held out for more

I'm all wild in places I wasn't before

I'm wild in places where I wasn't before

So come on and make a mess of me

I won't walk away

I'm ready as I'll ever be

I won't walk away

I want to be fed by you

I want to be led by you

I thought I wanted freedom

But love got in the way

I went looking for freedom

But love got in the way

So come on and make a mess of me

I won't walk away

I'm ready as I'll ever be

I won't walk away

Somebody leave a light on

He was blessed, the best of us

And now the boy is gone

He was so beautiful and stupid

He'd go swimming with his boots on

You spend too much time with strangers

You spend too much time alone

You need someone to leave a light on

When you're headed home

Somebody leave a light on

Somebody leave a light on

If someone told you you'd be

Tied to some wicked

And some beautiful dreams

And go clanking town to town

Now - like a tortured dog

Now - like a wedding car

Till you're a tough old telephone pole

Naked and stuck to a sad stretch of road

Calling up everyone you know

Somebody leave a light on

I know love is everywhere

Whatever ground you stand on

I'll take what sight is offered me

Whatever lights you turn on

Somebody leave a light on

Is there anybody out there

You're a tough old telephone pole

Is there anybody out there

Naked and stuck to a sad stretch of road

Shit this town is nowhere

Calling up everyone

Is there anybody home

You know

Who've washed up at her shores

You'll leave me broken like a spine

Split open like a melon dropped from a high

High place

Last good taste

You got me in my place

You got me at the right time

You got me in the right frame of mind

For making love

Man, it's good to see your face

I've been living out of suitcases

You know you were the last good taste

I've had of love

You're scared to fly, I'm scared to land

We don't have a prayer

We don't have a plan

I don't care

Cause you got me in my place

You got me at the right time

You got me in the right frame of mind

For making love

I wish I could haunt you

But I gotta let that one go

We got too much to do

And there's enough else to know

But till you go

You know you got me in my place

You got me at the right time

You got me in the right frame of mind

For making love

Man, it's good to see your face

I've been living out of suitcases

You know you were the last good taste

I've had of love

Monroe

Monroe's gone round the bend again

May never make it home

When he arrives she almost always lets him in

You can't take him on when he's like this

You can't leave him alone

Where's he been, where's he been

Last time that I saw you

I thought you were doing fine

I was broke and coming down

From New Orleans

Talk about the business

What they do to you this time

We try not to complain, but we complain

They just break your heart again

Now he's burning all his bridges

Now he's skipping across the water

Like a smooth, flat stone

Now he's scratching 'cause it itches

Now he's slurring on the phone

I like your picture, are you alone

I like your picture

Monroe's gone round the bend again

She couldn't make him stay

There's too much trouble

To get into everywhere

His devil called from downtown

Now his angel's gone to pray

It's a wonder he's alive

But he's alive somewhere

You know the city guys are dangled

Every time you take the stage

They're swelling up like poets

While you're rattling your cage

You're all they left the suburbs for

They'd make you all the rage

Then they'll try not to complain

But they'll complain

When you break their hearts again

Paterson

âPaterson is a big sad poppa in need of a little compassionâ - Allen Ginsberg

The road still runs by the river

The river still pours into town

By the time you see where you're headed

You're half the way down

I was bragging on my independence

Saying love leaves you stumbling and dumb

Then i go and dissolve

Just like cotton candy

On the tip of some boy's tongue

In the crackhouse cellars

In the weary faces

In the burnt out factories

This town knows there's nowhere left to go

But all the way down

We all know there's nowhere left to go

But all the way down

Every sad old poppa was a proud young man

Full of victories that he almost won

All the mistakes that he made

Pave the streets of Paterson

We made our concessions to the business

We paid our dues to the wrong guys

And we got deeply screwed

But we don't let anyone tell us what to do anymore

We need our great falls

In the trash and foam

Floats every wish we've ever made

This town knows there's nowhere left to go but

All the way down

We all know there's nowhere left to go

But all the way down

Oh, mio courÃ© (oh, my heart)

Oh, mio courÃ© (oh, my heart)

Sto morento (I'm dying)

Ma tu non mi vedi (but you don't see me)

Just like Jack

Because you're just like Jack

You're just like Jack

Satisfied

A dream is dying

So comfort me tonight

The clock is lying

I never got it right

I lost the fight

I lost the fight

I'm understanding

I'm overqualified

I think I'm landing

Can always say I tried

I'm satisfied

I'm satisfied

It's goodbye to the circus

And how could I mind

I found the best sweetheart

That I'll ever find

His arms are open

And his heart is kind

I felt it coming

Before I even knew

The engine's running

Goodbye to cast and crew

I'll miss them, too

I'll miss them, too

I leave to the bravest of boystown

My wings

May they search for love

In their passionate flings

Be as happy and lonely

As fat little kings

A dream is dying

So comfort me tonight

The clock is lying

I never got it right

I lost the fight

But it's alright

Beautiful Yesterday

Music box

Sitting in the same room

Over and over

Listen to the same songs

Over again

And if I could say one thing

I'd tell time that he's a bastard

To wind you up

Watch you run in circles

Till you fade away

Fade away

Fade away

Fade away

Year by year

Your dreams try to leave you

No one believes you

No one complains

And if I could say one thing

I'd tell time that he's a bastard

To wind you up

Watch you run in circles

Till you fade away

Fade away

Fade away

Fade away

I belong to the wind

(Huber/Overs)

Take your love

I'm not for loving

Take your needs

I'm not for needing

Take your tears

I'm not for crying

I belong to the wind

Take your kiss,

I'm not for kissing

Take your hopes

I'm not for hoping

Take your cares

I'm not for caring

I belong to the wind

She calls to me with her melodies

Now I've got the taste

on my tongue

My life wasn't meant to be lived

It was meant to be sung

So take your love

I'm not for loving

Take your needs

I'm not for needing

Take your dreams

I'm not for dreaming

I belong to the wind

Love where did you go

I get high

Then I get low

I asked why

But you don't know

The sink is full

The plants gone yellow

Oh love where did you go

I've forgiven awful things

From lesser men

With weaker slings

Their stingy love

Their restless wings

Oh love where did you go

I wonder where you are tonight

Who gave you strength

Who stole my fight

Who holds your gaze

In love's fresh light

Oh love where did you go

Left Alone

( Mal Waldron )

Where's the love

That's made to fill my heart

Where's the one

From whom I'll never part

First they hurt me

Then desert me

I'm left alone

All alone

There's no house

That I can call my home

There's no place

From which I'll never roam

Town or city

It's a pity

I'm left alone

All alone

Seek and find they always say

But up to now it's not that way

Maybe fate has let him pass me by

Or perhaps we'll meet before I die

Hearts will open, but until then

I'm left alone, all alone

Seek and find they always say

But up to now it's not that way

Maybe fate has let him pass me by

Or perhaps we'll meet before I die

Hearts will open, but until then

I'm left alone, all alone

All, all alone

Joy in repetition

( Prince )

All the poets and the part time singers

Always hang inside

Live music from a band on a stage

Plays a song called "Soul Psychodelicide"

The song's a year long and had been playing for months

When he walked into the place

No one seemed to notice an introverted this is it look on

On most of their faces

Up on the mic repeating two words, over and over again

Was this woman he had never noticed

Before he lost himself in the articulated manner

In which she said them

Ah these two words, a little bit behind the beat

I mean just enough to turn you on

And everytime she said the words

Another one of his doubts was gone

Should he try to rap with her

Should he stand and stare

And no one else was watching her

She didn't seem to care

So over and over, she said the words

'Til he could take no more

Then he dragged her from the stage

And together they ran to the back door

In the alley over by the curb

He said tell me what's your name

She only said the words again

And it started to rain, rain, rain

Two words falling between the drops

And the moans of his condition

Holding someone is truly believing

There's joy in repetition

Yeah there's joy in repetition

There's joy in repetition

Yeah and there's joy in repetition

Yeah there's joy in repetition

She said love me

That's all she said

She said love me

A little bit behind the beat

Over and over and over and over

She said love me

Love me

There's joy, there's joy

There's joy in repetition

In repetition, in repetition

Yeah in repetition

Yeah in repetition

In repetition

In repetition

In repetition...

Those were the days

( Gene Raskin )

Once upon a time there was a tavern

Where we used to raise a glass or two

Remember how we laughed away the hours

And think of all the great things we would do

Those were the days my friend

We thought they'd never end

We'd sing and dance forever and a day

We'd live the life we choose

We'd fight and never lose

For we were young and sure to have our way

Just tonight I stood before the tavern

Nothing seemed the way it used to be

In the glass I saw a strange reflection

Was that lonely woman really me

Those were the days my friend

We thought they'd never end

We'd sing and dance forever and a day

We'd live the life we choose

We'd fight and never lose

Those were the days

Oh yes those were the days

La la la la la la

La la la la la la...

Through the door there came familiar laughter

I saw your face and heard you call my name

Oh my friend we're older but no wiser

For in our hearts the dreams are still the same

Those were the days my friend

We thought they'd never end

We'd sing and dance forever and a day

We'd live the life we choose

We'd fight and never lose

Those were the days

Oh yes those were the days

La la la la la la

La la la la la la...

Everybody knows

( Leonard Cohen )

Everybody knows that the dice are loaded

Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed

Everybody knows that the war is over

Everybody knows that the good guys lost

Everybody knows that the fight was fixed

The poor stay poor and the rich get rich

That's how it goes

Everybody knows

Everybody knows that the boat is leaking

Everybody knows that the captain lied

Everybody's got this broken feeling

Like their father or their dog just died

Everybody's talking to their pockets

Everybody wants a box of chocolates

And a long stem rose

Yeah and everybody knows

And everybody knows that it's now or never

Everybody knows that it's me or you

Everybody knows that you live forever

When you've done a line or two

Everybody knows the deal is rotten

Old black Joe's still picking cotton

For your ribbons and bows

And everybody knows

Everybody knows, everybody knows

That's how it goes

Everybody knows

Everybody knows, everybody knows

That's how it goes

Everybody knows

Everybody knows that you love me baby

Everybody knows that you really do

Everybody knows that you've been faithful

Give or take a night or two

Everybody knows you've been discreet

But there were so many people you just had to meet

Without your clothes

Yeah and everybody knows

Everybody knows, everybody knows

Everybody knows

Everybody knows

Everybody knows

Everybody knows

Amsterdam crown

(Balint/Atanasoff)

September, whatever

Amsterdam in the rain

Walked around for miles

No one here knows my name

Bought a souvenir

Off the tip of a knife

Could buy this whole

Fucking town

Never felt so free all my life

I know I'm a stranger here

And I'm not looking down

And if I am, it's because of

My Amsterdam crown

My Amsterdam crown

This table is my cradle

I'm as happy as can be

Though I can't smell your tulips

And I can't taste this tea

I've got everything I need

Right between my teeth

Don't wanna go back home

There's burning garbage

On my street

Well you can start hunting

For broken glass

Maybe I'll just see you all

At Sunday mass

September, whatever

I'm Amsterdam in the rain

I own the world it's in my heart

My secret game

It's my Amsterdam crown

I Got It Bad (and that ain't good)

( Duke Ellington Cover )

Never treats me sweet and gentle

The way he should

I got it bad

And that's not good

My poor heart is sentimental

Not made of wood

I got it bad

And that ain't good

But when the weekend is over

When the weekend's over

And Monday rolls around

I end up like i start out

Just crying my poor heart out

He don't love me like I love him

Nobody could

I got it bad

That's not good

Like a lonely weeping willow

Who's lost in the wood

I got it so bad and that ain't good

And the things I tell my pillow

No woman should

I got it bad

And that's not good

That's not good

Now folks with good intentions

They tell me

They tell me to save my tears

Tell me to save my tears

But I'm glad I'm bad about him

I just can't live

I just can't live without him

Lord above me

Make him love me

The way

All the way that he should

Way he should

I got it so bad

I got it bad

And that's not good

That ain't good

I got it real, real bad

And you know that's not good

Lost And Looking

( Sam Cooke )

I'm lost and I'm looking for my baby

Wonder why my baby can't be found

I'm lost and I'm looking for my baby

Lord knows that my baby ain't around

So I'm lost

And I'm looking for my baby

Wonder why my baby can't be found

I'm lost and I'm looking for my baby

Lord knows my baby ain't around

Cried for my baby

Crying all alone

Calling for you to come home

Come home

I'm lost and I'm searching for my baby

Baby won't you please come home

I'm lost and I'm looking for my baby

I need you 'cause I'm so alone

Parlez-moi d'amour

( Jean Lenoir )

Parlez-moi d'amour

Redites-moi des choses tendres

Votre beau discours

Mon cÅur n'est pas las de l'entendre

Pourvu que toujours

Vous rÃ©pÃ©tiez ces mots suprÃªmes

Je vous aime

Vous savez bien

Que dans le fond je n'en crois rien

Mais cependant je veux encore

Ãcouter ce mot que j'adore

Votre voix aux sons caressants

Qui le murmure en frÃ©missant

Me berce de sa belle histoire

Et malgrÃ© moi je veux y croire

Parlez-moi d'amour

Redites-moi des choses tendres

Votre beau discours

Mon cÅur n'est pas las de l'entendre

Pourvu que toujours

Vous rÃ©pÃ©tiez ces mots suprÃªmes

Je vous aime

Il est si doux

Mon cher trÃ©sor, d'Ãªtre un peu fou

La vie est parfois trop amÃ¨re

Si l' on ne croit pas aux chimÃ¨res

Le chagrin est vite apaisÃ©

Et se console d'un baiser

Du cÅur on guÃ©rit la blessure

Par un serment qui le rassure

Parlez-moi d'amour

Redites-moi des choses tendres

Votre beau discours

Mon cÅur n'est pas las de l'entendre

Pourvu que toujours

Vous rÃ©pÃ©tiez ces mots suprÃªmes

Je vous aime

Beautiful yesterday

Beautiful yesterday

Where have you gone

Who squandered your fortunes

Who wore out your songs

I've done all you asked me

What more can I do

Beautiful yesterday

I'm singing for you

Beautiful yesterday

They're laughing at you

They're all addicted

To whatever's new

Your flowers are dying

And I'm dying too

Beautiful yesterday

I'm dying for you

Beautiful yesterday

Where have you gone

I've done all he asked me

But I did it all wrong

I waited till morning

Then you left me too

Beautiful yesterday

I'm singing for you

Everybody loves a garden

And I'll tell you how

That garden grows

With sunshine from your eyes

And a heart of clear blue skies

Another Black Feather

From the bottom up

I found my love I lost my heart

I found my love but where's my heart

They love you from the bottom up

Your head comes all apart

My price went down my youth is gone

I hate this town my youth is gone

I went to bed a head of state

And now I mow the lawns

Careful what you wish for

What you wish for

Careful what you wish for

I had a secret small and rare

Hell I had secrets everywhere

They withered in the light of love

And I don't even care

If they want me I'll be found

Just look for me I'll be around

I'll be wearing Friday night

A few feet off the ground

Careful what you wish for

What you wish for

Careful what you wish for

For heavy lids and whole wheat hair

Your sweetest smile and lusty stare

Whatever I can gather up

Whatever I can spare

I found my love I lost my heart

I found my love but where's my heart

They love you from the bottom up

Your head comes all apart

They love you from the bottom up

Your head comes all apart

They love you from the bottom up

Your head comes all apart

Nola

New York is impossibly handsome

Impossibly bright

But his hands are too busy

His shirts are too shiny and tight

On Fridays he dances to metronomes

So he can keep counting

All night all night all night

Every time that I see her

My heart ends up begging to stay

She's been calling me to her

She tortures me every day

Have you been on a joyride

Say your best backslide

Then rocked all night

Till you're trembling and sore

Just take me in your scented arms

New Orleans I'm coming for more

Oh, New Orleans I'm coming for more

I know angels can lie

If it lightens your load

They'll be stroking your cheek

But they're speaking in code

They'll take all your money

And then hit the road

And leave you broken and smiling

He has no use for me

He never looks in my eyes

Been waking up cursing

It's no way to live or to die

I've nothing of value to bring you

I come to you wasted and poor

Please take me in your scented arms

New Orleans I'm coming for more

Oh, New Orleans I'm coming for more

In the rush and the spin

In the flush of my sin

She'll be rolling her eyes

While she beckons me in

Please god, let me love truly

Forgive every nation

And walk like a woman again

Baby I love you

But baby I just have to go

I've got so much to learn

She's got secrets I just have to know

I left my true love for you

Oh just take everything

I'll do what you want me to do

Please take me in your scented arms

New Orleans I'm coming for you

Oh, New Orleans I'm coming for you

Venezuela

That was such a lovely dream

The streets were golden in the sun

I've never been to Venezuela

But my family was all there

And my mother looked so young

Venezuela looked like Brooklyn

Though the streets were twice as wide

Children spun around the trees

Little tops, little Sufis

Mamas smile from inside

Oh Fernando I'm so sorry

For the love you saved for me

But my heart is locked forever

In another lovely dream

He approached me like a prince

And said he's loved me all his life

He said he knew that I'd come here

That he's been waiting all these years

That I'm meant to be his wife

And my sister was so jealous

Of the love you had for me

She left, stomping 'cross the square

Rigid arms flying hair

Her skirt had many layers and it bounced like Sandra Dee's

Oh Fernando I'm so sorry

Whatever could I say

To a man I've never met

Who's the one who got away

I cried to see his heart so plainly

For he was such a formal man

Handed to me like a daisy

In the presence of my family

From his damp and shaking hands

I said, Fernando, I can't stay here

And a clock began to chime

And I opened up my shirt

And in its bony cage

Ticked a paper valentine

Oh Fernando I'm so sorry

For the love you saved for me

But my heart is locked forever

In another lovely dream

Oh Fernando I'm so sorry

Whatever could I say

To a man I've never met

Who's the one who got away

Another black feather

I'm lonely today

But in a good way

I've let my heart lead

Without mercy sometimes

I'm faithful to you

And I know I will be

And I'm not always kind, but I'm trying

There's a zydeco band

In the last sticky light

And I'm dancing with strangers, one after another

And the only thing left

To want from this night

Is you dancing with me as my own sweetest lover

You're in the city and you're looking for desert

Then you're in the desert and you're wishing for rain

You're in his arms looking for comfort

He's given you comfort and you're wishing for pain

Not another dark waltz

I dream these too often

Out in the back

Digging holes for our dinner

Another brass tack

For the lid of my coffin

Another black feather

For the wings of a sinner

You're in the city and you're looking for desert

Then you're in the desert and you're wishing for rain

You're in his arms looking for comfort

He's given you comfort now you're begging for pain

Hey next time I see you

Could you act like a stranger and

Kiss me like you don't know love has a chance

Remember that first time

In my old apartment

Whenever our feet touch the ground

Let 'em dance

Banks of the edisto

(for gus)

I've been lazy

I've been overfed

I've been thinking

Too much with my head

I was dreaming

About the life you led

On the banks of the Edisto

On the banks of the edisto

Where the sweet gum and the cypress grows

I want to know what the cypress knows

On the banks of the Edisto

Where'd you go

When you died my friend

Do you see us

Did your soul ascend

And I listened

For his answer then

On the banks of the edisto

Heaven's here where the bard owl cries

Where the smile meets my sweetheart's eyes

I'll be right here taming dragonflies

Only heaven I need to know

On the banks of the edisto

Where the sweet gum

And the cypress grows

I want to know what the cypress knows

On the banks of the edisto

I've been lazy

I've been overfed

I've been thinking too much with my head

I've been dreaming

About the life you led

On the banks of the edisto

It's the Day of Atonement, 2001

It's the Day of Atonement, two thousand one

And I'm sorry for anything I might have done

I'm sorry for everything we've left to do

I'm sorry we're still so confused

Well, I never had faith

So, we'll never be safe

We never were safe anyway

It's just that the veil was ripped from our face

On such a beautiful day

Mohammed is pacing

When he isn't kneeling

Jesus can't talk

He's too busy weeping

Yahweh's a mother

Who sighs at the ceiling

If only they knew how good it could've been

It's the day of atonement two thousand four

Would Jesus be happy we evened the score

You hypocrites, bullies who profit from war

May your gods all spit on your graves

I say all of you gods

Tell your squabbling children

Whatever the color or call

They can all go to hell

If there is such a thing

Go to hell

Have it out

Have a ball

Mohammed is pacing

When he isn't kneeling

Jesus can't talk

He's too busy weeping

Yahweh's a mother

Who sighs at the ceiling

If only you knew how good it could've been

I say all of you gods

Tell your squabbling children

Whatever the color or call

They can all go to hell

If there is such a thing

Go to hell

Have it out

Have a ball

Showdown

Pulled out the big guns

Got my best dress on

Shit, I'd forgotten you were charming

You're disarming

Been playing too hard

This is a hard town

And all my old gang has broken down, somehow

I miss them all

Though not just now

We say I'm fine, how are you

Showdown

It's you and me

Got you pinned up against a stark raving skyline

It's love, yeah love

Just picks me up then lets me down

Pulled out the big guns

Got my new boots on

I'm gonna wear a groove so deep

In your mind that everyone coming after me

Will be moving to my beat

Showdown

We got green lights down 9th avenue

We got an ice cold slice of winter moon

We both got torture guards around our hearts

Mine used to break me down too soon

Showdown

Showdown

Showdownâ¦

Right for me

Hold back the cannons

Call off the guards

How did your eyes get

So mean so fast so hard

Can we do something else

We've been here before

Stop dragging me into

The battles of your little wars

I don't know what you're going through

What demons you need to set free

I don't think you're right in the head

But I think you're just right for me

You're just right for me

Baby you're just right for me

So call me tomorrow

When this storm has passed

When you're good you love me

Like nobody else ever has

I don't know what you're going through

What demons you need to set free

I don't think you're right in the head

But I think you're just right for me

You're just right for me

Baby you're just right for me

All Over Again

( Johnny Cash )

Every time I look at you

I fall in love

All over again

Every time I think of you

It all begins

All over again

One little dream at night and I can dream all day

It only takes a memory to thrill me

One little kiss from you and I just fly away

Pour me out your love until you fill me

I wanna fall in love

Beginning from the start

All over again

Show me how you stole away my heart

All over again

One little dream at night and I can dream all day

It only takes a memory to thrill me

One little kiss from you, I just fly away

Pour me out your love until you fill me

I wanna fall in love

Beginning from the start

All over again

Show me how you stole away my heart

All over again

Hope she'll be happier

( Bill Withers )

Maybe the lateness of the hour

Makes me seem lonelier than I am

But in my heart there is a shower

I hope she'll be happier with him

Maybe the darkness of the hour

Makes me seem lonelier than I am

But over the darkness I have no power

I hope she'll be happier with him

I can't believe that you don't want to see me

We lived and loved with each other so long

I never thought you really would leave me

But you're gone

Maybe the lateness of the hour

Makes me seem lonelier than I am

But in my heart there is a power

Hope she'll be happier with him

The miracle

Sleep holds

Nothing but

Dreams hold

Nothing but

We'll never know

We'll never know

We are

Open

As sky can be

A bird's eye

A tapped knee

We're in it now

We're in it now

We are

Strangers

Come this far

Someday

Even stars

Will leave us

They'll leave us

We are

Half a work of art

Half smile

Half heart

We'll never know

We'll never know

We are

American Standard

Invocation

Would you even know me

Since I've been away

I wake with my eyes closed

And sleep through the day

But I'll open my heart

And I'll learn how to pray

If mama you let me come home

I've snuck into Eden

In the hours before dawn

I've stolen the apples

That dropped on your lawn

My spirit my pride

And my innocence gone

Please mama let me come home

Oh mama let me come home

I've strayed far from you

For too little, too long

I know I've been hard headed,

Selfish and wrong

Please mama let me come home

I'm shut out of heaven

And decades from hell

I've passed out in the shrines

Where the beautiful fell

And I've burned down the silo

And poisoned the well

Please mama let me come home

I made back alley deals

That were forged in your name

I was dazzled by gold

And the shimmer of fame

And you knew all the time

But you never complained

Please mama let me come home

Oh mama let me come home

I've strayed far from you

For too little, too long

I know I've been hard headed,

Selfish and wrong

Please mama let me come home

I'll do all the dishes

And clean out your shed

I'll bring you the paper

And coffee in bed

I'll tell you great stories

Right outta my head

If mama, you let me come home

I'll be a great sage

Or a fabulous liar

I'll hammer a truce

Or wage war in your honor

Follow every spark

Rising up from your fire

If mama you let me come home

Oh mama let me come home

I've strayed far from you

For too little, too long

I know I've been hard headed

Selfish and wrong

Please mama let me come home

Oh mama let me come home

I've strayed far from you

For too little, too long

I know I've been hard headed

Selfish and wrong

Please mama let me come home

Please mama let me come home

Good in '62

At the stomp called ponderosa

The old men strut like bandyroos

You had a hit in Louisiana

That spread to Texas in '62

You're squeezed back in your favourite jacket

With sequins sewn on gabardine

Orange flames are licking black

And on the back, your one, true name

You slam one back and you bite the lime

Then you're gnawing on your guitar in 2/4 time

You had some money in your pockets

And the women were kind

You had it good in '62

You must've had it good in '62

The band is back but minus jimmy

Gone last year, this one's for you

Coralynn's in crinolines

She's looking shy and singing oh

You slam one back and you bite the lime

Then you're gnawing on your guitar in 2/4 time

You had some money in your pockets

And the women were kind

You had it good in '62

You must've had it good in '62

In the crowd boys slouch in sideburns

Cuban shirts and two toned shoes

The girls in diggers, pencil skirts

Bettie page got fresh tattoos

You slam one back and you bite the lime

Then you're gnawing on your guitar in 2/4 time

You had some money in your pockets

And the women were kind

You had it good in '62

You must've had it good in '62

I don't know what you're selling now

Could be cars or shares or shoes

But you once sold 12,000 records

Back in 1962

You slam one back and you bite the lime

Then you're gnawing on your guitar in 2/4 time

You had some money in your pockets

And the women were kind

You had it good in '62

You must've had it good in '62

Oh you had it good in '62

You must've had it good in '62

Billboards for Jesus

The local saint's got a beautiful daughter

You cast your net then you bent and caught her

Now you go follow her back to the water

I was flat on my back in the black of a Carolina river

Your mother's here, child so whatcha gonna give her

Then a song from above hit the water then it glittered

Past the frontage road out of Disney world

Past the billboards for Jesus and for dancing girls

I like my whiskey neat and my men a little sloppy

In the back seat of my old jalopy

Whatcha gonna do about it poor little puppy

Make your bed in the morning, make your lady happy

With your chest puffed out and your arms all scrappy

Keep your powder dry and your tent flap floppy

Past the good ole boys and the Dallas pearls

Past the billboards for Jesus and for dancing girls

The local saint's got a beautiful daughter

You cast your net then you bent and caught her

Now you go follow her back to the water

Past the billboards for Jesus and for dancing girls

Past the billboards for Jesus and for dancing girls

Past the billboards for Jesus and for dancing girls

Past the billboards for Jesus and for dancing girls

Are you dancing with her tonight

I'm tired, so tired

I wish that I could get some rest

My baby says that he loves me

But he doesn't love me the best

My baby says he still loves me

But he doesn't love me the best

Are you dancing with her tonight

Are you holding her close and tight

Will you make love by candlelight

Like we used to do

Is she thankful for all she has

Is her heart beating hard and fast

Does she think that your love will last

Well, honey, me too

He's sorry, so sorry

But he's never coming home

My baby says that he loves me

But he doesn't love me alone

My baby says that he loves me

But he doesn't love me alone

Are you dancing with her tonight

Are you holding her close and tight

Will you make love by candlelight

Like we used to do

Is she thankful for all she has

Is her heart beating hard and fast

Does she think that your love will last

Well, honey, me too

Here Comes A Regular

( The Replacements )

Well a person can work up a mean mean thirst

After a hard day of nothing much at all

Summer's passed, it's too late to cut the grass

There ain't much to rake anyway in the fall

And sometimes I just ain't in the mood

To take my place in back with the loudmouths

You're like a picture on the fridge that's never stocked with food

I used to live at home, now I stay at the house

And everybody wants to be special here

They call your name out loud and clear

Here comes a regular

Call out your name

Here comes a regular

Am I the only one here today

Well a drinking buddy that's bound to another town

Once the police made you go away

And even if you're in the arms of someone's baby now

I'll take a great big whiskey to you anyway

Everybody wants to be someone's here

Someone's gonna show up, never fear

Here comes a regular

Call out your name

Here comes a regular

Am I the only one who feels ashamed

Kneeling alongside old Sad Eyes

He says opportunity knocks once then the door slams shut

All I know is I'm sick of everything that my money can buy

The fool who wastes his life, God rest his guts

First the lights, then the collar goes up, and the wind begins to blow

Turn your back on a pay-you-back, last call

First the glass, then the leaves that pass, then comes the snow

Ain't much to rake anyway in the fall

Everybody wants to be special here

They call your name out loud and clear

Here comes a regular

Call out my name

Here comes a regular

Am I the only one here today

Don't Go Down

( Elliott Smith )

I met a girl, a snowball in hell

She was hard and as cracked as the Liberty Bell

I got her to come on and move in with me

And I said I'd find a better place we could spend eternity

Don't go down

Don't go down

Stay with me

Baby, stay

Her mama called me a thief

And her dad called himself commander-in-chief

I fought him off with my love

But I knew the sense of worthlessness she'd have to rise above

Don't go down

Don't go down

Stay with me

Baby, stay

Don't go down

Don't go down

Stay with me

Baby, stay

She had a dream, woke up in shock

She had seen her own body outlined in chalk

I split the scene, the globe had been spun

And her ghost leaned down to kiss me with a message from the sun

Don't go down

Don't go down

Stay with me

Baby, stay

Don't go down

Don't go down

Stay with me

Baby stay

Hanging Around My Boy

I've got a boy that I love with all my mind

He loves me and I'm gonna treat him right

No one else can take my place

'Cause he loves my smiling face

Better not care to hanging around my boy

I wonder why I love him like I do

I guess it's called, he's so sweet and true

No one else can take my place

'Cause he loves my smiling face

Better not care to hanging around my boy

Sweeter than the flowers in the spring

When he's near my heart it starts insane

No one else can take my place

'Cause he loves my smiling face

Better not care to hanging around my boy

Better not care to hanging around my boy

Better not care to hanging around my boy

No one else can take my place

'Cause he loves my smiling face

Better not care to hanging around my boy

Better not care to

Better not care to

Better not care to

Better not care to

Better not care to

Hanging around my boy

What you doin' doin' silly man

Where you goin' goin' you fine girl

Where you goin' goin' you fine girl

Going to the mirror

Gonna beg my hair to curl

Where you goin' goin' you fine girl

Election day

We all got flags, we been dying to fly

We all got a baby that cries and cries

Mine's been howling since eighty one

When Lennon died and the old man come

The poets wrote, the musicians played

The mothers marched and the atheists prayed

And every door, every wavering brain

Was plain worn down by the youth brigade

Ain't it good to see somebody knows just where you been

Look at us, we're screeching monkeys lit up from within

Here's a toast to every angel sitting on their pins

Good guys sometimes win

The tools of the devil were a beating drum

His holy name and a silver tongue

The poor man's anger and the rich man's till

And the elevation of an empty shell

Between the wars and choking trees

Whose song is sung, who's begging please

Who rang the bell, who made the bed

Disgraced the missing and the dead

Ain't it good to see somebody knows just where you been

Look at us, we're screeching monkeys lit up from within

Here's a toast to every angel sitting on their pins

Good guys sometimes win

We're all product, we're all proof

We're what happened to our youth

How hilarious, how uncouth

We beat back the devil in the voting booth

The poets wrote, the musicians played

The mothers marched and the atheists prayed

And every door, every wavering brain

Was plain worn down by the youth brigade

Ain't it good to see somebody knows just where you been

Look at us, we're screeching monkeys lit up from within

Here's a toast to every angel sitting on their pins

Good guys sometimes win

Reconsider Me

(Margaret Lewis)

Hello baby, yes it's really me

After the wrong I've done

Guess you're surprised to see me

Here at your door

Like a sparrow with a broken wing

Who's come back to beg you to reconsider me

Re, reconsider me

I can't make it without your love, can't you see

If you will let me and I'll love you eternally

Oh baby, baby reconsider me

Rob from always on the run dot net is so bad and copy paste is a sin

I learned the truth

About the so-called good life

It was just a candle

Too short to burn the night

Now all the dark in my heart

I will hand you in plea

Oh light my way again

Light my way and reconsider me

Re, reconsider me

I can't make it without your love, can't you see

If you will let me I will love you eternally

Oh baby, baby, baby, reconsider me

Baby, baby, reconsider me

I can't make it without your love, can't you see

If you'll let me I will love you

I will love you eternally

Oh baby, baby, baby, reconsider me

To see the hurt

That's there in your eyes

Even though I wanna tell the truth

Even though I wanna tell the truth

I'll be a liar

For the rest of my life

Even though I wanna tell the truth...

I've Had My Moments

(Frank Sinatra)

I've had my moments

I must confess

My fleeting moments

Of tenderness

I sang of true love

I've played guitars

Then found a new love

'Neath tropical stars

This time's the last time

This time it's new

Love as a pastime

For me is through

Rob from always on the run dot net is so bad and copy paste is a sin

I've had my moments

My big bad moments

But now my one big moment is you

This time's the last time

This time it's new

Love as a pastime

For me is through

I've had my moments

My big bad moments

But now my one big moment is you

Rise And Fall

It's How You Hold Me

When we dance that's when I remember

All the ways you can spin me around

It's not your skill or your style

Or your gaze or your smile

It's how you hold me, how you're holding me now

You hold me strong and tender

Like it would hurt you to let me fall down

Like I'm precious and wild

Like I'm a newborn child

It's how you hold me, how you're holding me now

And when I'm blue that's when I remember

To be grateful for what I have found

Though your words, God, they move me

As they comfort and soothe

It's how you hold me, how you're holding me now

I copy I paste I'm bad I'm a loser

You hold me strong and tender

Like it would hurt you to let me fall down

Like I'm precious and wild

Like I'm a newborn child

It's how you hold me, how you're holding me now

When me make love that's when I remember

That we're dancing on god's holy ground

More than your body's fine grace

Or your beautiful face

It's how you hold me, how you're holding me now

You hold me strong and tender

Like it would hurt you to let me fall down

Like I'm precious and wild

Like I'm a newborn child

It's how you hold me, how you're holding me now

It's how you hold me, how you're holding me now

You're Not What I Need (But You're All That I Want)

You're not what I need

But you're all that I want

You're easy to read

You're too nonchalant

I need someone bolder

I need a shoulder

You're not what I need

But you're all that I want

I copy I paste I'm bad I'm a loser

Our spirits are restless

And our bodies are, too

That's why, I'm guessing

I've been so drawn to you

But I need love that can heal me

I need love that reveals me

And you're not what I need

But you're all that I want

I need a man who knows what he's got

Who loves who I am, and forgives what I'm not

I need someone steady

Somebody who's ready for me

So let me come over

To your arms tonight

And we can make love

(Though we can't make love right)

I need someone bolder

I need a shoulder

And you're not what I need

But you're all that I want

I need a man who knows what he's got

Who loves who I am, and forgives what I'm not

I need someone steady

Somebody who's ready for me

So I'll give you tonight

Then I'll give you this song

There won't be a fight

âCause nobody's wrong

I need love that can heal me

I need love that reveals me

And you're not what I need

But you're all that I want

If I Go First

I'll wait for you

In weeping autumn

The last tear hanging

Stubborn golden

I'll wait for you

While birches whisper

Their grey hearts curled

On butcher paper

When you no longer

Rise and fall

Or thirst or hunger

Come find me in autumn

I'll wait for you

In winter's daydream

The wood is caught

The flames are kissing

I copy I paste I'm bad I'm a loser

I'll wait for you

'Til its spell is broken

And the river wails

Her belly swollen

When you no longer

Rise and fall

Or thirst or hunger

Come find me in winter

I'll wait for you

If you'll still have me

In fickle spring

I planted lilies

I'll wait for you

In my old garden

With last year's smile

And all its children

When you no longer

Rise and fall

Or thirst or hunger

Come find me in springtime

I'll wait for you

In siege of clover

Geese marching home

The war is over

I'll wait for you

And the sun will rake

Its perfect fingers

Through your hair

When you no longer

Rise and fall

Or thirst or hunger

Come find me in summer

Eat It Up

Here on the island

The bells ring it's 3

Three churches, three songs

Three paths from the sea

The sky will darn its curtains

Hang its lanterns from their strings

The moon is full of itself again

Only a hundred stars are listening

I copy I paste I'm bad I'm a loser

Oh, listening

Oh, listening

Oh, listening

That one named my heart

That one gave me blues

I gave them too much time

Too many years to lose

...

Whatever's your desire

I'll mash the fruit to fill your cup

I'll make the sacrificial kill

And you can eat it up

Oh, eat it up, eat it up

Oh, eat it up

Remember this room

Remember this key

This gift from the sky

This path from the sea

Oh, eat it up, eat it up

Oh, eat it up, eat it up

Oh, eat it up

Yes, You Win

You're my wish, you're my fish

You're my smile every morning

You're my chief, you're my thief

You took command with no warning

And for you and only you

I will shed all my skin

I will be pink, your favorite drink

Yes, you win

I copy I paste I'm bad I'm a loser

You will build and I will till

And we'll grow a house and garden

Our story's told, we will grow old

And we'll remember how it started

That for you and only you

I shed all my skin

We'll age like wine, better than fine

Yes, you win

Yes, I am yours, your swinging door

I open out and open in

And you are mine, I'll hang a sign

Yes, you win

Far Away Again

Turn around, you bastard moon

You drunken night, with your slurred perfume

I'm breathless in a shabby room

I'm far away again

When I'm gone, you never fret

The kitchen's clean and the table's set

Your dinner obligations met

When I'm far away again

I copy I paste I'm bad I'm a loser

I called you, it was your sundown

A pack of boys in a party town

You were roasted, shouldered, ribbed and crowned

And I'm far away again

The words all stick like hard goodbyes

Then the strings come in, and the strings don't lie

I write the saddest lullabyes

When I'm far away again

Armored with a sense of scale

A begging bowl and a wedding veil

I soldier on, but I've left a trail

I'm far away again

So baby, won't you come to me

The food is bad but the drinks are free

And I'm everything you want from me

I'm far away again

A Few Confessions

Sometimes asleep I dream

I'm in love with other men

With a genius, with a stranger

Once with your best friend

And in every one I'm happy

And excited and ashamed

Do you mind

I belong in lots of places

But not where these rivers meet

With people stacked on people

Stacked on metal and concrete

Though it has the grandest dreamers

That ever hurried across a street)

Do you mind

I copy I paste I'm bad I'm a loser

And Romeo next door is crying again

He's a tundra dog who hates the cold

Chimes tumble off the pavement

And the screen is coming loose again

It's old

I never was a cool kid

Socializing grinds me down

And I knew I'd be a grumbler

Since my boots first hit the ground

And since you could've charmed the trendy skirt

Off of any girl in town

Do you mind

In our teeny little garden

December stole my blooms

And it shuttered out the sunlight

In our cluttered living room

And I wish I was in Texas

Or new england or rangoon

Do you mind

The Hole

I'm digging a hole in the ground

I'm wearing your boots, and I'm digging a hole in the ground

And I'm looking at all of the room that I've saved

For more holes to be dug by somebody, someday

While I'm digging a hole in the ground

I'm wearing your boots

And I'm digging a hole in the ground

I copy I paste I'm bad I'm a loser

And I'm humming a lullaby you used to sing

With my head on your chest,

Your voice hollow and rumbling

While I'm looking at all of the room that I've saved

For more holes to be dug by somebody, someday

While I'm digging a hole in the ground

I'm wearing your boots, and I'm digging a hole in the ground

I see you teaching me how to lay fires

In a circle of rocks like this one where you'll lie

And I'm humming a lullaby you used to sing

With my head on your chest

Your voice hollow and rumbling

While I'm looking at all of the room that I've saved

For more holes to be dug by somebody, someday

While I'm digging a hole in the ground

I'm wearing your boots and I'm digging a hole in the ground

I'm wearing your boots and I'm digging a hole in the ground

You'll Always Live Inside Of Me(David Allan Coe/Bobby Charles)

You may sail across the water

Be any place that you might be

You may die and go to heaven

But you'll always live inside of me

You'll always live inside of me

You'll always live inside of me

Though you may sleep with someone else tonight

You'll always live inside of me

You may sail across the water

Be any place that you might be

You may die and go to heaven

But you'll always live inside of me

You'll always live inside of me

(Always, always)

You'll always live inside of me

Though you may sleep with someone else tonight

You'll always live inside of me

You'll always live inside of me

You'll always live inside of me

Though you may sleep with someone else tonight

You'll always live inside of me

You'll always live inside of me

You'll always live inside of me

Though you may sleep with someone else tonight

You'll always live inside of me

Go Away With Me

(Dan Welch / With Mamie Minch "For the Love of Hazel EP")

Go, go, go away with me

And I know you soon will forget

All the false love that's haunting your memories

Go and you'll never regret

Far from his heartless eyes

I can love you and you'll realize

That your life holds so much in store

When you're loved and you're wanted and adored

Go, go, go away with me

And I know you soon will forget

All the false love that's haunting your memories

Go and you'll never regret

You're his plaything and nothing more

He will hurt you he's done it before

Then you'll cry, cry, cry out in vain

For his heart to go wondering again

Go, go, go away with me

And I know you soon will forget

All the false love that keeps haunting your memories

Go and you'll never regret

It's Not Love (But It's Not Bad)

(Merle Haggard / With Mamie Minch "For the Love of Hazel EP")

She was always there each time I needed you

Holding on to me like I held on to you

We still don't have what you and I once had

No, it's not love but it's not bad

No, it's not love, not like ours was

It's not love but it keeps love from driving me mad

And I don't have to wonder who he's had

No, it's not love but it's not bad

I turn to him when you leave me alone

Sometimes even when you're here, and you're still gone

He's slowly changing what you leave so sad

No, it's not love but it's not bad

No, it's not love, not like ours was

It's not love but it keeps love from driving me mad

And I don't have to wonder who he's had

No, it's not love but it's not bad

No, it's not love, not like ours was

It's not love but it keeps love from driving me mad

And I don't have to wonder who he's had

No, it's not love but it's not bad

Mother Earth

(Memphis Slim / With Mamie Minch "For the Love of Hazel EP")

You may high-hat me all the time

You might never go my way

But Mother Earth is layin' for you

'Cause there's a debt you got to pay

Don't care how great you are

Don't care what you worth

When it all ends up

You got to go back to Mother Earth

You may own half the city

Even diamonds and pearls

You may buy yourself a plane

And fly all around the world

But don't care how great you are

Don't care how much you worth

When it all ends up

You got to go back to Mother Earth

You may play on the race horses

you may own a race track

You may have enough money baby

To buy anything you lack

I don't care how great you are

Don't care what you worth

When it all ends up

You got to go back to Mother Earth

You can dress some fancy clothes

Send your kids a fancy school

When you ??? lots of money

You can make up your own ???

But don't care how great you are

Don't care what you worth

When it all ends up

You got to go back to Mother Earth

Don't care how great you are

Don't care what you worth

When it all ends up

You got to go back to Mother Earth

When it all ends up

You got to go back to Mother Earth

When it all ends up

You got to go back to Mother Earth

Only The Lonely

(Hazel Dickens / With Mamie Minch "For the Love of Hazel EP")

Only the lonely

Only the lonely

Only the lonely will know

I've spent a lifetime

Searching for some kind

Of contentment in my soul

Just a little sunshine

Only sometimes

And a place to come in from the cold

Only the lonely

Only the lonely

Only the lonely will know

Lost and lonely

Longing for only

One ray of light

In this dark well of time

Only the lonely

Only the lonely

Only the lonely will know

Only the lonely

Only the lonely

Only the lonely will know

Scars from an Old Love

(Hazel Dickens / With Mamie Minch "For the Love of Hazel EP")

I held him as close as I dared to go

All his sweet love has started to show

I know that I need him, but trustin' his love

But the scars from an old love haven't quite healed enough

Yes the battle is over, but healing takes time

Leave it all of them old memories behind

I know that I need him, need him so much

But the scars from an old love haven't quite healed enough

Yes the battle is over, and the victor has fled

Wounded and dying, one lonely heart bled

Now love sounds her bugle, playing loves old sweet song

While the scars from an old love haven't quite all gone

I know that I love him, need him so much

But the scars from an old love haven't quite healed enough
