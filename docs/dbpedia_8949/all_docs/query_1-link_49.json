        "text": "Composer and conductor Alexandre Desplat, Oscar winner and seven-time Academy Award nominated, for his prolific filmography and his collaborations with Stephen Frears, Terrence Malick, Ang Lee, Kathryn Bigelow, Jacques Audiard, Wes Anderson, Roman Polanski, George Clooney or Matteo Garrone is one of the most worthy heirs of the French masters of film music.\n\nBrought up in a cultural and musical mix thanks to his Greek mother and his French father who studied and got married in California, he grew up listening to French symphonists, Ravel or Debussy , world music and jazz.\n\nHe studied piano and trumpet before choosing the flute as the main instrument. As a free auditor in Claude Ballif's analysis class at the CNSM, he enriches his classical musical education by studying Brazilian and African music. He will record later with Carlinhos Brown or Ray Lema.\n\nPassionate about film music, it's as much his musical sensitivity as his intimate approach to cinematographic language that will allow his privileged relationship with filmmakers. Inspired by the scores of Maurice Jarre, Bernard Herrmann, Nino Rota or Georges Delerue, it is after hearing the score of John Williams for Star Wars: Episode IV - Eine neue Hoffnung (1977) that he decides to compose exclusively for the big screen.\n\nDuring the recording of his first feature film he meets violinist Dominique Lemonnier. This is the beginning of an exceptional artistic exchange as she becomes her favorite soloist, artistic director and wife. With his strong sense of interpretation, his creative spirit and his singular violin playing, Solré inspired Alexandre's compositions, influencing his music in depth, initiating a new way of writing for the strings in the cinema.\n\nCollaborator of Jacques Audiard since his first film, he creates for his works strong and singular compositions and he won in 2005 for Der wilde Schlag meines Herzens (2005) the Silver Bear of the Berlinale, and his first Caesar. He works in France with Philippe de Broca and Francis Girod but Das Mädchen mit dem Perlenohrring (2003) of Peter Webber, his 50th score for the film, he gets a first Golden Globe nomination and BAFTA and began his rise in Hollywood. Leading American career and European collaborations and remaining faithful to his directors, he composes among others Syriana (2005)'s scores of Stephen Gaghan, Birth (2004) of Jonathan Glazer, Coco Chanel: Der Beginn einer Leidenschaft (2009) by Anne Fontaine, L'armée du crime (2009) by Robert Guédiguian, Largo Winch (2008) by Jérôme Salle, Der Feind in den eigenen Reihen - Intimate Enemies (2007) or Hostage - Entführt (2005) by Florent-Emilio Siri.\n\nPrizes and collaborations with the greatest directors follow one another. In 2007, he received his first Oscar nomination for Stephen Frears's Die Queen (2006) and won his first European Film Award. The same year, he won the Golden Globe, the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award, and the World Soundtrack Award for John Curran's score Der bunte Schleier (2006), performed by pianist Láng Lang. He composed in 2008 for Gefahr und Begierde (2007) by Ang Lee and Der seltsame Fall des Benjamin Button (2008) by David Fincher which will earn him a second Oscar nomination and a fourth Golden Globes and BAFTA nomination.\n\nWith his score for Der Ghostwriter (2010) by Roman Polanski, he won in 2010 a second César and a second European Film Award. The same year he wrote the music of New Moon - Biss zur Mittagsstunde (2009) by Chris Weitz, whose album was a platinum record, and Tom Hooper's The King's Speech - Die Rede des Königs (2010) for which he won the BAFTA, the Grammy Award, and was nominated for the fourth time at the Oscars and for the fifth time at the Golden Globes.\n\nIn 2010-2011 he wrote the music of Harry Potter und die Heiligtümer des Todes - Teil 1 (2010) and Harry Potter und die Heiligtümer des Todes - Teil 2 (2011) which became the third greatest success of all time. He composed in 2011 nine partitions, The Tree of Life (2011) of Terrence Malick, Der Gott des Gemetzels (2011) by Roman Polanski, Der fantastische Mr. Fox (2009) by George Clooney , which earned him another Oscar nomination, La fille du puisatier (2011) by Daniel Auteuil and The Ides of March - Tage des Verrats (2011) by George Clooney.\n\nIn 2012 he worked with Kathryn Bigelow for Zero Dark Thirty (2012), Matteo Garrone for Reality (2012), Gilles Bourdos for Renoir (2012), Jérôme Salle for Zulu - Blutiges Erbe (2013), George Clooney for Moonrise Kingdom (2012) and Jacques Audiard for Der Geschmack von Rost und Knochen (2012) for which he won a third Cesar. For his score of Argo (2012) of Ben Affleck, Oscar for Best Picture, it is named for the sixth time BAFTA, and for the fifth time at the Golden Globes and the Oscars.\n\nHe signed in 2013 the partition Monuments Men: Ungewöhnliche Helden (2014) from George Clooney, Venus im Pelz (2013) of Roman Polanski, and was appointed to the BAFTAs and the Oscars for Philomena: Eine Mutter sucht ihren Sohn (2013) of Stephen Frears.\n\nIn 2014 he composed the music Godzilla (2014) of Gareth Edwards, and receives exceptional fact, two Oscar nominations for The Imitation Game - Ein streng geheimes Leben (2014) of Morten Tyldum and Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) by George Clooney, for which he won a BAFTA, Grammy and Oscar.\n\nMember of the jury of the Cannes Film Festival in 2012, he became in 2014 the first composer President of the jury of the Venice Film Festival. Crowning long years of collaboration, he directed the London Symphony Orchestra in December 2014 for a concert of his works at the Barbican Theater in London.\n\nIn 2018, Alexandre Desplat received a second Oscar, a Golden Globe and a BAFTA for Shape of Water: Das Flüstern des Wassers (2017) of Guillermo del Toro.\n\nComposer and conductor Alexandre Desplat, Oscar winner and seven-time Academy Award nominated, for his prolific filmography and his collaborations with Stephen Frears, Terrence Malick, Ang Lee, Kathryn Bigelow, Jacques Audiard, Wes Anderson, Roman Polanski, George Clooney or Matteo Garrone is one of the most worthy heirs of the French masters of film music.\n\nBrought up in a cultural and musical mix thanks to his Greek mother and his French father who studied and got married in California, he grew up listening to French symphonists, Ravel or Debussy , world music and jazz.\n\nHe studied piano and trumpet before choosing the flute as the main instrument.

He's as adept working with a 50 piece philharmonic orchestra as he is with a wall of modular synths, playing a bass guitar or building his own physical and digital instruments. His drive to reimagine what's possible and share that knowledge with the next generation of composers is what makes Holkenborg a unique force, and one of the most in-demand film composers in the world.\n\nTom's film scoring credits have grossed over $2 billion at the box office and include Mad Max: Fury Road, Deadpool, Black Mass, Alita: Battle Angel, Divergent, Brimstone, Justice League: The Snyder Cut, Godzilla vs. Kong, The Dark Tower, Tomb Raider, Terminator: Dark Fate, the record setting Sonic the Hedgehog and forthcoming projects including The 355, Army of The Dead, 3000 Years of Longing and more. He has worked with directors and producers including Peter Jackson, Robert Rodriguez, James Cameron, George Miller, Christopher Nolan, Zack Snyder and Tim Miller among many others.\n\nAn educator as well as a creator, Tom is committed to breaking down the barriers of entry in the world of film composition, creating the free SCORE Academy program in Los Angeles, a music composition program at the ArtEZ conservatorium in his home country of the Netherlands, and on YouTube, where he hosts his educational series StudioTime, which has been watched millions of times.\n\nTom is able to draw on his extensive knowledge of classical forms and structures while keeping one finger planted firmly on the pulse of popular music. When his eclectic background is paired with his skill as a multi-instrumentalist (he plays keyboards, guitar, drums, violin, and bass) and a mastery of studio technology, a portrait emerges of an artist for whom anything is possible. Outside of his own artistry Tom's desire to marry technology and classical composition to initiate change and evolution led him to partner with Orchestral Tools in 2019 to create Junkie XL Brass, his first sample library, making world-class sounds available to composers everywhere.\n\nFernando Velázquez (Getxo, 1976) is a composer of music for film, television and theatre, a creator of concerto music, a cellist and an orchestra conductor.\n\nThe soundtrack genre has allowed him to bring symphonic music to mass audiences and, above all, to explore very different expressive and narrative possibilities, from fantasy films to drama and comedy.\n\nHe has composed award-winning and memorable soundtracks for films including all those by J.A. Bayona, such as El orfanato (The Orphanage), The Impossible and Un monstruo viene a verme (A Monster Calls), the latter of which was awarded the Goya for Best Original Score in 2017. He also composed the music for some of the highest-grossing films in Spanish cinema's history, such as Ocho apellidos vascos (Spanish Affair), Los ojos de Julia (Julia's Eyes), El silencio de la ciudad blanca (The Silence of the White City), Contratiempo (The Invisible Guest) and series such as Patria, El inocente (The Innocent) and the upcoming Alma, among others. His Hollywood experience includes films such as Guillermo del Toro's The Scarlet Summit and M. Night Shyamalan's The Evil Trap. He was asked by Wim Wenders to score his 2017 film Submergence. He has also enjoyed a significant and award-winning career as a classical musician and composer. Among his more than 250 symphonic compositions, the record release of 'Viento' is a particular highlight. It is also worth mentioning Humanity at Music, a cantata translated into several languages which has become the international anthem of cooperativism. It is part of an inter-cooperative artistic project bringing together artistic disciplines such as music, storytelling, singing, illustration, theatre and dance. Also of note is Concierto para trombón y orquesta (Concerto for Trombone and Orchestra), recorded by Ximo Vicedo and Euskadiko Orkestra in 2020. As a conductor, he has led London's Philharmonia, the London Metropolitan, the Czech National Orchestra, the Budapest Radio Orchestra, and the symphony orchestras of RTVE, Bilbao, Euskadi, Extremadura, Galicia, Comunidad de Madrid, Navarra, Murcia, Principado de Asturias and Seville, among others. As an arranger, he has worked on orchestral arrangements of pieces by other composers, such as a version of the famous Cántico espiritual by Amancio Prada, based on the poems of San Juan de la Cruz, or his collaboration on Jorge Drexler's latest album, Tinta y tiempo, among many others.\n\nBorn on the 18th of July, 1972, in Cracow, Poland. In 1996 graduated the instrumental studies (specialization: cello), and then in 2000 graduated with merit from the composition class of Krzysztof Penderecki at the Music Academy in Cracow. At the same Academy, in the years 1999-2000, he was an assistant at the Department of Composition, Conducting and Musical Theory. His compositions were performed at the most important festivals in Poland, Germany, Slovakia, Moldavia, Ukraine and Belarus. He also composed music for numerous drama plays and films - features, documentaries and shorts.\n\nIn 1998 he received the Creative Scholarship of the President of Cracow in the category of music composition. Two years later, at the 25th Polish Feature Film Festival in Gdynia he received the Golden Lions - individual award for the musical score to the film \"Big Animal\". In 2001 he was nominated by \"Film\" monthly to their Golden Duck Award for extraordinary achievement in film music. At the same time \"Cinema\" monthly included him on their list of top Polish film music composers. Also in 2001 his symphonic composition Hypnosis had its premiere in Berlin (the orchestra was Sinfonietta Cracovia, conducted by Krzysztof Penderecki), which was broadcast live by Deutsche Radio.\n\nIn 2002 he received Ludwik Award (a theatre award from the city of Cracow) for the score to \"Kafka\", and also Jancio Wodnik Award at Prowincjonalia Film Festival, for his score for the feature film \"An Angel in Cracow\". According to \"Kino\" monthly, his music for the controversial documentary \"Evolution\" (the film was awarded the prestigious Golden Gate Award at the 45th Film Festival in San Francisco) was \"an achievement of an entirely original kind\". In 2004 he created a new score for Fritz Lang's \"Metropolis\". A monumental 147-minute composition for an 90-piece orchestra, 60 choir and 2 solo voices ambitiously re-interpreting the silent movie from 1927.\n\nIn 2005, during the 14th Golden Knight International Film Festival in Russia, he received Golden Knight Award for best composer, for music for the film \"Tomorrow's Weather\".\n\nJohn Lunn's music possesses a wonderfully unique voice that spans a wide spectrum of musical styles. Classically trained, yet contemporary in attitude, he combines a highly intelligent and sensitive approach with a sound that always hits at the emotional heart of a piece. His scores, which match the highest production values with a continual desire to discover new colours and sounds, are continuously in high demand. He is probably best known for scoring the hugely successful flagship ITV/NBC/PBS/Carnival Films drama, Downton Abbey, for which he has received two Primetime Emmy Awards, in 2012 and 2013 and a further nomination in 2014.\n\nJohn's recent work includes ITV/PBS/Lovely Day's adaption of The Grantchester Mysteries by author James Runcie, Red Planet's epic WW1 drama The Passing Bells, the feature film Electricity starring Agyness Deyn, just released in the UK; Burton And Taylor (starring Dominic West and Helena Bonham-Carter), Shetland, The White Queen (based on the bestselling novel by Phillipa Gregory), for which he also received a Primetime Emmy nomination in 2014, and the reimagining of Hitchcock's classic The Lady Vanishes, all for the BBC.\n\nHe is currently scoring The Last Kingdom, an adaptation of Bernard Cornwell's best selling \"The Saxon Stories\" for BBC/BBC America. 2015 will also see him working on Downton Abbey series 6, and a further series of Grantchester.\n\nHe has received critical acclaim for three adaptations of Charles Dickens classics: the BBC/Masterpiece centenary adaptation of The Mystery Of Edwin Drood, for which he was nominated for an Ivor Novello Award (2013), a 14-part re-imagining of Little Dorrit(2008), which garnered both a BAFTA nomination and his first Primetime Emmy nomination, and Bleak House (2006) , for which he received RTS Best Score and Best Title nominations."
