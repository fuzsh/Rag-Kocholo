The original aim of the series was to revisit the concepts and indeed controversies that have shaped the field of film studies. Our intention was twofold: to clarify what was initially at stake in the founding texts and also to clarify lines of transmission and reinterpretation in what remains a hybrid field of study, which has “appropriated” and thus modified much of what it uses. The seven volumes published to date have taken different approaches to this central mission. They have reviewed how early film theory adopted and developed literary theories of “strangeness” (ostrannennie); shifting concepts of subjectivity engendered by film; the variety of ways that film’s audiences have been conceived; the persistence of debate around film as a technology; the continuing proliferation of screens; the foundational link between modern feminism and film theory; and most recently the centrality of “stories” to modern media discourse. All of these have retained a commitment to debate, bringing together scholars who belong to different traditions and schools of thought, and indeed language communities. With the support of our institutions in three countries (the Netherlands, France and Britain), and our enterprising publisher Amsterdam University Press, we provide a platform to air differences, while also demonstrating that film and media studies – transnational and transmedial – occupy a central position in contemporary intellectual and cultural life. Coincidentally, at the time of this present volume’s preparation, a public health emergency occurred that has affected all our countries and communities and which has dramatically drawn attention once more to the role that “domesticated” screen media play in all our lives. The recent shut-down of communal cultural activity may also have created a new appreciation of the place of film and cinema in the contemporary media environment. It therefore seems timely that our latest volume should address what would be called in vernacular English discourse “the elephant in the room.” Have we indeed entered a “post-cinema” era; and what are the implications for concepts and theories shaped by more than a century of film and cinema seeming synonymous? As the series enters its second decade, with future volumes under discussion, we are confident that there has never been greater need for a\n\n10 Post- cinema\n\nshared international space of debate, enabling and encouraging constructive engagement with the major issues affecting how we think about the dominant media of our era. Paris / Amsterdam / Groningen / London Dominique Chateau, José Moure, Annie van den Oever, Ian Christie\n\nAcknowledgments Post-cinema is the eighth volume in the series The Key Debates. As with previous books (Ostrannenie 2010; Subjectivity 2011; Audiences 2012; Technē/ Technology 2014; Feminisms 2015; Screens 2016; Stories 2018), it is organized around a key topic that crosses and shapes the field of film studies. We are very grateful to Amsterdam University Press for offering us the opportunity to enter into a debate that is at the heart of questions about the changes that the cinema is undergoing after more than a century of existence. The concept of “Post-cinema” asks us not only to think of moving images in terms of media theory and transformations of film and cinema but also to focus on the relationship between cinema and art, especially contemporary art. This volume explores new ways of considering, experiencing and making films in a time of technological transition. It brings together an international group of scholars and artists from a variety of countries, who speak different languages and come from different cultural and disciplinary backgrounds. This book is dedicated to the memory of our colleague and friend Céline Scemama and Agnès Varda. For their generous contributions, we sincerely thank Dudley Andrew, Wang Bing, Victor Burgin, Francesco Casetti, Richard Conte, Gérard Courant, Miriam De Rosa, Giovanna Fossati, André Gaudreault, Christophe Génin, Malte Hagener, François Jost, Philippe Marion, Andrea Pinotti, Gabriela Rivadaneira Crespo, Annie van den Oever, Christophe Viart, and Eugénie Zvonkine. Additionally, we wish to thank the translators and in particular Naòmi Morgan for her translations from the French. The project has depended vitally on generous funding from the Research Institute ACTE (Arts, Création,Théorie, Esthétique) – Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne, and the University of Groningen, without which it would not have been possible. Special acknowledgment and warm thanks are due to the Senior Commissioning Editor, Film Media and Communication of AUP, Maryse Elliott, who provided us with extremely generous support. We also thank heartily the editorial board of the Key Debates series, in particular Annie van den Oever and Ian Christie who have offered us invaluable and friendly help and advice. Finally, we would like to pay tribute to copyeditors Wendy Stone and Viola ten Hoorn, whose ceaseless efforts and professionalism have made the process of piecing the essays together\n\n12 Post- cinema\n\nso much easier for both of us, and to acknowledge the continuing support of Chantal Nicolaes, Head of Desk Editing and Production at AUP. Dominique Chateau and José Moure Paris, summer 2020.\n\n1. Introduction Dominique Chateau and José Moure For some time now, in newspapers and books, a series of words keep appearing that begin with the prefix “post-.” As for these new words, the key to understanding seems to be a semantics of ambiguity. Post does not indicate something absolutely different but something in-between: postcapitalism would be a new phase of capitalism; postmodernism, a new figure of modernism; and post-history, history again. In all these cases, to the same question – does “post-” mean a clear break or the more or less identifiable result of an evolution? – the same answer arises: “post-” is a “problematic prefix” that “debates over postmodernism and postmodernity taught us to treat not as a marker of definitive beginnings and ends, but as indicative of a more subtle shift or transformation in the realm of culturally dominant aesthetic and experiential forms” (Denson and Leyda 2016, 6). This astute remark can be found in Shane Denson and Julia Leyda’s introduction to Post-cinema: Theorizing 21st-Century Film, a high-quality collection of texts published in 2016. In addition to the editors, the contributors include Lev Manovich, Steven Shaviro, Vivian Sobchack and Francesco Casetti. Considering this title and ours, it is obvious that the two projects look very similar. Apart from our call for new contributors and the fact that most of the texts in this volume are newly published or translated into American English (in Denson and Leyda’s book all the texts are republished in a more or less revised form), we can clarify the different points or nuances that specify our approach of the hypothetical notion of post-cinema. Not surprisingly, this differentiation is particularly notable in the subtitles (that are, in fact, most often used for this purpose): Denson and Leyda’s Theorizing 21st-Century Film becomes our Cinema in the Post-art Era. Two crucial points can be made here: in the subtitle to this volume “cinema” seems to be rid of the embarrassing “post-” (which is, admittedly, contradicted in advance by the title); a second “post-” emerges at the same time as a new partner is introduced, art. Despite its sophisticated appearance, it means something very simple: we have chosen to focus the attention on the relationship between\n\nChateau, D., and J. Moure. Post-cinema: Cinema in the Post-art Era. Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press, 2020 doi 10.5117/9789463727235_ch01\n\n14\n\nDominique Chateau and José Moure\n\ncinema and art, especially contemporary art and on the current transformations of films and cinema that attest to such a relationship. At present, it seems the practice of art is also seen through the same lens, pointing us in similar directions: art is supposed to have metamorphosed into post-art and thus is simultaneously non-art, or a kind of almost-art, quasi-art, may-be-art, and so on – at any rate, it is ambiguously identifiable as art. It so happens that cinema is part of this change and the resulting state of ambiguity …\n\nInterpreting “Post-cinema” However, to begin with, ambiguity is also a characteristic of post-cinema. Considering the different ways in which this word can be interpreted, we also observe the same kind of ambiguity that affects words such as postmodernism. Whatever the interpretation, post-cinema is not seen as encompassing an absolute change in terms of film form and, correspondingly, the emergence of a new medium, nor an absolute change of cinema dispositif and, accordingly, the end of theater, projection and cinemagoing. Post-cinema is in a state of unstable equilibrium between the original, persistent cinema dispositif and new ways of making and considering the film, as well as its mode of working in the postmodern cultural context. As Denson and Leyda write, “post-cinema asks us to think about new media not only in terms of novelty but in terms of an ongoing, uneven, and indeterminate historical transition” (2016, 2). This reflects the prevalent state of mind in this book and anticipates some subsequent research tracks. To be more precise, as soon as we consider the ways of interpreting post-cinema, we are led to thinking about key issues, not only in terms of media theory but also in terms of art practice. When measuring the scope of post-cinema, we find a scale of radicality from “cinema death” to intermediality, through decay or metamorphosis. The cinema death theme, at the height of radicality, cannot be discussed without considering three aspects of media definition: the medium, as such; the dispositif; and spectatorship. The question then arises as to whether the death of cinema can be decreed on the basis of one of these criteria or whether the theme involves all of them. Transposed into the media theory question, it means: is cinema defined by film, theater, cinemagoing, or any combination of these characteristics? It seems that the scale of radicality is established according to the degree of requirement we impose on our response. If we require that the three criteria be met, we must consider that the film watched on a smartphone screen is not cinema. But if this film is a\n\nIntroduc tion\n\n15\n\nHollywood classic with famous stars, how can we refuse to associate with it the memory of cinema? Post-cinema presupposes the imaginary aspect of cinema. It is not only an “after” of the cinema that would replace it, that would have absorbed or liquidated it. Firstly, it was born before term since this kind of word is always fixed after the fact. There has already been a post-cinema at the time of cinema, from its birth until the present, but it was not yet clearly distinguished as such. In a way, behind the scenes, it is the more or less noticeable introduction of various kinds of film practices and conceptions in relation to its form or the ways of receiving it. Similarly, considering the current state of affairs which is of primary interest to us in this book, many present experiences deviating from mainstream cinema do not seem to have cut the umbilical cord; quite the contrary, they are haunted by the cinema from which they are supposed to differ. Some texts at the beginning of the present book return to the lasting debate around the radical question of cinema death. By this point, this debate is beginning to take on Groundhog Day-like characteristics – the 1993 film by Harold Ramis was renamed Un jour sans fin (An Endless Day) in French release – with its constant narrative restarts; that said, it does lead to a fundamental question about cinema as an anthropological and aesthetic phenomenon. But it does not lead to a definite answer; moreover, it is during this discussion that a doubt arises about the relevance of radicality. It does not mean that we should give up. On the contrary, it means that film- and media theory require subtlety in a dialectic sense. Cinema has not lost itself in its metamorphosis into post-cinema because, while it has lost some of its characteristics and prerogatives, it has gained others. After all, the possibility of watching a Hollywood classic on a mobile phone in public transport, even if the result is obviously less desirable than a theater screening – at least a good one under technically impeccable conditions (which is not always the case today) – is a privilege in the same way that using this mobile phone to communicate with friends or call for help is an advantage. If it is a mere fact that the production-distribution-reception of many films, however artistic they may be, still have the form of a work in the “traditional” sense, it is just as relevant to speculate that their form is shifting as these “regular” films are affected by the post-art culture. Among other changes, these films that remain works can be displaced in conditions more or less remote from the dispositif of the theater, such as the “relocation,” as Francesco Casetti calls it, using devices of all kinds that change the films. This suggests, instead of repeating what is now well-known about this topic, an interest in measuring the feedback of the new modes of audiovisual\n\n16\n\nDominique Chateau and José Moure\n\npractice on films, more precisely, how they are designed, structured and manufactured. Parallel to the integration of contemporary art in “regular” cinema, we need to think of the integration of cinema into contemporary art in all kinds of forms of creation and exhibition. Since we have chosen to open up the field of research by integrating the post-cinema question within the post-art question, let us recall that it would be simplistic to imagine a state of culture where art would have disappeared entirely (just as cinema death is only metaphorically, not literally, physically acquired). We are rather in a place envisioned by postmodern artists who claim an art that is at the same time non-art, or vice versa. Facing the introduction in various art fields of things or acts that differ from the work of art that is fully recognizable as such, cinema seems both to resist and to collaborate. It still produces works in the “old” format but is simultaneously immersed in many aspects of art in its current state. The study of this subject from any angle shows that sooner or later any problem relating to post-cinema ends up looking like Russian dolls. Moreover, we can consider the series of dolls from the point of view of their decreasing size or from the opposite direction. In decreasing order, we go from the global context of the cultural industry to the form of the film, including the dispositifs. In increasing order, the perspective seems to be broadened. However, at the same time, we seem to lose the accuracy that film analysis promises. This book will, undoubtedly, give the impression of broadening the scope in terms of a comparison of texts focusing strictly on the movie arena. Nevertheless, our wish to reformulate the question of post-cinema through the topic of the relationship between the cinema and contemporary art also signifies the assumption that the objects of this transaction must not be left on the sidelines in favor of too many theoretical generalities.\n\nAbout the Book The first part of the book begins with a tribute to “Influential French New Wave Filmmaker” (The New York Times) Agnès Varda, who passed away March 29, 2019 at the age of 90 – we don’t know what conclusion to draw from the repetition of the number 9! Her death was announced by various newspapers and websites, whose headlines – “Beloved French New Wave Director” (The Guardian), “Legendary French New Wave Director” (The Local.fr) – all seemed to include the New Wave label, providing a convenient location, both justified and lazy. When considering the career of such a great artist, we are inevitably referred to a glorious past. Paying tribute to\n\nIntroduc tion\n\n17\n\nAgnès Varda by analyzing Beaches of Agnès, her 2006 autobiographical film, José Moure draws attention to the fact that the film itself intermixed with its “making of” has the singular form of a narrated puzzle from which a new kind of documentary emerges. (Further on, in chapter 14, Dominique Chateau completes the tribute by considering Varda’s forays into the world of contemporary art.) Through her most recent films, as well as her exhibitions, Agnès Varda can be considered a major figure in post-cinema. PART II of the book – The End of Cinema? – revolves around the question of the fate of cinema which, according to disparate hypotheses, goes from end to rebirth. In what at first appears a book review of Francesco Casetti’s The Lumière Galaxy: Seven Key Words for the Cinema to Come, Dudley Andrew’s text provides an overview of the most general and crucial discussion that the post-cinema theme has called attention to. First released in Cultural Critique in 2017, it highly deserves to be included in this volume because of the synoptic view it offers. Dudley Andrew not only brings together several theorists who participate in the debate throughout the globalized world – Laura Mulvey, Jacques Aumont, Raymond Bellour, Philippe Dubois, André Gaudreault, Philippe Marion, David N. Rodowick, Francesco Casetti – but also reignites this debate that could be considered a scholastic quarrel about a process whose outcome is still uncertain – the end of cinema! – if it were not a historical mutation, the practical consequences of which we experience every day. Some partners in the dialogue initiated by Andrew appear in this book with new questions. In their text, André Gaudreault and Philippe Marion give a new formulation to the end of cinema issue: “What remains of cinema?” Arguing from a mainly nominalist perspective, they find their answer in cinema’s “resilience”: cinema is “hanging tough.” This resilience of cinema depends on what we are talking about in terms of technological evolution (digitalization) and cultural differences (are we talking about cinephilia or the ordinary practice of cinema?). They examine the different hypotheses arising from the point of view of the range of words it mobilizes (cinema, movie, moving images, and so on). Referring to a, rather comical yet telling, BogdanovitchWelles dialogue and the recent Netflix controversy during the Cannes or Venice festivals, Gaudreault and Marion iterate that differences in naming are “highly significant.” Finally, the authors consider the question: is it more important to define cinema (whatever the name!) or to produce “interesting film stories” as Guillermo del Toro suggests? The next contribution by Céline Scemama is of special value to us. A Godard specialist, Céline scrupulously deciphered the multiple artistic references contained in Godard’s masterpiece Histoire(s) du cinema (that\n\n18\n\nDominique Chateau and José Moure\n\ncan be understood here in the sense of the companion-worker’s tour de force). For her arduous work she received a brilliant doctorate from the PanthéonSorbonne University, Paris 1, which was followed by a book that is now a standard reference work: Histoire(s) du cinéma de Jean-Luc Godard – La force faible d’un art. She beamed forth affection but, disappointed by life, took her own in 2017. The present text, which constitutes the introduction to her book, is a double tribute: to Céline, a very dear friend, and to JLG who, from the start of his oeuvre to Livre d’images (2018), sought in the obstinate invention of a post-cinema the very essence of this art. Halfway between Montaigne’s essay and Rembrandt’s self-portrait, Histoire(s) du cinema is also halfway between the origin of cinema and its destiny as post-art. PART III examines various Technological Transformations due to digitalization. We are very happy to welcome in this part, Victor Burgin who, as a renowned artist 1 could just as easily have been included in the last section Post-cinema, an Artists’ Affair. But instead opens this part of the book with his proposal of a theoretical reflection on the technological transformations of what he calls the “field of ‘photofilmic’ practices.” He postulates that “cinema” directs our minds to “technological mutation,” while “art” evokes the “ideologico-economic appropriation.” Using as a framework of reasoning themes that gave rise to the publications of the Key Debates series – screen and stories – and adding the idea of the virtual object as resulting from the convergence of the digital with the contemporary, he highlights the advent of new “photofilmic narrative forms” which, characterized by the combination of complexity and affectivity, “offer alternatives to the mass-produced verisimilitude of hegemonic mass culture.” Dedicated to Thomas Elsaesser, “a leading figure in film criticism” (The New York Times, December 19, 2019) and a friend who died on December 4 in Beijing at the age of 76, Giovanna Fossati and Annie van den Oever’s dialogue reflects on the “death of cinema” topic but from the perspective of film archival practice and national film institutes. Their starting point is both the fact that some of these institutes remain – an index of the cinema persistence – and Giovanna Fossati’s reflection on processes of digitalization which raises the question as to whether the notion of film is still relevant in this new technological context. Analogous to the way in which Walter Benjamin treated the new phenomenon of mechanical reproduction, digitalization concerns both reproduction and creation. Today, the digital creation 1 For example, we recently watched his “digital looping video” The Little House (2005, 17’) inside the Carmelites Chapel at Saint-Denis Museum of Art and History (France) as part of the exhibition Enfermement (Confinement), April-October 2019.\n\nIntroduc tion\n\n19\n\naspect is discussed frequently; whereas, it is less common to consider the problems of the archival practice in the digital age. Thus, the exchange of views between Fossati and Van den Oever in this volume provides a useful perspective on the issue of digital archiving. It also deeply enriches the idea of post-cinema, more precisely, the idea of “a new post-cinematic ecology.” Despite a series of material changes to the medium throughout its history, cinema has remained a “common immersive experience” insofar as it was based on the illusion of reality. However, the most important change is that this is no longer true: post-cinema, writes Christophe Génin, can be considered a defection of the original experience of watching movies. This situation has to do with social and economic transformations, implying the conversion of the cultural industry to service to the person and a deep variation in the aesthetic experience, which Génin proposes to understand through an analysis of the experience of individual screens in aircraft. A confined space such as an aircraft seat isolates the individual to whom it is offered in a moment of “solipsism of caprice.” At the beginning of PART IV – New Dispositif, New Conditions – François Jost asks: “What kind of art is the cinema of interactions?” With this question, he promotes the concept of interaction, but his intention is not to extend the current theory that defines by interaction the use of cinema, both in the early stages of its history and in the post-cinema situation. Rather, it is to analyze “a work that presents itself as openly interactive: Bandersnatch” (2018), a part of the science-fiction anthology series Black Mirror. He proposes to carry out this analysis with the help of Goodman and Genette, especially the two major concepts previously coined by the former: autography and allography. This duality helps to answer the question as to whether the opposition between film and TV series has to do with differences in artistic quality; a debate exacerbated by Netflix’s candidacy at film festivals. Additionally, using a comparison with music partitions (Pierre Boulez’s third piano sonata in relation to Netflix!), he wonders whether the viewer of the interactive work may be called an operator, a performer or a player … or, more likely, an interpreter. His/her status has to do both with the model of the musician who has the choice to structure parts of the work and the hermeneut who gives meaning to it. Designing his text according to the model “Engführung,” a musical technique of the fugue where a new theme overlaps with the previous one, Malte Hagener considers two dimensions of the changes in the audiovisual field: the first is exemplified by the Netflix platform on the economic and logistical level; the second concerns the aesthetic consequences of this new model of production and distribution. Characterized by a high level of autonomy and\n\n20\n\nDominique Chateau and José Moure\n\nself-consciousness of this status, Netflix’s system is transforming the practice of film and the notion we have of it. A striking aspect of the strong link that is thus established between the production system and the film form can be observed in the fact that Netflix’s productions are self-allegorizations of Netflix’s system. Referencing Bird Box (2018), the “post-apocalyptic thriller” (Wikipedia) directed by Susanne Bier and starring Sandra Bullock, Hagener exemplifies that a post-cinema movie may be positioned between cinema, television and new media, appearing as a “self-allegory of its own position in a new media environment, especially concerning its production logic.” With Francesco Casetti and Andrea Pinotti’s point of view in their “Post-cinema Ecology,” we return to Christophe Génin’s issue, albeit from a different perspective more similar to Jost’s. Instead of developing the general theme of the immersive experience, they exemplify it by way of a special focus on Alejandro G. Iñárritu’s Carne y arena, an interactive virtual reality installation presented at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival, insofar as it testifies to the formal and spectatorial transformations that are rightly referred to as post-cinema. More generally, emphasizing the characteristics of “unframedness, presentness, and immediateness,” this kind of work draws our attention to the phenomenology of the film experience. Drawing from Charles Peirce, Adolfo Bioy Casares’s La invención de Morel and the zoologist Adolf Portmann’s theories of animal perception, they propose going beyond phenomenology (and ontology) with the project of an iconic ecology based on the concept of phaneron, the appearance as it is perceived for itself. PART V, Transformations in Film Form, deals with the idea of identifying among the vast field of film production those that can be considered “part of a contemporary way of thinking and making art in a postmodern era” as Gabriela Rivadeneira Crespo writes. It means that some filmmakers or artists decide to put art at the heart of their creation, that this relationship between cinema and art may be applied to its concept, as well as to various aspects of the process of creation. One way in which to consider this kind of “art contemporary turn” is to examine the different incursions of cinema from the point of view of the contemporary art space. But, instead of following this track, instead of asking how cinema participates in this contemporary art experience, Miriam De Rosa asks “how the contemporary experience of moving images is articulated when it enters art spaces.” This topic deals not only with the hypothesis of a change in film form and medium from the moment the film is destined for an unusual space but also with the reverse movement of the presence of film transforming the foreign space into a different and personalized place. From this point of view, Miriam De Rosa analyzes a series of exhibitions: Sleepwalkers (2007), Aitken’s five\n\nIntroduc tion\n\n21\n\nvideo pieces projected on MoMA’s external walls; Marta Minujín’s Mesunda Reloaded (2019) at the New Museum in New York; and the work of the Milanbased collective Studio Azzurro, especially their Sensitive Environments exhibition which reflects the space-image in an artistic context. For her part, Gabriela Rivadeneira Crespo analyzes a Mariano Llinás film, Extraordinary Stories (Historias Extraordinarias) because, with this 2008 movie by the Argentinean filmmaker, the “productivity of cinema devices” is brought into question so that it fully exemplifies the type of postmodern film where cinema and contemporary art collaborate. Paradoxically, this kind of film, given the radical choices that govern it, places it in an expanded film, but marginalizes it in relation to the cinema industry. The locations and modes of reception of such films are also part of the definition of post-cinema in the post-art era. For Dominique Chateau, post-art can, essentially, be characterized by the formula: art, otherwise than art. It means that in the institutional context presently governing art, the artworks or what serves as such, including objects or acts claiming non-art, are explicitly exhibited as art while different kinds of physical or mental attitudes are allowed toward them that have nothing to do with art in the first place. It is in this art, otherwise than art context that cinema and contemporary art are mutually challenging. This is quite obvious when we consider the meeting of cinema with the dispositifs of exhibition spaces; the intrusion of cinema into art or post-art places. More generally, this possibility opens news paths for creation: new filmic form (which is well exemplified by the race to make the longest film); changes in creators’ status (as we can see with the examples of the Japanese filmmaker, Hamaguchi Ryusuke;2 the French artist, Pierre Huyghe; or the French filmmaker, Michel Gondry); and the advent of exhibitions of a new kind (Agnès Varda and David Lynch). The text concludes with the symptomatic example of Agnès Varda and JR’s Visages, Villages, a collaboration that has produced a singular documentary road movie … To remain with a somewhat outdated division of labor, post-cinema in the post-art era can arise from the meeting of filmmakers and artists, but also from the collaboration of two artists, as in the case of Zidane: A 21st Century Portrait (2006), a film created and directed by Douglas Gordon and Philippe Parreno. Cameras placed around the Bernabéu stadium in Madrid where a match is taking place follow the well-known football (or soccer as the Americans have it) player, Zinédine Zidane, from the beginning 2 Asian names – Japanese, Korean, Chinese – are written in this book in their traditional form: surname first.\n\n22\n\nDominique Chateau and José Moure\n\nof the game until his dismissal. In this volume, Richard Conte examines this special portrait paying particular attention to how the film focuses primarily on Zidane, that is, on somebody who is in a state of what Diderot calls absorption in his task – in this case, playing a football match – in the kind of dance that a football game resembles. Conte also focuses on details that could only be captured by the artistic filmic device. By providing an in-depth analysis of this new device and its astonishing filmic result, Conte is able to call attention to a social aspect of post-cinema that deserves to be mentioned: mere artistic influence can elevate just about anything to the rank of art and thus in Zidane “elitist contemporary art meets the most popular sport of the world and one of its most emblematic figures.” PART VI of the book, Post-cinema, an Artists’ Affair, is devoted to artists and their work. Previously considered, Godard and Burgin could as easily have been involved here, as much as, for example, Llinás and Huyghe, even if their ways of investing in the field of creation differ. In this part, we consider a kind of filmmaker whose behavior or works can be considered from the viewpoint of the artist’s contemporary standard. However, we start with the opposite movement: an artist making films. It could well have been Marcel Duchamp, insofar as the avant-garde of the 1920s foreshadowed post-cinema and, moreover, post-cinema integrated within the (post-)art issue. Among the most interesting and humorous artists that Duchamp has inspired, Christophe Viart proposes considering another of Marcel’s incursions into film: Marcel Broodthaers was a Belgian contemporary artist whose range of activities covered poetry and (post-)cinema. A single film can have considerable theoretical power. This is the case with La pluie (Projet pour un texte) [The Rain (Project for a Text)], a 1969 two-minute 16mm black-and-white film, which portrays Broodthaers attempting to write on a paper in the rain. Is it a film? Is it cinema? This the material of a regular film, but not the spirit. We are definitely in the post-art era … Next up is Russian film director Ilya Khrzhanovsky, whose film adaptation of Kora Landau-Drobantseva’s book The Academician Landau: How we Lived (1999) resulted in an immense project, entitled DAU, spanning several years, encompassing cinema and art among other things. In her text about DAU, Eugénie Zvonkine delves deeper into Khrzhanovsky’s ambitious project. Because what is DAU exactly? Is it Ilya Khrzhanovsky’s project as a whole or his films or the main character? In order to clarify this complexity, Zvonkine proposes “write[ing] DAU for the whole project, Dau for the films and Dau to designate the main character.” On the face of it, it seems to resemble Aesop’s The Frog and the Ox whose moral is: “Do not attempt the impossible.” Yet, that’s exactly what the young filmmaker did, who at that time was merely\n\nIntroduc tion\n\n23\n\nknown for “a single, although much remarked, feature film, Four (2004).” Dau tells the story of Kora Landau-Drobantseva’s husband, Lev Landau, a remarkable man, known by the nickname Dau, who professed freedom in private life in stark contrast to the political USSR Stalinist regime of fear and terror under which he lived. Not only did Khrzhanovsky make thirteen feature films of a duration from 1.5 to 6 hours but he also decided to include the screenings in huge installations, investing, in particular, in the Parisian Théâtre du Chatelet and the Théâtre de la Ville which were in reconstruction at the time, giving the whole DAU project the fascinating scale of a total artwork. Independent filmmaker Gérard Courant is a fan of early post-cinema. Since the mid-1970s, he has been one of those pioneers who seeks to test its limits (from the very beginning of cinema), from within and without, from the center of the medium to its peripheries. This does not mean that he belongs to the past. On the contrary, he continues his quest, never ceasing to accumulate a considerable number of films and, in particular, one film or series of films, which continues to grow, the Cinématon(s), which is at the heart of our dialogue. Courant was kind enough to receive us in his apartment at Montreuil (Paris suburb), a place full of films and books – not only books on cinema but also on cycling since Courant is a big fan of the Tour de France. No matter the field, he has the mentality of a collector. As regards cinema, it would be more accurate to say: an encyclopedic mentality. His work, an accumulation of numerous filmic portraits of personalities as well as filmed street inventories, is of considerable extension. It is in this very principle of infinite proliferation of films of varying lengths that we find a kind of Mnemosyne cinema challenging the “de-definition” (Harold Rosenberg) of cinema that transforms it into post-art. Born in 1967 in Xi’an in the Shaanxi Province, Wang Bing is one of the greatest representatives of contemporary Chinese cinema (along with Jia Zhangke). After studying photography at Luxun Arts University in Shenyang and film at Beijing Film Academy, he directed West of the Tracks (2003), Fengming, a Chinese Memoir (2007), Coal Money (2008), Man with No Name (2009), The Ditch (2010), Three Sisters (2012), Till Madness Do Us Part (2013), Ta’a ng (2016), Mrs. Fang (2017), Beauty Lives in Freedom (2018) and Dead Souls (2018). We were fortunate to meet him when he came to the Bachelard Amphitheater at the Sorbonne for a Master Class on April 27, 2019 (at the invitation of Richard Conte and Jacinto Lageira, as part of a series of Interface meetings at the Panthéon-Sorbonne University, Paris I). In the final dialogue of this book Wang (whose films are off the beaten track in many ways) clarifies his connection to various issues raised\n\n24\n\nDominique Chateau and José Moure\n\nby post-cinema, in particular, the consequences of technological changes with regard to film creation and distribution, and evolution in the aesthetic conception of cinema.\n\nReferences and Further Reading Denson, Shane, and Julia Leyda, eds. 2016.

Paying tribute to Agnès Varda by analyzing Beaches of Agnès, her 2006 autobiographical film, José Moure draws attention to the fact that it has the singular form of a narrated puzzle from which (the f ilm itself intermingled with its “making of”) a new kind of documentary emerges. (Dominique Chateau, in chapter 14, completes the tribute by considering Varda’s forays into the world of contemporary art.) Through her most recent films, as well as her exhibitions, Agnès Varda can be considered a major figure in post-cinema. Keywords: Varda, installation, self-portrait\n\nIn 2006, twenty years after having painted the filmed portrait of Jane Birkin in Jane B. by Agnès V., and eight years after a few appearances in The Gleaners and I, as she approached her 80th birthday, Agnès Varda decided to devote herself to an autobiographical project, Beaches of Agnès. This project would be placed under the prestigious double patronage of Montaigne for the autobiographical essay and Rembrandt for the self-portrait. “It’s a strange idea,” she admits, to stage oneself and to film a self-portrait when you’re almost 80 years old. This idea began to form in my mind one day, on the Noirmoutier Beach, when I realized that other beaches had stood out in my life. The beaches\n\nChateau, D., and J. Moure.

I wanted to share with my family and a few other people some of the facts and projects from my life’s journey. And even more: to turn the mirrors towards others, towards those who had shaped me, whom I had met, whom I had loved.1\n\nBeaches – already very present in the multimedia exhibition L’île et elle (The Island and Her), which she presented at the Cartier Foundation in 2006 – constitute the main theme of this singular film by a visual filmmaker, co-produced by Ciné-Tamaris and Arte France cinema. Agnès Varda divides her work into five chapters which follow the order of the beaches that are linked to different periods in her life and places of memory and/or sources of inspiration for her creations (the Belgian beaches, the beach of Sète, the beaches of Los Angeles, a beach in Noirmoutier, and the imaginary beach represented by the rue Daguerre in Paris where she lives and works). She films herself in mid-invention, in the process of putting up installations on each of these beaches, using heterogeneous material (photos, paintings, extracts from her films, images of installations, reconstructions …), following the thread of sinuous memory with all its gaps, proceeding by means of collages, digressions, associations of ideas, analogies, mise en abyme … Agnès Varda stages herself, paints herself, tells her story in a narrated self-portrait in the form of a puzzle. Midway between sincerity and representation, as she plunges into the past, always from the present, she invents an original type of self-documentary where the film, a specular space for exhibitions and installations, is both the work itself (the self-portrait of Agnès Varda as a woman, filmmaker, and visual artist) and its “making of.” The pre-credit sequence that opens Beaches of Agnès illustrates, in an emblematic and very original way, the creative process that underlies Agnès Varda’s approach. This sequence, inserted as a prologue to the film and known as the mirrors sequence, ensures a programming function by means of its strategic position and singular status. It announces the rules of the game and the poetics of this attempt at self-representation that is film. Here, the filmmaker first presents her project with the help of young students from a film school in Louvain. She sets up a dozen mirrors of various sizes and styles on a windy North Sea beach. It is as if the significant events in her life that she is about to narrate are seen as several images reflected by mirrors scattered on a beach, as if, in this free play of fragmentation of shapes and reflections created by the mirror installation, something of the art of self-portraiture were at stake, somewhere between wind and tide, between sky and sand. 1\n\nVarda’s quotes come from Les plages d’Agnès (2008).\n\nThe Incipit of Beaches of Agnès (Les pl ages d’Agnès)\n\n29\n\nThe sequence lasts about three minutes. It consists of 25 shots framed by a shot of the logo of the production company, Ciné-Tamaris, which initiates the film, and the first shot of the credits, which interrupts the mirror installation sequence, firstly, by a written credit and, secondly, by “a few living, spoken credits to thank the team of young people who carried the mirrors.”\n\nHow Does One Talk about Oneself? Between Autobiography and Self-portrait After the production company’s logo, Ciné-Tamaris, the film opens with two introductory shots in 16:9 format, which were shot when the film was finished. The filmmaker felt the need to add an introductory scene in which she presented her autobiographical project. “I wrote this monologue in a few days while on vacation in Noirmoutier,” explains Agnès Varda, “and I asked Melvil Poupaud, a family friend, to handle the camera. He did a hand shot in two takes, and got up to do a crane effect. These two shots were taken on one of the Noirmoutier beaches.” Shot outside, in the evening, the foreground shows Agnès, accompanied by left-right camera movement, walking backwards on a deserted beach, and then heading toward the camera that lifts as she approaches. “I play the role of a plump and talkative little old lady, who tells her life story. Yet it is the others who really interest me; it’s them I like to film. It is the others who intrigue me, motivate me, challenge me, disconcert me, fascinate me,” says Agnès, coming forward while facing the camera. This first shot sets out the principles of the film to come: to inscribe the figure (Agnès) as a character in a logic of creating distance in the form of an assumed diegetic word (“I play the role of a plump and talkative little old lady”); to inscribe it in a maritime landscape (the beach) that structures the five chapters of the film; and, finally, to inscribe it in a double movement, both retro- and introspective. The retrospective movement is represented by the right-left travelling shot and the “character” walking backwards, thus getting ready to travel back in time, into her past and her memory; the introspective movement is represented by Agnès’s advance toward the camera. She looks at the spectator and addresses him/her directly, testing a specular practice of the self which is both “objectifying” (the image) and “subjectivating” (the voice). The second shot, which shows Agnès in a medium shot in front of the camera, extends the announcement of the autobiographical and artistic project: “This time, to talk about me,\n\n30\n\nJosé Moure\n\nI thought: if people were opened up, we would find landscapes.” But the voice is no longer diegetic; it seems to have detached itself from the figure presenting herself to the eye of the lens in all her fragility, turning her back on the infinite surface of the sea, while the soundtrack, accompanied by the sound of the waves, already seems to evoke an immersion into memories. Here, the aff irmation of self-representation (talking about oneself) involves placing the figure of the artist at the center of the image: not in the posture of the filmmaker (she is filmed by another person), but in that of the character or model. The subject poses as the object, while the subject of the enunciation poses as the subject of the utterance. Inscriptions in landscapes (beaches as a connection between sea and land) and in temporalized spaces create tension between autobiography and self-portrait. It is a question of both telling and representing oneself, of affirming in situ: “this represents me, this is me.” If autobiography (talking about oneself, talking about one’s life) belongs to the literary genre of retrospective narrative and is located on the side of narrativity, however disjointed, the self-portrait (recomposing or decomposing one’s face), inherited from painting, moves the introspective project toward the performative moment of creation, toward a more fragmentary form. This hesitation between autobiography and self-portrait, between talking about parts of her life and showing representations of herself, runs through the entire film. The questions that Agnès Varda tries to answer, already in this prologue, include: “How does one talk about oneself?” and “How do you represent yourself in a visual proposal?” Setting up the System An initial answer to these questions is provided by the third shot, which introduces the sequence known as the installation of mirrors on the beach. The direction of this sequence was entrusted to Didier Rouget, Agnès Varda’s first assistant since Jacquot de Nantes (1991), who directed the filming on the beach of Knokke-le-Zoute in August 2006, following which, Varda understood that it would be difficult for her to delegate her directing choices, and took control. The scene opens with a wide-angle shot in daylight, outside. On a deserted and windy North Sea beach, a small digital camera is placed on a tripod, the lens facing the sea. Agnès, in a red burgundy raincoat, at a slightly low angle, enters from the right of the frame and heads toward the camera, repeating the course she took in the two previous shots, but from behind, while continuing in an “off” voice the monologue she started on another\n\nThe Incipit of Beaches of Agnès (Les pl ages d’Agnès)\n\n31\n\nShot 3 of Beaches of Agnès (Agnès Varda, 2006)\n\nbeach, at another time of the day, in another outfit, in the two previous shots: “If I were opened up, they would find beaches.” The effect of the break between the first two shots and this third shot is marked not only by a change of place (the Belgian beach of Knokke-le-Zoute) and light (daylight, outside) as well as by the dissociation between sound and image (the “in” voice in the first shot is now “off”) but also by changing the image format from a 16:9 to a 4:3 ratio. This is the format that Agnès Varda adopts throughout the film to paint her filmic self-portrait. Thus, the system is revealed and set up: a beach, a camera and a character, Agnès, designated as a filmmaker. The self-documentary and its “making of” can now begin.\n\nThe Installation of Mirrors or the Plastic Adventures of a Self-portrait The continuation of the prologue (shots 4 to 25) proposes a strange ritual of placing mirrors on the beach. Using the principles of plastic installation to the benefit of cinematographic production, Varda, wrapped in a scarf that floats on the wind, imagines a sequence in which, with the help of young assistants, a collection of mirrors, the very instrument of the self-portrait,\n\n32\n\nJosé Moure\n\nare placed on the ground, mirror by mirror, reflecting not only herself but also the North Sea, the beach, the dunes, the sky, the bodies and faces of her assistants and the kite surfers who pass and disappear. This constellation of mirrors generates a myriad of reflections, glimmerings, split images, frames and trompe l’oeil; the filmmaker, herself, admits to not knowing what it means and associates it with “a reverie” or “something imaginary.” Through this highly visual and poetic ballet of mirrors dancing around Agnès as though they were trying to capture and retain her elusive and fragmented image in a puzzle, an entire poetics of the self-portrait according to Varda is sketched and reflected here. In the course of a non-chronological, slightly trembling succession of hand shots, the spectator witnesses a vertiginous deployment of frames and unpredictable mirror games that question representation and identity, and give rise to a fragmented world, in perpetual re-composition. A Matter of Frames: Between Cinema and Painting Agnès precedes two assistants carrying a wooden frame and shows them where to put it. The camera, carried shoulder-high, follows their progress on the sand as well as their hesitations (shot 4). By means of a shutter effect, two people carrying a huge inverted mirror suddenly mask the action, merging the two shots (shot 5). By once again revealing the setting, the characters and the wooden frame have been conjured away, as if by magic. Instead, we see a mirror on an easel and, at the foot of the easel, a partially, reflected female assistant. A right-left lateral camera movement accompanies the march of those carrying the mirror, followed by Varda, who supervises the setting up of the mirror by means of words and gestures. A reverse-angle shot (shot 6) shows the face of the mirror with Agnès’s reflection facing us from the center, and her back to the sea and sky. The spectator is totally “despatialized” by this image-within-an-image which suddenly depicts the front (in shot) and back (reverse angle) in the same frame en abyme. Appearing for the first time as a reflection, as in a cinemascope screen, Varda is shown to advantage by her placement in the center of the image, which gives it its power: she is master of both space and frame. In a wide-angle shot of the beach (shot 7), with an easel in close-up, in the right-hand part of the image, Agnès and a female assistant bring a mirror with golden molding and place it on the easel, the same one we already saw being set up in shot 5, thus showing the non-chronological nature of the sequence of shots during this sequence. At the same time, the mirror, associated with the easel, refers to the idea of the self-portrait in painting,\n\nThe Incipit of Beaches of Agnès (Les pl ages d’Agnès)\n\nShot 6 of Beaches of Agnès (Agnès Varda, 2006)\n\nShot 7 of Beaches of Agnès (Agnès Varda, 2006)\n\n33\n\n34\n\nJosé Moure\n\nShot 9 of Beaches of Agnès (Agnès Varda, 2006)\n\nand to the pictorial reference in which Agnès Varda inscribes her approach of self-representation. The moment the mirror is placed on the easel, Agnès, in a close-up shot (shot 8), motions her assistant off-camera and, with her head down, enters into a first, tense, face-to-face encounter with her own reflection. The installation of the frame on the easel continues in a wide-angle shot (shot 9) reflected in a slender mirror planted in the sand; the bottom part of the frame emphasizes the line as a reflection of the horizon. A third assistant has come to assist the two women. The installation once again has a “despacialization” effect on the spectator. The oscillations of the mirror placed on the unstable easel generate changing reflections and suggest the fragility of the images produced by the space-fragmenting device. In this mise en abyme, the mirror with golden molding, a frame-within-a-frame, becomes an animated painting projecting a “pictorial” image of sky and clouds, devoid of characters, standing out flatly in another, more cinematographic reflection. The largest of these mirrors evokes a cinemascope screen in which space widens and which is not only animated by the three protagonists’ desynchronized gestures inherited from burlesque cinema but also by a red kitesurfing kite. Here, painting and cinema seem to overlap in a game of doubling frames and specular images that interpenetrate one another while interpenetrating and cohabiting within Agnès Varda’s aesthetic project.\n\nThe Incipit of Beaches of Agnès (Les pl ages d’Agnès)\n\n35\n\nShot 10 of Beaches of Agnès (Agnès Varda, 2006)\n\nA medium close-up shot (shot 10) shows Agnès Varda from behind while, with the help of two assistants, a small mirror with moldings is placed on a framework of crisscrossed wooden logs planted in the sand. By means of this small mirror placed on a makeshift easel, the reference to the self-portrait continues. Incidentally, because of its inclination, the mirror only fleetingly captures bits of unidentified bodies followed by a corner of gray sky, as though Agnès’s face refuses to be captured in the reflection. A Certain Idea of the Portrait: Veiling/Revealing The following shot (shot 11) marks a return to the f irst wooden frame from the beginning (shot 4); this installation is, in a way, the common thread of the sequence. The assistants, who have reinforced the base by means of a wooden stake planted in the sand, remain doubtful as to the solidity of the setup. Agnès regains possession of the frame and uses all her authority – voice, intonation, gestures – to convince them: the north wind is their best support; “that’s the idea … it’s holding up, isn’t it? When the north wind is like this, it shouldn’t fall.” Left alone in the image, she is pushed around by a gust of wind, which makes her scarf take flight, transforming her into a chimeric creature with imprecise contours and in perpetual recomposition.\n\n36\n\nJosé Moure\n\nShot 12 of Beaches of Agnès (Agnès Varda, 2006)\n\nA reverse-angle shot (shot 12) connected to the scarf flying in the wind, shows Agnès in a half-set shot in the foreground, with objects (ladder, bed structure) in a heap at her feet. In the background the assistants are busy carrying new mirrors. The film thus reveals what goes on behind the scenes and becomes its own making-of. The wind shakes Varda’s scarf, masking and unmasking part of her face in turn. With her left hand, she adjusts the scarf to cover her face completely. Here we touch on the singular nature of the project: a documentary film that has another side to it, one that plays around with what is real and with its own staging, and assumes responsibility for both. In a joking tone, which is more than a declaration of intent, Agnès addresses the camera and the person filming her (Didier Rouget, her first assistant) and delivers her poetics of the portrait: “I think I do the thing with the scarf a little bit on purpose. But it’s funny, isn’t it? Because I have such high hopes that at some point it will do that, and that will be all that you’ll have filmed. You see, that’s my idea, my idea of the portrait; my idea of the portrait is to be in buggered mirrors and behind scarves.” In quick succession, the next two shots illustrate this idea of the portrait as a veil, as a mask. Firstly, Agnès’s reflection is almost erased in a spotted mirror (shot 13) and then in a mirror lying on the sand, like a puddle of water, her face is partly covered by a scarf (shot 14). Here, as in the entire sequence, the mirror is closely linked to the theme of water, as they share the same\n\nThe Incipit of Beaches of Agnès (Les pl ages d’Agnès)\n\n37\n\nShot 14 of Beaches of Agnès (Agnès Varda, 2006)\n\ncharacteristics: both reflect and shimmer. However, unlike Narcissus, when he faced his own reflection, here it is the sand mirror which reflects the veiled face. There is no choosing between the oval portrait being sketched here and that of Edgar Allan Poe. Thus, by masking the features of her face, the scarf reflects Varda’s desire to retain gray areas in her portrait, to erect a barrier between the public woman and the private person. “Even if we show everything, we don’t reveal much,” Jane Birkin already commented in Jane B. by Agnès V., quoted in Beaches of Agnès. Placed at the opening of the film, this scarf-covered face announces future reconstructions of works characterized by veiled faces, to which Varda refers, evoking her relationship with Jacques Demy, in particular, Magritte’s The Lovers. Childhood Memories or the Mirror as Proustian Madeleine While reflecting veiled, erased or fragmented faces, the mirrors, or at least their frame, help the filmmaker to bring out fragments of memories of her childhood in Belgium in the form of reminiscences. Varda has her back to the sea, staring at the wooden frame whose installation opened the sequence. In order to catch her words, the camera makes a translatory movement toward her, a movement of introspection and retrospection that\n\n38\n\nJosé Moure\n\nShot 17 of Beaches of Agnès (Agnès Varda, 2006)\n\nopens the story of childhood: “It reminds me of the furniture that was in my parents’ bedroom in Brussels” (shot 15). By means of a reverse-angle shot, the wooden frame reveals itself to be a memory-mirror in which a crouching Varda is reflected, as well as the cameraman filming her (shot 16). The cameraman becomes Minotaur, tracking Varda-Ariane in the tortuous labyrinth of her memory. For the filmmaker, the wooden molding becomes Proust’s Madeleine: it brings to life the memory of the furniture that once adorned the parental room: “The bed was a little like that and Mom’s wardrobe was like that …” The immersion into memory that becomes sonorous is achieved through the shot of a new frame (shot 17) erected on the sand. At its center is a reflection of the mirror with golden moldings placed on an easel, representing in a kind of animated painting a young man (an assistant) walking on the dune. The mise en abyme image combines three elements – sea, sky and earth – causing a new vertigo of perception in the viewer by means of a succession of frames-within-the-frame inside a false depth which, in the style of Magritte, seems to say, “This is not a painting.” The soundtrack gives life and substance to the filmmaker’s Proustian reminiscence with the sound of the squeaking wardrobe mixed with the sound of the waves: “but it’s not the sound, that squeaking sound of the wardrobe that I liked so much.” A wide-angle shot (shot 18) reveals Agnès Varda to the camera, in the background, drowning in the middle of an installation of screen mirrors,\n\nThe Incipit of Beaches of Agnès (Les pl ages d’Agnès)\n\n39\n\nShot 18 of Beaches of Agnès (Agnès Varda, 2006)\n\noriented differently and reflecting fragmented images. As in a kaleidoscope, three of them, in turn, reflect the refracted and fragmented image of two kite surfers pulling their sails on the beach that Varda is filming. The soundtrack, in off, evokes a ritual: Varda’s father listening to records on the family record player: “At home, there was a crank record player. On Sundays, Dad listened to Tino Rossi and Rina Ketty.” With the emergence of childhood memories, the shots show an ever greater fragmentation, orchestrated by the installation, whose setup has been shown by the sequence up to this point. A high-angle close-up shot (shot 19) reveals a mirror on an easel capturing the bottom part of the reflectors, a mirror and a kite’s canopy. Disparate and fragmented elements, a diagonally transformed skyline: everything contributes toward visual vertigo, while off-screen, Agnès’s voice continues to list the musical memories of her childhood: “And during the week, Mom sometimes listened to Schubert’s Unfinished Symphony.” Between a List of Memories and the Fragmentation of Self-images: The Unfinished Self-portrait While a wide-angle shot (shot 20) shows the installation of an imposing, standing mirror on the sand by three assistants, the first notes of the allegro\n\n40\n\nShot 20 of Beaches of Agnès (Agnès Varda, 2006)\n\nOpening credits of Beaches of Agnès (Agnès Varda, 2006)\n\nJosé Moure\n\nThe Incipit of Beaches of Agnès (Les pl ages d’Agnès)\n\n41\n\nmoderato of Schubert’s Unfinished Symphony can be heard and, in off, provide a melancholy accompaniment to the scene: “As a child, I never heard classical music, except for that piece, whose title I liked.” Facing the triptych-shaped mirror, Agnès unfolds the wings one by one, thus allowing a volley of images to cascade from this Pandora’s box. The images multiply her face, which is caught up in a perpetual Cubist recomposition of reflections that reveal the incompleteness of every portrait (shots 21, 22, 23, 24, 25). Here, fragmentation no longer has a playful dimension: in front of her image, Agnès seems to experience a feeling of strangeness and otherness. By intensifying the cinematographic effect of the scintillating mirror, the installation has led to fragmentation, which expresses Agnès’s vertigo of identity and the artist’s inability to connect the various aspects of her life in the form of a continuous and linear narrative, and to present her image as a composed and finished self-portrait.

Not only does he bring together several theorists who participate in the debate throughout the globalized world – Mulvey, Aumont, Bellour, Dubois, Gaudreault, Marion, Rodowick, Casetti – but Andrew also reignites this debate that could be considered a scholastic quarrel about a process whose outcome is still uncertain – the end of cinema! – if it were not a historical mutation, the practical consequences of which we experience every day. Some partners in the dialogue initiated by Andrew appear in this book with new questions. Keywords: End of cinema, history, aesthetics\n\nThe titles of a great many – too many – recent film books are alarming, literally alarming. It was something of a shock when, two summers ago, I opened a package I received in the mail to discover a book with a dark cover blaring the following words in large type: The End of Cinema? The marketing offices at publishing houses (larger I suspect than their editorial corps) urge authors in every field to deliver headlines like this for titles, a strategy that has helped books on, say, ecology or cosmology take off in sales (like The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History, or Death by Black Hole and 1 First release in Cultural Critique 95 (Winter 2017): 263-285.

I confess to having contributed my loud voice to this trend, when, egged on by my own press’s publicity manager, I let the haughty boast What Cinema Is! challenge anyone to find me wrong – only after purchasing the book, of course. Actually, that declarative title was how I had facetiously labeled the electronic folder where I provisionally lodged early drafts of chapters. So I was startled when told –indeed ordered – by the press’s publicist that I could not change it. After all, What Cinema Is! would appear in Wiley-Blackwell’s Manifesto series. I don’t know if the title boosted sales, but it raised the temperature of an already overheated discourse that has taken place less as a conversation than as a barrage of manifestos. This is to say that I include myself when I charge film studies with staging something like self-immolation on the public square. Susan Sontag lit the match with “The Decay of Cinema,” her poignant 1996 article in the New York Times Magazine. Morbidity has followed. In a section they call “Investigation of the R.I.P. Effect,” the authors of The End of Cinema?, André Gaudreault and Philippe Marion, do a credible job – relishing the task – of laying out the spectrum of apocalyptic themes and opinions by well-known scholars: Paulo Cherchi Usai, Jacques Aumont, D.N. Rodowick, Philippe Dubois, Tom Gunning, Raymond Bellour, James Lastra. I come up briefly in his account as one of those who have lost touch with the world that young people inhabit.2 Marginal to today’s adolescents, is cinema’s health worth fretting over? Let’s face it: most of us who fret are men whose careers in film studies date to 1970s and early 80s.3 The End of Cinema? is provocative and genuinely entertaining; it dances at Finnegan’s Wake, so to speak, spinning elaborate metaphors to lay out and adjudicate the many reactions to “a medium in crisis in the digital age” (its subtitle). Such a topic has inevitably led to brash rhetoric and sweeping categorization; in their survey Gaudreault and Marion deftly corral a bevy of spirited opinions into a three-ring arena, consisting of cine-nihilists, cine-diehards, and evolution-deniers. Well, I am not about to deny the existence of what they rather callously call “The R.I.P. Effect.” Ever since Sontag’s piece, cinema has been 2 André Gaudreault and Philippe Marion cite “Cut! That’s All, Folks,” from the Times (London), August 28, 2010, 2, where Will Self declares that his children and their friends have “no sense of film’s centrality; instead they are at the vortex of so much full-motion imagery on TVs, computer screens, game consoles, CCTV, 3G phones that the silver screen hovers only in their mid-distance” (Gaudreault and Marion 2015, 14). 3 Laura Mulvey is a key female scholar concerned with this issue, of course. But the stakes may indeed mainly concern a certain gender and generation. See, for example, Karen Beckman’s (2015) astute and contentious discussion of the premises of my manifesto.\n\nAnnouncing the End of the Film Er a\n\n47\n\nrepeatedly laid to rest, regretted, mourned, and eulogized. Sontag felt the loss of cinephilia acutely, and with it the community of those whose lives were somehow guided by the films they saw or the conversations those films elicited in other film lovers. Twenty years of later Gaudreault and Marion report the end of an outdated technology (mechanical and chemical) as well as a social institution, while I have spoken more about the decline of the intense study of films. Someone should calculate the percentage of publications in the discipline of cinema studies that fall into the genre of the obituary. I haven’t the heart to count, but it wouldn’t surprise me if cinema’s predicted demise had received more attention from professional films scholars than topics that used to concern us, such as early cinema, or literary adaptation, or the war film, or Orson Welles. Welles is pertinent here because in his case I did count, 2015 being his centenary. At that year’s conference of the Society for Cinema and Media Studies, just one of the 1,500 announced papers dealt with arguably America’s greatest filmmaker […] and that paper treated not his films but “The Invasion from Mars,” the media event of his radio play. So much for celebrating cinema, or even studying it!4 It looks as if, by “exploring the R.I.P. Effect,” we may also be burying our exploration of cinema’s achievements, its contribution to aesthetics and to culture. Has interpreting and historicizing films become quaint, replaced by media sociology (a discipline in which few film scholars have doctoral training)? Didn’t most of us enter this field because of films that called out for attention? We had the talent to identify fertile ones, to open them up and examine what they were made of and how they worked, as well as how they themselves opened onto broader issues of biography, industry economics, national culture, the other arts, the history of various media techniques and technologies, the status of stars, etc. The outpouring of ingenious and organized ways of treating films that irrigates our classes, our articles and our books, is trickling off. I go too far, for we’ve long known that “Le cinéma est d’ailleurs une industrie,” as Malraux wrote to conclude his 1940 “Esquisse d’une psychologie du cinéma.” Indeed, for over a century cinema has been a major media industry, as well as a powerful sociological force and index, like the communications or the airlines industries. All three of these industries, by the way, were born and matured in parallel, and all three are undergoing massive mutations in the twenty-first century. They do indeed call for economic and 4 To be fair, the flagship journal of the association published an important article on Welles last year: “Orson Welles, Author of Don Quixote” (Müller 2016).\n\n48\n\nDudley Andrew\n\nsociological analysis; and they attract straight scientific study too because of the technologies by which they function. Still, I contend that its “product” makes cinema a special kind of industry; for films are ontologically different from airplanes – that’s why the discipline that pays them attention rests in the humanities rather than in the business school or even in the social sciences. True, many are calling for the Last Rites to be administered to the humanities. Perhaps this accounts for our discipline’s turn from the interpretation of films and the history of cinema (quintessential humanities enterprises) to concerns and methods pursued elsewhere on campus. After all, universities, responding to pressures from their regents and from their anxious students and pragmatic parents, have been diverting attention and funding from the humanities to these more hardheaded schools. Whether applying for a death certificate or demanding a death warrant, one is obliged to name the subject of concern; and so Gaudreault and Marion have issued a writ of habeas corpus, as they interrogate the identity and whereabouts of a notoriously elusive character, cinema. Known to adopt disguises, cinema is thought by some to be a phantom or mere fabrication. Effective lawyers, they probe the claims of witnesses who boldly come forth to testify to the essential character of the medium. Jacques Aumont and Raymond Bellour are so succinct that Gaudreault and Marion have their statements read into the record: cinema “must provide that absolutely essential result of the canonical apparatus: the production of a way of looking over time” (Aumont, 84, qtd. in Gaudreault and Marion 2015, 154). And for Bellour: “Digital technology is not enough to kill cinema […] it does not touch its essence: the screening, the movie theater, the darkness, the silence, the viewers gathered together over a period of time” (Bellour, 19, qtd. in Gaudreault and Marion, 184). Other witnesses could provide additional testimony (my What Cinema Is! does so ostentatiously, citing Serge Daney concerning cinema’s capture of something of the Real, and Godard concerning public projection), but Gaudreault and Marion actually require no more than a single witness who claims to be acquainted with the essence of cinema, the being on trial, and Aumont serves them perfectly well. For next they turn to “relativists” who would dispute that cinema has anything essential about it. Christian Metz is called to testify (“Cinema is nothing more than the combination of messages which society […] calls films” [Metz, 26, qtd. in Gaudreault and Marion, 153]) before they call themselves to the stand to deliver the nominalist retort to the realism of the cine-essentialists. “Here, at a certain time and in a certain society and culture, is what was commonly understood to be cinema” (Gaudreault and Marion, 153; emphasis in original). Since times and society are changing so rapidly this century, cinema is not\n\nAnnouncing the End of the Film Er a\n\n49\n\nexactly dying; rather, as their title intimates, cinema is presumably coming to its “end,” losing its grasp on contemporary culture. With mere terms and categories at stake, nominalists are seldom melancholy. The Renaissance “masque,” as it was called, had a brilliant hundredyear heyday before losing cultural traction in the mid-seventeenth century after which it can be said to exist only in what are literally revivals; a broader view may see the masque as a precursor of the “baroque opera,” which itself might be subsumed under the more capacious category of “musical drama.” For nominalists, forms don’t die; instead, their functions atrophy or mutate over time until different names are needed to capture the more current functions these transformed phenomena help comprise. The authors call the sequence of semi-stable but related phenomena a “series.” In the series we are concerned with, that of audiovisual entertainments, one can always treasure and study the cinema that dominated most of the twentieth century, for it genuinely served a definable role in specifiable ways; but we should let go of its impertinent attempt to remain “cinema” in the digital age. A larger term is needed to convey the diversity of functions and forms that coexist as moving images in the digital era. Accordingly, these nominalists satisfyingly supply a clever neologism, “animage,” to fuse cinema’s tried-and-true realism with animation’s vigorous and technologically novel inventiveness. A triumphant conclusion to what first appeared to be an autopsy, this offering is meant to assuage Aumont, who lamented that “what is needed is a word – a single word that would say ‘the diverse social uses of the moving image” (Aumont, 59-60, qtd. in Gaudreault and Marion 2015, 187). Presto! We now have that word, “animage.” Time will tell if it takes hold. Although Gaudreault and Marion feel certain that history is already eroding the protective banks of cine-essentialism, they claim their own relativism to be moderate. For they don’t believe cinema to have died; rather it has been knocked “off its pedestal,” demoted from the center of the growing “patchwork” that makes up the cultural series of moving images (107, 149). If we once floated on a stream of films, we have now been ushered into the rapids of a river of digital moving images. Thus they grant cinema at least a “provisional” existence, even if it is waning, while “complete relativists” like Francesco Casetti “[do] not hesitate to make the claim that cinema never existed” (qtd. in Gaudreault and Marion, 154). Is Casetti just mimicking André Bazin, who famously pronounced that “the cinema has not yet been invented”?5 Gaudreault and Marion are far more careful in their discussion 5 Gaudreault and Marion 2015, 155. At the end of their book (184-186) these authors subject Bazin’s famous sentence to intense philological scrutiny, finding that in republishing his 1946\n\n50\n\nDudley Andrew\n\nof Bazin’s single paragraph than of Casetti’s elaborate position, which they seem to know only through a couple of his articles leading up to The Lumière Galaxy. Think of the debate these authors might have had out both books just weeks apart (Casetti’s on March 3, 2015, Gaudreault and Marion’s on April 14, 2015). Their proof pages could have crossed in the mailroom. Did both books have the same copyeditor, and what opinion might she have of their stances, if not their prose? By happenstance, Gaudreault and Marion hit on one metaphor that leads right into Casetti’s main position, while resonating with his title. In the course of refuting Bellour’s insistence that cinema not be conflated with myriad types of moving images that proliferate at an accelerating rate, they write: “If cinema has become a supernova (that is, all the phenomena resulting from the explosion of a star), it is because it is already dead, despite the extreme yet fleeting light it is giving off” (19-20). They let Wikipedia expediently make their point: “Seen from the earth, a supernova thus often appears to be a new star when in fact it represents the disappearance of a star.”6 Casetti discovers more in The Lumière Galaxy than dying supernovas – far more, especially since he tunes his instruments to look not for heavenly bodies in the universe but for the energy that makes them up and that circulates among them, what he calls “experience.” Certainly our cinematic experiences under the great projector of the movie theater remain prime and indelible. They are treasured and perhaps overvalued by Bellour, by me, and by many others. Yet something of that experience emanates even in the desacralized light of Vimeo and other miniaturized sources. No unified field theory can account for the movement of this cinematic energy nor for the diversity of the objects floating in the vast universe, especially when that universe will seem (and become) bigger and bigger as the century plunges like a spaceship further into the future, and at higher speed. And so to register the “red-shift effect,” Casetti turns to the instruments identified in his subtitle: “Seven Key Words for the Cinema to Come.” Refusing to establish cinema’s (evolving) identity in its apparatus (camera), its location (theater), or its product (movie), but rather in the particular character of our cinematic experience, he organizes the book in tabular “Myth of Total Cinema,” within his collection What Is Cinema? he became “more intransigent and thus more idealistic” about his doubt that cinema could ever become what the name makes us believe it to be, the reproduction of reality in all its aspects, including motion. 6 Gaudreault and Marion 2015, 19-20; their citation points to the French version of Wikipedia, from which I have translated this text.\n\nAnnouncing the End of the Film Er a\n\n51\n\nfashion rather than linear argument. This fits a phenomenon that is at once dispersed (incessant expansion and transformation) and multidimensional. This phenomenon, the cinematic experience, he takes to be governed by seven “processes,” each distinct enough to command its own chapter, headed by a key word: Relocation, Relics/Icon, Assemblage, Expansion, Hypertopia, Display, Performance. Unlike Raymond Williams’s (1976) 155 “Keywords” that comprise an alphabetically organized “vocabulary” of sedimented cultural concepts, Casetti’s “Key Words” (written as two words) are library aids that open up immense, yet distinct, bibliographies of issues and concerns. Familiar with the general contours of “what’s out there,” Casetti doesn’t justify what makes these words “key,” or what keeps their number to seven, or what orders them. This freedom allows him to search the media galaxy as if it were an electronic catalogue he can access at will, moving at hyperspeed from region to region, without one key word requiring him to move necessarily to the next. Undoubtedly one word is trump: “relocation.” In 2008 and again in 2012, Casetti effectively announced the project of his book in acclaimed essays introducing this key word (2012). Adapting it to lead off The Lumière Galaxy, he establishes the stakes and method. After that he and the reader can play hopscotch through the book, until reaching chapter 8, where all ideas converge in “The Persistence of Cinema in a Post-Cinematic Age.” The striking conclusion (there must be both death and transfiguration) once again draws in the “Relocation” article, giving this book more argumentative coherence than its form portends. A master of simplification, Casetti opens each chapter by evoking a film that sounds the key for the particular key word under scrutiny. While less essential than his use of the same strategy in The Eye of the Century (2013), these dips into the pool of movies are refreshing. While they point enticingly toward the many others that could be adduced, Casetti, like most scholars concerned with the fate of the medium, has no reason to examine, interpret, or explore any particular text. His subject is the galaxy, if not the universe, of cinema, probed from Earth by registering redshifts and dark matter. At the end of the introduction, many of his wonderful title’s implications unfold. Updating Marshall McLuhan’s Guttenburg Galaxy ([1962] 2011) with our era’s own revolutionary technology, Casetti attributes the existence of digital media not to some computer whiz but to the inventors of the Cinématographe, Auguste and Louis Lumière. Whereas the printing press created a hot culture of books that television cooled off, cinema, if Casetti’s title holds, was so hot that it exploded like a massive star extruding its magma into an array of smaller heavenly bodies, all of them twinkling with slightly different qualities of intensity and color, and in some cases\n\n52\n\nDudley Andrew\n\nforming constellations. While the sun (cinema) may still appear the brightest and densest star in our sky, cinema no longer commands worship and no longer stands as the absolute center of our entertainment universe, for the sky is full of celestial screens of many sizes. And if films still captivate our conversations, it is because they twinkle on many kinds of screens, doing so intermittently, it must be said, and often sharing time and space with other “applications.” Invited to open the book wherever we want, let’s follow the metaphor we’ve been chasing and go straight to chapter 4, the one named “Expansion.” This strong key word characterizes cinema as one of the mightiest capitalist enterprises of the twentieth century, France’s second leading industry in the immediate postwar years, for instance.7 Now expansion should be measured not just in the number of films produced year upon year but in the innumerable enterprises that cinema draws on or has ushered into existence. Without even running down the litany of the role listed in the endless tail credits of any film made today, these include inventors and engineers, specialized optical and chemical companies, intermittent-motion machinery, agents and lawyers for patents and contracts, theater designers and management, distribution networks, reviewers and gossip columnists, specialized magazine and book publishers, and fan-clubs and ciné-clubs; and don’t forget the popcorn concession, evidently a crucial subindustry. Among all these functions and developments, let’s focus on technological expansion, because this conceivably compromises the identity of the medium. Can something expand beyond recognition yet remain itself? A single sonnet – let’s say Shakespeare’s number 14, his “astronomy sonnet”8 – can grow into a cycle of related sonnets or become part of a book of sonnets; but it can’t add or subtract lines without becoming another sort of poem. A carriage, to take an example from the industrial domain, might have first been powered by people (slaves), then by mules or dogs, oxen and horses; it was nevertheless always a carriage until a new species altogether came along, the “horseless carriage.” This expansion is normally thought to have initiated a new series labeled “motor vehicles.” With Gaudreault and Marion in mind, we must ask if the advent of the digital merely adds another variant (like sound in 1928, color in the 1930s, widescreen and 3D in the 1950s) to a 7 Expansion can also be measured by use of natural resources. Film and television account for an astounding demand of electricity in Los Angeles, and are second to the oil industry as that city’s source of pollution. See Bozak 2012, 4-5. 8 Anna Shechtman directed me to this particularly pertinent sonnet when I had chosen another at random. She deserves my thanks as well for her careful reading of this text, as does Xiao Jiwei.\n\nAnnouncing the End of the Film Er a\n\n53\n\nrecognizable phenomenon, motion pictures, or has the digital inaugurated a new series altogether, something called “new media”? For different reasons cinema’s identity was at stake again around 1970 when Gene Youngblood wrote Expanded Cinema, a book that both Casetti and Aumont deploy for their own intentions. Casetti approves of the book and its title; he streamlines its trajectory into four “tendencies.” The first shows how a few gifted experimental artists from the 1950s onward began to exercise all of the medium’s registers so as to stretch what the movies had settled for, producing full-body films exuding synesthesia. The second tendency goes in the other direction, toward the ubiquitous use of films (and newly available video portapaks) in everyday situations, permitting everyone to be a film-maker. Then there is the expanded role of the audience in theater situations that include discussions and other forms of feedback. Cinema’s most pertinent growth, the fourth tendency, has been to merge with other media, particularly theatrical ones, in museum settings or elsewhere, with videotape contributing to experiences that go “beyond” cinema and television. Youngblood already understood in 1970 that the computer could erase divisions; he predicted videographic cinema, cybernetic cinema, and computer films. All these modalities are still “trending,” to use a current term; and all of them, Casetti believes, “allow cinema to stay on its path while expanding the field of possibilities and increasing the number of additional routes” (2015, 110). But in joining other media in a world of screened, kinetic phenomena, cinema risks losing touch with the experience that made it what we believe it to be when we talk about it. His book goes on to remind us how we still have cinema with us, and in abundance, even if in a different manner than held sway from 1915 to 1985. A couple years before Casetti, Jacques Aumont brought Youngblood’s book to bear on today’s situation. In his pithy hundred-page pamphlet called Que reste-t-il du cinéma? (2012) he lays out opposing viewpoints straightaway. On one side stands D.N. Rodowick, who flatly denies Russian Ark the status of cinema, since it is not a “filmed” record of a situation unfolding in time but a complex string of numerical codes, most but not all of which are fluctuating transformations that a device makes within an audiovisual situation. “The digital event corresponds less to the duration and movements of the world than to the control and variation of discrete numerical elements internal to the computer’s memory and logical processes” (2007, 166). There are no “shots” in digital cinema, only “takes” that are immediately manipulable because transformed instantly into codes that invite intervention (filtering or adding light and color, if not objects) until the desired look is composited. Despite the famous 96-minute athletic fete that made Russian Ark famous,\n\n54\n\nDudley Andrew\n\nno original shot remains, no photograms of the sort that are specific to cinema and ground it in the moment “the shot.” Technically Russian Ark records nothing except countless micro digital events, distinct computations that express in pixels the look of the Hermitage Museum (2007, 166-167). More accurately, they express the desired look of the museum once the indefinitely variable code has been worked through in postproduction. Digital events are not equivalent to the reliability of a photographic substrate; they are changeable, ever on the verge of evanescence, and needing to be constantly refreshed. Hence at base Russian Ark might be called computer animation, a stunning example of a significant artistic and social practice, but one that is distinct from cinema. Aumont will not go this far, since watching Russian Ark in a theater is, for him, a cinematic experience no matter how its images were generated (2012, 16-18). But neither will he countenance the extreme view on the other side, expressed dramatically by his friend and colleague Philippe Dubois. Dubois openly hails the new era of cinema that is now ouvert et multiple, cinéma “expanded,” sorti de ses formes et de ses cadres. Du cinéma hors la salle, hors les murs, hors “le” dispositif. Finis le noir, les sièges, le silence, la durée imposée […]. La pellicule n’est plus le critère, ni la salle, ni l’écran unique, ni la projection, ni même les spectateurs. Oui, c’est du cinéma. Du cinéma aux mille lieux. Du cinéma hors “la Loi.” Sauvage, déréglé, proliférant bien plus que disparaissant. (Dubois, 7, qtd. in Aumont 2012, 19)\n\nAumont finds this risible. “Bigre!” he blurts out, meaning “idiocy.” Growth and mutation are to be expected in cinema as in any cultural phenomenon, including evolutionary leaps like sound, color, widescreen, and home viewing, but Dubois, like Youngblood before him, instead of “expanding” the definition of cinema, has “exploded” it, until the noun no longer “defines” anything. “Définir en extension, c’est ne pas définir,” where “define,” carrying something of its application in geometry, means “to determine or f ix the boundaries or extent of,” to “make clear the outline or form of” (Aumont 2012, 25).9 Aumont regrets the “wishful thinking” of those who celebrate cinema everywhere (on LED advertising screens, for example, or in surveillance cameras) and therefore nowhere. Just because these phenomena involve images that move, they needn’t be called “cinema.” 9 Aumont 2012, 25. The geometrical application is evident in the fourth and fifth definitions of the word “define” given in the Random House Unabridged Dictionary.\n\nAnnouncing the End of the Film Er a\n\n55\n\nExasperated, he turns where I have turned, to the more temperate Casetti, whose views had already been previewed in articles. But when, two years after Aumont’s book, The Lumière Galaxy appeared, the expanding universe of cinema had undergone in Casetti’s view something far more than relocation. “A cosmic deflagration has taken place, and that star (the brilliant and immediately recognizable star shining over our heads) has exploded into a thousand suns which in turn have attracted new celestial material and formed new systems” (16). Casetti introduces these new celestial systems and material only after insisting that we block out local light pollution so that we can look more deeply into the heavens. His purifying filter is a postulate that Aumont insists on as well: “From the moment of its birth cinema has been considered a particular form of experience” (21), and “relocation emphasizes the role of experience” (29). This is why the ontology of the digital image behind Rodowick’s genetic argument does not trouble the phenomenology behind Aumont’s experience of Russian Ark. And Rodowick has recognized this: “I still hold that the experience of the imaginary signifier is something of a psychological constant in theatrical film viewing […]. What has persisted is a certain mode of psychological investment—a modality of desire” (22). I suspect that Aumont would find this formulation dualistic: on the one side, a “psychological constant” limited to a particular mode of viewing (the engulfing one characterized best Metz), and on the other, an ontology of the digital that surpasses what we thought we had understood about the nature of film. Aumont and Casetti make room for other modes of experience than that of the engulfing fiction film, and neither is so concerned about the material substrate of that experience. Rodowick shows himself to be a philosopher more than a theorist of film; and this is just how he characterizes Paulo Cherchi Usai, whose stunning realization that film is an unstable, almost quicksilver object, was published under an unforgettable title: The Death of Cinema: History, Cultural Memory and the Digital Dark Age (2001). This book seems to have sparked Rodowick’s reflections and stirred us all; for it argues that if a film is said to exist only when a projector animates still frames, then that film further decays each time it is born again, as the machinery wears away the celluloid. Paradoxically, some studios are now protecting their best 35mm prints, refusing to project them, burying them in deep storage as insurance against the likely dissolution of their video avatars. In Usai’s vocabulary (actually Plato’s) these prints have become “models” or “ideal images,” which digital versions aim to replicate and that may need to be unspooled if the digital world really does go dark sometime in the future. Film as mummy.\n\n56\n\nDudley Andrew\n\nSo, Rodowick’s philosophical view finds an unbridgeable ontological break between film and the digital media; he awaits theorists of the latter to account for digital media that are so genuinely new that film theorists need not apply, although the concepts they have accumulated will be crucial as digital forms develop (183-184). Now Aumont and Casetti are f ilm theorists and historians to the core; they bank on a continuity of the cinematic experience no matter what its substrate. The dispute they have with each other concerns the “extent” of any “extension” beyond the normal experience. In a lapidary three-page article entitled “Cinéma étendu, cinéma détendu, cinéma prétendu” (2015), Aumont concludes that the only authentic extension of cinema is that which happens within the viewer as we extend ourselves when a film proposes new rhythms, sensations, perceptions, and ideas. Such extension in depth, with its corresponding reach into the world the film points toward, characterizes my view in What Cinema Is! Although neither Casetti nor Aumont mention it, Youngblood had acknowledged this dimension of expansion (41). But his book remains famous for baptizing a movement by filmmakers and audiences aiming to break free of the traditional frame, allowing images to hemorrhage from the screen out into the audience, or beyond the theater, perhaps reaching a sea of related phenomena and experiences where the particular intensity of cinema may dissolve. Aware of the danger of dissolution, Casetti returns to the traditional experience again and again. For instance, up until the introduction of the remote zapper, a film’s time regulated that of the viewer. Now we can take charge of th"
