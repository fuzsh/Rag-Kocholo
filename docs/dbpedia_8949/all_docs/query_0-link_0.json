        "text": "Oregon-based New Zealand psychedelic rock band\n\nUnknown Mortal Orchestra (also known as UMO) is a psychedelic rock band based in Portland, Oregon and primarily composed of singer, guitarist, and songwriter Ruban Nielson and bassist Jacob Portrait. Nielson started the band in 2009, initially as a solo project. The band's first album was released in 2011 on Fat Possum Records.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nInception\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter some success in his native New Zealand with the band The Mint Chicks, Ruban Nielson moved to Portland in 2007. The singer and guitarist released the track \"Ffunny Ffriends\" on his anonymous Bandcamp profile on 17 May 2010.[1] No further information was provided and no mention of who created it. Within a day, the song had received significant coverage from independent music blogs such as Pitchfork.[2][3] Through their reposting and attempts to hunt down the creator,[4] Nielson eventually claimed the track as Unknown Mortal Orchestra's.[5]\n\nUnknown Mortal Orchestra\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Unknown Mortal Orchestra (album)\n\nThe band's debut self-titled album was released 21 June 2011 on Fat Possum Records. The album received critical acclaim. Nielson promoted a 'Kiwi Edition' of the album on his Instagram, which includes a bonus track. Pitchfork gave the album an 8.1, describing that with \"an expert use of space rare for such a lo-fi record, UMO manages a unique immersive and psychedelic quality without relying on the usual array of bong-ripping effects.\"[6]\n\nIn the spring of 2012, the band won the Taite Music Prize for the album.[7] Although the nominated Unknown Mortal Orchestra did not win Best Alternative Album, Nielson took home the title of Best Male Artist at the 47th annual Vodafone New Zealand Music Awards.\n\nII\n\n[edit]\n\nIn September 2012, Unknown Mortal Orchestra announced that they had signed to Jagjaguwar and were working on their second full-length album. Unknown Mortal Orchestra's second album, II, was released on 5 February 2013.[8] The first single from the album, entitled \"Swim and Sleep (Like a Shark)\", was first available as a 7\" on their tour with Grizzly Bear.\n\nII has received critical acclaim. In November 2013 it won Best Alternative Album at the New Zealand Music Awards. II was nominated for the Taite Music Prize 2014, an annual music prize awarded for the best album from New Zealand. Clash Music gave the album a 9 out of 10, saying \"from opener 'From The Sun', which recalls George Harrison-psychedelia, to the tender Family Stone shuffle of the closing of 'Secret Xtians', 'II' displays both a glowing warmth in its production and a deft use of space that illuminate Nielson's superbly crafted compositions.\"[9] Paste magazine called the album \"a modern, beat-heavy take on '60s psych, with plenty of hooks and fuzz to get you hooked and feeling fuzzy.\"[10] NME praised Ruban's ability to turn his songs into \"works of warm, fuzzy beauty.\"[11]\n\nIn late 2012, Unknown Mortal Orchestra capitalized on the success of II and embarked on a world tour.[12] The tour started off with shows in Australia, and hometown shows in New Zealand, followed by several stops in Europe. The band toured extensively throughout North America with opener Foxygen. In March 2013, Unknown Mortal Orchestra was named one of Fuse TV's 30 must-see artists at SXSW.[13] Unknown Mortal Orchestra consistently sold out shows in both Europe and in North America, and as a result of their success on the road they announced in early April that they would extend their tour through the end of 2013. That summer the band performed at a number of major European festivals, including Roskilde Festival, Pukkelpop and Lowlands.[citation needed]\n\nOn 25 February 2013, Unknown Mortal Orchestra made their American television debut, performing \"So Good At Being in Trouble\" on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.[10]\n\nOn 29 October 2013, the band released an EP titled Blue Record.[14] It included three acoustic versions of songs taken from their previous album.\n\nMulti-Love\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Multi-Love\n\nOn 5 February 2015, the band announced their third studio album, Multi-Love. They released the title track as the first single, which was designated \"Best New Track\" by Pitchfork.[15] Multi-Love was released on 26 May 2015. It was well received by critics. Rolling Stone commented that \"Multi-Love sees Nielson coloring outside the lines for a vibrant vision of connection\" [16] and Pitchfork praised Nielson's ear for how something should sound and referred to the album as his \"most accomplished.\"[17] Singles \"Multi-Love\" and \"Can't Keep Checking My Phone\" were both A-listed at BBC's 6 Music.[18]\n\nFollowing the release, UMO embarked on a tour through Europe, the US and Canada, with many sold out dates. On 12 August, UMO performed \"Multi-Love\" on Late Night with Seth Meyers.[19] On 25 August they performed \"Can't Keep Checking My Phone\" on Conan. On 16 February 2016 the band performed on Last Call with Carson Daly. \"Can't Keep Checking My Phone\" also appears in the association football video game FIFA 16.[20]\n\nSex & Food and IC-01 Hanoi\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: Sex & Food and IC-01 Hanoi\n\nThe band's fourth studio album, Sex & Food, was released on 6 April 2018, garnering a lot of praise from critics.\n\nIn a review in Reflektor Magazine, the following was said: \"The consistent thread through the UMO catalog remains strong; frontman Ruban Nielson spins a soulful vocal over a backdrop of melodically rich music and slick rhythm. This album builds on many of the synthesizers and sampled drum textures introduced on the previous breakout LP Multi-Love in 2015, but offers a different ride. The entire album was covertly previewed in SB-05, the 2017 installment of a Christmas day instrumental/ambient track released digitally for free. Upon first listen, Sex & Food reveals each song in its full form, a pleasant surprise.\"[21] In July, the BBC Radio & 6Music named Sex & Food one of the best albums released in 2018.\n\nFollowing the release, the band set out on a global tour with stops in North America, Europe, UK, Asia, New Zealand and Australia, with many sold out dates. In September 2018, they announced the release of an instrumental album that originated from the sessions for Sex & Food, titled IC-01 Hanoi. It was released on 26 October 2018.[22]\n\nV\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 25 June 2021, the band released \"Weekend Run\", its first proper single since 2018's Sex & Food. The song was released via the band's long time label Jagjaguwar. Of the new song, Ruban Nielson said \"At the end of the day I don't take for granted that I have the perfect job -- I truly work to make music that will set someone's day right and I think that shines through on 'Weekend Run.'\" Later on 4 August, they released a second single \"That Life\".\n\nOn 25 October 2022, the band announced a 2023 US/UK tour in support of a forthcoming double album and released the single \"I Killed Captain Cook\".[23] On 2 February 2023, the band announced the double album V, which was released on 17 March 2023 via Jagjaguwar, and released the single \"Layla\".[24] On 21 February, “Nadja”, the fifth single from V was released.\n\nMembers\n\n[edit]\n\nCurrent\n\nRuban Nielson – lead vocals, guitar, drums, bass, piano, keyboards, synthesizers (2009–present)\n\nJacob Portrait – bass, synthesizers, backing vocals (2010–present)\n\nKody Nielson – drums, percussion, synthesizers, backing vocals (2013–present)\n\nCurrent touring musicians\n\nChristian Li – keyboards, backing vocals (2022–present)\n\nFormer\n\nJulien Ehrlich – drums (2010–2012)\n\nGregory Rogove – drums, backing vocals (2012–2013)\n\nRiley Geare – drums, backing vocals (2013–2017)\n\nAmber Baker – drums (2017–2018)\n\nThomas \"Mabus\" Hoganson – keyboards, synthesizers, backing vocals (2018)\n\nFormer touring musicians\n\nQuincy McCrary – keyboards, synthesizers, backing vocals (2015–2018; 2019)\n\nChris Nielson – keyboards, synthesizers, saxophone, backing vocals (2018–2019)\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nStudio albums\n\n[edit]\n\nList of studio albums with selected chart positions and certifications Title Album details Peak chart positions NZ\n\n[25] AUS\n\n[26] BEL (Fla.)\n\n[27] BEL (Wa.)\n\n[28] NLD\n\n[29] SCO\n\n[30] UK\n\n[31] UK\n\nIndie\n\n[31] US\n\n[32] US\n\nIndie\n\n[32] Unknown Mortal Orchestra\n\nReleased: 21 June 2011\n\nLabel: Fat Possum\n\nFormat: CD, LP, cassette, digital download\n\n35 — — — — — — — —[A] — II\n\nReleased: 5 February 2013\n\nLabel: Jagjaguwar\n\nFormat: CD, LP, cassette, digital download\n\n38 —[B] 120 — 96 — 122 17 170 26 Multi-Love\n\nReleased: 26 May 2015\n\nLabel: Jagjaguwar\n\nFormat: CD, LP, cassette, digital download\n\n14 45 70 158 37 57 44 5 98 7 Sex & Food\n\nReleased: 6 April 2018\n\nLabel: Jagjaguwar\n\nFormat: CD, LP, cassette, digital download\n\n9 76 63 — 98 50 56 10 188 12 V\n\nReleased: 17 March 2023\n\nLabel: Jagjaguwar\n\nFormat: 2×LP, CD, cassette, digital download\n\n7 97 — — — 32 —[C] 8 —[D] — \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart or were not released in that territory.\n\nInstrumental albums\n\n[edit]\n\nList of instrumental albums, with details Title Details IC-01 Hanoi\n\nReleased: 26 October 2018\n\nLabel: Jagjaguwar\n\nFormat: CD, LP, cassette, digital download\n\nExtended plays\n\n[edit]\n\nSB-01 (2013)[36]\n\nBlue Record (2013)\n\nSB-02 (2014)[37]\n\nSB-03 (2015)[38]\n\nSB-04 (2016)[39]\n\nSB-05 (2017)[40]\n\nSB-06 (2019)[41]\n\nSB-07 (2019)[42]\n\nSB-08 (2020)[43]\n\nSB-09 (2021)[44]\n\nSB-10 (2022)[45]\n\nSingles\n\n[edit]\n\nList of singles, with selected chart positions, showing year released and album name Title Year Peak chart positions Certifications Album NZ\n\nHot\n\n[46] NZ\n\nArtist\n\nHeat.\n\n[47] BEL\n\n(Fla.)\n\nTip\n\n[27] MEX\n\nAir.\n\n[48] UK\n\nSales\n\n[31] \"Ffunny Ffrends\" 2010 — — — 31 — Unknown Mortal Orchestra \"Thought Ballune\" — — — 49 — \"How Can You Luv Me\" 2011 — — — — — \"I'll Come Back 4 U\" 2012 — — — — — Adult Swim Singles Program 2012 \"So Good at Being in Trouble\" 2013 — — — — —\n\nRIAA: Gold[49]\n\nII \"Swim and Sleep (Like a Shark)\" — — — 48 — \"From the Sun\" — — — — — \"Multi-Love\" 2015 — — 25 44 — Multi-Love \"Can't Keep Checking My Phone\" — — 84 — 36 \"First World Problem\" 2016 — — — 44 — Non-album single \"Shakedown Street\" — — — — — Day of the Dead \"American Guilt\" 2018 — 1 — 34 — Sex & Food \"Not in Love We're Just High\"[50] — 5 — — — \"Hunnybee\" — — — 36 — \"Hanoi 6\" — — — — — IC-01 Hanoi \"Weekend Run\" 2021 34 4 — — — V \"That Life\" — 11 — — — \"I Killed Captain Cook\" 2022 — 13 — — — \"Layla\" 2023 — 10 — — — \"Nadja\" — 13 — — — \"Meshuggah\" 28 2 — — — \"—\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory.\n\nOther charted songs\n\n[edit]\n\nList of songs, with selected chart positions, showing year released and album name Title Year Peak chart\n\npositions Album NZ\n\nArtist\n\nHeat.\n\n[47] \"Everyone Acts Crazy Nowadays\" 2018 4 Sex & Food \"A God Called Hubris\" 1 \"Ministry of Alienation\" 2\n\nAs featured artist\n\n[edit]\n\nList of singles as featured artist showing year released and album name Title Year Album \"Satanic Planet\"\n\nDaniel Johnston feat.
