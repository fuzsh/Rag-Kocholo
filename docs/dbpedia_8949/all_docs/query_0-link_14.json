        "text": "RTX are splitting into Black Bananas!!! The fruit is ripe and the bread will be FRESH.\n\nAfter three albums under the name RTX, Jennifer Herrema and her bunch decided to flip the script, to kick open the doors of perception a little bit. See, RTX was not Royal Trux, not a metal band, not a 70’s bar band and not a toxic substance; RTX was something, all of those things and none of them and way more, including Black Bananas bubbling in a witchy cauldron of their own herbaceousbrew. The tit le of a song on their RaTX album detailed a bit of the recipe, taking elements often tossed aside or thrown all the way out and combining them into something new and worthwhile…a new strain of the almighty green — to feed and elevate the hungry ones.\n\n“I’m your garbage collector\n\nI’ll turn your trash to gold\n\nWhat you cast off is what I hold,\n\nEnd loafs of bread, black bananas and broken crackers\n\nScratched records, too dark pictures and torn jeans\n\nAll the shit that rips at the seams”\n\nBlack Bananas is set for the next all-inclusive rock and roll crusade, the one that includes even and especially all the shit you don’t like, woven into all the shit you can’t live without. This has been the name of Jennifer’s game from day one; she owns the blueprints and if you don’t know by now, don’t even bother to Google it, cuz understanding is an investment not an action. Jennifer Herrema is not schizophrenic nor does she don many hats. She is simply a singer and simultaneously, a pioneer of comprehensive non-exclusive opposition rock, and Black Bananas is the latest addition to the oeuvre.\n\nBrian Mckinley, Kurt Midness, Jaimo Welch , and Nadav Eisenman have been ripping and running with Jennifer since 2002, when one by one, they gathered serendipitously, borne by curiosity and the courage to be part of something new. Each passing RTX record saw them wrapped ever tighter in the burgeoning tongue of their own creation. Now, uttering their twisted slang fluently as a unified dialect, they emerge as Black Bananas.\n\nIf you wanna hedge (-fund) your bets its best to get out in front of this new natio nal currency they are creating with Black Bananas. These are the notes of the future; with Jennifer at the helm their worth will grow exponentially. Invest!\n\nBlack Bananas first album Rad Times Xpress IV runs the gamut from gnarly odes to reality TV in songs like “My House” to future electric metallic GoGo sounds all conceived with scraps of influence from Jennifer’s childhood passions zig-zagged with other currents out there, creating a sound that will take you to a specific place that only Black Bananas know how to find.\n\nMost of all, Black Bananas is the new band in town — and they’re fucking righteous.\n\nMusic critics and fans agree, Redd Kross is back and delivering their signature brand of genuine rock ‘n roll with a vengeance.\n\n“A purer explication of rock and roll’s essence would’ve required Jimi Hendrix and Keith Moon playing Chuck Berry songs while James Brown’s sweat poured from the sky.” —SF Weekly\n\nFounded 34 years ago in Los Angeles during the first wave of LA punk rock by brothers Jeff and Steven McDonald (then respectively 15 and 11 years old), Redd Kross cut their teeth opening for Black Flag at a middle school graduation party. Their debut recordings caught the attention of Rodney Bingenheimer, who quickly became a fan as he spun their Ramones inspired songs like “Annette’s Got The Hits” and “I Hate My School” on the world famous KROQ.\n\nTheir following releases maintained roots still firmly planted in punk, but the band started to experiment with different musical elements and band members. Redd Kross boldly broke new ground by intuitively and inventively mixing their eclectic inspirations in song and performance. They understand and embrace the esoteric commonalities between the Partridge Family and the Manson Family; the Beatles and Black Sabbath; The Osmonds and the New York Dolls. The result was a band that was ahead of their time – daringly original, artistic and uncontrived. “Teen Babes from Monsanto”, “Born Innocent” and “Neurotica” became precursors to the Seattle bands of the 90’s, as well as becoming an inspiration to many indie and alternative rock bands world wide.\n\n“Neurotica was a life changer for me and for a lot of people in the Seattle music community.” —Jonathan Poneman, cofounder of Sub Pop\n\n“(Redd Kross) are definitely one of the most important bands in America.” —Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore\n\nIn 1990 the band released their major label debut, “Third Eye”. Taking their obsession with late 60’s bubblegum am radio to a new level, the song writing matured with more complex arrangements, harmonies and lush production. Redd Kross had their first single chart “Annie’s Gone”(#16 billboard modern rock), and began to tour with notable artists such as Sonic Youth, The Go-Go’s, The Posies, Jellyfish, The Lemonheads, and the HooDoo Gurus.\n\nRobert Hecker took leave as lead guitarist and the McDonald brothers were joined by Eddie Kurdziel (guitar), Brian Reitzell (drums), and Gere Fennelly (keyboards). They released the critically acclaimed “Phaseshifter” album in 1993 featuring the hit songs “Jimmy’s Fantasy”, “Lady In The Front Row”, and a raucous cover of Frightwigs “Crazy World”.\n\nRedd Kross toured relentlessly for the next several years, appearing on television sets across America performing on the Jon Stewart Show (pre Daily Show), Conan, and the Tonight Show. The band began working their magic on UK festival stages such as Redding Festival and Finsbury Park, and did a US arena tour with The Stone Temple Pilots and Meat Puppets.\n\nIn 1997, Redd Kross released one of their most polished albums, “Show World” featuring the perfectly crafted pop single, “Mess Around”. After supporting the album by touring with Sloan and the Presidents of the United States, the band went on a much needed hiatus. Fans wondered when they would return, and things seemed more uncertain after the untimely passing of guitarist Eddie Kurdziel in 1999.\n\nThe McDonald brothers launched www.ReddKross.com and began to reconnect with their fans and make new ones. They experimented with the new medium just as innovatively as they do with their music – Steven McDonald released an online only mashup album called “Redd Blood Cells” by adding bass tracks to the White Stripes album, Jeff McDonald began podcasting (“Hit It!”) before iPods or podcasts were invented, and also released a web based video series (Bitchin’ Ass”) far ahead of YouTube.\n\nRedd Kross reissued their classic “Neurotica” album as they worked on a variety of other projects including “Ze Malibu Kids”, “The Steven McDonald Group”, and worked in various capacities with other bands on stage and in the studio such as the Donnas, Turbonegro, Imperial Teen, Anna Waronker, be your own pet, fun., Sparks, Tenacious D, Beck and OFF!\n\nIn 2006, Jeff and Steven announced their reunion with the “classic Neurotica” line up – and were joined once again by guitarist Robert Hecker (IT’s OK) and drummer Roy McDonald (the Muffs). Redd Kross have been playing to enthusiastic audiences at sold out select shows and festivals such as the Azkena Festival, Coachella, and Pop Montréal.\n\n“Researching the Blues” is the highly anticipated new album. It is their first new album in 15 years and will be released on Merge Records August 7, 2012.\n\n—Jonathan Krop 2012\n\nRICHMOND FONTAINE: HISTORY 2011\n\nRichmond Fontaine was formed in 1994 at Portland Meadows racetrack in Portland, Oregon as songwriter/vocalist Willy Vlautin and bassist Dave Harding pored over the racing form and talked music between races. The two took their mutual love of Husker Du, Willie Nelson, X, The Blasters, and The Replacements and started playing music together. Before long, Fontaine was a solid four-piece outfit with an avid fan-base in the US and abroad.\n\nIn the 90’s Richmond Fontaine put out three albums on Cavity Search Records (Safety, Miles From, and Lost Son) and garnered praise for their powerful blend of rock, country, punk and folk. Critics took notice of Vlautin’s story-based songs, which have often drawn comparison to the short stories of Raymond Carver and Larry Brown.\n\nIn 2002 the band launched El Cortez Records and began work on a trilogy of albums that would earn critical acclaim in the US and UK, across Europe and as far away as Australia. 2002’s Winnemucca marked a departure for the band to a more introspective and acoustic-based style, broadening the band’s audience and catching the attention of critics. In 2004 Richmond Fontaine teamed with producer JD Foster (Richard Buckner, Calexico, Green on Red) on their lauded release, Post to Wire. Uncut named it Album of the Month and included it in their Top Five Albums of the Year, and Mojo called it a “must have Americana purchase”. Working again with Foster on 2005’s The Fitzgerald, the band again garnered rave reviews for this downbeat, stark, literary study of the working class American West. The Fitzgerald also received Uncut’s Album of the Month, calling it “absolute perfection”, and Q Magazine called it “the most beautiful sad album of the year”.\n\n2005 was a big year for the band and especially for Vlautin, who says the band got him the luckiest break of his life while touring The Fitzgerald – meeting a literary agent who was a big believer in his work. After writing short stories and novels for nearly twenty years, in 2006 Vlautin finally saw the publication of his first novel, The Motel Life, on Faber and Faber in the UK and Ireland, and then in the US on Harper Perennial in 2007. The Motel Life earned Vlautin a Silver Pen Award from the state of Nevada and was one of the few works of fiction to make the Washington Post’s Top 25 Books of 2007. The novel solidified Vlautin’s reputation as one of the most adept storytellers working today.\n\nLooking for a change of scenery, in 2006 Fontaine loaded up the van and drove to Tucson to record an album at the legendary Wavelab studio. JD Foster once again oversaw production on this collection of desert-inspired songs. Featuring guest appearances by Calexico’s Joey Burns and Jacob Valenzuela and Giant Sand’s Howe Gelb, Thirteen Cities counter-balances Vlautin’s clean, narrative lyrics with an array of instrumentation, from piano and vibes to accordion and pedal steel, strings and horns. The album was lavished with critical praise: The Independent called Vlautin “the Dylan of the dislocated” and The Sun said “Vlautin’s one of the most compelling songwriters working today, compared equally to great American novelists like Raymond Carver or John Steinbeck and musicians such as Bruce Springsteen or Tom Waits.”\n\nAfter a year sabbatical and the death of his mother, Vlautin emerged with a notebook of songs that would become We Used to Think the Freeway Sounded Like a River (2009). A highly personal and intimate work, these songs are an inventory of love and loss, regret and pain, shot through with instrumentation that expresses a gauntlet of emotion with Fontaine’s highly evolved, hard to categorize signature style. Uncut gave it a five star review saying, ‘Raw, autobiographical brilliance’ and the Sunday Express called it, “A dreamy, reverb-laden masterpiece” – 5/5\n\nTo date Vlautin has published two more novels: Northline (2008), which was a San Francisco Chronicle Top Ten Bestseller, and Lean on Pete (2010), which won the Ken Kesey Award for Fiction and was Hot Press’s book of the year. In ten years Vlautin and Richmond Fontaine have produced seven albums, three novels, an instrumental soundtrack for a novel (Northline), two live recordings and an EP.\n\nThe Motel Life is currently in production to become a major motion picture starring Emile Hirsch, Stephen Dorff, Dakota Fanning and Kris Kristoffersen. Richmond Fontaine is currently wrapping up work on their next release, The High Country, due out September 2011.\n\nSirah – Too You To Die.\n\nI started rapping “professionally” about 7 years ago, that included booking my own tours, sleeping on the floors of people I didn’t know, bathing in public restrooms, and accidentally kicking off a feminist revolution in Romania. I was taught how to rap by way of Project Blowed in South Central Los Angeles, it had a very “8 mile” vibe and when I got booed off stage I would come back next week a better rapper. They taught me how to paint my nails, rap with stage presence, and fight for the right to party. At the time I was in and out of homelessness which I pretended was camping, I stayed hungry in all senses of the word and somehow found my way. For the past few years I’ve somewhat transcended out of underground hip hop and now reside in musical purgatory, a place without genre where people try to label you themselves. I am in fact the “black guy” rapping on the Skrillex songs. Don’t mind the pale skin and breasts coming in short at 5’0 tall, I’ve somehow managed to stay true to my roots.\n\nNow we pull up to what I’m currently doing, I released a mixtape called C.U.L.T. a few months back, it was about my life, peoples misconceptions, trying to box me in etc. We decided to rerealese it with two new songs on it, one’s called “Made It” that was basically a freestyle about where I grew up and how I’ve finally “arrived” the other song’s called “When I’m Gone”. I was really moved by my fans (Cult kids) and how they’ve held me down through this whole wave, so I wanted to make them their own song. People always say “I love my fans, they’re the reason I do this.” Hate to break it to you but they’re for sure lying, I love my fans but I do this because the alternative is a psych ward. The fact that I have fans is literally beyond my wildest dreams, I’m a kid who was never supposed to make it anywhere or do anything so I love the kids that feel the same and support me, we’re in this together till the wheels fall off. C.U.L.T. Too Young To Die will be available as a free download on Tuesday 9/25\n\nK.Flay’s new EP, Eyes Shut, is a response to apathy. Thematically, the disc’s five tracks offer a dialogue about what it means to care—and not care—in the twentysomething era. K.Flay, the moniker for San Francisco-based musician Kristine Flaherty, reacts to this generational indifference musically. Her spit-fire rhymes and distorted indie-electro production are infused with unabashed passion and thoughtful concern.\n\nFlaherty, who grew up outside Chicago and launched her music career while enrolled at Stanford University, arrived at this subject matter after spending nearly a year touring the country solo. Although she was opening for artists like Passion Pit, 3OH!3 and Wallpaper, Flaherty took the stage alone each night, urging a deep sense of introspection that initially resulted in a mixtape called I Stopped Caring In ’96. The mixtape, which Flaherty self-released last spring, initiated the writing process for Eyes Shut.\n\n“I spent my first few years making music just messing around, not really having a sense of what I was about,” she explains. “With the mixtape, I started to realize my vision for the project. I made it in isolation, which was liberating in a creative sense. The songs on this EP start where the mixtape left off and reflect where I’m at in my own life now. There are no love songs. It’s really about a mindset, a perspective. A lot of the people I know are pretty apathetic and disillusioned. They’d rather check out than engage in something. I’m drawn to that myself at times and at other times I’m repelled by it.”\n\nIsolation is a theme in Flaherty’s creative process. She is a songwriter, musician and producer, who works alone on many of her tracks from conception to completion, sometimes in her mother’s basement.\n\nThe five tracks on the EP were written during the spring and summer of 2011, with most of the recording occurring in September. Influenced by a diverse array of artists including OutKast and Lykke Li, the EP is an innovative combination of hip-hop, electronica and indie rock aesthetics, all bolstered by Flaherty’s undeniable rapping ability.\n\nThe K.Flay live show shines through the recordings as well. “Until recently my recorded stuff hasn’t captured what I’m trying to do,” Flaherty says. “It’s only been in the last nine months that I’ve honed in on that. You hear ‘white girl rapping’ and you get wary. But the live show has really shown people what I’m about and the production aspect of what I do. So with the EP it was about how I can replicate that accurately in a live setting.”\n\nThe EP is a precursor to K.Flay’s debut full-length, which she hopes to release in the first half of 2012. Meanwhile, between writing, recording and touring, the musician, who recently performed at San Francisco’s Outside Lands Arts & Music Festival, has been sharpening her production skills by remixing other artists, including Beastie Boys, Young the Giant, Walk the Moon, and Oh Land. And she’s not touring quite so solo anymore—Flaherty recently added a drummer to the mix.\n\n“I feel like I’m taking the next step,” she says. “I’m in the process of taking something that was just nascent and, with the help of a few people, starting to flesh it out a little more. It’s been a real year of growth.”\n\nFlaherty may write about apathy, but she’s anything but apathetic.\n\nFrom Atlanta, Georgia, the origins of Deerhunter can be traced back to when frontman Bradford Cox first met guitarist Lockett Pundt at high school. Years later Bradford met Moses Archuleta and started jamming together. Other contributors to Deerhunter since its establishment in 2001 include Josh Fauver, Colin Mee and Whitney Petty. The current incarnation consists of Cox, Pundt and Archuleta plus bassist Josh Mckay and guitarist Frankie Broyles.\n\nDeerhunter’s first album was a lo-fi experiment not initially intended for the wider world, but appeared in 2005 on a local Atlanta label, Stickfigure. Although officially untitled, it has since become known as Turn It Up, Faggot; a phrase that doesn’t actually appear on the sleeve but is an insult that Cox claimed was often thrown at the band during their early gigs. Their next album, Cryptograms (2006), was generally considered to be their real debut and as such things started to get serious for the band. They had moved to fêted Chicago indie, Kranky (Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Low, Stars Of The Lid), and the world outside was starting to pay attention.\n\nThen in mid-2008, Deerhunter and Kranky signed a deal with 4AD, allowing them to finally release music outside the US and the band’s next move was to prove epic in more than just musical terms.?? Recorded over the course of a week at the Rare Book Studios in Brooklyn, NY, the Can and Wire-inspired Microcastle (2008) was to propel them to further heights. However, the album leaked four months before release, leading the band back to the studio to record Weird Era Cont., an album in its own right added as a bonus disc to make Microcastle a 25-track colossus. Not content with such prolificacy, the band announced a new five track EP, Rainwater Cassette Exchange, in 2009 and that its release would coincide with the band’s extensive European, Japanese and Australian tour in May and June.??\n\nDisplaying few signs of slowing down, Halcyon Digest, the band’s fourth studio album was released in September 2010. Remaining in their native Georgia to piece together the album, Halcyon Digest took just a few weeks to complete. The recording sessions took place at Chase Park Transduction in Athens with Ben H. Allen helping to co-produce the album, while final track, ‘He Would Have Laughed’, was recorded separately by Bradford Cox at NOTOWN SOUND in Marietta. To announce the release, the band fully embraced the DIY mindset of their New Wave heroes from the 70’s and 80’s with a Cox-designed, cut-and-paste Xeroxed flyer. It’s with these kind of approaches that Deerhunter continue to widen their sphere of influence and impress with each subsequent release.\n\nAfter a brief hiatus, during which time Bradford Cox and Lockett Pundt released their own albums as Atlas Sound and Lotus Plaza respectively, a new Deerhunter line-up (with additions of bassist Josh Mckay and guitarist Frankie Broyles) reconvened in January 2013 at Rare Book Studio in Brooklyn, New York. Produced by Nicholas Vernhes and Bradford Cox and recorded in the dead of night, Deerhunter’s new longplayer Monomania will be released in May. Monomania finds the group recalling its scrappy punk aesthetic; a perfect nocturnal garage rock album full of the layered and hazy vintage guitar sounds that define them.\n\nMusical anthropologists interested in the study of just how fast a band can evolve need look no further than the six upright, upstanding men in Oregon’s Larry and His Flask. Formed by brothers Jamin and Jesse Marshall in 2003, the Flask (as the band’s expanding army of fans calls them) spent its first half-decade stuck in a primordial, punk-rock goop, where a blood-sweat-and-beers live show took priority over things like notes and melodies. Don’t misunderstand: The band was (somewhat) skilled and an absolute joy to watch, but the goal was always the party over perfection.\n\nOver the past two years, however, Larry and His Flask has gone from crawl to sprint at breakneck speed. First, Jamin Marshall moved from gargling-nails vocals to drums. Guitarist Ian Cook became the band’s primary voice. And a trio of talented pickers and singers — Dallin Bulkley (guitars), Kirk Skatvold (mandolin) and Andrew Carew (banjo) — joined the family. (And no, you didn’t miss something. No one is named Larry.)\n\nDetermined to make music for a living or die trying, the six brothers set out in a van, intent on playing for anyone, anywhere at any time. From coffee shops to dive bars and street corners to theater stages, the Flask honed their sound and show through experience, attacking each gig like buskers who must grab and hold the attention of passersby in hopes of collecting enough change to get to the next town.\n\nBy 2009, Larry and His Flask’s train began gaining steam. The band’s new songs are a blurry blend of lightning fast string-band picking, gorgeous nods to old-school country, and sublime multi-part harmonies, all presented through a prism of punk chaos. The boys have grown and changed, yes, but their shows are still gloriously physical displays of live music’s sheer power. In other words, keep your eyes peeled, or risk taking the heavy end of Jesse Marshall’s flailing, stand-up bass right between the eyes.\n\nA slot supporting the Dropkick Murphys in the Flask’s hometown led to an invitation to open for the Celtic punk kingpins across the eastern half of the United States, as well as an opportunity to finally record their new, twangier sound. The result is Larry and His Flask’s three-song, self-titled 7″ record, pressed in a limited run that’s quickly being snapped up by the band’s new fans, who’ve been clamoring for a sip of aural hooch to call their own.\n\nIn mid-2010, the Flask is holed up in their crash pad in Central Oregon, working on songs for their first full-length, playing gigs here and there, and, in the words of Jesse Marshall, “fixing the van and all our broken shit” in anticipation of the next leg of a lifelong tour. Keep up with the band’s never-ending tour schedule at www.larryandhisflask.com\n\nIan Cook – Vocals + Guitar\n\nJamin Marshall – Vocals + Percussion\n\nJeshua Marshall – Vocals + Double Bass + Trumpet + Harmonicas\n\nDallin Bulkley – Vocals + Guitar + Not Guilty\n\nAndrew Carew – Vocals + Banjo\n\nKirk Skatvold – Vocals + Mandolin\n\nWhat happens when your band’s debut album is a run-scoring hit with both music and baseball fans? If you’re The Baseball Project, you grab some friends to fill out your bench, take batting practice by writing songs for ESPN and deliver a strikeout pitch with Volume Two: High and Inside. The new album from Steve Wynn, Scott McCaughey, Linda Pitmon and Peter Buck is another winning collection of songs about the game’s greats that will be pleasing to those who love America’s pastime — and fans of intelligent, melodic and fun rock.\n\nWhen the first Baseball Project album, Volume One: Frozen Ropes and Dying Quails, was released in 2008 Wynn, McCaughey, Pitmon and Buck had yet to play one note as a unit in front of an audience. But after playing throughout the U.S. in 2009 the quartet were — as McCaughey jokes — “a well-oiled touring machine,” which allowed the band to complete the basics for this new album in just two days. Wynn adds, “We definitely knew how to play as a band when we went in this time and I think you can hear that chemistry on the record.”\n\nHigh and Inside is a collection that sees the quartet deftly mix witty lyrics about baseball players past and present with a sharp melodic sensibility and engaging choruses. Opener “1976” is one of the catchiest songs to ever be written about anything from Detroit. (In this case, it’s Tigers phenom pitcher Mark “The Bird” Fidrych.) “Ichiro Goes to the Moon” is a manic punk-pop track that marvels at the Seattle Mariners outfielder’s ability to eat, build rockets, and yes, play baseball. High and Inside also explores more musical avenues than the first Baseball Project outing. “Pete Rose Way” is a slice of alt-country that echoes one of McCaughey’s and Buck’s other projects, Tired Pony. And closer “Here Lies Carl Mays” takes the story of the only pitcher to throw a ball that killed another player and turns it into a haunting ballad sung from beyond the grave.\n\n“Fair Weather Fans” describes the band’s widespread allegiances to the Giants, A’s and Mariners for McCaughey, the Dodgers and Yankees for Wynn, and the Twins and Yankees for Pitmon. Yet the team most represented on High and Inside is none of those — it’s the Yankees’ rivals the Boston Red Sox. McCaughey imagines a world where Bill Buckner’s legacy wasn’t tarnished by a groundball in “Buckner’s Bolero.” Wynn sings of a different tarnished legacy in “Twilight of My Career,” which explores the glorious but sordid post-Sox career of Cy Young award-winning pitcher Roger Clemens. And “Tony (Boston’s Chosen Son)” is a violin-driven piece that recalls Bob Dylan’s Desire as it honors late beloved Boston player and announcer Tony Conigliaro. Wynn admits, “It’s weird that a Yankee fan like me would end up writing more about the Red Sox, but tragedy just makes for better songs and stories than a litany of successes.”\n\nThe quartet invited a lot of their friends to help out on Volume 2. Wynn explains, “We had wanted to include some like-minded baseball rocker pals on the first record but there just wasn’t time so we were able to open the door this time around.” Into that open door came contributions from Death Cab for Cutie’s Ben Gibbard (who adds backing vocals to “Ichiro Goes to the Moon”), Los Lobos’ Steve Berlin, The Decemberists’ Chris Funk and John Moen, Yo La Tengo’s Ira Kaplan and The Hold Steady’s Craig Finn, who supplies lyrics and the lead vocal on the Minnesota Twins anthem “Please Don’t Call Them Twinkies.” Twins fan Pitmon had bonded with Finn over the team when the Minnesota natives reconnected in New York. And Pitmon says she was thrilled when Finn accepted the job of writing lyrics about their favorite team. She explains, “I think Craig perfectly captured the feelings that a lot of us Twins fans have for our team of humble, hardworking guys that seem to beat the odds more often than not, and Steve really nailed the mood of the lyrics when he wrote the anthemic tune we set it to.” Finn says, “The Twins don’t win every year, or even every decade. They don’t normally compete in the off-season arms race – they develop talent. Thus, when they do win I get to feel elation and bliss, and not just relief. In some way, it’s like music; many of my all-time favorite bands aren’t that great every night, but when it comes together it feels even sweeter.”\n\nThe success and critical acclaim of Volume One opened up new opportunities that these veteran musicians never imagined. McCaughey is still amazed they appeared on the long-running weekly Major League Baseball program This Week in Baseball. “I can’t say I ever thought I’d hear or see myself on TWIB — that was awesome,” McCaughey exclaims. “As a kid I dreamed of it, but I would have been making a diving catch in the outfield instead of bashing on an electric guitar.” The band also struck up a relationship with ESPN that saw them launch The Broadside Ballads series. Wynn and McCaughey took it upon themselves to write and record a song per month for the 2010 season that were available as free downloads at ESPN.com. Wynn says, “It’s very exhilarating and also exhausting to come up with tunes based on the calendar rather than the muse, especially since we were all busy and on the move with our own projects throughout 2010 but that made it even more fun. I loved that songs would begin in Virginia, for example, get shuttled off to Berlin, back to New York and then over to Portland all within a few weeks.”\n\nThe Baseball Project was born out of McCaughey and Wynn discussing their love of the game over dinner and drinks a few years ago. “It finally took flight at the R.E.M. pre-Hall of Fame induction party in New York,” Wynn remembers. “Everyone was happy. The wine was flowing, the food was incredible and spring training had just started. Scott and I talked baseball until most of the party guests had cleared out. And we actually remembered it the next day.”\n\nBoth Wynn and McCaughey’s love of baseball and its legendary players made its way sporadically into songs during their distinguished careers. The Young Fresh Fellows named-checked Seattle Mariners slugger Gorman Thomas on “Aurora Bridge” from 1986’s Refreshments, while Wynn tipped his cap to Hall of Famers Mickey Mantle and Stan Musial in his 1990 solo hit “Kerosene Man.”\n\nSo with another Volume down, the question needs to be asked — will there be a Volume 3? McCaughey says it’s a certainty, since he still wants to write tunes about “Ted Kubiak, Butch Huskey, Don McMahon, Don Moss, Kris “Iron Man” Benson and Wilton “Peanuts” Guerrero.” Wynn adds, “Just open the Baseball Encyclopedia or the 2011 MLB press guide to any page. There are still plenty of tales to tell.”\n\nAll young bands go through growing pains, and Gold Fields is no exception. It took three different tries before they made a version of their debut album, Black Sun, that met their expectations. Not that you’d ever guess that from listening to the finished product. Like their explosive live shows and the self-titled EP that preceded it last year, the Australian quintet’s debut full-length displays invention, drive, and a commitment to artistic expression that belies the group’s tender years.\n\nGold Fields’ lively originals teem with variegated percussion and interwoven vocals, from opener “Meet My Friends,” with its buzzing keyboards, wordless vocal hook, and an indelible chorus, to eerie closer “Anxiety,” animated by its play of elongated phrases against staccato rhythms. Though the band’s sound defies pigeonholing, and each song boasts a distinctive identity, a musical through-line unifies the album’s eleven originals: by juxtaposing light and darkness, Gold Fields imbues even its most ebullient performances with melancholy—and vice-versa.\n\nThis is particularly evident on the first single, “Dark Again,” a standout from its inception as a demo. “The lyrics were written about pulling yourself out of a rut,” singer Mark Fuller told Rolling Stone in September 2012. “More specifically, pulling a relationship out of a rut. It’s just about snapping out of a negative mindframe and realizing that you’ve got something pretty special.” Carried along on waves of percolating synthesizer and rippling guitar, the song builds momentum as it surges towards a powerful, sing-along chorus.\n\nInterplay of layers, textures, and contrasting moods figures prominently throughout Black Sun. On “Happy Boy,” Fuller incants “I’m going to be happy” like the mantra of a man trapped at the bottom of a well, even as dirty disco bass and crisp hi-hat swirl around him. The syncopated rhythms and shifting dynamics of “The Woods” and “Treehouse” evoke the otherworldly ambience of venturing deep into the wilderness, slivers of light throwing shapes across the forest floor.\n\nGold Fields has already played major festivals throughout Australia, supported Crystal Castles, Metric, Pnau, and Datarock, and gone down a storm at intimate venues from Los Angeles to London. Featuring two full drum kits and plenty of handheld percussion, the Gold Fields concert experience explodes with kinetic energy. “We really like to have fun on stage and get into the show,” confirms guitarist Vin Andanar. In lieu of painstaking recreations of the studio recordings, the quintet’s mutable live arrangements build, wave upon wave, into propulsive, sinewy grooves that supercharge the energy in the room.\n\nSome young bands have to prod unfamiliar audiences to dance, but not Gold Fields. They’d be hard pressed to convince crowds to actually stand still for 30 seconds, and the non-stop momentum of their sets ensures there’s nary an opportunity to do so. As the nod to the Police’s classic “Roxanne” in “Meet My Friends” underscores, Gold Fields are committed to writing songs that are accessible yet multi-layered, marrying rhythmic drive with lyrical gravitas. “All along, we’ve had it in our heads that we were writing pop music that we’d love to see at a festival or hear on the radio, but tinted with a bit of darkness and melancholy running throughout,” concurs Fuller.\n\nThe band self-produced the album at home in Ballarat, after initial tracking sessions in LA with producer Mickey Petralia (Ladytron, Peaches) and Sydney with producer/engineer Scott Horscroft (The Presets, Sleepy Jackson, Silverchair).\n\nThe recordings that emerged from all these sessions were polished and professional… but something felt off. In a daring move for a young band with escalating buzz, Gold Fields decided to start over yet again. With new knowledge and experience under their collective belts, they returned to the D.I.Y. methods that’d yielded their initial successes.\n\nGold Fields had written and recorded all its early material—not only the demos that secured their record deal, but also the tracks that formed the basis of their debut single, “Treehouse,” and subsequent self-titled EP—in Andanar’s bedroom. Once again they retreated home to Ballarat, a Victorian era boomtown located about an hour’s drive west of Melbourne. With help from friends and borrowed equipment, they fashioned an ad hoc studio in the Fuller family’s garage and customized it with strings of Christmas lights, early album art, and even an illuminated Gold Fields light box built by Fuller’s brother-in-law.\n\nIt was the dead of winter outside, so the boys staved off chills by keeping their bodies and imaginations in constant motion. As soon as basic parts had been laid down, the quintet devoted several days to the sort of playful experimentation that had characterized their earlier work, making beats by banging on chairs and discarded lumber.\n\nOther bands might have buckled under the strain of devoting so much time and energy to making a single record, but Gold Fields is a tight-knit lot, the result of friendships that predate the group’s formation in early 2010. Now all those countless hours together paid off. Assisted by engineer and longtime colleague Malcolm Besley, the band’s performances flowed forth freely and fluidly, yielding the organic sounding results they’d sought. “This time we definitely knew what we wanted,” concludes Andanar. “We knew what the songs should sound like, and now realizing the sound in our heads was the challenge.”\n\nGold Fields traveled a long way, both geographically and musically, to get to this point; no wonder the boys were willing to go the extra mile to make sure their debut full-length sounded just as they’d imagined it should. With all its twists and turns, making Black Sun turned out to be a bit of an odyssey, but one that ultimately concludes with a very happy ending—and the promise of more adventures to come.\n\nThey may call Bloomington, Indiana, home, but since their 2000 formation, Murder by Death have been a band without musical borders. Theirs is a world where Old West murder ballads mingle with rock-injected Western classicism; where an album’s sequencing can take listeners from a haunted back alley in rural Mexico to a raucous Irish pub. All of which is to say, Murder by Death albums don’t just string together songs; they create experiences. With their fifth album (and second for Vagrant), Good Morning, Magpie (04/06/10), Murder by Death continue the tradition of border expansion that drove career standouts like 2006’s In Bocca al Lupo and 2008’s Red of Tooth and Claw. The difference, however, is that this time, the band literally went off the map to get there.\n\n“Going into the woods helped me write in a way I never would’ve been able to otherwise,” says singer/guitarist Adam Turla, recalling the 2009 retreat into the Tennessee mountains during which, armed with little more than a tent, a fishing pole and a notebook, he wrote the 11 songs that would become Good Morning, Magpie. “There were days where I’d sit down and write for seven hours, make dinner, and then sit down and write late into the night with my little camp light going: just intense, nonstop sessions of pure writing. I’ve never worked that way, ever, because with all the business of being a band, I’ve never had so little to do! Every day I was either cooking, hiking while writing, or writing. I didn’t speak to a single person the whole time.”\n\nBe that as it may, Good Morning, Magpie still speaks volumes. Recorded at Bloomington’s Farm Fresh Studios with Jake Belser (who most recently worked with MBD on their all-instrumental soundtrack to Jeff Vandermeer’s 2009 book Finch), and mixed by Grammy-winning Red of Tooth and Claw producer Trina Shoemaker, the album weaves 11 disparate stories into a whole that’s unlike anything else in the band’s catalog. “These songs definitely come together as an album; we just aren’t relying on a concept this time,” says Turla, referencing the conceptual storylines that drove Murder by Death’s last two albums as well as 2002’s Who Will Survive, and What Will Be Left of Them? “Being out in the woods with no pressure freed me up to explore different moods and different stories, all of which became linked through the experience I had writing them: just that sheer sprint of working in isolation.”\n\nWith its junk-pile percussion and ramshackle Vaudevillian flow, “You Don’t Miss Twice” is the only song on Good Morning, Magpie that directly references Turla’s time in the woods—but the song’s spirit informs much of what surrounds it. “I was telling a friend how I thought this was our most upbeat record, and his reply was, ‘Seriously?’” Turla recalls, laughing. “But ‘upbeat’ doesn’t necessarily mean ‘happy.’ Take a song like ‘Yes’—it’s got this fun, shuffling beat and this amazingly catchy melody from Sarah [Balliet, cello], but the lyrics are all about accepting death. Or ‘Whiskey in the World,’ which is basically a sad bastard’s lament about how the whiskey that makes this character enjoy life is also what condemns him. That duality between the music and the lyrics is something we haven’t done much until now.”\n\nEven though it was written in isolation, Good Morning, Magpie came together over six weeks of rehearsals back in Bloomington—ultimately marking the first time the band recorded a full-length at home. “We ultimately just decided to record in Bloomington because we had a friend here [Belser] with his own studio, and he’d already done a great job with the Finch soundtrack and our B-sides and 7-inches; and we also lucked out and had Trina [Shoemaker] basically making herself available to help us mix whenever we were finished. So then we started thinking, “Man, we have all this time to ourselves; we should just bring in our friends—musicians from Bloomington and Louisville, Kentucky, which is about 75 miles away—and just play parts here and there. It was great—the album ended up with a lot of different instrumentation, and we paid everyone in whiskey.”\n\nIn keeping with Murder by Death tradition, whiskey also plays muse to a handful of Good Morning, Magpie’s songs—including the Balliet-penned opener, “Kentucky Bourbon,” which sounds like a Bulleit jingle spun through an old Victrola. But as the album progresses, the songs wind through other locales and moods: from eerie Southern-gothic territory (the creeping, uneasy “White Noise”) to an old Spanish cabaret (“On the Dark Streets Below”) to the high-noon drama of the title track—itself inspired equally by Welsh legend (the title references a tale of the magpie as Satan’s messenger) and the American West. No mere genre exercise, Good Morning, Magpie feels like a travelogue from a band that’s logged the miles to write from experience.\n\n“Travel is a big part of this band’s reason for being,” says Turla, noting that the past few years have seen Murder by Death’s passports stamped in Alaska, Greece, Norway and the Italian island of Sardinia, among other far-flung locales. They have challenged their fans to book them all over the world – in as many unique places as possible. “I personally love the sense of variety you get from traveling, and I’m sure that idea influenced the way I approached a lot of these songs. Trying to use different styles and throw in different influences—whether it’s the way you turn a phrase or play a certain note—you can suggest different places,” he concludes. “That’s the fun of fiction; that’s the fun of movies, and music can have that effect, too. It’s all about being able to transport people to another place.”\n\nVanaprasta knows where rock music has been, and the Los Angeles quintet knows where it wants to take it. “Someplace mystical,” singer Steven Wilkin says, “where there’s arena-sized sound.”\n\nIn less than three years, Wilkin, bassist Taylor Brown, drummer Ben Smiley and guitarists Collin Desha and Cameron Dmytryk have circumnavigated the nebulous L.A. indie-rock universe, releasing an EP, teasing with a couple of singles and turning in enough neck-snapping live performances to give Angelenos whiplash from Silver Lake to the Sunset Strip.\n\nFinally, after three forays into the studio, Vanaprasta unveils Healthy Geometry (out Nov. 1, 2011), a forward-thinking, galactic-sounding debut that draws from the indie, experimental, psychedelic and R&B worlds to shape music that is at once visceral and visionary. Critics have name-checked the Killers (LA Weekly), Kings of Leon (Consequence of Sound) and Mew (Buzz Bands LA), but Healthy Geometry?s broad dynamic also finds antecedents in the work of Pink Floyd, Radiohead, Muse, Modest Mouse and Black Sabbath.\n\n“For a while, we called our sound ‘guitarwave,’ and the guys joke around that it should be ‘Indie Rock Guitar Hero’ or ‘Epic Karaoke,’” Wilkin says with a smile. “But whatever it is, I?m glad we had the patience to find the best way to capture it, and to cultivate who we are as a band.”\n\nAnd who is Vanaprasta? It is five technicians from divergent backgrounds (with equally broad tastes) who comingled in L.A.’s musical melting pot in 2008. From their first jam session, the mixing of molecules in the room generated an energy that was palpable, and end result of that night was, Vanaprasta.\n\nThe key ingredients in the quintet’s stew are the colliding guitars of Dmytryk, a former punk-rock kid from Oregon, and Desha, a native Hawaiian with a foundation in slack key guitar, which wrestle atop powerful, shape-shifting rhythms from Brown and Smiley. Wilkin’s balletic tenor (he was a child opera singer in Utah) holds the mold together.\n\nThe band’s stadium sound illuminates themes ranging from the highly emotional to the dauntingly intellectual. Vanaprasta (whose name derives\n\nfrom the Sanskrit word for a forest-dweller who has given up much of his worldly possessions) is fascinated with numerology, geometry and patterns, and what any or all them might mean in a world seemingly ruled by inefficacy and chaos.\n\nHealthy Geometry was produced and mixed by Dave Schiffman, who recorded the band using mostly live takes with minimal overdubbing. It was mastered by Howie Weinberg, who kudoed the band on what he heard. “Working with Dave was super smooth,” Wilkin says. “He came out and saw us live, and basically we let him run with his interpretation of our live show.\n\nHealthy Geometry, which can?t be categorized into any particular genre but stands on its own as a complete body of work, encapsulates all the different moving parts and ingredients that make up Vanaprasta.\n\n-Kevin Bronson\n\nI am Phil Elverum. Here is my brief autobiography for journalists and fact seekers:\n\nI am 34 years old. I am from the town of Anacortes, Washington. Since 1997 my primary life’s work has been making studio-based music, first under the name “the Microphones” (1997 – 2002) and then “Mount Eerie” (2003 – present). In addition to this I have played in other bands (D+, Old Time Relijun), produced other peoples’ recordings and dabbled in painting, writing, and photography.\n\nAside from 5 years in Olympia, Wash. and a long winter in northern Norway (2002/2003), I have lived most of my life in Anacortes and much of the content of my music and other art is tied to the place. My music project Mount Eerie is named after the actual mountain, Mt. Erie, that lies just south of town. I try to make music that feels associated with this particular place in some way, whether it’s literally described in words or just an ambiguous feeling.\n\nThe “Microphones era” in Olympia (1997-2002) was very prolific, with 5 major albums (and many smaller things) being released by the K label. The most critically acclaimed was “the Glow pt. 2” (2001). Following that was an album called “Mount Eerie” by the Microphones.\n\nI did not feel totally satisfied artistically with my exploration of the “Mount Eerie” idea on the album of that name so in 2003 I changed the name of my whole project to Mount Eerie. I did this partly to explore the idea more deeply and partly because the name had become more relevant to my songs than “the Microphones”, not to mention the appeal of being conceptually rooted to an actual place.\n\nIn 2004 I started releasing my own projects via the “P.W. Elverum & Sun, ltd.” company in an attempt to become even more self-sufficient and also to be able to explore unusual packaging ideas. The first major release was “No Flashlight” by Mount Eerie (2005) which came wrapped in a gargantuan poster. Since then I have released many fancy LPs and an extravagant art book of photography. I continue to explore new ideas for mass producing art and music in a homemade style. P.W. Elverum & Sun remains primarily a vehicle for my own projects only, not a real record label. Deeper simple self-sufficiency seems to be a good way to weather the tumultuous times we live in.\n\nHere’s what the journalist Brandon Stosuy said to describe what my stuff is actually about (inthe Believer):\n\n“Regardless of the moniker, the various collections include interlocking themes, references to earlier works, and are marked by Elverum’s distinctive naturalist self-recorded lo-fi analog sound that mixes a whispered, gentle voice, which can also yell and bellow, with various strains of sound: His work can be delicately spare or booming and ambitiously layered and noisy, often in the same song. Lyrically, he focuses on memory, first-person storytelling, myth, naturalism, the everyday as sacred, and a sense of place (in and out of Washington State), among other related things.”\n\nHere’s another nice blurb (from Jeff Manson writing in the Bolinas Hearsay News):\n\n“Mt. Eerie is the current incarnation of enigmatic sound wizard, nature philosopher, neo-beat, radical feminist, Pacific Northwest Shredder/legend Phil Elverum. I first became aware of his music in the late 90s in Santa Cruz when he came through town regularly performing in basements and on the beach in/as his old band name “the Microphones”. For the past 10 plus years I’ve witnessed Phil crank out an amazing body of work, from self-recorded albums, to photo-books, to goofy comics. He makes consistently mesmerizing bold work outside any particular genre and does so with an unaffected sense of humor that is rare in most artists.”\n\nBARONESS formed in 2003 in Savannah, GA, comprised of a group of friends who grew up together in Lexington, VA, a small town in the Blue Ridge Mountains.\n\nShortly after their formation, the band released two EPs and a split EP with Unpersons entitled respectively, First, Second andA Grey Sigh in a Flower Husk. From their origin right through the release of these EPs, BARONESS toured non-stop throughout America and Europe, building up a steady underground fan base.\n\nIn late 2006, the band began working on their first proper full-length, and debut for Relapse, Red Album. Recorded by Philip Cope (Kylesa), the album was a big step forward from the band’s earlier material; they began to develop a sense of melody and song structure as a counter-balance to the EP’s brute intensity. The release of Red Album saw the band touring world-wide and year-round for the next two years. The record received high critical praise, eventually garnering the #1 Album-of-the-Year slot in Revolver Magazine.\n\nIn between tours, and exactly two years after writing Red Album, BARONESS returned to the studio to record a follow-up record. The band enlisted the help of Grammy-nominated engineer/producer John Congleton (Explosions in the Sky, St. Vincent, Black Mountain, etc.). In 2009, Relapse released Blue Record, another comprehensive step forward for the band’s ever-evolving sound. The record continued the band’s growing sense of melody while directing the focus to an “album-as-an-art-form” concept. Blue Record was named 2009’s Album-of-the-Year by Decibel Magazine, and made an impact on the Best-Of lists in publications as varied as Pitchfork, Village Voice, PopMatters, Revolver, Rock Sound and Metal Hammer.\n\nBARONESS’ mission statement has always been simple: keep an open mind, confront challenges, avoid repetition and take the music to diverse audiences. BARONESS toured constantly and extensively for two years straight with Blue Record, sharing the stage with such bands as METALLICA, MASTODON, DEFTONES, and ISIS. The band also played a variety of festivals, including Coachella (US), Oya (Norway), Bonnaroo (US) and Soundwave (AUS).\n\nBARONESS took the year off in 2011 for the first time in nearly a decade in order to focus on writing a new and more challenging third full-length. After a year of writing and refining, the band entered Water Music Studios in Hoboken, NJ with co-producer John Congleton to record their highly anticipated third full-length, Yellow & Green. Tracked in both Hoboken and Congleton’s own Elmwood Studio in Dallas, TX, the new full-length was released in July 2012 via Relapse Records and debuted at #30 on Billboard’s Top 200 Album chart. The double-album was dubbed a “thrilling hard-rock epic” by Rolling Stone, the New York Times said the 18-track release included “a grand sprawl of riffs and ruminations” and Artist Direct, after awarding the band “Rock Band of the Year” honors said “they epitomize the spirit of the greats like Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, while remaining wholly unique. It’s something we need more of. Baroness are everything that a rock band should be — and more.”\n\nThe band supported the album with a sold-out North American tour as direct support for Meshuggah and a main stage appearance at Metallica’s inaugural Orion Music + More Fest. In late July, they headed to Europe for a round of summer festival appearances and headlining dates which was tragically cut short due to a near fatal bus accident in Bath, England. The band and crew suffered a variety of injuries in the 30 foot plummet and have been at different stages of recovery since.\n\nAs the year came to a close, Baroness dominated year-end lists with Entertainment Weekly and Spin both naming Yellow & Green their #1 metal release of 2012 and iTunes awarding “Take My Bones Away” the distinction of best metal song of the year. Decibel (#2), Guitar World (#15), Loudwire (#4), Magnet (#12), Pitchfork (#3 on Metal Albums, #25 Best Albums of 2012), Revolver (#4), Stereogum (#18) and the Village Voice (#6) also gave the album top honors.\n\nInternationally, the album fared similarly, receiving top honors from Terrorizer (#2), BBC Music (#13), Metal Hammer Germany (#4), Metal Hammer Norway (#4), Metal Hammer UK (#14), Close Up Sweden (#4) and Visions Germany (#4).\n\n2013 is the year that Baroness will get back on their feet and come back stronger than ever. The band is planning a series of shows and festival appearances to show the world that even the worst of tragedies cannot hold them back.\n\n“I bump fades when I fuck. So what?” says the muscular, shirtless man, digitally rendered as part of the virtual-world game Second Life, as he cocks his head to the side and spreads his arms wide. This is the type of Internet art Mike Grabarek and Jeremy Scott, together known as electronic R&B duo Magic Fades, forge out of found images and post on Tumblr. They’re mild gamers, but it’s the images, not the games themselves, that hold so much intrigue for the duo. “People are creating what they think would be the ultimate human,” Scott explains.\n\nThis quest for perfection is not lost on Scott and Grabarek. Musically, Magic Fades is hard to pin down but can be geolocated somewhere in the bloggy, foggy Bermuda Triangle between “new alternative,” dreamy R&B and the emerging micro-genre referred to as “vaporwave.” In short, Grabarek says, their goal is “to make weird music that is also poppy.” Lyrically, their songs ooze with romance, swagger and sex. On “Sims Hunk,” from last year’s Mishka-releasedObsession, Grabarek promises, “I can do this for hours/ Let’s make this night ours.”\n\nAlthough currently relegated to opening slots in Portland, Magic Fades has made a lot of fans on the Web. Last year, Scott and Grabarek took what they considered their best song, the twinkling, thumping “Endless Summer,” to the now-defunct Dior Nights Facebook group, a collection of like-minded influential artists and musicians across the U.S. With support from respected Knoxville-based producer Slow Head, Magic Fades saw its SoundCloud play counts rise considerably. Last month, along with fellow Portlander Vektroid, the group performed on Tinychat—a “very ghetto” live video-streaming site, according to Grabarek—and attracted so many viewers that the site crashed.\n\nMagic Fades’ local rep is gradually increasing, especially after playing last summer’s Dark Arts Fest. Since then, requests to open for acts like Onuinu and Shy Girls have streamed in, and Scott and Grabarek bagged a monthly DJ night at Holocene, which they’re calling Real Emotion: Slow Jams & Cosmic Soul. “We’ve been fortunate to open for bands people love,” Grabarek says. “Normally if we get a response from a booking agent, it’s gonna be one word: no.” With Scott on keyboards and backing vocals and Grabarek singing lead and shredding guitar, Magic Fades’ sultry jams are difficult for a lot of club kids to grasp, and normally they elicit little more than the typical head-bob from uninitiated crowds. Bigger nights have seen other results, however. At their New Year’s Eve performance at Holocene, Scott says, “a group of girls were wasted and they were getting freaky.” Grabarek pauses: “Who’s that girl? I can’t remember her name. She was twerking pretty hard actually.”\n\nMagic Fades isn’t planning to leave the bedroom world of SoundClouds, tweets and Tumbles behind, but you can bet that expanding into the club world will change how it operates. “It’s not just searching tags or whatever,” Scott says. “It’s about being friends with someone and trusting their taste.”\n\nPRESENTED BY KIND SNACKS\n\n“I suppose it’s never enough I you get what you want then you want what was I but I’d rather worry about my existential crisis I laying on a beach where the sun sets the nicest”- “Get That”\n\n!!! will release their new album THR!!!ER on April22, 2012 on Warp Records. It is the fifth full-length from the sonically adventurous sextet and its third for Warp. THR!!!ER finds the band reconciling its love for building playlists from disparate dance singles with its continued devotion to the cohesive album format. Famous for its off the hinges live shows and relentless touring schedule, this time the group focused itself on lyrics and tighter song structures. To help ! ! ! on this mission, the majority of THR!!!ER was recorded with Jim Eno, the drummer in Spoon and one of key forces behind the boards for the lauded indie rock band.\n\nComing into THR!!!ER, the members of!!! knew that this was an album where they almost had to reintroduce themselves, showing a developed and impactful take on how they present their sound. “It’s the kind of the record that feels like more of everything,” says vocalist Nic Offer. “It’s more immediate, it’s more honest about our lives. There was a real focus in this band. We knew the lyrics had to be better, the choruses had to be better, it had to be more original. We went for everything. Everything was pushed.” Well, friends told her this and friends told her that/ But friends don’t choose what echoes in your head- “When The Water’s Cold”\n\n!!! began the process for making THR!!!ER when Offer visited Jim Eno’s Austin studio during South by Southwest in 2011 with a few hours before their plane was supposed to leave. Eventually the whole band returned for several sessions in the spring and summer of 2012. ! ! ! and Spoon are longtime fans of each other, and guitarist Mario Andreoni explains, they were attracted to working with Jim because, “We all had a healthy respect for the sound, space, and vibe of Spoon’s LP’s and Jim forced us to economize … the playing … the structure … lyrics. Everything had to have a purpose and hold attention.”\n\nLike many people, Jim was a fan of!! !’s live show, but he felt that they too often tried to capture these performances in the studio. Instead of trying to chase this feeling, Jim encouraged them to create a different type of excitement by using weirder sounds, inventing new dynamics within each song and introducing unexpected changes. “They had this working flow that was a little rigid and I wanted to break them out of it,” says Jim. “Those guys can play, and if you can play, you might as well just play your instruments and record it.” In the end, ! ! ! say it was Jim’s input that provided the cohesion that THR!!IER needed.\n\n!!! is a bicoastal band with over a decade of history. Offer, keyboardist Daniel Gorman, and new bassist Rafael Cohen {formerly of El Guapo and Supersystem) all live in Brooklyn, drummer Paul Quattrone resides in Pittsburgh, keyboardist Allan Wilson remain lives in Portland, OR while Andreoni remains in Sacramento, where the group was formed. Understandably this situation isn’t the easiest for creating new music. “In the past we just put albums together any way that works,” says Andreoni. That usually meant a lot of jamming on loose ideas. For THRillER,!!! went into the studio with everything written and a strong sense of each song’s shape. This advanced preparation is reflected in THRillER’s catchier choruses, bulletproof structure and masterful twists. “One Girl/One Boy” is pure dancefloor candy built over subversive sounds, while “Get That Rhythm” (produced by Simian Mobile Disco’s Jas Shaw) rides the bassline to a much darker corner of the club. Centerpiece ”Siyde”-produced by the band and Patrick Ford-is a tribute to cut-and-paste classics in an era when sampling is prohibitively expensive, so ! ! ! devised all the imagined samples themselves. Rough-edged album closer “Station (Meet Me At The)” might be the most menacing song the group has ever released, and they execute the switchblade attitude naturally.\n\nThough Offer handles most of the vocals on THR!!!ER, other voices populate the album. Cohen handles the moody and percussive “Fine, Fine, Fine,” and the roster of contributing female singers include fellow Sacramento-to-New York transplant Teresa Eggers, Heartless Bastards’ Erika Wennerstrom and Austin studio pro Sonia Moore (who did the yea yeahs on MC Hammer’s “2 Legit 2 Quit”). Says Offer, “We’ve never tried to make the same record twice, we might have accidentally, but we’ve always tried to push on. For this one it felt like we definitely shoved off from the shore.”\n\n“If you’ve seen one cathedral I then baby you’ve seen ‘em all” I I asked her what they were like I she told me they were tall I she said “if there’s a god and he’s a heard one prayer I then baby, he’s heard ‘em all”- “Except Death”\n\nThose familiar with the decades-spanning oeuvre of Bob Mould—from his pioneering early ’80s work with Hüsker Dü to his solo work in singer-songwriter, electronic, and rock modes, to the deafening pop sparkle of Sugar—might expect a new album bearing the title Silver Age to be a somber and reflective set in the mode of his last album, 2009’s Life and Times…and they’d be way off the mark.\n\nSilver Age is an intense and concise ten song blast far more reminiscent of Bob’s latter-\n\nday Hüsker Dü output—first marked by the monumental sprawl of 1984’s Zen Arcade which then gave way to the short, sharp pop focus of 1985’s New Day Rising—and his early ’90s tenure with Sugar, whose classic debut Copper Blue marks its 20th anniversary this year. That said, Silver Age is no nostalgia trip. Aside from lyrical content that shows Bob as in-the-now as ever, Silver Age came together quickly and organically in the wake of a series of electric solo dates in 2011 supporting Foo Fighters (where he guested each night on “Dear Rosemary,” the track from the Foos’ Wasting Light on which Bob shares writing and vocal duties) as well as a solo acoustic/book tour around last summer’s publication of See a Little Light: The Trail of Rage and Melody, the autobiography Bob co-authored with Michael Azerrad (Come as You Are, Our Band Could Be Your Life). These events culminated in a tribute last November at Los Angeles’ Disney Hall that featured the likes of Dave Grohl, Ryan Adams, Spoon’s Britt Daniel, and Craig Finn and Tad Kubler of The Hold Steady celebrating the width and breadth of Bob’s body of work.\n\n“I’d been batting around the idea of another aggressive pop record for some time,” Bob says, “especially as the 20th anniversary of Copper Blue kept getting closer. But it was really the shows with Foo Fighters that got me thinking when I started writing for this record: Did I just write a Sugar song? Or a Foo Fighters song? Or one of my own songs? And does it really matter? Once I got that out of the way, it freed me up to have some fun and set about making a simple rock record.”\n\nIt’s no surprise, then, that Silver Age careens out of the speakers with a sense of exhilaration that reflects the excitement with which Bob and his live band of bassist Jason Narducy (Spl:t S:ngle, Verbow) and drummer Jon Wurster (Superchunk, the Mountain Goats) cranked out the record in a tight whirlwind of a window from in early 2012. But that’s not to say that Silver\n\nAge is a lighthearted romp—as ever, there’s plenty of dark matter at the center of these sweet melodic nuggets. First single “The Descent,” for example, is one of those perfect moments that lands firmly in the Mould wheelhouse, with walls of luminescent guitars, phantom choruses, and infectious hooks all leading toward the concluding refrain of “My world, it is descending.” The opening one-two of “Star Machine” and “Silver Age,” on the other hand, pairs abrasive riffs with equally harsh meditations on fame, immaturity, and the lessons and consequences thereof. Other Silver Age highlights include the bittersweet romantic epic “Round the City Square” (“It feels like people always look to my songs to help define their own failed\n\nrelationships,” Bob laughs); the upbeat and earnest celebration of “First Time Joy”; and the unabashedly literal “Keep Believing,” a rousing love letter to the records that shaped Bob’s personal and professional life. Listen closely and see how many of the references you can pinpoint:\n\nBring me thoughts and words, pass me the revolver I can see for miles, and everything’s in color\n\nRock and roll all night until I feel the thunder\n\nI got a handle on some complicated fun\n\nWe’re all sniffing glue, pleasures so unknown\n\nA circle drawn in blue, the murmur baritone\n\nPicnic on a Pedro lawn, heaven took that monkey song\n\nNever mind the battle won, could you be the loveless one?\n\n“I don’t know if there’s an arc to this record,” Bob says. “But if I had to boil it down to one core idea, it would be: I love music. I love my life. I love what I do for a living. It’s right there on the lyric sheet; it references itself, really. More than any other record I’ve made, this one gives a real glimpse into how much making music means to me as a means of expression, as well as what music means to me as a fan.”\n\nAnd so has it always been the case for Bob Mould, the music he’s created defining every phase of his life, both cataloging memories and propelling him ever forward: Hüsker Dü’s formation in 1979 and the hardcore anthems, tight, melodic, hard-pop chestnuts, and sprawling double-vinyl conceptual opuses it churned out in equal measure up to its dramatic 1987 flameout; Bob’s solo works ranging from his landmark 1989 debut Workbook to Black Sheets of Rain (1990), Body of Song (2005), District Line (2008), and Life and Times (2009); his forays into electronic music, including 2002’s Modulate and his Blowoff collaboration with Richard Morel; and of course, the soon-to-be-reissued body of work that Sugar packed into its brief existence, featuring the 1992 debut Copper Blue which Bob and his band have been playing front to back at recent live shows. It seems to be Bob’s summations and reflections on these major creative periods of his life and career that open up new wellsprings while coming to terms with the old works—a natural process that has produced winning results yet again in the form of Silver Age.\n\n“It’s no coincidence that this record came at this point,” Bob says. “In 1991, closing the door on a run of all-acoustic shows led right into the beginning of Sugar and Copper Blue. So you could state a case that the solo shows accompanying the book readings through 2011—plus the Disney Hall show and knowing the 20th anniversary of Copper Blue was right around the corner—wrapping that all up led me right into Silver Age. I’m well aware that there’s no way to get into a time machine and go back to being the person I was 20 years ago, but it is nice to get three musicians in the studio together and get back inside that three-minute pop song structure again.”\n\nNot a lot goes down in Casco, Maine. In the winter months, this sequestered hamlet around 30 miles from Portland in the North Easternmost tip of the United States acquires a Siberian stillness as suffocating snow descends and carpets this eerily remote and reclusive region.\n\nYet it was to a forest just outside Casco that The Joy Formidable singer/guitarist Ritzy Bryan and bassist Rhydian Dafydd retired at the start of 2012 to dream up their magnificent second album, Wolf’s Law, a record that teems with imagination, yearning and a Carpe Diem restlessness.\n\n“It was just the two of us in this isolated spot where we hardly saw anybody else all the time we were there,” says Ritzy. “It snowed every day and the surroundings and the solitude gave us a different level of intensity.\n\n“We had no phone signal, no wi-fi – it was fucking bliss! It is Stephen King country up there and we worried that we’d turn into The Shining and cave each other’s heads in. But it was very still, very beautiful – and in a strange way it reminded us of our home area of North Wales.”\n\nWolf’s Law is a driven, hugely emotive record, an alluring and attitudinal follow-up to The Joy Formidable’s keenly received 2011 debut, The Big Roar. It’s an album that was recorded in very different circumstances to its predecessor, both geographically and emotionally.\n\n“We had a very difficult period in our personal lives making The Big Roar,” says Rhydian. “Ritzy’s parents were going through a very painful, long-drawn-out divorce and also we lost both close friends and family. We made it in very tight, enclosed studio spaces and it made it a very frustrated and aggressive record.\n\n“With Wolf’s Law, some of the difficult personal circumstances have been resolved, so while there is still aggression there, the record is a lot more harmonious and focussed. It helped that we were completely lost in nature in Maine because it is really an album about reconnecting – with yourself, with nature and with spirituality.”\n\nSuch heavyweight and profound themes run through Wolf’s Law like a pulse. The album’s audacious reach and ambition is clear in the extraordinary film that The Joy Formidable commissioned for its title track: a breathtaking sequence of monochrome images of birth, death and the natural world.\n\n“That track (Wolf’s Law) was always meant as an art piece, we wanted to make a visual that introduced the mood of the record. It’s a song about encouragement, reawakening hope and knowing that time is precious,” says Ritzy. “It’s very aware of its own mortality and how fleeting a moment can be.”\n\n“It encapsulates the themes of the album,” agrees Rhydian. “It’s about how beautiful and cruel life can be and how it’s always moving, and also about seizing the moment, because life is short.”\n\nIt’s evident that the stark serenity of snowbound Casco impacted on the marrow of Wolf’s Law. Themes of the raw beauty and majesty of nature are laced throughout the album. The buzzsaw, ragged yet beautifully melodic Cholla was inspired by the giant cacti of the Joshua Tree National Park, yet also details familial breakdowns; The Leopard and the Lung was written in honour of a doughty environmentalist campaigner.\n\n“It’s about a true hero – a Kenyan female activist, Wangari Maathai who fought against an entire corrupt establishment for nature and for women’s rights,” says Ritzy. “She was so fucking brave! Her name,Wangari, means leopard in Kukuru. She told Kenyan women to plant trees because she said that trees are the lungs of the earth.”\n\nYet not all of the audacious, propulsive Wolf’s Law is about such extraneous matters. Although Ritzy and Rhydian have been a couple since before the making of The Big Roar, they have never previously referenced their relationship in song. On the taut Tendons, a shimmering rock reverie powered by the martial beat of Joy Formidable drummer Matt Thomas, they courageously affix their hearts firmly to their sleeves.\n\n“Rhydian and I were making music together before we became a couple, so we have never experienced our relationship outside of the bubble of this band,” muses Ritzy. “It can be a difficult dynamic to maintain and it sometimes makes me wonder – is our relationship based on the chaos of this band and our music, and if that were to change, where would it leave us?”\n\n“The tendons reference is because we’re so inextricably linked,” adds Rhydian. “This band and music join us so closely together; we’re soul mates, but could it destroy us as well?”\n\nPrecarious relationships. Confessionals. Catharsis. The call of the wild. Life, birth, death and all points in-between. With such vast, profound and heartfelt themes, wrapped up in some of the most visceral and voluptuous art-rock-and-roll that has exploded since the halcyon days of the Pixies, it’s no surprise that a lot of people expect Wolf’s Law to be The Joy Formidable’s quantum-leap breakthrough album, a springboard to arena-filling status, this fiercely driven band’s tipping point into rock’s A-League.\n\nAre they ready for this? Is it even what they want?\n\n“If we can keep our artistic integrity,” says Ritzy, “and carry on writing songs that are important to us, and keep the thrill and the excitement of doing what we do, and carry on moving forward and evolving, and still manage to connect with an arena full of people – fuck it, that would be fantastic! But it’s not the reason why we do what we do. We won’t change to get there.”\n\n“That’s true,” agrees Rhydian. “The point is to reach as many people as possible – but for all the right reasons.”\n\nTheir charming reticence may soon become immaterial. The Joy Formidable have made an album so colossal, so compelling that it may even put Casco, Maine on the map. If there is any justice in the world, 2013 will be the Year of the Wolf.\n\nIf the details seem scarce, it’s because that’s how Tobacco likes to keep them. Hailing from an unspecified burg in rural Pennsylvania, somewhere north of Pittsburgh, he has successfully made a name for himself even as he’s avoided acknowledging that name’s legal counterpart. As both the frontman of Black Moth Super Rainbow and the sole creative engine behind Tobacco, he’s earned the eager ears and prying eyes of doggedly loyal fans and smitten critics alike, a kindness he’s repaid by granting few interviews, obscuring his face in photos, and seeming wholly uninterested in the subject of his own identity. Such things just get in the way of the music after all, so if it’s easier, you might think of Tobacco as music’s one-man genre made of equal parts analog crunch, earthy psychedelia, fuzzed-up hip-hop, and outside pop. All the same, here’s what’s known.\n\nTobacco has a sister. He grew up in a decent neighborhood. He was nearly strong-armed into elementary school band after an aptitude test suggested he play an instrument. He hated the idea, so he didn’t do it. He didn’t like music at all, in fact, until he discovered MTV, and hence, the Beasties’ “So Whatcha Want” video one long summer bridging the middle of middle school. The first concert he attended was Butthole Surfers, and it’s still his favorite. His favorite record of all time is Beck’s Mellow Gold. Sticking to his childhood guns, he typically doesn’t like music released earlier than the late ‘80s. As for high school, Tobacco could have done without the classes. An extracurricular interest in freestyle BMX flatland was soon replaced by a growing zeal for music, even though his first band, called Wood, didn’t employ any instruments to its cause (its two main ingredients were flyers and hype). Acquiring a guitar and a four-track opened up new doors, to the purplish noise and busted ghetto-blaster tracks that now populate The Allegheny White Fish Tapes, which Tobacco self-released in 2009. This was before the gritty analog synths, the murky vocoder-ing, and the hypnotic aural crush that came with founding Black Moth Super Rainbow. Tobacco rounded up the group’s members before graduation, and until last year’s Dave Fridmann-produced collaborative affair, Eating Us, roughly treated BMSR as a solo project, penning three albums‚ and several EPs‚ worth of sludgy pagan pop for his cohorts to realize live. He designed BMSR’s album art as well, which occasionally involved scratch-n-sniff elements or hair.\n\nBut Tobacco would come to crave a more pure musical identity, one steeped in guttural sounds that hit harder and flashed brighter. This fixation reared its ugly head as 2008’s beat-oriented Fucked Up Friends, Tobacco’s official debut. Two years later, the man is back and beastlier than ever with Maniac Meat, a record designed to bully his previous works into a corner, gut them, and leave ‘em for dead. This is a good time to mention that Tobacco believes he is making pop music.\n\n* NIKE PRESENTS\n\nKnown internationally as a curator amongst the world’s most cutting edge DJs, producers, and musical movements Wesley Pentz (better known as DIPLO) has experienced a variety of successes. The last few years have been spent running through the club circuit and having chart-topping hits with refreshing irreverence. Born in Tupelo, Mississippi, in 1978, Pentz spent most his childhood in Florida working in his fathers bait shop and being turned onto music thru then new mediums like MTV. Drifting North thru the state came Miami Bass and from the West came the sounds of Southern Hip Hop artists. The musical influence and variety coalesced and at 18 Pentz moved to Philadelphia for college at Temple University to study Film & Music. While a student he took a job in the South Philadephia community as a social worker and created the influential Hollertronix club night, which was the beginning of his fledgling career as DIPLO.\n\nIn 2004 Pentz released his debut album as Diplo called, Florida. It received praise and accolades in the underground community. The music embodied on this album led to an introduction via an A&R man at XL Records to M.I.A. In 2004 he partnered with M.I.A. for the mixtape Piracy Funds Terrorism. Pentz’s cultural impact had started to snowball. Together they worked on her first album Arular and much of her second Kala, including the 2008 mega-hit “Paper Planes,” which reached No. 3 in the US Charts and earned him a Grammy nomination for Record of the Year. His production credits have evolved since to include Santigold, Lil’ Jon and Missy Elliot, while remixing works by Beck, Radiohead, Britney Spears and countless others. In 2009 Pentz teamed with frequent collaborator Dave Taylor (aka Switch) to release the futuristic dancehall album Guns Don’t Kill People… Lazers Do under the guise of Major Lazer, a Jamaican militant at war with an evil army of zombies, mummies and vampires.\n\nMeanwhile, his record label Mad Decent has helped to introduce Brazilian baile funk, Angolan Kuduro and other marginalized music to clubs around the world, developing as a trendsetting force with which to be reckoned. With the same mission in mind, some of the varied acts Pentz has signed or produced include Rye Rye, Bonde do Role, Crookers, Blaqstarr, Boy 8-Bit, Buraka Som Systema, and Rusko, allowing Mad Decent to act as a launching pad or home base for many others while spreading its influence across the globe. Through the label, Pentz has founded a charity called Heaps Decent as a social relief program to help children in Australia as well as with additional efforts internationally. In early 2009 Pentz debuted his film Favela on Blast, a five-years-in-the-making documentary exploring the Brazilian slum favelas of Rio de Janeiro and the thriving baile funk music scene that exists within. He is currently developing a TV show to air in 2010.\n\nThrough a widespread assortment of releases and artists’ works – from cumbia to dubstep to punk and beyond – Diplo has shown dynamic range with interests that span far beyond any singular culture or musical realm, standing as a working model for the truly 21st Century artist.\n\nI never felt American until I left the United States. In 2007 I went to Europe for the first time to tour in support of Spiderman of the Rings. At the time I, like many other young Americans, didn’t identify as “American.” The United States was an evil, Earth-destroying monster of war, corporate greed and bigotry. I had been touring for years in the DIY scene, trying to live apart from consumer culture, feeling detached from what I thought of as the American lifestyle. But when I left for Europe, I was slammed into reality. Never before had I felt so much like an outsider. I was alone in foreign lands with no friends. While it was a beautiful experience and a great tour, I realized that no matter which subculture I chose to identify or what kind of lifestyle I led I would always be American. Nothing could ever change that. As simple as that idea seems, it was a massive shift in consciousness for me.\n\nWhen I was writing Bromst, I wanted a title with no pre-existing meaning, something free of any prior associations. For this album, I wanted the exact opposite. America is a word with an infinite range of connotations, both positive and negative. Even its literal definition is open to discussion. In using it as the title of the album, in a small way, I‘m contributing to the discussion. To me, the underground DIY and wilderness are just as American as their evil brethren, corporatism and environmental destruction. It‘s that juxtaposition of fundamentally opposed ideologies that makes up the American landscape.\n\nCompositionally, America is layering of dichotomies: light and dark, acoustic and synthetic, celebration and contemplation. The result can be heard as simple or complex depending on how one listens to it. The music is rooted in triadic harmony set to a fixed pulse while the individual lines are complex, phasing layers of sound. The outcomes are dense asymmetrically rhythmic phrases of textured patterns framed as pop songs.\n\nThe inspiration for the music was my love of cross-country travel, seeing the landscapes of the United States, going from east to west and back again over the course of seasons. The lyrics are inspired by my frustration, fear and anger towards the country and world I live in and am a part of. As I came closer to finishing the album these themes began to show themselves more frequently and greater clarity. There seemed no better world to encapsulate both inspirations than the simple beauty found in the word America.\n\n-Dan Deacon\n\nI am Phil Elverum. Here is my brief autobiography for journalists and fact seekers:\n\nI am 34 years old. I am from the town of Anacortes, Washington. Since 1997 my primary life’s work has been making studio-based music, first under the name “the Microphones” (1997 – 2002) and then “Mount Eerie” (2003 – present). In addition to this I have played in other bands (D+, Old Time Relijun), produced other peoples’ recordings and dabbled in painting, writing, and photography.\n\nAside from 5 years in Olympia, Wash. and a long winter in northern Norway (2002/2003), I have lived most of my life in Anacortes and much of the content of my music and other art is tied to the place. My music project Mount Eerie is named after the actual mountain, Mt. Erie, that lies just south of town. I try to make music that feels associated with this particular place in some way, whether it’s literally described in words or just an ambiguous feeling.\n\nThe “Microphones era” in Olympia (1997-2002) was very prolific, with 5 major albums (and many smaller things) being released by the K label. The most critically acclaimed was “the Glow pt. 2” (2001). Following that was an album called “Mount Eerie” by the Microphones.\n\nI did not feel totally satisfied artistically with my exploration of the “Mount Eerie” idea on the album of that name so in 2003 I changed the name of my whole project to Mount Eerie. I did this partly to explore the idea more deeply and partly because the name had become more relevant to my songs than “the Microphones”, not to mention the appeal of being conceptually rooted to an actual place.\n\nIn 2004 I started releasing my own projects via the “P.W. Elverum & Sun, ltd.” company in an attempt to become even more self-sufficient and also to be able to explore unusual packaging ideas. The first major release was “No Flashlight” by Mount Eerie (2005) which came wrapped in a gargantuan poster. Since then I have released many fancy LPs and an extravagant art book of photography. I continue to explore new ideas for mass producing art and music in a homemade style. P.W. Elverum & Sun remains primarily a vehicle for my own projects only, not a real record label. Deeper simple self-sufficiency seems to be a good way to weather the tumultuous times we live in.\n\nHere’s what the journalist Brandon Stosuy said to describe what my stuff is actually about (inthe Believer):\n\n“Regardless of the moniker, the various collections include interlocking themes, references to earlier works, and are marked by Elverum’s distinctive naturalist self-recorded lo-fi analog sound that mixes a whispered, gentle voice, which can also yell and bellow, with various strains of sound: His work can be delicately spare or booming and ambitiously layered and noisy, often in the same song. Lyrically, he focuses on memory, first-person storytelling, myth, naturalism, the everyday as sacred, and a sense of place (in and out of Washington State), among other related things.”\n\nHere’s another nice blurb (from Jeff Manson writing in the Bolinas Hearsay News):\n\n“Mt. Eerie is the current incarnation of enigmatic sound wizard, nature philosopher, neo-beat, radical feminist, Pacific Northwest Shredder/legend Phil Elverum. I first became aware of his music in the late 90s in Santa Cruz when he came through town regularly performing in basements and on the beach in/as his old band name “the Microphones”. For the past 10 plus years I’ve witnessed Phil crank out an amazing body of work, from self-recorded albums, to photo-books, to goofy comics. He makes consistently mesmerizing bold work outside any particular genre and does so with an unaffected sense of humor that is rare in most artists.”\n\n* OPB MUSIC PRESENTS\n\nBehold the amazing, yet true, story of the third Titus Andronicus LP, LOCAL BUSINESS.\n\nIt begins with a plan of action. While the first two LPs were elaborate concoctions, requiring the contributions of 30+ musicians, the most advanced computer wizardry and transmissions from an alternate universe, LOCAL BUSINESS would be of the earth, the handiwork of a living and breathing entity. No more would Titus Andronicus the studious recording project and Titus Andronicus the raucous touring machine be two distinct beings; there would only be Titus Andronicus, rock and roll band.\n\nAt the center of the band remained, as ever, singer-songwriter Patrick Stickles. Flanking him was the dynamic duo of Eric Harm on drums and Julian Veronesi on bass, rhythm section and principal backup singers. Returning to the fold was recent college graduate Liam Betson on guitar, whose studies kept him off the road but not away from the recording of the first two LPs. Rounding out the band was the latest addition, guitarist extraordinaire, and founder of Brooklyn DIY haven Shea Stadium, Adam Reich, moving gracefully from the position of live sound engineer to band member following the abrupt departure of keyboardist David Robbins.\n\nWith an album’s worth of new songs in their pocket, Titus Andronicus took to the road in March of 2012, hashing out their new material night after night on tour, throughout the eastern United States and at the SXSW music conference. It would be the energy of the stage that they would strive to recreate in the studio.\n\nThe studio in question was New Paltz, NY’s Marcata Recording, domain of master producer and engineer Kevin McMahon, whose credits include the first two Titus Andronicus LPs. Beginning on April 1st, the rare confluence of Palm Sunday and April Fool’s Day, the converted barn became the band’s home for the next two months. The first phase of recording found the band amassing hundreds of performances, playing together without headphones, three guitars strong, day in and day out, striving in pursuit of “the perfect take.” A lengthy selection process followed, where the takes deemed most worthy of preserving for the ages were chosen. On top of these were placed much singing, still more guitars, and the contributions of an elite group of special guests – longtime Titus session keyboardist Elio DeLuca, famed violinist and string arranger to the stars Owen Pallett, and Eric’s father, Steven Harm, blowing on a harmonica. This tight-knit group is just one of the meanings behind the phrase LOCALBUSINESS. By the end of June, Kevin McMahon completed the mixing, and the mastering of the world famous Greg Calbi at Sterling Sound capped off the whole process.\n\nBut what of the songs themselves? While abandoning the linear narrative of The Monitor, the songs of LOCAL BUSINESS aim to make explicit the implications of the first two LPs, that the inherent meaninglessness of life in an absurd universe gives the individual power to create their own values and their own morality. This individual is celebrated throughout LOCAL BUSINESS’s ten songs, though surrounded by a world that pressures endlessly to consume and to conform. The title LOCAL BUSINESS speaks to this anti-consumerist agenda, but fear not; the contradiction of the LP as a consumer product speaking against consumerism will be discussed at length therein. LOCAL BUSINESSshould also indicate an interest in contemporary affairs, moving away from the historical content of The Monitor. Along the way, we witness a devastating automobile wreck, a food fight (that is to say, a battle with an eating disorder), an electrocution, a descent into insanity, and ultimately, a forgiveness of the self for its many faults. Titus Andronicus even finds time to broaden its emotional palette to include moments of pure positivity, brief respites from the usual doom and gloom.\n\nLOCAL BUSINESS will be released on October 22nd, 2012. The release will be followed by a tour of the United States, which too shall be unique in the history of Titus Andronicus, as the band taking the stage every night will be the same band which made the record being promoted. So shall the story be complete, from tour to studio to tour again, the same band of brothers executing a singular vision. Five men, ten songs, no bullshit.LOCAL BUSINESS.\n\nThere’s something to be said about cohesiveness in music, most especially in this day and age where the art form of an album that provides the listener with an experience from start to finish is more and more becoming an antiquated concept. Evan Thomas Weiss (aka Into It. Over It.) however, who at 26 years and with his debut full length album “Proper,” has attained a level of depth in his songwriting not seen by most artists throughout their entire careers.\n\nHaving written, recorded and played with an eclectic pedigree of artists such as Up Up Down Down Left Right Left Right B A Start, The Progress, Stay Ahead of the Weather and Damiera, IIOI’s culmination of experiences with said bands have stylistically fused together for the grand effort that is Weiss’ debut LP. The album’s release will mark a four year commemoration of his 52 Weeks project (where from September 2007 to September 2008 he wrote and recorded one track each week for a year, making them available online before being approached by No Sleep Records who released them as a 2xCD in June of 2009), as well as his Twelve Towns 7″ series/collection which featured recordings with artists such as Bob Nanna (Braid / Hey Mercedes), CSTVT, Everyone Everywhere, Pswingset, Empire! Empire!, and Such Gold, recently compiled for release on Topshelf Records. The new album also follows Weiss’ 2010 split release with friend Andrew “KOJI” Shiraki, named one of the year’s best overlooked releases by The Associated Press.\n\nThe lyrical concepts of “Proper” and it’s all around aura stems from autobiographical and literal exemplifications which have taken place over the past year of Weiss’ life, most of which occurring in Chicago where he now resides. The album culminates in a heady yet straightforward melodic stew resembling Sunny Day Real Estate, Death Cab For Cutie and Dismemberment Plan to name a few, along with impassioned songwriting executed with the potency and ardor of Chuck Regan and Colin Meloy . While not labeled as a concept album per se, the stories which form the basis of Into It. Over It.’s songs stem from Weiss’ own personal experiences, but are still relatable by one theme and one theme only: Life.\n\n“Proper” was recorded at Blacklodge Studios in Eudora, KS and co-produced by Ed Rose. The album features contributions from Nick Wakim of Stay Ahead of the Weather/CSTVT on drums and Nathan Ellis of The Casket Lottery. Album art was photographed at Weiss’ apartment in Chicago by Ryan Russell. There will be alternate layouts for the CD/LP and a tour with Frank Turner will follow in the fall.\n\n* OPB MUSIC PRESENTS\n\nIf punk taught us anything—and it might have been just this one thing—it’s that loud, aggressive music can provide the sweetest release. Shouting out can clear your psyche of problems ranging from a copy-shop co-worker who won’t do his part to the realization that you, along with all your friends and loved ones, are hopelessly impermanent. It’s a fantastic tonic for a wide spectrum of ailments, like aspirin. Where do you hurt? Sing this—you’ll feel better.\n\nSuperchunk has offered up that sonic salve off and on for two decades, at various volumes. Like most great bands that started loud, they also explored the quiet, beginning the 1990s with a self-titled debut (which housed “Slack Motherfucker”) and ending them with Come Pick Me Up, a stately set that incorporated strings and horns. 2001 saw the even gentler Here’s to Shutting Up, but the rest of the aughts saw so little activity that the end seemed nigh.\n\nAnd then Mac, Laura, Jon, and Jim decided to shout it out again: 2010’s Majesty Shredding is perfectly described by its own title—it’s a celebratory set of whoa-whoa-whoas from a group so thrilled by making music together again that they can’t contain themselves. It’s unsubtle in the best possible ways.\n\nI Hate Music, which you’re hopefully listening to right this minute because you couldn’t wait to put it on, is Majesty’s dark twin. It’s similarly aggressive—often moreso—and every bit as energetic. It reflects the joys of a life spent immersed in music (“Me & You & Jackie Mittoo,” “Your Theme”), but there’s a dark undercurrent as well. That title isn’t tongue-in-cheek, but it’s really more a question than a statement: When you’re 20, lazy co-workers and romantic missteps number among your biggest worries; two decades later, life’s bigger questions knock louder and louder, demanding answers.\n\n“Low F” finds Superchunk in classic mode—both classic Superchunk and a dash of classic rock: The rhythm section drops out for big choruses, and a guitar solo brings pure sunshine. “Trees of Barcelona” is similarly joyous; it’s “so happy, so happy to go with that flow.”\n\nTo borrow a phrase, I Hate Music rages against the dying of the light, and refuses to go gentle into that good night. The people and times that he’s missing haunt Mac’s lyrics this time out in ways both gorgeously sentimental (“You’re not around / but you’re still the window we are looking out”) and angrily cathartic (“All I see is a void”). “Your Theme” longs for someone and somewhere that he will never know again. (The original definition of “nostalgia,” as you may know, was “severe homesickness,” and it was treated like a disease. It applies here.)\n\nBut in the end, I Hate Music sounds to me like an album about love more than anything else: love of life, love of living, love of people, and yeah, love of music. It defies its own title so completely and diligently that it never even seems like a fair fight: There’s no pain this deep or yearning this severe without the type of love earned over a lifetime. “I hate music – what is it worth? / Can’t bring anyone back to this earth” goes the first line in “Me & You & Jackie Mittoo.” That song and its ten companions can’t relive the past or resurrect those lost, but they can keep them close enough to see and hear and celebrate. It’s dark in here, but if we conjure the right words and sounds, we’ll find our way out.\n\nLife has its share of ups and downs and no one knows that better than Saves The Day frontman Chris Conley. For the past seventeen years Conley has been bearing his soul and reinventing his musical identity with each successive step, a process that is clearly culminating with Saves The Day’s seventh full-length Daybreak. The third part of a trilogy that also includes 2006’s Sound The Alarm and 2007’s Under The Boards, the act’s latest disc sees Conley moving past the anger and frustration that has defined the band’s last two albums and rediscovering a sense of wonder with the world that he can’t wait to share with his listeners.\n\nDaybreak is also the first Saves The Day album to feature guitarist Arun Bali, bassist Rodrigo Palma and drummer Spencer Peterson (the latter of whom was replaced by Claudio Rivera shortly after the album was completed) and Conley insists that his band’s participation and encouragement was integral to the final product. “This album wouldn’t have been as good as it is now if we had put it out two years ago and I think the reason for that is because there’s a renewed energy in the band with this new line-up,” Conley explains, adding that many of these songs were initially recorded in 2009 with the band’s previous line-up but never felt right to him. “I feel like I have a united group for the first time ever and that feels like a gift.”\n\nThat transformed spirit is evident in every note of Daybreak (which was co-produced by the band and longtime collaborator Marc Hudson) from the ten-minute long, five-movement self-titled opener to instantly infectious pop gems like “Let It Go” and “Living Without Love.” That said, Daybreak also sees the band stretching out musically on the middle-eastern-inflected “Chameleon” and incorporating full-fledged guitar solos on “Deranged & Desperate.” “This album is so much more musical [then the past two albums] because my heart was coming back to life while I was writing this and I was starting to be okay with myself,” Conley explains. “In a way I was in the same mindset that I was in when I wrote [2003’s major-label debut] In Reverie. I felt like I was on cloud nine.”\n\nConley’s positive outlook took a dejected turn shortly after In Reverie’s touring cycle ended, due to both external and internal pressures—and the making of this trilogy is as much an artistic statement as it is a chronicle of Conley’s own cathartic journey from the depths of his own insecurity into accepting himself and the world for what they are. “I was so angry when I wrote Sound The Alarm and then I was looking back on all these situations with Under The Boards,” Conley explains, adding that a major turning point in his outlook was catalyzed by the recent birth of his daughter. “I didn’t want her to face the world the way I faced the world which was fighting, kicking and screaming so I decided I was going to bring myself back to life with this album.”\n\nThis therapeutic journey is evident on every song on Daybreak, mostly literally on tracks like “1984,” which starts with the Under The Boards-esque statement “I’m dead inside and dying every day,” but quickly resolves into “I need your love/I’m trying to rise above/I need you to bring me back to life,” during the song’s chorus. “I recognize what happened to me and now that I lived through it I can look back on it which is why I think the music breathes more on this album,” he explains. “The songs feel more expansive because there wasn’t the anger or confusion that dominated the first two albums in the trilogy,” he continues. “Daybreak feels like a huge sigh of relief to me.”\n\nConley is also quick to point out that despite its serious subject matter and introspective nature, he actually had a good time making Daybreak. “Trying to tie all of those strange themes and currents and raw emotions from Sound The Alarm and Under The Boards was an absolute a blast,” he says. “I had a huge chart where I listed all of the lyrics I had compiled for this album as well as the past two and I was drawing lines from one song to another; writing Daybreak was like trying to finish a screen play because I had to take all of these themes that just flowed out of me and through organizing this thoughts I was also able to make sense of my life.”\n\nThe word Conley says most while describing Daybreak is “acceptance”—and whether you’ve followed his music since Saves The Day’s hardcore-inflected ‘90s output or are a recent convert to the band, y"
