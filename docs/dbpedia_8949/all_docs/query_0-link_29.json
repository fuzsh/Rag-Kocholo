        "text": "Why study industrial crafts?\n\nIn the UK and Europe, and in parts of the USA, the notion of Industrial Heritage has a key place in cultural and social history, and the teaching of such. Much of this work, for obvious reasons, has focused on the history of invention, and the history of economic development, and has drawn on textual historical records, the built environment, and archeological remains. This has tended to fall into the conventional âhistory of great menâ mode that has been roundly critiqued from feminist, post colonialist and labor perspectives. What is less well examined and less celebrated is the of experience of workers, and their special skills (the exception being in âworking museumsâ). Such skills, owned by workers, were seldom documented (seen as unimportant) and are inherently difficult to document (cf: Tacit knowledge, Polanyi). But without these skills, usually passed on on-the-job (sit by Nellie) the entirety of industrial production could not occur. Embodied cognition is therefore an evanescent but key component of industrial history. As deindustrialization transforms workplaces and the last surviving practitioners of many of these skills are passing, there is an urgency in capturing this knowledge, in order to create a more complete representation of the history of the period and in order to communicate the embodied qualities of such skills. ICRN proposes interdisciplinary study of skilled practices in this domain. We see this as adding a new dimension to the study of and of history of the industrial period its presentation. In doing so, it also provides understanding these matters as they have unfolded during the 20th century, which is important to understanding the present, but also will help generate insight and raise questions about more distant pasts.\n\nIndustrial Crafts Research Network - Symposium 1. Developing methodologies for documenting, understanding and communicating skilled practices of industrial environments. Sponsored jointly by UCI, UMass Amherst and Nottingham Trent University. Nov12-14 2021, online.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe primary goal of this paper is to attempt to understand the skills of machine tool use â specifically automated manufacturing machines of the C19th â as craft practices. These practices employed externally powered and automated tools and around them new cultures of practice emerged. We draw upon situated/embodied/enactive/extended/distributed (SEEED) approaches to cognition as a way of explicating the sensibilities of these practices, as well as history of science and technology, Anthropology, STS (Science and Technology Studies) and related fields. Based on this approach, we then apply the understandings gained through application of SEEED approaches to advance some design ideas for developing museum exhibits that provide an understanding of the know-how, the kinesthetic/proprioceptive skills and procedures - inherent in these crafts/trades. This design agenda addresses the challenge that this âknowingâ and âunderstandingâ presents to students of these crafts and to museums, and the benefit that might accrue to their visitors if this craft knowledge were more accessible. We take as a case study a body of work that has focused on embodied/ embedded knowledge in the textile industry â specifically in the making of machine lace. It concludes with a proposition for a multimedia approach to give museum visitors hands-on access to complex machines and techniques. The authors are both long term practitioners of crafts, both traditional and industrial (see biogs). This experience informs the research at every step.\n\nThis is a draft version of a paper to be given at BICCS2020 (postponed till 2021)\n\nRead more\n\nThe ICRN: Who We Are & What We Do\n\nSimon Penny, Emily Whitted, Tom Fisher, Marla Miller\n\nSimon Penny is an artist, teacher and theorist with a longstanding focus on emerging technologies and on embodied and situated aspects of artistic practice. Penny has built interactive installations and robotic art since the mid 1980s. His longstanding concern for embodied and situated aspects of aesthetic experience, along with a critical analysis of computer culture, has led to a focus on what of he refers to as postcogntivist approaches to cognition - the focus of his book Making Sense: Cognition, Computing, Art and Embodiment (MIT press 2017). He was director of A Body of Knowledge: Embodied Cognition and the Arts conference UCI 2016, and An Ocean of Knowledge: Pacific Seafaring, Sustainability and Cultural Survival at UCI in 2017. As Professor of Art and Robotics at Carnegie Mellon (1993-2000) he developed VR and robotics projects. He then went on to found the Arts Computation Engineering (ACE) graduate program at the University of California Irvine, 2001-2012. He was Labex International Professor, University Paris8 and ENSAD in 2014. He was visiting professor in media theory, Cognitive Systems and Interactive Media masters, University Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, 2006-2013. Penny is currently professor of Electronic Art and Design (Dept of Art) at University of California, Irvine, with appointments in the dept of Music and in Informatics (School of Information and Computer Science).\n\nEmily Whitted is a history doctoral student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst studying the intersections of skill, labor, and early American material culture. A recent graduate of the Winterthur Program in American Material Culture at the University of Delaware, her MA thesis, âMade in Germantown: Production, Wear, and Repair of American Frame-Knit Stockings 1683-1830,â examines the embodied knowledge of early American frame knitters through material evidence of the machines they operated, archival documentation, and experimental archaeology. Her dissertation research focuses on textile repair in early America, and she is also pursuing a public history certificate with a concentration in museum studies.\n\nTom Fisher is a gardener, craftsperson, musician and academic. Professor in the School of Art and Design at Nottingham Trent University since 2007, he has worked in art schools since 1985 and made his living as a furniture designer/maker before his first university appointment. He is now developing a business custom-making French horns. His academic interests derive directly from this â prominent themes include materials in everyday consumption (the subject of his 2004 PhD from the Sociology Department at the University of York) and the acquisition of skill in material practices, informed by theories of cognition. His research has produced a book on the everyday re-use of packaging, (Designing for Re-Use, Earthscan, 2009), a recent special issue of the Journal of Design History on the meaning of materialsâ surface qualities, a special issue of Critical Studies of Fashion and Beauty on fashion and materiality, a 2017 book for Gower, Design for Personalisation, and an edited collection of essays on design and ethics for Bloomsbury in 2019. He has led funded research on sustainable clothing (Defra), and industrial heritage (AHRC). His current work is focusing on embodied knowledge; the ethics of design and technologies; design, culture and innovation.\n\nMarla Miller's primary research interest is U.S. women's work before industrialization. Her bookâ¯The Needle's Eye: Women and Work in the Age of Revolutionâ¯(University of Massachusetts Press, 2006) won the Costume Society of America's Millia Davenport prize; Betsy Ross and the Making of Americaâ¯ (Holt, 2010)--a scholarly biography of that much-misunderstood early American craftswoman -- was a finalist for the Cundill Prize in History, and was named to the Washington Post's \"Best of 2010\" list. In 2019 she completed a microhistory of women and work in 18th-century New England titled Entangled Lives: Labor, Livelihood, and Landscapes of Change in Rural Massachusetts (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2019). A public historian and public history educator, Professor Miller teaches courses in Public History, American Material Culture, Museum and Historic Site Interpretation, and History Communication, and consults with a wide variety of museums and historic sites. The work of the ICRN resonates at the intersection of her research into United States labor history and material culture, and the contemporary documentation and interpretation of those subjects in museums and historic sites. Her National Council on Public History presidential address, â'In the Spaciousness of Uncertainty is Room to Act:' Public Historyâs Long Game,\" can be found in the August 2020 issue of The Public Historian.\n\nPreserving Skills and Knowledge in Heritage Machinery Operations\n\nPippi Carty-Hornsby, Science and Industry Museum in Manchester (UK)\n\nAbstract:\n\nHeritage machinery demonstrations provide unique opportunities for museum visitors to experience the sights, smells and sounds of Britainâs industrial past. However, with many of the operating roles staffed by an ageing population, the sector is at risk of substantial knowledge loss; the tacit skills of the operators may be lost, along with the opportunity for the public to learn from and experience the machinery. This presentation details a knowledge capture approach on the collection of textile machinery at the Science and Industry Museum, prompted by the retirement of the last operator on staff with first-hand experience of the textile industry.\n\nBio:\n\nPippi Carty-Hornsby, MEng, MA, is responsible for the training and operation of the historic machinery at Science and Industry Museum in Manchester, UK, covering the Textiles Gallery and the Power Hall. Her work involves advocating for using authentic heritage machinery stories to explore the relevancy of industrial history in our everyday lives both locally and globally through live interpretation with schools and the public, as well as in permanent exhibitions including the redevelopment of the flagship Power Hall gallery. She has particular interest in the hands-on intersection of industrial machinery and craft, through the narratives of skills, making and wellbeing.\n\nHave Knowledge Will Travel: Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Century Precision Metalworking Amongst the Corn, Potato, and Tobacco Fields of Hatfield, Massachusetts\n\nRobert Forrant, University of Massachusetts Lowell (US)\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe precision machinery builder Porter Machine Works offers an unusual story, having survived some ninety years, with a reach around the world, from the small Connecticut River Valley farming community of Hatfield, Massachusetts (population 3200). Its history emerges from a trove of company records that survived and ended up in the loving care of the Hatfield Historical Society. The records organized into twenty-one boxes, Forrant consumed the firm's history in the summer of 2017, learning that manufacturers of everything from bicycles to automobiles to papermaking machinery owned a Hatfield-built lathe. How this came about tells us a great deal about how firms throughout the river valley recruited and cultivated workersâas well as how archival evidence, alongside hands-on practice, preserves information about the role of industrial skill in an agricultural economy. An associated challenge is the interpretation of this important story in the agricultural and library spaces that house the HHS today.\n\nBio:\n\nRobert Forrant has been on the history faculty at the University of Massachusetts Lowell since 1994. Prior to 1994, he worked nearly fifteen years as a machinist and union business agent in Springfield, MA. Co-author with Christoph Strobel of Ethnicity in Lowell an immigration history of that city and The Big Move: Immigrant Voices From a Mill City, heâs published extensively on the history of precision machining and machinery building in the Connecticut River Valley. Forthcoming is: Where are the Workers: Interpreting Labor and Working-Class History at Museums and Historic Sites, with Mary Anne Trasciatti, University of Illinois Press.\n\nMakers and Creators in a Historic Textile Mill\n\nCathy Randall, Lowell National Historic Park (US)\n\nAbstract:\n\nAutomated spinning and weaving are central to the origin/story of modern industrialization, technology transfer, and practical improvements to technology in the modern period. Lowell National Historical Park and its Boott Cotton Mills Museum preserve and interpret those stories and the material culture of the industrial revolution in Lowell. A key immersive experience for museum visitors is the recreated ca. 1920 weave room, equipped with 90 operable Draper looms. Lowell NHP weaver Cathy Randall will provide a filmed segment about knowledge transfer among machine operators and between machine operators and museum visitors on the shop floor of Lowell, and field questions and comments about the opportunities and challenges of sustaining high quality interpretation through training in light of staffing turnover.\n\nBio:\n\nCathy Randall has worked in the Boott Cotton Mill weave room at Lowell National Historical Park for more than 20 years, weaving, training weavers, and interpreting textile production in a museum setting. She has over 39 years of textile experience, including work at the American Textile History Museum, Cramer Fabrics, and Lowell.\n\nCapturing Skills at a Micro-Scale\n\nMichael Kimmel, University of Vienna (AUT)\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis contribution discusses ways to do a micro-genetic analysis of skilled engagements. With the right tools researchers can capitalize on what experts know, including implicit and embodied facets. Kimmelâs preferred tool is Explication interviewing. It proposes highly specific techniques for creating a mindfulness-based dialogue with expert informants, a âcognitive midwiferyâ approach in which the interviewer facilitates recall. It allows us to inspect âthin slicesâ of a personâs sensorimotor experience, decisions, as well as responses to the ecology step-by-step. Starting from these micro-moments the researcher can then work his or her way up to the causalities of a larger event. Complementarily, Cognitive Task Analysis methods are briefly introduced: the Critical Decision Method, the Knowledge Audit, and Concept Maps. Here, the charting and visualizing of interview-based data receives greater attention, partly at the expense of process sensitivity. Kimmel will discuss the pros and cons of different methodologies relative to different research aims.\n\nBio:\n\nMichael Kimmel is a researcher at the University of Vienna, with a focus on embodied, enactive, embedded, and extended cognitive science. His range of topics includes interaction and joint improvisation, co-creation, embodied decision making, skill theory and movement expertise, as well as expertise for complexity regulation. In addition to some biomechanic work, he has developed micro-genetic interview tools for reconstructing tacit and embodied knowledge (empirical phenomenology, stimulated recall, experimental workshops). Application fields include various forms of improvisational partner dance, martial arts, somatic therapy, and partner acrobatics. Until 2013 he also worked on metaphor, imagery, socio-cultural embodiment, and narrative within a cognitive linguistics context, the field in which he took his PhD in 2002.\n\nThe Challenge of Communicating Artisanal Knowledge\n\nDavid Kirsh, University of California San Diego (US)\n\nAbstract:\n\nDavid Kirsh asks âwhat is involved in developing a theory of human artisanal practices, a theory that recognizes tacit knowledge as the central element?â âThis knowledge,â he asserts, âhas a decidedly first-person orientation. It is body oriented. Some of it is based on sensory motor knowledge of how to act in a nuanced way. Some of it is less motor and more cognitive, concerning what to attend to, how to see and sensemake in a professional way.â Kirsh will discuss âwhy this theory is not reducible to an exportable algorithm,â and explain why the âseductive image of downloading a skill in the film The Matrix is a fantasy, unless we pre-adapt the program to the motor and cognitive details of the recipient, and that will be enormously hard.â He also contends that âa theory must include an account of context: the tools and the workshop where mastery is executed.â In this talk, Kirsh will â sketch what such a theory must include: a) the action repertoire as modified by tool use and skill, b) an account of the relevant cognitive abilities of the stereotypical master practitioner, c) the situation awareness of a master at work, d) a theory of the work environment, including the nature of e) joint activity and shared social space.â\n\nBio:\n\nDavid Kirsh is Professor and past department chair of Cognitive Science at UCSD. He received a D. Phil. (Oxford), did post-doctoral work at MIT (AI Lab), and held research and Visiting Professor positions at MIT, Stanford Univ., and Univ College, London. He has written on situated and embodied cognition, how environments can be shaped to simplify/extend cognition, and how space, external representations, our bodies and even manipulable objects become interactive tools for thought. He runs the Interactive Cognition Lab at UCSD. He is currently Visiting Professor at the Bartlett School of Architecture UCL, he is Adjunct Prof at Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance, London, and President of the Academy of Neuroscience for Architecture.\n\n3D Modeling and Pre-Industrial Craft: The Dominy Workshop and the Horological Gear Cutting Engine\n\nKayle Avery, University of Delaware (US)\n\nAbstract:\n\nKayle Avery will describe the making, animation, and interpretation of a horological gear cutting engine for the H.F. Du Pont Winterthur Museum in Wilmington, Delaware as part of their recent exhibit redesign of the Dominy Workshop, where three generations of Dominy family craftsmen from Long Island worked. He will offer a method for virtualizing pre-industrial crafts using open-source software and describe pairing the 3D model with historical research to bring the model to life and connect it with the exhibit. The goal is to create a display that will provide visitors with a richer understanding of the machineâs uses, the skills and knowledge required to operate it, and the family that did so against all difficulty.\n\nBio:\n\nKayle R. Avery is a curator, historian, and digital artist working at the intersection of creativity, virtuality, and loss. He is currently a PhD student enrolled in the Hagley Program in the History of Capitalism, Technology, and Culture at the University of Delaware where he researches the history and material culture of imagined worlds. In 2021, Kayle received a M.A. from the Winterthur Program in American Material Culture. His thesis, âHistory as Database: Bioshock and the New Design Source,â considered the rapidly changing relationship between digital craftspeople and design source media.\n\nCrafting Beyond the Range of Sensing: Machine Tools as Sensorimotor Prosthetics\n\nSimon Penny, University of California Irvine (US)\n\nAbstract:\n\nICRN founder Simon Penny will outline the remarkable and rapid development of precision engineering in the UK in the first half of the nineteenth century, elucidating the emergence of new crafts or skilled practices specific to this realm of engineered materials and increasingly precise metrology. He will draw upon perspectives from distributed, enactive and embodied cognition to elucidate some qualities of these new cognitive ecologies, and reflect on the transition from artisanal to technical practices, the increasing use of technical drawing and the increasing mathematization of engineering. Lastly, he will discuss the development of mechanical computing in relation to the development of machine tools and industrial machines.\n\nBio:\n\nSimonâs longstanding concern for embodied and situated aspects of aesthetic experience, along with a critical analysis of computer culture, has led to a focus on what he refers to as postcognitivist approaches to cognition - subject of his monograph Making Sense: Cognition, Computing, Art and Embodiment (MIT press 2017). He was director of A Body of Knowledge: Embodied Cognition and the Arts conference UCI 2016. He is professor of Art, Music and Informatics at UCI, associate editor for AI+Society (Springer), guest professor at Nottingham Trent University and co-director and co-originator of ICRN, with Tom Fisher.

Using technology requires âtechnical reasoningâ through tacit knowledge. Acting is thinking; physical actions are directed towards achieving goals, solving problems, and finding efficient and satisfying solutions to these problems. Tacit knowledge is difficult to verbalize and accounts of skilled action in the historical records are limited (written by people who were observing rather than performing the actions). We need to better capture the micro-materialities of interacting with technologies.\n\nBio:\n\nChris is the Chair of Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing in the School of Computer Science at the University of Birmingham. An Ergonomist by training and practice, Chris has long been interested in the ways in which the tools and technologies people use can influence their cognitive and physical capabilities. He is particularly interested in the ways in which data collected from sensors (on the person or on tools) can be used to model skilled activity and the ways in which sensemaking is supported or disrupted by digital technologies. This talk develops ideas on how sensemaking can be performed through interactivity and how this can be captured in the notion of micro-materiality.\n\nTacit Knowledge in Print: Codifying Craft Knowledge in the Enlightenment\n\nMark Thomas Young, Technical University of Delft (NL)\n\nAbstract:\n\nTowards the end of the seventeenth century, English natural philosophers increasingly ventured into a new space in the effort to acquire technical knowledge; artisans workshops. Their goal of codifying craft knowledge motivated the development of a new literary genre, the history of trades. This presentation explores the social and epistemological challenges faced by philosophers who contributed to this project and shows how, instead of signaling a rehabilitation of the status of artisans, attempts to appropriate the technical knowledge of craftsmen were often coupled with rhetorical strategies designed to reinforce rather than relinquish boundaries between artisans and natural philosophers.\n\nBio:\n\nMark Thomas Young is a post-doctoral researcher at the Technical University of Delft. His research covers two fields; the Philosophy of Technology, where he focuses on the use of automating technologies and the History and Philosophy of Science, where he explores instruments, craft practices and tacit knowledge in the early modern period.\n\nBeyond Preservation: Re-evaluating Intangible Cultural Heritage in the UK Ceramic Industry\n\nNeil Brownsword, Staffordshire University (UK)\n\nAbstract:\n\nSince 2003, Neil Brownsword has been engaged in mapping the impact of global economics upon traditional ceramic manufacture in his hometown of Stoke-on-Trent. Using a range of intersecting approaches that include social practice, collaborative performance, object installation and re-enactment, his works have drawn greater critical attention to people and traditional knowledge marginalised by regional industrial change. Whilst advances in automation technology and outsourcing have facilitated greater productivity, once commonplace skills associated with ceramic manufacture have been displaced, threatening the continuation of traditional know-how. This presentation elucidates Brownswordâs artistic projects which re-evaluate intangible cultural heritage within Stoke-on-Trentâs ceramic sector.\n\nBio:\n\nNeil Brownsword is an artist, researcher and educator who holds a Professorial position in ceramics at Staffordshire University. Brownswordâs artistic research examines the manufacturing histories of North Staffordshireâs ceramic industry, and the effects globalisation has had upon people, place and traditional skills in recent decades. His reactivation of associated post-industrial spaces and endangered industrial crafts has achieved impact internationally via cross-cultural exchange, and curated trans-disciplinary collaborative projects. From 2012 â 2020 he initiated and co-led Topographies of the Obsolete with University of Bergen, which has engaged 97 participants from 13 countries with the former Spode factory and Stoke-on-Trentâs broader post-industrial landscape.\n\nArtist Collaborations and Creativity at John Smedley Ltd/ John Smedley Archive Charitable Trust and the Ruddington Framework Knitterâs Museum\n\nJim Gravette, Ruddington Framework Knitters Museum (UK) & Jane Middleton Smith, John Smedley Ltd. (UK)\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe Framework Knitters Museum remains the only site in the world with a training program to preserve the endangered craft of hand frame knitting. The last two years have seen the museum work with artists and craftspeople to help articulate the skill, ingenuity, and resilience that knitters have shown in the last 400 years and to find new applications for this knowledge and craft. This story now unfolds through a series of creative commissions produced by artists and wellbeing groups that engage the visitor with the power and importance of craft and creativity.\n\nSince 1784, John Smedley has used only the very finest fibers to design and manufacture innovative, luxury knitwear, using craft skills that pre-date the Industrial Revolution combining them with the latest technology. The core processes and dedication used in the creation of our knitwear, are the same as those employed by skilled artisans in many other crafts. This paper will outline the evolution of the companyâs thinking in terms of working with craftsmen and artists and will showcase how the juxtaposition of our products with those of other craftspeople is being used to promote the brand and grow new audiences.\n\nJim Grevatte Bio:\n\nJim Grevatte is manager of the Framework Knitters Museum. Heâs worked in the museums and galleries sector for over 20 years in many capacities including learning officer, curator, researcher and advisor. He has extensive experience of leading museum projects particularly where this requires developing new approaches in close consultation with users and museum staff.\n\nJane Middleton Smith Bio:\n\nJane Middleton-Smith has had a long and varied career in education, heritage and museums. Since 2009, she has worked as the Archivist for John Smedley Ltd., caring for and cataloguing the collection of this family-owned company, now considered one of the most significant of its kind. Jane has been instrumental in the creation of a Charitable Trust to take the project to the next stage and is currently working towards establishing a museum offering on site. In addition, she is researching and publishing the history of the family, the company and its products â hosiery and knitwear â and establishing the Trust as a âgo-toâ organization in the world of fashion and textile research.\n\nTraining Living History Interpreters: A Continuous Process\n\nTom Kelleher, Old Sturbridge Village (US)\n\nAbstract:\n\nLiving history interpreters do much more than don historical clothing; they also must master and refine a wide array of communication techniques and often rather arcane sets of hand skills as well, to effectively engage the public in meaningful conversations about the past and the present. In this session Tom Kelleher, Historian and Curator of Mechanical Arts at Old Sturbridge Village (the largest outdoor history museum in the Northeast U.S., depicting a rural New England town of the 1830s), will summarize some of the means employed, and challenges encountered, at one living history museum, and how they continue to evolve with changing times and technology.\n\nBio:\n\nTom Kelleher is currently Historian, and Curator of Mechanical Arts at Old Sturbridge Village in Sturbridge, Massachusetts. In over thirty-seven years there, he has worn many hats both literally and figuratively, working as a costumed historical interpreter, trainer for the cooper shop, supervisor of the mills, coordinator of historic trades, research historian, and program coordinator, including organizing and conducting introductory and on-going staff training. Tom has also researched and developed dozens of historic characters and programs, and presented them, along with teaching a variety of craft skills, communication techniques, and historical subjects at museums, schools, and historical societies around the count\n\nWorking Tinplate by Hand and by Machine: Eighteenth and Nineteenth Century Processes\n\nKarl Schmidt, Dakota Tinworks (US)\n\nAbstract:\n\nIn the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, tinsmithing was an industrial craft. Tinsmiths typically worked independently but were dependent on tinplate made in mills and tools made in foundries. Until the early 1800s, when a series of patent tinsmithing machines were invented and introduced, tin work was done entirely by hand, using stakes to shape the metal. New hand-powered machines sped up the process of shaping the metal, particularly for repetitive operations. In this video demonstration, Karl Schmidt, using antique tools, will discuss the process of working the tinplate both by hand and by machine, highlighting the multi-sensory nature of this work.\n\nBio:\n\nA retired history professor, Karl Schmidt is owner of Dakota Tinworks (www.dakotatinworks.com), where he makes and sells reproduction historical tinware, using authentic materials such as hot-dipped tinplate, shaped with antique tinsmithing tools. Karl trained with master tinsmith William McMillen at Historic Eastfield Village in New York. His detailed understanding of the work of 19th century tinsmithing comes from actually working in the field, making reproductions and studying antique tinware for clues to what was produced and how it was produced. His work is informed by examining 'study pieces' (original tinware), as well as through research in museums and archives.\n\nOne Farmer's Past, Another Farmer's Future\n\nPeter Watson, Howell Living History Farm and the Association for Living History, Farm and Agricultural Museums (ALHFAM) (US)\n\nAbstract:\n\nIn this presentation, ALHFAM Skills and Knowledge Database founder Pete Watson, now co-chair of ALHFAM's Skills Training and Preservation Initiative, will introduce the strategy that the organization is using to help historians manage the livingâand often intangibleâculture surrounding the objects in a material collection. This management extends beyond the preservation of the objects themselves and into the preservation of the skills that give them purpose.\n\nBio:\n\nPete Watson is the Director of Howell Living History Farm, a 220-acre heritage site operated by the Mercer County Park Commission, near Titusville, New Jersey. The farm preserves the history of a 280-year-old New Jersey farmstead interpreted to the years 1890-1910; it hosts tours and interactive learning programs for 65,000 visitors annually. Pete is chairman of the New Jersey Living History Council, executive committee member of the Association for International Agricultural Museums (AIMA), and Past President of the Association for Living History, Farm and Agricultural Museums (ALHFAM). He is the co-chair of ALHFAM's Skills Training & Preservation Committee and the organization's strategic initiative to teach and promote the conservation of skills. His interest in researching and sharing skills, including those that can be adapted for present day and future applications, began during his work as a Peace Corps volunteer in West Africa, where he helped farmers introduce and improve animal powered farming systems with support from local and national agricultural extension services.\n\nJacquard Heads and Fulling Mills: How Machines and Craft Skills Unite in Early Industrial Textile Production\n\nJustin Squizzero, The Burroughs Garrett + Eliza West, Textile Historian (US)\n\nAbstract:\n\nTextiles, often perceived as the bellwether of industrialization, are also a nexus for exploring how early mechanization was used in tandem with craft knowledge and hand skills. In this presentation, historical hand weaver Justin Squizzero will speak about his work recreating the work of 19th century fancy weavers, working with - and within - his loom, and textile historian Eliza Will will detail her work to re-embody the craft knowledge of early 19th century American woolen finishers. The two will then be joined by Dr. Marla Miller for a discussion on how practitioners are able to access different types of industrial craft knowledge, and how that knowledge is further tempered through work.\n\nBio:\n\nJustin Squizzero is a handweaver based in Newbury, Vermont who recreates historic textiles on 18th and 19th-century equipment. Squizzeroâs textile training began as a child under his grandmother, followed by an apprenticeship to Kate Smith and Norman Kennedy of Marshfield, Vermont. Having previously worked at living history museums including Plimoth Patuxet Museums and Coggeshall Farm Museum, Justin returned to weaving full-time in 2013. Through his business The Burroughs Garret, he weaves historic reproductions and figured coverlets using a 19th-century Jacquard machine on an 18th-century handloom, and teaches British/American handweaving at The Marshfield School of Weaving.\n\nEliza West specializes in understanding the skills and craft processes which have created our made world. Though she loves all materials, she finds herself always returning to her first love: textiles. Eliza has an MA from the Winterthur Program in American Material Culture.

Some tools scale production, increase precision and force, and also are a form of computation.â This paper will discuss that nexus via the barn-beam auger. From the 1880s, this tool bores mortises in large timbers. Where a framing the chisel effects one measurementâwidthâthe auger regulates width, depth, angle, and the gestures of the operator, and helps show how tools that partially automate shaping material are part of a larger cognitive envelope.\n\nBio:\n\nT.
