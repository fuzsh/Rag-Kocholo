        "text": "Photo by Anton Rothstein\n\nMP3: BrokenBone\n\nCopenhagen’s Iceage played Carabar awhile ago with Vile Gash and the Men. It was a complete riot which made their New Brigade all the much better to drink and fuck-off to Well, the folks at Matador have signed Iceage and the post-punk heathans will drop a new album February 19th. Escho will release the record in Denmark.\n\nEuro tour dates after the jump\n\nContinue reading →\n\nNoisey just dropped Action Bronson and the Alchemist’s “Rare Chandeliers” Mixtape.\n\nRare Chandeliers features Styles P, Mayhem Lauren, AG Da Coroner, Roc Marciano, Evidence, Schoolboy Q, Big Twin and Sean Price. It’s like if Big Pun and Rammel-zee ate a four course meal at a strip-club after eating adderall and getting zooted. (No space or nasal) It’s hella focused but bugged out in a purely NY sense. Except it’s produced by the Cali’s Alchemist but he produces Mobb Deep and has Soul Assassin roots sooo .. WTF are you saying WESLEY? Peep the tracklist below and download above..\n\n1. Big Body Bes Intro\n\n2. Rare Chandeliers\n\n3. The Symbol\n\n4. Sylvester Lundgren Feat. Meyhem Lauren & Ag Da Coroner\n\n5. Randy The Musical\n\n6. Demolition Men Feat. Schoolboy Q\n\n7.

Above is a freestyle from ODB, Buddha Monk, and 12 O’clock from the Stretch Armstrong Show in 1995 that I found though mediafire and googling. If this is from your site leave a comment and I will put the proper link. ODB doesn’t actually rap until about 6:45 minutes in but it is raw and worth it.\n\nAlso peep:\n\nEgotrip’s Post About ODB Tribute Murals (image above stolen from)\n\nUp North Trip’s Must See ODB Video’s\n\nXXL’s Most Awesome ODB Moments\n\nHarmony Korine Tells A Story About ODB\n\nMP3: DivineFits “WTNBN” RJD2 remix\n\nMP3: Soul Position- “The Good Life”\n\nRJD2 has been on a bit of a roll recently. He released an album with his original Columbus Hip Hop crew, MHz Legacy ,at the end of October. RJ also linked up with Blueprint for a new Soul Position song called the Good Life. The Columbus ex-pat just remixed “Would That Not Be Nice” by his sometime drummer Sam Brown’s new band the Divine Fits. On election day RJ dropped a new song with Kenna.\n\nAbove is a short documentary RJ did with T-Mobile entitled “Life Without Limits” where RJ takes a camera crew around his current hometown Philly while RJ gives his perspective on being an artist. In this video we follow RJ around town, watch him perform shows and also visit his home, while the revered producer and live performer explains that his main motivation is the enjoyment of making music.\n\nProbably the one thing in Columbus music I would’ve never predicted is the Washington Beach Bums usurping the Unholy Two as the most beloved band in North Campus. Or the fact that I would post a video by a band called the Washington Beach Bums willingly in 2012. But I guess moving back into the area makes me laugh at the idea of a boat pearling around Summit. I guess after watching a zillion Mean Jeans video with disbelief in people having that much fun in Portland,Oregon makes me happy something like this was filmed in my neighborhood.\n\nOn Friday, November 16th, at Ace of Cups, the Washington Beach Bums are having a little shindig to celebrate the fact that their debut record, “Party!” will be coming out on Spacebuxxx Records!\n\nThey will be joined by Tree of Snakes and Day Creeper, as well as DJ sets between bands by Detox\n\nThere is so much going this weekend.\n\nThe biggest event will be today when this year’s Wexner Prize winner, Annie Leibovitz and Rolling Stone Publisher Jann S. Wenner will have a public conversation tonight @ the Wex @ 5:30 pm.
