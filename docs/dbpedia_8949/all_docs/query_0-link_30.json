Thanx !\n\nOtherwise Luscious Life\n\nPostcards from downtown\n\nI lost all my faith in love\n\nOn those stairs that November\n\nI know it meant a lot at the time\n\nBut I can barely remember\n\nIt's been a long time\n\nIt's been a long time\n\nYou said I've been alone so long\n\nThat I've got big theories of lonely\n\nAnd you said I drag them all over town\n\nJust to look occupied\n\nBut I'm learning something\n\nI'm doing time\n\nRed light, green light\n\nOne, two, three\n\nHave you come to conquer me\n\nIt's been a long time\n\nIt's been a long time\n\nHey, I know how to take in all kinds of heartless offers\n\nAnd I've learned how to hand back a few\n\nI've come as close to love as to walking on water\n\nSo what could I do with you, what will I do with you\n\nI'm going out now I'll send you some postcards from downtown\n\nI'll show you all the apartments where I got my degrees\n\nWhere I'd fall like small dreams\n\nWhere I'd fade like bright leaves\n\nRed light, green light\n\nOne, two, three\n\nHave you come to conquer me\n\nIt's been a long time, long time\n\nIt's been a long time\n\nIt's been a long time\n\nMiss liberty\n\nI'm Miss liberty\n\nGive me your junkies\n\nYour irresponsible drummers\n\nI've swept my halls clean of clean\n\nYour kitchen raiders and your wingtip dayrunners\n\nGo plant your flags\n\nAnd make your promise to my promised land\n\nAnd we'll make love to the new frontier\n\nIn the hot beach sand\n\nYou'll hold me like a, a drowning man\n\nYou'll come at me too human\n\nAnd drag me down again\n\nAnd leave me broken like a spine\n\nSplit open like a melon\n\nThat's been dropped from a high, high place\n\nBroken like a spine\n\nSplit open like a melon\n\nThat's been dropped\n\nI like this country\n\nShe's like a whore\n\nWho loves her junkies\n\nWho loves all her sad outlaws\n\nLifting her skirt to tease and flirt\n\nWith the wretched who've washed up at her shores\n\nWhen we die I hope someone's God\n\nTakes us in like immigrants\n\nAnd we'll make love in the leftover light\n\nOf heaven's tenements\n\nYou'll hold me like a drowning man\n\nYou'll come at me too human\n\nAnd let you drag me down again\n\nYou'll leave me broken like a spine\n\nSplit open like a melon\n\nThat's been dropped from a high, high place\n\nBroken like a spine\n\nSplit open like a melon\n\nThat's been dropped\n\nbroken like a spine\n\nSplit open like a melon\n\nThat's been dropped, dropped\n\nOtherwise luscious life\n\nI'm as packed as I can handle\n\nI could barely shut the doors\n\nNow I'm staring down the rear view\n\n'Til I can't see you anymore\n\nSomething that was meant to be\n\nSomething that's just you and me\n\nDon't you know with you I fall together\n\nI've got no time or space for this\n\nNo room or space for this strife\n\nAnd I've got no need for those lips\n\nReally you know that's just ripe cherry on an otherwise luscious life\n\nAnd if anybody's looking, I'll be hanging with my girlfriends\n\nI say these dykes and queens and jersey princesses\n\nHave got more balls than any man I ever laid, ever laid\n\nSomething that was meant to be\n\nSomething that's just you and me\n\nDon't you know with you I fall together\n\nI'm gonna squash my sorrows underneath\n\nSome other man, someone else's hands inside my jeans\n\nRubbing up and down my hard seams\n\nAnd I'll tell him you can have my cake\n\nAnd eat it too but when your mouth's dripping full of me\n\nWill you say that I'm not sweet enough for you\n\nMy sugar's gone, I'll tell him my sugar's gone\n\nBecause you can't just blame it on\n\nThe last man who told me how the damn hungry he was, he was\n\nSomething that was meant to be\n\nSomething that's just you and me\n\nDon't you know with you I fall together\n\nI'm as packed as I can handle\n\nI could barely shut the doors\n\nI'm staring down the rear view\n\nOh I can't see you, no I can't see you anymore\n\nAnymore, anymore\n\nI've got no need for those lips\n\nReally you know that's just ripe cherry on an otherwise luscious life\n\nLuscious life, luscious life\n\nBeside you\n\nOn the road to houston\n\nGod there's so much room\n\nTo think in\n\nYou're the thought I just had\n\nIn the mood I just felt\n\nSinking in\n\nBeside you\n\nBeside you\n\nBeside you\n\nI don't need to know you\n\nI just need to be reminded\n\nThis could last an hour\n\nI could search forever\n\nAnd never find this again\n\nBeside you\n\nBeside you\n\nBeside you\n\nSomewhere hearts are pounding\n\nSometimes I just let love\n\nSlide away\n\nIf my heart had wings\n\nNot these heavy shoes that I would fly\n\nBeside you\n\nBeside you\n\nBeside you\n\nPaterson\n\nThe road still runs by the river\n\nThe river still pours into town\n\nBy the time you see where you're headed\n\nYou're half the way down\n\nI was bragging on my independence\n\nSaying love leaves you stumbling and dumb\n\nThen i go and dissolve\n\nJust like cotton candy\n\nOn the tip of some boy's tongue\n\nIn the crackhouse cellars\n\nIn the weary faces\n\nIn the burnt out factories\n\nThis town knows there's nowhere left to go\n\nBut all the way down\n\nWe all know there's nowhere left to go\n\nBut all the way down\n\nBut all the way down\n\nBut all the way down\n\nEvery sad old poppa was a proud young man\n\nFull of victories that he almost won\n\nAll the mistakes he made\n\nPave the streets of Paterson\n\nWe made our concessions to the business\n\nWe paid our dues to the wrong guys\n\nAnd got deeply screwed\n\nBut we don't let anyone tell us what to do anymore\n\nWe need our great falls\n\nIn the trash and foam floats\n\nEvery wish we've ever made\n\nThis town knows there's nowhere left to go\n\nBut all the way down\n\nWe all know there's nowhere left to go\n\nBut all the way down\n\nBut all the way down\n\nBut all the way down\n\nBut all the way down\n\nBut all the way down\n\nOh, mio courÃ© (oh my heart)\n\nOh, mio courÃ© (oh my heart)\n\nSto morento (I'm dying)\n\nMa tu non mi vedi (but you don't see me)\n\nOh, mio courÃ©\n\nOh, mio courÃ©\n\nSto morento\n\nMa tu non mi vedi\n\nSto morento\n\nMa tu non mi vedi\n\nJust like Jack\n\nHe called me his sweet angel\n\nAnd he called this sad town heaven\n\nFor a time I saw it through him\n\nAnd I've appreciated that\n\nAnd you, you talk just like him\n\nFull of poetry and visions\n\nYou don't see things as they are\n\nYou're making mansions out of shacks\n\nAnd you'll be thinking deep thoughts\n\nAs you're sneaking out the back\n\n'Cause you're just like Jack\n\nYou're just like Jack\n\nYour lips will taste like whiskey\n\nFrom the local sugarshack\n\nYou'll tell me that I'm pretty\n\nThough you're probably just bored\n\nAnd everyone will love you\n\n'Cause you blew the dust off this town\n\nYou'll leave everybody wanting\n\nWhat they didn't want before\n\nAnd you would touch us all so deep\n\nBut you won't let us touch you back\n\n'Cause you're just like Jack\n\nYou're just like Jack\n\nWith all I got to keep me here\n\nThe baby and my mother\n\nI'll probably live forever\n\nAnd have nothing new to say\n\nBut don't you ever cross a river\n\nWith that restless heart of yours\n\nYou got nothing to hold onto\n\nYou'll just get swept away\n\nBut you'll be beaming like a floodlight\n\nWhen the night is thick and black\n\n'Cause you're just like Jack\n\nYou're just like Jack, just like Jack\n\nJust like Jack, just like Jack\n\nTouchstone\n\nYou know sometimes\n\nAlone on nights like this\n\nWhen the moon slants just right\n\nAnd bounces naked light around my room\n\nI think of you, I think of you\n\nIt's a girl who'll hold back secrets\n\nWith delicate chains\n\nBut it takes a generous woman\n\nTo break you through her heart again\n\nI still think of you\n\nWhen our bodies were together\n\nAnd our dreams were always bold\n\nWhen I braved your widest crossing\n\nJust to watch myself unfold\n\nI knew you'd be my touchstone\n\nI could see us getting old\n\nRemember me\n\nI curve like a question mark\n\nAnd I'm laying all alone\n\nAnd I can almost feel your answer\n\nLike a saxophone\n\nRemember me\n\nI came to you washed clean\n\nAnd soft as a peace\n\nI said let's climb\n\nAnd all you did was reach for me\n\nWell, I think of you, think of\n\nAnd when our bodies were together\n\nAnd our dreams were always bold\n\nWhen I braved your widest crossing\n\nJust to watch myself unfold\n\nI knew you'd be my touchstone\n\nEven when you got all cold\n\nSometimes, alone on nights like this\n\nAnd when the moon slants just right\n\nAnd bounces naked light\n\nNaked light around my room\n\nI think of you\n\nCrime scene\n\nI peeled you off like onion skin\n\nIn layers I felt myself burning again and again\n\nI'm smaller than I was before, than I was before\n\nOdd and even to the core\n\nOh, you thrill and disgust me\n\nYou're just like this city\n\nRight down to your girders and grime\n\nYou're meanness, your muggings, your casual crimes\n\nI'm a jersey girl, a tunnel train\n\nEmpty, then loaded, then empty again\n\nOh these days I'm just passing through\n\nI'm just passing through\n\nSomeday I won't remember you\n\nOh you fuck like an artist\n\nAnd you know that you do\n\nYou got 'em dripping in fuschia\n\nAnd moaning in cobalt blue\n\nAnd we all run into each other\n\nLike watercolors\n\nIn other lives, in other countries\n\nI loved you just the same\n\nBut I, I, I\n\nIn some lost language\n\nMy tongue has licked\n\nThe vowels in your name\n\nI limped off like a crime scene\n\nI took self defense classes\n\nI now walk wide of dark alleys\n\nAnd blondes with little round glasses\n\nShowdown\n\nPulled out the big guns\n\nGot my best dress on\n\nShit, I'd forgotten you were charming\n\nYou're disarming\n\nBeen playing too hard\n\nThis is a hard town\n\nAnd all my old gang\n\nHas broken down, somehow\n\nI miss them all\n\nThough not just now\n\nWe say I'm fine, how are you\n\nHey, hey\n\nIt's a showdown\n\nHey\n\nIt's a showdown\n\nIt's you and me\n\nGot you pinned up against a stark raving skyline\n\nIt's love, yeah love\n\nJust picks me up then lets me down\n\nPulled out the big guns\n\nGot my new shoes on\n\nI'm gonna wear a groove so deep\n\nIn your mind that everyone coming after me\n\nWill be moving to my beat\n\nHey, hey\n\nIt's a showdown\n\nHey, yeah\n\nIt's a showdown\n\nWe got green lights down 9th avenue\n\nWe got an ice cold slice of a winter moon\n\nWe both got torture guards around our hearts\n\nMine used to break me down too soon\n\nHey, hey\n\nIt's a showdown\n\nHey\n\nIt's a showdown\n\nHey, hey\n\nIt's a showdown, showdown\n\nShowdow, down, down\n\nIt's a showdown\n\nWonderful\n\nI know that we're both treading water\n\nI know we were just having fun\n\nAnd I've still been waiting\n\nWe could've been something wonderful\n\nYou said I can't find my way round this room anymore\n\nSince you left, I had to move my bed\n\nAnd move my chest of drawers\n\nWas I poking out the closet\n\nWas I balled up in your sheets\n\nWas I a smell left on your fingers\n\nWas I the shirt you let me keep\n\nAnd it's just like a man to toss away\n\nwhat made him come to his senses again\n\nI know that we're both treading water\n\nI know we were just having some fun\n\nAnd I still think we\n\nI still think we could've been something wonderful\n\nI know you, I know where you come from\n\nLove's dicked you around and someone's let you down\n\nWere they poking out the closet\n\nWere they balled up in your sheets\n\nWere they my smell left on your fingers\n\nWere they the shirt you let me keep\n\nAnd it's just like a man to toss away\n\nWhat made him come to his senses again\n\nI know that we're both treading water\n\nI know we were just having some fun\n\nAnd still I think we\n\nWe could've been something wonderful\n\nLa la song\n\nHe's got his la la\n\nHe's got a tambourine\n\nAnd he'll play it for all the girls\n\nWho have heartstrings\n\nHe stomps the floor\n\nLike a matador\n\nHe says, wait, wait, wait\n\nThere she goes again\n\nOn a high climb\n\nThe back of her neck breaks my heart sometimes\n\nSo you close your eyes\n\nYou smile goodbye\n\nYou think, wait, wait, wait\n\nWait, wait, wait\n\nPostcards From Downtown\n\nFred Astaire\n\nI'm caught\n\nI'm seen through\n\nIf you were a chivalrous man\n\nYou'd know what to do\n\nYou're a sad prince\n\nYou're my most humble pie\n\nAnd under serious oath\n\nYou're my sweetest lie\n\nI had a dream that you danced\n\nJust like Fred Astaire\n\nI sat and watched, leaning back\n\nAs you glided on air around me\n\nI'd do anything you want\n\nLook what you've done\n\nI'd be a game that you play\n\nMuch too easily won\n\nI'm too easily won\n\nAnd I don't care\n\nWhat you do\n\nWho strokes your hair\n\nWhere you run off to\n\nMill Street tonight is twinkling like stars\n\nHollywood dust under seventies cars\n\nI miss you\n\nI'd do anything you want\n\nLook what you've done\n\nI'd be a game that you play\n\nMuch too easily won\n\nI'm too easily won\n\nAnd what do you remember\n\nAfter too much sweet wine;\n\nThat you woke up hung-over\n\nOr that you had a good time\n\nWell, I had a good time\n\nLove gets in the way\n\nI've made love with one eye on the door\n\nI've left good rooms with nothing to say\n\nI wanted to love them\n\nBut love got in the way\n\nI wanted to love them\n\nBut love gets in the way\n\nAnd so what if everything's changed\n\nAnd so what if I've held out for more\n\nI'm all wild in places I wasn't before\n\nI'm wild in places where I wasn't before\n\nSo come on and make a mess of me\n\nI won't walk away\n\nI'm ready as I'll ever be\n\nI won't walk away\n\nI want to be fed by you\n\nI want to be led by you\n\nI thought I wanted freedom\n\nBut love got in the way\n\nI went looking for freedom\n\nBut love got in the way\n\nSo come on and make a mess of me\n\nI won't walk away\n\nI'm ready as I'll ever be\n\nI won't walk away\n\nSomebody leave a light on\n\nHe was blessed, the best of us\n\nAnd now the boy is gone\n\nHe was so beautiful and stupid\n\nHe'd go swimming with his boots on\n\nYou spend too much time with strangers\n\nYou spend too much time alone\n\nYou need someone to leave a light on\n\nWhen you're headed home\n\nSomebody leave a light on\n\nSomebody leave a light on\n\nIf someone told you you'd be\n\nTied to some wicked\n\nAnd some beautiful dreams\n\nAnd go clanking town to town\n\nNow - like a tortured dog\n\nNow - like a wedding car\n\nTill you're a tough old telephone pole\n\nNaked and stuck to a sad stretch of road\n\nCalling up everyone you know\n\nSomebody leave a light on\n\nI know love is everywhere\n\nWhatever ground you stand on\n\nI'll take what sight is offered me\n\nWhatever lights you turn on\n\nSomebody leave a light on\n\nIs there anybody out there\n\nYou're a tough old telephone pole\n\nIs there anybody out there\n\nNaked and stuck to a sad stretch of road\n\nShit this town is nowhere\n\nCalling up everyone\n\nIs there anybody home\n\nYou know\n\nPostcards from downtown\n\nI lost all my faith in love\n\nOn those stairs that November\n\nI know it meant a lot at the time\n\nNow I can barely remember\n\nIt's been a long time\n\nIt's been a long time\n\nYou said I've been alone so long\n\nThat

bend again\n\nShe couldn't make him stay\n\nThere's too much trouble\n\nTo get into everywhere\n\nHis devil called from downtown\n\nNow his angel's gone to pray\n\nIt's a wonder he's alive\n\nBut he's alive somewhere\n\nYou know the city guys are dangled\n\nEvery time you take the stage\n\nThey're swelling up like poets\n\nWhile you're rattling your cage\n\nYou're all they left the suburbs

words\n\nAnother one of his doubts was gone\n\nShould he try to rap with her\n\nShould he stand and stare\n\nAnd no one else was watching her\n\nShe didn't seem to care\n\nSo over and over, she said the words\n\n'Til he could take no more\n\nThen he dragged her from the stage\n\nAnd together they ran to the back door\n\nIn the alley over by the curb\n\nHe said tell me what's your name\n\nShe only

way it used to be\n\nIn the glass I saw a strange reflection\n\nWas that lonely woman really me\n\nThose were the days my friend\n\nWe thought they'd never end\n\nWe'd sing and dance forever and a day\n\nWe'd live the life we choose\n\nWe'd fight and never lose\n\nThose were the days\n\nOh yes those were the days\n\nLa la la la la la\n\nLa la la la la la...\n\nThrough the door there came

never met\n\nWho's the one who got away\n\nAnother black feather\n\nI'm lonely today\n\nBut in a good way\n\nI've let my heart lead\n\nWithout mercy sometimes\n\nI'm faithful to you\n\nAnd I know I will be\n\nAnd I'm not always kind, but I'm trying\n\nThere's a zydeco band\n\nIn the last sticky light\n\nAnd I'm dancing with strangers, one after another\n\nAnd the only thing left\n\nTo want from this night\n\nIs you dancing with me as my own sweetest lover\n\nYou're in the city and you're looking for desert\n\nThen you're in the desert and you're wishing for rain\n\nYou're in his arms looking for comfort\n\nHe's given you comfort and you're wishing for pain\n\nNot another dark waltz\n\nI dream these too often\n\nOut in the back\n\nDigging holes for our dinner\n\nAnother brass tack\n\nFor the lid of my coffin\n\nAnother black feather\n\nFor the wings of a sinner\n\nYou're in the city and you're looking for desert\n\nThen you're in the desert and you're wishing for rain\n\nYou're in his arms looking for comfort\n\nHe's given you comfort now you're begging for pain\n\nHey next time I see you\n\nCould you act like a stranger and\n\nKiss me like you don't know love has a chance\n\nRemember that first time\n\nIn my old apartment\n\nWhenever our feet touch the ground\n\nLet 'em dance\n\nBanks of the edisto\n\n(for gus)\n\nI've been lazy\n\nI've been overfed\n\nI've been thinking\n\nToo much with my head\n\nI was dreaming\n\nAbout the life you led\n\nOn the banks of the Edisto\n\nOn the banks of the edisto\n\nWhere the sweet gum and the cypress grows\n\nI want to know what the cypress knows\n\nOn the banks of the Edisto\n\nWhere'd you go\n\nWhen you died my friend\n\nDo you see us\n\nDid your soul ascend\n\nAnd I listened\n\nFor his answer then\n\nOn the banks of the edisto\n\nHeaven's here where the bard owl cries\n\nWhere the smile meets my sweetheart's eyes\n\nI'll be right here taming dragonflies\n\nOnly heaven I need to know\n\nOn the banks of the edisto\n\nWhere the sweet gum\n\nAnd the cypress grows\n\nI want to know what the cypress knows\n\nOn the banks of the edisto\n\nI've been lazy\n\nI've been overfed\n\nI've been thinking too much with my head\n\nI've been dreaming\n\nAbout the life you led\n\nOn the banks of the edisto\n\nIt's the Day of Atonement, 2001\n\nIt's the Day of Atonement, two thousand one\n\nAnd I'm sorry for anything I

nothing much at all\n\nSummer's passed, it's too late to cut the grass\n\nThere ain't much to rake anyway in the fall\n\nAnd sometimes I just ain't in the mood\n\nTo take my place in back with the loudmouths\n\nYou're like a picture on the fridge that's never stocked with food\n\nI used to live at home, now I stay at the house\n\nAnd everybody wants to be special here\n\nThey call your name out loud and clear\n\nHere comes a regular\n\nCall out your name\n\nHere comes a regular\n\nAm I the only one here today\n\nWell a drinking buddy that's bound to another town\n\nOnce the police made you go away\n\nAnd even if you're in the arms of someone's baby now\n\nI'll take a great big whiskey to you anyway\n\nEverybody wants to be someone's here\n\nSomeone's gonna show up, never fear\n\nHere comes a regular\n\nCall out your name\n\nHere comes a regular\n\nAm I the only one who feels ashamed\n\nKneeling alongside old Sad Eyes\n\nHe says opportunity knocks once then the door slams shut\n\nAll I know is I'm sick of everything that my money can buy\n\nThe fool who wastes his life, God rest his guts\n\nFirst the lights, then the collar goes up, and the wind begins to blow\n\nTurn your back on a pay-you-back, last call\n\nFirst the glass, then the leaves that pass, then comes the snow\n\nAin't much to rake anyway in the fall\n\nEverybody wants to be special here\n\nThey call your name out loud and clear\n\nHere comes a regular\n\nCall out my name\n\nHere comes a regular\n\nAm I the only one here today\n\nDon't Go Down\n\n( Elliott Smith )\n\nI met a girl, a snowball in

down\n\nStay with me\n\nBaby, stay\n\nHer mama called me a thief\n\nAnd her dad called himself commander-in-chief\n\nI fought him off with my love\n\nBut I knew the sense of worthlessness she'd have

own body outlined in chalk\n\nI split the scene, the globe had been spun\n\nAnd her ghost leaned down to kiss me with a message from the sun\n\nDon't go down\n\nDon't go down\n\nStay with me\n\nBaby, stay\n\nDon't go down\n\nDon't go down\n\nStay with me\n\nBaby stay\n\nHanging Around My Boy\n\nI've got a boy that I love with all my mind\n\nHe loves me and I'm gonna treat him right\n\nNo one else
