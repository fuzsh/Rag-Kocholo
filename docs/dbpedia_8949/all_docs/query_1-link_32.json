        "text": "Methods\n\nSTARR, a prospective, single-arm, multicenter trial, was open to enrollment from October 24, 2008 to March 31, 2011 (29 months, total). Mayo Clinic Hospital, Phoenix, Arizona served as the hub primary stroke center and its vascular neurologists provided emergency telestroke consultations to seven participating rural, remote, or underserved spoke community hospitals in Arizona. Refer to with spoke hospital characteristics. The nature of the relationships between STARR hub and spoke hospitals has already been described in two earlier publications.4,5\n\nTable 1.\n\nSpoke hospitalPopulation of city (2010 census)Urban areaBed capacity of hospitalTrauma center levelCertified advanced life support hospitalStart dateDistance from hub (miles)Distance from hub (kilometers)Local neurologistsAnnual stroke admissions (2012)Heliport yes/noCopper Queen Community Hospital5575No25/(25*)IVNoJanuary, 200923638000YesBisbee, AZ (Cochise County)* Verde Valley Medical Center11,265No110IVYesSeptember, 200997.6157394YesCottonwood, AZ (Yavapai County) Flagstaff Medical Center65,870Yes267IYesJuly, 20101392245230YesFlagstaff, AZ (Coconino County) Kingman Regional Medical Center28,068No235IVYesOctober, 20081873023116NoKingman, AZ (Mohave County) La Paz Regional Hospital3046No39/(25*)IVYesJanuary, 2009116187010YesParker, AZ (La Paz County)* Maricopa Integrated Health System1,563,025Yes449IYesSeptember, 201021.134156102YesPhoenix, AZ (Maricopa County) Yuma Regional Medical Center93,064Yes406N/AYesOctober, 20082063318334YesYuma, AZ (Yuma County)(1)(9)(2)(7)(7)(3)(4)(4)(5)(7)(8)\n\nEligibility criteria for activation of a telestroke alert and study enrollment were: adult (age ≥18 years), suspicion of an acute stroke syndrome by emergency medical services (EMS) and emergency department (ED) triage, objective signs of focal neurological deficits on ED arrival, Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale score of ≥1, and time window since onset or since last known to be at baseline state was 12 h. Exclusion criteria were: inability to obtain consent and incarceration.\n\nThe seven participating spoke hospitals included Copper Queen Community Hospital (Bisbee, AZ), Verde Valley Medical Center (Cottonwood, AZ), Flagstaff Medical Center (Flagstaff, AZ), Kingman Regional Medical Center (Kingman, AZ), La Paz Hospital (Parker, AZ), Maricopa Integrated Health System (Phoenix, AZ), and Yuma Regional Medical Center (Yuma, AZ). The distances between the hub and the closest and farthest spoke hospital were 21 and 236 miles, respectively (34 and 380 kilometers). The bed capacity of the spoke hospitals ranged between 25 and 449 (Refer to ).\n\nThe hub telestroke consultation team included five American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology ABPN-certified vascular neurologists, one American College of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) vascular neurology fellow, and one Neurovascular Education and Training in Stroke Management and Acute Reperfusion Therapies (NET-SMART) graduate vascular neurology nurse practitioner who were supervised by a vascular neurologist. The telestroke service operated 24/7/365.\n\nEach spoke hospital's regional EMS providers, ED physicians, nurses, hospitalists, intensivists, radiologists/teleradiologists, radiology technologists, pharmacists, laboratory technologists, and information technologists received telemedicine orientation and training, in addition to acute stroke education. The hub personnel helped the spoke personnel to learn how to conduct the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and to adopt a uniform stroke alert system, acute stroke care algorithm, and common paper or electronic acute stroke order sets, which adhered to the applicable American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) guidelines at the time of the study.6\n\nMembers of the Mayo Clinic hub telestroke team (including medical director, program manager, operations administrator, stroke nurse practitioner, clinical coordinator, emergency department (ED) nurse, Information Technology (IT), and clinical research coordinator) spent a minimum of 2 days at each spoke hospital campus before go-live and at least one day annually thereafter for ensuring telestroke skill maintenance and for providing acute stroke continuing medical education.\n\nEvery hub vascular neurologist was licensed in the state of Arizona and underwent credentialing, privileging, and requisite annual telemedicine practice peer reviews specified by each of the participating spoke hospitals. A standard telestroke service line contract agreement was signed by hub and spoke hospital officials. The state government sponsor, ADHS research grant covered the cost of acquisition, maintenance, and service of the selected telemedicine equipment as well as the professional telestroke services provided. During the study interval, spoke hospitals did not pay the hub hospital an annual subscription fee. Professional reimbursement for each telestroke consultation was not sought from government or nongovernment payers during the study period.\n\nThe STARR algorithm began with community emergency medical services (EMS) and/or spoke hospital ED personnel recognition of a possible acute stroke syndrome meeting STARR eligibility criteria (see above). Pre-hospital notification to the intended recipient hospital was triggered by EMS. The spoke ED activated a toll free telestroke hotline number, which resulted in a direct connection to either the hub on-call vascular neurologist's digital pager and/or cellular phone. No intermediate switchboard operator was positioned between the referring spoke hospital and the on-call vascular neurologist.\n\nAccording to the STARR protocol algorithm, the hub vascular neurologist was obligated to respond by telephone within 10 min and by video telemedicine within 20 min of receipt of telestroke alert activation. In the event of no telephone response in 10 min, the spoke hospital re-activated the telestroke hotline and/or dialed hub hospital switchboard to be connected to the vascular neurologist on-call. These time intervals served as targets and were the subject of on-going quality assurance and quality improvement initiatives.\n\nThe STARR telestroke consultation overview, its features, suggested target time intervals, and an illustrative case has been previously published.5\n\nThe STARR trial protocol PR08-005156-09 was reviewed and approved by Mayo Clinic IRB, which served as the central IRB of record for all the participating hospitals. The STARR trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov.\n\nTechnology methodology section\n\nThe equipment and software utilized in the STARR study could be grouped into three main categories: (1) telemedicine video cart systems, (2) picture archive and communications systems (PACS) software, and (3) call management solutions.\n\nTelemedicine video cart systems used as communications endpoints at spoke hospitals included BF Technologies Telemedicine Carts (BF Technologies, Inc., San Diego, CA) and comprised Windows-based PC's running AccessVideo™ software to deliver secure Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant two-way audio/high resolution video over standard Ethernet dedicated Internet services. In addition, GlobalMed Pole Series Mobile Video Carts (GlobalMedia Group, LLC, Scottsdale, AZ), which combined a Windows-based PC, integrated iRez i5770 pan/tilt/zoom camera, and EasyShare VC software, were used to provide secure HIPAA compliant two-way audio/video conferencing sessions at several spoke hospitals.\n\nPACS software implemented for access to digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM) files included OnePacs, ResolutionMD®, and PacsOne (part of the turnkey BF Technologies Telemedicine Cart solution). The OnePacs (OnePacs, LLC, Wilmington, DE) system stored and transmitted DICOM data that could be accessed via a web-based study viewer or locally on server-based software installed at each spoke site. ResolutionMD (Calgary Scientific, Calgary, AB) enabled access to DICOM radiology images from web browsers and mobile devices by implementing proprietary U.S. Food and Drug Administration Class II accredited technology that safeguarded patient data behind the spoke hospital's firewall.\n\nFinally, PacsOne, a DICOM 3.0 compliant PACS application, was implemented in conjunction with all BF Technologies Telemedicine Cart installations. Lastly, RingCentral (RingCentral, Inc., Belmont, CA), a cloud-based communications solution, was used to automatically direct incoming telestroke alert calls from spoke hospitals to the on-call vascular neurologist's digital pager and/or cellular phone based on pre-programmed daily schedules.\n\nStatistics section\n\nSummary statistics were calculated for each variable.\n\nResults\n\nThe telestroke hotline was activated 537 times by participating spoke hospitals during the study period. graphically displays the study flow: 537 telestroke hotline activations (telestroke alerts), 447 subjects who met eligibility criteria, and 443 subjects who provided consent for participation, to the 443 subjects who underwent telemedicine consultation and who had follow-up to hospital discharge, and finally to the 310 subjects for whom follow-up data were retrieved to study completion at 90 days.\n\ndisplays the number of subjects enrolled by each of the seven participating spoke hospital sites, ranging from 9 to 225 subjects and the total enrollment of 443 subjects.\n\nTable 2.\n\nTotal (N = 443)Site Yuma225 (50.8%) Kingman82 (18.5%) Parker31 (7.0%) Bisbee29 (6.5%) Cottonwood22 (5.0%) Flagstaff45 (10.2%) Maricopa9 (2.0%)\n\nFor 68.2% (302/443) of subjects, the precise date and time of stroke symptom onset was discoverable and documented and for the remainder it was unknown. In 14.2% (63/443) of instances, the subject awoke from sleep with their neurological deficit. The mode of arrival at spoke hospital ED was ground ambulance in 65.7% (291/443), air ambulance in 0.5% (2/443), private automobile in 33.4% (148/443), in-patient in 0.2% (1/443), and not documented in 0.2% (1/443). The first documented blood pressure values were 151 mm Hg median systolic (Q1–136, Q3–170; range 96 to 240) and 87 mm Hg median diastolic (Q1–76, Q3–96; range 50 to 186).\n\ndisplays all the applicable acute stroke time intervals, from symptom onset (or time last known to be at baseline state) to 9-1-1 call and EMS transport times (when applicable), to spoke hospital arrival and triage, telestroke alert activation, consultation, diagnostic test availability and interpretation, preliminary diagnosis, thrombolysis decision making, thrombolysis administration, and telestroke consult completion.\n\nTable 3.\n\nN MeanStandard deviationMedianQ1, Q3Symptom onset to ED arrival (min)443216.71333.566.040.0, 150.0ED arrival to telestroke hotline page (min)44346.556.832.015.0, 57.0Telestroke hotline page to neurologist returning call4431.32.51.00.0, 2.0Neurologist returning call to consent signed (min)44314.2168.64.00.0, 14.0Consent signed to telemedicine consult commencing (min)4432.9169.911.03.0, 20.0Telemedicine consult commencing to alteplase eligibility decision44323.817.122.014.0, 31.0Alteplase eligibility decision to alteplase administration (min)10023.313.324.015.0, 32.0Alteplase eligibility decision to end of telemedicine consultation (min)44313.213.78.05.0, 17.0Symptom onset to alteplase administration (min)100164.545.1156.5130.0, 196.0ED arrival to alteplase administration (min)10098.429.495.581.0, 112.0Symptom onset to EMS dispatch (min)293105.0194.425.010.0, 99.0EMS dispatch to EMS arrival on scene (min)2936.86.56.04.0, 8.0EMS arrival on scene to EMS departure (min)29311.34.411.08.0, 14.0EMS departure to ED arrival (min)29315.99.614.09.0, 21.0\n\nFive vascular neurologists participated in the study, with a range of individual contributions. In descending order, vascular neurologists contributed 180, 102, 80, 72, and 9 of the 443 subjects' telestroke consultations during the study. For 40 out of 443 (9.0%) an ACGME vascular neurology fellow and in 23 out of 443 (5.2%) an NET SMART trained vascular neurology nurse practitioner contributed to the telestroke assessment under direct vascular neurology supervision.\n\nSubject demographics include median age 69.1 years (Q1–56.5, Q3–78.7, range 21 to 97, ethnicity and race 423/443 [95.5%] White, 9/443 [2.0%] Black, 7/443 [1.6%] Native American Indian, 2/443 [0.5%] Pacific Islander, 1/443 [0.2%] Asian, and 1/443 [0.2%] Other/Not specified).

Urine pregnancy tests were ordered in 11 subjects, and all were negative. Urine drug toxicology screens were ordered in 76 out of 443 (17.2%) and of those ordered, 22 out of 76 (28.9%) were positive.\n\nSubjects' pre-stroke Modified Rankin Scale score mean and standard deviation (SD) was 0.5 (1.0) with a range of 0 to 4, Modified Rankin Scale score at ED presentation mean and SD was 2.8 (1.5) with a range of 0 to 5, and NIHSS score mean (SD) at presentation was 8.1 (8.4) with a range of 0 to 40.\n\nNon-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) head studies were acquired in all subjects and interpreted independently by a local spoke hospital radiologist and hub teleneurologist in 315 out of 443 (71.1%) and exclusively by the local spoke hospital radiologist in 128 out of 443 (28.9%). The overall quality of the scans was determined to be excellent in 347 out of 443 (78.3%), fair but interpretable in 17 out of 443 (3.8%), and quality not assessed in 79 out of 443 (17.8%). The NCCT was judged to be abnormal in 260 out of 443 (59.1%).\n\nRadiologic evidence of an acute stroke was reported in 92 out of 443 (20.8%), chronic stroke in 199 out of 443 (44.9%), and signs of edema present in 14.6% (in those subjects with NCCT signs of edema present, sulcal effacement was identified in 54.1%, compression of ventricles in 40.5%, midline shift in 24.3%, and loss of gray-white differentiation in 67.6%), hyperdense artery signs in 17.8%, intracerebral hemorrhage in 8.1% [intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) median volume 30.4 mL, Q1–11.7, Q3–89.3, range 1.9 to 340 mL], subarachnoid hemorrhage in 4.2%, acute subdural or epidural hematoma in 1.2%, intracranial neoplasm in 1.9%, cerebral atrophy in 29.2%, aneurysm clip in 0.4%, cyst in 0.4%, shunt in 1.2%, evidence of previous craniotomy in 2.3%, hydrocephalus in 0.8%, vertebral basilar dolichoectasia in 0.8%, parenchymal calcium deposition in 3.8%, and chronic small vessel ischemic changes in 28.8%.\n\nRadiologic contraindications to intravenous thrombolysis were identified in 17.4% of NCCTs.

During the telestroke consultations, the neurologists obtained information regarding the subject's history from the patient directly (323/443 (72.9%)), a family member (303/443 (68.4%)), a companion (32/443 (7.2%)), an ED nurse (282/443 (63.7%)), an ED physician (328/443 (74.0%)), an ED resident (37/443 (8.4%)), and/or other (14/443 (3.2%)).\n\nNeurologists received telepresenter bedside assistance with their telemedicine examination of the subject in the ED by the ED nurse (376/443 (84.9%)), ED physician (89/443 (20.1%)), ED resident (27/443 (6.1%)), mid-level practitioner (1/443 (0.2%)), family member or companion (66/443 (14.9%)), and/or other (20/443 (4.5%)).\n\nTechnical observations\n\nThe telestroke consultations began in 437 out of 443 (98.6%) subjects and they were successfully completed in 430 out of 443 (97.1%) subjects. The 7 telestroke consultations that started but could not be completed each failed due to an Internet connectivity issue, which could not be immediately rectified.\n\nIn 254 out of 443 (57.3%) of the subjects' telestroke consultations, a technical observation arose. Of all the subjects' consultations with technical observations, 44.1% included an audio problem, 48.8% included a video problem, 51.6% included a radiology problem, 20.5% included an Internet connection problem, and 11.8% included a problem not otherwise classified. Of the 254 subjects' consultations with technical observations, 181 out of 254 (71.3%) had no effect on clinical diagnosis and decision making, 69 out of 254 (27.2%) delayed clinical diagnosis and decision making, and only 4 out of 254 (1.6%) prevented a clinical diagnosis and/or decision making from occurring.\n\nTelemedicine equipment\n\nThe technology deployed during the consultations included the telephone in 435 out of 443 (98.2%), BF Technologies (BFT) audio video in 297 out of 443 (67.0%), BFT DICOM in 297 out of 443 (28.0%), Global Med audio video in 103 out of 443 (23.3%), iPhone Calgary Scientific in 98 out of 443 (22.1%), OnePACS teleradiology in 84 out of 443 (19.0%), Computer PACSone in 82 out of 443 (18.5%), iPhone PACSone in 17 out of 443 (3.8%), and other in 4 out of 443 (0.9%). The most frequently preferred sequence of technology deployment during telestroke consultations was first telephone communication, second audio video telemedicine connection, and third teleradiology access.\n\nED admitting diagnoses\n\nAfter the telestroke consultations, the ED admitting diagnoses were ischemic stroke with administration of intravenous (IV) alteplase in 100 out of 443 (22.6%), ischemic stroke without IV alteplase administration in 170 out of 443 (38.4%), transient ischemic attack in 30 out of 443 (6.8%), intracerebral hemorrhage in 21 out of 443 (4.7%), subarachnoid hemorrhage in 2 out of 443 (0.5%), non-cerebrovascular related in 59 out of 443 (13.3%), and unknown in 61 out of 443 (13.7%).\n\nFollow-up imaging\n\nThe CTA head and neck studies were conducted in 99 out of 443 (22.3%). In 36 out of 99 (36.4%), an arterial occlusion was observed; in ICA, 22 out of 99 (22.2%), MCA-M1 11 out of 99 (11.1%), MCA-M2 6 out of 99 (6.1%), ACA 3 out of 99 (3.0%), Basilar 1 out of 99 (1.0%), and PCA 0 out of 99 (0%). The magnetic resonance angiography head and neck studies were conducted in 206 out of 443 (46.5%) and 51 out of 443 (11.5%), respectively. Carotid ultrasound studies were conducted in 235 out of 443 (53.0%), echocardiogram trans-thoracic studies in 197 out of 443 (44.5%), and trans-esophageal in 52 out of 443 (11.7%).\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain studies were conducted in 307 out of 443 (69.3%) and in 108 out of 307 (58.6%) a clinically relevant acute ischemic stroke was identified. The NCCT studies were conducted within 48 h post-stroke in 134 out of 443 (30.2%), and a clinically relevant acute ischemic stroke was identified in 72 out of 134 (53.7%). Mean (SD) ASPECT score was 7.9 (3.0) with range 0–10. Hyperdense MCA sign was identified in 27 out of 134 (20.1%) of the NCCT studies.\n\nThrombolysis complications\n\nThe IV alteplase was administered to 100 out of 443 (22.6%) of the subjects in the study. Post-thrombolysis, any intracerebral hemorrhage was detected in 12 out of 100 (12.0%), symptomatic ICH in 5 out of 100 (5.0%), and asymptomatic ICH in 7 out of 100 (7.0%). ECASS HI-1 was detected in 2 out of 12 (16.7%), HI-2 in 1 out of 12 (8.3%), PH-1 in 3 out of 12 (25.0%), and PH-2 in 5 out of 12 (41.7%). The outcomes post-SICH were 4 out of 12 (33.3%) complete recovery, 5 out of 12 (41.6%) recovery with sequelae, and 3 out of 12 (25.0%) fatal. Major systemic bleeding occurred in 2 out of 100 (2.0%) of subjects receiving IV alteplase, and hemilingual angioedema occurred in 1 out of 100 (1.0%).\n\nFollow-up brain imaging studies confirmed the presence of an acute ischemic stroke in 233 out of 443 (52.6%) of subjects overall.\n\nEtiologic classification of ischemic stroke\n\nEtiologies of the ischemic stroke were classified by TOAST criteria as follows: Large Artery Atherosclerosis 11.8%, Cardioembolic 48.1%, Small Vessel (Lacunar) 17.5%, Stroke of Other Determined Etiology 3.0%, and Stroke of Undetermined Etiology 19.5%.\n\nInterventional management\n\nInterventions of any kind occurred in 36 out of 443 (8.1%) of the subjects. The interventions were (arranged from most to least frequent) other 23, craniotomy for ICH evacuation 4, Inferior Vena Cava filter placement 4, carotid angioplasty and stenting 3, decompressive hemicraniectomy 3, cardiac catheterization 3, carotid endarterectomy 2, endovascular thrombectomy 2, and intracranial aneurysm coiling 1 (note some subjects had ≥1 intervention).\n\nlists all the subjects' final hospital discharge diagnoses. Approximately half of the subjects were diagnosed with an ischemic stroke, and approximately three quarters of the subjects were diagnosed with a cerebrovascular disease of some variety (ischemic or hemorrhagic). The list of non-cerebrovascular diseases mimicking stroke is provided in .\n\nTable 5.\n\nN = 443 n (%) Ischemic stroke234 (52.8)TIA65 (14.7)ICH23 (5.2)SAH2 (0.5)Encephalopathy6 (1.4)Seizure21 (4.7)Syncope/presyncope7 (1.6)Migraine10 (2.3)Functional15 (3.4)Dementia5 (1.1)Vestibular neurontitis/labyrinthitis/BPPV2 (0.5)Meningitis/encephalitis1 (0.2)Brain neoplasm4 (0.9)Hypoglycemia1 (0.2)Unknown diagnosis11 (2.5)Transient global amnesia2 (0.5)Other/not classifiable34 (7.7)\n\nSubjects' disposition status after ED assessment was 312 out of 443 (70.4%) admitted to Spoke Facility (Originating Site) and 131 out of 443 (29.6%) transferred from Spoke Facility (Originating Site). Of those subjects transferred from Spoke Facility to another facility, 29% were transferred to Mayo Clinic Hospital Stroke Center in Phoenix and 71% were transferred to another regional stroke center. The units to which the subjects were admitted were 103 out of 443 (23.3%) intensive care unit (ICU), 199 out of 443 (44.9%) Medical-Surgical Telemetry Unit, 41 out of 443 (9.3%) Discharged home, 4 out of 443 (0.9%) deceased, and 96 out of 443 (21.7%) Other/Unclassified.\n\nThe 90-day follow-up was conducted by neurology nurse research coordinators directly with subjects by telephone whenever feasible, by delegated caregivers or family members whenever necessary, and supplemented by paper and electronic medical records from health care providers. A 90-day follow-up was successfully conducted for 310 out of 443 (70.0%) of subjects. The subjects' 90 days Modified Rankin Score and Barthel Index Score are presented in .\n\nTable 6.\n\nModified Rankin ScoreN3100-No symptoms at all 80 (25.7%)1-No significant disability95 (30.5%)2-Slight disability32 (10.3%)3-Moderate disability43 (13.8%)4-Moderately severe disability27 (8.7%)5-Severe disability6 (1.9%)6-Death28 (9.0%)\n\nBarthel Index-Total ScoreN283Mean (SD)88.9 (22.3)Median100.0Q1, Q390.0, 100.0Range(0.0-100.0)\n\nPlace of residence, for those subjects with 90 days follow-up, was distributed as follows: House/Apartment (independent) 64.0%, House/Apartment (dependent) 28.6%, Nursing Home/Extended Care Facility 2.8%, Assisted Living Facility 1.1%, Rehabilitation Facility 3.2%, and Other not classified 0.3%. The living status in those subjects with 90-day follow-up data was 91.6% alive, 8.4% deceased.\n\nDiscussion\n\nAs specified at the beginning of this article, the original Arizona telestroke network celebrated its 10th year anniversary in 2021, inspiring inspection and publication of the original trial data, assessment of how successfully the original objectives were met, recognizing all the subsequent developments built on the network's foundational learning, and taking a glance forward to the future.\n\nThe STARR trial objective was to assess the feasibility of prospective collection, recording, and regularly analyzing telestroke patient consultations and care data for the purposes of establishing quality measures, improvement, and benchmarking against other national and international telestroke programs.\n\nThe success of STARR included the recruitment of multiple disparate and geographically separated rural and remote hospitals to collaborate in a novel state-wide government funded digital health research study, development of telestroke service contracts, utilization of a centralized IRB for telemedicine research, adoption of a hybrid of in-person and virtual research trial teaching, learning, and ongoing communication as well as trial coordination, utilization of an evidence-based pragmatic telestroke clinical algorithm across the network, documentation of standardized data entry fields for telestroke clinical care and research, incorporation of stroke specialty trained fellows and nurse practitioners into telestroke practice and research, deployment and evaluation of a multitude of telemedicine technologies in a single trial, and acquisition of complete data through to the conclusion of subjects' hospitalization for stroke despite operating within different electronic medical records.7,8\n\nA weakness in STARR is the 133 out of 443 (30%) of subjects for whom 90-day follow-up data could not be determined. This was anticipated to be a potential issue given that subjects were generally residing in remote and rural communities in the state: Some were non-residents, some were vacationers, some were homeless, and some reported no permanent address.\n\nThe STARR network was very much comparable to the Finnish telestroke network (FIN) for benchmarking, as each was at the 2 years mark in 2011.9 Sixty one (FIN) and 100 (STARR) acute ischemic stroke subjects, respectively, had already received IV alteplase in the first 2 years of the programs. Mean age was comparable: 70 (FIN) and 69 (STARR). Fifty-one percent (FIN) and 50% (STARR) female, median and range of subjects' NIHSS were 10 and 3–26 (FIN) and 8 and 0–40 (STARR).\n\nTelestroke consultation duration was nearly identical, 25 min (FIN) and 24 min (STARR). Mean onset to treatment time and SD was 130 and 45 min (FIN) and 165 and 45 min (STARR). The proportion of telestroke patients who received IV alteplase was higher (61/106 (57.5%)) in Finland and relatively lower (100/443 (22.6%)) in STARR. However, a higher percentage of patients in FIN versus STARR had acute ischemic stroke versus non-cerebrovascular diagnoses. If one looked at the proportion of STARR patients with ischemic stroke who received IV alteplase, the result was 100 out of 234 (42.7%), which was more similar to FIN experience.\n\nSymptomatic intracranial hemorrhage post-thrombolysis was similar between these networks (6.7% (FIN) and 5.0% (STARR)). In hospital or end-of-stay mortality was 9.8% (FIN) and 8.4% (STARR). Forty-nine percent (FIN) and 56% (STARR) of telestroke patients had a favorable outcome.\n\nReasons to withhold IV alteplase were similarly reported across the two trials: mild or quickly resolving symptoms 49% (FIN), 45% (STARR), stroke <3 months 4% (FIN), 3% (STARR), dependent for activities of daily living (mRS >2) 4% (FIN & STARR), NIHSS >25 in 4% (FIN & STARR), intracranial hemorrhage on computed tomography (CT) 4% (FIN), 5% (STARR), INR >1.7 in 2% (FIN), 3% (STARR), history of diabetes and previous stroke 2% (FIN), 8% (STARR), uncontrolled hypertension 4% (FIN), and 7% (STARR).\n\nHowever, the trials differed in their respective reporting of etiologies other than stroke, resulting in withholding of IV alteplase 15% (FIN) and 37% (STARR) and symptom onset >3 h in 9% (FIN) and 26% (STARR), which may reflect trial differences in telestroke alert activation criteria and any pre-consultation screening protocols.\n\nThe NCCT head studies were acquired in all subjects and interpreted independently by a local spoke hospital radiologist and hub teleneurologist in 315 out of 443 (71.1%) and exclusively by the local spoke hospital radiologist in 128 out of 443 (28.9%).10,11\n\nWhen STARR is compared against a nationally agreed-on minimum data set of variables designed to evaluate new and existing telestroke networks and services, STARR achieved 14 out of 16 (88%) Suggestions for Measuring Telestroke Processes (lacking tracking transfers between facilities to understand the flow of patients, cost structure, and eventual outcomes, times of transfer, and arrival at destination facility), 23 out of 28 (82%) Suggestions for Measuring Telestroke Outcomes (lacking ambulatory status, percent of all patients seen in the ED with the initial diagnosis of stroke and, when available, the percent of all patients discharged with a stroke diagnosis, percent of stroke patients arriving in the ED within the 3- and 4.5-h time windows since last known well, and percent of all stroke patients within these windows in whom documentation does not include a reason for not treating with intravenous alteplase).\n\nSTARR achieved 2 out of 6 (33%) Suggestions for Measuring Patient and Provider Satisfaction (STARR included surveys of technology, however it was lacking a satisfaction and experience monitoring program including satisfaction with the provider and staff, interactions, as well as the overall experience), and 11 out of 12 (92%) Suggestions for Monitoring Telestroke Technology Quality (lacking recording of any telestroke interactions in which a violation of security or protected health information policies was suspected as a result of technical problems to be recorded, investigated, and corrected).12\n\nWhen STARR is compared against an internationally agreed-on minimum data set of variables designed to evaluate new and existing telestroke networks and services, STARR achieved 12 out of 12 (100%) Details about Telestroke Program/Network, 10 out of 10 (100%) Details about Initiating Hospital, 17 out of 17 (100%) Telestroke Consultation, 5 out of 7 (71%) Patient Characteristics (missing living arrangements before hospitalization and details regarding pre-notification), 5 out of 5 (100%) Presentation to hospital, 10 out of 10 (100%) General clinical care within first 24 h, 10 out of 10 (100%) Thrombolysis treatment, 13 out of 13 (100%) Endovascular treatment, 8 out of 8 (100%) Neurosurgery treatment, 7 out of 7 (100%) Processes of care beyond the first 24 h, 5 out of 5 (100%) Discharge information, and 6 out of 6 (100%) Post-discharge and follow-up.13\n\nBased on the preliminary learning from the STARR trial and contributions from other national and international pioneers in telestroke, there have been many advancements and developments in Mayo Clinic telestroke and acute care telemedicine in general. Regionally focused telestroke networks at Mayo Clinic have converged into one enterprise-wide national telestroke network.14,15 Simultaneous use of multiple telemedicine vendor technologies has given way to the selection of a single highest performing vendor.14\n\nSmall teams of telestroke doctors stretched to their limits have ultimately collaborated in a single large deep pool of telestroke doctors, each suitably trained, licensed, and credentialed in multiple states and health systems.16 Disparate and variable oversight, management, operations, and administration have yielded to a centralized medical and administrative leadership structure and commonly used evidence-based management guidelines.17 Sporadic and episodic data collection has given way to continuous quality assurance and quality improvement according to national and international criteria.12,13\n\nTelemedicine training programs for students, residents, fellows, and advanced practice providers are routinely available.18,19 Data from original telestroke networks have made health economic analyses possible.20–23 Prehospital telemedicine enabled ambulances and mobile stroke units complement the work of hospital-based telestroke networks.24 Since the learnings of 500 telestroke subjects in STARR, more than 32,000 telestroke patients have been assessed and treated at Mayo Clinic, enterprise wide.\n\nTelestroke has helped spawn acute care telemedicine in various other acute care clinical domains, including hospital neurology, neurosurgery, neurocritical care, sports concussion, emergency psychiatry, emergency medicine, pediatrics, neonatology, obstetrics, and gynecology to name a few.25–35 Other multicenter national and international acute care telemedicine research consortiums have developed and are conducting feasibility and efficacy trials.32 Telestroke has matured beyond its original focus in the ED and now exists across the continuum of care.36,37 The telemedicine network's existence, maturity, and stability helped greatly during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and eased the stress endured by our health care system.38–40"
