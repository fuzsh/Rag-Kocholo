        "text": "Elegant Nicole Kidman, known as one of Hollywood's top Australian imports, was actually born in Honolulu, Hawaii, while her Australian parents were there on educational visas.\n\nKidman is the daughter of Janelle Ann (Glenny), a nursing instructor, and Antony David Kidman, a biochemist and clinical psychologist. She is of English, Irish, and Scottish descent. Shortly after her birth, the family moved to Washington, D.C., where Nicole's father pursued his research on breast cancer, and then, three years later, made the pilgrimage back to her parents' native Sydney in Australia, where Nicole was raised. Young Nicole's first love was ballet, but she eventually took up mime and drama as well (her first stage role was a bleating sheep in an elementary school Christmas pageant). In her adolescent years, acting edged out the other arts and became a kind of refuge -- as her classmates sought out fun in the sun, the fair-skinned Kidman retreated to dark rehearsal halls to practice her craft. She worked regularly at the Philip Street Theater, where she once received a personal letter of praise and encouragement from audience member Jane Campion (then a film student). Kidman eventually dropped out of high school to pursue acting full-time. She broke into movies at age 16, landing a role in the Australian holiday favorite 40 Grad im Schatten (1983). That appearance touched off a flurry of film and television offers, including a lead in Die BMX-Bande (1983) and a turn as a schoolgirl-turned-protester in the miniseries Vietnam (1987) (for which she won her first Australian Film Institute Award). With the help of an American agent, she eventually made her US debut opposite Sam Neill in the at-sea thriller Todesstille (1989).\n\nKidman's next casting coup scored her more than exposure. While starring as Tom Cruise's doctor/love interest in the racetrack romance Tage des Donners (1990), she won over the Hollywood hunk hook, line and sinker. After a whirlwind courtship (and decent box office returns), the couple wed on December 24, 1990. Determined not to let her new marital status overshadow her fledgling career, the actress pressed on. She appeared as a catty high school senior in the Australian film Flirting - Spiel mit der Liebe (1991), then as Dustin Hoffman's moll in the gangster flick Billy Bathgate (1991). She reunited with Cruise for In einem fernen Land (1992), the story of young Irish lovers who flee to America in the late 1800s, and starred opposite Michael Keaton in the tear-tugger Mein Leben für dich (1993). Despite her steady employment, critics and moviegoers still had not quite warmed to Kidman as a leading lady. She tried to spice up her image by seducing Val Kilmer in Batman Forever (1995), but achieved her real breakthrough with Gus Van Sant's To Die For (1995). As a fame-crazed housewife determined to eliminate any obstacle in her path, Kidman proved that she had an impressive range and deadly comic timing. She took home a Golden Globe and several critics' awards for the performance. In 1996, Kidman stepped into a corset to work with her countrywoman and onetime admirer, Jane Campion, on the adaptation of Henry James's Portrait of a Lady (1996). A few months later, she tore across the screen as a nuclear weapons expert in Projekt: Peacemaker (1997), adding \"action star\" to her professional repertoire.\n\nShe and Cruise then disappeared into a notoriously long, secretive shoot for Stanley Kubrick's sexual thriller Eyes Wide Shut (1999). The couple's on-screen shenanigans prompted an increase in public speculation about their sex life (rumors had long been circulating that their marriage was a cover-up for Cruise's rumored homosexuality); tired of denying tabloid attacks, they successfully sued The Star for a story alleging that they needed a sex therapist to coach them through love scenes. Family life has always been a priority for Kidman. Born to social activists (mother was a feminist; father, a labor advocate), Nicole and her little sister, Antonia Kidman, discussed current events around the dinner table and participated in their parents' campaigns by passing out pamphlets on street corners. When her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, 17-year-old Nicole stopped working and took a massage course so that she could provide physical therapy (her mother eventually beat the cancer). She and Cruise adopted two children: Isabella Jane (born 1993) and Connor Antony (born 1995). Despite their rock-solid image, the couple announced in early 2001 that they were separating due to career conflicts. Her marriage to Cruise ended mid-summer of 2001.\n\nJoel Edgerton was born on June 23, 1974 in Blacktown, New South Wales, Australia, to Marianne (van Dort) and Michael Edgerton, who is a solicitor and property developer. His brother is filmmaker Nash Edgerton. His mother is a Dutch immigrant. Joel went to Hills Grammar School in the Western Suburbs of Sydney, and after leaving, he attended Nepean Drama School in 1994. Joel has done many projects on stage and off, but most people will recognize him from his work on the Australian television series The Secret Life of Us (2001), in which he played William McGill. This gave him his first big break through in the television industry. For this role, he was nominated in 2001 for an AFI Award. As well as \"The Secret Life of Us\", he has also appeared in other television projects such as Die 3 Stooges (2000), Dossa and Joe (2002), Secret Men's Business (1999), Janine - Wettkampf mit dem Schicksal (1998) and Saturn's Return (2001). Joel has done a lot of work on the theatrical stage having played King Henry in \"Henry V\", Prince Hal in \"Henry III\", and others including \"Road\", \"Third World Blues\" and \"Dead White Males\". As well as acting, he has also starred, co-written and produced the short movie Bloodlock (1998).\n\nHis first international break came from when he played Uncle Owen Lars in Star Wars: Episode II - Angriff der Klonkrieger (2002). Since then, he has also starred in Gesetzlos - Die Geschichte des Ned Kelly (2003), King Arthur (2004), Star Wars: Episode III - Die Rache der Sith (2005) and Kinky Boots (2005).\n\nTroye Sivan Mellet is South African-born YouTuber, actor, model and singer known for his roles in The Spud Franchise, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, and Der verlorene Sohn (2018). He moved to Perth, Australia when he was two years old. Troye has two brothers and a sister, and was raised Modern Orthodox. In 2018, his family moved to Melbourne. Troye lives in LA where he has a house. He has over 6.6 million subscribers on YouTube as of October 2018, with videos ranging from song covers to challenge videos to original songs and music videos. One of his earlier videos, a collaboration filmed with fellow YouTube star Tyler Oakley titled 'The Boyfriend Tag' even won a Kid's Choice award in 2014.\n\nOver the past couple of years, Troye has released two EPs, the one in 2014 being TRXYE and the one in 2015 being WILD. His unique blend of electro-pop and smooth melodies have taken him as high as number fifteen on Billboard's Social 50 list, which chronicles the most influential names in music today. Along with WILD and the lead single Talk Me Down off of his new album Blue Neighbourhood which came out on 4 December 2015, he released a trilogy of music videos titled Blue Neighbourhood.\n\nBoth of his EPs have debuted at number five on the Billboard Top 200, his album debuting at number seven and he has won several awards for his work, including most recently an EMA.\n\nMichael Peter Balzary was born on the sixteenth of October 1962, in Melbourne, Australia. When he was four, his parents divorced and Michael, his sister Karen and his mother Patricia headed for New York; they didn't stay long and soon ended up in L.A. (in 1972), where his step-father, a jazz musician named Walter Urban Jr., intended to start a career. Flea would often sit in on weekly jam sessions with his stepfather and the constant flow of musicians who trucked through. High school was not always an easy road for young Michael. He was a misfit because of his unusual musical taste. While most of the kids were into disco and dance music, Flea preferred jazz artists like Miles Davis and Dizzy Gillespie. Flea's first musical instrument was the drums, but soon he also began playing the trumpet. After school he would race home to listen to his Gillespie records and play along with his idol. He counts as his greatest childhood memory the time his mother got him back-stage to meet Gillespie after one of his concerts. He also played with the Los Angeles Junior Philarmonic Orchestra. Influenced by some of his friends from school who shared the same passion for music - among them, Jack Irons and Hillel Slovak, who would later play in the Red Hot Chili Peppers with him - his musical interests then diversified: he discovered funk music, and Jimi Hendrix became his new idol. At the end of 1977, he met Anthony Kiedis. For some reason, Michael was holding a young schoolmate named Tony Sherr in a headlock, when Kiedis, who was Tony's best friend at the time, came to rescue him; they almost had a fight. After this meeting, they soon became aware they were made to be friends, and have been inseparable since. The two became known for their mischievous antics, which often got them into trouble. This is also when he gained the nickname Flea, while he was joking with some friends about calling each other a cartoon name. Around 1979, due to Flea's obvious musical talent, he was sought out as a recruit for a band formed by his school-mates, Anthym, with Jack Irons (drums), Hillel Slovak (guitar) and Alain Johannes (vocals and guitar) as members. Flea picked up the bass, which he had never played before, and became so good that within a few months he had forged his very own style, which later would make him one of the most famous and talented bass players in the world. After a shaky start the band got a few club gigs but no major breaks. Anthony Kiedis, who was always there to support them, became the presenter of their shows which he opened with a few jokes or improvised poems of his own. In 1982, Flea joined the L.A. punk band Fear. He also landed a small role in the Penelope Spheeris film Suburbia (1984). John Lydon of PIL asked Flea to join his band when he left Fear in 1984, but Flea instead decided to rejoin his friends. With Kiedis, Slovak and Irons, they started another band together, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, which soon earned a good reputation in the Los Angeles underground music scene. Flea was married in 1985 to Loesha Zeviar, whose first name he got tattooed above his left nipple - close to his heart. They have since divorced, but still share daughter Clara, born on September 16, 1988. Clara sometimes goes on the road with her dad, and has done artwork for the Chili Peppers' t-shirts and promotional material. In 2001, along with friends Pete Weiss and Keith Barry, Flea founded the Silverlake Conservatory Of Music, an organization whose aim is to provide affordable music lessons to everyone and to encourage children's musical education.\n\nAccidentally walking into a theatre house instead of a classroom for journalism 101, Jesse LaTourette found a love for acting at school and never looked back. After performing as the title character in a five month boxing rendition of Hamlet in Seattle, WA, Jesse moved to Los Angeles in 2017 and booked her first film \"Boy Erased,\" starring opposite Joel Edgerton and Lucas Hedges.\n\nLearning from other incredible co-stars including Xavier Dolan, Flea, Troye Sivan and Nicole Kidman, Jesse discovered she had a passion for intimate, complex and multifaceted roles and stories that dive into what it means to be human. Reviews have called Jesse's performance in \"Boy Erased\" as \"harrowing\" as well as her character Sarah's world \"a story that needs to be explored.\" Soon after, Jesse booked a part in the lead ensemble \"There's Someone Inside Your House\" from Netflix, directed by Patrick Brice, as well as produced by Shawn Levy's 21 Laps Entertainment and James Wan's Atomic Monster Productions. The Covid pandemic delayed the film, but it finally got a release in October 2021.\n\nSince, Jesse has been breaking into the independent film scene. She stars in the upcoming indie project RAPT, directed by Margot Budzyna, which premiered at Mammoth Film Festival in March, 2024. It was just announced as an official selection at In The Palace ISFF, with another ISFF selection announcement coming soon.\n\nDavid Ditmore is an American actor known for playing characters that often live on the edge of their emotions.\n\nIn comedy roles, his characters are often a fish out of water type or somebody loosing control of their situation. In drama roles, his characters are often commanding authority or maintaining calm in the middle of chaos.\n\nWith 80+ credits in his career, David Ditmore has shared the screen with some well-known talent including: Robin Williams (Boulevard), Nicole Kidman (Boy Erased), Lucas Hedges (Boy Erased), Joel Edgerton (Boy Erased), Connie Britton (Nashville), Eric Close (Nashville), Powers Boothe (Nashville), and Eric Roberts (Deadline).\n\nDavid had an unexpected start to his career in acting. He shared this story about it on his website: I began my acting career as a child in Charleston, SC. My mom took me to an open call audition for a play to see how auditions worked. When we got there, they asked me to sign in - I wrote down my info- figuring it was a mailing list for future auditions - but actually I had just signed up to do a cold read audition while I was there. We went in the theater, took a seat and watched several auditions for about a half hour. Then my mom and I decided it was time to go, but just as we were getting up from our sets, they called my name up to audition. I was surprised because I was not prepared, nor knew what to do, but I went up on stage anyway. I told them a little about myself and read a few lines. They thanked me for my time and we left. My mom and I laughed about the whole experience all day, not thinking anything would come of it. But a few weeks later I got a letter saying I had been cast in the ensemble! I was thrilled and enjoyed the entire experience. And I that is how I unexpectedly started my career in acting.\n\nDuring the pandemic in 2020, he was cast as an actor for a film competing in the 48 Hour Film Project - but the director and team had to pull out of the competition at the last minute. Undeterred, David decided to make a film all by himself in just 2 days. He wrote, directed, shot, edited and starred in the film: \"Love Yourself\" - the short film won 3 awards in the competition and then arrived on the film festival circuit where it won an additional 9 awards.\n\nPeter Kujawski was appointed Chairman of Focus Features in February 2016. Focus Features acquires and produces specialty films for the global market, and is a premier label with a library of iconic movies from fearless filmmakers.\n\nKujawski, who is based in Los Angeles, was previously Managing Director of Universal Pictures International Productions (UPIP), which was absorbed into Focus' operations in early 2016. At UPIP, he was responsible for expanding Universal Pictures' worldwide presence through local production, financing partnerships, and acquisitions. He oversaw the acquisition of English-language films for Universal in all international territories.\n\nHe joined Universal in 2011 as Executive Vice President of Worldwide Acquisitions, where he oversaw acquisitions for both Universal and Focus. In this capacity, he acquired key international rights for commercially successful and critically-acclaimed films including Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street, Kathryn Bigelow's Zero Dark Thirty, and Richard Linklater's Boyhood. He was instrumental in the acquisition of domestic rights for Universal on Jaume Collet-Serra's Non-Stop and Focus on Jean-Marc Vallée's Dallas Buyers Club, which won three Academy Awards.\n\nKujawski had previously worked at Focus since the company's formation in 2002. He sold international rights on such celebrated films as Michel Gondry's Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind; Joel and Ethan Coen's Burn After Reading and A Serious Man; Jet Li's Fearless, directed by Ronny Yu, on which he was also a production executive; Sofia Coppola's Lost In Translation; Gus Van Sant's Milk; Fernando Meirelles' The Constant Gardener; David Cronenberg's Eastern Promises; and Ang Lee's Lust, Caution and Brokeback Mountain. In 2010, he was named Executive Vice President of International Sales for the company. His prior positions at Focus included Manager of Creative Affairs, which entailed involvement in production and distribution, and overseeing all soundtrack album rights and negotiations for such films as Alejandro González Iñárritu's 21 Grams.\n\nHe received his Bachelor of Arts Degree in Film Studies from Columbia University. Kujawski's industry career began at the independent film production company Good Machine, which was later absorbed into Focus Features.\n\nSaunder Jurriaans is a contemporary film composer writing alongside Danny Bensi. Born in Evanston, Illinois, in 1977, Jurriaans is the child of Dutch immigrants who bounced around the United States before settling in Seattle, Washington. After moving to Providence, RI ostensibly to study at the Rhode Island School of Design, Jurriaans instead dropped out to play in a band. Around the same time he met Danny Bensi for the first time, and the pair quickly became collaborators.\n\nAfter moving to New York in 2000, Jurriaans, Bensi and drummer Gregory Rogove formed the proggy, chamber-rock trio Tarantula, later renamed Tarantula A.D. and finally Priestbird. The scope of their music is best reflected in the eclectic range of bands they toured with, including Avant-jazz-funk band Medeski Martin & Wood, freak folk singer-songwriter Devendra Banhart, psychedelic duo Cocorosie and heavy-metal rockers, The Sword. In Europe, they opened for Pearl Jam.\n\nThe first film Jurriaans and Bensi composed the score for was 2010 drama Two Gates Of Sleep. The director, Alistair Banks Griffin, was a friend of Jurriaans' from Rhode Island School of Design. The new way of working came naturally to the pair. The critical applause for their debut soundtrack led to 'Danny and Saunder' to score the 2011 thriller Martha Marcy May Marlene, starring Elizabeth Olsen and Sarah Paulson, and from then their career snowballed. Over the last decade their music has soundtracked over 100 films and television shows.\n\nSaunder Jurriaans also writes music outside of the film world - his first solo record \"Beasts\" will be released on Decca records September 18, 2020. Jurriaans lives and works in Los Angeles, CA."
