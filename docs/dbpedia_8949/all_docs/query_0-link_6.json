        "text": "American folk singer (born 1981)\n\nMusical artist\n\nDevendra Obi Banhart (born May 30, 1981) is a Venezuelan singer-songwriter and visual artist. Banhart was born in Texas, and raised in Venezuela and California. In 2000, he dropped out of the San Francisco Art Institute to pursue a musical career. In 2002, Banhart released his debut album and is best known for his albums in the late 2000s such as Cripple Crow and Smokey Rolls Down Thunder Canyon. He has since expanded his career to incorporate his interest and training in the visual arts.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nBanhart was born in Houston, Texas, to a Venezuelan mother, María Eugenia Rísquez, and an American father, Robert Gary Banhart. His given name is a synonym for Indra, suggested by Indian religious leader Prem Rawat (whom Banhart's parents followed),[1] and his middle name Obi takes after Obi-Wan Kenobi, a Star Wars character.[2]\n\nHis parents divorced in 1983, after which Rísquez and he moved to Caracas, Venezuela.[3] Rísquez later remarried and when Banhart was age 14, his stepfather moved the family to Los Angeles, California.[3][4]\n\nIn 1998, Banhart began studying at the San Francisco Art Institute on a scholarship[3] while living in The Castro, San Francisco's \"gay\" district,[5] though he would often busk instead of attending class. He played his first musical show in a church at a gay wedding, performing Elvis Presley's \"Love Me Tender\" and the hymn \"How Great Thou Art\".[4]\n\nMusical career\n\n[edit]\n\nBanhart dropped out of college in 2000[3] and left San Francisco after the dot-com bubble bust worsened the city's economy.[4] That summer, he moved to Paris and began opening shows for indie rock bands such as Sonic Youth.[3] Banhart returned to the United States that fall and played music in San Francisco and Los Angeles, until he was discovered by Michael Gira, owner of Young God Records,[3] after Siobhan Duffy, Gira's wife, bought a copy of Banhart's demo CD The Charles C. Leary and gave it to Gira.[1]\n\nBanhart and Gira compiled an album from Banhart's recordings,[1] and in 2002, Oh Me Oh My, which was made up of short fragments,[6] was published by Young God Records and received favorable reviews.[7] He recorded two other albums and an EP for the label: Rejoicing in the Hands, Niño Rojo, and The Black Babies;[7] the releases had a simple acoustic sound.[5] Banhart changed to XL Recordings in 2005[7] and released Cripple Crow, which was recorded in Bearsville Studios, New York, and had a more elaborate sound.[5]\n\nBanhart's albums offer a variety of musical sounds, and he is often called the leader of the musical movement termed \"Freak Folk.\" His lyrics are fantastical, idealistic, and poetic with the occasional trace of innuendos.[8]\n\nIn 2005, Banhart collaborated with Antony and the Johnsons on the album I Am a Bird Now. He sings the introduction to the song \"Spiraling\" and plays guitar on \"You Are My Sister\" in which Boy George also appears. In 2005, Banhart was in a relationship with Bianca Casady of the band CocoRosie, with Banhart living with Casady and her mother Christina Chalmers at Chalmer's farm in Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, a Romani village in southern France.[9][10] Banhart's relationship with Casady ended in 2006. Banhart's 2007 album Smokey Rolls Down Thunder Canyon detailed his break up with Casady.[11]\n\nBanhart was the first artist to design a T-shirt for the Yellow Bird Project, in 2006. He chose to donate the profits from the sale of his T-shirt to the Teenage Cancer Trust.[12]\n\nFrom 2007 to 2008, Banhart was romantically linked to actress Natalie Portman, who is featured in the video for Banhart's song \"Carmensita\".[13][14]\n\nHe recorded his second album for XL Records, Smokey Rolls Down Thunder Canyon, at his home studio in Topanga, California.[7] The album charted on the Billboard 200 at number 115.[15] The album's song \"Lover\" was featured in the soundtrack of the movie Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist, which included a cameo appearance by Banhart.[16]\n\nBanhart has performed at Carnegie Hall[17] and the Hollywood Bowl opening for Gilberto Gil,[18] as well as at Bonnaroo and Coachella music festivals.[4] He founded a record label, Gnomonsong, with Andy Cabic of Vetiver, in 2005.[19] In 2007, he signed with Neil Young's manager Elliot Roberts, who also contributed vocals to Smokey Rolls Down Thunder Canyon.[1][20]\n\nBanhart released an album in 2008 entitled Surfing, with Megapuss – a collaborative project with Gregory Rogove and Fabrizio Moretti of The Strokes and Little Joy.[21]\n\nIn 2009, he signed to Warner/Reprise and released, What Will We Be.[22] Later that year, at the band's request, he produced a remix of Oasis' \"(Get Off Your) High Horse Lady\".[23] Along with \"Neighbors\", Banhart remixed the Phoenix song \"Rome\" from their 2009 album Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix.[24]\n\nOn September 4, 2009, Beck announced his second Record Club covers album, Songs of Leonard Cohen.

Banhart and Jon Beasley, who were credited as art directors for the album's artwork and packaging, were nominated for a Grammy in 2011 for Best Recording Package.[28]\n\nThe film Life During Wartime, directed by Todd Solondz, features a musical collaboration between Banhart and Beck. The song plays over the film's end credits. Banhart sings lead vocals while Beck adds backing vocals and also recorded the track. The lyrics were written by Solondz and the music by composer Marc Shaiman.[29]\n\nBanhart is an avid skateboarder. In March 2010, he broke a bone in his right leg while skating, only hours before a concert in Phoenix. This resulted in the cancellation of future shows in Utah and Colorado.\n\nIn 2011, he collaborated with Marisa Monte and Rodrigo Amarante on a version of the song \"Nú Com a Minha Música\" for the Red Hot Organization's most recent charitable album Red Hot + Rio 2. The album is a follow-up to the 1996 Red Hot + Rio.

Rex,[47][48][40][41][49] though in a 2004 interview Banhart stated that he was unaware of Tyrannosaurus Rex until after he began writing and recording music.[50]\n\nVisual art and other media\n\n[edit]\n\nDrawings by Banhart were featured in the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and in the Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels.[51][52]\n\nBanhart's drawings have also been featured in the Art Basel Contemporary Art Fair in Miami, Florida, the Mazzoli Gallery in Modena, Italy, Spain's ARCOmadrid. and the Andrew Roth Gallery in New York.[53]\n\nHis drawings were featured in MOCA's exhibit \"The Artist's Museum\", in which the works of influential Los Angeles based artists from the last 30 years were presented.
