GOLDSTEINS' ROSENBERG'S RAPHAEL-SACKS facebook.com/jewishexponent www.JewishExponent.com 2 MAY, 2019 BUSIS Sylvia A. Busis, age 94, on Wednesday, May 15, 2019. Wife of 71 years of Sidney (zâl). Mother of Neil, Richard (Judy Beck), James (Maureen Kelly) and William (Leslie Hall). Grandmother of David (Catherine Blauvelt), Anne (zâl), Hillary (Michael Palmieri), Sarah (Matthew Cohen), Deborah (Mathew Levine), Samuel, Ethan, Hannah, Abigail, Adam, Daniel and Molly. Great-grandfather of Ar- thur, Joshua, Noah and Diana. Sister of Dorothy Grinberg (zâl) and Miriam Hersh- man. Sylviaâs eventful life spanned almost a century. Born and raised in Pittsburghâs East End, she mostly grew up in the Depression and during World War II. She graduated from the University of Pittsburgh with a degree in English and then earned a masterâs degree in social work. Sylvia and Sidney met while at Pitt and were married in 1947. She worked as a medical social worker at Montefiore Hospit- al and for one year at the University of Pennsylvania until she started a family in 1951. While raising four rambunctious boys Sylvia simultaneously pursued a volunteer career as a lay leader in many Jewish com- munal organizations. Among these, she served as the President of the Hillel Jewish University Center and the chair of the Uni- versity of Pittsburgh Israel Heritage Room Committee. She was also particularly active in leadership roles at the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh and Rodef Shalom Con- gregation. She led the tours at Rodef Sha- lom and also served as a docent at the Uni- versity of Pittsburghâs Cathedral of Learning Nationality Classrooms. Over the course of her volunteer career she garnered numerous honors. For seven decades Sylvia and Sidney were true partners in all of their community work. Together they frequently traveled the world with the Jewish Federation and the American Jewish Joint Distribution Commit- tee to visit and assist Jewish communities in need. Those who worked with her will re- member her warmth, generosity and intelli- gence. Many female lay leaders in Pittsburghâs Jewish community considered her to be their mentor and role model as they began their involvement. Above all else, Sylvia was a devoted family matriarch, who deeply loved her husband, four sons and their wives, and then grandchildren and great-grandchildren, as well as her parents, uncles, aunts, sisters, brothers-in-law, sister- in-law, nephews, nieces and cousins. She was the bedrock of her family, always loving, supportive and helpful. All will cherish her memory. Services were held at Rodef Sha- lom Temple, Pittsburgh.

Mr. Fein- stein was a restauranteur and real estate de- veloper who was at the vanguard of Phil- adelphiaâs South Street renaissance in the 1970s and later a pioneer in Fishtownâs re- vitalization. He owned The Latest Dish on South Fourth Street, which he called âPhillyâs only true discotheque,â from 1976 until 1980. In 1998 he told Philadelphia City Paper, âThere was nothing â not hair, gender, sexu- al preference â the Latest Dish wasnât about.â Later, with Albert Facchiano, his partner of 33 years, he also opened the restaurant Rodz, which Philadelphia Magazine once named âthe best gay restaurant for straight people to visit.â In the 1990s he began investing heav- ily in properties in Fishtown as redevelop- ment started moving north from the Old City section, and moved there himself, living with Mr. Facchiano in a former church. He lived to see the neighborhood flourish economically and aggressive redevelopment move even farther north to Port Richmond. Mr. Fein- stein thrived on the real estate business and deal-making. He was recognized for his gen- erosity, and helped several people launch businesses from properties he owned. At the funeral service on April 14, his niece, Abbe Kohn, remembered his kindness to her and her husband, Douglas. âHis generosity was much more than money. When we moved back from Florida, Jerry gave up his house to us until our house on Second Street was completed. When I came back from Spain, Jerry let me live with him until I could figure out what I wanted to do with my life. When our new house was being built, he gave up his bedroom to Doug and me for two years. Even though he did not have kids, he treated us like we were his own.â He was also known for his very outgoing nature. At the funeral his niece, Ellen Jenkin, said of him, âHe loved to talk to everybody. Jerry would walk down the street, and everyone knew him. As a child, I thought to myself: âWho is this man, my uncle Jerry? He knows everyone wherever we go.â He would walk into any res- taurant he frequented, and just work the room. Even if he did not know you, he would still talk to you. It was always scary to go to a restaurant with Jerry because he would ask the waitstaff the most personal questions. It wasnât because he was nosy, he just loved to talk to people.â Mr. Feinstein was a collector of art and sculpture and loved to dance, spend time with his family and dine out at Famous 4 th Street Delicatessen, The Capital Grille, The Hinge CafÃ© and other Philadelphia restaurants. And while he traveled widely, he never thought of leaving Philadelphia. His nephew, Marc Getson, said at the funeral, âIn his later years, Jerry was not a fan of the long, cold winters. He would spend a week or two every winter in Florida just to get away. Every trip down, he would essentially waste a Realtorâs time looking to buy a winter home because deep down, he never had any inten- tion of spending time away from his city, family and friends.â Mr. Feinstein was born in Philadelphia on April 8 1940, the son of May Pollock Feinstein and Morris Feinstein. He was buried at Har Nebo Cemetery in Phil- adelphia. Besides Mr. Facchiano, he is sur- vived by his sister, Myra Getson, and many nieces, nephews, cousins, and friends.
