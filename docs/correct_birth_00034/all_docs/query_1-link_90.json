        "text": "Neil Young is one of the most recognizable and enduring figures in modern music history.\n\nThe combination of his totally unique voice, his deeply personal lyrics along with the wide range of instrumentation that he employs in creating his music makes for one of the most distinctive and compelling sounds in the world of popular music.\n\nWith a focus on Neil's younger days, 'After The Gold Rush' brings the closest sonic and visual performance to the real experience available. It’s all there...the voice, the sound, the songs and the sights.\n\nIn theatre settings, an 'After The Gold Rush' show includes awesome 3D visual elements bringing to life the psychedelia of the early 1970's west coast epoch. A virtual musical walk through of a very important time in popular music that should not be missed!\n\n'After The Gold Rush' is fronted by Andrew Sansone performing as “The Loner”. With over 20 years as a professional musician and playing multiple instruments Andrew provides audiences of all ages the dynamic and emotional musical experience that you would expect from Neil Young himself.\n\nThe backing band members are all professional seasoned musicians from the Greater Toronto area and have played literally 1000's of shows at various festivals, theatres and night clubs."
