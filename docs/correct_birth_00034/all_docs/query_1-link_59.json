        "text": "On July 2, 1996, Neil Young released his 22nd album, Broken Arrow. Recorded with his long-time running mates Crazy Horse, it was also the first record that Young had released since the death of David Briggs the previous fall. To break down all things Broken Arrow, two Neil Young devotees—Joel Berk and Scott Bunn—are here to answer the question: what is the purpose of Broken Arrow?\n\nIs On The Beach a bummer? Well, maybe. But it’s a brilliant bummer. To celebrate 50 years of the record, dig into an alternate version of the album, made up of rare live renditions and fireside sessions. Neil didn’t often return to many of these tunes onstage, but when he did, he gave them his all. Some of it is solo — “alone at the microphone;” elsewhere, Young is joined by CSN, Ben Keith and, most interestingly, Britfolk legend Bert Jansch, who shows up on a 2006 version of “Ambulance Blues.”\n\nNeil Young kept promising us that Archives Vol. 3 was coming in 2023 … but guess what? It was delayed. That’s OK, any Neil fan worth his/her/their salt is accustomed to the waiting game. And anyway, there was plenty to keep us occupied last year in Shakeyland — a return to touring (and subsequent live album); several”officialbootleg” releases; and ongoing shenanigans on the wild/wooly Archives website. This fourth annual Honey Slides mix gathers up some choice rarities that Neil has sprinkled throughout his site, alongside several cuts that have yet to see the official light of day. As always, a few honey slides won’t hurt.\n\nAs a followup to the Time Fades Away (Again) collection we shared earlier this year, break out the Jose Cuervo and get into one of the best audience tapes from Neil Young’s somewhat ill-fated early 1973 North American tour.\n\n“Neil was pretty strange on his big tour,” former road manager Leo Makota told Rolling Stone. “[He] was trying to get a certain sound out of the band that he apparently could never find. The band would jam at soundchecks in the afternoon and sound great. Then they’d come in and do the show at night and never make it.”\n\nIt’s time to get back into your compact disc collection, where untold bonus track treasures are waiting to be re-discovered. This time around, we’re checking out The Band in Woodstock, a tasty Dr. John / Nilsson collab and Neil Young & Crazy Horse burning down the barn.\n\nHallelujah, Neil Young is back on the road after a long pandemic delay — perhaps the man’s longest break from touring … ever? On his west coast solo tour, Neil is going (relatively) deep into his back catalog, playing some rarely heard numbers from the days that used to be.\n\n…a brilliantly raw snapshot, a weirdo masterpiece that trades the celebratory nature of most live albums for uncertainty, experimentation and feral wildness. To celebrate Time Fades Away’s golden anniversary, we’ve compiled an alternate version of the album. Some of it comes from the original Stray Gators tour, some of it comes from much later on. All of it captures the unhinged thrills of the original. Don’t be denied — listen in.\n\nWill the well ever run dry when it comes Neil Young live jams and rarities? God, I hope not. In recent years, Young has begun sporadically posting a selection of complete live gigs on his Archives site, spanning the from the late 1960s to the late 2010s. It’s been a welcome feast for Neil fanatics. For this mix, the third installation of our Honey Slides series, we’ve grabbed a few highlights (as well as a choice Barn jam) for your enjoyment. Stretching from 1976 to 2010, it’s all electric and leans heavily towards the darker, grittier side of Young’s material. Plenty of Crazy Horse, of course, but also the Stray Gators, Booker T. & the M.G.’s, the International Harvesters and more.\n\nIt’s been more than 50 years since Neil got together with Crazy Horse, but still — nothin’ else matters. Young has just released the Rick Rubin-produced World Record, his third album with the band in as many years, and the heart of the group remains the same as it was back in ’69: drummer Ralph Molina and bassist Billy Talbot, who together have provided the elemental rhythmic bedrock that Neil has relied on for all these years. Aquarium Drunkard caught up with Talbot from his South Dakota home to get the lowdown on the Horse’s past, present and future.\n\nNever underestimate Neil Young’s hype-building skills. He first teased Toast way back in the late 2000s, tantalizing fans with tales of a missing album recorded with Crazy Horse in San Francisco around the turn of the century. Now, after nearly a decade-and-a-half, Toast is finally here — and we can decide for ourselves whether it lives up to Shakey’s hype.\n\nAbsolute homegrown ephemera gold courtesy of a 1972 Germany documentary which finds Neil Young in a honey slide haze on his fabled Broken Arrow Ranch, work-shopping “Out on the Weekend” (endearingly amused by his own lyrics), and hanging with Elliot Roberts, the fellas, the dogs, and the cows.\n\nNeil Young’s Harvest turned 50 this month — and thanks to hits like “Heart of Gold” and “Old Man,” the 1972 LP remains one of the songwriter’s signature efforts. To hear it with fresh ears, step into the barn with Neil one more time and check out this decades-spanning, re-imagined version of the album, compiled out of ranch rambles, live arrangements, fireside sessions, and even a little chicken coop jam.\n\nAfter a somewhat, er, “shakey” start, the online home of the Neil Young Archives has hit its stride. The past year has seen an incredible array of previously unavailable material show up for subscribers to enjoy. Outtakes stretching back to the Buffalo Springfield days, full live shows available to stream, rare films … All this and Neil himself regularly answering your questions in the Letters to the Editor column. Suffice to say, if you’re a fan of the man, you should consider signing up for the Archives. Below, we’ve got a small sampler mix of some of the goodies — plus a few things that haven’t made it to the NYA just yet.\n\nCrazy Horse’s Frank “Poncho” Sampedro joined up with Neil Young in 1973 and remained firmly in place until 2014. He joins Aquarium Drunkard’s Tyler Wilcox for a look back at his time in the Horse—at times dosed, at times dazed, but always tapped into the mythic rock and roll spirit that drove the band.\n\nThis hour of Radio Free Aquarium Drunkard features a sampling of that good stuff: live cuts, b-sides, demos, outtakes, rarities and beyond, stretching from 1969 to 2020. There’s even a dance mix thrown in there for all the Cinnamon Girls out there. Fry up a few honey slides and enjoy."
