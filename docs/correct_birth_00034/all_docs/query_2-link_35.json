Young began performing as a solo artist in Canada in 1960, before moving to California in 1966, where he co-founded the band Buffalo Springfield along with Stephen Stills, and later joined Crosby, Stills & Nash as a fourth member in 1969.\n\nSong lyrics\n\n[edit]\n\nOh, to live on Sugar Mountain\n\nWith the barkers and the colored balloons,\n\nYou can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain\n\nThough you're thinking that\n\nYou're leaving there too soon,\n\nYou're leaving there too soon.\n\nSugar Mountain (1969)\n\nDid you see them in the river?\n\nThey were there to wave to you.\n\nCould you tell that the empty quiver,\n\nBrown skinned Indian on the banks\n\nThat were crowded and narrow,\n\nHeld a broken arrow?\n\nBroken Arrow, from Buffalo Springfield Again (1967)\n\nThere you stood on the edge of your feather\n\nExpecting to fly.\n\nWhile I laughed, I wondered whether\n\nI could wave goodbye\n\nKnowin' that you'd gone.\n\nExpecting to Fly, from Buffalo Springfield Again\n\nI gave to you, now, you give to me\n\nI'd like to know what you learned.\n\nThe sky is blue and so is the sea\n\nWhat is the color, when black is burned?\n\nI Am a Child, from Last Time Around (1968)\n\nThere is a town in north Ontario,\n\nWith dream comfort memory to spare,\n\nAnd in my mind I still need a place to go,\n\nAll my changes were there.\n\nHelpless, from Déjà Vu (1970)\n\nTin soldiers and Nixon's comin'.\n\nWe're finally on our own.\n\nThis summer I hear the drummin'.\n\nFour dead in Ohio.\n\nOhio, from 4 Way Street (1971)\n\nIf you guarantee the postage, I'll mail you back the key.\n\nThe Last Trip to Tulsa\n\nI've been looking for a woman to save my life\n\nNot to beg or to borrow\n\nA woman with the feeling of losing once or twice.\n\nI've Been Waiting for You\n\nA dreamer of pictures\n\nI run in the night.\n\nYou see us together,\n\nChasing the moonlight,\n\nMy cinnamon girl.\n\nCinnamon Girl\n\nYou take my hand,\n\nI'll take your hand\n\nTogether we may get away\n\nThis much madness is too much sorrow\n\nIt's impossible to make it today.\n\nDown by the River\n\nLook at Mother Nature on the run\n\nIn the nineteen seventies.\n\nAfter the Gold Rush\n\nI was lying in a burned out basement\n\nWith the full moon in my eyes.\n\nI was hoping for replacement\n\nWhen the sun burst through the sky.\n\nThere was a band playing in my head\n\nAnd I felt like getting high.\n\nI was thinking about what a\n\nFriend had said\n\nI was hoping it was a lie.\n\nAfter the Gold Rush\n\nBut only love can break your heart\n\nTry to be sure right from the start\n\nYes only love can break your heart\n\nWhat if your world should fall apart?\n\nOnly Love Can Break Your Heart\n\nSouthern man better keep your head.\n\nDon't forget what your good book said.\n\nSouthern change gonna come at last\n\nNow your crosses are burning fast.\n\nSouthern man.\n\nSouthern Man\n\nDon't let it bring you down\n\nIt's only castles burning,\n\nJust find someone who's turning\n\nAnd you will come around.\n\nDon't Let It Bring You Down\n\nWhen you dance,\n\nDo your senses tingle?\n\nThen take a chance?\n\nIn a trance,\n\nWhile the lonely mingle\n\nWith circumstance?\n\nWhen You Dance I Can Really Love\n\nHarvest (1972)\n\n[edit]\n\nSee the lonely boy, out on the weekend,\n\nTryin' to make it pay.\n\nCan't relate to joy, he tries to speak and\n\nCan't begin to say.\n\nOut On The Weekend\n\nWill I see you give\n\nMore than I can take?\n\nWill I only harvest some?\n\nAs the days fly past\n\nWill we lose our grasp\n\nOr fuse it in the sun?\n\nDid she wake you up\n\nTo tell you that\n\nIt was only a change of plan?\n\nDream up, dream up,\n\nLet me fill your cup\n\nWith the promise of a man.\n\nHarvest\n\nI've been to Hollywood\n\nI've been to Redwood\n\nI crossed the ocean\n\nFor a heart of gold.\n\nI've been in my mind,\n\nIt's such a fine line\n\nThat keeps me searching\n\nFor a heart of gold.\n\nAnd I'm getting old.\n\nHeart of Gold\n\nOld man look at my life,\n\nTwenty four\n\nAnd there's so much more\n\nLive alone in a paradise\n\nThat makes me think of two.\n\nOld Man\n\nOld man take a look at my life\n\nI'm a lot like you.\n\nI need someone to love me\n\nThe whole day through.\n\nAh, one look in my eyes\n\nAnd you can tell that's true.\n\nOld Man\n\nI've seen the needle and the damage done.\n\nA little part of it in everyone.\n\nBut every junkie's like a settin' sun.\n\nThe Needle and the Damage Done\n\nIf I was a junkman selling you cars,\n\nWashing your windows and shining your stars,\n\nThinking your mind was my own in a dream\n\nWhat would you wonder and how would it seem?\n\nLiving in castles a bit at a time\n\nThe King started laughing and talking in rhyme.\n\nSinging words, words between the lines of age.\n\nWords, words between the lines of age.\n\nWords (between the lines of age)\n\nA while ago somewhere I don't know when\n\nI was watching a movie with a friend\n\nI fell in love with the actress\n\nShe was playing a part that I could understand\n\nA maid\n\nA man needs a maid\n\nOh, baby, that's hard to change,\n\nI can't tell them how to feel,\n\nSome get stoned, some get strange,\n\nBut sooner or later, it all gets real.\n\nWalk on.\n\nWalk on.\n\nWalk On\n\nWell, I hear that Laurel Canyon is full of famous stars,\n\nBut I hate them worse than lepers and I'll kill them in their cars.\n\nRevolution Blues\n\nYou can really learn a lot that way,\n\nIt will change you in the middle of the day,\n\nThough your confidence may be shattered,\n\nIt doesn't matter.\n\nFor the Turnstiles\n\nThe world is turning,\n\nI hope it don't turn away.\n\nOn the Beach\n\nWell, all those people, they think they've got it made,\n\nBut I wouldn't buy, sell, borrow or trade\n\nAnything I have to be like one of them.\n\nI'd rather start all over again.\n\nMotion Pictures\n\nI guess I'll call it sickness gone,\n\nIt's hard to say the meaning of this song.\n\nAmbulance Blues, referring to the drug related death of bandmate Danny Whitten\n\nYou're all just pissin' in the wind,\n\nYou don't know it but you are.\n\nAmbulance Blues\n\nZuma (1975)\n\n[edit]\n\nI have seen you in the movies,\n\nAnd in those magazines at night.\n\nI saw you on the barstool,\n\nWhen you held that glass so tight.\n\nBarstool Blues\n\nHe came dancing across the water with his galleons and guns\n\nLooking for the new world in that palace in the sun\n\nCortez The Killer\n\nOn the shore lay Montezuma with his coca leaves and pearls\n\nIn his halls he often wondered of the secrets of the worlds....\n\nThe women all were beautiful, the men stood straight and strong\n\nThey offered life in sacrifice so that others could go on\n\nHate was just a legend, war was never known\n\nThe people worked together and they lifted many stones.\n\nCortez The Killer\n\nA sparkle was in his eye, but his life was in his hand.\n\nTonight's the Night\n\nWell, people let me tell you, it sent a chill up and down my spine,\n\nWhen I picked up the telephone and heard that he'd died out on the mainline.\n\nTonight's the Night\n\nOh tell me where the answer lies,\n\nIs it in the notebook behind your eyes?\n\nSpeakin' Out\n\nAnd the world on a string doesn't mean a thing.\n\nWorld On A String\n\nI'm singin' this borrowed tune I took from the Rolling Stones,\n\nAlone in this empty room, too wasted to write my own.\n\nBorrowed Tune\n\nThink I'll roll another number for the road,\n\nI feel able to get under any load,\n\nThough my feet aren't on the ground,\n\nI've been standing on the sound\n\nOf some open-hearted people going down.\n\nRoll Another Number (For The Road)\n\nI'm not going back to Woodstock for a while,\n\nThough I long to hear that lonesome hippie smile,\n\nI'm a million miles away from that helicopter day,\n\nNo, I don't think I'll be goin' back that way.\n\nRoll Another Number (For The Road)\n\nI've been flyin' down the road,\n\nAnd I've been starvin' to be alone,\n\nIndependent from the scene that I've known.\n\nAlbuquerque\n\nHe tried to do his best but he could not.\n\nTired Eyes\n\nPlease take my advice, please take my advice,\n\nOpen up the tired eyes,\n\nOpen up the tired eyes.\n\nTired Eyes\n\nYou are like a hurricane\n\nThere's calm in your eye.\n\nAnd I'm gettin' blown away\n\nTo somewhere safer\n\nWhere the feeling stays.\n\nI want to love you but\n\nI'm getting blown away.\n\nLike a Hurricane\n\nIt's a cold bowl of chili when love lets you down.\n\nSaddle Up the Palomino\n\nIt's gonna take a lotta love\n\nTo change the way things are\n\nIt's gonna take a lotta love\n\nOr we won't get too far.\n\nLotta Love\n\nIt's gonna take a lotta love\n\nTo get us through the night\n\nIt's gonna take a lotta love\n\nTo make things work out right.\n\nLotta Love\n\nMy my, hey hey\n\nRock and roll is here to stay.\n\nIt's better to burn out\n\nThan to fade away.\n\nMy my, hey hey.\n\nHey Hey, My My, written with Jeff Blackburn; quoted by Kurt Cobain in his suicide note.\n\nWhere the eagle glides ascending\n\nThere's an ancient river bending\n\nThrough the timeless gorge of changes\n\nWhere sleeplessness

finger\n\nCover me with the thought\n\nThat pulled the trigger\n\nThink of me\n\nAs one you'd never figured\n\nWould fade away so young\n\nWith so much left undone.\n\nPowderfinger\n\nLive music is better! Bumper stickers should be issued!\n\nUnion Man\n\nWhen I was a younger man,\n\nGot lucky with a rock 'n' roll band,\n\nStruck gold in Hollywood,\n\nAll the time I knew I would\n\nGet back to the country,\n\nBack where it all began.\n\nGet back to the country,\n\nBack in the barn again.\n\nGet Back To The Country\n\nThe economy was getting so bad, I had to lay myself off.\n\nOld Ways\n\nFreedom (1989)\n\n[edit]\n\nThere's colors on the street\n\nRed, white and blue\n\nPeople shufflin' their feet\n\nPeople sleepin' in their shoes\n\nBut there's a warnin' sign\n\nOn the road ahead\n\nThere's a lot of people sayin'\n\nWe'd be better off dead.\n\nDon't feel like Satan,\n\nBut I am to them.\n\nSo I try to forget it,\n\nAny way I can.\n\nRockin' in the Free World\n\nWe got a thousand points of light\n\nFor the homeless man.\n\nWe got a kinder, gentler,\n\nMachine gun hand.\n\nWe got department stores\n\nAnd toilet paper\n\nGot styrofoam boxes\n\nFor the ozone layer.\n\nGot a man of the people,\n\nSays keep hope alive\n\nGot fuel to burn,\n\nGot roads to drive.\n\nRockin' in the Free World\n\nWeld (1991)\n\n[edit]\n\nWelfare mothers make better lovers.\n\nWelfare Mothers\n\nI never believed in much,\n\nBut I believed in you.\n\nFrom Hank to Hendrix\n\nNeed distraction\n\nNeed romance and candlelight\n\nNeed random violence\n\nNeed entertainment tonight\n\nNeed the evidence\n\nWant the testimony of\n\nExpert witnesses\n\nOn the brutal crimes of love.\n\nI'm the Ocean\n\nGreendale (2003)\n\n[edit]\n\nAnd we'll be watching you\n\nNo matter what you do\n\nAnd you can do your part\n\nBy watchin' others too.\n\nLeave the Driving\n\nQuotes about\n\n[edit]\n\nNeil, you know, was this rock & roller who was coming around to folk music through Bob Dylan. Of course. Anyway, Neil came out to the club, and we liked him immediately. He was the same way he is now – this offhanded, dry wit. And you know what his ambition was at the time? He wanted a hearse, and a chicken farm. And when you think of it, what he’s done with his dream is not that far off. He just added a few buffalo. And a fleet of antique cars. He’s always been pretty true to his vision.\n\nJoni Mitchell Interview with Rolling Stone (1979)\n\nWikipedia has an article about:\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to:\n\nNeil Young official website"
