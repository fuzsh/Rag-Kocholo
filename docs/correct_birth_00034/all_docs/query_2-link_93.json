        "text": "Neil Young 1969, hand-drawn portrait of him wearing a Florida Southern College sweatshirt at the home of Peter Tork in early August 1969 age 24; CSN&Y were rehearsing there for their upcoming gig at Woodstock.\n\nNeil Percival Young (born November 12, 1945) is a Canadian-American singer and songwriter.\n\nAfter embarking on a music career in Winnipeg in the 1960s with his first group, The Squires, Young moved to Los Angeles, joining the folk-rock group Buffalo Springfield with Stephen Stills.\n\nBuffalo Springfield performed at Florida Southern College, along with the Beach Boys and Strawberry Alarm Clock in April, 1968 at Jenkins Field House.\n\nA group of students took some FSC sweatshirts to give to the band.\n\nLooks like Neil kept his and wore it a year later at Tork’s house.\n\nYoung reunited with Stephen Stills by joining Crosby, Stills & Nash, who had already released one album Crosby, Stills & Nash as a trio in May 1969.\n\nYoung was originally offered a position as a sideman, but agreed to join only if he received full membership, and the group – winners of the 1969 Best New Artist Grammy Award – was renamed Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young.\n\nThe quartet debuted in Chicago on August 16, 1969, and later performed at the famous Woodstock Festival, during which Young skipped the majority of the acoustic set and refused to be filmed during the electric set.\n\nYoung’s tenure with CSNY coincided with the band’s most creative and successful period, and greatly contributed to his subsequent success as a solo artist.\n\nYoung wrote “Ohio” following the Kent State massacre on May 4, 1970. The song was quickly recorded by CSNY and immediately released as a single, even though CSNY’s “Teach Your Children” was still climbing the singles charts.\n\n#NeilYoung, #NeilYoung1969, #BuffaloSpringfield, #MusicArt, #PaulKing, #PaulKingArtwerks, PaulKingArt.com\n\nDescription\n\nAll prints are produced using Giclee printing process which is used for archival art reproduction.
