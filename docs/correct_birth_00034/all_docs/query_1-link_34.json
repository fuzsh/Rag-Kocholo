        "text": "For more than five decades, Neil Young has moved audiences with his emotional love ballads, raging rock 'n' roll hits, fiery protest songs, guitar mastery, and thought-provoking lyrics confronting topics such as racism and police violence.\n\nAn outspoken environmentalist, the legendary singer, songwriter, and guitarist is a cofounder of Farm Aid, a concert series whose mission is to keep family farmers on the land. Young was also instrumental in the creation of the Bridge School, an internationally recognized organization educating children with severe speech and physical impairments through the use of innovative approaches to education and augmentative and alternative communication systems and assistive technology. Young has two sons with cerebral palsy and was himself stricken with polio when he was six.\n\nAfter living in the United States for more than half a century, the Toronto-born artist applied for American citizenship, becoming a “proud Canarican” so he could vote in the 2020 presidential election. He has been outspoken against the role that corporate money plays in politics.\n\n“Everybody is an individual in this country and it’s a great country,” he told Dan Rather in 2016. “And I truly believe that at the soul of the whole thing is people, not corporations, so it bothers me to see corporations usurping what should be the vote of the people.”\n\nRolling Stone magazine named Young No. 34 in its ranking of the “100 Greatest Artists” of the rock 'n' roll era. He has two Grammy Awards (and 27 nominations) and nine Juno Awards (and 31 nominations). The Canadian Hall of Fame and two-time Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductee has been honored as a soloist as well as for his work with such bands as Buffalo Springfield, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, and Crazy Horse.\n\nIn late 2021, Young told an interviewer for Apple Music, “There’s nothing more important than making sure that the Earth is as good as it can be for our grandchildren.”"
