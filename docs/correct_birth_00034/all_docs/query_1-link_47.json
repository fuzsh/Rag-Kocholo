        "text": "Neil Percival Young, OC, OM (born November 12, 1945) is a Canadian singer-songwriter who is widely regarded as one of the most influential musicians of his generation.\n\nYoung began performing as a solo artist in Canada in 1960, before moving to California in 1966, where he co-founded the band Buffalo Springfield along with Stephen Stills and Richie Furay, and later joined Crosby, Stills & Nash as a fourth member in 1969. He forged a successful and acclaimed solo career, releasing his first album in 1968; his career has since spanned over 40 years and 34 studio albums, with a continual and uncompromising exploration of musical styles. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame website describes Young as \"one of rock and rollâ€™s greatest songwriters and performers\". He has been inducted into the Hall of Fame twice: first as a solo artist in 1995, and second as a member of Buffalo Springfield in 1997.\n\nRIYL[]\n\nKraftwerk\n\nThe Moog Cookbook\n\nDEVO\n\nCrazy Horse\n\nBuffalo Springfield\n\nThe Hollies\n\nThe Byrds\n\nMember of[]\n\nThe Mynah Birds\n\nBuffalo Springfield\n\nCrosby, Stills, Nash & Young\n\nNeil Young & Crazy Horse\n\nNeil Young & The Stray Gators\n\nNeil Young & The Shocking Pinks\n\nBiography[]\n\nNeil Young started his career as a member of the Mynah Birds in Canada (along with some of the members of what would become Buffalo Springfield and Rick James), which ended up changing into Buffalo Springfield with members of Poco after Rick James was arrested for being AWOL. After Buffalo Springfield broke up, he joined Crosby, Stills & Nash to make it Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. After they broke up, he went solo with some of his backing bands. For most of his career, he was mainly known as a Folk Rocker, though after signing with Geffen, he started experimenting with electronic music (with Trans), and rockabilly, among other genres. This prompted Geffen to sue him for not making representative music (or, essentially, not making \"Neil Young\" records). The case was thrown out (as any record Neil Young makes is, by definition, what a Neil Young record sounds like). Neil Young has also made four films (including Human Highway, co-starring Dean Stockwell, Russ Tamblyn and DEVO, and the recent Greendale).\n\nDiscography[]\n\nAlbums[]\n\nStudio[]\n\nNeil Young\n\nEverybody Knows This Is Nowhere (with Crazy Horse)\n\nAfter the Gold Rush\n\nHarvest (with The Stray Gators)\n\nTonight's the Night (with The Santa Monica Flyers)\n\nOn the Beach\n\nZuma (with Crazy Horse)\n\nLong May You Run (with Stephen Stills as the \"Stills-Young Band\")\n\nAmerican Stars'n'Bars\n\nComes A Time\n\nRust Never Sleeps (with Crazy Horse)\n\nHawks and Doves\n\nRe-ac-tor (with Crazy Horse)\n\nTrans\n\nEverybody's Rockin' (with Shocking Pinks)\n\nOld Ways\n\nLanding on Water\n\nLife (with Crazy Horse)\n\nThis Note's For You (with The Bluenotes)\n\nFreedom\n\nRagged Glory (with Crazy Horse)\n\nHarvest Moon\n\nSleeps With Angels (with Crazy Horse)\n\nMirror Ball (with Pearl Jam)\n\nBroken Arrow (with Crazy Horse)\n\nSilver & Gold\n\nAre You Passionate?
