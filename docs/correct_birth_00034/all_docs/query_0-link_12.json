Its follow-up, Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere (1969), teamed Young with the garage band Crazy Horse. When nascent FM radio played “Cinnamon Girl,” whose one-note guitar solo encapsulated Young’s sly sarcasm about established forms, and “Down by the River,” a long, raw-edged guitar blitzkrieg around lyrics about murder, the album made Young an icon.\n\nSoon he joined Crosby, Stills and Nash, who had already released their first hit album. Young added heft, but Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young was an ongoing clash of egos. Following the release of the quartet’s first album, Déjà Vu (1970), Young penned and sang “Ohio,” an anthem that rallied campus activists after National Guardsmen killed four antiwar demonstrators at Kent State University, Kent, Ohio, in May 1970.\n\nThe world of songwriting would sound very different without him, a tell-tale sign of someone who’s established a lasting legacy. Enjoy \n\n1. Old Man \n2. Heart of Gold \n3. Down by the River \n4. Cortez The Killer \n5. Rockin’ in the Free World\".",
