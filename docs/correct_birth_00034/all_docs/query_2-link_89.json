        "text": "Perhaps the most unexpected thing about Young is that he loves model trains. Young, who has said trains were a way to connect with his son Ben, is such an avid model train enthusiast that he became a co-owner of Lionel Trains in the mid-1990s. Young helped the company develop innovative, simplified controls so other children with disabilities could enjoy them, too. Young even saved Lionel from bankruptcy in 2008.\n\nIn 2017, Young auctioned off part of his model train collection, raising $300,000, a portion of which he donated to the Bridge School.\n\nOne of rock's most famous legends involves Young playing his album Harvest for former bandmate Graham Nash. Young rowed the two of them to the middle of a lake on his ranch and began playing the album, using the stereo in his house as the left speaker channel and the stereo in his barn as the right.\n\nIn 2013, Nash told the story to NPR's Fresh Air:\n\n[Neil] has his entire house as the left speaker and his entire barn as the right speaker. And I heard Harvest coming out of these two incredibly large speakers louder than hell. It was unbelievable. Elliot Mazer, who produced Neil, produced Harvest, came down to the shore of the lake and he shouted out to Neil, \"How was that, Neil?\" I swear to God, Neil Young shouted back, \"More barn!\"\n\nThe supposed bad blood between Young and Lynyrd Skynyrd was one of rock's first real beefs. After all, the Canadian rocker had the audacity to criticize the American South's history of slavery and racism in songs like \"Southern Man\" and \"Alabama,\" to which the boys from Skynyrd allegedly took umbrage and wrote the famous lines:\n\nWell, I heard Mister Young sing about her\n\nWell, I heard ol' Neil put her down\n\nWell, I hope Neil Young will remember\n\nA Southern man don't need him around anyhow\n\nTurns out, the media made more of the spat than the musicians did. Skynyrd singer Ronnie Van Zant wore a Neil Young shirt on the cover of Skynyrd's 1977 album, Street Survivors, and Young covered \"Sweet Home Alabama\" in concert with their blessing.\n\nBefore his death, Van Zant clarified, \"We wrote 'Sweet Home Alabama' as a joke. We didn't even think about it. The words just came out that way. We just laughed like hell and said, 'Ain't that funny.' We love Neil Young. We love his music.\"\n\nNot only were Neil Young and Rick James in a band together, but they also shared a Toronto apartment for a time. The two were part of an R&B group called the Mynah Birds in the mid-'60s. Young recalled:\n\nRicky James Matthews, as he was called then, was our lead singer, and he was known as the Black Mick Jagger. He sang his ass off. Living with Rick in a basement apartment on Isabella, near Yorkville Village, I became introduced to other drugs. I was trying amphetamines and smoking a little hash. Looking back, I could have gone a lot deeper. Luckily I didn't get too far in the stronger drugs.\n\nOtherwise, Young typically claims he doesn't remember much about those days. He later told Howard Stern his time as James's roommate was \"all very hazy.\"\n\nBefore becoming one of history's most notorious criminals, Charles Manson was a failed musician turned twisted hippie messiah. But what if he had made it as a musician? Would the infamous Manson Family Murders still have happened?\n\nNo one can say for sure, but Young did encounter Manson during the cult leader's days as a struggling musician. Young had a run-in with Manson at Dennis Wilson's house and thought Manson was a decent musician after jamming with him. Young even suggested to an A&R representative at Reprise Records that they sign him. In his autobiography, Young recalled:\n\nI told Mo Ostin at Reprise about [Charlie] and recommended that Reprise check him out. Terry Melcher was a producer at that time who made some very influential hit records. Apparently Melcher had already been checking out Charlie and decided not to go for it.\n\nShortly afterward, the Sharon Tate-LaBianca murders happened, and Charlie Manson's name was suddenly known around the world. We couldn't believe we had played with him.\n\nIn 1951, at age 5, Neil Young contracted polio during a major outbreak in Ontario. That year, 1,701 cases of polio were reported in that province alone (there were 2,568 cases nationwide in Canada). Luckily, Young survived.\n\nIn his 2012 autobiography, Waging Heavy Peace, Young said, \"In my life I have had various health threats: polio, seizures, a brain aneurysm. None of these things has really changed me much, although it is hard to say for sure. These are events that are part of my life. They make me who I am. I am thankful for them. They are scary.\""
