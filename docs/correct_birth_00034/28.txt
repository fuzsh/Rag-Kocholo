Living rock legend NEIL YOUNG

was born on 12 November 1945 in

Toronto, Canada.

Happy 78 to the imperishable singer-songwriter. He released about a thousand albums since 1963. He worked solo, he regularly recorded with his pals Crazy Horse and played a couple of years, a long time ago, with three other memorable voices, Crosby Stills & Nash and with Buffalo Springfield.

And he’s not finished yet. His Archives seem

to be inexhaustible. And he still performs live.

Keep on rockin’ in the free world, Neil.
