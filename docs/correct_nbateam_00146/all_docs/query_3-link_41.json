Brother to a traded teammate, owner to a broken low-powered motorcycle. And I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next!\n\nFile under \"Things You'll Never Hear,\" Joan.\n\nWith Stephen Jackson(notes) traded, it appears as though Monta Ellis, the Warriors' young leading scorer, is the new irritated Dub on the block.\n\nThat's right. If you thought Ellis was going to pull up his socks and take on a little more responsibility ... well, think again. The kid wants nothing to do with being a leader in Golden State, and I can't say that I really blame him.\n\nEllis, in an interview with Marcus Thompson II of the Contra Costa Times:\n\nAnd as if that wasn't enough bus throwin' for one interview, Ellis thinks he is the only player left on the team that plays defense. Yes, defense. Monta Ellis.\n\nIf you find yourself alone, playing basketball in the green fields with the sun on your face, do not be troubled. For you are in Golden State, and you're already dead!\""
