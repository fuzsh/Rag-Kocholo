        "text": "[jwplayer o7Lvs2Es-z6KDnl0B]\n\nAs 22 teams prepare to finish the NBA season in the Orlando Bubble, the Golden State Warriors will have the opportunity to turn their attention to the draft.\n\nFor the first time since 2002, the Warriors will have the opportunity to own a top-five pick. As draft season starts to heat up, Bob Myers and Steve Kerr still have months to prepare before they’re on the clock. Before they make their first-round choice, Warriors Wire is digging back through some of Golden State’s memorable draft days.\n\nDraymond Green’s name will always be listed as Golden State’s success story in the second round. However, before the Michigan State product landed in the Bay Area, the Warriors were fortunate finding another memorable playmaker outside of the first round.\n\nJune 28, 2005\n\nThe 2005 edition of the draft began with future Warrior Andrew Bogut getting selecting first overall by the Milwaukee Bucks. Jumping to the No. 9 overall pick, Golden State drafted Ike Diogu out of Arizona State.\n\nAlthough their first-round pick never lived up to the expectation, the Warriors made up for it in the second round. With the No. 40 overall selection, the Golden State Warriors landed Monta Ellis out of Lanier High School in Mississippi.\n\nIn his rookie season, Ellis averaged 6.8 points on 41.5 from the field. The high school product added 2.1 rebounds and 1.6 assists per game.\n\nWatch highlights from his rookie year via YouTube:\n\nWith his numbers doubling in his sophomore season, Ellis quickly skyrocketed to a fan favorite in the Bay Area. In his second year, the Mississippi State commit averaged 16.5 points and 4.1 assists per contest.\n\nAlongside Baron Davis and Jason Richardson in 2007, Ellis brought home the NBA’s Most Improved Player award. The explosive shooting guard was instrumental in Golden State’s “We Believe” campaign against the Dallas Mavericks. Ellis earned a bid to the NBA’s Rookie versus Sophomore game at All-Star Weekend.\n\nOutside of Bogut and Ellis, other notable members of the 2005 draft class included Deron Williams, Chris Paul, Danny Granger, Nate Robinson, David Lee and fellow second-round pick Lou Williams."
