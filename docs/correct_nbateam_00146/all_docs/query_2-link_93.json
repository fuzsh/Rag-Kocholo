        "text": "Monta Ellis hasn't played a minute in the NBA since the 2016-17 season. Yet the Indiana Pacers will still be paying him money through the end of the 2021-22 season.\n\nTo explain why this is the case, it is necessary to go back in time. The Pacers brought in Ellis to be a scorer that could compliment George Hill and Paul George in the backcourt.\n\n\"[Ellis] has proven to be one of the league's most prolific scorers year in and year out and his game fits perfectly with the style weâ€™re going to implement going forward.\"\n\nFormer Indiana Pacers Head Coach Frank Vogel (via NBA.com)\n\nEllis had averaged over 20 points per game across the previous eight seasons, so it made sense why the Pacers thought Ellis could be a big-time scorer for the blue and gold. But it was not to be.\n\nEllis didn't fit on the court at all. His usage dropped, and his effectiveness cratered along with it. On top of that, he was a nightmare off the floor. He clashed with teammates and was unhappy when removed from the starting lineup. It became painfully obvious that the Monta Ellis-Indiana Pacers experiment was a failure after only two seasons.\n\nEllis was waived as a result. But then a new problem surfaced. He was cut after two seasons, but in 2015 he signed a four-year deal. That meant the Pacers had two more seasons of Monta Ellis' money on the cap sheet.\n\nWell, sort of. While Ellis had two more seasons on his deal, the second was covered by a player option. Thanks to a heads-up contract quirk the Pacers put in the deal in 2015, Ellis was not allowed to opt in to said option early, which meant that season remained an \"option year\" when Indiana decided to cut ties with him. So Ellis had two years, $22.9 million remaining on his deal when he was cut, but only $11.2 million was actually set to be paid out to him.\n\nJust before the conclusion of the 2016-17 season is when Kevin Pritchard took over as the teams President of Basketball Operations. Pritchard knew that Ellis didn't fit in Indiana from his time under Larry Bird, that's why Ellis was waived. But then Pritchard was faced with another decision. He could either pay out the reamaining $11.2 million to Ellis in one season, or he could \"stretch\" that amount out and pay it out in smaller installments over more seasons.\n\nThis is done by using something called the \"stretch provision\", which takes the cap hit of a waived player and stretches it out over multiple seasons. The number of seasons that money can be stretched is calculated by taking the number of years remaining on a contract, doubling it, and adding one. For the years portion of this calculation, a year covered by a Player Option is included, even if the salary from that year isn't, as in this case.\n\nEllis' contract only had one more guaranteed season of money left, but technically the deal had two years remaining on it for stretch provision purposes. That means that waiving and stretching Monta Ellis would stretch out $11.2 million over five seasons.\n\nDoing so reduced Ellis' cap hit in the 2017-18 season from $11.2 million to $2.25 million, freeing up an extra ~$9 million in room. The extra cap room gave the Pacers enough space to sign Bojan Bogdanovic, which in hindsight was absolutely worth it. Bogdanovic was a key contributor for the team for two successful campaigns.\n\nBut now the Pacers have to pay Monta Ellis for three more seasons. Only two of the five years his contract was stretched over have been completed, so the Pacers still owe Ellis $6.7 million over the next three seasons and will pay him through the conclusion of the 2021-22 season.\n\nStretching Ellis' contract hurt. Seeing that deal on the salary cap sheet every summer is painful for fans of the Indiana Pacers. But it was a necessity to sign Bojan Bogdanovic and improve the roster. It may hurt to see the stretched money cutting into the Pacers cap space every offseason, but it was the right decision for the team."
