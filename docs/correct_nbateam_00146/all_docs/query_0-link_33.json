        "text": "Dallas Mavericks guard Monta Ellis might have left the Golden State, but the Warriors tattoo hasn't left him. And it never will.\n\nThe folks at Let's Go Warriors pointed out that Ellis still has a tattoo to honor the Golden State Warriors, the team he played his first six NBA seasons with.\n\nEllis was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks in 2012 for center Andrew Bogut, who plays an integral part on the Warriors' current roster.\n\nSince moving to the Mavericks, Ellis is actually playing the best basketball of his career. He averages 20.8 points and 5.6 assists for Dallas."
