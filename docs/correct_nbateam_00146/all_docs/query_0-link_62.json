        "text": "Warriors forward David Lee said his elbow injury is all but behind him, and he’s even starting to knock down midrange jumpers again.\n\nPoint guard Stephen Curry finally returned from a sprained right ankle, which kept him out six games. Rookie big man Ekpe Udoh is working his way into the fold, and he’s looking like someone who can provide some inside scoring.\n\nAnd you know who’s probably happiest about it all? Guard Monta Ellis.\n\n“We’re getting a lot of guys back,” Ellis said. “I have to give a hats off to my teammates. They’re making shots and guys are not loading (up on me) as much as they were earlier in the season. So they give me a lane to attack and make plays for them, and they set great screens for me to get them open.”\n\nEllis is on the highest-scoring tear of his career. He’s totaled 119 points his past three games, the most in any three-game span in his career. He enters tonight’s game against Philadelphia averaging 35.8 points and 6.4 assists over his past five games.\n\nEllis has promised things would turn around once the team is healthy. Now that is happening, Ellis’ play has picked up.\n\n“He’s doing the job that’s necessary for a player like him who can do so many things for his team,” coach Keith Smart said. “He’s moving up into that select group of players in the NBA that play at a high level every night. And that’s what he’s done.”\n\nLee knocking down jumpers opens up action for Ellis on the pick-and-roll, as the defense has to cover Lee. The presence of Curry takes Ellis off the ball, which is less taxing and gives him an angle of attack while the defense is mid-rotation instead of set and waiting for him as he brings the ball upcourt. And when Curry’s on a roll offensively, defenses have to choose where they will put their best perimeter defender.\n\nAnd any semblance of a low-post game, whether from Lee or Udoh, could cause the defense to collapse and open up things even more for Ellis. What’s more, forward Rodney Carney, who has played well since returning from a sore left foot, gives the Warriors someone who can spot up and spread the floor. He’s shooting a career-best 42.4 percent from 3-point range.\n\nIt all plays into Ellis hands.\n\n“I think he’s up there with any of the scorers in our league as a pure scorer,” Lee said. “I haven’t really seen any one person who can stop him. “… Monta Ellis should be an All-Star.”\n\nAll-Star? Warriors fans were aiming higher Saturday. Every time he stepped to the free throw line, they chanted “M-V-P!”\n\n“When I’m on the free throw line, I don’t hear anything,” Ellis said. “I’m in my own lil’ ol’ zone.”\n\nIndeed, he is in a zone."
