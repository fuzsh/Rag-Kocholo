        "text": "* 2:42 p.m update: Just added the rest of the ELLIS TRANSCRIPT, including his views on the Warriors holding the right to void his contract for most of last season (“I didn’t care”) to his feelings about possibly competing for minutes with Curry (“I don’t feel like my job is in jeopardy at all”) and many other topics.\n\nThe more I go through the tape, the more obvious it is that this was the most forceful interview of Ellis’ career, as far as I can remember.\n\n—This is going to be a wild Warriors season. You knew that. They’re always wild. But this one… this one could be an all-timer.\n\nStarted off today with Media Day, and you could never imagine Monta Ellis would upstage Stephen (Trade Me) Jackson in the talking, but that’s exactly what Ellis did.\n\nI’ll say that Ellis was much more focused and direct than he usually is when he speaks to the media. He had a point to make about himself, and with the Warriors’ talks about playing Ellis together with touted draft pick Stephen Curry.\n\nEllis point: That won’t work. Period. With excellent reasoning: They’re too similar and too small and Curry’s too young to make up for his deficiencies.\n\nFYI, that’s reasoning that the Warriors management is trying to ignore.\n\nEllis could not have been more clear. It’s the clearest point I’ve ever heard Ellis make, by a landslide, over these many years.\n\nThis is not the full Ellis transcript, but the weighty part, sliced out, with much more to come, including Jackson Himself, refusing to back off of his trade request (without saying the words), and ripping Warriors management for making the team worse every step of the way since the ’07 playoff run.\n\nClassic Warriors: Their best two players are the most disgruntled… and they’re also both much smarter than Warriors management.\n\n—ELLIS, partial transcript/\n\n-Q: Jackson says you’re going to be playing with a chip on your shoulder… You think so?\n\n-ELLIS: (laughs) Only thing I’m going to be playing for is to win. A chip? I don’t know what that means. Like I said, I’m just coming back to show everybody I worked hard this summer to get myself back to 100%, to see the Monta Ellis that everybody wants to see. Just glad to be back on the court.\n\n-Q: How important was it to you that Don Nelson and Larry Riley flew out to see you in the off-season? What was that about?\n\n-ELLIS: Really just… get on the same page. They wanted me to lead the team. Be one of the leaders.\n\nWe had to air some stuff out that happened last year that should’ve been… We put all of it behind us. Everybody’s coming in positive, everybody’s got a great mindset. Everybody just wants to win.\n\n-Q: Being a leader, does that mean being the point guard?\n\n-ELLIS: Nope. Being a leader means lead by example. Say what I mean and mean what I say. And I can’t go out and tell nobody to do this when I’m not out there doing it myself. You know, lead by example. Be that leader.\n\n-Q: Have you talked to Jackson, understand his situation?\n\n-ELLIS: That’s Stephen Jackson’s situation. That’s not mine. That’s not for me to comment on or whatever… Let Stephen and the organization handle that part. Like I said, at the end of the day, when the ball is tipped off, I know that Stephen will be there to play basketball, whether he’s here or somewhere else.\n\n-Q: So it won’t impact you?\n\n-ELLIS: It’s not going to impact anybody. I mean, he’s got a hold on his situation. He’s got control over it. He’s being professional about it.\n\nEverybody’s coming in with a great mindset of just winning. That’s it.\n\n-Q: Do you expect to be playing the 1 or the 2?\n\n-ELLIS: I just want to play basketball. It doesn’t matter. You could put me at the 5, I just want to play basketball. It doesn’t matter what position I play.\n\n-Q: Were you OK with them drafting Stephen Curry? He’s pretty similar to you…\n\n-ELLIS: I mean, I don’t have a problem. Whatever decision they make upstairs, that’s their decision. They’re doing it for a reason.\n\nI’m going to wish Curry the best in training camp, get better as his career goes on. We’re not worrying about it. We’re teammates. We’re not out here fighting for a position, because that’s not the case.\n\n-Q: Can you see yourself playing with Curry in the backcourt?\n\n-ELLIS: I can’t answer that. Us together? No.\n\n-Q: Why not?\n\n-ELLIS: Can’t. We just can’t.\n\n-Q: Too small? Too similar?\n\n-ELLIS: Just can’t.\n\n-Q: The Warriors say you can.\n\n-ELLIS: They say we can? Yeah. If they say it. But we can’t.\n\n-Q: You wouldn’t want to give it a shot?\n\n-ELLIS: I just want to win. That’s… not going to win that way.\n\n-Q: Why not?\n\n-ELLIS: It’s different when you’re trying to compare me and Stephen, when you’re trying to go back to when me and BD were playing, it’s a different situation.\n\nYou’ve got a nine-year veteran who’s been in the game, who understands the game, knows how to play the game, and he’s a big body…\n\nYou can’t put two small guys out there and try to play the 1 and the 2 when you’ve got big 2 guards in the league. You just can’t do it.\n\nOK, yes, we’re going to move up and down fast, but eventually the game is going to slow down.\n\nYou can’t do it.\n\n—ADDED TRANSCRIPT/\n\n-Q: Stephen Jackson said that since ’07, you’ve lost Jason, Baron, Al… it has all gone backwards. Do you have the same feelings?\n\n-ELLIS: It’s a business. There’s faces in here now that weren’t on the team last year. That’s the business. Now that was two years ago. We’re moving on to the 2009-2010 season. That’s what we’re talking about, the pieces we have now We can’t worry about what we had two years ago. That’s gone. We’re moving on, forward.\n\nWe can’t dwell on what happened two years ago with the playoffs and the players that we had. We have to work with what we’ve got right now.\n\n-Q: What do you feel about the franchise going with its younger players?\n\n-ELLIS: If that’s what they think it’s going to take to win, then so be it. I don’t make those decisions. I just go out and play basketball. That’s it.\n\n-Q: Is it fair to say that this team’s success will be determined by your play?\n\n-ELLIS: No, because you’ve got four other guys out there on the court with me. That’s why I say, go back to holding everybody accountable. You can’t put everything on one person, ‘cause it’s not just the one person out there. There’s five guys out there.\n\nYou’ve got to hold everybody accountable, from the head coach all the way down to the last player on the bench. Gotta hold everybody accountable.\n\n-Q: Who do you think would be the best guard alongside you?\n\n-ELLIS: We’ve got a lot of different combinations. You could put Anthony Morrow. You could put me and Jack back there. There’s a lot of different combinations.\n\n-Q: You guys have had a lot of controversy. Is important to go into the season with as little drama as possible?\n\n-ELLIS: You’re going to have drama. You just have to turn the negative into a positive. Just got to be on the same page. You’re going to bump heads. Everybody does it. Everybody. We’re not the first organization to bump heads. We’re not. Won’t be the last.\n\nJust gotta turn the negative into a positive. That’s all we’re trying to do.\n\n-Q: How much of a negative was last year for you?\n\n-ELLIS: It wasn’t a negative. I mean, it was a setback. That’s all. Sit back to evaluate the game more.\n\n-Q: What part of the game did you work on?\n\n-ELLIS: Everything. I started working out in June. That’s when I started. Everything. It’s going to be fun this season.\n\n-Q: Are you doing special work with the ankle?\n\n-ELLIS: No.\n\n-Q: Nothing different?\n\n-ELLIS: There’s nothing different. I had my surgery, that’s behind me. I just work out like I normally train.\n\n-Q: 100%?\n\n-ELLIS: Yes… My ankle is a whole lot better from last season. From the beginning, when I started playing, to the end, it’s a totally different ankle right now.\n\n-Q: Was it 100% last year?\n\n-ELLIS: (Laughs) It was 100%.\n\n-Q: What was it like when the franchise was holding the right to void your contract?\n\n-ELLIS: I never thought about it.\n\n-Q: That’s a lot of money.\n\n-ELLIS: That could be made over again. (Laughs) I wasn’t thinking about that.\n\n-Q: You would’ve been OK if they’d voided?\n\n-ELLIS: I don’t care.\n\n-Q: Is that why you wouldn’t talk about what actually happened in the accident, you didn’t want the contract voided?\n\n-ELLIS: I didn’t care. If I did, if I didn’t, I still was going to play basketball. That could’ve been made up. I wasn’t worried about that. I just didn’t want to talk about it. Just didn’t.\n\nWhat’s done was done. It was over with for me.\n\n-Q: Do you want to talk about it now?\n\n-ELLIS: Why? It was last year. If I wanted to, I couldn’t tell you. Once it’s out of my mind, it’s out of my mind. I don’t think about it. It’s over with. It’s a blank. I couldn’t tell you really what went down.\n\n-Q: Is this the place you still want to be long-term?\n\n-ELLIS: I’m a Warrior. I am a Golden State Warrior ‘til the day I re-sign my contract again. I’m a Golden State Warrior.\n\n-Q: We’ll never hear you say, trade me?\n\n-ELLIS: I’m a Golden State Warrior. Til the day I re-sign my contract. For the next five years.\n\n-Q: Because you have the contract or because you love it here?\n\n-ELLIS: Because I love it here.\n\n-Q: Have you talked to Curry?\n\n-ELLIS: I haven’t had time. Just had a four-month-old son.\n\n-Q: Riley and Nelson both said you’ve matured by becoming a father… that you see the world differently…\n\n-ELLIS: You see it totally different. You’re not living for yourself any more. You have a son. You have a family. My father was never in my life. So it’s a task, it’s different, but hey I enjoy it, I love it. I love him to death. So far, everything’s going good. I have no complaints. Now it’s just time to go to work.\n\n-Q: When Riley and Nelson visited you, did they tell you they wouldn’t draft a guard similar to you?\n\n-ELLIS: I don’t remember.\n\n-Q: Would you have wanted them to tell you that—or not to draft a similar guard?\n\n-ELLIS: To be honest with you, I don’t feel like my job is in jeopardy at all. I don’t feel that my position, my minutes, nothing are going to be taken. Because at the end of the day, I’m still going to be Monta Ellis. I’m still going to be the franchise player. And I’m still going to go out there and give you 20 points a night.\n\nI’m not worrying about that. I’m not.\n\n-Q: But they could’ve drafted another position…\n\n-ELLIS: They could have. But you know how the draft is. You know how they do it. You take the best player possible. You see it. Hey, he’s a Warrior. Bring him in, open arms to him, show him the ropes like they did me. See if we can put these pieces together.\n\n-Q: Nelson said he was making you a captain. Did he tell you that and what do you think of it?\n\n-ELLIS: (Chuckles) I don’t even know. What’s different in being a captain?\n\n-Q: I don’t know.\n\n-ELLIS: Exactly. I don’t know. It’s just a title to me.\n\n-Q: Have you talked to Nelson about your feelings on playing with Curry?\n\n-ELLIS: I don’t know what to expect. Just going into training camp positive."
