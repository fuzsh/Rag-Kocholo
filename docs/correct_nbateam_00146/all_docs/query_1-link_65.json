        "text": "Let his teammates and coach tell it, Warriors guard Monta Ellis played one of his most impressive games against Utah.\n\nSure, he totaled just two points on 1-for-9 shooting. But they say his impact on the game, especially on defense, showed Ellis’ versatility and will to win.\n\n“There were so many other things that he did on the defensive side,” coach Keith Smart said, “no one saw that part or wanted to pay attention to that part. The only thing he didn’t do was his normal scoring. A lot of good things he did. Sometimes, a guy may not have it from an offensive standpoint, and it stands out more when he’s your leading scorer.”\n\nStill, Ellis — who is averaging 25.1 points per game (sixth in the NBA) on 45.9 percent shooting — has struggled the past two games, both at home, totaling just 23 points on 7-for-33 shooting.\n\nAny sane basketball follower knows the Warriors don’t have much hope without his scoring. That was evident during the four-game losing streak the Warriors snapped Sunday against the Jazz. In those four losses, Ellis averaged 22.3 points on 35.7 percent shooting.\n\nSo is anything wrong with Ellis? Is he tired from a league-high 41.1 minutes per game? Is he still bothered by the left ankle he rolled in overtime against Sacramento on Jan. 21? Was his two-point outing against the Jazz a product of cobwebs after he banged his head in Friday’s loss to Charlotte?\n\nSmart said, emphatically and consistently, that nothing was wrong. And Ellis dismissed any notions that he’s hobbled at all.\n\n“It wasn’t anything with fatigue, no problems going on,” Ellis said. “My shot just wasn’t going. I just wasn’t feeling it on the offensive end.”\n\nIn regards to his All-Star hopes, Ellis perhaps picked a bad time to go through a scoring slump.\n\nCoaches received and have been turning in their ballots to choose the All-Star reserves, but Ellis hasn’t been able to give them one last good impression. Since knocking down consecutive clutch jumpers, one to beat Indiana on Jan. 19 and one to force overtime against Sacramento, Ellis has pretty much been out of the spotlight.\n\nThe All-Star reserves will be announced Thursday for the game at Staples Center on Feb. 20.\n\n“I’m not even worried about it,” Ellis said. “There’s nothing I really can do about it but continue to be me. “… To me, I’ve done enough. But, who knows? It’s not up to me. If it was up to me, I would put myself in the starting lineup.”\n\nEllis said he’s taking advantage of the Warriors’ three days between games. Smart gave the team Monday off, which Ellis used for rest. Tuesday, he stayed after practice to get extra shots.\n\nPart of the reason he struggled shooting, especially the past two games, is teams have put bigger, stronger defenders on Ellis. In Friday’s loss, in which he was 6-for-24 shooting, Ellis was defended by Bobcats 6-foot-8 swingman Stephen Jackson. Sunday, he was guarded by Utah’s Raja Bell, who earned his reputation in the league bodying up on Kobe Bryant.\n\nLogic says, at some point, Ellis’ shot will start falling again.\n\n“I’m not worried about ‘Tay at all,” backcourt mate Stephen Curry said. “Everybody’s going to go through a couple tough games. But he still has an impact on the game because he draws so much attention. He’s going to find a way to get his rhythm back. That’s’ why he’s an All-Star candidate. That’s why he’s been playing well all year. So I’m not worried about him bouncing back.”\n\nNote: Curry was named to the Sophomore team for the Rookie Challenge, which pits select second-year players vs. first-year players on the Friday before the All-Star game. Curry played on the rookie team last season. Warriors swingman Reggie Williams, who figured to have an outside chance with his improved play, didn’t make the second-year squad."
