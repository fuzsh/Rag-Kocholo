        "text": "Monta Ellis wants another chance at the NBA.\n\nThe former Lanier High star and McDonald's All-American recently told Empire Sports Media he wanted to become a professional again after being out of the league for four years.\n\n\"I believe I still have a lot in my tank,\" Ellis said. \"I can still play five years.”\n\nThe 12-year NBA veteran began his career straight out of high school with the Golden State Warriors in 2005. The Warriors drafted him with the 40th pick in the second round. Ellis remained with the Warriors for seven seasons before the organization decided to build around guard Stephen Curry in 2012. After Golden State traded him to the Milwaukee Bucks, he had two stints with the Dallas Mavericks and Indiana Pacers.\n\nIn his last full NBA season with Indiana in 2016-17, the \"Mississippi Bullet\" averaged 8.5 points, 3.2 assists, 2.8 rebounds and 1.1 steals per game. That offseason, the Pacers decided to waive Ellis after both sides couldn't agree on a buyout. The decision came two months after the veteran guard got suspended for violating the league's marijuana policies.\n\nEllis told Empire Sports Media he felt like his mindset wasn't good for himself or any team he wanted to play for in 2017. One of the main reasons he walked away from the NBA was because he wanted to focus on becoming a better family man. Now, the 35-year-old feels like he's ready for another shot.\n\nGIVING BACK: Former NBA guard Monta Ellis donates $60k to Jackson State's Sonic Boom marching band\n\n'TIME TO BRING IT BACK HOME': Lanier basketball wins first state title since 2007\n\nFor the past four years, Ellis has been training with NBA trainer Djamel Jackson four days a week at Michael Johnson Performance in Dallas. Ellis said he's been ready to come back for some time now, but a team hasn't given him a chance.\n\n\"If I have an opportunity to do it, it is what it is,\" he said. \"If I don’t, I’ll still be a husband and a father, and I have an AAU program. I’m good either way. But to come back, to be able challenge myself and do the thing that I haven’t done in a while, that will be a big challenge that I am willing to accept if it comes.\"\n\nThe Pacers still owe Ellis $2.25 million this season, the final payout for when the team waived him in 2017.\n\nContact Rashad Milligan at 601-862-6198 or Jmilligan@gannett.com.
