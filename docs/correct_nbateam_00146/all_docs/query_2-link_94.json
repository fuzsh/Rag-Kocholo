        "text": "Every year, there are always NBA players who are snubbed from the All-Star Game.\n\nOnly 24 players make the annual exhibition (unless there is an injury-replacement), which means that not everyone who was deserving can earn a spot.\n\nWho are some of the most surprising snubs in recent memory?\n\n1.) Josh Smith (Atlanta Hawks): The 2005 Slam Dunk Contest winner was one of the most exciting players in the NBA. He had many good seasons during his 13-year career (with the Atlanta Hawks, Detroit Pistons, Houston Rockets, Los Angeles Clippers and New Orleans Pelicans), but never was named to the All-Star Game. In 2013, Smith averaged 17.5 points, 8.4 rebounds, 4.2 assists, 1.2 steals and 1.8 blocks per contest while shooting 46.5% from the field.\n\nHe helped the Hawks make the NBA playoffs for six straight seasons and was part of the 2015 Rockets (who made the Western Conference Finals).\n\n2.) Lou Williams (Los Angeles Clippers): The three-time 6th Man of The Year was always recognized for being an elite bench player. However, he became one of the best players in the league when he was on the Los Angeles Clippers. During the 2018 season, he was arguably the best player on the team and averaged 22.6 points, 2.5 rebounds, 5.3 assists and 1.1 steals per contest while shooting 43.5% from the field and 35.9% from the three-point range.\n\nOver 17 years, Williams played for the Atlanta Hawks, Philadelphia 76ers, Toronto Raptors, Los Angeles Clippers, Houston Rockets and Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nIn 2021, he helped the Hawks make the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\n3.) Monta Ellis (Golden State Warriors): The talented scorer averaged over 20 points per contest in four different seasons. In 2010 (with the Warriors), Ellis averaged 25.5 points, 4.0 rebounds, 5.3 assists and 2.2 steals per contest while shooting 44.9% from the field.\n\nHowever, he was not named to the All-Star Game.\n\nThe 12-year veteran played for the Dallas Mavericks, Indiana Pacers, Golden State Warriors and Milwaukee Bucks. His career averages were 17.8 points, 3.5 rebounds, 4.6 assists and 1.7 steals per contest while shooting 45.1% from the field in 833 games."
