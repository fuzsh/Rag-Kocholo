        "text": "Two years after retiring, Monta Ellis is on the comeback trail.\n\nAccording to a report from ESPN’s Jordan Schultz, Ellis and former Suns star Amar’e Stoudemire are planning to work out for NBA teams next week in Las Vegas.\n\nSchultz says both players are “healthy and hoping to sign with a contending team, such as the #Lakers.”\n\nMaybe they can join Carmelo Anthony and Dwyane Wade on the end of the Los Angeles bench. Jack Nicholson could use some company these days. OK, Wade already squashed that rumor but by my count, the Lakers only have five rostered players,so they could use more bodies, with or without Kawhi Leonard.\n\nThe question Warriors fans want to know, though, is whether Ellis could come back to the Bay. Never say never.\n\nWhile it appears Steph Curry harbors no lingering resentment toward Ellis — he showed as much earlier this year by wearing Ellis’ jersey to a game — the fit just isn’t there. D’Angelo Russell is taking up the mantle as the Dubs’ second ball-handling guard, and he’s getting a max contract to do it.\n\nThe Warriors’ backcourt beyond Curry, Russell and a recovering Klay Thompson is pretty bare, but would Bob Myers really take a shot on a score-first guard without much three-point touch? It seems unlikely.\n\nWhile we wait to see if there’s any chance Ellis is back in a Warriors jersey, here’s a trip back to his time with Golden State:"
