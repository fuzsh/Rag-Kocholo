        "text": "According to Spotrac, the Indiana Pacers have over $137 million in salaries on their cap allocation sheet right now.\n\nYet, one player that is on there, has not played for the team since the 2016-17 NBA season.\n\nThat is right, the Pacers are still on the hook for paying over $2 million to Monta Ellis next season.\n\nEllis played for the Pacers during the 2015-16 and 2016-17 NBA seasons, and started well over 100 games for the team during his stint there.\n\nWhen the Pacers waved Ellis in July of 2017, David Aldridge, now with The Athletic, reported that the Pacers would use the stretch provision to pay out the remaining $11+ million in salary Ellis was owed (see Tweet from 2017 below).\n\nEllis has been getting paid by the Pacers ever since.\n\nNext season will be the last year that is he on the books.\n\nRelated stories on NBA basketball"
