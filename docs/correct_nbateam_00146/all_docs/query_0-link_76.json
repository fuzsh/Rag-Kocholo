        "text": "Warriors GM Larry Riley, in a conversation with SI, tries to put the Monta Ellis trade rumors to bed: “On reports that the team is in talks to trade Monta Ellis: ‘We are not shopping Monta Ellis. It is business as usual here. I think you have to look at what just happened in the Finals — it seemed like Dallas played pretty small guards throughout that series with Miami and did a pretty good job of it. Our problem is not the small backcourt [of Ellis and Stephen Curry]. Our problem is defense.’ … More on the Ellis/Curry dynamic: ‘We can move forward with this team. Obviously it would be a nice thing if we could acquire a point guard who was 6-foot-4 to come off the bench, or a 2-guard who was 6-5 and could guard point guards — someone off the bench who is a bit longer. But that backcourt in Dallas was not long either. But when I mention Dallas, you have to give Jason Kidd credit, too — he’s a great defender. But they still had times when they had both J.J. Barea and Jason Terry on the floor.'”"
