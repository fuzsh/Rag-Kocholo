        "text": "INDIANAPOLIS— Monta Ellis belongs on the bench.\n\nDon’t read that wrong. No one is saying Ellis deserves to be benched. That's not it at all. But Ellis — and the Indiana Pacers — have proved to be a better team when he's leading the second unit.\n\nBench mob linchpin C.J. Miles and team leader Paul George are seeing it.\n\n“(Coming off the bench) allows Monta to play his whole game,” Miles said after Wednesday's practice at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. “Because it’s hard for him to play with the ball in his hands in the first unit. He kind of likes to create a lot for himself and for others. And with him and JT (Jeff Teague) together, it’s a little different, because JT does those same things. ... (Having Ellis in the second unit) kind of evens our grease out a little bit more.\"\n\nIn other words, both Teague and Ellis need the ball to be effective, and that's been a problem. Team president Larry Bird admitted as much in a recent interview with TNT analyst David Aldridge.\n\n\"We’ve got too many guys that just want to dribble the basketball.\" Bird said. \"That kills your offense.\"\n\nEasy solution: Remove one ball-dominant player from the starting lineup (Ellis) that already has a pair of them (Teague, George), and replace him with someone who can thrive without the ball in his hands (Glenn Robinson III). Then let Ellis work his magic with the second unit.\n\nResult: In the four games since Ellis returned from his groin injury and came off the bench, the Pacers are 3-1, including their first three-game winning streak of the season, and have scored 113.5 points per game. It's a small sample size, but in those games Ellis is averaging about 17 minutes per game and shooting 56.2 percent from the field with nine assists and just two turnovers.\n\nGeorge, for his part, predicted Ellis' success off the bench.\n\n“Monta playing with that second unit, I think right now, he’s going to be great for that group,\" George said two days before Ellis scored 16 points on 6-of-6 shooting against the Detroit Pistons.\\\n\nAnd while that was just one game, and the Pacers' modest wining streak has come against teams with a combined winning percentage of .453, it's hard to argue with the most success they have enjoyed all season.\n\nBut putting a 12-year NBA veteran on the bench is not a move coach Nate McMillan can make lightly.\n\nEllis, after all, has taken part in 787 NBA basketball games, and he's been an announced starter in 703 of them. In fact, up until this season, Ellis had not come off the bench in any of his past 621 games.\n\nHe's also the co-captain of this team and one of the Pacers' most expensive players.\n\nSo a move to the bench might frustrate him, right?\n\n“Nah. He’s too old for that,\" Miles said with a laugh. \"He’s been around. He’s played a lot. He knows what it takes to win and the things you got to do to have a good team and understanding your role. We talk about everybody making sacrifices and he’s been a starter, obviously. He’s been a guy who’s led the league in minutes for years. But it’s about what makes our unit the best.\"\n\nRight now, the Pacers seem to be at their best with Ellis coming off the bench.\n\nAnd Ellis is fine with that.\n\n\"Whatever it takes for us to win, I'm willing to do it,\" he said Wednesday. \"That's the situation, and I embrace it. As long as we continue to win, that's all that matters to me.\"\n\nStill, McMillan has yet to commit to Ellis coming off the bench permanently.\n\n\"(The lineup) is how it is for right now,\" McMillan said. \"Monta is working himself back into a rhythm, and so we'll go with that same lineup again (Thursday) night. ... But we'll see how far that lineup goes into the future.\"\n\nIf the Pacers continue to rattle off wins like they have been, letting Ellis start off the bench might be the easiest choice McMillan makes all season.\n\nFollow IndyStar producer Jim Ayello on Twitter: @jamesayello.\n\nBROOKLYN NETS (8-25) AT INDIANA PACERS (18-18)\n\nTipoff: 7 p.m. Thursday, Bankers Life Fieldhouse.\n\nTV: Fox Sports Indiana.\n\nRadio: WFNI-FM (93.5), -AM (1070).\n\nStorylines:\n\n>> Bankers Life Fieldhouse continues to be a source of goodness for the Pacers. Indiana is 13-5 at home, including wins in seven of their past eight. The difference? Defense. At home, the Pacers allow 101.6 points per game, as opposed to 110.6 on the road.\n\n>> For Kevin Seraphin, the Pacers' three-game winning streak feels particularly satisfying. Why? Because for the first time all season, Seraphin has played more than 10 minutes in three straight games. \"It feels pretty good,\" he said with a smile. \"Especially when I'm playing.\"\n\n>> The Pacers' surging offense (116.3 points per game over the past three) should be able to take one of the league's worst defenses. The Nets have allowed 109 points per 100 possessions, the third most in the NBA. Many of those points have come as a result of three-pointers. Brooklyn concedes 10.4 3s per game, fourth most in the league."
