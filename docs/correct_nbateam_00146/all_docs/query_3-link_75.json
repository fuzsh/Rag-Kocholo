        "text": "[jwplayer nnvOGlq0-z6KDnl0B]\n\nAmar’e Stoudemire and Monta Ellis are in Las Vegas during NBA Summer League with hopes of getting another shot in the league and the Golden State Warriors are among the 12 teams attending their workouts, according to Chris Haynes with Yahoo Sports.\n\nStoudemire hasn’t played since the 2015-16 season during which he averaged 5.8 points and 4.3 rebounds per game for the Miami Heat. At his best during a professional career that started in 2002, Stoudemire averaged 25 or more points in two of the eight seasons he played for the Phoenix Suns (2004-05, 2007-08) and in one of the five seasons he played for the New York Knicks (2010-11).\n\nIt will be interesting to see what interest Stoudemire garners. He has a history of knee injuries — including a few microfracture surgeries — and is 37 years old.\n\nFor Monta Ellis, it would be a return to Golden State. The shooting guard played for the Warriors from 2005-12 and averaged just over 19 points per game. At his best, Ellis averaged 25.5 points per game on just under 45 percent shooting from the field in 2009-10.\n\nEllis last played for the Indiana Pacers in 2016-17, coming off the bench for 8.5 points per game. Depending on his conditioning, Ellis could have a shot with the team. He his 34 years old, the same age as LeBron James, and has a demonstrated history of carrying the scoring load for the Warriors.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers, New York Knicks, Oklahoma City Thunder, Milwaukee Bucks, Detroit Pistons and Washington Wizards are also attending the workouts, per Haynes."
