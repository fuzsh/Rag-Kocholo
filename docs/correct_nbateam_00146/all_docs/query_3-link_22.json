        "text": "Scouting Report\n\nElectric as a scorer and playmaker. Can take over games with his scoring and passing, and has worked to become a solid defender, turning regular steals into fast break points. Does a good job drawing fouls heading to the hoop, and usually makes his free throws. Takes far too many 3-pointers considering the middling percentage of them he makes. Somewhat undersized for a shooting guard, which affects his durability and rebounding production. Not quite the high flyer he was earlier in his career."
