        "text": "Monta Ellis didn’t watch the final regular-season game at Oracle Arena back on April 7. He doesn’t remember what he was doing that night, just that his phone was blowing up. Family members and friends were texting, relaying to him his most random return to the NBA spotlight.\n\nStephen Curry had been commemorating Oracle by wearing jerseys of former players to the final regular-season games. He started with Baron Davis’ No. 5 and followed with Stephen Jackson’s No. 1. Then came Andris Biedrins’ No. 15 and, after that, Tim Hardaway’s No. 10 jersey from the Run TMC days. For the final regular-season game at Oracle in Warriors history, and the culmination of what he called “Operation Honor The Goats of Oracle Arena,” Curry wore No. 8. He saved Monta Ellis for last.\n\n“I think for me, in terms of representing him on the last game meant a lot, because we were in that backcourt together and obviously, when he was traded it was a tough time in terms of the transition of the organization,” Curry said back then. “I wanted to pay honor to him in terms of his story and coming out of high school and doing what he was able to do. … Only right to have him as the last night of the regular season.”\n\nEllis took to social media to watch the Warriors point guard entering Oracle. He saw his old running mate wearing his old navy blue road jersey, with the gold lettering and orange outline, over a hooded sweater. He isn’t the mushy type, but a rush of pride swelled up in Ellis. It was a cool moment, a subtle reminder of his understated impact.\n\nThe increased maturity and comfort is evident in Ellis these days. He is reflective. He is expressive. Much more so than he was during his days with the Warriors.\n\nBut Ellis is 34 years old now and hasn’t played in the NBA since April 2017, his last days with the Indiana Pacers. He’s fully engulfed in his life as a husband, father to three kids, and coach to scores more in his AAU program, Ellis Elite. He has done well with his money — he made $99 million in his career not counting endorsements, with more than $4.5 million still coming — and is a legend in his community. He can’t fix his mouth to complain.\n\nPart of him knows his name has gotten a bit obscured in Warriors history, his accomplishments blocked by championship trophies and MVP statues. But Ellis was the bridge between the “We Believe” era and the championship era. He was the future star supporting Davis and Jackson. He was the face of the franchise for the wilderness period between postseason appearances, who delivered excitement in place of wins and put up a fight against the superstars of the league. He was the ransom that returned the Warriors to glory.\n\nBut many fans don’t know about Ellis. Worse, his friction with the organization and departure left a villainous hue on his reputation.\n\nEven still, Ellis is fine with all that. Those who remember and appreciate how good he was, what he meant to the organization, they remember. Those who don’t, that’s fine, too. Peace won’t let that bother him. Because he remembers.\n\n“Everything, even through my bad times, I still enjoyed it,” Ellis said in a phone interview this week of his time with the Warriors. “Because at the end of the day, they gave me my shot. They took a chance on drafting a high schooler, 152 pounds of out Jackson, Mississippi. … So I was always grateful and thankful for that. It went down the way it went down. I guess that’s part of the business. And it just happened the way it happened. But my whole experience, the time that I was there for seven and a half years, I loved every bit of it.”\n\nEllis certainly had an eventful tenure with the Warriors. He was taken in the second round of the 2005 NBA Draft, No. 40 overall, the last year the NBA allowed high school players to be selected. Ellis was a shot in the dark by Chris Mullin, then the Warriors’ new top basketball executive, a project selected between Ike Diogu and Chris Taft. No one knew he would be the future star.\n\nYou, too, should remember Monta Ellis.\n\nEllis struggled to get off the bench under coach Mike Montgomery until the stack of defeats forced the Warriors to go young. He had a breakout sophomore year in 2006-07. The previous offseason, the Warriors fired Montgomery and hired Don Nelson, who six games into the season made the switch to start Ellis next to Davis. Then after a midseason trade that brought in Jackson and Al Harrington for Mike Dunleavy Jr., Troy Murphy and Diogu, Ellis became an offensive weapon off the bench. It was a fruitful role, as Ellis’ scoring average jumped to 16.5 points and he won the NBA’s Most Improved Player Award.\n\nEllis was fun. He was fast and skilled. His teammates often called him “Tip” because he was a fan of and had a swagger like rapper T.I. Behind the scenes, he was a little brother to the vets. He cracked jokes, learned the NBA ropes from them, even entertained them with how fast he could move his feet while dancing. And he went hard like them.\n\n“A lot of them gravitated to me and put their hands around me,” Ellis said. “Calbert Cheaney. Derek Fisher. BD. Jason Richardson. And then you had your coaches like Keith Smart, Steve Silas, Rico Hines. Mario Elie was my first guy, though. That’s who I used to stay with my rookie year, every day before and after practice. Man, Mario stayed two, two and a half hours after every day my rookie year. So, like, that was my first guy who took me under his wing and showed me the ropes because of how he had to get to the NBA, the road he had to take, the battles and obstacles he had to overcome throughout his career to be able to get to the show. It was a lot of them to help me out along the way.”\n\nThe next year, he averaged 20.2 points on 53.1 percent shooting as the Warriors won 48 games.\n\nBut the Warriors just missed the playoffs. The core of “We Believe” was being dismantled — Davis would end up signing as a free agent with the Clippers that summer. The Warriors front office was embroiled in drama. But they had Monta. He signed a six-year, $66 million contract in the summer of 2008.\n\nThen it got rough.\n\nThat summer, Ellis famously tore up his left ankle riding a moped, an injury he initially said he sustained playing basketball. Then-Warriors team president Robert Rowell suspended Ellis for 30 games — costing him more than $3 million — and threatened to void the rest of his contract if Ellis didn’t return to full health.\n\nBetween the suspension and the injury, Ellis missed the first 43 games of that season, scoring 20 points in his season debut in late January against Cleveland, a game LeBron James won on a buzzer-beater. Ellis averaged 19 points on 45 percent shooting in 25 games. On April 1, he dropped 42 points with nine assists and eight rebounds, punctuating his campaign to prove he was healthy, then shut it down for the rest of the season. The Warriors decided against voiding his contract.\n\nThat following summer, Nelson and general manager Larry Riley flew to Ellis’ home in Memphis to smooth things over with Ellis, who was unhappy with the franchise. But shortly after that, they drafted a player at Ellis’ preferred position of point guard. It was Stephen Curry.\n\nEllis had spent three seasons with Davis, who was a point guard but big and thick enough to defend shooting guards. Ellis could play shooting guard on offense and defend point guards on defense. When the Warriors drafted Curry, a player just as slight as him, Ellis didn’t think it could work. And he said so, which created controversy.\n\nHe laughs about it now, that character trait of his that stirred that pot. Ellis doesn’t talk much. But when he does, he says what he believes. And the straight-talking young man from the Dirty South only knew one way to tell it.\n\n“I ain’t gon’ lie,” he said over the phone. “I’ve done some things when I was young that bite me in my butt. But it is what it is, a part of life.\n\n“Just some people didn’t take, when they ask me an opinion, they didn’t really want to accept the reality of it, the truth. Because, you know, I don’t know how to be fake with nobody.”\n\nEarly in the 2009-10 season, the last veteran star from “We Believe,” Stephen Jackson, was traded. Ellis and Biedrins were left with a new cast. Ellis wound up setting career-high averages in points (25.5), minutes (41.4), assists (5.3) and steals (2.2). It didn’t result in more wins, as Ellis was right about his fit with Curry, but he and Curry developed a rapport.\n\nThe rookie earned the veteran’s respect and their relationship grew off the court, aided by the friendship of their respective wives. It still amazes Ellis what Curry has become.\n\n“Man, he earned it, man,” Ellis said. “He worked. You put the work in, it’s gon’ show. He earned it. He deserves it. Everything that comes his way … he deserves it.”\n\nEllis’ efficiency started dropping. He made his name on his high field-goal percentage, thanks to his ability to get to the rim and a money midrange jumper. But his new role as epicenter of the offense led to him taking on defenses without much help around him. Smart, who replaced Nelson as head coach before the 2010-11 season, started the trend of putting the ball in Ellis’ hands and letting him go to work.\n\nThe next coach, Mark Jackson, continued it. His usage rate jumped to well over 28 percent of the plays after his best season, getting as high as 30.7 percent under Jackson. But the amount of dribbling went up, as did the degree of difficulty on his shots. And, seemingly, his frustration levels.\n\nThen came March 13, 2012.\n\n“To be honest with you, man,” he said, “it was so much going on at that time.”\n\nThat day, 30 minutes before he got on the team bus to the arena, Ellis recalled that he talked with management at the team hotel in Sacramento. His name had been in trade rumors. But Warriors executives told him they weren’t trading anybody. He was fine with that. The Warriors had won three of four, including a big win over Chris Paul’s playoff-bound Clippers. They were three games back of a playoff spot with 28 to play in the lockout-shortened season. Even though Curry sprained his ankle again badly against the Clippers and was out indefinitely, the Warriors were going to make a push for the playoffs. Ellis, David Lee, Dorrell Wright, Ekpe Udoh, Nate Robinson, rookie Klay Thompson — the plan as Ellis understood it was to play it out.\n\nHe was getting dressed in the visiting locker room at Arco Arena, ready to take on the Kings, when Dominic McGuire broke the news to him. He saw it on the ESPN ticker on the locker room TV. Ellis was traded to Milwaukee.\n\nJust like that, he was no longer a Warrior. He was pissed.\n\n“Not only so much that they traded me,” Ellis remembered, “just how they went about trading me. If they would’ve traded me and let me know the process of everything that was going down, it would’ve been a whole lot better. I mean, that was a career-changing experience right there. ‘Cause when I went to Milwaukee, it was totally different.”\n\nThree days later, he returned to Oracle as a Milwaukee Buck, along with Udoh, who were both swapped for an injured Andrew Bogut. Ellis started and had 18 points as Milwaukee routed the Warriors.\n\nA few days later, on March 19, he was in a hotel room in Portland watching Mullin’s jersey retirement ceremony. That’s when a chorus of boos rained down on Warriors owner Joe Lacob.\n\n“I was laughing — but crying at the same time,” Ellis said. “Because it was bad. It was like, man, all I did for that city, for that organization. Put my body on the line. Even when they doubted me when I came back from my ankle injury. I felt like I deserved to know everything that was going on with the process of that whole little thing. It just went sideways. So when I (saw) that I laughed and I said, ‘He deserved it.’\n\n“But, man, you know,” he continued, “I guess everything happens for a reason, whatever reason that may be. I can’t complain. I played 12 years, made a shit load of money.”\n\nCurry eventually got healthy. Bogut got healthy and gave the Warriors the big man they coveted. And everything else is history. So much history, it seems, the legacy of Ellis gets lost.\n\nEllis doesn’t do much to keep it alive. Unlike many of the players he starred with, he doesn’t make his way into the spotlight. He opts out of the nostalgia tours. The last time he came to Oracle was May 2017, when the Warriors celebrated the 10-year anniversary of the “We Believe” squad. But Ellis mostly stayed in the suite and hung out with his old teammates.\n\nSince then, he’s been largely out of the spotlight. He walked away from basketball after the 2017 season, following the Pacers waiving him and stretching his contract. He said the love of the game wasn’t there. He focused on his life at home.\n\n“I be so tied up with my kids, man,” Ellis said, “I don’t be doing too much. I train these boys, coach these boys Monday through Friday. We have games on weekends. Then my kids be having other games. My daughter plays soccer and volleyball. … I just spend all the time I can with my kids.”\n\nCoaching AAU brought the love back. The time off healed his body. Ellis trains every day at the Michael Johnson Performance Center in Dallas. He wants to get back in the league and thought he played well in his private workout for several teams in July. He said he shot the ball well and he feels as good as he did in his Warriors days. He’s just waiting on a team to give him another opportunity.\n\nHe is convinced he can get out of his bed right now and average 20 points, especially in this era of pace and space. But it’s clear in his tone, and in how he operates, Ellis is fine if that shot doesn’t come. “It is what it is” remains his go-to phrase, and he still spews it with a Sunday morning ease.\n\nEllis is fulfilled by what he’s already pulled off. He is not wrong. Sports figures are not just defined by wins and losses. They are also weighed for entertainment value, how they make people feel in this industry of escape, how they maximize their ability, the relationship they create with fans through the moments they produce and the drama of their journey. In that way, Ellis was successful. Not the most successful, but worthy of significant regard. He authored his share of moments that made Oracle legendary. He was a player the Bay got to watch grow up, triumph and struggle, and all totaled up it exceeded expectations of a second-round pick. If he failed at all, it was because he was willing to assume the burden of carrying the franchise during a period of dysfunction and transition. He wasn’t afraid though the challenge crushed many other players.\n\nEllis sees it all as a win because he wasn’t supposed to make it out of Jackson. He ended up with a wife, three kids, a 12-year career, millions of dollars, a fraternity of friends, respect from some of the best players of his era and memories. So many memories.\n\nSuch as his first basket.\n\n“Against Phoenix,” he said, “in the left corner.”\n\nHis first buzzer-beater.\n\n“Against New Jersey.”\n\nThat time he scored 49 against Oklahoma City’s Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook and James Harden.\n\n“We coulda won that game if Mark Jackson woulda gave me the ball. He gave it to D-Lee. We lost when D-Lee missed the jump shot.”\n\nThat time he shot 60 percent from the field for the month of February.\n\n“Yessir.”\n\nAnd, of course, he remembers Oracle. Just talking about it adds some volume to his memorable drawl.\n\n“That’s my second home,” he said. “I love Oakland. The fans are like no other. I’ve never seen any other fans in America like Oracle.”\n\nHe even cherishes the memories of he and Curry together. That’s why it is touching to hear the respect and adoration coming his way from the two-time MVP.\n\n“People gon’ say what they gon’ say about Monta Ellis. I really don’t care,” Ellis said. “But the biggest thing that I always wanted to do, like, when I leave this Earth, is know that I impacted somebody in some shape or form, no matter if it was on or off the basketball court. That’s my biggest thing. … So to hear that from him, man, it just means I did what I was supposed to do. I made an impact on somebody’s life before I left here.”\n\nHe’s doing that every day now, working with young hoopers, including his own children. Ellis said he focuses on fundamentals. He sounds older than his years as he laments the showmanship of today’s game.\n\nEven his son gets the lectures.\n\n“We all about the fundamentals of basketball,” Ellis said. “All that ol’ step back and all that, we ain’t doing that. We doing drop steps, rebounding, box outs. We do stuff like that. Man, my son right here now. That’s all he wants to do is do step-backs and all that old crap they see. … Man, that ain’t what it is. I got a lot of great kids that’s gon’ be talented. But the new NBA hinders them because they all want to do everything like the Trae Youngs and all that.”\n\nWho would’ve thought the high schooler who could barely dribble with his left hand would be talking like that?\n\nWho would’ve thought the leading scorer who thrived on end-of-shot-clock fade-aways would be on a fundamentals soapbox?\n\nHe said when he got to the Warriors, he thought the heavy lifting was done. He’d given all he had to get there only to learn he had to work even harder in the league, a lesson imparted to him by the veterans. His youngsters think he’s crazy now when he tells them it’s easy to make the NBA — “Only thing you gotta do is put up the numbers” — and harder to stay in the NBA. He champions working on the craft, getting better.\n\nThat’s it. That’s what he wants his legacy to be. Yeah, he skied for dunks and glided up and down the court. Yeah, he scored a lot of points, put together some big performances. Yeah, he also provided some memorable lines, such as “Monta have it all” and “Why do I get blamed for everything?”\n\nAnd, no, he didn’t win big, never led the Warriors to the playoffs as the centerpiece. No, he didn’t win an MVP or make an All-Star team. And no, he didn’t always use his exceptional athleticism on defense or rein in his occasionally ornery personality enough.\n\nAll of that is part of his career, part of his history. And he is fine with that. But the umbrella he wants over all that is his work ethic. When he was with the Warriors, and when the Warriors belonged to him, he was all in once he stepped foot on the court.\n\n“Golden State, they know I put everything on the line,” he said. “I went out there every night, competed, gave it my all. I tried to do everything I could to try to turn the organization around, try to help them win. I got better every year. So it wasn’t like I’d be good here and then fall off. Even in my bad times, when they figured that I wasn’t ready or when I hurt my ankle, I still came out and performed at a high level. And didn’t complain about it. I went out there and played every minute. And the fans, they always had my back — through my ups and downs, my good and bad.”\n\nEllis and his family were driving back home to Dallas after spending time with family for Thanksgiving. Along the way, he stopped in stores in Memphis, and in Arkansas and Texas. Each time, each store, he was recognized, celebrated.\n\nIt wasn’t just a random fan here or there. Everybody in the stores it seemed knew who he was, remembered his best days in the NBA.\n\n“Sometimes,” Ellis said, “I ain’t even gon’ tell you no story — it trips me out sometimes when I go places and … people know who I am. It be crazy. I’m with my kids and we go overseas and out of the country and how people approach me and tell me how great I was. It’s amazing because (my children) ain’t really get to see me play like that. Especially my daughter. … My son, he don’t really remember those days when I was at Golden State, like my golden days at Golden State.”\n\nThey might remember him with the Bucks from his ridiculous game-winner against Houston that went viral. They’re more likely to remember him with Dallas, especially from the year he averaged 26 points in the playoffs. But they for sure remember him with the Warriors. Anyone who watched those Warriors — those frenetic, fast-paced, high-energy, often frustrating but entertaining, struggling but perennially undermanned Warriors — couldn’t possibly forget Monta Ellis.\n\nNor should they.\n\n(Photo: Garrett W.
