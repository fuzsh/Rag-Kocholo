        "text": "Doyel: Why Monta Ellis may drive Pacers fans crazy\n\nYou’re going to love Monta Ellis. Or he’s going to drive you nuts.\n\nIt could go both ways with the Pacers’ top offseason addition. In fact, if it goes the way Ellis’ NBA career has gone through 10 NBA seasons, 13,107 career points, four playoff appearances and one coach calling him out in spectacular fashion, it will go both ways.\n\nYou’ll love the way he can score. He loves the way he can score — “I can tell you what I bring: scoring,” Ellis said Tuesday — and few players in recent NBA history have done it better. His career average of 19.3 ppg is 13th among active players.\n\n“A common theme from playoff teams during the free agent period is they want a guy who can get a basket when you need it, deep in the playoffs,” Ellis’ agent, Jeff Fried, told me Tuesday. “Monta is ... the kind of guy who can do that. His game works well in the playoffs.”\n\nYou won’t love the 6-3, 175-pound Ellis’ defense. Pacers president Larry Bird, who gave Ellis a four-year deal worth $44 million, said “the pluses outweigh the minuses” — but concedes Ellis “is not a great defender, we know that.”\n\nEllis has a two-prong defense of his defense: One, media critics are wrong. Two, even if they’re right, so what?\n\nProng No. 1:\n\nWhen he was new to the Dallas Mavericks in 2013-14 and the media noticed his poor defense, someone cut out those stories, highlighted the most critical passages and taped them inside Ellis’ locker.\n\nEllis left the stories there. Motivation, he called it then.\n\nNonsense, he calls it now.\n\n“You got people that are always trying to make their opinion on how a guy plays or what he does,” said Ellis, 29. “Me, I think half those people don’t know basketball.”\n\nProng No. 2:\n\nDefense is overrated. Or something. When I asked him Tuesday about his reputation as a sub-par defender, he didn’t exactly say that reputation is wrong. What he said, exactly and entirely:\n\n“It’s all opinions,” he said. “I think it’s only a handful of guys in this NBA that play defense. You can name five of them, and one of them is on my team. I don’t worry about that. I go out and do whatever I need to do to help my team win.”\n\nOnly a handful of guys in the NBA play defense …\n\nLike I say, Monta Ellis will drive you nuts at times.\n\nBut there’s a lot to love. He said he picked the Pacers for the chance to win now, and because he loves the idea of Indianapolis. He doesn’t know the area yet, doesn’t know where he will live, but he loves the size of this market. He considers himself a small-town guy, a phrase he used multiple times, and says Indianapolis, while not exactly a small town, “isn’t a major market.”\n\nThat’s the attitude the Pacers were seeking. They know that being located in the Midwest, away from the brightest lights, works against them with some free agents. Pacers general manager Kevin Pritchard said he “wants to have a good feeling” that a player knows what it means to live in Indiana, and Ellis knows what it means. It means going home, not to a club, after games. It means fishing. It means being a real person in a real community.\n\n“I’m from Jackson, Mississippi, and my wife’s from Arkansas,” Ellis said. “We’re small-town people just trying to live our life. We’re blessed for that to be here.”\n\nLike I say, you’re going to love Monta Ellis.\n\nHe’s a 10-year veteran, “older and wiser,” he says. Once upon a time his own coach called him “selfish” and “a pain,” but that was when Don Nelson coached Ellis in Golden State from 2007-10. By 2013 Nelson decided that Ellis had “matured” and was “a pretty good player right now.”\n\nBut the word “selfish” is startling — and has lingered — and is something for us to watch. Not to accuse, no. But to watch. NBA basketball is chemistry, and Ellis joins a locker room with an established star (Paul George) and three solid backcourt veterans (George Hill, Rodney Stuckey and C.J. Miles). How he fits isn’t just a thing; it’s everything.\n\nBut we know he can score. He was eighth in the NBA last season on points off drives — plays that begin 20-plus feet from the basket, and end within 10 feet of the rim — and was sixth in points off pull-up shooting (any jumper outside of 10 feet that started off the dribble). Only three players were ahead of Ellis on both lists:\n\nRussell Westbrook, James Harden, Damian Lillard.\n\nAs for the other end of the court, and the knock that Ellis sacrifices sound defensive principals, has taken too many risks to rank 16th among active players with 1,181 career steals? Bird doesn’t hate the idea of Ellis running amok.\n\n“Defensively he gets into passing lanes a lot,” Bird said. “We were not very good at stealing the ball and getting something out of it. He’ll be able to do that.”\n\nEllis met the media Tuesday sporting Jordan gear from head to toe — white shoes and wind pants, black T-shirt, red hat — and enormous confidence. He was in the last class of players to turn pro out of high school — and along with Lou Williams, the only preps-to-pros player 6-3 or smaller to become an NBA star — and says he skipped college because: “With the points I scored in high school, I just didn’t think college was going to be competitive enough.”\n\nConfidence? Like this:\n\n“With my ability with what I bring to the team,” Ellis said of the Pacers’ upcoming season, “we can get back to the top.”\n\nConfidence, plus country? Like this.\n\n“He’s a country guy, I’m a country guy,” Ellis was saying of the connection he felt with Larry Bird. Then he kept the comparison going.\n\n“Both love fishing, both love to win,” Ellis said. “We both know what it takes to win. We’ve been there, done that.”\n\nLarry Bird won three NBA titles. Ellis has won a single NBA playoff series. One of them has been there. The other one just thinks he has done that.\n\nLike I say, it’s going to be interesting having Monta Ellis around."
