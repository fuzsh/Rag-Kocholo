        "text": "A few weeks after announcing his desire to return to the NBA, Monta Ellis is reportedly in Las Vegas working out for \"at least\" three NBA teams.\n\nThe former Lanier High School standout flew out to Las Vegas on Tuesday and will conduct private workouts for the teams until Saturday, Elite Sports Media reported. The 35-year-old reportedly turned down a \"lucrative\" offer to play in China last season, and is still set to make $2.5 million from the Indiana Pacers this season after the franchise waived him in 2017.\n\nMORE ON ELLIS' COMEBACK: Jackson native Monta Ellis says he wants another shot in NBA at age 35\n\n'IT WAS TIME TO BRING IT BACK HOME': Lanier basketball wins first state title since 2007\n\n\"My main thing is, just bring me in and give me a look,\" Ellis previously said, according to Elite Sports Media. \"Like you could make the decision on me. I just want a shot. I ain’t asking for a contract to get $5 million, $10 million or even $1 million. All I’m asking is, give me a look. That’s all and let my game speak for itself. I just want an opportunity, a workout, and that’s not the end of the world, that’s not gonna hurt anybody. I will pay my own plane ticket and hotel to go to a workout.”\n\nEllis hasn't played in the NBA since the Pacers waived him four years ago. He's averaged 17.8 points, 4.6 assists and 3.5 rebounds in his 12-year career. Ellis entered the 2005 NBA Draft straight out of Lanier when the Golden State Warriors selected him with the 40th overall pick. He's also played for the Milwaukee Bucks and Dallas Mavericks in his career.\n\nContact Rashad Milligan at 601-862-6198 or Jmilligan@gannett.com. Follow @RashadMilligan on Twitter."
