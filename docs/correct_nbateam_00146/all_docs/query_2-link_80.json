        "text": "Monta Ellis, Milwaukee Bucks – The general consensus around the league is that Ellis is going to exercise his Early Termination Option after this season, leaving $11,000,000 on the table to become an unrestricted free agent. In recent years, Ellis has expressed interest in joining a contender. After all, Ellis has been to the playoffs just once in his career, and it was during the 2006-07 season when he was still coming off of the bench for the Golden State Warriors. He has had plenty of individual success, but he wants to experience the postseason and have the opportunity to perform on that big stage. Milwaukee missed the playoffs last year and enters this season as bubble team in the Eastern Conference, so Ellis may be eyeing greener pastures. If the Bucks aren’t confident that they can retain Ellis, they may decide to trade him prior to the deadline. After parting ways with Andrew Bogut to land the 26-year-old guard, they can’t afford to lose him for nothing.\n\nMonta Ellis: “My approach this year is, ‘Just win.’ That’s something we all have to come together as a team to do. It’s not an individual guy. It’s not Monta Ellis. This is the Milwaukee Bucks. We all line up as the Milwaukee Bucks. At the end of the day, that’s what we’re accountable for. So I want to lead by example, address issues when they need to be addressed and just play basketball.”\n\n“We just have to work off each other,” Ellis said. “There may be one night that he has it going. We just have to continue to go with that. Some nights, I might have it going. But my thing with Brandon is to keep the press, the media, out of his ear and not let him feed into it. That’s the biggest thing with me and Brandon. All he has to do is play basketball. I don’t really have to tell him too much. All I have to do is keep his mind focused.\n\nWhile Jennings was willing to discuss his contract status, his backcourt teammate, Monta Ellis, wasn’t as receptive. Ellis, who will be paid $11 million this season, has an opt-out clause in contract after this season. By all indications, talks to extend his contract aren’t encouraging. Ellis certainly gave that impression after meeting with reporters following Tuesday’s practice. When I queried Ellis about his contract, he responded “I don’t want to talk about that.’’ He then walked away.\n\nMilwaukee potentially could run opponents ragged with the backcourt of Jennings and Ellis. Jennings (19.1 points per game last season) will be playing for a contract, as the Bucks passed on offering him a long-term extension, while Ellis (20.4) has been on the cusp of All-Star level for three years but has to prove he is more than a high scorer on a downtrodden team. Coming to Milwaukee allowed Ellis to return to his natural shooting guard position after the Warriors attempted to play him at point for years. “If you asked Brandon and Monta today, they’d probably say, ‘We’re comfortable now,’ ” Hammond said. “When we traded for Monta, he’s a guy who scored through his career. But we realized he’s a good passer, a willing passer.\n\nLike Ellis, Jennings had little to say about his contract status, noting, “I think that’s why players hire agents, so they can take care of that.” Jennings is represented by Bill Duffy. Jennings, now in his fourth pro season, will be paid $3.17 million for the 2012-13 campaign. He is eligible for a maximum contract extension of nearly $58 million over four seasons – or $14.5 million annually. While Duffy will most certainly push for a max contract for his client, it’s highly doubtful the Bucks, who have repeatedly said they would like to reach an agreement with Jennings, will agree to those demands."
