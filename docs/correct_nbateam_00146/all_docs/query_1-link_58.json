        "text": "American basketball player (born 1960)\n\nDale Ellis (born August 6, 1960) is an American former professional basketball player who played in the National Basketball Association (NBA). At various points in his career, Ellis held the record for the most career 3-point field goals made, until Reggie Miller surpassed him. His 1,719 career made three-pointers ranked 2nd in NBA history at the time of his retirement.[1]\n\nAfter his time at the University of Tennessee, Ellis was selected ninth overall in the 1983 NBA draft by the Dallas Mavericks. His time as a shooting guard with the Mavericks was rather unremarkable as he played scant minutes and was often relegated to sitting on the bench.\n\nEllis' fortunes changed dramatically after he found himself traded to the Seattle SuperSonics for Al Wood on July 23, 1986. His playing time increased significantly, and his regular season scoring average reflected this as it jumped from 7.1 points per game with the Mavericks to 24.9 points per game with the SuperSonics.[2] In his Seattle debut, Ellis scored 23 points and grabbed 4 rebounds in a 127–110 win over the Trail Blazers.[3] Ellis' rise with the SuperSonics was recognized around the league, which awarded him the NBA Most Improved Player Award in 1987.\n\nEllis continued to star for the SuperSonics in the late 1980s. Ellis made four-point plays in a win against the Sacramento Kings on January 26, 1988, becoming the first player in NBA history to complete two four point plays in one game.[4] His scoring average peaked at 27.5 points per game during the 1988–89 season, which would be a career high. That season, on January 5, Ellis scored 49 points in a 120–106 victory over the Kings.[5] The 2,253 points he scored that season broke Spencer Haywood's franchise record of 2,251. Ellis was selected to the NBA All-Star Game during the same season, and scored 27 points for the West. Despite success in Seattle, Ellis' tenure was tumultuous, and included a drunk driving incident in which he was hospitalized, a fist fight with teammate Xavier McDaniel, and a bizarre fight between Ellis' wife, Monique Ellis, and Alton Lister's wife.[6][7] In all, Ellis spent four and a half seasons with the SuperSonics before once again being traded, this time to the Milwaukee Bucks for Ricky Pierce. While he was again a bench player with the Bucks, his minutes still remained relatively high and Ellis still made large contributions to the team with his scoring ability. Following the conclusion of the 91–92 season, he found himself traded to the San Antonio Spurs for Tracy Murray. As a member of the Spurs, Ellis once again found himself in the starting lineup playing slightly more minutes than he did as a Buck. Although his production largely remained the same, he was doing it more efficiently, shooting nearly 50% from the field as opposed to 46% with Milwaukee.\n\nAfter signing with the Denver Nuggets, and then later in his career traded to the SuperSonics once again, the Orlando Magic (for whom he never played), again to the Bucks, and the Charlotte Hornets, he saw a more reduced playing role. The Hornets traded him to the Miami Heat after the 1999–2000 season;[8] but was waived prior to the start of the next season.[9]\n\nEllis played in 1,209 games and had career averages of 15.7 points per game, 3.5 rebounds per game, a .479 field goal percentage, and a .403 three point field goal percentage. He set the NBA record for most minutes played in a single game when he scored 53 points in 69 minutes (out of a possible 73) for the SuperSonics in a 155–154 quintuple-overtime loss to the Bucks on November 9, 1989. His 1,719 career made three-pointers ranked second in NBA history at the time of his retirement.\n\nLegend GP Games played GS Games started MPG Minutes per game FG% Field goal percentage 3P% 3-point field goal percentage FT% Free throw percentage RPG Rebounds per game APG Assists per game SPG Steals per game BPG Blocks per game PPG Points per game Bold Career high\n\n* Led the league\n\nYear Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 1983–84 Dallas 67 2 15.8 .456 .414 .719 3.7 .8 .6 .1 8.2 1984–85 Dallas 72 4 18.3 .454 .385 .740 3.3 .8 .6 .1 9.3 1985–86 Dallas 72 1 15.1 .411 .364 .720 2.3 .5 .6 .1 7.1 1986–87 Seattle 82 76 37.5 .516 .358 .787 5.5 2.9 1.3 .4 24.9 1987–88 Seattle 75 73 37.2 .503 .413 .767 4.5 2.6 1.0 .1 25.8 1988–89 Seattle 82 82 38.9 .501 .478 .816 4.2 2.0 1.3 .3 27.5 1989–90 Seattle 55 49 37.0 .497 .375 .818 4.3 2.0 1.1 .1 23.5 1990–91 Seattle 30 24 26.7 .463 .303 .738 3.1 2.1 1.1 .1 15.0 1990–91 Milwaukee 21 0 29.7 .486 .441 .707 3.9 1.5 .8 .2 19.3 1991–92 Milwaukee 81 11 27.0 .469 .419 .774 3.1 1.3 .7 .2 15.7 1992–93 San Antonio 82 76 33.3 .499 .401 .797 3.8 1.3 1.0 .2 16.7 1993–94 San Antonio 77 75 33.6 .494 .395 .776 3.3 1.0 .9 .1 15.2 1994–95 Denver 81 3 24.6 .453 .403 .866 2.7 .7 .5 .1 11.3 1995–96 Denver 81 52 32.4 .479 .412 .760 3.9 1.7 .7 .1 14.9 1996–97 Denver 82 51 35.9 .414 .364 .817 3.6 2.0 .7 .1 16.6 1997–98 Seattle 79 0 24.5 .497 .464* .782 2.3 1.1 .8 .1 11.8 1998–99 Seattle 48 5 25.7 .441 .433 .757 2.4 .8 .5 .1 10.3 1999–00 Milwaukee 18 0 18.0 .465 .354 .667 1.9 .3 .3 .0 6.8 1999–00 Charlotte 24 5 10.0 .328 .400 .750 .9 .3 .3 .0 2.3 Career 1,209 589 28.8 .479 .403 .784 3.5 1.4 .8 .2 15.7 All-Star 1 1 26.0 .750 1.000 1.000 6.0 2.0 .0 .0 27.0\n\nYear Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 1984 Dallas 8 – 22.3 .325 .083 .750 5.3 .5 1.3 .3 7.4 1985 Dallas 4 1 17.0 .435 .400 .500 1.8 .8 1.0 .0 5.8 1986 Dallas 7 0 9.6 .409 .583 1.000 1.0 .3 .3 .3 4.3 1987 Seattle 14 14 37.9 .487 .361 .815 6.4 2.6 .7 .4 25.2 1988 Seattle 5 5 34.4 .482 .250 .724 4.6 3.0 .6 .4 20.8 1989 Seattle 8 8 38.0 .450 .405 .727 4.0 1.3 1.4 .1 22.9 1993 San Antonio 10 10 30.5 .451 .313 .813 3.5 1.1 .4 .0 12.5 1994 San Antonio 4 4 28.5 .395 .294 .600 2.5 .3 .8 .0 10.5 1995 Denver 3 0 24.3 .357 .308 .923 4.7 1.0 .7 .3 12.0 1998 Seattle 10 0 17.0 .377 .423 .833 1.3 .6 .2 .0 5.6 Career 73 42 27.1 .443 .351 .784 3.7 1.3 .7 .2 13.8\n\nList of National Basketball Association career 3-point scoring leaders\n\nList of National Basketball Association career 3-point field goal percentage leaders\n\nList of National Basketball Association career games played leaders"
