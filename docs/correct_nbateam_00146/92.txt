If people thought that the movie about the world ending in 2012 was giving everyone a hard time, wait till you hear Monta Ellis’ story about his trade from the Golden State Warriors in the same year.

The Warriors picked Ellis in the 2005 NBA draft, and he never enjoyed a successful time with them. The team hardly found success, until Steve Kerr took over and crafted a whole new dynasty. Ellis joined Wes Goldberg on the ‘Locked on Warriors’ podcast, where he revealed the details of the trade between the Warriors and the Bucks.

Speaking about the trade that happened years back, Ellis recently said, “Heartbreaking. It was the turning point of my career. The killer part was I had just talked to them before I left the hotel and they told me they weren’t going to trade me.”

The Warriors broke the word of agreement. Apart from breaking it, they even failed to inform Ellis about the confirmed trade. “I leave the hotel and get to the arena,” Monta explained. “And I go in and one my teammates — Dominic McGuire — he said, ‘Bro, you’ve been traded.'”

We let it (the bottom line news ticker) come all the way back around and it said: ‘Breaking news, Monta Ellis traded.'”
