The speedy Monta Ellis, who led the Golden State Warriorsâ€™ run-and-gun offense in the pre-Steph Curry era, eventually ended up as a productive veteran on the Pacers before dropping out of the league. Ellis was a signature athlete for AND1 until 2011, where he released the stylish And1 ME8 Empire Mid shoe. He then switched to Jordan brand shoes for several years before finally signing an official endorsement deal with them in 2014. Near the end of his NBA career, Ellis had been wearing the Air Jordan 31 shoes, while mixing in kicks like the Retro 12 and Super.Fly.
