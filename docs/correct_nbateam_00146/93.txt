According to a report from Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports, the Golden State Warriors attended a Las Vegas workout featuring Monta Ellis. Amar’e Stoudemire was also part of the workout, as the two former NBA players hope to make their way back into the league.

Ellis returning to the Warriors is lots of fun to think about, even if it’s entirely unrealistic. In addition to the obvious downfalls of Ellis - he doesn’t fit an area of need for the team, doesn’t match their timeline, and likely isn’t good anymore - Golden State doesn’t have any money to spend on a player.

According to ESPN’s Bobby Marks, the Warriors are only $219,000 underneath the tax apron that hard caps the team this year (that includes the presumed waiving of Shaun Livingston). Barring a trade, they cannot sign any other players.

Still, the Warriors are doing due diligence, and it certainly is nostalgic for Golden State fans. And hey, if you want to scout for yourself, have at it, with his footage from earlier in the summer:

Ellis was drafted by the Warriors in 2005, and played in Golden State until he was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks during the 2011-12 season. The shooting guard averaged 19.6 points per game during his Warriors tenure. The 33-year old last played in 2016-17 for the Indiana Pacers, his fourth NBA franchise.

Stoudemire hasn’t played since 2015-16, when he averaged 5.8 points and 4.3 rebounds for the Miami Heat. The six-time All-Star is 36.

While the Warriors don’t currently have the money to make any additional moves this offseason, it would appear that they’re keeping all of their avenues open.
