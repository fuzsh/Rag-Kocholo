        "text": "‘Battlestar Galactica’ (1978-1979, 2004-2009)\n\nThe sci-fi series ran for one season on ABC in the '70s before breathing new life on the Sci-Fi Channel. Larson created the original, which starred Lorne Greene, Richard Hatch and Dirk Benedict and focused on mankind's battle with the Cylons. The reboot starred Edward James Olmos, Mary McDonnell and Katee Sackhoff.\n\n‘Buck Rogers in the 25th Century’ (1979-1981)\n\nHe developed the sci-fi series, bringing Buck Rogers to the small screen for NBC for two seasons. It centered on a pilot (Gil Gerard) who through a freak accident is frozen, only to awake hundreds of years later. The pilot episode was released in theaters as a feature film.\n\n‘B.J. and the Bear’ (1979 – 1981)\n\nGreg Evigan starred as B.J., a trucker who traveled aroudn the U.S. with his chimp friend, who was named bear (naturally). The show has retained some major pop culture cache, with it being referenced in everything from 30 Rock to South Park to Breaking Bad. In Mallrats, Jason Lee's character remarked, \"Why don't they ever bring back or remake good shows, like BJ and the Bear? Now there's a concept I can't get enough of, a man and his monkey.\"\n\n‘Knight Rider’ (1982-1986)\n\nLarson created the popular series that starred David Hasselhoff as crime fighter Michael Knight, who was aided by his talking car KITT. The show aired for four seasons and continues to make its mark on popular culture, having been developed various times over the years as a feature film.\n\n‘Simon and Simon’ (1981-1989)\n\nGerald McRaney and Jameson Parker played brothers who were in charge of a private detective agency on the CBS series. Larson did not create this series but co-wrote a crossover episode with his series Magnum, P.I. that helped launch Simon and Simon's popularity.\n\n‘Automan’ (1983-1984)\n\nThis one says '80s like nothing else. The show centered on a police officer/programmer (Desi Arnez, Jr.) who invented a crime-fighting hologram named Automan (Chuck Wagner). The show was created by Larson and ran for just 13 episodes. And yep, Arnez is related to that Desi. He's the son of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz.\n\n‘Cover Up’ (1984-1985)\n\nThis Larson-created CBS action series starred Jennifer O'Neill and Jon-Erik Hexum, who was later replaced by Antony Hamilton. It focused on a fashion photographer trying to learn who killed her husband.\n\n‘Knight Rider 2000’ (1991)\n\nThe TV movie sequel to the original series Knight Rider starred David Hasselhoff and Susan Norman, whose characters were tasked with finding the mayor's assassin. The movie introduced a souped-up version of KITT known as the Knight 4000.\n\n‘P.S. I Luv U’ (1992-1994)\n\nGreg Evigan played a cop and Connie Sellecca was an ex-con who were placed in witness protection and posed as a married couple working at a detective agency. The show, co-created by Larson, aired on CBS for 13 episodes.\n\n‘Night Man’ (1997-1999)\n\nThe syndicated action show was created by Larson and based on the comics series from Marvel and Malibu Comics. Matt McColm portrayed a saxophone player who became a superhero after being struck by lightning."
