        "text": "Plant Breeding Roles in R&D This is not a job posting but an explanation of what these folks do. Plant breeding ðŸŒ½ ðŸŒ± is the science of improving plant genetics for human benefit. It can be split into two main categoriesâ€“research and developmentâ€“colloquially known as R&D. However, a plant breeder hardly works alone, as many other roles and teams enable the development of new varieties and hybrids. Here are some of those (not an exhaustive list), where they fit, and their responsibilities: ðŸ‘‰ Research: â–¶ Genetics/Genomics - identify and understand genesâ€™ functions and decode genomes. â–¶ Biotechnology - uses molecular biology tools to identify and develop trans- and cis-genic events. â–¶ Entomology/Pathology - study the impact of insects/pathogens to develop control strategies. â–¶ Weed control - understand weed biology and develop strategies to control them. â–¶ Statisticians and data scientists help plan experiments and analyze data. ðŸ‘‰ Development: â–¶ Trait integration - introgress traits of interest into the germplasm. â–¶ Operations - manage field/greenhouse activities to create populations to be tested. â–¶ Agronomy/Field testing - plant, manage, and harvest the plants in the field. â–¶ Breeder - collects, visualizes, and analyzes trait data and makes advancement decisions. â–¶ Statisticians and data scientists help plan experiments and analyze data. Depending on the size of the breeding program, these may vary. In industry, the majority of responsibilities of these roles/teams are separate and clearly defined. However, these roles may be merged for public and academic programs. Other teams, such as market development, commercial, and regulatory affairs, deal with the commercialization and regulations of the developed varieties and hybrids, but they are out of the scope of R&D. #plantbreeding"
