        "text": "Movies based in space have a natural appeal to me, with the Clint Eastwood directed Space Cowboys (2000) being an appreciated representative. Adventure, action and thrills intersperse with a story more than forty-years in the making. Lines blurred at the beginnings of the United States space program’s involvement with the U.S. Air Force and NASA, a story that includes Skylab came into the story set more than twenty-years into the past of the current day.\n\nThe decaying orbit of an old Soviet Union satellite using technology technology designed by Frank Corvin as portrayed by Clint Eastwood and Toby Stephens brings the past into the present day. It is Bob Gerson, as portrayed by James Cromwell and Billie Worley, who seemingly central roles in the distant past and the movie’s present helps introduce the necessary links that initiate the story of getting Frank, who had pined for space flight since the 1950s, into space.\n\nFrank had friends from the beginning storyline who shared similar hopes of becoming astronauts. When the possibility to go to space is introduced to Frank, getting seats on a space shuttle for Hawk Hawkins as portrayed by Tommy Lee Jones and Eli Craig, Jerry O’Neil as portrayed by Donald Sutherland and John Asher, and Tank Sullivan as portrayed by James Garner and Matt McColm becomes job number one.\n\nThe internal workings at NASA, along with the opportunity for publicity, mixes Frank, Hawk, Jerry and Tank into a mission to recover the satellite aboard fictional Space Shuttle Daedalus. Bob Gerson aims to spoil this chance at space for the elder statesmen with a younger set of astronauts poised to learn from Frank and his friends. Ethan Glance and Roger Hines, as portrayed by Loren Dean and Courtney B. Vance, respectively, ride to space with the elder statesmen as part of Team Daedalus.\n\nIntrigue is found on the mission in space thanks to intrigue tracing back to the KGB. Powerful ramifications are felt for the men in space as well as for people in ground control. Flight director Gene Davis along with Hawk Hawkins love interest Sara Holland, as portrayed, respectively, by William Devane and Marcia Gay Harden, gain their feet in the second half of the movie; the subterfuge of General Vostove, as portrayed by Rade Serbedzija, is paired with a surprise dance partner that knew full well, along with Ethan, the true stakes in play in space. The departing shot of the movie, accompanied by the music of Frank Sinatra, provides a surprisingly uplifting joyous note to the closing of the movie.\n\nWriting credits for Space Cowboys rest with Ken Kaufman and Howard Klausner. I grant Space Cowboys as directed by Clint Eastwood 3.75-stars on a scale of 1-to-5.\n\nMatt – Wednesday, April 10, 2024\n\nCrime. Drama. Thrills. Intensely drawn characters. The movie No Country for Old Men (2007) as directed by Joel Coen and Ethan Coen is drawn from the 2005 Cormac McCarthy book No Country for Old Men. The dark violence and stylistic complexity from the book translated to the something equally dark and complex with the movie. Join us in learning a bit more.\n\nWe come upon hunter Llewelyn Moss in the western fringes of Texas in the desert near El Paso when Moss discovers the aftermath of a drug deal gone horribly wrong. Moss, as portrayed by Josh Brolin, does nothing to render aid for the lone survivor of the carnage; he does decide to walk away with the large sum of money along the way. Moss offers few details to his wife Carl Jean, as portrayed by Kelly Macdonald, when getting home with the spoils. The pair are clear with one another that the heat of those looking to recover the money will be looking for them.\n\nThe notion that someone who would know that their money was missing would come behind the desert carnage was of little mystery to sheriff Ed Tom Bell and deputy Wendell. Tommy Lee Jones and Garret Dillahunt portrayed the sheriff and deputy, respectively. Bell, who we learn had been sheriff from a young age, aims to help Llewelyn and Carla Jean Moss navigate this situation with their lives, if he could. We find that Bell is on a journey of his own through the course of this movie.\n\nThat the single-minded, psychopathic and eccentric Anton Chigurh is on a mission to recover the stolen money soon becomes clear. That Chigurh isn’t your typical man out for money is clear as Chigurh has an intense yet brief interaction with a Gas Station Proprietor as portrayed by Gene Jones. Javier Bardem portrayed Anton Chigurh. Besides having armed himself with a homemade sawed-off shotgun with a coffee-can silencer and a trademark compressed air-driven cattle gun, Chigurh carries with him an eccentric philosophical conviction that he is merely an agent of fate.\n\nMultiple men are pursuing the recovery of the money in the wind from the drug deal gone wrong. Carson Wells, as portrayed by Woody Harrelson, pursues Chigurh and the money after being hired for expressly this purpose by the character portrayed by Stephen Root. Wells aids in bolstering the backstory of Anton Chigurh, whose eccentricity defies explanation for some without the explication a scene between Wells and the man who hired him offers.\n\nThe fates of many are messy throughout the course of No Country for Old Men. Few if any come out of the mayhem of this story clean, with Chigurh, Wells and others are sharing in some measure of this fate. Where the characters stake their claim in this regard feels like a clear and present message throughout the film. This thematic exploration offers a measuring stick for the success of the storytelling, if my estimation offers a sufficient guidepost for your thoughts of this film.\n\nThe movie No Country for Old Men earned three BAFTAs and four Academy Awards in 2008 for direction, acting and adapted screenplay. Ethan Coen and Joel Coen adapted the screenplay from the Cormac McCarthy book, with Javier Bardem claiming a BAFTA and an Academy Award. I grant the movie No Country for Old Men as directed by Joel Coen and Ethan Coen 4.25-stars on a scale of 1-to-5.\n\nMatt – Wednesday, February 2, 2022\n\nThe science fiction movie Ad Astra (2019) hit theaters in the United States three weekends ago with minimal fanfare. The cinematic look in paying homage to space movies past does it credit for visually resembling some of the better cinema in the space film genre. While I appreciate the touch of space tourism of 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and the multi-dimensional imagery that accompanied Interstellar (2014), this film lands somewhere closer to First Man (2018) as far as storytelling success.\n\n(Ruth Negga as Helen Lantos, left, and Brad Pitt as Roy McBride in the film Ad Astra).\n\nBrad Pitt stars as astronaut Roy McBride, who takes a space quest across the solar system in search of his father. H. Clifford McBride, played by Tommy Lee Jones, is the father who seeks intelligent life towards the limits of the navigable solar system in a hypothetical near term reality. Ruth Negga plays Helen Lantos, a character whose life story in inextricably intertwined with both McBrides.\n\n(Tommy Lee Jones as H. Clifford McBride in the film Ad Astra).\n\nDonald Sutherland plays Thomas Pruitt, a former astronaut. H. Clifford McBride reportedly had some harsh history with H. Clifford, and it was in part his task to escort Roy from the Earth to the moon to Mars for a crucial mission to save the fate of the world. Pruitt’s character is important for informing the emotional relevance of the back story of the McBrides.\n\n(Donald Sutherland as Thomas Pruitt in the film Ad Astra).\n\nJames Gray co-wrote and directed the film Ad Astra. The physical takes of offering insight into the colonization of the moon and Mars as a means for getting to the outer solar system makes for some solar system engineering. The resource combat and the science experiments that were parts of the film, combined with the notion of space tourism, really interested my inner nerd.\n\n(James Gray directed and co-wrote the film Ad Astra).\n\nParts of the larger story, and the means of getting sense out of this story, were not the best I’ve seen in the genre of spaceflight related science fiction. The panache of a father son story did not bear the intrigue of a book by Ray Bradbury or a movie by Christopher Nolan. Most movies with spaceflight in the concept are possible points of interest for me. Unless you simply need a Brad Pitt fix, my recommendation is to wait for the DVD or streaming service to see this film. My grade for the film Ad Astra is 3.25-stars on a scale of one-to-five.\n\nMatt – Saturday, October 12, 2019\n\nAre you looking for a well told, action filled, star studded movie to watch this weekend? I suggest seeking The Fugitive (1993), a movie that tells the story of Dr. Richard Kimble, a man unjustly accused of murdering his wife. Kimble escapes prison in accidental circumstances, after which he sets out to find the real killer while being the target of a nationwide manhunt led by a seasoned U.S. Marshal.\n\n(Harrison Ford as Dr. Richard Kimble in The Fugitive).\n\nHarrison Ford stars as Dr. Richard Kimble, the namesake of the movie who starts the movie being unjustly convicted of murdering his wife. Helen Kimble is played by Sela Ward, who we meet after her death in the form of memories offered to the audience through the memory of her husband. The larger story of the hunt for tracking Dr. Kimble starts after a prisoner transport fails miserably thanks to efforts of other inmates to initiate an escape.\n\n(Harrison Ford, left, and Sela Ward in The Fugitive).\n\nTommy Lee Jones plays Samuel Gerard, a seasoned United States Marshall tasked with the effort to bring Richard Kimble to justice following Kimble’s escape. Jones won an Academy Award for his portrayal, which served a strong role and counterpoint within the search and larger narrative that were strong within this film.\n\n(Joe Pantoliano, left, Tommy Lee Jones, center, and Daniel Roebuck in The Fugitive).\n\nTwo deputy United States Marshalls on the task force aiming to catch Richard Kimble were Cosmo Renfro, as played by Joe Pantoliano, and Robert Biggs, as played by Daniel Roebuck. Through multiple near captures over the course of the film, what the story underpinning The Fugitive gives us is the thrill of the hunt combined with the drama and mystery of Dr. Richard Kimble’s efforts to offer the proof that will grant him his exoneration.\n\n(Tommy Lee Jones, left, and Julianne Moore in The Fugitive).\n\nJulianne Moore as Dr. Anne Eastman figures into part of the effort aimed at almost capturing Dr. Richard Kimble. Kimble finds his way into a hospital with false credentials as a janitor, wherein he commences a search for information that can offer proof around who might have had motive and opportunity to profit from silencing Kimble. During these efforts, Kimble intercedes on the behalf of a patient under the care of Eastman at a hospital.\n\n(Andreas Katsulas as Fredrick Sykes in The Fugitive).\n\nThe initial investigation that Dr. Kimble uncovers as part of his attempted exoneration is the identity of the one-armed man that he, Kimble, has argued is responsible for the death of Helen Kimble. Making this identification leads Richard Kimble to a further drug trial that leads to his friend, schoolmate, and colleague Dr. Charles Nichols. Jeroen Krabbé portrayed Dr. Nichols.\n\n(Jeroen Krabbé as Dr. Charles Nichols in The Fugitive).\n\nSuspense and intrigue are full blown, well-orchestrated qualities of The Fugitive. Writing credits for the movie went to Jeb Stuart, David Twohy, and Roy Huggins. The execution of this chase thriller movie is among the best created, in my humble opinion. It is for this reason that I offer the The Fugitive 4.0-stars on a scale of one-to-five stars.\n\nMatt – Saturday, March 02, 2019"
