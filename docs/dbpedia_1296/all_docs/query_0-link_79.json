        "text": "The 29th Slamdance Film Festival, the premiere film festival and organization “by filmmakers, for filmmakers,” today announced its lineup for Narrative Features Competition, Documentary Features Competition, Breakouts, Unstoppable, and Spotlight Screenings.\n\nWith titles hailing from all over the globe and jam-packed with premieres, the 2023 festival continues its legacy of discovering fresh and influential new voices.\n\nDedicated to providing accessible programming both in-person and online, the 2023 hybrid festival will return this year with events in Park City and Salt Lake City, Utah from Jan. 20-26 and online on the Slamdance Channel from Jan. 23-29.\n\n“From the streets of Seattle to the psychedelic skies of a unicorn-run dystopia, our filmmakers are transporting audiences to new dimensions with stories that explore the nuance of disability, immigration and gender. This year’s lineup represents a generation of new directors who are breaking boundaries and redefining what filmmaking looks like in 2023,” stated Festival Manager Lily Yasuda.\n\nThis year’s lineup was chosen from over 7,600 total submissions, 1,522 of which were features. All films selected in the Narrative Features and Documentary Features competition categories are directorial debuts without U.S. distribution, with budgets of less than $1 million USD – a feature that has been unique to Slamdance since its founding in 1995. While Slamdance’s main competition remains exclusive to first-time directors, the Breakouts program – launched in 2019 – is designed to serve directors beyond their first films who maintain distinct visual styles and a unique cinematic voice.\n\nSlamdance is global. In the spirit of bringing audience members a diverse and colorful array of stories, this year’s lineup represents projects from 13 different countries from around the world with projects hailing from The Netherlands, Japan, South Korea, Serbia, Poland, Germany, Laos, India, and the Philippines among others. A collection that defies convention and categorization, this year’s lineup offers experimental and exciting films that will introduce audiences to unique and spirited voices they can’t experience anywhere else.\n\nIn addition to Slamdance’s Opening Night Film Moby’s PUNK ROCK VEGAN MOVIE, the festival will also showcase two additional Spotlight Feature Screenings – DOWNWIND (dir. Mark Shapiro and Douglas Brian Miller) and the festival’s Closing Night Film FREE LSD (dir. Dimitri Coats). Narrated by Martin Sheen featuring Lewis Black and Michael Douglas – DOWNWIND is a must-see documentary about nuclear fallout in the United States – specifically in the region of Utah. The film includes members of the Shoshone Nation whose sacred land, despite a treaty, continues to be cordoned off as a nuclear test site, where, for 40 years, large-scale atomic weapons obliterated the landscape and exposed people (Downwinders), the environment and livestock to deadly fallout.\n\nContinuing in the punk rock spirit is the World Premiere of FREE LSD which is this year’s Closing Night feature. Featuring appearances from Keith Morris and Jack Black, FREE LSD follows one man’s inter-dimensional journey where, after using an experimental drug to cure a personal problem, he is provided a glimpse into a parallel universe where he is not only the singer of the band OFF!, but also the target of an evil alien species that will stop at nothing to prevent the group from making a new album which holds the key to an awakening of human consciousness. In concert with Moby’s PUNK ROCK VEGAN MOVIE, FREE LSD will ensure that music-themed films bookend the 29th edition of the DIY festival.\n\nWhether onsite or online, Slamdance 2023 remains committed to accessibility throughout the festival. Not able to travel to Park City for the festival? No problem. The full array of Slamdance’s titles are available on the Slamdance Channel which can be accessed worldwide on Roku, Amazon Fire Stick, and Apple TV. Subscriptions are $7.99 per month and grant access to the festival’s full lineup. More information about the Slamdance Channel can be found online at slamdancechannel.com\n\nIn addition to the festival’s online offerings, its in-person programming is also committed to accessibility with the Unstoppable program will be held for the first time in person at the Student Union Theater at the University of Utah from January 23rd to 25th and will be free to the public. Founded in 2021, the Unstoppable Program includes a showcase of new films by creators with visible and non-visible disabilities.\n\n“For Slamdance Unstoppable 2023, our programmers are excited to present a dynamic lineup of films that span not just different genres but also various time periods, cultural groups, stages of life, and modes of expression. Our community contains multitudes and this year’s films reflect that! The vigor and spirit of the filmmakers in our program prove that no attempt to marginalize disabled people will ever defeat our human capacity and drive for storytelling, or stop us from authentically being ourselves,” said Beth Prouty, Unstoppable co-captain and programmer\n\nThe remainder of the Slamdance Film Festival’s 2023 programming including the Animated, Experimental, Unstoppable, Narrative, and Documentary Shorts programs as well as the Digital, Interactive and Gaming (DIG) and Episodes lineup will be announced on Dec. 12.\n\nIn-person passes and Slamdance Channel subscriptions can be purchased now at slamdance.com/passes. Individual tickets will begin going on sale from December 12th at slamdance.com\n\nAdditional information on this year’s lineup slamdance.com.\n\n2023 features programming includes:\n\nSpotlight Feature Screenings:\n\nDownwind (United States) World Premiere.

The latter was the site for the testing of 928 nuclear weapons on American soil from 1951 to 1992. The fallout is still lethally impacting Americans today. Martin Sheen narrates this harrowing exposé of the United States’ disregard for everyone living… DOWNWIND. Downwind is topical and global in context — but it’s also very deeply tied to Utah and the American West. The film includes members of the Shoshone Nation whose sacred land, despite a treaty, continues to be cordoned off as a nuclear test site, where, for 40 years, large-scale atomic weapons obliterated the landscape and exposed people (Downwinders), the environment and livestock to deadly fallout.
