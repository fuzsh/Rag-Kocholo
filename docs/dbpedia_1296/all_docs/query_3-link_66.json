With his computer-hacker younger brother, Slade travels to a resort on the Russian-Turkish border to begin his quest. To his surprise and dismay, he's now joined by another secret agent, a beautiful but highly-skilled woman named Alex. As they begin diving in search of the downed jetliner, Slade and Alex begin to suspect they're being manipulated by higher-ups who may not be committed to American interests.",

        "text": "\"The CIA is many things, but it is not stupid.\"\n\nWomen Film Editors #98: Marion Segal\n\nFrom 1956 to 1983, Marion Sobol was married to the actor George Segal; their union produced two children and several credits in Marion's developing filmography, including as an additional/associate editor on Badlands (1973), California Split (1974) and Days of Heaven (1978), as well as being the main editor on another of her husband's vehicles, Carbon Copy (1981). After their divorce, Marion remarried to filmmaker Herb Freed - he's probably best known for the horror flicks Haunts (1976), Beyond Evil (1980) and Graduation Day (1981) - staying together from 1985 until Marion's death in 2011, aged 77.\n\nDuring Marion and Herb's marriage, they collaborated on…\n\nStandard '90s action junk that's high on repetitive espionage talk and low on what you watch these for from the director of Graduation Day (1981), Beyond Evil (1980), and the underappreciated Haunts (1976). Only reason I popped this in even though so bland this could've been directed by my aunt or your second cousin.\n\nBrodude Matt McColm, who made a career from playing silent toughs, handles the scant fight sequences well enough. His sketchy acting is masked by the constant presence of a beaming Amanda Pays and dependably scummy Richard Brake. Plenty of terrible day-for-night shots, indecipherable underwater scenes, and an okay warehouse firefight await those who somehow endure to the end. Watched via Platinum Corporation's DVD.\n\nIn this addition of Who Wants to be an Action Star finds Matt McColm diving for a black box from an airplane that went kaboom. Welcome to Subterfuge.\n\nMatt McColm has the action star look, but his acting range isn’t quite there. He does look cool in a bar fight early in the film. His chemistry with Amanda Pays is iffy.\n\nPerhaps the biggest enjoyment is scene stealer, Jason Gould. The child of Barbara Streisand and Elliott Gould is probably the most random sidekick I’ve seen in an action flick. He’s definitely a damn good computer hacker.\n\nSubterfuge’s biggest charm is how fun the film is. It isn’t serious in any way, but it is never too silly either. It is about as good as it could possibly be with the actors / plot involved. I liked it!\n\nThe Russians have shot down a civilian airliner again, and this time, it's a mistake! Devious planet-hackers tricked them so that they'd bring down the plane and its priceless MacGuffin cargo (which was fortunately not incinerated in the blast). The U.S. Government wants answers, so it blackmails former agent turned diving instructor Jonathan Slade (Matt McColm) and his little technophile brother Alfie (Jason Gould) into recovering the item. But is Slade's handler Tencil (Richard Brake) more than just some insane underling to Glynn Turman's CIA boss, and what did Amanda Pays do to end up in a movie like this?\n\nPresumably Subterfuge was the start (and end) of a series of comedic geopolitical romps with the brothers Slade, but this…\n\nTerrible, but ideal for a Saturday afternoon when I want to lie around wallowing in my own filth. Matt McColm was unknown to me but one thing for certain is that he’s a complete fucking goober. During his action-guy exposition setup, two Russians sift through his *computer file* where it lists his occupation as “Beach Bum”. When one asks if he’s involved with a woman, the computer plays a slideshow of lingerie model headshots so you know his character is the most awesomest bro ever.\n\nRichard Brake is here and while he apparently hasn’t aged a day since this was made, he ummmm definitely became a better actor - not his best work. Also features the worst comic relief sidekick…\n\nOne of the handful of starring roles from stuntman Matt McColm. (NightMan/Red Scorpion 2/Cyborg). McColm really shines here, not only in the fighting department, as he has a blackbelt in kenpo karate, he brings a fun presence and personality to the screen. Definitely makes you wonder why he didn't make it bigger as a leading man. Subterfuge is a fun action adventure from the mid 90s, reminiscent of the old Cannon Films days. And that is a high compliment. It is an espionage thriller about the retrevial of a black box from an American jetliner in the Black Sea. His co star Amanda Pays (Leviathan) shines here as well and shares good chemistry with McColm. Jason Gould brings some good comic relief as his 'bullied' sidekick and the rest of the cast is servicable. If you love deep sea diving for action b-movie gems, put Subterfuge on your list!"
