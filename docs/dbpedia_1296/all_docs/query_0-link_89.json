OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ORRIN G. HATCH, A U.S. SENATOR FROM UTAH, CHAIRMAN, COMMITTEE ON FINANCE The Chairman. The committee will come to order. I want to say ``good morning'' and ``welcome'' to every one of you here today to this hearing on the impact of tariffs on the U.S. auto industry. In particular, I would like to welcome our witnesses and thank them for joining us today. I intend to focus this morning on the investigation that was self-initiated by the Department of Commerce under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to determine whether imports of automobiles and automotive parts threaten to impair our national security. Many of us on the committee have already expressed our concerns about the administration's heavy reliance on tariffs. In June, Secretary Ross appeared before this committee to explain the Department's finding that steel and aluminum imports threatened to impair our national security. As a result of that determination, the United States is currently imposing tariffs of 25 percent on steel products and 10 percent on aluminum products. Combined, these tariffs directly affect almost $50 billion worth of goods, while also affecting many billions of dollars more in downstream goods. These tariffs cause American manufacturers and farmers to pay more to conduct business and consumers to pay more to buy these things. One industry that has been harmed by the steel and aluminum tariffs is here before us today--the auto industry. The American Automotive Policy Council estimates steel and aluminum tariffs will cause a $400 per-car increase. Auto suppliers and consumers are already suffering from section 232 tariffs. That is one reason I was stunned that on May 23rd, the Department of Commerce initiated another investigation under section 232, this time into the national security threat from automobile and auto parts imports. This investigation covers more than $200 billion worth of trade, which is four times larger than that under the steel and aluminum investigations combined. For most American families, a car is one of the most expensive purchases they make, often second only to the purchase of a residence or home. It is a significant financial commitment for most families, often paid for with debt. And I am shocked that anyone would consider making it more expensive. If the Department of Commerce were to recommend a 25-percent tariff on cars, it would effectively be recommending raising the cost of an average imported car for an American family by as much as $6,400. According to the American Automotive Policy Council, if a 25-percent tariff is applied to auto parts, the cost to manufacture a passenger vehicle domestically would also increase by about $2,000. That is why I call tariffs a tax on American families. The Tax Foundation estimates that auto tariffs could result in a $73-billion tax increase on American consumers and businesses, erasing some of the benefits of tax reform passed earlier this Congress, something we are very proud of and pleased with. These taxes will hurt American families and put American jobs at risk. The Peterson Institute calculates that auto tariffs could cause 195,000 workers to lose their jobs. That is nearly 200,000 people out of work. And that is before other countries retaliate, which could put over 600,000 U.S. jobs at risk. These tariffs could cost the U.S. auto industry up to 2 million lost vehicle sales annually. And it cannot be overlooked that international automakers and dealers significantly contribute to our U.S. economy. Together they accounted for 47 percent of all U.S. vehicle production in 2017, throughout 31 manufacturing facilities, generating 2.47 million jobs in the United States. And this is just the automakers. Motor vehicle parts suppliers are the largest sector of manufacturing jobs in the United States. Suppliers directly employ over 870,000 Americans, and nearly 8,000 in my home State of Utah alone. Direct employment by parts suppliers has increased 19 percent in the last 5 years, and tariffs threaten the sector's continued job growth. In short, the U.S. auto industry is a major driver of the U.S. economy, supporting approximately 10 million American jobs and accounting for 3 percent of our GDP. Without question, any tariffs that are imposed will have a negative impact on the U.S. auto industry and our economy. Our focus should be on building on the benefits from our historic tax reform achievement earlier this Congress. Our trade policy should strengthen our relationships with our allies while targeting China's most harmful trade practices. Tariffs on autos and auto parts are not going to help us achieve any of these things. With that, I am going to turn to Senator Wyden for his comments. [The prepared statement of Chairman Hatch appears in the appendix.] OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RON WYDEN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM OREGON Senator Wyden. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and I appreciate your scheduling this hearing. Mr. Chairman and colleagues, the President has made it a practice to get up in front of the television cameras, tout new trade deals, reap splashy headlines, but those announcements have been consistently hollow and the results underwhelming. This week's announcement about the U.S.-Korea Trade Agreement says it all. The administration touts it as a massive overhaul of a trade deal that they claim had previously cost hundreds of thousands of American jobs. But if you search carefully for significant changes in this agreement, concrete wins that will deliver red, white, and blue jobs on the scale the President has talked about, you are going to come to the conclusion that there is no ``there'' there. A recent Bloomberg News article summed up the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement very bluntly, and I am just going to quote here: ``Trade analysts say changes to the South Korea agreement were largely cosmetic.'' There is no evidence that the renegotiation will actually result in an increase in the number of American-made cars sold in South Korea. In at least one case, the changes are not even cosmetic. They simply do not exist at all. Earlier this year, the White House even went on record announcing a deal with Korea on currency manipulation. That is nowhere to be found in the final text or anywhere else. So, when it comes to South Korea, the Trump administration over- hyped and under-delivered. And my view is, that is their record on trade in microcosm. In recent months, the President has threatened to impose sweeping tariffs on automobiles. Now, if the administration comes up with a coherent strategy that is actually going to produce more high-paying jobs here at home and greater access for American-made cars and markets overseas, I sure want to know about it. But where things stand now, it looks like this may just be more haphazard bluster. Furthermore, the President's threats to impose auto tariffs are already doing harm at home, stifling investment, likely costing jobs in the long run, and raising costs for American consumers. In one case, Ford announced that it decided not to sell a particular model of car in the United States because of the looming threat of tariffs. So there is the start of Americans having fewer choices when they go out and visit the showrooms. One last point--and one I feel very strongly about--the President believes he has the authority to impose auto tariffs because the Congress gave it to him. So I want to put the administration on notice this morning. Under the Constitution, it is the Congress that is in charge of trade and in charge of tariffs. In the absence of a real strategy and tangible wins on trade, perhaps it is time for the Congress to think about reclaiming this authority. I want to thank our witnesses for coming. This is an important opportunity for the Finance Committee to draw a distinction between two different approaches to trade and autos. The approach I am in favor of is one that is based on concrete well-planned strategies that are actually going to create high-skill, high-wage auto manufacturing jobs and deliver for our workers. But in my view, the administration is delivering--and it's pretty much right out of their playbook--a lot more chaos. It is trade policy dictated by early morning tweets and bluster, and it may end up costing jobs and doing more harm than good. Mr. Chairman, this is an important hearing, and I thank you for scheduling it. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Wyden. [The prepared statement of Senator Wyden appears in the appendix.] The Chairman. I would now like to introduce each of our witnesses who have graciously agreed to be here today to talk to us and answer our questions. I will begin with Mr. Michael Haughey, who is currently the president and CEO of the North American Stamping Group. Mr. Haughey joined the North American Stamping Group in 1990 as a partner. He encouraged and led the company's NAFTA expansion, increasing its manufacturing footprint in the automotive market. Under Mr. Haughey's guidance, the company continued to expand its operations in the United States and North America. So we welcome you to the committee, Mr. Haughey. We will now welcome Mr. Rick Schostek. Mr. Schostek is currently the executive vice president of Honda North America. Mr. Schostek joined Honda in 1987 as an attorney and continued to work within the company in various leadership roles until his promotion in 2012 to senior vice president. He serves on a number of boards, including for Fuel Cell System Manufacturing LLC, Global Automakers, and the National Association of Manufacturers. I want to thank you for coming to speak with us today. And we appreciate your time. Now we turn to our third witness, Mr. Steve Gates. Currently, Mr. Gates is the dealer principal at Gates Auto Family in central Kentucky and Indiana. Mr. Gates began his career as a lot attendant at his father's car dealership in 1965. Since then, Mr. Gates started his own company, worked for BMW in financial services and as a used car manager, and now has realized his ambition of becoming a new car dealer. Mr. Gates serves on the American International Automobile Dealers Association board and the Toyota National Dealer Council. Mr. Gates, we are grateful to have you here and want to thank you very much for being here today. Our fourth witness today is Mr. Josh Nassar. Mr. Nassar is currently the legislative director of the United Auto Workers. Before this position, Mr. Nassar served as the assistant director of legislation for the Service Employees International Union or the SEIU, one of the most important unions in the world, really. Prior to his work at the SEIU, Mr. Nassar had been the vice president for federal affairs at the Center for Responsible Lending, and also served as Legislative Assistant for Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky from Illinois. Mr. Nassar, we thank you for joining us here today as well. Finally, we have H. David Britt. Mr. Britt is the vice chairman of the Spartanburg County Council. In his 25 years on the Spartanburg County Council, Mr. Britt has led numerous economic development efforts, resulting in the county having the highest international investment per capita in the Nation in recent years. So, Mr. Britt, we are grateful to have you here and look forward to your testimony. Let us begin over here with our friend on our left. STATEMENT OF MICHAEL HAUGHEY, PRESIDENT AND CEO, NORTH AMERICAN STAMPING GROUP, PORTLAND, TN Mr. Haughey. Good morning, Chairman Hatch, Ranking Member Wyden, and the other members of the committee. My name is Michael Haughey, and I am the president and chief executive officer of the North American Stamping Group. The North American Stamping Group is a Tier 2 automotive metal stamper and assembler founded back in 1978 that manufactures for both the new original equipment market, as well as the aftermarket. We produce components and assemblies for passenger car, light truck, and commercial vehicles. Our sales have grown annually at a compounded rate of 18 percent for the last 8 years. We are one of the largest Tier 2 suppliers, with annual sales approaching $450 million. We have 13 facilities in the NAFTA region. Over the last decade, we have deployed nearly $200 million in capital spending for new facilities, expanded facilities, new equipment, technologies, processes, and acquisitions. This investment has allowed us to open up significant capacity throughout the entire NAFTA region to support future growth for our strategic customers. Our 13 facilities encompass 1.6 million square feet. Ten of the facilities are production facilities, two are research centers, and one is the sales office. Specific to the United States, we have 10 facilities: one in Michigan, five in Ohio, one in Indiana, and three in Tennessee, employing 1,500 team members. NASG is part of a vibrant supply chain, but keep in mind this supply chain depends on a global market to thrive in the U.S. We applaud the administration and the Republican Congress for the tax cuts. We applaud the administration for the decrease in business regulations that we have enjoyed. We applaud the administration for attempting to level the playing field on trade. However, we do not believe tariffs are the right approach to promote American competitiveness. Our industry is in turmoil. Last year, we were on a bridge from the internal combustion engine to the electric car. However, in the last 6 months, we have come off the rails. Our turmoil includes the administration-proposed changes on CO2 regulations that are currently unresolved and the administration-proposed changes on CAFE regulations that are currently unresolved. Other factors include section 232 steel and aluminum tariffs already implemented, the other 232 tariffs proposed, section 301 tariffs proposed that since this time have now come into effect, what looks like an inevitable trade war, rising oil prices, rising interest rates, auto manufacturers profits decreasing, electric automobile tax credits expiring, the car discount that is reaching unsustainable levels, and increased forecast of a recession based on the preceding points. We thank the committee for holding a hearing today on the impacts of tariffs on the U.S. auto industry. The industry is already feeling the effects of tariffs on steel and aluminum. Since the start of the current administration, steel has risen steadily with the ongoing talks of steel tariffs. The market prices peaked up 50 percent from $600 per ton for hot-rolled steel up to $900 per ton today with the implementation of tariffs on March 23, 2018. Potential outcomes of steel tariffs and the resulting steel price increases include trade partner retaliation--which we have experienced--and a forecast of vehicle prices increasing by $2,000 for U.S.-made and $7,000 for imported vehicles. It is estimated that suppliers like ourselves will have to absorb a third of the steel increases, thereby reducing our earnings. These reduced earnings will result in less technology spending, less capital spending, and fewer wage increases. This will crimp consumer confidence, leading 60 percent of economists to forecast a recession in 2020, which will reduce automobile sales--an estimated decline of 15 percent, resulting in 750,000 to 1.25 million American automobile workers potentially losing their jobs. From an NASG standpoint, we have experienced steel price increases exceeding $10 million annually. So we can believe the car price increases that I noted above. Our share of steel increases, which we are unable to pass on to our Tier 1 customers and the original equipment manufacturers, has a negative consequence to our business. Our actions have included reducing overtime, putting on hold and dramatically paring down all open team member hiring, putting on hold and dramatically paring down capital spending, and reducing all discretionary spending. In summary, I have suspended growing our business until uncertainty in the industry is resolved. Obviously, our actions due to the tariffs have a negative effect on our team members, our suppliers, and our surrounding communities. The sentiment in the industry is similar to 2008 just before the Lehman demise. Our business plans include bracing for a 2019-2020 recession. I thank you for the opportunity to testify today, and I look forward to your questions. The Chairman. Thank you, sir. [The prepared statement of Mr. Haughey appears in the appendix.] The Chairman. Mr. Schostek, we will turn to you now. STATEMENT OF RICK SCHOSTEK, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, HONDA NORTH AMERICA, INCORPORATED, MARYSVILLE, OH Mr. Schostek. Thank you, Chairman Hatch, Ranking Member Wyden, and members of the committee. We appreciate the opportunity to testify today. My name is Rick Schostek. I am executive vice president of Honda North America. I am here on behalf of Honda and our 31,000 associates in the United States. But I share the concerns about the potential impact of auto tariffs with all sectors of the auto industry, including domestic and international automakers, suppliers, dealers, and aftermarket companies. The auto industry is not seeking protection and is certainly not asking for additional tariffs which will harm manufacturing in the U.S., harm our workers, and, most importantly, harm U.S. consumers. Let me give you a brief history of Honda in the U.S. and some statistics. Prior to 1982, when Honda began building the Accord in Ohio, every vehicle we sold in the U.S. was built in Japan--100-percent imported prior to 1982. Since then, a great deal has changed. We have produced more than 25 million vehicles in America. And last year, of the vehicles we sold in the U.S., 66 percent were built in our U.S. factories, 20 percent came from Canada, 7 percent from Mexico, 4 percent from England, and finally--yes, finally--3 percent from Japan. We have gone from 100-percent import to 3 percent from Japan. Our history in America highlights two factors that are critical to attracting and retaining investment: stability and maintaining a welcoming business environment. So let us start with stability. The process of developing a new vehicle takes several years. Each vehicle represents hundreds of millions of dollars of investment and advanced planning. This is where disruptions like new taxes in the form of tariffs come in. These taxes represent an addition to the cost of building a vehicle. These costs must either be passed on to our customers or borne by manufacturers. And this diverts money intended for other critical purposes, including investment in future technologies and capital improvements. The second critical factor is the need for a business environment that welcomes manufacturing. The U.S. has long worked to ensure that manufacturers have an environment that brings the best reasonably priced products to consumers. However, America is now experiencing a fundamental change in the philosophy of open markets, and it is a change that threatens our competitiveness. Tariffs inevitably lead to unanticipated harmful effects. For example, let us talk about the steel tariffs that are now in effect. More than 90 percent of the steel we use to produce our vehicles here is sourced here in America. So we are paying direct tariffs on the less than 10 percent that we import. But even more significantly, domestic steel manufacturers have raised their prices, and this has burdened us with hundreds of millions of dollars in new costs. So, even though we overwhelmingly source steel in the U.S., we are paying as if we are importing. Does that make sense? And on top of that, we are dealing with retaliatory tariffs on our exports. In a similar vein, Honda's North American-built vehicles have high U.S. content, but every manufacturer--no matter which one--that builds vehicles does it with both domestic and globally sourced parts. A new tax on imported parts would increase the price of every vehicle built in U.S. factories. And similarly, a 25-percent tariff on imported vehicles would depress sales. The industry would end up purchasing less from U.S.-based suppliers, resulting in U.S. job loss. It is estimated that the tariffs will increase the price of a new vehicle up to $7,000. Industry-wide, these tariffs will hurt not only jobs in States with auto plants, but wherever there are parts manufacturers, auto dealers, service outlets, and other businesses that serve our industry. In other words, tariffs impact every State in America. As the price of a new car grows beyond the reach of more Americans, the price of used vehicles will also rise, as will the cost of service parts. These tariffs will ripple across all aspects of the auto industry and the broader economy. They will harm American consumers and American workers. The auto industry is already dealing with the impact of the steel and aluminum tariffs. Now we face the addition of new auto and auto parts tariffs--and tack on the pending changes to NAFTA, and the cumulative impact on the industry would be unprecedented. Mr. Chairman, we have seen positive improvements that are helpful to manufacturing, including the historic tax bill which came from this committee and efforts to streamline regulation. We appreciate efforts to remove barriers to trade everywhere, but imposing tariffs in the U.S. will put American workers, American consumers, communities, and the American economy at risk. And for this reason, Honda has joined every automaker doing business in the U.S. in opposing new tariffs on automobiles and auto parts. I look forward to taking the committee's questions, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. Thank you, sir. [The prepared statement of Mr. Schostek appears in the appendix.] The Chairman. Mr. Gates, you are next. STATEMENT OF STEVE GATES, DEALER PRINCIPAL, GATES AUTO FAMILY, RICHMOND, KY Mr. Gates. Good morning, Chairman Hatch, Ranking Member Wyden, and members of the Finance Committee. Thank you for having me here today. My name is Steve Gates, and I am a third- generation car guy. My grandparents, beginning in 1915, would drive from Loogootee, IN to buy one Dodge from the Dodge Brothers and then return to Loogootee to sell it out of a livery stable. My dad was also a car dealer. He became a Chrysler dealer in the early 1950s and a Chevrolet dealer in 1958. Then in 1970--against all odds and against all advice, including my mom's--my dad bet everything on a new brand, Toyota. My grandparents and dad took unbelievable risks, but they knew with hard work, dedication, a plan, and a little luck, anything was possible. I never wanted to do anything other than become a car dealer. From the seventh grade through college, I worked in the parts department, the service department, the body shop, and I washed a lot of cars. My life's dream became reality in 1989, when a great man, Bob McCamy, helped me become a Toyota dealer in Richmond, KY. Today, we sell Toyota, Honda, Lexus, Kia, Hyundai, Nissan, and Audi. And we employ over 500 people in Indiana, Kentucky, and Tennessee. Now a fourth generation, my daughter MacKenzie, has entered the business with us. I have given you my background just so you know that I really understand the retail car business. It is what I love. But why am I here? Because I was stunned to read that the U.S. Department of Commerce opened an investigation into whether imported cars and automotive parts pose a threat to our national security. So I had to come to Washington to fight for my industry, to fight for my family. I used to think if I worked hard and I kept my expenses in line and took care of my customers, that I could at least get by. But if a 25-percent tax is levied on imported vehicles and parts, it will not matter how good a car dealer I am--people cannot or will not buy cars. They would just be too expensive. Affordability concerns are not new to our industry. Over the past 20 years, the average cost of a car has risen 35 percent while household income has grown only 3 percent. And let me dispel a popular myth. All cars sold in the United States contain imported parts. So the cost of all cars will go up. When a customer visits our dealership, among the first questions are, how much is the car and what is the payment? Well, rising interest rates have already raised monthly payments. And I found that the Center for Automotive Research estimated that under a 25-percent tariff, the price of a new car could rise by as much as $7,000. According to Kelley Blue Book, the average transaction price on a new light-duty vehicle in 2017 was $36,000. Again, a 25-percent tax added to the already rapidly rising price would put a new vehicle out of reach of many, if not most American families. Those not in the market for a new car will also be affected. The tariff on parts would drive up the cost of maintenance and repairs. According to the Auto Care Association, each U.S. household will pay an extra $700 per year in increased ownership costs. It gets even worse. As the cost of your car goes up and the cost of parts goes up, the cost of insuring your car goes up. The auto insurance industry testified this summer that under a 25-percent tariff, personal insurance premiums will rise by $3.4 billion. From deregulation to tax reform, the administration and Congress have built a healthy environment for businesses large and small. To maintain full employment, an atmosphere for business investment is crucial to creating a strong economy. Dealers are benefiting from this economy and see new opportunities, but we know that the possible 25-percent tariff will negatively affect our ability to operate and provide work for thousands of Americans. There are 16,802 franchise car dealers in the United States. We directly employ over 1.13 million American workers. We also account for 1.27 million indirect jobs. The average salary at a dealership is almost $58,000. These are great American jobs that grew out of global trade. The car study that I mentioned earlier predicts that new car dealerships would see a loss of at least 117,000 jobs and a loss of as much as $66.5 billion in revenue if a 25-percent tariff is implemented. Clearly, I am not an expert on politics or global security, but I know cars, and I know the cars and trucks I sell, the services I provide, and the taxes I pay are not a national security threat. The men and women who show up to work every day, they are not threats to national security either. These proposed tariffs are the real threat and the real danger to our country and our economy. Thank you. The Chairman. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Gates appears in the appendix.] The Chairman. Mr. Nassar? STATEMENT OF JOSH NASSAR, LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR, UNITED AUTO WORKERS, DETROIT, MI Mr. Nassar. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today on behalf of our president, UAW president Gary Jones, and our 1 million members and retirees. The vast majority of our members rely directly on the success of the U.S. auto industry, not just our active members, but our retirees as well. So this is a topic of great importance to us. And we really welcome this discussion and thank the committee for having it. From our point of view--I just want to back up for a second and talk about, well, what is the problem we are trying to fix? In our view, the problem is that we have lost many manufacturing jobs, millions over recent years, and that wages and working conditions for autoworkers have dropped considerably; in fact, for manufacturing workers across the board. You see a lot of manufacturers that do not even directly hire workers anymore. They use temp agencies to hire their workforce. We see companies that spend millions of dollars to try to intimidate workers into not joining unions. There are problems that have to be fixed as part of the solution here. We also think we have to look at these policies in a holistic way. We need to have tax policies, for example, that complement trade policies, and we have concerns with provisions in the tax code that actually give greater incentives and benefits to companies that create jobs overseas rather than in the United States. So there are a lot of problems that have to get fixed, including also investing in the workforce. We are falling behind in that as well. Now, let us talk about trade. So, our fundamental view is that our trade model needs to be changed. If you look at our free trade agreements, we have never had a labor chapter that has effectively improved the standard for workers in other countries. In NAFTA, there is no enforceable labor chapter, but workers in all three countries, auto workers, have seen their wages drop since NAFTA. And what we have seen happen in the case of Mexico is, auto manufacturers and suppliers, dozens and dozens, close shop in the United States then build the exact same product they used to build in the United States and ship it back to the U.S., with the vast majority of auto products from Mexico going to the United States. This is not a good arrangement for workers in Mexico or the U.S., because in Mexico, they do not have the right to collectively bargain most of the time. They have company unions, and workers rarely even get to see the contracts that they are obliged to follow. Trade is not a black-and-white issue for us. Of course, we are for trade. Our members build products that are exported around the world, and it is very important that we have functioning, good trade markets. And that is why we think that going back to an actual trade model and trade agreements is an important thing to do. So, we think that is an important part of this. Now, when it comes to tariffs, we think that at times tariffs can be an appropriate tool to address a problem, but they do not constitute a comprehensive strategy in and of themselves. Looking at the 232--and I want to remind everyone that on the auto 232, we are just having a study at this point. Nothing has actually been implemented. Nothing has happened. We think the idea of having a study and examination about the loss of a lot of domestic capacity makes sense, and not just now but for the future. For example, we are losing the battle to build electric cars, which are going to be the vehicles of the future. We do not have enough capacity for lithium ion batteries or semi-conductors--and this could provide a situation where in the future, you see our share of the market really drop greatly. So, we do think the examination is worthwhile, but that does not mean that we are naturally going to endorse whatever the administration decides to do, because we think a targeted approach is needed to address direct problems. Having something that would kind of apply across the board without any real strategic sense does not make sense and would not be a good idea, so we are keeping an open mind on the auto 232s. I want to emphasize that when we are looking at our competitiveness in the auto industry, we are falling behind. We do not have a comprehensive strategy. The reality is, countries like Germany are spending a lot more resources and energy in trying to ensure they make the vehicles of the future. And we are not doing that. So, there are a lot of problems we need to fix. We think that trade tariffs can be part of the solution, but there is an awful lot to be done. And again, we really thank the committee for the opportunity to testify and share the views of the United Auto Workers, and I look forward to answering your questions. Thank you very much. The Chairman. Well, thank you, sir. [The prepared statement of Mr. Nassar appears in the appendix.] The Chairman. Mr. Britt, we will finish with you. STATEMENT OF H. DAVID BRITT, CHAIRMAN, SPARTANBURG COUNTY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE, SPARTANBURG, SC Mr. Britt. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Wyden, the rest of the committee. It is my honor to present to you today. In Spartanburg, SC, we build things. For over 100 years, our mills were the heart of American textile manufacturing. In the 1990s, our once-bustling mills begin to shutter and close. More than 25,000 workers found themselves unemployed, and our county was changed forever. If you visit Spartanburg County today--and I encourage you to do so--you will see a community that is the economic envy of many States, and indeed, many other countries. The transformation began in 1992 when BMW decided to build its U.S. manufacturing facility in Spartanburg, SC. In the last 26 years, BMW has invested over $9.3 billion in Plant Spartanburg and has produced over 4 million vehicles, and over 70 percent of those are shipped all over the world. BMW employs over 10,000 associates at Plant Spartanburg, and they produce an astonishing 1,450 vehicles every day. This has helped South Carolina become the Nation's leader in the export sales of completed passenger vehicles, accounting for 16 percent of the total U.S. market. In fact, South Carolina's automotive footprint is so robust that automotive suppliers are in 37 of our 46 counties, employing over 66,000 South Carolinians in our 400 plants. A 2017 study concluded that for every 10 jobs BMW directly creates at its Plant Spartanburg, 90 more are created as a direct result elsewhere in the U.S. Just last year, the automaker announced plans to invest an additional $600 million in Plant Spartanburg and create 1,000 more jobs. That decision is a testament to the quality of the company and their associates. Through our success with BMW, Spartanburg County learned we could complete and win on an international stage. Our culture of craftsmanship, which once saw workers spinning and weaving, translated to the economy of innovation. Today, more than 200 foreign-owned companies from 25 countries operate in Spartanburg County, including Michelin, Alcoa Fujikura, Toray, and Kobelco. And less than 30 percent of those companies are automotive- related. Companies such as Volvo, Mercedes, and Boeing now call South Carolina home, employing thousands and building products used around the world. In 2017, South Carolina won 157 economic development projects, representing $5.24 billion in capital investments and creating nearly 18,500 jobs. And more than half of that investment came from foreign countries. Time and time again, I hear a common refrain from these companies: South Carolina is a handshake state--a place where one's word still means something, and where fairness and partnerships are valued. In a global economy, it is important to be fair. That is why I initially supported President Trump's efforts for equitable trade agreements with countries. However, such arrangements should not create less incentive for American companies to look for innovative ways to increase their productivity and make products more efficiently. As evidence, look no further than U.S. steel manufacturing. Since March of this year, the price of U.S. steel has increased 23 percent on the heels of President Trump's tariffs. Instead of innovating or even raising prices slightly, U.S. steel manufacturers have increased their prices to just shy of the imported steel price. This marked price increase will cascade to our consumers, whether they realize it or not. Large construction projects built with precast concrete and steel beams may suddenly seem too costly and be shelved. Infrastructure improvement projects, the roads and bridges crucial to so many, may be delayed or canceled. This is a perfect example of why government should not use tariffs to pick winners and losers. We have over 100 years of history proving this does not work, from the sugar tariffs of the 1880s to the chicken tariffs of 1963, where in January of 1964, the United States placed a 25-percent tariff on all imported trucks, and it is still in place today, 54 years later. Every truck owner in the United States is paying substantially more for their truck because of this tariff, including me. The prices on everything from toothbrushes to groceries and cars will rise in 2019, if not sooner. These economic policy decisions do not exist in a vacuum. The impact will not only be felt in boardrooms and capitals but will be passed on to consumers across this country and the world. I keep hearing, ``Be patient. The President has a plan.'' Well, our trading partners and our citizens are running out of patience. They are asking themselves questions, because their lives and their futures are at stake. Our neighbors are asking themselves, ``Can we afford to buy a new home or a car with a trade war looming?'' Companies are asking, ``Can we risk this new investment in a new or existing facility in Spartanburg, or do we put it elsewhere in the world?'' In Spartanburg and South Carolina, we experienced firsthand the failures of a protectionist mentality. We must not repeat the mistakes of the past. As a community that was given the option to change or die, we have grown and thrived under a new economy, one built with a strong emphasis on education, collaboration, and innovation. In the years since the textile industry collapsed, companies have invested more than $17 billion in Spartanburg County alone, creating over 55,000 new jobs. We are poised for even brighter days to come, provided these tariffs do not put their foot on the throat of growth. A reporter recently asked me what I might say to President Trump if given the opportunity. I would say, ``Mr. President, come to Spartanburg and let me show you firsthand how we have opened our minds, our hearts, and our ingenuity to the world for the benefit of everyone.'' Politics is the art of getting things done through people, and in my 32 years of elective office, it has never rung truer than today. In Spartanburg, we have learned to accomplish our objectives through trust and partnerships, not a hammer, because in Spartanburg County, we build things, including relationships. Again, Mr. Chairman, Senator Wyden, and the rest of the committee members, I thank you for giving me the opportunity and the responsibility to present my testimony before this committee. I will look forward to your questions. The Chairman. Well, thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Britt appears in the appendix.] The Chairman. We appreciate all of you testifying here today. Let me start with Mr. Schostek. You have been in this business long enough to experience firsthand the benefits of a business environment that supports manufacturing. You said in your testimony that American policies welcomed Honda's investment and made it possible to begin U.S. production in 1979. As your company is now approaching 40 years in the United States, what is at stake with the prospect of tariffs on U.S. imports of autos and auto parts? Mr. Schostek. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You are absolutely correct. We came to the United States because we wanted to build product where we were going to sell product. And we found a welcoming environment and grew our footprint step by step, including building engines, transmissions, and full-line R&D right here in the United States. The problem with the tariffs is, tariffs are taxes. And tariffs are going to increase the cost of manufacturing, which is then going to increase prices to consumers. Demand will fall, and this, as I and the other witnesses have said this morning, will ripple through the entire economy. Tariffs disrupt and distort the market and are going to divert resources that we need to invest in new technologies going forward and will undermine the stability of that welcoming environment that we first found. So we see it, sir, as quite a threat. There are 14 auto companies producing cars in the U.S. Together, we all have healthy competition. The auto industry is not in need of protective tariffs, and they could destabilize the industry, as you have heard this morning. The Chairman. Thank you. Mr. Gates, you witness daily the joy and often the stress of the companies purchasing a vehicle. A car is one of the largest investments that a consumer will make. And as you said, one of the most important considerations for your customers is price. What impact would auto tariffs have on your consumers? You can talk about consumers across the Nation. Mr. Gates. Well, I am afraid that I think I cited some research that perhaps 2 million cars--we would sell 2 million cars less. I think it is greater than that. I know just from my own experience, cars are very price-sensitive. It is all about payment. If cars rose an average of $4,000 to $6,000, that adds--$4,000 adds $80 a month to a payment. Everybody who buys a car cares about the payment. So to me--and again this probably goes against some of the research--but to me I think it is devastating. I do not think I can survive long-term if this occurs. The Chairman. Well, thank you. I am in agreement with you guys, I will tell you. Mr. Haughey, let me go to you. You and your fellow witnesses have reminded us today that the automotive supply chain is both dynamic and fragile. One small change can set off a domino effect, ultimately hurting consumers and the economy. As you noted in your testimony, the supplier industry has already felt the effects of steel and aluminum tariffs. Now, these tariffs are costing your company alone $10 million a year. What would the impact of additional tariffs be on your business as well as the entire supply chain? Mr. Haughey. Senator, it has had a big impact. It is obviously--we have started delaying our growth. And that is a big problem for us. We do not import a lot ourselves. We manufacture everything in the country where we use it, but the big effect is going to be just--the overall volumes of the industry go down. We are selling parts for cars that may be supported by imported components. We have had one layoff in the history of the company back in 2009. If volumes go down, that is where we become very susceptible to our team members. The Chairman. Mr. Britt, several witnesses described today the auto industry as highly integrated. Automakers create a great deal of opportunity in the communities in which they operate. How dependent is your community on the health of the automotive industry? Mr. Britt. Mr. Chairman, I mentioned the 25 years of growth that we have had since BMW first announced in 1992. It is still fresh on every citizen's mind in Spartanburg--and I think in South Carolina--when the textile industry collapsed, all of those jobs that were lost. I think it is very important to realize in South Carolina, we are still tied in very carefully to what is going on on the automotive side, as the dealers have already spoken to that. But with BMW being such an impact on Spartanburg and South Carolina, it is not just the employees at BMW, the 10,000 employees there--as Mr. Gates mentioned, very few parts are made by BMW that go into their vehicle, or a Honda, or a Toyota, whatever. In fact, BMW only makes the engine for the most part, so all of those other components are made by the supplier network. And a lot of them are in South Carolina, but still a lot of those products come in from the international companies. If BMW cannot sell the number of vehicles that they have done in the previous year--and every BMW is sold before it is made. Those 1,450 vehicles being made today are already sold. So if they cut back--for instance, we do not need 450,000 this year; we need 350,000. So they cut 100,000 cars out. That means a 20-percent to 25-percent reduction in their potential workforce, as well as all the 66,000 across South Carolina. Take for instance, Magna Seating; they produce seats for BMW. When they came to Spartanburg--they have had two expansions since their first announcement 3 years ago. They make four seats for every BMW that is made, because they make the X cars in Spartanburg, the SUVs. So if they do not need 100,000 vehicles next year at BMW, that means there are 400,000 seats at Magna, then all of the other producers--ZF Lemforder, Draxlmaier, all the others that support the BMW production-- they cut back. But it is not just even the auto suppliers. It is the golf cart sales group in Spartanburg on Highway 221-- they stopped me recently and wanted to thank our team, our council and our economic development team, for this growth that we have experienced. That is $17 billion. They have doubled the size of their shop, their workforce, and have moved into a new facility, all because of this growth. If that growth goes backwards, they have to cut back. They have to lay off. Then they have to face paying their bills for this new building. This ripples all across Spartanburg and South Carolina. And it is very, very serious and very dangerous. The Chairman. Well, thank you. Senator Wyden? Senator Wyden. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. This has been a very good panel, and we appreciate all of you being here. Let me start with you if I could, Mr. Nassar. The steel tariffs seem to be increasing company profits, but not increasing wages for the workers. And I would be interested in having you start by giving us a sense of what mix of policies you would favor that would be good for workers and companies. Mr. Nassar. Thank you for that question. I think, first of all, if you just look at what would be good for workers and for companies, it is for workers to have a voice on the job. And quite frankly, what we have seen in a large percentage of auto parts, but also in auto manufacturing is, fewer and fewer workers do have a voice on the job. And workers who seek to have a voice collectively bargaining are often intimidated, and in fact, the common threat is, if you push too hard, we are going to Mexico. So I think, (1) is that we really need to have a reexamining of our tax laws and make sure we are not giving incentives to offshore jobs, and (2) we have to reexamine---- Senator Wyden. That is especially important because, when you look at this tax bill, it is still more profitable to do business overseas than to do it in the United States. So you can be assured that there are a lot of us here who are very interested in that. Mr. Nassar. Yes, it contradicts what we are trying to accomplish in trade policy, for sure. And then the other thing is, we need to reexamine our trade agreements fundamentally. And I want to just make the point that what we have seen is, sometimes an argument is made that, hey, we have lost capacity. We cannot build certain parts here anymore. Well, those were deliberate decisions that were made by companies to move overseas. And what we have seen is that the truth is--take NAFTA. Auto production has increased rapidly there. And nearly every car manufacturer has plans to expand in Mexico. What we are also seeing is, the supplier networks that are being talked about here, they are moving to Mexico as well. Why that is such a concern is because, obviously, that means lost jobs here, lower wages here as well. Also, we have to talk about worker training. We have to talk about apprenticeships. If you look at it, we are not really investing and making that a priority like we need to. And frankly, we need to make sure that we have a stronger middle class, and having a stronger middle class means having a strong safety net, having strong collective bargaining rights, and really a pathway to the future. We at UAW are proud of that fact that we helped establish manufacturing jobs as middle-class jobs. That is less and less the case today, and it is devastating communities around the country. So really a holistic approach---- Senator Wyden. I appreciate the answer. We will keep the record open so you can give more to us in writing. But the prism I am talking about is your ideas, and for all of you, so that workers win, companies win, we widen the winner circle for more middle-class, good-paying jobs in America. So I thank you for that. Mr. Schostek, let me talk to you about this whole question of exclusions that has become a part of this trade bill. And as you know--we talked about it in the office--I think the way this was set up was arbitrary from the get-go. Secretary Ross came here to talk about the so-called ``product exclusion process.'' I want you all to know I think this comes directly from La La Land. It is almost incomprehensible to figure out how it actually works. We keep hearing from constituents, all of us, that they cannot figure out what is going to happen. Are they going to be approved? Are they not going to be approved? Mr. Schostek, tell us if you would--and also we have not been able to get answers from Secretary Ross. Members of this committee, in effect, gave him scores of questions with respect to exclusions. Three months later, we have not gotten any answers from him. So my question to you, Mr. Schostek, is, what has been your experience with the suppliers, and what have the ramifications been for your business, because I gather you are having some hassles and they cannot get answers? But walk us through what it really means for you. Mr. Schostek. Sure. Thank you, Senator Wyden. That is a very important question, and I am glad you brought it up this morning. The auto industry supply base, with respect to the steel and aluminum tariffs, is very interdependent. There are many suppliers that have requested exclusions from the Department. There are three, in particular, that we have been tracking along with. There are more than that in our supply chain. But there were three, and in fact, I just checked on them yesterday after we had a chance to speak in your office. All three of them applied soon after the window opened, so to speak, for exclusion requests. I think they applied in maybe the June timing. None of the three has an answer yet. So they are still waiting to understand if their exclusion request will be granted. Senator Wyden. What does that mean for you? Mr. Schostek. It means uncertainty, which is what the whole theme of this activity is. We are uncertain if they are going to be able to get an exclusion. Then of course if they do, the tariff would not apply and things would be differently priced in the commerce we have with them. Now we have heard--to be clear, there has been some improvement very recently in terms of reducing the backlog. But again, as we sit here this morning, those three suppliers that we have been tracking pretty closely are waiting for an answer. Senator Wyden. I appreciate it. My time is up. And we keep hearing that there have been improvements in the backlog. It always reminds me of the marquee at the old movie house where it says, ``coming soon.'' And then it never gets there because, when I talk to companies, my experience is what you have said. They have two or three suppliers, and they have been waiting, and they do not have any sense of when they are finally going to get an answer, and then they do not have the certainty and predictability to go out and invest in jobs. So I thank all of you, and I know my colleagues are waiting. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. Thank you. Senator Stabenow? Senator Stabenow. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, very much for holding this hearing. When we talk about trade in the auto industry, put Michigan right at the top of the list. So this is, obviously, a very important topic for our businesses and our workers and communities in Michigan. I have to say it, Mr. Gates: I grew up on a car lot. My dad and grandfather had the Oldsmobile dealership when I was growing up, Greer Auto Sales. My first job was washing the cars on the car lot. So I appreciate all of your efforts. I am glad that we were able to actually preserve an American automobile industry with the rescue we did a number of years ago that impacted not only the OEMs and the suppliers, but I think 120,000-plus auto dealers in every community--so very, very important. First, Mr. Nassar, I wanted to talk to you a little bit. My mantra, always--in Michigan, we are the fifth largest exporting State, both manufacturing and agriculture. We need to make things and grow things. My mantra is that we want to export our products, not our jobs. So that requires a level playing field. And you have spoken about what that means. It is one thing--we go back and forth across the Ambassador Bridge or other bridges to Canada every day; the supply chain is very comparable. The problem is in Mexico. If they are paying $2 an hour, we suddenly see a race to the bottom, which means that we are are losing middle-class jobs. If you could, talk about how the administration should be pushing for better labor standards in Mexico. What does that mean to you? And what do we stand to lose if we do not, in fact, have meaningful labor standards and opportunities for people in Mexico to negotiate in the workplace, like we do in the United States and in Canada? Mr. Nassar. Thank you for that question. I think, first of all, I want to make sure I am making the point that we care about workers everywhere, but our members really care about what is going on in Mexico because the wages are so low there that it creates a real incentive to bring more and more work down there. So we want to bring the wages up there. It is not just for the workers in Mexico. It is for the workers in the United States. We view it as, when companies set up in Mexico, create these company unions that often, frankly, rely on repressive State policies to keep workers down, that that is an unfair trade advantage in our view. And the company that chooses to go that way should not just be able to have no consequences. What we are looking for in NAFTA renegotiations is fundamentally ending these protection contracts and changing Mexico's law so people have a real chance to join unions and to have a voice, if they want to--or not to join the union. The other thing is, you have to have serious enforcement in order to make that stick, because what we have seen in other trade agreements is, it looks good on paper, but if you have this dispute settlement, really clunky, lengthy, inefficient process, that does not lead to justice. So we think that is another thing. As far as unfair practices, I just want to say that when you look at many countries around the world, they manipulate their currency to make their products cheaper. There are a lot of countries that highly subsidize their industries. The idea that we should not do anything about that, that we should take no corrective action, just means that we are going to, over time, lose more and more manufacturing. That will be the result if we stick with the status quo. So that is not an option. The truth is that many of our competitors continue to use unfair trade practices, and they make it really hard for us to export there. We have to deal with all of that to have a level playing field. Senator Stabenow. I agree that we need trade enforcement. That is something that I worked on for a number of years. I helped create the trade enforcement office that we have now. And the President had indicated that he would call China a currency manipulator on day one. I was very supportive of him doing that. I am sorry that that has not happened. Currency manipulation is a serious issue. But at the same time---- Let me turn--Mr. Haughey, thank you for being in Michigan with one of your plants. We know that we have a set of issues that need to be addressed to level the playing field, very important, because we want the jobs--I want the jobs in America. I think we all want the jobs here in America, and we want American businesses to thrive. And we also know most of the jobs come in the supply chain, not in the assembly. It is in the supply chain. So it does matter, though, that we have stability. It worries me, and I understand. But when you said you suspended growing your company because of the instability--deep concern about that. We need to have you doing well and to have stability. And what is happening--unfortunately, we are sort of throwing everything at the wall, which is what they are doing: section 232, section 301, NAFTA, I mean everything, so that there is total instability right now. So I would just ask you---- The Chairman. You are way over---- Senator Stabenow. If I could just ask one thing, if I might, one thing---- The Chairman. You are way over time, but go ahead. Senator Stabenow. Thirty-six, thirty-seven seconds--so everybody went over 1 minute so far, so if I might. The Chairman. It is okay. Senator Stabenow. Could you walk through what it takes to get new components into the supply chain? And I know you talked about CAFE standards. Nobody in the auto industry I know of is asking for changes there. You are making the new parts. You have retooled already to make the new parts. So when we look at all of this, what kind of certification and testing is required? How long does it take? When we walk through new components and what it takes to get in the supply chain and how you are impacted by these actions, I wonder if you might just speak a moment to that. Mr. Haughey. Thank you, Senator. We would work with our Tier 1 customers to develop new products. Tools that we manufacture for metal forming can take over 6 months, sometimes up to a year, depending on the complexity and the number of different tools. The parts would then go to the Tier 1s and eventually to the OEMs. There is so much testing to be done now, crash testing, all kinds of different validations. So it is a very long chain. It is interdependent on everyone. Now we have been kind of working on electric vehicles, connected vehicles, shared vehicles, lightweight--there has been a lot of progress made in the industry, but now everyone is kind of sitting back going, ``Boy, we are not sure how all the trade is going to work out. Are we going to be disadvantaged in the U.S. by tariffs?'' There is big concern in our industry that if we block off access to the market, a lot of those technologies will be developed over in China or Europe. And we do not want to see that. We obviously want to stay on the leading edge of technologies. Senator Stabenow. Well, we want you here too. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your patience. The Chairman. Well, I apologize for interrupting you. Senator Stabenow. That is all right. Mr. Britt. Mr. Chairman, can I jump in on Senator Stabenow's question? I would like to add a little bit if I can. The Chairman. Sure. Mr. Britt. She is absolutely right. Both American and international companies depend on predictability and certainty. And in this regulatory climate that we are in right now in 2018, I think it is the worst it has ever been in the country's history. Companies, again both American and international, depend-- it is all about risk avoidance when you are talking about putting money in to expand or to retool, putting new equipment in, in the state that we are in right now. And it goes back to what Senator Wyden was saying too. The complexity, the difficulty of reading all of this change--at our company, the Tindall Corporation in Spartanburg, our purchasing agent got a 125-page document sent to us by one of our suppliers and asked us to read it to decide what was applicable and not applicable. And we are trying to do business. So when they are asking us--Senator Wyden, you said you had a tough time getting it. You do not want to see it. It is too complex. Just again, we need this predictability and this certainty. One of our suppliers out of Ohio--I just got this email yesterday from our chief project manager, Ashley Fortenberry. It is an increase in our steel prices effective immediately because of the tariff that was just put into place last week, the 10-percent of 200 billion in China. We just got a 10- percent increase on top of the 23 percent that we got back in March. And we are warned right now that it is going to go up 15 percent more in January. And that is a steel producer supplying steel to a company that uses steel primarily in our product. Let me say this, just to make sure everyone understands this. For every $1 that the steelmakers contribute to the GDP, the steel users--just like all of the automotive manufacturing companies, just like Tindall and all of those companies in Spartanburg--we add $29 to the GDP compared to that $1. For every 1 job that the U.S. steel manufacturers make and create, we create 46, the steel users. And this is in every State in this United States. And it is very, very important. And it is going to cost the consumers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. I am concerned about it too. I am on your side, between you and me. Senator Grassley? Senator Grassley. In the four or five times I have been to the White House to talk to the President about his trade policies and the tariffs, et cetera--most of the time, obviously, from my State I talk about agriculture, but also within my State, we have thousands of jobs that are connected with parts for cars, even though we do not make cars in my State. So this concerned me very much. Before I ask a couple of questions, I hope we all would agree, even though we are raising concerns about what is going on right now, that if the President accomplishes his goals of getting intellectual property rights protected and companies not having to give away trade secrets, and getting other countries to lower tariffs, that if he can accomplish that, obviously we are all going to be better off, whether it is automobiles, or our farmers, or our services, or anything else. So I hope we can agree on that, if he can accomplish it. I know that is a big ``if.'' He has made some progress, maybe with Mexico, as an example. So I am going to go to Mr. Schostek and Mr. Gates. And, Mr. Gates, you spoke to this question, but I want to bring it down to the family level. Could you estimate--now this stems from what I think you said, $6,000 to $7,000, if the proposed tariff goes in, with an increase in the cost of a car. Could you, Mr. Gates--and you do not need to repeat this, Mr. Schostek, if you agree with what he said. Could you estimate what that means for a person's monthly payments with current interest rates, and how much extra per month does a middle-class consumer have to come up with to finance a new car with these costs? Mr. Gates Well, $6,000, roughly, is $120 a month. And believe me, people leave dealerships because of a $5 difference. One hundred twenty dollars is a huge number. Senator Grassley. Do you have anything to add to that? Mr. Schostek. Senator, I would not disagree with Mr. Gates at all, except to add on the fact that as new car prices increase and consumers are priced out of that segment of the market, they are going to be looking for used cars. And used car prices are also going to increase because of demand, and then service parts prices. So there is a ripple throughout the entire chain of distribution here that is going to hurt American consumers. Senator Grassley. Okay. And for you, Mr. Schostek, this question: you mentioned the lead time for designing and launching cars--I think roughly 5 to 6 years. Clearly you have to make decisions years out before production starts. I doubt that you all have made major plans yet to move production as a result of the tariffs. However, at some point you might. Could you estimate how long the current tariffs and general trade uncertainty could last before your company would start seriously considering making significant production changes to lower costs? Mr. Schostek. Senator, we came to the U.S. to build products where we sell them. And we found here a welcoming environment, and we have grown in America. We do full-line manufacturing, full-line R&D here in the United States. We plan to stay, but the current environment is unsettling. It is certainly unsettling for us. And that is why I came here today. I wanted to talk to the committee about this. You mentioned being from an agriculture State, and certainly retaliation. We can see it there. We can see it in other aspects. The problem with the tariffs is, they are a kind of unintended consequence. So we have an action, which is a tariff. Then we have a reaction, which is retaliation. Workers lose on both ends of that, and consumers lose on both ends of that. We are experiencing retaliation in our business right now. For example, in Swepsonville, NC we are making lawnmowers. Those lawnmowers are sold in the United States. We also export them to Canada. Canada has put a 10-percent tariff on the lawnmowers we are making in Swepsonville, NC, disadvantaging our workers there in North Carolina. Further, we are sending transmissions from Tallapoosa, GA to China. So we have a new product, the Acura RDX. We make that product for the U.S. market in Ohio in East Liberty, OH. And we provide the transmission from Georgia to Ohio. But in addition, for the China market--and China is a big market--we make the RDX in China as well. We are sending transmissions from Tallapoosa, GA to China. And those are now subject to the retaliatory tariffs, again, affecting the work of Americans-- Americans in Georgia. And there are other examples as well, just within our company. And then we can talk about the supply chain as well. This is happening all over the place, Senator. Senator Grassley. Thanks to both of you. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator. Senator Brown? Senator Brown. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Nassar, let me start with you. Earlier this year, GM announced it was laying off the second shift at the Lordstown Plant in northeast Ohio where they make the Chevy Cruze. Twelve hundred workers at the plant got pink slips. That was in addition to the more than 1,000 workers on the third shift that had lost their jobs. Senator Portman and I have done everything we could, and still Mary Barra, GM's CEO, will not commit to keeping the plant open, will not commit to retooling it to make a better- selling, probably, SUV. To make bad matters worse, on the day that the second shift left, GM announced, literally the same day, they were going to build the Chevy Blazer in Mexico. There is something wrong with this picture. A company decides to lay off more than 2,000 experienced auto workers at a historic auto plant in the United States, then announces they are going to build cars for the American market in Mexico. Do you agree GM's decision is proof that our policies do not do enough to encourage U.S.-based production? Mr. Nassar. It is absolutely proof. And it is proof that we have seen time and time again. Unfortunately, we have a situation where there are no negative economic consequences for companies taking big tax breaks, breaking promises, and creating jobs overseas. So, it absolutely is a failure of policy that encourages this offshoring. Senator Brown. Let me talk about a potential solution. In response to that decision, I introduced the American Cars, American Jobs Act. The bill has two parts. First, customers who buy cars that are made in the U.S.--roughly 50 percent domestic content--and assembled here get $3,500 off at the dealership. The discount would apply to nearly 100 cars, trucks, and SUVs, including all passenger vehicles assembled in Ohio. Second, companies that cut the number of American jobs they had on the day the much-vaunted GOP tax bill passed, and add those jobs overseas, lose a tax break they get on some of their overseas profits. Essentially, they lose their 50-percent-off tax coupon that this committee and this Senate gave them a year ago. Would this bill help keep auto jobs in the U.S.? Mr. Nassar. Absolutely it would help keep auto jobs in the U.S., because it incentivizes more purchasing in the U.S. markets, which is really important. And also because it, frankly, addresses an abuse we see, where companies are saying they cannot invest in the United States, but then they are investing overseas, and they are taking no consequences for it. Our laws absolutely should react to that abuse, and your legislation would surely help. Senator Brown. Thank you, Mr. Nassar. Mr. Schostek, welcome to the committee. Welcome all five of you to the committee. Thank you for the work that Honda has done as a leading auto producer in Ohio for decades. I remember the late 70s when Honda broke ground in Marysville and built motorcycles. Obviously, you have come a long way from motorcycles, to cars, to lawnmowers--a new product that most people in this room probably did not know was also a Honda product. Your company made its first Accord in Marysville, northwest of Columbus, 36 years ago. In the last 25 years, you have assembled 11 million Accords at that plant. You now have 15,000 employees. They work in Ohio alone. They work at Marysville. They work at the world-renowned research facility and logistics center, engine plant, transmission plant, the East Liberty assembly plant, which you mentioned. My understanding from my visit to Honda and my discussions with you and others, and Ed Cohen and others, is you have never once laid off a shift of workers. If more auto companies invested in the U.S. like Honda has invested in Ohio, this conversation would have been very different today. So give us a couple of minutes on the policies you think we should consider in this body to encourage other companies to invest in the U.S. as extensively as Honda has. Mr. Schostek. Thank you, Senator Brown. Good to see you again, and thank you for the support. I have talked about the welcoming environment we have found in Ohio. You are a key part of that. Your support on workforce development and many other topics over the years has been invaluable for us. So we appreciate it. Your understanding about not laying off a shift is correct. So I can confirm that for you. And we found a very welcoming place in Ohio and elsewhere in this country. There are 14 companies producing cars in the United States right now. That is a lot of companies. So we have a healthy competition that exists among the auto industry. This industry is not in need of protective tariffs, and that is what brought me here today. That is why we are concerned. So we are concerned that the tariffs will increase the cost of manufacturing, and, as we have discussed, the price to consumers, both for new vehicles as well as for used vehicles. But we are going to keep strong. Our operations in Ohio-- which by the way, as you mentioned, include our largest engine plant in the world in Anna, OH. And we have a very, very strong R&D operation in Ohio. We have developed 30 different automobile and light truck models in the U.S. exclusively by Americans working in Raymond, OH, as well as their colleagues in the Los Angeles, CA area. So we are a full-line, full-value chain manufacturer here in America. The Chairman. Thank you. Senator Warner? Senator Warner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate you holding this hearing. I am not even sure where to begin when it comes to talking about this administration's approach on trade. When you have a President of the United States who starts by stating that trade wars are good--and we have absolutely no factual basis on that--I think you end up in the circumstances where we are right now. Let me tell you, I would be the first to agree that China does not play by the fair international rules. We have seen that in terms--I have seen it, particularly in my old industry in technology, where the price of admission for an American company into the Chinese market is giving up their intellectual property. We have seen it with Chinese efforts in intellectual property theft. We have seen it on Chinese use of their students who attend our universities, again to steal intellectual property. And we have seen it where the Chinese firms do not operate on market-based principles. They have enormous direct state subsidies. I would argue that the way to approach that would have been to build an international coalition. I think there was a growing recognition about the real threat that China poses over the last couple of years, and there was an opportunity to build a coalition, not only with our North American allies, but our European allies, many Asian nations that have been direct targets of this Chinese aggressive action. But instead, we have seen this administration use a part of our law, the section 232, under national security provisions, to basically call out allies like Canada. And the Canadians have a right to be upset with our administration, this administration's portrayal of Canada. They are our friend, not a national security threat--as are our European allies and others. And clearly in the realm of, whether you are talking about Toyota, whether you are talking about the supply chain that has been integrated across North America, these policies are going to hurt American consumers. They are going to hurt American jobs. In a State like mine, in Virginia, where we actually have enormous net surpluses with many of our trading partners, this is going to hit us at the bottom line--so action against China makes sense. This administration's approach, I do not believe meets that criteria. So I want to make sure I do get in a couple of questions rather than just my views here. Mr. Gates, one of the things that I think you mentioned in your testimony I would like you to expand on a little bit, and that is the fact that if this trade war in autos is allowed to continue, not only will American consumers feel that price increase on the front end when they go out and purchase a new car, but in many ways the real hit may come to the pocketbook when they go back and service their cars, because many of the auto parts will also be penalized. Could you expand on that a little? Mr. Gates. Of course; thank you for the question. I will start by saying in Kentucky, the legislature recently passed a law which now charges a 6-percent tax on labor. So not 25 percent, just 6 percent. And that has caused many people to put off maintaining their vehicles. So a 25- percent tax on parts would clearly, I think, be devastating. It is easy to put off maintenance. It is a little frightening though, because part of that is certainly safety- related. And I, sort of, hate to be driving around with people who have unsafe cars on the road. Senator Warner. Amen to that. I think people have not felt the full burden of the Trump trade war yet. I do not think Americans are going to come to the consensus this is good. I do think China is a threat, but you could have rallied the international coalition. Mr. Schostek, can you speak to one of the areas I know your company is investing in? Even though there are going to be some bumps, I think the notion of autonomous vehicles holds a great deal of possibility, and we are talking about direct price penalties. But can you speak to the question about R&D and R&D that your company might otherwise have chosen to do here in America? You have an international market, so how do you make the decisions around tariffs that will affect your decisions about where to do your R&D on autonomous vehicles and otherwise? Mr. Schostek. Great. Absolutely, Senator. Thank you for the question. The concern about tariffs is, they are diverting resources. Right now the auto industry is at quite an inflection point in terms of many items: electrification, connected and autonomous vehicles. These require major investments by us, the OEMs, by the supply community, in order to make these changes that are necessary for the future. The fact that we have tariffs and retaliation going on is doing nothing but diverting resources from very important R&D and technology activity that we need to perform in order to stay viable into the future. So it is certainly a key issue for us. Senator Warner. Mr. Chairman, I know you have been a big advocate, as the ranking member has been, about technology development in this country. I hope, again, we can send this message that this is not only hurting Americans in their pocketbook, but it is curtailing the ability for auto companies to do the needed R&D investment in this Nation. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator. I agree 100-percent with you. Senator Cantwell? Senator Cantwell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank the witnesses. I have stayed for most of this hearing because I think it is such an important topic. I think the United States of America figuring out how it keeps U.S. manufacturing jobs and jobs related to manufacturing is a very key point to our economy. Why? Because manufacturing jobs help people move from working-class to middle-class. So I am not saying other sectors cannot do that, but certainly the manufacturing sector can. I think we are probably one of the few States that--we definitely import a lot of cars through the State of Washington. We export some as well, but I am struck by the commonality of the views at the table as opposed to the divergence of your ideas. And I just want to make sure I am clear on this, because one of the things that I think is, if you want to have manufacturing in the United States of America, you make sure you are making all of those investments in the supply chain. Because if you own the supply chain and it can be lean manufacturing, that is the best bet to what Mr. Nassar was saying and to what everybody was saying. So is that right? To the greatest degree possible, keeping a robust and lean supply chain in the United States helps us to continue to produce jobs here? Is that correct? Mr. Schostek. Senator, as an OEM, absolutely. Absolutely correct. Senator Cantwell. Anybody else? Mr. Haughey. From our standpoint, if you go back to 2009, the different suppliers, when they start to fall, it affects everyone. There is such an interdependency. A company like Honda deals with all kinds of different suppliers. All you need is just one weak link and you get into trouble. Senator Cantwell. Mr. Nassar? Mr. Nassar. Yes, I would say definitely maintaining supply chains in the United States is absolutely critical. Most of the work done on a car is in the supply chain. But that is also why it is important that we look at where automakers are investing in new plants. And I think there is the distinction between where the workers and companies stand when it comes to our bottom lines. For corporations, it is shareholder value at the end of the day. If they could invest overseas and make a lot of money doing it, that helps their shareholders. That does not help American workers. Our main thing is having the jobs in the United States and having good-paying jobs. So---- Senator Cantwell. Do you believe in the supply chain? This is my point. Mr. Nassar. Absolutely. Senator Cantwell. You are in agreement with these gentlemen. Mr. Britt, I am assuming you agree with the supply chain? Mr. Britt. Absolutely, Senator. And again, a great example is Spartanburg, SC and the State of South Carolina. We have over 400 companies that are in the supply chain for all of these automotive manufacturers. It is not just BMW. It is Honda, Toyota, Kia--you name it. Those suppliers supply for everybody in the United States. The key thing is, when they move offshore, they do not come back. Senator Cantwell. Yes. So in keeping the supply chain--my guess is you all agree on this too--having a well-trained and highly skilled workforce in the United States is key to keeping that supply chain. Is that right? Mr. Britt. Can I answer that question, Senator? Senator Cantwell. Yes. Mr. Britt. I am going back to my testimony earlier where I talked about 100 years of textile manufacturing in Spartanburg and in South Carolina. We were used to a protectionist State. Our State was designed and our tax laws were designed to keep industry out, to protect the home team, the textile manufacturing in the upstate, the agricultural industry in the lower part of the State. I grew up on a small tobacco farm in Dillon County where the floods are now hitting. And I am thinking and praying about all those folks down in the Pee Dee. But that State's tax setup for over 50/60 years now was designed to keep those other companies out. The first international company to come to Spartanburg County was Michelin in 1978, outside of the textile manufacturing equipment suppliers. Since that date, we have changed our community. I mentioned earlier, our focus is on education. It was not supportive of education for those 100 years that we operated in a closed environment. It was not important for a family member to go get a college education or even a high school education, because they had a job in the textile plants, or in the tobacco fields, or in the cotton fields of the lower part of the State. Take a look at BMW. Again, I said they changed Spartanburg and South Carolina forever. Look at their investments that they do in the BMW scholar program. They have raised that bar on education now because, of those 10,000 associates who work in BMW, a small percentage actually works on the production floor. They are in engineering---- Senator Cantwell. I only have a few minutes left, so I---- Mr. Britt. Excuse me. Senator Cantwell. I am assuming, Mr. Nassar, you agree, and the other witnesses? Mr. Schostek. Senator, just very quickly if I might. We talked about R&D and new innovations, new technologies before. That is true in the product. That is also true on the plant floor. The plant floor in 2018 is far, far different than in the 1980s. And we as companies have responsibilities to keep our workers trained and up to speed on this new technology. Senator Cantwell. I guess my point here is, what you all have articulated in this broad fashion here is the same. If we want to keep these jobs in the United States of America, then we should invest in the supply chain. We should invest in skilling our workforce. We should invest in the R&D, and that is what will keep us competitive. And I think that the tariff idea--Mr. Britt, you said it best. You guys build relationships. Okay, and building relationships and figuring out how to get access to these markets, but still keeping our eye on what makes America competitive, is what we need to do. And right now, these tariffs are not making us very competitive, I can tell you that. And they are going to make it, as all the witnesses said, more expensive for consumers. So I just--look, we believe in this. You guys need to keep doing this, because you represent what the consensus is here about the direction for us to grow jobs here. Thank you. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator. Senator McCaskill? Senator McCaskill. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Four weeks ago I chaired a roundtable on trade with representatives of Missouri's manufacturers and agricultural communities. It was a stark several hours listening to the reality that these businesses are facing and these farmers are facing in light of the tariffs that have already been applied. We are a major auto hub in Missouri. We have over 10,000 members of UAW employed at General Motors, and at Ford and Toyota. We are the birthplace of the Ford F-150, which we are very proud of, along with the Chevy Colorado and the GMC Canyon. We have--I think 167,000 is the estimate of workers we have in Missouri associated with the manufacturing of automobiles. So it is a big deal to my State how we handle this. So far, these tariffs are impacting farmers in my State, workers in my State, and consumers in my State all negatively--all negatively. It is a real head-scratcher that this administration is doing this under 232, national security. It seems to me that this is a stretch on national security. You can kind of dress up aluminum and steel, that we need that production capability if we need to go internally to produce weaponry or other things. But the car thing seems to be a stretch for me. I think what I would like to ask you all is if you agree or want to make a comment on--the Center for Automotive Research estimates a 25-percent tariff on automobiles would add an average of $4,400 to the cost of a car. That seems very high. Have any of you taken a look at this, because, obviously, if it goes up that much, that ultimately impacts demand, which ultimately impacts jobs negatively for the workers that I am most concerned about in this scenario. Mr. Nassar. Well, just as far as the research goes, I think that some of the idea that every penny that gets raised in cost by the company has to be passed on to the consumers is a little bit overstated at times. We are talking about many companies that have a very, very healthy profitability and pay their executives quite handsomely. So the idea that absolutely every penny is going to get passed on is a reach also. I think the other thing is, when looking at these policies, we also have to keep in mind some of the--I am not saying how it will pan out--but the long-term impacts, because the idea is, you are potentially trying to change behavior, change investment patterns, so some of it does not play out right away. But I do think that we really need to have a more comprehensive trade policy for sure. Mr. Schostek. Senator, you mentioned there are various studies out there. There is a lot of data out there to be had, and we can certainly follow up with you on any of those items. But you also mentioned the basis for the 232 tariffs. I can tell you as a business person, I cannot begin to understand that. But what I would say is that we are very heavily invested, as we have described, in manufacturing, in R&D, especially in R&D here in the United States and through the entire value chain. So I think we, Honda, and this industry in general, are contributing significantly to the U.S. industrial base. And then again, as a business person, I can only speak to the impacts that these tariffs would have. And we can see impending harm to U.S. manufacturing, to workers, and as you mentioned, to consumers. Senator McCaskill. Let me--Mr. Nassar, I understand that there is support for the idea that we could bring these jobs back to the United States, many of which have chased lower labor costs, and I completely understand. I would point out to UAW and your thousands of members across the country, that you should look at your brothers in the steel industry and what is going on right now. We have 30,000 steel workers who have authorized a strike on the heels of very generous tariffs. Clearly the price of steel has gone up dramatically. That is also impacting automobile manufacturing. Clearly it has bumped up to just under the tariff amount. So for all of the people around this country who are manufacturing, this is added cost that is just getting passed on. But it is not--in the negotiations with the steel workers, they offered the minimal raise, but they cut the health care so much that they ended up going in the hole at this moment in time. It is just amazing to me that this was somehow pitched as great for the workers. That the workers were really going to enjoy this. And a few months later, you have 30,000 steel workers ready to go on strike. Mr. Nassar. And if I could respond, I think that that points out the fact that we need to look at these policies in an integrated way. And the fact is that our labor laws are very weak. Enforcement is very weak, and the workers have less power and less voice. So it creates these kinds of decisions where workers can and do get taken advantage of all the time. I think it speaks to a real power imbalance we have in this country. Senator McCaskill. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. Thank you. Senator Scott? Senator Scott. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to the panel for sharing your expertise here this morning and now this afternoon. So I really appreciate that. South Carolina has greatly benefited from the resurgence of manufacturing exports and foreign direct investment. More than 700 international companies employ more than 130,000 South Carolinians, with most of that in the manufacturing sector. It might be debatable whether or not South Carolina is the number one automotive State in the country. What is not debatable is the fact that we are at least in the top two or three in the Nation, and certainly always in the conversation. We have 66,000 employees working at 400 companies, as Mr. Britt just stated earlier, in the auto industry, along with vehicle manufacturers like BMW, Daimler, and now Volvo. There has been significant investment from automotive suppliers, both large-- Bosch, Continental, Mag-na--and small. This industry is essential to continued progress in my State. Good trade policy unlocks opportunities for American families and obviously, it has unlocked real opportunities for South Carolinians without question. With those thoughts in mind, I would like to ask a few questions. Mr. Britt, I will start with you. I know that you have spent 25 years on the county council in Spartanburg. Thank you for your public service. You have spent years as a part of the economic development apparatus in Spartanburg. You guys have brought in about $16 billion of investment, creating or at least attracting 45,000 jobs. I wonder, as we think about the 232 autos and parts investigation, what the impact of that is on business? When I talk to business leaders in the sector, what I find is real concern and hesitation. The question for you is, are you hearing similar things back at home, or am I just hearing from a few people? Mr. Britt. Senator, you are hearing exactly right. And I appreciate the kind comments. Actually, I have served on the council 28 years. Senator Scott. Excuse me. Mr. Britt. And the reason I point that out is, I was elected May 7, 1991, when we were in the depths of the biggest depressing time in the history of Spartanburg County and in the upstate because all of those 25,000 jobs had left the textile industry. So I was there to help recruit BMW. I was just one of the players. As you know, our great Governor, former House member---- Senator Scott. Carroll Campbell. Mr. Britt. Carroll Campbell. Senator Scott. Absolutely. Mr. Britt. He was the quarterback. Foster Chapman, Carter Smith, and David Britt were just players on that team, but we worked hard to help Governor Campbell bring that company to Spartanburg. You, yourself, you started as a council member in Charleston County. And you and I share a lot of our upbringing. Senator Scott. Absolutely. Mr. Britt. As I said, I grew up in Dillon County on a small tobacco farm. You grew up in Charleston--single mom, at the age of 7 supported three children. And now you are a United States Senator. But when you were a council member, you knew how it was. When you go to the grocery store, you go to the YMCA, you go to church, people talk to you. Senator Scott. Yes, sir. Mr. Britt. When you were in the State House, you actually got to go to Columbia a little bit. My friends who are actually in the House in Columbia say, ``I do not know how you deal with it on council. You see these people every day.'' And that is right. That is why I have done it for so long, because I feel like that is my calling. I listen to them in the grocery store. Dick Mahon is stopping me and my wife is calling me on the phone and saying, ``You have been there for an hour. All you needed to do was go get milk. What are you doing?'' These people are talking about this concern. So I think Mr. Schostek made a comment earlier, we are dealing with the most educated workforce and consumer group in the history of the United States. With smartphones and the associates who work in these companies, it is no longer that you work on the production floor, punch in, and go out 8 hours later. You are on teams. You are on management teams. You are on leadership teams. Just like at Tindall, our associates are the company. They know exactly what is going on. They know how much money we made last month. And there was a comment made earlier that companies make so much money, all of this profit. I would like to know who these companies are, because every company that I deal with--those 211 international companies in Spartanburg as well as the Americans--all operate on very fine margin. Senator Scott. Yes. Mr. Britt. And when you increase it, it hurts. But you are hearing it exactly right. Senator Scott. Excellent. Mr. Britt. Tremendous concern. Senator Scott. Let me, in my 30 seconds or so that I have left, ask you a question, Mr. Schostek, about the supply chain. You have been pretty clear. I listened to you this morning on the negative impacts on the supply chain, and frankly on American jobs connected to those supply chains. I think Mr. Britt said it earlier, and Senator Cantwell agreed, that when these supply chains leave, getting them back is very difficult. I think you said earlier, sir, that whether it is $4,000 added cost, whether that goes to the consumer, whether it comes out of the company, the fact is that it matters; a loss of profit does jeopardize jobs. No matter who pays the price, whether it is the consumer or the company, ultimately the workers will feel a negative impact. So my question to you is, it seems to me that all auto companies are connected and linked to global supply chains. And at the end of the day, is it not true that tariffs on auto and parts imports will raise the cost of vehicles, whether that is $4,000 or $6,000? And if we raise the prices of vehicles, we can imagine that consumers will buy fewer of them. And if the consumers buy fewer of them, then the employee whose work produced those vehicles will be at least more vulnerable to layoffs and challenges. Mr. Schostek. Absolutely, Senator Scott, and thank you for the question. We are proud to make ATVs and side-by-sides in Timmonsville, SC. Senator Scott. Timmonsville, SC. No question. I did ask to go on one of the side-by-sides, and they told me that I was not an expert at driving, so stay out of vehicles immediately. Mr. Schostek. Safety first, Senator. Senator Scott. Safety first. Okay. I wanted to make sure that was accurate. [Laughter.] Mr. Schostek. And we also have 41 suppliers in South Carolina---- Senator Scott. Yes, sir. Mr. Schostek [continuing]. That support not only our motorcycle business and ATV business, but the auto business as well--so critical. But you hit the nail right on the head in terms of the ripple effect of these tariffs. So it starts with the raw material right now. It starts with aluminum and steel. If we add it to the parts that are being imported, and you are absolutely right, every single manufacturer--I do not care if your headquarters is in Asia, if your headquarters is in Europe, or if your headquarters is in Detroit--every single manufacturer, and there are 14 of them operating here in the United States, uses parts they source from the U.S., but also globally. The suppliers, companies like Mr. Haughey's--he has organized his company to cover various regions. He is not just in one place. Senator Scott. Right. Mr. Schostek. Right; so this is a very interdependent and complex supply chain, and the value chain from the beginning of concept and design, doing R&D here all the way to the end of distribution, getting things into Mr. Gates's door--tariffs are going to hurt the whole supply chain. I have seen it ripple right across. Senator Scott. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator. Senator Menendez? Senator Wyden. Mr. Chairman, I think it is Senator Portman and then Senator Menendez. The Chairman. I guess that is right. Sen"
