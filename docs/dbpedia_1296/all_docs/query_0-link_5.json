Larson.\n\nIt stars Matt McColm as the title character, a superhero whose real name was Johnny Domino, a saxophonist. Englehart would write three episodes of the series. Night Man is also one of the few series to cross over with characters from Larson's previous series: in the episode \"Manimal\", Johnny allies with Professor Jonathan Chase, the star of the short-lived 1980s' series Manimal.",
