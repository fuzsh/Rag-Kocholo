        "text": "Vick Chamberlain Vick Chamberlain Series: Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles Gender: Male Notability: Antagonist Occupation: Assassin Race: Robot Location: Van Nuys, Los Angeles, California Status: Deceased Died: 2007 First: \"Gnothi Seauton\" Final: \"Queen's Gambit\" Actor: Matt McColm\n\nVick Chamberlain is the name given to a fictional cyborg featured in the Terminator multimedia franchise. Played by actor Matt McColm, it appeared in the television spin-off series Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles. The character was introduced in episode 1x02, \"Gnothi Seauton\", though it was just an unidentified Terminator at this time.\n\nBiography[]\n\nConstructed in the future around the year 2027, this Series 888 Terminator was sent back in time to the year 2007 to assassinate members of a resistance cell that escaped captivity from one of Skynet's work camps. It tracked the group down to an apartment complex in California and killed all who were present.\n\nBefore it had a chance to leave, it recognized people coming up the steps. The Terminator laid upon the floor, posing as one of the many victims. Sarah Connor and Cameron Phillips entered the room and found the bodies. When Cameron inspected the T-888, it leaped up and attacked her, only then realizing that Cameron was a Terminator herself, albeit of an unknown model. The two fought one another and their battle was taken to the street. Sarah Connor stole a pedestrian's motorcycle and followed the Terminator while Cameron pursued it on foot. Sarah leaned the bike to the ground and slid it towards him, tripping him up. Cameron and the Terminator fought again, but Cameron was struck by an oncoming vehicle, enabling the T-888 the chance to escape.\n\nVick encountered Sarah and Cameron a second time shortly thereafter, but this time, John Connor was with them. Cameron was temporarily incapacitated when she received an electric shock from a booby trapped vault. Without their heavy hitter, Sarah and John had little chance of surviving an attack by the Terminator. Pitching Cameron's inert form out the window, the two followed suit and managed to get away from the stoic killer. [1]\n\nNotes & Trivia[]\n\nThe character of Vick Chamberlain was created by director David Nutter and teleplay writer Josh Friedman based on concepts originally developed by James Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd.\n\nActor Matt McColm is best known for his work as a television stunt man.
