Our Belgian offices take responsibility for sales, service and support throughout Benelux.

As a result, while Agilent offers careers across many disciplines, in Belgium the focus is primarily on R&D, customer service and sales to new and existing customers.

Agilent has offices in Diegem and Ghent.

Our employees are part of a rich Agilent culture that is diverse and yet shares the same Agilent values of speed, focus and accountability. These values empower employees to make a difference, to be creative and to take risks and provide solutions for our customers.
