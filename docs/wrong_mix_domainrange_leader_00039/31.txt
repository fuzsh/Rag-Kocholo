IDH puts people, planet, and progress at the heart of trade by leveraging the power of markets to create better jobs, better incomes, a better environment, and gender equity for all. To achieve this objective, IDH brings together people within corporations, the global financial sector, and governments with influence over global value chains to co-create and co-invest.

The Belgian IDH office was established mid-2019, after the Belgian government appointed IDH to manage the Beyond Chocolate Program. This multi-stakeholder partnership aims to make the Belgian chocolate sector more sustainable, bringing together over 70 important actors along the cocoa supply chain.

The Belgian office has continued to manage the program and has expanded its scope over the years. As such, the office is now working on a program on living wages in a variety of sectors.

The second phase of Beyond Chocolate is now undergoing (2022-2025).
