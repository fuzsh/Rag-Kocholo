Louisville, KY - Brown‑Forman Corporation, one of the largest American-owned spirits and wine companies, launched its own business in Belgium and Luxembourg (BeLux) on the 1st of January, 2022, bringing distribution in-house for the first time since the company entered the two markets. At the same time, the new Brown‑Forman BeLux office has been opened in the city centre of Brussels.

“With our own dedicated team in place now, we will further the growth of our brands across all channels in both markets,” said Christophe Courboin, General Manager Brown‑Forman BeLux.

“Belgium and Luxembourg are important markets for us in Europe to drive the growth of our Jack Daniel’s Family of Brands and our broader Super Premium brand portfolio. We strongly believe this move will offer us increased consumer focus and prioritisation of our brands. With a great, talented new team, we believe we are well positioned for a bright future,” said Marshall Farrer, President of Europe Division, Brown‑Forman.

Belgium and Luxembourg have a substantial whiskey market, together being among the top 10 markets in the European Union for Premium+ Whisky in volume. American whiskey - especially the super-premium category - continues to grow and attract new consumers to the category.
