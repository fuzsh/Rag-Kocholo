Cultural images of presidents have arguably been as vital to the nation’s political history as the policies and unscripted contingencies that have shaped their various tenures in office.”\n\nHaving joined UAS in 2002, Dr. David Noon teaches all periods of U.S. History. He earned his doctoral degree from the University of Minnesota in American Studies. His research centers on the period between the Civil War and World War I, the history of race and social science, and contemporary debates about empire in American history.\n\nHis dissertation, “This is (Not) a Child: Race, Gender, and ‘Development’ in the Child Sciences, 1880-1910,” displays the full range of Dr. Noon's research interests in history, which include developmental psychology, criminology, medicine, and the social construction of race and gender. More recently, Dr. Noon has written about the use of World War analogies in contemporary political rhetoric, cold war historical memory in the fiction of Don DeLillo, and the work of neoconservatives and Christian prophecy writers in the war on terrorism."
