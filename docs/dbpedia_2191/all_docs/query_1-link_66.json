        "text": "MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:\n\nOK, so there's been a lot of coverage of breaking or breakdancing, which, of course, made its Olympic debut this year in Paris.\n\nAILSA CHANG, HOST:\n\nThat's right. But, you know, that made me wonder, Mary Louise - what sports and events have they taken out of the Olympics over the years? So I did some digging to find out.\n\nKELLY: Excellent question. What did you find?\n\nCHANG: Well, up first, hot-air ballooning - it was at the 1900 Olympics.\n\nKELLY: Really? That was a sport?\n\nCHANG: It was. I mean, I didn't compete in it, but basically...\n\nKELLY: (Laughter).\n\nCHANG: ...The participants had to fly their balloons as close as possible to a target and then drop a weighted marker as close as they could to that target.\n\nKELLY: Fair enough. All right, what else did you find?\n\nCHANG: Well, did you know, Mary Louise, that there used to be arts competitions?\n\nKELLY: I did not. Art, like painting art?\n\nCHANG: Well, more than that. Competitors could win an Olympic medal for architecture, literature, music, painting and sculpture. At the 1948 games, there were even medals given out for poetry.\n\nKELLY: Finally, an event I could compete in.\n\nCHANG: (Laughter).\n\nKELLY: OK, what else?\n\nCHANG: Well, we know they still have shooting competitions, but they used to have pistol dueling way back at the 1908 games.\n\nKELLY: Pistol dueling?\n\nCHANG: Yeah (laughter).\n\nKELLY: I'm frightened to ask how you win.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nCHANG: OK, well, it wasn't an actual duel, like in the old Western movies. Instead, competitors fired wax bullets at human-shaped dummies with a bullseye on the chest area.\n\nKELLY: (Laughter).\n\nCHANG: So it's kind of safe.\n\nKELLY: OK. Any others to land this for us?\n\nCHANG: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. OK, the last one - and I think they could actually bring this back - it is the classic tug-of-war.\n\nKELLY: What - how did they ever get rid of that?\n\nCHANG: (Laughter).\n\nKELLY: That sounds perfect.\n\nCHANG: I know, right? From 1900 to 1920s, when this event happened, eight players on each team, with a marker in the middle of the rope - both teams pull until the marker reaches their side.\n\nKELLY: Now, that I could get behind watching.\n\nCHANG: Me too.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF NEAL FRANCIS SONG, \"DON'T CALL ME NO MORE\")\n\nCopyright © 2024 NPR.
