        "text": "Waxing Sanitation & Information\n\nThe Difference between Soft and Hard Waxes\n\nBoth hard and soft waxes can vary in color, consistency and temperature.\n\nTypically, hard waxes are meant to be kept at low temperatures, used without a strip or cloth and are removed with lifting the edge of the wax itself and pulling tightly against the opposite direction of hair growth.\n\nHard wax should be used in any area with sensitivity such as the Bikini/Brazilian and any facial waxing services. Hard waxes are best at removing coarse hair growth.\n\nSoft Waxes are used with a strip or cloth to remove hair from areas like the legs, chest,arms, stomach and back. Soft wax will stick to soft, fine hairs with more ease than hard waxes. Soft waxes, typically, should not be used in areas with sensitivity due to the risk of injury to the skin tissue.\n\nWhy we use hard wax\n\nFace Forward chooses to use only Hard wax for Brazilian and Bikini areas as well as all facial waxing services. Our high quality wax, BerodinÂ®, ensures that the occurrence of damage to skin tissue is reduced.\n\nUnlike soft wax, the hard wax shrink wrapping technology only grabs hair, effectively removing the hair directly from the follicle root without sticking to skin, resulting in a less sensitive waxing experience and a smooth, clean finish. applicators\n\nWe never use the same applicator twice\n\nAll waxing services should be included in this rule. This is a BIG NO,NO! Double dipping can lead to serious skin infections. This is when the Service Provider uses the same stick more than one time.\n\nBacteria is introduced into the wax and harbored in the wax only to be introduced back to your skin. Most waxes are antimicrobial, which just means the wax will not produce bacteria itself, but will not kill bacteria that has come from an external source. It is sad to say, but most salons DO NOT practice this method.\n\nWe always wear latex-free gloves\n\nService Providers should always wear gloves, this is for your protection and their own. Any cuts, lesions or open wounds not protected by gloves should be covered to prevent the spreading of bacteria and infection.\n\nWe always keep our wax at low temperatures\n\nIf you feel uncomfortable with the waxing temperature let your service provider know immediately! The provider should have tested the wax on herself prior to waxing clients to determine temperature level. If a wax temperature is to hot and you get burned this is serious and can lead to scarring and infection. Ask your provider to adjust the temperature to your level of comfort.\n\nWe always sanitize our tools\n\nYour safety is our #1 concern!!! Before any tool touches your body, it is sanitized with a hospital grade sanitizer to eliminate cross contamination. This is above state standards requirements for sanitization."
