Just FYI, BuzzFeed and its publishing partners may collect a share of sales and/or other compensation from the links on this page.\n\n31 Things You Should Just Go Ahead And Buy Now Instead Of Waiting For Someone To Give Them To You As A Gift\n\nWhy wait for a holiday or birthday when you have it now, I ask you.\n\n1. Wax seal stickers considerably less messy than the real deal. Plus, you don't need to deal with buying a bunch of melting equipment or deciding what your crest should look like; these flowers work for all occasions, like wedding invitations, scrapbooks, and leaving cute notes for your roommates!\n\nPromising review: \"I purchased the translucent wax seal stickers for my homemade greeting cards to add a seal to the envelope. These stickers do not look like stickers, they look like real wax seals, but better. I love them! Great adhesive that truly sticks well.\" —Sephina Shimizu\n\nGet a pack of 72 or 108 stickers from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in three styles).\n\n2. A copper charm, which works as a natural fungicide to keep flowers happy and water fresh for longer (goodbyyyye having to change the water every other day). Reviewers say they prefer it over plant food for extending the life of their bouquets. This is the gift that keeps on giving because now, every bouquet you get yourself will last a little longer.\n\nAmazon\n\nPromising review: \"My blooms lasted for three weeks with this copper heart. It’s not only beautiful, but it miraculously works! I could not believe how long the flowers my husband sent lasted. I usually get one week at best with plant food. Having fresh blooms around makes me calmer and happier. I am actually still in shock at how well this simple little copper heart worked. I felt like it warranted a 5-star review. A+ product!\" —LPB\n\nGet it from Amazon for $10.99 (available in two shapes).\n\n3. And if you're making your own bouquets, a flower frog set offering a grid system to make arrangements a snap. Pro tip: Go to Trader Joe's for cheap flowers and get to work making award-winning works of art.\n\nAmazon\n\nPromising review: \"I love to have fresh cut flowers in the house, and with spring and summer right around the corner, I wanted something to display flowers from my garden. The design allows a small bouquet to look much larger. Friends have commented on it and asked where I got it. I think it would make a great gift for any flower enthusiast.\" —J. Williams\n\nGet it from Amazon for $10.95.\n\n4. A pair of fruit-shaped hand towels that reviewers say are super soft and dry quickly. Personally, I'm eyeing the peach variation, but the orange and pineapple versions are super cute too.\n\nPromising review: \"This product is amazing. I purchased one for the kids' bathroom and a smaller fruit for the kitchen. They are soft and dry quickly. They wash well and bring a fun and cute look to any room. They are the perfect size for hanging in the kitchen. Definitely worth the price I paid.\" —Sher\n\nGet a set of two from Amazon for $9.89+ (available in eight colors).\n\n5. A pair of minimalist magazine holders to help you showcase your favorite magazine, photobook, or children's book. This would look very cute in a reading nook, just saying.\n\nAmazon\n\nPromising review: \"These are a very fun alternative shelf option in our RV. We needed a place to put our books and iPads. I even use it for my phone at night. The style fits perfectly, and also these were easy to assemble.\" —Frankly Just Nikki\n\nGet them from Amazon for $35.\n\n6. A fun Rachel Antonoff turtleneck that showers you with awards. The ribbon pattern will really make you feel like a winner!\n\nOffe Market\n\nOffe Market was founded by a former buyer for Ban.do (so, uh, yeah, great taste) and is sort of an indie version of TJ Maxx. It sells discounted items from trendy bands like Dusen Dusen and Baggu.\n\nGet it from Offe Market for $122 (originally $175; available in women's sizes XS–3X).\n\n7. A disco ball diffuser so your next dance party can smell like, really good. Add your favorite fragrance, pick one of seven color settings, and watch as the diffuser spins and puts on a light show.\n\nPromising review: \"This dopamine decor really hits the spot. Ordered one and noticed I wasn’t receiving a strong mist after a few uses. I contacted the company through Instagram and within minutes, I got a response and confirmation a new one was going to be sent. We are still going strong with this new one, and I use it EVERY DAY.\" —Addie Miller\n\nGet it from Amazon for $39.97.\n\n8. Hand-blown glass olive earrings with gold-plated chains perfect to wear to your next cocktail party. Best of all, each one is slightly unique, so you can feel extra special when you wear them.\n\nNotte Jewelry\n\nYou can also find a matching olive necklace here.\n\nNotte Jewelry is a small business owned by Jessica Tse, a former accessories trend director.\n\nGet it from Notte Jewelry for $38+ (available in one or two earrings).\n\n9. A shark onesie for anyone who wishes every week was shark week. The wide fin sleeves and toothy hood make this the ultimate cozy hang 'fit.\n\nNote: Reviewers mention that you should size up.\n\nPromising review: \"I got this for my son, and since the day it came in, he's barely taken it off long enough for me to wash and dry it. He even sleeps in it. Needless to say, he really likes it! Great quality, too.\" —Jessica flores\n\nGet it from Amazon for $19.90+ (available in sizes XS–XXXL).\n\n10. A pack of checkered hand towels that are lusciously vibrant and fluffy. You'd be surprised what a new pack of towels could do for a kitchen or bathroom, especially when they're this cute.\n\nAmazon\n\nI love these towels! I use them in my bathroom, and the pop of color really helps with the otherwise dreary look of the gray tiles. I rent, so finding easy ways to brighten the space is key.\n\nPromising review: \"They're soft, fluffy, and vibrant. They're the perfect hand towels for your bathroom or your kitchen. Worth every single penny.\" —Carter James\n\nGet a pack of four from Amazon for $22.99.\n\n11. A Lego flower bouquet because sometimes the best flowers are the ones you have to build yourself. Also, they don't die! The kit helps you build 15 stems with flower and leaf varieties like roses, snapdragons, poppies, asters, daisies, and grasses.\n\nPromising review: \"This is a great gift for anyone who loves flowers. They are as sturdy as they get since they're Legos and although they do take a while to build, it's a very fulfilling process. Love it and would set aside as something to gift to several people at any point. They look beautiful!!\" —Gaby\n\nGet it from Amazon for $47.99.\n\n12. A wiggly dachshund wall hook that, quite *frankly*, is the perfect spot to hang your dog leash and other equipment.\n\nThriftyweenqueen825 / Etsy\n\nThriftyweenqueen is a New York-based small business run by Birdie that sells quirky wooden decor.\n\nGet it from Thriftyweenqueen825 on Etsy for $80 (available in 12 colors).\n\n13. A polka-dot tie dress perfect for outdoor adventures where you want to be comfortable but polished enough to take pictures. Also, note the pockets, which are perfect for tucking your hands into when you're not sure how to pose. Surely I'm not the only one with this problem? 🧍\n\nPromising review: \"Liked the dress so much that I bought two! The material is sturdy with a super nice cut. Not see-through at all. I’ve never needed to iron them (even after being packed in a suitcase). The colors are just as pictured, and they launder beautifully. Also, the pockets lay flat, so they don’t give that widened hip appearance. Overall, super happy with these purchases, and people have complimented both!\" —KC\n\nGet it from Amazon for $35.99 (available in women's sizes S–XL and 19 colors).\n\n14. A pack of curly-edged ankle socks that'll look soooo good peaking out from Mary Janes or loafers. As far as '90s trends coming back, I admit I have been feeling nostalgic about these socks!\n\nAmazon\n\nPromising review: \"I love these socks. They are thicker than I thought they would be. I wash them in a bag rolled up, and they come out fine. Size was perfect.\" —Kim B\n\nGet them from Amazon for $7.99+ (available in nine styles and pack sizes).\n\n15. A cocoon-like pullover hoodie dress to wear on days when you want to dress up but long for the comfort of your favorite sweatshirt. This thing hits the knees, meaning you can roll into a ball and hide inside it when needed.\n\nPromising review: \"This dress is perfect for any occasion. I wore it out with sneakers to a ball game and got so many compliments. The material stretches, so it was easy to move in. I later paired it with some dressy flats to go to dinner, and everyone raved about how nice I looked. The material is so soft, and it’s the right thickness to keep you warm on a chilly day but not too hot for a sunny day. I will order more.\" —KJ\n\nGet it from Amazon for $43.99 (available in women's sizes S–3XL and 16 colors).\n\n16. \"Liquipens\" — a cross between a pen and a lava lamp. These are fun to play with and likely mesmerizing enough to keep you entertained while taking notes in class.\n\nPromising review: \"I broke up the three-pack and gave one pen as a gift for a class gift exchange and put the other two in a stocking for Christmas. Good quality and approved by both the 8-year-old and 49-year-old husband, who is a kid at heart! Definitely recommend.\" —Kindle Customer\n\nGet a set of three from Amazon for $13.99.\n\n17. A darling strawberry vase you can fill with flowers, pens, kitchen tools — or, if you wanna go for realism, a leafy houseplant.\n\nAmazon\n\nPromising review: \"Smaller than expected, but I love it for making cute, bright, happy arrangements. Looks great with daisies of all sorts.\" —dayna haley\n\nGet it from Amazon for $26.95.\n\n18. A coconut soy scented candle that smells like a freshly picked bouquet (think: lily of the valley, wood, dewy leaves, ylang-ylang). With a burn time of around 45 hours, it's likely to outlast those flowers too.\n\nLoam\n\nLoam is a Black woman-owned small-batch candle company that draws inspiration from founder and urban farmer Jessica White’s time spent in gardens around Los Angeles.\n\nGet it from Loam for $33.\n\n19. A sugar-free, gluten-free, soy-free, and nut-free brownie mix for an inclusive treat everyone can enjoy at movie night. Reviewers say that the texture and taste are spot on, and it still feels like a dessert despite the lack of sugar.\n\nAmazon\n\nGood Dee's a small business founded by Deana, who wanted to create a business that sold snacks the whole family could enjoy.\n\nPromising review: \"I've made so many homemade and packaged brownie recipes for the low-carb/keto lifestyle, and this is by far the best. I made it using the cake-style recipe, and it was still very moist and fudgy. Yes, they are expensive, but as a little treat, they'll keep me going with my low-carb efforts, so they are well worth it to me.\" —DrLja\n\nGet it from Amazon for $13.99.\n\n20. A handheld capybara that's sure to be your guiding light when it comes to taking it easy. After all, what animal is chiller than the capybara?\n\nThis night-light can be turned on by tapping or squeezing it. It has two brightness settings and turns off automatically after 20 minutes. The listing has other fun shapes, like a pizza, lucky cat, and unicorn.\n\nPromising review: \"Cute night-light for any capybara lover. Gives off a good amount of light and it’s not too bright or overpowering.\" —jaydynomite\n\nGet it from Amazon for $16.99 (also available in 13 other shapes).\n\n21. A set of mushroom bookmarks because I know I'm not the only one who wants to live in a fairytale home.\n\nAmazon\n\nPromising review: \"These are very cute! I love the flexibility. The stems are long so it will not get knocked out your book (my book is always roaming in my bag). The top is subtle. It really looks like a mushroom emerging from your book. Worth the buy.\" —Atticus\n\nGet a set of four from Amazon for $7.99.\n\n22. Soot sprite dryer balls that'll look sooo cute bouncing around in your dryer. Besides being adorable, they reduce drying time, prevent wrinkles, and soften clothes, all without coating your stuff in a waxy residue like dryer sheets do.\n\nDryer balls are eco-friendly *and* budget friendly because you can use them over and over. Friendsheep is a small business that sells dryer balls handmade by women in Kathmandu, Nepal.\n\nPromising review: \"These are so incredibly cute! I love that they look like soot sprites! I used them today and noticed a significant decrease in drying time. No static, and able to be scented with essential oils. A great alternative to polyester, single-use dryer sheets.\" —Daria\n\nGet a pack of three from Amazon for $18.\n\n23. An alarm clock on wheels that works like an annoying assistant that forces you out of bed. It'll roll around, jump, shake, make robotic sounds, and generally cause mayhem until you muster the energy to make it stop.\n\nClocky is a small business!\n\nPromising review: \"My friends and family all know how terrible I am at waking up in the morning. Every alarm clock I have ever used has been defeated by my quick 'hit snooze button' reflexes. So much so that I find myself rushing for the door more often than I'd like. All that changed when I found Clocky. CLOCKY WORKS! Clocky moves, so I can't get comfortable or used to where the snooze button is placed. I easily carry Clocky to any room in the house I choose to get cozy, relax, and watch some TV 'til I fall asleep on a work night. I LOVE CLOCKY and highly recommend giving it a chance because you will fall in love with the results. I am now actively waking up at the original time I set my alarm to and also staying up so I can have a productive day. Get Clocky and save your day! ☆☆☆☆☆\" —Valued Customer\n\nGet it from Amazon for $35.99 (available in nine colors).\n\n24. A Slate electric flosser, which multitasks as a tongue scraper and gum stimulator, meaning your dental routine is about to enter the pros. I'm talking, just-walked-out-of-a-dental-appointment type of clean!\n\nThis kit comes with five heads (which last about a week or more; you simply use, rinse, and let dry).\n\nPromising review: \"I have really tight teeth, and flossing can be less than fun. This is magic and makes flossing so easy. I had to get one for my husband to use after I got mine. It can be hard to innovate around floss, of all things, but this is legit! Get one for every family member.\" —Amazon Customer\n\nGet it from Amazon for $89.99+ (also available in an orthodontic-friendly kit).\n\n25. A bead-filled weighted eye mask that'll make you feel like your head is getting a really nice bear hug. Thanks to its light-blocking abilities, it's helped over 4,000 happy reviewers get decent shut-eye.\n\n26. A variety pack of hard candies spiced with traditional Mexican flavors that will delight the senses. Spicy, sweet, and tangy all come together to create flavor magic.\n\nTamalitoz is a Latinx- and Queer-owned business based in Texas. This ribbon-style candy is filled with a mild chili lime seasoning, making for a tangy, sweet treat. It was started in a tiny candy store in Mexico City by husband-and-husband team, Jack and Dec.\n\nPromising review: \"I once tried these after seeing them on a checkout line, and now I am completely in love. They are the perfect mixture of sweet, spicy, and salty! Since I go through them pretty fast, this is a great way to get all the flavors for a good price at once. They tend to get stuck together in transit, especially when traveling in Florida, but I’ve never had trouble separating them by gently patting the bag. If these candies pique your interest, go ahead and buy them!\" —Katie\n\nGet five bags from Amazon for $29.50.\n\n27. A miniature clay pottery wheel that lets kids and adults make cute clay vases and sculptures in a mess-free environment. This gadget comes with template guides and enough clay for up to 10 projects.\n\nAmazon\n\nPromising review: \"This mini pottery wheel was great for my daughter, and we had a blast playing with it. It was a bit of a learning curve at first, but we figured it out. I wish the pottery we made could be bigger. Maybe this is just a beginner's kind of device, but it sparked my interest so much that I want to get something larger now and do some real pottery. Overall, it was worth it.\" —Jason Custodio\n\nGet it from Amazon for $20.99+ (available in regular or deluxe, which makes double the amount of projects).\n\n28. Retro rectangle sunglasses for an easy way to elevate an otherwise blah outfit. 11,000+ people gave these sunnies 5 stars, so surely they're worth a try!\n\nPromising reviews: \"Very chic. Comes with a microfiber glasses pouch. Feel durable, not flimsy like most cheap sunglasses. The black ones are my favorite. Gave the other pair to my mom. She loves them.\" —Love_Jailene\n\n\"Wow, these are great, especially for the price. Can’t beat it. Got pricier ones that I didn’t want to wear for a trip so I purchased these, similar style...They are not flimsy at all, great sun protection, and stylish (in my opinion). Def wearing them again.\" —NickLex\n\nGet them from Amazon for $10.99 (available in 32 styles).\n\n29. A fruit-shaped bed your cat will go absolutely bananas for! Just think of the photo shoot you could have with this.\n\n30. A birdfeeder with a built-in camera so you can spy on your feathered friends and make notes on the avian goings-on.

The videos are high-def and have night vision so you can see every feather on that cardinal's head.\n\nPromising review: \"Got this for my 95-year-old dad. He loves watching the feed of the birds come to visit, and I get to watch his feed from my home, too.
