        "text": "Have you ever noticed a pesky chin hair and thought, Where did this come from?! If so, you're not alone. Whether you tend to embrace your facial hair growth or not, it can feel frustrating when random hairs pop up seemingly out of nowhere. The truth is, chin hair in women is actually pretty common, and it's usually due to genetics and hormones.\n\n“Chin hair is more common in women with higher levels of androgens (including testosterone), certain medical conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and women with a family history of excessive hair growth (hirsutism),” says Azza Halim, MD, a physician at Azza MD Beauty. Note: Testosterone is the primary hormone that produces male characteristics, and while it's dominant in men, women produce a low level of the hormone, too. An increase or imbalance can sometimes cause unwanted facial hair.\n\nTo be clear, there's nothing wrong with having facial hair. But if your pesky chin hair is starting to grow longer than Kendrick Lamar's diss tracks and you're ready to grab your tweezers or book a waxing appointment ASAP, it's OK to remove it, too. Ahead, experts share the potential causes of chin hair in women and how to remove it safely (if you feel so inclined).\n\nMeet the experts: Azza Halim, MD is a physician and anesthesiologist at Azza MD Beauty. Rachel Lee Lozina is an esthetician and owner of Blue Water Spa. Minisha Sood, MD, is a New York City-based endocrinologist.\n\n7 Causes Of Chin Hair In Women\n\n1. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)\n\nPCOS is a condition in which the ovaries produce an abnormal amount of androgens. It has long been characterized by cysts that grow on the ovaries, which can prevent eggs from maturing and often cause fertility issues, according to the Office of Women's Health (OWH). That said, it's possible to have PCOS and not have cysts—and some women without a PCOS diagnosis can still develop cysts, per Johns Hopkins Medicine.\n\nPCOS can also impact your hormone levels, leading to weight gain, irregular periods, acne, and, yup, increased hair growth. People with PCOS often notice excessive hair growth specifically in androgen-dependent areas, like the chin, says Dr. Sood. If you have PCOS, you might also experience coarse and dark hair on the abdomen, upper thighs, low back, and butt. Sound familiar? Your best bet is to see an endocrinologist to determine what's up.\n\n2. Ovarian Or Adrenal Tumors\n\nOvarian or adrenal tumors can cause pelvic pain, pressure, irregular vaginal bleeding, and might ramp up your body's production of those facial hair-causing androgen hormones. Many of these tumors are asymptomatic, but if they are in fact producing excess hormones, you may experience other symptoms such as unexplained weight gain, easy bruising, acne, high blood pressure, high blood glucose (sugar) levels, changes in body odor, among other signs, Dr. Sood says.\n\nIf you have all or some of these symptoms, it's time to visit your doc, who can issue the appropriate medical scans to determine if there's an ovarian growth in your body that's to blame for overproduction of testosterone. Don't worry: Most of these growths are benign, although they can be malignant (meaning cancerous) in rare cases. In some cases, surgery may be needed to remove an ovarian or adrenal tumor (even if it's benign). But on the bright side, the growth likely won't return once it's removed, according to the National Library of Medicine (NLM).\n\n3. Cushing's Syndrome\n\nCushing's syndrome, also known as hypercortisolism, is an endocrine disorder that's often the result of long-term exposure to high levels of cortisol, a hormone produced by your adrenal gland, per the NIH. Cushing's syndrome can also be caused by taking corticosteroids (a type of inflammation-reducing steroid) for a prolonged period, or by an adrenal tumor.\n\nIf you're concerned your facial hair might be due to Cushing's syndrome, talk to your endocrinologist for an adrenal evaluation. The process will likely involve imaging and blood and urine testing to check for abnormal levels of the specific hormones made by the adrenal glands, says Dr. Sood.\n\n4. Insulin Resistance Or Diabetes\n\nWhen you're insulin resistant, your body doesn't respond properly to insulin—a hormone that helps turn sugar into energy, according to NLM. Instead, your blood sugar stays elevated, which can lead to prediabetes and diabetes. Insulin resistance can also raise the body's levels of testosterone, and in turn, the amount of facial and body hair you grow, Dr. Sood says.\n\nSo, what are the signs of diabetes? Being increasingly thirsty, urinating more frequently, and feeling weak and fatigued are all ways your body tries to tell you it's experiencing issues related to insulin resistance. Your doc can order blood tests to determine if you have, say, diabetes. Once your body's insulin resistance is in control, there's a good chance your hair growth will return to normal.\n\n5. Pregnancy\n\nIt's no secret that hormonal fluctuations are common when you're pregnant, and that includes changes in estrogen and testosterone levels. Typically, testosterone rises but estrogen increases as well, so many women don't experience symptoms like unwanted hair growth despite the turned-up male hormones, Dr. Sood says.\n\nHowever, this isn't the case for all women. It's hard to predict exactly what pregnancy-related hormonal changes will bring up, so don't be afraid to call your ob-gyn, says Dr. Sood. A simple blood test may help determine if your chin or facial hair is just another physical change from pregnancy or if something else needs to be addressed, she says.\n\n6. Aging\n\nAlthough it's common to associate aging with hair loss, getting older can also mean growing more facial hair. “There are a multitude of reasons excessive hair growth happens as you get older,” says Lozina. “One reason is the reduction in estrogen production, which leaves testosterone as the overpowering hormone.” If you notice more chin hair popping up the older you get, it could simply be a product of aging and your hormones changing with time.\n\n7. Hirsutism\n\nHirsutism is a condition that causes excessive facial hair growth in women due to an increase in androgens. This hormonal change can cause fine, \"vellous\" hair follicles to produce larger, darker, thicker hair, per the Endocrine Society. Hair can appear on a woman’s chest, arms, back, stomach, and face, so if you notice chin hair popping up all of a sudden, it could be a sign of hirsutism or another underlying endocrine disorder.\n\nHow To Remove Chin Hair\n\nThe decision to remove body hair is personal. If you do want to remove that one hair that won't go away, experts say there are many options.\n\n“The best way to remove chin hair depends on personal preference, pain level, and skin sensitivity,\" says Dr. Halim. \"Options include plucking with tweezers, waxing, dermaplaning, depilatory creams, and laser hair removal.\" You can also try something like threading or sugaring hair removal, which is similar to waxing but uses a different technique (and won't burn the skin with hot wax). Laser hair removal can be another preferred option for some, although it will likely be pricey, and might be better suited for women with darker hair, says Lozina.\n\nShaving is a quick and easy way to remove chin hair, but it might do more damage than you think. \"I am not a fan of shaving chin hair, but some people prefer this method,\" Lozina says. Shaving can ingrown hairs and in some cases, acne on the face—and waxing can lift the skin along with the hair, causing skin irritation, says Lozina.\n\nAlthough the decision to remove your chin hair is personal, experts recommend finding a safe hair removal option for you that won't cause discomfort or negative side effects. “The worst ways to remove chin hair are any methods that are painful, irritating, or can cause skin damage, such as using a dull razor, tweezing with unclean tools, or picking the skin and ingrown hairs,” says Dr. Halim.\n\nMore beauty stories this way...\n\nHow to treat hormonal acne\n\n10 best moisturisers for acne prone skin\n\nHere's why tea tree oil is your secret weapon against spots\n\nHow to deal with stress-induced acne: 'My skin’s barrier was completely broken, so retinol made it worse'\n\nTwo women reveal how benzoyl peroxide transformed their skin\n\nCut through the noise and get practical, expert advice, home workouts, easy nutrition and more direct to your inbox.
