        "text": "Admittedly (and probably obviously), we are a little obsessed with all things wax! However, we are very aware that this might be a whole new world for most people which is why we are going to take you through the various types of wax you can choose from to accompany your beautiful wax stamps.\n\n1. Glue Gun Wax\n\nThis option is probably the best for creating large quantities of wax seals. These wax sticks are flexible, meaning that they shouldn't break when bent or dropped. They are the perfect wax for making wax seals that will be used on invitations or in the mail. Our wax is made specifically for use with a standard 7mm or 11mm glue gun, the contemporary and efficient way to stamp wax seals! We recommend using a low-temperature (105Â°C) glue gun for our wax.\n\n2. Wicked Wax\n\nAs the name suggests, this type of wax has a wick running through the centre of the stick. Wicked Wax creates a beautiful authentic drip effect, leaving dots of wax around the impression made by your handcrafted wax stamp. Traditional wick wax sticks are incredibly simple to use and don't need any other equipment such as a glue gun to melt the wax. Just light the wick, drip the wax, then stamp the impression!\n\n3. Bank Of England Wax\n\nIf you've ever watched any movies or TV shows set in times where wax seals were used for almost all communication, then you have probably seen Bank of England Wax in motion. This wax will crack and crumble when opened. Historically used by royalty as a means to discourage messengers from tampering with official communication before it reached its intended reader, once the seal is broken it cannot be undone. This wax is quite delicate so therefore not recommended for mailing. Traditionally, Bank of England Wax is of extremely high quality with a high gloss finish.\n\n4. Beaded Wax\n\nA great option for creating seals using multiple colours of wax, these sealing wax beads are formed by hand into tiny sealing wax droplets. Sealing wax beads are so easy to use: gently melt in a spoon over a flame and pour directly onto your surface before making your wax seal impression. Colours can be mixed to create marbled wax seal impressions.\n\nYour choice of sealing wax depends on the look you want to achieve, the number of seals you wish to create and whether or not you hope for your seal to be long-lasting or not. We hope that this post helps you in deciding which wax is the one for you. Of course, if you are still unsure then please get in touch and we would be more than happy to help you."
