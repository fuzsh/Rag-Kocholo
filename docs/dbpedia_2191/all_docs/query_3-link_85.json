        "text": "Aloha fellow candle nerds! In my last post The Importance of a Wax Pool I discussed the problems that arise when you don’t allow a full wax pool to form. In this post I’ll be explaining the what and how of an absolute must-have candle accessory for larger jar candles to help you achieve a perfect wax pool:\n\nthe candle topper.\n\nWhen to use a candle topper\n\nBefore we get into it I should mention that a candle topper is meant to be used with larger jar candles and tumblers with a larger diameter and are not for use with your smaller jars or container candles with small diameters. Basically the smaller the candle is in width the easier and faster the wax pool forms so a candle topper for these candle types aren’t really necessary. Also, toppers are typically not needed with the 3-wick candles as the three flames produce enough heat to quickly form a wax pool. So if you like to burn large single wick jars read on!\n\nSo what the heck is a candle topper?\n\nA candle topper is typically an elegantly designed metal “lid” that sits on top of your larger jar candles while they burn. I currently have two candle toppers each with a generic design so I can use them year round. There are all sorts of candle toppers available and with unique designs for different times of the year. You can even get a shamrock designed topper to use around St. Patrick’s day if you’re really digging the Celtic culture! Toppers are also great if you burn candles in a dark room as they cast the beautiful designs on the ceiling and around the room, depending on the position of your candle. And since they’re made of metal they will last forever! I’ve had both of mine for two years and use them all the time with my large jars and they still look as new as the day I got them.\n\nHow does a candle topper work?\n\nIf you’ve ever burned a large candle you may notice the flame flickering and dancing about. A candle topper essentially eliminates this flicker allowing a constant heat source to radiate out over the wax surface allowing for a consistent and even burn. The toppers design also allows the candle to retain the heat which is needed to form larger wax pools.\n\nVariety of Candle toppers designs\n\nAs you can see candle toppers come in a variety of designs.
