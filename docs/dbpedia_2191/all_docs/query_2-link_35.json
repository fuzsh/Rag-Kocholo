        "text": "Have you ever opened a Scentsy Bar to see that the wax is … um … sweating?\n\nDo some of the Scentsy Bars in your stash not look as brightly colored as when you got them?\n\nWe receive all kinds of questions about our Scentsy Bars, so we thought we’d take a moment to answer some of the most frequently asked questions.\n\nBar basics:\n\nWhat is a Scentsy Bar?\n\nA Scentsy Bar is a block of fragrant wax in eight break-apart cubes. They’re available in dozens of exclusive Scentsy fragrances and designed for use in a Scentsy Warmer.\n\nWhere are Scentsy Bars made?\n\nScentsy manufactures all our wax products at our campus in Meridian, Idaho. Made in the USA!\n\nSweaty wax and color facts:\n\nWhy does my Scentsy Bar look like it’s sweating?\n\nExtreme variations in temperature can cause the fragrance oils in your Scentsy Bar to separate from the wax and bead on its surface. It looks a lot like sweat, but it’s not! Here are a couple of ways to help prevent “sweaty” wax:\n\nDon’t store your bars in the freezer.\n\nDo store your bars in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight or extreme temperatures.\n\nShould I throw away “sweaty” wax?\n\nNope! Any oils that separate from the bar should blend back in when the wax is warmed with no noticeable effect on your fragrance experience.\n\nWhy is my Scentsy Bar’s color fading?\n\nSeveral factors can contribute to color variation in your Scentsy Bars. Here are a couple simple things to keep in mind:\n\nStore your wax properly. Don’t remember how? Check out this post. Extreme heat or direct light can impact the look and shorten the shelf life of your bars.\n\nJust because it looks different, doesn’t mean it won’t still smell great! Color alone shouldn’t compel you to toss your wax in the trash. Try it first!\n\nI have two bars in the same fragrance. Why do they look different?\n\nDepending on the color(s) used to dye the wax, you might notice small variations. Any color difference is purely cosmetic and does not affect the fragrance, its intensity or fragrance potency.\n\nHelpful hints:\n\nWhat kind of wax is used to make Scentsy Bars?\n\nScentsy uses a custom, high-quality paraffin wax blend designed to provide long-lasting fragrance and selected for its scent loading ability, melting point and firmness (that means it warms beautifully and holds a lot of fragrance)!\n\nHow do I clean the wax out of my Scentsy Warmer?\n\nWhile the wax is melted, pour it into the trash (not the sink!) and wipe the dish clean with a paper towel. You can also use our Cotton Cleanup to absorb and remove wax.\n\nAre Scentsy Bars safe?\n\nScentsy Bars are safer than wicked candles because no flame is required. Since the wax is warmed and not burned like traditional candles, no harmful chemicals or pollutants are released into the air — just beautiful fragrance. That means no flame, smoke or soot!"
