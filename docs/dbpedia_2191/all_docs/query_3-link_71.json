        "text": "If you're a bikini wax newbie (but have been thinking of giving it a go), booking that first appointment can be a little daunting. It's hard not knowing what to expect - or how much it's going to hurt... But we're here to dispel those worries and give you a peek at what goes on behind the salon doors.\n\nFirst thing to remember? Beauty therapists are professionals, and will be able to put you at ease. If you have questions then don't hold back, it's totally fine to ask anything and everything that's on your mind.\n\nOk, let's get down to it. Here's the lowdown on exactly what happens at your first bikini wax appointment.\n\n1. Everyone feels a bit self-conscious, especially the first few times. But remember, beauty therapists have seen it all before and perform bikini waxes every day. Worrying about whether you're too hairy / not hairy enough / have rubbish knickers on is all very normal, but very unnecessary.\n\n2. There are several categories of bikini wax based on how much hair is removed and each is priced accordingly. The are a lot of different bikini wax shapes and styles, but the classic shape is the 'Bikini' and involves a simple touch up of hair at the front and a bit down below, so that it doesn't extend beyond your knicker line (this is the ideal wax for first-timers).\n\nThe 'Brazilian wax' involves a lot more hair removal – typically leaving just a 'landing strip' of hair at the front, all hair removed down below and even round the back! The 'Hollywood' is total hair removal, front to back. Many salons offer a 'High Bikini' or 'G String' wax, which is a little more thorough than your classic 'Bikini' shape, and includes hair removed from the top (to take your strip down in length).\n\n3. Your therapist will ask you to lie down on a salon bed/couch and remove your clothes below the waist. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO TAKE YOUR UNDERWEAR OFF IF YOU DON'T WANT TO (and most people don't)! They are very adept at working around your knickers to protect your modesty (Tip: wear comfy pants, not your best lacy undies that can be a little, er, scratchy).\n\n4. If you want a thorough wax like a Brazilian or Hollywood the therapist may find it easier if you remove your pants or offer you some disposable pants instead. Some salons which offer a form of hot wax without strips may also prefer you not wear anything. But your comfort comes first, so if you feel uneasy at any point, just speak up – or leave!\n\n5. The therapist normally asks you place one leg bent up at the knee and the other bent flat on the bed at a right angle. This exposes one side of your bikini line. She will then tuck a tissue into the edge of your pants to protect them from the wax.\n\n6. Wearing gloves, the therapist applies melted hot wax onto a small section of your hair using a spatula – it's warm, not too hot. Then a strip of cloth or muslin is applied on top of the wax, she presses down for a few seconds, holds the skin taut and pulls the strip away in one sharp tug. She continues repeating this process, both sides, until you're all done.\n\n7. OK, the therapist will be very close to your bum and may have to touch your labia and adjust you here and there to get the skin taut. Yeah it's weird, but necessary, especially if you choose a more intricate wax style.\n\n8. Just how painful is it? Everyone has different pain thresholds, but we won't kid you that it's painless (as many salons claim). Normally it results in a sharp intake of breath, but it definitely gets easier the more you have it done.\n\nIn some areas you'll hardly flinch; other spots result in a bit of involuntary swearing (top of the landing strip always seems a bit ouchy) - but either way, it's over in about two seconds. In our experience, the best therapists work in small sections and press down on the skin immediately after pulling off the wax strip to dull the pain – so ask your therapist to work this way.\n\n9. The therapist finishes by checking her handiwork and removing any remaining stray hairs with tweezers. Annoying, but important.\n\n10. Finally, a calming cream is applied all over. This feels really soothing. She'll leave the room to let you get dressed."
