        "text": "If youâve never had a bikini wax before, it can feel somewhat daunting. Here we answer all of the most frequently asked questions about intimate waxing. From how long it takes and how itâs done, to preparation and aftercare. Weâll also explain the different bikini wax styles and what you can expect.\n\nWhat is a bikini wax?\n\nLetâs start with the basics â what is a bikini wax? A bikini wax is a beauty treatment to remove hair from the pubic region. It can range from the traditional bikini shape, which involves tidying the pubic area to ensure no hair is visible outside of the knicker line, to a Hollywood wax which involves all pubic hair being removed.\n\nThere are four standard bikini wax styles:\n\nWhatâs a standard bikini wax?\n\nA perfectly shaped upside-down triangle of hair is left, with no hair escaping the knicker line at the top of the thigh.\n\nWhatâs a high or extended bikini wax?\n\nSimilar to the standard bikini wax, the high or extended bikini wax removes more hair to leave a smaller and more defined triangle.\n\nWhatâs a Brazilian wax?\n\nA Brazilian is sometimes nicknamed âthe landing stripâ! It removes all of the pubic hair but leaves a small neat strip at the front. This waxing involves removing the pubic hair between the legs and through into the buttocks area.\n\nWhatâs a Hollywood wax?\n\nThe Hollywood wax involves complete removal of all of the pubic hair, from the front, between the legs, and between the buttocks. Itâs the complete hair removal solution.\n\nWeâll answer more in depth questions about these different types of bikini wax styles later in this guide, but first letâs take you through some general intimate waxing questions.\n\nHow long does a bikini wax last?\n\nProbably the most commonly asked question by newbies to waxing is how long does a bikini wax last?\n\nThe answer is that it does depend slightly on how fast your hair grows. Generally you can expect it to last between 4-6 weeks until youâre ready for your next wax. Most people find that regular waxing means that the hair regrows much thinner and finer.\n\n[button link=\"https://book.secretspa.co.uk/categories/waxing\"] Book waxing[/button]\n\nDoes a bikini wax hurt?\n\nAgain, the answer to this does vary slightly. Thereâs no escaping that your first intimate waxing experience may be accompanied by a smarting sting. However, if you choose a professional and experienced beauty technician, they will ensure that they use methods and techniques to minimise the discomfort. Additionally, after the first time, itâs not as uncomfortable as the hair follicles have less âgripâ on the individual hairs. Most clients report that it didnât hurt as much as they anticipated it would.\n\nHow to prepare for a bikini wax\n\nWe highly recommend having bikini waxes done at home because you will feel considerably more comfortable and relaxed in your own space, especially if this is the first time youâve had an intimate wax.\n\nIn the couple of weeks before your first session, donât shave or use any other hair removal techniques. The hair will need to be at least 5-10mm.\n\nThe night before your wax, have a lovely warm bath and gently exfoliate the area. This removes dead skin and will make the process easier. Prior to your treatment have a shower for freshness and to relax. If you wish, you can take a couple of painkillers such as paracetamol about half an hour before your treatment.\n\nThe technician will arrive with everything they need and they will set this out on arrival. The treatment will take between 20-40 minutes depending on your chosen style.\n\nItâs normal to feel nervous the first time you have an intimate wax. The professional technician will encourage you to take slow deep breaths so that you are relaxed. The technician will also give you aftercare advice.\n\nBrazilian vs Hollywood wax\n\nUltimately, the choice between Brazilian and Hollywood waxing rests on personal preference. Some people prefer to leave a strip of hair (Brazilian) while others prefer complete hair removal (Hollywood).\n\nJust remember that there is a bigger difference between a bikini wax and a Brazilian or Hollywood wax. With the Brazilian and Hollywood the hair is also removed from between the legs from front to back. With a standard bikini wax, this hair isnât removed.\n\nIs getting a Brazilian wax awkward?\n\nA very common question for anyone getting an intimate wax done for the first time. Itâs very normal to feel nervous but you honestly have nothing to feel embarrassed about. Remember, your beautician has done this countless times before. They are professional and discrete, and will aim to put you at ease.\n\nHow is a Brazilian or Hollywood wax done?\n\nFirst up, youâll be asked to undress from the waist down. The technician will then discuss your preferred style. Youâll then be cleansed using some wipes, as this helps the wax to stick better. Next they may apply some oil or powder to protect the skin.\n\nGenerally, hot wax is used in intimate waxing, as it is more suitable for sensitive areas and thicker hair. Your technician will apply the hot wax with a wooden spatula. Once it has hardened, your technician will quickly peel back the wax, removing it from the skin along with the hair. Occasionally a few odd hairs may be missed and the technician will use tweezers to remove these. Lastly, a soothing cream or oil may be applied to prevent any ingrown hairs, and to prevent irritation.\n\nHow long does a Brazilian or Hollywood wax last?\n\nLike with a standard bikini wax, a Brazilian or Hollywood wax lasts around 4-6 weeks. For some people, the gap between waxes may be as frequent as every 3 weeks.\n\nHow long does a Brazilian or Hollywood wax take?\n\nUsually, a Brazilian or Hollywood wax takes around 40 minutes from start to finish.\n\nDoes a Brazilian or Hollywood wax hurt?\n\nAll intimate waxing stings a little for a short while, improving with repeat treatments. Does a Hollywood wax hurt more than a bikini wax? The skin on the labia and between the legs is obviously more sensitive than the skin along the bikini line. As such, both a Hollywood and a Brazilian wax come with a little more discomfort. However, this really does get better over time and the benefits are certainly worth it.\n\nIntimate waxing at home\n\nWe really canât recommend at home intimate waxing enough. You can shower immediately before it is done, and youâll feel more comfortable in your own home.\n\n[button link=\"https://book.secretspa.co.uk/categories/waxing\"]Book Waxing Treatments[/button]"
