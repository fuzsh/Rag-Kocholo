        "text": "If you’re tired of keeping up with a complicated waxing schedule and want to streamline your self-care routine, you might wonder, “How much is a full body wax?” Nationwide, the average full body wax price is $153. This may sound a little steep at first, but if you get waxed regularly, then booking a full body wax can actually save you some cash.\n\nIf you prefer completely smooth skin, it can be a lot of work to keep up with removing hair across multiple areas. A full body wax includes the most popular wax services like a full leg wax, arm wax, Brazilian wax, and more.\n\nHow much is the average full body wax?\n\nThe average full body wax costs $153, according to our internal StyleSeat data. Wax pricing varies based on the type of wax used, areas waxed, salon location, and esthetician experience. Some salons charge an extra fee if it’s your first wax so your esthetician can take the time to make you feel comfortable and ensure they don’t miss any hair.\n\nHow does a full body wax work?\n\nThe basic steps for a full body wax are the same as any other wax. Here’s what your esthetician will do to unveil smoother skin during your appointment:\n\nYour esthetician will cleanse the area they’re waxing with an alcohol-based wipe or spray to remove excess oil.\n\nThey’ll dip a disposable applicator into the hot wax, let it cool for a couple seconds, and test it to ensure it’s not too hot for your skin.\n\nNext, your esthetician will use the disposable applicator to spread the wax on your skin in the direction of hair growth.\n\nIf they’re using hard wax, they’ll remove the wax with their hands in the opposite direction of hair growth.\n\nIf they’re using soft wax, they’ll apply a clean linen cloth over the wax and use that cloth to remove the wax in the opposite direction of hair growth.\n\nTo reduce irritation, most salons will moisturize your skin with aloe vera. In some cases, like if you have very sensitive skin, cold packs might also be helpful to soothe freshly waxed skin.\n\nAs with any service, your salon might do things a bit differently. For example, before starting, your esthetician might lightly massage or dry brush the area so that your hair stands up straight. But there are a couple of red flags to look out for. If your salon does any of these things, stop the service and look elsewhere for your waxing needs:\n\nNot properly cleansing your skin, the waxing area, or tools before starting\n\nDouble dipping with the same applicator into the wax pot\n\nNot listening if you need a break or checking in with you throughout the service\n\nSkipping out on testing the wax temperature\n\nWhat does a full body wax include?\n\nThe typical full body wax includes:\n\nEyebrow wax – $20\n\nLip wax – $11\n\nUnderarm wax – $22\n\nArm wax – $39\n\nBack wax – $56\n\nStomach wax – $28\n\nBikini or Brazilian wax – $58\n\nFull leg wax – $70\n\nIf you added the average cost of those services together, a full body wax would cost $304. This is much more expensive than the average full body wax, but your potential savings will depend on where you live and what’s included in your salon’s body wax service.\n\nSome salons offer a limited body wax. This is a similar service but excludes less common areas such as your back or stomach. It might also exclude facial waxing.\n\nIf your local salon doesn’t list which services are included in a body wax or if you’d like to add on other services like a facial massage, reach out to them directly.\n\nHow long does a full body wax last?\n\nA full body wax lasts around six weeks. Many estheticians recommend waxing every four to six weeks for maintenance, but this depends on how quickly your hair grows back. Because waxing removes hair from the follicle, it generally lasts longer than other hair removal methods. If you get waxed regularly, your hair might thin out over time, but this isn’t a guarantee.\n\nHow do I prepare for a full body wax?\n\nOnce you’ve booked your waxing appointment, you might think, “What now?” Here’s how you can get ready and prep your skin for the smoothest wax:\n\nTwo weeks before your appointment, you should stop using skin care products with active ingredients on the areas you’re planning to wax. In particular, retinoids make your skin more sensitive to waxing. If you don’t pause retinoid use, you can significantly increase your risk of a wax burn.\n\nTwo to three days before your appointment, you should exfoliate your skin. This time frame allows any micro-tears to heal and prevents infection post-wax.\n\nThe day of your appointment, skip out on any coffee or alcohol. These can make your skin more sensitive. Also, ensure your hair is about ¼ inch long, which is the ideal hair length for waxing. If it’s too short, you should wait longer to wax. If your hair is longer, trim it down a bit.\n\nOne hour before your appointment, you should shower so you’re all clean for your esthetician. Just don’t use any products on your skin post-shower. You can also take an over-the-counter painkiller, like ibuprofen, to reduce your discomfort.\n\nDoes a full body wax include private parts?\n\nTypically, a full body wax includes a bikini or Brazilian wax. If you have a preference between a Brazilian vs. bikini wax, call your waxing salon ahead of time to confirm what your appointment includes. If you’d rather not include a bikini area wax at all, just let your esthetician know. A reputable salon will respect your boundaries and wishes.\n\nFull body wax aftercare\n\nAfter your full body wax, especially if it’s your first time, you might be a bit uncomfortable. Here are our top tips to take care of your sensitive skin after a wax:\n\nFor soreness: Try an ice pack, aloe vera, or over-the-counter painkillers\n\nFor sensitivity: Wear loose clothing\n\nFor safety: Stay out of the sun and avoid skin care or exercising for 24 to 48 hours.\n\nFor longevity: Gently exfoliate after 24 hours\n\nSome people with sensitive skin might see red dots immediately after waxing from irritation and inflammation in the hair follicles. This normally resolves itself in a day or two but might require a visit to your doctor if it persists."
