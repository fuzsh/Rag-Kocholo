        "text": "Thermometer (thermos: hot; metron: measure) is the universal instrument used to measure temperature. Temperature and heat are two words that often confuse people. For example, how do you explain the hotness of an object? What is the measure or basis for that hotness? The answer to that is temperature. Heat is a form of energy, and its unit is Joules. On the other hand, temperature is the measure of that heat. This means, if the heat is more, the temperature is more than well. But how do we measure temperature? We use a device called a thermometer to measure the temperature of any object.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTemperature & Thermometer\n\nProperties of Thermometric Liquid\n\nTypes of Thermometer\n\nClinical Thermometer\n\nHow to Read a Thermometer?\n\nLaboratory Thermometer\n\nDigital Thermometer\n\nHow to Use Digital Thermometer?\n\nInfrared Ear Thermometer\n\nHow to Use Infrared Ear Thermometer?\n\nMercury Thermometer\n\nAlcohol In Glass Thermometer\n\nConstant Pressure Gas Thermometer\n\nConstant Volume Gas Thermometer\n\nPlatinum Resistance Thermometer\n\nThermocouple Thermometer\n\nPyrometer Thermometer\n\nFrequently Asked Questions – FAQs\n\nTemperature & Thermometer\n\nBy definition, the temperature is the measurable extent of hotness or coldness. It is a mathematical representation of heat. There are different units to measure temperatures, like Celsius (˚C), Kelvin (K), and Fahrenheit (˚F).\n\nThere are different types of thermometers that are classified according to their needs. For example, there is one set of thermometers that are used to measure body temperature while another set of thermometers measure boiling point and freezing point during experiments. Here, we will discuss the two types of thermometers, namely, clinical thermometers and laboratory thermometers.\n\nProperties of Thermometric Liquid\n\nThe liquid that is used in the thermometer needs to have some properties, and they are listed below:\n\nThe liquid used should be visible.\n\nThe thermal expansion of the liquid must be uniform.\n\nThe freezing point of the liquid used must be low.\n\nTypes of Thermometer\n\nFollowing are the different types of thermometers that we use on a daily basis:\n\nClinical thermometer /medical thermometer\n\nLaboratory thermometer\n\nDigital thermometer\n\nInfrared ear thermometer\n\nMercury thermometer\n\nAlcohol in glass thermometer\n\nConstant pressure gas thermometer\n\nConstant volume thermometer\n\nPlatinum resistance thermometer\n\nThermocouple thermometer\n\nPyrometer thermometer\n\nClinical Thermometer\n\nClinical thermometers are meant for clinical purposes.\n\nIt is developed for measuring the human body temperature.\n\nIt is a long narrow glass tube with a bulb containing mercury at the end.\n\nThe normal human body temperature is 37˚C, which can fluctuate between the ranges 35˚C to 42˚C. Hence, the clinical thermometers range from 35˚C to 42˚C.\n\nThe level of mercury tells our body temperature in ˚C.\n\nSince mercury is a toxic element, thus these thermometers have been replaced by digital thermometers nowadays.\n\nNote: Clinical thermometers must be sterilized before use for a safe and clean check-up.\n\nHow to Read a Thermometer?\n\nThe thermometer is washed with water at a normal temperature.\n\nIt is given a few jerks. We notice that the jerks bring the level of mercury down. We ensure that it falls below the 37⁰C mark or the 98⁰F mark, the normal human body temperature.\n\nThe thermometer is then kept under the tongue or the arms to get the reading on the thermometer.\n\nThe thermometer is then held close to the eye, as shown in figure 3, to see the correct reading.\n\nThe temperature difference indicated between the two bigger marks is noted. Also, the number of divisions (shown by smaller marks) between these marks is noted. For e.g. the bigger mark reads 10 and the number of divisions is 5, then each division reads the value equal to 10/5 = 20\n\nWe note the value of the bigger mark that the mercury thread crossed (98 in Fig.4 Example 1). Then the number of the division of the mercury thread has crossed is noted (3 in this case). Now, this value is multiplied by the value of one division (which is 0.2 in this case). Hence, the temperature reading is 98 + (3×2) = 98.6.\n\nLaboratory Thermometer\n\nSince clinical thermometers can’t be used to measure temperature other than the human body, we need a special type of thermometers for other purposes.\n\nA laboratory thermometer, which is colloquially known as the lab thermometer, is used for measuring temperatures other than the human body temperature.\n\nIt ranges from -10˚C to 110˚C.\n\nLaboratory thermometer Uses:\n\nDesigned for lab purposes\n\nChecking the boiling point\n\nChecking freezing point\n\nChecking the temperature of other substances.\n\nChecking the temperature of a solvent but not a clinical one.\n\nWeather reporters also use maximum-minimum thermometers for measuring maximum and minimum temperatures of a place.\n\nLearn more about thermometers, heat energy, and temperature with BYJU’S engaging video lectures.\n\nDigital Thermometer\n\nThese thermometers measure the temperature through an electronic circuit.\n\nThe information captured is sent to a microchip that processes it and displayed numerically on the digital screen.\n\nThey are easy to use, inexpensive, and accurate.\n\nDigital thermometers can be considered advanced thermometers used for measuring body temperature.\n\nHow to Use Digital Thermometer?\n\nTurn on the thermometer and click till the number zero appears on the display.\n\nPlace the tip of the thermometer under the armpit.\n\nWait for a few seconds before you hear the alarm from the thermometer.\n\nRemove the thermometer and check for the temperature on the display.\n\nAfter use, clean the tip of the thermometer with cotton and alcohol.\n\nInfrared Ear Thermometer\n\nChecking the body temperature using the inside of the ear is known as tympanic membrane temperature.\n\nThis method is common when the temperature needs to be taken from the children as it is quick.\n\nAn infrared thermometer captures the temperature in the form of infrared energy given off by the heat source.\n\nHow to Use Infrared Ear Thermometer?\n\nThe tip of the thermometer should be placed inside the ear, pointing toward the nose.\n\nThe power button on the thermometer should be pressed until a signal is heard.\n\nRead the temperature value.\n\nRemove the thermometer from the ear and clean the tip with cotton and alcohol.\n\nMake sure the thermometer is not used for the ear containing a lot of wax.\n\nThermometers such as mercury thermometers, alcohol in glass thermometers, constant pressure gas thermometers, and platinum resistance thermometers are designed based on technology.\n\nWatch the video below to understand the effect of temperature on matters surrounding us\n\nMercury Thermometer\n\nThese thermometers are not used in some sectors since they can easily break.\n\nMercury is a poisonous liquid that can cause health hazards.\n\nMercury thermometers are used to provide accurate temperature readings.\n\nIt is used to measure the temperature under the arm, orally and rectally.\n\nAlcohol In Glass Thermometer\n\nThese are thermometers composed of sealed glass.\n\nAlcohol In Glass Thermometer shows the temperature by the level at which mercury or alcohol reaches a graduated scale.\n\nTemperature is indicated by the changes in liquid.\n\nAlcohol In Glass Thermometer features coloured alcohol due to the dangerous contact with mercury.\n\nConstant Pressure Gas Thermometer\n\nA constant pressure gas thermometer can function at constant pressure and volume conditions.\n\nConstant pressure gas thermometer offers highly accurate measurement and is used to adjust other thermometers.\n\nConstant Volume Gas Thermometer\n\nIn a constant volume gas thermometer, the pressure increases when the temperature increases.\n\nConstant volume gas thermometer measures temperature in the range 0k to 500 k.\n\nPlatinum Resistance Thermometer\n\nPlatinum Resistance Thermometers use a platinum wire attached to an electrical resistance to measure the temperature.\n\nGenerally, these thermometers are used to measure outside temperatures.\n\nPlatinum Resistance Thermometers are slow and offer accurate readings.\n\nThe material’s resistance in the thermometer increases when the temperature increases.\n\nPlatinum resistance thermometers measure temperature in the range of 500 k to 2300 k.\n\nThe resistance of the material in the thermometer increases when the temperature increases. Platinum resistance thermometers measure temperature in the range of 500 k to 2300 k.\n\nThermocouple Thermometer\n\nThese devices are used for the quick measurement of temperature.\n\nIt finds its application in laboratories.\n\nElectrical resistance is used in the device to generate a voltage that varies according to the connection temperature.\n\nIt also measures temperature in the range of 500 k to 2300 k.\n\nPyrometer Thermometer\n\nThe thermometer operates on Stefan’s law.\n\nThis device measures the temperature from the heat radiation emitted by the objects.\n\nThese thermometers can be used without being in contact with the objects.\n\nA pyrometer Thermometer measures a temperature greater than 2000 k.\n\nRead more about: Heat and Classification\n\nFrequently Asked Questions – FAQs\n\nQ1\n\nWhat are the properties of alcohol for thermometers?\n\nThe following are the properties of alcohol for thermometers:\n\nThe freezing point should be less than -112℃.\n\nThe boiling point should be 78℃.\n\nThe colour of the alcohol should be bright.\n\nIt should a good insulator of heat.\n\nMeasuring high temperatures should be feasible.\n\nQ2\n\nHow do you know if a thermometer is accurate?\n\nTo check if a thermometer is accurate, we need to insert the stem of the thermometer in the ice water such that the stem is at least an inch deep without touching the glass. Wait for a minute or less so that the thermometer registers the reading of the ice water. If the thermometer reading is 32℉ or 0℃, then the thermometer is said to be accurate.\n\nQ3\n\nWho is the father of thermometer?\n\nDaniel Gabriel Fahrenheit is considered to be the father of thermometers. He was a German physicist who dedicated his life to science and inventions. The modern mercury thermometer was invented by Fahrenheit. He is also credited for the invention of the mercury-in-glass thermometer.\n\nQ4\n\nWhy is mercury a good choice for thermometer?\n\nMercury is in a liquid state at room temperature and has the highest expansion coefficient. Therefore, even the slightest temperature change is notable. Also, the boiling point of the mercury makes it suitable for measuring higher temperatures. The other reason why mercury is used in thermometers is that it does not stick to the surface of the glass and has a shiny appearance.\n\nTest your knowledge on Clinical Laboratory Thermometer\n\nQ5\n\nPut your understanding of this concept to test by answering a few MCQs.
