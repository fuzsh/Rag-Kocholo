        "text": "Excited to share the cover art for the new US paperback edition of If We Were Villains. It’ll be available on the same day as Graveyard Shift: September 24 of this year. It’s been a long time in the works, but we wanted to update the original black-and-white paperback, which will be discontinued once the new version hits the shelves–with those sexy red spredges and everything. If you want one of the originals and haven’t grabbed it yet, now would be a good time! And if you’re as enamored with the new version as we are, you can pre-order it wherever you buy your books.\n\nThanks for coming on this journey with us.\n\nM\n\nChecking in with a quick update from the first stop of my eight-week conference/wedding/speaking/research tour. I’m in Chicago at the moment for the Renaissance Society of America Conference, and really looking forward to continuing the scholastic conversation at Arizona State University next month. I’ll be making a few classroom appearances as well as doing a larger event open to the public on April 17, so if you’re in the Phoenix/Tempe area I hope you’ll come out and join us. This will be a rare opportunity to hear me talk about my creative writing and my academic research in tandem. I promise, not as boring as it sounds! You can find more info here.\n\nI’ll also be making an appearance this Wednesday at the Charleston Craft & Canvas book club. If you can’t get enough of the Villains, this is a great opportunity to discuss the book with other fans of crime and mystery, and to do some collective crafting inspired by the story. Just to sweeten the deal, the organizer also happens to be the person who directed me in my first Shakespeare play when I was fourteen. It promises to be a great hang, so if you’re in or around Charleston, SC, I hope you’ll sign up. You can do that–and find more info–here.\n\nCan’t wait to meet you.\n\nM\n\nShort post today as I’m on All the Deadlines, but we’re excited to finally show you the cover art for Graveyard Shift, along with an official release date. Mark your calendars for September 24, 2024.\n\nDon’t forget you can already pre-order the book if you’re in the U.S., and pre-orders are a huge help to bookstores, publishers, and authors because they take some of the guesswork out of the printing process. If you’re outside the United States, don’t worry–we’re working on getting foreign rights all lined up, and I’ll share more information on that front as soon as I have it. If you want to stay abreast of what’s going on behind the scenes with Graveyard Shift and Hot Wax, the best place to do that is over on Substack. Our first “Road to Publication” post will be live on Tuesday.\n\nHope you love this as much as we do.\n\nM\n\nIt’s been a busy few months for Team Rio. As is always the case with publishing, there’s a strange lag between when big things happen and when they can actually be big news. I’m thrilled to finally share this with you.\n\nI wrote the first version of this book seven years ago. It’s been on a long, strange journey since then, and I’m so glad it’s found such a good home with Tim at Simon & Schuster. The next few years promise to be very busy, in a very good way. Without a great agent this never would have happened–I’m grateful for mine every day. But it also wouldn’t have happened without my readers, who have loved my first book so fiercely and made it possible for me to write more.\n\nI can’t wait to bring you along on this fresh adventure. Because most of my online writing has migrated to my Substack newsletter, this is a great time to subscribe. You’ll still see all the big news here, but if you’re interested in the publishing process and want a peek behind the scenes as Hot Wax and Graveyard Shift go to press, Substack is the place to be. I hope you’ll join me. You can subscribe right here.\n\nThank you, as always, for reading.\n\nM\n\nYesterday we got to share some great news on Publisher’s Marketplace. Now that the ink is dry, I’m excited to say that we have another book coming. In fall 2024, my first novella, Graveyard Shift, will hit the shelves.\n\nWe’ve been working on this for about six months, and I turned the first draft in to my editor last week. It’s been a delightful adventure in a new form, but I think–I hope–it will feel pleasantly familiar and refreshingly different from Villains. I’ll be sure to share cover and pre-order links as soon as we have them, and if you want to keep up with where we are in the publication process or you’re just curious what goes on behind the scenes in the book business, now’s a great time to subscribe to my newsletter on Substack. That’s where all the gory details will be.\n\nStay tuned. More news in the new year.\n\nM\n\nHard to believe 2023 is almost over, but here we are. Before we go gentle into that silent night of the holiday break, a few updates from Team Rio to close out the year:\n\nEvents: I’ll be in conversation with Olivie Blake to discuss The Atlas Complex, hosted by A Novel Idea here in Philadelphia on January 11. It’s a ticketed event (we’ll both be signing books), so if you want to be sure to get a seat, snag one soon. Details here and on the Events page.\n\nInterviews: I had a long, in-depth conversation with the On the Write Track podcast a few months back, and it’s one of the most thorough “behind-the-scenes of publishing” interviews I’ve done recently. If you’re an aspiring author, just curious about how the business works, or interested in IWWV’s long, strange journey, it’s worth an hour of your time. Listen here or find it on the Links page.\n\nNewsletter: If you’ve been seeing fewer posts here, it’s because I’m migrating most of my longer-form writing to Substack. That’s where you’ll find my thoughts on craft and the industry, plus travel updates, content recs and roundups, and opportunities to post comments and ask questions. I recently started a series on one of my favorite (and every other writer’s least favorite) subjects: revision. If you’re curious, you can read the first post here. Subscription is free, for now, and it’s the best way to stay up-to-date. Now’s a good time to subscribe, because we have some big things coming in 2024. I can’t talk about it yet, but I’m really excited to do that when the time comes.\n\nFinally, don’t forget that supply chain issues are still a thing. If you want to gift books to friends and family this year, here’s your nudge to order them now, and your reminder to be patient with booksellers. They’re under a lot of pressure. Give them the benefit of the doubt. And support small businesses and indie bookstores whenever you can.\n\nMore soon.\n\nM\n\nA few quick updates as we approach the end of September. Firstly, the In These Hallowed Halls anthology is finally out in the world. You can buy it from many bookstores, or find your preferred online retailer here. To help celebrate the release, I signed stock of both Villains and the anthology at eight different bookstores in New York City this past week. You can find a list of them on this thread on the platform formerly known as Twitter.\n\nFinally, I’m delighted to announce that I’ll be helping kick off Spooky Season at one of my favorite indie bookstores. I hope you’ll join us at the Book & Cover (Chattanooga, TN) on October 2 at 7pm. Please note this is a ticketed event and tickets are going fast, so grab yours before they’re gone.\n\nHope to see you soon.\n\nM\n\nHello, lovely readers. This is a short post to introduce you to a new writing venture of mine. If you’re at all “online” you’ve probably heard other writers talk about Substack, and I am officially jumping on the bandwagon. You can read a little more about why in my first post, and I hope you’ll consider subscribing.\n\nWhat’s the difference between Discursions and this old-fashioned website? Basically, it’s two different kinds of content. If you’re already on the mailing list here, you’ll get updates and announcements about events, interviews, new writing, etc. Substack is a little more casual; it’s where you’ll see longer posts on craft and industry, and more regular on-the-ground updates about where I am in the world and what I’m up to. It won’t be too overwhelming, probably a post a week, maybe two. I hope you’ll consider joining me on this little adventure.\n\nThanks, as always, for reading.\n\nM"
