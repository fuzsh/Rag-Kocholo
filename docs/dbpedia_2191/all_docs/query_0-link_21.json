        "text": "Date: January 2024\n\nIn a notable development in the book publishing industry, Simon & Schuster has acquired North American rights to two new novels by author M.L. Rio, known for her bestselling novel “If We Were Villains”. This acquisition includes the novel “Hot Wax”, which is set for tentative release in spring 2025.\n\nHot Wax, is about “a young girl who discovers the joys and dangers of life on tour with her father’s band” and the “cross-country journey she takes decades later to flee the claustrophobic reality of her present, only to encounter the very kind of violence she thought she had buried in the past.”\n\nThe details of “Hot Wax” and the second novel included in the deal have not been extensively disclosed. However, the acquisition signals Simon & Schuster’s ongoing commitment to bringing diverse and engaging stories to the literary market.\n\nM.L. Rio has previously garnered attention and acclaim for “If We Were Villains”, a novel centered around a group of Shakespearean actors entangled in a web of intrigue and mystery. Her work is known for its intricate storytelling and depth of character development.\n\nThe acquisition of Rio’s upcoming novels, including “Hot Wax”, by Simon & Schuster is a significant addition to the publisher’s catalog. Simon & Schuster is a global leader in general interest publishing, dedicated to providing a wide range of quality fiction and nonfiction titles to readers.\n\nAs the publishing date for “Hot Wax” approaches, further details about the novel’s plot and themes are expected to be revealed. The literary community and Rio’s readership eagerly anticipate the new works, expecting the same level of engagement and craft that Rio has previously demonstrated."
