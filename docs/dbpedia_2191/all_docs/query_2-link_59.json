        "text": "Waxing. Everyone who hears the word has a different reaction. While some cannot fathom doing it, many others wax religiously, appreciating the ability to quickly remove unwanted hair.\n\nToday, people wax just about every area of their bodies. Facial waxing includes lips, eyebrows, and chin. Some people even wax their entire face! Others wax their arms or legs. And, as we move into summer, bikini waxing and Brazilian waxing become more and more popular.\n\nHard Wax Versus Soft Wax\n\nWhile many people still visit spas and salons for their waxing needs, others are managing the process themselves, in the privacy of their own homes. But, they do have questions. One of the most frequently asked is “is hard wax or soft wax better for a Brazilian?”\n\nAs you likely know, Brazilian waxing is a process that removes virtually all your pubic hair. It provides a clean look for many bathing suits, including thong bikinis. You are also probably aware of the sensitivity of that area of your body. The type of wax you use for your Brazilian can truly make a difference.\n\nHard wax, sometimes referred to as stripless wax, requires a thicker application. After applying it to the skin, it hardens relatively quickly but remains pliable. You don’t need to use any type of strips to remove it because it melts at a low temperature; it tends to be comfortable during the application process.\n\nSoft wax, on the other hand, has a low melting point.. Its consistency is “looser” and strips are required in the removal process.\n\nMost people agree that for a Brazilian wax, hard wax is the best option. If your hair is coarse, multiple applications will be necessary, and hard wax allows for this. Additionally, because this area of your body is so sensitive, hard wax removal tends to be less painful. While you need to warm the wax before application, this product tends to be the best choice.\n\nWhile most believe that hard wax is the best choice for your Brazilian wax, there will always be those who prefer soft wax. Keep in mind that for some people, in some cases, soft wax is a good option. It simply depends upon your body, the process, and the experience level of your waxer.\n\nIf you have questions about the best wax to use at home, the experts at Nacach wax can also help. And, if you are visiting a salon for your waxing needs, speak to your esthetician and ask him or her to share why they choose specific products."
