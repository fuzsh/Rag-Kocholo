        "text": "Can I wax my legs or bikini line etc while I'm pregnant?\n\nIf waxing is your hair removal method of choice, then you’re fine to keep going as normal during pregnancy. Hormone changes and extra blood flowing to you skin (especially your pubic area) can make you more sensitive to pain though (Nussbaum and Benedetto, 2006). So just be aware that it might make you wince a bit more than it usually does.\n\nIt’s also good to know that lots of pregnant women get excessive hair growth, especially in early pregnancy. Hair growth is usually more pronounced around your upper lip, chin, cheeks and more generally (Nussbaum and Benedetto, 2006). So you’re not alone in this.\n\nLet your beauty therapist know that you’re pregnant and be aware that they might opt not to not wax you in your first trimester. Just be careful too that the beauty salon has clean equipment and does not reuse wax as this could put you at risk of bacterial infections (Healthline, 2015). If you’re waxing yourself at home, make sure you do a patch test first (Healthline, 2015).\n\nIs hair removal cream safe during pregnancy?\n\nAgain, it’s a yes – but with a caveat. The ingredients in hair removal creams are fine during pregnancy (Bozzo et al, 2011). What you may find though is that your skin is more sensitive or that the smell makes you nauseous. That’s because your sense of smell is stronger in pregnancy. Open lots of windows and you should be fine.\n\nCan I dye or bleach my hair when pregnant?\n\nYou're still ok to get that appointment booked. Going for your usual colour at the hairdressers is not thought to be a problem when you’re pregnant, although highlights are a better option than a full colour as the chemicals don’t touch your scalp (NHS, 2018).\n\nYou’re very unlikely to absorb the chemicals in hair dyes and for them to reach your unborn baby through the placenta unless you have burns or abscesses on your scalp (Chau-Gocheco et al, 2008). You might in any case want to wait until after your first trimester when the risk of any dangers is a lot lower.\n\nIf you’re colouring your hair at home, the same applies but you should also:\n\nwear gloves\n\nleave dye on for minimum time\n\nopen the windows\n\nrinse your scalp once you’ve put the dye on.\n\n(Chau-Gocheco et al, 2008; NHS, 2018)\n\nCan I use fake tan, spray tanning or a sunbed when pregnant?\n\nYou’re fine to slap on the fake tan during pregnancy (Bozzo et al, 2011). But nobody yet knows for sure whether spray tans are safe, as inhaling the spray might cause harm (NHS, 2018b).\n\nThere’s no clear evidence that sunbeds are unsafe during pregnancy. But your skin is extra sensitive when you’re expecting a baby and can burn more easily too. That means sunbeds’ high UV rays can be dangerous (NHS, 2018c).\n\nSunbeds can also make you and your baby overheat (NHS, 2018c). So all in all it’s probably a good idea to switch to the bottle if you want a fake tan until your baby’s born.\n\nAnd remember, tanning pills are banned in the UK and aren’t safe for anyone let alone an unborn baby (NHS, 2018b).\n\nIs it safe to have a massage while pregnant?\n\nIf you like massages, this can be a wonderful and relaxing treat during your pregnancy. Find a therapist that has pregnancy massage training and experience. Call ahead and find out if they offer massages for mums-to-be.\n\nDuring your massage, you will either get a cut-out to rest your bump in or be massaged sitting up, lying on your side or semi-reclining. For more information about pregnancy massages and the oils and positions it's safe to use, see our article about pampering in pregnancy.\n\nWhile you’re there, you could ask for some tips for massage in labour. Some women find it really helpful in the early stages.\n\nCan I go to a nail salon, get gel nails or use nail polish when pregnant?\n\nYes, but there are a few things to bear in mind. First, the fumes in a nail salon might make you feel sick in your first trimester, so it’s probably better to wait until later down the line. Plus, those fumes might contain organic solvents, which have been linked with birth defects in babies of mothers exposed during pregnancy (Khattak et al, 1999).\n\nSecond, if you’re getting gel nails, check whether the chemical methyl methacrylate monomer (MMA) is used, as this should be avoided (whether pregnant or not) (HSE, 2008). There is also no evidence about whether acetone – used to remove gel/ acrylic nails – is safe during pregnancy (ATSDR, 1994). So it’s best to follow some guidelines:\n\nTry and avoid gel nails as much as possible, painting your own at home instead or getting a standard manicure.\n\nAsk nail technicians not to leave the acetone on for any longer than needed.\n\nIf you’re taking nails off yourself, use cotton pads soaked in acetone instead of dunking your hands in a bowl full of the stuff.\n\nGive your hands a thorough wash afterwards to make sure all the chemicals have gone.\n\nMake sure the salon has doors or windows open when your nails are being taken off.\n\n(Healthline, 2016)\n\nThis page was last reviewed in October 2018.\n\nFurther information\n\nOur support line offers practical and emotional support with feeding your baby and general enquiries for parents, members and volunteers: 0300 330 0700.\n\nWe also offer antenatal courses which are a great way to find out more about birth, labour and life with a new baby."
