        "text": "A favorite of many crafters, you need to learn how to clean beeswax before using it . This may sound difficult-but it really is not. There are several popular methods used to clean raw beeswax. In this guide, I will share my favorite ways to get raw beeswax ready to use.\n\nBeeswax is dirty? Well, perhaps not necessarily dirt in the way we imagine ‚Äì but it can have dirt. Beekeepers often ‚Äúclean or render beeswax‚Äù to remove debris and impurities. Once clean and ready, the ways to use beeswax are endless.\n\nCleaning Beeswax Safely\n\nUnless you purchase beeswax bars or pellets that are clean and ready to use, you need to go through the cleaning process.\n\nTo clean your beeswax it must be melted, this is easy to do because this beeswax has a melting point of about 147¬∞F. However, it is flammable and will ignite if over heated.\n\nRegardless of the method you use, you must be vigilant to avoid fire or burns. Be careful. Protect surfaces with newspaper or plastic drop cloths. Never leave melting wax unattended.\n\nPeople can and do use a microwave to melt beeswax but I do not recommend it. The opportunity for overheating, fire or a very big mess is too great.\n\nLikewise, it is safer to use a heat source without an open flame. An electric burner is a bit safer than a gas stove with open flames.\n\nRaw Beeswax Rendering (for Beekeepers)\n\nRendering wax is just another term for cleaning. It means the same thing and is an older beekeeping term that has been around a long time.\n\nThe process removes some of the honey, wood splinters, propolis, pollen, or bee cocoons left behind. These impurities make the wax unsuitable for some projects.\n\ncollect excess beeswax ‚Äì (cappings or crushed comb)\n\ndrain any good honey from the wax ‚Äì cappings hold a lot\n\nrinse beeswax in cool clean water ‚Äì not your kitchen sink!\n\nmelt the wax ‚Äì I use water to clean\n\npour hot wax through a filter bag (such as nylon curtain pieces or cheesecloth or sweatshirt material\n\nleave your clean wax to cool in some type of flexible container\n\nRemove Cappings\n\nBeekeepers often use an electric hot knife (or a cold knife warmed in hot water) to slice the wax cap off the frame of honey. If you only have a couple of boxes to harvest, it‚Äôs fun. Once you have 10 or more boxes, it‚Äôs work!\n\nSeparating Beeswax from Honey\n\nFresh cappings are sticky. The amount of honey in the cappings can be quite significant and worth saving. There are 2 common methods of separating the wax and honey.\n\nuncapping tank or double bucket system\n\nuse a honey filter bag\n\nDouble Bucket System\n\nI often use a 2 bucket process to separate my beeswax from honey. You can purchase a commercial uncapping tank that does the same thing or make your own.\n\nA tall 5 gallon bucket is the base. A slightly shorter bucket close to the same diameter is placed inside the large bucket.\n\nBecause of the top rims of both buckets, this usually results in a space of several inches being open in the bottom of the larger bucket. This is the collection space for honey.\n\nThe smaller bucket has many holes drilled in the bottom. Cut cappings (or crushed comb) are collected and placed in top bucket with holes. Any remaining honey drips down into a clean chamber.\n\nLeft to drain overnight ‚Äì most of the honey drips through into the bottom container. Of course, this is done inside my honey house where no bees can get in.\n\nUse a Filter Bag\n\nIf you don‚Äôt have 2 buckets of the proper size, you can use a filter bag (or strainer bag) to hold the wet cappings.\n\nWhen using a strainer bag, place the cappings in the bag. You can buy honey strainer bags, use paint bags or make your own with cheese cloth.\n\nSuspend it over a clean bucket that will catch the residual honey. This clean honey can be used as long as you practice good hygiene .\n\nWarning ‚Äì the bag will be heavy! Tie the bag to something sturdy enough to handle the weight. This must be done in a warm, bee tight location.\n\nWith either method, most of the honey will be drained out by the next day. The time needed will depend on the amount of honey remaining in your wax and the temperature of the room.\n\nWash the Cappings\n\nAfter most of the residual honey has dripped out, the cappings are still sticky. As part of my cleanup regime, I like to rinse the stickiness out of the cappings wax.\n\nLarge strainer bags with a coarse mesh are very useful for washing cappings as it holds them together.\n\nOnly use cool clear water. It is as simple as placing your cappings in a bucket and adding water ( similar to washing green beans). üôÇ\n\nPlace a clean strainer bag in a 5 gallon pail ‚Äì then add wax. Fill 3/4 of the bucket with cool water and hand wash the wax .\n\nWhen you think you have most of the honey out, grab the top of the filter bag and lift ‚Äì allowing the water to drain out of the clean wax cappings.\n\nAnd for heavens sake don‚Äôt wash them in your kitchen sink! How do you spell clogged drain? One way is B-E-E-S-W-A-X.\n\nLetting Your Bees Clean Your Wax\n\nThe practice of letting the bees clean the cappings in the open is practiced by some beekeepers. They spread the cappings out on a flat surface outside and let the bees find and clean them.\n\nThe value of this method is that the bees are making use of every bit of honey. Also, it is frightening and fascinating to watch. However, this plan is not without serious risks to your bees.\n\nThere is a danger of this activity causing honey bee robbing attacks back at the hive ‚Äì even if the cleaning takes place a far distance away.\n\nI never put out wet cappings for cleaning. If you choose to do so, be sure to place the wet cappings as far away from your bee yard as possible.\n\nMethods for Cleaning Beeswax (for Crafters)\n\nPerhaps the wax you have looks clean and it may be ready to use. However, there are several easy methods for cleaning beeswax that can ensure it is ready to use for any project.\n\nOne of the most popular ways to use beeswax involves making candles. Candles require clean beeswax. Even the simplest DIY beeswax candle will not burn well if the wax contains impurities.\n\nWater Bath Method\n\nThe water bath method is one of the simplest ways to clean beeswax. It helps remove impurities such as honey trapped in the wax.\n\nThis method involves melting beeswax directly in water. It allows impurities to separate from the wax and sink to the bottom.\n\nEquipment Needed\n\nuncleaned beeswax\n\nlarge pot (dedicated for wax)\n\nwater\n\nheat source\n\nStep by Step Instructions\n\nIn a large pot (dedicated to be your wax melting pot), add a few cups of water. Place beeswax cappings or small pieces of wax directly into the water.\n\nTurn the heat source on low to low-medium heat. Maintain a steady controlled temperature ‚Äì the water should not boil.\n\nAs the wax slowly melts, occasionally stir with a wooden skewer, etc. When the wax is completely melted, remove the pot from heat source and allow to cool.\n\nOnce cool, you should have a cleaner block of wax. You can discard the dirty water.\n\nFiltering & Straining Double Boiler Method\n\nThis is a versatile method of processing beeswax that is often used to remove debris. It involves using a strainer (cheesecloth) to separate clean molten beeswax from any unwanted particles.\n\nA double boiler is the safest method for melting beeswax. One pot sitting on the stove container water. A smaller pot sits inside and holds your wax.\n\nThis allows the heat to be transferred from the water to spread uniformly around the pot holding your wax. You have less chance of over heating the wax or causing a fire!\n\nIf you don‚Äôt have a double boiler, one of these inserts can help you create one. I have several of these- they are awesome for projects.\n\nEquipment Needed\n\nunclean beeswax\n\ndouble boiler or similar\n\nstrainer or cheesecloth\n\nheat source\n\nflexible heat resistant container\n\nStep by Step Instructions\n\nSet up your double boiler. Fill the larger pot with water and place the smaller pot inside. Add raw beeswax to the smaller melting pot.\n\nGradually heat the water which will melt the beeswax. It should melt slowly, avoid high temperatures. Gently stir the wax as it melts to promote even heating.\n\nOnce the wax is liquid, carefully pour it through a straining material. Use cheese cloth, nylons, paint strainers or old sweatshirt material for straining.\n\nIf you quickly wipe out the warming pot with paper towels ‚Äì it will remove most of the wax. But, you need to have dedicated utensils, dishes or pots for wax work.\n\nUsing a Crockpot\n\nUsing a crockpot to render raw beeswax is a convenient and (mostly) hands-off method. It allows you to slowly melt the wax at a steady and controlled temperature. This method works well when you have a larger quantity of wax to process.\n\nEquipment Needed\n\nuncleaned wax\n\ncrockpot (slow-cooker) with adjustable temperature\n\nstrainer or cheesecloth\n\nflexible container for collecting clean wax\n\nPlace the crockpot on a flat, heat-resistant surface. Sometimes you can find a used one at a thrift store that can be dedicated to wax cleaning. Another option, use disposable crockpot liners to make cleanup after a breeze.\n\nSet the temperature setting on the crockpot to ‚Äúwarm‚Äù or the lowest temperature setting. This provides slow even heating and protects the natural properties of your beeswax.\n\nPlace the lid on the crockpot and allow several hours for the wax to melt. The time required depends on room temperature, crockpot setting and the amount of wax in the pot.\n\nOccasionally, stir the melting wax to release impurities and promote even heating.\n\nOnce all of the beeswax is melted, turn off the crockpot. Place a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth over a clean contain. Carefully, pour the molten wax through it. Be careful ‚Äì hot wax can burn you.\n\nLet the hot wax cool and solidify in the clean container. Once cool and solid, it is ready to use for your favorite projects.\n\nHow to Clean Wax in a Solar Melter\n\nMelting beeswax in a solar melter is another option (especially for beekeepers with a lot of raw wax).\n\nMy larger solar wax melter is made from an old steel box with a heavy piece of glass on top. It is really ugly and looks gross but it does the job well.\n\nFresh wax cappings are placed into a pan inside the box, a tray with a small amount of water collects the dripping wax. Over a couple of days the heat of the sun will melt all the cappings.\n\nAs temperatures drop, the wax will cool into solid form in the tray. Once cooled, I can remove the solid chunk and discard any water.\n\nThe water will be dirty and have honey residue ‚Äì do NOT feed it to your bees. It may make them sick.\n\nIf you only have a small amount of cappings, you may choose to use a home-made melter. You can make your own solar melter using an inexpensive Styrofoam cooler and a sheet of glass.\n\nThe melter is set in a sunny location. At the end of the day, you will have rendered clean beeswax. If you want to a larger solar melter, you can find many plans and instructions to build one.\n\nExpert Tips\n\nRaw beeswax is often sold in larger cakes or a wax disc, luckily wax is brittle when cold ‚Äì you should be able to hit it with a hammer and break off chunks.\n\nIt is important to remember that you do not want to overheat your beeswax. Too much heat will reduce the nice aroma and darken the color.\n\nBeeswax is flammable. At a temperature of about 400¬∞ F, it will flare and burn. **Be careful ‚Äì always take proper precautions to prevent burns and fire**\n\nYou can pour your liquid wax into any type of mold. I like to use recycled takeout cups because when the wax cools and shrinks, it pops out easily.\n\nCooled wax will NOT easily come out of any type of container use something that is flexible. Leave your wax to cool and harden over night.\n\nThere is no need to bring it to a boil. The wax has a low melting point that is well below 200¬∞F.\n\nStoring Beeswax & Endless Possibilities\n\nBeeswax does not require any special storage procedure. It keeps virtually forever. Place it in a box to protect it from dust and it will be ready for any special projects when you need it.\n\nWhat will you do with it? There are so many options, create unique and beautiful beeswax candles with dried flowers.\n\nOnce the wax is clean, it is good for making beeswax candles, creating a special batch of homemade beeswax lip balm, beeswax furniture polish and many other crafts.\n\nNeed to freshen up a room with a natural air freshener? Try making your own bees wax melts. You can customize their scent with different fragrances.\n\nYou can even make your own beeswax crayons ‚Äì a great non toxic item for the kids.\n\nFAQs\n\nFinal Thoughts"
