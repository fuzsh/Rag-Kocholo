        "text": "Name: Dancing Girl\n\nWhat it is: An ancient bronze sculpture\n\nWhere it is from: Mohenjo-daro, an archaeological site in Pakistan\n\nWhen it was made: 2500 B.C.\n\nRelated: Panathenaic prize amphora: A pot brimming with olive oil awarded at the ancient Greek Olympics\n\nWhat it tells us about the past:\n\nDespite its small stature, this 4.1-inch-tall (10.5 centimeters) solid-bronze sculpture of a girl speaks volumes about the ancient culture credited with its creation.\n\nArchaeologists discovered the artifact in 1926 while conducting archaeological excavations in a region of Pakistan that was once inhabited by the Indus Valley Civilization, a Bronze Age culture known for its art, especially metalwork, according to the Indian Ministry of Culture.\n\nTo make the sculpture, a craftsperson would have used a technique known as lost-wax casting, in which they poured hot wax into a mold to create a model. The wax is then melted out, forming a cavity for the metal to pool. The model was then covered in clay and heated in an oven. Once the mold cooled, the clay was chipped away, revealing a bronze sculpture of a girl, her hand confidently placed on her hip and her head tilted slightly backward. The girl wears her hair in a bun and is nude, save for a necklace and dual stacks of bangles worn on each arm.\n\n\"She's about fifteen years old I should think, not more, but she stands there with bangles all the way up her arm and nothing else on,\" British archaeologist Mortimer Wheeler said in 1973. \"A girl perfectly, for the moment, perfectly confident of herself and the world. There's nothing like her, I think, in the world.\"\n\nThe sculpture is on display at the National Museum in New Delhi."
