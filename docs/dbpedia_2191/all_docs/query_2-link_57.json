        "text": "Our Pure Hot Wax is washable sugar wax. Read: it’s all organic and just made of water, the best raw sugar, and lemon juice. The formulation is gentle, safe, and easy on all sorts of hair. No bumps and irritation. Ever.\n\nAnd it gives really, really, long-lasting results that so many (many) of our customers love. Continued upkeep with Honeybee pure hot wax also gives sparser hair growth because it ousts hair from the roots.\n\nStep 1\n\nCheck the consistency of the Pure Hot Wax. It should look like honey, but still be thick enough to remain on the spatula.\n\nStep 2\n\nSpread it on the chosen area in a thin, even layer. Place a wax strip on top, and with firm pressure, run your hand down the length (and in the direction of hair growth) to ensure the wax adheres to the hair.\n\nStep 3\n\nWith a flick of your hand, remove the strip in a quick movement. Make sure it’s against the direction opposite to hair growth and the strip remains parallel to the skin.\n\nStep 4\n\nContinue waxing by repeating steps 2 and 3 till you have hair-free skin on all body areas.\n\nStep 5\n\nFinish by cleaning any residual wax with water or a wet cloth.\n\nBEE BETTER AT SILKIER, SMOOTHER WAXING\n\nWhen not to wax: skin is broken, inflamed, or sunburned.\n\nWhen to wax to prevent breakage: the hair has grown to ¼ of an inch.\n\nHow to warm wax: in a wax warmer or by submerging the Pure Hot Wax tin in hot water for 20 minutes. Stir sporadically to get the consistency right.\n\nWhat to do before waxing: patch test for optimal temperature and put on some Honeybee Tunes."
