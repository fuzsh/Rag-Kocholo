        "text": "The Hot Wax is also called as Non Strip and is one of the most popular products in waxing. Here you can learn more about the Hot Wax.\n\nThe \"Non Strip\" category was started by Perron Rigot™ when they created and patented the world's first non-strip wax. Perron Rigot hot waxes are popular with professionals around the world for a reason! We explain what makes Hot Wax so special.\n\nWhat is Hot Wax\n\nHot Wax is a bead wax\n\nThere are 3 different consistencies. Creamy - Semi-creamy - Fluid\n\nNo time to wait, the product dries through quickly\n\nIdeal for smaller sensitive areas, but can also be used on the entire body\n\nThin in application yet flexible = no cracking or breaking off because patented \"elastomer\" technology\n\nCan be applied directly from the heater, because of the low melting point of 37 degrees\n\nTip: In our blog post 7 good reasons for Hot Wax by Perron Rigot™ you will learn about the special features of Hot Wax and why it is different from other brands.\n\nApplication Hot Wax\n\nFirst, the Hot Wax is filled into an empty tin* and then the full tin can placed in the heater. Are the beads are completely melted, the Hot Wax has the right consistency. You can apply the products directly from the heater to the skin because of the low melting point of 37 degrees.\n\n*IMPORTANT: Please, never put the beads directly into the heater. It could happen that this will damage the inside of the heater. Hot Wax should always be placed in a separate tin.\n\nINFO: Here you can find out for which areas the particular Hot Wax products are used.\n\nHow to apply Hot Wax\n\nRemove the amount of wax needed for the area from the heater, using a spatula. Place the wax where you want to start applying it and spread it with even pressure in the direction of hair growth. For large areas, the long edge of the spatula should be perpendicular to the skin. For uneven areas, apply the wax with the rounded end of the spatula. The edges of the wax should be a little thicker after application. This makes it easier to remove\n\nHow long does Hot Wax keep on the skin and how is Hot Wax removed\n\nLet the wax dry for a few seconds. Touch the surface to check whether the wax has already hardened. If it sticks in some places, wait a short while longer. Grab the wax at the slightly thicker edge and pull it off against the direction of hair growth in 1 or 2 steps, depending on the treated area. Pull the wax off as close to the skin surface as possible and stretch the surrounding skin area while doing so. Do not pull upwards! Calm the skin immediately after waxing with light hand pressure\n\nHow often can you wax over the skin\n\nIf you were not able to completely remove the hair from some areas in the first session, then you can wax over the area a second time without any hesitation. You can cleanse the particular area again with Purifying Blue Lotion and wet the skin with Pre & Post Depilatory Jasmine Oil to protect the skin barrier before waxing. You should have removed all hair in the second pass if possible.\n\nWould you like to know more about Perron Rigot?\n\nAt Insight Cosmetics Group, a variety of contact and training opportunities are available to you.\n\nJoin the FREE Online Come on Over Class\n\nWhy not simply book a consultation appointment with one of our waxing experts?\n\nDiscover the free e-learning app and take part in one of the exciting Perron Rigot™ e-learning trainings\n\nTake a look at the training courses we offer.
