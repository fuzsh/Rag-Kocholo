        "text": "Paraffin wax is a colorless, soft wax that can provide therapeutic heat therapy for the hands and feet. It also has softening and moisturizing effects on the skin.\n\nAs with other waxes, paraffin wax melts when it is heated. It has a low melting point, so it is safe to touch in its liquid form. This means that people can submerge their hands or feet in the wax for potential therapeutic benefits.\n\nThis article will look at paraffin wax, its benefits, risks, and how to use it.\n\nParaffin wax is a by-product of heating or distilling petroleum, also known as crude oil. It is a solid waxy substance that companies often use to make candles.\n\nParaffin wax also has other uses, such as a stiffening agent in ointments or an anti-inflammatory cream for the skin.\n\nPeople often use it to relieve the symptoms of arthritis, and some spas use it as a therapeutic treatment.\n\nParaffin wax is also a mineral oil and an ingredient in many skin creams, lotions, and gels.\n\nFind out more about the risks and benefits of mineral oils in skin care products.\n\nParaffin wax has some potential therapeutic uses. Some salons and spas use it as a skin-softening treatment or pain relief for sore joints and muscles.\n\nThe two main benefits of paraffin wax are its moisturizing or skin-softening properties and its use in heat therapy.\n\nMoisturizing\n\nSpas and salons often use paraffin wax in skin-softening treatments to moisturize the hands, feet, and cuticles. Paraffin is an occlusive moisturizer, which means it forms a physical barrier on the skin to prevent water loss. This can make a person’s skin feel supple and soft.\n\nOcclusive agents such as paraffin wax can also help relieve symptoms of dry skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis. However, occlusive moisturizers may cause the skin to feel greasy. The thick barrier on the skin could also lead to clogged pores and acne.\n\nHeat therapy\n\nA person can use paraffin wax as a form of heat therapy for their hands or feet.\n\nTo use it for heat therapy, a person can melt the wax, test the temperature, and dip their hands or feet in it. This may help relieve stiff muscles and joints by improving circulation and increasing blood flow to the area.\n\nPeople with different forms of arthritis may find that this form of heat therapy helps alleviate pain, stiffness, and swelling, as well as helping to improve mobility and flexibility.\n\nSalons and spas may offer paraffin wax treatments, but people can also use the treatment at home.\n\nThe treatments at home and in a spa are likely very similar. When using wax at home, a person should use caution when heating the wax and follow all instructions on the kit.\n\nTo perform a paraffin wax treatment at home, a person should follow these steps:\n\nWash hands with soap and water.\n\nApply a lotion or moisturizer to the hands.\n\nTest the temperature of the wax by dipping a fingertip in gently.\n\nSpread the fingers and dip the hand into the wax. Remove when coated.\n\nRepeat this, dipping and drying the hand about 6–8 times.\n\nCover the hand with a towel or plastic bag immediately. Keep it covered for 15–20 minutes.\n\nRemove the towel.\n\nCarefully peel the cooled wax from the hand.\n\nRepeat steps with the other hand.\n\nAlthough paraffin wax may benefit the skin and joints, there are safety risks involved with using it.\n\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), paraffin wax is highly flammable, and inhaling its fumes can cause significant irritation. For this reason, an inexperienced person should avoid using it at home.\n\nTo avoid fire hazards and toxic fumes, a person should never heat the wax over an open flame. One way to melt the wax gently is to put it in a bowl over a pot of hot water.\n\nA person should also be wary of the temperature of the wax before they put their hands or feet in it, as hot wax can cause burns. The temperature should be comfortable to touch and should not be more than 125°F (51.7°C).\n\nPeople with sensitive skin should also be careful while using paraffin wax, as it could cause a reaction. A person should always do a patch test before using any new product on the skin.\n\nTo do a patch test, a person should put a small amount of paraffin wax onto a small area of skin and leave it for 24 hours. If any reaction occurs, a person should refrain from using the product.\n\nThe safest way to use paraffin wax is to go to a professional spa or salon. If a person uses it at home, they should follow the above safety guidelines.\n\nFind out more about patch testing for skin care products.\n\nExperts generally consider paraffin wax to be safe and effective when used in a spa or at home in the form of moisturizers or heat therapy.\n\nHowever, a person should avoid using paraffin wax if they have:\n\nany open cuts, wounds, or burns\n\nissues with sensation in their hands or feet\n\na sensitivity to any chemicals\n\nSomeone with a chemical sensitivity may experience a rash, swelling, or breakouts if they use paraffin wax as it is a petroleum product.\n\nPeople with poor circulation or a history of numbness in their hands should not use paraffin wax, as they may not feel the temperature accurately. This could lead to heat damage on the skin."
