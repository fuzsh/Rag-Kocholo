        "text": "QUICK HUMPS RECOMMENDED FOR USE AT SLIGHTLY HIGHER TEMPERATURES\n\nREVISED SINGLE WAX APPLICATION TEMPERATURE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QUICK HUMPS NOW ALLOW FOR ADDED STICKINESS AND SOFTNESS WHEN QUICK HUMPS IS USED AT THESE HIGHER TEMPERATURES. THE QUICK HUMP FORMULAS HAVE NOT BEEN CHANGED. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE COLOR OF THE QUICK HUMPS LABEL AND EACH FORMULA REMAINS THE SAME.\n\nSINGLE WAX OR BASECOAT/TOPCOAT?\n\nWHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HARD & SOFT WAX?\n\nSofter waxes will be:\n\nStickier\n\nEasier to apply\n\nMore likely to move or rub away at pressure points on your board\n\nHarder waxes will be:\n\nLess sticky\n\nSomewhat more difficult to apply\n\nMore likely to stay in place and not rub off\n\nWHAT SHOULD A GOOD SURF WAX PROVIDE?\n\nModerate to high levels of stickiness\n\nStability Underfoot\n\nWHAT IS A SINGLE WAX APPLICATION?\n\nA Single Wax Application is where only one formula of wax is used at a time.\n\nWHAT ARE THE SHORTCOMINGS OF A SINGLE WAX APPLICATION?\n\nIncreased Stickiness requires a softer wax which in turn will reduce Stability Under Foot.\n\nSHOULD I CONTINUE USING JUST A SINGLE WAX APPLICATION?\n\nIf Single Wax levels of stickiness and stability are adequate for your needs then there is no reason for you to switch to Basecoat/Topcoat combinations.\n\nWHEN SHOULD I USE A BASECOAT/TOPCOAT COMBINATION?\n\nWhen you want to increase the stickiness you get with your single wax application without sacrificing stability.\n\nHOW DO BASECOAT & TOPCOAT COMBINATIONS WORK?\n\nA harder Basecoat formula provides Stability Under Foot with a long lasting surface texture that can hold the softer Topcoat wax in place and prevent it from moving or rubbing away at strategic points on the deck of your surfboard.\n\nOnce you have a firm Basecoat, your Topcoat wax can be much softer and stickier than anything you could use without a Basecoat.\n\nWHAT ARE THE RULES FOR BASECOAT/TOPCOAT COMBINATIONS?\n\nA Basecoat must be sufficiently hard to remain stable at the current water temperature.\n\nYou can use anything you want as a Topcoat wax as long as it is softer than your Basecoat wax.\n\nUSING QUICK HUMPS FOR SINGLE WAX APPLICATIONS\n\nThe recommended temperature range for a Single Wax Application is printed on the front of each Quick Humps label.\n\nEach Quick Humps label has its own \"X-NUMBER\" which indicates the relative hardness and stickiness of the six different formulas. The \"1X\" formula is the softest and stickiest Quick Humps Formula and the \"6X\" formula is the hardest and least sticky formula.\n\nWhen recommended temperatures for two or more Quick Humps formulas overlap, use the \"X-NUMBERS\" to determine your preference.\n\nLOOK AT THE QUICK HUMPS LABEL\n\n1-X\n\nExtreme Soft\n\nX-Cold to Cold\n\n2-X\n\nExtra Soft\n\nX-Cold to Cold\n\n3-X\n\nSoft\n\nCool to Mid-Warm\n\n4-X\n\nFirm\n\nMid-Cool to Warm\n\n5-X\n\nHard\n\nWarm to Mid-Tropical\n\n6-X\n\nExtra Hard\n\nTropical\n\nOR USE THE SINGLE WAX APPLICATION GUIDE\n\nCHOOSING A BASECOAT/TOPCOAT COMBINATION\n\nUSE QUICK HUMPS AS A BASECOAT WITH A DREAM CREAM OR QUICK HUMPS TOPCOAT FOR INCREASED LEVELS OF BOTH STICKINESS AND STABILITY.\n\nUSING A HARDER WAX FOR YOUR BASECOAT WILL TAKE MORE EFFORT BUT YOUR BASECOAT WILL BE MORE EFFECTIVE AND LAST LONGER.\n\nIF INCREASING TEMPERATURES WILL SOON BE REALIZED DUE TO SEASONAL CHANGE OR TRAVEL THEN MAKE SURE YOUR BASECOAT IS HARD ENOUGH FOR THE WARMEST CONDITIONS THAT WILL BE ENCOUNTERED.\n\nBASECOAT / TOPCOAT COMBINATIONS"
