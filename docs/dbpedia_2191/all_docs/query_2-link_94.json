        "text": "Peppers (Capsicum annuum) are long-season, heat-loving annuals in the Solanaceae family which includes eggplants, tomatoes, tomatillos, potatoes and ground cherries.\n\nBells- Oblong lobed fruit that is sweet and red or yellow when ripe, also eaten in the immature green stage.\n\nSpecialty – Long tapering fruits are especially flavorful and sweet, often used as frying peppers but also excellent for fresh eating.\n\nHot – Small spicy fruits often have thin walls that make for easy drying. Hot peppers can be used fresh or dried and ground.\n\nSoil Nutrients and Requirements\n\nPeppers prefer light, well drained, moderately fertile soil with pH 6.5-6.8. Use a high phosphorus starter fertilizer when transplanting to give young peppers a good start. Keep nitrogen levels in moderation, as high amounts can reduce yields.\n\nSeeding Depth\n\n1/4”\n\nPlant Spacing\n\n12-18”\n\nRow Spacing\n\n18-36\" or double rows 18” apart on 5-6’ centers.\n\nWhen to Sow\n\nStart transplants 6-8 weeks before planting date. Sow seeds into flat ~4 seeds/inch and then pot up into 2” or larger cells after first set of true leaves appear. Optimal soil temperature for germination is 85°F. For growing transplants, maintain temperature at around 75°F during the day and 65°F at night. Harden off plants by slightly reducing temperature to 60-65°F and reducing water for 2-3 days before transplanting.\n\nHarvest\n\nHarvest first peppers promptly to stimulate further fruit production. Peppers can be harvested and eaten at either unripe (green) or ripe (colored) stage. Colored peppers generally require 2 – 4 weeks longer\n\nStorage\n\nStore peppers at 50° - 54°F and 95% percent relative humidity. Chilling injury occurs at temperatures below 45°F.\n\nPest Info\n\nIf plants are flowering but fail to set fruit, the culprit (at least in northern regions) is likely to be the tarnished plant bug, which particularly appreciates the sap of eggplant and pepper flowers. Consider planting under row covers, or where this is impractical, a spray containing several deterrents, such as Beauveria bassiana (such as Naturalis™, see Supplies), pyrethrin, neem oil, and/or an insecticidal soap (such as Safer Brand™) may be effective\n\nDisease Info"
