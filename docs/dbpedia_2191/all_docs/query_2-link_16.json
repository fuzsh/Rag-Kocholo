        "text": "• Saves up to 8w\n\n• 500g pouch\n\n• Extend the life of your wax with Super Secret Chain Treatment\n\n• Clean to the touch on the chain\n\n• No PFAS chemicals\n\n• Get up to 25,000 km out of a chain\n\nWhen we launched secret chain lube, Josh admitted that the starting point for this product was a hot wax recipe he had used for years with pro teams that had won numerous world and Olympic medals. The idea behind Secret Chain Lube was to bring this technology to a lube that didn't require hot melting but turns out, many of our customers were already big fans of hot waxing chains, and the requests flooded in for us to release the SILCA Secret Wax Blend.. so here it is!\n\nConsisting of highly refined laboratory-grade paraffin and a high concentration of 3 specific sizes of nano-scale Tungsten disulfide, Secret Chain Blend not only acts as a lubricant but actually acts to modify the surface of the chain, filling in all of the crevices of the metal with highly lubricious and wear-resistant tungsten disulfide particles. As a result, chains waxed with Secret Chain Blend and Secret Chain Lube will actually get faster over time and after repeated waxings. Secret Chain Blend is the only hot wax lubricant to have a specifically matched and compatible drip wax which can be used to 'top off' the wax as needed, extending the duration between hot wax applications, and guaranteeing the quietest running drivetrain possible. Using the combination of Secret Chain Blend and Secret Chain Lube can dramatically extend the chain and drivetrain component life (up to 10x).\n\nReminder: Do not leave the sousvide bag unattended in a pot of water, while on the stove, at any point of the chain waxing process.\n\nWax Chain Maintenance with Super Secret Chain Lube"
