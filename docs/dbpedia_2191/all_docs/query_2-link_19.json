        "text": "I've been using this product for more than six months, and I must say that every time I use it, I'm amazed by the results. It even removes very tiny hairs on my face. I'm thrilled to have found this product in the store, and I'm also proud to know that there is an Iranian woman behind this wonderful product.\n\nUnfortunately, one of my worst waxing experiences. This is not the same formula as they had before! This wax sticks like a glue and wont come off unless taking a piece of your skin with it! Made my bikini area bleeding every time I used it. Before placing my order I consulted with them about the product as I could not find the one I've used 2 years. They told me that this is the same formula with a different packaging and I ordered 6 of them . I regret it. Stressful experience . This is for sure a different formula. Said someone who used Parissa wax for 2 years.\n\nHi there! Thanks for supporting Parissa and writing us a review. We have not changed our formulas in many years, we have only had a small update to the shape and colour of our packaging. We are more than happy to help you troubleshoot the issues you are running into. There are many factors that can impact the process as well as the results. Please feel free to contact us directly for assistance in using your hot waxes.\n\nHi Pam!\n\nWe're sorry to hear you had a difficult experience using our Face & Lip Hot Wax. We recommend heating the wax on an electric stove or wax warmer for easiest heating. If the wax spills, we recommend letting the wax harden first before removing the wax. Residue left behind can be cleaned with oil as soap and water will not work on this wax! Please feel free to reach out to us directly for assistance.\n\n? Your next best wax is here! ?\n\nI was gifted the Face & Lip Hot Wax, Brow Waxing Pen and the Ultra Soothe Post Oil from @parissawax and @thisisbutterly ?? Let me tell you, I wish I had known about these product earlier! Each kit comes with all of the essentials you would need to make you your own pro esthetician right from home.\n\nBe confident in knowing that Parissa has all natural and non toxic hair removal products and are made with ingredients like pine resin, bees wax, chamomile extract, castor seed, cane sugar, gum rosin, vitamin e and citric acid to give you the smoothest and non irritating wax possible.\n\nCanadian made, Cruelty Free and Sustainably packaged. Check out Parissa?s range of products and get waxing now ??\n\n#40yearsofsmooth #waxnaturally #parissawax #cleanbeauty #gifted #butterly #vancouvergirl #vancouvermade\n\nThis product is definitely less messy than other similar options (like those with the strips), but it nonetheless requires patience that I don't necessarily have. The wax tends to cool down pretty quickly, which means you have to work quickly (but also carefully, as this is for facial use - and I have sensitive skin, so I'm not wanting any burns). It got a lot of hair, but not all of it. I feel like I will keep the rest of this product for my underarms as I feel it may be more effective (and that area's also a bit more forgiving)."
