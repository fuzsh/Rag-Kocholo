        "text": "Getting a professional waxing treatment is one of the most effective ways to get smooth, flawless skin. But, with treatments often lasting up to an hour and having a few unique nuances that come along with it, it's understandable if you're feeling a bit anxious. So, what can you expect from this type of beauty treatment? Let's take an in-depth look at what to expect during a professional waxing treatment so that you know exactly what to prepare for before you arrive.\n\nPre-Treatment Prep\n\nBefore your waxing session even begins, your esthetician will likely be engaging in some form of pre-treatment prep. This could mean using oil or powder on the area that needs to be waxed as well as cleaning your skin and ensuring that it is free of any oils or lotions. This process helps ensure that everything runs smoothly as well as helping reduce any potential pain levels.\n\nApplication Process\n\nOnce your skin is prepped and ready, the real fun begins! Your esthetician will then take either soft or hard wax (depending upon which type best suits the area being treated) and apply it directly onto your skin in the desired direction of hair growth. Soft wax is typically used for areas such as the face because it is gentler on delicate or sensitive skin while hard wax does a better job of removing coarser body on other parts of the body like legs and underarms. The protected layer of oil or powder barrier makes the procedure more comfortable while also helping the hairs bind more easily with the wax so they can be removed quickly and effectively at their root level when ready.\n\nRemoval Process\n\nOnce your warm wax has been left to cool and set for a few minutes, it's time for removal - which again depends on which type of wax was used (soft or hard). For soft wax, fabric strips are used before being quickly ripped off against hair growth, taking all hairs out from their roots â€” ouch! On the other hand, hard wax dries completely over time so no fabric strips are needed since hardened formulas stick solely to those pesky little hairs when pulled off towards opposite growth direction with hands. At this point, many estheticians may wipe down their client's freshly treated area with antiseptic wipes afterwards before applying post-wax moisturizers that also help buffer any immediate discomfort due to possible redness or irritation after treatment later on.\n\nAfter Care\n\nDepending upon how sensitive your skin is, you may experience some minor redness or irritation after a professional waxing treatment, but these effects should dissipate within an hour or two following sessions. To help keep inflammation at bay immediately afterwards though (and avoid complications), make sure to not book any heavy exercise sessions right away; instead opt for lighter activity like yoga and swimming instead - both which help soothe irritated muscles without risking further rashes caused by friction rubbing against clothing pieces such as tight-fitting jeans. Additionally try avoiding hot showers during this period as sudden heat change post-treatment may cause some uncomfortable stinging too!"
