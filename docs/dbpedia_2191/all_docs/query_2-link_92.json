        "text": "Base Wax\n\nBase wax is essential for any new board no matter the water temperature you plan on surfing. Base wax, also called base coat, should be used as a primer for any new board. It allows for other waxes to stick to the board better. Base wax is very hard and should only be used on new, cleaned surfboards. Typically a surfboard with base wax will last longer than a surfboard without it.\n\nWaxes for Different Water Temperatures\n\nOnce you have applied a base wax, you will need to determine the temperature of the water you will be surfing. (A good resource to look at for water temperatures is Surf-Forecast.com). The water temperature will determine which wax will work best on your board. This is due to some waxes hardening in colder temperatures or softening in warmer temperatures, also known as hardness/tackiness point. Below is breakdown of wax types and water temperatures.\n\nCold Wax\n\nCold wax is the softest wax. It is designed to be used on boards in water temperatures below 58 degree Fahrenheit or 14 degrees Celsius. Because the wax is soft, it is easily applied to the board in colder temperatures versus spending hours trying to put a hard wax on. You would only need this wax if you are planning on surfing in Charleston during the colder winter months, typically January and February.\n\nCool Wax\n\nCool wax is the next softest wax and is designed to be used in water temperatures from 54 to 69 degrees Fahrenheit (12-20 degrees Celsius). You would most likely use this type of wax if you are trying to surf Folly Beach in the early spring and later fall months.\n\nWarm Wax\n\nWarm wax is a harder wax and is designed to be used in water temperatures ranging from 63 to 78 degrees (17-25 degrees Celsius). This wax would get you through early summer in Charleston and early fall months.\n\nTropical Wax\n\nTropical wax is the hardest wax and should really only be used in really warm waters including waters above 75 degrees Fahrenheit or 24 degrees Celsius. If you are planning to surf Folly Beach in July through mid-September (basically during the height of hurricane season), you may want to bring this wax along.\n\nWax Brands We Recommend\n\nThere are several different brands of wax that we recommend. Our number one brand that we recommend is Sticky Bumps Wax. This wax creates the best bumps for grip and smells like a delicious coconut. The wax also has the best consistency of any wax we have found.\n\nAnother one of our favorite brands is Mr. Zog’s Sex Wax. This brand is well known in the surfing community. Sex wax comes in several types including original Sex Wax, Quick Humps, and really Tacky. Each wax type comes in different formulas for based on water temperatures.\n\nWe also highly recommend Mrs. Palmers Wax. Mrs. Palmers is made in Australia and includes a traction additive that helps increase the stickiness while also not wearing out in the water. This leads to a long, lasting tacky wax. The wax also comes in cardboard (not plastic) making it easy to open, as well as, in bars that can easily broken in two and thrown into your surf bag.\n\nWax isn’t a “one size fits all” item. It’s important to know what to look for when buying wax. The last thing you want is continually slip off your board due to a soft wax or spend hours trying to wax your board with a hard wax. Look at the label for water temperatures and stick to reputable brands. Doing this will ensure you enjoy your time on the water, rather than just continually get frustrated."
