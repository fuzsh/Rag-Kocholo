        "text": "As a brand, we are always aiming for excellence, and that includes the products and how we use them. Specially formulated, all-natural soft wax is used because it generally works far better at removing hair and creates a gentler, more comfortable waxing experience for guests. Oftentimes, hard wax requires multiple applications over the same area of skin to remove all of the hair, and that can be uncomfortable. With the speed-waxing technique and soft wax, waxologists can work quickly to remove all of the hair in a way that is gentler to the skin. A quick, thorough experience is what salons strive for every time. Loyal Radiant Waxing guests agree that the products and techniques offer beautifully smooth skin. Come in and see for yourself!\n\nBasic bikini is the hair just inside the underwear line down to the bottom of the cheeks. A tight bikini brings it in further on the sides and right up to the edge of the labia – it also brings the top down as far as the guest would like, but not including the labia.\n\nDon’t plan to get a spray tan before getting waxed. You don’t want to wax that golden glow right off! Also, you don’t want to plan on getting a spray tan after getting waxed because self-tan reacts with keratin in the skin and “stains” the skin. Waxing can cause self-tan to look patchy and streaky as it often removes the top (dead) layer of skin cells.\n\nCan I go tanning after getting waxed?\n\nTry to wait 48 hours to tan after waxing, just to be safe. If you do find yourself needing to be outside in the sunshine, just make sure to use sunscreen.\n\nDon’t worry, your waxologist will help you discover the perfect brow shape for your facial features. Even if you have spent some time with tweezers in the past, they can – with a little patience and expertise – help you get your brows where you like them and help you keep them that way."
