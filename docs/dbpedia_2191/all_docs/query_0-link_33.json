        "text": "You’ve presumably been thinking about what the distinction between hot waxing and customary waxing is? Could it be said that they are both “hot” wax? You won’t ever comprehend this totally until you don’t attempt it yourself! Along these lines, assuming you are prepared for it, Book now and get your most memorable Hot Wax cozy waxing with Andreea in Canary Wharf or Stratford Scene, London to encounter this!\n\nTo realize what are the advantages of Hot Waxing or you’re not completely certain Hot Wax is what you really want definitively, keep perusing, and you will figure out why all experts utilize this strategy and all clients love Hot Wax in Amazing Waxing !\n\nAnyway, for what reason is Hot Wax the best for Private Waxing?\n\nI will impart to you seven principal reasons:\n\n1. Stronger grip\n\nHot Wax is the wax of decision for Swimsuit/Hollywood/Brazilian waxes, underarm wax and some of the time facial waxing too as a result of its more grounded hold! A firmer grasp on the hairs is so profoundly viable on thicker, more grounded hairs like in Close regions.\n\n2. No ingrown hairs\n\nHot Wax leads to less ingrown hairs, because of the Hot Wax main feature — wrapping around the hair follicle. It pulls out all hairs entirely at once!\n\n3. No reddening or bruising\n\nWhen we put Hot Wax covering the skin for a minute, heat opens pores, hair follicles, allowing hair to wax out very gently, removing hairs from the root without pulling the skin. It helps lessen reddening and bruising in such gentle areas with thin skin.\n\n4.Hot Wax is Perfect for short, stubborn hairs as small as 1mm\n\nHot wax is designed to shrink-wrap around the hair follicle, removing it from the root and removing as small hairs as 1mm! It is perfect for short and stubborn hairs in the Intimate zones.\n\n5. The wax promotes skin hydration\n\nThe Hot Wax used for Intimate hair removal has such ingredients as essential oils and honey for hydration. A thick layer of Hot Wax opens pores and nourishes your skin from the inside!\n\n6. Less Painful\n\nThe treatment with Hot Wax is less painful because of the open pores. It helps to remove all hairs with roots without pulling the skin, which often is very painful in the thin skin intimate zones.\n\n7. More extended re-growth periods\n\nHot Waxing in Intimate zones extends re-growth periods as it removes all hairs with roots, even 1 mm length! Sounds amazing right?"
