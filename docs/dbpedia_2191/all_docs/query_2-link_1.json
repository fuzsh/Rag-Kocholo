        "text": "Fragrance-free. Chemical-free. Allergen-free. It really doesn’t get any better than our Pure Hot Wax. Formulated to make removing unwanted hair as pain free as possible, the wax uses the best sugar to grip the shortest and finest hair.\n\nWe even made the microwavable wax water-soluble for a leisurely (and quick) post-wax cleanse. Oh, and for brighter, radiant skin, we squeezed in lemon juice.\n\nStep 1\n\nAs always, begin by turning up the volume on Honeybee Tunes. Now relax and let the fun begin.\n\nStep 2\n\nTwist open the lid of the Pure Hot Wax jar. The first time, you’ll also have to remove the aluminium seal.\n\nStep 3\n\nNext, heat the wax in your microwave in bursts of 30 seconds. You can warm it for a total of 2 minutes. Between each interval, stir the wax to check the consistency. Once it looks like soft, pourable honey, the hot wax is ready for hair removal.\n\nStep 4\n\nDip your spatula in the pure hot wax and spread an even, thin layer of it in the same direction as your hair growth. Place a wax strip on top. Use your hand to firmly press it to your skin.\n\nStep 5\n\nTo remove hair, hold the strip base while keeping your skin taut and pull it off against the direction of hair growth. Use a quick, flicking motion.\n\nStep 6\n\nRepeat steps 4 and 5 until all the desired areas are waxed. Use water to cleanse any residue and then relish the feeling of velvety skin for weeks!\n\nBEE BETTER AT WAXING AT HOME\n\nTo make the most of your Honeybee waxing experience, make sure your skin is dry, clean and free of moisturiser or oil.\n\nOur Pure Hot Wax is kind to your skin. Be kind in return. Don’t overheat it.\n\nNo microwave? You can warm the wax by dipping it in hot water. How much water? About 3/4th of the jar should be underwater.\n\nBefore you start waxing, patch test the temperature on the inside of your wrist.\n\nWe advise you not to exfoliate, apply chemical treatments or expose your skin to direct sunlight for 24 hours after you wax.\n\nOnce the 24-hour limit has crossed, go ahead and exfoliate 3 to 4 times every week for blissful, silky skin.\n\nWe strongly urge you not to wax when your skin is damaged, burnt, or inflamed. Wait for it to heal."
