Check out our beginners guide for jewellers covering the different types of wax, how to calculate the weight of your finished metal piece, how the casting process works, how to make multiples of your designs, what size of ring you should make and much more.\n\nWhat is wax carving?\n\nWax carving is an ancient tradition in jewellery making going back 6000 years.\n\nStarting with a lump of jewellers wax; you saw and file it down into the shape you require like a sculptor working with stone. Your finished wax piece is then sent to a caster to be cast in any metal you want through the process of lost wax casting.\n\nWax carving is a great technique to learn to add to your jewellery making skills because it is a fantastic way to experiment with an affordable material. You can also to make more organic shapes that are hard to achieve with traditional sheet metal and wire.\n\nJewellers wax\n\nThere are different types of jewellers wax available that are used for different purposes.\n\nFile-a-wax - Some waxes e.g. beeswax are too soft to carve and shape and are problematic to try to use in warm temperatures so file-a-wax products were developed. These are designed specifically for jewellers to use to file and shape.\n\nOne of the main brands that jewellers use is Ferris. Ferris wax comes in four different colours (with green and blue most used).\n\nGreen: A very hard wax, it can’t be flexed. Ideal for sharp edges and for intricate carvings and delicate engraving.\n\nPurple: General purpose, hard with some flexibility.\n\nBlue: Less hard and more flexible than green or purple. Good for rounded surfaces and less intricate designs. This is a popular choice with jewellers and the one we suggest you try first\n\nTurquoise: Displays exceptional surface finish, especially in recessed areas. Maintains superior strength, toughness and extreme flexibility.\n\nSheet wax - good for cutting, moulding and modelling but not as good for carving\n\nWax profile wire and tube - wax in the form of wire or tube, can be bent and twisted, used for hinges etc just like metal wire\n\nThe wax can also be purchased in other shapes including ring and flat-sided ring for carving rings and block. The size and shape you need depends on your design idea, for a more dainty ring design choose a small diameter of wax e.g. 22.2mm. For a chunkier look choose a bigger diameter e.g. 27mm.\n\nTip: If you will be working on different types of design then choose the thicker diameter of wax as it is the most versatile\n\nTools for wax carving\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more about the tools used for wax carving check out our previous blog post >\n\nWhat do i do once i’ve carved my design?\n\nWhen you have carved and finished your jewellery you will need to decide which metal you would like to have it cast in. You can do a quick calculation of how much the cast piece will weigh using the wax to metal conversion chart below. Remember that the wax is light, 10 times lighter than silver and 16 times lighter than 18 carat gold so you’ll need to account for this in your designs. This is also the way to calculate the cost of the casting. Casters charge a fee for the casting plus the cost of the metal by weight so ask your caster the current costs, remembering that metal costs fluctuate daily.\n\nThe majority of jewellers send their wax pieces to a specialist caster. You can learn to cast your own work but this takes investment in additional equipment so it may be something to look at in the future if you find that you enjoy the process.\n\nHow do I find a caster?\n\nYou can do an internet search for casters in your country. Our tip is to ask for recommendations in jewellers forums e.g. Facebook groups.\n\nHow can I make multiples of my designs?\n\nThe casting process is great for making multiples of your designs. Once you have had your piece/s cast you will file and polish them so they are ready to be moulded.\n\nYou can see this process at the beginning of the video above. The ‘master’ - your finished piece of jewellery - is put into a silicone mould and vulcanised using heat and pressure. Once cool, this is then cut out of the silicone and the mould is now in two parts. When the mould is used, wax is injected into it so that the piece can be attached to the wax tree for casting.\n\nIf I’m making a ring, what size/s should I make?\n\nWhen you make a ring design to sell you will need to decide on the ring size to make which you will then alter when a customer orders from you. It is usually best to make a larger size, e.g. a UK size S for a woman’s ring, and then size it down for the customer. This does, of course, depend on the design of the ring and how easy it will be to resize so it is worth taking into account. For example, if the band is intricate all around and it will be hard to remove some metal to resize it and keep the design so you may need to make more sizes of the same ring in wax for your collection."
