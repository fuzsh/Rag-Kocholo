        "text": "Ingrown hairs in the pubic area can form cysts — sacs of fluid beneath the skin. A person may notice a lump, possibly with a hair visible beneath it. It may also be itchy. Cysts often go away without treatment, but some require antibiotics or draining.\n\nAn ingrown pubic hair cyst is usually no cause for concern. A person may choose to have a cyst drained, or a doctor may make a small incision to free the trapped hair.\n\nThese cysts may go away on their own. A doctor may only recommend treatment if the cyst seems infected or is causing issues such as pain.\n\nThis article explains how ingrown pubic hair cysts form, how to identify and prevent them, and when to contact a doctor.\n\nAn ingrown hair is a strand of hair that grows into, rather than out of, the skin.\n\nIngrown hairs tend to develop in areas of hair removal, including the pubic area. They may happen after a person shaves, waxes, or tweezes the hair.\n\nCoarse or curly hairs are most likely to grow inward, but this can happen with any hair type.\n\nAn area with ingrown hairs may have little reddish bumps that may itch. It might be possible to see the hair trapped within the skin.\n\nOver time, an ingrown hair may develop into a cyst — a sac of fluid beneath the skin.\n\nAn ingrown hair cyst is a lump beneath the skin. It will not have a visible head and may be red, white, or yellow. The cyst may also be painful or tender to the touch.\n\nMost types of cyst look very similar. An ingrown hair cyst starts as a small, red bump. Many people call these bumps razor bumps or razor burn, and their medical name is pseudofolliculitis.\n\nOver time, a bump, usually just one, may get bigger and form a cyst.\n\nAn ingrown pubic hair cyst can develop anywhere in the pubic area. It may result, for example, from removing hair from the bikini line.\n\nEach strand of hair grows in a follicle beneath the skin. When people wax or shave, they only remove the strands of hair, not the follicles.\n\nWhen the hair regrows, it may become trapped within the skin, growing farther inward instead of outward and forming a little bump.\n\nSometimes, skin cells and a fibrous substance called keratin, a protein in hair and nails, collect within the lump. Over time, the buildup forms a cyst.\n\nSkin cysts are not usually dangerous, and may go away on their own within 7–10 days. They can, however, become inflamed or infected.\n\nA dermatologist may recommend draining the fluid from the cyst by making a small incision. Sometimes, a doctor uses a small needle or blade to free the ingrown hair.\n\nIf a cyst becomes inflamed or infected, a doctor might suggest a steroid injection or antibiotics. Also, a steroid cream may help reduce swelling or irritation.\n\nAlthough people should not try to pop or remove a cyst at home, the following home remedies and strategies may help to encourage drainage and relieve symptoms, such as pain:\n\napply a warm compress\n\nkeep the surrounding area clean\n\nwash hands before touching the area\n\nuse creams and lotions to relieve itching\n\nA person with an ingrown hair or resulting cyst should avoid scratching, picking, or squeezing it. This can damage the skin and lead to an infection.\n\nIf an infection develops, the ingrown hair and surrounding area may have the following features:\n\ntenderness or pain\n\nswelling\n\nredness\n\nfeels warm to the touch\n\nIf a person develops an infection, they should contact a healthcare professional for treatment.\n\nAccording to the United Kingdom’s National Health Service, a person should contact a healthcare professional if:\n\nthe area around the ingrown hair is very painful, hot, red, or swollen\n\nthey have a high fever or otherwise feel very unwell\n\nthey are unsure whether the issue is ingrown hairs\n\ningrown hair cysts occur frequently\n\nThe best way to prevent ingrown hairs is to avoid shaving and waxing. If a person wants to remove hair, it may help to switch to a hair removal cream or laser treatment.\n\nFor people who prefer to continue shaving, the following tips can reduce the risk of ingrown hairs:\n\nwet the skin with warm water before shaving\n\nuse shaving gel or foam\n\nuse as few strokes of the razor as possible\n\nrinse the razor after every stroke\n\ndo not shave too close to the skin\n\nnever use a blunt razor\n\nshave in the direction of hair growth\n\nafter shaving, hold a cool, wet cloth to the skin\n\nuse an exfoliating body scrub to release any trapped hairs\n\nBelow are frequently asked questions relating to ingrown pubic hairs.\n\nHow does a person get rid of ingrown pubic hair lumps?\n\nTypically, lumps or cysts from ingrown hairs resolve independently. However, a doctor can make a small incision to free the trapped hair or drain cysts if a person wishes. These minor procedures will lessen lumps.\n\nCan a person pop an ingrown pubic hair cyst?\n\nPeople should not pop or pick at pubic hair cysts. Doing so risks infection and scarring.\n\nHow long does it take for an ingrown pubic hair to go away?\n\nInfected ingrown hair lumps can clear up on their own within 7–10 days.\n\nHow can a person draw out an ingrown hair?\n\nAccording to the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK, a person can draw out an ingrown hair by using an exfoliating scrub.\n\nIngrown hairs can form anywhere on the body with hair. “Ingrown” means that a strand of hair grows back into the skin rather than out of it.\n\nShaving and waxing are the most common causes of ingrown hairs. At first, a person may notice a series of small bumps, which may be reddish and itchy. These patches of ingrown hairs are called razor burn.\n\nOne ingrown hair may form a cyst — a red, yellow, or whitish lump beneath the skin.\n\nThese cysts are usually no cause for concern and may resolve on their own. A doctor may only recommend treatment if a cyst causes pain or other symptoms or if it becomes infected or inflamed.\n\nThe best way to prevent ingrown pubic hairs is not to shave or wax the area."
