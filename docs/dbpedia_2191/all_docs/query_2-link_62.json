        "text": "Coconut 83 is a natural wax with excellent adhesion and setup properties. Its creamy texture and low shrink profile make it perfect for working with clear glass, as there's minimal shrinkage which allows the wax to stick better to the container sides. The top surface also tends to be more flat after curing, though some heat gun touch-ups may still be necessary. Coconut 83 has forgiving pour temperature requirements due to its consistency, although optimal adherence occurs at hotter pouring temperatures (190F). Additionally, this blend offers great cold throw fragrance performance thanks to its creamy texture. However, because of its low heat resistance properties in high-temperature environments or outdoor markets during summer conditions can cause fragrance oil sweating or beading. Certain wicks may not burn stably due to high levels of coconut and oil; we recommend using the CD wick series for a more cool, stable, and clean burn. Adding Beeswax helps absorb excess oils while adding stability in higher temperature situations or complex-shaped containers; common loads range between 1-5%. Vybar is an alternative if you want vegan-friendly products that aid in enhancing scent throws. Stearic Acid works well too if you require both a natural and vegan option where most common loads are typically within the range of 5-10%.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the purchaser and/or the individual using the products from California Candle Supply to conduct the necessary tests to ensure the quality and safety of the product and/or finished product.
