        "text": "Whether you're nervous for your first appointment, are gearing up for your second visit with a few questions,\n\nor a regular. Here are a few things you need to keep in mind before hopping on the intimate waxing specialist \\ experts waxing table.\n\nIntimate waxes should not be complicated or something to fear, but because the act of getting one is so intimate and personal, we tend to overthink the entire process. Whether it's your first time or you’re a pro, the idea of opening your legs to a stranger (or the kind of acquaintance you only see for an hour every four weeks) can admittedly be nerve-wracking for anyone. Honestly really it doesn't have to be a big deal — really. Here are the answers to every single question you may have, whether you're a newbie or a regular waxer.\n\nHow do I find a good waxer?\n\nUNLIKE MOST BEAUTY SALONS WHICH COULD BE CONSIDERED JACKS OF ALL TRADES BUT MASTERS OF NONE, WAXING ME PRETTY CHELTENHAM WAXING THERAPISTS DEVOTE THEIR ENTIRE DAYS TO WAXING HAIR REMOVAL.\n\nOUR SPECIALIST SKILLS MEAN THAT YOUR WAXING ME PRETTY CHELTENHAM WAX WILL BE QUICKER, CAUSE YOU LESS DISCOMFORT AND GIVE YOU BETTER RESULTS THAN WAXES FROM GENERALIST BEAUTY SALONS, WHICH DO NOT TYPICALLY EMPLOY EXPERTS.\n\nFURTHERMORE, WE’LL MAKE SURE THAT YOU GET THE BEST RESULTS FOR WEEKS AFTER YOUR TREATMENT THANKS TO THE DETAILED AFTERCARE ADVICE YOU WILL RECEIVE FROM OUR FRIENDLY AND KNOWLEDGEABLE THERAPIST.\n\nChoose a skilled waxer. All salons offer waxing but not all of them do it well. An intimate wax should not be intimidating or painful. Go to a therapist who has had specific training - shockingly most therapists have had no proper training in intimate waxing.\n\nAt Waxing Me pretty Cheltenham we are professionally trained in intimate waxing to industry standards. Recognised and accredited from BABTAC as award winning waxing experts in female body waxing and intimate waxing with qualification and certificates available. Waxing me pretty are members of the British Association of Beauty Therapy & Cosmetology (BABTAC) are appropriately qualified, meticulously verified and appropriately insured.\n\nYou should not have to ask for thoroughness - experts do this everyday so just leave the intimate waxing to them.\n\nBUT LET’S TAKE A LOOK AT WHY WAXING BEATS SHAVING WHEN IT COMES TO COMPARING EACH PROCESS…\n\nWaxing removes dead skin cells\n\nWaxing not only removes hair, it also exfoliates your skin. When you pull out the wax from your skin, it takes away dead cells and leaves a brand-new layer of skin. This is why the body or face feels so smooth after waxing.\n\nLong-lasting results\n\nShaving doesn’t entirely remove hair, it just cuts off the hair shaft, which is only the visible part of the hair on the surface of the skin. But hairs are much longer than that; they grow from the hair follicle deep in the dermis (layer of skin below the epidermis). That’s the reason why after shaving, fuzz grows back so quickly, in just one-week hairs are visible again. On the other hand, waxing does remove hairs from the root; therefore, it takes a lot longer for hairs to grow back!\n\nHairs might cease to grow\n\nWaxing mercilessly pulls hairs out from the root; this action weakens the hair follicles, and therefore, hairs grow back but are less strong. Over time, if you wax on a regular basis, hairs might actually stop growing because the hair follicle is too damaged to work properly.\n\nHairs grow back thinner\n\nGiven that waxing weakens the hair follicles, sometimes hairs start to grow much thinner, and they become easier to pull out – the procedure even gets less painful!\n\nSmoother outcome\n\nThe final result after a waxing session is much smoother and attractive than any other kind of shaving method, especially because the hair is pulled out from the root.\n\nNo more itching\n\nItchy legs, armpits, or pubic areas are a common problem for women and men even right after shaving. With waxing, this could be prevented by using the crème de la crème of all waxes from product manufacturer who have over 30 years of innovation. We use the only hot wax and strip wax worth taking your clothes off for. Our wax is suitable for all skin types, even the most sensitive. We believe that using vegan ingredients which are healthier, more natural, rich in active ingredients and free from chemicals are healthier for our bodies.that are made to treat and prevent side effects.\n\nNo more cuts\n\nYou can say goodbye to razors and unintentional cuts on your skin. When shaving, you can seriously harm yourself when the blades are too sharp or if you’re not paying attention to what you’re doing.\n\nFast yet better results\n\nWe won’t lie, shaving will always be the fastest way to remove hair, and you can get hairless legs, for example, in just ten minutes. However, waxing doesn’t require much time either, and for the little extra time you’re spending, you will get much better results.\n\nHERE AT WAXING ME PRETTY CHELTENHAM WE BELIEVE WAXING ISN’T SOMETHING YOU DO NOW AND AGAIN AS A LUXURY, IT SHOULD BE PART OF YOUR BODY MAINTENANCE ROUTINE.\n\nit’s certainly not just a vanity thing. We believe it makes you feel better, inside and out – knowing how good we look underneath makes us all feel more confident on the outside.\n\nWe all wax for different reasons. Some of us are all for a regular wax, others are more for occasions such as holidays, weddings etc. but we believe regular waxing has many benefits. From the physical effect of softer, smoother skin for longer, without the need of shaving to the mental effects of feeling more confident in yourself. Some people wax as part of their beauty regime, some for more medical or medicinal reasons. Those who have excessive hair growth on certain parts of their body can suffer from low self-esteem. A regular wax can rectify this and leave the customer feeling more confident in their appearance. Please do talk to us if your waxing needs are of a more sensitive nature. We will help you plan a course of treatment to suit your individual needs.\n\nAlso becoming a regular wax er reaps its own rewards! Each time you get waxed, more hair is brought into line in the same growth cycle, as the hair is removed, resetting it back to the growth stage. After that second or third regular treatment, when all your follicles are towing the line and pushing the hair out at the same time, you’ll find your treatment leaves you smoother than ever before and for longer.\n\nWaxing Me Pretty Cheltenham exists to empower our clients by making you feel comfortable and confident in your own body.\n\nProviding high-quality waxing treatments to women in a professional and clean environment, our specialist skills mean that waxing me pretty waxes are quicker and cause less discomfort than waxes from generalist beauty salons, which do not typically employ experts.
