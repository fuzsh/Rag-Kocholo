        "text": "The Ultimate Chain Waxing System is your compact at-home kit for immersive waxing of chains. The wax warmer, drip stand, and cable coupler are included to make you ready-to-roll for having the cleanest, quietest and most efficient drivetrain possible.\n\nThe wax melter has a vented clear lid to retain heat while being able to verify the wax is fully melted. Perfect companion for StripChip to wax your chain in a single, no degreaser, step.\n\nThe chain hanging stand allows for a no mess drying period where you can allow excess wax to drip right back into the pot to use for the next application. The notched base retains the melter in place and holds the chain coupler securely in place.\n\nThe chain coupler has a steel cable that is threaded on one side allowing it to be looped through your chain and secured on the other side. Dip your chain in the wax, agitate, and hang all without getting wax anywhere you don't want it or touching a pot of hot wax."
