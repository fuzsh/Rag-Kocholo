You can find more of my canning recipes here.\n\nYou’re scrambling, engrossed in a last minute grocery run for an easy appetizer that everyone will love. You grab the fancy jar of hot pepper jelly, and a block of Philadelphia cream cheese. Or maybe the strawberry jelly and a round of brie cheese. A pretty ceramic platter is in the back seat.\n\nAll you need to do is arrive at the party and spoon the jelly over the cream cheese. And in an instant, “the oooohhh, this is so good!” start echoing. Some classics never disappoint. Am I right?\n\nAnd guess what?

It has a beautiful translucent orange to yellow color.\n\nNot only is it absolutely beautiful with its confetti of colors shimmering in the light, but it’s the perfect mix of sweet and spicy. Exactly why it’s such a good match when paired with cool and creamy accompaniments, like cream cheese.\n\nHow To Can Homemade Hot Pepper Jelly\n\nSterilize jars and bands by washing in warm, soapy water.\n\nChop all of your peppers, and measure out your other ingredients so they are ready to use.\n\nBring your Ball® Canning half pint jars to a simmer in your water bath canner, and have the lids in warm water in a small saucepan.\n\nAdd chopped peppers and vinegar to a pot.
