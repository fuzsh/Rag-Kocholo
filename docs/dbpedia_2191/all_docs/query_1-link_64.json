        "text": "How is BHO used?\n\nCannabis is traditionally smoked in ‘joints’, ‘bongs’ or vaporised but these methods are not effective ways of consuming butane hash oil as it becomes a ‘runny liquid’ when heated. A specifically designed ‘bong’ commonly known as an ‘oil rig’ is commonly used.3\n\nThere is anecdotal evidence that indicates people believe dabbing is a safer method of cannabis ingestion as opposed to a bong or joint due to the high potency of dabs, which reduces the number of times it needs to be taken to produce a ‘high’.5\n\nIt has been reported that the home production of BHO (known as blasting) is hazardous as butane is flammable and highly volatile, with a number of incidents such as explosions, fires and severe burns occurring in the US.1\n\nThere is little known about the risks of ‘dabs’ compared to traditional cannabis but it has been proposed that the increased level of THC and the unique method of administration may increase the risk of dependence and intensify withdrawal symptoms.5\n\nEffects of BHO\n\nUse of any drug can have risks. It’s important to be careful when taking any type of drug.\n\nButane hash oil affects everyone differently, based on:\n\nsize, weight and health\n\nwhether the person is used to taking it\n\nwhether other drugs are taken around the same time\n\nthe amount taken\n\nthe strength of the drug (varies from batch to batch)\n\nthe environment (where the drug is taken).\n\nLow to moderate use of cannabis may produce the following effects:\n\nfeelings of relaxation and euphoria\n\nspontaneous laughter and excitement\n\nincreased sociability\n\nincreased appetite\n\ndry mouth.\n\nHigh strength cannabis in the form of butane hash oil may produce the following effects:\n\nrelaxation\n\nreduced nausea\n\nchanges to heart rate and blood pressure\n\nPain relief\n\nexcitement and restlessness\n\nconfusion and paranoia\n\nanxiety and panic\n\nreduced attention rate\n\ndecreased reaction times\n\ndetachment from reality3,6\n\nImpact of mood and environment\n\nDrugs that affect a person’s mental state (psychoactive drugs) can also have varied effects depending on a person’s mood (often called the ‘set’) or the environment they are in (the ‘setting’):\n\nSet: a person’s state of mind, previous encounters with butane hash oil and expectations of what’s going to happen. For example, if you have been experiencing symptoms of anxiety or depression, the use of Butane Hash Oil might make these symptoms worse and lead to a bad experience.7,8\n\nSetting: the environment in which someone consumes BHO – whether it’s known and familiar, who they’re with, if they’re indoors or outdoors, the type of music and light. For example, using BHO in a calm, quiet and relaxed environment can lead to, or contribute to, a pleasant experience but being in a noisy, crowded place may result in a negative experience.7\n\nLong-term effects\n\nLong-term effects are dependent on how much and how often cannabis is consumed and may also be affected by how cannabis is consumed (e.g. vaporising a concentrate versus smoking the flower). Heavy, regular use of cannabis may eventually cause: 9,10\n\ntolerance to the effects of cannabis\n\ndependence on cannabis\n\nlung injury\n\nreduced cognitive functioning9-11\n\nBHO and mental health\n\nPeople who use extremely strong THC cannabis concentrates (such as BHO) may put themselves at a greater risk of experiencing mental health harms such as depression, anxiety and psychosis.8,12\n\nIndividuals with a family history of serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder – or who currently experience symptoms of these conditions – should also avoid using BHO.13,14\n\nTolerance and dependence\n\nPeople who regularly use BHO can quickly become dependent on the drug. They may feel they need BHO to go about their normal activities like working, studying and socialising, or just to get through the day. They may also develop a tolerance to it, which means they need to take larger amounts of BHO to get the same effect.\n\nMixing BHO with other drugs\n\nMixing BHO (cannabis) with other drugs can have unpredictable effects and increase the risk of harm.\n\nCannabis and alcohol: can cause nausea, impaired coordination, vomiting.\n\nCannabis and cocaine/speed/ice: can lead to anxiety, paranoia, confusion, and thought loops.\n\nCannabis and psychedelics: may increase the effects which can lead to confusion or a challenging experience/bad trip.15"
