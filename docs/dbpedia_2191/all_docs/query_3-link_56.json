        "text": "If you’re considering body waxing in Tucson, you’ve probably heard about the benefits of waxing, such as smoother skin and longer-lasting results than shaving. While waxing can be an incredibly effective way to remove unwanted hair, there are some important things to keep in mind after your waxing appointment. Keep reading to learn more and book an appointment at The Waxing Studio in Tucson!\n\n1. Hot Showers & Baths\n\nHot showers and baths may feel amazing after a body waxing session, but they can actually cause skin irritation and dryness. Opt for lukewarm showers and baths and avoid using any harsh soaps or scrubs.\n\n2. Sun Exposure\n\nYour skin is especially sensitive after waxing, so avoid direct sunlight and sun tanning for at least 24 hours after your appointment. You should also use sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher when you are outdoors to protect your skin from sun damage.\n\n3. Tight clothing\n\nTo prevent irritation, you should avoid wearing tight clothing for 24 hours after your body waxing appointment. Loose-fitting clothing and breathable fabrics such as cotton will allow your skin to breathe and help it heal properly.\n\n4. Exfoliating\n\nExfoliating your skin can be beneficial for your skin, but it’s not a great idea after a waxing session. Exfoliating can cause irritation to your sensitive skin and can even lead to ingrown hairs. So it’s best to avoid exfoliating for the first few days post-waxing.\n\nThe Waxing Studio in Tucson offers Brazilian waxing and full-body waxing services fit for the stars. If you’re looking for a luxury waxing experience that will give you the best possible results, book an appointment today.\n\nIn the body waxing world, you often hear the terms “Brazilian wax” and “bikini wax” used interchangeably — but never by professionals! In today’s blog, we will shine some light on the difference between these two types of body waxing treatments to help you choose the best one for your needs. Keep reading to learn more and contact The Waxing Studio to book a Brazilian wax in Tucson!\n\nTreatment Areas\n\nThe first difference between Brazilian wax and Bikini waxing treatments is the area of the body that is waxed. A Brazilian wax removes all of the hair from the front and backside, including the inner and outer labia, anus, and perineum. A Bikini wax, on the other hand, only removes the hair on the sides and the top of the bikini line.\n\nLength of Hair Required for Waxing\n\nBefore the waxing process, Brazilian Waxes require the hair to be at least a quarter of an inch long. Bikini Waxes, however, can be done with minimal hair growth as short as a few millimeters. The tradeoff, however, is that Brazilian waxes tend to last longer than bikini waxes, providing weeks of smooth, hairless results.\n\nAppointment Time\n\nA Brazilian wax typically takes longer than a Bikini wax because it covers a larger area and provides a more thorough hair removal. A Brazilian wax can take anywhere between 30 minutes and an hour to complete, but if you choose our relaxing, luxurious waxing studio in Tucson, you’ll find yourself enjoying the process.\n\nWaxing Treatment Cost\n\nLike with most things, you get what you pay for with body waxing. Brazilian Waxes tend to be more expensive than quick bikini wax treatments, but they offer far more significant results and keep you hairless and feeling beautiful for an extended period of time. If you want your waxing treatments to be cost-effective and high-quality, we recommend trying a Brazilian Wax at our studio in Tucson!\n\nAre you ready to try a Brazilian waxing treatment?
