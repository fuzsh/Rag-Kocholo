        "text": "Selecting a wax for the conditions should not be that difficult. It should be simple and straight forward. If you are new to waxing here is the Fast Wax method explained. Start out by looking at two things in the weather forecast for the day of your event. The temperature and relative humidity or how wet the snow may be. Using the humidity you can determine if you should use a wax with Fluorocarbons in it or not. Your pocket book might help make this determination as well. Look at the charts on the next page to determine if the relative humidity falls into the sweet spot of a Fluorocarbon wax or not. Then once you have determined which wax line to go with, you use the temperature ranges of that line to select the specific wax to use. This is as basic as it gets, but we all have to start somewhere. Once you get more experience with waxing you can start to consider additional factors in determining your choice of waxes to use.\n\nMost Fast Wax products have a number in their name. This number is important. This number represents the approximate mid-temperature in the products temperature range. If you add and subtract 10 to this number you will have calculated the approximate temperature range that wax is ideal for. Take HS 20 for example, it has a temperature range of 12 to 28. Add and subtract 10 from 20 and one gets 10 and 30, pretty close to what the ideal temperature range is."
