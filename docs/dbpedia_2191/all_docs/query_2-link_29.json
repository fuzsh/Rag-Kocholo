It’s the quickest, easiest way to produce soy candles.\n\nMelt, fragrance, and pour your way to a better candle every time.\n\nFREEDOM Soy Wax is great for candlemaking newbies and experts alike.\n\nAnd, for those who like small batches and hate the mess that candle making presents, this wax is totally microwaveable! Weigh out your FREEDOM beads, place in a microwave-safe container, and microwave. Stir in fragrance and pour.\n\nOur 45-pound bags include and easy to open zip-strip that help eliminate the hassles of filling your melter!\n\nGreat looking tops with perfect sidewall adhesion can be accomplished by following these simple steps:\n\nHeat wax to 160 F\n\nMix in fragrance (up to 10%)\n\nPour into room-temperature jars\n\nGive your candles plenty of time to cool, and avoid trying to cool too rapidly as this can cause shrinkage and occasional sink-holes to occur.\n\nTip: Most candles 16oz. or less will finish in a single pour with smooth tops and excellent sidewall adhesion provided your candles are poured above 135°F. Cool slowly for even smoother tops.\n\nFREEDOM Soy Wax is built from a low-melt soy wax that improves adhesion and reduces frosting in candles. It will generally melt in the 115°F range. The low-melt properties make it a great wax for northern climates or winter pours, though the lower melting temperatures can sometimes cold-flow (melt in shipping) when shipped in summer months.\n\nWeight N/A Dimensions N/A Package Size\n\n5 lb bag, 1/2 pallet–900lb skid, 10 lb bag, 25 lb box, 45 lb bag, 1800 lb skid\n\nYou may also like…\n\nSoy Wax\n\nM-100 Ultimate Melt, Tart, and Votive Beads\n\nRated 5.00 out of 5\n\n$21.00 – $124.00 Select options This product has multiple variants.
