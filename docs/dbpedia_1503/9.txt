Who is Bob Godshall?!

Born in Texas, raised in Philadelphia, I moved to New Mexico in 1976 and, except for the 3 years I spent with the U.S. Border Patrol in Sierra Blanca, Tx., this state has been my home ever since.

I'm retired from the Department of Homeland Security after a 28 year career with Federal Law Enforcement. That career began after I completed a Bachelor of Arts degree program in Political Science at the University of New Mexico in 1980. In the course of my time at UNM, I postponed my studies temporarily in order to put together a financial foundation from which to continue. I know from that experience what it's like to be poor.

I became politically active in Albuquerque in 2012 volunteering for a number of Republican candidates ranging from Janice Arnold-Jones, Larry Larranaga, and Wayne Johnson to Brook Bassan, among others. During this time, I have knocked on thousands of doors and spoken to countless people, many of whom are in District 27.

I have spoken to many of you about your frustrations and your hopes for this state and this country and, believe me, I can relate.
