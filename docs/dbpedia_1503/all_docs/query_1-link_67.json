Five are new projects for this year; seven projects have been completed in their third and final TDEA-funded year. As a result of their TDEA-funded projects, investigators have published thirty-four papers in professional journals, proceedings, or Los Alamos reports and presented their work at professional meetings. Supplemental funds and in-kind contributions, such as staff time, instrument use, and work space, were also provided to TDEA-funded projects by organizations external to ESH Division.},\n\ndoi = {10.2172/780910},\n\nurl = {https://www.osti.gov/biblio/780910}, journal = {},\n\nnumber = ,\n\nvolume = ,\n\nplace = {United States},\n\nyear = {Fri Dec 01 00:00:00 EST 2000},\n\nmonth = {Fri Dec 01 00:00:00 EST 2000}\n\n}"
