        "text": "A Time to Give Thanks!\n\nI want to thank our entire school community for all the support and sacrifice provided throughout this first semester. Without your selfless acts of kindness and compassion, we would not have the opportunity to celebrate all the amazing accomplishments, nor would we reach the levels of success that make us all so proud to be Explorers!\n\nI am most impressed with the hard work and determination of our Marist Educators. I am inspired by their team efforts as we have achieved our goals and exceeded expectations! We are strong, loyal, and dedicated. It is the Marist spirit that drives our mission and encourages us to build relationships with one another. Together, we foster a culture of integrity, inclusion, discipline, and respect. As we begin a New Year and a new semester, may we remain resilient in our actions and steadfast in our faith!\n\nMay God continue to bless the Christopher Columbus High School community and protect us as we move forward...Adelante!\n\nSenior Exchange Day with Carrollton\n\nWe held our first-ever Senior Exchange Day with Carrolton School of the Sacred Heart on December 1st, hosted by SAC.
