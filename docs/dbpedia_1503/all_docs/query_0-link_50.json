My wife, Rebecca, and daughter, Alivia, are thrilled to be a part of the Cherry & White. We look forward to representing this community with incredible pride.\"\n\nA 2006 Penn State alumnus, Fisher was instrumental in helping the Nittany Lions win five straight games before falling to #5 Purdue, 67-65, in the finals of the Big Ten tournament. Penn State would earn an at-large bid to the 2023 NCAA Tournament and, as the #10-seed, defeated seven-seed Texas A&M (76-59) before ending its season against second-seed Texas (71-66).\n\nIn 2021-22, his first year under then coach Micah Shrewsberry, he helped guide the Nittany Lions to a number of statement wins and a thrilling postseason run in the Big Ten Tournament. Penn State owned the best scoring defense in the Big Ten, as the Nittany Lions allowed just 65.0 points per game – Penn State's best defensive mark in 11 years.\n\nA Jamison, Pa. native, he was integral in signing the highest ranked recruiting class in Penn State men's basketball history in November 2021, less than eight months into Shrewsberry's tenure in Happy Valley. The 2022 signing class ranked as a consensus top-30 class in the nation by all major recruiting services.\n\nFisher was also invited to participate in TopConnect 2021, the national networking program for the nation's top assistant coaches.\n\nPrior to his return to Penn State, Fisher served as an assistant coach at the University of Miami where was key to one of the most successful spans in Hurricane basketball history. The Hurricanes recorded four-straight 20-win seasons and four-straight postseason appearances from 2014-15 through 2017-18 with NBA Draft selections in three consecutive years and numerous All-Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) accolades during Fisher's tenure.\n\nThe four consecutive postseason berths included Miami's trip to the NCAA Sweet 16 in 2015-16, a season that witnessed victories over five ranked teams and 13 conference wins to tie for second in the ACC. The 2016-17 and 2017-18 seasons added to the Hurricanes' successful run with NCAA Tournament appearances, a 10-0 mark to start the 2017-18 season and then a top-three finish in the 2018 ACC standings.\n\nFisher was part of a Miami coaching staff that was one of only two ACC programs (Duke) to produce NBA Draft picks in consecutive years in 2017, 2018 and 2019. Two Hurricanes, Lonnie Walker IV, a first-round selection, and Bruce Brown Jr., a second-round pick, heard their names called in 2018. Dewan Hernandez was a 2019 NBA draftee.\n\nThose results followed the Hurricanes' efforts in bringing in top-15 recruiting classes in back-to-back seasons in 2016-17 and 2017-18. Walker was one of three ESPN Top 100 players to ink with Miami in 2017-18. Walker IV (ESPN No. 13), a McDonald's All-American and Jordan Brand Classic All-America guard, joined guard Chris Lykes (No. 48), forward Deng Gak (No. 94) and New Zealander Sam Waardenburg in the class, ranked top 10 by 247Sports, ESPN and Scout.\n\nIn 2016-17, the staff signed High School All-Americans Hernandez (McDonald's), Brown Jr. (Jordan Brand Classic), Australian standout Dejan Vasiljevic and Rodney Miller Jr. from national powerhouse Oak Hill Academy (Va.). Both Hernandez and Brown were consensus five-star, top-30 recruits.\n\nDuring Fisher's time in Coral Gables, the Hurricanes earned 20 all-conference laurels, including honors for sophomore guard Isaiah Wong as a member of the 2020-21 All-ACC third team and 2021 ACC All-Tournament Team. Davon Reed, earned third-team All-ACC and All-Defensive Team accolades, and was recognized for excellence on and off the court as the winner of the 2017 Skip Prosser Award. The Prosser Award is presented annually to the top scholar-athlete in ACC men's basketball. Reed went on to be selected 32nd overall in the 2017 NBA Draft by the Phoenix Suns.\n\nOther highlights included the Hurricanes' appearances in the Associated Press and USA Today Coaches polls with rankings in the top 10 and among the top 25, sell-out crowds at the Watsco Center, and the second triple-double in program history by Brown Jr. (11 points, 11 rebounds, 10 assists).\n\nMiami's 22 wins during the 2017-18 season included 11 conference victories and a third-place finish in ACC play. In 2016-17, Miami defeated three ranked teams, downing No. 9/6 North Carolina and No. 10/11 Duke in Coral Gables, as well as No. 18/19 Virginia on the road.\n\nMiami recorded 27 overall wins in 2015-16, its second-highest total in school history. Fisher and the basketball staff celebrated 2016 ACC Coach of the Year Jim Larrañaga as the Hurricanes ended the 2015-16 season ranked No. 10 by the Associated Press and No. 8 in the USA Today Coaches Poll after a school-record 18-straight weeks in the top 25 and 14 weeks in the top 15. The win total included five over ranked teams: No. 3 Virginia, No. 11 Louisville, No. 16 Utah, No. 22/20 Butler and No. 24/20 Duke.\n\nThe Canes posted, at the time, the second-most wins in program history with 25 in 2014-15. The win column included an impressive 16-point victory over fourth-ranked and eventual national champion Duke at Cameron Indoor Stadium as Miami was the only team to defeat the Blue Devils at home that year. Miami also defeated both No. 8/7 Florida and Syracuse on their home courts, two of Canes' 10 regular-season wins away from home. Postseason play added to the win total as Miami advanced to the NIT Championship game in Madison Square Garden.\n\nFisher joined the Hurricane program after gaining experience on the basketball staffs at Boston University and Penn State. As the director of basketball operations for Boston University for the 2009-10 and 2010-11 seasons, he helped the Terriers to back-to-back 21-win seasons and postseason appearances. BU won the 2011 America East Conference Championship and advanced to its first NCAA Tournament berth in nearly a decade. The previous year, the Terriers reached the semifinals of the 2010 CBI Tournament.\n\nIn 2011, Fisher returned to his alma mater as the Nittany Lions' video coordinator and was promoted to the director of player development position in 2012.\n\nFisher earned his master's degree in education leadership in 2009 while working as a graduate manager for Villanova under Jay Wright from 2007-09. During that time, the Wildcats reached the Sweet 16 in 2008 and won the East Regional in 2009 to advance to the Final Four with a then-school-record 30 wins.\n\nFisher graduated from Penn State with a bachelor's degree in kinesiology in 2006. While there, he worked for three seasons as head student manager and one season as a graduate manager. Fisher assisted with player workouts, handled administrative duties and helped with team travel.\n\nFisher and his wife, Rebecca, have a daughter, Alivia.\n\nWhat They are Saying About Adam Fisher\n\n\"First and foremost, I want to share how thrilled I am for Adam Fisher to be the new head coach at Temple, a fantastic program with excellent tradition. I have no doubt Adam will work tirelessly to not only live up to that standard but elevate it. He is a dynamic coach in so many ways. From a basketball standpoint, Adam is tremendous. His work with X's and O's is elite and he has a deep understanding of the game. As a recruiter, he has few peers on a national level. Adam has consistently excelled, in particular, at recruiting the Philadelphia area, which will assuredly serve him well as the head coach of the Owls. Most of all, though, Adam is a good person who relates to others and cares deeply about those around him. He is undoubtedly deserving of this opportunity, and I look forward to closely watching his success from afar.\" - Jim Larranaga, Miami Head Coach\n\n\"Coach Fisher is a tireless worker whose attention to detail is off the charts. With his combination of basketball acumen, relationships skills and eye for talent, his upside as a head coach is significant.\" - Calvin Booth, Denver Nuggets General Manager\n\n\"I am thrilled that Adam Fisher has been named the new men's basketball head coach at Temple. This is not only a great opportunity for Adam, but also a momentous occasion for his family and the entire Temple community. As a talented coach with a proven track record, Adam was instrumental in Penn State's success last season, and I have no doubt he will bring the same level of dedication and leadership to the Owls. Congratulations to Adam and his family, and I look forward to seeing the positive impact he will have on the Temple basketball program.\" - Micah Shrewsberry, Notre Dame Head Coach\n\n\"Adam is a true Philly guy - he respects the tradition of Philadelphia basketball. He was an enthusiastic, hard-working young assistant on our staff and went on to develop into an outstanding basketball coach with national experience. Our Villanova Basketball Family is proud of Adam and knows Temple basketball has a bright and visionary leader at the helm!\" – Jay Wright, former Villanova Head Coach"
