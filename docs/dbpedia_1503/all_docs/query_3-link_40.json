The goal of the conspiracy was to misrepresent the state of completion of four ethanol plants (Clovis I through Clovis IV) that had to be placed in service by December 31, 1982, in order for partnerships which purchased the plants to take advantage of investment and energy tax credits. Numerous steps were taken by defendant and his co-conspirators to hide the plants' true completion status. Knowing that the plants were not available to be placed in service by the end of 1982, and that the partnerships were not entitled to claim the investment and energy tax credits for the 1982 tax year, defendant and his co-conspirators caused partnership returns and individual income tax returns to be filed that falsely represented that the partnerships and investors were entitled to claim said credits.\n\nFollowing his conviction, defendant filed a motion for new trial based on alleged newly discovered evidence and a motion for reconsideration raising additional alleged newly discovered evidence. Defendant appeals from the judgment of conviction and the orders denying his motion for new trial and reconsideration.\n\nPursuant to Local Rule 8(g) of this Court's rules, the United States, appellee herein, respectfully informs the Court that it believes that oral argument of 20 minutes per side would be helpful to the Court in considering this case.\n\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\n1. On September 16, 1987, following a three-week jury trial in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri (Honorable Howard F. Sachs, presiding), Thomas W. Tierney (defendant) was convicted on one count of conspiring to defraud the United States by impeding and impairing the lawful functions of the Department of Treasury in the ascertainment and collection of income taxes, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 371, and fifteen counts of aiding and assisting in the preparation and presentation of false partnership and individual income tax returns, in violation of 26 U.S.C. 7206(2). 1 (Doc. 1.) 2 Defendant was acquitted on Counts Seventeen through Twenty-Two of the indictment, which charged securities fraud, in violation of 15 U.S.C. 78j(b) and 78ff (Counts Seventeen through Twenty); and insider stock trading, in violation of 15 U.S.C. 78j(b) and 78ff (Counts Twenty-One and Twenty-Two). (Id.)\n\nOn January 5, 1988, defendant was sentenced, on Counts One through Fifteen, to serve a prison term of three years. (Doc. 134.) On Count Sixteen, imposition of sentence was suspended, and defendant was placed on two years' probation, to begin upon his release from imprisonment on all state and federal charges. (Doc. 134.) Defendant was also fined $10,000 on Count One and ordered to pay the costs of prosecution. (Id.)\n\nDefendant filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of conviction (No. 88-1111WM); the case was briefed by both parties; and, on November 16, 1988, oral argument was presented to the Honorable Judges J. Smith Henley, Theodore McMillian, and Pasco M. Bowman. Thereafter, defendant filed a motion for new trial based on alleged newly discovered evidence. On January 20, 1989, this Court dismissed defendant's appeal from the judgment of conviction, without prejudice, and remanded the case to the District Court. The District Court denied the motion for new trial (Doc. 200) and a subsequent motion for reconsideration (Doc. 209). Defendant then filed a timely notice of appeal from the court's order denying his motion for reconsideration of the order denying his motion for new trial.\n\n2. The District Court's jurisdiction arose under 18 U.S.C. 3231.\n\n3. The judgment of the District Court was entered on January 5, 1988. (Doc. 134.) Defendant filed a timely notice of appeal on January 14, 1988 (No. 88-1111WM). (Doc. 136.) The orders of the District Court denying defendant's motion for new trial and for reconsideration were entered on August 1, 1989 (Doc. 200), and August 30, 1989 (Doc. 209). Defendant filed a notice of appeal from these orders on September 11, 1989. (Doc. 211.) Jurisdiction for this appeal lies under 28 U.S.C. 1291.\n\nSTATEMENT OF THE ISSUES\n\n1. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by denying defendant's motion for new trial and motion for reconsideration.\n\nOn this issue, the appellee relies upon the following authorities:\n\nReese v.

The plan, and steps taken, to build and sell ethanol plants\n\nDuring 1982, defendant, Ronald Walker and Carl Wright became the management team responsible for running Midwestern Fuel Systems (Midwestern), a company involved in building and selling ethanol plants. (Tr. 120, 126, 1115-1116, 1284-1285, 1549-1551, 1682, 2962-2976, 3004-3006.) 3 The management team determined that Clovis, New Mexico, was the best plant location because New Mexico offered the highest fuel tax incentives (Tr. 129-130, 873-876), and they decided to sell the plants to partnerships as tax shelter investments (Tr. 126-129, 876-881). Ronald Walker became executive vice-president of Midwestern and held that position until May, 1983, when he took over as president. (Tr. 125.) Carl Wright was given the title of secretary/treasurer. (Tr. 847, 861.) Defendant became general counsel. (Tr. 3062-3063, 3071-3072.) 4 Defendant and Walker each owned over a hundred thousand shares of Midwestern stock. (Tr. 119-122, 857, 887-888.) Wright also owned a substantial number of shares. (Tr. 887-888.)\n\nIn June, 1982, Midwestern acquired Titan Energy Engineering, Inc. (Tr. 869-872, 1276-1278.) Titan Energy was formed by Larry Kruzie, Ken Sinks and Jack Redd. (Tr. 869-870, 3314-3315.) Titan Energy had the rights to ethanol plant design processes owned by Sinks and Redd, who had some previous experience building ethanol plants. (Tr. 863, 869-872, 1274-1278.) The legal documents for the acquisition were prepared by defendant, and the transaction occurred in his office. (Tr. 870-871, 3316-3317.)\n\nIn early October, 1982, defendant and Walker met with Larry Skelley, a general contractor, to discuss building two ethanol plants. (Tr. 1120-1126.) They indicated that the plants needed to be complete and operational by the end of the year in order for the investors to take advantage of the tax credits. (Tr. 1122-1126.) Skelley said he would do his best to meet that target date. (Id.)\n\nShortly thereafter, Skelley was notified by Sinks to proceed with construction. (Tr. 1126-1127.) Skelley received written authority to proceed by letter dated October 21, 1982. (Tr. 1126-1129; G. Ex. 202.) The letter authorized construction of three plants: it was signed by Sinks and copies were sent to Walker and defendant. (Id.) 5\n\n2. The planned tax benefit\n\nThere were requirements which had to be met before investors in an ethanol plant could receive tax benefits. First, the plant had to be \"placed in service\" by December 31, 1982. (Tr. 1800-1801, 1819-1820; G. Ex. 255.) Second, the investors were required to assume the risks and burdens of ownership by December 31, 1982. (Tr. 1800-1801, 1804.) In other words, the investor was required to be \"at risk\" for 25% of the purchase price of the asset. (Id.) Finally, the purchase price of the plant had to reflect the economic value of the assets purchased. (Tr. 1801.) Under Treas. Reg. Section 1.46-3, the phrase \"placed in service,\" as it relates to the ethanol plants, means ready to produce ethanol. (Tr. 1801-1802, 1820.) It is not sufficient that the component parts of the plant be on the plant site; rather, the plant must be ready to perform its assigned function. (Tr. 1803, 1820-1821.) Defendant, Walker and Wright knew of these requirements. (Tr. 155-156, 248-250, 892-897, 928-929.)\n\nThe management team estimated that the total building cost of the plants would be approximately $1,000,000 to 1,200,000. (Tr. 140, 1291.) They decided to sell the plants for $3,500,000 apiece (Tr. 136-140), requiring the investors to make a cash down payment of $675,000 (Tr. 149-150). The remaining obligation would be covered by a $200,000 recourse note and a $2,625,000 non-recourse note. (Tr. 149-151; G. Ex. 225.) Because the investors would presumably be entitled to claim investment tax credits of 10 percent and energy investment tax credits of 10 percent on the properties acquired, they would be entitled to deduct $675,000 in tax credits from the tax due and owing on their 1982 income tax returns. (Tr. 151-155, 953-956.) Thus, they would be entitled to deduct tax credits, in the same tax year the money was invested, that would equal the cash down payment. At the same time, investors would allegedly be \"at risk\" for 25% of the cost (the $675,000 cash down payment plus the $200,000 recourse note), as required in order to claim the tax credits.\n\n3. Plant construction begins and the plants are sold\n\nDefendant prepared the purchase orders for the four ethanol plants known as Clovis I through Clovis IV. 6 (Tr. 895, 3109-3110; G. Exs. 6-9.) 7 Those orders provided that the seller was required to deliver a \"fully operational plant\" with all the \"equipment and component parts fully installed and operational\" and that if the seller failed to do so, the buyer was entitled to rescind the contract. (Tr. 162-164; G. Exs. 6-9.) The purchase orders for Clovis I and Clovis II defined operational as having been run continuously for 96 hours, and having produced, during that period, at least 2,400 gallons of 198+ proof ethanol. (Id.) The purchase orders for all four plants also contained the warranty that the plant would produce at least 3,000 gallons per day of 198+ proof ethanol, on a continuous basis, within 90 days of delivery. (G. Exs. 6-9.) 8\n\nThe sales agreements for Clovis I through Clovis IV, dated December 29, 1982, were also prepared by defendant. (Tr. 165, 3109.) Those documents contained the financing provisions outlined on pages 3-4, supra. (G. Exs. 22-25.) They indicated that the sellers were in possession of complete and operational plants. (Tr. 165-166.)\n\n4. The plants are not \"available to be placed in service\" by December 31, 1982, but the management team conceals the true completion status of the plants\n\nDuring December, 1982, defendant and Carl Wright discussed the need to present the Internal Revenue Service with some form of documentation indicating that the ethanol plants were complete or available to be placed in service. (Tr. 959-962.) As a result of the conversation, Ken Sinks hired Paul Liscom, a chemical engineer, to visit the plants in New Mexico and certify their completion status. (Tr. 1450-1451.) Sinks said that Midwestern required someone not associated with the company to perform the inspection; and, although Liscom told Sinks that he was not qualified to do the job, Liscom eventually agreed to inspect the plants. (Tr. 1450-1453.)\n\nOn December 28 or 29, 1982, defendant called the Titan Energy office in Farmington, New Mexico, and spoke with the office manager, Myra Grayson. (Tr. 1264, 1269-1270.) Defendant told Grayson that he was going to telecopy a document to the Farmington office, which the engineer was supposed to sign, certifying the plants as operational. (Tr. 1264-1265.) After receiving the document, Grayson dictated its contents over the phone to Cheryl Kruzie in Clovis. (Tr. 1265-1266.) This procedure was followed because defendant told Grayson that the document had to be in Clovis that day. (Tr. 1266.)\n\nOn December 29, 1982, Liscom took a chartered plane to Roswell, New Mexico. (Tr. 1453.) Liscom and Ken Sinks inspected the Roswell plant, then returned to Clovis, arriving at about 5:00 or 5:30 p.m. (Tr. 1339-1342, 1454-1456.) Liscom, accompanied by Larry Skelley, the general contractor (Big Horn Construction Company), first toured the fabrication shop, located approximately five miles from the plant sites. (Tr. 1457-1460.) There, he inventoried the equipment, some of which was still in crates. (Tr. 1460.) After spending approximately thirty minutes at the shop, Liscom and Skelley toured the four Clovis plants. (Tr. 1460-1461.) There was no power at any of the plants, and the two men used flashlights to see inside some of the buildings. (Tr. 1457-1458.) At Clovis IV, truck headlights were used to illuminate the inside of the plant. (Tr. 1458-1459.) Liscom testified that all the plants were still under construction; the utilities were not hooked up; the piping was incomplete; and various components had not been installed. (Tr. 1461.) Not one of the four plants had been operated, and none were capable at that time of producing ethanol at design capacity (i.e., 3000 gallons per day of 198 proof ethanol). (Tr. 1461-1462, 1523-1525.)\n\nLiscom was taken to Larry Kruzie's house after completing his inspection. There, Sinks gave him the documents drafted by defendant certifying the plants as operational, and asked Liscom to sign them. (Tr. 1462.) Liscom refused to sign the certificates, which indicated that the plants were operational. (Tr. 1462-1463.) Following this refusal, Sinks called Ronald Walker in Joplin and he, in turn, called defendant. (Tr. 292-294, 1463-1464.) Sinks then turned over the phone to Liscom. (Tr. 1464.) Liscom testified that defendant appeared to be aware of the status of the plants and described defendant as being defensive about the terms in the certificates. (Tr. 1464-1465, 1505.) Liscom stated that he thought the certificates were misleading and that defendant gave him definitions of the terms used in the certificates, citing case law. (Tr. 1464-1465.) Liscom eventually agreed to sign the certificates, on the condition that he attach the definitions provided by defendant as a glossary. (Tr. 1466-1467.) New certificates for each of the plants were prepared, with the glossaries appended to each certificate, and Liscom signed the certificates that same evening. (Tr. 1467-1468, 1475-1476; G. Exs. 54-57.) 9\n\nLiscom's story regarding the inspection, his reaction to the certificate prepared by defendant, and his subsequent conversation with defendant, was confirmed in various aspects by both Larry Skelley (Tr. 1155-1161) and Ken Sinks (Tr. 1336-1353, 1358-1362). 10 At trial, Skelley described the Liscom certification process as \"a joke.\" (Tr. 1195.) Ronald Walker testified that he did receive a phone call from Sinks and that he called defendant, who subsequently spoke with Liscom. (Tr. 292-295, 579-581.) Walker stated that Liscom indicated what he wanted added to the glossary, and defendant replied, \"Fine.\" (Tr. 294-295.)\n\nIn January, 1983, defendant, Walker and Carl Baron (Midwestern's management accountant) made a trip to the Clovis site because Sinks had indicated they were going to do a \"start-up\" or \"shakedown run\" on one or more of the plants. (Tr. 271-273.) Walker testified that the operation was a complete disaster. (Tr. 272-274.)\n\nDuring that same trip, Skelley approached Walker in one of the Clovis airport buildings and requested payment of a $40,000 completion bonus. (Tr. 272, 1168-1170.) 11 Skelley made the request, although the plants had not produced even 190 proof ethanol, because Walker had been telling the public that the plants were complete. (Tr. 1169-1170, 1245-1247.) Walker became angry and refused to pay Skelley since, he said, the plants were not complete. (Tr. 275-279, 1169-1170.) Defendant then tolk Walker never to make such statements because they could not take the position that the plants were incomplete. (Tr. 276, 1170, 1248.) Defendant took Walker aside and said they would discuss the issue later. (Tr. 282.) Defendant later instructed that Skelley be paid (Tr. 1246), and, on January 27, 1983, Skelley was paid $40,000 (Tr. 1248-1249). At that time, none of the Clovis plants had produced even 190 proof ethanol. (Tr. 1249.)\n\nShortly after the meeting at the Clovis airport, and continuing through January and into February, defendant, Walker and Wright had telephone conversations regarding whether to inform the partnerships that the plants were not complete and that they could not properly claim the tax credits for the 1982 tax year. (Tr. 286-290, 942-945, 958-959.) They decided not to inform the partnerships regarding the status of completion. (Tr. 286-289, 944-946.) Defendant said, in effect, that it would be \"stupid and dangerous\" to tell the investors that they could not take the tax credits. (Tr. 288-289.)\n\nDefendant, Walker and Wright also discussed how they would leave a paper trail giving the appearance that the plants were complete. (Tr. 268-270, 274-276, 286-288, 314-316.) They decided that any additional construction necessary to complete the plants would be categorized as warranty work instead of completion costs. (Tr. 276-279, 282-283, 306-307, 974-975, 1572-1575.) In addition, Wright suggested that they utilize the practice of \"pre-billing.\" (Tr. 268-269, 1544-1546, 1645.) In other words, Titan Energy Engineering would be issued bills dated 1982 for work and material provided in 1983. (Tr. 268, 519-520, 971-972, 1370-1371.) Big Horn Construction Company was subsequently requested by Carl Baron to instruct its suppliers and subcontractors to submit bills before the material was delivered or the work done. (Tr. 1175-1176, 1225-1226, 1545-1546.) Defendant was aware of the pre-billing activity by at least March, 1983. (Tr. 1547-1549, 1654-1657, 1662.) 12 These actions were all taken to give the impression that the plants were complete by December 31, 1982. (Tr. 303-304, 971-973, 1371-1372, 1543-1546, 1558-1559.)\n\n5. Testimony regarding the completion status of the plants\n\nSeveral witnesses testified that the ethanol plants, Clovis I through Clovis IV, were not complete for tax purposes by December 31, 1982. According to Larry Skelley, the general contractor with Big Horn Construction responsible for building all four plants, none of the four plants were completed by the end of 1982 and none had produced even one gallon of ethanol at that time. (Tr. 1151.) Skelley testified that each plant was four to eight weeks away from the shakedown period. (Tr. 1151-1152.) He said that it was not possible to put raw material in at one end of the plant and get the finished product at the other. (Tr. 1216.) Using pictures of the plants taken at the end of December, Skelley identified numerous factors confirming his opinion that the plants were not complete. (Tr. 1180-1191; G. Ex. 62.) Skelley also stated that no utilities (water, gas or electricity) were hooked up at any of the plants and that the plants would not run without the utilities. (Tr. 1180-1191, 1255-1256.)\n\nKen Sinks testified that none of the plants were capable of producing 190 or 198 proof ethanol by December 31, 1982, and that the plants were in various stages of completion at that time. (Tr. 1331-1335, 1441.) Sinks said that the plants would have been capable of producing some alcohol only through the use of temporary generators and hoses. (Tr. 1421, 1441-1443.) Carl Baron testified that none of the plants were operational or in place by the end of 1982. (Tr. 1546, 1559, 1640-1641.) He stated that he had been told that the plants would cost $1.2 million to complete, but that invoices adding only to $400,000-$500,000 per plant had been submitted by the end of 1982. (Tr. 1544-1546, 1640-1645.) Matthew Hofer, the operations manager of the plants beginning in mid-January, 1983, testified that production of 198 proof ethanol occurred for the first time in mid-February, 1983, at Clovis I. (Tr. 1695-1698.) The remaining plants first produced 198 proof ethanol at a later date. (1698-1699.) He further testified that, through 1983, none of the plants had produced 3,000 gallons of ethanol per day for a 72-hour period. (Tr. 1699.) 13\n\nBoth Wright (Tr. 944-945, 958-959) and Walker (Tr. 274-276, 286-290) testified that defendant knew that the plants were not available to be placed in service by the end of 1982, and, consequently, that the investors were not entitled to claim the tax credits in that year.\n\n6. False tax returns are prepared\n\nAfter Midwestern management decided not to inform the investors regarding the true status of the plants' completion (Tr. 286-290, 944-947), Wright prepared the partnership tax returns (Forms 1065) (Tr. 945-946). The returns were signed by Wright as preparer and were executed between February 11 and February 25, 1983. (Tr. 947-948; G. Exs. 135-138.) Wright then transmitted the returns to the general partners of each partnership. (Tr. 945-946.) The information used to prepare the returns was essentially taken from the sales agreements that were executed at the closings on the sales of the plants. (Tr. 946.)\n\nThe returns indicated that the investors were entitled to claim a total of $686,500 in energy and investment tax credits. (Tr. 945-946, 953.) Attached to the returns were Schedules K-1 reflecting each partner's share of income, losses or credits. (Tr. 948-951.) Those Schedules K-1 were transmitted to the individual investors, who used the schedules in the preparation of their individual income tax returns. (Tr. 951-953.) According to the schedules, each investor was entitled to a direct dollar-for-dollar reduction of the tax owed in the amount indicated as his pro rata share of investment and energy tax credits. (Tr. 953-954.) The returns also indicated that the investors were entitled to claim a $130,500 depreciation deduction. (Tr. 955-957.)\n\nAll the individual investors claimed, on their individual income tax returns, their pro rata shares of credits as reflected on the Schedules K-1. (Tr. 2463-2471.) Several of the investors testified that, in claiming the credits on their individual returns, they relied on defendant, the sales agreements, and the Schedules K-1. (Tr. 2120-2122, 2131-2141, 2832-2836, 2848-2851.)\n\n7. Midwestern misleads State of New Mexico investigators\n\nIn March, 1983, several grand jury subpoenas were issued in connection with an investigation of Midwestern conducted by the District Attorney's Office for Curry County, New Mexico. (Tr. 2419-2422.) A meeting regarding the investigation was held in April, 1983, with District Attorney David Bonem (now a state judge for the 9th Judicial District Court of New Mexico (Tr. 2418-2419)), John Tuthill, as local counsel for Midwestern, defendant, as general counsel, and Walker, as executive vice-president, in attendance. (Tr. 2424-2426.)\n\nDuring the meeting, defendant and Walker expressed their concern that a grand jury investigation would have a detrimental impact on the financial condition of the company. (Tr. 2428-2429.) Defendant stated that it could result in a decrease in the stock value of $2 to $3, and Walker stated that it could result in a $20,000,000 to $30,000,000 loss to the company. 14 Judge Bonem, in turn, stated that he was concerned about whether there were sufficient controls to guarantee that the industrial revenue bond funds were expended in the manner for which they were issued. (Tr. 2429-2430.) Defendant assured Judge Bonem that the plants were complete and operational by December 31, 1982, and that they had produced ethanol by that date. (Tr. 2431-2434.)\n\nAt the conclusion of the meeting, the District Attorney's Office agreed to withdraw the subpoenas, and Midwestern, in turn, agreed to voluntarily produce the information requested by the subpoenas. (Tr. 2434-2435.) Bonem testified that his decision to withdraw the subpoenas was largely based on defendant's presence at the meeting. (Tr. 2435-2436.) He stated that Walker, appearing on his own, would not have been granted much credibility. (Id.) 15\n\n8. Another cover-up: payments are not made on the investors' notes, and Midwestern makes no collection effort\n\nThe first payments on the non-recourse notes were due in May and June, 1983. (Tr. 990.) Those payments were not made because the plants were not producing enough ethanol to generate any income (Tr. 375-378, 382-383, 990-993.) And Midwestern did not make any attempt to collect on the recourse notes. (Tr. 382-383, 993-994, 1878.) 16\n\nIn the summer of 1983, Jack Redd delivered a report to various members of Midwestern's board of directors at defendant's office. (Tr. 390-394, 1001-1002.) He said that Clovis I through Clovis IV were not close to producing ethanol at design capacity and that an additional $5,000,000 was required to bring them to that level. (Id.)\n\nIn August, 1983, Lew Herman, an accountant with the firm of Wright, Herfordt and Sanders, met with defendant, who told him that the notes needed to be brought current. (Tr. 2230.) Herman sent out notices of payment, but no payments were made by the partnerships or Process Management Company (PMCI), a company set up to manage the plants. (Tr. 2230-2231.) To disguise the fact that payments were not forthcoming, accounting entries were made indicating that the notes were paid as of September 30, 1983. (Tr. 383, 1733-1734.) Midwestern issued a check to PMCI for $1,500,000. (Tr. 2269.) PMCI deposited that check and issued checks back to Midwestern, which Midwestern entered on its books as payments on the note obligations. (Tr. 2269-2271.) This was accomplished in October, 1983. (Tr. 2269.) Defendant was aware that these activities were taking place. (Tr. 383, 2268-2272.)\n\nLater, Carl Baron brought various activities of Midwestern's management team to the attention of Peat, Marwick and Mitchell (PMM), the accounting firm hired to act as Midwestern's independent auditor. (Tr. 767-770, 1539, 1683-1684.) PMM subsequently resigned as Midwestern's auditor. Defendant resigned from the board of directors on March 26, 1984. (Tr. 3286.) Walker resigned shortly after, in late March, 1984. (Tr. 421.) Wright resigned on April 2, 1984. (Tr. 1022.) Midwestern Companies declared bankruptcy on May 25, 1984 (Tr. 422-423), and subsequently defaulted on each of the industrial revenue bonds (Tr. 651-652). 17\n\n9. Expert testimony\n\nDavid Buchmueller, an Internal Revenue Service group manager specializing in the examination of tax shelter returns, testified that his investigation disclosed that Midwestern was marketing abusive tax shelters. (Tr. 1821.) That conclusion was based on his determination that the ethanol plants were grossly overvalued (Tr. 1804-1805, 1821); 18 the plants were not placed in service in 1982 (Tr. 1821); and, the investors were not at risk for 25% of the purchase price (Tr. 1821-1826). 19\n\nARGUMENT\n\nI\n\nTHE DISTRICT COURT DID NOT ABUSE ITS DISCRETION BY DENYING DEFENDANT'S MOTIONS FOR NEW TRIAL AND RECONSIDERATION\n\nA. Defendant's argument\n\nDefendant contends (Br. 9-23) that five Government witnesses, Ronald Walker, Kenneth Sinks, Larry Skelley, Paul Liscom, and Thomas Jackson (an administrative assistant and pilot for Midwestern), testified falsely at his trial and that the testimony of these witnesses damaged his credibility in the eyes of the jury. The alleged newly discovered evidence that defendant addresses on appeal, and his allegations of perjury, relate to two separate topics: (1) trial testimony with respect to a December 29, 1982, telephone call regarding documents certifying that the Clovis ethanol plants were operational; and (2) the testimony of Thomas Jackson and Ronald Walker regarding defendant's presence at the ethanol plant sites during the latter part of December, 1982. 20\n\nOn appeal, defendant alleges that, following his trial, he uncovered evidence which proves that the aforementioned telephone call never took place. Some of the records which constitute the basis for defendant's claim were discovered by defendant at the offices of Blackwell, Sanders, the law firm representing the insurance company that carried Midwestern's directors' and officers' liability insurance. (Br. 14.) Blackwell, Sanders maintains a document repository containing hundreds of thousands of pages of documents which it obtained from Midwestern following Midwestern's declaration of bankruptcy. (Br. 14.) Other records were obtained by serving a subpoena duces tecum on the telephone company. (Br. 17.)\n\nThe second basis for defendant's argument on appeal that the District Court erroneously denied his motion for new trial involves testimony of Tom Jackson that he, defendant and Walker visited the Clovis plant sites several times in late December, 1982. At trial, defendant denied visiting the plant sites at any time in December, 1982. (Tr. 3116-3118.) Defendant asserts (Br. 19-21) that newly discovered evidence establishes that neither Walker nor Jackson was present at the Clovis plant sites during that time.\n\nB. The District Court's orders denying defendant's motion for new trial and motion for reconsideration\n\nOn August 1, 1989, the District Court, following a hearing, denied defendant's motion for new trial. The court held that the evidence regarding Jackson's testimony did not constitute newly discovered evidence since: \"(1) its nature was simply additional impeachment; (2) the evidence was on a collateral issue and would not 'probably produce an acquittal'; and (3) the delay in discovery is not compellingly excusable.\" (Doc. 200 at 3.) The trial court also determined that, assuming the flight log introduced into evidence at trial was false, there was no knowing or reckless presentation of perjury by the prosecution. (Id. at 3-4.) With respect to the telephone billing records, the court held that the records did not disprove the telephone call. (Id. at 6.) Furthermore, the court concluded that defendant failed to show that the prosecutors knowingly or negligently used perjured testimony regarding the call. (Id. at 5.)\n\nDefendant's motion for reconsideration was denied on August 30, 1989. In that order, the court held that, even assuming that defendant did not participate in the December, 1982, telephone conversation, there was \"almost equally dramatic\" evidence of defendant's guilt. (Doc. 209 at 5.) The court reiterated its belief that the prosecution had not knowingly or negligently used perjured testimony relating to the telephone conversation and, moreover, that it was \"not reasonably well satisfied\" that perjury had even been committed. (Id. at 9 n.6, 11.)\n\nC. The District Court did not abuse its discretion by denying defendant's motions for new trial and reconsideration\n\nIn order to prevail on a motion for new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence, a defendant must establish five elements or prerequisites (United States v. Begnaud, 848 F. 2d 111, 113 (8th Cir. 1988)):\n\n(1) the evidence must be in fact newly discovered, that is, discovered since the trial; (2) facts must be alleged from which the court may infer diligence on the part of the movant; (3) the evidence relied upon must not be merely cumulative or impeaching; (4) it must be material to the issues involved; and (5) it must be of such nature that, on a new trial, the newly discovered evidence would probably produce an acquittal.\n\n\"'The grant or denial of a motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence is within the broad discretion of the trial court, and the trial court's decision will not be reversed absent a clear abuse of discretion.'\" United States v. Begnaud, 848 F. 2d at 113, quoting United States v. Massa, 804 F. 2d 1020, 1022 (8th Cir. 1986); accord United States v. Dawn, 897 F. 2d 1444, 1449 (8th Cir. 1990); United States v. Estabrook, 774 F. 2d 284, 290 (8th Cir. 1985). The District Court correctly determined that defendant was not entitled to a new trial.\n\n1. The telephone records\n\nDefendant contends that the telephone records prove that he did not take part in the December 29, 1982, telephone call regarding the Liscom certificates and, in addition, that the testimony of Walker, Liscom, Sinks and Skelley regarding his participation in the telephone conversation was false. Contrary to defendant's assertion, however, the phone records do not completely rebut the Government's proof that defendant participated in the telephone conversation on December 29. The records merely support the assertion that no telephone call was placed from Walker's home or office to defendant's home or office. But that fact would not conclusively negate the conversation at issue. Quite simply, it is entirely possible that, with the passage of time, the witnesses forgot exactly where defendant and Walker were when they were reached by phone. Thus, the records serve only to refute portions of the testimony provided by Liscom, Walker and Sinks. \"Newly discovered evidence which serves only to refute testimony of a government witness is impeaching, as that term is employed in the new trial standard.\" United States v. Estabrook, 774 F. 2d at 290. As such, it is not sufficient to compel granting a new trial. United States v. Widgery, 674 F. 2d 710, 713 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 894 (1982). 21\n\nMoreover, defendant has failed to show, with respect to the evidence recovered from the repository, that the evidence could not have been discovered with due diligence. 22 In essence, defendant asserts that both the state and federal prosecutors were, or should have been, aware of other documents in the repository, about which they were under some obligation to notify him. 23 Both the state (Tr. Motion 187-189) and federal (Tr. Motion 155-156) prosecutors testified that they spent a minimal amount of time reviewing records at the repository and, moreover, that all documents retrieved from the repository were made available to defendant (Id. at 167-168, 220). The prosecutors were not required, as defendant seems to suggest, to review all the documents in the repository and determine whether there were any records which might help defendant's case. \"It is well settled that the government has no affirmative obligation to discover potentially exculpatory information which it neither possesses nor of which it was aware.\" United States v. Dunn, 851 F. 2d 1099, 1101 (8th Cir. 1988); accord United States v. Driver, 798 F. 2d 248, 251-252 (7th Cir. 1986); United States v. Beaver, 524 F. 2d 963, 966 (5th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 425 U.S. 905 (1976). Since the records were available from a neutral source, to which defendant had access, defendant cannot show that the prosecutors suppressed the evidence or failed to disclose its existence. Reese v. Frey, 801 F. 2d 348, 350 (8th Cir. 1986). 24\n\nFinally, defendant is not entitled to a new trial because, as the District Court determined, there was ample evidence to uphold defendant's conviction, even without proof of defendant's participation in the telephone conversation.\n\nThe Government introduced evidence regarding the conversation as proof that defendant knew that the Clovis plants were not \"available to be placed in service\" by December 31, 1982. There was overwhelming evidence, aside from the conversation, that defendant knew the plants were not complete and operational and that he and the other conspirators acted to hide the fact of noncompletion.\n\nFor example, Larry Skelley testified that defendant was present at a meeting in Clovis in early October, 1982, at which time Skelley was hired to build the plants. (Tr. 1120-1123.) At that meeting, Skelley informed defendant and Walker that it would normally take four months to finish two plants, but working double shifts, he could possibly complete the plants by the end of the year. (Tr. 1125-1126.) By letter dated, October 21, 1982, Skelley was authorized to begin construction on three plants. (Tr. 1126-1129.) A copy of the letter was sent to defendant. (Tr. 1129.) Midwestern then decided to purchase a fourth plant, already under construction, and hired Skelley to complete construction of that plant by December 31, 1982. (Tr. 1130-1132.) In late November, 1982, Skelley told defendant that it would be virtually impossible to complete construction of the fourth plant by the year's end. (Tr. 1132-1133.) Thus, defendant was on notice, prior to the end of the year, that the time frame involved was critically short.\n\nFurther, defendant's conduct, beginning in January, 1983, established beyond any doubt that defendant was aware that the plants were not complete and operational by the end of 1982, and that he sought to hide that fact from the partnerships.\n\nPrior to the preparation of the tax returns, Walker and defendant travelled to Clovis in January, 1983, because Ken Sinks indicated the contractor was going to do a \"startup\" or \"shakedown\" run on some of the plants. (Tr. 271-273.) Walker testified that the startup was a \"disaster.\" (Tr. 272-274.) That same day, while at the Clovis airport, Larry Skelly approached Walker and asked for the completion bonus the parties had previously negotiated. (Tr. 272-276, 1169-1170.) Walker replied that Skelley would not get any bonus because the plants were not complete. (Id.) Skelley testified that defendant stated, \"Don't you ever say that again. Those plants were done and you are going to pay him.\" (Tr. 1170.) Walker testified that defendant then took him aside and told him it was not the appropriate time or place to discuss the completion status of the plants and they would discuss the completion bonus at a later time. (Tr. 276, 282-283.) Defendant subsequently told Walker that they were not going to tell anybody the plants were not complete. (Id.) Defendant said they could not take the position that the plants were not complete because, if they did, the investors would not be able to claim the tax credits. (Id.) Skelley was then paid the completion bonus (before the plants had produced even 190 proof ethanol). (Tr. 1173-1175, 1248-1249.)\n\nWalker and Wright both testified that they discussed with defendant the fact that the plants were not complete for tax purposes by December 31, 1982. (Tr. 267-268, 274-276, 942-945, 958-962.) Defendant and Walker discussed how they would leave a paper trail giving the appearance that the plants were complete. (Tr. 267-270, 274-276, 314-318, 644-647, 959-962, 974-975.)\n\nFollowing the January incident, defendant, Walker and Wright discussed whether they should inform the partnerships that the plants were not complete and that the partnerships could not properly claim the tax credits for the 1982 year. (Tr. 286-290, 306-308, 364-366, 942-954.) The three individuals decided that, even though the investors were not entitled to the credits, Wright should still prepare the partnership returns falsely reflecting the credits. (Tr. 286-290, 944-947.)\n\nDefendant, Walker and Wright also decided at this time to treat any additional construction necessary to complete the plants as warranty work instead of completion costs. (Tr. 276-283, 974-975, 1572-1574.) Moreover, Walker testified that, throughout 1983, defendant made additional trips to the plant sites and was sent the operating and performance records of the plants. (Tr. 646-647.) Defendant knew that, even by April, 1983, the plants were not producing ethanol as designed. (Tr. 319-320, 645-648.) In addition, at a meeting conducted in April, 1983, defendant assured the District Attorney's Office for Curry County, New Mexico, that the plants were complete and operational by December 31, 1982. (Tr. 2431-2432.) Defendant also represented that the general contractor (Skelley) had been paid a $40,000 bonus for completing the plants by December 31, 1982. (Tr. 2438-2440.)\n\nAccordingly, apart from defendant's participation in the certification process, there was overwhelming evidence that defendant was aware that the plants were not complete by the end of 1982 and that he helped to hide that fact from the partnerships. In view of this evidence, the existence of the telephone records does not create a likelihood of acquittal. Thus, defendant is not entitled to a new trial. United States v. Estabrook, 774 F. 2d at 290; United States v. Widgery, 674 F. 2d at 713; United States v. Dawn, 897 F. 2d at 1449; United States v. Ward, 544 F. 2d 975, 977-978 (8th Cir. 1976).\n\n2. Tom Jackson's testimony\n\nEvidence relating to Tom Jackson's testimony likewise does not warrant a new trial. To begin with, as the District Court correctly held, defendant's delay in discovering this evidence is not compellingly excusable. Defendant found the records in the document repository at Blackwell, Sanders. (Br. 19-20.) He had access to the repository prior to trial and, with due diligence, could have discovered the material before trial. Accordingly, defendant failed to meet the second prerequisite set forth by this Court in Begnaud, and denial of his motions for new trial was justified on this basis alone. United States v. Boschetti, 794 F. 2d 416, 419-420 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 889 (1986); United States v. Widgery, 674 F. 2d at 713.\n\nThis evidence also fails to meet the third element of the five-part test as it merely constitutes additional impeachment evidence. Jackson testified, referring to his flight log, that he, defendant and Walker flew to Clovis, New Mexico, on three occasions in late December, 1982. (Tr. 2044-2047, 2052-2057, 2067-2068.) Defendant argued at trial that the entries in the maintenance flight log were fabricated by Jackson and that it was physically impossible to make the flights indicated in the log within the time period noted. (Tr. 3117-3118.) Moreover, defendant called into question the accuracy of the maintenance flight log by pointing to Jackson's personal log, which was provided to defendant prior to trial and which was introduced as Defendant's Exhibit 13. (Tr. 2077.) Jackson's personal flight log did not contain the flight information contained in the maintenance log. (Tr. 2076-2081.) Defendant also questioned Jackson regarding his prior testimony before the Securities and Exchange Commission, at which time Jackson had stated that he was not in Clovis during the last week of December, 1982. (Tr. 2079.) In addition, defendant questioned Jackson, both on cross-examination and recross-examination, regarding whether the total flight time noted for the three trips could possibly be accurate. (Tr. 2076-2077, 2117-2118.) In sum, defendant was in possession of evidence, prior to trial, which was subject to the interpretation that Jackson had not flown defendant and Walker to Clovis during late December, 1982, and defendant confronted Jackson with that evidence at trial.\n\nThe additional evidence on which defendant now relies constitutes impeachment evidence and would have added little, if anything, to the impeachment evidence at trial. Thus, it would not be likely to result in an acquittal on retrial and is not sufficient to compel granting a new trial. United States v. Kienzle, 896 F. 2d 326, 330 (8th Cir. 1990); United States v. Ward, 544 F. 2d at 978; United States v. Begnaud, 848 F. 2d at 113. 25\n\nFinally, Jackson's testimony went to defendant's knowledge that the plants were not completed as of the end of 1982. As already discussed (pp. 23-26, supra), there was overwhelming evidence of defendant's knowledge. Therefore, there is no likelihood that the additional impeaching evidence would have altered the outcome of defendant's trial. 26\n\nII\n\nTHE PROSECUTOR'S PARTICIPATION BEFORE THE GRAND JURY AND AT TRIAL DID NOT VIOLATE 18 U.S.C. 208(a) OR RULE 6(d) OF THE FEDERAL RULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE\n\nA. Defendant's argument and the facts underlying his claim\n\nPrior to trial, defendant moved to dismiss the indictment, alleging that Rule 6(d), Fed. R. Crim. P., had been violated by the appearance of the prosecutor before the grand jury. Defendant asserted that the prosecutor's husband had a financial interest in the outcome of the trial and that her participation in the case therefore was barred by 18 U.S.C. 208(a). 27 Defendant now contends that the District Court's denial of the motion was error and, in addition, that the prosecutor's appearance during the trial requires reversal of his conviction. Defendant's position is devoid of merit.\n\nThe interest of the prosecutor's husband, defendant asserts, was derived from the following facts (Br. 24-26; Doc. 16, Affidavit of Benjamin F. Mann): (1) the prosecutor's husband is a partner in the law firm of Blackwell, Sanders, Matheny, Weary & Lombardi; (2) National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (National Union) insured the former officers and directors of Midwestern Companies, including defendant, under a Directors and Officers Liability Policy; (3) that Policy insured the officers and directors of Midwestern against claims made against them for \"wrongful acts\" committed in their official capacity; (4) several class actions, brought on behalf of Midwestern's shareholders, have been filed against the officers and directors of Midwestern, including defendant; (5) the law firm of Blackwell, Sanders was retained by National Union to commence a declaratory judgment action against the directors, officers and plaintiffs in the shareholder class actions seeking a rescission of the policy, or, alternatively, a determination that certain policy exclusions applied to the wrongful acts alleged; and (6) defendant's conviction will probably have some bearing on the rescission and coverage exclusion issues presented in the declaratory judgment action. 28\n\nBy virtue of these facts, defendant asserts that the prosecutor's spouse and his law firm had both a personal and financial interest in the outcome of these proceedings. As correctly determined by the District Court, however, these facts do not lead to the conclusion that the prosecutor or her husband had a financial interest in this case. 29\n\nB. The District Court's order denying defendant's pretrial motion\n\nIn its order denying defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment, the District Court, relying on United States v. Gorman, 807 F. 2d 1299 (6th Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 815 (1987), held that defendant was required to demonstrate a real possibility of gain or loss, not a mere speculative possibility of benefit. (Doc. 28 at 3.) The court concluded that \"the undisputed facts render the alleged financial interest so remote and speculative as to make the statute (18 U.S.C. 208(a)) inapplicable.\" (Id.) In arriving at its conclusion, the court made the following factual findings (Doc. 28 at 3-4):\n\nThe husband's law firm has a longstanding relationship with the insurer, is paid on an hourly basis, and is really no more likely to gain than to lose if the Tierney prosecution is successful. Viewed in its most optimistic light, the Tierney prosecution may conceivably lighten the load of litigation facing the insurer and reduce the law firm's fees. It is gross speculation to try to guess how, if at all, this prosecution would impact on the receipts of the husband's firm.\n\nC. Neither the prosecutor nor her husband had a financial interest in the outcome of this case\n\nDefendant contends that the District Court erroneously concluded that there was no real possibility of gain in this case. In support of his contention, he cites cases (Br. 33-36) addressing the issue, not of the appropriate circumstances mandating prosecutorial disqualification, but of the circumstances under which a judge must be disqualified due to a financial interest. Defendant asserts that those cases, which set forth the degree of financial and nonpecuniary interests mandating recusal or disqualification of judges, are equally applicable to the disqualification of prosecutors. This argument ignores the fundamental difference between the respective roles of the prosecutor and the judge, as well as the obvious distinction in the statutory provisions for disqualification. 30\n\nTo establish a violation of Section 208 in the context of the facts of this case requires proof both that the prosecutor's husband had a financial interest in the outcome of the case and that the prosecutor was aware of that financial interest. See United States v. Gorman, 807 F. 2d at 1303. Neither element is established on the record in this case.\n\nIn his brief on appeal, defendant fails to identify a single tangible benefit to the prosecutor's husband as a result of defendant's conviction in this case. The specific interests to which defendant points are (Br. 25) \"the potential for avoidance of liability for up to $35 million in claims by a valued client\"; \"indeterminate additional savings to be afforded said client under its other policies\"; and, \"the attendant benefits of an improved relationship with an existent client, enhanced reputation for both the partners and the firm, goodwill, and the ability to attract new business.\" But defendant points to nothing in the record remotely suggesting that the standing of Blackwell, Sanders with its client actually would have been affected by a conviction in this case. (See note 29, supra.) Thus, as the District Court correctly held, any financial interest which the prosecutor or her husband might derive from defendant's conviction was so remote and speculative as to render it non-existent.\n\nAs regards the second element required to prove a violation of Section 208(a), defendant has failed to even allege, much less show, that the prosecutor was aware of any financial interest on her husband's part. In light of the District Court's finding that any financial interest in this case was \"so remote and speculative as to make the statute inapplicable,\" it is clear that neither the prosecutor nor her husband was aware of any possibility of potential benefit to Blackwell, Sanders as a result of defendant's conviction. Accordingly, defendant has failed to allege the necessary facts to support his argument that the prosecutor's conduct in this case constitutes a violation of Section 208(a). He therefore has failed to show that the prosecutor's appearance before the grand jury was a violation of Rule 6(d), Fed. R. Crim. P., or that the prosecutor's participation at trial was improper. 31\n\nD. Even assuming the existence of a financial interest, defendant has failed to carry his burden of demonstrating any resultant prejudice\n\nEven assuming, arguendo, that facts in this case establish a financial interest sufficient to constitute a violation of Section 208(a) and, consequently, of Rule 6(d), Fed. R. Crim. P., defendant is not entitled to reversal of his conviction or dismissal of the indictment. Defendant asserts (Br. 37-40) that once a Rule 6(d) violation has been established, dismissal is warranted regardless of whether the prosecutorial misconduct is prejudicial. Defendant points to the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Mechanik, 475 U.S. 66 (1986). In that case, the Supreme Court held that, even assuming that a violation occurred, such violation did not require automatic reversal where there was no showing of prejudice. The Court ruled (United States v. Mechanik, 475 U.S. at 71-72):\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(a) provides that errors not affecting substantial rights shall be disregarded. We see no reason not to apply this provision to \"errors, defects, irregularities, or variances\" occurring before a grand jury just as we applied it to such error occurring in the criminal trial itself. (Citations omitted.)\n\nThe Court concluded that \"the petit jury's verdict rendered harmless any conceivable error in the charging decision that might have flowed from the violation.\" 475 U.S. at 73.\n\nDefendant, however, argues (Br. 37-40) that the Mechanik Court intended to preclude a harmless error review on appeal where, as here, a violation is brought to the attention of the trial court prior to trial. He bases this assertion on the Court's specific reservation of, in defendant's words, \"the question whether the effect of a Rule 6(d) violation on the charging decision which is properly brought to the attention of the trial court before trial, would produce the same result.\" (Br. 38.) 32 The Supreme Court has considered this precise question, however, and has held that even where the matter is raised prior to trial, \"a District Court may not dismiss an indictment for errors in the grand jury proceedings unless such error prejudiced the defendants.\" Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States, 487 U.S. 250, 254 (1988). Citing its previous decision in United States v. Mechanik, 475 U.S. at 78 (O'Conner, J., concurring), the Court held (487 U.S. at 256):\n\ndismissal of an indictment is appropriate only \"if it is established that the violation substantially influenced the grand jury's decision to indict,\" or if there is \"grave doubt\" that the decision to indict was free from the substantial influence of such violations.\n\nThus, the prosecutor's appearance before the grand jury, even if violative of Rule 6(d), did not warrant dismissal of the indictment in the absence of prejudice. Since the petit jury's verdict establishes that there was no prejudice, defendant is not entitled to dismissal.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision in Young v. United States, 481 U.S. 787 (1987), on which defendant relies (Br. 37, 39-40), does not lead to a contrary conclusion. A plurality opinion in Young 33 would only preclude harmless error analysis in the case of an actual conflict of interest, as existed in Young. 481 U.S. at 810-811. In the Opinion of the Court, it was held that \"(a)n arrangement represents an actual conflict of interest if its potential for misconduct is deemed intolerable.\" 481 U.S. at 807 n.18. For the reasons set forth above, any financial interest of the prosecutor or her husband in the outcome of this case was far too remote to give rise to a real, much less intolerable, potential for misconduct. Thus, there was no actual conflict of interest, and even under the plurality opinion in Young, the harmless error standard applies in this case.\n\nAs already discussed, the petit jury's verdict rendered any error in the prosecutor's appearing before the grand jury harmless. United States v. Mechanik, 475 U.S. at 66; United States v. McKie, 831 F. 2d 819, 821-822 (8th Cir. 1987); United States v. Kouba, 822 F. 2d 768, 773-774 (8th Cir. 1987); United States v. Hintzman, 806 F. 2d 840, 843 (8th Cir. 1986). Beyond that consideration, however, defendant has failed to prove that the prosecutor took any action affecting the grand jury's charging decision in order to further a personal financial interest. See Newman v. Frey, 873 F. 2d 1092, 1093-1094 (8th Cir. 1989) (mere appearance of impropriety does not violate due process where prosecutorial misconduct does not affect fairness of trial). Defendant does not allege that he would not have been investigated by the grand jury or indicted but for the prosecutor's activity in this case. Nor would the record support such a claim. 34 Thus, defendant has failed to establish any prejudice to the granding jury's charging decision resulting from the alleged misconduct of the prosecutor, and he is not entitled to dismissal of the indictment.\n\nHe likewise is not entitled to reversal of his conviction. He has failed to show that the prosecutor took any improper actions affecting the fairness of his trial. See Newman v. Frey, 873 F. 2d 1092.\n\nIII\n\nTHERE WAS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT DEFENDANT'S CONVICTIONS ON COUNTS 1 THROUGH 16 OF THE INDICTMENT\n\nDefendant contends (Br. 41-45) that there was insufficient evidence to support his convictions on Counts 1 through 16 of the indictment. His assertion is without merit.\n\nIn assessing the sufficiency of the evidence, this Court must determine whether a reasonable jury could \"have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the elements of the crime existed,\" Potter v. United States, 691 F. 2d 1275, 1281 (8th Cir. 1982), quoted in Smalley v. United States, 798 F. 2d 1182, 1188 (8th Cir. 1986). In so doing, the Court must \"view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, resolve evidentiary conflicts in favor of the government, and accept as established all reasonable inferences that may logically be drawn from the evidence.\" United States v. Newton, 756 F. 2d 53, 54 (8th Cir. 1985). The evidence need not \"exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence or be wholly inconsistent with every conclusion except that of guilt, provided a reasonable trier of fact could find that the evidence establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\" United States v. Bell, 678 F. 2d 547, 549 (5th Cir. 1982), aff'd, 462 U.S. 356 (1983).\n\nThe evidence in this case was clearly sufficient to establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant conspired to defraud the United States by impeding the Internal Revenue Service in its ascertainment, assessment and collection of income taxes. 35 In sum, the evidence demonstrated that defendant and his co-conspirators agreed to impede the IRS by misrepresenting the state of completion of four ethanol plants and passing excessive depreciation, investment and energy tax credits on to partnerships, thereby enabling the partners and investors to claim the credits on their income tax returns. 36\n\nDefendant contends (Br. 41-45) that the Government's evidence regarding whether the ethanol plants were \"placed in service\" within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Section 1.46-3(d), one of the prerequisites for claiming tax credits relating to the plants, was ambiguous. He asserts that, because the evidence regarding the definition of \"placed in service\" was ambiguous, the government was required to \"negat(e) any claim that any act, action or inaction on his part in reliance on his interpretation (of the phrase \"placed in service\") * * *, was motivated by something other than misunderstanding, honest inadvertence or mistake. (sic)\" (Br. 44.) Defendant's argument finds no basis in the record.\n\nFirst, the definition of the phrase \"available to be placed in service\" is clearly set forth in Treas. Reg. Section 1.46-3(d). The phrase means \"placed in a condition or state of readiness and availability for a specifically assigned function.\" In this case, the specifically assigned function of the plants was the production of 198 proof ethanol. The evidence and the trial court's instructions made this definition clear to the jury, and the evidence established that the plants were not available to be placed in service by December 31, 1982.\n\nDavid Buchmueller, an IRS group manager specializing in the review of tax shelter returns, testified that, as it relates to ethanol plants, the phrase \"available to be placed in service\" means \"ready to produce ethanol.\" (Tr. 1802.) To clarify, he used as an example the purchase of a new car, explaining that when the car is delivered to the customer and the customer \"gets in his car and turns on the key and drives it off, that is considered 'placed in service' for that individual * * *.\" (Tr. 1802-1803.) In addition, he explained that the regulation stipulates that maintainance of the component parts of the plants at or near the site was not sufficient to render the plants available to be placed in service. (Tr. 1803-1804.)\n\nThe trial court also gave the following instruction to the jury regarding the definition of \"placed in service\" (Transcript of instructions at pages 7-8):\n\nEthanol plants must be \"placed in service,\" as defined in these instructions, before they have reached a stage of completion to qualify for tax credits and depreciation in a particular year.\n\nProperty is placed in service in the taxable year in which the property is placed in a condition or \"state of readiness and availability for a specifically assigned function.\" Property consisting of operational equipment is in a state of readiness and availability for a specifically assigned function when it is acquired for use even though it's not practical to so use the equipment until the following year, or it is undergoing tests to eliminate any defects. However, materials and parts acquired to be used in the construction of an item of equipment shall not be considered in a condition or state of readiness and availability for a specifically assigned function.\n\nThese instructions closely tracked the language of the regulation, which, at the jury's request, was submitted to it (see pages 45-47, infra).\n\nThus, the evidence regarding the definition of \"placed in service\" was not, as defendant contends, ambiguous. Nor did the testimony of the other witnesses render the government's evidence ambiguous. Carl Wright testified that, to satisfy the IRS regulation, \"(t)he plants had to be in the state of readiness so that you could, in effect, start them up and they would produce ethanol.\" (Tr. 928-929.) Ron Walker also testified that he understood the phrase \"placed in service\" to mean capable of producing ethanol, meaning that \"you have to be able to put raw materials in one end and get finished products out of the other,\" and they have to be capable of being operated as designed. (Tr. 248-249.)\n\nBuchmueller testified that his investigation of Midwestern disclosed that none of the plants were placed in service in accordance with Treas. Reg. Section 1.46-3(d). (Tr. 1821.) Wright (Tr. 938-939, 958-959) and Walker (Tr. 261-263, 271-275) also testified that none of the plants were placed in service by the end of 1982. Although Skelley and Sinks did not have any familiarity with the phrase \"placed in service,\" they did give testimony indicating that noe of the plants were capable of producing even 190 proof ethanol by the end of the year, and, consequently, were not \"placed in service\" by that time. (Tr. 1151-1152, 1255-1256, 1331-1335, 1441-1442, 1145-1149.) Furthermore, Wright (Tr. 892-896, 928-929, 942-943, 944-946) and Walker (Tr. 155-156, 248-250, 274-277, 314) discussed with defendant both the Code requirements and the fact that the plants were not placed in service pursuant to those requirements at year's end.\n\nThus, the definition of \"placed in service,\" as understood by Wright and Walker, and as explained by Buchmueller, was essentially the same. And both Wright and Walker testified that defendant was familiar with the \"placed in service\" requirement. The jury, therefore, was clearly informed regarding the definition of the \"placed in service\" requirement, and there was ample evidence that defendant both knew of, and failed to comply with, the requirement.\n\nDefendant's own evidence as to the meaning of the regulation does not tend to negate his guilt. Defendant testified that it was his understanding that the phrase meant that \"the major components of the facilities necessary to the production of ethanol be installed, that at least all other components of the facility be at least on site, and that it be capable of producing ethanol.\" (Tr. 3347.) Ken Webb, a CPA who testified on behalf of defendant, defined the phrase as \"capable of producing ethanol.\" (Tr. 2783.) He said that the major components of the plant must be in place but that the plant need not have produced alcohol. (Id.) Given that the plants were not capable of producing ethanol as intended at the end of 1982, defendant's own claimed interpretation of the regulation allowed the jury to find that the plants were not available to be placed in service.\n\nBut even if defendant's claimed interpretation could have supported a finding that the plants were available to be placed in service, reversal of defendant's conviction would not be warranted. It is well established that \"'(i)t is the function of the jury, not an appellate court, to resolve conflict in the testimony or judge the credibility of witnesses.'\" Smalley v. United States, 798 F. 2d 1182, 1188 (8th Cir. 1986), quoting United States v. Harrison, 671 F. 2d 1159, 1162 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 847 (1982). The jury chose not to believe defendant's testimony that he thought the \"placed in service\" requirement had been complied with, and the evidence supports its determination. 37\n\nIV\n\nTHE DISTRICT COURT PROPERLY SUBMITTED GOVERNMENT EXHIBIT 255 TO THE JURY IN THE FORM IN WHICH IT WAS ADMITTED INTO EVIDENCE\n\nGovernment Exhibit 255, a partial copy of Treas. Reg. Section 1.46-3(d), was introduced into evidence without objection from defendant. (Tr. 1819-1821.) When the jury requested the exhibit during its deliberations, defense counsel pointed out to the court that the exhibit contained only the first page of the regulation, and complained that because the defense had previously reviewed a three-page exhibit, they assumed all three pages were being introduced. The court directed the exhibit to be submitted to the jury in the form in which it had been introduced into evidence.\n\nDefendant contends (Br. 45-47) that the District Court erred in refusing to submit to the jury during their deliberations a complete copy of Treas. Reg. Section 1.46-3(d). This contention is meritless. The trial court rejected this assertion in an order denying defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal. The court explained (Doc. 132 at pages 1-2):\n\nAssuming arguendo that Government counsel was somewhat careless in allegedly showing defendant's counsel one version of the exhibit and using another at trial, any criticism as to carelessness must be shared. In any event counsel fails to contend or demonstrate that the last two pages of the document he allegedly viewed depart in any material way from the first page of the regulation. Doubtless the court would have considered giving a supplemental instruction if requested and if the need had been demonstrated, but the only decision made was to send the jury a document received in evidence without objection.\n\nThe court's ruling was correct. A trial court's decision to send exhibits to the jury is reviewable under the abuse of discretion standard. United States v. Robinson, 774 F. 2d 261, 275-276 (8th Cir. 1985). On this record, defendant cannot establish that the court's ruling constituted an abuse of discretion and, consequently, his argument must fail. United States v. Robinson, 774 F. 2d at 275-276.\n\nIt was defendant's obligation at trial, pursuant to Rule 106, Fed. R. Evid., to request that the entire regulation be admitted. See, United States v. Larranaga, 787 F. 2d 489, 500 (10th Cir. 1986); United States v. Sweiss, 814 F. 2d 1208, 1211 (7th Cir. 1987). Since he failed to do so, and he failed to request a supplemental instruction at the time the exhibit was submitted to the jury, there is no basis for defendant's present argument that the court's ruling was improper. 38\n\nAt all events, defendant cannot demonstrate any prejudice as a result of the court's ruling. As defendant admits in his brief (Br. 46), the jury was adequately instructed regarding the \"placed in service\" requirement. Moreover, the court's instruction was derived from language taken from only the first page of Treas. Reg. Section 1.46-3(d), and the remaining two pages of the regulation were not relevant to the issues at trial. Accordingly, defendant cannot prevail on appeal on this issue. United States v. Robinson, 774 F. 2d at 275-276; United States v. Nelson, 735 F. 2d 1070, 1072 (8th Cir. 1984).\n\nV\n\nTHE DISTRICT COURT'S NOT GRANTING A NEW TRIAL SUA SPONTE DID NOT CONSTITUTE PLAIN ERROR\n\nDefendant asserts (Br. 48-54) that the District Court erred in failing to direct a mistrial on the ground of jury misconduct during the trial. He points (Br. 49-52) to a number of instances of juror inattentiveness and an alleged discussion of the case by some jurors prior to deliberations. Defendant never objected to the court's handling of these instances, and did not seek a mistrial on the basis of such misconduct. He acknowledges his failure to express any displeasure with the court's handling of the incidents (Br. 51-52), but suggests that the court should have granted defendant a new trial sua sponte. This claim must be rejected.\n\nWhere a defendant fails to object to juror misconduct at trial, he must demonstrate that the court's handling of the matter constituted plain error which prejudiced his right to a fair trial. United States v. Kimberlin, 805 F. 2d 210, 244 (7th Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 483 U.S. 1023 (1987); Rule 52(b), Fed. R. Crim. P. See United States v. Dean, 667 F. 2d 729, 732-734 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 1006 (1982); United States v. Sorenson, 611 F. 2d 701, 702 (8th Cir. 1979); United States v. Baker, 609 F. 2d 134, 140 (5th Cir. 1980). Plain errors are those that \"'seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.'\" United States v. Young, 470 U.S. 1, 15 (1985), quoting United States v. Atkinson, 297 U.S. 157, 160 (1936). 39\n\nIn this case, defendant cannot demonstrate that the instances of juror inattentiveness affected substantial rights and, consequently, he has waived this issue on appeal. United States v. Young, 470 U.S. at 15; United States v. Kimberlin, 805 F. 2d at 244; United States v. Dean, 667 F. 2d at 732-634. This was a complicated tax shelter case which continued for approximately three weeks. Over thirty witnesses testified and there was a wealth of documentary evidence. As defense counsel himself stated, in bringing the matter of the jurors' inattentiveness to the court's attention, \"I anticipated the difficulty because the case is unbelievably boring.\" (Tr. 679.) If the jury was less than attentive during parts of trial, it does not automatically follow that defendant's due process rights were violated. The District Court's determination of how to proceed in the face of juror inattentiveness was within its discretion, and, in light of defendant's acquiescence, its decision was not clearly erroneous. United States v. Bohr, 581 F. 2d 1294, 1302 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 958 (1978).\n\nDefendant also points to testimony that several jurors improperly discussed the case among themselves prior to deliberations. (Tr. 1527-1529.) After being informed that several jurors were discussing the case over lunch, the court queried \"Do counsel have any suggestion other than for me to remind the jury that they are not to discuss the case out of court?\" (Tr. 1529.) Defense counsel responded that a comment from the court would be satisfactory and that \"I certainly don't want this thing to terminate.\" (Id.) The judge subsequently repeated his prior instruction that the jurors should not discuss the case before they begin deliberations. (Tr. 1536-1538.)\n\nAgain, defendant has failed to demonstrate that the court's actions constituted plain error. United States v. Young, 470 U.S. at 15; United States v. Bohr, 581 F. 2d at 1302. At all events, discussions among the jurors about the case prior to deliberations constitute \"intrinsic influences.\" Government of Virgin Islands v. Gereau, 523 F. 2d 140, 149-150 (3d Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 424 U.S. 917 (1976). Such intrinsic influences upon the jury verdict are not grounds upon which to overturn a verdict. Tanner v. United States, 483 U.S. 107, 117-119 (1987); United States v. Krall, 835 F. 2d 711, 715-716 (8th Cir. 1987); Rule 606(b), Fed. R. Evid.\n\nOn the facts of this case, therefore, it is beyond dispute that the court did not abuse its discretion in not directing a mistrial, sua sponte. United States v. Krall, 835 F. 2d at 716-716; United States v. Dean, 667 F. 2d at 732-734; United States v. Bohr, 581 F. 2d at 1302.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the District Court's judgment of conviction and orders denying defendant's motion for new trial and motion for reconsideration should be affirmed.\n\nFOOTNOTES\n\n1 The indictment also named Ronald R. Walker, Carl E. Wright, and Kenneth D. Sinks, Jr., in Counts One through Twenty. (Doc. 1.) They entered guilty pleas to various counts of the indictment prior to trial, and testified as Government witnesses at defendant's trial.\n\n2 \"Doc.\" references are to the documents included in the original record as numbered by the Clerk of the District Court and transmitted to this Court. \"Tr.\" references are to the transcript of the trial. \"Tr. Motion\" references are to the transcript of the hearing on defendant's motion for new trial, held on July 17, 1989. \"G. Ex.\" references are to the Government's trial exhibits. \"Br.\" references are to defendant's brief.\n\n3 Defendant and Walker were so frequently together, or on the phone with one another (Tr. 1284-1285, 1580-1581, 2059-2061, 2113-2114), that they were called \"the Dynamic Duo\" and \"the Bobbsey Twins\" (Tr. 1285, 1580, 2060-2061).\n\n4 Although both Walker and Wright became members of the board of directors in 1981, defendant did not become a member of the board of directors until May, 1983. (Tr. 125-126, 355.) Defendant indicated that his professional liability carrier required him to wait until Midwestern was able to provide the appropriate liability policies. (Tr. 126.)\n\n5 Work on Clovis I commenced approximately October 15, 1982; work on Clovis II and Clovis III, respectively, began one and two weeks later. (Tr. 1130.) In November, Skelley was asked to remodel a plant in Roswell, New Mexico, and to complete a fourth plant in Clovis. (Tr. 1130-1132.) The closing on the sale of the fourth Clovis plant took place in Clovis during the first week of December. (Tr. 1132.) At that time, Skelley indicated to defendant and Walker that it would be virtually impossible to complete the plant. (Tr. 1132-1133.)\n\n6 Each plant was financed with industrial revenue bonds. (Tr. 158.) Defendant and Walker attended several meetings in advance of the bond issues, at which they sought to convince the authorities to provide the requisite financing. (Tr. 157-158.) Midwestern initially intended to build only two plants in 1982. (Tr. 251-255, 935-937.) When it became apparent that the plants could easily be sold, they decided, by late November or early December, 1982, to build two additional plants in Clovis and one in Roswell (also to be completed by December 31, 1982). (Id.)\n\n7 Clovis I & II were sold to Charles Jones, Inc. and the Fike Corporation, respectively, with Charles Jones acting as the managing general partner for both plants. (G. Exs. 6, 7, 22, 23.) Anthony Barber was managing general partner for Clovis III; the partnership that purchased the plant was known as Clovis III. (Tr. 2466; G. Exs. 8, 24.) Alan Markowitz was the managing general partner on the sale of Clovis IV. (Tr. 2586; G. Exs. 9, 25.)\n\n8 Only 198 proof ethanol is suitable for blending with gasoline. 190 proof ethanol is not a saleable product. (Tr. 1124, 1175.)\n\n9 In the glossary, the term \"in place\" was defined as available to be used, which, defendant had explained to Liscom, encompassed those parts not just on the plant site, but also in the general area of the site. (Tr. 1473.) The term \"operational\" was defined as \"of the correct size and construction for the specific use and either new or reconditioned as new.\" (Tr. 1474.) Finally, defendant explained that the phrase \"capacity has been exhibited\" meant that, based on sound engineering principles, the plant should meet or exceed design rates. (Tr. 1474-1475.)\n\n10 Skelley testified that he heard Sinks say \"We are going to get some legal advice on this,\" and that Liscom subsequently got on the phone, but he never actually heard defendant's voice. (Tr. 1230-1232.)\n\n11 In October, 1982, Walker, with defendant present, told Larry Skelley that he would be paid $10,000 per plant if the plants were able to produce 190 proof ethanol by December 31, 1982. (Tr. 1163-1168.) The written agreement, dated December 1, 1982, provided that Skelley would receive the bonus only if the plants were completed and capable of producing ethanol by the end of the year. (Tr. 1163-1167.) Skelley testified that he negotiated the oral agreement because he did not think the terms contained in the written agreement were attainable. (Tr. 1166-1168.)\n\n12 Throughout 1983, defendant made additional trips to the plant site and was sent the operating and performance records of the plant. (Tr. 646-647.) Defendant knew that, as late as March, 1983, the plants were not producing ethanol as designed. (Tr. 319-320, 645-646.)\n\n13 In addition, Walker stated that he initially thought Clovis I and II were complete by December 31, 1982, but after witnessing the startup procedure that occurred in January, 1983, he concluded that none of the plants were complete by that time. (Tr. 261-263, 271-275.) Carl Wright testified that none of the four plants were substantially completed for accounting purposes, or available to be placed in service for tax purposes. (Tr. 938, 958.) Wright testified that, following a trip to the plant site on December 14, 1982, he, like Walker, thought Clovis I and II would be complete at year end, although he did not think Clovis III and IV would be complete. (Tr. 938-939, 958.) Wright, however, also changed his mind regarding the status of completion after becoming apprised of additional information, and in January, 1983, concluded that none of the plants were operational or available to be placed in service by the end of 1982. (Tr. 958.)\n\n14 Defendant did not inform Judge Bonem that he himself owned stock, and Judge Bonem testified at trial that such knowledge might have had an effect on his judgment regarding the case. (Tr. 2429.)\n\n15 By the fall of 1983, the District Attorney's Office, which never received all the information requested from Midwestern, reopened the investigation. (Tr. 2445-2446.) That investigation led to defendant's trial and conviction in New Mexico. See page 16 n.17, infra.\n\n16 In fact, there was never any intent to collect on the notes; the provision was merely added to the sales agreement to meet the 25% \"at risk\" requirement. (Tr. 378, 1826, 1877-1878.)\n\n17 In August, 1987, defendant was convicted, following a jury trial, in the State of New Mexico. (Tr. 3064.) The jury found defendant guilty of two counts of conspiracy to commit fraud; three counts of fraud; one count of criminal solicitation; and one count of racketeering.\n\nAt the time of the trial, the Clovis plants were not in operation; there was at that time an outstanding offer to buy the plants at scrap value. (Tr. 2933-2935.)\n\n18 The trial court later removed this issue from the jury's consideration, instructing them that they could not consider as evidence of defendant's guilt the sales price of the plants.\n\n19 The investors were only at risk for $675,000, the amount of the cash downpayment. (Tr. 1825-1828.) They were not at risk on the $200,000 recourse note because Midwestern never enforced collection on the note. (Tr. 1826.) Consequently, although the note was termed a recourse note, and, in other circumstances, would have counted towards the at-risk percentage, it actually constituted a non-recourse note in this case. (Id.)\n\n20 Defendant also claims (Br. 14) that the Assistant United States Attorney violated \"the Petite policy\" by working with the prosecuting attorneys in the State of New Mexico \"to secure the tandem prosecution of * * * (defendant) in both State and Federal court.\" Under the \"dual prosecution policy\" of the United States Department of Justice, as set forth in Petite v. United States, 361 U.S. 529 (1960), and Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S. 22 (1977), despite the sufficiency of evidence in a case, the Department may refuse to bring a federal prosecution following the conclusion of a state proceeding based on substantially the same acts. Federal prosecution is warranted, however, where, as in this case, compelling federal interests are not vindicated by the state proceedings. Moreover, as this Court noted in United States v. Robinson, 774 F. 2d 261, 275 (8th Cir. 1985), \"even a genuine failure by the Government to follow the Petite policy does not create a right that a defendant can invoke to bar federal prosecution.\"\n\n21 In its order denying defendant's motion for reconsideration, the District Court opined, \"I believe the defendant's possession of all the most likely telephone records makes it quite improbable that a jury, on retrial, would accept the Walker or Liscom testimony on this subject in the scenario presented at trial.\" (Doc. 210 at 4.) The court also stated that \"on any retrial the Government might well drop the entire theory of Tierney fabricating the misleading portions of the Liscom certificate. The issue has become too elusive.\" (Id.) However, the court did not conclude that a reasonable jury could not believe that the conversation had taken place. And, although the telephone records subsequently produced by defendant demonstrate that the December 29, 1982, telephone call did not necessarily take place exactly as testified to at trial, those records simply do not negate the trial testimony regarding the fact of the telephone call, the content of the conversations, and the fact that defendant participated in the call. Three witnesses testified that they talked to defendant that night. In addition to Liscom (Tr. 1462-1465), Walker (Tr. 292-294) and Sinks (Tr. 1347-1353, 1358-1360) testified that the call took place and that they talked to defendant. Another witness, Larry Skelley, testified that he was in the same room with Sinks and Liscom when the conversation was taking place, and it was his understanding that defendant was one of the participants. (Tr. 1157-1162, 1227-1232, 1256-1258.) Skelley also remembered Sinks saying, \"We are going to get some legal counsel on this,\" and then turning the phone over to Liscom. (Tr. 1157-1162, 1230-1232.) It is wholly implausible that, as defendant contends, all of these witnesses perjured themselves. It is far more likely that they forgot minor details -- i.e., the exact locations of Walker and defendant.\n\n22 With respect to the records subpoenaed from the telephone company, the District Court found that defendant had satisfied the due diligence requirement.\n\n23 Defendant concedes that the Kruzie telephone records were provided to him by the state prosecutors prior to the state trial. (Br. 15-16.) He claims (Br. 15-17) that Daniel Pearlman, the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the New Mexico prosecution, misrepresented the prosecution's source of the Kruzie records. To begin with, the actions taken by Pearlman, as the state prosecutor, are essentially irrelevant to defendant's federal prosecution. At all events, Pearlman testified that he obtained the records from a source other than the Blackwell, Sanders repository. (Tr. Motion 185-186.) In addition, both the state (id. at 186-187) and the federal (id. at 174-176) prosecutors testified at the hearing that they never subpoenaed additional telephone records because they believed, on the basis of information from investigators, that records relating to the prosecution period would previously have been destroyed.\n\n24 Defendant states that the prosecutors had access to the repository \"commencing many months in advance of appellant's federal indictment.\" (Br. 14-15.) He neglects to mention that he had access to the repository even before the prosecutors. (Tr. Motion 165-166, 172-173.) Defendant then states that, because the prosecutor \"made the omnibus representation in these proceedings that it contained no materials which were exculpatory,\" and because he had thousands of pages of other documents to review, he did not attempt to review the documents in the repository. (Br. 15.) Defendant's attempt to blame the prosecutors for his failure to review the documents is disingenuous. Cynthia Campbell, the lead federal prosecutor, testified at the hearing on defendant's motion for new trial. She averred that she went to Blackwell, Sanders and reviewed documents in the repository on one occasion. (Tr. Motion 155-156.) At that time, she stated, the only materials she reviewed were depositions in the civil case. (Id. at 156.) Campbell said, moreover, that any materials obtained from the repository were included in the open file discovery provided to defendant. (Id. at 168.) Finally, Campbell testified that she had no recollection of discussing the Blackwell, Sanders documents with defendant. (Id. at 173-174.) Nor did she ever indicate to defendant that she had reviewed all the records in the repository and that, therefore, there was no need for defendant to review those records. (Id.)\n\n25 Defendant contends (Br. 23) that this case involves the \"knowing, negligent or reckless\" use of false testimony and accordingly, under United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97 (1976), a new trial is warranted. Newly discovered evidence which conflicts with evidence introduced at trial does not automatically support an inference of perjury. United States v. Bortnovsky, 879 F. 2d 30, 33 (2d Cir. 1989) (collecting cases). Here, as the District Court correctly held, there was no perjured testimony at trial, much less knowing use of perjured testimony by the prosecution. Thus, the Agurs holding is inapplicable.\n\n26 Defendant also contends (Br. 19-21) that Walker's testimony that he and defendant visited the plants in late December, 1982, was based on Jackson's testimony and was incorrect. But given the overwhelming evidence of defendant's knowledge, elimination of Walker's testimony would not have affected the outcome of the trial.\n\n27 18 U.S.C. 208(a) forbids substantial participation by a Government attorney in any prosecution \"in which, to his knowledge, he, (or) his spouse, * * *, has a financial interest.\"\n\n28 We note that there are other issues that must be resolved in National Union's favor in order for it to prevail in the declaratory judgment action. (Doc. 16, Affidavit of Benjamin Mann).\n\n29 The Government established, through the affidavit of Benjamin Mann, a partner in the firm of Blackwell, Sanders (Doc. 16), the following: as of January 31, 1987, Blackwell, Sanders consisted of 72 attorneys who were handling more than 3,000 separate matters for over 1000 clients; the firm's fees for the declaratory judgment action, as well as other Midwestern litigation matters, are computed on an hourly basis and are not based on the outcome of any of the actions; Bruce Campbell, the prosecutor's husband, has never worked on any of the Midwestern litigation matters, nor is his compensation based on the success or failure of the Midwestern litigation; Blackwell, Sanders never discussed with the prosecutor or any other Government employee the advisability of a criminal investigation or prosecution against defendant.\n\n30 While our judicial system mandates the presence of an impartial judge, and there is both a constitutional and a statutory right to a neutral or impartial judge, a defendant is not similarly entitled to a neutral and disinterested prosecutor. Marshall v. Jerrico, Inc., 446 U.S. 238, 248 (1980). To the contrary, (446 U.S. at 248-249, 250):\n\n(prosecutors) are necessarily permitted to be zealous in their enforcement of the law. The constitutional interests in accurate finding of facts and application of law, and in preserving a fair and open process for decision, are not to the same degree implicated if it is the prosecutor, and not the judge, who is offered an incentive * * *.\n\n* * * * *\n\n* * * the strict requirements of neutrality cannot be the same for * * * prosecutors as for judges, whose duty it is to make the final decision and whose impartiality serves as the ultimate guarantee of a fair and meaningful proceeding in our constitutional regime.\n\nOn the basis of these principles, the Supreme Court has held that \"prosecutors may not necessarily be held to as stringent a standard of disinterest as judges,\" and, accordingly, the Court has \"declined to find a conflict of interest in situations (involving prosecutors) where the potential for conflict on the part of the judge (in the same situation) might have been intolerable.\" Young v. United States, 481 U.S. 787, 807 (1987).\n\n31 For the same reasons, defendant has failed to establish a violation of 28 C.F.R. Section 45.735-4, which forbids participation in a case where a prosecutor or any relative has \"a specific and substantial interest that would be directly affected by the outcome of the investigation or prosecution.\"\n\n32 We note that the question left open in Mechanik was not whether dismissal would be appropriate prior to trial in the absence of prejudice, but what remedy would be appropriate prior to trial when there has been prejudice. Mechanik, 475 U.S. at 72.\n\n33 The plurality opinion expressed the view that the harmless error standard did not apply where an interested private party was appointed as the prosecutor in a contempt case. 481 U.S. at 809-814. But a majority of the Court has never accepted the view that representation of the Government by an interested prosecutor is not subject to harmless error analysis. Significantly, in Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States, 487 U.S. at 257, the Court did not cite Young in a list of prior decisions \"allowing the presumption of prejudice.\" In fact, Young was not referred to at all in Bank of Nova Scotia. Thus, the Young plurality opinion does not represent the current state of the law with respect to the applicability of harmless error analysis to grand jury and trial irregularities.\n\n34 The Assistant United States Attorney who prosecuted this case started with the office of the United States Attorney for the Western District of Missouri in 1978. (Doc. 16, Affidavit of Cynthia Clark Campbell.) She was assigned to the economic fraud unit and handled numerous tax, securities, and mail fraud cases. (Id.) She was assigned to this investigation in early 1985. (Id.) By that time, the Internal Revenue Service (Tr. 1797) and the District Attorney's Office in Clovis, New Mexico (Tr. 2424-2425), had already commenced their own investigations. In July, 1986, the United States Attorney's office referred the case to the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Division for a proposed joint IRS and FBI grand jury investigation. (Doc. 16, Affidavit of Cynthia Clark Campbell.) The IRS then referred the case to the Tax Division of the Department of Justice which, after making an independent evaluation of the case, authorized the U.S. Attorney's Office to initiate a grand jury investigation. (Id.) Both the United States Attorney and the Tax Division subsequently authorized the presentment of the case for indictment and, on January 21, 1987, the indictment was returned. (Id.) In August, 1987, defendant was convicted in the State of New Mexico on similar charges. (Tr. 3064.)\n\n35 To establish a violation of 18 U.S.C. 371, the Government must prove: (1) that two or more individuals agreed to commit an offense or to defraud the United States; (2) that one of the conspirators committed an overt act in furtherance of the agreement; and (3) the intent necessary for the contemplated offense. United States v. Falcone, 311 U.S. 205, 210 (1940); United States v. Zimmerman, 832 F. 2d at 457; United States v. Copple, 827 F. 2d at 1187; United States v. Andrade, 788 F. 2d 521, 525 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 963 (1986).\n\n36 The evidence also established that defendant violated 26 U.S.C. 7206(2). To prove that offense, the Government must demonstrate: (1) that defendant aided, assisted, procured, counseled, or advised the preparation or presentation of a document in connection with a matter arising under the internal revenue laws; (2) that the document was false as to a material matter; and (3) that the act of the defendant was willful. See United States v. Holecek, 739 F. 2d 331, 333 (8th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1218 (1985). This Court has held that, to establish aiding and abetting, the Government must prove \"that the defendant associated himself with the unlawful venture, that he participated in it as something he wished to bring about, and that he sought by his action to make it succeed.\" United States v. Anziano, 606 F. 2d 242, 245 (8th Cir. 1979); accord United States v. Buttorff, 572 F. 2d 619, 623 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 437 U.S. 906 (1978).\n\nIn this case, the Government proved that, in January, 1983, defendant directed the payment of a completion bonus to Larry Skelley, the general contractor, even though defendant knew the plants were not complete. Defendant, Walker, and Wright also decided to treat the additional construction necessary to complete the plants as warranty work instead of completion costs. Defendant's conduct was intended to hide the true completion status of the plants. In addition, defendant, Walker, and Wright decided that, even though the investors were not entitled to claim the credits on their returns, Wright should still prepare the partnership returns falsely reflecting such credits. Both Wright (Tr. 942-947, 953-954, 959) and Walker (Tr. 287-289, 306-308, 364-367) testified that the partnerships were not entitled to claim the tax credits and that defendant was aware of the falsity of the returns.\n\n37 The cases cited by defendant (United States v. Steinhilber, 484 F. 2d 386 (8th Cir. 1973); United States v. Diogo, 320 F. 2d 898 (2d Cir. 1963); Johnson v. United States, 410 F. 2d 38 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 822 (1969)) lend him no support. Those cases concern situations where a defendant has been charged under a statute with knowingly and willfully making false statements. In such a case, the Government must prove the falsity of the statement and that the defendant knew it was false. Consequently, where the statement at issue is ambiguous, the government is required, pursuant to those cases, to allege and prove that the statement is false under any reasonable interpretation or that the defendant's intended meaning is the same as the Government's interpretation and the statement as so interpreted is false. Here, there was no ambiguity in the definition of \"placed in service,\" and the Government proved the falsity of tax returns claiming credits and deductions based on representations that the plants had been \"placed in service.\"\n\n38 Defendant's assertion (Br. 47) that submission of the exhibit provided the jury with \"a different (and perhaps limitless) standard of the law than that set forth in the court's original instruction, thereby subjecting appellant to the possibility of a wrongful conviction on the basis of something other than the law of the case,\" is baseless. The language contained in the exhibit was consistent with the court's instructions.\n\n39 Appellate courts have expressed strong disapproval of defendants who fail to object to the trial court's method of addressing a juror attentiveness problem, then raise the issue on appeal. The courts refer to such conduct as \"a gamesmanship approach to criminal justice.\" United States v. Moore, 580 F. 2d 360, 364-365 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 970 (1978); United States v. Krohn, 560 F. 2d 293, 297 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 895 (1977); United States v. Kopel, 552 F. 2d 1265, 1275-1276 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 970 (1977). In Kopel, the Seventh Circuit stated (552 F. 2d at 1274):\n\nWe should not, and will not, permit a litigant to sit quietly by observing the commission of what he claims at the appellate level is reversible error unless we are satisfied that the error was obvious, affected the substantial rights of the accused, and if uncorrected would be an affront to the integrity and reputation of criminal proceedings."
