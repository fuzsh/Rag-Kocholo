        "text": "DALLAS — Last spring, Isaiah Wong led the University of Miami’s men’s basketball team to its best season to that point, a run to the round of 8 in the N.C.A.A. tournament, where it lost to Kansas, the eventual champion.\n\nWeeks later, Miami added one of the top transfers in the sport: Nijel Pack, a sharpshooting guard from Kansas State, to form one of the best backcourts in Division I.\n\nOn that same day, John Ruiz, a Miami alumnus and the chief executive of LifeWallet, announced on Twitter that Pack had signed a two-year deal with his company worth $800,000 plus a car.\n\nAn agent representing Wong, who was also endorsed by LifeWallet, responded by telling ESPN that Wong would transfer if he didn’t receive a better deal that reflected “that he was a team leader of an Elite Eight team.”\n\nRuiz said he would not renegotiate the deal, and Wong eventually made a statement of his own, saying that the comments on his behalf were “unauthorized” and that he would not do anything to jeopardize his relationship with LifeWallet or Miami.\n\nThe skirmish reflected this new era in college sports, which began in the summer of 2021 after a series of state laws went into effect that made it illegal for the N.C.A.A. to prohibit athletes from earning money from the use of their name, image and likeness, a category now known as N.I.L.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
