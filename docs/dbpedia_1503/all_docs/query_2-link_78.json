        "text": "More coincidences: George Mason President Alan Merten used to be a dean at the University of Florida. He planned to vacation in that state this week. Naturally, he canceled the trip.\n\nAthletic director Tom O'Connor's grandson, Tommy Toole, will be a ballboy at the Final Four. O'Connor broke the news to Toole in December as a Christmas present, having no idea that Mason would actually be playing this weekend. By the way, Saturday is Tommy's 10th birthday.\n\nLarranaga understands why his team has so fascinated the American public.\n\n\"Every one of us in this country, we do not want to be considered underachievers,\" Larranaga said. \"Nobody wants that tag. We'd like to be at least achievers. ... This team has exceeded expectations. I could probably thank (CBS commentators) Billy Packer and Jim Nantz for creating that, because nobody expected us to do anything. I told our team that has really helped us. It's helped us stay under the radar screen and be an unknown quantity, a mystery, to the opponents.\"\n\nThey are unknown no more. Wednesday's pep rally at the student center drew more students than usually attend the Patriots' home games. Coeds lined two levels of balconies, while others stood on stairwells and tabletops to get a glimpse of Larranaga.\n\nThe coach recounted how he compared his team to \"Kryptonite\" against the Supermen of North Carolina, how he hummed the \"Mission: Impossible\" team to his players and referred to the Colonial Athletic Association as the \"Connecticut Assassin Association\" before the game against Connecticut.\n\n\"I think Connecticut's players know what league we play in now,\" he told the cheering crowd.\n\nOutside, someone had put a green \"Go Kryptonite Kidz\" shirt on the statue of George Mason, whose campaign to put a Bill of Rights in the Constitution would tie in nicely - for movie purposes, anyway - with Larranaga's quest for better NCAA tournament at-large rights for mid-majors.\n\nWhile Larranaga would have liked to practice in the \"Hoosiers\" gym, and even though he's seen the movie \"30 to 50 times,\" the coach said Mason's story isn't quite the same.\n\n\"There's a considerable difference between Hickory High and George Mason University,\" the coach said. \"We have 30,000 students. We're not a little school. We are Division I. We're just not as known as the high-major teams we've faced or will face in the Final Four.\"\n\nAfter the pep rally and a practice, the players boarded the bus for the airport amid yet another round of cheers. Given all the hoopla of the past week, will they be able to focus on playing Florida?\n\nSilly question, according to Butler.\n\n\"We're two games away from the national championship,\" Butler said. \"We're ready to go.\"\n\nSaid Larranaga: \"I tell them to have more fun than any other team in the tournament. It's been a great recipe for success. We're not going to change it.\"\n\nRICHMOND, Va. - Suddenly, everybody's a George Mason fan. One day after the Patriots earned their first-ever Final Four berth with an 86-84 upset victory over Connecticut on Sunday, Virginia’s Legislature was decked out in green and gold. ‘‘This is a metaphor for all of you and for what it means for this commonwealth,’’ said Sen. Jay O’Brien, R-Va., whose district is near the school’s campus. O’Brien, a U.S. Military Academy graduate, beamed as he pulled on a green and gold baseball cap bearing the school’s logo. He also wore a matching tie and held up a Patriots jersey. ‘‘This is as enjoyable as Army beating Navy,’’ he said. |— The Associated Press\n\nVirginia is for GMU fans"
