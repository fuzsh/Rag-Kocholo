The Demon Deacons have now scored 80-or-more points in five-consecutive games for the first time since November of 2021.\n\nWake Forest is currently 8-0 at home this season and 39-5 inside LJVM Coliseum since the start of the 2021-22 season. At the conclusion of non-conference play for this season, head coach Steve Forbes has never lost a non-ACC game inside LJVM Coliseum, and Wake Forest is 27-0 in LJVM against non-conference opponents dating back to December 2018.\n\nHunter Sallis led all scorers at Boston College with 21 points. The junior guard made each of his six looks at the free-throw line while playing 36 minutes. The performance was Sallis' seventh of the year in which he recorded 20 or more points, along with being the third-straight game this winter.\n\nCameron Hildreth had an efficient night from the floor against the Eagles, as the junior went 7-of-10 (70.0 percent) from the floor for 18 points, including a 3-of-4 clip from beyond the arc. His makes from three-point territory were a career best.\n\nKevin Miller made a handful of big plays in the midrange area to finish with 17 points on 7-of-9 shooting. The floor general tossed out a game-high seven assists as well.\n\nBig man Efton Reid III had a major second half to control the paint and ultimately notch his second double-double as a Deac â€“ 13 points (5-of-9 shooting) and 14 rebounds. In the final 20 minutes alone, Reid III posted 11 points on a perfect 4-of-4 shooting and grabbed 10 boards.\n\nAndrew Carr netted a dagger, corner triple late in the contest to help seal the victory. The 6-10 forward chipped in seven rebounds and four assists. Freshman guard Parker Friedrichsen added nine points, all coming from three-point land.\n\nIt was the 12th time this season where Wake Forest had four players register double-figures in scoring.\n\nFans can follow along with the high-scoring Deacs on Saturday via the Demon Deacons Twitter, Instagram and Facebook accounts (@WakeMBB).\n\nSeries History\n\nVersus Miami\n\nSeries: Miami leads 16-13 overall, Wake leads 10-2 in LJVM\n\nLast: March 9, 2023, in Greensboro\n\nResult: L, 74-72 - ACC Tournament Quarterfinals\n\nThe Scout\n\nMiami is led by veteran coach Jim Larranaga and is the only other ACC team besides Wake Forest to have four players averaging over 13 points a game. While Wake is second in the league in free throw percentage, shooting 80.16 from the line, Miami leads the league with a 80.18 clip from the line.\n\nThe Hurricanes are led by Norchad Omier in scoring with 18.0 ppg. Omier also leads the team on the boards with 9.5 per game.\n\nTicket Information\n\nSince the start of the 2021-22 season, Wake Forest is 35-5 inside LJVM. During that time, Wake Forest won 15-straight games inside Joel Coliseum, which was the longest home-win streak since the Deacs went 22-0 during the 2004-05 and 2005-06 seasons. Wake Forest was the first ACC school to reach 31 home wins during the two seasons. With the Jan. 17, 2023, win over Clemson, Steve Forbes has defeated every ACC team at least once in less than three seasons.\n\nFull season ticket packages for the 2023-24 season are now available!
