Moseman\n\nLos Alamos\n\nGreetings.\n\nI would like to take a moment to tell you a little about Amy Woods. I have known Amy for nearly 10 years and I’m proud to call her a friend.\n\nAmy grew up in Los Alamos. Her family has lived here since 1953 andhas deep roots in this community.

Clark\n\nBy LISA SHIN\n\nLos Alamos\n\nAt the Republican National Convention July 21, 2016, I told millions of Americans that Donald Trump was the only presidential candidate who would preserve the American Dream. I declared that he would ensure a more prosperous, safe and secure future for our children and our grandchildren.\n\nSince that once-in-a-lifetime, never-happen-again moment, I have made new friends as well as new enemies. I had no idea what a “gif” was until I saw one of myself, mocked and ridiculed on Twitter. I received my first hate mail, addressed to my office, replete with profanities and racial Read More\n\nObstacles To Voting In 11 Swing States\n\nSubmitted by Carol A. Clark\n\nNMCC News:\n\nA new Common Cause report may prove handy on Election Day for voters unaware of new laws in states where their votes are even more important than elsewhere.\n\nThe new report, Protecting the Vote in 2016: A Look at 11 Swing States examines state laws — from registration and voter ID laws to polling place challenges and post-election audits. It can serve as a guidebook for voters seeking to navigate the laws in order to exercise their right to vote.\n\nThe report doesn’t\n\nRead More\n\nLetter To The Editor: Chandler For County Council\n\nSubmitted by Carol A. Clark\n\nBy County Council Vice Chair Susan O’Leary and Tim O’Leary\n\nLos Alamos\n\nWe’re writing to ask you to join us in using one of your votes to support Attorney Chris Chandler for County Council on Nov. 8.\n\nLos Alamos is fortunate to have several good candidates to choose from in this election. But, there are a number of reasons why Chris should rise to the top of your list.\n\nFirst, Chris has a proven record of dedication the Council needs.

Clark\n\nBy MIKE And EMILY KLUK\n\nLos Alamos\n\nLos Alamos has a golden opportunity to send our friend and neighbor, Sharon Stover, to serve as District 43 Representative. Most of us have been touched by Sharon’s generosity and leadership over the last three decades. She wants to continue to serve our community, District 43, and the state of New Mexico. Please cast your vote to help make this happen.\n\nSharon Stover has been a friend to the Kluk family for over 20 years and we have personally witnessed her integrity, dedication, and commitment to serving the people of Los Alamos County and Northern New Mexico Read More\n\nSanta Fe Mayor Javier Gonzales Attends Get Out The Vote Rally At Los Alamos Democratic Headquarters\n\nSubmitted by Carol A.

Clark\n\nBy KRISTIN HENDERSON\n\nLos Alamos County Councilor\n\nThere are a couple arguments going around in support of maintaining the elected Office of Sheriff that I would like to address. I am in favor of a FOR vote to eliminate it.\n\nThe first is that the Sheriff is your last stand against corruption. The fact is, the Sheriff here has NO authority to investigate corruption, or any crime. The concept of needing the office to protect you is both illegal and a complete red herring.\n\nCorruption can be investigated by the State Attorney General, the State Police, the FBI – there are any number of other entities, Read More\n\nLetter To The Editor: My Endorsement Goes To Rep. Stephanie Garcia Richard\n\nSubmitted by Carol A. Clark\n\nBy DAVID IZRAELEVITZ\n\nLos Alamos County Councilor\n\nA recent mailing by the Sharon Stover campaign highlights portions of a 2011 Monitor article where I am quoted complimenting her on her leadership abilities. Indeed, while Ms. Stover and I served on the County Council, I saw her work tirelessly as council chair on behalf of our county, and it was a pleasure and an honor to serve with her. Every word that was quoted of me is accurate and heartfelt. Moreover, she displayed the political courage to cross party lines and vote to appoint me to Council. Sharon is a dear friend and a role model to me. Nevertheless, Read More\n\nGOP Invites Community To Pizza And Politics Nov. 8\n\nSubmitted by Carol A.

Clark\n\nBy JODY BENSON\n\nLeague of Women Voters\n\nAs we registered voters at the Farmer’s Market and LAHS, I was not shocked exactly, but more, disappointed that too many people stated that they never vote because (1) they hate the candidates, (2) they don’t know the candidates or the issues, or (3) it doesn’t matter. They did not register. Now they don’t have the option.\n\nThe first opinion is personal, and therefore inarguable. But (2) and (3) are destructively untrue.\n\nFirst, if you’re not voting because you don’t know the candidates or the issues, you can learn. We all have values that we want actualized, and Read More\n\nLetter To The Editor: Thoughts About Council Candidates\n\nSubmitted by Carol A. Clark\n\nBy KRISTIN HENDERSON\n\nLos Alamos County Council\n\nFor those who haven’t yet voted – there are three seats open on the Los Alamos County Council, and six people running.\n\nI personally believe that Council has been making good progress in town for the last few years, and I would like to see that continue. Accordingly, I would really like to see the two incumbents get re-elected – Steve Girrens and Pete Sheehey.\n\nSteve has always been an advocate for youth and families and is a big supporter of the County working with our Schools. Having an excellent School system is critical\n\nRead More\n\nLetter To The Editor: Marco Lucero Responds To Question About Constitutional Sheriffs Organization\n\nSubmitted by Carol A. Clark\n\nBy Sheriff Marco Lucero\n\nLos Alamos County\n\nThis is in response to the Letter to the Editor by Stephanie Nakhleh, published in the Oct. 30 edition of the Los Alamos Daily Post, (link). Ms. Nakhleh asks why I don’t answer the question of whether I’m a member of the Constitutional Sheriffs Organization. I actually answered this question in my June 13, 2016 Letter to the Editor published in the Los Alamos Daily Post, (link).\n\nI am not nor have I ever been a member of this organization. Anyone can place your name online and say what they want to further their cause. I do profess my allegiance Read More\n\nLocal Democrats Create Spirited Video About Voting\n\nSubmitted by Carol A.

WILLIAMS\n\nLos Alamos\n\nAbove is a plot of how the New Mexico House of Representatives has changed over the past four elections. What it shows is the dramatic change from the “old-guard”, democratic-controlled, House to a fairly even seating as a result of the voter revolt of 2010. Indeed, only one democrat that is seated today was elected in 2010. With a fairly even house, I foresee a flip-flop between the two parties for control. In such a case, a district’s representation is best fostered by longevity (seniority).\n\nWe have two good candidates running for Read More\n\nLetter To The Editor: Rep. Garcia Richard – A Proven Leader With Integrity, Courage, Strength Of Character\n\nSubmitted by Carol A. Clark\n\nGREG CUNNINGHAM\n\nLos Alamos\n\nI am writing in support of Dist. 43 Rep. Stephanie Garcia Richard, a proven leader with integrity, courage, conviction and strength of character. As a lifelong educator, her qualifications to determine what is needed for the education and well-being of our children is beyond compare.\n\nWhile I respect her opponent’s contribution to our community, Sharon Stover appears to be an adamant supporter of the current Republican administration and the Public Education Department’s flawed testing policy, punitive and error-riddled teacher evaluation Read More\n\nRooney: Vote On Bond C Is Vital For UNM-LA\n\nSubmitted by Carol A.

Clark\n\nBy SHARON STOVER\n\nRepublican Candidate for House Dist. 43\n\nRunning for the state House of Representatives has given me a crash course in how New Mexicans view our government as well as politics in general. During the past months, I’ve had conversations with thousands of citizens throughout District 43. I listened as they voiced their concerns about our state and its future direction.\n\nLeaving a positive legacy for our children is a central part of the American Dream. New Mexico parents are no different. They want to make sure their kids will have opportunities to build better lives for themselves Read More"
