        "text": "In a rushed special session to fill deficits in state budgets, Western New Mexico University saw an equal cut as the rest of the state’s universities under a bill passed by both the New Mexico House and Senate. But, due to House representatives leaving WNMU off of a list of universities set to receive increased flexibility in how they make those cuts, the shape of the local institution’s cuts is in limbo.\n\nThe initial bill from the Senate cut 5 percent from all universities in the state. The House Appropriations and Finance Committee went through several drafts but focused on language that would restrict how universities made those cuts.\n\nThe final amendment kept cuts to the original 5 percent statewide, and removed language restricting universities from making those cuts to institutional areas of their budgets. Representatives agreed with university leaders from across the state, including WNMU President Joseph She-pard, in opposing that restriction since some universities in different situations may need that flexibility to make the mandated cuts. The amendment also listed the universities to which that flexibility would be restored, but somehow failed to list WNMU.\n\nConcerned that omission may harm WNMU, Democratic District 28 Sen. Howie Morales criticized the lapse in attention he blamed for WNMU not being included on the list.\n\n“I am not happy whatsoever that the university I represent will not receive that same comprehensive flexibility,” he told the Daily Press. “The only university not placed in the amendment was Western.”\n\nMorales said Republican District 39 Rep. John Zimmerman must have “fallen asleep at the wheel” and didn’t realize the impact that would have on the area.\n\nZimmerman sits on the House Appropriations Committee, which oversaw the bill’s amendment. He insisted he fought hard to bring the cut back down to 5 percent from the 6 percent cut recommended in an early draft of the amendment. He also said that when he realized WNMU was absent from the list he contacted House Appropriations Committee Chair and Republican District 37 Rep. Larry Larrañaga about what ramifications WNMU might face in its wake.\n\nLarrañaga reportedly told Zimmerman that while WNMU did not appear on the list of universities later in the bill, that earlier language includes all state institutions of higher educations.\n\nThat language does, in fact, appear in the original Senate bill and early on in the appropriate section of the amendment. Zimmerman said he was told that meant WNMU should still be covered and receive the flexibility for their 5 percent cuts.\n\nMorales, though, said that since the bill was passed as amended he wasn’t so sure.\n\n“It has already been passed, sent on to the governor,” he said. “I would hope that she would veto the entire line which restricts the universities but we can’t know that.”\n\nWNMU President Shepard, though, said that while his university should have been listed, the restrictions shouldn’t affect his staff’s plans for the 5 percent cuts. Shepard and WNMU staff have been planning on cutting 5 percent since Gov. Susana Martinez’s 5 percent cuts to all executive agencies in August.\n\n“On the rewrite of the amendment, we think we were just accidentally taken off,” Shepard said. “As far as our cuts to funding go, I have had no intention of compromising the instructional side. I most likely wouldn’t need to use that clause anyway.”\n\nBenjamin Fisher may be reached at ben@scdailypress.com."
