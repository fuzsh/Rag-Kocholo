        "text": "University of Miami basketball coach Jim Larranaga is especially eager to watch the NBA Draft on Thursday as two of his former players, Isaiah Wong and Jordan Miller, are projected as second-round picks.\n\nIf they are both taken, it would be the fourth time in the Hurricanes program history that two players were selected in the same draft. The last time was when Bruce Brown and Lonnie Walker IV were drafted in 2018, and both made headlines in the NBA Playoffs this month.\n\nWong, the ACC Player of the Year, could have stayed a fifth year as the NCAA added an extra year for student-athletes whose careers fell during the COVID pandemic. Instead, he chose to enter the draft after averaging 16.2 points this season and leading the Hurricanes to their first Final Four in school history.\n\nHe finished his UM career with 1,866 points to rank fourth all-time in program history.\n\n“Isaiah is in very good spirits, every NBA team I talk to understands that he is a really a bucket-getter,” Larranaga said on Wednesday. “He can really score, all his workouts have proven that, and he’s such a nice kid. Everybody likes him a lot. I’m anticipating he’ll be a second-round pick. I don’t know how early or late, but I feel confident to say he has a great shot.”\n\nMiller spent two years with UM after transferring from George Mason and averaged 15.3 points and 6.2 rebounds in his final season. He was a key player in the Final Four run, making national headlines with a perfect 27-point game against Texas in the Elite Eight (7-of-7 from the floor, 13-of-13 from the free-throw line)\n\n“Jordan’s done great with all his interviews and tryouts,” Larranaga said. “I’ve talked to a number of NBA teams who love him and will look very, very closely at him. He’s excited. I think he’ll be a second-round pick.”\n\nLarranaga said it is possible Wong or Miller could sneak into the first round, but he believes second round is more likely. Several mock drafts have them as second-round picks.\n\nHe is particularly proud of both players because neither was an NBA prospect coming out of high school. Larranaga credited his current and previous staff for recruiting them.\n\nWong weighed 160 pounds when he got to UM, beefed up to 185 pounds and improved various areas of his game. Miller was not highly recruited, went to George Mason, transferred to UM and helped lead the Canes to the Elite Eight and Final Four.\n\n“Isaiah Wong was never projected to be an NBA Draft choice, he was a Top 100 guy that you hoped could develop into that,” the coach said. “And he did. He just kept getting better and better and he’s put himself where there’s a very good chance that he’ll be playing in the NBA next year.\n\n“Jordan wasn’t a high recruit, improved at George Mason and then had a huge impact on our program in his two years with us.”\n\nUM women to play Baylor: The UM women’s team will play Baylor on Dec. 16 as part in the 2023 Hall of Fame Series San Antonio at the AT&T Center. The men’s half of the doubleheader features Tennessee and North Carolina State.\n\n“We are extremely excited to participate in the 2023 Basketball Hall of Fame Event,” head coach Katie Meier said. “This is an elite annual event, and we look forward to the national exposure it provides.”"
