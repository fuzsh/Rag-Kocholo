Republican Rep. Larry Larrañaga is retiring after representing the district for nearly 24 years.\n\nRetired physician William Pratt is the Democratic nominee for the House district where registered Republicans slightly outnumber Democrats.\n\nDemocrats currently hold a 38-32 majority in the state House of Representatives. State Senate elections take place in 2020.\n\nState GOP Chairman Ryan Cangiolosi called Godshall a strong candidate to keep the district in Republican hands."
