        "text": "Great Britain is the home soil for most of the Formula 1 teams. But how many British partners are there in Formula 1? Here is an overview of the number of British partners in Formula 1 2023. Some of the teams, including Formula 1, had only one (1) or no partners from Great Britain 2023. McLaren is not only the team with the highest number of partners from the USA, 27 in total 2023, but also the team with the highest number of partners from Great Britain, at least in 2023. McLaren had eleven (11) British partners 2023. In 2021, a year after Brexit, there was 36 partners from Great Britain in Formula 1. Last year the number was 31. Great Britain is still the European market with the highest number of partners in Formula 1. Italy was second with 29 partners in 2023. So far 2024 have seven (7) British companies left Formula 1, among them Financial Times and Immersive Labs. Will be interesting to follow if these seven can be replaced with British companies?\n\nPerfectionism: a lesson from Formula 1 üèéÔ∏è Fresh from the excitement of the S√£o Paulo Grand Prix, a thought crossed my mind after Leclerc was heading the wall in the formation lap due to a hydraulics failure: even the most meticulously engineered Formula 1 car isn‚Äôt immune to failure. It's a powerful metaphor for us in the tech and business world. In F1, teams work tirelessly to create the most advanced cars. The pursuit of perfection in every component is incredible. Yet, sometimes, they fail. This tells that in our pursuit for excellence, perfection is a direction, not a destination. Like an F1 team, the mindset should be to aim for excellence, pushing the boundaries of what we can do. But also stay agile, knowing that adaptability is key when unexpected challenges arise. Whether it‚Äôs on the track or at the office, it‚Äôs not about being flawless. It‚Äôs about performing at our best while being ready to pivot when needed. That's the kind of race we're in. Agility and resilience take the pole position over perfection. Do you see perfection as the goal, or the journey? #F1 #leadership #innovation #businessAgility #streaver #adaptability #unexpected PS: It was my first time watching F1 from the stands with friends. For sure it's an unforgettable experience ‚ù§Ô∏è Thank you Guillermo Coduri, Federico Kauffman, Juan Ignacio Larrambebere Daglio, Sebasti√°n Gordienko Sorondo\n\nA new partnership for F1 Academy and Doriane Pin! With who is it, what does it mean and why should we be happy about it? ü§î üñ• Qualcomm is a global corporation creating software, semiconductors, service related to wireless technology‚Ä¶ and is an official partner of Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS Formula One Team with a multi-year deal. ü§ç Now, it expands its partnership with the F1 team to supporting their F1 Academy entry Doriane Pin as her senior partner. As Don McGuire from Qualcomm said, they are excited to ‚Äúsupport the inclusion and development of female drivers, like Doriane Pin‚Äù. What is the partnership focused on and what brand logo will the Frenchwoman wear on her gear? ü§ù Qualcomm follows similar moves from other companies that have connections to an F1 team, such as the tech company Cisco sponsoring McLaren‚Äôs Bianca Bustamante or clothing brand Pepe Jeans supporting Red Bull‚Äôs Hamda Al Qubaisi. üí∞ More sponsorships are of course great for the young female drivers as it brings more funds and even attention to them. Did you know that to be able to compete in F1 Academy, every entrant needs to bring ‚Ç¨150 000 to help cover the cost of the whole season? And that‚Äôs just the start of their careers‚Ä¶ Read more in my article for Pit Debrief about the partnership with Doriane Pin and let me know what you think about it! üñá‚ú® https://lnkd.in/dyBQ6vvU\n\nToday is my favourite day of the year! The first of the three days Formula 1 testing. üèÅüèéÔ∏è After months of intense development all ten F1 teams meet on track and what do they do? They don‚Äôt jump right away to competing, they test everything‚Ä¶ ‚ú® The more time I spend in the CRO area, the more I believe that we should test everything, even bug fixes, because you really NEVER know. So what do they test during these 3 days? Well, as much as possible. ü§ì - Reliability - Performance - Tire wear and grip on different compounds - They also collect base data to confirm if what they saw in the simulations is confirmed in the real life conditions They have hundreds of sensors on the car, that help them collect the data. As a Formula 1 fan, I am fascinated by the similarities between their testing programs and digital experimentation programs. They use simulators ahead of each race to adapt to the different track layouts and conditions. What about you? Do you test everything you release? Do you QA a single line of code for reliability? Do you test every promotion, before launching it live? What % of everything you release do you really test today? p.s. Let‚Äôs hope that Lewis Hamilton will get the 8th world championship this season before he changes the colour to red. (not biased at all üòâ) #testing #formula1 #inspiration #experimentation #continuousimprovement\n\nFormula Student is actually an endurance race, from the sport point of view. This excellent diagram prepare by Christian R√∂ske (Rennteam Uni Stuttgart e.V. Alumnus) shows the number of finishers at Formula Student Austria (in both Combustion and Electric category), Formula Student East (in the Category Combustion, Electric and Hystorical) and at Formula Student Germany. It is interesting to notice that for the EV teams just 1/4 of the teams is able to effectively conclude Endurance. For an emerging team, a reliable car is far more important than a fast car. Reliability is achieved with test km, which helps more than hours spend in the development. So in this case I recommend a simple concept easy to design, procure and manufacture, and to concentrate on testing. On the CV category it is slight different. At competitive event like Germany and probably event more at Formula Student Alpe Adria , when several expert teams are present, the amount of finishers can be high, so performance plays an important role too. Also in this case test km and experience (as confirmed by the result of the alumni teams) increase dramatically to chance to finish the event. Would you agree on this interpretation of the data?\n\nThree lessons I can think of from Austria's Grand Prix are to always stay calm under pressure, that life is not fair, and to always be there to pick up the pieces. You could be leading and dominating the race from the start (hell, you might have been doing so for years), executing every plan and strategy as planned. That is, until lap 52, or a certain time in your life, when you, or your teammates, make a small mistake that causes the person behind you to close the gap. That's when the pressure peaks and you will do anything to prevent that guy from overtaking you. At this moment, it is vital to not be overwhelmed by the pressure and to work with the team to maintain the lead. But know that s**t happens that could cause you to lose the lead near the end of your race, specifically in lap 64. What you must do in this circumstance is pick yourself up and never give up. Or, you could also chase the leader for quite some time, yet you still couldn't top them, even though you have a better car or method. You always play by the book out of respect for the leader, whom you always look for as a source of inspiration. But know that not everyone is as nice or \"skema\" as you, and they could break some rules to stay at the top, which may cost you the race, and that might hinder your journey to the top. It's up to you to determine whether that hindrance is temporary or permanent. Life is not fair; it will punch you in the face countless times. Get up and try again. Or, you could always chase those in front of you for some time. Regardless of the upgrades or improvements that you have made to close the gap, you still can't catch them. But it is crucial to always maintain a positive attitude and work ethic and to never give up despite the gap. Keep up the pace and the good work, regardless of the problems ahead. You never know when those leading might encounter unexpected issues that could cost them the lead; ensure that you are always there at the right place and at the right time to pick up the pieces. Congrats, George and Mercedes! Feel bad for Lando and McLaren though, their improvements this year are truly remarkable. What's your take on the race?\n\nGood Evening, I hope you had a good start in this new week. In Holland we enjoyed the Formula 1 on Zandvoort in the weekend and it was again spectacular. A lot of festivities, with music, artists, practice rounds and qualifier round. The best was however saved for the last, when Max Verstappen took his 9th Grand-Prix win in a row. A unique happening viewed and enjoyed by a huge amount of people with different personalities and emotions. I reference to my last post, humans seem to have different identities, sometimes connected to a circumstance, sometimes connect to an emotion, sometimes connect to whatever‚Ä¶ for everybody different but it always creates identities. Imagine what can be expected when viewing the crowd on the circuit on Saturday or Sunday ? Do we see anything at all ?, Do we see the real identity or ‚Äúa dummy‚Äù when looking at the drivers, the crew, the journalists. üòä It is not so easy to see whether it is real or dummy as it depends on our own perspective, the other persons perspective, the circumstance and the repetition. However, the more we see somebody the more we tend to think we ‚Äúknow‚Äù this person (= identity) and so we start to feel comfortable in our opinion. Nevertheless, the truth however is that we have no clue at all, as it still could be a dummy. People are showing a learned, trained, implanted versions of them self to be able to perform, be at work, able to discuss, reason to live, express their thoughts, serve their Ego etc.! So, although we might see ‚Äúauthenticity‚Äù it might be a true authentic dummy üòä But where is the real identity, where do we see this one? Surprise you don‚Äôt SEE it, you FEEL the real one. The moment we are fully aware and open-minded, we are sensitive for authentic energy from within. A person who is living his authentic deeper inner self, will let you feel WHO he is and HOW he feels. Every time again and again and again‚Ä¶ without exceptions, as this is who he is. The dummy form SHOWS WHAT he is, shows WHAT he does, shows WHAT he feels. It is like a performance on stage, and you are looking at itüòä Back to the Formula 1 or another event you can remember. Question: Try to remember or look at any person you imagine and simply let things happen, what wants to be shown!!... Is it a feeling (him/her) or a view (dummy) you receive? Don‚Äôt think, only feel and be aware. Maybe it needs a little bit of experience and rehearsal, but you will experience that it works. Give yourself the benefit of the doubt and just try‚Ä¶ Enjoy üòä and good luck ‚Ä¶."
