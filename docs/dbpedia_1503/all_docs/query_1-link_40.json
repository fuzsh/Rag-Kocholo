        "text": "President of the Year Award - Danielle Gonzales\n\nDanielle Gonzales was born in Farmington, New Mexico, and moved to Albuquerque at the age of five. She is a proud product of APS (Cochiti and Chaparral elementary schools, John Adams Middle School, and Valley High School). After college in Washington, D.C., she earned a master's degree in education from the University of Notre Dame and began her career as a fourth-grade teacher in Brownsville, Texas.\n\nGonzales now lives in the North Valley with her husband Tim, her three children, and her niece, all of whom attend APS charter schools.\n\nGonzales has dedicated her career to improving education in the United States with a focus on students of color. She wants to prioritize listening to those stakeholders who are closest to the issues: students, families, and educators, and recognize the assets and strengths that are brought by students of color, students from low-income backgrounds, LGBTQ students, English learners, and students with learning disabilities and differences. Her goal is to lift up and celebrate the district's success and not shy away from the challenges or the hard debates.\n\nGonzales wishes to bring examples of lessons learned and promising practices from other districts and education improvement efforts from across the state and across the country home to APS.\n\nIn addition to her master's degree from Notre Dame, Gonzales has a bachelor's degree in political science and Spanish language and literature from George Washington University.\n\nEducator of the Year Award - Jade Rivera\n\nJade Rivera is a native New Mexican, and proud product of public education. Ms. Rivera solidified her commitment to education after she joined Teach for America in Las Vegas, Nevada. During her time in the classroom, she achieved significant academic gains with her students. Realizing the tremendous impact of state and local policy on transforming education, Ms. Rivera went on to join the state of New Mexico’s Public Education Department as a Policy Administrator. At the Public Education Department Ms. Rivera directed innovative programs and professional development opportunities for educators across the state.\n\nIn 2016, Ms. Rivera was part of the 2016 Building Excellent Schools Fellowship, a highly selective year long program that trains leaders to take on the demanding and urgent work of leading high-achieving, college preparatory charter schools.\n\nIn 2018, Ms. Rivera founded and opened the doors of Albuquerque Collegiate Charter School, located in Albuquerque’s South Valley. Since its opening, Ms. Rivera and her team have led Albuquerque Collegiate to earn designations scoring in the top 10% of NM schools in literacy growth and proficiency, as well as student and family satisfaction.\n\nMs. Rivera holds a B.A. from the University of New Mexico and a M.Ed in Elementary Education from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. In 2020, Ms. Rivera was recognized as one of New Mexico’s “Top 40 Under 40” young professionals. Ms. Rivera enjoys volunteering with various non-profit organizations in Albuquerque, serving on the boards for Homewise, the Hispano Philanthropic Society, the Solare Collegiate Foundation, and Public Charter Schools of New Mexico.\n\nGuest Speaker- Kyle Stepp\n\nKyle is an internationally ranked elite para-triathlete, speaker, and social impact consultant, honored as a Business First 40 under 40 recipient. After growing up in boys' homes, overcoming childhood cancer and later limb loss in his 20s, he has soared into elite para-triathlon, proudly representing Team U.S.A. Kyle transforms personal challenges into advocacy for equitable healthcare, outdoor access, disability rights, and LGBTQ+ inclusion.\n\nAs an adept independent consultant, Kyle specializes in strategic partnerships, corporate social responsibility, fundraising, and inclusive marketing. He actively engages in political advocacy, championing disability and LGBTQ+ rights alongside promoting equitable healthcare and outdoor inclusion. Kyle's leadership extends to nonprofit organizations, building national partnerships and programs with entities like Children's Miracle Network Hospitals, Amputee Coalition, American Orthotic and Prosthetic Association, The Range of Motion Project, Outdoor F.U.T.U.R.E., Camp Enchantment New Mexico and others.\n\nAs a leading voice for disability and LGBTQ+ representation, Kyle collaborates with brands like Cotopaxi, On, and Lululemon to embed these values into their operations and marketing. His legislative efforts include spearheading New Mexico House Bill 131, which is one of the most comprehensive legislative reforms in the U.S. for the limb loss and limb difference community by creating equitable access to prosthetic and orthotic care for physical activity and now serves in a key role in the growth of the nationwide grassroots state-by-state legislative initiative So Every Body Can Move. Kyle extends his legislative passions through his service as a core member of Outdoor F.U.T.U.R.E., a national coalition working to ensure that nature's transformational powers are accessible to all of our nation's youth through creating a national equity fund. Kyle continues to serve in city and state appointments while advising elected officials and policymakers on inclusive policies impacting individuals with disabilities and underrepresented communities, showcasing his unwavering commitment to systemic change."
