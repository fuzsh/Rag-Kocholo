Diabetes mellitus is a lifestyle-altering diagnosis for the entire family. In some families, children and adolescents do not get the daily care they depend upon. This article reviews the consequences of medical neglect of children with diabetes and the optimal community response to concerns of medical neglect of diabetes. Criteria for placement in foster or substitute care are suggested.\n\nKeywords: Diabetes, Adherence, Neglect, Hyperglycemia, Hemoglobin A1c, Foster care, Children, Adolescents\n\nDiabetes mellitus was fatal until the discovery of insulin in 1921 (Bliss 2007). This and many advances in diabetes management since then have made living with diabetes a chronic rather than fatal disease. Patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) can now expect to live long and productive lives, but only if they are willing, and cognitively able, to follow a complex routine of daily self-care, and have the psychosocial and family support to do so. Children are a special population in that they do not have the cognitive skills and maturity necessary to manage their diabetes independently (Fonagy et al. 1987; Follansbee 1989). Support and supervision from a responsible adult caregiver is of upmost importance, and without this help, children with T1D can be at grave risk of acute and chronic health complications. Children whose diabetes care has suffered because of a lack of adult supervision and support may require intervention and assistance from child protection agencies (Geffken et al. 1992; Jenny, and Committee on Child Abuse and Neglect, American Academy of Pediatrics 2007; Boos and Fortin 2014). In fact, in a retrospective review (Fortin et al. 2016b), T1D was the most frequent diagnosis of 154 children reported to child protective services for medical neglect, present in ~10% of patients.\n\nThis comprehensive review is the first in the literature concerning medical neglect in children with diabetes, including recognition, contributing factors, and how child protective agencies should respond to accusations of medical neglect in children with diabetes. Standards of care for management of T1D and the consequences of poor management (i.e., short- and long-term complications of T1D) are reviewed first to give the reader a framework of necessary care for this population. Although the focus is children with T1D, much of the information is also applicable to children with type 2 diabetes (T2D), although weight management issues and lifestyle changes play a much bigger role in the management of T2D.\n\nMethods\n\nAn online PubMed search was performed from current records dating back to 1980 using multiple combinations of the following search terms: medication adherence; diabetes mellitus, type 1/diet therapy; diabetes mellitus, type 1/drug therapy; diabetes mellitus, type 1/therapy; child welfare; neglect; foster care; diabetes mellitus, type 1; child abuse; diabetes mellitus; medical neglect; and diabetes. Of 138 results from the combined searches, 19 were deemed relevant because they were written about children, T1D, glycemic control, challenges in children with T1D, complications of diabetes, medical neglect in children, and/or psychological and social phenomena related to children with T1D and/or their parents. Articles written about adults or those solely related to T2D were excluded, as were articles unrelated to the inclusion criteria listed above. Furthermore, the bibliographies of relevant papers were also reviewed. The search was updated prior to resubmission.\n\nInformation for this article was also obtained from the Northeast Region Medical Neglect Working Group, a collaboration of experts including representatives from the Florida Department of Children and Families, the First Coast Child Protection Team and Child Advocacy Center (CPT-CAC), the CPT-CAC psychologist, Children’s Legal Services, Nemours Children’s Health System-Jacksonville and the Northeast Florida Pediatric Diabetes Center. This group, which included three of the current authors (J.S., S.S., K.D.), met monthly in 2015 to develop a protocol for the investigation of reported medical neglect in children with T1D in Northeast Florida, and to train over 100 child protective investigators in the state of Florida. The working group developed the diabetes checklist (see section titled “Identifying Medical Neglect in Children with Type 1 Diabetes”), which has been adopted for use by the Florida Department of Children and Families (Shapiro 2015). The checklist is reproduced here with permission from the working group for the purpose of wider dissemination and use in future research.\n\nIn areas where there was no published literature specific to T1D, such as indicators for substitute care, expert opinion in other areas of pediatric healthcare and medical neglect were reviewed and adapted by the authors for use in children with T1D (National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel Report 3 (EPR-3) 2007). Furthermore, the indicators for substitute care (in the section titled “Psychosocial and Environmental Factors Contributing to Medical Neglect in Diabetes”) were also derived from multidisciplinary case evaluations involving CPT-CAC consultants plus child protective investigators and agency supervisors, attorneys with Children’s Legal Services, the CPT-CAC psychologist and sometimes the involved in-home service providers and therapists from September 2014 to December 2015.\n\nStandards of Care for Diabetes Management in Children\n\nSeveral organizations dedicated to patients and families with diabetes, including the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (Wolfsdorf et al. 2014), the American Assoc. of Clinical Endocrinologists (American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology 2015) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) (American Diabetes Association 2017) have established standards of care for management of diabetes, including guidelines specific for children. Table lists some of these medical standards of care and standards of care for addressing psychosocial issues, which should be assessed at diagnosis and continually throughout childhood. Developmentally-appropriate family involvement in the child’s diabetes management should be encouraged and reassessed regularly, with the help of a mental-health professional (Silverstein et al. 2005; American Diabetes Association 2017).\n\nTable 1\n\nClinic visits, ≥4 per yearSelf-home blood glucose monitoring, 4–6 per day or moreMultiple daily injections or use of an insulin pumpMeal planning, utilizing carbohydrate countingAnnual ophthalmology visits (after reaching 10 years old and having T1D for 3 or more years)Regular screening laboratory studies, including thyroid tests, screen for celiac disease, fasting lipids, and urine testingAppropriate and continued family involvement should be emphasized at diagnosis and assessed at each follow-up care. Shared decision-making should be a part of day-to-day diabetes managementContinual assessment of psychosocial issues and family stressors, at diagnosis and during routine follow-up careContinual assessment of social adjustment, peer relationships, and school performanceConsider referral to mental health professional for children and families with repeated admissions for DKA, behavioral concerns, or significant psychosocial stress\n\nManaging T1D is a demanding task for any family and requires extensive support from a care provider experienced with diabetes. Patients with diabetes should work closely with a diabetes team that includes adult or pediatric endocrinologists, certified diabetes educators (nurses, dietitians, and other healthcare workers experienced in the management of diabetes), and medical social workers or other psychosocial support specialists. At the time of diagnosis of T1D, patients and families ideally spend hours with the diabetes team in learning to manage the condition. Education is ongoing even long after diagnosis, and the ADA recommends at least annual follow-up education (American Diabetes Association 2017).\n\nModern technological advances, including continuous glucose monitors and insulin pumps, have improved the care of children and adults with diabetes, and are quickly becoming standard of care. However, because they are not yet fully automated, the devices still require frequent input by the user, and patients are not free from meal planning, home blood glucose monitoring (HBGM), and manually providing insulin doses for meals and high blood sugars. Thus, children with T1D still need help from adults even when using the latest technology in diabetes management.\n\nFor any child, and many adults, the insulin regimen is complex and can be overwhelming. Children and adolescents have varying abilities to participate in diabetes self-management depending on their developmental age, maturation and cognitive skills (Fonagy et al. 1987; Follansbee 1989). Parental involvement is therefore necessary throughout childhood and adolescence to assure appropriate self-management and metabolic control.\n\nEven patients with excellent diabetes control will experience high and low blood sugars at times. Low blood sugars (hypoglycemia) can occur during exercise and under other circumstances, and high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) can occur with acute illness (Jeffries et al. 2015). Furthermore, insulin needs change as children grow and progress through puberty, requiring frequent dose adjustments (Amiel et al. 1986). Additionally, like any mechanical device, insulin pumps can fail, predisposing to hyperglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA; see section titled “Poor Diabetes Control and Complications of Diabetes”). Mistakes can be made with carbohydrate counting or insulin dosing, leading to hypo- or hyperglycemia. Episodic fluctuations in blood sugars are therefore common and themselves may not necessarily reflect medical neglect or even poor control. In many circumstances these fluctuations can be managed with appropriate planning, ongoing adherence, and communication with the medical team.\n\nThe degree of diabetes control is routinely assessed (usually at each quarterly clinic visit) using hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), a blood test that correlates with the average blood sugar levels over the last two to three months. For the best long-term health outcomes, the ADA recommends a goal for HbA1c of <7% in adults and < 7.5% for children (American Diabetes Association 2017).\n\nPoor Diabetes Control and Complications of Diabetes\n\nPoor diabetes care, whether due to medical neglect or not, can lead to acute and chronic complications. It is essential for the child welfare professional to be familiar with and document the possible risks to child safety caused by poor diabetes care when investigating possible medical neglect. Acute complications of diabetes include severe hypoglycemia, which can cause seizures and can impair brain function (Geffken et al. 1992; Jeffries et al. 2015), or DKA. DKA causes vomiting and dehydration, often leads to hospitalization in the intensive care unit, and can cause brain swelling, stroke or even death (Azad et al. 2017). DKA can be an indicator the child is not receiving enough insulin and is often seen when there are concerns of medical neglect. In fact, 60% of DKA episodes occur in up to 5% of children with recurring events (Jeffries et al. 2015) and 20% of children with diabetes account for 80% of pediatric intensive care hospitalizations (Rosenbloom 2007). Missed medical appointments has also been correlated with frequency of DKA episodes (Fortin et al. 2016a). Many of these episodes of DKA are preventable and can be attributed to medical neglect if full evaluation does not verify an underlying medical explanation or parental efforts to render care.\n\nOther (chronic) complications of diabetes are a result of poor glycemic control over many years. These include but are not limited to effects on brain development and function (Barnea-Goraly et al. 2014; Mauras et al. 2015), eye disease (retinopathy), kidney dysfunction (nephropathy), and nerve damage (neuropathy). The risk of these complications is directly related to the degree of diabetes control. A HbA1c >9% is considered very poor glycemic control, indicating a significantly greater risk for chronic complications, and for a shorter and lower quality of life (Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) Research Group 1993).\n\nIdentifying Medical Neglect in Children with Type 1 Diabetes\n\nA failure to consistently complete any of the standards of diabetes care can be harmful to anyone with diabetes, increasing the risk of both short- and long-term complications of diabetes; this failure may be a consequence of medical neglect. It is important to carefully consider each investigation individually, noting the particular barriers and resources of each patient and family. There are usually several contributing factors in cases of neglect related to T1D. However, it is very important to recognize that not all episodes of non-adherence are medical neglect, and it is critical that the diabetes care team and child protective agencies distinguish between serious medical neglect versus unintentional errors with documented attempts to correct those errors in the medical records. In most cases, errors in home management would not be reported to a child abuse hotline. The investigator should request assistance from a pediatric endocrinologist, a pediatrician specializing in child maltreatment, or another healthcare provider to help distinguish episodic errors from medical neglect.\n\nMedical neglect is a complex, multi-faceted issue (Dubowitz et al. 2000; Jenny, and Committee on Child Abuse and Neglect, American Academy of Pediatrics 2007), occurring when a child’s medical care needs are not met, resulting in injury or placing them at risk of harm (Boos and Fortin 2014). Five criteria (Jenny, and Committee on Child Abuse and Neglect, American Academy of Pediatrics 2007) are suggested when diagnosing medical neglect: (1) the child is being harmed or at risk of harm due to lack of health care, (2) the care that is widely offered must provide a benefit to the child, (3) the benefit of treatment is such that a reasonable caregiver would choose treatment over non-treatment, (4) evidence of available healthcare that is not utilized, and (5) the caregiver understands the medical advice given. Child welfare investigators will need to collaborate with healthcare professionals, medical social workers, court authorities, and the family in order to comprehensively assess all five criteria.\n\nDecades of research demonstrate that a child can clearly be harmed by a lack of diabetes care, though many of the complications are not seen until years later (Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) Research Group 1993). Harm to the child can be due to many factors, including poor adherence with any aspect of diabetes care (e.g., blood glucose monitoring, insulin injections, and/or poor clinic attendance), a lack of adult supervision (Hegelson et al. 2008; Young et al. 2014), or failure to maintain adequate medications and supplies necessary for proper diabetes management (Shapiro 2015). Further, without sufficient blood glucose monitoring, insulin doses have to be estimated and correction insulin doses (bringing high blood sugars back to target) cannot be properly given, increasing the risk of severe hypo- or hyperglycemic episodes. Missing insulin doses places the child at imminent risk of DKA as well as the long-term microvascular complications of diabetes. Furthermore, inadequate carbohydrate counting results in incorrect insulin doses, which also predisposes to hypo- or hyperglycemia. Lastly, poor adherence can result in repeated hospitalizations or emergency room visits and subsequent morbidities resulting from DKA or the possible complications of any necessary medical interventions.\n\nFor young children, it is the parent’s or guardian’s responsibility to make sure all diabetes supplies are obtained without fail and all management tasks are completed on a daily basis and in a timely manner (see Table ). Even for older children and teenagers, it is essential that an adult supervises and ensures blood sugars are monitored, carbohydrates are accurately counted and not estimated, and calculated insulin doses are given as prescribed (Hegelson et al. 2008; Wysocki et al. 2009; Young et al. 2014). A lack of consistent and adequate supervision is a form of medical neglect.\n\nThe caregiver should be able to demonstrate proper diabetes management skills. Caregivers also need to respond to signs of illness, institute sick day management changes, and communicate with the diabetes team as needed (e.g., when there are consistent problems with low or high blood sugars, for problems obtaining prescriptions or supplies, or related concerns).\n\nPoor adherence will be evident by infrequent clinic visits, or it may be apparent during clinic visits. Poor adherence with blood glucose monitoring will be noted when the blood glucose meter is downloaded in clinic and the data reviewed by the diabetes team. The HbA1c may be elevated, indicating poor diabetes control. If the HbA1c does not improve despite medical intervention accompanied by child and family diabetes education, medical neglect needs to be considered. It is essential for child welfare investigators to consider that a HbA1c repeatedly over 9% without improvement indicates the diabetes is chronically poorly controlled, despite any claims of daily adherence made by a parent or child. Child welfare investigators should ask for the HbA1c results if not provided in the initial hotline report.\n\nPsychosocial and Environmental Factors Contributing to Medical Neglect in Diabetes\n\nThere are many factors that should be explored when there are concerns of medical neglect and poor diabetes care. They can be categorized into difficulties with access to care, understanding the complexity of care, caregiver motivation and concern, and child behavior or parenting issues. These complex factors are reviewed here, and potential interventions are discussed in the following section.\n\nIt is essential that all children with diabetes have access to appropriate care. Many families who find themselves involved with child welfare agencies may not have a local pediatric endocrinologist and a team experienced in the management of children with diabetes, especially in rural areas. Families may instead have to utilize pediatricians or other primary care physicians, or in the case of a crisis, an emergency care facility. Child welfare workers may need to work with Medicaid, health insurance companies, or the primary care physician to identify options for adequate care. Even when specialty services are available, transportation may be challenging not only for clinic visits, but also for obtaining prescriptions or visiting grocery stores (Fortin et al. 2016b). Nutritional challenges may present themselves not only in rural areas, but also in some urban areas where fresh and healthy foods are not readily available. Further still, even if barriers to obtaining healthy food can be overcome, families may not have the time, skill, knowledge, or even the cooking equipment for meal preparation at home. These are difficulties the child welfare investigator can discover on a home visit and help remedy through case management support or parental skill-building.\n\nFamilies may also face significant challenges in utilizing insurance (Svoren et al. 2003). With Medicaid or state children’s health insurance programs, the application process can be lengthy and overwhelming, especially for families who move frequently or have unpredictable access to telephone service. Once insurance is obtained, high co-pays or deductibles can be another barrier to receiving supplies or medicines, or even clinical care (Rabin et al. 2017). Navigating these processes requires not only a proactive caregiver, but also one with basic literacy, and organizational and comprehension skills. Coordinating with pharmacies (sometimes more than one), insurance companies, and healthcare providers can require multiple phone calls and note-taking, which can be overwhelming to some caregivers. Compiling a list of contacts and resources with phone numbers, making a to-do list, and starting a calendar of appointments and needed refills can greatly assist some caregivers. Other families may require more long-term support from a medical case manager.\n\nThe management of children with T1D requires complex thought and planning, as well as frequent use of math skills (American Diabetes Association 2017). A caregiver with limited cognitive skills, poor literacy or poor math abilities may not be able to count carbohydrates and calculate insulin doses, even with the assistance of a calculator or smartphone application. Caregivers who lack these skills may be ashamed and fear admitting these difficulties, which can lead to cover-up behaviors and avoidance of healthcare visits. Caregiver misunderstanding of diabetes may lead to a lack of vigilance because the child does not “look sick” or experience obvious symptoms, even though the diabetes is not well-managed. Familiarity can also cause complacency in families where several adults have diabetes, even in families where severe consequences have been observed (such as blindness, kidney failure or limb amputations), as they may view these complications as “normal.” Helping a caregiver recognize these potential barriers is necessary in overcoming their effect on the child’s diabetes management. The investigator should also help the primary caregiver identify someone else who may be able to regularly assist in management. This person should participate in formal diabetes education and demonstrate an ability to safely manage the child’s diabetes. If there is no identifiable secondary caregiver who possesses the complex cognitive skills necessary for managing T1D, the child welfare worker may need to work with the healthcare team in order to develop safe and realistic goals of treatment.\n\nA caregiver’s misunderstanding of child development can lead to unrealistic expectations of a child with diabetes (Markowitz et al. 2015). A young child, or cognitively impaired teen, will not be able to count carbohydrates, do calculations and administer insulin accurately without assistance. Even teenagers with the necessary knowledge and technical abilities are unlikely to have the maturity, motivation and cognitive skills necessary to maintain self-care multiple times per day without adult supervision and support (Follansbee 1989). Assuming chronologic age correlates with maturity and the ability to be independent with diabetes management may lead to inadequate caregiver supervision. Additionally, caregivers may blame the child for making suboptimal decisions, such as “sneaking” food when chronically insulin-deprived. A home visitor or investigator may find the food is locked-up or out-of-reach of the child, even when the basic insulin needs and blood glucose care are not provided. “Sneaking” food will not cause DKA and will not likely necessitate an emergency room visit but will contribute to chronically poorly controlled diabetes and long-term complications. Lack of insulin, erroneous insulin dosing, or lack of food and fluids, however, can cause the acute complications of diabetes described above. Allegations that the child has been sneaking food as a cause of repeated admissions for DKA are a red flag for medical neglect with inappropriate child-blaming, or at least poor diabetes adherence and understanding. Lastly, parental mental health difficulties also correlate with poor health outcomes for children with T1D (Butwicka et al. 2013). If a child welfare worker recognizes a potential mental health concern in the parent or other caregiver, appropriate referrals for mental healthcare could in turn benefit the child’s diabetes management.\n\nCommon adolescent behaviors may complicate assessments of medical neglect and threaten the child’s health, even in the most competent and responsible child. Diabetes control typically declines during adolescence (Miller et al. 2015). Adolescents view themselves as invincible; they do not grasp the long-term consequence of uncontrolled diabetes (Borus and Laffel 2010). Though in need of assistance, they are often resistant to supervision and demand privacy. Adolescents have an innate need to fit in with peers, so they may feel embarrassed and try to hide their diabetes, especially if they have experienced or witnessed bullying at school (Storch et al. 2006). It is not uncommon for teenagers to be dishonest about their adherence with diabetes care, which can lead to dangerous increases in the prescribed insulin doses (Osborn et al. 2013), causing hypoglycemia. Furthermore, poor diabetes control can lead to weight loss, and some teens will intentionally cause this in a phenomenon sometimes referred to as “diabulemia.” (Larranaga et al. 2011; Ducat et al. 2015.) Depression rates are elevated among adolescents with T1D, and depressive symptoms have been linked with more frequent hospitalizations for diabetes complications (Stewart et al. 2005). Some adolescents will have extreme and dangerous behaviors such as running away, experimenting with drugs and/or alcohol, or sexual promiscuity, or they may challenge the caregiver’s ability to assist them with health care. In these cases, medical neglect may be refuted if the parent has made reasonable efforts in managing the care, including obtaining mental health care. Schreiner et al. (2000) identify behaviors of teenagers with diabetes that impact their management and offer approaches to address these needs.\n\nThe lifestyle changes required for diabetes care and the challenges of adolescence, combined with limited parenting skills, can exacerbate difficulty with diabetes management. Often parents feel guilty that the child has a chronic illness and are therefore unlikely to utilize standard behavioral management techniques like rewards and consequences. They may be less willing to firmly reinforce the necessity of diabetes care, especially when the child argues or refuses assistance. Parents of teenagers often state that they cannot “force” compliance. Children and caregivers may also simply get tired of completing diabetes care, which is referred to as “burnout” (Greene 2009; Naranjo and Hood 2012). It is essential that a guardian who identifies non-adherent behaviors address these concerns with the medical team, and a referral to a mental health specialist should be made. Further, mental health care (e.g., counseling) can be ordered by juvenile courts. Failure to comply with any recommended or ordered mental health care can also constitute, or exacerbate, medical neglect (see Table ). Discrepant diabetes control accompanied by significant behavioral or mental health disabilities can be acutely life-threatening, especially with a recent history of DKA (Rewers et al. 2002; Garrison et al. 2005; Stewart et al. 2005).\n\nTable 3\n\nIndicators for substitute care1. Parent/guardian has not obtained or provided an alternative, personally-known caregiver to assist with managing diabetes care.2. Parent/guardian has not obtained or provided insulin or other diabetes care to a designated alternative caregiver (or school) on two or more occasions, and without extenuating circumstances.3. Two or more episodes of DKA or other diabetes-related ICU hospitalization in less than 14 days, because of non-adherence to daily management.4. Two or more episodes of DKA in a single 12-month period (related to non-adherence or lack of supervision).5. Three or more emergency department visits related to non-adherence to diabetes treatment in a 12-month period.5. Parent/guardian is only adherent to needed healthcare with persistent involvement of support teams.6. Parent/guardian cannot demonstrate important skills or changed behaviors in spite of renewed education and supervision.7. Parent/guardian with rigid nutrition or medication beliefs or practices that have adversely affected child’s health, and not alleviated with substantial education by diabetes team and/or the child protection investigator.8. Parent/guardian in need of mental health or substance abuse treatment that is refused, causing parent to be incapable of managing the child’s diabetes safely.9. Failure of parent/guardian to bring a child having difficulty coping with diabetes management to recommended mental health care.10. Stagnant or increasing HbA1c despite intensive case management.\n\nFrequent changes in caregivers can also contribute to medical neglect, especially if not all care providers have been trained in managing diabetes. It is essential that all adults caring for a child with diabetes be competent in all diabetes management aspects, including completing glucose checks and providing insulin (or close supervision for teenagers who self-administer insulin). All caregivers must communicate with one another to lessen the chance mistakes in diabetes management are made, especially when the management plan has been changed, the child has signs of possible illness, or the blood glucose results are not in the target range. It is the responsibility of the primary guardian to ensure the child is in safe hands if spending time with friends or relatives (Wysocki et al. 2009). Placing a child with T1D in the care of an adult who has not had diabetes education, lacks diabetes management skills, or does not have the necessary supplies and medications, puts that child at high risk for diabetes-complications, acute and chronic. This too is medical neglect.\n\nConsistency in caregiving is equally important in the school setting. Unfortunately, not all schools have funding for full-time nurses, but all schools receiving federal funding are legally obligated to accommodate a student’s medical needs (U.S. Department of Education 2015; American Diabetes Association 2016a, b). Issues like truancy, behavioral disruptions, or transfer between schools can complicate diabetes care in schools. It is essential for the guardians of a child with diabetes to maintain close contact with school personnel regarding the child’s medical and educational needs. The school nurse or other school personnel, when necessary, should be instrumental in assisting children and families with diabetes care. A caregiver needs to be aware of any problems with school attendance and when the child is not routinely receiving assistance from the school nurse. Being unaware of school-related diabetes management concerns will contribute to medical neglect.\n\nEven with child welfare intervention, successful adherence to diabetes regimens may still not be possible. Child protective services should assess the behavioral, developmental, psychosocial and emotional needs of every child prior to case plan implementation, recognizing that there may be language, cultural or religious differences or other ethnic barriers that impact diabetes adherence (Naranjo et al. 2012). Infants and toddlers prove to be a special challenge given their different nutrition requirements, activity levels and developmental age-appropriate behaviors. For adolescents, challenges such as running away or oppositional defiant behaviors can also be barriers. If a child is a frequent runaway, even if adherence is initially successful, repeated or prolonged time away from home makes it difficult to ensure ongoing adherence. Children who frequently run away are also exposed to other activities that make adherence even more challenging, such as substance abuse, gang activity, sexual promiscuity, prostitution or human trafficking. Other patient-centered concerns include children who are simply uncooperative despite a vigilant caregiver. Whether due to rebellion, mental health problems, or fear of treatment, a patient who steadfastly believes he or she can independently make decisions for him or herself can be difficult to control. If the involved caregiver is making reasonable efforts, it may not be logical to hold him or her accountable for poorly controlled diabetes involving an older child actively engaged in anti-social behavior or self-neglect. Review of medical records in these cases should reflect the caregiver’s attempts to seek help and interact with the diabetes team or other healthcare professionals. The medical record review should also look for cancelled but rescheduled appointments, acceptance of mental health referrals and ongoing psychosocial and emotional support for the child, and attempted involvements with alternate caregivers and care settings (e.g., school, another parent’s or relative’s home, a group home, during hospitalizations, etc.). Review of prior protective service case records should also reflect appropriate police (such as for runaway reports) and child protective service involvements.\n\nRecommended Community Responses to Concerns of Medical Neglect\n\nIt is imperative that the child welfare system has a clear understanding of how to assess and respond to concerns of medical neglect of children with diabetes. Child protection investigators, caseworkers, children’s rights attorneys, guardians ad litem and juvenile dependency court judges who are not educated as to the risks of poor diabetes management can make poor decisions on behalf of children with diabetes (Geffken et al. 1992). When medical neglect is reported, a comprehensive approach is required for the best outcome. The medical, psychosocial and environmental factors are complex and provide areas of assessment for the child welfare professional who is investigating potential medical neglect. A family may present with one or more mitigating factors that make adherence to T1D treatment challenging. In addition, these factors may exacerbate an already stressful diagnosis. It is often challenging for the child welfare professional to relate poor T1D management to tangible evidence of harm, when presented as a request for non-judicial or judicial intervention. The child welfare professional who can demonstrate harm as a result of multiple contributing factors may be more likely to succeed in advocating for intervention on the child’s behalf. Understanding the root causes of adverse behaviors will allow child welfare professionals to formulate case planning tasks and outcomes to address long-term behavior changes in the families.\n\nA home evaluation checklist has been developed for use by child protection investigators and other home visitors (Table ) (Shapiro 2015). In assessing the criteria for medical neglect, the child should be personally evaluated. A child who is found unarousable in the home, or with repeated vomiting, abdominal pain or generalized illness, should be provided emergent care. If the child is not home, or is walking around and well-appearing, an in-home assessment of medications and supplies provides a starting point. It is not enough to see if non-expired medicines and supplies are present; their quantities should be reviewed to assess compliance with using medications as prescribed – in fact, full bottles of insulin or supply containers can indicate poor adherence with treatment because of non-use. Medications and supplies should be stored safely and out-of-reach of other children in the home. A sharps disposal plan should be observed. Once adequate medications and supplies to meet the child’s need are confirmed, in-home evaluation of the child’s HBGM skills, parents’ ability to make dose calculations, child supervision, and recording of results can all be used as metrics to gauge the level of understanding and adherence. If possible, the child protection worker can supervise the family while checking a blood sugar at the home visit or confirm blood sugar results on the blood glucose meter. Assessing the blood glucose meter’s memory can provide the worker with an idea of how often the glucose is being monitored.\n\nChild protective team members must have a basic understanding of diabetes management. For this reason, diabetes medical neglect cases should be assigned to workers with specialized training and experience. If this is not possible, an identified expert knowledgeable in diabetes can help during the investigation process.\n\nTo assist the child with the diabetes management and daily routine, child protective services should ask the family to identify one or more educated adults in the child’s life who can assist in addition to the primary caregiver. This may be a neighbor, frequently-visiting relative, or an adult sibling. A best practice is to identify at least one person at the child’s school who can assist with daily diabetes care – this is especially important for schools who do not have a full-time nurse on site. The family should provide name and contact information for any support persons identified. These additional caregivers should ensure the child has his/her own working blood glucose meter, review blood sugar checking times, possess knowledge of the sick day plan, and provide evidence of ongoing school nurse or other staff member involvement. If appropriate, child protective services can assist with checking for smartphone applications and help increase the working caregiver and child’s ability to use texting as a method of communication.\n\nIn further reviewing familial adherence to recommendations, the family must be able to provide medical care team information, physician name and diabetes team contact information, and the next appointment’s date, time and location. Medical records from both the primary healthcare provider and the diabetes treatment team, including laboratory results, should be reviewed with the assistance of the healthcare team. Pharmacy records from the previous year can indicate how often insulin and other prescriptions are obtained. Identifying when the most recent diabetes education was received, and by whom, is important. In addition to any specialized medical care, such as the pediatric endocrinology team and any other subspecialists if appropriate, the child should also have a primary care physician identified and be current with all preventive care, such as routine well child care, immunizations (including an annual flu shot), etc. The family should also be able to articulate plans for adherence in the future, including diabetes camp attendance if possible, perceived barriers to future care, and plans to address any current challenges.\n\nWhen the child’s current medical status and needs have been assessed, child protective services should identify any other possible factors that may be hindering adherence. Depression or other mental health challenges of the caregiver, the child with diabetes, or other family members can prevent the family from making progress. Several behavioral components for both the caregivers and the child must also be assessed, including unwillingness to adhere to recommendations, resentment, blaming, or isolation. If voluntary intervention services are placed in-home, the case manager should be aware of all possible barriers, most notably transportation, financial stress, and sibling childcare (Fortin et al. 2016a, 2016b), and have the ability to coordinate the family’s needs with healthcare providers.\n\nFailed improvement of diabetes evidenced by a stagnant (≥9%) or increasing HbA1c despite intensive case management supervision with appropriate interventions is a possible indication for foster or substitute care. Further, a parent or guardian demonstrating any combination of two or more of the items listed in Table should be considered unable or unwilling to care for the child regardless of intensive social support. It is important to note that the criteria listed in Table are the authors’ recommendations. They were adapted for T1D from existing NIH expert panel criteria for uncontrolled asthma (National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel Report 3 (EPR-3) 2007) and could be validated in future studies specific to medical neglect in children with diabetes.\n\nIt is a clear problem when the parent is only adherent to necessary healthcare with persistent involvement of services. This can be easily observed when voluntary or in-home case management services are used as an alternative to court-ordered services. If case management services have been in place for a period of time but the case manager is still taking the lead role in scheduling appointments or filling prescriptions, further intervention may be necessary to ensure the child’s needs are met long-term (such as a prolonged case plan while support is gradually withdrawn). The T1D medical neglect case plan must include objective outcomes, such as HbA1c measurements, frequency of home glucose monitoring, emergency room visits, hospitalizations and clinic visits, pharmacy records, and number of school days missed. The case plan may also include subjective measurements, such as behavioral assessments, parental involvement, availability of supplies, utilization of insurance, ability to demonstrate proper dose calculations, and more. A case plan that does not include measureable outcomes specifically related to diabetes will fail to protect the child from the short- and long-term risks and complications. The diabetes checklist (Table ) and indicators for substitute care (Table ) can be used to assess improvement (or lack thereof) after case plan interventions have occurred, in preparation for reunification of the child and primary caregiver, or in petitioning the court for alternative placement of the child. For example, a rising HbA1c (indicating worsening diabetes control) refutes caregiver claims of compliance with daily care and should be reported to the court once the healthcare team has ruled-out other underlying causes for the declining diabetes control.\n\nFor adolescents over 16 years of age, there may be hesitation to place the child in foster care because they will quickly age out of the foster care system and may be more difficult to control for substitute caregivers. Older children placed into foster care are more likely to reside in a group home, creating new challenges with supervision and proper medical attention. Healthcare providers should be aware of this and strongly consider reporting medical neglect long before the child turns 16 to facilitate the appropriate protective responses of the child protection system. Doing this also may enhance the chance of a successful transition to adult health care once the adolescent turns 18 years old (Agarwal et al. 2017; Wiebe et al. 2016).\n\nEven for younger children, foster placement presents its own challenges to successful intervention. Availability of specialized medical foster homes tends to be low but presents the best opportunity for a child or teen with diabetes to experience excellent diabetes care. Placement in foster care is generally time-limited, and once the child is out of foster care, the child will again be at risk (Geffken et al. 1992). Furthermore, once children are placed in foster care, the primary caregivers are no longer responsible for diabetes care, possibly leading to increased complacency and lack of familiarity with the child’s needs. To combat this, case plans should be developed for children in out-of-home care to help ensure primary caregivers can remain engaged while working on reunification. Repeat assessments of the caregiver’s behaviors and continued improvement in the child’s daily diabetes management after the caregiver is permitted to spend more time with the child is vital.\n\nFinal reunification of a child with the primary caregiver should not be solely based on case plan completion. It should not occur until the primary caregiver has shown measurable behavior changes in regard to adherence and without a renewed rise of the HbA1c. This can be challenging not only for the parent but also for the child welfare professional, compounded even more by suggested permanency timeframes at 12 months (H.R.867 - Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, 105th Congress Public Law 89 1997). Outcomes for children who “age out” of foster care tend to be poor, making safe reunification of the child the preferred form of permanency (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2010). The child welfare professional should therefore seek to improve the caregiver’s protective capacities to drive positive behavior change and reduce recidivism after intervention has ceased. These protective capacities may be diminished at the time of removal and must be enhanced for intervention to terminate. The in-home diabetes checklist (Table ) can be repeated and compared to the prior performance of the checklist. Continued placement or reunification with a non-adherent caregiver will only repeat the cycle of medical neglect, poor compliance, and poor diabetes control, and further increase the risk of acute and chronic complications, or death (Geffken et al. 1992).\n\nConclusions\n\nThe diagnosis of diabetes in children necessitates a major lifestyle change for families. Health professionals provide guidance and treatment planning on a long-term basis, but daily management is the responsibility of the caregivers. Chronic hyperglycemia can cause acute and chronic morbidity, even death and disability, although long-term complications often do not occur until adulthood. Multiple logistic and psychosocial barriers exist that hinder successful management for many families. When medical neglect is suspected, the child welfare system can assess family functioning and in-home adherence, provide intervention to overcome any barriers to successful diabetes care, and reassess for improvement during and after interventions. Voluntary in-home services can provide the least intrusive means of helping families. However, although the goal is to maintain the child in his or her current living environment, extenuating circumstances may necessitate removal to protect the child’s well-being, while the caregivers continue their case plans and improved behaviors to ensure that upon reunification the child with diabetes is safe and medical needs can be met.\n\nCompliance with Ethical Standards\n\nConflict of Interest\n\nOn behalf of all authors, the corresponding author states that there is no conflict of interest."
