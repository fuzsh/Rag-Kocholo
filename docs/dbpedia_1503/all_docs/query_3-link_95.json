        "text": "On newly released audio excerpts from the federal criminal investigation, Adidas executive Jim Gatto sounds more like a beleaguered corporate bureaucrat than a white-collar kingpin.\n\nA portrait emerges of a sports marketing executive beset by budget issues, in-house rivalries and the mundane demands of his job at the company's North American headquarters in Portland. Illicit payments to college basketball players are discussed so matter-of-factly they might as well have been buying paper clips.\n\nThere is no indication in the audio clips that Gatto had any suspicion that he was a lead suspect in a sprawling federal criminal investigation that would alter the landscape of college basketball and make him a convicted felon barely a year later.\n\nGatto, former Adidas consultant Merl Code and budding sports agent Christian Dawkins were convicted Wednesday on wire fraud and conspiracy charges for using cash and swag to steer prep basketball stars to Adidas-affiliated universities. Prosecutors said the defendants defrauded Louisville, Kansas and North Carolina State when they gave five recruits anywhere from $2,500 to $90,000. The payments violate NCAA rules, opening the schools up to possible NCAA sanctions and financial penalties.\n\nFederal wiretaps played a key role the three-week trial in U.S. District Court in New York. The snippets of conversation offered outsiders an intriguing look at the case and helped explain the mindset driving some players in the big-time sports endorsement game.\n\nHere are four takeaways from the audio selections, which have been edited for clarity and length.\n\nEVERYBODY'S DOING IT\n\nThe Adidas officials evidently operated under the assumption that black-market money was flowing freely in college basketball and that they had to offer cash to compete. Keeping athletes out of the clutches of industry leader Nike seemed particularly important.\n\nCode called Gatto one day with the news that the University of Miami, an Adidas school, was hoping for a little help landing top prospect Nassir Little.\n\nCODE: So, here's the deal. There's a kid named Nassir Little who's top five or six in the country who (Miami head basketball coach Jim) Larranaga and those guys really want. The problem is, Arizona's offered the kid [$150,000], and we're trying to keep him from going to one of their schools.\" (Code is presumably referring here to Nike, which has a long-standing sponsorship deal with Arizona.)\n\nGATTO: So, this will be '18. When would they need the money?\n\nCODE: Uh, again, it doesn't have to be all in one lump sum. I can, I can make it work if you're saying you'll do it.\"\n\nGATTO: I just don't know if I, I just don't know if I can do anything in '17. That's what I'm saying. In January of '18 is -- you know, I could do it all.\"\n\nLittle, a 6-6 small forward, eventually landed at North Carolina, a Nike school.\n\n2. SAD STATE OF THE BASKETBALL MARKET\n\nOne of the great ironies of the corruption trial is that the Adidas officials seemed willing to shatter NCAA regulations and even violate federal law to gain share of a declining business. Basketball as a category has been weak for two years.\n\nIn one conversation, Gatto told Dawkins, the aspiring agent, that Adidas had very little interest in sponsoring so-called \"big men\" - centers -- and was actually cutting back its basketball endorsements.\n\nDAWKINS: So, you guys don't even want to sign bigs unless they're just like a superstar, basically?\n\nGATTO: No, not even. I mean, that's where we are today. You know, we turn around our business, and things changing in a year or two, you know, maybe, you know?\n\nDAWKINS: The, the, the market for bigs is going to be s**t all around, because if you guys ain't paying it, Nike's damn sure not going to pay.\n\nGATTO: Right. You're right. And you've got to understand, we're cutting our portfolio. Now, now, just so you know, and Nike, I think, is starting to do it, too, the basketball business in general is down 25 percent.\n\nThe Shoe Wars\n\nThe wiretaps caught Code explaining the competitive landscape to two others, one of whom was an undercover FBI agent. As the agent pushes for more information, Code engages in fascinating mental gymnastics to justify the Adidas payments.\n\nCODE: \"Let me kind of give you the backstory. You guys are being introduced to the shoe wars. This is one of those instances we needed to step up and help one of our flagship schools in Louisville secure a five-star caliber kid. So, we had to do some things to help.\n\nUNDERCOVER AGENT: \"This is all new to me, and you're the expert here. So, this is something that Adidas obviously does with top kids going to Adidas schools. They're able to give them some sort of compensation?\"\n\nCODE: \"No. We're not engaging in a monetary l relationship with an amateur athlete. We're engaging in a monetary relationship with a biz manager. And whatever he does with it, that's between him and the family.\"\n\nSo, no, we can't. But when it comes to one of our flagship schools, we're more apt to try to help that particular business agent. It helps them, it helps us.\"\n\n4. With friends like that...\n\nThe strangest bit of dialogue released by federal prosecutors was a Sept. 11, 2017, exchange between Gatto and T. J. Gassnola, a colorful and controversial character who allegedly helped Gatto deliver payments. In whirlwind fashion, Gassnola pleads with Gatto to help him with his expenses, urges Gatto to stand up for himself to his corporate rivals and assures him of his lasting loyalty.\n\nGASSNOLA: Just so you know, I gotta send this guy another 20 grand out on Wednesday because I gotta get him out from under this Under Armor deal, and the deal he's got with this guy who was taking care of him. He wants his money back now because the kid didn't go to Maryland, so I gotta stay on top of that. I just can't have this thing catapult in my face, but I don't want to do anything to harm you.\n\nGATTO: You're not going to harm...\n\nGASSNOLA: I haven't given you an expense report, ever, this year because of the f***ing joke, because of the joke. But I still gotta do what I gotta do. And you and I will always figure it out, but after this, you're going to have to get me another something.\n\nGATTO: Put it all down, put everything down, man. You gotta put it down, all who we owe for the rest of the year, plus your salary, expenses, everything.\n\nGASSNOLA: I'm going to break down all my expenses in the next month and I'll email so you have it. So, everything I've done this year, not the f***ing, not the underground stuff, but everything else I've done. Look man, look. As long as I've known you, you've f***ing always stood proud -- you've been good for me with that. Like, you have. So, I'm just returning the favor.\n\nGassnola's allegiance to Gatto lasted until last spring, when federal investigators closed in. In April, Gassnola cut a plea deal with prosecutors and agreed to testify against Gatto.\n\nGatto, Code and Dawkins -- whose lawyers declined comment for this report -- are scheduled to be sentenced in March. Though each federal charge carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, most experts say they will receiver considerably lighter sentences.\n\n--Jeff Manning"
