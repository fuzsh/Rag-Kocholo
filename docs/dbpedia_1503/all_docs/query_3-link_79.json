        "text": "Private university in Coral Gables, Florida\n\nThis article is about the university in Florida. For the university in Ohio, see Miami University.\n\nThe University of Miami (UM, UMiami, Miami, U of M, and The U[8][9]) is a private research university in Coral Gables, Florida. As of 2023 , the university enrolled 19,593 students[4] in two colleges and eight schools across nearly 350 academic majors and programs, including the Miller School of Medicine in Miami's Health District, the law school on the main campus, the Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science on Virginia Key, and additional research facilities in southern Miami-Dade County.[10]\n\nThe University of Miami offers 148 undergraduate, 148 master's, and 67 doctoral degree programs.[4][11] With 19,334 faculty and staff as of 2023, the University of Miami is the second-largest employer in Miami-Dade County.[12] The university's main campus in Coral Gables spans 240 acres (0.97 km2), has over 5,700,000 square feet (530,000 m2) of buildings, and is located 7 miles (11 km) southwest of Downtown Miami, the heart of the nation's ninth-largest and world's 65th-largest metropolitan area. As of 2023, it is the 75th-largest research university in the nation with annual research expenditures of $456 million.[4]\n\nAs of 2023, the University of Miami has 229,710 alumni from all 50 states and 174 foreign nations.[13] University of Miami faculty include a number of notable academics across nearly all disciplines, including four Nobel Prize recipients. The university is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\" and is a member of the Association of American Universities.[14][15]\n\nThe University of Miami's intercollegiate athletic teams are collectively known as the Miami Hurricanes and compete in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association.[16] Its football team has won five national championships since 1983,[17] and its baseball team has won four national championships since 1982.[18]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nLeadership\n\n[edit]\n\nBowman Foster Ashe (1926 to 1952)\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Bowman Foster Ashe\n\nIn 1925, the University of Miami was founded by a group of citizens who sought to offer \"unique opportunities to develop inter-American studies, further creative work in the arts and letters, and conduct teaching and research programs in tropical studies\", according to the university's founding charter.[21] They believed that a local university would benefit the Miami metropolitan area and were optimistic that the university would be a beneficiary of future financial support, especially since South Florida was benefiting from the historic 1920s land boom.[21] During this era of Jim Crow laws, there were three large state-funded universities in Florida for white male students, white female students, and black female students: the University of Florida in Gainesville and Florida State University and Florida A&M University, both in Tallahassee. Like most private universities of the time, the University of Miami was founded as a coeducational institution but not yet open to Black students.\n\nIn 1925, George E. Merrick, founder of Coral Gables, granted 160 acres (0.6 km2) and nearly $5,000,000[22] ($86.9 million, adjusted for current inflation) for the university's founding.[23] The contributions included land contracts and mortgages on real estate that had been sold in the city.[24] The university was formally chartered April 8, 1925[25] by the Circuit Court for Dade County.[26] But by 1926, as the first class of 372 students enrolled at the new university,[27] the land boom had collapsed and hopes for a speedy recovery were dashed by the Great Miami Hurricane of 1926.[28] For the next 15 years, the university struggled financially, bordering on insolvency. The first building on campus, now known as the Merrick Building, was left half built for over two decades due to the economic difficulties,[28] requiring that classes be held off-campus at the nearby Anastasia Hotel in Coral Gables. Partitions separated the classrooms, giving the university the early but long since discarded nickname Cardboard College.[28][29][30]\n\nIn 1929, University of Miami founding member William E. Walsh and other members of the university's board of regents resigned following the widespread collapse of Florida's economy. The university's plight was so severe that students went door to door in Coral Gables collecting funds to keep it open.[29] A reconstituted ten-member board chaired by the university's first president Bowman Foster Ashe included Merrick, David Fairchild, James Cash Penney, and others. In 1930, several faculty members and more than 60 students entered the University of Miami when the University of Havana closed amidst political unrest in Cuba.[28] While helpful to the University of Miami's early development, it still was not enough, and the university was forced to seek bankruptcy protection two years later, in 1932.[28][31]\n\nThe troubles, however, were short-lived. In July 1934, the University of Miami was reincorporated and a board of trustees was installed, replacing the board of regents. By 1940, community leaders were replacing faculty and administration as trustees.[26] During Ashe's presidency, the university grew considerably, adding the School of Law (1928),[32] the School of Business (1929, renamed the Miami Herbert Business School in 2019), the School of Education (1929), the Graduate School (1941), the Marine Laboratory (1943, renamed the Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science in 2022), the School of Engineering (1947), and the School of Medicine (1952).[28]\n\nDuring World War II, the University of Miami was one of only 131 colleges and universities nationally to participate in the V-12 Navy College Training Program, which offered students a path to commissioning as a U.S. Navy officer.[33]\n\nJay F. W. Pearson (1952 until 1962)\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Jay F. W. Pearson\n\nIn 1952, Jay F. W. Pearson, one of Ashe's long-time assistants, was appointed the University of Miami's second president.[34] A charter faculty member and marine biologist,[34] Pearson held the university's presidency for a decade, until 1962.[21] Under Pearson's leadership, the University of Miami began awarding its first Ph.D. degrees, and student enrollment increased substantially, exceeding 4,000.[21][35]\n\nFrom 1961 until 1968, the university leased buildings on its south campus to the Central Intelligence Agency that were used in JMWAVE, a covert operation and intelligence gathering operation against Fidel Castro's communist government in Cuba.[36] The university no longer owns land at the south campus.\n\nIn 1961, the university dropped its policy of racial segregation and began admitting Black students and allowing their full participation in student activities and athletic teams.[35][37][38] Five years later, in 1966, Ray Bellamy, a Black student at the University of Miami, became the first major Black college athlete in the Deep South to receive an athletic scholarship.[39]\n\nUntil the early 1970s, as was widespread practice at colleges and universities nationally, the university regulated female student conduct more strictly than that of male students, including employing a staff under the Dean of Women charged with watching over female students. Under Pearson, however, the university began incrementally liberalizing these policies. In 1971, he consolidated the separate Dean of Men and Dean of Women positions in one.[40] The same year, the university established a Women's Commission, which issued a 1974 report on the status of women on campus,[41] leading to the university's first female commencement speaker,[42] day care, and the launch of a Women's Study minor. Following enactment of Title IX in 1972 and over a decade of litigation, University of Miami organizations, including honorary societies, were opened to women's participation and inclusion. The Women's Commission also secured more equitable funding for women's sports.[43] In 1973, Terry Williams Munz became the first woman in the nation awarded an athletic scholarship when she accepted a University of Miami golf scholarship.[44]\n\nHenry King Stanford (1962 until 1981)\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Henry King Stanford\n\nHenry King Stanford, then president of Birmingham–Southern College, was appointed the University of Miami's third president in 1962.[45] Stanford led an increased emphasis on the university's research, reorganization of its administrative structure, and construction of new campus facilities. New research centers established under Stanford included the Center for Advanced International Studies (1964), the Institute of Molecular and Cellular Evolution (1964), the Center for Theoretical Studies (1965), and the Institute for the Study of Aging (1975). In 1965, the University of Miami also began actively recruiting international students.[28] Beginning with the 1968 football season, Stanford barred playing of \"Dixie\" by the university's band.[28]\n\nFurther information: Edward T. Foote II\n\nIn 1981, Edward T. Foote II, then dean of Washington University School of Law, was appointed the University of Miami's fourth president.[46] Under Foote's leadership, the university focused on attracting high-quality faculty and students, and consciously limited or reduced undergraduate admissions as part of its strategic plan. Foote also oversaw the conversion of on-campus student housing into residential colleges[47] and the university launch of its largest fundraising campaign to date, a five-year, $400 million campaign that began in 1984 and exceeded that goal, raising $517.5 million. Foote established three new schools: the School of Architecture, the School of Communication, and the School of International Studies.[48]\n\nDuring Foote's tenure, the university's endowment increased nearly ten-fold, growing from $47.4 million in 1981 to $465.2 million in 2000.\n\nDonna Shalala (2000 until 2015)\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Donna Shalala\n\nIn November 2000, Foote was succeeded by Donna Shalala, former chancellor of the University of Wisconsin–Madison from 1988 to 1993 and U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services from 1993 to 2001, who was appointed the University of Miami's fifth president.[50] Under Shalala, the University of Miami built new libraries, dormitories, symphony rehearsal halls, and classroom buildings. The university's academic quality continued improving, a trend that began in earnest under Foote.[51]\n\nRoughly a year into Shalala's presidency, on November 5, 2001, an 18-year-old University of Miami fraternity pledge drowned while attempting to swim across Lake Osceola, the campus lake, while intoxicated. Police reports later cited the student's dangerously high blood alcohol content in conjunction with dropping water temperatures and exhaustion as primary factors in his death, and two fraternity members who accompanied him were criminally charged with \"negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of duty to aid and/or rescue.\"[52][53] The university responded by making swimming in Lake Osceola, which was already prohibited, punishable by expulsion.\n\nIn 2002,[54] the University of Miami launched a new and even more ambitious multi-year fundraising campaign that ultimately raised $1.37 billion,[55] the most ever raised by any university or college in Florida history as of 2008.[56] From these proceeds, over half, $854 million, was allocated to construct and improve the University of Miami's Leonard M. School of Medicine medical campus.[55] In November 2007, the University of Miami acquired Cedars Medical Center in Miami's Health District, renaming it University of Miami Hospital and giving the Miller School of Medicine its first dedicated in-house teaching hospital rather than having to rely on academic affiliations with area hospitals.[57]\n\nIn 2003, Shalala controversially chose to close the University of Miami's North-South Center, a university research organization dedicated to the study of contemporary issues in Latin America and the Caribbean. The North-South Center was established by the U.S. Congress in 1984. It had secured a partnership with the Rand Corporation and was, as the Associated Press reported in 2003, \"a respected public policy think tank specializing in Latin American and Caribbean issues including trade and economic policy, migration, security, public corruption, and the environment.\"[58]\n\nOn September 30, 2004, the University of Miami hosted one of three nationally televised U.S. presidential debates between presidential candidates George W. Bush and John Kerry during the 2004 presidential election. The debate, moderated by Jim Lehrer of PBS NewsHour, was held on the University of Miami campus inside the Watsco Center. It drew 62.5 million viewers.[59]\n\nIn February 2006, University of Miami custodial workers, who were contracted to the university through a Boston-based company, alleged unfair labor practices, substandard pay, lack of health benefits, and workplace safety concerns. They launched a strike that drew support from several University of Miami students, who began a hunger strike and on-campus vigil in support of it. The strike settled May 1, 2006 when a card count union vote was permitted and led to establishment of the first collective bargaining unit in the university's history.[60][61][62] The university raised wages for its custodial workers from $6.40 to $8.35 per hour and provided health insurance.[63]\n\nIn 2008 and 2009, partly stemming from the Great Recession, the university endowment experienced a loss of 26.8% of its capital and additional associated losses from diminished endowment income. The university responded by tightening expenditures.[64][65] Damage from the endowment's negative performance was limited, however, because the university receives over 98 percent of its operating budget from non-endowment sources.[64] In 2011, the university was ranked the nation's most fiscally responsible nonprofit organization in a Charity Navigator report published in collaboration with Worth magazine.[66]\n\nJulio Frenk (2015 until 2024)\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Julio Frenk\n\nOn April 13, 2015, the University of Miami announced the appointment of Julio Frenk, former dean of Harvard University School of Public Health and former Secretary of Health for the government of Mexico, as the university's sixth president.[67] On March 10, 2016, the University of Miami hosted the 2016 Republican presidential primary's twelfth and final debate at BankUnited Center on the university campus, which aired nationally on CNN and drew 11.9 million viewers.[68]\n\nOn June 12, 2024, the University of California, Los Angeles announced that Frenk would be joining UCLA as the university's chancellor on January 1, 2025.[69] The same day, the University of Miami announced that the university's chief executive officer, Joe Echevarria, had been appointed acting president of the University of Miami \"effective immediately.\"[70] On June 19, 2023, the University of Miami student newspaper, The Miami Hurricane, labeled Frenk's departure \"shocking\", and criticized his leadership. \"Frenk was rarely a prominent influence on UM’s campus,\" the student newspaper reported.[71]\n\nUnder Frenk's nine years of leadership of the University of Miami, the university slipped notably on U.S. News & World Report's ranking of national universities, which ranked the university 48th in the nation upon his arrival in 2015[72] and 67th in the nation upon his departure in 2024.[73]\n\nCampus\n\n[edit]\n\nCoral Gables campus\n\n[edit]\n\nThe University of Miami's main campus spans 240 acres (0.97 km2)[74] in Coral Gables, 7 miles (11 km) southwest of Downtown Miami. Most of the university's academic programs are based on its main Coral Gables campus, which houses eight schools and two colleges, including the Frost School of Music, Herbert Business School, and the University of Miami School of Law. The campus has over 5,900,000 sq ft (550,000 m2) of building space valued in excess of $657 million.[75] Lake Osceola, a man-made freshwater lake developed in the late 1940s, is located at the center of campus.\n\nThe university's campus theater, Jerry Herman Ring Theatre, is named for University of Miami alumnus Jerry Herman, a composer and lyricist responsible for some of Broadway's most successful productions, including Hello Dolly!, La Cage aux Folles, and other Broadway hits.[76]\n\nThe John C. Gifford Arboretum, a campus arboretum and botanical garden, is located on the northwest corner of the main Coral Gables campus.[77] The Jorge M. Perez Architecture Center at the University of Miami's School of Architecture holds periodic architecture and design exhibitions.[78][79]\n\nTransportation to the Coral Gables campus is provided by Miami Metrorail, whose University Station stop is within walking distance of the campus.[80] The Metro connects the University of Miami to Downtown Miami, Brickell, Coconut Grove, Civic Center, Miami International Airport, and other Miami neighborhoods. The University of Miami's Coral Gables campus is about a 15-minute train ride from Downtown and Brickell.[81] The Hurry 'Canes shuttle bus service operates two routes on campus, including to University Station, and weekend routes to various off-campus stores and facilities during the academic year; an additional shuttle route provides service to the Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science campus on Virginia Key and Vizcaya Station. The university also has a Zipcar service.\n\nIn February 2018, rap artist Drake filmed substantial portions of the music video for his song \"God's Plan\" on the University of Miami campus.[82][83]\n\nStudent housing\n\n[edit]\n\nUM residence halls[84] Year built Room capacity Eaton Residential College 1954 400 Mahoney Residential College 1958 700 Pearson Residential College 1962 700 Hecht Residential College 1968 850 Stanford Residential College 1968 850 University Village 2006 800 Lakeside Village 2020 1,115 Total 5,415\n\nThe University of Miami's main campus in Coral Gables houses 5,415 enrolled students, 89 percent of whom are freshman.[85] The university's on-campus housing consists of five residential colleges and one apartment-style housing area available only to undergraduate degree-seeking students. The residential colleges are divided into two dormitory-style residence halls and three suite-style residence halls: The first, McDonald and Pentland Towers of Hecht Residential College[86] (demolished in 2022) and the Walsh and Rosborough Towers of Stanford Residential College,[87] (set to be demolished in 2024) are commonly referred to as the \"Freshman Towers\". The removal of these two dorms makes way for Centennial Village, which is set to open in 2024. The second, Eaton Residential College, which originally housed only women,[88] and Mahoney/Pearson Residential Colleges[89][90] have suite-style housing with double-occupancy rooms connected by a shared bathroom.\n\nIn addition to these five residential colleges, the university campus includes a student residential area called University Village,[91] which consists of seven buildings with apartment-style annual contract housing including fully furnished kitchen facilities. University Village is available only to juniors and seniors; until 2009, it had also been open to graduate and School of Law students.[92][93]\n\nThe University of Miami has seven fraternity houses on San Amaro Drive. Sororities are housed in on-campus suites, not residences.\n\nLakeside Village, a residential complex of 25 interconnected buildings, provides student housing for 1,115 sophomores, juniors, and seniors.[94]\n\nMedical school campus\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Miller School of Medicine\n\nThe University of Miami's Miller School of Medicine campus, located on Northwest 10th Avenue in Miami's Health District, has 1,523 full-time faculty and 819 students as of 2022.[96] The campus includes 70 acres (280,000 m2) within the University of Miami Jackson Memorial Medical Center's 153 acres (620,000 m2) complex.\n\nThe medical center includes three University of Miami-owned hospitals: University of Miami Hospital, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, and Anne Bates Leach Eye Hospital. Jackson Memorial Hospital, Holtz Children's Hospital, and Miami Veterans Affairs Medical Center are based on the medical center and maintain affiliations with the University of Miami but are not owned by the university.[97] The heart of the School of Medicine campus, the original City of Miami Hospital that opened in 1918, is known colloquially as \"The Alamo\", and has been named to the National Register of Historic Places.[96][98]\n\nIn 2006, the University of Miami opened a 300,000 sq ft (28,000 m2), 15-story Clinical Research Building and Wellness Center.[96] In 2007, the university purchased Cedars Medical Center and renamed it University of Miami Hospital. Situated in Miami's Health District, the hospital is close to Jackson Memorial Hospital, which is used by University of Miami medical students and faculty to provide patient care.[99]\n\nIn 2009, a LEED-certified nine-story biomedical research building, a 182,000 sq ft (16,900 m2) laboratory, and an office facility were opened to house the University of Miami's Interdisciplinary Stem Cell Institute and its John P. Hussman Institute for Human Genomics.[100] The University of Miami has completed a 2,000,000 sq ft (190,000 m2) Life Science Park adjacent to the university's medical campus that houses medical offices and laboratories.[101][102] The University of Miami's medical campus is connected to the university's main campus by the Metrorail with direct stations at University Station for the main Coral Gables campus and Civic Center Station for the medical campus.\n\nRosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science campus\n\n[edit]\n\nThe University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science maintains its 18 acres (73,000 m2) campus on the Biscayne Bay waterfront on Virginia Key. It is the only subtropical marine and atmospheric research institute in the continental United States. The school is home to the world's largest hurricane simulation tank.[103][104] The Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, a federal research laboratory, maintains its headquarters next to the Rosenstiel School campus on Rickenbacker Causeway and collaborates on various academic projects with the Rosenstiel School.\n\nThe school maintains the Barbados Atmospheric Chemistry Observatory (BACO), a research facility on the eastern end of Barbados in the Caribbean. The facility researches the summertime transport of dust particles from the Sahara in North Africa across the Atlantic Ocean to the Caribbean Basin and South America.[105]\n\nThe school's origins date back to 1945 when construction began on Rickenbacker Causeway to make Virginia Key accessible by car. During the Causeway's construction, Miami-Dade County offered the university a part of the island adjacent to Miami Seaquarium in exchange for it agreeing to assume operational management of the aquarium.[106] In 1951, however, the aquarium's construction was delayed following the failure of a bond referendum designed to fund it, and the university instead chose to begin leasing the land from the county. In 1953, the university built classroom and lab buildings on a 16-acre (6.5 ha) campus to house what would become the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science (RSMAS). Additional buildings were added in 1957, 1959, and 1965.[106]\n\nFrom 1947 to 1959, the State of Florida funded the University of Miami Marine Lab on Virginia Key until the state completed construction of its own marine laboratory in St. Petersburg.[106]\n\nSince 1951, the school has published the Bulletin of Marine Science, a peer-reviewed scientific journal on ecology, fisheries management, geology, geophysics, marine biology, oceanography, meteorology, and related topics.\n\nIn 2009, the University of Miami received a $15 million federal grant to help construct a 56,500 square feet (5,250 m2) Marine Technology and Life Sciences Seawater Research Building on the Rosenstiel School campus.[107]\n\nSouth and Richmond campuses\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Naval Air Station Richmond\n\nFurther information: JMWAVE\n\nIn 1946, following the U.S. military's deactivation of Richmond Naval Air Station in southwestern Miami, the University of Miami acquired the 12 mi (19 km) facility to accommodate its vast increase in post-World War II students. The property included classrooms, housing, and other amenities capable of accommodating approximately 1,100 students. Two years later, in 1948, the property was repurposed by the University of Miami as a research facility.[108] In the 1960s, the university opted to lease some of its buildings to the Central Intelligence Agency. Another section of the property, established in 1948, was called South Campus and included a 350 acres (1,400,000 m2) plot used for university-sponsored agricultural and horticultural research.[27][108] For 20 years, the University of Miami used radioactive isotopes in biological research on the South Campus and buried these radioactive materials, including animals eradicated in research, on the site. In August 2006, the University of Miami agreed to reimburse the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers $393,473 for clean up costs at the site made available under the 1980 Superfund law.[109] Six buildings on the site provide 63,800 sq ft (5,930 m2)[97] and currently house the Global Public Health Research Group, Miami Institute for Human Genomics, and Forensic Toxicology Laboratory.[110] The University of Miami once considered building a south campus on the property but instead opted in 2014 to sell the 80 acres of land.[111]\n\nThe Richmond campus is a 76 acres (310,000 m2) site that was formerly the United States Naval Observatory Secondary National Time Standard Facility, which already had buildings and a 20M antenna used for long interferometry.[112] The University of Miami's Rosenstiel School's Center for Southeastern Tropical Advanced Remote Sensing and Richmond Satellite Operations Center (RSOC) maintain their research facilities on part of this campus.\n\nLibraries\n\n[edit]\n\nThe University of Miami maintains one of the nation's largest university library systems, which currently hold in excess of four million volumes, over four million microforms, over 1.5 million electronic books, 153,648 active serials titles, 151,258 electronic journals, and 214,487 audio, film, video, and cartographic materials as of 2023.[85] The University of Miami's libraries have a staff of 71 librarians, 33 professional staff, and 76 support staff.[113][114]\n\nFour of the University of Miami's libraries are located on the Coral Gables campus: Otto G. Richter Library, the university's primary interdisciplinary library, the Architecture Research Center at the School of Architecture, the Judi Prokop Newman Information Resource Center at the Herbert Business School, and the Marta and Austin Weeks Library at Frost School of Music.\n\nThe Miller School of Medicine's main library, Louis Calder Memorial Library, is located on Northwest 10th Avenue on the medical campus in the Miami Health District. The medical school also maintains and manages two specialized medical libraries: The Mary and Edward Norton Library in ophthalmology focused on ophthalmology and the Pomerance Library focused on psychiatry. The Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science Library is based on the Rosentiel School's campus on Virginia Key.[115]\n\nOtto G. Richter Library, the largest of the university's libraries on the Coral Gables campus, houses art, architecture, humanities, social sciences, and science collections. The Richter Library also serves as a depository for federal and state government publications.[116] Rare books, maps, manuscript collections, and the University of Miami Archives are housed in the library's Special Collections Division. The Richter's Cuban Heritage Collection, which specializes in Cuba-related collections, maintains the world's largest Cuba-related holdings outside of Cuba.[117]\n\nIn January 2017, the Jay I. Kislak Foundation announced it was making a substantial donation of rare books, maps, and manuscripts to the university's libraries. In preparation for the extensive donation, the University of Miami renovated a former lecture hall, now called the Kislak Center at the University of Miami, to house the works and the university's existing special collections and archives. Among the vast holdings in the university's Kislak Center are Christopher Columbus' original published copies of his letter on the first voyage aboard the Niña, which Columbus authored on February 15, 1493.[118]\n\nAcademics\n\n[edit]\n\nThe University of Miami currently employs 2,850 full-time faculty members with 99 percent of them holding either doctorates or terminal degrees in their respective specialties.[4] The university's student-faculty ratio, as of 2018, was 12:1.[119]\n\nAccreditations\n\n[edit]\n\nThe University of Miami is a broadly accredited academic institution, including by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and the Florida Department of Education and 22 additional programmatic accrediting bodies, including Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, American Bar Association, American Dental Association Commission on Dental Accreditation, American Physical Therapy Association Commission on Accreditation in Physical Therapy Education, American Psychological Association, Association of MBAs (AMBA), Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (ACSB International), Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Management Education, Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education, Council on Education for Public Health, EQUIS, Liaison Committee on Medical Education, National Association of Schools of Music, and Society for Simulation in Healthcare.\n\nThe university is a member of American Association of Colleges and Universities, American Association of University Women, American Council of Learned Societies, American Council on Education, Florida Association of Colleges and Universities, Independent Colleges and Universities of Florida, and National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities.[120]\n\nIn September 2022, Miami Herbert Business School was awarded AMBA accreditation, securing triple crown accreditation status, which includes accreditation by each of the nation's three business-oriented academic accrediting bodies: ACSB International, AMBA, and EQUIS.
