Larranaga took George Mason from an NCAA Tournament 11 seed to the 2006 Final Four. He had 13 winning seasons with the Patriots overall, taking the team to five NCAA Tournaments. Twice Larranaga was voted Colonial Athletic Association Coach of the Year. Perhaps his greatest coaching achievement however has been making Miami relevant in the ACC. In his second season, the Canes went 29-7, won the ACC, and advanced to the Sweet Sixteen of the NCAA Tournament. The banner campaign earned Larranaga ACC Coach of the Year and AP College Basketball Coach of the Year honors. Prior to his more well known coaching stops, he served as the head coach at Bowling Green for 11 years. Larranaga gained a name in coaching as an assistant at Virginia during two Final Four runs. In his coaching career, he was also the head coach at Division II American International and an assistant at Davidson.
