        "text": "ASST. COACH JAMES JOHNSON: Of course thereâs a celebration â mid-major school, upset, everyoneâs happy. Gabe Norwood went into the locker room while the celebration was going on. Iâll never forget this: He walked to the grease board in the locker room and wrote on the board, âWelcome back Tony.â He could have thought about, âIs Tony going back in the starting lineup? Am I coming out?â That was far from his mind. That brings chills to me every time I talk about that.\n\nGeorge Mason advanced to play third-seeded North Carolina, the defending national champion.\n\nLARRANAGA: We had Scott Cherry on our staff, who had been on the national championship team at Carolina in â93.\n\nCHERRY: Everybody was asking questions that were kind of weird. They were just trying to be polite, but who am I going to cheer for? Who am I going to root for? Iâm rooting for the team I collect my paycheck from.\n\nLARRANAGA: He knew everything there was to know about what Carolina did. So on Saturday between games, we asked Scott to just explain to the guys exactly what they do.\n\nLEWIS: We had played UNC at UNC two years prior to that. That fear was already taken from us. We had played in their arena, with their 18,000 fans. We wasnât scared at all.\n\nUNC FRESHMAN FORWARD TYLER HANSBROUGH: To be honest with you, once we heard George Mason, we overlooked them. We thought we were going on to the next round.\n\nASST. COACH CHRIS CAPUTO: We thought Will (Thomas) and Jai were as good as any big players in the country. They just were not that big. They were only 6-6 or 6-7. But they both had very long arms and, I mean, ultra-skillful.\n\nATHLETIC DIRECTOR TOM O'CONNOR: On the way in, I found a penny that was heads up and a four-leaf clover.\n\nLEWIS: The first four minutes, we were down 16-2. I was a little nervous. I was like, âOh, no. Weâre about to get blown out on national TV. Everybodyâs predictions are about to come true, saying we shouldnât have even been in the tournament.â\n\nRADIO PLAY-BY-PLAY ANNOUNCER BILL ROHLAND: I thought, âOkay, we got our first-ever NCAA win. Letâs just not get embarrassed.â\n\nLARRANAGA: I called our team together. We stood up in front of the bench. I said, âLook, everybody listen to me. I want all eyes on me. Listen to what I have to say.â And I paused. I said, âWe got these guys right where we want âem.â The players looked at me like, âWe do?â I said, âYeah, look down at their bench.â And they looked down at their bench. I said, âSee? Theyâre celebrating. They think this game is already over. And we havenât even begun to play.â\n\nJOHNSON: You could hear the guys keep saying it to each other: âWeâre fine. Weâre going to be okay.â You could see it in their eyes.\n\nCHERRY: When we were down 16-2, Tony took a three at the top of the key and banked it in. We were like, âOh, maybe the luck is going to change.â\n\nLARRANAGA: The biggest thing going into the game, I had spoken to both of my sons. They warned me about not going to the scramble (press defense) too soon â donât go to the scramble in the first half. I said, âWhy?â They said, âThatâll give (Tar Heels Coach) Roy Williams halftime to make all the adjustments necessary to get them organized.â I thought it was a brilliant suggestion. We were down seven (at halftime). They had a freshman point guard running their team. I told the guys, âNow weâre going after him.â\n\nBUTLER: At the half, we noticed they didnât have strong ball-handlers. We called for traps just over half court. I think they turned the ball over maybe six times in a row. It was something crazy. Just careless passes, steals, getting tips.\n\nLARRANAGA: In their first four possessions, they had four straight turnovers, and the lead went from 27-20 in their favor to 28-27 our favor. At the first TV timeout, I asked the players to look down the bench. You could see their players arguing with each other.\n\nCAPUTO: Roy Williams is like throwing chairs, stuff like that. We could see they were rattled.\n\nBURNS: Probably the most memorable thing for me was Roy Williams kicking the chair. People were kind of nudging each other, like, âLook, look, look.â\n\nBUTLER: I know (UNC forward) David Noel. He used to come to Mason all the time outside of the season. We played against him my sophomore year. We were up two at the half. I saw him after that game. He was like, âBro, I told them before the game in the locker room they seemed too loose and confident.â He was like, âI told them. They didnât believe me.â\n\nSENIOR GUARD LAMAR BUTLER: Like you normally do after practice, one of the assistant coaches or the managers will come rebound for you. I was on the opposite end with (assistant) coach James Johnson. We were shooting. Coach L was very animated. I just heard him say, âOh, my God! This is unbelievable!â I pay it no mind. Iâm still shooting. There was a huddle of people around him. Heâs like, âLamar, you got to come see this!â\n\nI stop shooting, and I walk down to the other end, and I see it. Iâm just like, âOh, wow. Thatâs great.â I put it down on the chair and I went back to shooting. It didnât really hit me until a couple days later. It was like, âIâm really about to be on the cover of Sports Illustrated.â Thatâs something you can show your kids and grandkids. I actually have a big, wall-sized photo of the copy. My dad has one.\n\nLARRANAGA: When I saw it, I was blown away. I bought every copy at the 7-Eleven that I could get my hands on.\n\nNASSER: CBS called and said, âWe want to follow your team the rest of the time, as far as you guys go.â So I asked Coach, and he was like, âAbsolutely.â He didnât really set too many parameters. He wanted to capture what these guys were going through and how much fun they were having.\n\nMERTEN: We had a group that got together every morning in March. It was called the Leverage Group. We were asking ourselves the question, how can we get attention from this for our academic programs and for the university? We had everybody working on it, every step of the way.\n\nJOHNSON: Tickets was a big, big deal for our guys during that game. Our guys did an unbelievable job of staying focused. The five starters were all from that area. Just listening to the guys along the way when weâre in restaurants and on the bus, hearing guys talk about how their phones were ringing off the hook about tickets, people they havenât heard from in years seeing them on âSportsCenterâ and the newspaper and seeing if they could get to the games. That was funny.\n\nCOACH JIM LARRANAGA: Connecticut was the No.Â 1 seed, and they had five NBA players in their starting lineup. But I wanted to play them. I did not want to play Washington. The University of Connecticut was very similar to Michigan State and Carolina. They were very big. Big teams will very often play behind in the post. We had two of the best offensive post players in America in Jai Lewis and Will Thomas. So I knew we were going to be able to throw the ball into them.\n\nSENIOR FORWARD JAI LEWIS: I actually wasnât intimidated. Rudy Gay is from the Baltimore area. We played against each other coming up. Josh Boone, I actually played against him in AAU. I already know what I can and canât do against these guys. I felt as though they couldnât stop me.\n\nLARRANAGA: Will Thomas had played against Rudy Gay in high school and never lost to him. He made the statement to his teammates: I never lost to him in high school. Iâm not planning to lose to him in college.\n\nCONNECTICUT COACH JIM CALHOUN: Iâd be less than candid to say I feared George Mason a lot more than my players did. Thatâs only normal.\n\nLARRANAGA: Connecticut did not know anything about George Mason. When they were interviewed on Saturday, they were asked what league we play in. They said the Patriot League. Of course, weâre the George Mason Patriots. The guy who said it was corrected by his teammate, who said, âNo, theyâre not in the Patriot League. Theyâre in the Missouri Valley.â\n\nSENIOR GUARD LAMAR BUTLER: I remember they asked (U-Conn. swingman) Rashad Anderson on ESPN. Me and Folarin (Campbell) were watching it, and we started texting each other. âCan you name any of their players?â And this is after we beat Wichita at Verizon Center, so we should be on your scouting report. He said, âNo, I canât name any of their players.â That was it. That was all I needed. It gave us enough bulletin board material.\n\nJUNIOR GUARD GABE NORWOOD: Iâll never forget it, Coach L implemented this rule that weâre not allowed to wear headphones around campus or even leading into the gym. When we saw U-Conn. walking out, everybody had headphones on. Iâm sure they all got along and liked each other, but it gave a totally different impression.\n\nBUTLER: That game was a respect game. If you donât know us, youâre going to know us by the end of this game.\n\nLEWIS: I think their trash-talking helped us more than the pregame speech from Coach L.\n\nLARRANAGA: I went down at, I donât know, 6 or 6:30 in the morning. Iâm on the stationary bike and it had a TV. There was the interview. So I thought to myself, these guys really donât know anything about us. I needed to deliver that message to the team that weâre really an unknown quantity and these guys donât know how good we are, and weâre going to surprise them. I sat down and wrote âC-A-A.â What message can I deliver? The C, it was just natural â Connecticut. Now I need an A and an A. You know what? How about Connecticut Assassins Association. The guys will laugh hysterically at that.\n\nLEWIS: When he said that, everybody laughed at first, because Coach L is not really known for telling jokes. That was a good one for him.\n\nJUNIOR GUARD TIM BURNS: It was definitely corny and guys laughed at it, but at the same time, you know thatâs how he is and you respect the hell out of his game plan. It works for him. Iâm not sure other coaches could pull that off, but it worked.\n\nLARRANAGA: I said, âNow weâre going to go out there and shoot these guys down.â And they just were ready to storm out of the locker room.\n\nCAPUTO: The one thing Iâll say, we did have the crowd. It was as electric an environment as Iâve ever been in.\n\nRADIO PLAY-BY-PLAY ANNOUNCER BILL ROHLAND: To me the most amazing moment of that U-Conn game was during a timeout, the band starts playing âLivinâ on a Prayer,â and the whole arena starts singing.\n\nCBS ANALYST BILL RAFTERY: I think every fan sort of wishes all the games were in an atmosphere like that. (The tournamentâs) gotten so big, itâs more of a stage now, but that environment just lends to chaos, excitement, unrealistic plays. I donât know, thereâs something about urging your own team on that makes teams do great things.\n\nNORWOOD: I felt like I had the best seat in the house. I was sitting there courtside, just enjoying the show.\n\nCALHOUN: We were really good at guarding the post all year. That night, their guys outplayed our big guys. We got beat on our strength.\n\nGeorge Mason nearly pulled away, but Williams drilled a late jumper in the lane to cut Connecticutâs deficit to two. When Tony Skinn missed a free throw on the other end, Denham Brown forced overtime with a last-second layup.\n\nLARRANAGA: The four guys were back, but they were afraid to foul. So when Denham Brown pushed the ball, he drove it right to the basket. We actually got out of his way.\n\nCAPUTO: I felt like the walk back from where I was standing on the court to the chair was like the longest walk of my life. I felt like we got this close to doing this, and now we got to go to overtime. For half a second, I was personally deflated.\n\nLEWIS: I think when we went into overtime, the whole country counted us out then.\n\nFRESHMAN FORWARD SAMMY HERNANDEZ: I thought we were going to lose. I tell you the truth. I never thought we were going to pull it off.\n\nASST. COACH JAMES JOHNSON: When I tell this story, I get chills to this day. We usually meet as a coaching staff, and then we talk about what we want to do, or what the other team is doing. Then we go over, and Coach L delivers the message to the guys in the huddle. Well, we didnât meet. Coach L went right to the bench.\n\nLARRANAGA: I said to them, âGuys, you need to look me right in the eye right now and listen to what I have to say. We didnât play defense for five seconds. Now we got to play great defense for five minutes. But you know what? There isnât any place that Iâd rather be than right here with you guys, trying to beat Connecticut with a chance to go the Final Four. Where else would you rather be?â Then I asked them, âAre you having any fun yet? Go out and show the world what weâre made of.â\n\nBUTLER: We looked at each other like, letâs go win it.\n\nCALHOUN: I was happy for the overtime. It was one of those situations where youâre trying to extend the game and find some rhythm. We never did. They never allowed us to.\n\nCAPUTO: We kicked their butt in overtime.\n\nWhere are they now?:\n\nSammy Hernandez transferred to Florida Atlantic after his sophomore season and settled in his native Miami where he does, in his words, âa little bit of everything.â He runs his own youth basketball organization, coaches kids and and works at basketball camps for the Miami-Dade recreation department. He regularly attends Miami games in support of Jim Larranaga.\n\nPatrick Mazur spent three years as George Masonâs mascot, Gunston, culminating in the Final Four. He now lives in Philadelphia and works in sales for IBM. The Final Four run remains among his most memorable experiences: âI donât go a week without it coming up in some way in my life,â he said.\n\nFive members of the 2005-06 team played in the NBA, including four-time all-star Al Horford and two-time all-star Joakim Noah.\n\nTom OâConnor retired from George Mason in 2015 after spending 20 years at the school, becoming the Washington areaâs longest-tenured Division I athletic director. He soon began consulting for other programs, and agreed in December to serve as the interim athletic director at Manhattan College through this spring.\n\nTim Burns and his brother launched for-profit and nonprofit organizations offering basketball training in Manhattan, working with players from grade school through the pros. Their groups have formed a partnership with the District of Attorney of Manhattan, and have done NBA pre-draft training for the past four years.\n\nGabe Norwood began playing professionally in the Philippines after leaving Mason, becoming a six-time all-star and joining the Filipino national team for a handful of international competitions. He now spends 10 months of the year in the Philippines and plays for the Rain or Shine Elasto Painters. The Final Four run, he said, is âbrought up probably at least once a week, even out here in Manila.â Norwood traveled to the Super Bowl this year to support his brother, Broncos wide receiver Jordan Norwood.\n\nScott Cherry left George Mason a year after the Final Four run, becoming an assistant coach at Western Kentucky and then South Carolina before being named High Pointâs head coach in 2009. Cherry remains at the North Carolina school, having led the Panthers to their first Division I postseason appearance, their first Big South Conference regular season title, and their first NIT berth. They were the No. 1 seed in this seasonâs Big South tournament, which started Friday.\n\nJim Larranaga turned down overtures from power-conference schools, including alma mater Providence, for several years after George Masonâs Final Four run until he left for Miami following the 2011-12 season. Larranaga has resurrected a dormant program, winning 29 games in his second season and reaching No. 7 in the country this year. âJohn Feinstein told [wife] Liz and I at breakfast one morning that our life would never be the sameâ after the Final Four, Larranaga said. âI responded and said, âWeâre not going to change at all.â He said, âYou donât have to. Your circumstances will change dramatically.â \"\n\nAlan Merten retired as George Masonâs president in 2012 after 16 years, having transformed the school into Virginiaâs largest public university. He now serves on corporate boards and spends most of his time in Florida, although he maintains a residence in Arlington.\n\nJames Johnson moved to Virginia Tech as an assistant in 2007, became the head coach of the Hokies for two seasons and rejoined Jim Larranaga in Miami for this season as Miamiâs director of basketball operations.\n\nChris Caputo is in his fifth season as an assistant coach at Miami, his 14th year serving under Larranaga.\n\nJai Lewis had a brief dalliance with the NFL, signing with the New York Giants as an undrafted free agent and prospective offensive tackle. He played basketball overseas for eight years, mostly in Japan, France and Philippines. For the past two years, he has worked as a behavior interventionist at Halstead Academy in Baltimore. âI like dealing with kids,â Lewis said. âYou never know what theyâre going to say. They always make you laugh and smile.â\n\nLamar Butler played professionally for five seasons, making stops in the Czech Republic, Turkey and the NBA D-League. He now serves at as an assistant coach for St. Johnâs College High School in the District. âI talked to Tim [Burns] maybe two weeks ago,â Butler said. âI talk to Tony [Skinn] it seems like every week. I talk to Folarin [Campbell] and [John Vaughn]. Weâre Madden enemies. We get on the PlayStation, talk on the chat. I texted Jai [Lewis] maybe two weeks ago. Of course, Coach L. I saw him this past weekend. We all still communicate.â\n\nASST. COACH CHRIS CAPUTO: The first night we get in there, we take the team to St. Elmoâs, a great steakhouse in Indianapolis. We get this room in the basement, and (Billy) Packer and (Jim) Nantz are upstairs eating. It might have been Tom OâConnor or Coach who asked them to come down and talk to the team. It was funny. Jim Nantz couldnât have been nicer and hat-in-hand, sort of apologetic. And Packer, he wasnât going to apologize. He was cracking some jokes. The funny thing, the guys didnât want any part of it. They were looking at their plates. It was personal to them.\n\nLARRANAGA: CBS was there, and they were filming our dinner. My wife was sitting next to me. Sheâs very frugal. All the players were ordering lobster tails. She said to me, âWould it be too much to order a lobster tail?â And I said, âNo, youâre on full scholarship this weekend.â She said, âThank goodness. Iâve been a walk-on for 35 years.â\n\nMAZUR: Youâre going up against a UCLA Bruin, a Florida Alligator and an LSU Tiger. Everyone knows that. And then all of a sudden here comes a green thing, and no one knows what it is. People would say, âWhat are you?â And my mascot reaction was always to shrug my shoulders and hold my hands up in the air.\n\nJUNIOR GUARD GABE NORWOOD: To come out and see more people at our practice than we had all season at any of our regular season games was one of those moments where itâs like, âMan, this is really history.â\n\nSENIOR GUARD LAMAR BUTLER: Before the game, we even talked about it as a team: Whoever wins our game is going to win the national championship. We watched UCLA. We watched LSU. No disrespect, we just didnât think they were better than what we had played.\n\nASST. COACH JAMES JOHNSON: Â (Florida) had a lot of pros. They were very similar to us, but they were bigger, longer, more athletic at every position. They had two guys that score inside with (Joakim) Noah and (Al) Horford.\n\nCAPUTO: As we watched (film), we almost felt they were a better version of us in some ways. Just bigger.\n\nJOHNSON: As weâre going out to the court, the walk seemed like it was five minutes. Coach L looks up, and heâs like, âOh, boy. What time is kickoff?â\n\nO'CONNOR: When the game started and they came out for warmups, playing the fight song and everything, it gives you goosebumps to even think about it. Iâm getting goosebumps right now.\n\nBUTLER: We didnât have a rhythm at all, either side. It just felt weird. That was the first game I would say I just didnât feel comfortable we were going to win.\n\nLARRANAGA: We were only down five at the half. We had been down seven to North Carolina and nine to Connecticut. So it wasnât the halftime deficit. It was how good they were inside. We were trying to make some adjustments. But the adjustment was probably the worst thing we did. We helped off of their three-point shooter, (Lee) Humphrey. He was a lights-out three-point shooter, but he hadnât hurt us really in the first half. So we decided to help off of him a little bit more, and it was disaster. He made three straight threes to start the second half. The lead went from five to (12). We were never able to get it back under control.\n\nASST. COACH SCOTT CHERRY: Jai (Lewis) and Will (Thomas) just couldnât do what they did against U-Conn. to Corey Brewer and Al Horford and Joakim Noah. It was hard for our guys to score against two NBA all-stars. It was a different athleticism, a different length.\n\n[Michael Wilbon column: Florida's Donovan Casts a Spell of His Own]\n\nBUTLER: That game, I actually blacked it out until last year. I watched the film for the first time last year around this time. I called Coach L right after. He said, âYeah, we should have made some adjustments.â We talked about it. I just wanted to know what happened. It was a tough pill to swallow. It still is, actually. I just never got over it.\n\nLARRANAGA: He was exactly right. What we should have done is set more ball screens and take their bigger guys away from the basket. Instead of like we had in the previous games just pounded it inside, we needed to take their big guys away from the basket. Not challenge them, but make their guards play. And I didnât do that.\n\nThe Gators led throughout the second half and pulled away for a 73-58 win that put them in the national championship game and ended George Masonâs season.\n\nBURNS: We felt if we would have won that game, we would have won the national championship.\n\nNORWOOD: The seniors were basically breaking down. Lamarâs a pretty emotional guy, and you kind of expected that from Lamar. But to see Tony (Skinn) and Jai also in the same boat, who are a little more reserved, seeing that hurt.\n\nCHERRY: They were devastated. They really thought they had a chance to win a national championship.\n\nJOHNSON: The guys were on the bench, heads in their hands. We had guys crying. A lot people said, âYou guys made it, youâre a mid-major, you went to the Final Four.â Our guys felt like, that wasnât enough. We wanted to win. I just remember the hurt.\n\nLARRANAGA: After the Florida game, we were walking out of the locker room together, and I put my arm around Lamar, and I said, âYou know, Iâm mad at you.â And he looked at me, âYouâre mad at me?â I said, âYeah, remember back in October when (sports psychologist) Dr. Rotella was here?
