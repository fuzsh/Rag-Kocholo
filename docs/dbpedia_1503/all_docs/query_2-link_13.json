        "text": "Tuesday marked the official beginning of the 2024 New Mexico primary season for the legislature, with candidates officially filing for candidacy.\n\nThis is the first election with new maps for senate districts. Some state senators and representatives announced they would not be seeking reelection this year.\n\nThese included Albuquerque Senators Jerry Ortiz y Pino, Brenda McKenna, Bill Tallman and Mark Moores; Alamogordo Senate Republicans Ron Griggs and Bill Burt; Sen. Stephen Neville of Aztec, Gregg Schmedes of Tijeras and Cliff Pirtle of Roswell.\n\nIn the House, Reps. Jim Townsend, Candy Spence Ezell and Natalie Figueroa are seeking seats in the Senate while Rep. Bill Rehm of Albuquerque, Anthony Allison of Fruitland, and House Majority Leader Gail Chasey of Albuquerque, all announced their retirements.\n\nThere were also surprises.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Greg Baca did not file to run for reelection in Senate District 29. After redistricting, he would have had to face Joshua Sanchez, another incumbent Republican who currently represents Senate District 30. Sanchez is the lone Republican running in the district. Democrat Tina Garcia, the president of the Los Lunas Board of Education, also filed to run for the District 29 seat.\n\nAs for the newly-drawn Senate District 30, former State Sen. Clemente Sanchez will face Angel Charley in the Democratic primary, while no Republican filed to run.\n\nRepublicans on the House side also lost a leader before the primaries even started.\n\nT. Ryan Lane, R-Aztec, did not file to run for reelection in House District 3. Republican William Hall is the lone candidate seeking the seat.\n\nLike Republicans, Democrats will have a new floor leader, since Chasey announced her retirement during this year’s session.\n\nSeeking to replace her in House District 18 are four Democrats, Juan Larranaga, Anjali Taneja, Marianna Anaya and Gloria Sue Doherty. No Republicans filed in the deeply Republican district.\n\nThe two Republicans running for Moores’ seat, Senate District 21, are Nicole L. Tobiassen and John C Morton, both of Albuquerque. Two Democrats, Athena Ann Christodoulou and Philip Snedeker are also seeking the seat.\n\nCompeting for Pirtle’s seat are Ezell, and Chad A. Hamill, both Republicans.\n\nMarsella Duarte, who was originally chosen to fill the seat left vacant by Antonio “Moe” Maestas when he went to the Senate, is competing for the same seat against incumbent Rep. Yanira Gurrola, both are Democrats from Albuquerque.\n\nSandoval County Commissioner Jay C. Block and former state senator Candace Thompson Gould, both Republicans, and Democrat Philip Ramirez are seeking Senate District 12, a district that moved from Albuquerque’s downtown area to Rio Rancho during redistricting and was held by Ortiz y Pino.\n\nIn Senate District 9, four candidates look to replace McKenna. Democrats Heather Balas and Cindy Nava filed to run, as did Republicans Frida Susan Vasquez and former Secretary of State candidate Audrey Trujillo.\n\nSome candidates are challenging incumbents in the primary, including former Bernalillo County Commissioner Debbie O’Malley, a Democrat who was one of election denier Solomon Peña’s targets following the 2022 election. She is seeking to unseat Bill O’Neill in Senate District 13.\n\nEmbattled incumbent Democrat Daniel Ivey-Soto faces a Democratic challenger in Senate District 14. Heather Jean Berghmans hopes to defeat him in the primary, and the winner will face Republican Craig Degenhardt in the general election.\n\nOn the Republican side in the Senate, state Rep. Larry Scott will face incumbent Steven McCutcheon, who was appointed to replace Republican Gay Kernan, who retired last year, in Senate District 42.\n\nAdditionally, former Bernalillo County Sheriff Manuel “Manny” Gonzales, III is running for Senate District 23, which is currently held by Sen. Harold Pope, Jr., a Democrat who is seeking reelection. Gonzales will face Terry Lynne Aragon in the Republican primary.\n\nGonzales previously tried to run for U.S. Senate, but failed to file enough signatures on nominating petitions to make the ballot.\n\nBack in the House, incumbent Patty Lundstrom will face a primary challenger in the Democratic primary in Christopher Hudson. Lundstrom clashed with Democratic leadership, particularly after she was removed from her post as chair of the House Appropriations and Finance Committee in 2023. The winner of the primary will face Republican Arval Todd McCabe.\n\nThe full 2024 Primary Election Contest/Candidate List including county offices can be found on the New Mexico Secretary of State’s Website.\n\nTo check your voter registration or to make changes visit the Voter Information Portal or contact your county clerk. A list of county clerks and their contact information can be found here.\n\nLegislative candidates for the June 4 Primary are:\n\nSenate District 1\n\nBill Sharer (Incumbent, Republican)\n\nSenate District 2\n\nSongtree L.
