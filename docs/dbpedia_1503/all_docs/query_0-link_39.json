        "text": "Where will all the skill and talent come from needed for our future ? I once, years ago had a simple idea. Create partnerships with community colleges that are geographically aligned with your manufacturing sites. Let the colleges deliver the curriculum and we would deliver the on the job training at those sites. Not an apprentice program but a modern day associate’s degree in manufacturing technology. Training students and providing repetition on the small low tolerance parts that hold you up everyday. The nuts, washers, bolts, clamps and brackets. At the time ge was in a free fall and couldn’t get out of its own way. Now we are nimble, organized and Leaner. A new and different ge. Our future is bright. Maybe it’s time to think about this type of training approach. Start out small, increase or decrease the program as needed. Community Colleges are ready and willing for the asking. It’s time !\n\nThe top 25 defense companies by 2022 revenues are ranked based on their income from defense-related activities. Lockheed Martin tops the list with $633 billion, with 96% of its total revenue attributed to defense. U.S. companies dominate the ranking, with 12 representatives, and China follows with four. Notable U.S. companies include Lockheed Martin, known for advanced fighter jets and collaboration with NASA on the Orion spacecraft, and RTX (formerly Raytheon Technologies), which produces various military equipment. In China, Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) is a prominent aerospace and defense company, and China North Industries Group (CNIG) deals with international defense business. European companies Airbus and Rolls-Royce also make the list, involved in the defense industry alongside their primary activities.\n\nElectra.aero is honored to be selected by the US Navy to explore the use of our #eSTOL aircraft as a next-generaton aviation solution for logistics in a contested environment. We'll work with Navy stakeholders to define specific contested logistics use cases and conduct a conceptual design study to evaluate how our hybrid-electric eSTOL aircraft can address unique Navy capability gaps. \"With our differentiated combination of hybrid-electric propulsion and a blown fixed wing, we can offer Pacific theater-relevant payloads and ranges, and the ability to operate from rough soccer field-sized spaces as well as many naval vessels and adjacent assets, all from day one. We also see this airplane as an enabler for expeditionary power generation, mesh networking, and even as an essential node for Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2) employment. These are all gamechangers for force modernization initiatives within the Navy and Marine Corps,” explains Ben Marchionna, Electra’s Director of Technology and Innovation.
