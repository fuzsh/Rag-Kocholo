        "meta_description": "This week on New Mexico in Focus, producer and correspondent Floyd Vasquez\nexamines a legal claim made by the State of New Mexico that could go all the\nway to the U.S. Supreme Court. It involves the Uniformed Service Employment\nand Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA), the law that protects service members'\nreemployment rights when returning from a period of service in the uniformed\nservices, including those called up from the reserves or National Guard. It\nprohibits employer discrimination based on military service or obligation.\nFollowing a 3 week trial earlier this year, a New Mexico jury found that the\nChildren, Youth & Families Department violated the rights of an Iraq war\nVeteran. CYFD did not appeal the jury’s verdict but argued successfully\nbefore the New Mexico Court of Appeals that the State of New Mexico is not\nsubject to USERRA based on sovereign immunity. The case is now before the\nNew Mexico Supreme Court and is being watched closely by stakeholders\nnationwide. And in this Veterans Day week, producer Megan Kamerick sits down\nwith Santa Fe artist and Vietnam veteran Michael Naranjo. Mr. Naranjo was\nrecently honored in connection with the new “American Veterans Disabled for\nLife Memorial” in Washington D.C. NMiF host Gene Grant and The Line opinion\npanel look at the shift in the New Mexico House of Representatives to\nRepublican control for the first time in 62 years, and the new leadership,\nincluding Rep. Don Tripp, R-Socorro, who will be speaker of the House, and\nNate Gentry, R-Albuquerque, who will be majority leader. Change is also\ncoming to the Republican Party of New Mexico, with Chairman John Billingsley\nannouncing he will not seek re-election. He has been publicly critical of\nGov. Susana Martinez’s political advisor, Jay McCleskey, and has expressed\nconcern about funding trends in campaigns. The Line also looks at the\noutlook for the New Mexico Spaceport following the crash of Virgin\nGalactic’s SpaceShipTwo in the Mojave Desert recently. Experts say the\nuncertainty about when the company may actually launch tourists into\nsub-orbit has exposed the Spaceport’s vulnerability in putting all its eggs\nin the Richard Branson basket. Critics say the Spaceport should have\ndiversified its infrastructure and business by attracting more tenants, and\nthus capitalize on the growth of the commercial space industry that is\ntaking place elsewhere. And the Line discusses a proposed ordinance in San\nMiguel County that would impose some of the strictest requirements in the\ncountry on oil and gas drilling. This comes as a federal judge considers the\nfuture of an ordinance that bans oil and natural gas drilling in neighboring\nMora County. He ruled some parts of the ban are unconstitutional. Host: Gene\nGrant. Correspondents: Megan Kamerick; Floyd Vasquez. Guests: Gary Kaiser,\nEmployer Support of The Guard and Reserve; Michael Naranjo, Artist and\nVietnam veteran; Dave Pederson, General Counsel, Office of the New Mexico\nAttorney General; Sgt. First Class Phillip Ramirez, Afghanistan and Iraq\nveteran. Line Guest Panelists: Tom Garrity, The Garrity Group; Sophie\nMartin, Editor, DukeCityFix.com & Attorney; Rob Nikolewski, New Mexico\nWatchdog and Inez Russell Gomez, Santa Fe New Mexican.",
