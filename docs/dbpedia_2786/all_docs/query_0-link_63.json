        "text": "see also: random notes\n\nsee also: notes on the middle ages (find it via the search to your your left......)\n\nPeople's Crusade- 6 month prelude to the first crusade. It lost, decisively, to the Turks.\n\nFirst Crusade- 1096-1099. Decisive Crusader victory.\n\nGodfrey of Bouillon- Lord of Bouillon. One of the leaders of the first crusade. After the crusaders took Jerusalem, he became it's ruler.\n\nCrusade of 1101- Decisive Turkish victory.\n\nNorwegian Crusade- Success, IMO. Norwegian crusaders sack Lisbon and do a bit of that in the Balearic Islans as well. Then they move in and help the Crusaders take Sidon, Syria.\n\nVenetian Crusade- Venetians win a naval battle of Jaffa and take the city of Tyre (in Syria?). On the return voyage the Venetian fleet pass by the byzantine Aegaean Islands (and plunder them?)\n\n2nd crusade- Saladin won the second crusade (taking everything but Antioch, and the county of Tripoli). Lost the third crusade against Richard the Lion Heart.\n\nThird Crusade- Decisive victory by Richard the Lion Heart (who also took Cyprus from the byzantines.....), he was unable to retake Jerusalem, however.\n\nCrusade of 1197- Often said to be a crusader victory, but I am not entirely sure....\n\n4th Crusade- Crusader sack of Consantintople. The byzantines were ruled by the Angelid dynasty.\n\n5th crusade- Was a decisive Ayyubid victory. 8 year truce between Ayyubids and Crusaders.\n\n6th Crusade- Diplomatic Crusader victory. Jerusalem, Nazareth, Sidon, Jaffa and Bethlehem relinquished to Crusaders.\n\nThere is also the \"Baron's Crusade\", which kinda overlaps (or is a different way of classifying) what was going on in the 6th crusade.\n\n7th Crusade- French against the Egyptians. Decisive Saracen victory. French King Louis was captured by the Egyptians.\n\n8th Crusade- French attempt to take Tunis, fail, but are able to negotiate (more or less) a stalemate.\n\n9th Crusade- Stalemate. Still a sign that the crusades are going downhill; the crusaders have to withdraw despite alliance with the Ilkhanate.\n\nCrusaders fight well against Baibers during the year long period of this crusade; but before, and after this crusade, Baibers tends to win against the crusaders, taking Antioch and the Krek de Chevalier (the Krek de Chevalier having surrendered in 1271).\n\nAFTERMATH:\n\n1291- Egyptian Mameluks take Acre castle.\n\nPEOPLE: Baibers, noted Egyptian who won the Battle of Ai-Jin-Lut against the Mongols.\n\nRashid ad-Din Sinan- resistance leader nicknamed \"wise man of the mountain\"\n\nBalian of Ibelin (1143-1193)- Crusader noble from the Kingdom of Jerusalem\n\nBohemond I of Antioch- Prince of Taranto (Sicily) and then Antioch after it was captured by the crusaders.\n\nBATTLES: Battle of Hattin (1187, Ayyubid victory): Saladin was one of the commanders in this battle. Estimated figures are 20k for the Crusaders and 30k for the Ayyubids.\n\nBattle of Adrianople (1205,) Bulgarians and Cuman forces beat the crusaders of the Latin Empire (the Crusader state that set up after the sack of Constantinople in 1204). Bulgarians take Baldwin prisoner.\n\nBattle of La Forbie (1244, Crusaders defeated by the Ayyubids)- Refugees and mercs from the Khwarezm Shah (after the Khwarezmanians were defeated by the Mongols) help the Ayyubids beat the Crusaders.\n\nOTHER BATTLES:\n\nBattle on the Ice- Battle between the Teutonic order and the republic of Novgorod in Europe.\n\nOTHER EVENTS: Pogrom of 1096 (in western Europe)\n\nPLACES: Isle of Ruad/Arwad off the coast of Syria and Tartus/Tortosa and the only inhabited Syrian Island.\n\nSCHOLARS:\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nUsamah ibn Munqidh- Poet, courtier, and diplomat, unclear extraction. Lived and wrote during the crusades; often about them.\n\nIbn Jubayr- Geographer, traveler, and poet during the crusades; and wrote about them.\n\nMardi ibn Ali al-Tarsusi- Ayyubid expert of military matters; I think he once referred to the Chinese \"crouching tiger\" trebuchets as Turkish trebuchets.\n\n-------------------------\n\nTERMS: Outremer-"
