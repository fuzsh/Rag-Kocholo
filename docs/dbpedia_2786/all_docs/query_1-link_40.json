The result of the Battle of Hattin, Saladin had decisively crushed the Frankish forces and captured any remaining franks that could not flee. Saladin had also notably captured Guy of Lusignan who was the current Ruler of Jerusalem, Raynald of Chatillon, Guys brother, and other high nobles of Jerusalem. This was a decisive victory because the main force protecting Hattin\n\nthe crusades. The topics that will be addressed are the Battle of Hattin in 1187 and the Ayyubid Dynasty. During the battle of Hattin, Saladin captured the king of Jerusalem and killed him after defeating the crusader army. This investigation will focus on the time period of 1137 to 1193 and the places investigated will include Egypt, Syria and North Africa. This will be accomplished through a thorough examination of Saladin’s leadership, battle tactics, and people skills. Part B:\n\nMuslims of the Third Crusade: Saint or Saladin? The Third Crusade, occurring in the 12th century, was the epic battle between the forces of Europe and the rising Muslims in pursuit of the territory of Jerusalem. Saladin, the leader of the Muslims and the sultan in Egypt and Syria said “I warn you against shedding blood, indulging in it and making a habit of it, for blood never sleeps,” (Saladin). Saladin, leading the defense against the Christians, used this mindset while he triumphed in defending\n\nSaladin and Richard The Lionheart. Why is Saladin and Richard the Lionheart Still remembered after thousands of years? Saladin and Richard the Lionheart have fought in many ferocious and important battles. Winning those battles needed quick thinking and cunning battle strategies. Both leaders were well respected by their men, the trust they had in them led to many great victories. But why are they still remembered? Many have asked the same question, but it's down to one clear factor. When every\n\n“One of their most famous victories was in 1177 during the Battle of Montgisard, where some 500 Templar knights helped several thousand infantry to defeat Saladin's army of more than 26,000 soldiers” (McDonald “Templars At War 2”). The Templars' existence was tied closely to the Crusades, particularly when the Holy\n\ncrusading years especially from 1173-1193. He had a huge influence over the history of the Middle East, from his rise to power under Nur-ed Din to becoming one of the most influential figures in crusading history. In 1187 when his victory at the Battle of Hattin showed how far he had unified the Islamic response to the crusaders and this is why when he captured Jerusalem the Franks’ efforts during the Third Crusade were futile due to Saladin’s power.

The church played a significant role during the middle ages. In fact, the church reached the height of its power in the high middle ages: the 11th, 12th, 13th centuries. It was during this period that the crusade battles occurred. The movie tries to portray the events that led to one of the battles, the Battle of Hattin 1187.

There was also the ceaseless pressure of to reclaim Jerusalem for the Christians, especially after their recent loss of the city and terrible loss at Hattin.\n\nby Saladin’s army, and the collapse of the Kingdom of Jerusalem itself. When Saladin’s army approached the city of Jerusalem the defenders of the city was starchily out numbered. The cause of this was the fact that in a previous battle now known as the battle of Hattin the Jerusalem force of 16200 men were completely decimated by Saladin’s force of 42000 men. The reason for this great defeat at the hands of Saladin’s army was poor leadership. The new king of Jerusalem Guy was bent on attacking Saladin’s\n\nThese past few weeks, everyone in the tenth grade has been learning about the crusades. The people, weapons, food, diseases, and technological advances (or disadvantages since it was the Dark Age) were all taught to us and now it is time to put it to the test. We learned that the crusades affected all three religions that have ties to Jerusalem, Christianity, Judaism, and Islam.
