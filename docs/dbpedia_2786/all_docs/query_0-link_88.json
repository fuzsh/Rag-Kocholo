        "text": "Assessing the Size of Opposing Armies\n\nAccording to the Itinerarium Regis Ricardi, it suggests that the Ayyubid army had a numerical advantage over the Crusaders, estimated at a three-to-one ratio. However, these figures seem greatly exaggerated, with reported numbers of 300,000 and 100,000 respectively, which are considered unrealistic. Modern evaluations of Saladin’s forces put them at approximately 25,000 soldiers, primarily consisting of cavalry, including horse archers, light cavalry, and a smaller contingent of heavy cavalry.\n\nTaking into account the combined forces of the three kings who journeyed to the Holy Land and the troops available to the Kingdom of Jerusalem, McLynn calculates that the total Crusader strength at Arsuf amounted to 20,000 individuals. This comprised 9,000 troops led by Richard from his territories, 7,000 French soldiers under Phillip’s command, 2,000 troops from Outremer, and an additional 2,000 soldiers from various sources, such as Danes, Frisians, Genoese, Pisans, and Turcopoles. It’s important to note that this calculation does not consider losses in previous battles or desertions, making it likely that the Crusader army numbered around 10,000 or possibly more men.\n\nThe Cambridge Illustrated Atlas of Warfare describes Richard’s army as having 10,000 infantry, including spearmen and crossbowmen, along with 1,200 heavy cavalry. Saladin’s army is believed to have been twice the size of Richard’s, with a predominant focus on cavalry.\n\nDeployment and Preparations\n\nOn the morning of September 7th, as Richard’s troops began to depart from their camp, enemy scouts were visible in all directions, suggesting that Saladin’s entire army might be concealed within the forest. King Richard paid particular attention to arranging his army. He assigned the most perilous positions, particularly the front and rear of the column, to the military orders. These groups possessed extensive experience in Eastern warfare, displayed remarkable discipline, and were the only units that included Turcopole cavalry, who fought similarly to the Turkish horse archers of the Ayyubid army.\n\nThe leading contingent of the Crusader army was comprised of the Knights Templar, led by Robert de Sablé. They were followed by three divisions consisting of Richard’s own subjects, including the Angevins and Bretons, then the Poitevins, which included Guy of Lusignan, the nominal King of Jerusalem, and finally, the English and Normans, responsible for the grand standard mounted on its wagon. The subsequent seven formations consisted of the French, Flemings, Outremer barons, and small groups of crusaders from various regions. The rearguard was composed of the Knights Hospitaller, commanded by Garnier de Nablus. These twelve formations were organized into five larger groups, although the exact arrangement remains unknown. Additionally, a small unit, led by Henry II of Champagne, was assigned to scout the nearby hills. A squadron of elite knights, under the leadership of King Richard and Hugh of Burgundy, who led the French contingent, was tasked with patrolling the column, monitoring Saladin’s movements, and ensuring the Crusader ranks remained orderly.\n\nFirst Saracen Assault\n\nThe first Saracen assault occurred after all the Crusaders had vacated their camp and were en route to Arsuf. The Ayyubid army then emerged from the forest. The forefront of their force consisted of numerous skirmishers, including both mounted and foot soldiers, Bedouins, Sudanese archers, and the lighter Turkish horse archers. Behind them were well-ordered squadrons of heavily armored cavalry, such as Saladin’s mamluks, Kurdish troops, and contingents from the emirs and princes of Egypt, Syria, and Mesopotamia. Saladin directed his army from beneath his banners, surrounded by his bodyguards and accompanied by his kettle drummers.\n\nIn an effort to disrupt the unity of the Crusader army and undermine their determination, the Ayyubid assault included the clash of cymbals and gongs, trumpets blaring, and warriors shouting battle cries.\n\nThe repetitive Ayyubid harassment followed a consistent pattern: Bedouins and Nubians on foot launched arrows and javelins into the enemy ranks, then cleared the way for mounted archers to advance, strike, and withdraw, executing a well-practiced maneuver. Crusader crossbowmen responded when possible, but the primary objective for the Crusaders was to maintain their formations in the face of relentless provocation. When the continuous skirmisher attacks failed to achieve the desired impact, the focus of the assault shifted to the rear of the Crusader column, with the Hospitallers experiencing the most intense pressure. On this front, the right wing of the Ayyubid army launched a desperate assault against the squadron of Hospitaller knights and the accompanying infantry units. The Hospitallers faced attacks from both their rear and flank, forcing many of their infantrymen to march backward to keep their shields and faces toward the enemy. Saladin, eager to inspire his soldiers for closer combat, personally entered the battle, accompanied by two attendants leading spare horses. Sayf al-Din, Saladin’s brother, also actively encouraged the troops, with both brothers thus exposing themselves to significant crossbow fire.\n\nHospitallers’ Charge\n\nThe Hospitallers disrupted their formation and launched an attack. Despite Saladin’s best efforts, he couldn’t break the Crusader formation or stop their advance towards Arsuf. Richard was resolute in keeping his army intact, making the enemy wear themselves out with repeated charges. His plan was to save his knights from a powerful counter-attack at the perfect moment. However, this strategy carried risks because the army faced intense enemy provocation, scorching heat, and thirst. Additionally, the Saracens were killing so many horses that some of Richard’s knights doubted the feasibility of a counter-strike. Many knights without horses joined the infantry.\n\nAs the vanguard entered Arsuf in the afternoon, the Hospitaller crossbowmen at the rear struggled to maintain their formation. They eventually lost cohesion, and the enemy seized the opportunity, attacking through the gaps with swords and maces. The Battle of Arsuf was now at a critical juncture for the Crusaders. Garnier de Nablus repeatedly requested permission from Richard to attack, but he was denied. Instead, he was ordered to hold his position and await the signal for a general assault, which would be six trumpet blasts. Richard understood that the charge of his knights had to be timed when the Ayyubid army was fully engaged and the Saracen horses were tired.\n\nHowever, whether due to a lack of discipline or acting on Richard’s delegated authority, the Order’s marshal and one of Richard’s household knights, Baldwin le Carron, moved through their infantry and charged into the Saracen ranks, shouting “St. George!” They were soon followed by the rest of the Hospitaller knights. Encouraged by this action, the French knights preceding the Hospitallers also charged.\n\nThe commonly accepted version of events suggests that Garnier de Nablus and the Hospitaller cavalry charged out of desperation and directly disobeyed Richard’s orders. However, this account has been questioned. The established viewpoint relies on two related sources that do not align with some other accounts, including Richard’s own letters about the battle. Recently, it has been suggested that Richard may have delegated the authority to trusted subordinates to identify and seize the right moment to order a charge. Furthermore, it’s unclear how a trumpet signal would have been heard amidst the clashing cymbals and gongs of the Ayyubid army or distinguished from Saladin’s regular trumpet blasts.\n\nCrusader Counterattack\n\nShould the conduct of the Hospitallers be deemed a breach of discipline, it possessed the potential to unravel the entire strategic fabric meticulously woven by Richard. Alternatively, one might conjecture that Baldwin le Carron, in a stroke of audacious autonomy, was granted a license to seize a fleeting opportunity. In either scenario, Richard astutely discerned that once the counterattack commenced, it demanded the unwavering support of his entire host. Consequently, he issued the command for a general charge to be trumpeted forth. It became evident that without reinforcement, the Hospitallers and their compatriots, who had initiated the daring breakout, would find themselves overwhelmed by the overwhelming numerical superiority of their adversary.\n\nThe Frankish infantry, with deliberate forethought, cleaved openings within their formations to usher the gallant knights through, allowing the assault to naturally evolve from the rear to the vanguard. In the eyes of Saladin’s soldiery, as astutely observed by Baha al-Din, the abrupt transition from passivity to ferocious activity on the part of the Crusaders appeared to be a well-conceived stratagem.\n\nHaving been previously embroiled in close-quarter combat with the rearmost echelons of the Crusader procession, the right flank of the Ayyubid forces remained ensconced in compact formation, situated perilously close to their foe, rendering evasion of the full brunt of the impending charge nigh impossible. Indeed, some cavalrymen of this wing had dismounted to more effectively unleash their volleys of arrows. Consequently, the Ayyubids suffered grievous casualties, retribution served cold and brutal for the tribulations endured earlier in the conflict. Baldwin le Carron and the marshal of the Hospitallers, it seemed, had chosen their moment with uncanny precision.\n\nThe Rout\n\nIn the words of Baha al-Din, “the rout was complete.” Positioned initially within the center division of Saladin’s army, when it turned in headlong flight, his gaze sought to align with the left wing, only to discover it too was swept up in rapid retreat. Observing the disintegration of the right flank, he ultimately sought out the banner of Saladin himself, yet encountered but a mere seventeen members of the Sultan’s dwindled bodyguard and a solitary drummer as the remnants of their retinue.\n\nEver cognizant that overzealous pursuit posed the gravest peril when contending with adversaries schooled in the fluid tactics of the Turks, Richard prudently called a halt to the charge after traversing approximately 1.5 kilometers (1 mile). The Crusader units comprising the right flank, notably the English and Normans, had hitherto been spared heavy entanglement in hand-to-hand strife. They now stood as a readily available reserve, upon which the remaining ranks could coalesce. Liberated from the pressures of relentless pursuit, many among the Ayyubid ranks turned their attentions to hewing down those knights who had recklessly surged ahead of their compatriots. James d’Avesnes, commander of one of the Franco-Flemish contingents, emerged as the most conspicuous victim in this harrowing episode. Among the Ayyubid leaders who promptly regrouped and returned to the fray was Taqi al-Din, the nephew of Saladin himself. With 700 stalwart warriors from the Sultan’s own bodyguard at his beck and call, he bore down upon Richard’s left flank. As their squadrons regained their order, Richard, at the helm of his knights, initiated a second charge, whereupon the forces of Saladin buckled once more.\n\nAware of the perilous threat looming over his disarrayed troops, Richard, ever the judicious commander, promptly ordered a halt and orchestrated the reformation of his forces following yet another relentless pursuit. The Ayyubid cavalry, displaying remarkable resilience, wheeled about once more, demonstrating an unwavering determination to rekindle the fray. Nevertheless, a decisive third and ultimate onslaught compelled them to disperse into the dense forest, dispersing in myriad directions over the rolling hills, their will to engage further waning to naught. With an indomitable resolve, Richard steered his cavalry back towards the encampment at Arsuf, where the infantry had established their bivouac. Under the shroud of night, the lifeless bodies of the Saracen warriors became the subject of plunder and pillage."
