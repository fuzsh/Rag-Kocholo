We will not forgive... We will not rest until the justice has been established, By the will of Allah... Jerusalem will be the capital of Muslim empire... By the will of Allah... #freepalestine\n\nYemen is under attack US and British airstrikes killed at least 16 civilians in Yemen and injured 35 others, according to local media. The airstrikes come a day after Ansarallah shot down a US drone over Yemen's Marib province using a surface-to-air missile. Earlier, Yemen's Ansarallah intensified its military operation against Israel and its allies in response to Israel's horrifying massacre in Rafah less than a week ago. Ansarallah media said it targeted 10 ships affiliated with the US, UK, and Israel in the Red, Arabian, and Mediterranean seas, as well as the Indian Ocean. Yemen's leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi stated that the \"number of ships targeted since the beginning of the support operations for Gaza reached 129.\" At the turn of the year, the US and UK began attacking Yemen after Ansarallah launched a naval blockade against Israel's access to the Red Sea. They continue to demand an end to the extermination war against Gaza. #YemenWar #Yemen Palestine #YemenAirstrike\n\nGraphic Content: After 20 days buried under the rubble, Palestinians have excavated the bodies of children killed by an Israeli airstrike during the invasion of the Jabalia refuge camp in northern Gaza. During this invasion, an Israeli tank targeted and killed paramedics and civil defense teams who were attempting to recover the bodies and assist wounded Palestinians, leaving them to die بعد 20 يوما من دفنهم تحت الأنقاض، انتشل الفلسطينيون جثث الأطفال الذين قتلوا في غارة جوية إسرائيلية خلال اجتياح مخيم جباليا للاجئين في شمال قطاع غزة. وخلال هذا الاجتياح، استهدفت دبابة إسرائيلية وقتلت المسعفين وطواقم الدفاع المدني الذين كانوا يحاولون انتشال الجثث ومساعدة الجرحى الفلسطينيين، وتركتهم يموتون Via @fadi_alwhidi\n\nThe only solution: \"Palestine becomes the capital of the Muslim Empire\". This is the promise of Rasool Sallallahu Alaihi wa Sallam. It will happen, by the will of Allah. With you or without you. Be steadfast... Be Patient... #freepalestine"
