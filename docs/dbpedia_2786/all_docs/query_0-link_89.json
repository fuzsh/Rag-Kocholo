I especially thank Marika Lysandrou at Yale University Press for her advice and assistance and Heather McCallum for her guidance and encouragement, as well as Kelly DeVries, who introduced me to her in the first place. He and John France have been extremely helpful and receptive mentors in too many ways to count. I am also grateful to my former professors at the University of Delaware, Daniel Callahan and Lawrence Duggan, for my early grounding in Crusades studies, as well as for their continuing support, suggestions, and ideas. For their assistance in answering questions or acting as sounding boards at conferences and through correspondence, I thank David Bachrach, Dana Cushing, Ilana Krug, Kenneth Madison, Alexander Pavuk, L.J. Andrew Villalon, Nicholas Paul, Joanna Phillips, Andrew Holt, and especially Daniel Franke, as well as the general membership of De Re Militari. I am indebted to my colleagues in Israel: Allon Klebanoff, the faculty and staff at the Zinman Institute of Archaeology at the University of Haifa, and Abdu Matta, my tour guide in Akko. For x\n\nAC K N OW L E D G M E N T S\n\nconsistently locating my research materials, I thank the staffs at the Earl S. Richardson Library at Morgan State University, the Eisenhower Library at Johns Hopkins University, and the Library of Congress. My sister, Gina Lamb, applied her professional editing skills to the final draft. As always, I thank my wife, Holly, for her sacrifice of many hours to facilitate my writing, as well as my three young children, Gianna Marie, Michael Plantagenet, and Rocco Alexander, who freed up more hours for composition by going to bed on time and sleeping in late. This book is dedicated to Edward “Skip” Cox, my good friend and seminar mate at Iowa State University, who died too young from complications from cancer in 2015. His memorial was held on the exact day I traveled to Akko to research this book.\n\nxi\n\nABBREVIATIONS\n\nAnonymous1\n\nAnonymous2\n\nAnonymous3\n\nAnsbert\n\nBlasien\n\n“De expugnatione civitatis Acconensis,” in Chronica magistri Rogeri de Houedene, ed.

The Toron, viewed from the north, the site of the most ancient settlement in the area, dating back to Canaanite and then Phoenician times. On its southern side are the remains of the ancient harbor, wherein water from Haifa Bay once flowed. At the hill’s left (eastern) edge can be spotted the modern statue of Napoleon astride his horse, Marengo.\n\n2. Remains of the Tower of Flies in Akko Harbor. The tower was rebuilt several times, and its base can be easily seen from Akko’s southern areas. It sat at the end of a mole running north to the shoreline. The tower once served as the proper entrance to the port: a chain was stretched from it to another tower on the west–east quay, which, when strung, prevented seaborne access to the city.\n\n3. Pietro Vesconte’s map of Acre, from Marino Sanudo’s Liber secretorum fidelium crucis super Terrae Sanctae recuperatione et conservatione. Vesconte’s map provides the most detailed contemporary illustration of medieval Acre. The double wall arrangement dates to the thirteenth century. It and the plethora of gates and towers have confounded historians of the Third Crusade siege, during which the city looked far different. Note the tower in the harbor. On the verso is a less detailed map of medieval Jerusalem.\n\n4. Matthew Paris’ map of Acre, from Chronica maiora. A portion of Paris’ map of the route to the Holy Land, the only drawing depicting a single circuit of walls around Acre. It is, however, less detailed than others, in that it does not illustrate the different quarters of the city. It does show a wall around the suburb of Montmusard, which was erected after Acre’s recapture in 1191.\n\n5. Evidence of northern crusade-era walls in Akko. Because most of Acre’s walls were rebuilt by the Ottomans there are few visible sections of the crusader-era fortifications. In certain places, though, one can spy elements of the crusader walls that were reinforced in later centuries. The section here existed during Napoleon’s siege in 1799 – it was bombarded with cannon fire but never collapsed.\n\n6. Old Akko, viewed from atop the Toron. The height of the Toron (today, Tel Akko) provides a superb 360-degree view of the city and its surroundings. The distance between the hill and the city in the twelfth century was much shorter, perhaps half the distance, because Acre’s defensive wall lay farther east. The walls were later pulled back in the Ottoman period.\n\n7. The siege of Acre, from Chroniques de France ou de St Denis. This is one of a few miniatures of the siege, but it is not contemporary, dating from between 1270 and 1380. It is likely of Parisian origin. The crusaders are assaulting Acre’s walls with missile weapons: note the bow, crossbows, and spear about to be hurled. There are foot soldiers and knights, the latter of whom have evidently dismounted to fight. Note the wooden shield behind which a crossbowman hides; such portable defenses were commonly used to protect both attackers and the operators of siege engines from counterfire.\n\n8. The Scythian women attacking a castle, from Histoire ancienne jusqu’à César. The combat roles of women are periodically featured in both Christian and Muslim sources for the siege of Acre. Women can be found fighting in armor and riding on horses, filling the city moat with stones in order to effect the crossing of crusader siege engines, and they are even said to have executed Muslim soldiers shipwrecked upon Acre’s shoreline.\n\n9. A crusade-era western sword, Oakeshott Type XIa, one of the sword types popular in the late twelfth century, with a longer blade and straight hilt. This one has a “brazil nut”-shaped pommel, while other examples have a pommel in the shape of a disc.\n\n10. One of a pair of tiles illustrating the legendary joust between Richard the Lionheart and Saladin. In that encounter, Richard was said to have unhorsed the sultan and killed him; afterward, Saladin’s Muslim guards rushed the king but Richard decapitated thousands of them with his battle axe. Note the crown and “three lions” crest on his shield.\n\n11. Coin, S.alāh. al-Dīn. The Ayyubid sultan Saladin enthroned and holding what appears to be an orb. This coin was contemporary to his rule, probably minted in 1190 in southeastern Asia Minor (Mayafarikin). Saladin had money problems for nearly his entire reign, as he tended to distribute or spend the sums he acquired rather quickly, rather than hoarding them.\n\n12. Saladin captures the Holy Cross, from Matthew Paris’ Chronica maiora. Saladin captured the purported piece of the True Cross at the Battle of Hattin on 4 July 1187. It had been acquired by crusaders after the conclusion of the First Crusade, and it accompanied Guy of Lusignan during the disaster at the Horns. The return of the cross to Christian hands was negotiated following the fall of Acre in 1191, but Saladin eventually balked at the surrender terms and decided to retain it.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nR\n\nichard the Lionheart lowered his lance and drove it into the shoulder of his jousting opponent, the celebrated Ayyubid sultan Salāh al-Dīn (Saladin), knocking him and his horse to the ground. The . . force of Richard’s charge was unstoppable. He pushed forward, swinging his battle-axe, to slay wave upon wave of Muslim fighters. His bloody attack was so audacious, so glorious, that it inspired his knights to join the charge. More than 60,000 Muslims lost their lives.1 Richard and Saladin’s momentous clash has gone down in history as a shining example of English heroism in the face of an obdurate enemy. The joust, however, never actually happened: rather, it is a well-known legend in a mid-thirteenth-century text, the Romance of Richard Coeur de Lion. Nevertheless, that legendary encounter between the leaders is emblematic of the very real war in which they fought: the Third Crusade, which saw the armies of Saladin and Richard meet several times, most famously in the latter’s great victories at Arsur and Jaffa in 1191 and 1192. And, despite Richard’s inability to recapture the ultimate prize of Jerusalem itself, which has led many historians to dub his crusade a failure, his valorous 1\n\nTHE SIEGE OF ACRE, 1189–1191\n\nreputation was made – and has endured – on the basis of his military exploits in the East. The fighting of the Third Crusade, however, began long before Richard the Lionheart ever arrived in the East. In the summer of 1189, thousands of Christian soldiers gathered before the walls of the city of Acre. Called Ptolemais in the Bible and Akko in modern times, the peninsular city was one of the principal harbors on the Levantine coast.2 Acre had been captured by Saladin during his momentous campaign of 1187, during which the sultan not only destroyed the army of the Kingdom of Jerusalem at the Horns of Hattin, but also retook the Holy City itself. The kingdoms of Western Europe girded themselves for another crusade in response. In the meantime, the unraveling of Saladin’s gains had to begin somewhere, and Acre was to be the starting point. It was there that the armies of the Third Crusade gradually assembled and set about the brutal business of holy war. The siege of Acre was the central action of the Third Crusade and, at nearly two years in length, was also one of the longest western-led sieges of the entire middle ages. It was a complex, multi-stage affair. The besieging Christians soon found themselves under attack from a Muslim army led by Saladin himself, which encircled the crusader camp and threatened to end the operation in short measure. In response, the crusaders built ramparts and dug ditches to protect themselves, which consequently trapped them between the sultan and the garrison defending Acre. The Muslims responded to every crusader action in tandem and with clever and carefully coordinated attacks against the ramparts and repulses of hostile sorties. This forced the westerners to fight on two fronts while desperately straining their necks in the hope of spotting seaborne reinforcements from the Mediterranean. Those ships, a sporadic but vital lifeline to the outside world, provided enough succor that the crusaders were able first to endure the assaults, and then to survive disease, starvation, and despair. Finally, led by the late-arriving kings Richard and Philip II Augustus 2\n\nI N T RO D U C T I O N\n\nof France, the soldiers managed to break through Acre’s walls and achieve an improbable victory in July 1191. The siege of Acre is therefore not the history of a single event, but rather a singular phenomenon: an extended period of regular warfare between two sides, during which their respective communities fought, negotiated, suffered, persevered, and rejoiced. And all this in the context of the most famous religious wars in history, the Crusades, waged between tens of thousands of men and women and led by the most renowned warriors of the age. This book presents the story of Acre in the first-ever comprehensive study of the siege in any language. Acre shared a common role with Jerusalem, for both cities served as capital for the kings of Jerusalem ( Jerusalem itself from 1099 to 1187, Acre from 1191 to 1291). In any war, the acquisition of a capital is a notable event and worthy of study; but while there are numerous studies of Jerusalem’s capture by the army of the First Crusade in 1099, similar studies of Acre are lacking. There are obvious reasons for this disparity. The biggest difference between the two cities, besides location, was the religious significance of Jerusalem and its symbolic ability to evoke piety and draw believers to the idea of holy war.3 Moreover, the First Crusade holds chronological pride of place. The taking of Acre, however, was of comparable political importance. It was more than just a long siege or the beginning of a famous, but ultimately unsuccessful, crusade. Rather, for a brief spell, Acre was the center of the European and Mediterranean worlds. It was a rare occasion on which four heads of state were together on the same field of battle. Acre was a flame to the moths, drawing in these and other leaders one by one and capturing their personal and financial attention for months or years. After its capture in 1191, it became the central rallying point for pilgrims and crusaders alike.4 Christian rule there persisted for a hundred years after the siege’s conclusion. As Christian-held territory in the Levant steadily folded in the thirteenth century, the last outpost to fall was Acre. Much like 3\n\nTHE SIEGE OF ACRE, 1189–1191\n\nConstantinople up to 1453, Acre’s survival meant the kingdom’s survival, the last flickering light of crusading dreams in the East. The siege of Acre was one of the central military events of the crusading era and needs to be recognized as such. It is also a tale remarkably balanced by historical evidence, plentiful and diverse in both western and eastern sources. The story of Acre can be told to a considerable degree from both the Christian and the Muslim perspective, and many of the confusing elements can be resolved via a comparative analysis of the primary documents. Numerically, there are far more Christian accounts: because the crusade was called in the West, authors there were naturally interested in its generation, progress, and outcome, and the witness accounts were later excerpted and copied into local chronicles. The presence of the kings of England and France at Acre only increased this fascination. The Muslim sources, though fewer in number, are evocative and commendable for their proximity to the siege and access not only to participants in the fighting, but also to Saladin and his principal lieutenants. They become less verbose when the siege nears its conclusion and a crusader victory seems certain. With only one exception, none of the writers appear to have been actual combatants, but the close proximity of several witness accounts suggests a higher level of credibility.5 Witnesses are by no means infallible, however, and I have tried to maintain a healthy skepticism when dealing with them.6 Nonetheless, the dual perspectives add humanizing details to an already dramatic story. From either side, we catch glimpses of the labors and frustrations of medieval armies, tempered by their victories and defeats. It is not my intention in this book to present a comprehensive narrative of the origination of the Third Crusade or even its first two years. That would necessitate exploring the full story of Saladin’s advance across Syria in the 1180s, the debacle at the Battle of Hattin in 1187, and Jerusalem’s subsequent capture that same year. One would need to consider the timing, manner, and contexts of the 4\n\nI N T RO D U C T I O N\n\nwestern leaders’ taking the cross and then their mustering of armies in Europe and their respective journeys – all of which were fraught with problems and delays – to the East. One would also need to explore in a fuller manner religious enthusiasm, as John France has called it, which was an important driver of any crusading army. That is a complex topic that has been subjected to intense academic scrutiny and can easily overwhelm a narrative; this book, like France’s, seeks primarily to explore the physical states of the armies and to reference religious elements when those altered or conditioned them.7 In any case, there are numerous other studies in which readers can explore the wider context of the crusade. General histories of the Crusades contain adequate or even excellent analyses of the political interplay between the lords and heads of state, although most of them are narratives within books about the larger crusading period.8 Moreover, while Acre is consistently mentioned in general military histories of the middle ages, there is no single history covering the operational and technological aspects of the siege. No historian has tried to synthesize the siege with all the battles, skirmishes, and naval engagements that took place outside the immediate Acre peninsula. Acre seems to have received attention primarily because of the famous warriors present there; but this sort of celebrity treatment has obscured the fuller story of the siege and the contributions of lesser-known figures. Such a focus on the principals has actually served to blur the place of the siege itself in their respective military records: as this book will argue, neither Richard’s nor Saladin’s performance at Acre was particularly impressive, while Philip’s has been unfairly diminished. Therefore, here I have privileged the military events over the political, situating the siege of Acre as a central event and a locus of conflict where different and competing forces traveled, lived, and waged war. As the first point of hostile contact between Christian and Muslim armies, and a long one at that, it deserves an extended treatment all of its own.9 5\n\nTHE SIEGE OF ACRE, 1189–1191\n\nThe sheer cost and scale of the operation, along with its organizational dimensions, require a much more extended treatment than they have customarily received.10 This book is based on the military narrative and surveys the entire array of land and sea engagements: these include no fewer than eight formal battles in the open field, twelve directed assaults against the city walls, sixteen sorties, ten naval battles, and dozens of skirmishes. Building on this narrative are considerations of the personalities of the warriors involved, particularly the generals, the complex political circumstances in both the Crusader States and Ayyubid territories, and the competing cultural and religious influences and motivations of the combatants. As much as possible, I have tried to incorporate into the story sources beyond the written documents. Acre has been a fertile site for archaeological study and has been called, along with Jerusalem, “the best opportunity for studying medieval urban topography in the Kingdom of Jerusalem.”11 Although the living quarters, roads, and churches within the city are tertiary, archaeological study of Acre’s harbor, fortifications, and surroundings is crucial to an understanding of where different armies were located and the manner in which they were able to operate. Such an interdisciplinary examination of conflict zones reveals new facets of the action and suggests new questions about the practicalities of the military operations described in the extant documents. In this light, I hope the book sufficiently narrates the entire siege and, by focusing on many of its neglected aspects, usefully contributes to the landscape of crusading warfare in general and the Third Crusade in particular.\n\n6\n\nI\n\nTARGET ACRE\n\n“Acre will certainly win eternal fame, for the whole globe assembled to fight for her.” 1\n\nA\n\ncre had been in Christian hands for seventy-three years by the time Saladin arrived before its walls on 9 July 1187. This was just five days after his great victory at the Battle of Hattin, near Tiberias, where the sultan had smashed the army of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, killing a thousand knights and capturing King Guy of Lusignan and Reynald of Châtillon, the lord of Kerak. Reynald was executed when he refused to convert to Islam, and a holy relic, a piece of the True Cross upon which Christ was crucified, landed in Muslim hands.2 Jerusalem itself now lay at Saladin’s mercy, but he first sought to capture the ports along the Mediterranean Sea in order to ward off the Christian military response that would surely be forthcoming. With no army to protect it, Acre was vulnerable. Its governor, the seneschal Joscelin of Courtenay, had fought at Hattin and escaped the carnage, but he quickly surrendered Acre to the Muslims. Many of the citizens felt betrayed and threatened to burn the city down from 7\n\nTHE SIEGE OF ACRE, 1189–1191\n\nwithin. Saladin was able to quell their anxiety by allowing them to depart with their possessions.3 According to Ibn al-Athīr, there was a tremendous amount of loot captured within, which the sultan distributed to his soldiers; subsequently, the governance of the city was given to his son al-Afd·āl ‘Alī and the possessions and revenues of the Templar quarter in particular were given to the lawyer ‘Īsā (‘Īsā D · iyā al-Dīn 4 al-Hakkārī). After settling these affairs, Saladin took his army on a campaign that led to the capture of Sidon (29 July) and Beirut (6 August) in the north and then Ascalon in the south (4 September). Conrad and Guy There was one coastal city, however, that had managed to resist Saladin’s advance: Tyre, a well-fortified port located between Sidon and Acre.5 Most of the survivors of Hattin had fled to Tyre, and on 14 July 1187 Conrad, the marquis of Montferrat, arrived there on a ship from Constantinople. He had intended to travel to Acre to join his father, William V. He soon learned that not only had William been captured at Hattin, but Acre was in Muslim hands. Upon discovering this, he sailed north to Tyre instead.6 After landing, Conrad learned of the death of the count of Tripoli, Raymond III. With Guy in Saladin’s hands, Raymond dead, and the other coastal cities under Muslim control, the marquis was able to emerge as the principal Christian leader in the Levant. Conrad of Montferrat fancied himself a rival to Guy of Lusignan. Guy held the crown of Jerusalem by virtue of his marriage to Queen Sibylla, the sister of King Baldwin IV “the Leper King” (d. 1185). However, Guy was Sibylla’s second husband: her first had been Conrad’s brother, William Longsword, who married her in 1176 and then died in 1177, but not before siring a son, Baldwin V, who died in 1186. There was thus a Montferrat tie to the throne, but it was dashed when Sibylla chose Guy and crowned him king, an action then ratified when Patriarch Heraclius of Jerusalem anointed him. 8\n\nTA RG E T A C R E\n\nGuy had had many enemies over his long career, but Conrad would turn out to be one of the most persistent.7 In the meantime, Saladin continued his march. After the fall of Ascalon, the sultan finally moved on Jerusalem. He besieged the city on 25 September; it held out for only a few days before Balian, the lord of Ibelin (modern Yibna) surrendered. Saladin entered the Holy City on 9 October.8 Preparing for the Crusade The disaster of Hattin made a significant impression in the West and led to the calling of the Third Crusade. Drafting of a crusade bull was delayed, however, for, as information flowed in about events in the East, Pope Urban III abruptly died on 20 October 1187, purportedly from shock after hearing the news of Hattin and the loss of the piece of the True Cross. His successor, Gregory VIII, would thus be the one to issue the bull Audita tremendi nine days later.9 Those preaching the papal bull and pushing for crusading commitments found a receptive audience. There had been no comparable expedition eastward since the disastrous Second Crusade in the 1140s, but interest in the Holy Land had remained stout nonetheless. The king of England, Henry II, was involved as far back as 1166, when he proposed a five-year tax of two pennies in the pound for relief in the East. He twice promised to go on crusade himself, in 1170 and 1172, in either Spain or the Holy Land; failing that, he promised to provide further monies for military support. These promises were finalized in Pope Alexander III’s “Compromise of Avranches,” which detailed Henry’s penance for the role he played in the murder of Thomas Becket, archbishop of Canterbury. In 1185, the king promised funds from a threeyear income tax, but rejected Heraclius’ request for his personal involvement. His son Richard, the future Richard I “the Lionheart,” took the cross prematurely, before the papal bull had even been issued.10 It was not until 21 January 1188 that Henry II made a firmer commitment. Joscelin, archbishop of Tyre, had been traveling around 9\n\nTHE SIEGE OF ACRE, 1189–1191\n\nEurope with stories of the fall of Jerusalem, and on this occasion he gave a sermon on the crusade to both Henry and King Philip II Augustus of France. Both kings and Philip d’Alsace, count of Flanders, took the cross; moreover, both agreed to Henry’s proposal of a massive levy, dubbed the “Saladin Tithe.” In England, the cost, somewhere around £12,000, was mostly borne by the English Jewry.11 Two months later, in Mainz, the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick Barbarossa similarly took the cross. Henry’s early funding indeed paid for soldiers and arms that were present at both Hattin and Jerusalem in 1187, but the king himself never went on crusade. He died on 6 July 1189, two years after the Battle of Hattin, but nearly two months before Guy of Lusignan’s arrival at Acre. It would be left to his son Richard to lead the English contingent. Preparations began across the continent: monies were raised, troops were assembled, and political disputes were put on hold as the three most powerful secular leaders in medieval Europe, along with a host of lesser nobles, prepared to journey east on the Third Crusade.12 Those leaders who volunteered would be cooperating with what was believed to have been the will of God. Audita tremendi, which formally started the Third Crusade nearly two years before the siege of Acre even began, outlines the connection: It is certainly not new, nor unusual, that that land is persecuted by a divine judgment that, after being beaten and corrected, it may obtain mercy. Of course, the Lord could preserve it by his will alone, but it is not for us to know why he would do this. Perhaps he wished to experience and bring to the notice of others if someone is understanding and seeking God, who having offered himself embraces the time of penance joyfully.13\n\nThis notion of God desiring the cooperation of man in matters of war would appear, in fact, in both Christian and Muslim accounts of Acre. Saladin’s illnesses, for example, which often prevented his 10\n\nTA RG E T A C R E\n\nengaging the crusaders in the manner he wished, were attributed to the will of Allah and were to be accepted without complaint. Saladin himself would try to focus on divine signs that foretold his enemy’s eventual defeat.14 As preparations were made in the West, back in the Levant discord and disunity were the order of the day. The plight of Acre was, at first, only a small footnote in the much larger story of the fall of the Holy City, which had been in Christian hands since 1099. But it would soon become the focal point of the entire crusading enterprise. In the summer of 1188, Saladin released Guy of Lusignan from captivity, doing so, perhaps, in the hope that the rivalry between him and Conrad of Montferrat would further destabilize Christian control in the region. As a condition of his freedom, Guy was made to swear an oath never to take up arms against Saladin again. He thereafter gathered his family and supporters and made his way to Tripoli, north of Beirut, where Balian of Ibelin had led the refugees from Jerusalem. Back in Tyre, Conrad had smartly fortified the city, for in November 1188 Saladin arrived and commenced a siege that would last through the summer of 1189. While Conrad successfully repelled the Muslim assaults, Saladin simultaneously traipsed all over Syria, capturing city after city and fortress after fortress.15 Now, in the summer of 1189, Guy collected as many soldiers as he could, both in Tripoli and Antioch, and led his new army south to Tyre. Whereas Tripoli lay within the County of Tripoli, Tyre was part of the Kingdom of Jerusalem; naturally, Guy and Sibylla expected to take up residence there. However, Conrad rebuffed them and refused to grant entry to the royal couple, let alone their soldiers.16 The march to Acre In August 1189, sitting outside Tyre, Guy of Lusignan decided he could wait no longer and prepared to move south to Acre. He had 11\n\nTHE SIEGE OF ACRE, 1189–1191\n\nfew choices before him, save for leaving the kingdom entirely, and the coastal city provided an obvious first target in what was sure to be a grinding campaign to wrest territory away from Saladin. His force was between 400 and 700 knights in number and he had some 7,000 to 9,000 infantry, certainly large enough to besiege Acre if conditions were favorable. Still, he asked for God’s grace, since Acre was well fortified and he would likely be outnumbered should Saladin bring his armies in relief. He was encouraged by Patriarch Heraclius and his brother Geoffrey, who reminded him that the leaders in Europe had all taken the cross and would eventually join in the endeavor.17 Guy set out on 22 August, marching south along the Scandelion Pass (al-Iskanderūna), a coastal road that hewed away from the interior where Muslim scouts might be lurking. The western sources claim that Saladin was oblivious to Guy’s movements, but the Arabic texts indicate otherwise: he was indeed aware of the time and direction of the march, which seems to have been revealed when the army stumbled upon a small group of Muslims and skirmished with them.18 This early contact marked a crucial moment in the campaign. Messengers relayed the position of the crusaders to Saladin. Given the narrow confines of the road and the element of surprise, he considered throwing his army against Guy and destroying his forces right then and there. Yet he hesitated. Saladin was at al-Shaqīf Arnūn (otherwise known as Belfort Castle), which lay east of Tyre and in a defensible spot on the Litani River, between the sea and Damascus.19 He wondered if Guy’s move was an elaborate ruse, designed to pull him away from his location and thereby open the way north and south. At least that is the version offered by Ibn Shaddād (Bahā’ al-Dīn Ibn Shaddād), one of Saladin’s personal judges (qād·ī), who accompanied the sultan during most of the siege and wrote down his recollections in The Rare and Excellent History of Saladin. The two men did not actually meet until 1188, and so Ibn Shaddād was present neither at the Battle of Hattin nor during the retaking of 12\n\nTA RG E T A C R E\n\nJerusalem in 1187, but he was an eyewitness at Acre, and seems to have left Saladin’s side only once during the entire siege. His background was that of an ‘alim, a religious scholar, and there are frequent references to the Koran throughout the text. His view of Saladin is quite complimentary, perhaps because he was composing his text while the sultan was still alive, and intended it as a gift to him.20 This was but one view. The Mosul writer Ibn al-Athīr (Ali ‘Izz al-Dīn Ibn al-Athīr al-Jazarī) presents a completely different story in his universal history, al-Kāmil f ī’l-ta’rīkh, which includes not only the Third Crusade, but also Islamic history prior to the First Crusade.21 Although its composition is contemporary, Ibn al-Athīr never served Saladin and was not an eyewitness to any part of the siege of Acre.22 His physical separation from events and seeming antagonism towards Saladin, which often reads as notes of subtle criticism, was pointed out by Hamilton Gibb in 1950, and he is now considered the least reliable of the three major Arabic sources for Acre.23 According to Ibn al-Athīr, Saladin convened his emirs in council and sought their advice. While he wished to stop Guy at the pass, the emirs argued that it was too narrow and treacherous to fully engage the crusader army; therefore, the troops should be let through and then met on the Acre plain instead. Ibn al-Athīr suspects that the emirs were simply lazy and Saladin knew it, but he took their advice anyway and declined to engage, choosing instead to shadow the crusaders on their eastern side. He moved towards Tiberias and sent a detachment to harass their vanguard and report on their movements. The reports streamed in: Guy reached ‘Ayn Bas.s.a and then al-Zīb on 27 August, and finally Acre the following day. The opportunity to stop the crusaders had now passed, and so the sultan rejoined his main army with the forward detachment at Marj Saffurīyya, pausing there until his baggage train caught up, and then finally moved his entire army to al-Kharrūba, a hill southeast of Acre. He was also able to send reinforcements and supplies into the city.24 Its garrison would not capitulate without a fight. 13\n\nTHE SIEGE OF ACRE, 1189–1191\n\nSaladin’s hesitancy in attacking the crusader army directly was emblematic of his leadership style. Throughout the Acre siege, he would often defer to the wishes of his emirs, knowing full well that it was necessary to cultivate their loyalty, else his grand army might splinter apart. Local disputes in Syria weighed on the minds of the regional lords, and their inclination was to keep one eye on Acre and the other on home. Yet on this occasion, collaboration and deferment may have cost the sultan dearly. Writing with the benefit of hindsight, Ibn al-Athīr speculates that the Muslims could have eliminated the crusader threat at the outset. Saladin himself believed that once Guy made camp outside Acre, it would be very difficult to dislodge him. The sultan’s words were prescient, and so the author could only write, perhaps with a sigh, “when God wills a matter, he prepares its means.”25\n\n14\n\nII\n\nTHE SIEGE BEGINS 1189\n\n“One way or another the time was fully occupied with fighting.” 1\n\nB\n\ny August’s end, Guy of Lusignan and his army had survived the Scandelion Pass and arrived before Acre, where they were eventually joined by other contingents, as well as by the Pisans, who had chosen to sail rather than march. They gazed upon a formidable challenge: a peninsula protected on three sides by water and also a ring of stone walls. Because Acre had been in Christian hands from 1104 to 1187, its defenses were well known; but after capturing the city in 1187, Saladin had ordered its garrisoning and had strengthened the walls.2 Taking it would be difficult. A visitor to the modern city, today called Akko, is immediately struck by the fortifications which, although not of the crusader era, nonetheless provide an unforgettable image of how the peninsula could be protected and defended (see Appendix A). The old city of Acre sits on a 40-acre peninsula that is connected to the land on its north side and juts southward. To the west is the Mediterranean Sea, to the south Haifa Bay, and to the east a portion of that bay that 15\n\nTHE SIEGE OF ACRE, 1189–1191\n\nforms a harbor. In time, the early medieval settlement grew beyond the immediate peninsular area and onto the mainland, eventually encompassing about 62 acres, and defensive walls were built along a perimeter that surrounded this pocket of expansion, as well as all approaches to the peninsula itself. The land there lies at sea level, with one portion of the northern city rising to 6 meters above the rest.3 Farther north and close to the Mediterranean coastline is the suburb of Montmusard, which is first mentioned in the year 1120 and grew slowly until 1187. After the city fell to the crusaders in 1191, it grew even more, eventually acquiring its own set of walls.4 In other words, the crusader city was bigger than the walled portion of the city that stands today. Fighting was heavy at the city gates during the siege, but these are rarely identified in the sources or maps. Although the early maps show a double wall around the city, during the Third Crusade there was only one circuit. Several gates and towers studded the length of the wall, and it was fronted by a lower forewall and a deep ditch.5 The blockade The principals and their respective locations are marked by different sources. Guy of Lusignan, along with his wife Sibylla, her daughters Alice and Maria, his brother Geoffrey, and Patriarch Heraclius, camped upon the ancient hill of the Toron, otherwise known as Tel al-Mus.allabīn or Tel al-Fukhkhār (today, Tel Akko), climbing it by night to avoid detection. From this vantage point they could look down into the fringes of the city, and it provided an expansive view of the Acre plain. The eastern edge of the Toron drops steeply and would have given Guy a highly defensive position immune from cavalry charges (see Plate 1). Around and in front, between the Toron and the city walls, were Guy’s soldiers. There was not much distance between the two positions, for archaeological finds suggest that the city’s eastern wall was much closer to the Toron than previously 16\n\nTHE SIEGE BEGINS\n\nthought. Moreover, the Christian army did not frighten Acre’s defenders: the garrison outnumbered its attackers and could have swallowed them up, “just as a sparrowhawk takes a small bird.”6 It likely did not frighten Saladin either. Marching from Belfort, the sultan had spent late August sending summonses for additional soldiers throughout his domains, and he refused to move against the crusader camp until the bulk of them had arrived. Men from Mosul, Sinjār, Diyār Bakr, and elsewhere soon flocked to the area. The Christians were acutely aware of the flow of Muslim reinforcements and watched them arrive, contingent by contingent, from the heights of the Toron. The flood of enemies inspired the Christian warriors to pray for God to succor them.7 The first principals named in the Arabic sources were Taqī al-Dīn (al-Malik al-Muz.affar Taqī al-Dīn ‘Umar, Saladin’s nephew and the lord of Hama) and Muz.affar al-Dīn (Muz.affar al-Dīn Kūkbūrī ibn Zayn al-Dīn, lord of Harran and Edessa). Saladin moved from al-Kharrūba on 30 August and made his camp on Tel Kaysān, closer to the city. His grand army then spread itself out in a crescent that surrounded the entirety of Guy’s army. The Muslim left wing stretched west to the River Belus and the right wing to Tel al-‘Ayyād·iyya. In front of the main ranks was a stationary advance guard, whose orders were to harass the crusader perimeter on a daily basis and prevent anyone from escaping the encirclement. They would be in a good position to attack the enemy camp and to lob arrows upon Guy’s forces atop the Toron both day and night. Trapped between Acre’s walls and Saladin’s ranks, “those who had come to besiege were themselves besieged.”8 Fear abounded, and the crusaders prayed for the Holy Spirit to come because he “knows our needs both militarily and bodily.”9 The crusaders had managed to carry out only one attack upon Acre before Saladin arrived, probably on 1 September. Because his catapults were not yet assembled Guy was forced to attack solely with infantry, who rushed forward with ladders in an attempt to scale the city walls, and melees broke out along its line. The attack was 17\n\nTHE SIEGE OF ACRE, 1189–1191\n\nquickly aborted when a messenger brought news that Saladin’s main army was approaching. That report was misleading, because the Muslims arrived in waves, not all at once. The writer Richard of Templo seems convinced that the crusaders would have entered Acre and ended the siege that very day, had they not panicked so easily.10 Richard was the prior of Holy Trinity in London, an Augustinian house, who arrived at Acre with the English contingent in 1191. His Itinerarium peregrinorum et gesta regis Ricardi is a major source for the Third Crusade, but for Acre it is mostly original for the last part of the siege, with the rest drawn from other sources. The first was the principal Old French account of the siege, the Estoire de la Guerre Sainte, a verse account of the Third Crusade written by Ambroise, a Norman, who may have been a jongleur or cleric, or both.11 Richard’s second source was a similarly named Itinerarium peregrinorum, which was probably written by a monk at Tyre but covers only events in the East up to 24 November 1190. As it was, this was to be the only moment for the next two years when the Christians would have the luxury of besieging the city without simultaneously defending against Muslim attacks upon their camp. Saladin’s first attack on the crusading army came the very next day. Despite wanting to wait for his brother al-‘Ādil (al-Malik al-‘Ādil Sayf al-Dīn Abū Bakr ibn Ayyūb) to return from a diplomatic trip to Baghdad, the sultan assented to his emirs’ desire to move forward.12 A letter to Pope Clement III written by two Italian crusaders, Theobald the Prefect and Peter, son of Leo, records the details of this very first combat between Guy and Saladin’s soldiers. The Muslims moved their left flank forward towards the harbor, to the southwest of the Toron, attacking the camp of the Knights Hospitaller and Guy’s brother Geoffrey of Lusignan, who happened to be with the Brothers at the time. The crusaders were thrown back and then squeezed north between the city walls and the Toron. This resulted in a brief opening of a pathway to the city, along the shoreline of the bay; worse, the Muslims partially trapped Guy and his men on their 18\n\nTHE SIEGE BEGINS\n\nhill in the process. Looking down from the Toron, the king saw Muslims operating to the east, south, and west. Now defending his hilltop position and realizing his sudden plight, Guy pleaded to God for reinforcements. It was a desperate prayer, because he had no idea if Conrad of Montferrat, who had treated him so poorly just a few weeks beforehand, would be keen to help.13 Fortunately for Guy, more soldiers were indeed on their way, and not just from Tyre. In mid-September, a fleet arrived from the west, led by the lord of Condé and Guise, James of Avesnes. Fifty ships strong, the fleet carried between 12,000 and 14,000 Flemings, Frisians, Germans, and Bretons. A second fleet carrying Danes, Welsh, and Cornish seems to have arrived the day before. James himself is called “a Nestor in counsel” and an Achilles in arms, better and more worthy than Alexander or Hector; he had mortgaged all his properties in order to pay for the ships and men.14 It seems that James took control of the army’s field operations after his arrival, sometimes directing the flow of battle himself and at other times sharing the responsibility with Ludwig III, the landgrave of Thuringia.15 Near the end of the month, reinforcements from Tyre arrived as well, brought by the marquis Conrad and Gerardo of Ravenna. The letter of Theobald and Peter claims that these latest troops numbered 20,000 infantry and 1,000 knights.16 Ibn Shaddād put the full size of the crusader army, after the arrival of all the ships, at 2,000 cavalry and 30,000 infantry, and perhaps more. The additional ships served to tighten the naval blockade of Acre’s port, as they joined with the fifty-two Pisan ships that were already in the area. The port and harbor area feature prominently in the siege narrative. Acre’s fortifications extended into the bay and served to protect the city’s port. A prominent feature in the harbor was the Tower of Flies, built atop a Hellenistic foundation and constructed of ashlar stones joined by metal clamps. The remains of the tower can still be seen both from the shore east of the city and from the road that runs 19\n\nTHE SIEGE OF ACRE, 1189–1191\n\ndown the modern breakwater (see Plate 2). From the Tower of Flies, a mole once ran northwest to the eastern city wall. Built of marble and ashlar stones, the mole barred the city port from the natural harbor in the bay.17 During the siege, there are periodic references to crusader ships landing beyond it and being offloaded. South of the peninsula, a quay ran from the land’s edge east towards the Tower of Flies, serving as a breakwater. It ended in a second tower, and between it and the Tower of Flies hung a massive chain that guarded the port entrance.18 With the chain withdrawn, ships could enter the port and dock safely: they likely approached the entrance from the southwest, entered, then turned sharply left (west) to dock. It seems that larger ships had trouble maneuvering in the tight confines, and instead dropped anchor in the bay, ferrying their cargo to shore in smaller vessels. This is because the entrance was only 85 meters wide, and the port itself was shallow and only 90,000 square meters.19 After disembarking, sailors would move through the Iron Gate (Porta ferrae) and pay customs duties in the Court of the Chain.20 Sealing off the port entrance was a vital element of the crusader blockade. In the initial stages, however, the Christian captains did not always coordinate their movements and Muslim ships periodically ran the blockade to access the port. And as Christian cargo ships landed on the bay shoreline, they were attacked by Muslim detachments, and so the Christians near the shore, joined by soldiers coming down from the Toron, rushed forward to beat off the attacks and protect the newly delivered goods and men. Skirmishing between the reinforcements and Muslims continued even once the landings were complete.21 The arrivals set up camp outside the city. The area southwest of the Toron, flanking Acre’s harbor and Haifa Bay, had been the scene of all the early fighting: there encamped men from the empire and Genoa, as well as the Knights Templar and Hospitaller. They were led by James of Avesnes and Ludwig III, and the Genoese by their acting consul Guido Spinola and six other nobles.22 To the north and 20\n\nTHE SIEGE BEGINS\n\nalong the Mediterranean, in and near the suburb of Montmusard, were the Pisans; Conrad of Montferrat would join them there after his arrival.23 The physical separation of Guy and Conrad was later noted by the historian William, canon of Newburgh. William wrote in northern England and relied heavily on witness accounts for information, to which he added more commentary than description. He attributed the lackluster opening stages of the siege to the two men’s antagonisms.24 This and other rivalries were a persistent feature of the crusades in general. Acrimony, petty grievances, and old grudges were commonplace in any mustering of soldiers in the period, but on crusade such disputes could be elevated and compounded. This was due not only to the diversity of the soldiers, the lands from which they hailed, and the variance between their motivations for fighting, but also to the absence of strong, central command.25 At Acre, similar issues led to disagreements over strategy, long periods of inaction, and periodic missteps that resulted in combat losses. At other times, however, the crusading host was able to operate fluidly via an articulated division of command; maneuvering and fighting in tandem, it could perform quite well in the field. In any case, the crusader army had now tripled in size and was able to invest the city walls with deeper ranks. In the mind of the western authors, these reinforcements were the direct result of divine intervention. Richard of Templo describes the joy and weeping of the men on the Toron as they first spotted the ships and their Christian standards, and one by one they praised God for his assistance: No one should doubt that it was God who sent this aid and comfort to those who trusted in His mercy. Now you will hear how God looks upon those whom He takes into His care. While they were in these straits, the Dayspring from on high visited them.26 21\n\nTHE SIEGE OF ACRE, 1189–1191\n\nIn Richard’s reading, the western reinforcements served two immediate purposes. First, they preserved the crusader presence at Acre. Guy’s position was extremely precarious: he had initially been trapped on the Toron, but even once his reinforcements arrived he was presented with the challenge of fending off Saladin’s full army. This meant defending against dual attacks from the city and Saladin on a daily basis – attacks that were coordinated by smoke signals.27 Only some heroic efforts by the Knights Hospitaller and Templar (vaguely described, unfortunately) prevented the Muslims from penetrating the camp. Second, the new soldiers allowed a closer investing of Acre itself. The besiegers posted guards and patrols at each of the city gates, in order to prevent major sorties and easy communication between the Muslim contingents. But the eventual human toll would be great indeed. Richard of Templo reveals that of the thousands of men who disembarked from the newly arrived ships in September 1189, only a hundred survived to see Acre fall in 1191.28 This is a shocking number if true; but even allowing for exaggeration, the death rate was apparently extremely high. Probing the lines The Arabic sources pick up the story once the Christian reinforcements had settled into camp. Saladin sent his emir Qāraqūsh (Bahā’ al-Dīn al-Asadī Qāraqūsh) into the city to organize its defenses better.29 At dawn on Thursday, 14 September 1189, the Muslims began their first full-on assault against the besiegers. It was a coordinated affair, as was to be the norm for the duration of the siege: the Acre garrison sallied out of the city gates on the southern and western sides of the Christians, while Saladin’s army attacked from the east and north. This was the first formal battle at Acre in which armies drew up regular ranks, and it lasted for several days. The operation had been determined in council the night before. Saladin’s objective on this occasion was not necessarily to destroy 22\n\nTHE SIEGE BEGINS\n\nthe enemy army, but rather to break the crusader blockade and open a permanent route into Acre, in order to ensure its resupply. If successful, such a link would render the blockade fruitless. As was their wont, the Muslims attacked with light cavalry armed with bows, spiked clubs or swords, spears, and daggers. Richard of Templo describes their famous and customary tactic of the “feigned retreat”: It is the Turks’ habit, when they realize that their pursuit has stopped following them, to stop running away themselves – like an infuriating fly which flies away if you drive it off and returns when you stop. As long as you chase it, it flees; as soon as you stop it is there again. The Turks are just like that. When you stop pursuing and turn back, then the Turk follows you; if you pursue, the Turk flees.30\n\nThe plan was three-fold: Saladin’s men assembled their ranks on Wednesday night and slept in position; salat prayers were said on Thursday morning (presumably fajr), and immediately after prayer concluded, the attack began. The army was divided into three divisions of left, center, and right, with the left division against the River Belus and the right against the Mediterranean, north of Montmusard. In this way, the sultan engaged the entire crusade camp at once.31 This was the customary arrangement of a Muslim army in the period and was employed by Saladin throughout the siege. Although we lack details on the depth at Acre, the ideal sort presented in the later military manual by the writer al-Ansari was five lines: advance guard/ vanguard and a second line behind it, both cavalry; a third line to protect the light baggage in front; a fourth line to protect the baggage at the back; and a rearguard.32 On this occasion, the right wing seems to have had the most success, with Taqī al-Dīn nearly breaking through to the city along the Mediterranean coastline; but by the end of the day, the fighting concluded without result. 23\n\nTHE SIEGE OF ACRE, 1189–1191\n\nThe next day, Friday, saw the latent fruits of the lord of Hama’s efforts: the scattered crusaders facing Taqī al-Dīn had bunched together for protection, leaving open a slim seaside route to the city.33 Here, the close proximity of the Arabic authors is invaluable because they were with Saladin and could see the next phase of the action. The sultan sent reinforcements to Taqī al-Dīn on the right flank, so that he might exploit the gap. There was only a sparse camp infrastructure, and it is doubtful that any wooden buildings had yet been constructed, and so the area was ripe for penetration. Saladin was personally involved at every point in this engagement, hardly stopping to eat and behaving “like a bereft mother in his great anxiety and abundant care.”34 Taqī al-Dīn’s attack commenced on Friday morning. His men first drove south, pushing the crusaders towards the city wall. He then pivoted his forces left and pushed again, sending the enemy sliding along that wall to the east, running towards the safety of their tents and comrades down the line. The result was a clear path to Acre along the sea. The Muslims then oriented into a defensive line, forming ranks running south to north and perpendicular to the wall. In this way, Taqī al-Dīn established a defensible corridor that connected with the gate of St Michael. The blockade had been broken.35 The repercussions of the day’s fighting soon became apparent: a caravan full of laden camels was seized by the garrison, Muslims entered and exited the city as they liked, and one of Saladin’s sons was escorted out of the city, while Emir H . usām al-Dīn Abū’l-Hayjā 36 “the Fat,” a Kurd from Irbil, entered. Ibn al-Athīr writes of a steady stream of soldiers, money, and supplies being sent into Acre. It must have been maddening for the crusaders to watch, for their blockade of the city had been broken only days after having first been established. Symbolically, what happened next must have been devastating to their morale: Saladin himself entered Acre. Ascending to the top of its walls, the sultan grandly surveyed the enemy camp beneath 24\n\nTHE SIEGE BEGINS\n\nhim, looking down upon the encamped Christians. No wonder “the Muslims rejoiced at their God-given victory.”37 The speed and success of the Muslim soldiers evidently also impressed the western authors, who saw fit to compliment them. Although they “did not believe in God,” “they were truly the most preeminent men,” because “virtue is praiseworthy even in an enemy.”38 Matters might have been worse. Ibn al-Athīr speculates that, had Taqī al-Dīn pressed home his advantage, he may have routed the crusaders entirely. As it was, the assault was soon called off. None of the Arabic sources reveal who gave the order, although another witness, ‘Imād al-Dīn (‘Imād al-Dīn al-Ișfahānī), offers an image of a watchful Saladin gazing over his army as night fell that could be read as suggestive. ‘Imād al-Dīn was a well-situated witness and Saladin’s secretary (kātib). His original text is no longer extant, but comes to us via the compiler Shihāb al-Dīn Abū’l Qasim Abu Shāma (d. 1267), who copied portions of it into his later thirteenth-century Book of the Two Gardens. ‘Imād al-Dīn was Abu Shāma’s chief source for the reigns of Nūr al-Dīn and Saladin, likely because of the affinity between both writers’ views on life and history.39 Our other Muslim witness, Ibn Shaddād, thought the soldiers were negligent: it was after noonday dhuhr prayer, the horses needed water, and the men needed rest, but the plan had been to resume combat after a short break.40 In any event, even one night turned out to be a costly delay. On Sunday morning, 17 September, the Muslims drew up their ranks once more, but in a different fashion. Most of them dismounted – even the emirs – and they advanced on the crusader camp on foot. The crusaders maddeningly refused to engage but remained close to their tents; even when prodded with some light skirmishing (not described but likely missile fire) they refused to take the bait. As a result, some of Saladin’s emirs effected a postponement of the attack. Some of the soldiers were sent inside Acre instead, from where they were told to sally forth alongside the garrison on the next Tuesday, 19 September; the rest of Saladin’s forces, the emirs argued, should 25\n\nTHE SIEGE OF ACRE, 1189–1191\n\ncharge from the outward side at the same time. “They carried out the plan but the enemy resisted strongly, protecting themselves amongst their tents”; the plan therefore failed, despite Saladin personally leading the men from Acre, and the Muslims settled down for skirmishing during the rest of the week.41 The fighting on 16–17 September is interesting and has not been properly studied. After a great cavalry victory, the Muslims deliberately advanced on foot, rather than astride. Why? The tradition of Muslim infantry tactics is not incredibly rich in the period overall.42 The crusader camp was not ringed with any physical defenses beyond the height of the Toron (the digging of protective ditches would not begin until October); they had only their tents for protection. The Muslims also outnumbered the westerners in the general Montmusard area.43 There is no mention of the Christians utilizing buildings in Montmusard for protection, although if they did that could explain the use of foot soldiers, who are better suited for house-to-house fighting. The traditional eastern methods of horseback archery, mobile harassment, and feigned retreats would not have worked so well had the Christians been protected by roofs.44 Alternatively, the answer may be that Taqī al-Dīn and his men were simply overconfident. R.C. Smail noted that the final defeat of an enemy was usually at close quarters, after Muslim archers and light cavalry had severely reduced their ranks.45 Perhaps, then, they believed the besiegers to be on their last legs and that they would crumble quickly. The situation was quite the opposite: having survived two direct assaults on their flank, the crusaders now began to increase their activities in the area. On Friday, 22 September, they were organized enough to march out in force against the Muslims surrounding them: “The battlefield remained a lively market where lives were sold for precious gain and the storms of war rained down on the heads of captains young and old.”46 No western source describes this particular battle in any detail – or indeed provides any operational details at all from the remainder 26\n\nTHE SIEGE BEGINS\n\nof the month, perhaps because it was filled with disaster. From Ibn Shaddād’s telling, a huge wall of foot soldiers marched in front, protecting the crusader horses walking behind it. As one, they moved forward towards the Muslim advance guard. Saladin cried out “Huzzah for Islam!” and this advance guard immediately mounted and charged, engaging and scattering the infantry at close quarters. The crusaders fled en masse, trampling each other in a panicked attempt to return to their camp. Periodic skirmishing continued for three days; Ibn Shaddād claims that he himself entered Acre, climbed atop its walls, and hurled missiles at the besiegers below.47 The repulse of the crusader march must have left an impression on Saladin. As opposed to the previous week, when his men had marched towards the western camp to little effect, the benefits of drawing the enemy out into the open field were blindingly obvious. He therefore instigated a new strategy: he would lure the crusaders out of their camp by giving quarter. The Muslim lines were pulled back a distance, and the baggage train was sent to Tel al-‘Ayyād·iyya, a nearby hill to the east of Acre.48 This gave the crusaders some room to venture out and forage, and the Muslim baggage might provide a tantalizing target. In the short term, the idea worked: on either the next Friday or Saturday (29/30 September), some crusaders on Saladin’s left flank emerged from camp and walked to the River Belus, gathering wood for fires, and also plants and grasses for horse fodder. Some mounted Bedouin soldiers, whom Saladin had placed at the river as a guard, attacked them, killing some and taking others prisoner. The Bedouins then exchanged the severed heads of their victims with Saladin in return for robes and gifts.49 Greater victories were yet to come. The October battle October’s dawn saw the fulfillment of Saladin’s plan: the crusade leaders decided to attack the sultan head on and in full strength. There were legitimate and sensible reasons behind the advance. King 27\n\nTHE SIEGE OF ACRE, 1189–1191\n\nGuy and his allied barons met in council to discuss the plan, and their reasoning was logical enough. The Christians could not devote their full attention to the siege with such a large army behind them, waiting to intervene as soon as the catapults began firing. Food stores were also running low. Although some supplies had arrived on ships two weeks before, these were evidently not enough to keep filling the stomachs of both Guy’s army and the reinforcements. The Old French Continuations of the chronicle of William, archbishop of Tyre, also speak of the clear and present dangers of the Muslim encirclement. The Continuations were finished by the 1220s at the earliest, and so provide a later recounting of events from the preceding generation. The four main versions have a complicated array of similarities and differences; but for the siege of Acre, the most useful is the fullest for the period 1184–97, the so-called Lyon Eracles, which was probably completed by 1250.50 Moreover, Guy had numbers on his side. New soldiers were arriving every day, led by some of the more notable magnates present at Acre: Erard II, count of Brienne, and his brother Andrew; the seneschal of Flanders and a host of Flemings; Henry I, count of Bar-le-Duc; Count Robert of Dreux and his brother Bishop Philip of Beauvais, and five archbishops (of Arles-le-Blanc, Besançon, Montreal, Nazareth, and Pisa). The crusaders now had enough soldiers for a general action, and so they undertook one.51 Ibn al-Athīr offers a modification of this same notion. Far away in Mosul, and obviously not present for Guy’s council, he surmised that the leaders were aware that large portions of the armies under Saladin’s titular control had not yet arrived at Acre. Their best chance, then, was to attack before these reinforcements did arrive.52 Unstated, but also likely, was a general frustration over the constant harassment of their camp and a corresponding inability to break into the city. As a result, Guy and his allies decided to engage Saladin’s lines on the morning of Wednesday, 4 October, with the intent of reaching and destroying the Muslim camp at Tel al-‘Ayyād·iyya. 28\n\nTHE SIEGE BEGINS\n\nEvery western account gives a different arrangement for the crusading forces, and so some sorting out is necessary (Map 2). The attacking force was arranged in three lines, with archers and crossbowmen in the first rank, followed by infantry in the second, and cavalry in the third. The lines were then split into three sections: left, center, and right.53 The left wing, springing from the path Taqī al-Dīn had opened alongside the Mediterranean Sea, was led by Conrad of Montferrat and Gerardo, bishop of Ravenna.54 The infantry and missile ranks were primarily Italians. The right wing extended to the River Belus and was directed by Guy himself, but it is unclear whether he remained on the Toron or advanced with the others.55 The cavalry on the right wing consisted of Knights Hospitaller, and the infantry and missile troops were Italian and French.56 The center, which would see the most fighting, was near the mosque of ‘Ain-Baqar, outside the city walls, and was commanded by Andrew of Brienne and Ludwig III, who sat in the rearguard with their knights.57 Gerard of Ridefort, the master of the Templars, led the vanguard of this center division, riding alongside the other Templars; in front of them, in the infantry rank, were Catalan and German foot soldiers and missile troops. Remaining in the camp as a check against sorties from the Acre garrison was Guy’s brother, Geoffrey of Lusignan, accompanied by James of Avesnes and the respective men under their command.58 Opposing the crusaders were the divisions of Saladin’s army, which are well described in the Arabic sources. Once again, the sultan had ordered the men to camp in position the night before. On his extreme right wing (opposing Conrad on the crusader left) was the sultan’s nephew, Taqī al-Dīn, who at that point had been the most accomplished general during the conflict. He and his men took position on the end of the line, by the sea. On the near right, closer to the center division, were Saladin’s sons al-Afd·āl and al-Z.āhir, as well as H . usām al-Dīn ibn Lājīn (lord of Nablus) and the tawashi Qaymāz al-Najmī.59 The rest of the right consisted of soldiers from Mosul, 29\n\n4 October 1189: First Moves Christians\n\nMuslims\n\n1\n\n2 Center\n\nCenter Right\n\nFar Right\n\nCenter\n\n3\n\nMissile Troops Infantry Left\n\nInfantry Center\n\nCavalry Left\n\nCavalry Center\n\nCavalry Right\n\nCrusader Camp/ Reserve\n\nCenter Left ard Gu ce van ps Ad roo eT ssil Mi\n\nMediterranean Sea\n\nAdvance Guard\n\nFar Left\n\nInfantry Right\n\nToron\n\nA c r e\n\n1&KULVWLDQOHIWHQJDJHVDQGGULYHVRII7DTĦDO'ĦQ 2 Saladin diverts soldiers from center to Muslim right 3 Christian center and right engage the Muslim center\n\n4 October 1189: Muslim Victory Center & Center Right\n\nFar Right\n\nCenter Cavalry & Infantry mixed\n\nMediterranean Sea\n\nInfantry Left\n\n5\n\nCavalry Left\n\nCenter Left\n\n6 4\n\nFar Left\n\nAcre Garrison Crusader Camp/ Reserve\n\nToron\n\nA c r e 2. 4 October 1189 battle.\n\n30\n\n4 Acre garrison sorties against the Christian left 5 Saladin rallies against the stalled forward Christians 6 Christian reserves defend the general Christian retreat\n\nTHE SIEGE BEGINS\n\nled by Z.āhir al-Dīn Ibn al-Balankārī, and soldiers from Diyār Bakr, led by Qut. b al-Dīn ibn Nūr al-Dīn (lord of H . is.n Kayfā). The Muslim left wing, opposing Guy and the Hospitallers on the crusader right, was more diverse. On the far left, by the River Belus, were a company from Asadiyya and the mamluks of Asad al-Dīn Shīrkūh (Saladin’s deceased uncle); two mamluk champions, Sayf al-Dīn Yāzkūj and Ruslān Bughā, are mentioned specifically. On the near left, positioned towards the center division, were soldiers from Sinjār, led by Mujāhid al-Dīn Yarunqush, another group of mamluks, and soldiers commanded by Muz.affar al-Dīn (the aforementioned lord of Edessa and Harran). There were other groups of Kurds, too: Emir Mujallī led the Mihrani and Hakkārī Kurds, while others were commanded by their chief Sayf al-Dīn ‘Alī ibn Ahmad al-Masht. . ūb.60 In the center rode Saladin himself, presumably accompanied by his regular troops (‘askar) and personal guard of military slaves, the halqa. Each wing was protected by an advance guard of skirmishers; leading them in front of the center was the lawyer ‘Īsā, the holder of the former Templar revenues in Acre.61 The battle began at nine o’clock.62 The crusaders moved forward and, “like a plague of locusts,” came into contact with the Muslim advance guard and began to disperse it, with the Templars and Hospitallers evidently riding forward through the infantry and missile ranks in order to chase those who fled.63 But the fighting quickly became bogged down along the lines, and Ibn Shaddād claims that four hours passed in this initial combat.64 In the afternoon matters shifted: the Italians on the crusaders’ left wing had managed to push forward deep into the Muslim right, and Taqī al-Dīn ordered his soldiers to pull back. He might have been trying to lure the crusader wing away from the main army so that it could be destroyed in a feigned retreat; alternatively, he may simply have been losing. Theobald and Peter’s letter provides most of the information on the fighting against Taqī al-Dīn, for they themselves were on the crusader left wing. Their letter claims that the Muslims were 31\n\nTHE SIEGE OF ACRE, 1189–1191\n\noverwhelmed, with 500 enemy cavalry killed, as well as one of Saladin’s sons.65 However, when Saladin saw his nephew retire east, he assumed the worst and sent reinforcements from his own center to assist him.66 This was a critical error: when the crusader center and right wing saw the thinning ranks ahead of them, they moved straight towards the sultan’s position, hitting the Muslim line in the gap between the center and the near right wing. Richard of Templo describes the tactic: The Turks stood as if in one mind to defend their camp. As our people came nearer, the unit of infantry which marched in front divided in two, allowing the cavalry to charge boldly between them into the enemy. The Gentiles turned in flight, deserting their camp.67\n\nThis eruption of the heavy cavalry was irresistible; but so, too, was the crusader infantry. The foot soldiers kept pace with the horses: three separate units abreast (infantry–cavalry–infantry) all charging together as one. The second Muslim rank crumbled, as the advance guard had done previously; Ibn Shaddād places the blame on inexperienced soldiers from Diyār Bakr. A general rout began: the right wing fled towards Tel al-‘Ayyād·iyya with crusaders hot in pursuit, while those from the center made for either al-Qahwāna, across the . bridge to Tiberias, or even Damascus. Those Muslims that remained in place met their deaths, and others were caught by the Muslim tents and killed there.68 R.C. Smail included this battle in his well-known chapter on “The Latin Field Army in Action,” but he missed the significance of the morning and afternoon of 4 October.69 The crusaders engaged in sync and rhythm, methodically using their advantage of mixed troop types to frustrate the Muslim cavalry. The leadership was steady and control was sound: the army leaders, despite hailing from different regions and 32\n\nTHE SIEGE BEGINS\n\ncommanding diverse contingents of soldiers, were able to communicate and work together. This is especially impressive when one considers that the bulk of the army had been encamped for less than three weeks. In a tactical sense, it suggests a certain uniformity of military preparation across western lands. Had the crusader army maintained discipline, the battle could have been the moment of victory. Ibn al-Athīr suggests that the Muslims would have been completely routed, had the crusaders only thrown down Saladin’s tents: upon seeing this, the fleeing Muslims on the right wing and even those on the left (which had so far not seriously engaged in the battle) might have presumed Saladin dead or captured and abandoned the field. But at this moment the crusaders halted and, instead of destroying the Muslim camp, chose to loot the tents.70 They were driven by greed, certainly, but also by hunger, and many stopped to eat lunch! They “greedily plundered the booty. Pavilion ropes were cut, and the courageous count of Bar seized the tent of the sultan himself . . . Elsewhere . . . the Germans were greedily pillaging the enemy’s camp.”71 They were not the only ones. The Muslim servants, having seen the camp guards driven off, had hurriedly grabbed spoils of their own before deserting the tents: “People lost vast sums. This was more disastrous than the rout itself.”72 Many of these servants were caught by the crusaders, who cut them down and in turn stole the (stolen) goods. But the looting had brought a halt to the crusader charge and all momentum was lost. Saladin, meanwhile, accompanied by only a few personal retainers, was busy trying to save his army. He rode to the mamluks and Kurds on the left wing, urging them to turn and join in the fight. He also tried to rally the fleeing remnants of the center ranks, encouraging them specifically with a call to jihad and promising eternal rewards: “On, on for Islam!”73 Saladin and other Muslim soldiers frequently called upon God in such a manner before launching an attack.74 Calls of “Allahu akbar!” are peppered throughout the Arabic sources, as are shouted declarations of monotheistic affirmation. 33\n\nTHE SIEGE OF ACRE, 1189–1191\n\nWhile feasting and looting, meanwhile, the crusaders were startled back into action by several developments. First, the Acre garrison had finally joined in the fight. It was unclear in the thick of battle whether it sought to attack the crusader camp or the rear of the distant army: if the former, then Geoffrey of Lusignan and his men might be positioned to counter; but the latter meant that the advanced Christians could be cut off from their base.75 Ibn al-Athīr makes a similar point, but instead claims that it was the Muslim right wing that posed the threat, not the garrison. This seems highly unlikely, since every other source has that right wing being routed. Rather, Theobald and Peter’s letter claims that the garrison – some 5,000 strong – hit the crusader left wing from behind, trapping the Christians between it and Taqī al-Dīn’s dispersed soldiers.76 Second, there was an incident with a horse. During the looting, a horse bolted and began galloping back towards Acre, so its owner and a few companions ran to catch it. But other crusaders thought these men were fleeing the battlefield, so they began to flee as well. Soon hundreds of men began running in disorganized fashion and the crusader ranks (which – amazingly after several hours of fighting – had remained in rough formation) began to jumble together. Ibn Shaddād, accompanying Saladin on the eastern downslope from the looted camp, could not see the horse, but rather assumed that the crusaders had fled on seeing the advance of the mamluks on the Muslim left wing.77 All day the course of battle had favored the crusaders, but this constellation of events signaled their doom. Their left wing was now fully sandwiched between the Acre garrison troops and Taqī al-Dīn’s men, and their center was either looting the Muslim tents or running away in panic. Saladin seized the opportunity and sent his men towards the disorganized enemy ranks. His left wing engaged, as did those remnants of his center that he had managed to rally back. The looters were caught in the tents and killed, while those running away were caught from behind. As Saladin’s left wing rolled up the center, the remaining crusaders there broke and hurtled back towards Acre, 34\n\nTHE SIEGE BEGINS\n\nwith Muslim riders hot on their heels. To make matters worse, the crusader left wing eventually succumbed to pressure and retired to camp, which allowed the Muslim right wing under Taqī al-Dīn – which, up to this point, had had a terrible day – to turn and hit the center as the second claw of a pincer movement.78 It was a massacre: “The Saracens killed so many that the river ran with blood.”79 The battle had turned and the remaining crusaders fled back towards Acre in a chaotic mass, with their enemies in close pursuit. “On and on went the killing,” and it seems that the Muslim counterattack soon reached the outskirts of the crusader camp and nearly pushed through to its tents. Instead, the Muslims withdrew and eventually retired from the field, perhaps for afternoon prayer. A too-convenient excuse?80 Indeed, the western accounts indicate that they were repulsed. King Guy went to help the marquis, and once the Muslims reached the camp the crusader reserve, under the command of Geoffrey of Lusignan, joined the fight: Despite previous injuries and the rivalry between them, he showed humanity to that undeserving man and rescued him when he was about to perish. The king’s brother, Geoffrey of Lusignan, had taken on responsibility for defending the camp. When he saw that the army was thrown into confusion and that everyone was struggling to get away he hastily left his post and, anxious for his brother’s safety, ran forward to stem the rout. O! Wretched reversal of fortune!81\n\nThis was to be one of Geoffrey’s finest moments. As he drove forward to rescue the stragglers, another portion of the Acre garrison sortied from the city and attacked the now undefended camp. He nonetheless prevailed, simultaneously holding his camp while rescuing many of his defeated comrades, and “that day he had the praise of everyone in camp, for he had done more by his own hand than all the others put together.”82 35\n\nTHE SIEGE OF ACRE, 1189–1191\n\nYet many crusaders still perished, and two of their notable commanders were among them. Andrew of Brienne tried to rally his men by urging them to halt their retreat and stand firm, but in the process he was wounded and fell off his horse. His own brother, Count Erard II, passed him and heard his cries, but rode on, leaving him to die. Richard of Templo praised Andrew, whose “valour had raised him so far above all the French that he was regarded as first among knights, while all the rest contended for second place”; for Ambroise, “never did another such knight die, nor any who came to the rescue of so many.” Erard, on the other hand, was dubbed a coward.83 James of Avesnes, who had guarded the camp beside Geoffrey and evidently charged forward with him, nearly perished when he, too, was unhorsed; luckily, another knight chivalrously gave James his mount and he escaped.84 Perhaps the most notable casualty was Gerard of Ridefort, the Templar master who had commanded in the center ranks alongside Andrew. The Templars had fought well but had pushed too far forward of the other ranks, and they were subsequently caught up in the Muslim counterattack. Gerard’s fellows pleaded with him to retreat, only to be rebuffed: “Never! It would be my shame and scandal for the Templars. I would be said to have saved my life by running away and leaving my fellow-knights to be slaughtered.”85 Gerard was captured and then put to death on the orders of Saladin for duplicity: he had actually been captured at the Battle of Hattin two years previously but had been released after making a vow to abandon the war. His recidivism now cost him his life.86 Several casualty figures are provided in the narrative sources, and although they differ the picture is one of disaster for the Christians. Roger, the parson of Howden, relates that, besides Gerard, there fell eighteen Templar knights, along with forty other knights and a hundred Turcopoles; ‘Imād al-Dīn claims rather more, some 5,000.87 Ibn al-Athīr claims that 10,000 crusaders died in total, and maintains that most of them were knights, not infantry. This was certainly 36\n\nTHE SIEGE BEGINS\n\nnot the case at all.88 Ibn Shaddād’s figures, at least for the crusader casualties, should be considered the most accurate. He claims Muslim clerks spent the next day counting the dead on both sides, and he himself watched the bodies being carried away. One clerk, he wrote, estimated that 7,000 crusaders had fallen, although he himself doubted that number and considered the total somewhat smaller. His story is rather detailed: The sultan ordered a cart to go from Acre to carry the Frankish dead to the bank of the river and throw them in. One of the persons who looked after this business of the cart told me that he took a thread and every time he loaded a corpse he made a knot. The number of dead from the left wing reached 4,100 and a few extra. There remained the dead from the right wing and the centre, whom he did not count, for others dealt with those.89\n\nHis figures for the Muslim casualties, however, are dramatically lower and not to be believed: only 150 dead, including the jurist ‘Īsā’s brother, Z.āhir al-Dīn, and Emir Mujallī ibn Marwan. ‘Īsā himself had been unhorsed but was recovered by several relatives, who also died. The letter from Theobald and Peter claims that, along with Saladin’s son and brother, 500 Muslims were killed on the crusader left flank alone.90 Another Latin source, Roger of Howden, includes 100 of the best Muslim warriors (presumably the heavily armed and armored tawashi), but he also claims that Saladin lost his eldest son, a seneschal, and (incorrectly) his nephew Taqī al-Dīn, who actually died in 1191, and not even at Acre.91 Roger was not present for the battle, but arrived later: he joined Richard the Lionheart and the English and Norman crusaders in Sicily in August 1190. After Acre was taken, he returned to England in August 1191, this time in the company of Philip Augustus.92 One would like better figures for the Muslim dead, especially given the near total success of the crusaders for most of the battle’s 37\n\nTHE SIEGE OF ACRE, 1189–1191\n\nduration. But in any event, if the Arabic numbers of 7,000 to 10,000 crusaders killed in action are anywhere close to accurate, this battle was a massive setback for the besiegers. The losses would have equated to between a quarter and a third of the total army strength. It was not, as Paul Cobb has offered, a stalemate: the crusaders had been crushed.93 In the aftermath of the fighting, Saladin proceeded to clean up the mess and excesses of the event. The stench from the dead was intolerable and was making his men sick. He therefore ordered all the crusader corpses to be thrown into the River Belus. As they floated down the river, both their smell and their hacked, dismembered appearance reached and revolted the crusaders, whose drinking water had now been polluted. The southern edge of the camp was pulled back from the river until the bodies could be buried.94 The Muslims likewise shifted their arrangement. Saladin himself was struck with a recurring colic, for which the smell was blamed, and he was unable to leave his tent. A council was therefore called on 13 October to discuss the next steps. Some argued that an immediate follow-up assault on the enemy camp was necessary. The crusaders had been whittled down, they reasoned, but would receive reinforcements in time, perhaps even before the winter season, but most assuredly in the spring. With few Muslim reserves on the way, the battle had to be now. Other advisers were more reluctant. They fretted that news of the sultan’s illness might reach the crusaders and inspire them to start new assaults. More than that, however, was the general condition of the army. The soldiers had been enrolled for over fifty days and were mentally and physically tired, as were their horses. Since the crusaders were essentially trapped in place, between Acre and Saladin’s men, there was no harm in resting and attacking only when at better strength.95 It was a similar situation to late August, when Saladin had decided to allow the crusaders to encamp at Acre, instead of destroying them on the march; and once again, he elected to delay his attack. His decision on this occasion is perhaps more 38\n\nTHE SIEGE BEGINS\n\nunderstandable, given his serious illness; but once again, the Muslims had deliberately prolonged the siege by not seeking a decisive victory. In the meantime, the sultan sent the qād·ī Ibn Shaddād on a recruiting mission. Word had come that Emperor Frederick Barbarossa had begun his great march towards Syria, bringing with him between 200,000 and 260,000 men. These numbers were greatly inflated, but the specter of another army descending on Acre convinced Saladin that he needed more men. To raise them, he decided to employ the call of jihad. Ibn Shaddād traveled around Saladin’s domains (excluding Egypt) and even visited the Abbasid caliph in Baghdad, Nās.ir al-Dīn (Nās.ir al-Dīn Allāh Abū’l-‘Abbās Ahmad). The qād·ī left Acre on 24 October and did not return until . 12 April 1190. His mission was a stunning success: the jihad persuaded several Muslim lords to bring their armies to Acre in the spring, and they responded by telling Ibn Shaddād, “to hear is to obey.” These included the armies of Sinjār and Jazīrat, led by ‘Imād al-Dīn Zankī (‘Imād al-Dīn Zankī ibn Qut. b al-Dīn Mawdūd ibn Zankī) and his nephew Sanjar Shāh (Mu‘izz al-Dīn Sanjar Shāh ibn Sayf al-Dīn Ghazī ibn Mawdūd bin Zankī, lord of al-Jazīra), respectively. The army of Mosul came too, led not by their lord ‘Izz al-Dīn (‘Izz al-Dīn Mas‘ūd ibn Qut. b al-Dīn Mawdūd), but rather by his son, ‘Alā’ al-Dīn Khurramshāh (‘Alā’ al-Dīn Khurramshāh ibn ‘Izz al-Dīn Mas‘ūd ibn Mawdūd); and so did the army of Irbil.96 Four days after the council, Saladin accompanied his baggage train south to the hills of al-Kharrūba, taking a goodly number of his regular soldiers with him. The advance guard, however, was left in encirclement around the crusader camp, and the Acre garrison was ordered to shut the gates and hold the city firm. There he waited for his brother, al-‘Ādil, who arrived with reserves on 23 October.97 The relationship between Saladin and the jihad has been much discussed.98 Peter Partner has pointed to jihad ’s primary role in the period as serving the Ayyubid themselves, bolstering them as political leaders and legitimizing their dynasty. When Saladin rode among 39\n\nTHE SIEGE OF ACRE, 1189–1191\n\nhis men, “urging them to perform their Jihad duty” and calling out “On, on for Islam!” he was replicating and expanding upon Nūr al-Dīn’s example from the 1160s.99 Islamic writers such as Ibn al-Athīr and the Hanbali jurist Ibn Qudāma al-Maqdisī believed that the holy war had been continuing for some time, indeed since the First Crusade, if not earlier.100 And the topic of jihad, particularly in relationship to the importance of the city of Jerusalem, was a popular constant in Arabic poetry of the period.101 These are all reasonable points. Still, it is clear that Saladin’s declarations of jihad at Acre were concerned with the immediacy of the military situation before him and that he firmly believed he was waging a holy war. Saladin’s behavior at Acre matches the explanation of jihad in the period as offered by Cobb: that it was not militarism per se, but rather “war with a pious intent.”102 In fact, Saladin called for jihad throughout the siege of Acre, not just in optimistic or desperate moments, leading one to believe his sincerity in waging it.103 One overlooked aspect of holy war at Acre is the role it played among the soldiers. The Muslims in Saladin’s army are cast as the jihadi warriors, champions of Islam, and “heroes of the true unitarians.” Such soldiers might be referred to by different terms, such as mujāhidūn (volunteers) or ghuzāh (simply, fighters).104 Two such warriors are identified in particular: Mujāhid al-Dīn Yarunqush from Sinjār and an unnamed man from Mazandaran; the former “loved to fight for the faith” and the latter asked Saladin for permission to join the jihad. Collectively, the soldiers were said to have fought fiercely and they “gave Jihad its due.”105 For Ibn Shaddād, who could expect Saladin himself to read his writings, the soldiers bought into the notion of fighting for God and heeded the sultan’s call to holy war. In his eyes, Allah would save those who endured in the face of trials; accordingly, “those on either side gave their lives to purchase the next world’s peace.”106 His words ring credibly, for one reads in the Eracles that Philip Augustus declared the crusaders had 40\n\nTHE SIEGE BEGINS\n\n“come for the sake of God and for the salvation of our souls.”107 Numerous Christians are singled out for their pious combat, such as a marksman who shot a Muslim defender atop the wall when he attempted to urinate on a crucifix: the “lethal wound transfixed the Turk in the groin.”108 In another instance, a small vessel transporting the knight Ivo of Vipont to Tyre was caught by a Muslim galley off the Levantine coastline. When his companions despaired at being captured and killed, Ivo chastised them for their lack of faith: he leapt aboard the enemy vessel and began decapitating Muslim sailors with an axe. His men followed his lead and soon the galley was taken, for “those who placed their hope in God were given a triumph.”109 God’s rewards awaited faithful soldiers on both sides of the lines.110 Ditches and ramparts In what was surely the understatement of the year, the crusade leaders decided it was “best to refrain from open battle for a while.”111 With their numbers severely depleted, there was little chance of breaking through either Saladin’s lines or Acre’s walls. The campaign had suffered a major setback, and much hand-wringing and rethinking needed to take place. However, the sultan’s withdrawal to al-Kharrūba and the resulting expansion of the Muslim encirclement gave them some encouragement and room to breathe, although they continued to face daily attacks from the advance guard. While Saladin convalesced in the south, the first pieces of his eventual defeat in the north could be put in place. The break was a godsend in two respects. First, reinforcements arrived by sea toward the end of October, fulfilling the fears of Saladin’s advisers. Because the crusader ships still held Acre’s natural harbor (outside the mole), the ingress and egress of western vessels would be possible until the winter winds set in. The newly arrived magnates and prelates included the count of Ferrers, Guy of Dampierre, and Adelardo, bishop of Verona, along with numerous 41\n\nTHE SIEGE OF ACRE, 1189–1191\n\nother barons and 400 Danish warriors accompanying a nephew of the Danish king Canute VI.112 Roger of Howden claims that 500 knights and 10,000 men arrived at Acre. No other source offers such large numbers, and events subsequent to these landings do not suggest an infusion of so many new troops. Howden, then, was probably conflating the landings of October with those back in September. He does provide an interesting anecdote about the ships, however: while some vessels returned to Italy (Apulia), those carrying Danes and Germans remained at Acre, where they were disassembled and used as firewood and building materials by the crusaders, who had been cut off from the wooded areas east of the Toron.113 Second, the pause in major action allowed the crusaders to properly fortify their camp. They began to dig protective ditches on both sides of their tents: one to protect them from Saladin’s men and the other to forestall sorties from the Acre garrison.114 The ditches were filled with sharp pieces of wood and metal, some from broken shields, and they ran from the bay all the way to the Mediterranean. These trenches were then fronted by earthen ramparts and, in some places, wooden palisades. The former slowed Muslim cavalry attacks by forcing them to ride up, and the latter offered protection for western crossbowmen shooting at them. An interesting detail is offered in the Chronica of Otto, abbot of St Blasien in the Black Forest. Although his account of affairs in the East continues to 1197, he was not a participant on the crusade and he was evidently uninterested in events at Acre, to which he devotes only four paragraphs. Here, however, he claims that gates were installed in the palisades on either side of the camp, which allowed crusader sorties against both the city and Saladin, when desired.115 All of the crusaders dedicated themselves to the huge task, taking shifts in which one group would dig while the other guarded the laborers from Muslim attacks. The frustration of the Muslims was palpable: despite showers of arrows and multiple charges at the crusader lines, they were unable to break through, much less lure the workers away from their task. Once the 42\n\nTHE SIEGE BEGINS\n\ndefenses were complete, the crusader artillery was brought fully behind the perimeter, where it could lob projectiles at Acre at will.116 These camp fortifications had three major effects. First, the ditch in front of Acre encircled the city and cut it off, once again, from Saladin’s forces. At those times when crusader ships were actually able to control the harbor, the garrison had no way of getting supplies in or out. Compounding this problem was the issue of water: the Lyon Eracles reports that the crusaders diverted the flow of the River Belus away from the city, denying fresh water to the people there.117 Second, the Acre ditch prevented easy sorties from the garrison and allowed the crusaders to prepare, coordinate, and launch new attacks against the city walls. This included not only projectiles shot from the artillery, but scaling attempts by Conrad of Montferrat’s men and the Hospitallers.118 Third, the outward ditch and rampart prevented penetration by Saladin’s cavalry. Although his advance guard continued to harry the defenders with daily attacks and periodic skirmishing, large-scale attempts to gain entry into the camp were now stymied by the defenses and the men guarding them. There would be no repeat of Taqī al-Dīn’s success in September. As a result, the sultan had no practical way to actively disengage the crusaders from their siege. He would have to settle for a continued encirclement of their position, attempts to cut off their supplies by seizing the harbor, or perhaps drawing their armies outside of the fortifications with harassment tactics or feigned retr"
