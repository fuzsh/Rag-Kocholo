        "text": "The Battle of Hattin (Arabic: معركة حطين‎) took place on 4 July 1187, between the Crusader states of the Levant and the forces of the Ayyubid sultan Salah ad-Din, known in the West as Saladin. It is also known as the Battle of the Horns of Hattin, due to the shape of a nearby extinct volcano.\n\nThe Muslim armies under Saladin captured or killed the vast majority of the Crusader forces, removing their capability to wage war. As a direct result of the battle, Muslims once again became the eminent military power in the Holy Land, re-conquering Jerusalem and most of the other Crusader-held cities. These Christian defeats prompted the Third Crusade, which began two years after the Battle of Hattin.\n\nRelated Suggestions\n\nAnti-semitism: Israel's Narrative of Endless Cycle of War\n\n'Terrorist Organization'?
