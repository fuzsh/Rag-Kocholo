        "text": "Perhaps the Christian army could have avoided battle as they did in 1183 and Saladin would have been obliged to disolve his army again, as it happened in the mentioned year. Perhaps this tactic could have worked once, twice, but in the end Saladin would have found the way to oblige them to fight a battle.\n\nThe Kingdom of Jerusalem was short of almost eerything, and the European poers were to busy fighthing each other to help it to survive, so, in the long run, it was just a question of time until the Kingdom was defeated, I think\n\nI agree that in the long run, the Kingdom was doomed, but battles are by nature uncertain affairs. I don'tv think the Crusaders had any chance of winning Hattin, but if the battle had not been held at Hattin things might have gone differently. The Franks had a way of winning battles by doing the unexpected, and if competently led they could have given Saladin's army a bad bloody nose. Which might sound the death knell to Ayyubid dominance. That was the weakness of most Islamic rulers at the time - they headed uneasy coalitions depending on victory and charisma. Saladin had bags of it, but there are limits to everything.\n\nAnd imagine he was killed\n\nWhich brings us to the next set of questions: Who replaces the Ayyubids in Egypt at this date? What are the chances of the Crusaders helping along each and every factional struggle among their enemies (not likely, given the average quality of government in Jerusalem)? And will whoever comes next decide that the chivalrous approach doesn't work and stage a replay of 1099?\n\nThe Kingdom of Jerusalem was short of almost eerything,\n\nI am not sure what the Kingdom of Jerusalem was short of. It plainly had plentiful wealth due to very dense castle construction. It also had plentiful manpower, as witnessed by Guy De Lusignan's ability to besiege Acre very soon after the defeat at Hattin, despite the fact that a large force was in Tyre.\n\nWozza said:\n\nThe Kingdom of Jerusalem was short of almost eerything,\n\nI am not sure what the Kingdom of Jerusalem was short of.

It also had plentiful manpower, as witnessed by Guy De Lusignan's ability to besiege Acre very soon after the defeat at Hattin, despite the fact that a large force was in Tyre.\n\nLet me remind you that, once the main Crhistian army was destroyed at Hattin, Saladin conquered almost all the reign without having to fight a single battle or siege, as all the garrisons were used to made up the army. For instnace, Jerusalem was garrisoned but just two knights, as the the of the troops were with Guy. Runciman in his book \"The kingdom of Jerusalem\" (vol 2 of his History of the Crusades) goes over this and proves that the Latin inhabitants -and by extension the army- was never enough to colonize the country."
