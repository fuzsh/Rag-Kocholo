    "text": "On the evening of November 22, 1909, a young woman named Clara Lemlich rose to address the crowd assembled in the Great Hall of New York City’s Cooper Union.\n\nThe event was a meeting to consider a general strike among the city’s garment workers, predominantly Jewish immigrants, to protest poor working conditions across the industry. Lemlich, like many in the crowd that night, had listened intently to a succession of male labor leaders giving speeches. Tired of all-male leadership and hours of speeches that fell short on action—and still sporting the bruises of a recent beating she’d received at a smaller strike—Clara Lemlich climbed onto the platform and began to speak in Yiddish: “I am a working girl, one of those who are on strike against intolerable conditions… I offer a resolution that a general strike be declared now.” Her straightforward words ignited the crowd, and by the next day, a mass strike among the city’s shirtwaist makers as well. Known as the Uprising of 20,000External, this historic months-long strike involved as many as thirty thousand workers, affected more than 350 garment factories, and earned employees such concessions as a 52-hour work week, four paid holidays a year, and no fees for work-related materials. As importantly, it created new recognition of women’s work and new respect for women’s role within the labor movement.\n\nBorn in Gorodok in present-day Ukraine, Clara Lemlich emigrated with her family to New York City as a teenager: Ellis Island Records, where the family’s name is listed as Lumback, show them arriving in December of 1904. Rising antisemitic violence in Eastern Europe led to a mass wave of Jewish immigration to America, starting as early as 1880, peaking around 1907, and effectively ending with the Immigration Act of 1924. In the Lemlich family’s case, the widely-publicized pogrom at Kishinev, where dozens of Jews were brutally killed by an angry mob while authorities stood by, persuaded them to journey to America.\n\nUpon arriving in New York, Lemlich quickly found work in the garment industry. In the 1910 U.S. Census she is listed as a draper, a job that involved skilled work fitting fabric to a dress form. At the time, the garment industry was the largest employer of Jewish immigrant workers in New York City, divided by trade into dressmakers, cloakmakers, garment cutters, and the like. Shirtwaists, such as those that Lemlich made, were the fashionable women’s blouses of their day, which also came to signal the rise of women in the workforce. Most garment workers were employed in small factories on the Lower East Side that were operated by middle men in what was originally called the “sweating system”—from which the term sweatshopExternal derives. Long hours and poor working conditions were the norm.\n\nLemlich’s own union involvement began soon after her arrival. Poor working conditions and low pay in the sweatshops led her to join the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, or ILGWU, where she was elected to the executive board of Local 25, and soon led a number of strikes. Her intellect, strong spirit, and wit quickly paved the way for Lemlich to rise in the ranks of the union. By 1909, she was known to many female workers in the ILGWU, but male labor leaders such as Samuel Gompers were not familiar with Lemlich until after her fateful speech at the Cooper Union meeting.\n\nThe tragic Triangle Shirtwaist Company factory fire of March 25, 1911, brought the issues of workplace reform in sweatshops to public attention. When fire broke out on the ninth floor of the Asch Building near Washington Square, workers found locked doors, inadequate fire escapes, and fire fighting equipment that couldn’t reach high enough to help them. Many perished from the flames, or from their desperate decision to jump from the windows. The owners of the factory, Max Blanck and Isaac Harris, had refused to accept the strike terms presented by the unions in 1909-10. Had they accepted the terms, 146 lives might have been saved. The cruel and unnecessary loss of life further fueled the fight for fair and safe working conditions in the garment industry, which set the stage for the rise and longevity of the ILGWU through much of the twentieth century.\n\nAs years passed and garment manufacturers moved overseas, the ILGWU merged with other unions, forming UNITE in 1995 and finally UNITE HERE in 2004. The ILGWU PapersExternal are now housed at Cornell University’s Kheel CenterExternal, School of Industrial and Labors Relations.\n\nClara Lemlich, later Lemlich Shavelson, continued as a committed activist and organizer across a variety of causes, including the high cost of rent for working class families. In the 1930s she organized a meat boycottExternal that led to lower prices in New York, and spread to other cities as well. Among the groups she helped to found was the United Council of Working-Class Women, later the Progressive Women’s Council. She spoke out against nuclear weapons, attending conventions in Paris and Washington, D.C. In her last years, while living at a home for the aged in Los Angeles, she is said to have organized a union for the nurses and orderlies who cared for her. Clara Lemlich Shavelson died in 1982, age 96."
