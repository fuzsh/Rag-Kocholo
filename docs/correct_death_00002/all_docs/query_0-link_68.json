    "text": "2.1. Direct impulse effect of projectile-target collision\n\nIn the Zapruder Film President Kennedy is seen to react to three separate gunshots, the first missing him and the limo [6], [16], [4], [17], the next two hitting him with increasing accuracy. Further discussion of the first two shots is beyond the scope of this paper other than to note that all three gunshots had associated 1–2 frame anomalous movements, and a outward impulse is observed on the jacket lapel of Texas Governor John Connally (who had accompanied President and Mrs. Kennedy in the motorcade and was collaterally wounded in chest) at the same time the President begins showing signs of being injured [12], [6], [7], but no other discernable impulses are otherwise seen on either of the two men (prior to the third shot).\n\nshows the two Zapruder Film frames that captured the fatal shot, namely Z312 (the moment just before impact) and Z313 (the moment just following impact). In Z313 the catastrophic effect of the energy deposit from a supersonic projectile passing through a human head is clearly evident. However, while it is not immediately noticeable at this scale (and not detectable while viewed in motion at normal speed), a careful comparison between the two frames also reveals that President Kennedy's head snaps forward from Z312 to Z313 [9, pp. 87–89], as referenced to the red dashed line labeled O. There is nothing new in this observation—early researchers with access to the still frames first noticed this in the mid-to-late 1960s. Notable among these is author Josiah Thompson, who estimated the position of the President's head relative to two fixed objects on the rear of the limousine, the results of which are plotted in his book Six Seconds in Dallas (1967) [9, p. 91] that will be returned to in Section 2.2. However, for the moment it should be noted that this motion amounts to an anomalous forward impulse on the order of several centimeters over the time interval of one Zapruder frame (≈0.055 s) at the moment of impact (an impulse comparable to Connally's “lapel flap”). It is also crucial to note that this anomalous forward impulse at Z313 is only observed on Kennedy's head—it is not observed on any of the other limo occupants (with reference to dotted lines c, d and f), nor is it even observed on Kennedy's own torso (line b), wherein lies his body's center-of-mass (CM). This implies that an isolated real force acted directly (and solely) upon the President's head just prior to Z313; the only plausible source for this instantaneous, isolated forcing mechanism is manifestly and unequivocally the projectile impact. Therefore, what follows in Sections 2.1.1–2.1.4 is an examination of the relevant dynamics involved in the direct interaction [18] of a high-speed projectile with a human head.\n\n2.1.1. Model The interaction of a firearm projectile passing through a human body target constitutes an inelastic collision, that is, one where the kinetic energy (KE) of the two-body bullet-target system is not conserved (e.g., in the case of a ballistic pendulum). This concept will be returned to in Section 2.2, but it is noted here that such an interaction nevertheless may not be perfectly inelastic, because the bullet mass passes rapidly through the target rather than merging with it (at least in the case of a high powered military rifle). Because such collisions are neither elastic nor perfectly inelastic, the physical description of the interaction can be more complicated. Nevertheless, assuming in the case under consideration that the projectile collision occurred near the center of the target (thus not imparting torque), it is possible to consider the interaction in terms of a linear impulse, J x , which in one dimension for the CM frame is given as [e.g., 19, p. 211] J x ≡ ∫ 0 t F x d t ′ = M Δ V x ( t ) , (1) where t is time, F x is the scalar force along the x direction of the projectile (bullet) motion, M ≡ m P + m T is the combined mass of the system ( m P and m T being the projectile and target masses, respectively), and Δ V x is the finite change in velocity of the CM. In this case one may assume that m P ≪ m T for simplicity; thus M ≈ m T (i.e., the mass of the human head). Equation (1) applies to the bullet passage through an entire head, but this may be broken down into three separate impulses brought on by (1) the skull entrance, (2) passage through the skull cavity (i.e., through the brain), and (3) skull exit. For simplicity, any resistance presented by the hair and scalp is assumed to be of second order and thus negligible [e.g., 20]. Equation (1) is therefore rewritten as M Δ V x ( t 3 ) = ∫ t 0 t 1 F 1 d t ′ ︸ skull entrance + ∫ t 1 t 2 F 2 d t ′ ︸ skull cavity ( brain ) + ∫ t 2 t 3 F 3 d t ′ ︸ skull exit , (2) where t 1 , t 2 , t 3 are the times at which the bullet exits each medium relative to the entrance time at t 0 . From Eq. (2) it is seen that the problem may be treated by considering separately the collisions of the projectile with a rigid, inelastic skull (both entrance and exit) along with the passage through brain tissue (which may be considered a visco-elastic fluid). It is noted that the projectile was fired from the TSBD on a small downward trajectory ( ≈ 16 ∘ elevation angle) [21, p. 34], and there was a slight downward inclination of Elm Street ( ≈ 3 ∘ or 5% grade) [21, p. 55], with the President's head tilted at a comparable angle slightly down and to his left. Skull impacts Attention is first given to the terms involving passage through bone, namely the first and last terms on the right side of Eq. (2). Sturdivan and Bexon [20] derived a model describing the probability of penetration of human skulls by high-speed projectiles (viz., bullets) for military applications based on the empirical observation that such projectiles “punch out” a conical section of skull, a phenomenon known as the beveling or cratering effect [22], [12], [16]. The cratering effect arises from the cross-sectional anatomy of the human skull bone, which consists of inner and outer layers (called “tables” or “laminae”) of hard cortical bone surrounding an internal layer of less-dense “spongy” trabecular (or “cancellous”) bone [23], [24], [20]. As explained by Sturdivan [20], [16], when a high-speed projectile impacts the head and penetrates the skull, it first perforates a hole in the outer table of approximately the same diameter of its own presented area. However, as the bullet breaks through into the inner, less-dense trabecular layer, the area expands roughly in a cone shape until it finally breaks out a wider hole through the inner table. It is this cratering process that assists forensic pathologists in establishing skull entrance or exit wounds [25], [22], thus facilitating the determination of the direction of the bullet's passage relative to the body and the direction of origin of the shot. Building upon the skull-cratering model described above [20], the impulse force is modeled in the current paper by assuming a perfectly inelastic collision [26, pp. 59–60, 150] between the projectile (Body 1) and the conical section (or “bone plug”) it breaks loose from the skull (Body 2). The interaction of the two bodies during collision according to Newton's Second and Third Laws is given by F x = − m 1 x ¨ 1 , projectile ( bullet ) (3) F x = m 2 x ¨ 2 + F σ , bone plug (4) where m 1 and m 2 are the masses of the bullet ( m P ) and bone plug, respectively, and F σ denotes the initial force required to break the conical section loose from the skull, noting that Eq. (4) implicitly assumes | F σ | ≤ | F x | = m 1 x ¨ . F σ can be estimated from F σ ≈ σ u A , (5) where A is the presented area of the projectile and σ u is the ultimate strength3 of the bone [29], [30], [31], here specifically the cortical table first impacted by the projectile. Solution of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) (3) and (4) is easily obtained by first recasting them as F x d t = − m 1 d v 1 , ( F x − F σ ) d t = m 2 d v 2 , where v 1 ≡ x ˙ 1 , v 2 ≡ x ˙ 2 as usual. Assuming perfect inelasticity, both bodies are deformed and “stick” together immediately after breakage at time t, acquiring a final combined CM velocity4 [26, p. 150] of V. Integrating from entrance time t ′ = 0 to t yields ∫ 0 t F x d t ′ = − m 1 ∫ v 1 V d v 1 ′ ⟹ J x = − m 1 ( V − v 1 ) , (6) ∫ 0 t ( F x − F σ ) d t ′ = m 2 ∫ v 2 V d v 2 ′ ⟹ J x = J σ + m 2 ( V − v 2 ) . (7) The impulse caused by the force of the bone breakage, J σ , is calculated as J σ ≡ F σ δ t ≈ F σ δ L v 1 , (8) where δ L is the absolute shortening of bone at failure (occurring when the compressive ultimate strength σ u is surpassed). δ L may be estimated from the relative shortening (or engineering strain) at bone failure, E , defined as [28] E ≡ δ L L , (9) where L is the bone thickness. Values of both σ u and E for cortical bone have been variously experimentally determined in the literature which will be returned to in Section 2.1.3. Combining Eqs. (6) and (7) and solving for V yields the reduced velocity of the bullet (and merged bone plug) after punching through the skull V = m 1 v 1 + m 2 v 2 − J σ m 1 + m 2 . (10) Finally, substituting Eq. (10) into either (6) or (7) and solving for J x , one arrives at the expression for the impulse imposed by the bullet upon the skull during passage J x = m 1 m 2 m 1 + m 2 ( v 1 − v 2 ) + m 1 m 1 + m 2 J σ . (11) Equations (11) and (8) form the basis for calculating the first and third terms of Eq. (2). The mass of the dislodged bone plug is given by m 2 = ρ s V c , where ρ s is the density of skull bone and V c is the volume of the crater, which is modeled to be a conical frustum [20] and thus given by [32, p. 401] V c = π δ L 1 3 ( r c 2 + r 0 2 + r 0 r c ) , (12) where r 0 and r c are the radii of the crater entrance and exit holes, respectively, with the latter given by [20] r c = r 0 + δ L tan ⁡ ( ψ ) , (13) ψ being the half-angle of the truncated cone, which is nominally taken to be ψ ≈ 30 ∘ [20]. Note that if | F x | ≈ | F σ | (i.e., the force of the projectile collision is close to the bone ultimate strength), it is easily shown that (10) and (11) respectively reduce to V = v 2 (i.e., the bone plug is not moved beyond its initial speed before impact) and | J x | = m 1 ( v 1 − v 2 ) ≡ p 1 , where p 1 is the momentum of the projectile. In this case, the collision would then be a perfectly inelastic collision, and the total incoming momentum of the projectile p 1 would be completely transferred to the skull and head. According to the above model, a projectile impulse J x will surpass the bone's ultimate strength and thus fracture the bone (although not necessarily perforating it) when J x − J σ ≥ 0 , that is J x − J σ = m 1 m 2 m 1 + m 2 ( v 1 − v 2 ) − m 2 m 1 + m 2 J σ ≥ 0 , (14) where J σ can be estimated from Eq. (8); collision thresholds for bone fracture, given various projectile and bone parameters (i.e., projectile mass or speed, m 1 or v 1 , given target parameters m 2 , v 2 and J σ ), may thus be estimated by finding the corresponding zeros of Eq. (14). Soft tissue passage (skull cavity) Using dimensional analysis, Sturdivan [33] derived a drag law for the passage of a spherical projectile through tissue as a combination of an inertial term and a viscous (friction) term F d = C i ρ A v 2 ︷ inertial term + C v μ b A v ︷ viscous term , (15) where F d is the interaction drag force, C i is the inertial drag coefficient, C v is the viscous drag coefficient, μ is the viscosity of tissue (in g / cm 2 ), b is the thickness of the viscous boundary layer, ρ is the tissue density, and A is the cross-sectional area presented by the projectile. A more recent drag-law equation valid for a full range of projectile speeds ( 0 – 2000 m / s ) has been advanced by Peters [34] and features a tissue-strength term in place of a viscous term F d = 1 2 C d ( v ) ρ A v 2 ︷ inertial term + C d ( v ) A R ︷ tissue damage term , (16) where C d ( v ) is a velocity-dependent drag coefficient and R is the “rupture modulus” of the target medium defined as R ≡ 1 2 ρ v U 3 , where U is the “characteristic velocity” of the tissue in question defined by [34] U ≡ U 6 ( d d 6 ) − 1 3 , subscripts “6” denoting reference values obtained for a projectile diameter of 6 mm (thus, d 6 ≡ 0.6 cm). The tissue-strength term in Eq. (16) becomes more important for lower projectile speeds v [34], [16]. Applying Newton's Second Law, and assuming A, C i , C v , μ and b are constants, Eq. (15) has the solution [33], [35] v ( δ x ) = ( v 0 + C v μ b C i ρ ) exp ⁡ ( − C i A ρ m δ x ) − C v μ b C i ρ , (17) where v 0 is the initial velocity and δx is the tissue penetration depth. Similarly, for Eq. (16), given projectile impact speeds below 0.7 times the speed of sound in the target medium (i.e., v ≲ 1100 m / s , this being the case for the Carcano bullet), C d is taken to be constant and (16) is solved as [34] v ( δ x ) = v 0 [ 1 + ( a U v 0 ) 2 ] exp ⁡ ( − C r A ρ m δ x ) − ( a U v 0 ) 2 , (18) where C r is a “reference drag coefficient” and a is a projectile nose-shape parameter that ranges between ≈1.2–1.9. Equations (17) and (18) were both obtained assuming a constant presented area A over the projectile's trajectory through the medium, δx. However, it is known in practice that a high-speed projectile will undergo deformation from collisions with bone [36], [37], [16], [14], [38], as well as during subsequent passage through soft tissue [16], [38]. This was certainly the case for the Kennedy assassination, as evidenced by the badly deformed bullet fragments recovered from the limousine and autopsy, and will be addressed further in Section 2.1.3.\n\n2.1.2. Projectile retardation in air For the bullet velocity at impact, v 1 , the retardation of the projectile through the intervening atmosphere must be taken into account. For simplicity this may be taken to be the experimentally measured mean value v 1 ≈ 557 m / s ( 55 , 700 cm / s ) [16]. However, to corroborate the measured value, and to facilitate application of the model to an arbitrary source (sniper) location and projectile, the theoretical modeling study in this paper is extended here to include calculations accounting for the projectile passage through the ambient atmosphere of the crime scene. The bullet impact velocity at the target location may be estimated theoretically by accounting for aerodynamic drag. The one-dimensional aerodynamic drag force is given by [e.g., [19], [16]] F d = 1 2 C d A ρ a v 2 , (19) where v ≡ x ˙ is the speed of the projectile, A is the presented area of the projectile, ρ a is the mean density of the ambient air, and C d is the aerodynamic drag coefficient. The equation of motion for the projectile may thus be written as 1 2 C d A ρ a v 2 = − m v ˙ , (20) where m is the projectile mass. Assuming C d , A and ρ a are constants along the projectile path, ODE (20) is easily solved for v as a function of distance traveled, x, by separating variables and integrating 1 2 C d A ρ a ∫ 0 x d x ′ = − m ∫ v 0 v 1 v d v ′ ⟹ v ( x ) = v 0 exp ⁡ ( − 1 2 C d A ρ a m x ) , (21) where v 0 is the initial speed of the projectile at x = 0 , in this case the Carcano bullet muzzle velocity. Values for the crime scene parameters may be found in the literature [16, p. 267], namely x = 81 m (8100 cm), and for the Carcano rifle bullet (used in the assassination), v 0 ≈ 658 m / s ( 65 , 800 cm / s ) and m ≈ 10.5 g. Although C d varies with the Mach and Reynolds numbers (Ma and Re, respectively) [39], [16], [40], for the projectile shape (assumed to be spherical) and speed ( 658 m / s ) under consideration, Ma ≈ 1.9 ∧ Re ≈ 2.9 × 10 5 , and thus C d ≈ 1.0 [39], [16]. Although the influence of departures of the ambient atmospheric temperature, humidity and wind from a mean state are small [41], the projectile's KE is proportional to the square of its speed. Thus, given the availability of atmospheric surface data, the ambient air density, ρ a , may be explicitly calculated from the formula [42, p. 52] ρ a = p R d T v , (22) where R d is the gas constant for dry air, p is the atmospheric pressure (conventionally reported in hPa), and T v is the virtual temperature, defined as the dry air equivalent temperature pertaining to the density of moist air at the same pressure [43, p. 7]. T v is calculated as [42, p. 72] T v ≡ T ( 1 + 0.61 q ) , where T is the air temperature (K) and q is the water vapor mass mixing ratio (typically expressed as grams H 2 O per kilogram dry air, denoted g / kg ), which may be computed from the dew point temperature [e.g., 44]. Hourly meteorological surface observations at Dallas Love Field from the U.S. Weather Bureau (the predecessor of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA) were obtained from the NOAA National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service, National Climatic Data Center [45] and given in . Table 1 Time (CST) p (hPa) T (∘C) T d (∘C) q ( g / kg )† Wind speed, u ( m / s ) direction‡, ϕ 12:00 1011.5 17.2 10.6 7.9 6.7 248∘ 13:00 1010.5 19.4 6.1 5.8 8.8 293∘ Open in a separate window Source: NOAA/NESDIS/NCDC [45] Because the surface observations were taken at 12:00 and 13:00 Central Standard Time (CST), the values for 12:30 CST (the precise time of the assassination) are obtained simply by taking the means, yielding p ¯ = 1011.0 hPa, T ‾ = 18.3 ∘ C and q ¯ = 6.8 g / kg . From these values and Eq. (22), the mean air density for Dallas, Texas at 12:30, 22 November 1963, is calculated to be ρ a = 0.001204 g / cm 3 . Windspeed and direction were included in because they factor into the aerodynamic drag calculations (19) and (21) by altering the bullet velocity relative to the fluid. From these, the mean windspeed and direction are calculated to be u ¯ = 7.75 m / s ( 775 cm / s ) and ϕ ¯ = 270.5 ∘ , respectively. It can be seen that winds were out of the west, which was obliquely against the direction of the bullet trajectory,5 thus increasing the relative speed and drag. Thus, taking into account the mean headwind, the relative speed of the bullet through the fluid (air) may be estimated as v 0 ′ = v 0 + u ¯ cos ⁡ ( δ ϕ ) , where δϕ is the relative azimuth angle of the wind direction with respect to the bullet trajectory, which can be visually estimated from to be δ ϕ ≈ 60 ∘ . Substituting into Eq. (21) and subtracting the relative wind leaves the reduced bullet speed relative to the ground at impact v ( x ) = v 0 ′ exp ⁡ ( − 1 2 C d A ρ a m x ) − u ¯ cos ⁡ ( δ ϕ ) , (23) which is calculated to be v ( x ) ≈ 558 m / s ( 55 , 800 cm / s ), this independently being within 0.2% of the mean measured value of 557 m / s ( 55 , 700 cm / s ) used for impulse calculations in Section 2.1.3."
