        "text": "This grim picture is an overhead view of Dealey Plaza, in the heart of downtown Dallas. It was here, on 22 November 1963, that Lee Harvey Oswald, a disaffected ex-marine marksman with communist sympathies, assassinated John Fitzgerald Kennedy, President of The United States of America.\n\nThe ghouls amongst you will want some gory detail. Very well. You shall have it.\n\nYou can trace the route of the Presidential motorcade on the picture above. It is marked in blue, and the direction of travel is from top to bottom of the picture. Oswald is waiting in a room on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository, overlooking Elm Street.\n\nThe clock on the Wall of the Book Depository is showing 12.30 local time when the leading car, carrying The President, The First Lady, Governor of Texas John Connally and his wife turns off Main Street into Dealey Plaza. The picture on your left shows them some 30 seconds later, just before making the turn into Elm Street itself.\n\nAnother 30 seconds, and the car is just above the'm' in 'Elm Street', when Oswald fires three shots in rapid succession. Two strike The President, one in the upper back, one in the head. The bullet pictured below hits Kennedy in the back of the head, emerges through the side of his head and continues on through the back, chest, right wrist and left thigh of Governor Connally. The wounded are rushed to hospital, but the surgeons can do nothing to save The President, and he is pronounced dead exactly 30 minutes later.\n\n...officially.\n\nAt least, that is what happened according to the report of The Warren Commission, the body set up under Earl Warren, Chief Justice of the United States, to investigate the killing. But American citizens always lean to thoughts of conspiracy, and according to a recent survey, fewer than 20% of them believe in the single-lone-nutter account. Indeed, a brief survey of the web will reveal upwards of 3,000,000 sites devoted to various competing conspiracy theories.\n\nWas the mob involved? Did J.Edgar Hoover, head of the FBI, arrange the killing? Was there a backup assassination squad in case Oswald failed? How could a single bullet cause four separate wounds? How could anyone fire three shots in 5 seconds? Were there also killers positioned on the grassy knoll? On the roadside above the triple underpass? Who was the man with the umbrella, and why did he vanish? How come all those who gave eye-witness testimony to The Warren Commission were dead within ten years? And so on. And so forth.\n\nBut you and I, of course, are above all that. We are, after all, philosophers, people of high mind and noble ideals....\n\nSo why are we reading all this?\n\nBecause there is another group of people interested in the events of that day. There are several hundred of them, and they are logicians, grammarians, philosophers of logic and language, with a very specialised interest: the semantics of the English word 'if..'.\n\nEveryone working in the area is familiar with the name of Oswald and the competing explanations of the assassination, for - purely by accident - professional interest has converged on just three sentences, given iconic status by logician Ernest Adams. Here they are, in glorious technicolor:\n\n[A] If Oswald didn't shoot Kennedy, then somebody else did.\n\n[B] If Oswald doesn't shoot Kennedy, then somebody else will.\n\n[C] If Oswald hadn't shot Kennedy, then somebody else would have.\n\nWhere clearly, [B] encodes a remark made before the event, and [A] and [C] encode remarks made after the event.\n\nAnd what is currently exercising the minds of the academics is something apparently trivial - a mere point of classification. Should [B] be classified along with [A], or does it really belong with [C]?\n\nI suggest you pause for a while, and work out your own response. Think first of all just of the sentences. Does [B] belong with [A] on purely grammatical grounds? Or is it grammatically more akin to [C]? And then reflect upon the messages which these sentences encode. Their meanings, as we might say. Is [B]'s message parallel to that of [A], or is it closer to the message encoded by [C]?\n\nGive it a good five minutes, and commit yourself to a view before you click on the answer.\n\nWhy does that matter?\n\nApparently trivial, I said. But only apparently. It happens often in Philosophy that great battles are lost and won over some seemingly insignificant point of detail. And here we have a paradigm case. The stakes are high, for a whole Philosophy turns upon the proper understanding of the Oswald sentences. Not just an improved understanding of 'if..', though that will be nice, but much more, including (at least) our understanding of\n\n...how to properly pursue the very discipline of semantics\n\n...how language relates to logic, epistemology and metaphysics\n\n...how our minds stand in relation to time\n\n...what differentiates us from the other animals.\n\nIn short, a Theory of Human Nature.\n\nThese are large claims. To see them demonstrated, sign up for\n\nThe Revolutionary...IF\n\nFor true ghouls\n\nFor true ghouls , of course, this level of macabre detail will be nowhere near enough. They will wish to visit sites with streaming videos of the very moment. To see the head slump forward under the impact. To see the blood fly. Here is one such site. Watch, if you must, the home video shot by Abraham Zapruder. I hope you enjoy it.\n\nAnd now, back to the main story.\n\nThe answer...\n\nIf you decided that [B] belongs with [C], you are on the side of the angels. Please come along to The Revolutionary...IF and join The Revolution.\n\nAnd if not, come along anyway. Correct Revolutionary Thinking will be explained over the eight weeks.\n\nClick on the flag to return to the main body of the text.\n\nLee Harvey Oswald\n\nThe Dallas Police Department mug-shot of Oswald, taken when he was brought into custody 90 minutes after the shooting.\n\nClick on the image to return to the main story.\n\nJohn Fitzgerald Kennedy\n\nPresident Kennedy three months before the assassination.\n\nClick on the picture to return to the main story."
