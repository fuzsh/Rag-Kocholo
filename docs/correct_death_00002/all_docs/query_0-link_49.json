    "text": "“A child miseducated is a child lost.”\n\n— John F. Kennedy\n\nThroughout my life I’ve made it a point to visit places of historical significance when I’m near them, to educate myself about those venues and what took place there.\n\nWhether it be Griffin’s Wharf or Paul Revere’s house in Boston, the Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona, the Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia, the George Floyd Memorial in Minnesota, the Brooklyn Bridge in New York, the Vietnam Memorial in Washington D.C. or Wrigley Field in Chicago, I always take a moment to take in the history of the venue and let it all soak in.\n\nOne of the most haunting and educational places of historical significance I ever visited was in 2019 when I visited 411 Elm Street in Dallas, Texas.\n\nYes, one of the biggest nightmares in United States history actually took place on Elm Street — 60 years ago today. That’s when John F. Kennedy, the 35th President of the United States, was shot and killed at the age of young age of 46.\n\nKennedy’s death, followed two days later by the death of his alleged shooter Lee Harvey Oswald on live television by local nightclub owner Jack Ruby is something I have no recollection of. My parents hadn’t even met yet and I wouldn’t be born for another 14 years.\n\nBut for some reason, like a seagull at Oracle Park in the ninth inning, I was drawn to this location. I had to visit the site — even if it was tragic — and learn more about the horrible day in history. So in 2019 I decided while visiting the Texas Rangers’ old Ballpark at Arlington (I visit as many Major League Baseball ballparks/stadiums as I can) I decided to make the half-hour trip to Dallas.\n\nI’m not sure why I made the trip to educate myself on this horrible event, but I guess I understood. After all, it doesn’t seem like you’re officially a Times-Herald reporter until you get at least one email (thankfully they’re not letters anymore) telling me who the Zodiac killer was. I still get a few emails each year from someone telling me they know who it was.\n\nThe first stop on my Dallas trip was The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza. Although I wasn’t sure what the experience would be like, I purchased my tickets and headed up to the sixth floor.\n\nThe museum itself is tasteful. Instead of having a large portion focused on the history of Kennedy’s death, it instead educates visitors about his life.\n\nAs you enter the sixth floor, the museum educates the visitor on Kennedy’s 1960 campaign, concluding with his historic, narrow defeat of Richard Nixon. Other big topics include how he handled the Bay of Pigs fiasco in 1961 and the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.\n\nOther walls in the museum are dedicated to Kennedy’s involvement with the Civil Rights movement and the Space Race and his goal to get someone on the moon by the end of the 1960s.\n\nBut the museum — and the area — have its share of tragedy. There is no escaping the fact that this area is haunted by death.\n\nThere are pictures of Kennedy in the motorcade, with him waving to the fans from the 1961 Lincoln Continental he was in with his wife, Jacqueline Kennedy.\n\nThen there is the room at the corner of the sixth floor where Oswald allegedly shot Kennedy from. Visitors cannot enter the room, which is still taped off, looking exactly as it did 60 years ago. As I gazed into the room I heard the speaker on my headphones ask the question: Is this the biggest and most famous closed off crime scene in United States history?\n\nThere are big crimes scenes in the nation that come to mind immediately. The Watergate Hotel. The St. Valentine’s Day Massacre on Clark Street in Chicago. The Lorraine Motel in Memphis. Ford’s Theater in New York.\n\nBut this room on the sixth floor is right at the top of those lists.\n\nAfter I visited the museum, the grassy knoll seemed to be even more haunting. I made it a point to go to the exact spot where Abraham Zapruder was when he became one of the only photographers to film the assassination. The running time of his film? Less than 27 seconds. This film was later used in the important piece of evidence before the Warren Commission hearings and was eventually was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.\n\nLiving in an era now where just about everything is recorded in a video on someone’s phone, this film by Zapruder was basically the first of those type of videos.\n\nBut what really took me back was just how close Zapruder was to Kennedy when he was recording his eventual death. There are a few X’s on the road — one of which is where one of the bullets was found. Another is the precise spot where Kennedy was shot.\n\nThat spot is only 65 feet away from where Zapruder was. To make it more clear, imagine a quarterback taking a snap from the 21-yard line. The end zone is where Kennedy was shot. Standing where Zapruder did, I could only wonder how the heck he was able to hold the camera somewhat steady. After all, shots were still being fired and he had just witnessed the most powerful person in the world being shot.\n\nMe? I would have ran for the hills. So I admire Zapruder’s poise.\n\nThere are countless conspiracies about what happened that day, which I won’t get into here. If you visit the grassy knoll site there are a half dozen people lingering around, offering to give you a tour that comes hand-in-hand with all the conspiracy theories.\n\nThe one I heard that day concerning Woody Harrelson’s family caught my attention.\n\nBut mostly when I visited I took a few minutes to think about Kennedy’s life and how it ended so quickly that day. It has been described as the end of Camelot, although both of John’s brothers — Robert and Ted — contributed to the world heavily before their lives also saw tragedy.\n\nI sat on the grassy knoll and thought, wow, this is where it happened. It seemed so small once you were there in person. And I kept thinking of Kennedy’s classic quote — “As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them.”\n\nSixty years after his death I hope I’m doing that as a reporter and a person."
