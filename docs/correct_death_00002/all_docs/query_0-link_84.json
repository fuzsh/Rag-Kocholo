    "text": "The assassination of U.S. Pres. John F. Kennedy was the most notorious political murder of the 20th century. Kennedy was the fourth U.S. president to have been assassinated while in office (after Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, and William McKinley). Almost from the beginning, the killing of the popular young president was thought to have been the result of a conspiracy rather than the act of an individual, despite findings to the contrary by the Warren Commission. The assassination and its aftermath played out through the newly dominant mass medium of television, which made it a uniquely immediate and shocking experience for many Americans. Kennedy’s death also brought an abrupt end to his supporters’ sense of optimism about the country’s future, which had been fueled by his broad popularity."
