        "text": "John F. Kennedy Jr. was killed 25 years ago Tuesday when the plane he was piloting crashed into the ocean off the coast of Martha's Vineyard.\n\nJFK Jr. took off from Fairfield, New Jersey, with his wife, Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy, and her older sister Lauren Bessette the evening of Friday, July 16, 1999.\n\nKennedy's plane was reported overdue early the next morning, as NBC 10's Paul McGonagle reported.\n\nKennedy and his wife were flying to Cape Cod to attend a Kennedy family wedding. They were going to stop at the Vineyard, which was Lauren Bessette's destination.\n\nSearchers began to fear the worst when luggage and parts of a plane were discovered in the water.\n\nThe bodies of Kennedy and the Bessette sisters were recovered a few days later.\n\nInvestigators said Kennedy apparently became disoriented flying at night and in hazy weather conditions."
