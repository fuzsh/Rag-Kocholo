        "text": "Watch the trailer.\n\nThe Emmy Award-winning franchise “One Day in America” returns with its second installment, “JFK: One Day in America,” this November to mark the 60th anniversary of former President John F. Kennedy’s assassination. From Emmy Award-winning 72 Films and David Glover along with Academy Award-winning filmmakers Dan Lindsay and T.J. Martin, the three-part series is a comprehensive account of that tragic moment in American history and the ripples that followed. Made in official collaboration with The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza in Dallas, the docuseries weaves archival footage, some colorized for the first time, with key testimony from the last surviving witnesses to create a minute-by-minute examination of that pivotal day that forever changed history.\n\nAhead of the series premiere on National Geographic, watch the first episode, “Assassination” (44 minutes), followed by a conversation with the series’ director, Ella Wright, and Peggy Simpson, a journalist who covered the JFK assassination for the Associated Press in 1963, including being an eyewitness to the shooting of Lee Harvey Oswald in the Dallas jail. The conversation will be moderated by Lillian Cunningham, an Emmy Award-winning journalist at The Washington Post where she hosts several podcasts on American history, including “Presidential,” “Moonrise,” and “Field Trip.”\n\nIn the episode, President Kennedy and his wife, Jackie, traveled to Texas with an eye on the 1964 elections. During a motorcade through downtown Dallas, JFK was brutally shot in broad daylight and, later, pronounced dead at Parkland Hospital with his grieving wife in the next room."
