    "text": "Rob Reiner , the actor and film director, has made a bold claim regarding the assassination of former US President John F Kennedy . According to Reiner, there were four shooters involved in Kennedy's murder, a theory he elaborates on in his 10-episode podcast titled ' Who Killed JFK? ?', co-hosted with journalist Soledad O’Brien. Reiner challenges the official narrative that Lee Harvey Oswald was the sole assassin, shooting from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository.According to a Daily Mail report, Reiner's interest in the Kennedy assassination began in high school.He questions the validity of the 'single-bullet theory', which suggests a single bullet passed through Kennedy's neck and then hit Texas Governor John Connelly. Reiner and his team, including author Dick Russell, believe they have pieced together the events of the assassination.\"I’m very confident on the conspiracy part of it,\" the Daily Mail reported Reiner saying on the podcast. \"That, I’m 100% confident on. Exactly who did what, we make our best guess based on all the information we have.\"They claim to have identified the shooters and their positions, suggesting there were at least four based on forensic evidence. However, Reiner has not yet disclosed the names of these alleged shooters, stating that more revelations will be unveiled in the final episodes of the podcast.The podcast, produced by iHeartPodcasts, has released three episodes so far, airing every Wednesday. Reiner, known for directing films like 'When Harry Met Sally', 'A Few Good Men', and 'The Story of Us', was inspired to start this podcast after developing an interest in the medium with his wife Michelle.President John F Kennedy tragically lost his life in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963, following a fatal shooting. He was officially declared dead upon his arrival at Parkland Memorial Hospital. Subsequent official inquiries determined that Lee Harvey Oswald, acting alone, was responsible for the assassination, firing from a window on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository."
