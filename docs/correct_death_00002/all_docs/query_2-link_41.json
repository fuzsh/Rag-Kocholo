    "text": "Less than an hour earlier, police arrested Lee Harvey Oswald, a recently hired employee at the Texas School Book Depository. Oswald was held as a presidential assassin and for having fatally shot, shortly afterward, J.D. Tippit, a Dallas police officer.\n\nTwo days later, a Sunday morning, Oswald was being transferred from police headquarters to the county jail. Viewers watching live television coverage saw Oswald shot at close range. The assailant was identified as Jack Ruby, a Dallas nightclub owner. Oswald died two hours later at Parkland. Ruby was convicted of Oswald’s murder, although the verdict was later overturned on appeal. Ruby died in prison in 1967 while awaiting a new trial.\n\nOn that same Sunday, the slain president’s flag-draped casket was moved from the White House to the U.S. Capitol on a caisson drawn by six gray horses, accompanied by one riderless black horse. At Jackie Kennedy’s request, the cortege was modeled on the funeral of President Abraham Lincoln in 1865. Silent crowds lined Pennsylvania Avenue, and many people wept as the caisson passed.\n\nDuring the 21 hours that the president’s body lay in state in the Capitol Rotunda, some 250,000 people filed by to pay their respects. Some waited to do so in near-freezing temperatures for as long as 10 hours in a line up to 10 people wide that stretched 40 blocks.\n\nAbout 1 million people lined the route of the funeral procession, from the Capitol to the White House, then to St. Matthew’s Cathedral, and, finally, to Arlington National Cemetery. Tens of millions more followed the funeral on their black-and-white television sets. Those who watched the funeral on television were the only ones who saw the ceremony in its entirety. The nation’s three networks, ABC, CBS and NBC, used at least 50 cameras for their joint coverage to allow viewers to follow the proceedings in their entirety from the Capitol to Arlington.\n\nSOURCE: JOHN F.
