Kennedy died on Nov. 22, 1963, when he was assassinated in Dallas, Texas.\n\nKennedy had started his term as the 35th president of the United States in January 1961.\n\nKennedy and his wife, Jacqueline, were riding in a motorcade from the airport headed to a luncheon where he was scheduled to speak. They were accompanied by Texas Governor John Connally and his wife, Nellie.\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy is seen riding in motorcade approximately one minute before he was shot in Dallas, Texas, on Nov. 22, 1963.

Johnson was administered the oath of office at 2:38 p.m.\n\nConnally was seriously injured and underwent surgery for wounds to his back, chest, wrist and thigh, according to history.com.\n\nPresident John F.

Oswald was killed two days later by former Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby.\n\nAcross the globe, people were shocked and saddened by the president’s death. Sports events across the nation were canceled. Television stations cleared their schedules to air all coverage of the assassination.\n\nThe headline across the top of The Patriot read: “Hidden Assassin Murders President”\n\nFILE - In this Friday, Nov. 22, 1963 file photo, seen through the foreground convertible's windshield, President John F.

Nearly 12 hours later, a 24-year-old man who professed love for the Soviet Union was charged with his murder. The charge was filed against Lee Harvey Oswald, 24. Officers said he was the man who hid on the fifth floor of a textbook warehouse and snapped off three quick shots that killed the President and wounded Gov. John B. Connally of Texas.\n\nAs the shots reverberated, blood sprang from the President’s face. He fell downward in the back seat of his car. His wife grasped his head and tried to lift it, crying, ‘Oh, no!’”\n\nIn Harrisburg, The Patriot reported, “News of President Kennedy’s death hit Harrisburg hard.\n\nWhen the news broke here, people said: ‘It can’t be. I don’t believe it.’\n\nThe presidential limousine carrying President Kennedy and first lady Jacqueline Kennedy, as well as Texas Gov. John Connally and his wife, is followed by secret servicemen on running boards, November 22, 1963 in Dallas, Texas. Moments later, President John F. Kennedy was hit by an assassin's bullets.

Not him.’\n\nBut President Kennedy was dead. And Harrisburg was one of many cities facing the fact: ‘Our president was murdered.’”\n\nSenator John Kennedy campaigns in front of The Spot in downtown Harrisburg, Sept. 15, 1960.\n\nKennedy visited Harrisburg in 1960 when he was campaigning for president and in 1962 after he was elected, he campaigned for others. His 1962 visit included a speech at the Farm Show Arena.\n\nThe Evening News reported on Sept. 16, 1960, that more than 9,000 people attended a dinner with Kennedy at Zembo Shrine Mosque and Scottish Rite Cathedral. Tents were set up on the lawn to accommodate the crowd.\n\nOn that visit, Kennedy made stops in Harrisburg, Lebanon, Reading, Lancaster, Columbia and York before heading to Baltimore.\n\nThe paper said he received “a rousing reception.”\n\nHis remarks in Market Square were brief – only 4 minutes. And, he was 65 minutes late. State employees had been released early so they could hear his speech.\n\nThe crowd in Reading was estimated at between 20,000 and 30,000 people.\n\n\"The reception in Reading was so enthusiastic the Massachusetts senator's shirt was ripped in the crowd that swarmed over his motorcade.\n\nKennedy stopped at a filling station outside Reading and went into the owner's cottage behind the station to change shirts.”\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy speaking at the Farm Show building, Sept. 20, 1962. (Allied Pix for The Patriot-News)\n\nIn 1962, the paper reported that 10,000 people heard Kennedy speak at the Farm Show. His speech there was interrupted 19 times, according to the newspaper report, by “thunderous applause. At the end of his speech, which took less than 20 minutes, the tumultuous roar was greater than ever. Kennedy started the applause early with an introductory remark: ‘I will introduce myself. I am Teddy Kennedy’s brother.’”\n\nIn this April 30, 1963 file photo, President John F. Kennedy listens while Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg speaks at the White House. (AP Photo/William J.
