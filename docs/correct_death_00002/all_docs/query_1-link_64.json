        "text": "‘It’s a mystery wrapped up in a riddle inside an enigma’, blurts Joe Pesci’s David Ferrie in Oliver Stone’s JFK (1991). Now the 60th anniversary of the Kennedy assassination is upon us, and we are no closer to putting the issue to rest. The enduring fascination prompted Stone to direct a new documentary, JFK Revisited: Through the Looking Glass, in 2021. ‘Frustratingly short on answers’, was one critic’s verdict.\n\nIf anything, the latest declassification of records in December 2022, coming after an inexplicable five-year delay, only sparked further debate. As one poll showed, over two-thirds of Americans were unhappy with Joe Biden for upholding the redaction of thousands of documents with the vague excuse of preventing ‘possible harm’."
