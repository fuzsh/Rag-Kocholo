He flew aboard SAM 26000 to Dallas, Texas, where he was assassinated on Nov. 22, 1963 -- and it was on this airplane that Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson was sworn in as the new president. SAM 26000 then carried Kennedy's body and Johnson back to Washington, D.C.\n\nThis page contains information and resources in commemoration of these historic events."
