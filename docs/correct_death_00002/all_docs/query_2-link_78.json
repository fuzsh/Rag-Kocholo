She lived here as a new bride, and again after the tragic death of her husband.\n\nIncluding a stop for lunch or shopping on the Kennedys’ beloved Wisconsin Avenue, the tour won’t take more than a few pleasant hours. All the homes in which the Kennedys lived and the church where they worshiped are on these quaint and historic streets. Enjoy the trip while enjoying your own memories of one of America’s most brilliant couples.\n\n*The homes on this walking tour are private residences.
