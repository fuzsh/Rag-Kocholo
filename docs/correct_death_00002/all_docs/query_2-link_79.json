        "text": "Like Pearl Harbor and 9/11, the assassination of President Kennedy was one of those stunning events where, if you were alive at the time, you will always remember where you were when you heard the news.\n\nMany pop songs have referenced President Kennedy, and more than a few have dealt with the circumstances of his assassination, which occurred 60 years ago Wednesday (Nov. 22) as he rode in an open convertible through downtown Dallas. (It’s hard to imagine a president being so exposed today, but it was a more innocent time.)\n\nEven before the assassination, singers (and one very famous actress) sang about him. Frank Sinatra sang a special-material version of his Oscar-winning 1959 hit “High Hopes” that became Kennedy’s 1960 campaign theme song. His rival in that election, Richard Nixon, was doubtless irked by the line “Oops there goes the opposition, kerplop.”\n\nIn May 1962, country and pop singer Jimmy Dean (who had topped the Billboard Hot 100 in 1961 with “Big Bad John”) had a top 10 hit on that chart with “P.T. 109.” The song recounted Kennedy’s heroic actions during World War II as the commanding officer of patrol torpedo boat that bore that name. After the boat was rammed by a Japanese destroyer, Kennedy, then 26, led his crew to safety.\n\nPerhaps most famously, Marilyn Monroe sang a steamy, sexy “Happy Birthday, Mr. President” at a 45th birthday salute to President Kennedy at Madison Square Garden in May 1962. Kennedy followed the performance with a quip that showed his celebrated wit: “I can now retire from politics after having had ‘Happy Birthday’ sung to me in such a sweet, wholesome way.” Tragically, both would be dead in a little more than 18 months. Monroe died of an overdose in August 1962.\n\nHere’s a sampling of 18 songs – some famous, some not; some reverent, some highly irreverent – that reference President Kennedy. They are listed in chronological order. We show how high the song climbed on the Hot 100 – if it charted – and how high its corresponding album climbed on the Billboard 200."
