    "text": "The \"X\" street markings indicating where US President John F Kennedy was assassinated have been removed from Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas.\n\nWorkers are laying asphalt to level the street in preparation for events on Friday commemorating the 50th anniversary of Kennedy's death.\n\nKennedy was shot by Lee Harvey Oswald as his motorcade passed through the plaza on 22 November 1963.\n\nMemorial events are expected to draw large crowds this week.\n\nDallas city spokesman Frank Librio said city workers paved over the street - and the \"X\" marks - in an effort to remove any hazards.\n\n\"With thousands visiting the area this week, we think that is prudent,\" he told the media.\n\nCity officials are unaware of who originally placed the \"X\" markings, located along the city's Elm Street."
