        "text": "This story originally appeared Nov. 21, 2013\n\nIn 1963, television screens were small and rounded and transmitted black-and-white images. No matter how you configured the \"rabbit-ears,\" reception could be spotty. Changing the channel involved walking over to do it manually. Not that there were a lot of choices. In the New York market, you could count the broadcast channels on two hands. When it came to news, even fewer options existed.\n\n\"You basically had CBS and NBC,\" Dan Rather, one of the few remaining television newsmen from that era, said during a recent teleconference to promote his AXS TV special on President John F. Kennedy’s assassination. \"Yes, ABC was around, but it wasn’t yet an equal competitor, if you will. It was a much smaller competitive arena.\"\n\nAnd yet, despite television’s relative lack of stature and sophistication, on Nov. 22, 1963, when JFK was murdered in Dallas, the medium became a national hearth around which families gathered to get updates and to mourn.\n\nOn that Friday, and over the three days that followed, America arguably lost its innocence — and television really came of age.\n\nIn the hundreds of emails Record readers sent in about that fateful day, many said they heard the news on TV or tuned in soon after and remained \"glued\" to the coverage. A number mentioned the famed moment when CBS cut into \"As The World Turns\" with a special bulletin that shots had been fired at the president’s motorcade.\n\nCronkite relatively new\n\n\"That’s when television news ascended to dominance,\" says Rather, who was at Dealey Plaza that day, standing just beyond the overpass. \"From that moment on, television became dominant as a news source of the country and … the national heart around which people gathered as they had gathered around radio for the fireside chats of Franklin Roosevelt.\"\n\nOne of the most iconic TV replays from Nov. 22 is when CBS anchor Walter Cronkite puts on his big black glasses to read the official confirmation that the president is dead, then takes off the glasses and appears to choke up for several long seconds.\n\nThe irony is that Cronkite, who had expanded his nightly newscast to a half hour less than three months before, was not the nation’s most watched newscaster at the time, says Ron Simon, television and radio curator at The Paley Center for Media. NBC anchor team Chet Huntley and David Brinkley were No. 1.\n\n\"Most people were tuned into NBC for their coverage of the Kennedy assassination, because Huntley-Brinkley was popular through the mid-Sixties,\" Simon says. \"Cronkite had just taken over the news in ’62, so he was perhaps a new figure to a lot of Americans who were getting their first set.\"\n\nThat weekend, the three major networks, which had preempted regular programming and suspended commercials — CBS stuck with news even after the NFL decided to play its Sunday games, Rather notes — went with wall-to-wall news coverage. That included interviews with former presidents and foreign dignitaries and biographies about the new president, Lyndon B. Johnson.\n\nKilling of Oswald\n\nOn Sunday, Nov. 24, viewers who were tuned to NBC saw strip club owner Jack Ruby fatally shoot accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald — live, as it happened, another shock to the reeling nation.\n\nThe funeral on Monday imprinted more images in viewers — the widow’s veiled face, the young son’s salute, the flag-draped coffin, the riderless horse, its backwards stirrups holding empty boots.\n\nOver those four days in November, Simon says, more than 90 percent of the American public watched at least some of the television coverage, and the funeral was the largest televised event of that time.\n\n\"I think that television especially matured and learned its responsibilities [those four days],\" Simon says. \"Before that, it had gone through a tough time.\"\n\nAlthough the work of the great CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow in 1953 and 1954 — especially his brave reporting on Sen. Joseph McCarthy on his \"See It Now\" program — changed the face of American journalism, by 1961 Murrow had left CBS and was the head of the U.S. Information Agency. What’s more, the quiz show scandals of the late 1950s had tarnished the medium’s luster. So had FCC Chairman Newton N. Minow’s assessment, in May 1961, that TV was \"a vast wasteland.\"\n\nBut television redeemed itself — and showed its potential — with its coverage of the national tragedy.\n\nAlthough television began as a live medium in the ’50s, until JFK’s assassination, live news coverage was still a relative rarity, used for major events like the August 1963 March on Washington and the 1960 presidential debates. But television news crews mostly shot on film, which had to be processed before it could be edited and aired.\n\nIt was because of TV that millions of Americans came to feel that they knew JFK.\n\nFirst TV-savvy leader\n\n\"He was the first president who liked television, understood television, knew how to use television, [which] helped build his presidency,\" Rather said. \"Yes, television had been around for President Truman and Eisenhower, but neither one of them liked television particularly. Also, during their presidencies, television sets had not permeated the overall population.\"\n\nIn 1960, 46.9 million U.S. households owned a TV — up from 9.8 million a decade earlier, according to Nielsen.\n\nIn the many 50th anniversary specials that have aired this month, JFK and Jackie seem so vibrant in the color film that was taken by amateur movie-makers. In history’s most famous home movie, taken by dressmaker Abraham Zapruder, the color is unbearably bright in the frame when a bullet hits the president’s head.\n\nBut America would not see that 26-second film in its entirety until 1975. In November 1963, most of us watched the tragedy through a darkly monochromatic lens.\n\nHalf a century later, that black and white blend of film and video feels dated. But at the time, those moving pictures brought us together as a nation to grieve, gave us images that remain indelible, allowed us to witness history in the making — and established television as a place to turn to in times of tragedy.\n\nMore on JFK"
