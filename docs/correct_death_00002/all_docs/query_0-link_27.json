    "text": "Remember the life and service of President Kennedy at a striking memorial that dominates a plaza in Dallas, located just moments from where he was shot.\n\nTake a moment to reflect on the life and death of a famous 20th-century president at the John F. Kennedy Memorial in central Dallas. The eye-catching memorial is a now-iconic cuboid made of poured concrete that seems to float above the square. A nearby museum further adds to the story of the 35th president.\n\nIn November 1963, President John Fitzgerald Kennedy was shot while touring the city of Dallas. Stop by the memorial that was erected one block away from the scene of his death in 1970. The bold, simple design was created by celebrated architect Philip Johnson, who was a friend of the Kennedy family.\n\nTake in a wide view of the memorial to appreciate its size and shape. White concrete walls, supported by eight columns, form a square in the center of a plaza. The memorial, which is 30 feet (9 meters) high and 50 feet (15 meters) long on each side, was designed to resemble a modern mausoleum or cenotaph.\n\nCome back at night to see the memorial lit up with lights embedded in the floor beneath the block. It sometimes appears as if the light itself is holding the walls up. Step inside the square to see the name of the president engraved and painted gold in the walls.\n\nLeave the memorial behind and walk to neighboring Dealey Plaza, the fateful area where President Kennedy was shot while riding a motorcade through the city. The site is overlooked by the Sixth Floor Museum, where the assassin took his shot. Browse the exhibits in the museum to learn about the ongoing legacy of JFK and his tragically shortened time in office.\n\nThe John F. Kennedy Memorial is located in the Downtown neighborhood of Dallas, near landmarks such as Dallas City Hall and the Dallas Holocaust Museum. Metered parking lots are available nearby, although it is also possible to visit on a walking tour of the area. Come here at any time for free throughout the year to appreciate the memorial."
