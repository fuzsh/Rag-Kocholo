        "text": "JFK Assassination Tour Without Museum\n\nBook Now\n\nTravel to the Grassy Knoll and the infamous car ride that made history on November 22, 1963. Many people remember the day when they heard the news of the tragic assassination of former President John F. Kennedy as he drove through Dallas. The assassination, assumed to be by Lee Harvey Oswald, is one of the most discussed and speculated unsolved mysteries of our time.\n\nWe will take you to the world of conspiracy, where you may look out over Dealey Plaza (JFK Assassination), Grassy Knoll, and the Kennedy Memorial. Then continue the journey of controversy and conspiracy to the home Oswald, said to be where JD Tippit was killed. This is considered a twist in the conspiracy theory of the assassination. Finally, follow up with a stop along the way at the historic Texas Movie Theater in Oak Cliff, a beautiful and historic area of downtown Dallas.\n\n2 Hour Tour"
