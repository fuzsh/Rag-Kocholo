        "text": "JOHN F. KENNEDY AND THE MEMORY OF A NATION\n\nTHE EARLY 1960S\n\nThe exhibit’s introductory section outlines the major social movements and political events of the 1960s. Thought-provoking images, artifacts and a short video acclimate you to the period, while presenting insights into JFK, his family and the major issues his administration faced.\n\nTHE TRIP TO TEXAS\n\nNovember 21, 1963. A two-day political trip to five Texas cities gets under way. A short video highlights the enthusiastic crowds cheering on the Kennedy’s throughout their trip and explores the complex social and political atmosphere in Dallas at the time of the assassination.\n\nTHE CORNER WINDOW\n\nTHE CRISIS HOURS\n\nForty-five minutes after shots rang out in Dealey Plaza, Dallas Police Officer J.D. Tippit is murdered in the Oak Cliff section of Dallas. Suspect Lee Harvey Oswald, a temporary employee at the Texas School Book Depository, is arrested and charged with both murders. Less than forty-eight hours after the assassination, Oswald is shot in the basement of the Dallas Police Department by local nightclub owner Jack Ruby. Artifacts related to Oswald and Ruby include: Lee Harvey Oswald’s wedding ring, Jack Ruby’s recognizable hat, and the camera used by Dallas Times Herald photographer Bob Jackson to capture the Pulitzer Prize-winning photo of the shooting.\n\nTHE INVESTIGATIONS\n\nTHE CORNER STAIRCASE\n\nTHE MEMORY BOOKS\n\nYou are invited to leave a personal recollection or comment in our Memory Books, which become part of our Institutional Archives."
