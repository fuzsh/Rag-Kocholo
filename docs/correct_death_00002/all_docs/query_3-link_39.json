        "text": "Overcast morning skies cleared by the time Kennedy and first lady Jacqueline Kennedy arrived in Dallas, but darkness would soon fall on an entire nation.\n\nScroll for the story\n\n12:29 p.m.\n\nKennedy arrives\n\nFrom downtown Dallas, Kennedy's presidential limousine turns right onto Houston Street along the edge of Dealey Plaza, then left onto Elm Street at the Texas School Book Depository.\n\nHow the Secret Service has changed\n\nListen:\n\nNote: Please upgrade your Flash plug-in to view our enhanced content.\n\nThe modern presidential limousine is known as \"The Beast.\" “Trying to compare the car that President Kennedy was in in 1963 to 'The Beast,' it would be like comparing a Conestoga wagon to a spaceship,” said W. Ralph Basham, who was director of the Secret Service from 2003 to 2006 and, before that, a Secret Service agent for 28 years. He currently works at Command Consulting Group.\n\nScroll to continue\n\n12:30 p.m.\n\nOswald opens fire\n\nThe president’s open limousine is moving at approximately 11 mph along Elm Street toward the railroad bridge. Lee Harvey Oswald fires two or three shots from the sixth-floor window of the Texas School Book Depository, where he was a temporary employee.\n\nHow the Secret Service has changed\n\nListen:\n\nNote: Please upgrade your Flash plug-in to view our enhanced content.\n\nToday, entire fronts of buildings along the route would be vacant and countersnipers and lookouts would be in place. “When [Secret Service agents] see something that may appear to be a weapon, they would have eliminated that threat,” Basham said.\n\nScroll to continue\n\nKennedy wounded\n\nThe first shot hits Kennedy, enters his back and exits below his throat, then continues through Texas Gov. John B. Connally’s chest and wrist before stopping in his left leg. Some claim that a single “magic bullet,” which was found nearly whole, could not have done so much damage. Later scientific analysis supports the Warren Commission’s single-bullet theory.\n\nHow the Secret Service has changed\n\nListen:\n\nNote: Please upgrade your Flash plug-in to view our enhanced content.\n\n“You can’t quite visualize just what an easy shot it was,” said Ronald Kessler, a former Washington Post reporter who is the author of “In the President’s Secret Service: Behind the Scenes With Agents in the Line of Fire and the Presidents They Protect.”\n\nScroll to continue\n\nKennedy killed\n\nAbout five seconds later, another shot strikes Kennedy's head, causing the fatal wound. In the photo at right, two of the Secret Service agents who were riding on the running boards of the car behind the president are shown at the moment of the fatal shot.\n\nHow the Secret Service has changed\n\nListen:\n\nNote: Please upgrade your Flash plug-in to view our enhanced content.\n\n“JFK himself personally said he didn’t want agents riding on the rear running board of his limousine,” Kessler said.\n\nScroll to continue\n\nAbout 12:31 p.m.\n\nLimo speeds to hospital\n\nThe limousine driver speeds out of Dealey Plaza to Parkland Memorial Hospital, where Kennedy is pronounced dead at 1 p.m. In the photo at right, Secret Service agent Clint Hill jumps onto the limousine as it leaves Dealey Plaza. When he was shot, Kennedy was near the end of a 10-mile parade route through Dallas.\n\nHow the Secret Service has changed\n\nListen:\n\nNote: Please upgrade your Flash plug-in to view our enhanced content.\n\n“The Secret Service would try to do things in a more clandestine way,” Kessler said.\n\nScroll to continue\n\n12:33 p.m.\n\nOswald flees\n\nOswald slips out of the front door of the Texas School Book Depository but is captured after shooting a police officer about an hour and a half later, about three miles away at the Texas Theatre. Two days later, Oswald was shot and killed by Dallas nightclub operator Jack Ruby while in police custody.\n\nHow the Secret Service has changed\n\nListen:\n\nNote: Please upgrade your Flash plug-in to view our enhanced content.\n\n“Instead of the 35 or 38 agents that were on the ground in 1963, there would be literally hundreds of people,” Basham said."
