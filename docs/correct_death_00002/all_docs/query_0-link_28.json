        "text": "DALLAS #1 JFK TOUR\n\nPhone: (888) 685-7675\n\nEmail: info@thejfktour.com\n\nOur tours are created based on the idea: If we go on a JFK Tour, what kind of experience would we like to have, whether we take a walking or a vehicle-operated tour? Some local tour operators restrict their tours to two blocks of Dealey Plaza, operate cramped buses, some with prerecorded content, or offer \"express JFK tours\" (do not ask us, we do not know what that is).\n\nWe avoid all those shortcuts and many others, all our tours are private, with live commentary covering the JFK assassination and the aftermath of the assassination. Our tour guides are incredible storytellers and subject matter experts. We operate a tour that we are proud of and would love for you to join us!\n\nIf you are loking for the BEST JFK EXPERIENCE, you are in the rigth place!\n\nWHY ARE ALL OUR TOURS PRIVATE?\n\n- We want to make sure that you get exactly what you want out of your JFK experience. There’s no room for mistakes or disappointments. It's just you and your group. Our excursions are led by certified professional tour guides following a well-crafted and balanced program.\n\nCAN YOU ACOMMODATE LESS THAN 6 GUESTS?\n\n- Yes, we can accommodate up to six guests; however, due to the nature of the tour and the cost of a certified professional tour guide, we will have a minimum charge if you have fewer than six guests. Walking tour: $400, vehicle-operated excursion: $750. We recommend our self-guided tour for small groups.\n\nWHAT TIME CAN WE DO THE TOUR?\n\n- We can start the tour anytime you request, based on our availability. We will coordinate all the logistics – from transportation to attraction tickets. Whether it is a visit to the Sixth Floor Museum or lunch before or after the tour, we can customize the program to fit your needs.\n\nDo you offer roundtrip transportation?\n\n- If you are booking a vehicle-operated experience we will pick you up/ drop you off anywhere in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. If you are booking a walking tour we will meet you and your guests at the John F. Kennedy Memorial Plaza: 646 Main St, Dallas, TX 75202"
