    "text": "WHAT REALLY HAPPENED? November 22, 1963 The assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, the 35th president of the United States, on November 22, 1963, remains one of the defining events of the 20th century.\n\nThe shooting in Dallas, Texas, before thousands of onlookers was also captured by TV cameras and in home movies, yet in the minds of many, much about what happened that day remains shrouded in mystery.\n\nPresident Kennedy's alleged killer, Lee Harvey Oswald, was himself shot and killed as cameras rolled just two days later.\n\nWhy Oswald shot Kennedy and wounded Texas governor John Connally, and whether he acted alone or was part of a wider conspiracy, has been the subject of official inquiries and countless films, books, and newspaper and magazine articles over the past 50 years.\n\nThe internet has also become fertile ground for speculation and allegations of involvement by the mafia, the Russians, the Cubans and even vice-president Lyndon Johnson, who succeeded Kennedy."
