        "text": "DALLAS, Nov. 22—President John Fitz­gerald Kennedy was shot and killed by an as­sassin today.\n\nHe died of a wound in the brain caused by a rifle bullet that was fired at him as he was riding through downtown Dallas in a motorcade.\n\nVice President Lyndon Baines Johnson, who was riding in the third car behind Mr. Kennedy's, was sworn in as the 36th President of the United States 99 minutes after Mr. Kennedy's death.\n\nMr. Johnson is 55 years old ; Mr. Kennedy was 46.\n\nShortly after the assassination, Lee H. Os­wald, who once defected to the Soviet Union and who has been active in the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, was arrested by the Dallas police, Tonight he was accused of the killing.\n\nSuspect Captured After Scuffle\n\nOswald, 24 years old, was also accused of slaying a policeman who had approached him in the street. Oswald was subdued after a scuffle with a second policeman in a nearby theater.\n\nPresident Kennedy was shot at 12:30 P.M., Central standard time (1:30 P.M., New York time). He was pronounced dead at 1 P.M. and Mr. Johnson was sworn in at 2:39 P.M.\n\nMr. Johnson, who was uninjured in the shooting, took his oath in the Presidential jet plane as it stood on the runway at Love Field. The body of Mr. Kennedy was aboard. Imme­diately after the oath‐taking, the plane took off for Washington.\n\nStanding beside the new President as Mr. Johnson took the oath of office was Mrs. John F. Kennedy. Her stockings were spattered with her husband's blood.\n\nGov. John B. Connally Jr. of Texas, who was riding in the same car with Mr. Kennedy, was severely wounded in the chest, ribs and arm. His condition was serious, but not critical.\n\nThe killer fired the rifle from a building just off the motorcade route. Mr. Kennedy, Governor Connally and Mr. Johnson had just received an enthusiastic welcome from a large crowd in downtown Dallas.\n\nMr. Kennedy apparently was hit by the first of what witnesses believed were three shots. He was driven at high speed to Dallas's Park­land Hospital. There, in an emergency operat­ing room, with only physicians and nurses in attendance, he died without regaining consciousness.\n\nMrs. Kennedy, Mrs. Connally and a Secret Service agent were in the car with Mrs. Ken­nedy and Governor Connally. Two Secret Serv­ice agents flanked the car. Other than Mr. Con­nally, none of this group was injured in the shooting. Mrs. Kennedy cried, “Oh no !” immedi­ately after her husband was struck.\n\nMrs. Kennedy was in the hospital near her husband when he died, but not in the operating room. When the body was taken from the hos­pital in a bronze coffin about 2 P.M., Mrs. Kennedy walked beside it.\n\nHer face was sorrowful. She looked steadily at the floor. She still wore the raspberry‐colored suit in which she had greeted welcoming crowds in Fort Worth and Dallas. But she had taken off the matching pillbox hat she wore earlier in the day, and her dark hair was windblown and tangled. Her hand rested lightly on her husband's coffin as it was taken to a waiting hearse.\n\nMrs. Kennedy climbed in beside the coffin. Then the ambulance drove to Love Field, and Mr. Kennedy's body was placed aboard the Presidential jet. Mrs. Kennedy then attended the swearing‐in ceremony for Mr. Johnson.\n\nAs Mr. Kennedy's body left Parkland Hospital, a few stunned persons stood outside. Nurses and doctors, whispering among them­selves, looked from the window. A larger crowd that had gathered earlier, before it was known that the President was dead, had been dispersed by Secret Service men and policemen.\n\nPriests Administer Last Rites\n\nTwo priests administered last rites to Mr. Kennedy, a Roman Catholic. They were the Very Rev. Oscar Huber, the pastor of Holy Trinity Church in Dallas, and the Rev. James Thompson.\n\nMr. Johnson was sworn in as President by Federal Judge Sarah T. Hughes of the Northern District of Texas. She was appointed to the judgeship by Mr. Kennedy in October, 1961.\n\nThe ceremony, delayed about five minutes for Mrs. Kennedy's arrival, took place in the private Presidential cabin in the rear of the plane.\n\nAbout 25 to 30 persons—members of the late President's staff, members of Congress who had been accompanying the President on a two‐day tour of Texas cities and a few reporters —crowded into the little room.\n\nNo accurate listing of those present could he obtained. Mrs. Kennedy stood at the left of Mr. Johnson, her eyes and face showing the signs of weeping that had apparently shaken her since she left the hospital not long before.\n\nMrs. Johnson, wearing a beige dress, stood at her husband's right.\n\nAs Judge Hughes read the brief oath of office, her eyes, too, were red from weeping. Mr. Johnson's hands rested on a black, leather­bound Bible as Judge Hughes read and he repeated:\n\n“I do solemnly swear that I will perform the duties of the President of the United States to the best of my ability and defend, protect and preserve the Constitution of the United states.”\n\nThose 34 words made Lyndon Baines John­son, one‐time farmboy and schoolteacher of Johnson City, the President.\n\nJohnson Embraces Mrs. Kennedy\n\nMr. Johnson made no statement. He em­braced Mrs. Kennedy and she held his hand for a long moment. He also embraced Mrs. John­son and Mrs. Evelyn Lincoln, Mr. Kennedy's private secretary.\n\n“O.K.,” Mr. Johnson said. “Lets get this plane back to Washington.”\n\nAt 2 :46 P.M., seven minutes after he had become President, 106 minutes after Mr. Ken­nedy had become the fourth American Presi­dent tosuccumb to an assassin's wounds, the white and red jet took off for Washington.\n\nIn the cabin when Mr. Johnson took the oath was Cecil Stoughton, an armed forces photog­rapher assigned to the White House.\n\nMr. Kennedy's staff members appeared stunned and bewildered. Lawrence F. O'Brien, the Congressional liaison officer, and P. Ken­neth O'Donnell, the appointment secretary, both long associates of Mr. Kennedy, showed evi­dences of weeping. None had anything to say.\n\nOther staff members believed to be in the cabin for the swearing‐in included David F. Powers, the White House receptionist ; Miss Pamela Turnure, Mrs. Kennedy's press sec­retary, and Malcolm Kilduff, the assistant White House press secretary.\n\nMr. Kilduff announced the President's death, with choked voice and red‐rimmed eyes, at about 1:36 P.M.\n\n“President John F. Kennedy died at ap­proximately 1 o'clock Central standard time today here in Dallas,” Mr. Kilduff said at the hospital. “He died of a gunshot wound in the brain. I have no other details regarding the assassination of the President.”\n\nMr. Kilduff also announced that Governor Connally had been hit by a bullet or bullets and that Mr. Johnson, who had not yet been sworn in, was safe in the protective custody of the Secret Service at an unannounced place, pre­sumablv the airplane at Love Field.\n\nMr. Kilduff indicated that the President had been shot once. Later medical reports raised the possibility that there had been two wounds. But the death was caused, as far as could be learned, by a massive wound in the brain.\n\nLater in the afternoon, Dr. Malcolm Perry, an attending surgeon, and Dr. Kemp Clark, chief of neurosurgery at Parkland Hospital, gave more details.\n\nMr. Kennedy was hit by a bullet in the throat, just below the Adam's apple, they said. This wound had the appearance of a bullet's entry.\n\nMr. Kennedy also had a massive, gaping wound in the back and one on the right side of the head. However, the doctors said it was im­possible to determine immediately whether the wounds had been caused by on bullet or two.\n\nResuscitation Attempted\n\nDr. Perry, the first physician to treat the President, said a number of resuscitative meas­ures had been attempted, including oxygen, anesthesia, an indotracheal tube, a tracheotomy, blood and fluids. An electrocardiogram monitor was attached to measure Mr. Kennedy's heart beats.\n\nDr. Clark was summoned and arrived in a minute or two. By then, Dr. Perry said, Mr. Ken­nedy was “critically ill and moribund,” or near death.\n\nDr. Clark said that on his first sight of the President, he had concluded immediately that Mr. Kennedy could not live.\n\n“It was apparent that the President had sustained a lethal wound,” he said. “A missile had gone in and out of the back of his head caus­ing external lacerations and loss of brain tissue.”\n\nShortly after he arrived, Dr. Clark said, “the President lost his heart action by the electrocardiogram.” A closed‐chest cardiograph massage was attempted, as were other emer­gency resuscitation measures.\n\nDr. Clark said these had produced “palpable pulses” for a short time, but all were “to no avail.”\n\nIn Operating Room 40 Minutes\n\nThe President was on the emergency table at the hospital for about 40 minutes, the doctors said. At the end, perhaps eight physicians were in Operating Room No. 1, where Mr. Kennedy remained until his death. Dr. Clark said it was difficult to determine the exact moment of death, but the doctors said officially that it occurred at 1 P.M.\n\nLater, there were unofficial reports that Mr. Kennedy had been killed instantly. The source of these reports, Dr. Tom Shires, chief surgeon at the hospital and professor of surgery at the University of Texas Southwest Medical School, issued this statement tonight:\n\n“Medically, it was apparent the President was not alive when he was brought in. There was no spontaneous respiration. He had dilated, fixed pupils. It was obvious he had a lethal head wound.\n\n“Technically, however, by using vigorous resuscitation, intravenous tubes and all the usual supportive measures, we were able to raise a semblance of a heartbeat.”\n\nDr. Shires said he was “positive it was im­possible” that President Kennedy could have spoken after being shot. “I am absolutely sure he never knew what hit him,” Dr. Shires said.\n\nDr. Shires was not present when Mr. Ken­nedy was being treated at Parkland Hospital He issued his statement, however, after lengthy conferences with the doctors who had attended the President.\n\nMr. Johnson remained in the hospital about 30 minutes afterter Mr. Kennedy died.\n\nThe details of what happened when shots first rang out, as the President's car moved along at about 25 miles an hour, were sketchy. Secret Service agents, who might have given more de tails, were unavailable to the press at first, and then returned to Washington with President Johnson.\n\nKennedys Hailed at Breakfast\n\nMr. Kennedy had opened his day in Fort Worth, first with a speech in a parking lot and then at a Chamber of Commerce breakfast. The breakfast appearance was a particular triumph for Mrs. Kennedy, who entered late and was given an ovation.\n\nThen the Presidential party, including Gov­ernor and Mrs. Connally, flew on to Dallas, an eight‐minute flight. Mr. Johnson, as is custom­ary, flew in a separate plane. The President and the Vice President do not travel together, out of fear of a double tragedy.\n\nAt Love Field, Mr. and Mrs. Kennedy lin­gered for 10 minutes, shaking hands with an en­thusiastic group lining the fence. The group called itself “Grassroots Democrats.”\n\nMr. Kennedy then entered his open Lincoln convertible at the head of the motorcade. He sat in the rear seat on the right‐hand side. Mrs. Kennedy, who appeared to be enjoying one of the first political outings she had ever made with her husband, sat at his left.\n\nIn the “jump” seat, directly ahead of Mr. Kennedy, sat Governor Connally, with Mrs. Con­nally at his left in another “jump” seat. A Secret Service agent was driving and the two others ran alongside.\n\nBehind the President's limousine was an open sedan carrying a number of Secret Service agents. Behind them, in an open convertible, rode Mr. and Mrs. Johnson and Texas's senior Senator, Ralph W. Yarborough, a Democrat.\n\nThe motorcade proceeded uneventfully along a 10‐mile route through downtown Dallas, aim­ing for the Merchandise Mart. Mr. Kennedy was to address a group of the city's leading citizens at a luncheon in his honor.\n\nIn downtown Dallas, crowds were thick, enthusiastic and cheering. The turnout was somewhat unusual for this center of conserva­tism, where only a month ago Adlai E. Stevenson was attacked by a rightist crowd. It was also in Dallas, during the 1960 campaign, that Sena­tor Lyndon B. Johnson and his wife were nearly mobbed in the lobby of the Baker Hotel.\n\nAs the motorcade neared its end and the President's car moved out of the thick crowds onto Stennonds Freeway near the Merchandise Mart, Mrs. Connally recalled later, “we were all very pleased with the reception in downtown Dallas.”\n\nApproaching 3‐Street Underpass\n\nBehind the three leading cars were a string of others carrying Texas and Dallas dignitaries, two buses of reporters, several open cars carry­ing photographers and other reporters, and a bus for White House staff members.\n\nAs Mrs. Connally recalled later, the Presi­dent's car was almost ready to go underneath a “triple underpass” beneath three streets — Elm, Commerce and Main—when the first shot was fired.\n\nThat shot apparently struck Mr. Kennedy. Governor Connally turned in his seat at the sound and appeared immediately to be hit in the chest.\n\nMrs. Mary Norman of Dallas was standing at the curb and at that moment was aiming her camera at the President. She saw him slump forward, then slide down in the seat.\n\n“My God,” Mrs. Norman screamed, as she recalled it later, “he's shot!”\n\nMrs. Connally said that Mrs. Kennedy had reached and “grabbed” her husband. Mrs. Con­nally put her arms around the Governor. Mrs. Connally said that she and Mrs. Kennedy had then ducked low in the car as it sped off.\n\nMrs. Connally's recollections were reported by Julian Reade, an aide to the Governor.\n\nMost reporters in the press buses were too far back to see the shootings, but they observed some quick scurrying by motor policemen accom­panying the motorcade. It was noted that the President's car had picked up speed and raced away, but reporters were not aware that any­thing serious had occurred until they reached the Merchandise Mart two or three minutes later.\n\nRumors Spread at Trade Mart\n\nRumors of the shooting already were spread­inging through the luncheon crowd of hundreds, which was having the first course. No White House officials or Secret Service agents were present, but the reporters were taken quickly to Parkland Hospital on the strength of the rumors.\n\nThere they encountered Senator Yarbor­ough, white, shaken and horrified.\n\nThe shots, he said, seemed to have come from the right and the rear of the car in which he was riding, the third in the motorcade. Another eyewitness, Mel Crouch, a Dallas television re­porter, reported that as the shots rang out he saw a rifle extended and then withdrawn from a window on the “fifth or sixth floor” of the Texas Public School Book Depository. This is a leased state building on Elm Street, to the right of the motorcade route.\n\nSenator Yarborough said there had been a slight pause between the first two shots and a longer pause between the second and third. A Secret Service man riding in the Senator's car, the Senator said, immediately ordered Mr. and Mrs. Johnson to get down below the level of the doors. They did so, and Senator Yarborough also got down.\n\nThe leading cars of the motorcade then pulled away at high speed toward Parkland Hos­pital, which was not far away, by the fast high­way.\n\n“We knew by the speed that something was terribly wrong,” Senator Yarborough reported. When he put his head up, he said, he saw a Se­cret Service man in the car ahead beating his fists against the trunk deck of the car in which he was riding, apparently in frustration and anguish.\n\nMrs. Kennedy's Reaction\n\nOnly White House staff members spoke with Mrs. Kennedy. A Dallas medical student, David Edwards, saw her in Parkland Hospital while she was waiting for news of her husband. He gave this description:\n\n“The look in her eyes was like an animal that had been trapped, like a little rabbit—brave, but fear was in the eyes.”\n\nDr. Clark was reported to have informed Mrs. Kennedy of her husband's death.\n\nNo witnesses reported seeing or hearing any of the Secret Service agents or policemen fire back. One agent was seen to brandish a ma­chine gun as the cars sped away. Mr. Crouch ob­served a policeman falling to the ground and pulling a weapon. But the events had occurred so quickly that there was apparently nothing for the men to shoot at.\n\nMr. Crouch said he saw two women, stand­ing at a curb to watch the motorcade pass, fall to the ground when the shots rang out. He also saw a man snatch up his little girl and run along the road. Policemen, he said, immediately chased this man under the impression he had been in­volved in the shooting, but Mr. Crouch said he had been a fleeing spectator.\n\nMr. Kennedy's limousine—license No. GG300 under District of Columbia registry—pulled up at the emergency entrance of Parkland Hospi­tal. Senator Yarborough said the President had heen carried inside on a stretcher.\n\nBy the time reporters arrived at the hos­pital, the police were guarding the Presidential car closely. They would allow no one to approach it. A bucket of water stood by the car, suggesting that the back seat had been scrubbed out.\n\nRobert Clark of the American Broadcasting Company, who had been riding near the front of the motorcade, said Mr. Kennedy was motion­less when he was carried inside. There was a great amount of blood on Mr. Kennedy's suit and shirtfront and the front of his body, Mr. Clark said.\n\nMrs. Kennedy was leaning over her hus­band when the car stopped, Mr. Clark said, and walked beside the wheeled stretcher into the hospital. Mr. Connally sat with his hands holding his stomach, his head bent over. He, too, was moved into the hospital in a stretcher, with Mrs. Connally at his side.\n\nRobert McNeill of the National Broadcast­ing Company, who also was in the reporters' pool car, jumped out at the scene of the shooting. He said the police had taken two eyewitnesses into custody—an 8‐year‐old Negro boy and a white man—for informational purposes.\n\nThe thigh wound, Dr. Shaw said, was trivial. He said the compound fracture would heal.\n\nDr. Shaw said it would be unwise for Governor Connally to be moved in the next 10 to 14 days. Mrs. Connally was remaining at his side tonight.\n\nTour by Mrs. Kennedy Unusual\n\nMrs. Kennedy's presence near her husband's bedside at his death resulted from somewhat un­usual circumstances. She had rarely accompan­ied him on his trips about the country and had almost never made political trips with him.\n\nThe tour on which Mr. Kennedy was en­gaged yesterday and today was only quasi‐politi­cal; the only open political activity was to have been a speech tonight to a fund‐raising dinner at the state capitol in Austin.\n\nIn visiting Texas, Mr. Kennedy was seeking to improve his political fortunes in a pivotal state that he barely won in 1960. He was also hoping to patch a bitter internal dispute among Texas's Democrats.\n\nAt 8:45 A.M., when Mr. Kennedy left the Texas Hotel in Fort Worth, where he spent his last night, to address the parking lot crowd across the street, Mrs. Kennedy was not with him. There appeared to be some disappointment.\n\n“Mrs. Kennedy is organizing herself,” the President said good‐naturedly. “It takes longer, but, of course, she looks better than we do when she does it.”\n\nLater, Mrs. Kennedy appeared late at the Chamber of Commerce breakfast in Fort Worth.\n\nAgain, Mr. Kennedy took note of herpres­ence. “Two years ago,” he said, “I introduced myself in Paris by saying that I was the man who had accompanied Mrs. Kennedy to Paris. I am getting somewhat that same sensation as I travel around Texas. Nobody wonders what Lyndon and I wear.”\n\nThe speech Mr. Kennedy never delivered at the Merchandise Mart luncheon contained a passage commenting on a recent preoccupation of his, and a subject of much interest in this city, where right‐wing conservatism is the rule rather than the exception.\n\nVoices are being heard in the land, he said, “voices preaching doctrines wholly unrelated to reality, wholly unsuited to the sixties, doctrines which apparently assume that words will suffice without weapons, that vituperation is as good as victory and that peace is a sign of weakness.”\n\nThe speech went on: “At a time when the national debt is steadily being reduced in terms of its burden on our economy, they see that debt as the greatest threat to our security. At a time when we are steadily reducing the number of Federal employes serving every thousand citi­zens, they fear those supposed hordes of civil servants far more than the actual hordes of op­posing armies.\n\n“We cannot expect that everyone, to use the phrase of a decade ago, will ‘talk sense to the American people.’ But we can hope that fewer people will listen to nonsense. And the notion that this nation is headed for defeat through deficit, or that strength is but a matter of slo­gans, is nothing but just plain nonsense.”"
