    "text": "“Mrs. Kennedy is organizing herself,” the President said good‐naturedly. “It takes longer, but, of course, she looks better than we do when she does it.”\n\nLater, Mrs. Kennedy appeared late at the Chamber of Commerce breakfast in Fort Worth.\n\nAgain, Mr. Kennedy took note of herpres­ence. “Two years ago,” he said, “I introduced myself in Paris by saying that I was the man who had accompanied Mrs. Kennedy to Paris. I am getting somewhat that same sensation as I travel around Texas. Nobody wonders what Lyndon and I wear.”\n\nThe speech Mr. Kennedy never delivered at the Merchandise Mart luncheon contained a passage commenting on a recent preoccupation of his, and a subject of much interest in this city, where right‐wing conservatism is the rule rather than the exception.\n\nVoices are being heard in the land, he said, “voices preaching doctrines wholly unrelated to reality, wholly unsuited to the sixties, doctrines which apparently assume that words will suffice without weapons, that vituperation is as good as victory and that peace is a sign of weakness.”\n\nThe speech went on: “At a time when the national debt is steadily being reduced in terms of its burden on our economy, they see that debt as the greatest threat to our security. At a time when we are steadily reducing the number of Federal employes serving every thousand citi­zens, they fear those supposed hordes of civil servants far more than the actual hordes of op­posing armies.\n\n“We cannot expect that everyone, to use the phrase of a decade ago, will ‘talk sense to the American people.’ But we can hope that fewer people will listen to nonsense. And the notion that this nation is headed for defeat through deficit, or that strength is but a matter of slo­gans, is nothing but just plain nonsense.”"
