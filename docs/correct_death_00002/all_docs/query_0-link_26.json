    "text": "This was a great tour with a great guide (Dan, I believe). He was extremely informative and seemed to thoroughly enjoy imparting his knowledge, all the while driving through Dallas traffic! Because of his vivid descriptions and information as well as the fact we were driving the same route JFK took that fateful day, he made it seem as real as possible and easy to imagine. Being able to go into the rooming house LHO stayed at was an added bonus; it was like stepping into a time machine. Overall, take the tour; it's well worth it."
