        "text": "On November 21, 1963, the day before his assassination, U.S. Pres. John F. Kennedy—accompanied by his wife, Jacqueline Kennedy, and U.S. Vice Pres. Lyndon B. Johnson—undertook a two-day five-city trip to Texas. The president was warmly welcomed at his first two stops, San Antonio and Houston, as well as at Fort Worth, where the presidential party spent the night. On the morning of November 22, Kennedy and his party flew to Dallas. At Dallas’s Love Field airport, the president and the first lady boarded an open limousine to ride with Democrat Texas Gov. John B. Connally, Jr., and his wife to the president’s next stop, the Trade Mart, where the president was scheduled to deliver a speech. At 12:30 PM, President Kennedy was struck by two shots apparently fired from an open window on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository. He was rushed to nearby Parkland Memorial Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 1:00 PM. His accused killer, Lee Harvey Oswald, was arrested at 1:50 PM."
