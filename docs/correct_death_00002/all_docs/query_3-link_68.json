        "text": "Update: The National Archives on Thursday released thousands of documents related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Read the coverage, here Â»\n\nAs the longtime government explanation goes: President John F. Kennedy was assassinated on Nov. 22, 1963, by a lone gunman, Lee Harvey Oswald. Mr. Oswald fired three bullets from a nearby building, striking Mr. Kennedy and Gov. John B. Connally Jr. of Texas.\n\nBut much of the public has never fully bought that explanation. A trove of files expected to be released on Thursday, which the federal government had long fought to keep from public view, was likely to address some of the conspiracy theories that have lingered for decades.\n\nAs you dive into the documents or read news coverage, refresh your memory here on some of the people, theories and other aspects of the assassination."
