        "text": "The President of the United States has been assassinated by a gunman in Dallas, Texas.\n\nJohn F Kennedy was hit in the head and throat when three shots were fired at his open-topped car.\n\nThe presidential motorcade was travelling through the main business area of the city.\n\nTexas Governor John Connally was also seriously injured when one of the unknown sniper's bullets hit him in the back.\n\nThe men were accompanied by their wives, who were both uninjured.\n\nVice-president Lyndon Johnson - who was following in a different car - has been sworn in as the new US leader.\n\nThe presidential party was driving from Dallas airport to the city centre when witnesses said shots were fired from the window of a building overlooking the road.\n\nThe president collapsed into Jackie Kennedy's arms, who was heard to cry \"Oh no\". Seconds later Governor Connally was also hit.\n\nDallas Times Herald photographer Bob Jackson was in the motorcade close behind the Democrat leader's car and heard the shots as it entered Dealey Plaza.\n\n\"As I looked up I saw a rifle being pulled back from a window - it might have been resting on the windowsill - I didn't see a man,\" he said.\n\nMr Kennedy's limousine was driven at speed to Parklands Hospital immediately after the shooting.\n\nThe president was alive when he was admitted, but died at 1400 local time (1900 GMT) - 35 minutes after being shot.\n\nPolice and Secret Service agents stormed the School Book Depository building moments after the shots were fired and recovered a rifle with a telescopic sight, said to be the assassination weapon.\n\nThe mood of shock in the US was echoed by Senator Mike Mansfield in an emergency forum of the senate.\n\n\"This is terrible - I cannot find words,\" he said.\n\nE-mail this story to a friend"
