        "text": "Introduction\n\nAs of 2016, a majority of the world’s 30 megacities are in emerging markets.1 According to Forbes magazine,2 the term emerging market was introduced in 1981 by economists at the International Finance Corporation to promote the first mutual fund investment in developing countries. The term has been used widely since. Today, the Financial Times defines emerging market as a developing country in which investment is estimated to lead to high income but with great risk.3\n\nIn 2001, Jim O’Neill, former chairman of asset management at Goldman Sachs and current conservative government minister, identified Brazil, Russia, India, and China (BRIC) as the top tier of emerging economies at the beginning of the century.4, 5 In December 2010, South Africa was added, despite O’Neill’s disapproval. Later, O’Neill established a new tier of countries that he predicted would follow BRIC: Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea, and Turkey.4, 5, 6 Several economists at Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) tried to adapt the same strategy to group similar emerging markets. These efforts resulted in 2 new groups: Colombia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt, Turkey, and South Africa, and Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Korea, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, Turkey, and Vietnam.4"
