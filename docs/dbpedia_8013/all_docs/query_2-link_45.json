        "text": "Pfizer is committed to model-based drug development. “Phase II attrition needs to be tackled at the root causes—right from the selection of the biological target in early discovery,” says Dr. Piet van der Graaf, senior director, Pharmacometrics and Clinical Pharmacology at Pfizer. “We wanted to apply modeling and simulation in the earlier phases of drug research and bridge the gap between systems biology and pharmaco­kinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling approaches.”\n\nThe text-based interfaces of some modeling software packages can make it difficult to construct and share increasingly sophisticated models. “We had to write all the equations by hand. As our models got bigger, there were many more equations to type in, and constructing them and ensuring consistency of the units became very laborious,” says Benson. “In addition, when we needed to communicate our work with other researchers, the long list of equations was not easy for them to understand, particularly if they were not expert modelers.”\n\nProjects typically require significant preclinical laboratory investment to build confidence in an approach and subsequent clinical trials to validate hypotheses. To avoid spending millions of dollars and years of research effort on projects or approaches that cannot succeed, Pfizer wanted to be able to identify and terminate them earlier.\n\nPfizer has started to develop an integrated Systems Pharmacology approach in which researchers use tools such as MATLAB and SimBiology to model, simulate, and analyze biological systems in the earliest stages of discovery and throughout development.\n\nResearchers construct Systems Pharmacology models to answer questions about a given pathway, such as which receptors are likely to be the best targets and what concentration of drug compound is needed to achieve the required inhibition.\n\nSometimes the group bases the initial model on a published Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) model, imported directly into SimBiology and other software tools.\n\nThey next perform sensitivity analysis to identify and rank the most important targets in the model, using simulation events to model the introduction of a particular drug into the system.\n\nThey visualize results by reviewing diagnostic plots, including time course plots with and without the drug present.\n\nUsing visual interfaces, they share the model, the plots, and other simulation results with the project team for the drug, who provide parameter estimates or other input to further refine the model.\n\nOn one project, the team explored the effectiveness of using small interfering RNA (siRNA) to inhibit the IKK enzyme in the NF-kB pathway. After constructing and simulating a model with 26 species and 64 parameters, they found that the level of inhibition siRNA provided was not sufficient to achieve the needed result. Subsequent experimental results were consistent with this conclusion.\n\nPfizer is currently assembling a library of Systems Pharmacology model components that can be reused for different projects to further accelerate analysis using PK and systems biology models."
