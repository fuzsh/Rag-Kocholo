You may need to read it again.\n\nIf you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet:\n\nWhat COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 is and what it is used for\n\nWhat you need to know before you receive COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2\n\nHow COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 is given\n\nPossible side effects\n\nHow to store COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2\n\nContents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 is and what it is used for\n\nCOVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 is a vaccine used for active immunisation to prevent COVID19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\nCOVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 is given to adults and adolescents from 12 years.\n\nThe vaccine triggers the body’s natural production of antibodies and stimulates immune cells to protect against COVID-19 disease.\n\n2.

However, a mild fever or upper airway infection, like a cold, are not reasons to delay vaccination.\n\na weakened immune system, such as due to HIV infection, or are on a medicine that affects your immune system\n\na bleeding problem, bruise easily or use a medicine to inhibit blood clotting\n\nThere is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 (see section 4). These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males. Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek immediate medical attention should these occur.\n\nAs with any vaccine, COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 may not fully protect all those who receive it. No data are currently available in individuals with a weakened immune system or who are taking chronic treatment that suppresses or prevents immune responses.\n\nIf you are immunocompromised and receive an additional dose of mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2, it may still not provide full immunity to COVID-19 and you should continue to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID-19.\n\nChildren\n\nCOVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 is not recommended for children under 12 years.\n\nOther medicines and COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2\n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines or have recently received any other vaccine.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before you receive this vaccine.\n\nDriving and using machines\n\nCOVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4 ‘Possible side effects’ may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines. Do not drive or operate machinery until you are sure that you are not affected.\n\nCOVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 contains sodium and potassium\n\nThis vaccine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially ‘potassium-free’.\n\nThis vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodiumfree’.\n\n3. How COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 is given\n\nCOVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 is given after dilution as an injection of 0.3 mL into a muscle of your upper arm.\n\nYou will receive 2 injections, given at least 21 days apart.\n\nIf you receive one dose of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2, you should receive a second dose of the same vaccine at least 21 days later to complete the vaccination series. Protection against COVID-19 disease may not be maximally effective until at least 7 days after the second dose.\n\nA third injection may be given at least 8 weeks after the second injection if advised by your doctor. This may also be if your first two doses were with another COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all vaccines, COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nMost side effects are mild or moderate and go away within a few days of appearing. If side effects such as pain and/or fever are troublesome, they can be treated by medicines for pain and fever such as paracetamol.\n\nSide effects may occur with following frequencies:\n\nVery common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people\n\ninjection site: pain, swelling\n\ntiredness\n\nheadache\n\nmuscle pain\n\nchills\n\njoint pain\n\ndiarrhoea\n\nfever\n\nCommon: may affect up to 1 in 10 people\n\nredness at injection site\n\nnausea\n\nvomiting\n\nUncommon: may affect up to 1 in 100 people\n\nenlarged lymph nodes\n\nfeeling unwell\n\narm pain\n\ninsomnia\n\ninjection site itching\n\nallergic reactions such as rash or itching\n\nfeeling weak or lack of energy/sleepy\n\ndecreased appetite\n\nexcessive sweating\n\nnight sweats\n\nRare side effects: may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people\n\ntemporary one sided facial drooping\n\nallergic reactions such as hives or swelling of the face\n\nVery rare side effects: may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people\n\ninflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) or inflammation of the lining outside the heart (pericarditis) which can result in breathlessness, palpitations or chest pain\n\nNot known (cannot be estimated from the available data)\n\nsevere allergic reaction\n\nextensive swelling of the vaccinated limb\n\nswelling of the face (swelling of the face may occur in patients who have had facial dermatological fillers)\n\na skin reaction that causes red spots or patches on the skin, that may look like a target or “bulls-eye” with a dark red centre surrounded by paler red rings (erythema multiforme)\n\nSome people have reported a sudden feeling of cold with shivering/shaking accompanied by a rise in temperature, possibly with sweating, headache (including migraine-like headaches), nausea, muscle aches and feeling unwell, starting within a day of having the vaccine and usually lasting for a day or two.\n\nIf your fever is high and lasts longer than three days, or you have other persistent symptoms, this might not be due to side effects of the vaccine and you should seek appropriate medical advice according to your symptoms.\n\nReporting of side effects\n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. If you are concerned about a side-effect it can be reported directly via the Coronavirus Yellow Card reporting site or search for MHRA Yellow Card in the Google Play. When completing a report please include the vaccine brand and batch/Lot number if available.\n\nAlternatively, side effects of concern in association with Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine BNT 162b2 can be reported to Pfizer Medical Information on 01304 616161 or via Pfizer Safety Reporting.\n\nPlease do not report the same side effect(s) to both systems as all reports will be shared between Pfizer and MHRA (in an anonymized form) and dual reporting will create unnecessary duplicates.\n\nBy reporting side effects, you can help provide more information on the safety of this vaccine.\n\n5. How to store COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2\n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the box and label after EXP.\n\nThe expiry date refers to the last day of that month.\n\nStore in freezer at -80 °C to -60 °C.\n\nStore in the original package in order to protect from light.\n\nAfter thawing, the vaccine should be diluted and administered by a healthcare professional and used within 6 hours.
