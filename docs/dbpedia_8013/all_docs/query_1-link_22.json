        "meta_description": "Objectives Patient and public involvement (PPI) in clinical research has a well-established infrastructure in the UK, and while there has been good progress within pharmaceutical-industry-sponsored research, further improvements are still needed. This review aims to share learnings from quality assessments of historical PPI projects within Pfizer UK to inform future projects and drive PPI progress in the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nDesign and setting Internal assessments of Pfizer UK PPI projects were conducted to identify all relevant projects across the medicines development continuum between 2017 and 2021. Five sample projects were developed into case studies.\n\nOutcome measure Retrospective quality assessments were performed using the Patient Focused Medicines Development (PFMD) Patient Engagement Quality Guidance (PEQG) tool. Recommendations for improvement were developed.\n\nResults Retrospective case study analysis and quality framework assessment revealed benefits of PPI to both Pfizer UK and to external partners, as well as challenges and learnings to improve future practice. Recommendations for improvement based on these findings focused on processes and procedures for PPI, group dynamics and diversity for PPI activities, sharing of expertise, the importance of bidirectional and timely feedback, and the use of understandable language in materials.\n\nConclusions PPI in medicines development is impactful and beneficial but is still being optimised in the pharmaceutical industry. Using the PFMD PEQG tool to define gaps, share learnings and devise recommendations for improvement helps to ensure that PPI is genuine and empowering, rather than tokenistic. Ultimately, these recommendations should be acted on to further embed PPI as an integral part of medicines development and health research within the pharmaceutical industry. This article includes a plain language summary in the supplement.\n\nData are available upon reasonable request. Additional data beyond what are provided in the supplement may be made available upon reasonable request to the authors.",

        "text": "Discussion\n\nThis work was carried out from a multistakeholder perspective, with direct learnings from a pharmaceutical company. Most PPI assessment carried out internally by companies and institutions is rarely shared with the wider community. The initial scoping literature review prior to this work discovered limited published pharmaceutical company experience, with 20.4% of the relevant literature originating from the pharmaceutical industry, demonstrating the need for sharing and reporting of industry findings in the PPI space.\n\nThis work therefore recognised from the outset the importance of communicating internal findings and aimed to share learnings from the selected projects, which will provide additional material to the existing literature and improve the PPI knowledge base in a practical way. This review identified some expected challenges, such as the difficulty of addressing and achieving true inclusion and diversity. It also highlighted organisational constraints often associated with the complicated procedures that global pharmaceutical companies have owing to the nature of their activities,33 noting that not all research timelines are conducive to undertaking suitable outreach activities. This work demonstrated that Pfizer is currently involving patients and carers in many different areas across the medicines development continuum, but there is room for improvement. In the assessed projects, external partners were not involved early on enough in the process to have maximal impact on medicines development, limiting the value they could provide. In the authors’ view, these organisational barriers may, in part, be due to delays to starting research when pharmaceutical companies collaborate with external organisations, detracting from the time available.33 It could also be due to a lack of understanding within pharmaceutical companies of the value of PPI during these early stages and the need to manage shareholder expectations,34 or it could be due to the global nature of many pharmaceutical companies, meaning that much of the early preclinical and clinical research is conducted outside of the UK.35 36 For example, regulatory requirements may mean that not all proposed changes are feasible. However, regardless of the stage of PPI, it is the depth and scope of the involvement, as well as honesty and transparency in managing expectations, that will ensure quality and meaningfulness, with meaningful PPI being characterised by providing relevant opportunities to contribute to and have a tangible impact on research.\n\nThere are differences in motivations, practices and outcomes of PPI when comparing non-profit and for-profit organisations; these differences can affect how PPI is embedded and developed, and how it is perceived as meaningful. When asked to reflect on and compare experiences of involvement in non-profit versus for-profit environments, our external partners felt that in PPI activities organised by non-profit institutions, people may contribute time and effort for altruistic reasons, and may not always be driven by an offer of financial compensation. These organisations are typically valued and trusted more by the public, whereas for-profit organisations may not be perceived in the same way. PPI activities driven by for-profit organisations may, in some cases, be less impactful, for example, when PPI is not sufficiently considered at all stages of research. Non-profit and for-profit organisations can learn from each other’s PPI practices and collaborate on activities, such as through cross-funding on a grassroots level to establish ‘profit for purpose’ approaches. Cross-industry collaborations can also help to bust myths or assumptions about each other. In terms of defining meaningfulness, our external partners also felt that when PPI is done in a limited or prescribed way, it risks becoming tokenistic, for example, when used solely as a requirement to secure funding or approval. The answer is to strike a balance—involve external partners in all stages of research and in a variety of activities, including contributing to performing research and interpreting results, when possible. PPI is an essential ingredient for furthering science and clinical research and improving health outcomes for communities, and rationale and accountability matter in ensuring quality and meaningfulness. For example, rationales for embedding PPI may come from different places, from wanting to understand impactful best practices through to simply meeting requirements. However, as long as the result is that PPI is fully embedded at an involvement level and not just at an engagement level, its inherent value should become clearly demonstrated over time in terms of outcomes, although the measure of the benefit will vary across organisations, countries and disease areas. Pharmaceutical research has historically been an inaccessible field for external partners, so PPI is an important tool for improving collaboration and understanding between parties and making people aware of how they can positively impact research.\n\nFrom the perspective of our external partners, there are also considerations to be mindful of in terms of how external partners are given a seat at the PPI table, whether they are explicitly invited or whether they have requested to have their voice heard. Our external partners felt that those who are invited to the table may be afraid of voicing criticism and unpopular opinions for fear of offending the people they have been invited by, and thus not being invited to future consultations. On the other hand, those who apply for a place at the table are likely to be more critical and honest, and thus make more insightful contributions. In addition to how external partners reach the table in general, it also matters which table they are at and under what terms they are at it. If the table is just an echo chamber with no impact on strategy or output, it does not matter how the external partners got there if there is no meaningful effect. This needs to be given thought and consideration and, ultimately, the goal is to inspire and influence a world in which voices are being heard, and collaboration between for-profit and non-profit organisations is a key way that this can be achieved.\n\nThis work highlighted that future projects should clarify the shared purpose between stakeholders and have clear roles and responsibilities designated to each from the outset. It is helpful to explain why PPI is being sought and to convey this in an enthusiastic and collaborative way to inspire maximum engagement. Ensuring PPI work is carried out in friendly, approachable and familiar environments allows people to feel empowered and engaged.37 Familiar environments could be supported by virtual engagements38 and by working collaboratively with external organisations, such as patient organisations in which people are likely to already feel comfortable.39 40 The need for trust and rapport is vital, especially when public trust in the pharmaceutical industry may be low.41 Trustworthiness should be established early on in the PPI process, through collaborative ways of working and mutual respect; contributors need to have the value of their input recognised by being thanked and given the opportunity to provide feedback in a timely manner. This was evidenced in this work, in which external partners commented on the positive benefits of working with a pharmaceutical company and felt their opinion was truly important and that pharmaceutical companies were listening to patients and families. Through PPI activities and continuous sharing of learnings, patients, carers and patient organisations are able to gain a general understanding into pharmaceutical companies’ approaches and vice versa. Such dialogues and interactions may even help to dispel preconceived notions each party may have about the other.42 Accessible language and formats of materials are vital when establishing rapport and engagement. It is important to be mindful of being accessible without being patronising. Language is an important enabler of meaningful involvement, but can also create barriers.43 In recognition of this, a glossary of terms was developed to supplement this paper (online supplemental appendix 9). Health literacy principles should be embedded into materials development; Pfizer is implementing robust staff training for health literacy and expects its principles to be applied throughout the conception, development and approval of health information materials. Furthermore, relevant UK contracts are being rewritten to be more easily understood and aligned with the health literacy and readability needs of the public; other documentation is also being reviewed to improve the understandability and accessibility of information. Accordingly, informative pre-read materials that are provided to people must be carefully considered in terms of format and content to ensure information is conveyed in a way that is accessible to the target audience. Useful formats can include PowerPoint slides and PDFs, but there is scope to use more imaginative and novel formats when suitable, particularly when engaging with young people.44–46"
