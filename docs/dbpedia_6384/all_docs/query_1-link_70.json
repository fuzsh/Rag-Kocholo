        "text": "How to nominate for an Award, Medal or Prize\n\nThe Society presents several awards, medals and prizes as part of its remit to support and encourage scientists working in the fields of astronomy and geophysics. Some are aimed at young scientists, while others recognise many years of dedicated service to our sciences. Please note the Society encourages nominations that reflect diversity in our community.\n\nAnyone can make a nomination. It is not necessary to be a Fellow of the Society. All nominations are made in strict confidence; nominees should not be informed of submissions in order to avoid unnecessary disappointment. This does not apply to Education and Outreach Awards (see individual Award descriptions). Click on each Award, Medal or Prize for further information.\n\nGuidance for nominators:\n\nCase for support\n\nThe panel would find it helpful if more general information on the nomineeâ€™s contributions to the community could be included in the case for support. For example, mentoring, public engagement work, leadership, committee/panel service, etc. The panel appreciates that such activity will vary according to the career stage of the nominee.\n\nCurriculum Vitae\n\nThe CV should be no longer than 4 pages long. If the CV is not in the public domain, please ensure that you have the nominee's permission to pass on to a third party. Please note that not all award nominations require CVs or publication lists. See particular awards pages for details.\n\nKey Publications List\n\nPlease only list the top 10 publications. Please note that not all award nominations require CVs or publication lists. See particular awards pages for details.\n\nReferees\n\nPlease ensure you have contacted the referees and that they agree to write a letter of support. They will receive an automated email from us once the nomination has been submitted.\n\nLectureships\n\nGeorge Darwin Lecture\n\nGerald Whitrow Lecture\n\nHarold Jeffreys Lecture\n\nJames Dungey Lecture\n\nWe would remind you that if you are nominating in this category the awards panels would like to see evidence that the nominee is an authoritative and engaging speaker. Where available please provide links to previous talks.\n\nClosing dates for awards:"
