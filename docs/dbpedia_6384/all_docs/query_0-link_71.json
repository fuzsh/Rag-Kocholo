Previously she was Science Director at ATP Capital, a New York venture capital firm that invested in companies developing agricultural biotechnologies. Focusing on technology and intellectual property, she helped to build and manage a portfolio of companies involved in forestry biotechnology, transcriptome and proteome analysis, small molecule discovery, and embryonic stem cells. As a postdoc, Diana was a National Science Foundation fellow and Zeneca Plant Science fellow at the Rockefeller University. She received her Ph.D. in biochemistry and molecular biology from Northwestern University. A year spent conducting research on maize and millet production in southern Africa at the Department of Agricultural Research in Botswana helped drive her ambition for making science reach impact in the field."
