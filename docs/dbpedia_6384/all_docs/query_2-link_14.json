        "text": "Prof. Sir David Baulcombe's group was the first to identify small interfering (si)RNAs as the specificity determinant of RNA silencing and through their genetic analyses have identified many components of RNA silencing pathways. Relevant to this application the group has unravelled many aspects of the role of RNA silencing in virus defense and other aspects of genetic and epigenetic regulation. His work has been recognised through several awards including the 2008 Lasker Award for Basic Medical Science, the 2010 Wolf Prize for Agriculture and the 2012 Balzan Prize for Epigenetics."
