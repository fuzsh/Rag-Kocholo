The participants make predictions for potential winners in different fields, such as physiology and medicine, chemistry, and physics. They also mention predictions from other sources.\n\nRelated to Who Will Win the 2015 Nobel Prize in Science?\n\n1. What is the Nobel Prize?\n\nThe Nobel Prize is an international award given to individuals or organizations who have made outstanding contributions to humanity in the fields of physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, peace, and economics. It was established in 1895 by Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel and is considered one of the most prestigious awards in the world.\n\n2. How are the Nobel Prize winners chosen?\n\nThe Nobel Prize winners are chosen by various committees of the Nobel Foundation, based on nominations from qualified individuals such as professors, scientists, and past Nobel Prize laureates. The committees then review and select the most deserving candidates for each category.\n\n3. When will the 2015 Nobel Prize winners be announced?\n\nThe Nobel Prize winners for 2015 were announced in October of that year. The exact date varies each year but is typically announced in early October, with the award ceremony taking place on December 10th, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death.\n\n4. Who are some potential candidates for the 2015 Nobel Prize?\n\nThere are many potential candidates for the 2015 Nobel Prize, as it is a highly competitive and prestigious award. Some notable scientists and researchers who may have been considered for the prize include: Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna for their work on CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, Rino Rappuoli for his contributions to vaccine development, and John B. Goodenough, Stanley Whittingham, and Akira Yoshino for their work on lithium-ion batteries.\n\n5. How accurate are Nobel Prize predictions?\n\nNobel Prize predictions are difficult to accurately predict as the selection process is highly confidential. However, some predictions are made based on the impact and significance of a candidate's work and their reputation in the scientific community. While these predictions are not always accurate, they can give an indication of potential candidates who may be considered for the prize."
