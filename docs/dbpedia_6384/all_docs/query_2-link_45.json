The prize comes with an award of 750,000 euros. The proteomics pioneer also received the 2012 Ernst Schering Prize worth 50,000 euros and awarded by the Schering Foundation Berlin. US National Academy of Sciences George Coupland from the Max-Planck- Institute for Plant Breeding Research in Cologne, Germany, was elected a foreign associate of the US National Academy of Sciences this year. Millennium Technology Prize Technology Academy Finland EMBO Member Shinya Yamanaka and Linus Torvalds are joint Grand Winners of the 2012 Millennium Technology Prize, one of the world’s major technology prizes. The Japanese scientist received it in recognition of his discovery of a new method to develop induced pluripotent stem cells for medical research. The prize worth 1,2 million euros was split between the two researchers and presented by the president of the Republic of Finland last June. EMBO YOUNG INVESTIGATORS ASCB Women in Cell Biology award American Society of Cell Biology Sophie Martin from the University of Lausanne, Switzerland, is the winner of the 2012 ASCB Women in Cell Biology Junior award. The prize recognizes female scien- tists in an early stage of their careers who make exceptional scientific contributions to cell biology, develop a strong independent research program, and exhibit the potential for continuing a high level of scientific endeavour and leadership. She will receive the award at the ASCB annual meeting in San Francisco, United States, in December 2012. Appointments EMBO MEMBER The Gulbenkian Science Institute in Oeiras, Portugal, announced the appointment of EMBO Member Jonathan Howard as its new director as of 1 October 2012. He succeeds António Coutinho, who stepped Balzan Prize International Balzan Prize Foundation David Baulcombe of the University of Cambridge, United Kingdom, received the prize for his work on the epigenetic effects of stress on plant cells and tissue. Baulcombe says the prize of 750,000 Swiss Francs (approximately 620,000 euros) will help start a new line of epigenetic research into algae. The Italy-based International Balzan Prize Foundation annually funds research awards for scholars, scientists, and artists who it considers to have been overlooked by other prestigious awards. Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award Lasker Foundation This year’s Lasker Award for basic medical research goes to EMBO Associate Member Ronald Vale and his colleagues Michael Sheetz and James Spudich for discoveries concerning cytoskeletal motor proteins, machines that move cargoes within cells, contract muscles, and enable cell move- ments. The Lasker Awards, which carry an honorarium of 250,000 US dollars for each category, were presented at a ceremony in New York City last September. ASBMB-Merck Award American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology / Merck Vivek Malhotra of the Centre for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona, Spain, received the ASBMB-Merck Award for Studies on the mechanism of secretory cargo sorting and transport carrier biogenesis during conventional and unconventional protein secretion. EACR Cancer Researcher Award Lecture European Association for Cancer Research / Pezcoller Foundation Eric So from King’s College London, United Kingdom, is the winner of this award that recognizes academic excellence in the field of cancer research. He is the first recipient of this award worth 10.000 euros. He gave the Pezcoller Foundation – EACR Award Lecture at the biennial congress of EACR, which this year was held in Barcelona. The primary goal of Eric So’s research is to char- acterize the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation that are corrupted in leukemia. down after 14 years as the institute’s direc- tor. Howard, a prominent British immu- nologist, is also a professor at the Institute of Genetics of the University of Cologne. ￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼Editorial ￼Managing Editor Barry Whyte Editor Yvonne Kaul proofreading Meryl Schneider print layout Uta Mackensen Web version Aditya Kusuma Jati E-newsletter Sandra Krahl, Katja Linssen ￼￼￼￼￼￼￼©2012 EMBO EMBOencounters | Autumn 2012 | communications@embo.org 19"
