        "text": "Professor Dennis Lo Yuk-ming from the Chinese University of Hong Kong has been awarded the Royal Medal for his outstanding achievements in biological sciences, the first Chinese scientist to receive the prestigious award in 200 years.\n\nThe medal is one of the most prestigious awards to be given out by the Royal Society, which was founded in 1660 and is the oldest scientific academy in continuous existence.\n\nThe Royal Society had highly commended Lo for making a major impact on prenatal diagnosis by discovering fetal DNA in women who were expecting, developing non-invasive prenatal testing and contributions to the testing of other types of body fluids.\n\nHis scientific achievements led to the development of non-invasive prenatal diagnostic tests for multiple genetic diseases such as Down syndrome.\n\nThe first Chinese Royal Medal recipient in biological sciences said he is delighted and encouraged to have his work on circulating fetal DNA, development of non-invasive prenatal testing and other body fluid tests recognized by the Royal Society.\n\n\"I am also humbled when I look at the list of distinguished past winners of this award. I wouldn't have developed the non-invasive prenatal diagnostic test without the support of my devoted team. I am grateful for all the inspiration, support and company from my family, mentors, colleagues, students and friends,\" he said.\n\nLo hopes this award can help draw young people's attention to science and learn that it can be fun and have an impact.\n\n\"The future of science depends on our ability to attract the best minds of our next generation into science, and join us in our quest for the next scientific breakthrough,\" he said.\n\nAdrian Smith, president of the Royal Society, said: \"Through its medals and awards, the Royal Society recognizes those researchers and science communicators who have played a critical part in expanding our understanding of the world around us. These discoveries shape our societies, answer fundamental questions and open new avenues for exploration.\"\n\nJoining CUHK in 1997, Lo is now the director of the Li Ka Shing Institute of Health Sciences, associate dean of research and chairman of the department of chemical pathology at the university.\n\nLo is known as \"the father of non-invasive prenatal testing.\"\n\nThe non-invasive prenatal test for Down syndrome developed by Lo and his team has been widely adopted in dozens of countries.\n\nSince 1825, two Royal Medals have been awarded annually for the most important contributions to the advancement of natural knowledge in physical and biological sciences.\n\nA third medal has been awarded annually to scientists who made big contributions in applied science from 1965.\n\nThere have been 400 recipients in history, including Charles Darwin, who proposed the theory of evolution, and John Dalton, who developed the atomic theory.\n\nAbout one fifth of the recepients are also on the list of Nobel laureates since the launch of the Nobel Prize in 1901."
