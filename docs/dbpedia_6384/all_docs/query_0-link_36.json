After pioneering Ph.D. studies determining the sequence of methionine transfer RNA, using the sequencing methods that had just been developed by Fred Sanger, her post-doctoral studies at the University of Geneva focused on sequence analysis of R17 phage RNA a model messenger RNA. Cory returned to Melbourne in 1971 to The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute (WEHI) with her scientific and life partner, Jerry M Adams. During the first few years, Cory and Adams discovered 5' caps on mammalian messenger RNAs, helped to introduce gene cloning technology in Australia, and addressed a central puzzle regarding the immune response: how does the body make the myriad antibodies needed to fight diverse infectious agents? Their laboratory helped uncover the astonishing solution: antibody genes are encoded as bits and pieces which can combine in a myriad ways, thereby creating much greater diversity with which to fight infection. In 1981, their attention turned to the nature of the genetic accidents that cause cancer. Their laboratory showed that damage to chromosomes can activate cancer-promoting genes. They tracked down the mutation which activates the oncogene MYC and leads to Burkitt's lymphoma, a malignancy of antibody-producing cells. In collaboration with Alan Harris, they then engineered novel lines of lymphoma-prone mice, to study the early stages of disease and test for synergistic mutations. The current focus of their research is how cells decide whether to live or die. This program was launched in 1988 by the seminal finding of David Vaux in their laboratory that BCL-2, the gene responsible for follicular lymphoma, promotes cell survival. This discovery opened an entirely new way of thinking about cancer development, since all other oncogenes (cancer-causing genes) had been found to promote cell proliferation. The BCL-2 gene proved to have numerous relatives, and some actually promote cell death (apoptosis) rather than cell survival. Cory and Adams were leaders in a major program at the Hall Institute directed to understanding how apoptosis is controlled, influences normal development and contributes to cancer and other diseases. This knowledge led to a research collaboration agreement between WEHI and US companies Genentech and Abbot Laboratories (now AbbVie) to develop BH3 mimetics, drugs that mimic the action of the natural triggers of apoptosis by binding to and blocking the action of BCL-2 and other pro-cell survival relatives. Venetoclax, the FDA-approved anti-BCL-2 drug developed during this collaboration is having major success in treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia and other lymphoid malignancies.\n\nMain publications\n\nAdams, J.M. and Cory, S., Modified nucleosides and bizarre 5'-termini in mouse myeloma rnRNA, Nature, 255, pp. 28-33 (1975); Cory, S. and Adams, J.M., Deletions are associated with somatic rearrangement of immunoglobulin heavy chain genes, Cell, 19, pp. 37-51 (1980); Adams, J.M., Gerondakis, S., Webb, E., Corcoran, L.M. and Cory, S., Cellular myconcogene is altered by chromosome translocation to an immunoglobulin locus in murine plasmacytomas and rearranged similarly in Burkitt lymphomas of man, Proc.
