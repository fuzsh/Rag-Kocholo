        "text": "The Gruber Foundation at Yale has awarded three International Prizes honoring individuals for their groundbreaking work in the sciences.\n\nThe Gruber Foundation was established at Yale to honor and encourage excellence in the fields of cosmology, genetics, neuroscience, justice, and women’s rights. It has continued the International Prize Program of The Peter and Patricia Gruber Foundation, founded by the philanthropists in 1993 as the Peter Gruber Foundation. Considered among the most prestigious awards in the sciences, the foundation’s $500,000 International Prizes honor individuals whose groundbreaking work provides new models that inspire and enable fundamental shifts in knowledge.\n\nThe recipients of the 2014 Gruber Prizes are:\n\nCosmology: Jaan Einasto, Tartu Observatory, Estonia; Kenneth Freeman, the Mount Stromlo Observatory of the Australian National University in Canberra; R. Brent Tully, the University of Hawaii; and Sidney van den Bergh, retired, formerly of the University of Toronto and the National Research Council of Canada’s Dominion Astrophysical Observatory. Read more about the prize recipients’ work.\n\nGenetics: Victor Ambros, professor of molecular medicine at the University of Massachusetts; David Baulcombe, professor of botany at the University of Cambridge; and Gary Ruvkun, professor of genetics at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Read more about the prize recipients’ work.\n\nNeuroscience: Thomas Jessell, the Claire Tow Professor of Motor Neuron Disorders in the Departments of Neuroscience and of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics at Columbia University. Read more about the prize recipient’s work.\n\nThe Gruber Program for Global Justice and Women’s Rights now promotes the missions of the former Justice and Women’s Rights Prizes administered by Yale Law School. The Gruber Foundation, in partnership with preeminent science organizations, funds young scientist awards in the three science fields, as well as the Gruber Science Fellowship at Yale."
