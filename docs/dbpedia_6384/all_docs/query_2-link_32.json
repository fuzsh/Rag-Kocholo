His main field of study is black holes, and he is the originator of the concept of the 'black hole shadow'. In 2019, Falcke announced the first Event Horizon Telescope results at the EHT Press Conference in Brussels.\n\nFalcke obtained a PhD degree in Astronomy summa cum laude in 1994 from the University of Bonn. He subsequently worked as a scientist for the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn (1995–1995), the University of Maryland (1995–1997), and the University of Arizona (1999). He was conferred a Habilitation by the University of Bonn in 2000. From 2000 to 2003, he was a staff scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn. In 2003, Falcke became adjunct professor of Radio Astronomy and Astroparticle physics at Radboud University Nijmegen. He also started working for ASTRON, the radio astronomy institute of the Netherlands. In 2007, he became a full professor at Nijmegen.\n\nFalcke is involved in theoretical astronomy as well as observational and experimental studies. He was one of the leading forces behind the radio telescope LOFAR and pioneered radio detections of cosmic particles.\n\nIn 2000 he predicted it would be possible to make measurements near the edge of a black hole. Four years later, his team managed to do that.\n\nDorthe Dahl-Jensen, born 8 September 1958 in Copenhagen, Denmark, is a Danish palaeoclimatology professor and researcher at the Centre for Ice and Climate at the Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen in Denmark and the Centre for Earth Observation Sciences at the University of Manitoba in Canada. Her primary field is the study of ice and climate, specifically the reconstruction of climate records from ice cores and borehole data; ice flow models to date ice cores; continuum mechanical properties of anisotropic ice; ice in the solar system; and the history and evolution of the Greenland Ice Sheet.\n\nDahl-Jensen has an M.Sc. In Geophysics (1984) and a Ph.D. in Geophysics (1988) from the University of Copenhagen. As a student in 1980, Dahl-Jensen took part in ice-core drilling at the Dye 3 site on the Greenland ice sheet, a project led by Willi Dansgaard. Although Dansgaard had a rule that no women were allowed at the drilling site, he allowed Dahl-Jensen to participate. She was hired by Copenhagen's Niels Bohr Institute as an associate professor in 1997; in 2007, she became head of its Centre for Ice and Climate. In 2018 she also became a Canada Excellence Research Chair at the University of Manitoba.\n\nShe has the Order of the Dannebrog, Knight 1st Class, is a member of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters, and also won the BBVA Frontiers Knowledge Award for Climate Change in 2024.\n\nBorn in Barcelona, 1939.

He then taught for three years in Cameroon as a replacement for then compulsory military service. In the early 1980s, while working on his doctorat d'État (habilitation thesis), he performed the Bell test experiments that showed that Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen's putative reductio ad absurdum of quantum mechanics, namely that it implied 'ghostly action at a distance', did in fact appear to be realized even when the measurements on two photons were separated by a so-called space-like interval, i.e., could influence each other only by an interaction travelling faster than light (see EPR paradox and Aspect's experiment). He defended his 'doctorat d'État' in 1983 at Institut d’Optique - Université Paris-Sud (today part of Paris-Saclay University). From 1985 to 1992 he worked with Claude Cohen-Tannoudji, Jean Dalibard and Christophe Salomon on laser cooling of atoms (Nobel prize 1997).
