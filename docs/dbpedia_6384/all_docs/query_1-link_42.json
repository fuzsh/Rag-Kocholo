        "text": "Floating Gate Neural Network Memory Cells My research in the early 1990s appears to have become relevant again!! I got my Ph.D. many years ago and, aside from teaching as an adjunct, I have worked in industry ever since. I recently have gone back to doing research part time with university colleagues (in the brain science area) and they eventually asked what I did for my Ph.D. research. I mentioned that I did work on floating gate memories for analog neural networks but never continued work in that area post-graduation. My hope was to create a true analog neural network with floating gates. Since most of the “flash” memory technologies used proprietary processes, I thought that if it could be done with a standard process it might jump start university research in that area. At the time of my work in the late 80s and 90s there was a spark of interest in neural networks. I felt it would be important to have small memory cells to support analog neural network chips. (If I were to continue in academics, my next step was to create a method of programming so that the analog memory could be considered a “standard cell” for others to used in integrated neural networks.) It seems like the interest in neural networks slowly died, basically because there was not enough compute power to implement real time networks that could do useful things. Here we are now in the 2020s with Nvidia chips and now the same sort of work has been re-branded as Machine Learning (presumably to avoid the negative connotation that Neural Networks developed years ago??) My research colleagues informed me of a contemporary researcher that has been working in the area of floating gates. I’m excited that it is making my efforts back then be relevant again. (I had feared they would have been ignored forever.) Here is a paper I wrote with my advisor (unfortunately it is copyrighted by the IEEE so I can’t post it). Durfee, D.A., and F.S. Shoucair. “Comparison of Floating Gate Neural Network Memory Cells in Standard VLSI CMOS Technology.” IEEE transactions on neural networks 3.3 (1992): 347–353. Web. The person who has given new life to this work is Dr. Jennifer Hasler <jennifer.hasler@ece.gatech.edu> https://lnkd.in/dGv9wRDh David Durfee ddurfee@baycomp.com\n\nGemini: A Multimodal AI Assistant for Research? Ever since I had to scour the internet for papers that were relevant to my research, I have been looking around for a digital research assistant. An application or assistant that can get me all the relevant research papers, and more importantly, not miss any of the extremely relevant ones. Going through scientific literature is one of the most tedious tasks that are part of the research journey. If we can take that part out of the entire journey, the process of research will become even more optimized, leading to more quality research in all fields. I have gone through a lot of amazing AI products that are specially built for this very task. And they are quite good and have a significant impact on the research community. But now with the launch of Gemini by Google DeepMind, the limelight seems to be shifting. Its multimodality makes it a prime candidate for a digital research assistant. Perhaps, the entire research establishment can build a single utility application that uses the Gemini Ultra for all your research assistance. It is amazing how AI is revolutionizing all aspects of human innovation and scientific discovery. Overall, Gemini presents a promising future for digital research assistants. Its strengths in multimodality and large-scale processing offer significant advantages for navigating complex scientific information. However, specialized models trained for research assistance might still have an edge in terms of specificity and interpretability. Ultimately, the effectiveness of Gemini in this field will depend on its continued development, user feedback, and potential collaboration with researchers and developers of specialized models. It's an exciting time to be alive and witness how AI is revolutionizing scientific discovery. The potential for Gemini to contribute to this advancement is significant, and its impact on the research community will be worth watching closely.
