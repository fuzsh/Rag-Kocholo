        "text": "Congratulations to Professor Sir Colin Humphreys CBE FREng FRS CEng FIMMM who has been awarded the Royal Society's Royal Medal\n\nEach year two medals are awarded for the most important contributions to the advancement of ‘natural knowledge’ in the physical and biological sciences respectively. A third medal is awarded for distinguished contributions in the applied sciences.\n\nSpeaking about the award Sir Colin said, ‘I’m delighted, surprised and very honoured to be awarded the Royal Medal of the Royal Society. I am humbled at seeing previous recipients, such as Michael Faraday, Charles Darwin and Peter Hirsch. I have been fortunate in having wonderful colleagues, post-docs and students at the Universities of Oxford, Liverpool, Cambridge and now Queen Mary University of London, who have contributed hugely to my research in advanced materials.’\n\nSir Colin Humphreys CBE FREng FRS received the award for excelling in basic and applied science, university-industry collaboration, technology development and transfer, academic leadership, promotion of public understanding of science, and advising on science to public bodies.\n\nRoyal Medals are awarded on behalf of the Queen each year and have been issued annually since 1825. Previous recipients include Francis Crick, Mary Lyon and Fred Sanger.\n\nColin is a past President of IOM3 and was the recipient of the IOM3 Platinum medal in 2013 and Rosenhain Medal in 1989. He himself has an IOM3 award named after him - the Sir Colin Humphreys Education Award for contributions to enhancing students' scientific or technological literacy."
