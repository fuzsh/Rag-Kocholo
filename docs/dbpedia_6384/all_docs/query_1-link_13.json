        "text": "Our president, Professor Dame Carol Robinson FRSC FMedSci FRS has been awarded the Royal Society's Royal Medal, for her pioneering work on structural biology improving the understanding of proteins, their interactions and functional regulation.\n\nThe Royal Medals, also known as the Queen’s Medals, are one of the Royal Society’s most prestigious awards and are made on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen each year, on the recommendation of the Council of the Society. Frederick Sanger, Max Perutz and Francis Crick are among those who have previously been awarded a Royal Medal.\n\nThe Royal Medals were founded by His Majesty King George IV in 1825. Between 1826 and 1964 two medals were awarded each year. In 1965 the third medal, covering the applied sciences, was introduced on behalf of Her Majesty The Queen.\n\nProfessor Robinson said: \"I am truly delighted to be acknowledged with this award. Over the years, I have watched a number of Royal Society Medal Award ceremonies and have always been very impressed by the recipients. I am delighted to be joining this distinguished crowd.\"\n\nProfessor Tom Welton MBE FRSC, our president-elect, said: \"Congratulations to Carol on this fantastic news. To receive the Queen’s Medal is really a fitting recognition of the importance of her pioneering scientific achievements, throughout her career.\"\n\nSir Venki Ramakrishnan, President of the Royal Society, said: \"The Royal Society gives an array of medals and awards to scientists who have done exceptional, ground-breaking work. This year, it is again a pleasure to see these awards bestowed on scientists who have made such distinguished and far-reaching contributions in their fields. I congratulate and thank them for their efforts.\""
