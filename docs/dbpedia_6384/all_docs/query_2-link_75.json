A new study from the Department of Plant Sciences has found that these two vital resources may soon be in conflict with one another, as the regions of the world suitable for growing crops shift northwards.

He also clenched a bronze at the 2023 World Rowing Championships in the PR3 Mix4+ (PR3 mixed coxed four), securing Germany’s Paris 2024 berth alongside crewmates Susanne Lackner, Marc Lembeck, Kathrin Marchand and cox Inga Thoene. In 2022, Jan was named in the German Paralympic Team of the Year, the highest honour the International Paralympic Committee can bestow upon athletes at the national level. Paralympic Rowing kicks off in Paris on Friday 30 August from 9.50am (UK time) with Jan set to compete in the PR3 Mix2x. An alumnus of Trinity Hall, Jan is currently pursuing a PhD in Department of Engineering at the University of Cambridge, working in the Institute for Manufacturing (IfM), University of Cambridge’s Cyber-Human Lab, where he researches the integration and benefits of digital humanoid avatars in a work context. Wishing you the very best of luck, Jan! 🙌 📷 German Rowing / Jet Photographic / World Rowing #CambridgeAlumni #CambridgeUniversity #Paralympics\n\nCambridge Children's Hospital can now begin the process of appointing a contractor to start building the new facility in 2026 🏥 Following approval from HM Treasury and the Department of Health and Social Care, this is a major step forward to making the East of England's first specialist children's hospital a reality. The new hospital is being co-designed with the help of children, young people, families and healthcare professionals across the region to ensure it will meet the needs of patients, families and staff. The Cambridge Children’s Hospital project is a partnership between Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust (CPFT), and the University of Cambridge.

Meaning all species face the same challenge: how do you protect the integrity of the genome? How does an organism live for centuries, avoiding the constant corruption of mutations? By analysing DNA and its mutations in many contexts, scientists can learn how different species have solved these universal problems. 🎨 Dr Alex Cagan – illustrator, geneticist and explorer of animal DNA – is offering a new perspective on the tapestry of life. His work has profound implications for the pursuit of healthy ageing and the possibilities of cancer resistance. “Do our bodies have the capacity to better protect certain cells from DNA damage? Or do some cells have vastly superior mechanisms to repair damage? If so, could we harness this repair ability, and apply it to our bodies more widely?\" “If we could, you could likely lower the rate of cancer and other illnesses. We could potentially even slow ageing itself.” We sat down with Alex and asked him to show us his work – read the full interview 👉 https://lnkd.in/eDEyMKhF\n\nWhat do you know about Pembroke College, Cambridge? Step inside as we bring you 3 fascinating facts about Cambridge's third oldest College 👇 1️⃣ It was founded by Marie de St Pol, Countess of Pembroke, and granted its charter by Edward III on Christmas Eve in 1347. 2️⃣ Pembroke was the first College to have its own chapel, which is now the Old Library. The current Chapel was designed by Sir Christopher Wren – his first completed building. 3️⃣ While the foundation charter provided for a house of 30 scholars, today, Pembroke is home to around 440 undergraduate students, 280 postgraduate students and 85 Fellows. Have you studied at or visited Pembroke College before? 📷 Lloyd Mann #PembrokeCollege #CambridgeUniversity\n\nMeet Evangeline Rowe, who recently graduated with an MPhil in Polar Studies from Lucy Cavendish College 👏 What are Eva's next steps now she's graduated? 🪜 \"I have a position at a summer school this September and am looking forward to starting my new role as a Carbon Ratings Analyst at BeZero Carbon,\" Eva said.

Jessica studies medulloblastoma – a rare type of childhood brain cancer – at Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute and Emmanuel College, Cambridge. \"We want to understand why children get these brain tumours in the first place,\" says Jessica. \"They’re too young to have been exposed to the environmental factors that contribute to adult cancers. Is paediatric brain cancer all about tiny missteps in development? Could we reverse engineer this pathway and fix it?\" Read more about Jessica's inspiring journey into cancer research 👇 https://lnkd.in/dNSxsWzh #ChangingTheStoryOfCancer\n\nJust two slices of ham a day could be enough to raise your risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes by 15% over the next 10 years. By studying data from 2 million people, researchers at MRC Epidemiology Unit found that red and processed meat consumption was linked to a higher risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes."
