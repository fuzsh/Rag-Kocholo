        "text": "Parent-of-Origin Effects on Endosperm Size and siRNA Production in Reciprocal Triploids.\n\nIn A. thaliana, reciprocal interploidy crosses between diploid (2×) and tetraploid (4×) plants produce variable seed sizes in Col-0 or C24 ecotypes ( and Fig. S1A). These plants contain the expected ploidy number of chromosomes ( ). As reported previously (4), the paternal genome excess (2 × 4) results in larger seeds, whereas the maternal genome excess (4 × 2) leads to smaller seeds ( and Fig. S1 B and C). The response to paternal genome excess in 2 × 4 crosses was dependent on genotypes. Larger and normal seeds were produced in Ler and C24, whereas in Col the seeds were aborted during seed coat development because the expression of TTG2 and other genes was disrupted (18). However, during early seed development the response to altered parental genome dosage is consistent among all ecotypes tested. The endosperm size, reflected in the seed size (4), was noticeably different in the paternal- and maternal-excess seeds 5–6 d after pollination (DAP) in Col-0 ( ).\n\nWe manually dissected hundreds of seeds (containing endosperm and embryo) out of siliques at 6 DAP of reciprocal crosses (2 × 4 and 4 × 2) and their Col-0 parents, diploids (2 × 2) and tetraploids (4 × 4). At this stage, expression of p4-siRNA is most abundant in endosperm (14), and the seed size was obviously different between reciprocal crosses ( ). Eight small RNA libraries were made from these immature seeds and from rosette leaves in reciprocal crosses and their parents. A total of ∼80 million small RNA reads were generated by Illumina sequencing, and ∼64 million reads (∼80%) were mapped (Tables S1 and S2). To reduce ambiguity, only the reads that perfectly matched sequences of the annotated genome (TAIR9) were normalized to reads per 10 million for further analysis. In seeds, the most abundant small RNAs were 21- and 24-nt long, representing 20–29% and 37–53% of total small RNAs ( ). The proportions of 21-nt (18–23%) and 24-nt (46–50%) small RNAs were similar in endosperm of diploids (2 × 2) and tetraploids (4 × 4). However, the 24-nt siRNA population was ∼9% lower in 2 × 4 (37%) than in 4 × 2 (46%) seeds, but not in leaves (Fig. S1D). The 24-nt siRNA densities in a 10-kp sliding window were significantly lower in 2 × 4 than in 4 × 2 seeds (Wilcoxon paired ranks sum test, P = 0), whereas the 24-nt siRNA density difference between 2 × 4 and 4 × 2 crosses in leaves was insignificant (P = 0.2).\n\nPloidy-Dependent siRNAs Are Derived from Transposable Elements (TEs) and TE-Associated Genes (TAGs) in Endosperm.\n\nAverage distributions of small RNAs were 16.9% in TEs, 19.5% in genes, 49.1% in intergenic regions (IGRs), and 14.4% in microRNAs (miRNAs) and transacting siRNA (ta-siRNAs) ( ). The 24-nt siRNAs were enriched in TEs and intergenic regions, whereas 21-nt siRNAs were derived from miRNA and ta-siRNA loci. Consistent with the reduction of 24-nt siRNAs in 2 × 4 seeds, there was a lower proportion of small RNA reads in TEs (14%), genes (17%), and IGRs (45%) in 2 × 4 than in 4 × 2 seeds (19/21/54%).\n\nIn contrast, the fraction of miRNA and ta-siRNA reads was higher in 2 × 4 (24%) than in 4 × 2 seeds (7%). Among the up-regulated miRNAs and ta-siRNAs in 2 × 4 seeds, many were from a few loci with abundant reads in seed (Fig. S2 A–E and Dataset S1). Correspondingly we demonstrated that miR832 but not miR172 and miR396 accumulated to higher levels in 2 × 4 seeds than in the other samples ( ). However, there was no correlation between expression levels of miRNAs and ta-siRNAs and their targets in 2 × 4 and 4 × 2 seeds (Fig. S2 F–I). A role for these RNAs in seed development is not clear.\n\nInterestingly, certain siRNA loci were markedly over- or underrepresented in these samples. Among 3,901 annotated TE genes, 24-nt siRNA densities in a 100-bp sliding window were 42% lower in 2 × 4 than in 4 × 2 seeds ( and Fig. S1 E and F) (Wilcoxon paired ranks sum test, P = 0). The 24-nt siRNA densities were 20% lower in tetraploids than in diploids (P = 0), suggesting a dosage compensation mechanism for siRNA expression in seeds that are larger in tetraploids than in diploids. Among 418 TE families each generating 100 or more unique 24-nt siRNA reads, most siRNAs were expressed at significantly lower levels in 2 × 4 than in 4 × 2 seeds (P = 0, Wilcoxon paired rank sum test, Dataset S2). In contrast, 24-nt siRNA densities in leaves did not show a significant difference between 2 × 4 and 4 × 2 crosses ( ) (P = 0.7). The data suggest parent-of-origin effects of siRNAs on TE genes in developing seeds.\n\nCorresponding to siRNA accumulation in TE genes, there was also an effect of siRNAs on TAGs. We mapped genomic coordinates of 31,189 TEs and TE fragments onto transcribed regions and 2-kb regions upstream and downstream of 27,379 protein-coding genes (TAIR9). We found that 12,676 protein-coding genes (∼46%) contained at least one TE or TE fragment ( and Dataset S3). Among them, ∼19% contained TEs in the 5′ upstream (∼2 kb), ∼13% in the 3′ downstream (∼2 kb), ∼12% in both upstream and downstream, and ∼2% in the transcribed regions. Interestingly, siRNA densities in 5′ and 3′ regions of TAGs were significantly lower in 2 × 4 than in 4 × 2 seeds ( , P = 2.20E-16, Wilcoxon paired rank sum test), but not in leaves ( , P = 0.04).\n\nDoes the reduction of siRNAs in 2 × 4 relative to 4 × 2 seeds affect gene expression in endosperm? To address this question we first used published microarray data in reciprocal 2 × 4 and 4 × 2 or 2 × 6 and 6 × 2 crosses in young siliques (5), and we identified 9,742 TAGs and 13,029 non-TAGs on the array data. There were 151 TAGs that were differentially expressed between 4 × 2 and 2 × 4 siliques and, of those, 83% were more abundant in 2 × 4 than in 4 × 2 crosses. In contrast, of 90 non-TAGs, only 67% were more abundant in the 2 × 4 cross (χ2 = 19.13, P = 1.2 × 10−5) ( ). The same trend was observed in reciprocal tetraploids (2 × 6 and 6 × 2) between diploid and hexaploid lines (χ2 = 17.37, P = 3.1 × 10−5) ( ). These data indicated a tendency of increased expression of TAGs in siliques of paternal-excess crosses. These TAGs could be expressed in endosperm together with the maternally expressed p4-siRNAs (14), and their up-regulation in the paternal-excess crosses could be due to the reduced level of these siRNAs.\n\nIn our second approach to address the possibility that maternal p4-siRNAs are mediators of silencing in the endosperm, we exploited previous analysis that had identified endosperm-preferred early seed stage (EP-ESS, also known as (aka) endosperm transcription factor, ETF) genes and silique tissue-preferred early seed stage (OST-ESS, aka silique transcription factor, STF) genes (5, 19, 20). The ETF and STF genes included 779 and 448 genes, respectively. Of the ETF genes, 60 were up-regulated, and 2 were repressed in 2 × 4 seeds relative to 4 × 2 seeds (Fig. S3 A and B). In contrast, only 4 STF genes were up-regulated and 1 was repressed in 2 × 4 seeds. Similar results were obtained from interploidy crosses between 2 × 6 and 6 × 2. Overall, the differentially expressed genes in interploidy crosses were enriched in gene ontology groups of hydrolase, receptor binding, and transcription factor activities (Fig. S3C).\n\nThese data indicate that up-regulation of ETF genes is correlated positively with increased paternal genome dosage and negatively with increased maternal genome dosage (hypergeometric test, P = 0). Moreover, among 27 ETF genes that are validated as regulators of endosperm development (19), the majority were up-regulated in 2 × 4 seeds in two biological replicates ( and Dataset S4). No obvious trend was found among 25 STF genes ( ). Remarkably, 20 of 27 (∼74%) ETF genes are TAGs, and they generated siRNAs. In comparison, of all other genes, only ∼46% are TAGs that generate siRNA (P = 0.0001). Up-regulation of these ETF genes may play a role in overproliferation of endosperm in the paternal-excess triploids (4, 5).\n\nMaternal siRNAs Regulate AGAMOUS-LIKE (AGL) Gene Expression.\n\nThe ETFs include a large family of AGLs that are members of the plant type I MADS domain subfamily (6). Many AGLs are expressed in female gametophyte or developing seeds and play a role in reproductive development (7). Indeed, most AGLs were highly induced in seeds 3–8 d after pollination (Fig. S4).\n\nWe next tested whether p4-siRNAs are associated with expression of AGLs. Thirteen of 61 (∼21%) type I genes and 5 of 45 (∼11%) type II genes, respectively, contained 10 or more normalized p4-siRNA reads in upstream, transcribed, and downstream regions (Table S3). All type I genes that generated siRNAs belong to Mα, Mγ, and Mδ subgroups (Fig. S5) that are expressed predominately in developing endosperm. The Mβ-type genes are mostly expressed in female gametophyte (7), and none of them was found to be associated with p4-siRNAs. Type II genes such as AGL42 are expressed in vegetative tissues and during floral transition (21).\n\nInterestingly, the expression levels of all 13 siRNA-containing AGLs were higher in 2 × 4 than in 4 × 2 seeds ( and Fig. S6), as observed in siliques (5). The transcript levels of these AGLs were inversely correlated with siRNA levels that were lower in 2 × 4 than in 4 × 2 seeds (R2 = 0.67, P = 0.025) (Fig. S3D).\n\nWe also tested the expression of additional ETF genes including six known imprinted genes and four candidate imprinted genes (Dataset S4), many of which overlapped with TEs that generated 24-nt siRNAs in 5′ or 3′ regions. Some without obvious TEs generated 24-nt siRNAs from their 5′ upstream regions, suggesting presence of TE fragments or repeats that have not been annotated. The expression levels of these genes were higher in 2 × 4 than in 4 × 2 seeds but not obviously correlated with siRNA densities, with one exception. FWA is an imprinted gene in endosperm (22). The maternally expressed FWA was up-regulated in paternal-excess seeds (2 × 4) ( ), which correlated with lower siRNA densities in endosperm in 2 × 4 than in 4 × 2."
