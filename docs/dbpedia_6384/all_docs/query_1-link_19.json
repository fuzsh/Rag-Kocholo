        "text": "The History of the Copley Medal\n\nAt Copley Junior School we have four Houses. They are named Hawking (Red House), Hodgkin (Green House), Einstein (Blue House) and Darwin (Yellow House) after four famous scientists who have been awarded the Copley Medal. The history of the Copley Medal is fascinating and many eminent scientists have been awarded the Copley Medal. Our school is named after the family who established the Copley Medal and their family crest is the same crest that is on our school uniform today.\n\nThe Copley Medal is a scientific award given by the Royal Society, London, for \"outstanding achievements in research in any branch of science.” Given every year, the medal is the oldest Royal Society medal still awarded. It is the oldest surviving scientific award in the world, having first been given in 1731 to Stephen Grey, for “his new Electrical Experiments.”\n\nThe Copley family lived in Sprotbrough. Their crest can be seen in St Mary’s Church and is replicated on our school cardigans and jumpers.\n\nSprotbrough Hall (pictured below), a large home built for the Copley family, was built in 1670. The Copley family secured marriage with a FitzWilliam heiress and inherited the extensive holdings of the FitzWilliam lords of Sprotborough (older spelling).\n\nSir Godfrey Copley (pictured above) gave a donation of £100 for the most important scientific discovery or for the greatest contribution made by experiment and so the Copley medal was created.\n\nA second donation of £1666 13s. 4d. was made by Sir Joseph William Copley in 1881, and the interest from that amount is used to pay for the medal. The medal in its current format is made of silver gilt and is awarded with a £25 000 prize.\n\nThe Copley Medal has been awarded to many notable scientists, including 52 winners of the Nobel Prize. The award alternates between the physical and biological sciences (odd and even years respectively). In 2010, to mark the Society’s 350th anniversary, two Copley medals were awarded, one for each branch of science.\n\n2016 Copley Medal Winner - Dr Richard Henderson\n\nDr Richard Henderson FRS from the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge was awarded the Royal Society’s Copley Medal, the world’s oldest scientific prize in 2016. He was awarded the prize for his work on imaging techniques which have enabled scientists to understand the arrangements of atoms in important biomolecules.\n\nUnderstanding the structures of proteins and biomolecules is vital for understanding essential processes in the body and is a key part of modern drug design to make more effective pharmaceuticals which better interact with target proteins in the body.\n\nCommenting on his receipt of the Copley Medal, Dr Richard Henderson FRS, said:\n\n“It is a real thrill to be awarded the Royal Society’s Copley Medal for my work in this area. Particularly as it’s a prize that has been awarded to so many outstanding scientists since 1731. That’s amazing.”\n\n2019 Copley Medal Winner - Professor John Goodenough\n\nThe Copley Medal 2019 was awarded to Professor John Goodenough for his exceptional contributions to materials science, including his discoveries that led to the invention of the rechargeable lithium battery - used in devices like laptops and smartphones worldwide.\n\nVenki Ramakrishnan, President of the Royal Society, said, “Professor Goodenough has a rich legacy of contributions to materials science in both a fundamental capacity, with his defining work on the properties of magnetism, to a widely applicable one, with his ever-advancing work on batteries, including those powering the smartphone in your very pocket. The Royal Society is delighted to recognise his achievements with the Copley Medal, our most prestigious prize.”\n\n2017 Copley Medal Winner - Sir Andrew Wiles\n\nThe Copley Medal 2017 was awarded to Sir Andrew Wiles KBE FRS for his proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. The Royal Society describes this as one of the most important mathematical achievements of the 20th century. The Guinness Book of World Records described the Theorem as the world’s most difficult mathematical problem.\n\nIn 1637 Fermat had stated that there were no whole number solutions to the equation xn + yn = zn when n is greater than 2, unless xyz=0. Fermat went on to claim that he had found a proof for the theorem, but said that the margin of the text he was making notes on was not wide enough to contain it! Sir Andrew Wikes succeeded in solving this 300 year-old mystery. However, he had not only solved the long-standing puzzle of the Theorem, but in doing so had created entirely new directions in mathematics, which have proved invaluable to other scientists in the years since his discovery.\n\nCommenting on his success in being awarded the Copley Medal Sir Andrew Wikes said, “I feel extremely honoured to receive this prize which has been awarded to so many distinguished scientists and mathematicians.”\n\n2020 Copley Medal Winner - Sir Alan Fersht FMedSci FRS\n\nThe Royal Society awarded the Copley Medal 2020 to Alan Fersht FMedSci FRS, University of Cambridge:\n\n'He has developed and applied the methods of protein engineering to provide descriptions of protein folding pathways at atomic resolution, revolutionising our understanding of these processes.'\n\nCommenting on his award, Sir Alan writes, “Most of us who become scientists do so because science is one of the most rewarding and satisfying of careers and we actually get paid for doing what we enjoy and for our benefitting humankind. And most of us don’t do it to win awards. But recognition of one’s work, especially at home, is icing on the cake and makes us feel appreciated. Like many Copley medallists, I hail from a humble immigrant background and the first of my family to go to university. If people like me are seen to be honoured for science, then I hope it will encourage young people in similar situations to take up science.”\n\nOur use of cookies\n\nWe use necessary cookies to make our site work.
