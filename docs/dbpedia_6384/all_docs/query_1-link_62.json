        "text": "Paul Rose has been awarded one of the Society’s two Royal Medals. The Royal Medals are approved by Her Majesty the Queen, and are among the highest honours of their kind in the world. Previous recipients include Sir David Attenborough, Professor Diana Liverman and Lindsey Hilsum.\n\nPaul Rose receives the 2018 Founder’s Medal for scientific expeditions and enhancing public understanding. President of the Society Nicholas Crane said, “Paul Rose has been leading expeditions for over thirty years, collaborating with the world’s top field scientists to unlock the secrets of remote and challenging parts of the globe. He exemplifies the power of scientific expeditions to transform lives and is an inspiration.”\n\nEncouraged by his geography teacher for his enthusiasm for travel, Paul Rose said: “Receiving the Royal Medal feels fantastic as I always look at the names of past recipients when I enter the Society and I feel truly honoured to be in their company.”"
