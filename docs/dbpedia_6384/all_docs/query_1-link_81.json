        "text": "· Congratulations to Distinguished University Professor Michael E. Fisher! He has been awarded a 2005 Royal Medal from Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II by recommendation of the Royal Society, the United Kingdom's national academy of science. Professor Fisher, one of three scientists awarded the Royal Medal this year, is being recognized for his numerous contributions to statistical mechanics, specifically his work in wetting transitions, dislocation melting and criticality of ionic solutions. He will receive the medal at the Royal Society's Anniversary Day meeting at the end of November.\n\nFor more information about the Royal Medal, please click here.\n\n· Professor Nicholas Hadley has been re-appointed to the High Energy Program Advisory Committee of the Cornell Laboratory for High Energy Physics, which runs the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR) accelerator. The committee will advise the director of the laboratory about the status and future direction of the physics programs as well as recommending approval or rejection of specific experiments. This will be an important year for Dr. Hadley and his committee colleagues as they will be asked to make a recommendation on a proposed future runs of the accelerator and whether to continue with the charm quark physics program."
