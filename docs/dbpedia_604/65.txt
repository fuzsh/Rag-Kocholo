Introduction

The apodous sea cucumbers of the subfamily Leptosynaptinae Smirnov, 1989 (Apodida Brandt, 1835; Synaptidae Burmeister, 1837) are interstitial organisms that inhabit intertidal and shallow waters. They have a vermiform, translucent integument (Hendler et al. 1995; Woo et al. 2021). Heding (1928) placed the genus Epitomapta Heding, 1928 in the subfamily Synaptinae and included Epitomaptaroseola (Verrill, 1873) from Connecticut and Massachussets, USA, and E.tabogae Heding, 1928 from Taboga and Taboguilla, Panama. Heding based the new genus on the presence of notched rather than perforated radial pieces of the calcareous ring. Later, Solís-Marín et al. (2019) described a new species from the Tropical East Pacific in Mexico, E.simentalae Solís-Marín, Conejeros-Vargas, Caballero-Ochoa & Arriaga-Ochoa, 2019, based on having 12 tentacles, with each tentacle with two or three pairs of digits and 4–6 sensory cups, and a body lacking papillae or oval bumps. Epitomapta is, thus, currently represented by four nominal species, including the new one described here. Smirnov (1989) placed the genus in the subfamily Leptosynaptinae.

Discussion

Epitomaptaaumakua sp. nov. is very similar to its central Eastern Pacific congener E.simentalae but differing in the number of sensory cups per tentacle (4–6 in E.simentalae, 6–8 in E.aumakua sp. nov.). In addition to the geographical distribution, E.aumakua sp. nov. is smaller (<20 mm) than E.simentalae (<50 mm) (Solís-Marín et al. 2019). Epitomaptaaumakua sp. nov. clearly differs from E.tabogae and E.roseola in the number of sensory cups per tentacle (8–14 in E.tabogae, 2–5 in E.roseola), and in the number of pairs of digits present on the tentacles (5–6 in E.tabogae, 7 in E.roseola, and 2–3 in E.aumakua sp. nov.). Epitomaptatabogae was originally recorded from Taboga and Taboguilla, Panama, by Heding (1928) and is distributed throughout the Gulf of California (Solís-Marín et al. 2009), whereas E.aumakua sp. nov. currently is known only from Hawai`i. In its original description (Verrill 1873), E.roseola was recorded from Long Island Sound, Connecticut, and Vineyard Sound, Massachusetts; it was subsequently described from Bermuda (Heding 1928) and later recorded from Connecticut and Massachusetts to Florida (USA) (Hendler et al. 1995). Most recently, E.roseola has been reported from the South American coast (Brazil) (Miranda et al. 2015). It has never been reported from Hawai`i.

The anchors of the body wall in E.aumakua sp. nov. are similar in shape to those of E.roseola, but they differ in size, being approximately 160–170 μm long and 76–80 μm wide in E.aumakua sp. nov. (Fig. ) versus 120–150 μm long and 70–75 μm wide in E.roseola (Heding 1928). The anchors of the posterior region of the body wall in both these species are similar and can reach up to 150 μm long and 70 μm wide; anchors from the anterior end of the body wall in E.roseola measure almost 120 μm long and 70 μm wide (Heding 1928), while in E.aumakua sp. nov. they are 90–150 μm long and 70 μm wide. On the other hand, the anchors of the Pacific E.tabogae are 200 μm in length and 100 μm in width in the posterior region of the body, and 170 μm length and 100 μm width in the anterior region of the body (Heding 1928). Today E.tabogae and E.aumakua sp. nov. possess the largest known anchors of any species in this genus.

Epitomaptaaumakua sp. nov. is clearly distinguished from other species of the genus in having extremely large anchors, a character that has been used to differentiate species of the genus by various authors (see Heding 1928 and Hendler et al. 1995).
