Apodida can discard the posterior region of the body (Pearse, 1909; Domantay, 1931; Baugh, 1991), whereas autotomy in the Aspido-chirotida and Dendrochirotida takes the form of auto-evisceration, which is characterized by the extrusion of internal organs through a rupture in the body wall (Emson and Wilkie, 1980; Byrne, 1985, 1986; Dolmatov, 1996, 2009).

This is the first modern developmental study of the planktotrophic larva of the order Apodida (12).

Holothurian species may show different patterns of gonad development between individuals and locations, and the use of the same tubule for oocyte growth in more than one reproductive period is seen in species of the orders Dendrochirotida, Apodida, and Elasipoda.
