        "text": "Rynkatorpa felderi View in CoL new species\n\nFigures 1 View FIGURE 1 , 2 View FIGURE 2 A–G.\n\nDiagnosis: Tentacles with two pairs of terminal digits. Body wall ossicles anchors, anchor plates and accessory rods. Anchor stock unbranched. Perforations in anchor plates smooth, lacking denticulation. Accessory rods of uniform diameter, lacking central thickening.\n\nMaterial Examined: HOLOTYPE, National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, Catalogue No. 1080258, one specimen, northern Gulf of Mexico, off Louisiana, near hydrocarbon seep “Brine Pool”, 3 July 2003, R/V Pelican, 27º43.41’N, 91º16.76’W, 620 meters, 0.25 m ² box core, 1620 hrs., soft sulfurous mud with brownish surface showing a petroleum sheen, containing bacterially precipitated calcium carbonate nodules and evidence of thalassinidean shrimp burrows, pore water salinity 44 parts per thousand, collected by D. Felder and associates. PARATYPE, National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, Catalogue No. 1080259, 1 specimen, Northeast Gulf of Mexico, 29º13.4’N, 87º00’W, 12 July 1967, 752 meters, dredge, collected by W.E. Pequegnat. From Texas A&M collections, donated by M. Wicksten.\n\nDescription: Holotype ( Figure 1 View FIGURE 1 ) 80 mm in length, diameter approximately 7 mm, specimen mostly relaxed, tentacles extended ( Figure 1 View FIGURE 1 ), a contracted area about 14 mm long lying 18 mm posterior to oral field. Color in alcohol uniform light maroon to brown. Oral field with extended tentacles 5 mm in diameter. Tentacles 12, each approximately 2.60 mm long, terminating in two pairs of gently tapering, bluntly pointed, digits; each digit approximately 530 µm long. Specimen slightly sticky to touch, especially near posterior end, due to presence of numerous anchor ossicles.\n\nBody wall with numerous anchors and anchor plates, all of approximately the same size in anterior, posterior, and mid­body regions. Anchors ( Figure 2 View FIGURE 2 A) symmetrical, arms with 4–8 teeth; stock unbranched but finely toothed. Anchors in mid­body of average length 355 m (note: n=10; average sizes are calculated from necessarily small sample sizes of ossicles); posterior anchors of similar size, 356 m long. Anchor plates ( Figure 2 View FIGURE 2 C) approximately rectangular, with rudimentary bridge for support of anchor. Perforations few, of variable size, but near center of plate 2–4 perforations larger than others. Plates at mid­body of average length average 211 m, at posterior 229 m.\n\nCurved accessory rods ( Figure 2 View FIGURE 2 B), smooth, with enlarged, slightly branched ends, of average length 119 m, present in skin overlying radial longitudinal muscles, especially near mid­body and the posterior region. Radial longitudinal muscles contain no military granules. Tentacle digits contain curved rods ( Figure 2 View FIGURE 2 D) of greatly variable size (averaging 142 m in length) with enlarged ends. Tentacle stems with short, straight to curved rods ( Figure 2 View FIGURE 2 E) with more or less rounded ends, average length 55 m.\n\nParatype 62 mm in length, contracted, variegated light brown in alcohol. Anchors ( Figure 2 View FIGURE 2 G) and anchor plates ( Figure 2 View FIGURE 2 F) essentially similar to those of Holotype, except that they are larger (anchors 495 m long, plates 321 m long). Anchor plates apparently more fully developed, with more numerous perforations, but bridge remains rudimentary.\n\nDistribution: Northern and Northeastern Gulf of Mexico, 620–752 meters. Of the two records of this species, the Holotype is certainly from near a hydrocarbon seep, the Paratype from an area where seeps occur.\n\nEtymology: It is a pleasure to name this species for our friend and colleague Dr. Darryl Felder of the University of Louisiana, Lafayette, who has contributed so much to our knowledge of the marine fauna of the Gulf of Mexico."
