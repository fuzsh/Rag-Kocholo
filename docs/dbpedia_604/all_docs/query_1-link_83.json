I don't see anything like that in your pics\n\nYeah Medusa Worm is a term generally used to refer to specific kinds of Apodid (taxonomic order Apodida) sea cucumbers (though the term is also applied to Loimia medusa, a type of Spaghetti Worm, and is sometimes generalized to mean any kind of Spaghetti Worm - spaghetti worms are from the taxonomic family Terebellidae).\n\nOP, does your worm move around the tank, or does it live in a tube? It looks like it has some oral tentacles in a couple of those photos - can you get a clearer picture of them or could you describe them? (For example, are they thin, spaghetti like tentacles? Are they thick all the way from one end to the other? Are they thick at the base and tapered to be thin at the tip? Are they feathery/do the tentacles have \"branches\" coming off of them?) Would you describe your worm as transparent (totally see-through), translucent (kind of see-through), or opaque (not at all see-through)? If it lives in a tube, would you describe its tube as transparent, translucent, or opaque?\n\nEeyoreIsMySpiritAnimal\n\nJust another girl who likes fish\n\nView Badges\n\nJoined\n\nMay 14, 2019\n\nMessages\n\n13,934\n\nReaction score\n\n20,619\n\nLocation\n\nSpring, Texas\n\nhere's a much better picture.\n\nYeah... no, not really.\n\nSorry.\n\nRegardless, sea cukes are good to have.\n\nISpeakForTheSeas\n\n7500 Club Member\n\nView Badges\n\nJoined\n\nNov 22, 2021\n\nMessages\n\n7,765\n\nReaction score\n\n9,349\n\nLocation\n\nUnited States\n\nYeah, sea cucumbers (as long as your tank is cuke-safe and you're prepared for any potential toxin issues) are neutral/beneficial (sand-sifting cukes are good CUC, filter feeding cukes are neutral). Spaghetti worms sometimes look freaky, but they're neutral/beneficial too.\n\nFor info on sea cucumber toxins:\n\nWhat to do with Medusa worm?\n\nI found about 3-4 Medusa Worms in my tank, I have read that they can be beneficial to help the CUC. But also have heard if stressed they can kill all life in tank. Right now they are only about 1/2” long. My question is leave them or somehow try to remove them. more info 75 gallon DT 25 gallon...\n\nEeyoreIsMySpiritAnimal\n\nJust another girl who likes fish\n\nView Badges\n\nJoined\n\nMay 14, 2019\n\nMessages\n\n13,934\n\nReaction score\n\n20,619\n\nLocation\n\nSpring, Texas\n\nYeah, sea cucumbers (as long as your tank is cuke-safe and you're prepared for any potential toxin issues) are neutral/beneficial (sand-sifting cukes are good CUC, filter feeding cukes are neutral).

Hair worms (Cirratulidae) we're misidentified a number of years ago as spaghetti worms, and the name has stuck despite the fact that the worms that we see in our tanks are almost always hair worms...\n\nLast edited: Dec 3, 2022"
