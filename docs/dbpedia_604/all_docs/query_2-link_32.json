        "text": "Introduction\n\nSea cucumbers of the family Synaptidae (order Apodida), while resolved as a non-monophyletic group in recent molecular analyses (Miller et al. 2017), includes the genus Epitomapta, a shallow water transisthmian taxonomic group of burrowing apodous sea cucumbers. The genus was created by Heding (1928) to include the previously described Epitomaptaroseola (Verrill, 1873) and his new species E.tabogae Heding, 1928. Heding based the new genus on the presence of notched rather than perforated radial pieces of the calcareous ring.\n\nThe genus is represented by three nominal species, including the new one described here. In 1952 Cherbonnier described Epitomaptaknysnaensis from the South African coasts but in 1989 Thandar and Rowe transferred the species into the genus Leptosynapta on the basis of new collections from the type locality and on the rexamination of the type material.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nSpecimens were collected by SCUBA diving (4–10 m depth). They were relaxed in a solution of 4% magnesium chloride and seawater. Fixation was made using 70% ethanol. Ossicles were extracted from the body wall (anterior, medium and posterior region) and tentacles. The tissue was dissolved in fresh household bleach [5–6.5%] in centrifuge tubes. After centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 10 minutes, bleach was pipetted off and the ossicles were rinsed and centrifuged with distilled water that was pipetted off afterwards. The same process was done with 70, 80, and 95% ethanol. Absolute ethanol was added to the ossicles, and finally a small aliquot was taken and placed to dry on a cylindrical double-coated conductive carbon tape stub. Then it was sputter coated with gold 2.5 kV in the ionizer Polaron E3000 for 3 minutes and photographed using a Hitachi S-2460N scanning electron microscope (SEM). Ciliated funnels were detached from the internal body wall using tweezers and dehydrated by critical point drying and placed on a carbon tape stub. Specimens were deposited at the following scientific collections: Colección Nacional de Equinodermos “Dra. Ma. Elena Caso Munoz”, Instituto de Ciencias del Mar y Limnología, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Ciudad de México and Smithsonian Institution, Natural History Museum, Washington, D.C., United States.\n\nAbbreviations used in the text:\n\nICML-UNAM Colección Nacional de Equinodermos, Instituto de Ciencias del Mar y Limnología, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México;\n\nUSNM Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C., United States Natural History Museum.\n\nDiscussion\n\nEpitomaptasimentalae sp. n. is very similar to its Caribbean congener E.roseola, differing in the number of pairs of digits present on the tentacles (2–4 in E.roseola and 2–3 in E.simentalae sp. n.), and in the number of sensory cups per tentacle (2–5 in E.roseola and 4–6 in E.simentalae sp. n.). In addition to the geographical distribution, E.simentalae sp. n. is smaller (<50 mm) than E.roseola (30–120 mm) (Heding 1928, Miranda et al. 2015).\n\nEpitomaptasimentalae sp. n. clearly differs from E.tabogae and E.roseola in lacking papillae or oval bumps all over its body wall; the number of sensory cups per tentacle (8–14 in E.tabogae and 4–6 in E.simentalae sp. nov), and in the number of pairs of digits present on the tentacles (5–6 in E.tabogae and 2–3 in E.simentalae sp. n.). Epitomaptatabogae is distributed throughout the Gulf of California (Solís-Marín et al. 2009) whereas E.simentalae sp. n. is currently known only from the Central Eastern Pacific coast of Mexico. Epitomaptaroseola was previously described for the Caribbean (Bermuda) (Heding 1928), and later recorded in Connecticut, Massachusetts to Florida (USA) (Hendler et al. 1995) and recently reported for the South American coast (Brazil) (Miranda et al. 2015).\n\nThe anchors of the body wall in E.simentalae sp. n. are similar in shape to those of E.roseola, but differ in size, being approximately 90–150 μm length and 70–90 μm width in E.simentalae sp. n. (Fig. ); the anchors of the posterior region of the body wall in both species are similar and can reach up to 150 μm in length and 70 μm width; anchors from the anterior end of the body wall in E.roseola measure almost 120 μm in length and 70 μm in width (Heding 1928), while in E.simentalae sp. n. they measure from 90–150 μm length and 70 μm width. On the other hand, the anchors of the Pacific E.tabogae are 200 μm in length and 100 μm width in the posterior region of the body, and 170 μm length and 100 μm width in the anterior region of the body (Heding 1928); E.tabogae has the largest anchors in this genus (Heding 1928).\n\nIn Epitomaptasimentalae sp. n. the anchor plates are 100 μm in length and 90 μm in width.\n\nEpitomaptasimentalae sp. n. is clearly distinguished from other species of the genus in lacking papillae or oval bumps in the body wall, a character that had been used to differentiate species of the genus by various authors (see Heding 1928 and Hendler et al. 1995)."
