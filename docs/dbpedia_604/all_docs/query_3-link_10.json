Up to 8 cm long.\n\nBiology\n\nThis species has a break in its distribution from eastern Victoria to South Australia, a characteristic that has been observed in other marine invertebrate species and is thought to relate to Bass Strait being a land bridge with Tasmania in the past.\n\nHabitat\n\nIn sand and other sediment in seagrass beds, to depth of at least 2 m.\n\nSeagrass meadows\n\nSoft substrates\n\nDistribution guide\n\nSouth Australia and in Victoria at Corner Inlet and Nooramunga."
