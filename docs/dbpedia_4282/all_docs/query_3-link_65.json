        "text": "Morphology of the Leaf\n\nMorphology means external, well visible structural features whereas anatomy needs tools like a scalpel and/or microscope to study needs tools like a microscope and/or scalpel. Leaves are very important in plant morphology. The ability to describe the leaf is a must even for novices in botany.\n\nIn all, plants are fractal organisms, like Sierpinski triange (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{3}\\)). All fractals are self-similar (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{4}\\)), and plants are no exception. Self-similarity, or “Russian doll effect” means that almost every part of plant may be a part of the bigger complex, this bigger one—the part of even bigger system, and so on. This is what we see in leaves as levels of hierarchy. *Simple leavessimple leafleaf with one level of hierarchy have just one level of hierarchy whereas compound leaves have two or more levels of hierarchy. *Compound leavescompound leavesleaves with two or more level of hierarchy are sometimes mixed with branches but there are many other characteristics which allow to distinguish them (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\)).\n\nTo describe leaves, one should always note the level of hierarchy like “on the first level of hierarchy, the shape is ..., on the second level of hierarchy, the shape is ...” As it was mentioned above, leaf hierarchy is similar to Russian dolls: every smaller doll has a bigger doll (next hierarchy level) outside. For example, if the leaf is compound (consists of multiple leaflets), the overall shape of it could be, saying, round (circular) but the shape of individual leaflet of the very same leaf could be ovate (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{5}\\)). As a result, the description will say that on first level of hierarchy the leaf is ovate, and on the third level—circular.\n\nThere are three types of leaf characters: general, terminal, and repetitive. General characters are applicable only to the leaf as a whole are only applicable to the whole leaf. Terminal characters are applicable only to the leaf terminals (leaflets) are only applicable to the terminal leaflets. Terminals are the end parts of leaves, they do not split in smaller terminals; clover leaf, for example, has 3 terminals. Lastly, repetitive characters repeat on each level of leaf hierarchy. General and terminal characters do not depend on hierarchy. Repetitive characters are applicable to the leaf parts on each level of hierarchy may be different on each step of hierarchy.\n\nGeneral characters of leaf include stipules and other structures located near leaf base (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{6}\\)): sheath (typical for grasses and other liliids) and ocrea (typical for buckwheat family, Polygonaceae).\n\nRepetitive characters are the shape of the leaf (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{7}\\)), leaf dissection, and whether the blade is stalked (has petiole) or not.\n\nTerminal characters are applicable only to terminal leaflets of leaves. These characters (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{9}\\)) are the shape of the leaf blade base, the leaf tip, the type of margin, the surface, and the venation. The base of the leaf blade could be rounded, truncate (straight), cuneate, and cordate. The leaf apex could be rounded, mucronate, acute, obtuse, and acuminate. Leaf margin variants are entire (smooth) and toothed: dentate, serrate, double serrate and crenate.\n\nLeaf veins are vascular bundles coming to the leaf from stem. Frequently, there is a main vein and lateral veins (veins of second order). There are multiple classifications of leaf venation; and example is shown on the Figure \\(\\PageIndex{10}\\).\n\nNote that in dichotomous venation, each vein divides into two similar parts which is known as dichotomous branching. The example of dichotomous venation is the leaf of maidenhair tree, ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba). Another frequently segregated type of venation is parallellodromous, but in essence, this is acrodromous venation in linear leaves (for example, leaves of grasses) where most of veins are almost parallel.\n\nTo characterize the whole leaf, one might use the following plan:\n\n1. General characters (leaf as a whole):\n\n(a) stipules (present / absent, deciduous / not, how many, size, shape);\n\n(b) base (sheath / no sheath, ocrea / no ocrea)\n\n2. First level of hierarchy: repetitive characters:\n\n(a) symmetry (symmetrical / asymmetrical);\n\n(b)shape;\n\n(c) dissection;\n\n(d) petiole (presence and length)\n\n3. Second level of hierarchy\n\n4. Third level of hierarchy, and so on\n\n5. Terminal characters (leaflets):\n\n(a) base of leaf blade (rounded, truncate, cuneate, cordate);\n\n(b) apex (rounded, mucronate, acute, obtuse, acuminate);\n\n(c) margin (whole, dentate, serrate, double serrate, crenate );\n\n(d) surfaces (color, hairs etc.);\n\n(e) venation (apo-, hypho-, acro-, ptero-, actinodromous)\n\nHeterophyllyh refers to a plant having more than one kind of leaf. A plant can have both juvenile leaves and adult leaves, water leaves and air leaves, or sun leaves and shade leaves. A leaf mosaics refers to the distribution of leaves in a single plane perpendicular to light rays, this provides the least amount of shading for each leaf.\n\nLeaves have seasonal lives; they arise from the SAM through leaf primordia, and grow via marginal meristems. The old leaves separate from the plant with an abscission zone.\n\nThe famous poet and writer Johann Wolfgang Goethe is also considered a founder of plant morphology. He is invented an idea of a “primordial plant” which he called “Urpflanze” where all organs were modifications of several primordial ones. In accordance to Goethe’s ideas, plant morphology considers that many visible plant parts are just modifications of basic plant organs."
