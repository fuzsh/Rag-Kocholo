This plant reaches maturity in 2 to 3 years and produces thousands of seeds, which are viable for decades.\n\nInvasive Species: Acacia plants increase fire risk and change soil composition. These changes in soil last long after plants have been removed. The large amount of seeds and long seed viability mean that acacia plants can crowd out native vegetation after a fire.\n\nResources: Invasive Species Specialist Group\n\nhttp://www.iucngisd.org/gisd/speciesname/Acacia+longifolia\n\nWhere it grows: Alkali Heath grows along the California coast and is sometimes found in Nevada and Mexico.

The oil of this plant contains sulfur compounds that can irritate mucous membranes and the thyroid. Black mustard only reproduces through seeds, which can last decades when buried deep in soil.\n\nInvasive Species: Black Mustard forms dense growth that dries and becomes a fire hazard during the dry season. This plant outgrows natives and can be toxic to livestock.\n\nResources: CAL IPC, Weed Control in Areas in the Western United States\n\nhttps://wric.ucdavis.edu/information/natural%20areas/wr_B/Brassica_nigra.pdf\n\nWhere it grows: Black sage is the most common sage in California, and it grows well along the Southern California coast.\n\nHow to ID:.This semi-deciduous shrub can grow 1 - 2 m high and 3 m wide and has complex smooth leaves with a fuzzy underside. It can survive drought by curling its leaves in the dry season and grows in a variety of mineral soils. Black sage has a pleasant smell and white, pale blue or rose flowers that are an important food source for wildlife.\n\nWildlife Supported: Quail and Towhees eat the seeds of this plant, and hummingbirds, butterflies and bees rely on the flowers. This plant supports the Gray Hairstreak Butterfly, Alfalfa Looper Moth the Virginian Tiger Moth, and others.\n\nResources: Calscape.org\n\nhttps://calscape.org/Salvia-mellifera-(Black-Sage)\n\nWhere it grows: Also known as the Pacific Blackberry, this evergreen shrub or vine grows ijn moist soil from Canada to Baja California and from the coastline to the Rocky Mountains.\n\nHow to ID:.California Blackberry grows up to 2 m tall with thorny branches, white flowers and dark purple mature fruits. The compound berries are edible and seeds form within the different ‘cells’ of the fruit. Leaves grow in groups of three and have jagged edges. The name ursinus refers to bears’ affinity for this fruit.\n\nWildlife Supported: This plant supports small mammals, bears, birds, insects, and butterflies including the Blackberry Skeletonizer Moth.\n\nResources:\n\nCalscape.org\n\nhttps://calscape.org/Rubus-ursinus-(Pacific-Blackberry)\n\nOregon State University\n\nhttps://landscapeplants.oregonstate.edu/plants/rubus-ursinus\n\nWhere it grows: California Buckwheat grows in coastal dunes and chaparral habitats in the Southwestern U.S. and northwestern Mexico.\n\nHow to ID:.This shrub, also known as Leafy California Buckwheat, produces light green or gray, fuzzy leaves that are rolled along the edges. The clusters of flowers are white and turn rusty red when dry. These plants need sunlight and proper drainage, and they are a keystone species for scrublands.\n\nWildlife Supported: California Buckwheat supports birds, insects, bees, and butterflies such as the El Segundo Blue Butterfly, the Acmon Blue, and the Bramble Hairstreak.\n\nResources: Calscape.org\n\nhttps://calscape.org/Eriogonum-fasciculatum-(California-Buckwheat)\n\nWhere it grows: This plant is found in Southern California and Baja California coastal brush.\n\nHow to ID:.California Bush Sunflower grows up to 1.5 m tall, has rounded diamond shape leaves and bright yellow daisy-type flowers.
