        "text": "In the contemporary context, the relationship between the school institution and the mass media continues to be a challenge for the Social Sciences. In this sense, some researchers have approached its essence from various dimensions, among which its definition is signified. In the present work a new look at this particular is offered from the theoretical systematization, and the professional experience in the activity of the authors. It is emphasized that the considerations emanating from this article are not rigid, nor static, and depend to a great extent on the will of the professionals of the school and the media; as well as the concrete reality of each country, region or specific territory. No finished recipes are offered, only a vision of the potential of both institutions to face the education and training of children, adolescents and young people in times of pandemic.\n\nObjective – to study typological predisposition and psychomotor indices that condition directed formation of playing style in table tennis. Material: The subjects were 114 male tennis players: 5 masters of sports of international class, 39 masters of sports, 38 candidates for masters, 32 athletes of the first category. Results: Typological peculiarities were studied: strength of nervous system relative to excitation; mobility-inertness of excitation and inhibition, external and internal balance. The attacking style is associated with the following typological features: the nervous system of high and average strength (in the face of the common to all tennis players weakness of the nervous system) as a reflection of their reactivity and the predominance of excitation in the external balance. Tennis players of the defensive style are characterized by a high resistance to monotony, a greater expression of the nervous system weakness, and a predominance of inhibition according to internal balance. Players of the combined style are distinguished by a relatively higher (than in defenders) strength of the nervous system, balance of excitation and inhibition processes, greater mobility of excitation and inhibition processes. Tennis players of the attacking style are characterized by higher motion pace and autopace as compared to those of combined and especially defending style of playing. In defensive style players the time of simple and complex visual-motor response is significantly higher as compared to those who prefer the attacking style. In players of defensive and combined styles the deferred reactions tend to dominate during the response to moving object, whereas in attacking players – premature responses are observed. In order to adequately perceive the current situation and have more time to decide on the proper response action, they have to move further way from the tennis table than the attacking style players. Conclusions: Study was to examine typological predispositions and psychomotor indices that condition directed formation of playing style in table tennis, it is important direction of training.\n\nPower and dominance exist everywhere; its imposition over its recipient can happen both at the macro and micro levels. To become powerful and domineering are two salient factors that serve as emblems for the people in the realm of politics. Consequently, power relations are highly observable in this kind of discourse. Interestingly, one can explore how power and dominance exist between or among those people considered as “powerful.” Thus, using the Face Theory of Brown and Levinson (1978), this discourse analysis paper analyzed the power relations that transpired in a senate hearing and its relationship with the Face Threatening Acts used by the people involved in the discourse. The excerpt of the senate hearing dated October 03, 2017, between Asec. Mocha Uson (complainant) and GMA News online agency (defendant) about fake news served as the primary corpus for analysis. Results showed that the people involved in the discourse were all-powerful since they created tension when they projected their dominance with one another. The positive and negative faces of the participants were threatened and challenged by each member. The power-play became a “pass-the-ball” effect; moreover, no one holds the absolute power since it weakens once the face of the person became threatened. Hence, one can conclude that to disempower the empowered, a person must learn how to play and use Face Threatening Acts such as insulting/shaming, disagreeing, disapproving, provoking, commanding, demanding, and suggesting among others against the powerful. In this way, one may strike a social balance.\n\nA lattice model of the directed self-avoiding walk is used to estimate the possibility on the formation of an infinitely long linear semi-flexible copolymer chain. The copolymer chain is assumed to composed of four different types of the monomers. A method of the recursion relations is used to solve the proposed model analytically to show that the probability of the formation of a self-avoiding semi-flexible copolymer chain is independent of the stiffness of the chain. It is a distinct result from our earlier study on the formation of a Gaussian semi-flexible copolymer chain and the Gaussian chain is made up of these four monomers, [P. K. Mishra, J. of Adv. Appl. Sci. Res. 2(4) 1-8 (2020)]. We have also calculated the average number of different types of the bonding in the copolymer chain to show the distinctions in the behaviour of the self-avoiding copolymer chain from the Gaussian polymer chain.\n\nPrimary Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL) of the tongue is a very rare tumor most commonly affecting elderly patients causing upper airway obstruction and anticipated difficult intubations with space occupying lesions that prevent tongue displacement and hence, scarce space for laryngoscopy.\\nA 78-year-old man presented with progressive stridor and dyspnea. Oral examinations revealed tongue asymmetry and friable ulcerative lesions.\\nDuring induction of anesthesia in a scheduled partial glossectomy, difficult nasotracheal intubation was encountered despite using the Glidescope. Laryngeal landmarks could not be identified but successful nasotracheal intubation by hand-assisted and magill forceps manipulation of the endotracheal tube direction under video laryngoscopy. \\nFailed intubation should always be considered in the management of base of tongue tumors. Pre-operative assessment and planning to secure the airway in patients presenting with base of tongue tumors decreases morbidity and mortality, especially when an emergency plan is prepared.\\nNo single airway management technique can be used for every patient. Further research is required for guiding the choice of airway management in such patients.\n\nIntroduction: It is common to use in a surgical setting a nasogastric (NG) tube to empty the stomach, monitor the occurrence of bowel occlusion and detect the presence of a gastric leak after major abdominal surgery through the injection of methylene blue. \\nCase Presentation: A 68-year-old male patient presented to the operating room for scheduled laparoscopic cholecystectomy. After tracheal intubation and commencement of surgery, an 18 Fr. NG tube was inserted blindly through the nostril with no means of assessing its position to assess the integrity of the stomach. A solution of methylene blue was prepared and 240ml were injected in the NG tube. Upon applying negative pressure suction on the NG, a noticeable change in airway pressure was noted and investigation using fiber optic vision revealed the presence of bluish liquid in the bronchi. The NG tube was then re-inserted, the surgeon made the final confirmation of its proper placement within the stomach and the surgery continued uneventfully. Postoperative chest x-ray was suggestive of chemical pneumonitis and emphysema. Patient was first admitted to the intensive care unit for close monitoring, to be then transferred to the ward and later discharged on post-operative day three. \\nConclusion: With little information concerning such accidents, further studies concerning the effect of MB on the lungs are highly needed. We report this case due to its rare incidence, favorable outcome and potential in illustrating the importance of proper verification of NG tube placement."
