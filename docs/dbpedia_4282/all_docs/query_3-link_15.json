        "text": "Halophytes represent an ancient and remarkable ecological group of annual or perennial plants with very complex features, whose definition and classification are still not univocal and often controversial. The species belonging to this group are very different from an ecological, morpho–physiological, and taxonomic point of view. Therefore, their definition can be subjective and vary a lot in the literature according to the different interpretations. However, following the most popular definition used in the literature, halophytes can be identified as plants that grow naturally, and complete their life cycle in environments that contain a higher salt content than most plant species can tolerate."
