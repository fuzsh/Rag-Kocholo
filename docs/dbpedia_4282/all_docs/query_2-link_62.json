        "text": "MARSH PLANTS\n\nwith contributions by Sheri Lubin and Brent Mishler\n\nPlants along the salt marshes of San Francisco Bay differ from the fresh water plants in nearby uplands. The presence of salts in the water and soil is a challenge to plants. Each plant has to adapt their physiology to rid these salts from their metabolism. Plants who can successfully live in these areas are called halophytes. Plants in these areas usually have reduced leaves to prevent evaporation on the surface so they donâ€™t lose valuable water without salts. Thickened, fleshy leaves also help reduce evaporation. root systems are small with the ability to reverse the salt concentration back to the root.\n\nPlants in the San Francisco Estuary system also have to adapt to extreme tidal influences. Twice in a day the water flushes through the area. This leaves banks along the slough exposed between low and high tide with little vegetation. The type of vegetation found in tidal marshes depends on both tide elevation and salinity. The vegetation communities are commonly grouped into three zonations; low, middle and high marsh."
