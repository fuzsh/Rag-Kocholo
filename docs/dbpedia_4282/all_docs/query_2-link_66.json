        "text": "The quintessential Caribbean Beach looks very different today compared to 30 years ago. Coconut palm lined sleepy beaches used to grace all the brochures. However, the non-native coconut palm is only part of the story. There are many ‘wild’ beaches without a coconut in sight. Caribbean Seashore plants in SXM are an important defense against erosion. Which have you spotted?\n\nManicured beaches may look nice on the outside, but constantly raking small amounts of seaweed and large amounts of human trash comes at a cost. More and more beaches go from concrete (or lawn) to sand, to water. We are loosing our seashore plants, and with them, we are loosing our sand, shade, and natural habitats!\n\nWhich plants have you seen? Which are your favorites? Can you identify the dangerous Manchineel?"
