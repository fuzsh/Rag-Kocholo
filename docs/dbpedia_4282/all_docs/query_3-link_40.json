        "text": "Some Halophytic Plants: Takhini Salt Flats, Yukon, Canada\n\nIn this note, I provide an overview of some salt-loving and salt-tolerant plants that grow on the Takhini Salt Flats, Yukon, Canada. The plants I focus on are called halophytic plants. They not only tolerate, but they thrive on saline, alkaline substrates.\n\nThis written note is a companion to two YouTube videos that describe:\n\na) some geological factors that led to the creation of the Takhini Salt Flats and associated alkaline lakes; and\n\nb) a speculation about the presence of a spectacular magenta-coloured purple sulphur bacteria that grows in one of the salt lakes on the Takhini Salt Flat.\n\nThe Takhini Salt Flats are located west north-west of Whitehorse, Yukon, in the Ibex Valley (Photo 1).\n\nAt the end of the note, in the epilogue, I speculate about the fate of the Takhini Salt Flats in the face of a changing climate.\n\nHalophyte plants\n\nAs a basis to understand the unusual salt-loving and salt-tolerant plants on the Takhini Salt Flats, let’s review what botanists call a halophyte plant. Botanists classify salt-loving and salt-tolerant plants as halophytes or halophytic plants. Halophytes are:\n\nsalt resistant or salt-tolerant plants that naturally survive thrive and complete their life cycles in soils or waters that contain high concentrations of salt;\n\nare able to survive in saline conditions by taking advantage of less saline moisture within the soil profile and by adapting to seasonal variability in salinity by altering germination, growth and reproduction cycles;\n\ncharacterized by genetic, biochemical, and other mechanisms that enable them to survive in salt-rich environments, but those mechanisms are beyond my knowledge and are too complex to discuss in this note;\n\nare considered to be an obligate species, that are restricted to, and dependent upon, saline habitats in order to reproduce; and\n\nare found in high salinity wetlands along ocean coasts, in dry to semi-dry inland areas, and in high salinity salt flats associated with inland lakes where evaporation exceeds lake recharge.\n\nHalophyte plants are not common. Only about 2% of the world’s flora are halophyte plants.\n\nSpecial Climate of Ibex Valley:\n\nThe Takhini Salt flats do not occur along an ocean coastal region; rather, the Takhini Salt Flats lie within the inland Ibex Valley, Yukon. So, what is so unusual about the Ibex Valley that led to the development of the salt flats and alkaline lakes? Simply, the summer is warm and evaporation of shallow thermokarst lakes causes the precipitation of the salt.\n\nThermokarst lakes (Photo 3) formed in the Ibex Valley at the end of the last ice age. Those thermokarst lakes are the foundation of the Takhini Salt Flats. Salts that occur on the Takhini Salt Flats originally were dissolved by water from local geological materials like rocks and sediments. The sediments were deposited on the bottom of proglacial Lake Champagne, which formed towards the end of the last ice age. The dissolved salts entered surface water and groundwater, filled the shallow thermokarst lakes, and/or percolated down to aquifers. Because the climate of the Ibex Valley results in warm summer, with limited precipitation, the lake water and soil moisture evaporate quickly, leaving the dissolved salt behind. This climate and resulting evaporation lead to the development of saline soils, salt lakes, and brackish groundwater.\n\nSimple Habitat Classification:\n\nThe halophytic plants I recognized and photographed on the Takhini Salt Flats are summarized in the context of a very simple habitat classification (Photo 7 - the image is located at the end of the document because of the odd image size). The simple habitat classification considers the physical characteristics of the substrate in which the plants grow as well as key plants that grow in that physical setting. The habitat and plant community zonation I suggest is based on subjective observation, proximity to standing water, apparent type and dryness of the substrate, and distribution of a very few plant species, all of which are qualitative measures. My simple habitat classification consists of:\n\nlake;\n\nlake edge;\n\nsalt flat; and\n\nmeadow grassland.\n\nLike many classifications, the habitat zones are not separated by hard walls. Rather, the habitat zones are gradational into each other, as is the distribution of supported plant communities.\n\nI have no doubt that that a botanical expert would see more refined habitat and plant community distribution patterns. For example, a preliminary analysis of plant communities on Yukon salt flats was carried out in 2005 by Pippa Seccombe-Hett and Jennifer Line (unpublished report made available to me by Bruce Bennett, Coordinator, Yukon Conservation Data Centre at Environment Yukon). Although preliminary, their observations are very useful, influenced my simpler habitat classification, and helped guide what I looked for in the field and in my photos.\n\nI have no doubt that that a botanical expert would see more refined distribution of habitats based on substrate and plant community distribution patterns, but my simple habitat classification is a place to start to look for a relationship between plant distribution and geological substrate.\n\nIncomplete List Of Takhini Salt Flat Flora:\n\nI have Included an incomplete list of plant species that I photographed on the Takhini Salt Flats (Photo 7, located at end of this note). More comprehensive lists are available from Bruce Bennett, Coordinator, Yukon Conservation Data Centre at Environment Yukon.\n\nI am not a trained botanist and I have not provided description of plant features or key identification criteria because there are many credible and reliable online resources that achieve that goal. My plant species identifications are based on corrections or confirmations provided by experts on iNaturalist, where I have posted all my observations.\n\nZone 1: Lake\n\nThis habitat is self explanatory. It consists of standing water in a shallow thermokarst lake (Photo 3 and 6). The light colour of the lake bottom suggests that sodium sulphate salts accumulate on the lake bottom during the summer, when lake evaporation takes place. I did not spend a lot of time looking at this habitat, but it does support an unusual aquatic species.\n\nExample halophytic plants in zone 1 - lake:\n\n1) Spiral ditchgrass (Ruppia cirrhosa) (Photo 8), is also known informally as Spiral Tasselweed, western ditchgrass and widgeongrass. It is a native, circumpolar, perennial aquatic plant that is considered to be a halophyte.\n\nHabitat: Its global habitat includes shallow, saline, alkaline ponds and lakes, marshes, ponds, and sloughs.\n\nConservation status: In Yukon, it is Critically Imperiled (S1).\n\nDistribution: In Canada, it is known from western and central areas. On the Takhini salt flats, I came across this plant only once, where it was washed up on the shore of an alkaline lake (Photo 8).\n\nHabitat: includes moist to wet saline lakes and meadows and saturated, often calcareous wetlands in prairies, parklands, boreal, and montane zones. Its preferred sites include areas where the water table is stable, associated streams have a fairly constant water flow with little or no spring flooding, and soils remain moist to saturated, but not flooded, throughout the growing season. It also prefers fine-textured alkaline soils, which is typical of the ancient lake sediments of the Ibex Valley.\n\nConservation status: In Yukon, this species is ranked as vulnerable (S3).\n\nDistribution: On the Takhini salt flats, I saw this species growing on moist meadow grassland habitat.\n\nEpilogue: Threat Of Climate Change\n\nIn this note, I presented a synthesis of observations describing some of the plant diversity on the Takhini Salt Flats, Yukon, Canada. I reiterate, my list of plant species (Photo 7) is incomplete and my habitat classification is simplistic. If interested in the plant species observed on the Takhini Salt Flats, you should contact Bruce Bennett, Coordinator, Yukon Conservation Data Centre at Environment Yukon) for a current and comprehensive plant species list.\n\nBut, there is a specter in the air. Climate is an important factor influencing plant diversity and distributions. Within a climatic area, substrate geology is also an extremely important factor that influences plant diversity. As a geologist, I am fascinated by those plant-substrate relationships.\n\nThe story at the Takhini Salt Flats is fascinating. The Takhini Salt Flats is one excellent example where geological processes and climate strongly influence plant species diversity. Geological processes during, and at the end of, the last ice age created a large pro-glacial lake in the Ibex Valley called Lake Champagne. Sediments that accumulated on the bottom of pro-glacial Lake Champagne and melting soil permafrost conspired together to create thermokarst lakes. Groundwater and surface water, which dissolved salt constituents from the local rocks and sediments, filled the shallow thermokarst lakes. The local climate, consisting of warm dry summers, ensured that lake recharge rate lagged behind the lake evaporation rate. Each year, the high evaporation rate increases the lake salinity, which causes precipitation of sodium sulphate salts, and created and sustains the alkaline lakes and salt flats. That is a wonderful illustration how climate and geological processes create an environment that supports many rare and vulnerable plants on the Takhini Salt Flats. In my opinion, the Takhini Salt Flats is very special area and should be elevated to a protected status, given the number of “at-risk” plant species it supports.\n\nBUT, the Takhini Salt Flats faces a very serious existential risk - that of climate change. If climate change increases precipitation in the region or cooling of the summer season, the delicate balance between lake water evaporation and lake water recharge rate from local precipitation may also change. That may discourage precipitation of the salts if lake water evaporation rate does NOT exceed lake water recharge rate. Under those conditions, sodium sulphate salts will NOT precipitate and existing salts may dissolve away. That would arrest the creation of the salt flats and destroy the unique environment needed to support the rare halophytic plant species that are specially adapted to live on the saline substrate. Climate change is a potential existential threat to the Takhini Salt Flats.\n\nNote of Thanks\n\nIn 2019, during my second visit to the Takhini Salt Flats, I was joined by Yukon resident Jozien Keijzer. Her knowledge of the area and the flora and our discussions before, during and after, gave me a much deeper understanding of the flora-geology-climate-substrate relationships represented on the Takhini Salt Flats.\n\nBruce Bennett, Coordinator, Yukon Conservation Data Centre at Environment Yukon, has also been generous with his knowledge about the Takhini Salt Flats and the local flora. His corrections and confirmations of my identifications posted on iNaturalist have been invaluable. Bruce also linked me with other experts whose guidance was extremely helpful.\n\nJeff Bond, Manager Surficial Geology, Yukon Geological Survey, was extremely helpful by pointing me to references that set a geological context for the Ibex Valley - a framework for the Takhini Salt Flats.\n\nI extend my thanks and appreciation to Jozien, Bruce and Jeff, although the errors of my simplistic approach remain mine.\n\nApril 16/22; rev April 19/22"
