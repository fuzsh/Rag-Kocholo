        "text": "The effects of irniine, a pyrrolidine alkaloid extracted from the tubers of Arisarum vulgare, on rat hepatocyte primary cultures and rat liver epithelial cell line (RLEC) were studied. Cytotoxicity was first evaluated by LDH release, MTT and NR tests and MDA production, while cellular alterations were visualized by electron microscopy and DNA gel-electrophoresis. In hepatocyte and RLEC cultures, a major toxicity appeared at 40 microM of irniine and was demonstrated by an increase in LDH release and decreases in MTT reduction and NR uptake while concentrations lower than 40 microM did not induce significant changes in these parameters. However, we observed an increase in MDA production at 30 microM. Important alterations of the nuclei and mitochondria were also visualized by electron microscopy in cells treated with 50 microM. Using DNA gel-electrophoresis, we demonstrated that irniine at 40 and 50 microM induced DNA damage. All together these results demonstrate that: (1) Irniine induces a significant hepatotoxicity. (2) Irniine toxicity is not mediated by a metabolic derivative since RLEC, which do not contain a monooxygenase system, were also affected by this compound. (3) Irniine induces a significant DNA damage and oxidative stress which leads to cell death by necrosis and/or by apoptosis. Moreover, our data suggest that the alkaloid irniine contained in A. vulgare may be involved in the toxic symptoms observed after medicinal use or consumption of the plant tubers as food both by humans and animals.\n\nPyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) are a class of toxic compounds which are found in plants. Poisoning caused by these toxins is associated with acute and chronic liver damage. Tussilago farfara (coltsfoot), Petasites hybridus (common butterbur), Senecio vernalis (eastern groundsel) and Symphytum officinale (comfrey) are traditional phytotherapic species, which beside the therapeutic bioactive compounds contain PAs. The aim of the paper was to assess the safety of some dry extracts obtained from these species. For the determination of acute toxicity, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Guideline No. 423 was used. For the determination of repeated dose oral toxicity, Senecionis vernalis herba and Symphyti radix extracts (250 mg÷kg) were administrated, by gavage, for 28 days, and their effects on animal weight, liver and biliary functions, hepatic tissue and oxidative stress were investigated. After the acute toxicity testing, the dry extracts were placed in the GH...\n\nPyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) are found in various plant genera worldwide. Poisoning by PA-containing plants is usually accidental, by the ingestion of grain inadvertently contaminated with seeds of pyrrolizidine-containing weeds, or the consumption of herbal or bush tea, or when taken as herbal infusions for medicinal purposes. In this paper the toxicity of PA-containing plants, with emphasis on Senecio spp. is reviewed. Although the toxicity of Senecio has been documented in numerous case reports, the mechanism of toxicity is not fully known. Elucidating the factors involved in herbal remedies-induced toxicity has medical significance. Currently, there is no antidote for natural-substances that induce liver damage. It is important to understand the need for monitoring the use of herbal medicine in order to optimize herbal/traditional medicine use and maximize the clinical and economical benefits. It is also necessary to enhance communication between scientists and physicians of all disciplines involved in complementary alternative medicine and clinical toxicology.\n\nIntroduction: A huge number of plants have remedial and therapeutic prospects throughout the world and are used in the treatment of diverse diseases. Heliotropium is a large genus of family Boraginaceae which widely distributed in tropical and temperate regions of hemispheres. The purpose of this review is to recapitulate the phytochemistry and pharmacological activities of the Heliotropium species to unveil future research prospects. Methods: Published data in this review were all gathered from the online bibliographical databases: PubMed, Elsevier, Scopus, Google Scholar and Web of Science. Results: The plants of the Heliotropium genus in the history of traditional drugs provide remedies for gout, inflammation , skin disorders, menstrual dysfunction, rheumatism, and noxious bites. The active biochemical constituents extracted from the Heliotropium species comprise pyrrolizidine alkaloids, flavonoids, and terpenoids. Significant biological activities viz. antimicrobial, antiviral, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, cytotoxicity, phytotox-icity, and wound healing were revealed by an enormous number of extracts and biochemically active constituents of various species of the Heliotropium genus. Conclusion: Phytomedicines are now an important and beneficial zone of the recommended treatment and have high potentials in many countries. Although this clear evidence that plants of the Heliotropium genus have several medicinal importance in the treatment of diverse diseases. The medicinal use of these plants as phyto-pharmaceuticals would depend on the production of the required systematic procedures necessary to standardize the various bioactive secondary metabolites in such herbal formulations. Therefore, we conclude that in the coming period, plants of the Heliotropium genus would become an acceptable source of indigenous medicines."
