        "text": "This month, we’re back to my regularly scheduled programming: whining about not getting promised rain when most everyone else in our part of southeastern PA did—particularly disappointing in light of the scorching week ahead. There are also current animal issues, including rabbit(s), chipmunk(s), and these little goobers, whose parents built several nests in various spots before deciding to raise their youngins in my patch of ‘Hayefield Gold’ Miami mist (Phacelia purshii).\n\nIt was a lovely place to grow up, but their presence meant that I missed harvesting most of those seeds this year, because I didn’t want to disturb them. Oh well. I do enjoy having the Carolina wrens around in the garden, so having two more in the world is a good thing.\n\nOne other surprising good thing this year is a nearly complete lack of aphids. I’m used to other insects having their boom and bust years, but wow, I don’t recall ever having almost no aphids at all—even the orange ones on the milkweeds (Asclepias) or the red ones on the oxeyes (Heliopsis). I did notice these gold ones on the Mohr’s rosinweed (Silphium mohrii) a couple weeks ago; then I realized that they were not normal aphids, but aphid mummies, parasitized by tiny wasps. Very cool! I guess the aphid parasitoids are having a very good year, and that is worth celebrating.\n\nNow, about the garden…well, as usual, this is not a peak time of beauty here on the whole. My priorities this time of year are to have all seedlings in the ground by the end of May, then the garden set to rights and everything cleaned up by the first day of summer. This year, the dreaded “dephloxing” was on my to-do list, which is my term for doing a more-thorough-than-usual pass through all of the beds and borders inside the fence.\n\nWhen I was a new gardener and visiting as many gardens as I could, I noticed that in the older ones—those that had been around for decades and cared for by just one person—a few perennials tended to proliferate: particularly garden phlox (Phlox paniculata) and orange coneflowers (Rudbeckia). As my own plantings matured, I noticed the same phenomenon happening here, and I understood: It’s so easy to let these two seed around and fill space, because they provide plenty of flowers and don’t ask for anything in return. Eventually, though, they must be seen to, unless one is prepared to cede the garden entirely to them, and that means a thorough edit to balance them with the other perennials. I could call it “derudbeckiaing,” I guess, but “dephloxing” is ever so much easier to say.\n\nSo, in addition to doing any needed cutting-back of the woody plants, and weeding, and restoring the edges, I’ve spent many hours plucking out individual stems of phlox, coneflowers, Joe-Pye weeds, ironweeds, burnet, bee balm, and perennial sunflowers to create more-defined clumps of each, and to thin those clumps to just the strongest stems. This all creates a whole lot of mess, and the immediate results look rather tragic compared to the previous lushness. But, considering that lush in June means jungle by September, I know that investing the extra time and effort every few years will pay off with the garden looking fantastic by late summer. Until then, though, let’s stick with closeups of the gems that are looking lovely right now. I’ll start with the natives again, since several of you have let me know that you find that helpful. Just keep in mind that I’m using a very broad definition of native: If a species calls any part of the U.S. home, it counts here.\n\nThis adorable calico monkey flower (Diplacus pictus), for instance, hails from the West Coast, but it grows well here too as a spring annual.\n\nAnnual salt heliotrope (Heliotropium curassavicum) isn’t fragrant, unfortunately, but its form is eye-catching, and its flowers are a magnet for many tiny insects.\n\nRock harlequin (Capnoides [formerly Corydalis] sempervirens) appears delicate, but if it finds a spot it likes, it can really fill out and create a good show. It can flower the same year the seed germinates, but the best-looking plants are those that sprout later in the growing season and overwinter.\n\nYou seldom see large-flowered collomia (Collomia grandiflora) in gardens, which is unfortunate since it is so pretty this time of year. It requires advance planning, though: you can’t just sow it in spring and expect results, though some seed sources claim that works. In my experience, it needs to be sown in late summer to early fall: a time most gardeners aren’t thinking about next year’s annuals. Once you get it to flower, it will self-sow for future years and you don’t have to think about it again, other than making sure you don’t pull out the seedlings, which appear in late fall to early spring.\n\nMy “annual meadow” is making me very happy this year. It looks big here, but it’s only about 10 feet in diameter. This is where I get mulch and topsoil deliveries in fall; by spring, I have it all moved elsewhere and am left with a prominent bare spot close to the driveway. In past years, I let crabgrass take over for the summer, but well, when you have a patch of bare soil and a lot of seeds to play with, it seems worthwhile to scatter a bunch and see what happens. The California poppies (Eschscholzia californica) were very happy to cooperate! The haze of blue below them is divaricate phacelia (Phacelia divaricata), another California native annual. Below is a closer look at it.\n\nThe mid-spring to early-summer season is peak time for other phacelias, too.\n\nA few years ago, I bought seed sold as Phacelia tanacetifolia ‘Best Find’ and ended up with this one. It turned out to be Phacelia congesta, a Texas native. Apparently, one of its common names is “caterpillars,” which is remarkably unhelpful. Another is “spider flower,” which is much more often used for cleome. So, I’m going with yet another option, “blue curls,” as it is more descriptive and distinctive (though not to be confused with forked bluecurls [Trichostema dichotomum], another native annual).\n\nWe’re back to California-in-Pennsylvania with this ‘Penny Black’ baby blue eyes (Nemophila menziesii). Last month, I showed the earlier-blooming volunteers; this month, the seedlings I started indoors in early spring are peaking.\n\nYet another gem of a cool-season annual from California: Farnsworth’s jewel flower (Streptanthus farnsworthianus). The white flowers are pretty, but its those purple bracts that really steal the show.\n\nAnd one more western beauty: globe gilia (Gilia capitata), with fluffy blue bobbles atop 3- to 4-foot-tall stems. The insects go crazy over this one!\n\nClasping Venus’s looking-glass (Triodanis perfoliata) is a big name for this little flower found throughout much of North America.\n\nAnother native cutie with even smaller flowers: blue toadflax (Nuttallanthus canadensis). It’s showy in a group, though.\n\nI grew widow’s cross (Sedum pulchellum) for the first time last year and liked it, so I collected the seeds—or so I thought. When I went to clean them, there was almost nothing in the bag: I must have gathered the seedheads too late. I will try to do better this year. Native to parts of the central and southern U.S., it grows as a winter annual, best sown in late summer to fall, so it can germinate in fall to early spring.\n\nLast year, I grew wild four-o’clock (Mirabilis nyctaginea), and it was interesting as an annual, even though the flowers didn’t have any petals, just pinkish green bracts. The species is native to much of the United States, and reportedly hardy up to Zone 3. It did turn out to be perennial here in Zone 6/7, and the first flush of flowers this year had the pink petals.\n\nTalk about a vertical accent! Candle anemone (Anemone cylindrica), also known as thimbleweed, grew bolt upright to top out at 4 feet this year. The habit was the same whether it was growing by itself of coming up through lower companions.\n\nI adore downy wood mint (Blephilia ciliata). Put a couple of googly eyes on these guys as they’re coming into bloom and they could pass for Muppets, I swear. The plants are super-tough, too. This clump has been growing in a metal kettle in my nursery area for at least 3 years now.\n\nThe various species and natural hybrids of our native leather flowers (Clematis) are looking great right now. This one is Addison’s clematis (C. addisonii). I have a couple that have to fight it out with taller plants in a border, and those are lucky to produce one or two,1- to 2-foot-long stems and a few scrawny blooms each year. About 5 years, I moved this one to a prime spot and it responded happily, getting taller and more free-flowering each year. It’s not really a climber, so I have to give it some support to encourage it to be upright, the better to show off its blue-and-white bells.\n\nAnother uncommon perennial that’s been worth a wait: Trelease’s larkspur (Delphinium treleasei). It’s native to a rather limited area of Arkansas and Missouri but doing fine here in PA. I sowed the seeds five years ago, I think, and it’s finally flowering for the first time.\n\nFormerly considered an endangered species, smooth purple coneflower (Echinacea laevigata) is now “just” considered threatened, which is better but still not comfortably secure, survival-wise. From an anonymous seed gift several years ago, I now have several stock beds of this beauty for seed production. My deep gratitude to the person who shared this species with me, if you’re still reading here.\n\nThere’s a good bit of interesting variation in the plants, which I’m trying to preserve, so I grow them all together (but separated from other Echinacea species). The plants with the super-dark stems tend to have the most intensely pink flowers.\n\nA few of the plants have very pale pink to basically white blooms. Their foliage and stems are a particularly bright green in spring.\n\nMay was the peak bloom time for Bowman’s root (Gillenia trifoliata); June is the season for American ipecac (Gillenia stipulata). Both of them are terrific, both in bloom and in fall color, and they don’t ask for anything in return.\n\nFlowering for the first time here this year: glade mallow (Napaea dioica). Yay! I have seen the flowers described as “insignificant”—mostly, people rave about the foliage on this perennial—but I think they are pretty. As you may guess from the botanical name, the species is dioecious, meaning that some plants are males and some are females. So far, it looks like two of these three-year-old seedlings are males and four are females, and that means that seeds should be in the future for this patch!\n\nAh, dear Carolina lupine (Thermopsis villosa), you are so splendid in bloom in the borders. I’m thrilled that you are starting to feel at home in the lower meadow too, and ecstatic that the deer completely ignore you (they have so far, anyway).\n\nAnother happy sight this year: meadow garlic (Allium canadense). Maybe 6 years ago, I collected a couple handfuls of the small bulbils from a neighboring field and tossed them in my lower meadow. I kind of forgot about them after that, until this year, when I found them in flower in that spot. It may have been that they bloomed before this and the deer got them. My alpacas used to enjoy munching on them, and I found them tasty too. I protected the heads with bags to make sure I could collect some this year.\n\nIn the upper meadow, the eastern gamagrass (Tripsacum dactyloides) is starting the bloom. The lower parts are females, and that’s where the cylindrical seeds form. The upper (male) parts will produce their anthers soon, then drop off once the pollen is done.\n\nMy seed-grown garden plants of blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) are finally starting to do their thing. Unlike eastern gramagrass, which forms large clumps that can reach 6 or 7 feet tall in bloom, this species is just about 1 foot tall in flower.\n\nSallow sedge (Carex lurida) was one of the first sedges I identified growing here. A few years ago, I noticed that Canada goldenrod was starting to encroach on the sedge’s spot, so I started some of its seeds and stuck the seedlings in a planter in my seed-production area. Good thing I did, because I couldn’t find any of the original plants in the meadow this year. These in the container will provide plenty of seed to get the species re-established.\n\nHOW did I not notice this gorgeous thing in the back corner of the upper meadow? I don’t get back there too often, but I could not possibly have walked past this nearly waist-high fringed sedge (Carex crinita) in bloom or seed and not seen it, so I can only guess that some clearing I did back there last year gave it enough light to finally flower.\n\nSmooth rush (Juncus effusus) grows abundantly in the same area, and it looks so prettily spangled with gold when the sun shines on it in bloom.\n\nMoving on now to the non-natives, let’s go back to the annuals and tender things.\n\n‘Tall White’ bachelor’s button (Centaurea cyanus) really can get tall (over 3 feet) from self-sown seeds.\n\nLast year, I had one seedling of variegated cockscomb (Celosia argentea var. cristata ‘Variegata’) produce variegated leaves too. (The red streaking is normal for ‘Variegata’, but the yellow to white leaf markings are special.) This year, I have over a dozen beautifully marked offspring of ‘Hayefield Variegata’ and hope to have an ample supply of seeds available. They don’t all produce variegation, but those that do are fabulously gaudy.\n\nA few years ago, I acquired seeds of Wattakaka sinensis that the source said could produce variegated plants. Sure enough, they did, and I planted them together in a pot. The last couple of winters, I brought the pot into my basement and overwintered them pretty much dry and dark. They tolerated that but didn’t bloom. I explained to them that they had one last chance to flower or they would be compost. Happily for us both, they decided to cooperate that far, at least; now, I’m hoping for seeds. I have since found that the name was changed to Dregea sinensis, and then changed again. So, I present you with Marsdenia sinensis ‘Variegata’. For now. I still prefer to call it wattakaka, or wakawaka, just because that’s more fun.\n\nWeld (Reseda luteola) is generally grown as a dye herb, but it has a lot of personality as an ornamental too. Its form is best when grown as a biennial. Be aware that truly is a “reseda,” though; it can turn up everywhere if you don’t cut off the spikes before the seed capsules open.\n\nSimply lovely: ‘Black Winter Emmer’ wheat (Triticum dicoccon var. atratum).\n\nWhite-flowered moth mullein (Verbascum blattaria f. albiflorum) appeared here a few years ago and is welcome wherever it puts itself.\n\nGorgeous blue blooms and variegated foliage too, on a plant you can rather easily grow from seed? Yes! This is variegated dayflower (Commelina tuberosa Coelestis Group ‘Hopleys Variegated’). I started these under lights in late February. The plants are easy to overwinter completely dormant in a dry, dark, cool place, and the resulting plants are much showier in leaf and even more free-flowering.\n\nOoh, doesn’t this look like it belongs in a Goth garden? Spotted window’s tears (Tinantia pringlei) was new for me last year, and I’ve found that it is indeed root-hardy here. It self-sows as well.\n\nAnother wickedly cool thing: ‘Double Purple’ devil’s trumpet (Datura metel), with black stems and near-black buds that open to white blooms shaded on the outside with purple.\n\nOn the brighter side: ‘Golden Foam’ spurge (Euphorbia stricta). It self-sows freely and creates all kind of terrific combinations but also looks nice all by itself.\n\nSo pretty: grass pea (Lathyrus sativus var. azureus).\n\nA couple of uncommon herbs are coming into flower now, including maple syrup-scented blue fenugreek (Trigonella careulea), above, and ashwagandha (Withania somniferum), below. (The latter is an evergreen shrub in warm climates, but it can grow as an annual elsewhere.)\n\nAbove, the first bloom in my patch of ‘Finest Mix’ painted tongue (Salpiglossis sinuata) opened yesterday. Ahhh.\n\n‘Cramers’ Plum’ love-in-a-mist (Nigella damascena) is in pod now from self-sown seedlings.\n\nSome other nigellas are just coming into bloom, including yellow fennel flower (Nigella orientalis) above and fennel flower (Nigella papillosa ‘Mignight’) below.\n\nI acquired these Johnny-jump-up seeds as Viola tricolor wild form. They’re a nice mix of these light ones as well as the usual darker purples.\n\nDespite having no particular passion associated with silenes in general, I have accumulated quite a few over the years and enjoy them all. Above is French catchfly (Silene gallica var. quinquevulnera), a sweet little annual species that came to me as a seed gift.\n\nSweet William catchfly (Silene armeria) can grow as an annual, but it’s at its retina-searing best when it self-sows into a patch and blooms the next year.\n\nNottingham catchfly (Silene nutans) is another species that came to me as a seed gift. It is much more subtle, particularly during the day, as it is here. When the new blooms open in the evening, though, the plants really glow as dusk falls.\n\nI’m cheating showing this one in bloom today; it opened right after last month’s Bloom Day and has already gone to seed. It was a first this year, though, and I wanted to remember it, as I liked it so much. Its common name is usually given as Bulgarian catchfly; some sources use “cherry drumsticks,” though. The latter is certainly descriptive but sounds more like a marketing ploy to me, so I’m staying with Bulgarian catchfly. Botanically, it was Silene asterias but is currently Viscaria asterias.\n\nBronze fennel (Foeniculum vulgare ‘Purpureum’), in its elegant just-ready-to-flower phase.\n\nBack in April, I showed this one—candy carrot (Athamanta turbith)—in its feathery foliage phase. It began blooming almost a month ago and is still sending up some new blooms. Total height was not much more than 1 foot,\n\nAbove, a fellow umbellifer, but on a much larger scale: giant Korean celery (Dystaenia takesimana). It’s been flowering here for a few years now, but so far, I haven’t gotten any good seed from it. Maybe this will be the year.\n\nA favorite for fragrance, as well as its bright white blooms: garden valerian (Valeriana officinalis).\n\nClary sage (Salvia sclarea) is another favorite of mine for its aromatic foliage, but it’s the buds that draw attention this time of year.\n\nFringed pink (Dianthus superbus) will flower the first year from seed but really gives its all once it overwinters. Lovely floral fragrance on this one.\n\n‘Sooty’ sweet William (Dianthus barbatus) doesn’t have much, if any, scent, unfortunately, but ooh, that velvety red color. It is more perennial than some other sweet Williams I’ve grown.\n\nChinese foxglove (Rehmannia angulata) can flower the first year from seed and also acts like a perennial here: not a particularly vigorous one, but enough to make a nice show.\n\nWell, this was a surprise! A couple years ago, I received a seed gift of Iris ensata ‘Enkaishu’, which is apparently a wild form originally collected in Siberia, and I must have tucked some of the many resulting seedlings into the meadow. Those in the garden and my propagation beds weren’t nearly as happy as this clump in the first year for flowering.\n\nJune is prime time time for foxgloves, of course. The flowers of straw foxglove (Digitalis lutea) may be small, but they make quite a good show against the dark foliage.\n\nYet another seed gift, these beauties were from seed collected from Digitalis thapsi ‘Spanish Peaks’. They flowered for the first time this year, their second spring, at about 18 inches, and kept sending up new stems for weeks. They would still be flowering now if I hadn’t pinched off the new buds so my white common foxglove (Digitalis purpurea f. alba), which I cut back in mid-May, could have its opportunity to bloom without a chance of them crossing.\n\nGetting close to the end with a few foliage favorites right now, including…\n\n…the rusty brown Maori dock (Rumex flexuosus), a New Zealand native that grows just fine as a perennial here in Pennsylvania…\n\n…the foliage of overwintered ‘Hopleys Variegated’ dayflower (Commelina tuberosa Coelestis Group), which I showed earlier in bloom on first-year plants…\n\n…and ‘Sunspots’ annual sunflower (Helianthus annuus). Isn’t that spectacular? Each plant is different. This one is particularly promising, because the fairly even distribution of markings makes it more likely that its offspring will be variegated too.\n\nOne more thing…I realize that most folks aren’t thinking about seeds in early to midsummer, but if you’re interested in expanding your germination skills, it’s prime time for sowing spring wildflowers. Many of them germinate best when sown fresh (soon after they’re collected, like Canada wild ginger [Asarum canadense], above), so their seeds don’t have a chance to dry out and go into dormancy, or so they can get a warm-moist period and then sprout once cool conditions return. Hellebores (Helleborus) also fall into this group, so if you’re interested in growing Lenten roses (H. x hybridus) or bearsfoot hellebore (H. foetidus), which is ripening this week, June and July are the best time to get their seeds planted. I’m collecting new seeds every day and getting this year’s harvest up as quickly as I can: you can find them under the tag Collected in 2024.\n\nI’ll also mention that I have to start over with my mailing list for my seed newsletter, since I’m switching from Mailchimp to MailPoet. If you’re interested, you can sign up below. I’m lucky to get two or three of these done a year, so you won’t be overwhelmed with emails from me, I promise.\n\nHere’s hoping we all make it through the coming hot spell; it’s not like we have much choice about it. Endure as best you can, and enjoy your garden as conditions allow, and I’ll meet you back here for July’s Bloom Day!"
