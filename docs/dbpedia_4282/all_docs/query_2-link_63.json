        "text": "This garden has been a long time coming. In 2020, the City of Martinez applied for a Proposition 68 grant, which was not realized because the grant was not awarded. Within this grant application, an attractive wetland garden of approximately 300 square feet was proposed. Some time later, the Contra Costa Resource Conservation District (CCRCD) was contacted by an environmental consulting firm searching for approximately 1,306 square feet of tidally influenced land in Martinez for a small habitat restoration to satisfy a mitigation need. The idea to accomplish an expanded version of the previously proposed native wetland garden was determined to fit the bill. Thus, with help from the City of Martinez and the Friends of Alhambra Creek, the CCRCD was able to install this garden in early 2024.Â Â Â\n\nThe plants in this garden are all native, which means they evolved with our native wildlife over thousands of years. They are better adapted to live in local conditions and support local wildlife populations than non-native plants. Furthermore, this garden is a tidal marsh, a coastal wetland occasionally flooded by saltwater brought in by tides from the Carquinez Strait. These plants are especially adapted to survive in frequently flooded, oxygen-deficient, and salty conditions.Â Â"
