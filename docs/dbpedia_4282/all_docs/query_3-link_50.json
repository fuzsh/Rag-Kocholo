        "text": "1. Halophytes Dr. Ravindra. D. Madhekar Assistant professor, Department of Botany, S. B. E. S. College of Science, Aurangabad (Maharashtra) India\n\n2. • Grow and complete their life cycle in the habitats with a high salt content (Salt plants). • Name “halophyte” was assigned to such plants by Pallas in the early nineteenth century. • Commonly found near sea-shores (Mangroves). • These plants are physically wet but physiologically dry. • Saline habitats are not restricted to sea coasts only but they may also be found in many dry places far away from the sea coasts. • In these dry and salty habitats generally succulent xerophytes grow very successfully\n\n3.  Plants cope with the problems of salinity in various ways.  Salinity avoidance is usually accomplished by limiting germination, growth and reproduction to specific seasons of the year as well as by growing roots into non-saline layers and limiting salt uptake.  Plants evade or resist salinity by accumulating salts in their cells as well as by secretion of excess salts.  In the salt tolerant, the protoplasm functions normally and endures a high salt concentration without apparent damage.\n\n4. Swamp halophytes - the Mangroves • Mangrove is a West Indian name given to formation of trees and shrubs inhabiting the coasts and river estuaries of tropical or subtropical seas. • Common mangrove plants are Rhizophora mucronata, Kandeha rheedii, Ceriops roxburghiana, Bruguiera gymnorhiza, and many other plants belonging to the family Rhizophoraceae, Verbinaceae, Acanthaceae, Compositae, Caryophyllaceae, Palmae, Parkeriaceae Chaenopodiaceae, Plumbaginanceae, Ficoideae, Euphorbiaceae.\n\n5. • The ecological conditions which are essential for the development of mangrove vegetation or halophytes are: Shallow water with thick mud, Water logged saline soil or sandy or loose soil or heavy clays containing large amount or organic matter, High rainfall, and High humidity in the atmosphere and cloudy weather.\n\n6. • Important Characters of Halophytes: • The halophytes develop in them almost all important xerophytic devices for water economy. • Habit: • A great majority of halophytes in the tropical and subtropical regions are shrubs, but a few of them are herbaceous, for exm. Acanthus Ilicifolius. • In temperate zones, halophytic vegetation is purely herbaceous. • The shrubs are generally dome-shaped in appearance because of their cymose branching.\n\n7. Morphological adaptations (a) Roots: • Develop many shallow normal roots. • In addition, many stilt or prop roots develop from the aerial branches of stem for efficient anchorage in muddy or loose sandy soil. • To compensate lack of soil aeration, halophytes develop special type of negatively geotropic roots, called pneumatophores or breathing roots.\n\n8. (b) Stem: • Stems in several halophytes develop succulence. E.g. Salicornia herbacia. • The temperate halophytes are herbaceous, but the tropical ones are mostly bushy and show dense cymose branching. • Submerged marine angiosperms are among the very few species of halophytes that do not become succulent.\n\n9. (c) Leaves: • Thick, entire, succulent, generally small-sized, and are often glassy in appearance. • Some species are aphyllous. • In coastal aero halophytes, their surfaces are densely covered with trichomes. • Leaves of submerged marine halophytes are thin and have very poorly developed vascular system and frequently green epidermis. They are adapted to absorb water and nutrients from the medium directly.\n\n10. (d) Fruits, Seeds and their dispersal: • The fruits and seeds are generally light in weight. • Fruit walls have a number of air chambers. • Fruits, seeds, and seedlings dispersed to distant places by water current. • In Spinifex (S. quarrosus), : shows peculiar type of fruit dispersal\n\n11. (e) Viviparous mode of seed germination:  vivipary : The germination of seeds while the fruits are still attached to mother plants.\n\n12. Anatomical Adaptations: Root :  The stilt roots of mangrove plants show normal features with periderm on the surface, aerenchymatous cortex containing sclereids, normal endodermis, secretory pericycle, radially arranged xylem and phloem and extensively developed pith.\n\n13. • Pneumatophores develop a number of lenticels on their surface. The cortex is spongy and consists of extensively developed aerenchyma enclosing large air chambers. • Pneumatophores show variations in their internal structures. • Generally the negatively geotropic breathing roots show features of stem and not of roots\n\n14. • Stem : • Abundantly covered with trichomes giving the plants a greyish appearance. • In the succulent plants, possess thin-walled water storing parenchyma cells. • Mucilage cells in abundance. • Epidermal cells contain large quantities of tannins and oil droplets. • Cortex is fleshy, several cells thick, it may become lacunar. • Salinity causes extensive lignification of stele\n\n15. • Leaves : • Leaves may be dorsiventral or isobilateral. • Abundantly covered with trichomes. • Presence of thick cuticle. • cover of waxy layers on epidermis. • Protected stomata which are not deeply sunken. • Epidermal cells are thin-walled. • The palisade consists of several layers of narrow cells with intercalated tannin and oil cells. • In many species, leaves dotted with local cork formation “cork warts”. • Salt secreting glands may be found in some halophytes."
