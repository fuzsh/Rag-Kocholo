In determining need, Berkeley Preparatory School follows NAIS Principles of Good Practice. Financial aid awards are based upon FACTS Grant and Aid Assessment (FACTS) financial assessment of each applicant. It is important to note that Berkeley may not be able to accommodate all financial aid applicants in a given year. Complete applications and required documents received in the Admissions Office by the deadline will receive first priority relative to aid dollars available.

Deadline for Current Berkeley Students for the 2025-2026 School Year: December 31, 2024*

Award notification in late January

Deadline for New Families Applying to Berkeley for the 2025-2026 School Year: February 1, 2025*

Award notification in early March

*Financial aid applications received after the deadlines will be considered for our financial aid waiting pool.

All families applying for financial aid for the first time should contact Julia Loncar, Associate Director of Admissions and Financial Aid, by calling (813) 885-1673 or emailing loncajul@berkeleyprep.org. Families currently receiving aid must submit a new financial aid application each year. If the financial circumstances remain the same, the school will make every effort to assist a family at the same level of aid.
