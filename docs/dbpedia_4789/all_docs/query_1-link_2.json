        "text": "If a public school board suddenly announced that new, mandatory religion classes would \"promote the moral and spiritual values of the Christian tradition,\" opponents would gang up on it like kids playing dodge ball.\n\nBut what happens when a private school with a religiously diverse student body makes the same decision?\n\nIf that school is elite Berkeley Preparatory, what happens is a polite but strained debate among hundreds of parents and school officials. No one seems to dispute the school's right to make the change. Many parents, however, can't understand it and fear it could fracture a harmonious school community.\n\n\"People, almost to a parent, are proud to have their kids there,\" said Adam Goodman, a nationally known political consultant and the father of a Berkeley Prep first-grader. \"Why is it when times are so good and our children are doing so well at Berkeley that the board will make such a dramatic policy change with less than certain consequences?\"\n\nJust what those consequences could be is not clear. There has been a little talk of parents pulling their children out of school. There has been more speculation about upsetting what is seen as the successful balance between the school's Episcopal Church orientation and the widely varied beliefs of its families.\n\n\"I don't know if it's possible to implement that in a way that doesn't damage Berkeley,\" said psychiatrist Michael Maher, who has two sons going into the ninth grade. \"I think it will drive some people away. I think, in a more insidious way, it will keep people away.\"\n\nNeither supporters of the change nor school administrators would discuss the change last week, and opponents refused to speculate about what prompted the trustees to make the decision in the first place. A meeting called by parents concerned about the change drew more than 200 people last week.\n\nThe first word of the decision came last month in a letter from new board of trustees chairman Joseph W. Clark.\n\n\"It was a total surprise,\" said Tampa City Council member Linda Saul-Sena, who has two daughters in grade school at Berkeley. She thought, \"What is this?\" she said. \"Then I called three of my friends and said, \"Did you get this? What do you think?' and we were all totally surprised.\"\n\nIn his letter, Clark noted that the school had been affiliated with the Episcopal Church since its founding in 1961 and had a long-standing commitment to making \"the moral and spiritual values of the Christian tradition\" a key part of the Berkeley experience.\n\n\"So central to the purpose of the school were these qualities,\" Clark added, that \"the founders made specific reference to the \"spiritual' and \"moral' imperative of development no less than five distinct times, declaring that the curriculum should be \"challenging' and \"demanding' in those aspects.\"\n\nAfter a year's study by a special committee, trustees voted at their last meeting of the school year to direct headmaster Joseph A. Merluzzi to design religion courses for all students beginning in the 2000-2001 school year.\n\n\"Instruction will include the Old Testament, New Testament, Comparative Religion and Ethics, and will, in a balanced fashion, promote the moral and spiritual values of the Christian tradition as professed by the Episcopal Church, thereby honoring the school's covenant with its founding authority,\" Clark wrote. A newly hired school chaplain would oversee religious education.\n\nIn his own follow-up letter, Merluzzi tried to reassure parents that the changes would be made as carefully as possible.\n\nLike mediocrity, he wrote, \"tolerance is not a word in my vocabulary. We do not teach tolerance. We teach appreciation. We strive to understand and we value and honor diversity.\"\n\nMerluzzi added he would carry out the changes \"in a way that is sensitive to the concerns of all of our family members and with no intention to supplant or interfere with religious instruction outside of the school, but with the hope of preserving the wonderful assets we have in the form of our diverse population and which validates their individual religious traditions.\"\n\nAnd when it comes to religion, Berkeley Prep is nothing if not diverse.\n\nWhen classes start today, about 1,100 students, from prekindergarteners to high school seniors, will converge on the 44-acre campus in the Tampa suburb of Town 'N Country. They will come from homes that practice Catholicism, a variety of Protestant denominations, Judaism, Islam and Hinduism.\n\nBerkeley Prep also is the school of choice for Tampa Bay's monied elite. According to last year's school directory, Berkeley's parents included nearly 350 doctors, Tampa Bay Devil Rays owner Vince Naimoli, Tampa Bay Bucs coach Tony Dungy and Tampa Tribune publisher Reid Ashe.\n\nMost students come from Tampa and Hillsborough County, but scores make the commute from Pinellas, including its beaches. A few more come from as far away as Pasco, Hernando and Manatee counties.\n\nDepending on a student's age, tuition at Berkeley ranges from about $7,000 to more than $10,000 a year.\n\nFor their money, parents get a faculty with half the teachers holding master's degrees and about 10 percent holding doctorates. In 1997, 93 percent of the students who took Advanced Placement exams qualified for AP standing, and the school's math team has placed sixth at a national tournament. So ingrained is Berkeley's culture of achievement that the school installed a rock-climbing wall on the side of its gym last year.\n\nIt is not, however, a school entirely without a religious tradition.\n\nEach day begins with the Berkeley Prayer: \"Almighty and loving Father, source of all wisdom and truth, bless with Thy love and favor, the Berkeley Preparatory School. Inspire our founders, teachers and students with what is right and good that we may always be a credit to our country, our school and to Thee, the only God, through Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen.\"\n\nThe prayer both unites the school for a few moments a day and leads parents, students and faculty members to strike a balance between their own beliefs and a schoolwide religious observation.\n\nNew trustee Lyris Newman has sent her son, now entering his senior year, to Berkeley since kindergarten. Early on, Newman, who is Jewish, discussed the prayer and her family's faith with school administrators and came away comfortable with the school's approach to the matter.\n\n\"I wanted him to say the prayer,\" Newman said. She simply told her son that he didn't have to say the \"through Jesus Christ our Lord\" part.\n\n\"We understood exactly what we were stepping into and it was handled very carefully,\" she said. \"The school is very sensitive.\"\n\nNewman said \"the board is very concerned and wants to be responsive to the parents.\" Speaking for herself, she said she doesn't see the need for the change.\n\n\"In my opinion, I'm happy with the way that the school handles the situation now,\" she said. \"One of the reasons we sent our child to Berkeley is that the school does have moral education and does teach values.\"\n\nNeither Merluzzi nor Berkeley Prep trustees who support the change returned calls from the Times last week. But the head of an association that accredits private schools said he was a \"a little surprised\" to read about the opposition.\n\n\"This is pretty standard practice for an Episcopal school,\" said Skardon Bliss, executive secretary of the Florida Council of Independent Schools.\n\nEpiscopal and Friends schools, he said, have \"traditionally been places where non-Christian parents look to send their kids because of the quality of their education and because they do not proselytize. . . . They do not try to convert kids in those schools.\"\n\nAs part of the review that led up to Clark's announcement, Berkeley trustees met with the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Southwest Florida. The church, however, generally leaves it to individual schools to chart their own course.\n\n\"Our relationship with Berkeley is not the kind of tie where we say, \"You do this' and they say, \"Yes, right away,' \" said the Rev. Bob Cain, the diocese's deputy for Christian formation, youth and college ministries.\n\nCain, who worked as an Episcopal school chaplain for 23 years, said the diocese has drafted general guidelines for Episcopal schools but does not dictate the content of religious courses.\n\nCain said the Episcopal approach to religious education acknowledges its importance and always includes a chapel service of some kind. But he said it is not a \"sectarian\" approach.\n\n\"It's an academic approach,\" Cain said. Students are not \"expected to accept it as a personal faith commitment.\""
