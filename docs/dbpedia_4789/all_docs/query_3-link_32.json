        "text": "Pioneering History\n\nFounded in 1950 by the Episcopal Dioceses of Texas, our school has a rich history of teaching students of all backgrounds and cultures to live together in community. St. Stephenâ€™s was the first coeducational Episcopal school in the United States and the first integrated boarding school in the South. Our mission and core values are rooted in progressive, yet resolute, principles: honor all faiths and traditions, support equity and inclusion, respect other cultures and perspectives, promote social justice, serve others and be good stewards of the environment.\n\nDiverse Student Body, Global Community\n\nOur student body comprises nearly 690 students from 25 Texas cities, nine states and 13 countries. Thirty percent are domestic students of color with an additional 19 percent of students coming from outside the United States. By interacting with classmates from other backgrounds, students learn to see the world through the lenses of others. This helps them develop a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities facing our world. In this environment, students achieve their full potential by stretching themselves, making mistakes and growing from their experiences as members of a loving community."
