        "text": "Letters of recommendation are a part of the “hidden” rules of the admissions game for many families applying to L.A. private elementary schools. They are part of the culture at certain schools. Other schools frown upon them.\n\nWhen you’ve decided where you will be applying, you may want to ask people you know to write letters for your family. These are most meaningful coming from people who have a connection to the school. In other words, a current parent, alumni family or a board member, even a teacher.\n\nAsking someone you know really well (or hardly at all) can be difficult. What will they say? What’s the best way to ask? Will they offer so you don’t have to ask? All these questions may be floating around in your mind. At least they were for me when I found out that people used letters of recommendation to help their applications. At that point, it was February and I had to scramble to get letters for the schools where we applied. We ended up getting letters for two of the three schools where my daughter applied (and was accepted- Willows and Wildwood). We didn’t have any letters for Oakwood School, but she still got in.\n\nSometimes, you have to ask when you have the opportunity. In person, by email, a phone call. It all works!\n\nAlong the way, I learned a few things about those letters:\n\nSome people will gladly write you a wonderful, glowing letter of recommendation.\n\nA few people will never return your call or email\n\nCertain people will ask you for more information about your child\n\nIf someone asks you to write the letter for them to sign, do it! (Samples are in our book)\n\nA lot of excuses about “not knowing” your family means they don’t want to write the letter\n\nA conversation with the admissions director on your behalf may be preferred over a letter. That’s good too!\n\nIf a person says they are having issues with their school and it’s not a good time for them to be writing a letter, trust them.\n\nBe prepared for rejection! It happens, but it’s not personal.\n\nBe prepared for generosity and helpfulness. It just might be personal\n\nMy first introduction to the Temple Israel occurred when my son was a toddler and we joined the “Parent and Me.” For almost two years, we’d meet in the preschool for playtime, songs and of course, Challah bread. My son loved this program and he met one of his first friends there. So, it was nice to return to Temple Israel of Hollywood (TIOH ) for a recent tour of the Day School.\n\nTemple Israel’s Day School is a small school with a huge heart. It is a 200-student developmental Preschool-6th grade program with a broad mission that encompasses academics, community and creativity. I have several friends who are parents in the Day School and they speak highly of it, both for their kids and their families. At TIOH, it is virtually impossible to separate the strong sense of community from the learning that takes place in this urban campus located in an easily accessible residential section of Hollywood. Having a meaningful life is essential to the mission of the school, located within a Reform Temple.\n\nGlenda Dragin is the Day School’s admissions director. Walking through the school, talking with her about all aspects of its K-6 program, stopping in classrooms, chatting with teachers, students and specialists, I learned a lot about this gem of a school in just over an hour. As a former teacher, Glenda is very well versed in the big picture curriculum and programs, as well as details that are happening within the classrooms at a given moment. She seems to know each kid by name. Her ability to explain the school’s mission as well as both teacher and specialist led programs is something to note for parents who plan to tour the school. Glenda’s tour is thorough and doesn’t miss a thing. She is gregarious and friendly, with a great sense of humor and a sincere interest in showcasing the school’s impressive array of programs.\n\nTIOH has a unique clarity of purpose. It is a school that is synonymous with both academic achievement and a strong community of faith and service to others. The TIOH community includes interfaith families, gay and lesbian families, single moms and mixed race families. It is not a school for one type of family. It welcomes families of various backgrounds. Hebrew is taught and membership in the Temple is required.\n\nAfter touring the school with Glenda, we joined Rachel Lewin the head of school in her office. I was interested to meet her and learn about her perspective on education at TIOH. Rachel is smart and direct with a very sophisticated world view and the wisdom that comes only from experience. She’s an engaging educator who sees herself as an advocate for both students and parents. As a mom, she understands how difficult parenting can be and she wants to ensure that TIOH families receive education for their kids and support for their efforts as parents. Her calm demeanor made me want to ask her a million questions about parenting my own tween daughter!\n\nRachel accurately conveys the impression that kids at TIOH are in very capable hands. She is a head of school who values the big picture. In her fourth year leading the Day School, Rachel has created a path to achieve carefully selected goals. Importantly, she is confident enough to keep her eye on new developments happening in the education field and bring those ideas and resources to TIOH, even if it means overhauling a program or adding a new one. It is noteworthy that her vision encompasses a focus on social awareness right in TIOH’s local community.\n\nRachel explained a new (and guaranteed to make an impact) program for the upper grades, where kids will learn about—and find solutions to–what it means to be hungry. The Hunger Banquet will be a dinner where the experience of lacking enough to eat will hit home for the kids, literally. Some students will get a tiny bit of rice to eat at the Hunger Banquet, the amount based on what people in the world eat as their daily intake. Other kids at the dinner will receive oversized American style portions. Then, there will be a call to action, which includes having students help make Christmas dinner for a local church to feed the homeless.\n\nTIOH’s elementary school is housed in a compact, attractive building with an outdoor sports court/play area. It is much like the schools on the East Coast, urban and functional. Classrooms are large and bright, set up with a variety of seating arrangements and stations. Kids move around within the class, depending on what they’re working on. The curriculum, including the school’s state of the art technology program, is integrated so that classes relate to each other, rather than standing alone as individual subjects. Project- based learning is also an important component of the school, carefully planned and implemented by teachers in order that students are not merely handed a project, but instead work collaboratively to complete it using a range of important skills. Beginning in 4th grade, there is a 1:1 iPad program and every classroom has a Smart Board. Ipads help make learning more efficient, says teacher Julie Hersch.\n\nInquisitive educators and kids alike make this school a place that is humming with energy. Visiting the 6th graders and listening to them tell me what they love about the school showed me a vibrant, upbeat learning environment with a wide range of programs.\n\nTIOH has a totally awesome art teacher! Walking into Larry Garf’s art classroom was reminicient of a few of my college professors at U.C. Berkeley. Maybe that’s because in addition to teaching at TIOH, Larry teaches at a local college. He is visionary and totally cool, living in a Geodesic Dome in Topanga Canyon (my hometown). I loved his passion, his big personality and his down-home friendliness. Larry is also the school’s Child Development Specialist.\n\nFor Larry, art is about helping kids develop and refine motor skills, “essential to academic success,” he points out. Art is also about creativity and “releasing the imagination within” as he describes it. His belief that everyone can—and should—learn to draw realistically resonated with me. I believe that drawing gives us confidence in other aspects of our lives and builds bridges to other disciplines like architecture. Using everyday objects, Larry showed me some of the students’ work. My favorite pieces were those where kids used toothpicks and paper ketchup cups that were then sprayed with sliver paint, creating the most incredible sculptures. Once a year, students show their work in the school’s annual art show. Every kid can participate. This is where Larry and the kids find their groove.\n\nThe 6th grade leadership class tackles a range of topics including preparing for secondary school interviews. Students go on to attend Oakwood, Buckley, Harvard-Westlake, Milken, Crossroads, Windward, Archer, Marlborough, Campbell Hall and other public and private schools.\n\nThere is a quiet timelessness at TIOH that transcends extraneous bells and whistles. It is a sense that learning about what came before, what is happening now and what will happen tomorrow, are vital for each child to know in order to that he or she becomes an integral part of our next generation of well-educated, humane and respectful human beings. In other words, a Mensch.\n\nFor more information, visit www.tiohdayschool.org\n\nSaint Mark’s Episcopal School’s front offices are housed in a stately, renovated home on a residential street in Altadena. It is private and welcoming, situated on a lovely campus. Located on several acres, the school’s ambience is graceful and spacious.\n\nI visited the school on a sunny morning earlier this week. As a first-time visitor to the school, Joscelle Shen,* the assistant head of school, greeted me at the front door. She exudes warmth and kindness and was extremely attentive throughout our meeting and tour. Joscelle is the mom of three kids and a parent at Saint Mark’s, so she is extremely well versed in every aspect of the school.\n\nWe started by watching a short parent-made video about the school. I mention that parents created the video because Saint Mark’s is a school where parent involvement is both encouraged and expected. Each parent is asked to commit to 25 hours per year to help the school with a variety of projects, from the book fair or library to creating the annual report and a wide range of other activities. My guess is that many parents exceed the 25 hours because they enjoy helping the school so much. One of the most impressive aspects of this school is its genuine sense of community. Saint Mark’s parents are a cohesive group of families who volunteer and worship together. A friendly, low-key attitude defines this vibrant school. There is a marked lack of pretense and the solid foundation created by the school’s 50 years of tradition is apparent.\n\nSaint Mark’s is a traditional, preschool-6th school. Students wear uniforms and call teachers by their last names. It is an in-demand school, well respected for its extremely academic curriculum, which is a carefully constructed to focus on the whole child (academic, social, emotional and spiritual). The school has a quiet dignity about it. Nothing is chaotic or uncontrolled, either within the classroom or outside. The school’s mission of academic excellence, respect for diversity, self-responsibility and spiritual growth informs and guides its daily work.\n\nThe academic curriculum at Saint Mark’s includes core classes and seven subject specialists for science, Spanish, music, art and other subjects. Respecting and building upon the school’s history, the program is rigorous and cutting-edge. The director of the school, Doreen Oleson, Ed.D., has a consistent vision and the extensive educational experience to deliver upon the school’s stated mission. And she does!\n\nThe multi-dimensional program is carefully constructed. As expected, it includes requirements like math, reading and other subjects. Students attend chapel twice per week. Science is taught with “hands and minds on,” Joscelle told me. Students learn through experiencing materials. Spanish is taught through reading and writing, and also cooking and art. Notably, incorporating current affairs like immigration issues happens in Spanish class.\n\nOne of the most impressive parts of the school is the robust Tech Lab. Saint Mark’s is an extremely tech-savvy school! The Tech Lab is visited by students one hour each week, where they use a variety of programs to become proficient in PowerPoint, Excel, and Word. They also learn Google Sketch, Frames Amination, iMovie and more. Everything that happens in the Tech lab is integrated and coordinated with the kids’ classroom work. They aren’t learning PowerPoint just to know it; they are using it in their assignments. The Lab has two staff, who work with the students. Technology extends beyond the Lab too, into the classrooms and students’ hands. Every classroom at Saint Mark’s has a MondoPad, a very large iPad, at the front of the class. The 6th graders have their own iPads. Other grades share iPads with one other student. Saint Mark’s has made an investment in the latest technology and the staff has the skills to use it and teach with it. This is a standout program and it opens the world of technology to Saint Mark’s students in a meaningful way.\n\nSaint Mark’s has wonderful, authentic diversity in both its faculty and student body. There are students of virtually every ethnic background and one teacher in the video pointed out that many of his students are mixed-race, reflecting the local community.\n\nThe kindergarten classrooms at Saint Mark’s are very large, bright and welcoming. They are filled with colorful kids’ artwork, teacher’s information and inspiration. Each class has 20 students and one teacher who is assisted by a teacher intern (in the process of getting their teaching credential). There are two classes per grade.\n\nThe school will break ground next summer on a new lush, green outdoor classroom next to the courtyard that is sure to excite everyone.\n\nWhen students apply to secondary schools, Saint Mark’s graduates go on to the following schools: Barnhardt, Chandler, Gooden, Flintridge Prep., Mayfield Junior School, Polytechnic, Westridge School For Girls and other private and local public schools.\n\nThere is an understated clarity of purpose at Saint Mark’s that is truly impressive. Parents, faculty and students alike embrace the school’s tagline, “Passion For Learning, Compassion For The World” and it is evident throughout this magnificent gem of a school.\n\nSaint Mark’s is a sophisticated salute to past, present and future! If you are looking for a state-of-the-art, traditional school, you should definitely tour this Saint Mark’s. And when you do, ask for Joscelle!\n\n* Sadly Joschelle Shen lost her battle with cancer in August 2016. In July 2017 Dan Hare assumed the title of Director of Enrollment Management.” He can be reached at danh at saint-marks dot org.\n\nwww.saint-marks.org"
