        "text": "I came to this school with little hope, but over my years here, I have come to love it. I love my school a lot, but it does leave a lot to be desired. The arts here have the potential to be great, but they receive very little support from the school. Arts teachers are not allowed to assign students homework or give low scores because, by administration standards, \"as long as they are showing up to class, they're doing enough.\" This leads to a lot of students treating the arts program as a joke since they know they can't fail. Additionally, disciplinary action at this school is very unbalanced. The same offenses often receive different punishments based on the student. There's also a huge number of kids here who engage in marijuana use and drinking. Most students are friendly and intelligent but have little drive. It is important to find the right people at this school and surround yourself with excellence. Once you've found your crowd, it's easy to fall in love with Berkeley. Go Bucs!\n\nAs an alum, I couldn't be more fond and grateful for the education and experiences Berkeley provides. While attending Berkeley, I always felt both academically and emotionally supported by the faculty and by my peers. Berkeley's impact on students goes above and beyond the classroom. I truly felt that I was surrounded by faculty and peers who were passionate about my success and dedicated to fostering a warm environment in which all students can grow and thrive in profound ways. With such compassionate faculty and students, as well as the countless clubs, sports, and resources on campus, there is truly an opportunity for every student to flourish at Berkeley. The sense of community and school spirit at Berkeley is like no other and attending this school was one of the best decisions I've ever made. Berkeley provides every student with a strong and enriched foundation that is sure to guide them in their future endeavors, whether that be in college or in their future professional career.\n\nBerkeley provides an exceptional education and developmental foundation for students from PK-12. As both a parent and alumnus, I've been fortunate to have many connection points to the school over several decades.\n\nThe academic experience at Berkeley is best-in-class. The curriculum is rigorous and expectations are high, yet the environment is encouraging and supportive. Faculty provide a great deal of support and resources to ensure each student is successful. Berkeley students matriculate to top universities and earn top scores on AP exams and standardized tests.\n\nBerkeley's vision is: Berkeley puts people in the world who make a positive difference. Simply put, Berkeley develops students into kind, respectful humans. Academics are a big part of the educational experience, but it is the focus on integrity, humility, service, and morality that sets Berkeley apart. The culture warm, nurturing, and fun, with a healthy balance of academics, sports, extracurriculars, and tradition.\n\nAs a new student at Berkeley, I was welcomed with open arms. I was so nervous to start a new school especially moving in from out of state. I quickly realized I had nothing to worry about. The faculty and students were so nice and made the transition super easy. In the first few weeks, I enjoyed making connections with my teachers and friends and experiencing the school spirit, sports, and clubs.\n\nAs I enter my senior year, I look back with gratitude and remember the fun memories that make me who I am today. High school can be hard at times, but Berkeley makes sure to help in every way. For example, as I begin the final stages of my college process I am nervous once again. These are the same nerves I felt previously as a new student. However, because of Berkeley, I know everything will be fine. Over the last five years, Berkeley has given me a solid foundation, amazing counselors, lifelong friends, and the confidence in myself to know that I am ready for the next chapter of my life.\n\nMy time at Berkeley Preparatory School was nothing short of a privilege. From the diverse community and the incredible administrators to the dedicated teachers and coaches who treated me like family, there is a lot to appreciate. Getting involved outside of class was easy, and there was certainly a special sense of community at Berkeley Prep. It wasn’t just a place to learn; it was a place to belong.\n\nBerkely was a huge help in preparing me for college. If anything, I was way over prepared! They helped me get into my dream school of the University of Miami of which I graduated Magna Cum Laude. The teachers and faculty were incredible and always had my best interest in mind. They even sparked my interest in the career opportunity, mobile app development, through their AP Computer Science courses, of which I am currently pursuing now. Berkely has continued to support me even after graduating high-school and college. They even went as far as giving me the opportunity to apply for an investment through their new program BUC Ventures which invests in startups. My startup mobile app, WAVES: The Future of Film, won their investment and they have done so much for supporting my growth and understanding of how a business should be run. I can’t thank them enough and will forever be grateful!\n\nI feel extremely lucky to be a member of this outstanding Berkeley community. Having attended Berkeley myself I knew it was a wonderful school, but now as a parent of two students my every expectation has been exceeded.\n\nThere’s a lot of things that make Berkeley a truly special place: the incredible campus and facilities, the thoughtful academic programming, the opportunities to explore student’s passions through an impressive variety of enrichments and sports and the arts, and the diverse student body to name a few. But for me, the most impressive component of the school has been the tremendous teaching staff. Our experience with each one of their teachers has been outstanding and every day my children come home bubbling with excitement about all they’ve learned. Berkeley’s teacher’s focus on fostering the student’s love of learning, rather than teaching material and expecting memorization and perfection, will be the building blocks of a lifetime of love of learning.\n\nAs a current family at Berkeley Preparatory School, we have been extremely satisfied with the caliber of this institution. The curriculum challenges my children and the teachers are there every step of the way to ensure every child learns. The teachers are equal parts knowledgeable and caring, which makes every day enjoyable for all parties involved. The campus and overall atmosphere is well thought out and a beautiful place for children to develop. I was most impressed with the network that Berkeley Preparatory School provides you with- whether you are entering at the Pre-K level or in middle or upper division, the school is at your disposal to make sure your child has what they need to ultimately flourish.\n\nBerkeley Prep has been an overall incredible experience for me and has given me so many opportunities I would never have been exposed to otherwise. The resources are unparalleled, whether you are interested in STEM or history, with an incredible robotics team and a nationally ranked debate program. One of the most unique things about Berkeley is the community. Everyone is always doing something interesting, and I think a lot of my best learning has come from outside the classroom and through hearing about what my peers are working on. That being said, inside the classroom the teachers are all incredible and are clearly passionate about what they are teaching, and the flexibility of the curriculum really allows you to pursue your interests. Berkeley has truly given me the opportunity to pursue all of my interests, from being a varsity athlete to being heavily involved in community service and various clubs, and I truly think the community and learning environment are unparalleled.\n\nI love Berkeley. This is my first year and it's like no other school! The best part about Berkeley is the people. Everyone here has so nice to me and I have a bunch of loving and supporting friends. There has been no worse part, It's literally the best school ever. I would like to see some more variety in the food, and more fries and burgers and that stuff.\n\nWhen I first came to Berkeley during my freshman year, I went through a myriad of personal problems. My transition to Berkeley was difficult because of these problems; however, my teachers and deans did not sit by and let me fail. Instead, they pushed me forward, aiding me with study tools, breathing tactics to combat my test anxiety, counselors to talk me through my worries, accommodations for better extra time circumstances, and so much more. Through the use of my deans and teachers during my freshman year, I learned the power of self-advocacy, which has led me to be a successful student. So much so that when applying to college this year, I took every chance to meet with my college counselor and teachers, who gladly helped me with my supplementals during their office hours. Berkeley has given me more opportunities than I could have ever imagined, like being a global scholar, studying abroad in Italy, winning awards for theater, and being on the news for my community service work.\n\nBerkeley has been life-changing for my daughter who was miserable at her last school. She didn't feel inspired, she wasn't learning, the pandemic had changed everything and that school didn't know how to regroup.\n\nFast forward to Berkeley where my daughter can't wait to get to school everyday. She has true connections with her teachers, she isn't afraid to speak up (even though she is very shy) and she is getting the best grades of her life. I wouldn't change a thing about her Berklely experience. She's now a senior in her third year of high school at Berkeley and she couldn't be happier.\n\nWe have been part of the Berkeley community going on 11 years. My children started in kindergarten. We have experienced all three divisions (lower, middle, upper). Each division offers a nurturing environment. Each teacher spends time getting to know each student to ensure that they are learning in the best manner possible. The teachers make sure that each child is set up for success for the following academic school year. The school offers so much for our children beyond just academics. The school emphasizes the importance that students try new things. From sports, to music, to clubs, theater and more. The school also focuses on giving back to the community through a plethora of volunteer opportunities. The school is truly about creating well rounded individuals who will make a positive difference in the world. I know with confidence that Berkeley has built a foundation for each one of my children and that they will be successful no matter what their future is.\n\nI recently graduated from Berkeley, and I believe that it changed me in a unique way, as I left more honorable, confident, and well rounded. Ultimately, diversity wasn't something that I was really looking for when I was deciding on schools to attend. However if that's something that is really important to you, I know that it was hard for some of my African American friends to feel like they had a big community. The level of diversity definitely differs between grades though, so I’m sure other students in different grades didn’t feel that way. Other than that, there's no denying the top-notch academics and resources. It was rigorous, but I feel prepared for college. I truly believe that the environment here is like none other, and I have become a better leader and student. I’ll always be grateful for the experiences and relationships Berkeley has afforded me. Go Bucs forever!!\n\nBerkeley Preparatory School has been the most incredible fit for our family. We joined the BPS family in 2016. The faith based & diverse environment has been great for all 3 of our children. They have received the top notch college prep education in addition to an an extremely enriching environment for the arts & athletics. Whether it be on stage with the Advanced Theatre Ensemble or in the many Bands of Berkeley, in the pool or on the sports field, they always found their way to shine. There are additional opportunities for growth offered through the many institutes and programs. Our children took advantage of the multiple experiences BPS has to offer on a global scale too, from service trips around the world to college tours offering them experience and knowledge.\n\nBerkeley’s incredible administration, faculty, staff & coaches have superseded our expectations on every level and groomed our college bound children well as leaders & prepared them for their college experiences.\n\nI have overall enjoyed my experience with Berkeley. At Berkeley, I have learned and expanded my horizons so much. I have met many great people who I hope to maintain relationships with after high school. I know that during my time in high school, I have met some of my best friends. I have also forged relationships with teachers who have helped me with managing my stress while maximizing my knowledge. I love being a part of the Berkeley community because at the end of the day, we are all there to support each other. There is a great support system for both students and teachers. I also love my school because of how involved I was able to get in my community and the school itself through sports, clubs, music, and community service. I would say the worst part of my time at Berkeley was when I was forced to choose between doing the musical and Varsity tennis because they are the same season and I was not allowed to do both even though they were both my favorite activities."
