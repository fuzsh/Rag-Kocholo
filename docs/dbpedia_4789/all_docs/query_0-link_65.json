This includes independent co educational day and boarding schools, for 3 – 18 year olds and both in the co-ed and the single sex environment.\n\nWe have developed excellent connections, built up strong relationships and respect and also used the experience of our highly professional team who have worked in some of these schools in a variety of roles from teachers through to middle and senior management.\n\nWe are able to support parents in finding a school to suit their child(children) and as such have developed these connections with schools in both the education consultancy and the guardianship roles. It is vital that the two parties work closely and have a strong respect for one another to ensure the excellent and high standards of care for those in their care\n\nBadminton School is an independent, boarding and day school for girls aged 4 to 18 years situated in Westbury-on-Trym, Bristol.\n\nBadminton offers a holistic approach to education; to put it simply, we encourage our girls to get “hands on” with their subjects, ask questions and really get stuck in.
