However, even amidst reports supporting the accelerating rate of climate change, action can be taken to minimize the severity of this problem.\n\nAlthough Florida’s porous limestone base renders common solutions, such as seawalls, somewhat ineffective, its cities’ potential to “build themselves away” from the problem is key to working towards a solution. This idea works off the premise that, instead of focusing on coastal properties, cities should construct elevated buildings as well as pump stations further inland to be better prepared for the inevitable flooding of coasts. To pay for this roughly $76 billion plan, cities can utilize various techniques. For example, Miami leaders have established the “Miami Forever Bond” program, a $400 million bond that works towards mitigating the impact of climate change in the area. In addition, cities can request block grants from the federal government or ask for funds from FEMA’s Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities Program, which has set 6% of its funding to specifically help deal with this issue. Lastly, in order to push individuals away from flood-prone areas, the federal government can exercise eminent domain to claim private, coastal properties in return for just compensation to the owners. So, as Florida works towards a solution to deal with rising sea levels, cities should consider “building themselves away” from the problem itself.\n\nEdward Kuperman (Essay winner)\n\nSchool activities and accomplishments:\n\n1. Student Forum, President: worked with campus organizations to put on service, social, and fundraising events (e.g., Students Helping Students Scholarship); ran morning convocation; and designed/implemented environmentally friendly Cafeteria protocol (reduced use of individually wrapped plastic utensils & Styrofoam to-go boxes).\n\n2. Policy Debate Team, Captain: led research and preparation for policy debate tournaments; directed outreach to new members; competed in tournaments with novice debaters unable to find or unexpectedly losing a partner before a tournament; competed competitively, “bidding” to the TOC last season at quarterfinals of the Harvard Invitational; logged 100+ hours in service at the Berkeley summer debate camp and teaching debate for Berkeley Academy.\n\n3. “Donna Haraway,” Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Communication Studies, Coauthor: My debate coach invited me to join him in research for the introduction he was invited to write for Donna Haraway’s theory of cyberfeminism. The experience was incredibly valuable for me: I poured through chapter after chapter of Haraway’s original works and criticisms, researching the “C^3” surveillance complex and society’s “code” of heteropatriarchy; the transgressive “scrambling” inherent in the identity category of the gender-transitioning male; and the \"destructive potency” of AI development. Ultimately, I opened my eyes to a new world both in terms of academic research and fourth wave feminist philosophy.\n\n4. Berkeley Tutoring, Head Physics Coordinator/Writing Center/Math Tutor: I direct science tutor scheduling, tutor at the writing center during study-halls and our online service evenings, & tutor during lunch for math club. I have also been part of Berkeley tutoring coordination with other economically disadvantaged schools in the Tampa Bay Area such as yearly writing workshops with the RCMA and Character GPS mentoring.\n\n5. JV Tennis, Captain: As captain, I cultivated the spirit and hard work ethic of our group, and was recognized by the coaches' award for helping lead daily practices. Athletics have always been important for me in staying active and healthy, and I have been thankful for the opportunity to promote and engage in tennis with my fantastic team.\n\n6. Chinese Honors Society: While I am in many honors societies at Berkeley, none of my other involvements compare to the way my passion for Chinese has translated into action on and off the Berkeley campus. I attend the USF-based Tampa Bay Chinese School each Sunday (now online), and as the only student in my school’s seminar-level Chinese class, I use class time to prepare presentations and lectures for other Chinese students based on my own research and experience in China. As a member of the honors society, I am currently working on creating online tutoring and Chinese “Netflix parties” for our organization during distance learning.\n\nCollege or other post-high school plans: Yale University Class of 2024 (potentially deferring to 2025 to take a gap year)\n\nTribune Scholars Essay\n\nAccording to the 2020 RFF analysis reported in the Time Bay Times, sea levels along the Florida coast will likely rise twelve inches by 2040. By the time I have children, the ocean will have crept up an entire foot—or half the height of a toddler learning to walk. Growing up with my grandparents on Davis Island, I remember joyfully dancing in the rain as streets flooded, filling our driveway with small crabs and the occasional minnow. Yet now these memories are blemished; future generations may live in constant fear of seeing their livelihoods wiped away by the next super-flood.\n\nWe know inconclusively that climate change will exact a toll on every Floridian—a price for the denial of our collective profligacy. Unfortunately, these changes are locked in and the conversation must shift to mitigation to shield the next generation from the prior’s mistakes. Global warming isn’t localized—it will require a federal response that starts with changing the structure of FEMA and flood insurance to minimize loss of life and “sunk” infrastructure costs.\n\nBecause our understanding is constantly evolving with further research, it is only responsible to overreact now. The government must offer property buy-outs up to the median home price, paid for by a revenue-neutral climate tax—while the wealthy should continue paying their fair share, we must also incentivize the development of green technology and industry. Climate change shouldn’t destroy our homes, economy, or freedoms—but it will unless we act quickly and aggressively against it.\n\nEsha Bhatia\n\nSchool activities and accomplishments:\n\nMath Club, President. Organize club events/practices. Teach students geometry and precalculus before school daily. Individually placed 1st regionally, tied for 3rd statewide, and placed 15th nationally at Mu Alpha Theta math competitions. Mu Alpha Theta summer grant recipient for attending Williams College Math Camp. Competed in AIME in 11th and 12th grade, placed first on AMC12 from my school with scores of 105 and 103.5 respectively. This year I competed in Math Prize for Girls at MIT.\n\nStudent Library Proctors, Head. Read to elementary students, plan Bahamas book drive and movie nights. Learned from authors about writing process at National Book Festival in DC. I volunteer at the local library, where I help plan and run library events, such as LEGO engineering tournament, and shelve books.\n\nHistory Bowl, Vice President. Organize club meetings, practice trivia sessions, and intraschool tournament. Our team won 1st regionally and competed nationally.\n\nRunning Track & Field and Cross Country. I run 5ks in cross country, and I run the 800m and 1600m in track. I enjoy the camaraderie of the team, and running has also taught me to mentally challenge myself.\n\nPeer Tutor. Faculty-selected tutor for writing, science (physics, chemistry), and math (precalculus, calculus) during lunch and study hall. Tutor independently after school and have worked a part-time job tutoring math at Mathnasium.\n\nPlayed chess since pre-K. Extensively volunteer at chess summer camps and coach younger students. Tied 1st in state tournament U1200 division, won $400.\n\nCollege or other post-high school plans: Planning to attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology beginning in the fall of 2020 and major in mathematics\n\nTribune Scholars Essay\n\nVarious scientific studies have warned of the disastrous effects of climate change on rising sea levels, even predicting that more than half of livable land will be underwater in certain Floridian cities by 2060. Florida must take drastic action now to proactively combat climate change.\n\nCommunities should armor their shores against the rising waters and also start the process of retreating from the coast over ten-year periods. These initiatives could be paid for by an increase in Florida’s sale tax rate, as this tax is paid by both residents and tourists. In addition, property owners in flood-prone areas should have the option of whether the government should buy them out, and the government should offer to buy out any owners whose properties would be affected by rising sea levels within the next five years.\n\nMoreover, the state government should also provide financial incentives to businesses to combat climate change, such as by providing tax deductions for the implementation of sustainable practices. These deductions could be provided for moving towards renewable energy sources such as solar panels, or for reducing carbon emissions and non-decomposable waste.\n\nFighting the effects of climate change will require intensive preemptive action by governments and businesses, but if society takes all possible measures to increase sustainability and safeguard against flood damage, then Florida can truly remain the Sunshine State.\n\nAnuksha Wickramasinghe\n\nSchool activities and accomplishments:\n\n1.

The shores are a home to many, from the barnacles to the starfish, but as the planet continues to warm, without a change in action, once shallow waters will swallow the shores. The government should first turn to promoting natural, cost-effective solutions that preserve the beauty of Florida’s shorelines such as expanding beaches and restoring and preserving natural infrastructure through developing mangrove and seagrass forests, oyster and coral reefs, and barrier islands, as done in Palm Beach County. Compared to seawalls, which cost billions and destroy the landscape, restoration of natural infrastructure uses nature’s remedial power to fix itself, for the mere cost of thousands of dollars. The EPA, with a $6.1 billion budget, could fund this program, or it could incentivize investors to participate, operating as a cap and trade program. By participating in the program, investors can offset their own carbon emissions with gained credits or trade them to other businesses and governments attempting to adhere to emission caps. To further protect shores and communities, the government should encourage businesses and communities to retreat from the coasts, only buying them out if necessary, ensuring the viability of these solutions to protect the magic of our childhood memories and our home."
