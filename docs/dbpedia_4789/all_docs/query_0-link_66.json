        "text": "OVCA is accredited by both WASC and ACSI. This accreditation validates the integrity of our programs and diplomas and certifies OVCA as a trustworthy institution for education. This also assures colleges and universities that our graduates are ready for the rigors of higher education. OVCA is also a member of the College Board, offering Advanced Placement (AP) courses, as well as a charter member of the National Honor Society.\n\nAt Ocean View Christian Academy, a quality college preparatory education does not just focus on what is taught today, but what students will face tomorrow. One of the ways we prepare our students and adjust our aim as an educational institution is through standardized testing and a proactive college readiness program. These two tools enable us to approach the ever changing world of tomorrow on the cutting edge of academics and preparation.\n\nTo learn more about our standardized testing and college readiness program, click here."
