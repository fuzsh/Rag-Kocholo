        "text": "SPES Curriculum\n\nNov 2015\n\nI am considering ST Paul's for my upcoming kindergartner. I was very impressed with the diversity from open house but left with the feeling of not knowing much about the curriculum. I have heard mention of a lack of academic rigor but no specific example. Any insight into St Paul's curriculum would be helpful. Thanks UL\n\nI can write a bit about St. Paul's curriculum, though I'm not exactly sure what people mean by ''academic rigor''. Both of my kids have attended St. Paul's since kindergarten and I have been very pleased with their level of achievement both in and out of school. St. Paul's builds well-rounded adaptable students and provides experiences that are rare finds elsewhere. There is so much more to learning than books. Some salient points are:\n\n- Kids learn independence in thinking. St. Paul's teaches how to organize thoughts and manage time appropriately and gives helpful guidelines for study. However, the school does not tell anyone what to think, and discourages parents from helicoptering and over-helping. The staff provides the structure for students to explore many paths in attacking problems. But they are expected to do so independently.\n\n- By 4th grade, students are given complex assignments due many weeks out and must plan out their time appropriately to get them done using their own schedule planners (provided by the school). Projects are often collaborative (over google docs or the like) and teach real world experience in working with and respecting fellow students. Diversity is a particular strength of the school that you'd be hard pressed to find anywhere else.\n\n- Each class must present a ''chapel'' topic. St. Paul's weekly chapels give the entire parent/teacher/student community an opportunity to come together to think and learn about a particular topic of importance not necessarily religious, but socially important. Civil Rights is one such topic I remember vividly. Each class takes a turn at presenting their topic to the entire audience and each student has a part in the presentation. Over the years I've watched my children build ease and fluency in public speaking.\n\n- St. Paul's teaches the importance of giving back to one's community with service learning projects around the neighborhood. From the bird census program to making sandwiches for the less fortunate... each class has some positive role to play in its surrounding community.\n\nThis being said, though, I'll leave you with a final testimonial endorsement. My daughter had the opportunity to live for a year in Madrid, Spain with my brother and his family. She was okay about leaving at the age of 10 to attend public school in another country leaving her own home and family behind. New people, new place, different language, and she handled it all with finesse. And even though because of age differences in the two countries she went straight from 4th grade at SPES to 6th grade in Madrid. Mind you, I can't give all the credit to St. Paul's. She did the work, and worked very hard, but Javier de Miguel in Madrid was impressed with her academic ability. She often was at the top of the class on her tests and teachers there complimented the job that SPES had done in preparing her. This speaks to that adaptability to take on any challenge with organized thinking and confidence. Don't put too much emphasis on the academic ''rigor''. Kids who are encouraged and want to learn will learn and SPES will give them every opportunity to maximize their potential. I have never regretted my decision to enroll my kids into St. Paul's. If it was a positive experience for you at the open house, and you liked the other parents and teachers, go for it. St. Paul's is an extraordinary school.\n\nIf you have any additional questions, feel free to contact me by email. Sincerely, Katie B\n\nHi, I'm a 3rd grade parent at St Paul's and I can tell you that academic rigor is a major priority for our families. Last year as a community of parents and faculty, we updated the school's mission statement. During those brainstorming sessions, it was so inspiring to hear that over and over again the experience of the school's community was of a rigorous and safe learning space. By safe, I mean safe to make mistakes, to think critically, to take risks. Across the grades, there is an emphasis on collaborative and project-based learning, with support for the skills that students need to work together--how to plan for multi-step projects and hold themselves to high standards in their work. They learn to look at a problem in different ways and are challenged at their own level.\n\nThe kids also have a great connection with service learning projects where students are doing real life learning by using Lake Merritt as a science lab and connecting with local organizations to learn about how their actions can have a positive impact in their community. My son is doing the bird census at Lake Merritt for the City of Oakland (an annual 3rd grade service learning activity). It is amazing how invigorated and knowledgeable he has become about birds! This project is not only science, but also language arts, math, and art, and requires a great deal of team work. Weve been very happy with our sons progress and have a great partnership with his various teachers, as well as the Head of Lower School. The rich curriculum provides for an outstanding, well-rounded education in our opinion. SM\n\nNov 2015\n\nRE: AA parents' advice on Independent K-8?\n\nWe are AA parents of fourth and second grader at St Pauls Episcopal School. Cant begin to tell you how happy we are about our decision to send our kids there. One of the main reasons is we love the experience our kids are getting by being in a school that interweaves rigorous academics with socially relevant and diverse topics. As an example, in the past two weeks we have been blown away by the 4th grades classes presentation on the Black Panther Party and a school wide celebration /education about Diwali (a Hindu holiday). St. Pauls offers a diverse, inclusive and warm community. The diversity of the school is representative of the diversity of Oakland. The school offers positive AA role models through out the faculty and administration who greet the children every morning. It really is a great, positive learning environment for k-8. current St Paul's Parent\n\nMarch 2015\n\nRE: School for shy, gender fluid boy\n\nMy very shy boy started SPES in kindergarten. We transferred out after a couple of years. I would say that SPES is not the ideal school for a shy, gentle boy. Part of the problem for us was that it's such a big school - K8 - so there are many more important priorities for the school besides what's going on in kindergarten, such as organizing massive school-wide events, and the need to continually focus on development and admissions. This can translate to an emphasis on the health of the school as an institution at the expense of individual students, and it definitely did at SPES in our experience. I don't have experience with Park Day and Prospect Sierra, the other K-8 schools on your list, so I can't say how they handle this. The other problem we had at SPES was the strict hierarchical structure of the administration, where decisions were made by a small number of people who all agreed with each other. I think SPES may be getting a new director so perhaps this will not be the case now. But when we were there, there was a vast distance between the administration's priorities and those of the teachers, and there was a lot of teacher turnover. What this meant for our kid was that if a teacher had an approach that worked for our kid, but it conflicted with the administration's goals for the school as a whole, then the teacher (and our kid) were trumped. We were disappointed to discover after a few years at the school, that the administrators not only didn't know our child's name, but they were comfortable assessing him and making decisions about him without accepting any input from his teachers. Personally I would be looking at smaller schools for a shy kid. My shy kid is now in a big public middle school and doing great, in part because he had such a good experience in the much smaller private school he went to through 5th grade. local mom\n\nMy son is also very verbal and creative, with a gentle, compassionate spirit. Although not very shy, he is doing great at SPES. There they really attend to the whole child, have a very strong emotional/social component to the curriculum and are working well with the different temperaments and personalities of all the kids in his classroom. I visited five private and three public schools and feel so lucky to have chosen SPES. Good luck in our search and decision. cantamissa\n\nYour post resonated with me, I was exactly where you were just 2 years ago, with my sweet-natured son completing his last few months of pre-school full of wonder, while I anticipated his first year of school, kindergarden. Understanding his gentle and cautious demeanor, I wanted to make the best choice, knowing the impact it would have. Like you, the decision was not clear initially. I now consider it one of the best one's I've made for my child. He is a 1st grader at SPES, and thriving. His kindergarten experience was incredible to witness, the growth was beyond measure, and I could see through him, the support and nurturing he received from teachers, and classmates. St. Paul's has a diverse community and while that was a high value for me, I did not want that to diminish the importance of other considerations. What I've come to realize and most appreciate for my son, is uniqueness of the SPES community, the beauty of diversity and tolerance. Admittedly, the service-learning aspect was intriguing as well. Sometimes I remind myself how different 'school' and 'learning' may have been if we were not at SPES. I feel fortunate to be where we are, and know wholeheartedly the importance of it for my son. Wishing you the best with this process. Amanda\n\nDear Kindergarten Mom We chose SPES for our sensitive boy and have been very pleased with the experience so far. The message I remember from my own elementary school experience: People look different on the outside, but are the same on the inside. Ive observed that SPES takes a very different approach to difference: From the first day of kindergarten, the children are acknowledged for their differences and celebrated for them. Students are constantly encouraged to articulate the qualities that make their classmates unique and specialand the subsequent gifts they each bring to the community. It follows that there is less of a tendency for SPES students to make generalizations about or pigeonhole one anothereven by age 7 or 8 they are navigating difference with compassion and ease. If you ever have the pleasure to sit in on a childs classroom birthday celebration at SPES, youll quickly observe that kindness is held in high regard there. The students take turns expressing an appreciation for the birthday child (who sits in the front, saying thank you to each oneit is a sincere moment.) Some of the things I heard on my sons last birthday: I appreciate that you are always a good friend to me;  that you are good at math;  that you always let others join in your games;  that you always make me laugh;  that you are kind to everyone. I can honestly say that even I have a more complex understanding of my own child after several years at this school. Im less likely to refer to him as a sensitive or quirky kid, even in my own mind. He is simply himself, with a store of unique gifts and the confidence to offer them to the world. Best of luck with the school search! A Happy St. Pauls Parent\n\nMy son attends St. Paul's Episcopal School. He has a highly-sensitive artist's personality and does not have a whole lot of interest in sports. Though not particularly shy, he mostly likes to play quietly building models with Legos or constructing art. I can say for St. Paul's that he really likes being at school. Often at the end of the day, when I pick him up at 5:30 PM, he complains that I've come ''too early''(!) and he's in the middle of things. He likes being at school THAT much. His teachers have all been very caring and effective at teaching to his specific personality traits and needs. They have also done a great job in helping him to foster new friendships and really feel like an integral part of his class. (He is now in 2nd grade and has been at St. Paul since kindergarten.) The ASP program is also excellent in that he really feels like he gets to choose his activities. I can't speak to the other schools on your list, but I can highly recommend St. Paul's Episcopal School for helping shy and reserved students to thrive while encouraging them to build their social skills. My son has never been bullied or teased. It is something St. Paul's takes very seriously from the top down and is reenforced by the students themselves. Bullying and teasing are NOT TOLERATED as acceptable behavior. These are some of the nicest kids you'll ever meet. KB\n\nNov 2014\n\nRE: Progressive school with black students/teachers?\n\nSt. Paul's has one of the most racially diverse student population I've seen in any of the ''progressive'' schools (read private). I would also say that St. Paul's is as or more racially diverse than some public schools in Berkeley and Oakland. It's an excellent school with an amazing community that has a real (not lip service) focus on community, diversity and giving back. We've been at other fancy private schools that say they have all that but they really don't - St. Paul's does. I strongly encourage you to check it out. Public & Private School Parent\n\nNov 2014\n\nRE: Progressive school with black students/teachers?\n\nDear DeeAnna, I am happy to tell you that your dream is a reality! My husband (white) and I (black) are parents to a delightful 2nd grader. It was very important to us that our child be a part of a community where he didn't feel as if he was ''the only one.'' Yet, while we wanted a diverse, inclusive community, we also wanted an environment where: he could grow and learn in his own way and where his socio-emotional growth would be prioritized as much as the academics. We hit gold with St. Paul's Episcopal School (SPES)! Some of the highlights which continue to make St. Paul's a WOW experience for us are:\n\n* People Power skills - each week the classes will address a different People Power skill, focused on helping the children develop better social and emotional skills. An example of a people power skill is ''Bouncing Back'' which is about recovering from disappointments, as well as delving more deeply into what it means to be a good friend.\n\n* Just Right learning - SPES uses a differentiated learning approach. It was refreshing last year (1st) grade to have my son tell me why it was ok that he selected/read the ''J'' books and his buddy was reading ''R'' books. ''It's OK mom,'' as he put it, ''it's just right reading.''\n\n* Inclusion and Diversity - SPES has a very diverse student body AND you can see some of this diversity reflected in the classrooms. We've been in the community three years and we've had a rainbow mix of teachers - both in class and in after care. We haven't had a male teacher yet, but not to fear, we have several years in front of us of wonderful male teacher (and one's with ''color'' too)!! I would be remiss on this topic, if I didn't mention the socio-economic diversity of St Paul's. The school has a tuition assistance program and this means that motivated kids from many different circumstances come together for the SPES experience. Our very caring child is becoming even more so, by seeing and learning about different families. Most importantly, he is learning how to evaluate people for who they are and not for what they have.\n\n* The Aftercare program - Many SPES parents are working parents. There is such peace of mind knowing that the wonderful things that happen in the classroom (People Power skills etc), get played out seamlessly in After Care. There is a variety of activities, music lessons, clubs (chest, math), arts and crafts etc, for kids to choose from. Kenton Young, the director of the program is WONDERFUL with the kids. He's a personal hero of mine, I must admit.\n\n* The Extended Oakland classroom - SPES views the surrounding Oakland as a part of it's extended classroom. From service learning (ex: cleaning the lake), to physical education (ex: walks to the YMCA for swimming), to academics (ex: bird census), to plain old fashioned fun (ex: Kid's Kingdom park for kindergarteners on Fridays). Our kids are city kids and what better way for them to experience and get to know this city that many of us love so well.\n\n* Community - Community plays out in so many wonderful ways at SPES! There's Friday Chapel - don't think religion, but rather think about a celebration of life, led by different classes and rooted in something cultural or inspiration. There's Service Learning - where each class has a different service project each year.\n\nI've shared a lot here, but I would again be remiss if I did not mention the many wonderful families we've met since we've been at St Paul's. From our monthly mom's nights out, to the frequent play dates with different families, to tailgating at A's games, to weekends away together, the families in our 2nd grade class have become our peeps. DeeAnna, I am open to you or other parents here contacting me about St Paul's. As you can tell, I love this school . All the Best! Francine\n\nNov 2014\n\nRE: Finding a school that is a good match\n\nSt. Paul's should definitely be on your list. Strong academics but with a lot of attention paid to the issue of how to be a member of a community, social justice, etc. I had two boys go through the school and loved what they learned, both academically and socially. Don't be put off by the ''St.'' in front of the name -- the school does not preach a certain religion, but rather teaches the children about the variety of religious and spiritual practices. The school is very diverse religiously, including families like ours that are not at all religious. Anon\n\nSept 2014\n\nRe: Public school not working; any private openings?\n\nHi Cherise, I'm so sorry to hear that things aren't working out for your daughter in her current kindergarten class. I wanted to reply because I believe there is a spot at my daughter's school, St. Paul's Episcopal School in Oakland. There are only 15 kids in her kinder class and it is a wonderful, small community of learners! The kindergarten itself is a terrific program in which children are encouraged to work in that proximal zone of development--lessons that are ''just right'' for each child, plus plenty of opportunities for children to stretch. My first daughter (I have two) entered kinder reading, writing and doing basic math. My second daughter (in kinder this year), entered with less reading and writing skill, but more math reasoning. I feel that St. Paul's has been/will be a great fit for each child due to the fact that teachers have a true sense of students' strengths and challenges and they are able to meet children where they are. Another compelling part of the program is its strong social-emotional curriculum. I know that your concern was primarily academic, but I am a true believer in Edward Hallowell's theory that kids need to feel a sense of connection to their learning community to thrive. Much of this year is spent growing that sense of community, including understanding how to care for self and others. I have spent most of my career in education and agonized over the pros and cons of many Bay Area elementary schools before deciding to send my girls to St. Paul's; suffice it to say, I am pleased with where we landed. I'd encourage you to visit to see for yourself; the teachers and staff are bright, compassionate and talented--and the parent community to pretty amazing too. If you have any questions, please feel free to get my information from the moderator. Best of luck! Happy St. Paul's Kindergarten Parent\n\nSept 2014\n\nRe: Private elementary schools -- constructive negative feedback?\n\nGreetings- As a former parent at Bentley and a current parent at St. Paul's Episcopal School (SPES), I can't say enough about how St. Paul's prepares the whole child. With rigorous academics, keen attention to social/emotional development and diversity in race, socio-economic status and religion, I am confident my kids will be able to compete in any educational environment ahead of them. As the children progress in school, the same personal growth focus that results in kind, caring children helps them become resilient, tenacious, collaborative, thoughtful learners as they are increasingly challenged in the academic domain. I would urge you to strongly consider SPES in your hunt for a complete education for your son. SPES Mom\n\nMay 2014\n\nRe: Kindergarten openings in private schools?\n\nHi, I have 2 daughters in 3rd and 6th (middle school) grade at St. Paul's Episcopal School in Oakland, next to Lake Merritt. We've looked at many many different school in the Bay Area - public, private and parochial and decided that despite the fact that we live almost 20 miles from St. Paul's it is such an amazing school that we are willing to ''go the distance'' What makes St. Paul's so special is really everything! It is the total package, a great diverse supportive community, outstanding academics, community service, great campus (Lake Merritt, the Oakland Museum, Bart, are all ''part'' of the campus that the kids get to explore) and most importantly happy kids. My daughters LOVE school - my 3rd grader is reading at a 5th grade level, spelling words I have to look up in the dictionary, multiplying 2 digit numbers in her head, she's been on about 10 field trips that have enhanced what they are studying in class (just returned from an overnight camping trip studying the Gold Rush) and they just finished their community service project in which they conduct a bird census of all the birds Lake Merritt for the city of Oakland - who knew there are over 140 birds at the Lake and it's North America's oldest bird sanctuary, very cool that the kids have access to so many fabulous things. My 6th grade daughter's first year of middle school was really great. The teachers really instill good study habits, responsibility, critical thinking, time management and really important in middle school is the social interaction between the students. In addition to the core subjects they have Spanish, PE (4x a week!), a great art and music program, technology/computers (they work on an ipad at home and school). The school has not only a no bullying policy but they instill in the students to be good, caring, respectful, confident people. Academics have been rigorous but manageable, and my daughter has truly blossomed intellectually and emotionally. The teachers, and all the staff - school heads, secretary, Afterschool, are all very engaged and responsive and supportive. Another very unique special thing I really love about the school is the weekly all school chapel. St Paul's is an independent private school, part of the EBISA independent school association, and doesn't have parochial or religious based teaching (which many people think because of the name). The chapel is like an all school assembly, in an amazingly beautiful brick, stain glass window, chapel. Each week is a different theme - many different cultural humanitarians and holidays are celebrated - Hindu, Jewish, Diwali, Thanksgiving, Chinese New Year, Ceasar Chavez, Harvey Milk, Earth day, Black History Month (they also have a African American Cultural Celebration night/concert), etc. Parents are welcome to come and every week a different class helps present the theme. It really brings the school together and the overall theme of the chapel, and the school, is to be a good citizen, help one another, we are all important parts of this great community and world, to always be reaching to learn and grow and to let our light shine. There are many great choices for school's, and as I said we looked at many of them, but what really convinced us that St Paul's was the right choice was when I talked to parents of kids that attended the school - you can tell how excited, and grateful, they are to have their children in such a special place, and when you watch the kids that go to St. Paul's you see something special - they are confident, respectful, caring, smart, friendly, curious and joyful - that's what we wanted for our children and that's why I was compelled to answer your post, I had to share the good news! Wishing you and your kids all the best in your search - and hope it includes a visit to St Paul's. L.Goode\n\nMarch 2014\n\nRe: Have you left Beacon Day, Park Day, or St. Paul's?\n\nSorry we did not see the original question, but yes we did leave St. Paul's. Due to finances. We were on financial aid, but after the first year realized we hadn't budgeted enough for the school-based care during ''ski week'' Xmas, spring break. We requested a bit more in financial aid, so that our child could stay IN THEIR PROGRAM during these break periods, and we were turned down. A school representative that we met with listened to our request and concerns, but simply responded in the negative without providing any information for us about why it wouldn't be possible. Friends with kids in other private schools stated that their schools would have done anything within their power to retain a current family who was experiencing financial difficulties. It was a devastating and demoralizing thing to go through, and left us with a very bad taste in our mouth re: St. Paul's. Yes, they say they strive for diversity [limited, from our observations at the time], but they did nothing to try to retain us, a current family, during a difficult financial time. This is, of, course, our experience -don't know if it's completely unique. We wouldn't recommend. Not embraced by St. Paul's\n\nI am a current SPES parent who works at another independent school, so my husband and I wanted to move our child there. We have been so happy with SPES for our son; the faculty have appreciated who he is and have helped him to grow socially, emotionally, and academically. The community is warm and welcoming, and we love its diversity. We have also appreciated the way that SPES is part of Oakland and embraces the city. In all, SPES has broadened my child's horizons and given him a strong sense of himself at a place where he can be his true and full self, and it is proving hard to leave such a wonderful place. Anon\n\nAugust 2013\n\nRe: Looking for the right school for my daughters\n\nI highly recommend St. Paul's Episcopal. My nine-year old daughter started St. Paul's last year as a third grader, and our family has had an exceptional experience. We moved to Oakland from out of state last summer. The administration paired us with a wonderful 3rd grade family prior to the first day of school, and helped us build community before school even started. After a year at St. Paul's, my daughter is a different kid. Her confidence, which was seriously compromised by some unfortunate experiences in the school she attended from K-2, has been restored. She feels accepted and celebrated for exactly who she is. I fully credit that to the school leadership, who has created a nurturing and inclusive environment for every kid, regardless of learning or social differences. My daughter is an above average reader and writer who struggles with math, and she gets bored easily when she is not challenged. St. Paul's is able to meet her and every student where they are, and finds healthy and productive ways to challenge them academically while supporting them emotionally. The diversity, inclusiveness, the academic rigor, the school leadership and the parent community have been remarkable. Another St. Paul's parent and I were saying the other day that this is the school we wish we could have attended when we were kids. All that to say, St. Paul's is definitely worth investigation to see if it will work for your children. Best of luck in your search. Happy St. Paul's Parent\n\nI recommend that you check out St. Paul's Episcopal School in Oakland. I have 2 children there and we've been really happy with both the social/emotional aspect and the academics. We originally chose the school because while we thought many schools covered academics well, we were impressed by the importance St. Paul's puts on its students being good people and good citizens. We were so impressed with the older children and now use many of them as babysitters. They are great models for the younger kids. St. Paul's uses responsive classroom and ''people power'' skills to help the kids navigate social situations. As parents we've learned enough about them so that we can use some of the concepts at home. The academics have been great. They meet each child where they are at without making them feel like they aren't ''on track''. In math, they emphasize deep understanding and problem solving over memorization or rote learning. My son was slow to start reading (and is now an avid reader) and my daughter was a strong reader from the start. My son was never made to feel slow and my daughter continues to be challenged. St. Paul's should definitely be on your list of schools to consider. -Happy at St. Paul's\n\nMy daughter is starting 4th grade at St. Paul's and I encourage you to take a serious look at the school for your daughters. St. Paul's provides differentiated learning for all their students which allows each child to work to the best of their abilities whether they need more challenging work or need greater support. The school has learning specialists that work closely with the classroom teachers to help each child be successful. I believe you would find the curriculum challenging for your gifted daughters. The social emotional component is embedded into the daily curriculum and provides a school environment that is supportive of the individual child as well as the school as a community. Feel free to contact me if you would like to discuss St. Paul's. Nancy\n\nAugust 2013\n\nRe: Entering 8th & 5th Grade from overseas\n\nI highly recommend St. Paul's to you. We have had two children attend there, one beginning in 4th grade and the other just for middle school. The approach of the school is terrific and everyone is very welcoming to new students. The diversity is great and the teachers are wonderful. Our children are bi-racial and have not had a problem at any of their schools in Oakland but St. Paul's is truly wonderful. We also had a child attend another east bay private school and it was good but the overall experience at St. Paul's is exceptional. I note that the academics are terrific as well. Loves St. Paul's\n\nOur family has been extraordinarily happy with St. Paul's. We are a racially blended family with connections to different cultures overseas, and we feel that St. Paul's does an excellent job of respecting different backgrounds and building community. The stated mission of the school is to (1) reflect the diversity of the community, (2) use the community as an extended classroom, and (3) be a ''private school in the public service.'' I would say that St. Paul's delivers on all three -- in addition to maintaining a challenging academic program, the school is very focused on teaching social justice. Elements of this are woven into all aspects of the curriculum, and the school has a ''service learning'' program that is experiential and meaningful. Rather than structure itself as a religious school advocating a particular faith, St. Paul's teaches gratitude and spirituality through a multicultural focus at its Friday chapels (centering on subjects ranging from the unionization of women workers, to the Chinese new year, to Hindu celebrations, etc.) There is a buddy system through which the students become acquainted with children from multiple grades, as well -- all of which comes together as a community in which expectations are high in citizenship and academics. I encourage you to visit when you have the chance! Happy St. Paul's Parent\n\nMy son is multi-racial and was new to St. Paul's community in 4th grade. I was nervous about his transition, especially in that particular grade. The children and the larger St. Paul's community were absolutely welcoming and his transition couldn't have been better. In fact after visiting all of the usual private schools in the area it was clear to us that St. Paul's was truly rooted and committed to their school mission. It is an amazing place and I could go on for pages about what makes it amazing. In short- their commitment as a school community to service, social responsibility, and social justice is incredible and is echoed throughout the curriculum. The school community(students and student families), faculty and administration are all very diverse in many different ways. The academics are incredibly strong and the faculty is top notch. My son is now entering 7th grade and unequivocally ''loves his school and being there everyday''. Current St. Paul's Mom\n\nMarch 2013\n\nRe: Berkeley/Oakland private school recs\n\nMy son attends St. Paul's Episcopal School and we love it. It is located near Lake Merrit, is non-denominational, very diverse, places a lot of focus on service learning and kindness (its no-bully policy is definitely walking the talk), and has a great after school program. We were torn between our local public school and SPES and after touring them several times knew we made the best decision for our child and our family. I do wish there were no homework in the early grades. That said, a good teacher assigns good, worthwhile homework. I'm happy to speak to you about it offline. The moderator can give you my contact info. Good luck on your search. Moderator will provide my Contact\n\nSt Paul's or Head-Royce for kindergarten?\n\nFeb 2012\n\nI am feeling very conflicted about whether St Paul's Episcopal School (SPES) or Head-Royce (HR) would be the best fit for my very bright, expressive, creative daughter whom is African-American. These schools are very distinct from each other - if only I could take the strengths of each to make the ideal school!\n\nSPES Pros: Appeals to me for its diverse student population, urban environment, emphasis on teaching the ''whole child.'' Cons: When I toured the school, I wondered if there were any issues with student disengagement. I was also concerned by the fact that a large portion of the teachers are quite young and new to SPES (lack of stable experienced staff).\n\nHR Pros: Appears to have strong teachers, engaged students, great facilities, and perhaps stronger creative/arts program Cons: Appears really lacking on the # of African-American students. If anyone can share their experiences/thoughts related to the academic rigor/engagement and teacher turn-over at SPES (I have previously not gotten any clear explanation from current SPES parents or staff) OR thoughts about the inclusive social environment for African-American students at HR, I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks!\n\nLooking for the right fit\n\nWe considered both Head-Royce and St. Paul's and ultimately chose SPES. We are not African American, so I can't speak to that, just to the quality of the SPES teachers and education. St. Paul's is known for it's diversity, but there's alot more to it than that. I'm constantly impressed with the creativity of the teachers, the music program, the service learning program and the sense of community at the school. My son is now in 2nd grade and has had a fabulous experience. He is so academically engaged that he didn't want to miss one day of school a few weeks ago for a family ski trip! He was not particularly interested in academics when he started school but I feel that they have really sparked a love of learning in him. Both the math and reading programs are excellent. They manage to take kids where they are at, not hold them back or make them feel behind, and take them to the next level.\n\nI'm not sure how long the K teachers have been there, but I know they were already working together at least a few years before he started. They are both highly regarded and loved by the kids. One of the teachers was recently profiled in a video on differentiaited learning. Last year, first grade, his teacher did leave mid-year, and though I don't know the specifics I know it was for personal reasons. She was an amazing teacher and it was a loss but the school handled the situation well and quickly did a thorough search for her replacement. Luckily there's a second full time teacher in the class which helped with continuity. Our second grade teacher has also been at the school many years and we are very happy with her as well.\n\nI should add that I myself attended HR for 1st-8th grade and had a good experience there. I do feel that all the kids at SPES benefit from the diversity at the school. The range of cultures and socio-economic backgrounds can only benefit them as they grow up and participate in the broader community. Happy St. Paul's parent\n\nYou've put your finger on a big problem with St. Paul's - big teacher turnover in recent years. And for some reason when teachers leave they are replacing them with inexperienced ones. Everything I've read says that experience is a key factor in effective teaching. Our child suffered with some very bad teachers who were new to the school, one of whom did not even last a full year. Another I can think of was well-intentioned but had no idea about how to teach. I liked the urban environment and the diversity of St. Paul's too, but the teacher issues are a real problem. I really wish I had drilled down more on this when we were applying to schools and congratulate you for doing this. (I am also smiling about your comment about not getting a clear explanation for the reason for the turnover - if you go to St. Paul's you will get accustomed to not getting your hard questions answered.) I also note that you say your daughter is very creative. St. Paul's has a terrific music program, but the art program is weak. If I had it to do over again (and if my child could get in to Head Royce) I would go there in a heartbeat. Personally, I think it is not even a close call. Disenchanted\n\nDear ''Looking for the right fit'', I also have a ''very bright, expressive, creative daughter who is African-American'' and have struggled with a similar decision. Please get my email address from the moderator if you'd like to discuss! Been there\n\nI'm the parent of a current St. Paul's student and a graduate. I think the thing that attracts both teachers and parents to St. Paul's Episcopal School is the shared commitment to providing an outstanding academic experience to a diverse group of students that make a difference in their community. My children have had great teachers at St. Paul's, some of whom have been young. Supportive peers, a culture that encourages grade and cross grade collaboration, and strong Division Heads and Administrators all combine to help develop teachers and ensure that both experienced and relatively new teachers are at the top of their craft. An inspired curriculum that's contextually rich, differentiated, project based, and often inter-disciplinary, engages the student body and results in some amazing creativity. Years after graduating, my high schooler still talks fondly of St. Paul's teachers, buddies, projects and experiences. St. Paul's School has been a wonderful place for our family, I only wish the world looked and functioned more like the school. Happy at St. Paul's\n\nHi, we are an African American (bi-racial) family sending both of our daughters (3rd and 5th grades) to St. Paul's since kindergarten. We have been very happy with the academics, community, diversity and the faculty and student engagement. I have never seen any evidence of student disengagement. Because of the differential learning approach and the responsive classroom, my daughters and their friends are actively involved in their learning. Both of my daughters are quite bright (read way above grade level, adept at math, etc) and we have been extremely pleased with how their teachers have consistently managed to challenge them academically and encourage their intellectual growth. In addition, they have learned that all students have different strengths and challenges and they have learned to appreciate those in their fellow students. It is true that our faculty is relatively young, but having had some of those new teachers, they are fabulous! Also I believe the majority of the turnover is because teachers move. I am sorry you have felt unable to get a straight answer about the situation, I would be more than happy to talk about it with you. And finally, not to go on too much, the community at St. Paul's is beyond compare. It is a blessing for my daughters to see people of all colors and backgrounds, all socio-economic levels, in class and in front of the room. I feel there are two approaches to diversity: we are all the same or let's celebrate our differences. St. Paul's takes the latter approach and that makes for a vibrant, inclusive and supportive community. Most of the kids coordinate their extra curricular activities and parents socialize regularly. Again, I would be happy to talk further about this. Good luck! They are both great schools! Proud St. Paul's Mom\n\nThe question of St. Paul's vs. Head-Royce is a very difficult one that several of us have faced. We are an African-American family and had to make the same decision with our son last year and it was nearly a coin flip but we opted to send him to St. Paul's. We chose St. Paul's because it is extremely diverse, the curriculum is strong and instills several of the ''soft skills'' needed to be successful, and we were extremely impressed with the faculty and staff. Not to mention, we have witnessed several kids from St. Paul's who have excelled at the high school and college levels. While we loved Head-Royce we had concerns about having our son at the same school K-12. So far we are extremely pleased with our decision and I think several of the other parents in our son's class would echo my sentiments.\n\nIronically, we had similar concerns about the youth of the faculty but having witnessed them in action this year they are very impressive. There were a couple of situations where teachers needed to be away for medical / family reasons and I was just as impressed with the temporary faculty as I was with the permanent ones. It's also great because their teaching assistants get a great deal of responsibility and it is a great feeder progam for new faculty.\n\nI personally don't think you can go wrong with either school. They are both outstanding academically and the kids excel at the next level. The diversity at St. Paul is better but Head-Royce is definitely committed to improving it's diversity and is moving in the right direction. One thing I can't emphasize enough is making sure you consider the schools approach to social / emotional development. I think our kids will walk away with a fantastic academic experience at any of the amazing private schools in Oakland but when it comes to social / emotional development and building confidence within our children that is an area where St. Paul's absolutely nails it. They get it in the classroom and it is reinforced in their after school program which is outstanding. I've witnessed it first hand with our son and it's pretty incredible. Best of luck with your decision. It's a tough one but if you're choosing between St. Paul's and Head-Royce it's very hard to go wrong. t\n\nWe are an African American family with a daughter and son attending Head Royce in the Lower School. Like you, I have a creative, energetic daughter. She is in first grade and is thriving at Head Royce. Diversity is a primary component of the School's mission statement and the School Administration proactively seeks out a diverse student body. In terms of African American students in the Lower School, there is a significant number which varies by grade. The current Kindergarten class has a large number of AA students. In first grade, the numbers are lower and the school has actively sought to increase the number of AA students. In particular, this academic year, new AA female students were admitted in both first and third grades demonstrating the school's committment to Increasing AA diversity at each grade level even beyond kindergarten enrollment. Overall, the Lower School has a strong African American community and I would encourage you to reach out to current families. My experience has been positive and both of my children are extremely happy at HR. In addition, there is an extremely talented African-American female kindergarten teacher who is a positive reflection for all students, and especially AA girls. C\n\nMy child attended Saint Paul's for three years. I don't know Head Royce first hand, but I have a favorable impression of it based on visiting it and based on what friends say. I would definitely choose Head Royce over SPES if you have that choice to make. We did not find that SPES was particularly academic - when we changed schools our child was behind in writing and math. But we did know lots of very bright kids at SPES whose parents were happy with it.\n\nI do understand the appeal of diversity at SPES - that is one of the reasons we chose it. There are few private schools in the area that can match SPES for diversity. But you have to balance SPES's ''look'' with the ''feel'' of the school environment, which I think adversely affects both student and teacher retention. There is more turnover at SPES than any other school I have ever experienced with my 3 kids at a number of different public & private schools. To put it into perspective: We left SPES 2 years ago. Only one of the five teachers my child had K-3 is still there. My son's kindergarten teachers both left after his K year, he had a new teacher for 1st and again in 2nd grade, and his 3rd grade teacher, who had been at the school for a while, left the year after we did. In contrast, at his current private school, only one teacher is new to the school since we've been there, and she replaced a teacher who retired after 30+ years at the school. The other teachers have all been there for years. It is hard to overstate the value of a team of teachers with a long-term commitment to the school. SPES just doesn't have that.\n\nI don't know the real reason why so many teachers leave SPES. While we were at the school, parents were not usually told anything until just before school started, when a cheery letter would go out with all the new teachers' names and bios. But I think this illustrates the problem: the administration tightly controls the ''spin'' at SPES, and withholds information that parents really ought to have. I know that all schools have their challenges, and I don't fault a school for wanting to put the best spin on things. But SPES's strong drive to protect its image takes precedence over everything else, including building a cohesive community of parents, students, and teachers. This is very different from my child's current school, where input is sought before big decisions are made, and everyone is informed about the bumps and turns along the way. My experience at SPES was the opposite - parents were rarely asked for input, except in the most controlled way, such as a survey with pre-determined choices, whose results were never published. When I asked a question or made a comment that didn't align with the official position, it would be ignored or deflected, or I'd be told it was more appropriate for the Parent Council (which, as far as I could tell, was composed of parents appointed by the administration.) At SPES, parents are informed of decisions after they have already been made. One year we were there, a big construction project was announced. It seemed to appear out of nowhere -- by the time parents heard about it, the design and most of the funding were already in place. For the rest of the school year, the project was touted at every school event. Posters went up around the school, kids drew pictures of their dream playground, contingency plans were described in detail for the construction that would begin over the summer. But when we returned to school in the fall, the plans and posters had vanished. For whatever reason, the project had fallen through, but information was minimal and only reluctantly given.\n\nAt first I admired how well-run and organized SPES is, but as time went by I concluded that this was largely due to the administration's rigid control over all decisions, policies, and the flow of information. I learned that policies such as behavior rules for students were so general that they could be interpreted in any way the administration chose to interpret them, and applied or not applied as desired. Suspension and expulsion are surprisingly common at SPES, even for younger kids as we found out, though the school does not always call it this. We were told that our son was not suspended when his new school requested records, and another boy's mom told me that her son was not expelled, he just couldn't come back to SPES. This means the school doesn't have to account for its disciplinary actions, since the actions didn't officially happen. Parents at SPES also cannot know in advance what exactly could cause their child to be suspended or expelled, because this is not written down. When we objected to our 8-year-old's suspension, which I'll describe below, we were referred to a policy for lower school children that said students must be kind and respectful. There was nothing in the handbook that addressed suspension. At other schools my kids attended, an 8-year-old would have to do something pretty terrible to be suspended, like bringing a knife to school, or injuring another child, so I had assumed - wrongly - that SPES must have similar practices. There is also no recourse once a decision has been made, no matter how irrational it seems. Had I known about the school's discipline practices, I would never have applied to SPES. But I'm not sure there was any way we could have known, because the school did such a good job projecting the image it wanted us to perceive.\n\nAnother example of this is the way that SPES's desire to be seen as ''safe'' affects decision-making. Safety was stressed at admissions events that I attended and it is a very powerful draw for parents of 4 year olds who are considering an urban school setting. A school safe from bullying is laudable, but not every scuffle on the playground is a bullying event. My third grader was among those suspended when the administration decided that an ongoing Capture the Flag game at recess was actually a case of intentionally singling out one kid for bullying, even though this tight-knit group of 8 year olds had all happily played this game together for the past year or two, without any concerns. No one on staff saw what happened the day one of the boys was kicked during the game, but the boy was upset and the administration became alarmed. The lower school head, who was new, questioned each boy alone over the next few hours, suspended most of them, and determined that my son had a heretofore-undetected psychological problem. My son was not actually present when the kicking happened, but he had helped organize the game that day, so he was determined to be the mastermind. He did not understand what he had done wrong, or why he was brought to the office to sit on a bench for three hours. His bafflement was interpreted by the administrators as ''unremorseful'' and ''a flat affect''. (The administrators had no psych training and the school does not have a psychologist. However, the Head of School told us she had spoken with an unnamed therapist, who concurred with the diagnosis.) We were called in for a meeting with the Heads, and told that our son would not be allowed to come back to school unless we placed him under ongoing psychological treatment. Our son's teacher, who knew him, was not involved in the decision. She had already had the boys write apologies, and had phoned us the same day to let us know, mentioning that she'd long expressed concerns about the unsupervised playground. But when I brought this up with the administrators, we were told not to discuss this with the teacher, because it was an administrative matter and therefore not the teacher's concern. They held to their therapy requirement even after we - very reluctantly - had our son ''cleared'' over the next week by both a child psychologist and a developmental pediatrician, who both reported back to the school that nothing was wrong with our son, that he didn't need therapy, and could return to school. Both these professionals also told the school that this kind of thing is typical 3rd grade boy behavior, and not a bullying incident. The school did not return our calls or tell us when our son could come back - it had been over a week and we both worked full time. At that point we left the school. One of the other boys was not allowed to return to SPES. A letter then went out to all SPES parents about the two students who ''chose'' to leave after the ''unfortunate playground incident'' which I assume was intended to give the impression that the school was once again safe from bullies, now that my son and the other boy were gone.\n\nI know there are families who have a good experience at SPES, and we had a good experience too for the first couple of years. But if we had had more information about the school's administrative policies from the start, we would have chosen a different school and avoided a very painful experience. I hope my story sheds some light. Beauty's only skin-deep - it's what's inside that counts.\n\nWe have a fourth grade boy at St. Paul's and we are very happy. He is very strong academically and is thriving in the challenging but supportive curriculum. The teachers have been uniformly fantastic--creative, smart, engaged, focused and kind. I am impressed with how they have been able to teach across different learning abilities and styles with grace. As a college professor myself, I am delighted with the variety of successful ways they approach teaching critical thinking, quantitative skills, and aesthetic and creative expression without scanting any of these essential pieces of kids' education. In addition to the strong academics and really amazing music and art programs, the school truly teaches empathy and compassion and embodies the values of diversity and service rather than just approaching these as gestural ideals. a happy St. Paul's parent\n\nWith respect to your question regarding St. Paul's academic rigor, I can say that our family has been very pleased with the teacher commitment and student engagement we've observed and experienced in our daughter's classroom (she is in kindergarten). The head kindergarten teachers have been at St. Paul's for a long time (8 and 11 years, respectively) and, in collaboration with their co-teachers, have built a holistic academic and social curriculum. I'sve had the opportunity to volunteer in the classroom and am impressed by how the teachers apply the principles of differentiated instruction (they really meet the kids where they are!) and how the students interact with one another and the content. By way of example, for a recent session on storytelling, my daughter's teacher broke them up into pairs and offered them guiding questions to answer so they could build their stories; in the process, the kids worked on their listening, collaboration and oral communication skills and had greater clarity as they worked on their stories. We also have an appreciation of St. Paul's approach to educating the whole child. Our daughter's sense of community has deepened, and she has a keener sense of how her actions and words impact others. As pleased as we are with St. Paul's academic curriculum, we are even more pleased with St. Paul's commitment to developing community oriented and civic-minded people. I can appreciate this important decision your family is making, and I hope my comments are helpful. Feel free to contact me through the moderator if you want to discuss more. Best of luck! SPES Kindergarten Parent\n\nLike you, when we were making our decision about schools twelve years ago, diversity was a huge selling point - our sons are of mixed race and we wanted them to go to a school that reflected the community in which we've chosen to raise them. But obviously that's not the whole picture. I'm happy to say that I have been extremely satisfied with our decision to send our sons to St. Paul's. Both started in kindergarten - my oldest son is now a junior in high school and my youngest is in 7th grade. My oldest son is a bit of a dreamer, and not particularly self-motivated. His teachers at St. Paul's consistently worked with him to find ways to keep him engaged in the work and, ultimately, to help him understand how to be responsible for himself as a learner - an invaluable skill in the transition from a school of several hundred to one of several thousand. He was always academically challenged, and well equipped to handle the workload of high school (where he is taking honors math and honors Spanish). My younger son is more serious about school, and is particularly engaged in and excited about math, sciences and art. I understand your concern about young teachers, but in our experience the willingness to bring relatively young people into the school infused each year with energy, creativity, new ideas and the very latest in educational philosophy. These newer teachers were generally formally or informally teamed with more experienced teachers, and we really felt that we got the best of both worlds. Many of our youngest son's teachers at St. Paul's were there when we started at the school twelve years ago, and many well before then, and we feel that we've been advantaged by the combination of experience, institutional knowledge and fresh ideas. The bottom line is that I have two healthy, happy, bright, challenged, compassionate and kind boys - and since they spend so much time at school I give huge amounts of credit to the teachers and staff at St. Paul'ss. Good luck with your choice! Happy Mom\n\nOne of the many things I love about St. Paul's for my child is that it is real life. The children learn what they need to and sooo much more, taught in ways that connect the knowledge to their own lives. There is as much emphasis on the hows and whys of learning as the actual whats--thus raising children who can identify a problem or dilemma and construct a way to deal with it based on their knowledge of themselves, their strengths, and available resources-that is, kids who can think! This type of learning is supported every day at St. Paul's. Also, it's real life to be part of the world around you-we place great value on the opportunities St. Paul's children have to see, play & work in, and enjoy Oakland. Our daughter not only knows her way around the St. Paul's neighborhood--the school grounds, the Veteran's Green, the Towers, many different parts of the Lake Merritt area--but she knows how to behave and take care of herself within that public setting. She's had so many truly exceptional teachers who '?get'° her--their depth of understanding, both of child development in general and my child specifically, have made for many years of positive collaboration between teachers and parents. It's been a wonderful place for our daughter and for our family. Another happy St. Paul's Family\n\nI was surprised to see some of the replies to this question and how St. Paul's was portrayed. As a parent who has children at both schools, I have to weigh in on the side of St. Paul's. Academically, the school has been wonderful, and I am comparing directly with Head-Royce. They teach the same things but in a less rote manner. Head-Royce is great academically but my St. Paul's child is just as well prepared for high school. The music programs at St. Paul's are superior -- no question. Head-Royce is much more formalistic. St. Paul's is about the gift and love of music - something even less talented kids can have for the rest of their lives. On diversity, St. Paul's teachers truly believe that every kid can succeed and it represents a range of races and socio-economic groups. The kids view each other as friends, not categories. We've had no problem as a family of color at HRS but at St. Paul's we belong. As to turnover, the middle school teachers have been here on average about 10 years. The lower school teachers we have had have been great. The ''younger'' end has brought energy and vitality, which I thought was a plus. HRS is a fine school but overall, I prefer St. Paul's. Love's St. Paul's\n\nOur family has been part of the St. Paul's family for almost eight exciting and enjoyable years. Our seventh grader has thrived at the school since his first day of kindergarten, and my wife and I have become very active in the school and its vibrant, involved parent community. After all, what is more important than our children's education?\n\nI am confident that your daughter will do well at either school. I can, however, only speak about our St. Paul's experience. It may be helpful to know that our son is adopted and of Hispanic heritage, while we are Caucasian, one Jewish and the other Catholic. Indeed, maintaining socio-economic and other diversity at St. Paul's is an integral part of the school's mission. This includes teaching the school's students how to succeed in an increasingly diverse world. But that is only part of the St. Paul's story, albeit a very important one (especially to us).\n\nThe school's commitment to community service also is well-known, and it maintains an excellent faculty. I don't think the relative youth of some more recently hired teachers is necessarily a bad thing -- they are often energetic and can be most adept at using new technologies and introducing new curricula.\n\nMoreover, to put teacher turnover in perspective, it should be noted that St. Paul's has one teacher with 24 years at the school, two with 23 years, and one each with 22 and 21 years' respectively. While the school (including teacher hiring decisions) is not perfect, many faculty departures simply reflect our teachers' diverse interests, health issues, and other personal reasons (e.g., teachers moving with their respective spouses, choosing to be an-at-home parent, moving from teaching to a leadership position in the school administration or a standout accepting a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity).\n\nHappily, I have always found St. Paul's students engaged and actively involved in their classroom activities. Indeed, our son looks forward to going to middle school virtually each and every school day.\n\nWhether it's African American Culture Evening, our ecumenical chapels, service learning, our singular inter-grade buddy program, responsive classroom approach, new lower school math curriculum, differentiated instruction, our diverse student body and faculty, visionary school administration leadership (I could go on), there are a good many features that will make the school potentially the best place for your child to begin her academic career, start to develop as a well-rounded student ready for high school, and, eventually a life-long learner. To that end, we in the St. Paul's community look forward to inaugurating our new lower school library and first-ever St. Paul's gymnasium in the late fall.\n\nGood luck, and remember there is no perfect school; your daughter will do well at either of these fine schools. Signed, Happy and involved St. Paul's dad\n\nOct 2010\n\nMy child is currently enrolled in kindergarten at St. Paul's. He has a terrific teacher, is adapting well, and is stimulated and happy. I would appreciate any feedback as to whether we stay the course at a private (and expensive) school or switch him to Crocker. We are not wealthy and know that in the sixth grade, most kids are going the private route. He's very bright, and he's abundantly boy. I have heard that Crocker's class sizes increase as the kids get older and that there can be a lot of disruptions. I know Crocker is a great school with a lot of parental involvement. However, I have some reservations about switching him into a slightly more chaotic environment where he might get lost. I appreciate all feedback. And, yes, I attended public schools and know that they can work. I'm not married to either one philosophically. Save our money now or keep going? Thank you. Anon\n\nI don't know anything about Crocker Highlands but I am a St. Paul's parent. I chose St. Paul's because of all of the unique things that it has to offer such as small class size, responsive teachers, the very rich curriculum, service learning, spirituality, diversity, music and the arts, a supportive community and so much more. Being just one month in you haven't yet experienced all that St. Paul's has to offer. It is normal to have anxiety about your choice of schools, it is a huge commitment to invest in any school and trust them with your child's education. When you add the financial commitment of a private school it can feel overwhelming. I would encourage you to observe other grades and see what is in store for your child down the road and talk to parents who have been at the school for a few years. happy at St. Paul's\n\nI don't know Crocker Highlands but I've heard good things about it. Our son went to St. Paul's for a few years before we changed him to a different school. Based on the concerns you mentioned, I think you might be happier with Crocker. You said your son is ''abundantly boy''. Our experience at St. Paul's was that boy energy was frowned on and punished, sometimes quite harshly. Yet the school did little to channel and direct boy energy in more productive ways -- kids were largely on their own during recess and in the afterschool program. If the kids' self-directed play got out of hand, the school accepted no responsibility for mishaps. Instead, blame was placed on the kids. A number of 8-year-old boys in our son's grade were punished for rough playground play (no injuries, just aggressiveness during imaginary play) by having recess, art, and music classes taken away for weeks, being made to eat lunch in isolation from other students, being suspended for 1-10 days, and being required to visit a psychiatrist. I want to emphasize that there were not any ''troublemakers'' in our son's grade of about 45 students. We never saw or heard about any kids picking on other kids in our grade or targeting them for bullying. The kids were close, and they were kind to each other. But boys left to their own devices do at times play too rough. The school seemed unable to distinguish normal boy energy from bullying, and in its zeal to portray itself as a school without bullying, the school became, for us, not a healthy place for our son.\n\nIn terms of academics, we found that when we left St. Paul's for public school, our \"average\" son was about half a year behind the other students in his new class. He didn't have the writing skills needed to meet state guidelines, and he had not yet been introduced to some of the math concepts that public school kids were already familiar with. You also mentioned class size - our son was always in a class of 22-25 students at St. Paul's; we found smaller class sizes at public school. Our son had mostly excellent teachers at St. Paul's, and made many friends, and there were many things we loved about the school. But in the end, it was the arbitrary policies and the top-down enforcement of rules that bothered us. So I don't think it would be a bad idea at all to save your money and change to public school. anon\n\nPlease ask the moderator for my contact info. SPES parent who will tell you my experience\n\nI live in Crocker Highlands and have 2 childen at St. Pauls, one in the middle school and one in the lower school. I would urge you to revisit the reasons why you chose St. Paul's in the first place. We chose St. Paul's not only because of its academic excellence, but also because of its diversity and true reflection of the urban environment around us, in addition to the Service Learning Program and it's spirituality. Sure, you can receive a good academnic education at Crocker Highlands, but during these formative years of a child's development, these programs are foundational in developing a whole person, not just a smart child. You may want to spend some time with a few graduates of the school to truly understand the value of a St. Paul's education. They are some of the most impressive young adults you would want to meet. anon\n\nI strongly encourage you to explore all that St. Paul's has to offer before making up your mind. I have two boys at the older grades at St. Paul's who started at kindergarten. Their classes have always been warm and rich with educational and social opportunities and encouragement. My boys have learned so much about how to treat one another, about human respect and empathy. What St. Paul's has taught them, at EVERY grade level, is going to serve them well throughout their lives and hopefully benefit those around them. I am always reminded by non-St Paul's people about how the graduates/students are respectful, well behaved and very comfortable in their surroundings. What is emphasized at the school is ''how to learn'' and ''how to think'' and ''how to problem solve'' and not merely memorization or fact transfers. As we get closer to high school I am increasingly grateful for all the educational tools and knowledge my boys have acquired at St. Paul's that will enable them to succeed in high school and beyond. I have always felt that there is room for everyone at St. Paul's and each child is encouraged to explore and reach the potential within them; as you can see for yourself, the school does not cultivate only one type of child but children of every fabric of society. That is TRUE education. Please do not hesitate to speak to the school's administrators as they are also very helpful. Good luck. Grateful to be at St. Paul's\n\nWe live in the Crocker Highlands neighborhood and chose to send both of our boys to St. Paul's. First, let me say that I've heard very good things about Crocker. My oldest son has several good friends who went to Crocker for elementary school and transferred to St. Paul's for middle school, and they seemed very happy with their experience at Crocker. We made our decision based largely on the ''extras'' that St. Paul's offers that public schools - no matter how good - simply can't. Both my boys started at St. Paul's in kindergarten. My oldest son is now a sophomore at Bishop O'Dowd, and was very well prepared for the academics there. He is taking honors classes in math and Spanish. His best friend from St. Paul's takes honors classes in English and science. My younger son is a sixth grader at St. Paul's. I was surprised to read the post about a negative school reaction to ''boy energy'' - our experience could not be more different. Just one example - my ''abundantly boy'' sixth grader had quite a bit of boy energy that was distracting his class in fifth grade. His teacher tried several strategies before realizing that he could concentrate (and be less disruptive) if he was allowed to stand, stretch and even pace a little when he needed to, even if it was in the middle of a lesson. His teacher rearranged his seat to allow him to do that without distracting others and his ability to concentrate dramatically increased. We've not experienced the types of playground problems the other writer did - but St. Paul's kids are expected to take responsibility for their own behavior and the school has very clear rules on bullying and overly-aggressive play. Kids will face consequences for their actions, something we've always viewed as a positive. It really has been a perfect school for our family. To the original poster - what a blessing to live in a place where you have great private and public school choices! I don't think you will ever regret choosing St. Paul's - and good luck with your education decisions in the coming years. anon\n\nAs a parent of 2 SPES children (1 boy and 1 girl) and an alumni of St. Paul's School, I have watched the school grow and change over the decades. My daughter also has C,abundantC. energy and personality, this was one of the reasons we chose St. Paul's. We wanted an environment that would channel and encourage her in a positive way. We also wanted a school that emphasized personal development, community as well academics, and devoted a portion of the curriculum to these non-traditional elements. As we enter our 3rd year as SPES parents we are very pleased with the well rounded education our children are receiving. In addition to the personal and spiritual development, a commitment to physical education, art and music, and the benefits of active play give us the feeling that our investment in our children's education is a good one. Given the state of the public school system in California, there is unfortunately very little flexibility or resources to devote to non academic goals. This is truly unfortunate. So to the question of C,is it worth itC. is a resounding yes. Fortunately, our experience with the school's administration and disciplinary tactics do not mirror the previous post that had a negative experience. We have found the faculty and staff at St. Paul's extremely fair and responsive to parents' concerns. While we don't have recent experience with the public school system, and surely every institution has pluses and minuses, public schools have to teach to the state mandated curriculum, and most do not have the resources to do much more than that. St. Paul' s and its community give my children a learning environment that is at once realistic, compassionate, accepting and challenging and provides them with a breadth of education that is very uncommon in public schools. This is reflected in the graduating class each year, most of whom are clearly unique individuals, independent, intelligent and creative. -Happy St. Paul's Parent\n\neditor note: responses were also received about Crocker Highlands Elementary\n\nNov 2009\n\nRe: Which middle school for CPS students?\n\nShort answer: I have a freshman at CPS who went to St. Paul's. He says he has to stretch intellectually much more than in middle school but is very happy and enjoying the academic rigor. He summed up: Success at CPS is more about motivation than academic preparation. I am happy to talk specifics if you want to contact me directly. leslie\n\nOct 2009\n\nRe: Public elementary school to private middle school?\n\nWe transfered our twin boys from a private K-5 to St Paul's Episcopal School in the 6th grade. We found that they were very ready for a new school experience at that time. Although they had a wonderful K-5 school and were anxious about starting a new 6th grade, within the first week they were making new friends and enjoying another community. St. Paul's is a K-8 school and they do a very good job of integrating the new students at the beginning of the year. We've found it to be exceptinal both accademically and socially and our boys grew from the experience. They will be very ready to start a new school for high school. Nanci\n\nAug 2009\n\nI have heard that there were three families that left St. Paul's First Grade and moved to other schools at the end of the 2008-2009 school year? This is unusual as the families remained local. Is there something going on at St. Paul? We are considering St. Paul for our son next year and would appreciate any feedback. concerned mom\n\nSt. Paul's is an amazing school, and I feel lucky that my children have been able to receive their education there. You posted a concern that there might be ''something going on'' at the school because a few families left after 1st grade. I can't speak to those particular families and their reasons for leaving, but a few people depart every school every year for a variety of reasons -- financial concerns (especially in this economy), or the school isn't a good fit for that child. There is not an exodus from St. Paul's, on the contrary, the kindergarten had so many families enroll that the school hired an additional K teacher.\n\nI urge you to look at St. Paul's in the fall, where you will find strong academics, a fabulous music and arts program, meaningful service learning, and a warm environment that nurtures learning. Happy St. Paul's Parent\n\nMy son just completed 1st grade at St Paul's School. The three families that are leaving are all going to Head Royce. They, as far as I know, were not unhappy with St Pauls just looking for something else. My son had a great year at St Pauls. I cannot say enough wonderful things about the school-- great teachers, welcoming community, very diverse, excellent academics. I do not think there is ANY reason for concern. St Pauls Parent\n\nAlthough I'm not a St Paul's parent and can't address what's going on there specifically, I did want to chime in and say that turnover in the private schools is pretty normal. My kids have been going to an Oakland private school for 5 years now, and every year a few kids leave each grade and a few new kids come in. The reasons for leaving are as diverse as the student body -- can't afford private school, bought a house in Piedmont, school not a good fit. St Paul's is a school with a good reputation. I wouldn't worry.\n\nI am writing as a parent of a soon to be second grader at St. Paul's. Our son is thriving at St. Paul's--he has been there for K and 1st grade. He is supported and challenged academically, socially, and emotionally. He is always excited to go to school, never wanting to miss a day (itself a huge signifier to me that things are working and working beautifully). As a college professor, I am wowed by the dedication and brilliance of the curriculum and the ways in which the teachers create and implement it with care and attention to individual student's levels. For example, our son read before K, but he has never felt either or bored or underchallenged. The teachers have been amazing--so much so that I fear I am going to sound untrustworthy or frothy in my praise of them.\n\nWe are a small class, and seem to be a class in which a number of families have needed to move their kids because of a variety of reasons including money, keeping two kids together, or other non antiSP's reasons.\n\nWe are a diverse and caring group of parents who enjoy getting together outside of school events (we have a parent-organized picnic in a couple weeks, for example), and I encourage you to come and talk to any of us, or any other parents, to get a sense of our feelings about the school. I could wax poetic about meaningful vs additive community service, real diversity--that includes economics as well as ethnicity and sexual orientation, dedicated and smart teachers, and, most critically, happy well adjusted kids.\n\nMy sister works at CPS while in grad school and she comments that she can always spot a STP's kid--they are the ones with the can do attitudes, who are grounded and comfortable with the praxis as well as theories of difference and social justice, who are academically prepared and willing to question, to ponder, and to enjoy themselves while doing so. SPES parent\n\nSt. Paul's is a wonderful school! Our son is in the class now heading to second grade and his experience has been fantastic. The teachers have been great so far and I hear that we can look forward to equally good ones in the upper grades. I can't say enough about how well the teachers have handled both the academic and social development of the children in our class. At first, my son was not particularly interested in school other than as a means to see his friends, but now he is eager to go every day and excited about the material he is learning--and he is learning a lot.\n\nFor us, the school has offered a good balance of the traditional and the progressive; it is neither too ''crunchy'' nor too rigid. The music and performance program is outstanding. The kids get plenty of physical activity. The service learning program is well established and very well run. And the school really does help the kids learn to take responsibility: as a small example, I still remember when my son came home from kindergarten and cleaned up the entire living room on his own initiative, not once but a few times.\n\nBy the way, it's not particularly unusual for families to change schools as they search for a good fit. No school is perfect for everyone. The families that left this year did so for different reasons, some of which had little to do with St. Paul's itself. Please come visit the school and see how it feels to you. We are very happy there! Happy St. Paul's family\n\nI think it is wise that you are looking at the turnover rate as a factor in your decision and wondering what is going on. Sometimes a mass exodus signifies something unusual going on with a school. Our daughters attend a private school and we have not seen 3 kids leave any one grade in a given year. It's good that you are asking questions now instead of regretting your decision later. I hope you get the answers you need and find the school of your dreams. anon\n\nFeb 2009\n\nWe are considering St Paul's for my child entering middle school. Can anyone offer any comparisons of St Paul's vs Beacon? I appreciated the St. Paul's information from the previous post, but the last posting made me wonder how well St. Paul's would be for a child who may need more personal academic assistance. Would he get lost in the shuffle in the large class size of St Paul's? I want my child challenged, but not overwhelmed (not the best student, but attentive and putting forth effort) I was also concerned to hear from the poster about their experience with disruptive kids who impacted classes. Thanks for any help in making this big decision. Confused\n\nI have a child at St. Paul's middle school, and one who graduated from St. Paul's. I can't make a direct comparison with Beacon, but I can say that the class size at St. Paul's is not large. The 7th grade has two sections, one with 21 kids, one with 22. My older son's class was larger (24 kids per class), but the school has recently made a commitment to reduce class sizes and they are sticking to it. The teachers are experienced and manage the classrooms very well. As for differentiated learning, the teachers gave my older child with learning challenges a lot of extra attention, and they give my younger child, who is accelerated, extra work so that he's challenged. Discipline issues arise at any middle school, but they run a tight ship at St. Paul's and have high expectations for good behavior. St. Paul's is a great place; I hope you come! Anon\n\nI can't answer your question about Beacon, but my son is in 2nd grade at St. Paul's. He's been there since kindergarten. My two older children attended public schools, so I have some insight into how children are supported and encouraged at this age. First of all, I don't think there is a large class size at St. Paul's. There are 22 children in my son's 2nd grade class, and that has been consistent since kindergarten -- he had two teachers in kindergarten, so basically 11 kids per teacher, and in first grade, a teacher plus asst. teacher. This year there is an asst. teacher that is shared with the other 2nd grade class, and there is also an aide in who helps one of his classmates and who is there every day. Because of the emphasis at St. Paul's on personal responsibility and respect, the classroom atmosphere is calm and much more conducive to individualized instruction, and I do see much evidence of individualized instruction. Like your son, my son also needs ''more personal academic assistance''. I think that St. Paul's does an excellent job of challenging each student at his own level -- this is one of the school's hallmarks. In my son's case, many of his classmates began reading in kindergarten and by first grade most were reading well enough to sit at their desks and read books to themselves. But my son really did not catch on to reading until this year in 2nd grade. In first grade, he received one-on-one reading coaching every day from a reading specialist. He was never pressured to read above the level he was able to, and he was never made to feel that he was deficient in any way. He had no idea that most of his classmates were well ahead of him in reading. He made great strides last year, and the extra help has continued this year. I am very satisfied that his needs have been met and that he is being challenged at a level appropriate to his ability. His teacher provides similar challenges for the more advanced students in his class, and all the children receive report card grades based on their ability, not on their ranking in the class or on some standard that has been pre-determined. I feel that my son has been given the best possible support, while at the same time he is encouraged to reach higher. I am most impressed with St. Paul's emphasis on personal responsibility. For example, my son has been taught to work on his own to complete homework to the best of his ability, to reason things out and to try something hard. My two older children were not encouraged to acquire these skills. I'm really pleased with the educational philosophy at St. Paul's. I'd be happy to answer any questions you have about the school. G.O.\n\nFeb 2009\n\nI wondered if anyone who has had experience at both Park Day and St. Paul's - especially if they've switched from one to the other - could share what their experience has been and what they feel are the strong differences (other than the facilities). My son will be starting kindergarten next year. He's a self-directed, articulate, musical, and social guy and would be at home at both places. We like both schools and see many strengths at both from the outside but wonder if an insider can share what they've experienced as the most significant differences between the two. Thanks so much for sharing your experience and insights. Anon\n\nYour son sounds similar to mine who is currently in kindergarten at St. Paul's. We didn't transfer between the two schools though we looked seriously at Park Day and I have close friends who send their children to PD (and we've talked a lot about the two schools). There are many similarlities--strong academics, school community that fosters respect, etc.--but there are some significant differences too. St. Paul's is far more diverse (in fact, I recently learned that it is the 2d most diverse private school in the U.S.), the school has a strong spiritual/cultural component through its school-wide weekly chapel where the kids belt out songs from all cultures and learn about a range of cultural and religious topics (e.g., Hannakuh, Martin Luther King, Chinese New Year), the kids in kindergarten and 1st grade have weekly swimming at the YMCA, there is a strong music program for each grade that includes choirs and musical instrument training, and there is lots of pairing between the kindergartners and older students in a buddy system: 8th grade chapel buddy, 2d grade reading buddy, and a science buddy (I'm forgetting whether my son's science buddy is a 4th grader or 6th grader). And just to give you an idea about how integral music is, the African Amercian Cultural Celebration is this Thursday night, and all the kids are going to get together to sing and perform. Another big difference for us was that St. Paul's building has been earthquake retrofitted and PD's lower school was not (at least not last year when we were applying), which was a big concern for me. Though both schools are great, I can honestly say that everything at St. Paul's this year has exceeded our (high) expectations and nothing has given us concerns or doubts about our decision. Our son is thriving and we love the school. Good luck with your decision! You probably can't go wrong with either school, but I doubt you'll have any regrets about St. Paul's. Happy St. Paul's Parent\n\nI've had young children at both Park Day and St. Paul's. They are both wonderful choices for progressive values, diversity, a responsive classroom, language arts, and longtime committed staff and leadership.\n\nBut there are differences, to wit:\n\nPark Day: Their campus is peaceful, parklike,and nurturing. If your son is shy, needs space,or has a quirky personality, Park is a better choice. Their teachers will know and love your child. The major down side to Park, for us, was that over time our son was not challenged enough in math and other areas, and we actually hired supplemental tutors to keep enriching his academic experience. Later, he needed to seriously learn how to take a standardized test since he'd never seen one and it was no longer an option. We wondered if it was possible to join a social, activist curriculum with academics, because while our son became an amazing person he was not a great student.\n\nSt. Paul's: Their campus is more urban and busy, play areas are limited. A kid who is independent or passionate will thrive, as did our second son. Like Park Day, a lot of social activism and discussion with dedicated staff. St. Paul's was not religious per se (and we're not either), but their spirituality piece which involves meditation and chapel, were way cool. Our son loved that part. We also saw a marked difference in academics, where there were milestones, expectations, and some structured homework (eg spelling words, word problems) which helped our son become a better student. Also some prep for standardized testing in higher grades. While issues like global warming, the needs of our community, and how to be a contributing and caring person were part of his experience, he also was learning how to succeed as an academic student in a way that would translate beyond St. Paul's doors.\n\nBoth schools are great, and parents of one appreciate the other, but there are differences. And please remember to look beyond kindergarten when making your decision. Good luck!! A Fan of Park Day and St. Paul's\n\nLike you, we had a hard time deciding between Park Day and St. Paul's when our oldest child (now a 5th grader)was entering kindergarten. We chose St. Paul's, because we really liked the diversity and academics. However, we recently switched, moving both of our kids to Park Day, and are quite happy with our decision.\n\nEach school has some wonderful strengths. The music program at St. Paul's -- particularly after 3d grade -- is amazing. As I mentioned, the school really is diverse, economically as well as in more obvious respects such as race and sexual orientation. And the academics seem good, Science is especially impressive. Bizarrely, they didn't start teaching a foreign language (Spanish) until a few years in, though that might be changing.\n\nPark seems stronger in the ''liberal arts'' -- lots of emphasis on writing, creative expression, visual arts, and social studies/history. Our older child was always a strong reader, but it wasn't until he started at Park that he began to love reading (tho that might just be a coincidence), and our 2nd grader has gone from being hesitant about reading on her own to being a really avid reader. Spanish starts in kindergarten. On the down side, the math and science are, frankly, stronger at St. Paul's. (Tho I have heard that it improves greatly in 6th grade, when the kids spend half their time with a teacher who specializes in math and science). And, while, Park is not as thoroughly diverse as St. Paul's (I don't think any school is) it does pretty good -- probably better in terms of LGBT families -- and is really committed to social justice, community and global awareness issues.\n\nThe biggest difference is the warm and nurturing feeling of the environment at Park. Kindness seems to be the school ethos, and you really feel it. But that does not mean indulgence: our kids have been in classes with potentially disruptive kids in both schools. The difference is that at Park, we saw those kids managed in a way that kept them included and cared for, without letting their problems become everyone else's.\n\nOther pluses at Park: the campus is lovely (if small), while St. Pauls feels like a nice urban public school; the new(ish) Park middle school is said to be fantastic; and we like that kids stay in the lower school through 6th grade (which seems too young to throw kids into the middle school whirlwind).\n\nI hope this is helpful to you -- probably either choice will be a good one; they are both fine schools. Good luck.\n\nI have had experience at both schools, although my St. Pauls experience is just with the middle school. Our older son went to Park Day from Kindergarten through sixth grade. We moved him to St. Pauls for 7th and 8th. Like you describe your son, ours is self-directed, articulate, and social. We also have a younger son who is still at Park Day and will probably stay there through middle school.\n\nAlmost without exception both of our sons have had great experiences at Park Day. There was not one day in my older sons seven years at the school when he said he didnt like school or didnt want to go to school. Same so far for my younger son. They have had wonderful teachers who took the time to get to know them and always enjoyed them. The small class size at Park Day gives teachers the time to focus on each kid. Kids do a lot of work in groups and with partners and get to move around a lot, which was important for both of my energetic sons. Park Day seems to get a bad rap for its academics, but the curriculum is strong (and constantly being reviewed and revised) and lively, and kids learn what they need to learn. I think the fact that the kids have fun learning it makes people question whether the school is feeding enough of the core subjects. My older son did fine, transitioned to St. Pauls middle school with no problems, and is now at a highly academic high school. My younger son excels in math, and his teacher ensures that he is challenged in that subject on a daily basis. So, kids do get what they need at Park Day, and the school is able to meet the needs of many different kinds of kids, from those who naturally excel at academics to those who need more support. A comment about the facilities: The beautiful, open Park Day campus contributes in a very important way to the childrens experience. The kids have a lot of space and a lot of freedom, get to be outdoors a ton, get to garden, play sports, etc. They love the space and that adds to their positive school experience. And finally, the school does a really good job at keeping parents informed about whats going on in the classrooms and in the school as a wholea thorough, lengthy, and readable weekly newsletter from the administration and regular newsletters and emails from teachers. Plus, its easy to have a quick chat with teachers because the campus/buildings are so accessible. Parents are always hanging around and chatting before and after school.\n\nSt. Pauls has some wonderful qualitiesthe diversity and the music program are standouts--but we found St. Pauls to be much more traditional than we had expected, both in terms of the curriculum (we didn't find it particularly exciting), and discipline (my son witnessed many detentions being handed out). Overall, while my son handled it all just fine, it wasnt a great match for our family. There were many disruptive kids in his group;not sure if that was a fluke for his year or a more general problem at the school. The classes were large (24 to a class in middle school), and I didnt get the sense that all of his teachers really knew him. Plus, the facilities turned out to be a big drawback. My older son was excited about the very urban setting, but as the months wore on and he had to line up to go anywhere, eat lunch surrounded by goose poop at the lake, etc., he really missed the old freedoms of Park Days space. Finally, I was not satisfied with the amount of communication from the St. Pauls administration to parents. The school sent out a very short, weekly newsletter, but it was more of a schedule of upcoming events, rather than an insight into the classrooms, curriculum, and general goings-on. Middle school teachers sent emails, but those were mostly a list of upcoming assignments. Also, because parents pretty much have to drive through and drop off their kids, there just arent regular opportunities to stick your head in a classroom after school and have a quick chat with a teacher. Please keep in mind that our experience at St. Paul's was only at the middle school level. Good luck with your school choice\n\nWe have two sons now in the 4th and 7th grades, with very different personalities and learning styles, and they are both thriving at St. Paul's. St. Paul's demonstrates its academic excellence with an inter-disciplinary curriculum that fosters discovery and curiosity in its students. Programs like Junior Great Books, which is taught in the 3-5th grades, and 6+1 writing traits, taught across grades, provide a wonderful introduction to world literature, help develop critical thinking skills and provide an outstanding framework for developing young writers. My older son started as a tentative and often-times tortured writer, but with the encouragement of his teachers and this consistent and thorough approach, he has developed into a confident and strong writer. St. Paul's teachers are inspired and seek to find the spark in each child that will ignite his or her love of learning. Over the years. I've been continually surprised and impressed by my sons' teachers who take the time to really get to know them and remain interested in their development long after they have left their classrooms. St. Paul's uses its location and the rich resources of Oakland to the best advantage. As students grow and develop, so does their extended classroom. 3rd grade students travel weekly to Lake Merritt where they conduct the only migratory bird census for the City; the study conducted over the entire school year incorporates language arts, science, art and math. In 6th grade, students return to the Lake for weekly lake cleaning and a study of its ecology, comparing it to that of the Gualala River, where they spend a week in the fall. Students at St. Paul's have a strong awareness of the positive impact they can have on their community and their environment. In short, we think St. Paul's is a great school and hope you will too. Debra\n\nJan 2009\n\nRe: K-8 private / public school around or in Berkeley\n\nLorry, I strongly encourage you to look at St. Paul's Espiscopal School in Oakland. I live in Berkeley and have children attending this K-8 school. The school has excellent academics, tremendous diversity, a fantastic spiritual (non- religious) program and a nationally recognized service learning program. There is a lot of information about the school on this website. My family has been very happy at this school and it takes us less than 10 minutes to get there. Please contact Khadija Fredericks, Director of Admissions, at 510-285-9627.
