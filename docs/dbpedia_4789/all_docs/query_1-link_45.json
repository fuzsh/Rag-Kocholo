        "text": "Official Regulation Volleyball Net Heights for Olympic, Professional, NCAA, Recreation, High School, Middle School, and Youth Teams\n\nOne aspect often overlooked yet playing a pivotal role in every volleyball game is the volleyball net height. Determining the right volleyball net height for your team is important for many reasons. As a coach, knowing accurate volleyball net heights is crucial for following the rules of the game, as well as being prepared for the officials on match day! Regulation heights of indoor volleyball nets and outdoor volleyball nets vary between age groups, genders, abilities, and the number of players on your team. It is also important to have a complete regulation net system to achieve exact net height with every single set-up.\n\nFollow these guidelines to ensure that the volleyball net height you set up is the ideal height for your players — whether you’re coaching a professional, Olympic, NCAA, high school, middle school, youth, indoor, or beach volleyball team.\n\nREGULATION INDOOR AND OUTDOOR VOLLEYBALL NET HEIGHTS\n\nNo matter what type of team you coach, the official regulation volleyball net height is always measured in the center of the net, and the net’s sides can’t be more than ¾ inches higher than the regulation height. While there are differences between the height of men’s and women’s volleyball nets, co-ed volleyball games use men’s net height settings.\n\nINDOOR AND BEACH VOLLEYBALL NET HEIGHTS\n\nMen’s Volleyball Net Heights\n\nWhile the standard regulation volleyball net height for men is 7 feet, 11 ⅝ inches or 2.43 meters (this is the same for standing disabled men’s volleyball teams), men’s teams that fall into older age brackets (55-70+) are allowed to lower their nets below the regulation height.\n\nStandard Men’s Volleyball Net Height: 7 feet, 11 ⅝ inches or 2.43 meters\n\nMen’s Volleyball Net Height Ages 55-69: 7 feet, 9 ⅝ inches or 2.38 meters\n\nMen’s Volleyball Net Height Ages 70+: 7 feet, 6 inches or 2.29 meters\n\nWomen’s Volleyball Net Heights\n\nSimilar to men’s volleyball, the official regulation volleyball net height for women’s volleyball is allowed to be lowered for certain age groups. The net height for women’s disabled standing volleyball follows the same height regulations as a standard women’s volleyball net.\n\nStandard Women’s Volleyball Net Height: 7 feet, 4 ⅛ inches or 2.24 meters\n\nWomen’s Volleyball Net Height Ages 45+: 7 feet, 2 ⅛ inches or 2.19 meters\n\nSitting Volleyball Net Heights\n\nSitting volleyball is played on a smaller court, and the volleyball net sits lower to the ground than the standard volleyball net. The international net height for sitting volleyball teams are 3 feet 9.28 inches or 1.15 meters for men’s teams and 3 feet 5.34 inches or 1.05 meters for women’s teams.\n\nINDOOR VOLLEYBALL NET HEIGHTS FOR YOUNGER PLAYERS\n\nYouth Volleyball Net Heights\n\nIf you coach youth volleyball teams, the official volleyball net height for boys and girls teams is the same unless your girls are younger players under the age of 10.\n\nStandard Boy’s & Girl’s Junior Volleyball Net Height Ages 11 – 12: 7 feet or 2.13 meters\n\nBoy’s Junior Volleyball Net Height Ages 10 and under: 7 feet or 2.13 meters\n\nGirl’s Junior Volleyball Net Height Ages 10 and under: 6 feet, 6 inches or 1.98 meters\n\nMiddle School Volleyball Net Heights\n\nVolleyball net heights for players in middle school vary. Always refer to your state governing body for measurements and the correct regulation height, as each state is different.\n\nTips for Measuring a Regulation Volleyball Net\n\nAs you are measuring your volleyball net height, keep the following things in mind to ensure that you don’t make any mistakes while measuring:\n\nAlways measure your net’s height from the center of the playing court with an appropriate measuring device (net chain).\n\nAs you measure, make sure that the two ends of your volleyball net (over the sidelines) are the same height from the volleyball playing surface.\n\nNever exceed the official volleyball net height by more than ¾ inches.\n\nIf you coach beach volleyball, remember that your beach volleyball net height measurement must be taken at the sand-raked level.\n\nIf you coach outdoor volleyball in the grass, remember to measure your net height from ground-level, not from the top of the grass blades.\n\nChoosing a Regulation Volleyball Net\n\nNow that you know the official volleyball net height for your team, the next step is to choose the right regulation volleyball net!\n\nThe Sports Imports sales team is here to assist and knows all about regulation volleyball net standards.
