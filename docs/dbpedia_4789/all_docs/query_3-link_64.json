        "text": "Daily chapel lessons center students and prepare them for the day ahead, and this morning ritual makes the St. Paul's experience unique. While students sing, pray, and hear bible stories, there is also equal emphasis on life skills presentations, community speakers, and exploration of different faiths around the world. St. Paul's strives to instill a spiritual spark in our students, and this daily tradition allows space for student curiosity and self-reflection.\n\nLearn more about the chapel program.\n\nAccording to recent research, 85% of the jobs that will exist in 2030 haven't been invented yet. At St. Paul's, we offer dynamic curriculum to develop future-proof skills like communication, problem-solving, creativity, and collaboration.\n\nSt. Paul's classrooms and common spaces are newly renovated and feature flexible learning spaces, expanded science lab, a makerspace, galleries to display student work, and much more.

Our Buddy Program sets up authentic leadership roles and compels older students to care for others in their school community. During this critical time of adolescent development, middle school students learn to be empathetic, responsible, and selfless.\n\nUltimately, throughout a student's time at St. Paul's they are part of strong community of former and future teachers who are invested in their individual success.\n\nLearn more about the Buddy Program at St. Paul's."
