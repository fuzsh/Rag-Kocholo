        "text": "What Should You Be Asking An Independent School?\n\nphotos and story by Admiral Farragut Academy Admissions staff\n\nThe typical independent school guide prepares families to tour campuses to gauge school identity and learn about curriculum and academic rigor, school accreditations and extracurriculars. Outside of those important checkboxes, what else are you asking, or better yet–not asking?\n\nMany important topics often get missed. These include: How does an environment that provides academic excellence actually prepare a student for the next phase of their development? How does the school community immerse the students and their families in a mindful and global community? More importantly, how are families making this opportunity a reality for their students?\n\nAt Admiral Farragut Academy, we educate our prospective families and their students about the experiential learning opportunities that take place here to develop a 100% college accepted graduating class, cultivating a global and mindful community, and strategies to meet the investment of a private school education.\n\nAcademic rigor is a topic that comes to most parents’ minds when searching for private schools. But what about substituting that with academic excellence? Students who are looking for academic support or challenge also need the proper support that will channel the rigor towards the appropriate “college fit”. Farragut consistently produces graduating classes with 100% college acceptances. This comes from the support of the Academic Leadership Team and College Advising Team that prepares students for the requirements to apply to colleges and universities. With a range of College Prep Academics to the AP Capstone Diploma, Farragut has a breadth of academic options to meet the strategies for Ivy bound students to those destined for international institutions and everything in between.\n\nCultivating a global and mindful community is what sets AFA apart in the greater Tampa Bay area, with students from 25 countries, 15 American states and two international campuses. Farragut offers Upper School students the option to board five or seven days a week. This boarding element at Farragut provides future young adults the tools to thrive in a space to become independent global leaders. Local students can choose to be day students and participate in after school activities, but don’t be surprised if your day student asks you about becoming a boarding student after hearing about the weekend activities and excursions boarders enjoy!\n\nLearning about the enrichment of a private school experience may make parents wonder: How do I make this a reality? Admiral Farragut Academy has outstanding and competitive merit-based scholarship opportunities aimed at students of exceptional academic performance who demonstrate strong character and good citizenship and are reflective of the mission of AFA.\n\nBURNING QUESTIONS TO ADD TO YOUR NEXT CAMPUS TOUR:\n\nHow does an environment that provides academic excellence actually prepare a student for the next phase of their development?\n\nWhat experience is the community providing to immerse the students and their families in a mindful and global community?\n\nHow are families making this opportunity a reality for their students?\n\nBELL CREEK ACADEMY 13221 Boyette Road, Riverview 33569 813-793-6075; bellcreekacademy.com\n\nA tuition-free public charter school proudly serving grades 6-12, Bell Creek provides a well-rounded college preparatory education.
