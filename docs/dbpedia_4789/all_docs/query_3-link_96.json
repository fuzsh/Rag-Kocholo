        "text": "The environment at Doane Stuart is one of inquiry and academic scholarship. The community is based upon mutual respect and honest communication; it is a place to grow your mind and build your heart.\n\nDoane Stuart was founded in 1975 when two historic Albany schools mergedâ€”one Episcopal and one Sacred Heart school. The union of these two schools (St. Agnes School, founded in 1870 and Kenwood Academy, founded in 1852). The resulting school, Doane Stuart makes a statement to the broader community about the importance of teaching students to live together peacefully, respecting the religious traditions of others."
