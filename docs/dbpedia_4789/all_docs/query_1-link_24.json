        "text": "The Global Scholars program in Upper Division stands out as a distinctive educational opportunity, offering a rigorous international curriculum that delves into people, places, and ideas that are not typically explored in high school. This program is designed to cultivate studentsâ€™ potential to become responsible and effective global citizens.\n\nThrough this intellectually stimulating program, students will examine significant global issues from multiple perspectives, improving their cross-cultural awareness, exploring global dynamics, and understanding the implications of human choices.\n\nUpon graduation from the Global Scholars program, students will possess a wealth of knowledge on global issues, a deep understanding of diverse cultures, and proficiency in at least one world language. These skills will undoubtedly help them make a positive impact on the global issues facing our world in the 21st century.\n\nThe Global Scholars program is a three-year elective course of study revolving around four key components:\n\nCurricular: Students must take an additional year of their world language, as well as a course on global citizenship, a contemporary issues course with a regional focus, and two electives with a global focus. They must also complete a capstone project, which consists of a research-based thesis paper, a global action project, and a public exhibition of the work.\n\nExtracurricular: Students must seek global learning experiences outside the traditional classroom setting. They will expand their worldview through participation in globally focused clubs, lectures, and community events.\n\nService Learning: Students complete an additional 24 hours of service with an international focus.\n\nCross-Cultural Exchange: Students participate in at least one immersive international travel experience."
