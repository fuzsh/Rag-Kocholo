        "text": "AN EDUCATION FOR LIFE\n\nThe Episcopal School in the City of New York was founded in 1961 by representatives of six nearby Episcopal parishes. The goal was to offer a developmentally appropriate early childhood program for children in the neighborhood. The School was established as an autonomous, non-denominational institution with an independent, self-perpetuating Board of Trustees. Its purpose then, as now, was to give young children the best possible preparation for their ongoing education and for life."
