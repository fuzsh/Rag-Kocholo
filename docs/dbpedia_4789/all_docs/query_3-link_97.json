Kevin Schubert, Rector\n\nAmanda Ebner, Head of School\n\nBrinton Nute, Assistant Head of School\n\nACCREDITATION:\n\nMembership\n\nSt. Stephen's Episcopal School maintains membership in the Southwestern Association of Episcopal Schools (SAES). The Episcopal Schools Commission of the Diocese of West Texas (DWTX) also provides structure and standards for an outstanding school experience. These state, regional, and national organizations support schools with training, standards, and policies. They also provide St. Stephen's with a sense of purpose greater than our local influence, and allow us to assist in the creation, maintenance, and expansion of a dynamic network of Episcopal schools with a deep sense of shared mission and identity.\n\nAccreditation\n\nSt. Stephen's Episcopal School, from its PreK3 program through Eighth Grade, is accredited by the Southwestern Association of Episcopal Schools (SAES). This accreditation is fully recognized by the Texas Education Agency (TEA) through the membership of SAES in the Texas Private School Accreditation Commission. SAES is a regional organization of Episcopal schools in Texas, Arkansas, Arizona, Louisiana and Oklahoma. The SAES accreditation process is comprehensive and rigorous, including on-site visiting teams of fellow educators, and required interim written reports over a ten-year period to create a continuous accreditation process.\n\nSt. Stephen’s is strengthened by accreditation process’ emphasis on best practices and effective school governance. SAES is the only faith-based accreditation organization in the United States recognized by the National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS).\n\nGRADE LEVELS: 2 year olds - 8th grade\n\nTUITION '22-23):\n\nToddler/PK2 Two Days $450 monthly\n\nThree Days $550 monthly\n\nFive Days $800 monthly\n\nPreK 3/4 Part-time (3 days) $5000\n\nFull-time (5 Days) $7,500\n\nKindergarten $8,000\n\nGrades 1 – 6 $8,500\n\nGrades 7 & 8 $9000"
