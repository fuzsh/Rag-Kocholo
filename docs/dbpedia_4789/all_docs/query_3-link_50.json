        "text": "Trinity Episcopal School of Austin is an independent, nonprofit, PK-8, co-ed, day school in southwest Austin, Texas. Trinity delivers a student-centered, evidence-based curriculum in a highly supportive and challenging environment. Teachers, coaches, and a team of support staff work together to meet students where they are and partner with parents to build a comprehensive, holistic, and data-driven plan for each child's growth.\n\nIndependent\n\nWe are not funded by any governement or diocese, which allows us to control our curriculum independently. We adhere to the accreditation requirements for the Independent Schools Association of the Southwest and the Southwestern Association of Episcopal Schools.\n\nNonprofit\n\nWe invest every dollar back into our programs, people, and spaces. In fact, tuition alone does not cover the cost of exceptional Trinity education. We depend on philanthropy to close the tuition gap and to support families that rely on financial assistance.\n\nGrades PK–8\n\nWe believe the PK–8 model offers the best balance for young children and adolescents. It gives lower schoolers a nurturing learning environment and challenges middle schoolers to grow as leaders and role models.\n\nForward-Thinking\n\nWe think of ourselves as ahead of the curve, but not experimental. Our curricula are based on the latest research and proven best practices to optimize learning and development for young children and adolescents.\n\nEpiscopal\n\nAs an Episcopal school, we are a Christian organization that welcomes and seeks to understand people of all faiths and backgrounds. Examples include daily Chapel, recognizing both Christian and non-Christian holidays, and service learning."
