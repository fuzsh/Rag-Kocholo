        "text": "As an independent school in the Episcopal tradition, Saint Andrew’s was founded in 1961 and affiliated with the Episcopal church expressly to “fit and prepare students morally, spiritually, mentally, and physically for higher education in high schools, colleges, and universities….” In pursuit of this mission, Saint Andrew’s School has evolved into a community of learners where academic excellence is achieved in a warm and caring environment, where we value honor above all, and where the spiritual dimension of life is expressed in a rich variety of ways that continuously challenge all members to seek and find the best of the human spirit in themselves and others.\n\nThe word ‘Episcopal’ calls to mind a denomination of the Christian community. However, Episcopal schools are beyond a single denomination. Schools in the Episcopal tradition embrace religious pluralism and encourage dialogue with other faith traditions. As an independent school in the Episcopal tradition, Saint Andrew’s is not a parish or parochial school, yet is an embodiment of the kind of education traditionally and historically fostered by the Episcopal Church based on three pillars: excellent academics, including character education; personal and spiritual development; and involvement in the world.\n\nChapel is a community gathering organized by division, Lower, Middle, and Upper. Chapels are held once a week and attendance is required of all students and faculty. Chaplains plan the Chapel programs with inclusivity, creativity, and age-appropriateness in mind to add to the richness of the students’ educational experience at Saint Andrew’s. Worship is central to Chapel and is celebrated with sensitivity and appreciation of the religious diversity present on campus. Chapel begins with a procession and continues with hymns, prayer, and Biblical readings. The use of prayer - both Christian and non-Christian - language, The Book of Common Prayer, and special holiday services in other faith traditions are important expressions of Saint Andrew’s Episcopal identity experienced through our Chapel programs. Chapel is the one place where the entire community can join together in times of joy, pain, sorrow, and celebrations and share the poignancy of the human experience. It is no surprise that over the years Chapel is remembered fondly by many alumni as a highlight of their Saint Andrew’s experience. If you would like to discuss any of these topics further, or if you have a question that is not addressed here, please feel free to contact the Admission Office at 561.210.2020.\n\nEpiscopal schools are known for educational excellence. As embodiments of the Christian faith, they serve God in Christ in all persons, regardless of origin, background, ability, or religion and “strive for justice and peace among all people and [to] respect the dignity of every human being.” This intentional pluralism is also a distinguishing hallmark of Episcopal schools. Based on the daily pursuit of our mission, Saint Andrew’s provides an excellent academic and educational experience centered on the development of the whole child in mind, body, and spirit. In the tradition of Episcopal schools, Saint Andrew’s exists not merely to educate, but also to honor and celebrate the unique worth of all human beings as creations of a loving God. We express this ideal through worship that is creative and inclusive; community life that is warm, nurturing and inviting; involvement in the world that cultivates the ideal of a just society; religious formation and study of moral and ethical decision-making that are meaningful, age-appropriate, and - in the Judeo-Christian tradition - foster dialogue with other faith traditions. Saint Andrew’s School’s mission and vision are built on spiritual principles that guide and challenge all who attend to build lives of genuine meaning, purpose, and service in the world they will inherit.\n\nNo. Saint Andrew’s, as well as many Episcopal schools, has students and faculty from a broad variety of religious, cultural and economic backgrounds. In fact, the intentional pluralism of most Episcopal schools is a hallmark of their mission. This pluralism is true of Saint Andrew’s as well. Nationally, 74% of students attending Episcopal schools are other than Episcopalian. Many are non-Christian. It is also a distinguishing characteristic of Saint Andrew’s that we seek to integrate religious and spiritual formation into the overall curriculum and life of the school community. Saint Andrew’s is clear, yet graceful, about how we articulate and express our basic identity, especially in religious curricula and traditions. Saint Andrew’s invites all who attend and work here - Episcopalians and non-Episcopalians, Christians and non-Christians, people of no faith tradition - both to explore their own beliefs and religions and to honor those traditions more fully and faithfully in their own lives."
