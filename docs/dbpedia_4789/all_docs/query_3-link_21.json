        "text": "To put it simply: we are a school rooted in the Episcopal tradition. The Episcopal Church is a part of the global Anglican Communion. Our roots go back all the way to the earliest Christians. During the 16th century, the Protestant Reformation came to England and the Anglican Church was formed. One of the first things these reformers did was to put an emphasis on education, reason, and training up leaders for the next generation. Our Anglican heritage has always placed a high emphasis on the value of education, critical thinking, character building, and spiritual formation.\n\nEpiscopal schools find their home in this rich Christian tradition. However, Episcopal schools are also open to students of all faiths or no faith at all. Our goal is that all students, regardless of religion, race, gender, or socioeconomic background are welcome at our school.\n\nOne of the primary focuses in Episcopal schools is on the spiritual life of the students, teachers, and families in the school. We desire to be a place where we worship together, where we read the Scriptures together, pray together, receive Holy Communion together, and serve together. There are seven things that mark Episcopal schools as unique:"
