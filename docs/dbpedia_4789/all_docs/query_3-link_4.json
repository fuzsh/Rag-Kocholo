        "text": "This chapter discusses that the emphasis and scope of Episcopal Church schooling has changed radically with the proliferation of parish day schools, beginning in the 1940's. The Episcopal Church emerged as an entity separate from the mother Church of England at the conclusion of the Revolutionary War, as a logical and necessary consequence of the emergence of the United States as an independent nation. Any history of Episcopal schools, therefore, begins with the development of Church of England schools in the American colonies. The impact of the Revolution on the colonial Church of England was immense. Biennial meetings continued with a few interruptions until 1941 and the advent of World War II. The recent developments clearly mean that the face of Episcopal education has changed radically in a remarkably short period of time. This historical review emphasizes these recent developments after reviewing earlier periods."
