        "text": "St. James Episcopal School is a faith based PK3-5th grade school that enjoys a excellent reputation throughout the community in academics, service, and extracurricular activities. St. James Episcopal School was founded in the fall of 1955 by a group of church women led by Bette Foster and Joanne Crosby, who felt there should be a Christian school available in the community. The school became an outreach program of St. James Episcopal Church.\n\n​\n\nSt. James was accredited for the first time in 1990 by the Southwestern Association of Episcopal Schools (SAES), an accrediting agency recognized by the National Association of Independent Schools and in Texas approved by TEPSAC and recognized by the Commissioner of Education. It became the place in Del Rio where students are enlightened through chapel services and where students are challenged academically.\n\n​\n\nRetired General Gerald Prather, a former school board member, said it best when he said, \"Educating children in a Christian environment is an important way to serve God and our Nation.\" St. James prides itself on our academic excellence and reflects the values of a committed and caring community. This is truly a place where students learn to love and love to learn.\n\nEnrollment for the 2024-2025 school year is still open for new families! ​If you have a student or students you would like to enroll in our program, APPLY TODAY to begin the online application process.
