        "text": "In Hillsborough County and across the nation, the vast majority of families continue to choose traditional public schools.

Some are a combination of all of the above.\n\nIn the coming weeks and months, many private schools in Hillsborough County will hold open houses to welcome potential students for the 2019-20 academic year, just as public schools will be doing.
