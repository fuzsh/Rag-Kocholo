        "text": "We are a Christian school in our commitment to living out the teachings of Jesus Christ as interpreted through the Episcopal tradition with its emphasis on scripture, tradition and reason. We are an Episcopal school in our commitment to regular worship, religious education, service learning and an inclusive community. Different than most non-denominational Christian schools, we strive to help confirm faith but not one that requires a conversion to Christian doctrine. We affirm, support, and give thanks for the religious and spiritual diversity present in our community, and encourage an individual and corporate relationship with God. We are an independent day school, accredited by the Independent Schools Association of the Southwest and the Southwest Association of Episcopal Schools. We are also members of the National Association of Independent Schools and the National Association of Episcopal Schools.\n\nFor a visual outline of the similarities and differences, explore this Comparative Tool.\n\nThe sacrament of Holy Eucharist -- sometimes known as communion, mass, or the divine liturgy -- is a service of thanksgiving. It celebrates Jesus' final meal with his friends and his words, \"do this in remembrance of me.\" In the Episcopal tradition, Holy Eucharist is a sacrament. The consecrated bread and wine are outward and visible signs of God's grace and love. When we gather weekly, we enter into the story of Christ's life, death and resurrection and how we are to live until he comes again. This is a powerful acknowledgement and reflection of our commitment to community, placing God at the center.\n\nStudents in Grades K-12 attend a weekly Eucharist service."
