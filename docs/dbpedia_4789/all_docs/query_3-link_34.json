As a Christian school where God is celebrated at the center of Life, we welcome all as Godâ€™s children who are called to model the life of Jesus, the source of grace and truth. We want all students to discover their potential, develop their unique, God-given gifts, and be shaped into men and women of character, so that they may know the Truth, love the Good, and serve God and neighbor.\n\nWe believe in Balanced Excellence in all areas of the student experience, offering diverse opportunities for all students to explore a balance of experiences in academics, athletics, arts, and acts of service."
