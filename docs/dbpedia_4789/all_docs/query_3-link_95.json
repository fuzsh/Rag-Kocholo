        "text": "Our singular, focused mission permeates every aspect of St. David's School.\n\nIt defines who we are as a community of learning, and delineates our character and caliber of offerings. It distinguishes St. David's from other competitive college preparatory schools. It informs every decision St. David's leaders make in directing the daily life of the school, and in charting a deliberate course for its future.\n\nWe know that God sets each of our students on a pilgrimage along \"a more excellent way\" (Romans 12:31) , complete with peaks, valleys, contours and obstacles, all unique to each individual student. Our Portrait of a St. David's Graduate charts a journey for each student knowing that at the end of their time at St. David's they will be on their way to becoming uncommon people who seek Christ, pursue excellence, lead with humility, persevere through challenges, embrace learning and collaborate generously.\n\nIn the classroom, in the arts, on the fields and courts of play, among our faculty and facilities, within the local and global community--on every front, St. David's School strives to achieve the greatest of expectations."
