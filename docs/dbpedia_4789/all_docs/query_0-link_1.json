Financial aid awards are based upon FACTS Grant and Aid Assessment (FACTS) financial assessment of each applicant. It is important to note that Berkeley may not be able to accommodate all financial aid applicants in a given year. Complete applications and required documents received in the Admissions Office by the deadline will receive first priority relative to aid dollars available.\n\nDeadline for Current Berkeley Students for the 2025-2026 School Year: December 31, 2024*\n\nAward notification in late January\n\nDeadline for New Families Applying to Berkeley for the 2025-2026 School Year: February 1, 2025*\n\nAward notification in early March\n\n*Financial aid applications received after the deadlines will be considered for our financial aid waiting pool.\n\nAll families applying for financial aid for the first time should contact Julia Loncar, Associate Director of Admissions and Financial Aid, by calling (813) 885-1673 or emailing loncajul@berkeleyprep.org. Families currently receiving aid must submit a new financial aid application each year. If the financial circumstances remain the same, the school will make every effort to assist a family at the same level of aid.\n\nTo apply for financial aid for the 2025-2026 school year, please complete the following steps no later than December 31, 2024* for returning Berkeley families, or February 1, 2025* for new applicants:\n\nCreate your FACTS online account.\n\nComplete your Financial Aid application.\n\nSubmit your additional required documents listed below:\n\nUpload your 2022 and 2023 1040 income tax return(s) with signatures\n\nBusiness/Farm Statement and Corporate Tax Return/Schedule C/Schedule F (if applicable)\n\nUpload your 2022 and 2023 W-2 Forms (if applicable)\n\nUpload a copy of your most recent pay stub(s)\n\nBy April 15, 2025, upload a copy of your 2024 federal tax forms with all supporting schedules and W-2 Forms (if applicable)\n\n*Financial aid applications received after the deadlines will be considered for our financial aid waiting pool.\n\nDue to the difficulty in evaluating need using non-US dollars and tax structure, a family must provide 2023 and 2024 U.S. tax returns in order to apply for financial aid."
