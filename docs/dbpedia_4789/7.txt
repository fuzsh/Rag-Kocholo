Founded in 1960, Berkeley Preparatory School is a Pre-K through grade 12 co-educational independent, Episcopal day school located in Tampa, Florida. Berkeley educates the whole child by nurturing studentsâ€™ intellectual, emotional, spiritual, and physical development so they may attain their highest potential. Our philosophy encompasses a balanced curriculum of academics and arts, clubs and activities, competitive sports and community service. An emphasis on academic excellence combined with a spirit of social responsibility sparks in students a newfound confidence and shared sense of purpose. Students exchange ideas, study virtues, and explore ethics as they define their attitudes and values.
