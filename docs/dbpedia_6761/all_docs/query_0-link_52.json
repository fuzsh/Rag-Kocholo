        "text": "The birth of a male heir to Jogaila in autumn 1424 saved the new dynasty from the unfortunate fate of the Angevin line in Poland. To celebrate this blessing, a curse for Poland’s enemies to the west, the king invited the pope (as per tradition, judging from the case of his first daughter, Bonifacja) and emperor to stand as godfather to the baby prince and compater to himself along with other important diplomatic partners such as the grand master of Prussia, the doge of Venice, the duke of Milan and leading cardinals of the Roman Church active in eastern and central European diplomacy. These men were represented at the ceremony by proxies selected from among the archbishops and bishops of Poland-Lithuania. Leading Malopolskan monastic lords (the three ‘crowning abbots’) and Cracovian clerics also took part in the ceremonies.\n\nRelations of King Matthias Corvinus and the papacy have been studied by many historians since the nineteenth century. Uncovering and publishing sources that would elucidate this part of papal and central-European history was of prime interest. This paper tries to bring some new light to these relations thanks to a newly discovered instructions of the king to his envoy, Miklós Nyújtódi Székely, bishop of Knin, who travelled to Rome sometime in the beginning of 1472. On the basis of these instructions we can reconstruct the king's intentions and plans in the context of the political situation of central Europe in the early 1470s. At that time, relations to Bohemia and Poland set the framework of the policies, which were influenced from the papal side by the present papal nuncios, especially Lorenzo Roverella.\n\nThe last years of the reign of John Casimir, including the rokosz of Jerzy Lubomirski, the abdication of Vasa and the interregnum of 1668–1669, still arouses great interest among Polish and foreign historians. The internal situation of the Polish-Lithuanian state interested foreign courts, also this one in London. English envoys staying in Gdańsk, Francis Sanderson and Robert Yard meticulously informed about current events in the Commonwealth. Sanderson and Yard correspondence is an interesting source of information about internal events in Poland in the last years of the reign of John Casimir. It should be stated that most of the messages contained in accounts were accurate, sometimes minor mistakes may be encountered. Some of Sanderson’s comments and opinions, although appearing relatively rarely, confirm that English diplomats are well-versed in the intricacies of Polish politics, and on the other hand, prove that he has reliable sources of information and competent collaborators. In some reports, we can find detailed descriptions of some events and political moods in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, which certainly proves their usefulness in historical research.\n\nMediaeval scholars attempted to fit received data and information from empirical observation into a pre-ordained model of the universe. Astrology was, and in many cases still is, a form of applied astronomy held by its adherents to be verifiable by events, that is, history. Drawing connections between celestial coincidences and events known to have happened under such circumstances in the past seemed to offer a possibility for predicting types of occurrence which might take place given a similar stellar conjunction in the future. In their turn some historians, especially those with university connections, subsequently seem to have used astrological records annotated with details of actual events as a source of information for their own work and were able to present, where relevant (in their view), a star-told causation of events. The importance of astrology at royal courts in England, France and Italy has been a subject of special study for a considerable time but the largest centre for astrological study in the fifteenth-century was the University of Cracow. The use of astrology at Jagiellonian courts in the fifteenth century is examined here with reference to the use of such data by court historians such as Jan Długosz and Bernard Wapowski.\n\nThis paper analyses the attitudes toward the Armenian Diaspora in early modern Polish society through a close examination of the issues viewed as burning by the contemporaries. The paper is focused on three such burning topics – a) the 'price revolution' and, in connection therewith, mercantilism; b) the growing level of consumption (\" redundant luxury \" – zbytek nierozmyślny) and the fears of social disorder aroused by it; and c) the Ottoman threat (real and imagined). The paper argues that there were a variety of discourses on the Armenians because the discourses were infl uenced by the different answers to the challenging issues presented by the representatives of various social estates – noblemen (szlachta), clergymen (duchowieństwo) and burghers (mieszczaństwo). Therefore, the attitudes to the Mono-physite Armenians in Polish society were mostly shaped not as part of the Counter Reformation agenda (as was the case with respect to Protestants and the Greek-Orthodox), but rather within the framework of economic (mercantilism), social (consumption), and psychological/political (fears of the Ottoman threat) issues.\n\nThe coronation parliament in the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was always an exceptional event not only for the newly elected monarch but also for diplomats from foreign courts who reported about its proceedings. In their reports, they tried to provide as much information as possible, not only political but also moral, social, and related to the ceremony. Of course, such material needs careful analysis, as the diplomats, often unfamiliar with the reality of the Polish-Lithuanian state, misrepresented the facts or presented them in a wrong context. The analysed manuscript accounts from the coronation parliament of John III Sobieski probably played the role of an additional source of information in London. In addition to the offi cial reports of diplomats, they broadened the recipients’ knowledge about the described event, generally informing the reader about events during the parliamentary sessions, but not only that. The information about events in Russia and Turkey as well as about matters of minor importance was also included in these documents. Despite doubts about objectivity of some of the analysed papers, they should be considered an important source of information about the coronation parliament in 1676. They supplemented the official documents, and their congruence with diplomatic reports may have allowed for deepening of the reader’s knowledge about the described events."
