        "text": "Detailed History of the Permanent Chair of Polish Culture\n\nThe History was written to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the existence of the Permanent Chair of Polish Culture at Canisius University, 1959-2009. (Initial efforts can actually be traced to the year 1956 -- as noted in the History.) I attempted to bring together in one clear, cogent and easily-accessible document all of the information which I had at my disposal from various (often scattered) sources. These sources included the following materials: notes given to me many years ago by Bess Luchowski (now deceased) documenting the very early community and College efforts to establish the Polish Chair; my careful analysis of the information and resources in the Canisius University archives; notes from individuals active on the Polish Chair in the past; my own notes recorded during my years of service as the secretary of the Polish Chair. I was first appointed to serve on the Board of the Polish Chair in the early 1970's by Judge Ann Mikoll. Since then I have been reappointed as a Board member on several occasions and have served as secretary when elected to do so. The Polish Chair continues to serve as my personal link to Canisius University, where I earned my MS Ed degree in 1959. The composition and writing of the History represented my voluntary effort to preserve the work of numerous individuals who, as Board members during the past fifty years, attempted to highlight the Polish \"spirit\" and tradition as manifested in fields as diverse as art, music, religion, history, theatre, education.\n\nNo doubt, the effort will continue.\n\nRespecfully,\n\nEdward R. Szemraj\n\nA History Of The Permanent Chair Of Polish Culture At Canisius University\n\nby Edward R. Szemraj, BA, MS, MLS\n\nThe seeds for the establishment of a Permanent Chair of Polish Culture at Canisius University were sown as early as 1956. In a letter dated November 19, 1956 to Dr. Eugenia Fronczak-Bukowska and her husband Dr. Edward, the Very Rev. Philip E. Dobson, S.J., President of Canisius University, noted the establishment of the Lublin Lectureship of Polish Culture and Literature at Canisius. This lectureship was made possible through the initiative and by the generosity of local businessman John F. Kopczynski. Novelist, critic, and Warsaw Medal awardee Bohdan Pawlowicz was appointed Lublin Lecturer in Polish History for the 1956-1957 academic year.\n\nOn March 27, 1957 a Symposium in honor of the first centenary of the birth of the novelist Joseph Conrad (Jozef Konrad Korzeniowski) featured Canisius University faculty members Dr. Charles Brady, Bohdan Pawlowicz, Dr. Lawrence A. Michel, and Dr. Charles A. McCann. The Symposium was followed by a radio program – “Salute to Joseph Conrad” – over Station WKBW on March 30, 1957.\n\nA campaign was begun to reach out to the Polish-American community of Western New York, as well as to the community-at-large and beyond the immediate area, to solicit funds for the establishment of an endowed Permanent Chair at Canisius. One of the highlights of that effort occurred on May 31,1959. Fr. Dobson declared the date “Polish Chair Day.” Jesuit Fathers from Canisius preached eloquently on behalf of the cause in at least 18 parishes with a large Polish membership. A week earlier, on May 14, 1959, WBEN televised a Mass from St. John Kanty Church to bring the cause to the attention of the entire community. A committee of Polish diocesan clergy, Jesuit Fathers, prominent professionals, businessmen, political figures, laymen and women increased its efforts to achieve the goal. A substantial amount of funds was raised between July 1, 1956 and June 30, 1962. Maximum returns were realized during the period of July 1, 1958 and June 30, 1959, the height of the fund-raising campaign.\n\nThe early executive committees of the Polish Chair envisioned an ambitious program: an annual symposium at Canisius that would highlight the rich heritage of Poland’s culture (her history, arts, literature, philosophy); a quarterly and scholarly publication in English that would underscore the Polish contribution to the formation of the American ethic; a Polish Room at Canisius University that would serve as a conservatory of objects of Polish culture; a distinguished and authoritative scholar who would plan and direct all activities.\n\nThe efforts of those early committees began on a very auspicious note. The First National Symposium was held at Canisius University on November 28, 1959. It was formally opened by the Very Reverend James J. McGinley, Canisius President. Its theme – “Poland as a Nation in History” – focused on the nation’s birth and development; its role and tragedy in two world wars; its contemporary status; its future promise. Four outstanding scholars participated in the analysis: Dr. Bohdan Pawlowicz of Canisius; Dr. Oscar Halecki, Professor of History at Columbia & Fordham; Dr. Roman Debicki and Dr. Jan Karski, both Professors of Government at Georgetown. (Dr. Jan Karski is probably best remembered today as the courier who tried to convince American and British authorities of Nazi atrocities and the horrors of the holocaust in the 1940’s). This First National Symposium elicited both local and national recognition. Vice President Richard M. Nixon sent a telegram extending his best wishes. Buffalo Mayor Frank A. Sedita presented a key to the City to each speaker.\n\nSubsequent executive committees attempted to focus on the lofty goals of their predecessors. Unfortunately, the endowment fund did not grow sufficiently enough over the years to realize the grand vision and dreams of its advocates. As a result, the establishment of a Permanent Chair, in the strictest definition of the term, was not to be realized. However, The Permanent Chair of Polish Culture at Canisius University continued to survive – and survives to this day – albeit in a less auspicious context. It defined its role as a proponent of the ideas and ideals of the originators. Over the years, the Polish Chair sponsored, supported, encouraged numerous lectures, recitals, concerts promoting Polish culture both on and off campus. The following events are indicative of this continuous effort over the years. They are among many cited here as the historical record of the Polish Chair’s aim to bring a knowledge of the Polish culture and experience to as wide an audience as possible.\n\nDr. Zbigniew Brzezinski, former United States Security Advisor to President Jimmy Carter and Professor at Harvard and Columbia, was invited to lecture on two occasions. On February 18, 1960, he addressed the topic “Some Current Problems in the Russian Satellite Countries.” On April 20, 1969, he discussed “The Lessons of Czechoslovakia.”\n\nFollowing the PAHA convention, a special concert of The Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra commemorating the sesqui-centennial of the birth of Frederic Chopin and the centennial of the birth of Ignace Jan Paderewski and featuring piano soloist Ruth Slenczynski was sponsored by the Polish Chair on December 29, 1960.\n\nPolish-American Jesuit Father Walter Ciszek, who spent 23 years as a Soviet prisoner while performing covert missionary work from 1941 to 1963, delivered two lectures in the Student Center on campus on September 23, 1964 under the auspices of the Polish Chair. His chilling descriptions of life in exile attracted an audience exceeding 500 people. He recorded his memoirs in the book With God in Russia. Fr. Ciszek’s cause for possible beatification or canonization was begun in 1990.\n\nDr. Peter de Beauvoir Brock, Professor of History at the University of Toronto, focused on the topic “The Polish Identity” in a lecture on October 26,1967.\n\n“Poland’s Romantic Bards” --- Mickiewicz, Slowacki, Krasinski --- was the featured lecture by Edmund I. Zawacki, Associate Professor of Slavic Languages at the University of Wisconsin, on April 1, 1968.\n\nYale University Professor of History Piotr S. Wandycz analyzed “ Poland in International Relations” on October 20, 1968.\n\nKarol Cardinal Wojtyla, the future Pope John Paul II, visited Canisius University on September 17, 1969. The cardinal was greeted during a coffee hour in the office of President Fr. Demske by many of the college’s faculty and administrators. The Polish Chair was represented by Fr. Joseph J. Stelmach, its Chairman that year.\n\nThe musical pageant “I Cannot Come to You Today” (“Dzis do Ciebie Przyjsc Nie Moge”), based on guerilla songs of the German occupation of Poland, 1939-1945, presented by the Classical Theatre of Warsaw, played to large audiences on November 11-12, 1969, the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Polish Chair. The Very Rev. James M. Demske, S.J., President, made a valiant effort to address the audience in Polish.\n\nA company of Poland’s leading opera and stage stars presented a two-part program of Polish music and dance in the Canisius University Student Center on April 28-29, 1970. The company performed the famed operetta “The Queen of Cardas” and the Polish musical “The Stand with Songs.”\n\nA staff contributor to the Catholic liberal weekly “Tygodnik Powszechny,” a participator in the resistance movement during World War II, a prisoner of the Russians in Poland and the Germans in Norway, a Ford Foundation Fellow, a teacher at SUNY Albany and Columbia, an author – Leopold Tyrmand delivered a lecture “On Communist Civilizations: Reflections of a Polish Intellectual” on May 5, 1971.\n\nSeveral months later, on November 11, 1971, Professor Zygmunt Nagorski, Jr. addressed “The Changing Scene in Eastern Europe.”\n\nDeparting temporarily from lecture-centered presentations and turning to the visual arts as the prime program in 1972, a Polish Film Festival was featured as the Polish Chair-sponsored attraction on October 5-6 of that year.\n\nThe year 1973 marked the 500th anniversary of the birth of the famed Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus (Mikolaj Kopernik, 1473-1543). The Permanent Chair of Polish Culture observed that event in grand style – in a manner unique to the campus of a Catholic college and exemplifying the faith-oriented nation and peoples from whom this world-renowned thinker sprung. The Most Rev. Edward D. Head, Bishop of Buffalo, was invited to celebrate a special Mass which would capture the medieval atmosphere of Copernicus’ time. Concelebrating with Bishop Head were the Very Rev. James M. Demske, S.J., President of Canisius University, and three priest members of the Polish Chair: The Rev. Cornelius Dende, OFM, Conv., Director of the Father Justin Rosary Hour; the Rev. John R. Gabalski; and Rt. Rev. Msgr. Joseph J. Stelmach. The homilist was the Very Rev. Walter J. Ziemba, Rector of SS. Cyril and Methodius Seminary in Orchard Lake, Michigan.\n\nThe medieval spirit was achieved in the song and music that enhanced the liturgical service: selections from Desplanes, Elgar, Raff, Massenet, Palestrina (b. 1526), Duffay (d. 1474), Bach, Decius (d. 1526), Beethoven, Talis (b. circa 1505), Purcell. The Rev. Nicholas J. Connolly, S.J. of Campus Ministry coordinated the liturgical service. Participating in the liturgy were the following individuals and groups: Rev. Cyril O. Schommer, S.J., violin, and Miss Mary Louise Klice, organ; the Canisius University Glee Club (Mr. Robert Schulz, Director); The Handbell Choir from St. Joseph’s Church in North Tonawanda (Miss Patricia Bird, Director); The Canisius University ROTC Honor Guard; liturgical readers Edward R. Szemraj, Chairman of the Copernican Committee, and Edward H. Posluszny, Chairman of the Polish Chair .A dinner and program after Mass in the Student Center featured Dr. Eugene Kusielewicz, Associate Professor of History at St. John”s University and President of The Kosciuszko Foundation, who discussed the significance of Copernicus for our time. A one-day post office featuring a commemorative cancellation was opened in the Churchill Academic Tower on campus. All of these events took place on November 4, 1973.\n\nFurther, as part of the observance, the Polish Chair featured a special exhibit of Copernicana in the Canisius University (Bouwhuis) Library. The exhibit opened on October 15 and lasted until November 24, 1973. The display included an impressive bust of Copernicus done in metal by the Polish sculptor Marian Owczarski, artist-in-residence at the Orchard Lake Schools in Orchard Lake, Michigan. Also included in the exhibit were works by Buffalo artist Henryk Jarosz and a pencil sketch of Kopernik by Miss Faith Ann Sikorski of Cheektowaga.\n\nThe years 1975, 1976, 1977 witnessed three annual community “Swieconkas” sponsored by the Polish Chair. This traditional Polish Easter meal in the Student Center followed a Mass in Christ the King Chapel on campus.\n\nAmerica celebrated its 200th birthday in 1976. To commemorate our nation’s Bicentennial and to honor the distinguished contributions of our Polish forebears to the cause of American independence the Polish Chair presented an impressive exhibit entitled “Polish Contribution to the American Revolution” in the Wilcox Mansion on Delaware Avenue during the month of July 1976. Featured during the exhibit were the works of local artist Henryk J. Jarosz, the paintings of the contemporary Polish historical artist Mieczyslaw Watorski, and a collection entitled “”Teczowa Droga.”\n\nAnother scholar – Dr. Caroline Golab, Professor of History, Ethnic Awareness and Urban Planning at the University of Pennsylvania – visited the speaker’s podium on March 13, 1977 to analyze “Historical Perspectives on the Immigration and Migration Experience.”\n\nThanks to the generous support of the Polish Chair, ten students participated in a study trip to Poland during the Summer of 1977.\n\nThe Polish literary scholar Dr. Zygmunt Kubiak selected the topic “The Golden Age of Polish Culture” in a lecture at the Fireside Lounge in the Student Center on February 5, 1978. Dr. Kubiak reflected on Polish life during the Renaissance and the Polish personalities of that age which helped to create it.\n\nThe Fireside Lounge was also the setting on April 30, 1978, when the Rev. Mr. Anthony Kuzniewski, S.J., PhD. from the Jesuit School of Theology in Chicago presented a perspective on “The Wisconsin Experience – Poles in the Midwest.”\n\nA cultural tour of Poland for high school students was sponsored by the Polish Chair in the Summer of 1978.\n\nThe election of Karol Cardinal Wojtyla to the Chair of St. Peter on October 16, 1978 was a source of unparalleled pride to Poles worldwide. Fr. Demske had intended to invite His Holiness to the 1979 commencement exercises, but the Vatican was unable to make a commitment to do so. Perhaps it was no accident that the historic election of the first Polish pope would eventually express itself in the emergence in Poland of the first non-communist trade union in a communist nation. The month of September 1980 witnessed the founding of NSZZ “Solidarnosc” (ISTU “Solidarity”) in the Gdansk shipyards. Emboldened as it was to strive for the legitimate rights of citizens, Solidarity and the Polish nation-at-large were to experience a chain of ugly repressions -- including the imposition of martial law on December 13, 1981 and the murder of Fr. Jerzy Popieluszko on October 30, 1984.\n\nThere was a response to the ideas and ideals of the Solidarity Movement throughout the world. The Permanent Chair of Polish Culture at Canisius University sponsored approximately 30 lectures throughout the 1980’s and 1990’s. – primarily under the guidance and with the dedication of Fr. Benjamin Fiore, S.J., of the Religious Studies Dept. During this time Fr. “Ben” worked closely with The Solidarity and Human Rights Association Inc. among whose members were its officers Dr. Janice L. Schultz, PhD of the Canisius Philosophy Dept., Mrs. Stanislawa Sorel, and Dr. Marek Zaleski, MD, PhD.\n\nOutstanding speakers were brought to Buffalo by the Polish Chair and The Solidarity and Human Rights Association.

The Citation for Conferral of the Medal, signed by Rev. James M. Demske, S.J., enumerated the details of Senator Stelmachowski’s remarkable career: as a soldier in the underground “Home Army,” he fought the German aggressor; as professor of law, he opposed the illegally imposed post-war government ; as expert adviser to the Provisional National Committee of the Solidarity Union, he aided the forces for freedom during Martial Law.\n\nProf. Stelmachowski was a graduate of the Law Department of Poznan University. He taught law at Wroclaw University and Warsaw University.. He was chairman of the Warsaw Club of Catholic Intelligentsia, and a member of the Episcopate’s “Justitia et Pax” committee. He was a member of the committee for the Pastoral Care of Farmers and renowned internationally as an expert on agricultural law. He was co-creator of the “Round Table” discussions between the government and Solidarity. His election to the first freely-elected senate in post-war Poland and his selection as that body’s president were indicative of the faith and trust his countrymen and colleagues placed in his ability and service to the homeland.\n\nAnother prestigious award was conferred the following year upon Fr.

Zaleski* Memorial Lecture at Canisius University on October 26, 1995. Dr. Wrobel’s lecture was aptly titled “1945: Poland at the end of World War II.” He is the author of numerous articles and books and also taught at the University of Warsaw (Poland) and several American universities.\n\n*(Dr. Marek B.
