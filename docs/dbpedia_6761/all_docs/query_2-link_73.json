        "text": "COLOURS EUROPEAN UNIVERSITY’S OFFICE\n\nJan Dlugosz University in Czestochowa, as a beneficiary of the EU programme entitled European Universities, cooperates intensively with 8 European universities. On 1 February 2024, the Office of the COLOURS European University was launched within the structure of the Department for Research & International Relations, whose tasks include: coordinating the work of the Alliance, cooperating with representatives of working groups (Work Packages) at JDU and partner universities, and representing the University and the Alliance at the international arena. The person in charge of the office is the Senior International Cooperation Specialist, Institutional Coordinator of the Erasmus+ Programme, Bartłomiej Kowalik, MA. The office is located in room 142 (first floor), Waszyngtona 4/8.\n\nThe name of the consortium COLOURS is an acronym derived from the words COLlaborative innOvative sUstainable Regional univerSities. The COLOURS alliance brings together 9 universities from different parts of Europe with approx. 126,000 students and over 12,000 employees. Full members of the Alliance are: Jan Dlugosz University in Czestochowa, Josip Jurai Strossmayer University of Osijek (Croatia), Le Mans University (France), Kristianstad University (Sweden), Paderborn University (Germany) - consortium leader, University of Castilla-La Mancha (Spain), University of Ferrara (Italy), University St. Kliment Ohridski - Bitola (North Macedonia), Ventspils University of Applied Sciences (Latvia). The total amount of EU funding for the project is over EUR 14 million.\n\nCONFERENCE OF STUDENT REPRESENTATIVES OF EUROPEAN UNIVERSITIES\n\nFrom 7 December to 10 December, the first Conference of Student Representatives of European Universities took place in Coimbra, Portugal.\n\nIn the context of participation in the conference, the main objective was to obtain relevant information on the challenges of student representation at the European level. This meeting was an excellent opportunity to share experiences and proposals for solutions that have the potential to be used as part of the participation of JDU in the COLOURS consortium.\n\nOrganised by ESU (European Student's Union), the Conference provides a platform for the development of student representation at the European level. It acts as a consultative body, integrating the views of student representatives from different academic alliances.\n\nDuring the ESU Conference, key topics related to the social dimension, student representation, mobility, funding and quality assurance of teaching from the perspective of students were discussed. Discussions were also held on maintaining continuity and involvement of student communities of individual universities in the context of the consortia to which they belong. Lack of continuity may lead to the loss of important knowledge and a decrease in engagement within partner universities. This poses a real threat to all Consortia.\n\nThe ESU Conference acts as a consultative body within the ESU structures. Its role includes consulting on policy documents related to the European Universities Initiative and other transnational initiatives in the field of higher education. It is planned to set up working groups within the Conference, focusing on areas such as quality assurance, funding and democratic representation of students.\n\nIn the future, subsequent conferences will be attended by people representing the entire student community, not only of Jan Dlugosz University, but of all members of the COLOURS consortium. This means that through the Student Forum, which will be created as part of the Alliance, students of member universities will have the opportunity to influence the legislature of higher education at the European level.\n\nThe representative of the COLOURS Alliance at the conference was a JDU student Aleksander Frymus.\n\nPARTNERS OF COLOURS ALLIANCE MEET IN CZESTOCHOWA\n\nJan Dlugosz University in Czestochowa is hosting the Partners implementing the COLOURS project together with our University. The opening ceremony took place on November 13, 2023 in the \"Auditorium Maximum\".

We hope that we will be able to create permanent bonds of cooperation that will pay off in the years to come.\n\n- This is a great opportunity to internationalise our University and make it even more open to Europe, - explains prof. dr Janusz Kapuśniak. - We hope that the COLOURS project and the status of the European University will have an influence on this process and will have a lasting impact on the exchange of students and staff. We hope that the project will allow us together with our partners to develop innovative solutions, which will be implemented in many areas of business.\n\nThe partner meeting at the University of Częstochowa is aimed at organising plenary sessions and workshops devoted to individual Work Packages. Further organisational and substantive issues related to the establishment of a joint European University will be discussed.\n\nCOLOURS, i.e. COLlaborative innOvative sUstainable Regional univerSities, is an alliance of nine universities from EU countries, whose common feature is a strong commitment to the development of the regions, which, apart from Jan Dlugosz University in Czestochowa, includes: Paderborn University (Germany) - leader, University of Castilla-La Mancha (Spain), University of Ferrara (Italy), Le Mans University (France), Kristianstad University (Sweden), Josip Juraj Strossmayer University in Osijek (Croatia), University St. Kliment Ohridski Bitola (Macedonia), Ventspils University of Applied Sciences (Latvia).\n\nThe project will start in January 2024.\n\nMedia about the event:\n\n- Radio Fiat\n\n- Radio Katowice\n\n- Dziennik Zachodni\n\n- Życie Częstochowy i Powiatu\n\n​COLOURS EUROPEAN UNIVERSITY - MEETING WITH RECTOR AND CHANCELLOR AUTHORITIES\n\nOn October 18, in the Auditorium Maximum, a meeting of the Rector and Chancellor Authorities of Jan Dlugosz University with the University employees was held.

It will be an alliance of European universities strongly involved in the development of the regions they represent. This initiative will promote joint educational programmes in international and interdisciplinary teams in the field of research and innovation, in cooperation with local external stakeholders."
