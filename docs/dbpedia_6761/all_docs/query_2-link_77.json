Jan Długosz was a 15th century Polish priest and chronicler who wrote the most significant works of medieval Eastern European historiography. He is best known for his 12-volume work, the Annals of Jan Długosz, which chronicles historical events in Eastern Europe and remains a trustworthy source of information about medieval Poland. Długosz also authored works like the Life of St. Stanislaus and an inventory of properties owned by the Cracow bishopric. His historical and literary works provide valuable insights into 15th century Polish politics, history, geography, and the Catholic Church.",
