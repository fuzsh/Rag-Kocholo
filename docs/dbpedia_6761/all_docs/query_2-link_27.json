        "text": "In the article, the author tries to juxtapose several historiographically important problems that historians in autonomous Galicia and Banovinaconsidered.The matterconcernsthe historical figure of the ruler consideredtobethe father of the nation,i.e.T omislav, as well as the first twoPiasts, Bolesław and Mieszko, the issue of space, and thus the attitude of Croatian historiography towards Bosnia and Herzegovina, Dalmatia,aswellasthe enemy, whichfor the Croats were initially Hungarians, while later Germans, who were considered the eternal enemies of Poles.\n\nFollowing St Stanisław of Szczepanów’s (d. 1079) canonization in 1253, the Kraków Dominican Wincenty of Kielcza composed two hagiographic works concerning the sainted bishop’s life and martyrdom. The vitae provided an elaborate account of Bishop Stanisław’s conflict with King Bolesław II and his eventual murder at the hand of the Piast king. For later chroniclers, Wincenty’s narrative cemented Stanisław as patron and intercessor for the regnum Poloniae through whose sacrifice the fragmented kingdom would once again become whole. In this paper, I explore the relationship between piety and representations of rulership in the vitae and its bearing on the hagiographer’s vision for the future restorer-king prophesied in the Vita maior. I will first contrast King Bolesław II’s impiety with the piety of King Bolesław I, who was characterized by his obedience to St Adalbert. I will then proceed by examining Wincenty’s original addition to Polish medieval historiography, the legend of ‘Kazimierz the Monk,’ to illuminate the centrality of piety in his conception of rulership. I argue that by portraying Kazimierz the Restorer (d. 1058) as a Cluniac monk prior to his reign, Wincenty presented him first as atoning for dynastic negligence and the nation’s collective sinfulness, and then as acting pro defensione ecclesiae by restoring peace. Ultimately, this paper aims to highlight elements of Wincenty of Kielcza’s vitae that have been largely untouched in Anglophone scholarship by examining how their representation of the piety of past rulers prefigures the necessary patronage of St Stanisław for a future Polish king.\n\nThis article is an attempt to illustrate relations between the theory and practice of the military activity of Polish bishops under the rule of the Piast dynasty. The problem is discussed based on an analysis of the locally formulated ideal of episcopal power and the ideological and legal patterns reaching Poland that regulated the possibilities of using weapons by clergymen, and, in particular, defined the ways in which churchmen participated in wars and in declaring and conducting them.\n\nThis article discusses the stance and strategies of town magistrates regarding various kinds of sexual behaviour in the kingdom of Hungary in the second half of the sixteenth century. The study is based on the analyses of judicial cases of accused women. It examines not only the nature of sexual crimes and imposed punishments, but also how the language was used in the court records to name and label the offences and offenders in a way which reflects the moralistic discourse of the period. This period witnessed a crucial shift in the attitude towards extramarital sexuality, prostitution and brothels. While brothels existed in towns in the late medieval period and the beginning of the sixteenth century (some brothels even under the official control of the"
