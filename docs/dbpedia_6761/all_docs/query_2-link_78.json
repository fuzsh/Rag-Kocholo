        "text": "Research interests\n\nUntil recently, my main research interest has been focused on materials science and technology (with particular emphasis on: soft magnetic materials, amorphous and nanostructured alloys); these subject areas are aligned with my PhD in Physics. During my scientific career, I have published (as author or co-author) more than 20 papers in relevant scientific journals. In addition, I have attended more than 20 international and national conferences, at which I gave multimedia presentations of my work. I have over 15 years’ experience of carrying out experiments in this field.\n\nNow, after 10 years of working in Industry, I have returned to Academia with additional research interests, aligned with my extensive experience, gained whilst working in Supply Chain and Business Intelligence. My interests are focussed on the exploration of modern local and global integrated supply chain management (covering traditional supply chain topics, such as: procurement, inventory management, operations, quality management, logistics and transportation). Emphasis is placed on issues related to: sustainability, ethical business practices, and supply chain analytics. I am interested in the processes of maintaining the management and growth of effective and efficient supply chains, through: IT tools, Big Data analytics, business processes and performance metrics.\n\nSupervisory Interests\n\nI’m interested in research supervision in: Supply Chain, Logistics and Operations Management - with emphasis on use of data analytics and quantitative methods in the supply chain to improve decision-making for all activities across the supply chain.\n\nScholarly biography\n\nAfter completion of my A levels at the Technology College, I joined the Jan Dlugosz University in Czestochowa (Poland), to study ‘STEM subjects with teacher training’. I hold both the BSc and MSc degrees in Physics, gained from that University.\n\nEquipped with my MSc degree, I decided to continue my career in research and Academia at the Czestochowa University of Technology (Poland), and, in 2005, I successfully completed my PhD thesis, and was awarded a PhD degree in Physics, at the University of Lodz (Poland).\n\nIn 2007, I arrived in the UK, and joined the University of Brighton as a Research Officer, to work on the successful completion of an Anglo-French collaborative project; for this, I had to design and develop a production process for new, highly-magnetostrictive, composite materials.\n\nAfter completion of this project, I moved to work in Industry, and, for the next 10 years, gained extensive experience working within the: operations, planning, supply chain and finance (business intelligence) departments for an SME company within the FMCG sector.\n\nIn June 2019, I returned to work in Higher Education, as Lecturer in Supply Chain at University of Brighton – in order to pass-on my Industrial experience.\n\nApproach to teaching\n\nCurrently, I hold the position of Lecturer in Supply Chain. My previous teaching experience includes:\n\n• Lecturing, part-time, in: Physics, Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, and lab demonstration work during my PhD studies.\n\n• Equalisation of knowledge differences in first-year student groups; thereby allowing under-performing students to achieve their full potential.\n\n• Final-year MSc Project Supervision.\n\n• Teaching in Secondary School - Physics and Mathematics to pupils of age range 12 – 15 years.\n\n• Teaching in Technical College in the Research Institute of Technology - Physics, Mathematics and Information Technology to pupils of 15 – 20 years.\n\n• Giving one-to-one lessons to secondary school pupils and students with learning difficulties.\n\nI like to teach the theory and practice of Supply Chain Management, supplementing the University experience, where possible, with Industrial visits.\n\nSince I am research-active, I try to incorporate my research and my extensive industrial experience into my teaching.\n\nCurrently, in addition to the supervision of: Research, Placements and Projects, I teach modules in:\n\nLevel 6 Procurement and Supply Chain Management (Module Leader)\n\nLevel 7 Logistics and Supply Chain Management (Module Leader)\n\nLevel 7 Analytics for Logistics (Module Leader)\n\nLevel 7 Enterprise Systems and E-Procurement\n\nLevel 6 Developing Professional Practice in Business\n\nLevel 4 Managing Systems and Operations"
