        "text": "I'm an English teacher and a teacher trainer long involved in Computer-Assisted Language Learning and absolutely fascinated with how new technologies change our work, lifestyles and communication. I love discovering new cultures and it always puzzles me that Europe is so rich and so diverse. Telecollaborative projects are a great tool for this kind of discovery and I'm so happy to see my students develop in such exchanges\n\nIn my free time, which I have very little now, I enjoy walking in the mountains, swimming and exploring new things. I like people :-))\n\nMy career motto is that technology will never replace teachers but teachers who use technology will replace those who do not.\n\nI hope you enjoy my course :-)"
