The main subject of this paper is a meaning ascribed to the idea of “social justice” in the face of goals of welfare state. From this point of view very important are various senses of the notion. It can be distinguished in this area at least two related aspects. The fi rst refers to characteristic of the justice itself. It can be described as a virtue, norm or right. The second one applies to the particular type of justice identifi ed with social justice. In this respect relevant are: legal, distributive and retributive (or commutative) justice. Aside from that, social justice is also treated as an idea of equality or solidarity in social environment.\n\nKeywords: philosophy of politics, ethics, justice, social justice, welfare state.\n\nMikołaj Raczyński\n\nUniversity of Warsaw\n\nThe future by the past: The role of history in the concept of constitutional patriotism of Jürgen Habermas\n\nSummary: The defi nition of patriotism is usually restricted to the conclusion that its aim is mere cultivation of the historical memory. However, patriotism has two distinct faces: one pointed at the past and the other focused on the present. What is more, in the opinion of many scholars, patriotism doesn’t need to be closely related to one nation or culture. An interesting concept of constitutional patriotism was developed by German historians and philosophers during the debate on national identity after World War II. Jürgen Habermas has been one of the founders of this project. According to the German philosopher, constitutional patriotism doesn’t mean just positivist constitutional acts, but some abstract forms, interpretations of a particular community. Such universal principles may be, for instance, procedures of sovereignty and liberal rights. The following article conveys arguments indicating that the role of history is very important in the concept of constitutional patriotism by Jürgen Habermas.\n\nKeywords: Jürgen Habermas, constitutional patriotism, history, philosophy, democracy.\n\nMarcin Wałdoch\n\nKazimierz Wielki University in Bydgoszcz\n\nBarries for consolidaton of local democracy: presentism and recentivism\n\nSummary: Constructing collective identity is one of the most crucial challenge for political power which seek legitimization. Pursuing such aim political actors choose different tools due to theirs ideological affiliation and political roots. One may observe in local Poland that depoliticization process play its role. This have a great impact on local communities. That is why local political elites make barriers for disputing history by using two techniques: presentism (is the view that neither the future nor the past exist – past times must meet present political requirements) and recentivism (only present time exist). Such practice of political power makes barriers for consolidation of democracy.\n\nKeywords: democracy, local politics, legitimization, political actor, depoliticitization.\n\nAdam Gwiazda\n\nKazimierz Wielki University in Bydgoszcz\n\nThe end of special relationships between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia?\n\nSummary: The Saudi special relationships with the U.S., unlike that of the U.S. with Israel, are mutually benefi cial. Saudi Arabia sells about 10 million barrels of oil a day and all those transactions are denominated in American dollars, which helps that currency to perform the role of the currency of account (world, s currency) and has been of crucial help to the American ambition to dominate the global economy. On the other hand the United States did its part to uphold the relationship be granting the security to Saudi Arabia and other Gulf oil states. This was demonstrated for example in 1990 during Iraqi attack on Kuwait, that also menaced Saudi Arabia. At that time the U.S. deployed 400,000 troops in Saudi Arabia and expelled Iraqi troops from Kuwait. The priority of American foreign policy in that region has been to keep Gulf oil in friendly hands. Since the increase of the production of shale oil in the United States that priority has been less important. Another factor which has exerted an influence on the nature of the U.S.-Saudi relationship was the signing the permanent agreement with Iran in July 2015 on the limitation of the Iranian nuclear program and normalization of political-economic relations with the West. This has led to further worsening of the U.S.-Saudi Arabia alliance which has always been like a ”marriage of convenience” where behind the façade of friendship and harmony there is cold calculation of benefi ts and losses. That alliance will last as long as the potential benefits will still be bigger than possible losses.\n\nKeywords: Saudi Arabia, United States, crude oil, Iran, special relationship.\n\nPiotr Walewicz\n\nKazimierz Wielki University in Bydgoszcz\n\nThe narrations on the annexation of Crimea in „Foreign Affairs” seen through theories of international relations\n\nSummary: Publications in western specialized journals which describe the Russian Federation’s international behavior have always followed a certain paradigm of international relations. The article is an analysis of opinions and beliefs held by commentators and analysts writing for „Foreign Affairs”, based on their publications about the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation on march 2014. They have been scrutinized using three predominant theories of international relations: realism, liberalism and constructivism. The research proved that western commentators and analysts writing about the annexation of Crimea usually present a single paradigm of international relations. Moreover, they believe it to be the only eff ective tool in explaining countries’ foreign policy, thereby depreciating the value and usefulness of other paradigms.\n\nKeywords: 2014 Annexation of Crimea, American political journals, International politics – theory.\n\nMaxim Enin\n\nNational Technical University of Ukraine\n\nThe change of the attitude of Ukrainians to Russia in the conditions of the anti-terrorism operation and humanitarian aid needs of population of Donbass region: the results of sociological researches\n\nAbstract: The article describes the specific features of the new terrorism in the Donbass which has the support of Russia in the struggle for influence on the policy of Ukraine.

One of the most problematic issues resulting from the confrontation with the crimes from 1976 – 1983 was so called transitional justice and the problem of identity and collective memory of societies coming out of the period of trauma, which are characterized by a high polarization due to diff erent, even contradictory at times interpretations and ideas about the past. The article attempts to analyze the diff icult process of settlement of the dirty war period, including the characteristics of the preceding events, the policy of the fi rst democratic governments and the original strategies developed by the argentine movement for human rights, which on the one hand aimed to combat with the impunity of the perpetrators, and on the other hand to counteract the social amnesia and to keep the memory about the tragic past events alive.\n\nKeywords: transition to democracy in Argentina, human rights violations, “dirty war”, politics of memory and oblivion, collective memory.\n\nMarek Szczutkowski\n\nKazimierz Wielki University in Bydgoszcz\n\nSports and politics. Influence of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia on Drazen Petrovic’s personal life and sports career\n\nSummary: Drazen Petrovic was a unique personality.

The purpose of this article is to indicate, based on the analysis of the case of Kosovo, its effects in relation to the contemporary status quo in the international system. Through this case study, will be indicated areas, in which is the greatest probability of use the precedent resulting in Kosovo.

This is because, through the tools of historical policy, the authority has the opportunity to shape the expected vision of the state and nation in the international arena. This remains controversial due to the fact that the possibility of an arbitrary silence inconvenient facts and events. The main aim of this article was to show the importance of historical policy as a tool to build the country’s image in the international arena, not evaluating the policy pursued by the authorities. This issue is discussed in a wide range in the pages of various publications and at scientific conferences or debates historians. Analysing the literature and the press reports and off icial documents of institutions and government agencies have been in the paper a short review of selected policy definitions historical aspects of its tools and its implementation and postulates policy history in the future. Historical policy should be implemented by the Polish state as part of the construction of the position of the State in the international sphere, but mainly as an element of education of the next generations of Poles. I have no doubt that in the international, worldwide, all reasonable state, who understand their needs, and above all, to have a sense of their statehood and dignity, pursue an active policy of history.\n\nKeywords: historical politics, politics of memory, politics, memory, history, historical tradition, collective memory.\n\nMagdalena Włodarczyk\n\nMaria Curie-Skłodowska University in Lublin\n\nPolish-Georgian relations in 1918 – 1921\n\nSummary: The tradition of Polish-Georgian relations is many centuries old. It manifested itself diff erently over the course of history, originally based on the ideology of the Sarmatism and a diplomatic alliance in the war against Turkey. Later, when they were annexed by the Russian Empire, it was based on their fi ght for independence against a common enemy. Their relations have a political and historical background, and are associated with the resettlement policy of Russia. Establishing diplomatic relationships during the short period of the Democratic Republic of Georgia’s existence meant acknowledging Georgia internationally, fi rst de facto, and then de iure. The cooperation was focused mainly on providing safe return for large Polish minority living in Transcaucasia, and on Marshal Józef Piłsudzki’s federalist agenda which supported newly emerged states. Both countries’ relations were reinforced by signing a military alliance and creating Polish-Georgian Industrial and Trade Union. The cooperation was finally ended by Soviet Russia’s assault on Georgia in year 1921.\n\nKeywords: Polish-Georgian relations, Georgia, federalism, foreign affairs, Caucasia.\n\nPrzemysław Waszak\n\nNicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń\n\nInclusions of socio-political matters and matters considered in terms of outlook in the medieval art history research.
