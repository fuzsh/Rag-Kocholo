        "text": "2\n\nThe Town and the Jewish Community before 1700\n\nEARLY HISTORY\n\nAn ancient town in the Polish context, Opatów had acquired considerable importance and a sizable population by the midfourteenth century. One estimate puts the population then at 1,728. Even before 1237, when the bishop of Lubusz acquired the town with its sixteen villages from Henryk Brodaty, Opatów was host to a strong clerical presence, as suggested by its name: Opatów is derived from the same root as the English word abbot, which indicates the significance of a monastic order in the early history of the town. Indeed, in 1232, the contemporary Cistercian abbot in Opatów, Gerard, was raised to the rank of bishop of the Latins in Ruthenia. The town was owned by the bishopric of Lubusz from 1237 to 1514. During that period, Opatów expanded and developed as a center of regional commerce.1\n\nIn 1282, the duke of Cracow-Sandomierz, Leszko Czarny, promulgated a “privilege of foundation” for the town of Opatów. A fourteenth-century royal approbation of this privilege refers to the town as wielki (great) Opatów.2 Official documents continued to designate the town in this way until the end of the eighteenth century. The clerical owners of the town encouraged its commercial development, building stores and a town hall and establishing a weekly market day (Saturday) and two annual fairs. These efforts were crowned with success. This can be seen in the royal privileges of Casimir the Great (1366), Władysław Jagiełło (1389), and Kazimierz Jagiełło (1459), intended to safeguard the centrality of Sandomierz in the commerce of the region. The privileges were directed primarily and explicitly against competition by the merchants of Opatów.3 It was during the fifteenth century that the regional assembly (sejmik) of the district (województwo) of Sandomierz first met in Opatów.4 In view of this and of the considerable attention devoted to the town by the contemporary chronicler Jan Długosz (1415–80), it would seem likely that Opatów was the second city of the region, after Sandomierz, during the fifteenth century.5\n\nAt the beginning of the sixteenth century, however, the town was virtually destroyed in Tatar attacks, the most damaging of which occurred during the major incursion led by the sons of Mengli-Girey in 1502. The contemporary bishop of Lubusz, Teodoryk, took a number of steps to encourage reconstruction, including obtaining from the monarch certain tax exemptions for the town’s residents (in 1504) and the right to add a third fair (in 1505). Perhaps because of the costs of rebuilding, the bishop then decided to sell the Opatów holding.\n\nThe new owner was Krzysztof Szydłowiecki (1467–1532), one of the most prominent men at court. He purchased Opatów and its villages on October 12, 1514, for 10,000 Hungarian florins.6 The sale was confirmed by the king in July of the next year. Szydłowiecki, prepared to invest in his new property and immediately set about making improvements, including repairs to the walls and the aqueduct and the construction of four gates. He was able also to obtain exemption from certain tolls for Opatów’s merchants and tax benefits for its residents.7\n\nOn Szydłowiecki’s death in 1532, the Opatów holding was divided among his three daughters: Krystyna, Elżbieta, and Zofia. Krystyna sold her share in 1548 to her sister Zofia’s husband, Jan Tarnowski (1488–1561). Elżbieta and her husband, Mikołaj “Czarny” Radziwiłł (1515–65), owned the remaining third. In the next generation, the larger share was held by Zofia and Jan Tarnowski’s daughter, also named Zofia, and her husband, Konstanty Wazyl Ostrogski (1527–1608). The smaller share was the object of a prolonged judicial dispute between the two children of Elżbieta and Mikołaj “Czarny” Radziwiłł: Mikołaj Krzysztof Radziwiłł (1549–1616) and his sister Krystyna, the wife of Jan Zamoyski (1542–1605). Ultimately, the Radziwiłł side sold their one-third share to the Ostrogskis, likely during the ninth decade of the sixteenth century. Certainly, by 1595, the entire Opatów holding was controlled by Janusz Ostrogski (1554–1620), son of Zofia and Konstanty Wazyl. Presumably, the latter purchased the one-third share of Opatów during the period when he was consolidating his hold on all the Tarnowski estates.8 During the seventeenth century, Opatów remained in the hands of various members of the Ostrogski clan.9\n\nSzydłowiecki, Tarnowski, Zamoyski, Radziwiłł, Ostrogski—these were names to conjure with in Poland in the sixteenth century. They belonged to some of the most prominent and influential magnate-aristocrats of the state. Unfortunately, the available sources reveal very little about their policies relating specifically to the Opatów holding. With such powerful and effective personages as owners, it seems reasonable to assume that the administration of the estate was fairly efficient, providing the stability and the security necessary for the growth of the town’s population and the continuation and expansion of commercial and manufacturing activity.\n\nThe transfer of the property from clerical ownership did not signal an end to the substantial clerical presence in the town. The legacy of the earlier period was the continuing existence, through the eighteenth century, of two clerical jurisdictional enclaves not subject to municipal authority. These were autonomous clerical townlets, referred to in the records as miasteczko Dziekania and miasteczko Kantoria.10 The residence of artisans and even merchants in these enclaves, as in the case of such jurydyki in other towns, was a constant thorn in the side of the municipal authorities and of the guildsmen of the city.11\n\nTHE BEGINNINGS OF JEWISH SETTLEMENT\n\nUnlike their counterparts in medieval Western Europe, Jews in Poland only rarely settled in towns owned by churchmen.12 A register of Jewish communities recorded in 1507, not surprisingly therefore, did not mention Opatów.13 In fact, the earliest known reference to Jews in the town dates from 1538: there were four Jewish families in the town at that time.14 Thus, it seems likely that Jews first came to live there shortly after the town was acquired by Krzysztof Szydłowiecki in 1514. The assessment of the Jews of Opatów at eighty zloties in the capitation tax rolls of 1578 suggests a community of substantial size. The privilege issued by Mikołaj Krzysztof Radziwiłł to the merchants’ and shopkeepers’ guild of Opatów in 1569 promised the guild members protection against Jewish “wrongdoing and deceit.”15 Two years later, the same Mikołaj Krzysztof issued a privilege to the Jews in his part of Opatów that mentions no restrictions on Jewish commercial activity.16\n\nTHE PRIVILEGE\n\nThat privileges were granted to individual communities at a time when there were general charters guaranteeing the rights of Jews in all of Poland reflects the growing decentralization of power in the commonwealth. Particularly after 1539, when the Sejm granted the town owners exclusive jurisdiction over Jews in their holdings, thus removing from Jews the right of appeal to royal courts, the desirability of particular guarantees of the rights and privileges of Jews increased. It should be recalled, also, that the legal traditions underlying the granting of juridical autonomy to Jews—their right to follow their own traditions and to be judged in accordance with their own laws—were very ancient indeed. In the Polish context, not only were the cities themselves founded on the basis of jure theutonico et libertate magdeburiensis, but even within the city, certain ethnic-religious groups sought various forms of autonomy. This was the case with Armenians and Scots and, in some measure, Italians as well. When the Firlejs, owners of Lewartów (Lubartów), near Lublin, wanted to attract Dutch and Flemish artisans to their own town to foster its development as a center of textile manufacturing, they promised the new settlers not only freedom of worship, but suo patrio iure iutatur. Although there were, at times, Armenians, Scots, Greeks, and Germans residing in Opatów, their numbers were never sufficient to warrant any form of organization.17\n\nIt might be said, then—in view of the fact that the legal definition of Jews’ rights, privileges, and duties in the town was entirely distinct from that of their Christian neighbors, and in view of the existence, further, of a separate court for them—that Jews were “in the city but not of it.” This, however, would not reflect their very substantial numerical presence nor the commercial, industrial, fiscal, and administrative significance of Jews in the town. Certainly by the early eighteenth century, when there was a clear Jewish majority in Opatów, one might rather apply the epigram “in the city but not of it” to the Christian population, particularly in view of the significant proportion of the Christian residents living in the town but engaged in agriculture.\n\nThe copy of the privilege granted to the Jews of Opatów, which is in the Archive of Old Acts (Archiwum Główne Akt Dawnych) in Warsaw, dates from 1670 (appendix 1). It was signed in Opatów on July 25, 1670, by Alexander Janusz Ostrogski. Embedded in the document are five earlier privileges, summaries of privileges, or approbations (table 2.1). This text, then, was the formal expression of Jewish rights and obligations confirmed by ten different owners of Opatów over a period of almost two centuries. The various owners made only the slightest modifications to the earliest formulations in the document, which dates back to 1571. It would not be correct, however, to take this as an indication that there was very little change in the town owners’ policies during that two-hundred-year period.\n\nThe earliest passages in the Jews’ privilege date from the period when ownership of the town was divided between Mikołaj Krzysztof Radziwiłł and Konstanty Wasyl Ostrogski. Radziwiłł affirmed that the Jews have “presented evidence” to Ostrogski proving that “they have always held [certain] freedom[s] in the town of Opatów.” There is no indication as to what form this evidence of previously granted freedoms might have taken, and no earlier privilege was cited. Nevertheless, the passage can be taken to indicate that the community was certainly not being established de novo in 1571. This conclusion is buttressed by the rather laconic manner of listing the actual privileges granted by Ostrogski and Radziwiłł. Indeed, an earlier privilege, now lost, was apparently promulgated in 1545.18\n\nThe Ostrogski text of 1571 is not preserved in full in the document. It was merely paraphrased by Radziwiłł in one sentence: “that they have always had the freedom in the town of Opatów to sell wine and all other beverages and to sell goods of all kinds every day in their houses and in shops on the marketplace.” Radziwiłł, “wishing in no way to diminish or to disturb their established rights and freedom,” accepted “completely,” what Ostrogski had provided. Radziwiłł ordered his representative to enforce this in “our part of Opatów.” The concern here, clearly, was to grant the Jews freedom to pursue commercial activities of all sorts without restriction, a tendency seen in a substantial number of contemporary privileges to other Jewish communities.19 Wine and other beverages had to be mentioned explicitly, because their manufacture and sale were subject to the control of the town owner.\n\nRadziwiłł’s text goes on to say that, just as the Jews, in return for this privilege, had in the past paid certain taxes, made certain payments, and fulfilled certain obligations, “like the other burghers, our subjects,” so they continued to be obliged in the same way. This is very vague wording, indeed, but it seems to have put Jews on an equal footing with Christian residents of the town in terms of their fiscal obligations to the town owner. The reference to “obligations,” in addition to taxes and payments, could have meant labor duties (gwałt or szarwark), but this cannot be deduced with certainty from the present text.20\n\nThe earlier privileges were endorsed without modification by Konstanty Ostrogski in 1575 and by Janusz Ostrogski in 1595. In 1633, however, Władysław Dominik Ostrogski broadened the contents considerably by addressing a number of issues not mentioned in the earlier texts. “First of all, [they are] free to erect and build in their district [na gruncie ich], a synagogue, a school [szkoła], a cemetery and a hospital-poorhouse [szpital, or heqdesh] as well as houses for residence.” This passage is striking in a number of its aspects and not least because it is known that all four of the specific institutions named had been established well before 1633. The synagogue was built in the sixteenth century.21 An “inventory” of the town carried out in 1618 listed a szpital, a szkoła, and a Jewish cemetery.22 Thus, although only this 1633 version has been preserved, it seems possible that the contents replicate the text of some earlier, lost, privilege. Alternatively, it could be maintained that only in 1633, for some unknown reason, did the Jewish community find it necessary to obtain specific and official confirmation of the rights of residence, which up to then they had enjoyed de facto but not de jure. Or, finally, the explanation could be that a fire had destroyed the Jewish street sometime between 1618 and 1633. The preamble to the 1633 text did note that the Jews of the town had asked Ostrogski to reissue the privilege because some of their own copies of the privilege had been lost in a fire.\n\nIn the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a number of scholars took the passage in the 1633 privilege referring to the Jews’ district as indicating the establishment at that time of a separate neighborhood or street for Jews in Opatów.23 Based on the 1618 inventory, however, it must be concluded that such a separate area existed before 1633 (see chapter 1). Further, it is noteworthy that there is no negative language in the text, excluding, for example, Jews from residence in the marketplace or elsewhere. Very likely, Jews in Opatów had always been concentrated mainly on one street. Even though residential segregation was fairly unusual in private towns,24 the particular history of Opatów might explain this apparent anomaly in the sociotopography of the town.\n\nThe key factor was the legacy of clerical ownership and the persistence of clerical districts in the town. In such conditions, the “sociotopographic dynamic” might have led to the creation of a further separate division for Jews. Moreover, it will be recalled that the earliest Polish synodal enactment referring to Jews demanded that they live in “contiguous or adjoining houses in a separate location in each city or village.”25 This hypothesis need not be extended to the conclusion that Jews dwelt in Opatów before its sale by the Bishop of Lubusz to Krzysztof Szydłowiecki in 1514. What is being suggested is merely that, in a town already divided into separate residential areas governed by clergy and laymen, the addition of another separate district would have been a natural development.\n\nHow should this residential segregation be evaluated? It was not enforced with complete efficacy; at every point when it is possible to know where Jews lived, there was always a handful in Christian areas.26 Nevertheless, it would seem that from the beginning of the seventeenth century at least—and in all probability, from the start of Jewish residence in Opatów—there was a physical division of areas of residence between the “Christian town” and the “Jewish town” (and the clerical towns). It is likely that, at least at first, Jews did not experience the division of the town as a form of oppression. It was routine and unexceptional for Jews to want to live together. As the population grew, however, and it was “impossible to expand their boundaries,” the restriction did become irksome.27 Despite the complaints of the Christian burghers, the Jewish town expanded nonetheless during the eighteenth century. But the pattern of two separate districts was maintained.28\n\nEven in 1633, the community was of a size sufficient to support the existence of both a synagogue and a szkoła. The latter term may have meant a beit midrash, that is, a kind of public study hall—chapel, where men came to study. Alternatively, it could have meant a yeshiva, a somewhat more formal academy headed by a scholar. Indeed, the earliest known rabbi of Opatów, at the end of the sixteenth century or the early years of the seventeenth century, was addressed as rabbi (av beit din, or chief judge) and head of the academy (resh metivta).29 In many towns, these institutions, as well as the poorhouse-hospital and the cemetery, were exempt from property taxes. In Opatów, at least in 1618, this was not the case, as shown by the inventory of that year, which indicates that taxes were collected for all of those properties.\n\nThe 1633 privilege went on to restate, in almost the same language as the sixteenth-century privileges, the granting of full commercial freedom to Jews. They were permitted to sell various beverages and wine, as well as all goods, on any day, in their houses or in the marketplace. Appended in this version, however, was a hint that Christian competitors resented these Jewish rights. The text forbids any hindrance by the burghers to the exercise of these rights (przeszkody od mieszczań zakazaliśmy).\n\nThe next clause permitted Jews to slaughter and sell meat freely in their butchers’ stalls. This was a right that Polish Jews had been guaranteed from the period of the medieval charters, and it was seldom abridged.30 The Jews’ religious requirement that they slaughter their own animals was understood and accepted. Since, however, certain parts of the animal were not kosher and certain animals were found not to be kosher once their organs were examined, Jewish butchers developed a Christian clientele as well. Indeed, in the course of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, in many towns, the meat business fell virtually entirely into Jewish hands. For the right to slaughter meat and for the use of the stalls, an annual payment of one hundred zloties “to our treasury” was demanded by Ostrogski. He immediately stated, however, that all the other payments, taxes, and obligations of the Jews would be the same as those of the burghers “in accordance with old custom” (według dawnego trybu iako y mieszczanie (za)chowaliśmy).\n\nThe final matter taken up in this privilege is the question of courts. Ostrogski maintained the courts of the Jews as of old. The term used is rather imprecise; they were designated the “courts of the elders” (sądy przy starszych ich). While there were lay courts in Jewish society, the reference might well have been expected to be to rabbinic courts (duchowny or rabinacki).31 Whatever the precise meaning of the term, the main significance here was the exemption of Jews from the jurisdiction of the Christian municipal courts. The extent of this exemption was not specified. Which court had jurisdiction in mixed cases—with a Jewish plaintiff and a Christian defendant or vice versa—was not made clear.32 From other sources, it is known that at the beginning of the eighteenth century, if the plaintiff was a Christian burgher and the defendant was a Jew, the case was heard in the kahal courts.33\n\nWhatever their precise jurisdiction, the decisions of the Jews’ courts could be appealed to the owner’s own court (do sądu naszego nadwornego). This clause, of course, had very far-reaching implications, indeed. It concretized the weakening of the authority and the power of the Jewish community. It illustrated the paradoxical quality of the relations between the kahal and the pan, that is, the lord. On the one hand, the communal institutions served the interests of the town owner and he, in his turn, strengthened these institutions. On the other hand, it was the town owner who wielded the real power, and this tended to vitiate the authority of the elders and the judges of the Jewish community.34 This issue is discussed at greater length in chapter 8.\n\nIt might be well to add here that, in some private towns, the autonomous national or regional court system of the Jews was recognized. In at least two “daughter” communities of Opatów—Tarłów and Tarnobrzeg—both private towns belonging to other owners, appeals of cases between Jews were explicitly recognized as belonging to the competence “of the elders of the region of Opatów” (starszych ziemskich Opatowskich).35\n\nAfter 1633, no significant changes or modifications were made to the charters by subsequent town owners. The privilege became a kind of constitutional document, guaranteeing the rights and privileges of the Jews of Opatów. Thus, in 1708, the Christian municipality complained to the town owner’s officials: “According to city law, Jews are to conduct trade and sell alcoholic beverages only on their own street, and not to harm the Christians. Now, however, Jews manufacture beer and mead and sell wine as well as hay, oats, herring, fish, barley, salt, candles, and meat on our marketplace. Even pork, which they do not eat, they sell anyway.” The response quotes the privilege of the Jews verbatim, rejecting the complaint, and concluding that “the burghers must respect the law.”36\n\nThe privilege of the Jewish community of Opatów, in its concentration on commercial activities and the granting of commercial freedom, was representative of a broad trend in Polish legislation during the second half of the sixteenth and the first half of the seventeenth centuries.37 Characteristic also were the clauses added in the 1633 charter, which assured the independence of communal institutions and Jewish courts, guaranteed the right to slaughter animals, and promised nondiscriminatory taxation. To be sure, there were other, contradictory, trends in the period, as well. More than fifty towns and cities obtained the right de non tolerandis Judaeis; these, however, were mainly crown towns.38 In some private towns, though, more concessions were made to the interests of the Christian residents than was the case in Opatów.39\n\nThe privilege was not a comprehensive constitution. Not only were the provisions lacking in detail, but a number of areas were ignored entirely. There was no specific reference to the requirement of labor duties from Jews; the possible conflict of interests between the Christian artisans and their guilds and Jews engaged in commercial or artisanal activity was not addressed; nothing was said specifically about ownership of property and its free disposal; there was no explicit reference to the role of Jews, if any, in the election of a municipal government; the subject of the Jews’ freedom to leave the town was not mentioned. Many, if not all, of these issues did indeed arise and were dealt with in various ways, but the privilege provided no guidance on these subjects.\n\nCOMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES\n\nVery little direct evidence about Jews in Opatów during the sixteenth century, or indeed, about Opatów in general, during that period, has been preserved. For the first half of the seventeenth century, the source material available is almost as thin as for the earlier period. Nevertheless, the indications are clear enough to suggest that Opatów was a dynamic town during that period, expanding in terms both of its numbers and its commercial significance. Whatever the precise meaning of the figures reported in the 1578 tax roll, they do suggest that Opatów was the second city in the region after Sandomierz. The residents (oppidi) of Opatów were assessed at 128 florins; those of Sandomierz at 224 florins. Sixteen traders (revenditor) were listed in Opatów, some of whom exported grain to Gdańsk and others of whom frequented the roads to Cracow.40 The tax roll notes, as well, 155 artisans in Sandomierz and 70 in Opatów. The Jews of Sandomierz were assessed at forty florins; those of Opatów at eighty florins, “respectu illorum paupertatis.”\n\nSome of these Jews were, no doubt, also merchants. Indeed, as mentioned earlier, the privilege authorizing the founding of a guild of merchants and retailers in Opatów in 1569 specifically promised the Christians protection against the “wrongdoing and deceit” of their Jewish competitors.41 Moreover, soon after the arrival of Jews in Opatów, market day was moved from Saturday to Sunday.42 At least some of the Jews of Opatów were prosperous enough to employ Christian servants, evoking complaints from the clerics of the town in 1612.43 This prosperity was achieved not only through commercial activity but also through holding arenda contracts (leases obtained from the town owner on various monopolies, most commonly involving the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages) and lending money at interest.\n\nFrom 1574, Opatów was the regular meeting place of the dietine, or regional assembly, of the nobility (sejmik) of the Sandomierz province (województwo).44 And while, to say the least, this sometimes meant there was rather boisterous behavior in the town, particularly among the retinues of the noblemen who attended the meetings, it was also good for business in the inns, the taverns, and the shops. Zbigniew Ossoliński, who attended meetings of the sejmik, recorded in his diary in 1599 that he had contracted debts to two Opatów Jews. He owed Zuzman 145 zloties, 16 groszy, and he owed Abraham the substantial sum of 2,430 zloties.45 Both names appeared in the inventory of 1618.46 And Abraham undoubtedly was the same as “Abraam,” who, together with the Jew Bona, was referred to as an arrendator of Opatów in a receipt for the sale of twenty-five kamień (about 320 kg.) of copper to Joannes Milnarowicz at Lublin in 1615.47 Bona’s name appeared in the 1618 inventory in large dark letters, in contrast to all of the other names on the list. Presumably, this reflected his position as arrendator of the town.\n\nIn 1607, a complaint was filed on behalf of the Jew Wolff Opatoviensis in the district court (gród) of Nowy Sącz. Wolff claimed that he had waited seven weeks to be paid for grain he had sold on credit to Szymon Malak, sometime magistrate (wójt) of Nowy Sącz. No quantities or prices were recorded in the document of complaint.48 Wolff held the lease (arenda) on two mills in Nowy Sącz, together with a partner.49 He was also involved in commerce on a significant scale. In one operation, he sought to sell 700 kamień of plums or prunes at the Lublin fair.50 Wolff’s partner in the contract on the mills in Nowy Sącz was a certain Benedict, a Jew, also from Opatów. The latter was referred to in 1611 as the servant and factor of Janusz Ostrogski.51 There was no reference to a Benedict or Barukh in the 1618 inventory.\n\nSince Cracow was at the center of the larger commercial district of which Opatów was a part, a somewhat clearer picture of the activities of Opatów Jewish merchants can be recovered on the basis of the records of various tolls collected in Cracow during the first half of the seventeenth century. Much of this material has been analyzed by Zenon Guldon and Karol Krzystanek and by Honorata Obuchowska-Pysiowa.52 The data show that, in this period at least, Jewish merchants were very far indeed from dominating the commerce of the region. In 1604, the records of tolls showed that goods worth 782,000 zloties were imported to Cracow by 481 Polish merchants. Of these, only 47 were Jews, and their goods had a total value of about 31,000 zloties. These proportions—less than 1 percent of the merchants and less than 3 percent of the goods by value—contradict, as Guldon has stressed, the opinion of the contemporary publicist Sebastian Miczynski. His book, published in 1618, pictures Jews as controlling foreign trade in Cracow.53 Of those 47 Jewish merchants in 1604, 44 were from Cracow itself, and one each were from Bochnia, Olkusz, and Opatów.\n\nGuldon and Krzystanek sampled the Cracow toll registers (regestry celne) for three periods during the first half of the seventeenth century: 1601–04, 1615–19, and 1641–45. The data show that the total number of entries per year declined rather sharply toward the end of the half-century period. On the other hand, the proportion of the entries representing Jewish merchants grew, rising from 13.5 percent on average between 1601 and 1604, to 24 percent between 1641 and 1645. Thus, the Jewish share of the commerce of the region was expanding substantially, but Jews were still far from playing a dominant role. Similarly, analysis of the Warsaw tolls on goods being shipped by river to Gdańsk between 1605 and 1651 shows that, of 975 merchants mentioned, only 60 (6.2 percent) were Jews.54 Careful examination of these data, however, does show that, while the majority of the 975 merchants (568) was exporting grain, Jews were concentrated in the trade in other goods, notably hides, wax, and textiles.55 Other sources show that, in 1641 alone, 490 Jewish merchants reached Gdańsk. Of these, 38 were from Sandomierz, 3 from Opatów, and 2 from Pińczów.56\n\nIn the Cracow toll records for 1601–4, of the entries representing Jewish merchants from the Sandomierz województwo, the largest portion (24 percent) was from Chęciny, and 13 percent were from Opatów. Still, in this period the most active Jewish merchant was Jakub Nosson of Opatów. His name appeared no less than sixteen times in the toll records of that period. Two of the entries in the list of importers to Cracow in 1604 also record his transactions.57 He exported furs, textiles (especially from the east: Turkish mohair, silk, and Turkish cotton, or bagazja), and hides (particularly chamois, or skóry zamszowe). Jakub Nosson’s operations extended to Lwów as well, where he acquired some of his merchandise. As noted earlier, these goods were characteristic of Jewish merchants of the period. By 1641–45, Pińczów (with 20 percent of the Jewish merchants) had reached the level of Opatów (with 18 percent) and, perhaps, displaced it as the second town after Chęciny. The underrepresentation of Sandomierz Jewish merchants in these records is puzzling during a period when they were quite active in Gdańsk, particularly as exporters of hides.\n\nOn the basis of all the available data, then, it would appear that the Jewish merchants of Opatów occupied a prominent but not preeminent place in relation to the commercial activities in domestic and foreign trade of Jewish merchants of other towns of the region. Chęciny, Sandomierz, and, from about 1615, Pińczów seem to have been even more dynamic centers of Jewish commercial activity in the first half of the seventeenth century. Nevertheless, a pocket calendar for merchants, published in Hebrew in Cracow for the year 1641–42 and listing more than 250 fairs, shows for the Sandomierz region only the fairs in Sandomierz itself (September 9) and Opatów (November 11).58\n\nLEASEHOLDING\n\nIt seems likely that the Jew Wolff Opatoviensis, mentioned above, who sold grain in Nowy Sącz in 1607, obtained it in his capacity as lessee of two mills in Nowy Sącz.59 In Opatów itself, the 1618 inventory listed a certain Lipman who held the contract for the mills in that year. With one other exception, however, the nature of the contracts held by the other Jews referred to in the records of this period as arrendators of Opatów cannot be determined.60\n\nAccording to a contract dated 1640, two Jews, father and son, leased all of the holdings belonging to Władysław Dominik Ostrogski in the Sandomierz area for three years, beginning in 1641, for 25,000 zloties per year.61 The contract was to take effect at the end of the term of the previous lessee, a certain gentryman (szlachcić) called Wiszowiaty. The latter’s administration had evoked numerous complaints.62 Ostrogski’s estates—that is, the Opatów holding (klucz)—included the town of Opatów, the townlets of Denków and Ćmielów, and twenty-three villages. The terms of the contract were not unusual, though one passage is striking. It required Jewish lessees to ensure that the traditional tithes due to the church be paid in accordance with custom and to present receipts at the expiration of their contract, as proof that this had been done. In one version of the contract, the parties were Abraham Jachimowicz (ben Ḥayyim) and his son, Icko (Yiṣḥaq) Abramowicz. In another version, in the same file, the signatories were Icko Abramowicz and Marek Baruchowicz of Lublin.63 Likely, all three were involved in the management of the holding.\n\nCHRISTIAN-JEWISH TENSIONS\n\nContracts such as this, with both Jewish and Christian lessees, were characteristic of the management of the Opatów holding by the Ostrogskis during the first half of the seventeenth century; Jews certainly had no monopoly on the contracts.64 It may be significant, however, that during the year previous to the negotiation of the particular contract just mentioned, that is, in 1639, there were anti-Jewish riots in Opatów, in the course of which the Jewish cemetery was desecrated. The provocation for the incident—Jews carrying on business on Good Friday and selling meat on Easter Sunday—led a local preacher (kanonik kaznodzieja), Szymon Zelowski, to foment the attack. After the event, the Jewish community complained to Bishop Zadzik of Cracow, who ordered Zelowski to a monastery for three months’ meditation.65 It will be recalled that Ostrogski’s privilege of 1633 specifically forbade Christian interference with Jewish commercial rights. One wonders, though, whether the town owner had in mind Jews doing business on the holiest days of the Christian calendar. If they in fact did so, it certainly would have constituted a provocation during a period when the triumphant progress of the counterreformation was in full swing in Poland.\n\nA biproduct of the religious enthusiasm of the period was the spreading of blood libel and host desecration charges against Jews.66 The bishop’s rebuke of the priest-provocateur recalls the dismissal of a blood libel charge in Mińsk by the crown tribunal in 1641.67 That is, there were some grounds for the self-confidence evidenced by Opatów Jewish merchants carrying on their business in normal fashion on Good Friday. Presuming the charge to be true, what must have exercised the priest was the willingness of Christian customers to patronize Jews’ shops and stalls on that day. It should be recalled that canon law, as well as its reflection in the so-called Magdeburg law, forbade Jews to leave their houses or even to open their windows on Good Friday.68 The riot of 1639 must have shaken Jewish self-confidence and could have led Abraham and his son Isaac to seek the arenda contract for the town to increase the security of the Jewish community.\n\nThere was, in Opatów, then, a group of prosperous Jews pursuing commerce and leasing arenda contracts. The existing sources do not provide a basis for any statement about Jewish artisans except for the butchers whose rights were mentioned in the privilege of 1633. The requirement that they pay one hundred zloties per year means there was a substantial number of them, but no precise estimate of that number is possible.\n\nTHE RABBIS OF OPATÓW\n\nThe inventory of 1618 listed the residence of a cantor, a “cantorek,” as well as a house, presumably owned by the community, for the rabbi. The first rabbi of the community whose name has been preserved, Yishaq ben Eliaqim Heilpron, also served as head of the yeshiva.69 According to one scholar, Heilpron came to Opatów in about 1550 to take up his position, but this seems too early in light of the fact that most authorities date his death between 1641 and 1645.70 He was certainly in office in Opatów before 1590; a question of his was included in the responsa of R. Yosef Katz, which were published in that year. Heilpron, described as residing in Opatów, asked Katz about the acceptability of an arrangement made in the ritual bath (miqveh) in Opatów in order to cope with its great depth.71 In an undated question addressed to his teacher, Meʾir Lublin (1550–1616), Heilpron was joined by a certain Bunem, “and the other heads and leaders of the … holy community of Opatów.”72\n\nHeilpron himself wrote at least one book, Sefer qiṣur Abravanel, a condensation of two works by Isaac Abravanel (1437–1508): Naḥalat avot and Zevaḥ pesaḥ. The book received the formal approbation of the Council of the Lands in 1603 and was published in Lublin during the following year.73 In 1604 and 1606, at least, Heilpron himself also attended meetings of the council, in the course of which he joined his signature to the council’s authorization of other books.74 By that time, however, he had very likely taken up a rabbinical post in Lwów. Heilpron’s individual endorsement appeared in at least three other works of the period.75\n\nAmong those who joined the council’s approbation of Heilpron’s book was Moshe ben Avraham of Przemyśl. He was apparently briefly the rabbi of Opatów, where he died in 1605 or 1606. A student of Solomon Luria (1510–74), Moshe was the author of four books.76 He was followed in office by Yisraʾel Isser ben Reʾuven Simḥah Bunem Meisels, a student of Joel Sirkes (1561–1640).77 Perhaps his father was the Bunem referred to in Meʾir Lublin’s responsum mentioned above. According to some sources, Meisels was followed by Eliyahu Ha-Levi Oettingen and then by Eliyahu Kalmankes ben Avraham, who died in Opatów in the spring of 1636.78 Oettingen was definitely rabbi of Węgrów by 1645, when he published Sefer berit ha-levi. Both Eliyahu Kalmankes and his brother, Yosef, were born in Opatów.79\n\nFrom about 1639 until 1650 or 1651, the rabbi of Opatów was Eliʿezer ben Shmuʾel, he-ḥassid, Heilmans, Ish-Ṣevi, Ashkenazi. He usually used two of these four descriptive cognomens. Seven of his approbations are known.80 He himself wrote at least two books: Siaḥ ha-sadeh (Lublin, 1645), and Dameseq eliʿezer al ḥullin (Lublin, 1646). Known as a stringent interpreter of the law, he criticized Joel Sirkes’s encouragement of the acceptance of gifts and the accumulation of wealth by yeshiva heads and advocated, instead, a fixed wage for heads of yeshivas.81\n\nOpatów, then, had a series of distinguished and influential rabbis during the seventy-five years that preceded 1650. Many of them attended meetings of the Council of the Lands and were called upon to grant their imprimatur to rabbinical works published by scholars of the period.\n\nTHE POTOP IN OPATÓW\n\nIn the space of less than ten years, beginning in 1648, the Polish Commonwealth faced five armies: Ukrainian cossacks (accompanied initially by Tatar forces), Russians, Swedes, Brandenburg Prussians, and Transylvanians. All of these campaigns led to loss of life and to destruction of property, in some cases on an enormous scale. At the same time, pestilence accompanied war, and epidemics raged; thousands died in Cracow and Toruń, in Gdańsk and Sandomierz, and elsewhere. Perhaps because of the national and religious character of the war against the Swedes, Polish Christian historical memory has tended to select and to emphasize the six years of the Swedish occupation, 1655–60. These are referred to as the years of the deluge (potop).82\n\nTo be sure, the Swedish invasion touched a much larger proportion of the country than any other incursion. Further, in the national memory, the “miracle” at Jasna Góra at the end of 1655—when that monastery in Częstochowa, housing the shrine of the icon of the black Madonna, resisted a Swedish siege—was what galvanized Polish resistance and unleashed a Polish (Catholic) “crusade” against the (Protestant) Swedes. Some had heard that Charles X boasted to Cromwell that soon not a single papist would be left in Poland. The fact that the Polish aristocracy had learned that the Swedish king, to whom many had shifted their allegiance, proposed to follow an absolutist course and was not disposed to accept the traditional freedoms of the Polish szlachta contributed to their disillusionment with the Swedes and their willingness to resist.\n\nEarlier, when the Swedes invaded with a 40,000-man army, Great Poland had surrendered without a fight (July 25, 1655), as had Warsaw on September 8, 1655. Janusz Radziwiłł, after losing Wilno (Vilna) to the Russians, accepted Swedish protection. The majority of the commonwealth’s army switched its loyalty to Charles x. The king, Jan Kazimierz, fled to Silesia. Stefan Czarniecki, however, after evacuating Cracow on October 19, did not follow the trend and, in the following months, organized a sort of guerrilla resistance against the occupiers.83 Meanwhile, other units of the Polish army regrouped, the king returned to Poland, and the anti-Swedish campaign was launched.\n\nFor Jews, on the contrary, the Ukrainian cossack uprising, led by Bogdan Chmielnicki, and the accompanying massacres of Jews in the southeast were among their most prominent historical memories. These events were referred to as gezeres takh ve-tat (the evil decrees) of 1648–49.84 Indeed, by the spring of 1650, an annual fast day on the twentieth of the Hebrew month of Sivan had been proclaimed by the Council of the Lands, and memorial prayers, eulogies, and other works had begun to appear.85 The murder, assault, and destruction wreaked by the Ukrainian cossacks were followed in their turn by brutal attacks on Jews by invading Russian troops in the northeast in 1654 and 1655 and by the slaughter of Jews in many communities in the western and central regions by Czarniecki’s irregulars in 1655–57.\n\nIn the midseventeenth century, the region with the largest number of Jews was precisely the one most affected by Ukrainian forces. And those attacks had the traumatic impact of a sudden and unexpected disaster.86 A number of works were composed in memory of the martyrs of 1648–49, but only one short book, devoted mainly to geszeres takh ve-tat, also memorialized the martyrs of the 1650s. Written by Shmu’el Feivish ben Nathan Feidel of Vienna, and entitled, Tit ha-yeven, it clearly identified Czarniecki as an enemy and attacker of the Jews.87 In prayers recited in Sandomierz, Cracow, and Pińczów in memory of those Jews who were murdered in 1656, the name of the attacker was not recalled.88 Perhaps because in the eyes of their Catholic neighbors Czarniecki was a national hero, Jews chose to deemphasize the massacres of 1656 and 1657.89\n\nMany Jewish communities in Great Poland were attacked by Czarniecki’s troops. The pretext for the slaughter of Jews, and of Protestants, was the contention that they had collaborated with the Lutheran Swedes. By the end of January 1656, Czarniecki had moved east into Little Poland and had reached Sandomierz.90 The large Swedish camp was just across the Vistula when Czarniecki and his forces entered the town, which had been virtually destroyed when it was captured from the Swedes by other Polish units.91 Here too, the Polish forces were convinced that Jews were guilty of collaboration and that, as a contemporary noted, when it came to “robbing manors and churches, they were not only helpers but were the driving force.”92 This passage demonstrates, as Israel Halpern has pointed out, that the oft-repeated contention that a force of several hundred young Jews fought alongside the Polish Christian soldiers at Sandomierz is baseless and derives from a misreading of Pufendorf’s biography of the Swedish king.93 In the minute book of the Sandomierz synagogue there were special memorial prayers for Jews murdered at this time (March–April 1656), and it is virtually certain that the culprits were Polish, not Swedish troops.94\n\nIndeed, Opatów itself was mentioned in Tit ha-yeven. In a passage listing communities where Jews were murdered by the forces of Czarniecki, the author wrote, “he came to the holy community of Opatów where there were two hundred householders, great and wealthy, and almost all were killed in a single abomination.”95 Since it is known that Czarniecki was indeed in Opatów in February 1656, and in view of the evidence regarding nearby Sandomierz, there seems little reason to doubt that Czarniecki’s or other Polish units attacked and murdered Jews in Opatów during the first months of 1656.\n\nThe occasion for Czarniecki’s presence in Opatów was the sejmik’s call to the region to rally to the support of the newly returned Polish king.96 As in Sandomierz, Jews were doubtless accused of treason. In the new enthusiasm of the anti-Swedish campaign among the young men preparing themselves for battle, this would have led to brutality, robbery, rape, and murder. In April 1656, the king, Jan Kazimierz, still apparently unaffected by accusations of disloyalty against the Jews, ordered his army commander to protect the Jewish population.97 During the following year, again in the spring, Czarniecki’s troops and other Polish units were in the vicinity of Opatów once more, as was Rakoczy.98 According to one (undocumented) history, it was the latter’s troops which, on their way to Warsaw, plundered Opatów.99 By this time (March 1657), the monarch was either convinced of Jewish treachery or determined to use the accusation for his own ends. He ordered the Jews of Poland to pay 100,000 zloties against future taxes immediately, on pain of expulsion.100 It would seem that the Jews faced, at least momentarily, the same fate as the Arian Protestants who were indeed expelled from Poland in the following year.\n\nThe memorial prayer recorded in the minute book of the synagogue in Pińczów refers to Jewish martyrs of this time in the following towns in the Sandomierz województwo: Chęciny, Zwoleń, Sandomierz, Opatów, Tarłów, Klimontów, Pińczów, Raków, and Chmielnik. The memorial prayer recited in Cracow, which refers to the year 1656, mentions Wiśnicz, Sandomierz, Opatów, Chęciny and Tarłów.101 According to Tit ha-yeven, there were massacres in Chęciny, Opatów, and Chmielnik. The chronicler also indicates that the Jews of Raków, Szydłów, and Wodzisław fled to Pińczów. There, according to a doubtful reading of a very corrupt text, “there were about 1,000 householders, who nevertheless benefited from the charity of their duke, called Margrave, like … [unclear] … and he … [unclear] … with Jews with great strength.”102\n\nIn other words, it seems the Jews of Pińczów, together with refugees from neighboring towns, were protected by the town owner against attacks by marauding troops. Perhaps the chronicle refers to events in 1656, while the memorial prayer of the synagogue of Pińczów includes victims of 1657 as well.\n\nNot only was Opatów likely devastated by troops at least twice in two years, but it did not escape the widespread epidemics of the 1650s, either. Indeed, the Sandomierz sejmik failed to meet in Opatów only once during more than 200 years. This was in 1652, when, because the plague was particularly virulent, the szlachta were forced to convene elsewhere.103 At about this time also, the Jews of Opatów had to face an accusation of beating a Christian girl, but this episode will be taken up below.\n\nThere are no sources by which to estimate the precise extent of the damage to Opatów and to Opatów’s Jews during the period of the potop. In the region and in Małopolska in general, the losses were devastating, with often 30 or even 50 percent of the population and even larger proportions of property being lost.104 The royal survey carried out in the Sandomierz województwo in 1660 reflects the extent of the damage, at least in the crown towns. In almost every case in which the number of houses recorded was listed together with the number in 1629, the loss exceeded 50 percent.105 It would be unjustified, however, in the absence of more concrete evidence, to assume that the town of Opatów was affected in the same measure. Indeed, one rather flimsy bit of information bearing directly on Opatów seems to indicate that the town was not badly damaged during 1656 and 1657.\n\nA tax summary (regestr czynszów), dated December 14, 1657, lists the property taxes and the annual payments of the barber-surgeons and the butchers to the town owner.106 The document is poorly preserved, and the figure next to the entry “capitation tax from Jews” has become unreadable. A comparison of the legible figures, however, with the parallel categories in 1618, shows only a small decline in the property tax figures from almost 55 zloties to about 48½ zloties.107 The payments of the butchers and the barber-surgeons were the same in both years. The comparison, however, is rendered virtually meaningless once the violent inflation, particularly of the five years or so following 1618, is taken into account. During the first half of the seventeenth century, salaries roughly doubled, while the Polish coin lost about two-thirds of its value. Only one item, in fact, can be salvaged for comparison. In both 1618 and 1657, the butchers had to make a payment representing twenty “stalls.” In other words, none of these stalls, it would seem, was destroyed in the intervening period. This would indicate, as well, that neither the number of butchers nor the demand for meat had diminished. On the other hand, what might be called the conservative tendency of the chancellery may account for the perpetuation of certain entries in the records even when they did not necessarily correspond to reality. This one datum is an insufficient basis for determining the impact of the potop on Opatów.\n\nThe only other reference to this period, from Opatów itself, is an entry from the minute book of the Jewish Burial Society in September 1662. It notes the great destruction around the graves of the “martyrs” (qedoshim) of the community and that all four walls of the cemetery had been burned and smashed. “Every passerby is shocked,” and the society resolved to build new walls around all of the graves.108 Finally, the national tax roll reported 172 houses in Opatów in 1662. This was slightly less than half of the number listed in the 1618 inventory of the town. Even if allowance is made for underreporting and evasion, the disparity in the two figures nonetheless indicates substantial loss of property, which occurred, more than likely, in 1656 or 1657.\n\nTHE SECOND HALF OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY\n\nContemporary research continues to modify the conventional notion that the second half of the seventeenth century was a period of unremitting economic regression, and that, in particular, the money-goods economy was abandoned, leading to the collapse of the cities.109 The picture turns out to be much more varied than the undifferentiated decline depicted in earlier historiography. Older trading centers such as Gniezno, Poznań, Lublin, and to a somewhat lesser extent, Cracow, did lose much of their importance. Other regions and towns, however, experienced expansion at precisely the same time, most notably, of course, Warsaw, but also private towns such as Zamość, Pińczów, Łuck, and Szkłow. Indeed, a number of Belorussian-Lithuanian centers fairly boomed during this period.110 In this period, as well, Jews became more prominent in certain areas of Polish commerce, notably the overland trade with the west, as well as domestic trade.111 In general, however, the period between the potop and the Northern War at the beginning of the eighteenth century is probably the most obscure in the history of early modern Poland, mainly, one surmises, because it is the least documented.112\n\nCertainly, in the case of Opatów, the source material is rather thin. There were, nevertheless, indications of vitality and expansion on the Jewish side of the town sufficient to warrant the conclusion that the community recovered quickly from the blows it suffered during the sixth decade. The sources, however, are too scanty to enable a precise reconstruction of that recovery.113 It does seem that, while Sandomierz was one of those towns that never regained their former vitality after the potop, Pińczów developed at a pace even more rapid than Opatów’s and assumed a position that would put it well ahead of Opatów in size and commercial prominence in the eighteenth century. By 1672, the elders of the Jewish community of Pińczów were empowered by the Council of the Lands to limit settlement. The movement of so many outsiders into the town, they had complained—no doubt with some hyperbole—was impoverishing the community’s resident members.114\n\nOne index of comparison between Pińczów and Opatów is the greater participation of Jewish merchants from the former town in international trade, particularly through Breslau. There are figures for Polish Jewish “Breslauer Messgäste” for the seven years between 1651 and 1702. The total number from Pińczów was eighteen, while the total from Opatów was only four.115 Breslau, in this period, was preferred to Leipzig by Jewish merchants because of the discriminatory fees demanded of Jews visiting the Leipzig fairs.116 It is true, though, that the Leipzig figures for the same period were three from Pińczów and four from Opatów.117 Also, some Opatów Jews may have been involved in trade with Ukrainian and Lithuanian-Belorussian areas. It would seem that the level of their international commercial activity at this time was rather limited.\n\nA similar picture emerges from an examination of the korobka—or commercial tax regulations—of 1665. The korobka was a Jewish communal assessment on commercial profits or income imposed on most Polish-Lithuanian communities during the second half of the seventeenth or the early eighteenth centuries.118 Some of the Opatów regulations were published by Majer Bałaban on the basis of the communal minute book in 1912.119 The rate of taxation was generally less than 1 percent; the profits of artisans, arrendators, and cloth merchants, however, were taxed at a somewhat higher rate.120 The list of goods mentioned was rather short. It included tallow and soap, wax and cloth (sukno), as well as wine, mead, vodka, and anise, which was used mainly to flavor vodka. The comestibles mentioned were cows, bulls, calves and lambs, salted fish, herring, oats, wheat, and salt. The most elaborate entry gives the rates on six different types of hides (ox, cow, sheep, calf, lamb, and goat). This last is not surprising, since at least the small-scale trade in hides was dominated by Jews in this period.121\n\nEvidence of Opatów’s growing prominence was the appearance in the town of members of some of the most distinguished families of the Polish-Lithuanian Jewish “aristocracy.” One of these was Isaac Ḥarif (Yiṣḥaq ben Binyamin Zeʾev Wolf) of Krotoszyn. His grandfather had been rabbi of Poznań, his father, rabbi of Krotoszyn. Isaac was married to the daughter of the wealthy Nahum of Sandomierz.122 His first rabbinical post was in Chęciny, and he took up the position of av beit din (chief judge or rabbi) in Opatów in about 1668. He remained there for six (or nine) years, after which he moved to take up the even more prestigious office of av beit din and head of the yeshiva of Cracow and the district. He died in Cracow in 1682. The previous year he had been appointed factor of the Polish king,123 indicating that Isaac was not only a rabbi but a merchant of considerable wealth and prominence. In this context, it is noteworthy that he had been replaced as head of the yeshiva in Cracow in 1680. One of Isaac’s daughters married Yeḥezqel ben Binyamin Wolf Landau (died c1686), the son of another aristocratic Jewish family, the head of the yeshiva, a judge of the Opatów community, and active in commerce. He appeared at the Leipzig fair in 1680; and in 1683, with two partners, he leased the korobka from the kahal.124 The Landau family would later have a decisive impact on the Jewish community in Opatów and on East European Jewry in general.125\n\nThere is some information as well about four other leaders of the Opatów community during the last decades of the seventeenth century. Leybusz Jozephowicz (Yehuda? Leib ben Yosef) was a brewer and distiller. In 1670, he held the license for the distilling of liquor in the town, and the following year he obtained a writ from Alexander Janusz Ostrogski permitting him to acquire property for the construction of a brewery and malthouse in Opatów. According to the document, he was to enjoy the right to brew beer and malt for all time.126 He must have been a kahal elder, because it was he, together with Mendel Jozephowicz, who deposited the privilege of the community for official registration (oblation) at the Sandomierz district court (gród) in 1689.127\n\nMendel Jozephowicz (or Aharon Menaḥem Mendel, died 1706) was an elder both of the community and of the galil, or district.128 He also participated in at least two meetings of the Council of the Lands, in 1688 and in 1692.129 Mendel was praised for his kindness in a book called Avaq soferim by Avraham Qonqi, who was an emissary in Europe seeking donations for the Jews of the Holy Land. Qonqui also quoted a novel interpretation of a verse in scripture he had heard from the “beloved and faithful” Mendel of Opatów.130 Mendel Jozephowicz was a textile merchant dealing mainly in expensive, luxury fabrics.131 Of the two other elders of the community at this time about whom some information has been preserved, one (Hayyim) was an arrendator and brewer, and the other was a wealthy textile merchant. The latter, Yiṣḥaq ben Avraham (Icko Abrahamowicz), attended the Leipzig fairs in 1697, 1698, and 1701. On his death around 1707, the value of his inventory exceeded 12,000 zloties.132\n\nThe composite picture of the leaders of the community at the end of the seventeenth century that emerges, then, is of both merchants and arrendators taking virtually equally prominent roles. It would be very surprising indeed to find an artisan in a leadership position, even though artisanry was the occupation of a significant proportion of the population.\n\nAlthough the available sources are almost entirely silent on the subject of Jewish artisans during this period, one development that affected them is known. After his marriage to Teofila Ludwika, sister of Aleksander Janusz Ostrogski, Dimitr Jerzy Korybut Wiśniowiecki took over the administration of Opatów. This occurred sometime during the 1670s and by 1678, Wiśniowiecki had issued a new “constitution” (prawa miasta) for the town. Unfortunately, the text has not been preserved. From references to certain artisan guild charters issued by Wiśniowiecki, it is clear that he envisioned both Jewish and Christian membership in the town’s artisan guilds.133 It is not known whether or not this was an innovation. At one point, with reference to the guild of storekeepers and hosiers, it was said that Jewish salt dealers were “obliged to belong to the guild as of old.”134 Whether it began earlier or was a result of Wiśniowiecki’s reform, the policy persisted into the eighteenth century.135 The degree to which Jews complied with the regulation is not clear, since in 1708 there were complaints that Jews had not joined one of the guilds (paśniczy, the guild of leather belt makers).136 The response to this complaint by the town owner’s commissioners noted a privilege granted this guild by Wiśniowiecki in 1678, requiring that everyone pursuing this trade belong to the guild. They demanded, therefore, that Jews who wished to carry on their occupation and who had not yet joined the guild, do so within four weeks.\n\nThe privileges chartering these guilds took account of the Jews’ inability to participate in the special liturgies and other church-related activities of the guild (iż nie mogą kościelny [!] służby odbywać). On the other hand, each Jewish member of the guild of shopkeepers and hosiers, for example, was expected to provide funds equal to the value of the wax for candles, which the Christian members of the guild gave on Corpus Christi and during Lent.137 In this way, the Jewish members avoided contributing directly to the facilitation of Christian worship. Nevertheless, the guilds obviously retained their Christian character in this period, which may partially explain the Jews’ apparent reluctance to join them. The town owner’s concern to reduce competition clashed, in this instance, with Jewish values and material interests.\n\nAnother contradiction between interests and values—but this within the Jewish community—was a consequence of the growing Jewish settlement in Opatów. During the summer of 1687, the Council of the Lands took note of the “great and bitter” complaint of the leaders of the Jewish community of Opatów to the effect that “many people were coming to live and to settle there, and burdening the community.”138 This had evoked “much complaint and perniciousness from the evil place” (ha-maqom ha-rashʿa), that is, from the Christian municipal authorities.139 And further, there were frequent excesses on the part of those who gathered in Opatów regularly for meetings of the sejmiki. This was well known, and the Opatów leaders had “gone on at great length” on the subject. Seeing justice in the communal leaders’ demand, the elders of the council acceded to it. They decreed that no one was permitted to live or to settle in Opatów without the communal leaders’ consent and empowered the elders to expel those who settled without permission. Indeed, Opatów was granted status and authority in this sphere matching that of the four leading communities (presumably, Cracow, Poznań, Lwów, and Lublin) of the Four Lands. “Moreover, it is well known that this community has but one street, and its borders cannot be expanded.” For all these reasons, and “lest the natives be cast down and the strangers rise higher to the heavens,”140 the elders of the Council of the Lands saw fit “to double and to triple” communal leaders’ authority in the matter of settlement.\n\nThis edict of the Council of the Lands could not have been intended to grant the communal leaders to Opatów control of the right of settlement in their community. The Opatów kahal had had the power to bestow or remove the right of settlement for at least two decades before 1687. The communal minute book recorded in 1670 a list of sixteen men to whom the right of settlement was not to be granted without the approval of two-thirds of the elders of the community. And, a number of similar, if less sweeping, actions of this sort were taken by the communal elders before 1687.141 The action by the council was intended to raise the status of the community from one with merely the right to limit settlement to that of “one of the four leading communities.” The precise meaning of this change, however, is not known.\n\nThe elevation of the status of Opatów very likely did not mean that local elders could admit or expel a Jew not only to or from Opatów but also to or from its daughter communities. At least one community, in the town of Tarłów, had been subject to Opatów’s authority since at least 1665.142 However, a communal decision taken in 1695 to remove the right of residence of a certain Shelomoh ben David excluded him also from “our region” (galil) and “the communities subject to our authority.”143 Of the materials preserved from the communal minute book and related to the removal of the right of settlement, this was the earliest extension of the territorial scope of the ban to include the daughter communities. So it is possible that the change in Opatów’s status extending its control over its region included matters of settlement.144\n\nThe reference to the violence at meetings of the sejmiki in Opatów, although obscure, seems to point to the fact that the larger and more visible the community, the greater the dangers it faced. Violence and brawls were a regular feature of those regional gatherings, or dietines, of the gentry (szlachta). Wealthy gentrymen traveled with large and often boisterous retinues. Jewish communities in places where such gatherings occurred took various steps to protect themselves. Jews in Lublin, for example, made routine gifts to the marshall of the crown tribunal and held a fast day regularly during its sessions.145"
