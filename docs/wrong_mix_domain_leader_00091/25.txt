Introduction

This 21th issue pays special attention to Willem Drees (1886-1988), the post-ww II Dutch prime minister, whose name has become synonymous with social security for the elderly in the Netherlands.

Piet Hagen, the author of a recently published biography of another great Labour leader, Pieter Jelles Troelstra (1860-1930), interviewed two of Drees’s biographers, Hans Daalder and Jelle Gaemers.

In addition, readers will find the usual presentation of new accessions, made slightly less usual because of the Institute’s 75th anniversary at the end of this year. During the General Friends' Meeting on 24 June 2010 (of which a report will be published in the next issue) it was announced that Ger Verrips has stepped down as member of the Board of the Friends. He has served as member of the Board from its inception in 2001. The Friends thank him for his many efforts over the years on their behalf. Wim Berkelaar is welcomed as new member of the Board.
