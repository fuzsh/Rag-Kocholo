A two-year suspended sentence for attempting to rig a 2012 referendum to impeach the president barred him from becoming prime minister after his party won the most votes in parliamentary elections in 2016, but he was considered the most powerful politician in the country. In 2018 he was sentenced to 3½ years in prison in a case involving fake public jobs for party workers; his appeal was rejected in 2019.\n\nDrago, Luis María (b.

After running unsuccessfully for the Canadian parliament and the Quebec National Assembly, he found his niche in Montreal civic politics. He acted as the prosecutor for the Caron Inquiry into Montreal civic corruption (1949-50) and in 1954 was elected mayor. Defeated in the 1957 election, he formed the Parti Civique de Montréal to serve as his political vehicle, and in 1960 he was returned to office. He was known as a showman, a master of circumlocution and charm, and a manager with iron determination. He believed that the populace drafted a leader and entrusted the fate of the city to him. His Parti Civique admitted no members besides its city councillors and never had a stated platform. All major plans for Montreal were made by the mayor in consultation with six members of the City Council executive committee and presented to the council for rubber-stamp approval. He created underground shopping plazas, a subway system, an art centre, and the Olympic Stadium. In 1969 he brought major league baseball to Montreal with the Montreal Expos, but his two most grandiose achievements were the 1967 world's fair, Expo 67, and the 1976 Summer Olympics. In 1965 he received an award from the trade and industry departments of the Canadian provinces for contributing most to industrial development in Canada. In 1967 he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada, and in 1984, a Commander of the French Legion of Honour. When he announced that he would not run for a ninth term in 1986, he made it clear that this was not his choice but a concession to his health problems. He lived four years in Paris as Canada's ambassador to UNESCO (until 1991).\n\nDraper, Eben(ezer) S(umner) (b. June 17, 1858, Hopedale, Mass. - d. April 9, 1914, Greenville, S.C.), governor of Massachusetts (1909-11); brother of William F. Draper.\n\nG. Draper\n\nDraper, Gordon (Michael) (b. 1949, Arima, Trinidad - d. Aug. 12, 2004, London, England), foreign minister of Trinidad and Tobago (1995). He was also minister of public administration and information (1991-95).\n\nW. Draper\n\nDraper, William (Henry) (b. March 11, 1801, near London, England - d. Nov. 3, 1877, Yorkville [now part of Toronto]), joint premier of Canada (1841-42, 1843-47). He came to Canada in 1820. From 1836 to 1840 he represented Toronto in the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada and he was appointed a member of the Executive Council of the province in 1836. He served as aide-de-camp to Sir Francis Bond Head, the lieutenant governor, during the rebellion of 1837. The same year he was appointed solicitor-general for the province, and in 1840, attorney-general. In 1841, as Conservative leader, he was chosen as joint premier of Canada, along with Reform Party leader Robert Baldwin. Baldwin abandoned his post after less than a year in power, but Draper continued to serve until his party was voted out of favour in 1842. He regained his position in 1843, serving jointly with Denis Benjamin Viger (1843-46) and Louis-Joseph Papineau (1846-47). He was a persuasive speaker, earning the sobriquet of \"Sweet William.\" The stresses of governing with a small majority led to his resignation from politics in 1847. From then on he held a succession of judicial posts: puisne judge of the Court of Queen's Bench in Upper Canada (1847-56), chief justice of the Common Pleas (1856-63), chief justice of Upper Canada (1863-69), and president of the Court of Error and Appeal (1869-77).\n\nDraper, William F(ranklin) (b. April 9, 1842, Lowell, Mass. - d. Jan. 28, 1910, Washington, D.C.), U.S. diplomat. He was ambassador to Italy (1897-1900).\n\nDraskovic\n\nDraskovic, Vuk (b. Nov. 29, 1946, Medja, Banat region, Vojvodina, Serbia, Yugoslavia), Yugoslav politician. Expelled from the Communist party in 1982, he rose to prominence by espousing Serbian nationalism and in 1990 founded the Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO). He became the most prominent opposition figure for much of the 1990s. When Pres. Slobodan Milosevic brought him on board as deputy prime minister in January 1999, he gave the government a more pro-Western voice, counterbalancing the ultranationalism of the Radical Party leader and Serbian deputy prime minister, Vojislav Seselj. On April 28, 1999, Draskovic, who vowed when he joined the government to reform it from within, was back in opposition - he was relieved of all duties a day after calling for an international peace force for Kosovo under UN control. Draskovic, who had co-led huge street protests against Milosevic two years earlier, was always a maverick figure. He continued to insist he was in opposition to Milosevic throughout his time as a deputy prime minister. At the same time, he opposed the NATO attacks against Yugoslavia and even after his dismissal he said Serbs were united. For a long time many Serbs saw Draskovic as the most charismatic and important opposition figure to Milosevic. He claimed the SPO was the largest opposition party in Serbia. However, he was widely perceived to have made several disastrous tactical mistakes and in elections following Milosevic's overthrow in 2000 his party failed to overcome the 5% barrier needed to gain representation in parliament. Analysts saw his main blunders as his decision to keep his party outside the Democratic Opposition of Serbia alliance and earlier to have accepted the government post offered by Milosevic. His party returned to parliament in 2003, however, and joined the government. He was foreign minister of Serbia and Montenegro from 2004 until the end of the union in 2006, then foreign minister of Serbia until 2007.\n\nDraskovics, Tibor (b. June 26, 1955, Budapest, Hungary), finance minister (2004-05) and justice minister (2008-09) of Hungary.\n\nDraugelis, Eliziejus (b. April 11, 1888, Bardauskai, Russia [now in Lithuania] - d. Oct. 8, 1981, São Paulo, Brazil), interior minister of Lithuania (1919-20). He was also mayor of Marijampole (1918-19).\n\nDrayton, Edward Rawle (b. April 2, 1859 - d. May 31, 1927), administrator of Grenada (1892-1914), Saint Vincent (acting, 1900-01), and Dominica (1914-15).\n\nDrayton, Sir Henry (Lumley) (b. April 27, 1869, Kingston, Ont. - d. Aug. 28, 1950, Muskoka, Ont.), finance minister of Canada (1919-21 and [acting] 1926); knighted 1915. He was also acting secretary of state (1921), acting minister of railways and canals (1926), and minister without portfolio and acting minister of immigration and colonization (1926).\n\nDrayton, John (b. June 22, 1766, \"Drayton Hall,\" near Charles Town [now Charleston], South Carolina - d. Nov. 27, 1822, Charleston), governor of South Carolina (1800-02, 1808-10).\n\nDrecun, Predrag (b. Aug. 18, 1960, Cetinje, Montenegro), a deputy prime minister of Montenegro (1998). He was also minister of labour and social care (1998-2000).\n\nDrees\n\nDrees, Willem (b. July 5, 1886, Amsterdam, Netherlands - d. May 14, 1988, The Hague), prime minister of the Netherlands (1948-58). He joined the Social Democratic (later Labour) Party at the age of 18. He served on the city council in The Hague from 1913 and in 1933 was elected to the Second (principal) Chamber of the States-General. During World War II he was arrested for anti-German activities and was briefly interned (1940-41) in the Buchenwald concentration camp; he joined the resistance movement after his release. As minister of social affairs (1945-48) and then as prime minister, Drees introduced such social welfare programs as old-age pensions, unemployment compensation, and national health care. In 1948 he sent troops to the Netherlands East Indies, which had declared its independence in 1945, in order to reestablish Dutch sovereignty. The action was widely supported in the Netherlands, but it attracted international condemnation, and in 1949 Drees reluctantly acknowledged the independence of Indonesia. During his tenure, the Caribbean Dutch possessions of Suriname and the Netherlands Antilles also moved toward self-government. Under his leadership the Netherlands joined both NATO and the European Economic Community. He retired in 1958 after the coalition he headed broke apart in a dispute over proposed tax increases. In 1971 he denounced the increasingly leftist Labour policies and resigned from the party. The issue of whether to deploy NATO cruise missiles on Dutch soil marked his final public clash with his successors in the Labour Party. Drees sharply criticized the Labour leadership for its unconditional opposition to deployment.\n\nDrees, Willem, Jr., byname Wim Drees (b. Dec. 24, 1922, The Hague, Netherlands - d. Sept. 5, 1998, The Hague), Dutch politician; son of Willem Drees. He was minister of transport and water management (1971-72).\n\nDreifuss\n\nDreifuss, Ruth (b. Jan. 9, 1940, Sankt Gallen, Switzerland), president of Switzerland (1999). When Dreifuss, a member of the left-of-centre Social Democrats, joined the cabinet as interior minister in 1993, she became its first Jewish member, and she was only the second female cabinet member in Switzerland, which gave women the right to vote on the federal level only in 1971. Radical Democrat Elisabeth Kopp, the first female to join the cabinet in 1984, resigned in 1989 after being accused of violating the official secrets act. On Dec. 9, 1998, Dreifuss was elected as Switzerland's first female president. But she said she refused to be a fig-leaf for a male-dominated government. \"I won't be satisfied if I'm the last woman [president] for decades. I'm just opening the door for other women,\" she said. On Sept. 30, 2002, she announced her resignation as interior minister for the end of the year.\n\nDrenteln, Aleksandr (Romanovich) (b. March 19 [March 7, O.S.], 1820, Kiev, Russia [now in Ukraine] - d. July 27 [July 15, O.S.], 1888, Kiev), governor-general of Kiev, Podolia, and Volyn (1881-88). He was also Russian chief of gendarmes (1878-80).\n\nDreunimisimisi, Ratu Viliame (Foukimoana) (b. June 7, 1937, Mualevu, Lau, Fiji - d. June 18, 2000, Lautoka, Fiji), Fijian politician; son of Ratu Sir Edward Cakobau. He was minister of tourism (1992-93) and agriculture (1993-94).\n\nDrew, Francis Greville (b. Sept. 16, 1892 - d. Jan. 17, 1962), chief administrator of Eritrea (1946-51).\n\nG.A. Drew\n\nDrew, George Alexander (b. May 7, 1894, Guelph, Ont. - d. Jan. 4, 1973, Toronto, Ont.), Canadian politician.

Feb. 23, 2008, Zaplana, Slovenia), prime minister (1992-2000, 2000-02) and president (2002-07) of Slovenia. He was elected to the Slovenian parliament in 1986 and became Slovenia's representative on Yugoslavia's collective presidency in May 1989, immediately taking up its rotating chairmanship for a year. By this time the old Communist system was crumbling, and Drnovsek called upon the parliament to allow multiparty elections, release all political prisoners, and adopt a Western-style free-market economy. Such reforms only hastened the onset of ethnic nationalism, and Yugoslavia disintegrated in a deluge of secessionism and civil war. In October 1990 he withdrew from the presidency in protest at its manipulation by Serbia. A founding member in November 1990 of the centre-left Liberal Democratic Party (LDS; from 1994 Liberal Democracy of Slovenia), he helped secure independence for Slovenia in 1991, acting as Slovenia's main negotiator in the independence talks with the Yugoslav army. When Prime Minister Lojze Peterle lost a vote of confidence in 1992, Drnovsek advanced to succeed him. He methodically pursued a reform agenda, building a competitive market economy and commencing membership talks with the European Union. Described as singularly uncharismatic, he called himself \"not very ideological,\" adding: \"People demanded vision. I hate vision. The cemetery of history is full of visionaries.\" He briefly lost office in 2000 when general elections gave a majority to centre-right parties. However, the coalition quickly broke down and fresh elections returned the centre-left coalition parties to power. In 2002 he successfully ran for president and thereafter laid down the chairmanship of the LDS he held since 1992. His presidency was marked by a major personal transformation caused by recurrent cancer. In 2006 he left the LDS and established the non-political, altruistic Movement for Justice and Development. He boycotted state occasions, disappeared for weeks at a time, and talked like a New Age mystic of his quest for \"higher consciousness\" and \"inner balance.\"\n\nDrobnjak, Vladimir (b.

March 6, 1865, Hefei, Anhui, China - d. Nov. 2, 1936, Shanghai, China), governor of Hubei (1911), acting military governor of Hubei (1913-14) and Henan (1914), and army minister (1912-15, 1916-17, 1917), acting premier (1913), secretary of state (1916), premier (1916-17, 1917, 1918), and provisional chief executive (1924-26) of China. He served in the Beiyang Army, whose commander was Yuan Shikai. During Yuan's presidential term, Duan's post as army minister allowed him to gain great prestige and influence in the military field. After Yuan died in 1916, Duan (nicknamed \"the Tiger\") started to control the government, with the assistance of governors and generals. In 1917, the government started to decide whether to join World War I; Duan preferred to take part on the Allied side, as his protector Japan wished to gain control over the Chinese forces via the war. However, Pres. Li Yuanhong, backed by the U.K. and U.S. who feared such an attempt by Japan and tried to maintain their interests in China, insisted on remaining neutral. Duan then organized a \"coalition of military governors,\" led by Anhui governor Ni Sichong, which vowed to join the war. Later Li sacked Duan as premier and Duan called Gen. Zhang Xun, who was stationed in Xuzhou, Jiangsu, to mediate the dispute. Zhang Xun thought the opportunity for restoration finally came, so he led his \"Pigtail Army\" all the way to Beijing, expelled Li from office, and restored the Great Qing Empire (July 1). Duan recovered Beijing on July 12; considered a hero, he became premier again, and the president became his puppet. Duan kept receiving support from Japan, which offered him endless loans to improve his army, but despite that, he suffered a great defeat in the civil war against the Zhili Military Group led by Cao Kun and Wu Peifu in 1920. After Feng Yuxiang launched the Beijing Coup of 1924, detained Pres. Cao Kun, and dissolved parliament, Duan was invited to become head of state. He was expelled in 1926 as Zhang Zuolin gained control over the outskirts of Beijing. In 1935, Chiang Kai-shek nominated him as a councillor of the national government.\n\nDuan Zhigui\n\nDuan Zhigui (b. 1869, Hefei, Anhui, China - d. March 12, 1925, Tianjin, China), governor of Chahar (1912-13), military governor of Hubei (1914-15), and military and civil governor of Fengtian (1915-16). Nicknamed \"Adopted Prince\" (of Yuan Shikai), he was a general and Yuan's everlasting military supporter. He had gained the post of Heilongjiang governor in the late Qing dynasty. After Duan Qirui, his fellow townsman, gained domination over the Beijing government in 1917, he was appointed army minister and commander of the guard of the capital city. Upon the fall of Duan Qirui's armed forces in 1920, he fled to the Japanese embassy. He was remitted in 1922 and from then on stayed in Tianjin.\n\nDuane, William J(ohn) (b.

He helped to found the Christian Democratic Party in the 1960s. In 1964 he was elected to the first of three successive two-year terms as mayor of San Salvador, and his administration was instrumental in building new schools and providing such basic services as street lighting, sewerage systems, and trash collection. He ran for president in 1972; when his election seemed likely the military halted the election and declared Col. Arturo Molina the winner. Following a radio broadcast supporting a coup, Duarte was arrested by the army; three of his fingertips were cut off, and his face was beaten so severely with rifle butts that his right cheekbone was crushed and he nearly lost an eye. He was sent into exile and spent more than seven years in Venezuela. He returned in 1980, amid civil war, to join a military-civilian junta and became its president; he could not halt the brutal repression by the army and police that resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people. The idealistic Duarte, when criticized for presiding over this reign of terror, replied that the actions would be worse without his presence. He was forced to resign in May 1982 following a shift of the balance of power to the right but he was elected president in May 1984 over Roberto D'Aubuisson, a right-wing extremist, and became the country's first democratically elected president in over half a century. He attempted to stabilize the economy and end the war, helped by massive aid from the United States. But his attempts to distribute land to the peasants and to end the activity of leftist rebels and right-wing death squads were failures.\n\nDuarte, Juan Pablo (b. Jan. 26, 1813, Santo Domingo, Santo Domingo [now Dominican Republic] - d. July 15, 1876, Caracas, Venezuela), Dominican Republic independence leader. He became determined to free the eastern part of Hispaniola from Haitian domination. In 1838, Duarte and two others, Francisco de Rosario Sánchez and Ramón Mella, formed La Trinitaria, a secret society whose goal was independence. The first attempt to oust the Haitians in 1843 collapsed, and he fled the country; but he returned in February 1844, when his followers succeeded in overthrowing the Haitians and the Dominican Republic proclaimed its independence. His idealism soon alienated him from the more militaristic leaders, however, and power fell to a local caudillo (military dictator), Pedro Santana. The defeated Duarte was exiled and, after a brief stay in Germany, took up residence in Caracas, Venezuela. He left Caracas for his homeland only once, during the War of Restoration (1864) against Spain; once more unable to participate in the provisional government, he was sent on a diplomatic mission for one year.\n\nDuarte, Manoel José (b.

During World War II he took part in the underground resistance to Nazi occupation and after the war he rose through the Communist Party ranks, becoming in 1963 a full member of the Central Committee's Presidium and first secretary of the Slovak party. At a Central Committee meeting of October 1967 he rallied the support of reformers against the leadership of Antonín Novotný, who was forced to resign as first secretary on Jan. 5, 1968. Dubcek replaced him and almost immediately began to loosen the stringent control that had defined Communist political life in Eastern Europe. In April a reform program called \"Czechoslovakia's Road to Socialism\" was promulgated that envisaged economic reforms and wide-ranging democratization. The Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies invaded the country on August 21, and Dubcek and five other Presidium members were seized and taken to Moscow. On his return to Prague Dubcek gave an emotional address to his countrymen, requesting their cooperation in the curtailment of his reforms. In April 1969 he was demoted from first secretary of the party to president of the Federal Assembly. In January 1970 he was appointed ambassador to Turkey, but in June, after being expelled from the party, he was made an inspector of the forestry administration in Bratislava. He returned to prominence in national affairs in late 1989 after the Communist Party had given up its monopoly on power and agreed to participate in a coalition government. On December 28 he was elected chairman of the Federal Assembly. In March 1992 he became the leader of the Slovak Social Democrats. He died of injuries suffered in a car accident on Sept. 1, 1992.\n\nDube, Alfred Uyapo Majaye (b. June 8, 1949), Botswanan diplomat.

He joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1968. In November 1990 he was elected head of the Executive Committee of the unofficial opposition All-National Congress of the Chechen People, which advocated sovereignty for Chechnya as a separate republic within the U.S.S.R. When the Communist leadership of the Chechen-Ingush republic publicly expressed its support for the Moscow putsch in August 1991, it was forced to step down. Dudayev was elected Chechen president in October 1991 and unilaterally declared Chechnya's secession from the Russian Federation. Russia refused to recognize this move, but hesitated to use force against the secessionists. Dudayev's aggressively nationalistic, anti-Russian policies soon began to undermine Chechnya's economy and, Russian observers claimed, transformed the region into a gangsters' paradise. In 1993 the Chechen parliament attempted to organize a referendum on public confidence in Dudayev on the grounds that he had failed to consolidate Chechnya's independence. He retaliated by dissolving parliament and other organs of power. Beginning in early summer 1994, armed Chechen opposition groups with Russian military and financial backing tried repeatedly, but without success, to depose Dudayev by force. In late November, Russian president Boris Yeltsin issued an ultimatum to Dudayev and the opposition to lay down their arms. Russian tanks and troops entered Chechnya to quell the rebellion in December but found the tough mountain people an even match. Fierce fighting, most of it centred in Grozny, continued, and in 1996 Dudayev was killed in a Russian rocket attack.\n\nDudenas, Vytautas (b. June 8, 1937, Dievoniai, Lithuania), finance minister of Lithuania (1999-2000).\n\nDudka\n\nDudka, Vyacheslav (Dmitriyevich) (b.

July 31, 1653, Roxbury, Massachusetts), governor of Massachusetts (1634-35, 1640-41, 1645-46, 1650-51). He received a captain's commission in the army in 1596 and he and his company of volunteers went to France and fought on the side of Henry IV, king of France, at the siege of Amiens in 1597. After his return to England he converted to Puritanism. During the 1620s, relations between the Church of England and the Puritans worsened, and continuing pressure caused many Puritans to emigrate. In 1629 Dudley entered into an agreement with other Lincolnshire gentlemen to form the Massachusetts Bay Company. They obtained a royal charter allowing them to control their own government and elect their own magistrates. In April 1630 the main fleet of eleven vessels carrying 700 people left Southampton for America. The party included Dudley, John Winthrop (the newly appointed governor), and Simon Bradstreet. The fleet arrived in Salem in June. Not approving of Salem as the capital, Winthrop ordered the fleet south along the coast to Charlestown, ultimately settling at Newtown (later Cambridge). Dudley was elected deputy governor 13 times between 1629 and 1650, and served as governor four times. Winthrop's decision to make Boston instead of Newtown the capital precipitated the first of many quarrels between the two and prompted Dudley to move his residence to Roxbury. Whereas Winthrop was tolerant and liberal, Dudley favoured the expulsion of any person he considered to be a heretic. When the New England Federation was formed in 1643, Dudley was one of the two commissioners chosen by Massachusetts to confer with those of the other colonies.\n\nDudley, William Humble Ward, (2nd) Earl of (b.

June 21, 1826, Florence, Grand Duchy of Tuscany [Italy] - d. Feb. 12, 1902, Clandeboye, near Belfast, Ireland), governor general of Canada (1872-78) and viceroy of India (1884-88). He succeeded his father as Baron Dufferin and Clandeboye in the peerage of Ireland in 1841. In 1850 he was created Baron Clandeboye in the peerage of the United Kingdom. He was undersecretary for India (1864-66) and undersecretary for war (1866) and was William Ewart Gladstone's chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, outside the cabinet, from 1868 to 1872. He was created Earl of Dufferin and Viscount Clandeboye in 1871. As governor general of Canada, he did much to unite the newly formed dominion. In February 1879 he was appointed British ambassador to Russia. In 1881 he was transferred to the Ottoman Empire and dealt with the problems raised by the British occupation of the Ottoman dependency of Egypt. He succeeded the Marquess of Ripon as viceroy of India in 1884 and placated the British community there, which had been antagonized by Ripon's reforms. He made his regency famous by the deposition of King Thibaw of Awa (Burma) and the annexation of Burma to British India (1886). For this exploit he was made Marquess of Dufferin and Ava and Earl of Ava when, in 1888, he retired from India. He then served as Britain's ambassador to Italy (1888-91) and France (1891-96) before he retired.\n\nDuffuor, Kwabena, finance minister of Ghana (2009-13). He was also governor of the Bank of Ghana (1997-2001).\n\nDuffus\n\nDuffus, Sir Herbert (George Holwell) (b. Aug. 30, 1908, St. Ann's Bay, Jamaica - d.

Oct. 21, 1882, Cheshire, England - d. June 10, 1951, Dublin, Ireland), foreign minister of Ireland (1922); son of Sir Charles Gavan Duffy. In 1918 he was elected Sinn Féin MP for South Dublin and sat in the first Dáil Éireann. The following year he was sent to join Sean T. O'Kelly in Paris with the object of securing recognition of the republic which had been working secretly for some time. They were unsuccessful in securing even a place at the conference table, for the nations could scarcely accept their credentials without affronting Britain. Duffy remained in Paris and sought to advance his cause by press and similar propaganda. In September 1920, however, he was given notice to leave France within 24 hours unless he ceased anti-British propaganda. After a period as envoy at Rome he was selected as one of the Irish plenipotentiaries to go to London to negotiate peace. For over six weeks the negotiations dragged on, and then Prime Minister David Lloyd George presented his ultimatum - two hours to decide whether they would accept dominion status or face a resumption of war. Later the same month, and before the Dáil debate on its ratification took place, he was appointed foreign minister in the Provisional Government, but when as a result of the ratification Sinn Féin split into Free Staters and Republicans, and the latter prepared to resist the treaty by force of arms, Duffy returned his portfolio, and his association with active politics lapsed at the next general election in 1923. During William Thomas Cosgrave's government his public activities were confined to the courts, but with the rise of Fianna Fáil he again became a political power. He was appointed a judge of the High Court in 1936 and in 1946 became its president.\n\nDufour, Jean-Étienne (b. April 30, 1840, Plainpalais [now part of Geneva], Switzerland - d.

June 28, 1987, Sarajevo [now in Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]), president of the People's Assembly (1963-67) and of the Presidency (1974-78) of Bosnia and Herzegovina. He was also Yugoslav ambassador to Poland (1958-59) and the United Arab Republic (1959-61).\n\nDuh Tyzz-jiun, also called Woody Duh (b. Oct. 23, 1959), governor of Fujian province (Taiwan) (2014-16). He was also minister of economic affairs (2014), minister without portfolio (2014-15), minister of the National Development Council (2015-16), and vice premier (2016) of Taiwan.\n\nE. Duhalde\n\nDuhalde (Maldonado), Eduardo (Alberto) (b. Oct. 5, 1941, Lomas de Zamora, Buenos Aires province, Argentina), president of Argentina (2002-03). By age 30, he won his first election as a councilman in his hometown of Lomas de Zamora. When democracy was interrupted by a 1976 military coup, Duhalde already was mayor, a position he resumed when democracy returned in 1983. Then his political career soared. In 1987, he entered Congress as a deputy in the lower house. Two years later, Carlos Menem picked him as his presidential running mate and the Peronist duo won easily. In 1991, he resigned and won the first of two Buenos Aires gubernatorial terms, which were marred by a heavy debt run-up and widespread allegations of corruption. He ran for president in 1999, but was defeated by Fernando de la Rúa. He led the Peronists' sweeping victory in legislative elections in October 2001, and after the political chaos following de la Rúa's resignation in December 2001, Congress on Jan. 1, 2002, named Duhalde president to complete de la Rúa's term to 2003. He was an unsuccessful presidential candidate in 2011.\n\nDuhalde Vásquez, Alfredo (b. June 30, 1898, Río Bueno, Chile - d.

Nov. 3, 1933, Brookline, Mass.), governor of Massachusetts (1975-79, 1983-91) and U.S. presidential candidate (1988). He became active in Massachusetts Democratic politics and served eight years (1963-71) in the state's House of Representatives. He lost a bid for the Massachusetts lieutenant governorship in 1970 but in 1974 won election to the governorship over an incumbent Republican. He coped with a serious budgetary crisis and restored the state's fiscal health. He lost his bid for reelection in 1978 to Edward King, an antitax maverick Democrat. Again elected governor in 1982, Dukakis seemed less aloof and more persuasive than in earlier campaigns. During his second term he coordinated the government's policies so as to greatly strengthen the state's economic base, saving old industries and encouraging the growth of new ones. He was overwhelmingly reelected in 1986. Partly as a result of his efforts, Massachusetts for a brief time had one of the nation's healthiest state economies. In April 1987 Dukakis declared his candidacy for the presidency. He emerged as the most popular candidate in the 1988 Democratic primaries and won his party's nomination for president. Attacked by his Republican opponent George Bush as a \"liberal,\" deficient in patriotism and soft on crime and defense, Dukakis at first seemed uncertain how to respond. He accused Bush of negative campaigning but responded in kind. He embarked on a whirlwind tour of the nation and seemed to be gaining some support, but in the election on November 8, he carried only ten states and the District of Columbia. He later announced that he would not run again for governor.\n\nDuke, Donald (b. Sept. 30, 1961, Calabar, Nigeria), governor of Cross River (1999-2007).\n\nDuke, Sir (Frederick) William (b. Dec. 8, 1863 - d. June 11, 1924), lieutenant governor of Bengal (1911-12); knighted 1911.\n\nDukes\n\nDukes, Alan (Martin) (b. April 22, 1945, Dublin, Ireland), Irish politician. Elected to the Dáil (parliament) for the constituency of Kildare on his first attempt in June 1981, he was appointed to the cabinet immediately, serving as minister for agriculture in the Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition's short-lived administration. On the formation of another coalition government involving the same parties in December 1982, he was appointed minister for finance, a post he held until February 1986, when he became minister for justice. Dukes was regarded as an extremely able man, with a cool, aloof manner. As a former member of the Irish commissioner's cabinet in Brussels (1977-80), he was much respected by his peers in the European Communities (EC) for his calm and rational approach to debates of national importance. Following the sudden resignation of Garret FitzGerald as leader of Fine Gael, Dukes was elected to the post on March 21, 1987. He assumed the leadership at a time of enormous difficulty for the party. After a crushing defeat in the February general elections, Fine Gael was experiencing a crisis of identity that was hard to resolve. Dukes came from the party's more liberal wing. He faced difficulties in reconciling the traditional values held by the older members of the party with the liberal and social ethos associated with FitzGerald. He soon ran into criticism on economic policy when he pledged the party's support for the policies of fiscal rectitude being adopted by the Fianna Fáil government. The 1989 elections saw Fine Gael increase its representation, but after a disappointing performance by the Fine Gael candidate, Austin Currie, in the presidential election of 1990, Dukes relinquished the party leadership in November 1990. He was minister of transport, energy, and communications in 1996-97.\n\nDukhovskoy, Sergey (Mikhailovich) (b. Oct. 19 [Oct. 7, O.S.], 1838, St. Petersburg, Russia - d. March 14 [March 1, O.S.], 1901, St. Petersburg), governor-general of Priamurye (1893-98) and Turkestan (1898-1901).\n\nDukuly-Tolbert, Neh Rita Sangai, Liberian diplomat; widow of Stephen A. Tolbert. She was ambassador to France (1977-80), Switzerland and Spain (1978-80), and China (2005-10) and permanent representative to the United Nations (1999-2001).\n\nDukwana\n\nDukwana, Mxolisi (Abraham) (b. Sept. 14, 1964, Odendaalsrus, Orange Free State [now Free State], South Africa), premier of Free State (2023-24).\n\nDulanto (Silva), Martín (b. 1831, Supe, Peru - d.

She was also minister of agriculture, forestry, and water economy (2004-06).\n\nDulin, V. (M.), executive secretary of the Communist Party committee of the Kabardino-Balkar autonomous oblast (1928-29).\n\nDullert, Willem Hendrik (b. June 27, 1817, Arnhem, Netherlands - d. Feb. 24, 1881, Arnhem), Dutch politician. He was chairman of the Second Chamber (1852-53, 1869-81).\n\nA.W. Dulles\n\nDulles, Allen W(elsh) (b. April 7, 1893, Watertown, N.Y. - d. Jan. 28, 1969, Washington, D.C.), director of the Central Intelligence Agency (1953-61); brother of John Foster Dulles. He served in various diplomatic posts until he was named chief of the State Department's Near Eastern Division in 1922. When the United States entered World War II, Dulles was recruited by Col. William J. Donovan for the new intelligence agency, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). From October 1942 to May 1945 he served as chief of the OSS office in Bern, playing, in particular, a notable role in the events that led to the surrender of German troops in northern Italy. In 1948 Dulles was made chairman of a three-man committee charged with surveying the U.S. intelligence system. After the CIA was established, he was appointed (Aug. 23, 1951) deputy director under Gen. Walter Bedell Smith, and on Feb. 9, 1953, he was appointed director by Pres. Dwight D. Eisenhower. The agency was effective in a number of major operations, notably the overthrow of the governments of Mohammad Mossadegh in Iran in 1953 and Jacobo Arbenz in Guatemala in 1954. It also succeeded in obtaining a copy of Nikita Khrushchev's secret speech of 1956 denouncing Stalin. There was a first setback when a U-2 spy plane over the Soviet Union was brought down in 1960. The incident led Khrushchev to call off a scheduled summit conference. Reappointed by Pres. John F. Kennedy, Dulles was involved in what was the biggest blow yet to the CIA's stature, the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in April 1961. He was replaced later that year.\n\nJ.F. Dulles\n\nDulles, John Foster (b. Feb. 25, 1888, Washington, D.C. - d. May 24, 1959, Washington, D.C.), U.S. secretary of state (1953-59); grandson of John W. Foster; nephew of Robert Lansing. In World War I he served as a major on the army general staff and after the war, at 30 years of age, he was named by Pres. Woodrow Wilson as legal counsel to the U.S. delegation to the Versailles Peace Conference; afterward he served as a member of the war reparations commission. In World War II, he helped prepare the United Nations charter at Dumbarton Oaks, in Washington, D.C., and in 1945 served as a senior adviser at the San Francisco United Nations conference. When it became apparent that a peace treaty with Japan acceptable to the United States could not be concluded with the participation of the Soviet Union, Pres. Harry Truman and his secretary of state, Dean Acheson, decided not to call a peace conference to negotiate the treaty. Instead, they assigned to Dulles the difficult task of personally negotiating and concluding the treaty. Dulles traveled to the capitals of many of the nations involved, and in 1951 the previously agreed to treaty was signed in San Francisco by Japan and 48 other nations. Dulles prepared the foreign policy plank of the Republican Party platform in 1952 and after the national election of that year was designated Pres. Dwight D. Eisenhower's secretary of state. Passionate hostility to Communism was the leitmotiv of his policy. He seemed to derive personal satisfaction from pushing the Soviet Union to the brink. Seriously ill, he resigned his cabinet position on April 15, 1959. Shortly before he died in the following month, he was awarded the Medal of Freedom.\n\nDulloo, Madan (Murlidhar) (b. Sept. 20, 1949), foreign minister of Mauritius (1986, 1990, 2005-08). He was also minister of agriculture, fisheries, and natural resources (1986-93) and agriculture and natural resources and justice (1993-94).\n\nDuma, William (Marra) (b. Oct. 26, 1967), Papua New Guinean politician. He has been minister of environment and conservation (2003-07), justice (2007), petroleum and energy (2007-14 [2011-12 in O'Neill government]), defense (2012), transport and infrastructure (2014-16), public enterprises and state investments (2016-19), commerce and trade (2019-20), state enterprises (2020- ), and mining, agriculture, fisheries, and works and implementation (2022).\n\nDumas, Pierre Benoît (b. September 1668, Estibeaux [now in Landes département], France - d. 1745), governor of Île Bourbon (1727-35), Île de France (1729), and French India (1735-41).\n\nR. Dumas\n\nDumas, Roland (b. Aug. 23, 1922, Limoges, France - d. July 3, 2024), French politician. He was the son of a civil servant who was shot by Nazi occupation forces in World War II for taking part in the resistance movement. Dumas joined the resistance. He first met François Mitterrand in the 1950s and became his adviser after Mitterrand's 1981 presidential election victory. He was European affairs minister (1983-84) and twice foreign minister (1984-86, 1988-93) during Mitterrand's presidency. In 2000 he saw his standing shattered by corruption allegations levelled by a former mistress. The suave Socialist stepped down as president of the Constitutional Council, a post that made him the top legal authority in the land and to which he was appointed by Mitterrand shortly before his presidential term ended in 1995. Dumas had previously refused to step down, saying that to do so would imply he was guilty of charges that have filled French news and gossip columns for more than two years. That defense crumbled after two magistrates ruled on February 18 that he and ex-lover Christine Deviers-Joncour should stand trial in a criminal court for alleged corruption involving the oil company Elf Aquitaine. The scandal began when Deviers-Joncour admitted receiving 66 million French francs ($9.75 million) from Elf to lobby Dumas to approve the controversial 1991 sale of six frigates to Taiwan by another state-controlled firm. Deviers-Joncour, who published some of her charges in a book entitled \"The Whore of the Republic,\" also said she showered Dumas with lavish presents financed by Elf and gave him the run of the luxury flat provided for her by the oil company. He was given a six-month prison term in 2001, but an appeals court overturned the verdict in 2003.\n\nDumas Rodríguez, Edgardo (b. Oct. 30, 1931, El Progreso, Yoro, Honduras - d.

She served as deputy permanent secretary in the ministry of works and utilities from 1975 to 1978. She also served as secretary-general of the Free National Movement (FNM). Following the FNM victory in the Aug. 19, 1992, general elections, she was appointed to the Senate and sworn in as minister of health and environment (August 24); she was one of three females appointed to the cabinet. On Jan. 9, 1995, she was appointed minister of education and training, and was reappointed to that post on March 18, 1997, after the FNM's second consecutive victory in the March 14 general elections. Prime Minister Hubert Ingraham revered her as \"always a source of good counsel, advice, and guidance, Dame Ivy never shied away from disagreement. She offered her critiques freely, making them all the more valuable.\" Just prior to her retirement as minister of education, youth and sports on Jan. 30, 2001, Dame Ivy said she was looking forward to her retirement from the public service. But in November she was appointed acting governor-general, following the retirement of Sir Orville Turnquest, becoming the first woman in that position. She had been sworn in on two occasions before to serve as deputy to the governor-general. She was confirmed as governor-general on Jan. 1, 2002. She retired on Nov. 30, 2005.\n\nDumont, Norbert (b. Feb. 7, 1883, Mersch, Luxembourg - d. 1956), interior minister of Luxembourg (1926-36). He was also justice minister (1925-36).\n\nR. Dumont\n\nDumont, René (Fernand) (b. March 13, 1904, Cambrai, France - d. June 18, 2001, Fontenay-sous-Bois, near Paris, France), French politician. He was the first candidate ever to run for president on an environmental platform, winning 1.3% of the vote in the 1974 election.

Sept. 9, 1926, Houston, Texas - d. Oct. 18, 2022, Houston), U.S. energy secretary (1979-81). In 1977 he was appointed deputy secretary of defense, in charge of that department's financial management. In the summer of 1979 he became energy secretary. From the start, his brisk businessman's approach was viewed as a sharp contrast to the sometimes chaotic rule of James Schlesinger, who had headed the cabinet department since its creation in 1977. Schlesinger was under fire from all sides when he resigned, and the department had been severely criticized for its confusing and contradictory policies. Duncan's main asset appeared to be the professional management approach he brought to the job.\n\nD.K. Duncan\n\nJohn Duncan\n\nDuncan, Daniel Kablan (b. June 30, 1943, Ouellé, Ivory Coast [now Côte d'Ivoire]), prime minister (1993-99, 2012-17), economy and finance minister (1993-96, 2012-17), foreign minister (2011-12), and vice president (2017-20) of Côte d'Ivoire.

Duncan was first elected as member of the Yukon Legislative Assembly for Porter Creek South in the general election of Sept. 30, 1996. She succeeded Ken Taylor as leader of the Yukon Liberal Party in 1998. She was reelected in the general election of April 17, 2000, when she led her party to victory, becoming the Yukon's first Liberal and first female head of government. An early general election occurred in November 2002 after three Liberal MLAs left the party, accusing Duncan of dictatorial leadership. She was the only Liberal to win a seat and was replaced as premier by Dennis Fentie of the Yukon Party. She stepped down from the Liberal Party leadership in 2005.\n\nDuncan, Sir Patrick (b. Dec. 21, 1870, Fortrie, Banffshire, Scotland - d. July 17, 1943, Pretoria, South Africa), interior minister (1921-24) and governor-general (1937-43) of South Africa; knighted 1937.

He was financial secretary to the War Office (1941-43) and to the Ministry of Supply (1943-44). Sandys distinguished himself as chairman of the war cabinet's committee for defense against German flying bombs (1943-45), and he entered the cabinet (December 1944) as minister of works. While his party was out of office (1945-51) - and he was out of Parliament (1945-50) - he worked enthusiastically to promote European unity. As minister of supply (1951-54) he denationalized the iron and steel industry, and as minister of housing and local government (1954-57) he abolished rent-restriction laws. As minister of defence (1957-59) he inaugurated the policy of reliance upon nuclear deterrents rather than conventional forces. After serving as minister of aviation (1959-60) he became secretary of state for Commonwealth relations (1960-64) and colonies (1962-64) and assisted British colonies as they prepared for independence. He was created a life peer in 1974, and then also changed his name by deed poll from Sandys to Duncan-Sandys.\n\nDuncan Smith\n\nDuncan Smith, Sir (George) Iain (b. April 9, 1954, Edinburgh, Scotland), British politician. He first stood for Parliament in 1987. In 1992 he entered the House of Commons as MP for Chingford, a strongly Conservative middle-class constituency on the outskirts of London. He quickly established himself as a member of the anti-EU \"awkward squad\" of Conservative backbench MPs who attacked their own party's government for signing the EU's Maastricht Treaty and who frequently voted against the government on European issues. He established himself as a right-winger also by arguing that the role of the state should be curbed significantly and that taxes should be sharply reduced. In 1997 he was reelected for the redrawn constituency of Chingford and Woodford Green. The Conservatives lost power in those elections, and the new party leader, William Hague, appointed Duncan Smith to his shadow cabinet as official spokesman on social security. He became shadow defense secretary in 1999, but he continued to be best known for his uncompromising views on Europe. When Hague resigned following the party's disastrous performance in the general election of June 7, 2001, Duncan Smith stood for the party leadership (to be decided for the first time by all party members), promising that he would \"never\" support the entry of Britain into the EU's single currency. Of five candidates he was alone in never having served before as a government minister. In the final runoff against his pro-European (and far more experienced) rival, Kenneth Clarke, Duncan Smith's views proved to be far more in tune with the party membership, and on September 13 he was declared the winner with 61% of the votes cast. But he ultimately failed to unite the party behind him, and the Tory MPs ousted him by a 90-75 vote on Oct. 29, 2003. In 2010-16 he was work and pensions secretary in David Cameron's government. He was knighted in 2019.\n\nDundas, Sir Ambrose Dundas Flux (b. April 14, 1899 - d.

When he took the job as labor secretary for Pres. Gerald Ford, he had previously served on numerous national boards and commissions studying labour disputes and had advised the Labor Department dating back to the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration. He resigned his cabinet post in January 1976 after a communications mix-up with the White House. He left a meeting with Ford under the impression the president supported legislation backed by labour groups that allowed picketing at certain kinds of construction sites. Dunlop endorsed the legislation in testimony on Capitol Hill, angering some Republicans. When Ford vetoed the legislation, Dunlop resigned. He remained active as a labour negotiator, working to resolve disputes between Harvard and its employees, and between the city of Boston and its firefighters, among others.\n\nDunmore\n\nDunmore, John Murray, (4th) Earl of, (4th) Viscount Fincastle, (4th) Lord Murray of Blair, Moulin, and Tillimet (b. 1732, Taymouth, Perthshire, Scotland - d.

May 22, 1926, London, England - d. March 22, 2000, Lanzarote, Canary Islands, Spain), governor of Bermuda (1983-88); son of William Shepherd Morrison, Viscount Dunrossil. He was appointed governor of Bermuda in July 1983, following postings as British high commissioner to Fiji, Nauru, and Tuvalu (1978-82) and Barbados (1982-83). In Bermuda, he became actively involved with community organizations, including the St. John Ambulance Brigade, which named their Paget headquarters, Dunrossil House, after him. In retirement he served on various boards and was active in the House of Lords as a crossbencher watching out for the interests of the Scottish islands, and sitting on various select committees. He was lord lieutenant of the Western Isles from 1993.\n\nDunrossil (of Vallaquie in the Isle of North Uist and County of Inverness), William Shepherd Morrison, (1st) Viscount (b.

June 6, 1920, Cowichan, B.C.), premier (1900-02) and lieutenant governor (1906-09) of British Columbia. He was first elected to the legislature in 1898 from the riding of Comox (in subsequent elections he would represent South Nanaimo). Following a vote of no confidence in against Premier Joseph Martin, Lieutenant Governor Thomas Robert McInnes named Dunsmuir premier as the only person with enough support to form a government: at this politically unsettled time, party allegiance was weak and no leader commanded a strong following in the legislature. Dunsmuir was a controversial choice - a prominent Vancouver businessman whose family had made a fortune through the B.C. mining industry, he was identified with brutal labour practices and his mines were considered the most dangerous in the world. His conservative, business-oriented administration was marked by continual squabbling, exacerbated by his leadership style, which was autocratic and intolerant of opposition. Repeated clashes with organized labour, Asian immigrants, and Ottawa plagued his government and forced him into an early resignation after two years. In 1906 he was appointed lieutenant governor but once again he did not enjoy public office and resigned prematurely.\n\nD.A. Dunstan\n\nDunstan, Donald Allan, byname Don Dunstan (b. Sept. 21, 1926, Suva, Fiji - d. Feb. 6, 1999, Adelaide, S.Aus.), premier of South Australia (1967-68, 1970-79). He began his political career in Adelaide handing out how-to-vote cards for the conservatives in 1943, when he was still at school, but soon changed his views (\"I've often been described as a congenital rebel - in fact my headmaster at St. Peter's [College] repeated that phrase on more than one occasion\"). He entered state parliament in 1953. He moved at Labor's 1965 Federal Conference in Sydney that the words \"White Australia\" be dropped from the party's policy. After leading Labor to defeat at the 1968 South Australian state election, Dunstan won four elections in a row in the 1970s. His period in office was marked by social reforms including the decriminalization of homosexuality, making his the first state in the country to do so. He was also known for supporting the arts and established Aboriginal land rights for the first time in the country. The Dunstan era was one of major reform that turned conservative South Australia into one of the nation's most progressive states in the 1970s. One day in 1972, Dunstan defied convention and attended parliament wearing pink shorts instead of the traditional gray suit. Dunstan said he had sought to inject some panache into the conservative corridors of power. He was one of Australia's most popular politicians.\n\nDunstan, Sir Donald Beaumont (b. Feb. 18, 1923, Murray Bridge, S.Aus. - d. Oct. 15, 2011, Adelaide, S.Aus.), governor of South Australia (1982-91); knighted 1980.

March 15, 1919, Lolok Sar, Pursat province, Cambodia - d. Aug. 5, 2009, Lagny-sur-Marne, Seine-et-Marne, France), defense minister of Cambodia (1967-68). He was also minister of military equipment and armanent (royal government, 1970-74).\n\nDuong\n\nDuong Van Minh (b. Feb. 16, 1916, My Tho, Mekong delta - d. Aug. 6, 2001, Pasadena, Calif.), Vietnamese politician. He joined the French colonial army in the 1940s when he was one of 50 Vietnamese officers to be commissioned in the French colonial army.
