He collaborated with an impressive roster of modern architects and was commissioned by powerful members of the Brazilian political elite.1 With the right-wing military coup of 1964 and his subsequent appointment to a federal advisory council, Burle Marx’s decades of experience as a landscape architect would be complemented by his newly voiced activist position of environmental advocacy. Throughout his professional career, Burle Marx developed and maintained close ties with those in power, proving himself to be adept at leveraging those connections in order to play a significant role in the greater project of the cultural construction of a rapidly modernizing country. He consistently positioned the Brazilian landscape as a significant element of Brazil’s cultural heritage, arguing vehemently for its protection. Burle Marx’s environmental advocacy was effectively realized in two realms: physical design and political positioning. The latter was most pronounced during Brazil’s twenty-one years of authoritarian military dictatorship, initiated by the coup of March 31, 1964. Three years later, in 1967, the first president of the dictatorship, Humberto 1\n\nde Alencar Castelo Branco, appointed Burle Marx to serve as a member of the Conselho Federal de Cultura (CFC, Federal Council of Culture), which operated as an advisory board under the authority of the Ministério da Educação e Cultura (Ministry of Education and Culture). This book examines Burle Marx’s eighteen environmental depositions, a series of position pieces written and delivered to this plenary council during the seven years of his tenure from 1967 through 1974—a period that included the regime’s most oppressive years. These depositions, addressing such issues as deforestation, national parks and land conservation, urban disfiguration, botanical gardens, ecological devastation, and the unique qualities of the Brazilian landscape, articulate an opposition to the regime’s strategy of national economic development. This book presents the collected depositions, translated into English from the Portuguese and republished here for the first time since they appeared as proceedings in three journals of the Brazilian Ministério da Educação e Cultura: Cultura, Boletim, and Revista Brasileira de Cultura. A close reading of these texts provides new insight into a selection of Burle Marx’s earlier public design works, set forth here as visual evidence. The words of the Conselho Federal de Cultura depositions elucidate a little-known but important moment in the trajectory of Burle Marx’s oeuvre, from prolific designer to prescient counselor. Yet the complexity of the historical and political context cannot be overlooked—Burle Marx was a voluntary cultural advisor to a regime that would execute a series of brutal human rights violations as well as devastating environmental abuses in the interest of national economic development. Burle Marx’s tenure as cultural counselor from 1967 through 1974 overlapped with a particularly repressive period of Brazil’s military dictatorship known as the anos de chumbo (years of lead) but also aligned with the years of economic recovery and wealth known as the milagre econômico brasileiro—the Brazilian Miracle. It must be acknowledged that the military regime in Brazil successfully seized power with the support of the covert interventionist policies of the United States during the cold war, driven by a fear of the spread of communism in the Western Hemisphere. The military also took advantage of an economic crisis, and the duration of the regime was dependent on its developmentalist agenda and subsequent economic recovery of the so-called Brazilian Miracle. In addition, the authoritarianism of the Brazilian military regime was amply supported by the middle and upper classes during its whole existence, certainly by those who were profiting economically. Redemocratization was not initiated, and was arguably not a viable alternative, until the deterioration of the Brazilian economy in the late 1970s due to massive debt produced by international borrowing.2 To maintain its authority, the military regime violently suppressed freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and any political opposition, which included both extreme-left and extreme-right groups. Many significant cultural and political figures were harassed, exiled, tortured, or otherwise driven from Brazil during this period, including Gilberto Gil, Caetano Veloso, Chico Buarque, and Oscar Niemeyer.3 Yet 2 DEPOSITIONS\n\nFIGURE 0.2.\n\nMilitary tanks in front of the Ministério da Guerra and Estação Central do Brasil, Rio de Janeiro, April 2, 1964 Photo by Neuza França/Arquivo Nacional do Brasil\n\nFIGURE 0.3.\n\nCover of Cultura 1, no. 1 (July 1967) Acervo da Fundação Biblioteca Nacional do Brasil\n\nFIGURE 0.4.\n\nPasseata dos Cem Mil (March of 100,000), Cinelândia, Rio de Janeiro, June 1968 Centro de Pesquisa e Documentação do Jornal do Brasil\n\nFIGURE 0.5.\n\nRoberto Burle Marx (left) at a plenary session of the Conselho Federal de Cultura, with fellow counselors Gilberto Freyre, João Guimarães Rosa, and Rachel de Queiroz, ca. 1967 Photographer unknown\n\nmany massive civilian protests were organized. The most significant demonstration against the military dictatorship since its onset in 1964 was the Passeata dos Cem Mil (March of 100,000) held on June 22, 1968, in Rio de Janeiro. The regime responded fiercely with the implementation of Ato Institucional Número Cinco (AI-5, Institutional Act No. 5), enacted by the second president of the dictatorship, Artur da Costa e Silva, on December 13, 1968. Among other prohibitions, AI-5 suspended citizens’ political rights and any constitutional guarantee of habeas corpus for those accused of politically motivated crimes. It eventually resulted in the institutionalization of the use of torture as a tool of the state. AI-5 marked the beginning of the anos de chumbo and the most repressive period of the dictatorship, continuing through the end of Emílio Garrastazu Médici’s rule in 1974. As a cultural counselor, Roberto Burle Marx remained close to the regime, perhaps a conservative stance. He arguably held a powerful platform from which to advise and influence the policies of the regime, yet he was obliged to perform in a situation in which critical speech acts were highly restricted. His appointment to the Conselho Federal de Cultura presented a unique position, ethically compromised though it may have been, from which to develop and assert his ideas of the modern Brazilian landscape, its protection, and its relationship to the public realm, while reflecting a distinctly modernist approach to aesthetics, ecology, and conservation. This book translates, categorizes, and contextualizes Burle Marx’s eighteen consular statements through an analysis of their historical and political context. The depositions are framed and introduced by a critical presentation of both pertinent examples of Burle Marx’s earlier public landscape projects (organized by decade) and their political milieu. Chapter 1, “Constructing Culture in Brazil: Politics and the Public Landscape,” is an examination of the extended history of the construction and support of landscape as culture through the policies of the Brazilian state, from the 1808 arrival of the Portuguese court in Rio de Janeiro through the establishment of the Conselho Federal de Cultura by the military regime in 1967. Burle Marx’s eighteen depositions are subsequently presented in the next five chapters in five thematic groupings, each paired with his key public projects organized both typologically and chronologically by decade. His public parks are thus presented in parallel with the key political and cultural policies that influenced the environmentalist positioning expressed in the selected depositions. Chapter 2, “Forest Narratives,” examines the ecological tableaux developed in Burle Marx’s early public plazas in Recife and Rio de Janeiro in parallel with the important Forestry Code of 1934, the Código Florestal Brasileiro, and its subsequent iterations by the military regime. Chapter 3, “Landscapes of the Baroque Interior,” considers the role of the landscape in Brazil’s heritage protection laws, established in 1937 by the Serviço do Patrimônio Histórico e Artístico Nacional (Department of National Historic and introduction 5\n\nArtistic Heritage), known by its acronym SPHAN. With a focus on the state’s valorization of the colonial baroque, this chapter examines Burle Marx’s early park projects in the interior state of Minas Gerais. Chapter 4, “Large Parks, Statues, and Disfigurement,” analyzes Burle Marx’s large metropolitan parks, initiated as commemorative centennial projects, and his ongoing concerns with the disfigurement of urban public spaces. Chapter 5, “The Scientific Park,” examines the typology of the botanical garden, presenting Burle Marx’s designs for botanical and zoological gardens as well as his own private experimental nursery and garden at Barra de Guaratiba, Rio de Janeiro. The chapter focuses on his advocacy as counselor for Rio de Janeiro’s historic Jardim Botânico as well as other botanical gardens throughout the country. Chapter 6, “Military Gardens,” discusses Burle Marx’s gardens for three of Brasília’s ministries (International Relations, Justice, and the Army), all commissioned after 1964 by the military regime itself, and concludes with a presentation of his essay “Garden and Ecology,” written for the Conselho Federal de Cultura’s journal Revista Brasileira de Cultura—an excellent summation of his positioning of nature, environmental conservation, and ecology as part of the cultural expression of a modern Brazil. The epilogue, entitled “The Counselor,” analyzes the ethical questions and political motivations of Burle Marx’s role as advisor to the military regime. Burle Marx was a messenger, an early advocate for the environment, and his role as counselor was one of his greatest and most powerful acts as a landscape architect. Through his carefully crafted depositions, he argued for the designation of more national parks and natural reserves, the conservation of cultural landscapes in the historic colonial towns of the interior, the protection of the Jardim Botânico of Rio de Janeiro and its adjacent forest nursery, and a more robust enforcement of the Brazilian Forestry Code in order to protect the country’s forests from exploitative deforestation. He spoke from experience, often referring to himself as a witness—indeed, Burle Marx had traveled throughout the country on expeditions he would call viagens de coleta, plant collection trips modeled on the earlier missions of naturalists and scientists in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries throughout various geographic regions of Brazil. At his home and experimental plant nursery at a former plantation site in Barra de Guaratiba, he propagated over 3,500 species of live Brazilian plants, several of which were discovered during his extensive travels and now bear his Latinized name, burle marxii. Burle Marx’s prescient depositions raise the specters of both species extinction and climate change. He noted the disappearance of hardwood tree species; the increase of torrential rains, erosion, and mudslides; and the observable changes in the climate. He insisted that the definition of national culture include the Brazilian forest and its diversity of flora as a part of the Brazilian national heritage, which therefore deserved protective legislation. Perhaps at some personal risk, considering several 6 DEPOSITIONS\n\nFIGURE 0.6.\n\nSítio Santo Antônio da Bica, Burle Marx’s home and experimental nursery garden, Barra de Guaratiba, ca. 1970 Photo by Alair Gomes/Acervo da Fundação Biblioteca Nacional do Brasil\n\nimplicit critiques of the regime’s values and policies present in these texts, Burle Marx leveraged his position as counselor to argue for environmental protection from a government consumed with the modernist drive toward economic development (desenvolvimento), occurring at the high cost of environmental destruction. Burle Marx, the counselor, sought to reconcile the world of the environment with that of the encroaching realities of a new and rapidly urbanizing Brazil, including a massive housing crisis and extreme income inequality. These realities were often at introduction 7\n\nodds with his advocacy of conservation. Burle Marx intended his gardens to provide didactic environments for the public, to expose them to the wealth and beauty of the flora and ecological tableaux of Brazil, the country with the greatest amount of biodiversity on the planet even today. Though he moved within the small circles of the powerful Brazilian elite, Burle Marx remained aware of the fringes and worked to understand complex questions of access, marginality, and the crisis of identity. Yet he tended to support the greater state project of the culture of the environment over individual human rights. Burle Marx’s decision to work with the military regime in Brazil was ethically fraught indeed; but this conflux of culture and politics is common, often appearing in the realm of design. Likewise, the intertwining of art and politics during the military dictatorship in Brazil is certainly inextricable from the international collusion of countries like the United States with that regime. As an American scholar and landscape architect who has had the privilege of living and researching in Brazil for several years, I have had the opportunity of engaging not only with a rich body of work usually inaccessible to English speakers but also with the very cultural institutions that this book examines—the Jardim Botânico, Biblioteca Nacional, Escola Nacional de Belas Artes (ENBA: National School of Fine Arts), and of course Ministério da Educação e Cultura. As a translator and an outsider reckoning with the legacy of the military dictatorship in Brazil whose fascination with Roberto Burle Marx’s work and writing has spanned two decades, it is an honor to give voice to his eighteen speeches. Fifty years have passed since his first address to the full plenary session of the Conselho Federal de Cultura at the Palácio da Cultura in Rio de Janeiro. Burle Marx spoke five languages in addition to his native Portuguese but wrote predominantly in Portuguese, and very few translations of his primary texts have been made available in English. These eighteen spoken depositions, delivered over a period of seven years, constitute a unique assemblage. The statements, transcribed by a stenographer before being published in the ministry’s meticulous journals, have undergone several layers of translation prior to landing in this book. The deposition, as a particular speech act, includes both locutionary and illocutionary components—a challenge for any translator. How does one translate words that are withheld? The translation task here has thus been manifold. It is probable that much of the content of Burle Marx’s depositions was not formally written as a complete text before oral delivery to the full council. I suspect (though I do not have archival evidence) that he probably worked from an outline or notes, adding emphatic rhetorical emphasis where needed. Even when the depositions appear to be more formally structured, he connects with his listeners: the audience is present and palpable in our own reading of these speeches. Indeed, the depositions are best interpreted as speech acts when read aloud. I have thus attempted to capture the cadence and power of Burle Marx’s dramatic voice in these English translations. On several occasions, Burle Marx develops a position piece around something that 8 DEPOSITIONS\n\nhe has just read in the newspaper or expands his thoughts in reference to commentary delivered by another counselor at a previous meeting. He reflects upon a recent Ministério da Agricultura (Ministry of Agriculture) conference held in Brasília and shares his comparative impressions of Brazil with other countries upon his return from a trip abroad. Burle Marx’s depositions are meant to convince: his speeches, while circuitous, often conclude with a direct proposition to change or implement specific policy. These are entertaining oral presentations. Like any good storyteller, Burle Marx implements the meander as a way of pouncing upon a conclusion that is sharp, acerbic, and direct. Though meandering, the depositions are specific enough that they consistently require contextualization. This has led me to cast a wider net around the speeches, situating them within the key policies that Burle Marx evokes: the Forestry Code and SPHAN legislation both provide useful lenses through which the depositions are best interpreted. The contents of the speeches also require a curated visual context. I am grateful to the numerous archives and individuals in Brazil who so willingly shared their rich collections. These visual exhibits, including my new scaled drawings of Burle Marx’s public parks, situate the depositions and illuminate the counselor’s speech. Indeed, they often reveal what is not said, providing evidence for a cross-examination. As focused and activist opinion pieces very much of their time, the depositions are inextricably anchored to an incredibly rich history of Brazilian culture, covering the period from the arrival of the Portuguese royal family on Brazilian soil to the present day—yet they speak evocatively to our time as well. The deposition is a particular speech act with a promise to uphold the truth, and this collation offers the reader an opportunity to take Burle Marx at his word.\n\nintroduction 9\n\nFIGURE 1.0.\n\nPortrait of Dom Pedro II, emperor of Brazil, seated at the Paço de São Cristóvão, Quinta da Boa Vista, Rio de Janeiro, ca. 1885 Photo by Marc Ferrez/Gilberto Ferrez Collection/Instituto Moreira Salles\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nConstructing Culture in Brazil Politics and the Public Landscape\n\nRoberto Burle Marx came of age in the 1930s, a decade of significant political and cultural transformation in Brazil, during which a distinctly modern Brazilian cultural identity was increasingly promoted for a rapidly industrializing nation. Throughout his professional career, Burle Marx emphasized the importance of conserving and valorizing the biodiversity of the environment, developing an ecologically positioned defense of the Brazilian public landscape as an integral component of cultural heritage. Yet Brazil’s identity has been intertwined with the representation and imagination of its landscape since the colonial period, particularly its rich tropical flora. The Brazilian state has long been the leading force in culture and education—the patron of modern buildings, plazas, and parks as well as a sponsor of the conservation of natural and architectural patrimony. This cultural patrimony was an essential component of Brazilian state policy from the arrival of Prince Regent João VI of Portugal to Rio de Janeiro in 1808 through the coup that established the military dictatorship under Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco in 1964. As a member of the Conselho Federal de Cultura and advisor to the military regime from 1967 through 1974, Burle Marx tapped directly into this history in order to influence the direction of the regime’s policies toward the environment. Although his tenure as counselor coincided with the most repressive years of the dictatorship, his ecological defense of 11\n\nthe public landscape ran boldly counter to the economic development policies of the regime. Burle Marx transformed a conservationist spirit into a prescient environmentalist position that constructed Brazilian modernity as inseparable from an ecological positioning of nature.\n\nThe Arrival of the Royal Court, 1808–1821 The construction of culture and education by a government apparatus, with an undercurrent that embraces nature as a critical aspect of that culture, has an extended history in Brazil, which was colonized by the kingdom of Portugal beginning with the arrival of Pedro Álvares Cabral on April 22, 1500. The very name “Brazil” is drawn from the colony’s first major export, the hardwood tree species paubrasil or brazilwood (Caesalpinia echinata), prized for its red dye. Massive colonial extraction of pau-brasil from Brazil’s coastal forests nearly led to its extinction—the early Portuguese colonization was funded through this exploitative deforestation. Yet with the arrival of the Portuguese royal family and court three hundred years later, seeking refuge from Napoleon Bonaparte’s invasion of Portugal during the Peninsular War, a state-sponsored program of both education and culture was initiated in Brazil. The enhancement and support of the natural environment, now seen as a valuable asset of the new tropical kingdom, was considered an imperative. In 1808 Queen Maria I of Portugal, her son Prince Regent João, and the entire Portuguese court of approximately 20,000 people arrived in Rio de Janeiro in a massive flotilla, escorted by the British navy. The royal family established itself on a large property north of the city center, the Quinta da Boa Vista, and expanded the site’s sumptuous manor house that would become known as the Paço de São Cristóvão. The same year, João established the Jardim Botânico of Rio de Janeiro as the Horto Real, an acclimatization garden for the propagation of tropical plants, spices, and tea from the Portuguese colonies of the East Indies, China, and Africa.1 Seeds of the majestic royal palm (Roystonea oleracea) were given to João by Luís de Abreu Vieira e Silva in 1809, who obtained them clandestinely from the acclimatization gardens of the French colony of Mauritius. Planted at the Jardim Botânico and named the palma mater, the palm grew to a height of almost forty meters and eventually flowered in 1829. Its seeds were used to establish the Jardim Botânico’s stunning 750-meter long allée of 134 royal palms. The original palma mater was destroyed by lighting in 1972 after surviving 163 years, but its descendants thrive in parks and gardens throughout Brazil. Another prized species was Victoria amazonica, the giant water lily, discovered in 1837 along the Amazon River in British Guiana. The specimens at the Jardim Botânico were cultivated from seeds brought to the garden from the state of Mato Grosso by the botanist Frederico Carlos Hoehne in 1901. The lilies, often reaching over two meters in diameter, are grown in an artificial pond at the garden, created in 1825, now known as the Lago Frei Leandro in honor of the 12 DEPOSITIONS\n\nFIGURE 1.1.\n\nNicolas-Antoine Taunay, Passage of the Royal Cortege over the Maracanã Bridge, ca. 1817–1820 Museu Nacional/Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro\n\ngarden’s first director. These two species, the royal palm and the giant water lily, would continue to evoke a vision of a particularly regal Brazilian landscape through the modern period. In 1815 João elevated the colony of Brazil to become part of the new transatlantic United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves. Upon the death of Maria I in 1816, the prince regent became king: Dom João VI would rule the kingdom from a throne in Brazil for the next five years. In addition to the establishment of the Jardim Botânico, Dom João VI created many new cultural institutions to enhance the economic and cultural standing of the former colony (including a publishing house, museum, library, educational institutions, and scientific academies), thus laying the groundwork for what would become the modern Brazilian state. Perhaps the king’s most profound and lasting cultural initiative was his engagement of a number of French artists within his court beginning in 1816, a group known as the constructing culture in brazil 13\n\nFIGURE 1.2.\n\nPaço de São Cristóvão, Quinta da Boa Vista, Rio de Janeiro, ca. 1862 Photo by Augusto Stahl/Instituto Moreira Salles Collection\n\nMissão Artística Francesa (French Artistic Mission). These artists would together establish the Escola Real de Ciências, Artes e Ofícios (Royal School of Sciences, Arts, and Crafts) and an official system of state-supported artistic education.2 This royal patronage of a group of French painters, sculptors, engineers, and the architect Auguste-Henri-Victor Grandjean de Montigny (1776–1850) grew out of Dom João VI’s genuine concern for cultural development in the former colony, which had so rapidly been transformed into the capital of the Portuguese kingdom. All members of the Missão had studied at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris and had been forced into 14 DEPOSITIONS\n\nFIGURE 1.3.\n\nPalma mater at the Jardim Botânico, Rio de Janeiro, 1875 Photo by Alberto Henschel/Acervo da Fundação Biblioteca Nacional do Brasil\n\nFIGURE 1.4.\n\nAllée of royal palms at the Jardim Botânico, Rio de Janeiro, 1885 Photo by Marc Ferrez/Gilberto Ferrez Collection/Instituto Moreira Salles Collection\n\nFIGURE 1.5.\n\nVictoria amazonica at the Jardim Botânico, Rio de Janeiro, ca. 1914 Photo by Antônio Ribeiro/Acervo da Fundação Biblioteca Nacional do Brasil\n\nexile after the fall of Napoleon. The artists brought with them a particularly academic European neoclassical style, but this approach was paired with a contemporaneous European interest in the English picturesque garden in the case of the architect Grandjean de Montigny. His compositional deployment of the picturesque garden as a dynamic counterpoint to the formal neoclassical palace can be seen in his 1808 sketch of the palace and gardens for Jérôme Bonaparte, king of the short-lived Napoleonic realm of Westphalia in northwestern Germany. This interest prefigures the picturesque transformation of several of Rio de Janeiro’s public gardens by another Frenchman fascinated by the jardin à l’anglaise (English garden), Auguste François Marie Glaziou, by over fifty years. Dom João VI sponsored not only a culture of artistic education but also a culture of scientific exploration, reflecting his interest in learning more about and protecting the vast territory of Brazil. Exploration into the interior had occurred in the seventeenth century during the era of Portuguese bandeirantes, adventurers who effectively expanded the colony’s borders in the central and southern hinterlands. In 1783 Queen Maria I sponsored an exploratory scientific, economic, and territorial expedition to the 16 DEPOSITIONS\n\nFIGURE 1.6.\n\nAuguste-Henri-Victor Grandjean de Montigny, sketch of the palace and gardens for Jérôme Bonaparte in Westphalia, Prussia, ca. 1808–1813 Coleção Museu Nacional de Belas Artes/Instituto Brasileiro de Museus/Ministério da Cultura\n\nAmazon and Mato Grosso river basins by the Bahian native Alexandre Rodrigues Ferreira (1756–1815), who had traveled to Portugal to study at the University of Coimbra. The maps, artifacts, and documents of Ferreira’s subsequent nine-year expedition, the Viagem Filosófica (Philosophical Journey), were remitted to Portugal.3 But the territory’s floral wealth was not rigorously collected, documented, and classified until the beginning of the nineteenth century, when Dom João VI opened Brazil to European scientific expeditions in 1816.4 He welcomed the Missão Científica Austríaca (Austrian Scientific Mission) to Brazil in 1817, which joined Archduchess Maria Leopoldina of Austria, the daughter of the first emperor of Austria, as promised bride to Dom João’s son Pedro in a strategic union of new and old worlds. Botanist Carl Friedrich Phillip von Martius (1794–1868) and zoologist Johann Baptist von Spix (1781–1826), the mission’s leaders, commenced a three-year scientific expedition from Rio de Janeiro in 1817, traveling first overland northward through the eastern inland provinces and then westward along the Amazon River to Tabatinga and finally departing for Europe from Belém in 1820. Brazil’s exotic tropical wealth of flora and fauna was collected, classified, and remitted to Europe. Flora brasiliensis, initiated in 1840 by Martius but only completed postmortem in 1902 by his colleagues, was the expedition’s monumental publication, documenting over 8,000 species of native flora with thousands of lithographic prints.5 The work included Martius’s map that classified the country into five ecological or phytogeographic regions as well as over fifty plates illustrating typical landscapes throughout the country. Martius’s private collection of flora specimens, the Herbarium Martii, contained 300,000 specimens at the time of his death, including over 12,000 collected during his scientific mission to Brazil.6\n\nThe Rise of the Empire, 1822–1889 Dom João VI returned to Portugal in 1821 after thirteen years in Brazil, at the demand of liberal revolutionaries in Portugal. He left his son and heir-apparent, Pedro, in Rio de Janeiro to serve as regent of the Kingdom of Brazil. On September 7, 1822, Pedro claimed Brazilian independence from Portugal, declaring himself Emperor Pedro I of Brazil and instituting a constitutional monarchy two years later. Pedro I transformed the Escola Real de Ciências, Artes e Ofícios into the Academia Imperial de Belas Artes (Imperial Academy of Fine Arts) in 1827, appointing Grandjean de Montigny as both the architect of its new building in Rio de Janeiro and the first director of its School of Architecture.7 Grandjean de Montigny’s influence as the only professor to teach architecture at the Academia Imperial, where he served until his death in 1850, is significant. In a climate of rising tensions in Brazil and unrest in Portugal, however, Dom Pedro I abdicated in 1831 and returned to Europe, leaving his five-year-old son, Dom Pedro II, as the emperor of Brazil, under a rule of regents between 1831 and 1840. Pedro II was declared of age in 1841 and ruled as emperor in a political model approaching a parliamentary democracy until 1889, when he was 18 DEPOSITIONS\n\nFIGURE 1.7.\n\nAuguste-Henri-Victor Grandjean de Montigny, Escola Nacional de Belas Artes (formerly Academia Imperial de Belas Artes), Rio de Janeiro, ca. 1891 Photo by Marc Ferrez/Gilberto Ferrez Collection/Instituto Moreira Salles\n\nFIGURE 1.8.\n\nPlan of Mestre Valentim’s Passeio Público, Rio de Janeiro, drawn by Elias Wencesláo Cabral de Mello, ca. 1850 Acervo da Fundação Biblioteca Nacional do Brasil\n\nFIGURE 1.9.\n\nWaterfront belvedere of the Passeio Público, Rio de Janeiro, ca. 1910 Photo by Augusto Malta/Gilberto Ferrez Collection/Instituto Moreira Salles\n\nousted by a bloodless coup that led to the República Velha (Old Republic, also called the First Republic) of Brazil, which would last until 1930. Like those of his father and grandfather before him, Pedro II’s contributions to cultural development in parallel with a deep interest in defining and valorizing the natural world in Brazil were profound. During his reign as emperor, he transformed the Museu Real (Royal Museum) into an internationally regarded scientific research museum, reforested an entire watershed serving Rio de Janeiro’s supply of drinking water, and transformed the urban parks and plazas of Rio through the establishment of the Diretoria de Parques e Jardins da Casa Imperial (Imperial Directorate of Parks and Gardens). For almost fifty years, Pedro II devoted himself to the support of culture, education, and science, building the values of a nation-state that he hoped would ensure its future progress and prosperity.8 Pedro II’s invitation to the French hydraulic engineer and botanist Auguste François Marie Glaziou (1828–1906) to Rio de Janeiro to direct the new agency of the Parques e Jardins da Casa Imperial was an extension of Dom João VI’s interest in French-influenced culture through the patronage of the Missão Artística Francesa. But beyond painting, sculpture, and architecture, Pedro II supported the design of urban public parks at the infrastructural scale of the city. Glaziou arrived in Brazil in 1858 after having worked in Paris with Adolphe Alphand, the designer of the Parc des Buttes-Chaumont and Parc Monceau. In 1860 Glaziou was tasked by Pedro II with the renovation of the Passeio Público, a formal public garden in the historic center of Rio de Janeiro opening up to the waterfront of the Baía de Guanabara. An irregular hexagonal site bounded by the hills of São Bento to the north, the hill of Santo António to the south, and Rua da Vala to the west, the park was commissioned in 1779 by the Portuguese viceroy of colonial Brazil, Luís de Vasconcelos e Sousa, and built in 1783 by the sculptor and architect Valentim da Fonseca e Silva (ca. 1745–1814), known as Mestre Valentim.9 He designed the Passeio Público in the formal French garden style, with an elaborate entrance gate and two octagonal pavilions along the waterfront belvedere, a wide terraced promenade extending the length of the park’s eastern frontage along the Baía de Guanabara. The entrance gate led to orthogonal diagonal allées intersecting within the irregular hexagon-shaped park. The flora within the park was selected for its ability to provide broad expanses of shade from hot tropical sun, with trees including tropical natives such as mango, tamarind, and palms as well as cedars and pines.10 The enclosed park also featured a pond with islands, ornamental sculptural elements, and a fountain adorned with bronze caimans and egrets. Glaziou’s 1860 renovation transformed Valentim’s axial design with the romantic sensibility of an English garden, inserting sinuous planting beds and curving paths. Commentary in the Almanak Laemmert at the time expressed fascination with the park’s novelty: “This plan represents a garden known as ‘English’ or ‘landscape,’ of the style adopted by the most forward-looking civilizations, for its natural and gracious singularity . . . enlarging the horizon to its very limits.”11 constructing culture in brazil 21\n\nFIGURE 1.10.\n\nAuguste François Marie Glaziou, landscape plan for the renovation of the Passeio Público, Rio de Janeiro, ca. 1862 Acervo da Fundação Biblioteca Nacional do Brasil\n\nFIGURE 1.11.\n\nEntrance to the Passeio Público, Rio de Janeiro, ca. 1862 Photo by Augusto Stahl/Instituto Moreira Salles Collection\n\nIn 1869 Glaziou began a renovation of the gardens of the Paço de São Cristóvão at the Quinta da Boa Vista—previously the palace of Dom João VI and Emperor Dom Pedro I and now the imperial residence of his patron, Emperor Dom Pedro II. Glaziou sculpted a picturesque landscape around the palace anchored by a formal central allée of sapucaias (Lecythis pisonis), native Brazilian trees with a spectacular spring display of pink leaves and purple flowers. The allée bisected the grounds into two curvilinear gardens with interconnected lakes and rustic grottos. In 1874 Glaziou initiated a transformation of the Campo de Santana, a former marshland near the historic center of Rio de Janeiro, creating a public park renamed the Campo da Aclamação (Field of Acclamation, now known as the Praça da República) to commemorate its significance as the site of Dom Pedro I’s 1822 proclamation of Brazilian independence.12 Modeled on the great picturesque parks of Paris—Parc Monceau, Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, and the Bois de Boulogne—the park was completed in 1880 and inaugurated by Dom Pedro II himself. Sinuous lines guided the design, and picturesque features were constructed within the park, including large rocks, tunnels, grottos, lakes, and waterfalls.13 constructing culture in brazil 23\n\nFIGURE 1.12.\n\nAuguste François Marie Glaziou, landscape plan of the Quinta da Boa Vista, Rio de Janeiro, 1866 Photo by Caique Bellato/Governo do Estado do Rio de Janeiro/Secretaria de Estado de Cultura/ Fundação Anita Mantuano de Artes do Estado do Rio de Janeiro/Casa da Marquesa de Santos– Museu da Moda Brasileira\n\nIn addition to the construction of these large imperial parks, Glaziou completed the designs of several urban plazas and streetscapes. His beautification program for the Avenida do Mangue and the Largo do Machado from 1869 through 1875 included the planting of native fig and palm species.14 Glaziou often used local tropical flora in his planting schemes, specimens that he had collected himself on numerous botanical expeditions. He maintained a collection of live plants at the imperial summer palace in Petrópolis, a village north of Rio de Janeiro. As the first director of Parques e Jardins, he influenced an impressive line of successors, including Paul Villon, Luiz 24 DEPOSITIONS\n\nFIGURE 1.13.\n\nLake with Ilha dos Amores and the ruins of a temple by Auguste François Marie Glaziou, Quinta da Boa Vista, Rio de Janeiro, ca. 1920 Acervo Arquivo Geral da Cidade do Rio de Janeiro\n\nFIGURE 1.14.\n\nAuguste François Marie Glaziou, Campo da Aclamação with the neoclassical Museu Imperial (left), Rio de Janeiro, 1880 Photo by Marc Ferrez/Acervo da Fundação Biblioteca Nacional do Brasil\n\nEmygdio de Mello Filho, and Fernando Magalhães Chacel. In 1872 Glaziou accompanied Princesa Isabel, the eldest daughter of Dom Pedro II, on a plant-collecting expedition to the massif of Itatiaia, a mountainous region between the cities of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo.15 After gathering plant specimens (including several rare species of ferns), Glaziou later prepared a commemorative book of the plants collected during their expedition, entitled Plantes cueillies sur l’Itatiaia au mois de juillet 1872 and presented it to the princess. Glaziou returned to France in 1897; after his death in 1906, his personal herbarium consisting of over 24,000 Brazilian species was given to the Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle in Paris, France, where Princesa Isabel’s book also resides. Dom Pedro II extended his support of the natural world beyond the urban to the regional scale. He was responsible for the first successful tropical forest restoration at the Floresta da Tijuca in the highlands of the city of Rio de Janeiro from 1860 to 1887. The Floresta da Tijuca, covering over thirty-three square kilometers and ranging in elevation between eighty and one thousand meters above sea level, is today the\n\nFIGURE 1.15.\n\nAuguste François Marie Glaziou, Largo do Machado with the Igreja Nossa Senhora da Glória, Rio de Janeiro, 1906 Photo by Augusto Malta/Instituto Moreira Salles Collection\n\n26 DEPOSITIONS\n\nlargest urban forest in the world, a fragment of the remaining mata atlântica (Atlantic rainforest) biome that extends along the entire Atlantic coast of Brazil.16 Much of the forest had been cut down during the colonial period to establish the extensive coffee and sugar plantations that produced the colony’s major exports along the Tijuca Massif, the ridge highlands that surrounded the city. By the 1820s, with the rapid urban growth that followed the arrival of the Portuguese royal family and court, the region was experiencing serious watershed damage, compounded by droughts that affected Rio de Janeiro’s water supply. Despite the literal translation of its name, “River of January,” no major river serves the city. It was the small streams and waterfalls descending from the Tijuca highlands, principally the Carioca, Comprido, and Maracanã, that first provided the city’s drinking water. The main supply of water was delivered through a large aqueduct, completed in 1732, that carried the waters of a diverted Rio Carioca to a series of public fountains at the center of Rio de Janeiro. Following a particularly severe drought in 1844, a number of tree planting and forest protection measures were begun through the imperial government’s purchase of private lands within the Floresta da Tijuca watershed, but it was not until Dom Pedro II’s issue of an imperial order in 1860 that a massive government replanting effort was begun in the Tijuca and Paineiras forests. A new agency, Secretaria de Estado dos Negócios da Agricultura, Comércio e Obras Públicas (State Department of Agriculture, Commerce, and Public Works) was established in 1860. Almost 100,000 native tree seedlings were planted between 1862 and 1887 by approximately twelve enslaved people working for the department under the directorship of Manuel Gomes Archer. Archer’s systematic planting scheme included combinations of seedlings of many native tree species, often drawn from the nursery plants of the Jardim Botânico.17 In 1874 Archer reported that over 60,000 trees had been successfully planted and stated that more laborers were needed.18 In 1877 his successor, Gastão de Escragnolle, planted over 20,000 more seedlings and engaged Auguste Glaziou to begin the work of transforming the Floresta da Tijuca into a large public park, building access roads, plazas, belvederes, fountains, trails, and bridges. In 1879 Dom Pedro II contracted the engineers Francisco de Paula Bicalho and subsequently Paulo de Frontin and Raimundo Teixeira Belfort Roxo to tap the watershed of the Serra do Tinguá and the Rio São Pedro, reducing the importance of the streams of the Floresta da Tijuca for Rio de Janeiro’s water supply. However, the forest restoration was substantially complete by the time these other sources of drinking water were established, for no significant tree planting was done after 1887. Dom Pedro II reigned as emperor of Brazil for half a century, supporting science, culture, and the exploration of the extents of Brazil. He significantly expanded the collections of the Museu Imperial, first established in 1818 by his grandfather Dom João VI as the Museu Real at the Campo de Santana in Rio de Janeiro. Martius, Spix, Auguste de Saint-Hilaire, Prince Alexander Philipp Maximilian of Wied-Neuwied, and other European explorers invited by Dom João VI and Pedro I had contributed constructing culture in brazil 27\n\nFIGURE 1.16.\n\nWaterfall at the Floresta da Tijuca, Rio de Janeiro, ca. 1885 Photo by Marc Ferrez/Gilberto Ferrez Collection/Instituto Moreira Salles\n\nsignificantly to the museum’s collections. Pedro II enhanced it with anthropological, archaeological, and paleontological findings from his own trips both in Brazil and abroad, including a voyage to Egypt in 1871. He also invited scientists from abroad to work at the museum, establishing a veritable international scientific study center. Pedro II shifted the naturalists’ interest in the tropical novelty of Brazil’s flora and fauna toward a scientific interest in a rich environment and complex ecology that was yet to be fully understood but was appreciated as uniquely and inextricably Brazilian.\n\nThe Entrance of the Republic, 1889–1930 On November 15, 1889, General Manuel Deodoro da Fonseca initiated a military coup at the Campo da Aclamação, the Proclamação da República (Proclamation of the Republic), exiling Dom Pedro II and the imperial family to France and initiating the period known as the República Velha, from 1889 through 1930.19 The Républica Velha would continue until another military coup, the Revolução de 1930 (Revolution of 1930), which installed Getúlio Vargas as Brazil’s president. The new Brazilian Constitution of 1891 renamed the country the República dos Estados Unidos do Brasil (Republic of the United States of Brazil), establishing a somewhat centralized form of federalism that transformed the former provinces into states led by elected governors.20 The transition from empire to Republic led to many radical changes in the leadership of cultural institutions as well as a rising interest in scientific positivism through an educated military elite that encouraged significant new exploration of the country’s vast interior. Nationalism, industrialization, urbanization, immigration, and a developmental vision of expansion and settlement throughout the Brazilian territory—all with significant impact on natural resources— increased rapidly during the period of the República Velha. One of the most significant elements of the Constitution of 1891 was its third article, which suggested that the capital of Brazil be moved from Rio de Janeiro to a more central location on the country’s interior plateau—predating the construction of Brasília by more than sixty years. But this vision of an interior capital was not new. In 1883 the mystical Italian priest Giovanni Melchiorre Bosco, popularly known as Dom Bosco, had recorded his dream of an inconceivably rich land in central Brazil, between the fifteenth and twentieth latitudes, noting that “there will appear in this place the Promised Land, flowing with milk and honey.”21 Even earlier, José Bonifácio, advisor to the emperor Pedro I, had suggested in 1827 that a new city named Brasília be established to the west of the densely settled Atlantic coast. Responding to the 1891 Constitution’s directive to demarcate the territory of this future federal capital, two state-supported expeditions to the central highlands of Brazil were established by Congress, first the 1892 Comissão Exploradora do Planalto Central do Brasil (Commission to Explore the Central Plateau of Brazil) then the 1894 Comissão de Estudos da Nova Capital da União (Commission to Study the New Capital of the constructing culture in brazil 29\n\nUnion). The goal of the two missions, led by the Belgian-born astronomer Luíz Cruls (1848–1908), the director of the National Observatory, was to plat a 160-kilometer by 90-kilometer rectangle on the high central plateau of Brazil, capturing the sources of the three major Brazilian river basins: the Amazon, the São Francisco, and the Paraná. Within this “Quadrilátero Cruls,” subsequently included on every national map until 1956, would rise the future capital city of Brasília at the Distrito Federal.22\n\nFIGURE 1.17.\n\nMap of Brazil indicating the location of the “Quadrilátero Cruls” at the Planalto Central, 1893 Luíz Cruls, Relatorio parcial apresentado ao ministro da indústria, viação e obras públicas (Rio de Janeiro: H.

In his 1894 report to Cruls, Glaziou wrote admiringly of the rich diversity of the cerrado (tropical savanna) species endemic to this ecoregion of the central plateau. In addition he suggested the creation of an artificial lake to ease the elevated central plateau’s dryness, which was realized years later during the implementation of Brasília with the construction of a dam across the Rio Paranoá and the subsequent formation of Lago Paranoá.23 The República Velha continued to embrace education, science, and culture as state concerns, though they were now imbued with an especially nationalist spirit. In 1890 Grandjean de Montigny’s Academia Imperial de Belas Artes was renamed the Escola Nacional de Belas Artes (ENBA: National School of Fine Arts). Though the school remained aesthetically eclectic, nationalist proponents of a particularly Brazilian neocolonial style of architecture had emerged by the early twentieth century, presented as an appropriate alternative to the dominant European neoclassical style. The leading advocate of the neocolonial in Rio de Janeiro was José Marianno Filho (1881–1946), a wealthy aristocrat and architectural critic trained as a physician. Though he never taught courses at the ENBA, Marianno Filho was its director from constructing culture in brazil 31\n\n1926 to 1927. Several years earlier, he had promoted two architectural competitions for students, Casa Brasileira (Brazilian House) in 1921 and Solar Brasileira (Brazilian Manor) in 1924. The young Lúcio Costa, graduating from ENBA in 1924, was awarded a prize in the second competition. This began his mentorship by Marianno Filho, who would sponsor his first visit to the colonial mining towns in the state of Minas Gerais. Costa would immerse himself in neocolonial theory, though he would soon rupture this affiliation and his relationship with Marianno Filho, emerging as one of the proponents of the new vanguard of Brazilian modernism in the 1930s, along with other ENBA students such as Cândido Portinari, Oscar Niemeyer, and Roberto Burle Marx.24 In the realm of science, the República Velha renamed Pedro II’s beloved Museu Imperial as the Museu Nacional. Its holdings were transferred from their original building at the Campo de Santana to the vacated imperial palace at the Quinta da Boa Vista, now named the Palácio de São Cristóvão. Science had replaced the emperor. Ladislau de Souza Mello e Netto, the museum’s director since 1874, retained his position during this transition of power, but many of the foreign scientists once welcomed at the museum were dismissed in a mood of nationalist retrenchment. Leadership at the Jardim Botânico was also reconfigured with the 1890 appointment of João Barbosa Rodrigues as director. The Jardim Botânico was transformed into an important scientific research institution during his directorship between 1890 and 1892 and again from 1903 until 1909. Barbosa Rodrigues augmented the garden’s collection of live plants and addressed the necessity of conservation, particularly for native Brazilian species. A specialist in Brazilian palms, he founded a herbarium, museum, and library at the garden and published an influential reference work on the palm species of Brazil, entitled Sertum palmarum brasiliensium. The Jardim Botânico served as host to a number of traveling expeditions, many led by European scientists, dispatched to expand the garden’s collection of Brazilian plants. Despite their frequent involvement of European scientists, the Jardim Botânico’s exploratory expeditions were becoming a particularly Brazilian endeavor, in which the state sought to integrate the vast hinterlands of the new Republic. In parallel with a massive wave of immigration, rapid urbanization, and increased industrialization, especially in the southern regions of Brazil, the country’s natural wealth was positioned as part of its new modern identity. No longer merely the object of a curious emperor’s scientific interests, these resources defined Brazil’s identity. In 1906 the Ministério da Agricultura, Indústria e Comércio (Ministry of Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce) was established, and the scientific institutions of the Museu Nacional and the Jardim Botânico were placed under its purview. In 1907 this new ministry joined forces with the positivist Ministério da Guerra (Ministry of War) for an exploratory joint venture, the Comissão de Linhas Telegráficas Estratégicas de Mato Grosso ao Amazonas (CLTEMTA: Commission for a Strategic Telegraph Line from Mato Grosso to Amazonas). It was placed under the leadership of 1st Lt. 32 DEPOSITIONS\n\nFIGURE 1.19.\n\nCarta ethnographica da Rondônia, showing the path of the telegraph line connecting Cuiabá to Santo Antônio, 1917 Edgar Roquette-Pinto, Rondônia: Anthropologia—Ethnographia, Archivos do Museu Nacional do Rio de Janeiro, vol. 20 (Rio de Janeiro: Imprensa Nacional, 1917)\n\nCândido Mariano da Silva Rondon (1865–1958) of the Corpo de Engenheiros Militares, appointed by President Afonso Pena. The nine-year project, extending from 1907 to 1916, became known as the Comissão Rondon. The purpose of the commission was to construct a telegraph line between the cities of Cuiabá in the state of Mato Grosso and Santo Antônio do Rio Madeiro (now Porto Velho) in the state of Amazonas. It was envisioned that the peoples and territories of the faraway hinterlands of Brazil (the sertão) would thus be incorporated into the Republic, transforming what had developed as a coastal nation governed by urban Rio de Janeiro. However, the expedition was not planned merely to lay a telegraph line between the states of Mato Grosso and Amazonas. It was also a scientific expedition, this time conducted by Brazilians for the purposes of understanding and unifying their vast country, particularly the westernmost reaches of the Amazon basin and the northern sertão. The botanist Frederico Carlos Hoehne (1882–1959), then the head gardener at the Museu Nacional, joined the Comissão Rondon from 1908 through 1909, identifying and collecting fifty-eight new plant species.25 His role as the expedition’s botanist was very similar to Auguste Glaziou’s during the Missão Cruls expeditions of 1892 and 1894. The Comissão Rondon also studied areas of the sertão that might be suitable\n\nFIGURE 1.20.\n\nThe Comissão Rondon, clearing a path for roads and telegraph line connections, Mato Grosso, ca. 1910 Photo by Argentina Reis/Acervo do Museu do Índio/Fundação Nacional do Índio, Brasil\n\n34 DEPOSITIONS\n\nfor colonization, agriculture, and grazing. As part of his team’s scientific activity, Rondon collected rich visual data, particularly on the indigenous peoples of Mato Grosso, through its innovative Cinematography and Photography Section, led by Maj. Thomaz Reis.26 This spirit of scientific inquiry evident in the intellectual atmosphere generated by the military-led Comissão Rondon reflected the growing influence of positivism throughout military academies during the República Velha.27 Positivism, developed by the French philosopher Auguste Comte in the 1820s, was widely adopted in Latin America and particularly popular in Brazil. By the early 1880s, when the Igreja Positivista do Brasil (Positivist Church of Brazil) was founded, Comte’s ideas were seen as particularly attractive within Brazil’s technical schools and military academies, where many of the rising middle class were being educated. The emphasis on the idea of progress and development through a measured, rational methodology of economic development appealed to this new elite as the means through which Brazil might end colonial domination and achieve economic independence.28 Positivism embraced strategies of technical progress and modernization, particularly the construction of railroads and industrialization. Appropriately, the motto on the new flag raised by the República Velha was “Ordem e Progresso” (Order and Progress)—the positivist creed of Comte—which embraced this vision of advancement through the rational work of science.29 The positivists also embraced nature as part of this scientific and rational world view. Alberto Torres (1865–1917), an intellectual and politician whose advocacy for a strong interventionist state would be influential in destabilizing the elites toward the end of the República Velha, was one of the first Brazilians to address the topic of the conservation of nature.30 In his 1915 book As fontes da vida no Brasil, he states: “Civilization has a duty to conserve the unexploited resources of the earth, reserves destined for future generations, and to defend those which are in production against improvident exploitation, just as it has a duty to protect all races and nationalities against forms of competition that might threaten their vital interests, as well as the security, property, and prosperity of their posterity.”31 His political ideas were adopted by Getúlio Vargas and other leaders of the Revolução de 1930, who emphasized the importance of a strong state to achieve national unity. Given the context of rapid industrialization and immigration, the task of defining a shared conception of modern national identity during the República Velha was a vexing one for the Brazilian elite. More than 2.6 million immigrants who arrived in Brazil between 1890 and 1919 (a rural labor force that immigrated after the 1888 abolition of slavery) set to work with the fazendeiros, the large estate owners growing coffee, sugar, and cotton for export. An ideology of branqueamento, the so-called whitening of the nation, was supported through a national policy that supported and subsidized European immigration.32 But subsequent economic growth also led to rapid urban development and industrialization.

The oligarchs of the agricultural estates of São Paulo and Minas Gerais and the regime of “café com leite” (coffee with milk) gradually lost power to an industrializing São Paulo.33 With this urban industrialization and a rising immigrant working class, Brazil saw the emergence of trade unions, strikes, discontent with the oligarchy, and the establishment of the Communist Party in 1922. Thus the concept of brasilidade (Brazilianness) emerged as part of these modernizing processes. A concern of both the upper classes of ruling elites and cultural intellectuals, it is both discriminatory and inclusive in regard to the growing immigrant population. As a positioning of identity, brasilidade oscillated between poles of a fixed essence and an ongoing, transformable construct.34 Critical posturing of brasilidade grew from a festival of avant-garde art and literature held at the Theatro Municipal in São Paulo in 1922, the Semana de Arte Moderna (Modern Art Week), featuring the artists and poets Emiliano di Cavalcanti, Anita Malfatti, Mário de Andrade, and Oswald de Andrade. The collective was later joined by the painter Tarsila do Amaral. This vanguard proved influential on the São Paulo architect Gregori Warchavchik as well as his wife Mina Klabin, whose designs for cactus gardens provided the appropriate foil of color and texture to the abstract cubic volumes of Warchavchik’s modern villas.35 The hero of this self-conscious search for a modern Brazilian cultural identity, which looked as much to the folklore and flora of the Brazilian countryside as to the urban elite, was a compelling character named Macunaíma, the shape-shifting hero of the 1928 novel of the same name by Mário de Andrade.36 Macunaíma represented a blended possibility for the construction of brasilidade—a semiwild jungle boy embodying the three Brazilian peoples (African, Indian, and Iberian)—several years before Gilberto Freyre’s 1933 publication of Casa-grande e senzala, celebrating the racial and cultural miscegenation practiced by the Portuguese in Brazil, who had their own mixed heritage of North African Arabs and Sephardic Jews.37 Another key text of the São Paulo modernists was Oswald de Andrade’s 1928 Manifesto antropófago, an argument for a metaphorical cultural cannibalism: anthropophagy. Drawing from the 1554 incident in which the first bishop of Brazil, Pedro Fernandes Sardinha, was eaten by the Tupi Caeté tribe, the modernists interpreted the consumption of the priest not as a slaughter but as the tribe’s assimilation of the virtues of the “other.” Likewise, the modernists argued for a metaphorical cannibalism and assimilation of both inherited Western culture and New World knowledge.38 Brasilidade was also driven by the cultural observations and critiques of Europeans, including the poet Blaise Cendrars, the architect Le Corbusier, and the anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss.39 The manifesto’s witty phrase “Only Cannibalism unites us . . . Tupi, or not Tupi, that is the question” became the mantra of a generation of vanguard artists and writers. This cultural argument influenced constructing culture in brazil 37\n\nthe development of a particularly Brazilian modernist identity in the work of many architects as well, including Gregori Warchavchik, Lúcio Costa, Oscar Niemeyer, and Affonso Eduardo Reidy, and would emerge in the rich oeuvre of the landscape architect Roberto Burle Marx as well.40\n\nThe Vargas Era, 1930–1945 The rise of Getúlio Vargas (1882–1954), a former governor of the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul who would become Brazil’s longest serving president, led the success­ful Revolução de 1930 that brought an end to the República Velha. The revolution, a military coup deposing President Washington Luís, was supported by discontented sectors of the military and civilian Brazilian population during the Republic’s waning years. The growing urban bourgeoisie, dissatisfied with the political power of the elite landowners from the states of São Paulo and Minas Gerais, was calling for democratic changes and was supported by oppositional military movements that rose from within the officers’ corps of the army and navy.41 Vargas led the military junta that took control in 1930 and remained in power through 1945. He sought to continue the economic, industrial, and agricultural growth of the country through a strong centralized state, with a renewed interest in the development of the vast interior. His leadership consisted of three successive phases. From 1930 to 1934 Vargas governed by decree as the head of the Provisional Government, pending the adoption of a new Constitution. During the second period of the Constitution of 1934, from 1934 to 1937, Vargas governed as president, sharing power with a democratically elected legislature. The third phase, the Estado Novo (New State) period from 1937 to 1945, was initiated by a coup, after which Vargas imposed a new authoritarian Constitution and shut down Congress, assuming dictatorial powers. His deposition from power in 1945 and the subsequent redemocratization of Brazil with yet another Constitution in 1946 marked the end of the Vargas era and the beginning of a democratic period that would last until the military coup of 1964. During the first years after the 1930 revolution, Vargas sought to merge the urbanized coastal regions with the vast hinterland sertão, bringing modernizing projects and social services to the country’s farthest reaches. But this unifying ambition, particularly in Brazil’s tropical forest region, was greatly hindered by disease, particularly mosquito-borne malaria. Interior expansion and colonization were thus dependent on the reduction of disease. This led to Vargas’s establishment of a new ministry on November 14, 1930: the Ministério da Educação e Saúde Pública (Ministry of Education and Public Health), joining the existing Ministério da Guerra and Ministério da Agricultura, Indústria e Comércio—the two agencies responsible for the Comissão Rondon during the República Velha.42 Echoing the Comissão Rondon telegraph project, Vargas unified and centralized the post office and telegraph sectors 38 DEPOSITIONS\n\nFIGURE 1.23.\n\nMinistério da Educação e Saúde building under construction, Rio de Janeiro, ca. 1938 Arquivo Gustavo Capanema/ Fundação Getúlio Vargas, Centro de Pesquisa e Documentação/ Fundação Oscar Niemeyer © 2023 Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York/AUTVIS, São Paulo FIGURE 1.24.\n\nGustavo Capanema (third from left) and Getúlio Vargas (fourth from left) at the minister’s private roof garden with Celso Antônio’s sculpture Moça reclinada during the opening celebrations of the Ministério da Educação e Saúde, Rio de Janeiro, 1944 Arquivo Gustavo Capanema/ Fundação Getúlio Vargas, Centro de Pesquisa e Documentação/ Fundação Oscar Niemeyer © 2023 Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York/AUTVIS, São Paulo\n\nin 1931, establishing the Departamento de Correios e Telégrafos (Department of Post and Telegraphs). In 1934 Vargas appointed the charismatic and progressive intellectual Gustavo Capanema (1900–1985) as his second minister of education and public health, who would serve until the end of the Vargas era in 1945. Capanema’s vanguard leadership at the ministry established complex links among science, nature, education, health, and culture.43 Vargas’s state support of the pedagogical mission of the Ministério da Educação e Saúde Pública (MES) was reflected in his acceptance of Capanema’s visionary commissioning of modern architects for significant public buildings, projecting a progressive image of Brazilian modernity and culture onto an international stage.44 The architectural projects sponsored by the MES—the ministry’s own new headquarters building in Rio de Janeiro, the project for a new University of Brazil, and the Brazilian Pavilion of the 1939 New York World’s Fair, among others—embraced the notion that architecture and indeed nature could be mobilized both operationally and expressively to support a cultural construct. They drew from the unifying principles of the International Style while transforming it through a particularly Brazilian concern for formal diversity.45 In parallel with Capanema’s ambitious modern building program, Vargas executed two extremely important pieces of conservationist and preservationist legislation that would prove critical to future environmental movements in Brazil: the Código Florestal Brasileiro (Brazilian Forestry Code) in 1934 and the Serviço do Patrimônio Histórico e Artístico Nacional (SPHAN: Department of National Historic and Artistic Heritage) in 1937.46 These two legislative acts continued to evolve from their initiation during the Vargas era through the military dictatorship that began in 1964 and would become the legal anchors for Burle Marx’s later arguments for environmental and cultural conservation and protection. Vargas’s outreach to the hinterlands did not only concern economic development, access to resources, and strategic border protection. His government supported the conservation of natural areas as part of a greater modernizing project, with the Código Florestal Brasileiro as a catalyst that led to the designation of the country’s first national park in 1937. Lúcio Costa (1902–1998), the architect, urban planner, and mentor to a young Roberto Burle Marx, was a significant figure in the modernization program implemented by Vargas. In December 1930 the first minister of the Ministério da Educação e Saúde Pública, Francisco Campos, appointed the 29-year-old Costa, a 1924 graduate of the Escola Nacional de Belas Artes, as the new director of the school. From this pedagogical platform Costa confirmed his radical break with the neocolonial style supported by José Marianno Filho, abandoning eclecticism in favor of the new European “International Style” modernism.47 He also proposed that courses in urbanism and landscape be taught at the school; throughout his career, Costa was a staunch defender of the integration of architecture and the landscape. He also argued for the establishment of a distinct school of architecture, separate from the ENBA. 40 DEPOSITIONS\n\nFIGURE 1.25.\n\nRoberto Burle Marx, roof garden of the Alfredo Schwartz residence by architects Lúcio Costa and Gregori Warchavchik, Rio de Janeiro, 1932 Acervo Lúcio Costa and Acervo Gregori Warchavchik/Biblioteca da Faculdade de Arquitetura e Urbanismo, Universidade de São Paulo\n\nHe invited the São Paulo architect Gregori Warchavchik to teach the architecture course at the school. The two men formed an architectural practice in Rio de Janeiro for three years, employing the young Oscar Niemeyer and commissioning Burle Marx’s first garden, the roof terrace of their Casa Schwartz in Copacabana in 1932, with its echoes of Mina Klabin’s cactus gardens. However, Costa’s tenure at the ENBA lasted less than one year before he was forced out in September 1931 by the conservative faculty, who deplored the radical new modernist curricular approach that he constructing culture in brazil 41\n\nsought for the staid institution. The students—including Roberto Burle Marx and the architects Oscar Niemeyer, Affonso Eduardo Reidy, Carlos Leão, and Jorge Moreira— went on strike in support of Costa, but he would never return to ENBA to teach. In 1936 Costa was commissioned by Capanema to work on two significant projects for Rio de Janeiro: the new headquarters building for the Ministério da Educaçao e Saúde Pública and a new campus for the Universidade do Brasil, a proposed transformation of the existing Universidade do Rio de Janeiro that would unify its many separate schools and faculties. The proposed site for the new university campus was the former imperial palace grounds at the Quinta da Boa Vista.48 At Costa’s suggestion, Capanema invited the internationally known Swiss modernist architect CharlesÉdouard Jeanneret (known as Le Corbusier), who had lectured at ENBA in 1929, to come to Brazil from Paris in 1936 to consult with the local Brazilian architectural teams for both projects. Though the project for the University of Brazil at the Quinta da Boa Vista was abandoned, the ministry headquarters in the Castelo district of downtown Rio de Janeiro would become one of the most important modern buildings in Latin America, celebrated internationally as the featured building of the 1943 “Brazil Builds” exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, New York. The Serviço do Patrimônio Histórico e Artístico Nacional (SPHAN) was established in 1937 by Vargas’s Decreto-Lei No. 25 under the jurisdiction of the Ministério da Educação e Saúde Pública, an agency that would provide a legal mechanism for classifying and protecting the country’s cultural heritage.49 In 1937 Capanema appointed Rodrigo Mello Franco de Andrade (1898–1969) as the first director of SPHAN. Costa would participate in SPHAN as well: in addition to his ongoing architectural work commissioned by Capanema, Mello Franco de Andrade appointed Costa as a specialized regional research technician for SPHAN in 1939. In 1946 Costa was designated the national director of the Divisão de Estudos e Tombamento (Division of Research and Registration)—a position that he would maintain until 1972. Costa brought a deep knowledge and appreciation of colonial architecture along with an impassioned support of Brazilian modernism. Together, Mello Franco de Andrade and Costa shaped a consistent vision of Brazilian cultural heritage for decades. Decreto-Lei No. 25 broadly defined Brazil’s historic and artistic patrimony as “those assets, moveable or immovable . . . whose conservation is of public interest due to their exceptional value.”50 It instituted four registration books (livros do tombo) to list these assets by category. Significantly, in its description of the national patrimony, Decreto-Lei No. 25 explicitly cites natural monuments and remarkable landscapes— immovable assets—as worthy of conservation and protection. This law is particularly noteworthy because it acknowledged the importance of the environment within the frame of cultural patrimony—a notion that Burle Marx would build upon years later as a cultural counselor.\n\n42 DEPOSITIONS\n\nGood Neighbors: The Brazilian Pavilion In 1938, during the ongoing development of the new headquarters building of the Ministério da Educação e Saúde Pública and the campus of the University of Brazil, a new competition was launched by the Ministério do Trabalho, Indústria e Comércio (Ministry of Labor, Industry, and Commerce).51 For Vargas, the Pavilhão Brasileiro (Brazilian Pavilion) for the 1939 New York World’s Fair had the potential to propagate an aura of Brazilian cultural and economic wealth to an interested North American audience.52 With the Axis powers on the rise in Germany and Italy, Franklin D. Roosevelt was courting Vargas with the United States’ “Good Neighbor” policy in South America. In Vargas’s political revolution of 1937 he evoked fear of a Communist threat, dissolved the legislative Congress, and imposed a new authoritarian Constitution, shifting his presidency to a veritable dictatorial regime: the Estado Novo. Despite Roosevelt’s recognition of Vargas’s authoritarianism, Brazil’s allegiance to the Allies was critical for the development of a Pan-American political bloc. Though Vargas’s architectural taste was eclectic, the jury for the pavilion competition—composed of members of the Ministério do Trabalho and the Instituto de Arquitetos do Brasil (Institute of Architects of Brazil)—embraced modernist architecture over the neocolonial style for this World’s Fair, with its theme of “The World of Tomorrow.” The selection criterion was described as “an architectural form capable of translating an expression of the Brazilian environment.”53 Lúcio Costa, who received the first prize for his pavilion’s “espírito de brasilidade” (Brazilian spirit),\n\nFIGURE 1.26.\n\nLúcio Costa, perspective sketch of the courtyard and lily pond from his competition entry for the Pavilhão Brasileiro, New York World’s Fair Exhibition, 1938 Acervo Lúcio Costa\n\nconstructing culture in brazil 43\n\nFIGURE 1.27.\n\nLúcio Costa and Oscar Niemeyer, plans of their collaborative project for the Pavilhão Brasileiro, New York World’s Fair Exhibition, 1939 Acervo Lúcio Costa and Fundação Oscar Niemeyer/Digital Image © The Museum of Modern Art/ Licensed by SCALA/Art Resource, New York and © 2017 Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York/ AUTVIS, São Paulo\n\nelected to collaborate with Oscar Niemeyer (1907–2012), the second-place winner. Located on a curved rectangular site in Flushing Meadows, a former wetland and ash dump in Queens, New York, their pavilion consisted of a gently curved L-shaped two-story structure with a sweeping ramp leading to the second level of the building’s exhibition hall. The pavilion was later described by Philip Goodwin in the Museum of Modern Art’s 1943 Brazil Builds exhibition catalogue as “light-heartedly elegant,” with “fluid space treatment and fresh detail.”54 Yet what Costa evoked most skillfully in his own competition entry and with Niemeyer in the final pavilion was an integration of the landscape and tropical climate into this iteration of a distinctly Brazilian and state-supported vision of modernist architecture. The pavilion’s architecture aimed to express a particularly Brazilian modernism with its gentle curves, the use of operable quebra-sol (sun shade) panels along the south façade, evocative of the intense tropical sun, and its floor-to-ceiling glazing of the double-height interior exhibition hall facing the courtyard, creating a transparent connection between indoor and outdoor space. Perhaps most significantly, the courtyard evoked a tropical paradise, echoing the long Brazilian history of the neoclassical palace set within a dynamic picturesque garden. The garden, even in Costa’s first competition entry, was anchored by a free-form amoeboid pond with aquatic plants, including the famed Victoria amazonica giant water lilies, along with an orchid house, an aviary with tropical birds, an aquarium with tropical fish, and a dramatic snake pit.55 The snake pit and orchid house were not built, but the astonishing presence of the giant water lilies in this former marshland in Queens evoked the majesty of the Amazon region and native Brazilian vegetation. Burle Marx did not participate in the design of the gardens of the Pavilhão Brasileiro, though by 1938 he was beginning work in Rio de Janeiro with Costa on the roof and plaza gardens of the Ministério da Educação e Saúde Pública. Nevertheless, he would certainly have been aware of the New York project, not only because of his close association with Costa but also because of his brother Walter Burle Marx’s participation as the director of the pavilion’s musical programming. The pavilion’s gardens were drawn by the American landscape architect Thomas Drees Price (1901–1989). Price was born in Brazil to missionary parents and later emigrated to the United States, where he studied landscape architecture. In 1932 he was recruited to work at the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, where he was subsequently appointed a staff member for the 1939 World’s Fair Commission. As Price was considered a Brazilian landscape architect at the Parks Department, he was selected to work with the Brazilian architects on the development of plans for the gardens of the Pavilhão Brasileiro. The exhibition content of the Pavilhão Brasileiro emphasized the Estado Novo’s nationalist modernizing project of integrating the extents of Brazil’s territory and consolidating the wealth of its natural resources. The country’s commodity production was showcased, with elements of the mining industry—large samples of nickel, constructing culture in brazil 45\n\nchrome, and iron ore—placed at the base of a large bust of Vargas. The pavilion also included exhibits about Brazil’s vast forests, particularly the stands of native Brazilian pine, Araucaria angustifolia, reputed for its excellent timber and paper pulp production. The “luxury woods” of Brazil were also described, including Brazilian walnut (Ocotea porosa), Brazilian rosewood (Dalbergia nigra), and ipê-peroba (Paratecoma peroba), noting that these hardwood forest commodities would be valuable exports to the United States and other foreign partners. Mineral, timber, and rubber exports were particularly desirable for the Allies’ ongoing war effort.56 Yet more and more Brazilians were concerned with the consequences of this rapid modernization, extractive mining, and forest exploitation: a nascent conservationist movement was growing. Meanwhile, Roosevelt’s efforts to gain Brazil’s support of the Allies in World War II through the Good Neighbor policy would prove successful—Vargas reversed his neutral stance in 1941, agreeing to align with any continental American nation in the event of attack.\n\nFIGURE 1.28.\n\nLúcio Costa and Oscar Niemeyer, lily pond of the Pavilhão Brasileiro, New York World’s Fair Exhibition, 1939 Photo by Fay S.

In August 1942 Vargas joined the Allies in declaring war on the Axis powers after the sinking of Brazilian merchant ships by German submarines. However, Brazil’s participation in the war strengthened popular pressure against the Estado Novo regime in favor of redemocratization and free elections. Vargas was not able to retain sufficient support for the continuation of his authoritarian presidency and was deposed by his own military in a surprise coup on October 29, 1945. After Vargas’s regime was overthrown, Brazil entered into a democratic period that would last until 1964. In 1946 Gen. Eurico Gaspar Dutra was elected president for a five-year term and the country’s fifth Constitution was adopted, marking the return to democracy. Vargas would return a second time to the presidency in 1951 through a democratic election, and he embraced a new program of economic developmentalism based on the establishment of state-owned industrial monopolies. Due to increasing constructing culture in brazil 47\n\npopular dissatisfaction with his presidency, he ended his political career with a bullet to the heart in 1954, leaving a dramatic suicide note and an indelible legacy. Brazil experienced a period of rapid economic growth during Juscelino Kubitschek’s five-year presidency, beginning in 1956 and culminating with the inauguration of the new central capital of Brasília, inscribed into the landscape of Brazil’s central plateau, in 1960. With the transfer of the federal capital to Brasília, Rio de Janeiro lost some of its political and cultural clout, while São Paulo continued to rise as a cultural capital, a trajectory that had begun in the 1950s with the state and municipal support of museums, parks, and the new biennial art and architecture exhibitions at Parque do Ibirapuera. Meanwhile, Rio restructured itself as the Estado da Guanabara (State of Guanabara), the designation of the city from 1960 to 1975. Again the state and municipal government initiated the large landfill project of the Parque do Flamengo, with Burle Marx’s public gardens transforming the waterfront of the Baía de Guanabara. But, following Kubitschek, the institutional crises prompted by the rapid presidential succession of Jânio Quadros, Ranieri Mazzilli, and João Goulart were coupled with high inflation and popular discontent. These factors, along with the support of the United States government and its embassy in Brazil, led to the successful Brazilian military coup of March 31, 1964.\n\nFIGURE 1.30.\n\nAerial view of the Esplanada dos Ministérios, Brasília, ca. 1958 Photo by Mario Fontenelle/Arquivo Público do Distrito Federal/Fundação Oscar Niemeyer © 2023 Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York/AUTVIS, São Paulo\n\n48 DEPOSITIONS\n\nFIGURE 1.31.\n\nLandfill construction at Parque do Flamengo, Rio de Janeiro, ca. 1961 Photo by Marcel Gautherot/Instituto Moreira Salles Collection\n\nconstructing culture in brazil 49\n\nThe Military Regime, 1964–1985 Marshal Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco was selected by the Congress to serve as the first president of the military regime after the 1964 coup and would serve through March 1967. During the first years of the dictatorship that would last until 1985, intense economic growth was spurred by the regime. But this so-called milagre econômico brasileiro (Brazilian Miracle) was enabled not only by the government’s heavy investment in infrastructure and energy production but also by a new Constitution that stifled freedom of speech and political opposition. The military’s hard-line stance on popular dissent resulted in the censorship, torture, imprisonment, and deportation of thousands of Brazilian citizens. Nonetheless, during this time, the regime continued the pattern of state-supported nationalist culture, with the establishment of a new Conselho Federal de Cultura (Federal Council of Culture) as an elite civilian advisory counsel to the recently renamed Ministério da Educação e Cultura (Ministry of Education and Culture).\n\nThe Council Though a first Conselho Nacional de Cultura (National Council of Culture) had been established in 1938 under Vargas, it had been largely dormant since 1945. It was revived on February 23, 1961, during the brief presidency of Jânio Quadros with Decreto-Lei No. 50.293, consisting of a council of twenty-nine members, but was suspended for political reasons in 1964 by the military regime.57 Under Castelo Branco’s presidency, the council was reconfigured as the Conselho Federal de Cultura (Federal Council of Culture) on November 21, 1966, with Decreto-Lei No. 74 and would henceforth consist of twenty-four counselors appointed by the president of the Republic to one of four separate councils, each representing a specialty subject area—arts, letters, social sciences, and national historic and artistic patrimony.58 The counselors, given the task to “formulate a national culture policy,” were to be “eminent personalities of Brazilian culture and of well-known repute.”59 Like Vargas’s original Conselho Nacional de Cultura, this Conselho Federal de Cultura was organized by the Ministério da Educação e Cultura and served a greater intellectual project of formulating a unified state-sponsored national culture. During the military dictatorship that began in the 1960s, however, the traditional conception of culture was overlaid with a new nationalism designed to suppress the radical artistic production critical of the regime. In February 1967 the Conselho Federal de Cultura was inaugurated by President Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco.60 Appointed as a member of the Câmara de Artes (Arts Council), Roberto Burle Marx served actively on the council from 1967 through 1974 alongside other well-known members of the Brazilian cultural elite, including sociologist Gilberto Freyre, novelists Rachel de Queiroz and João\n\n50 DEPOSITIONS\n\nGuimarães Rosa, and the art historian Rodrigo Mello Franco de Andrade, the former director of SPHAN, the public agency responsible for the protection of Brazil’s historic and artistic heritage.61 By then the concept of “culture” had been embedded into the very structures and personages of the government. The Palácio da Cultura (Palace of Culture) was the new name given to Lúcio Costa’s landmark building of the Ministério da Educaçao e Saúde Pública upon the transfer of this ministry to the new federal capital of Brasília in 1960. The name of the ministry itself was changed in 1967 to the Ministério da Educaçao e Cultura after the health division had been extracted into its own agency. The minister himself was accordingly renamed the minister of education and culture. During frequent meetings at the Palácio da Cultura in Rio de Janeiro, the Conselho Federal de Cultura acted in an advisory and consultative role to the minister of education and culture, supporting cultural programming and awarding funding and grants to both public and private cultural institutions. The twenty-four counselors had dissimilar allegiances and motivations for accepting their appointments, but each had a certain authority within a particular field—in the case of Roberto Burle Marx, this was in the realm of the natural and constructed Brazilian landscape. In this respect, he was a unique figure on the council, which focused on traditional artistic realms of cultural production. Burle Marx’s advocacy as counselor shifted well beyond cultural support to embrace the realm of environmental protection and even activism—positions clearly indicated in the council’s published record of his depositions. The counselors were a highly productive group and met often. As part of its mandate in Decreto-Lei No. 74, the Ministério da Educação e Cultura published a journal of the council’s meeting minutes: Cultura was launched in July 1967 as a monthly periodical and was renamed Boletim do Conselho Federal de Cultura in 1971 and published quarterly. Both publications provide an invaluable record of the work of the council. Each of the issues included the full bureaucratic proceedings of the meetings, including the official opinions (“Pareceres”), minutes of the legislative and funding votes of the full plenary sessions (“Atas”), and reprints of reports of the council’s work appearing in the Brazilian media (“Noticiário”). The richest part of these journals, however, was the section entitled “Estudos e proposições,” a record of the consular depositions written by the members of the council and orated at the plenary sessions. The transcriptions of these carefully constructed position pieces offer a fascinating insight into the specific interests and passions of the individual counselors and together illuminate the construction of a national cultural identity during the most oppressive years of the military dictatorship. In addition to the proceedings of the meetings published in Cultura and Boletim do Conselho Federal de Cultura, the council also produced a quarterly publication entitled the Revista Brasileira de Cultura, intended to disseminate the work of the counselors to the general public.62 It also published the comprehensive Atlas cultural constructing culture in brazil 51\n\nFIGURE 1.32.\n\nCover of Cultura 4, no. 39 (September 1970) Acervo da Fundação Biblioteca Nacional do Brasil\n\ndo Brasil along with over thirty additional books authored by individual counselors, addressing particular aspects of national culture.63 While serving as a member of the Conselho Federal de Cultura, Burle Marx delivered a total of seventeen depositions to the plenary council between 1967 and 1973, each published in Cultura or Boletim do Conselho Federal de Cultura. In addition, he wrote one longer deposition for the Revista Brasileira de Cultura, entitled “Jardim e ecologia” (Garden and Ecology), published in the first issue in July–September 1969. Burle Marx delivered his last plenary deposition to the Conselho Federal de Cultura in July 1973 and officially stepped down from the position of counselor in 1974 after seven years of service. His departure was timely. The power of the Conselho Federal de Cultura was significantly reduced by the end of 1972 with the approval of the Política Nacional de Cultura (National Culture Policy), which claimed the executive authority of the Conselho Federal de Cultura and reduced it to a purely administrative role. The council’s funding authority for cultural programming was transferred in 1974 to the Programa de Ação Cultural (Cultural Action Program), established by the minister of education and culture, Jarbas Passarinho, at the end of his tenure. Resources were distributed to newly created entities such as the Fundação Nacional de Artes (National Foundation for the Arts), which executed its own cultural programming and budget allocation. Though the council would remain active until 1990 when it was formally dissolved, its political influence had been greatly reduced.64 Burle Marx approached his role as counselor as a cultural project itself, which provided him with an effective platform for asserting his views on the Brazilian landscape while exhibiting a bold voice of caution against the rapid development and resource exploitation he observed. This series of eighteen depositions is particularly distinctive because of the explicit political and legal character of the texts and the revelation of Burle Marx’s little-known affiliation with the military regime in Brazil as a member of the Conselho Federal de Cultura. During the dictatorship, a period driven by policies and theories of economic development, Burle Marx, serving as one of an elite group of advisors to the president of the Republic, responded with a novel ecological and cultural argument for the environmental conservation and preservation of Brazil’s natural and cultural landscapes.\n\nconstructing culture in brazil 53\n\nFIGURE 2.1.\n\nHeadquarters building of the Ministério da Educação e Saúde, Rio de Janeiro, ca. 1945 Arquivo Gustavo Capanema/Fundação Getúlio Vargas, Centro de Pesquisa e Documentação/Fundação Oscar Niemeyer © 2023 Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York/AUTVIS, São Paulo\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nForest Narratives\n\nRoberto Burle Marx’s earliest work as a landscape architect emerged in parallel with the presidency of Getúlio Vargas in the 1930s. With his earliest projects in the northeastern city of Recife and the capital city of Rio de Janeiro, Burle Marx explored the role of ecology and celebrated the forest biodiversity within Brazil as a key element of Brazilian modernity. He would continue to develop this theme throughout his professional life. Burle Marx’s early plazas are public spaces for the civic engagement of an actively modernizing state, incorporating narratives of exploration and engagement with the hinterlands into an urban context, thereby promoting the notion of their cultural significance and concomitant conservation. Several decades later, Burle Marx would describe the catastrophic loss of Brazilian forests due to irrational exploitation in his impassioned testimonies to the Conselho Federal de Cultura at plenary councils held at the Ministério da Educação e Saúde (Ministry of Education and Health), a building whose plaza and roof gardens he had designed during this period. Often evoking the Código Florestal Brasileiro (Brazilian Forestry Code) in his depositions, Burle Marx stated that these acts of deforestation were in violation of the law. The Forestry Code, first enacted in 1934, was rewritten twice, once in 1965 by the military regime and again in 2012.1 The history of this legislation provides fascinating 55\n\ninsight into the development of environmentalism in Brazil, reflecting a trajectory of nation building and political maneuvering as well as the defining of national, cultural, and ecological values. While a young Burle Marx was developing his plaza projects in Recife during the early years of the Vargas administration, the Primeira Conferência Brasileira de Proteção à Natureza (First Brazilian Conference on Nature Protection) was held in Rio de Janeiro. Organized by a group of scientists with the support of the Vargas administration, the conference was held from April 8 to 15, 1934, at the Museu Nacional do Rio de Janeiro, the institution housed in the former imperial palace at the Quinta da Boa Vista.2 Initiated by the scientist Alberto José Sampaio (1881–1946) and the botanist Frederico Carlos Hoehne (1882–1959), working with the director of the Museu Nacional, Edgar Roquette-Pinto, the conference identified the protection and conservation of nature as an integral part of the positivist cultural, scientific, and economic vision for Vargas’s new modern state. As a part of his argument that the conservation of nature and economic development were not mutually exclusive, Sampaio evoked the prescient ideas of Alberto Torres (1865–1917) at the conference, who had first addressed the topic of resource conservation during the República Velha. Sampaio posited both conservation and the rational use of Brazil’s natural resources as part of the foundation upon which the new national identity might be established. Noting the importance of rare and endangered Brazilian plants, participants in the First Brazilian Conference on Nature Protection presented conservation as both an ethical and an aesthetic imperative.3 The conference opened with a reading of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s Aphorisms on Nature (ca. 1780), and the organizers emphasized the importance of aesthetics in the valuation of the natural world.4 But the natural world was not simply a beautiful wild garden: it would provide the necessary resources for economically valuable industries.5 The conference organizers were certainly aware of the polemics of preservation in other countries, particularly in the United States. The debate there was between the preservationist John Muir (1838–1914), who advocated for nature’s spiritual value, and the conservationist Gifford Pinchot (1865–1946), who prioritized the sustainable use of natural resources. The Brazilian organizers of the Conference on Nature Protection established a third position, in which the concepts of conservation, protection, and preservation were interchangeable. Utilitarian, scientific, and aesthetic arguments were not differentiated; for the Brazilians, the greater project was the union of nature and nationhood.
