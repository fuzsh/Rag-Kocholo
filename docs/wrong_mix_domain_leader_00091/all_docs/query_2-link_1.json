        "text": "Willem Drees (born July 5, 1886, Amsterdam, Neth.—died May 14, 1988, The Hague) was a statesman and socialist leader who was the prime minister of the Netherlands from 1948 to 1958. His four successive governments augmented his country’s comprehensive welfare state, continued the postwar abandonment of the traditional Dutch neutrality in favour of military and economic alliances, and unsuccessfully tried to retain the Republic of Indonesia as an autonomous state under the Dutch crown.\n\nEducated at Commercial School, Amsterdam, Drees was appointed stenographer to the Netherlands States General (Parliament) in 1907. A member of the Labour (Social Democratic) Party, he was elected to the city council of The Hague in 1913 and to the Second (principal) Chamber of the States-General in 1933. From 1939 he was chairman of the Labour group in the Second Chamber. When the Germans occupied his country during World War II, Drees was imprisoned for trying to organize resistance. Released in 1941, he rejoined the resistance movement and presided over the Fatherland Committee, which prepared the first governmental measures after the liberation of the Netherlands in 1945.\n\nDrees served (1945–48) as minister of social affairs in the governments of Willem Schermerhorn and Louis Beel. In 1946 Drees and Schermerhorn, a left-wing Liberal, had formed a new socialist party, the Partij van de Arbeid (“Party of Labour”). As prime minister from Aug. 6, 1948, Drees formed ministries that were coalitions of his own party and the Katholieke Volkspartij (“Catholic People’s Party”). When the latter party dissolved the coalition in a dispute over new tax proposals, Drees resigned on Dec. 12, 1958, and retired from politics."
