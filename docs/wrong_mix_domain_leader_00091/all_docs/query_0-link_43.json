You can help by expanding it.\n\nThis page contains all 14 turns of Red Star, White Star.\n\nTurn 1: 1946[]\n\nPost link: https://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1477971&p=48350921&viewfull=1#post48350921\n\nWorld Events from January 1st, 1946 to December 31st, 1946:\n\n-Former Nazi leaders tried at Nuremberg begin their sentences, whether it be a short march to the gallows or extensive prison time for their various war crimes.\n\n-The United Nations formally meets for the first time in London, England then later in Long Island, United States.\n\n-The bikini is created and sales begin in France. Conservatives are appalled at the sight of virtually nude women splashing in pools and beaches across the country.\n\n-Communist Greek forces make gains in securing northern Greece while marching down the eastern and western coastlines. Opposition forces manage to hold back in the mountainous central part of the nation as fears of a Red siege of Athens soon mount for the King and the British.\n\n-The United Kingdom grants independence to Transjordan while beginning to withdraw troops from Lebanon. Palestine breaks out in conflict as Arab militias begin attacking Jewish settlements, who in return begin attacking Arabs.\n\n-Italy becomes a republic. The last king is exiled to Portugal and all members of House of Savoy are barred from entering the new republic.\n\n-Fighting breaks out between French colonial forces and Viet Minh troops in French Indochina in late 1946.\n\nPlayer Events:\n\nNative Hunter - Republic of Colombia\n\nCapital City: Bogotá\n\nLeading Political Party: Colombian Conservative Party (Centrist-Right)\n\n-With much of Europe in ruins, the Colombian government senses an opportunity to economically jump ahead in the world while others rebuild, beginning with a massive national highway system to tie the nation's cities together. Road construction goes well along the northern coastal regions but slows as it begins to edge its way into the southern mountainous jungle regions due to terrain, local corruption and theft of construction materials.\n\n-Another part of what the government has dubbed \"La Reconstrucción\" of the economy, tourist companies from around the Caribbean are invited to the country to set up shop. Within months, construction of major resorts sprout up along Colombia's beaches, attracting returning American GIs from the European theater.\n\n-Government men are often found at these resorts talking to former American soldiers in an attempt to recruit them into the Colombian military with the intention of becoming drill sergeants. Most reply, \"No habla Espanol, senor\" as they're weary from years of war, regiments, and guns in Europe and the Pacific.\n\n-Bogotá also opens the door to American agriculture companies to invest in Colombia's massively fertile lands and attract several large corporation's interests in fruit, coffee and sugar growth. By the end of the year, several large industrial plantations open throughout the country and create a large number of jobs. The left wing parties of the country cry foul with the exploitation of their people and land, but it mostly falls on deaf ears as people, usually poor countryside citizens, are more than happy to have a decent paying job.\n\n-Heads of the leading political parties gather in Bogotá to discuss the mutual disarming of their paramilitary forces in September 1946. Talks begin to go well until it is announced a bill outlawing \"rioting and violent protesting\" is passed into law by the nation's conservatives. Opposition parties suspect this is a ploy to forcefully disarm them if talks fail and walk out on the dialogue.\n\n-Tensions between the opposition parties are quickly soothed soon after though, as the same government then goes under a massive reconstructing and moves from a unitary to federal republic with many checks and balances. Cheered by party bigwigs and the common man alike as a better government system to provide freedom to its people, Bogotá still sees corruption in its bureaucracy and politicians.\n\n-In a move to bolster employment beyond what foreign investment can provide, the government begins a major recruitment campaign to attract men into the armed forces, focusing on patriotic images of dashing young men in sharp uniforms and girls at their sides. The less politically driven men of the militias see this as a legitimate way to be paid to carry a gun, but leaves the party militias with a core of die-hard ideologues. The best of these new recruits are funneled into a newly formed military unit called \"Las Serpientes Silenciosas,\" or \"the Silent Serpents\" meant to act as a military spearhead division as well as military police force.\n\n-Local Colombian college professors tinkering with electrical parts discover when two gold point contacts were applied to a crystal of germanium, a signal was produced with the output power greater than the input. They quickly write down the results in their notebooks for future study before heading to their next class to teach.\n\n-Meanwhile, a colleague of the professors in the line above attempts to figure out America's secret to the atom bomb by experimenting with duct taping an unhealthy load of dynamite together and setting it off in a nearby field. Unfortunately knowing atomic theory doesn't equate to common sense - a memorial service will be held Monday.\n\n-Expeditions into the country side with Colombian officials and American oil company representatives to find possible new wells to drill into only return back with muddy shoes, exhausted faces and disappointment.\n\n-A telephone call is made to Ecuador and Brazil, putting increased economic trade and a military alliance on the table. Brazil doesn't pick up the line, but Ecuador is piqued by the diplomatic offer and welcomes improved economic relations as a step toward bettering over all relations between the two South American countries. It laughs off the military alliance, though.\n\nLoganIsAwesome - United States of America\n\nCapital City: Washington DC\n\nLeading Political Party: Democratic Party (Centrist)\n\n-The US does a massive overhaul of its military now that the Second World War is over, passing an Affordable Housing Bill and a GI Bill of Rights for returning soldiers, greatly helping them out as they come home from the wreckage of Europe and Asia. Recognizing its new position in world politics, the government quickly stops short of the full demobilization it saw after the First World War and maintains a very sizable peacetime army. Much of these remaining troops are stationed in newly built American military bases throughout Europe, Japan, and Korea to both help with the occupation of former Axis powers as well as to insure further possible advances of the Red Army in central Europe.\n\n-A new alliance is formed by some of the Allied Powers, named the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, to insure mutual defense and military cooperation. Starting members include the United States, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Belgium, France and a few other European nations. Entering the alliance also insures participation in huge economic relief programs by the US, aimed to rebuild western Europe quickly, though the results of the funds are yet to be seen by the majority of Europe.\n\n-The United States begins to set dialogue for rebuilding the German nation whole again but the Allies are unable to form a coherent plan just yet as the occupying powers have different designs on the former Third Reich, especially France who creates the Saar Protectorate.\n\n-Former Nazi technical scientists are quickly moved out of Europe and into the US with promise of a new life absolved of all Nazi crimes if they aid in developing American rocketry and jet technology. Without hesitation, all agree to do so and begin work immediately.\n\n-Meanwhile in the Pacific, newly created national governments are built in American controlled Korea and Japan while still under American occupation. In a surprising move, the United States formally annexes all outlying Japanese Islands, including Iwo Jima and Okinawa, to use as a strategic base and prevent the rise of the Japanese war machine once again. Many Japanese grumble at this blatant land grab, but the new provisional government keeps silent on the matter as American troops still occupy the Home Islands. The new Korean provisional government reaches out to the Soviet Union to relinquish control of the northern half of its nation, but no reply is made to them.\n\n-In the States, Washington announces a major interstate high way project to provide jobs to returning soldiers, create an easy route for military units to cross country in the event of invasion and provide an economic boost to the movement of goods. Extensive planning takes place over the months after the bill is passed and formal construction begins in the later summer of 1946 with funds available to continue construction for the next few years. Earmarks to extend waterways and a national electric grid also make their way into the bill, but most funding is reserved for the roads.\n\n-While the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act has complete bipartisan support, both parties fracture in arguments in Congress as civil rights and national health care bills are introduced. Shouts and accusations of being communist sympathizers are made on both sides, most prominently by future Senator-elect Joseph McCarthy. The end result of the heated discussions leave the bills a shadow of their former selves, allowing only the desegregation of the armed forces and a bill to provide federal money to states to build a number of new hospitals. The Congressional debates are widely covered in the news and many young African-Americans take note and begin wondering if change is possible for them in the south.\n\n-The military reaches out to professors of mathematics around the nation to help in designing an improved computer from the behemoths currently operating in the world. Development progresses forward, but is slowed by the number of moths that keep ending up in the machinery and discussion of a contract with Terminex is ongoing.\n\nGriffster26 - Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia\n\nCapital City: Belgrade\n\nLeading Political Party: Communist Party of Yugoslavia (Far-Left)\n\n-With support of the USSR, Yugoslavia absorbs the People's Republic of Albania into itself. Many Albanians are weary of this, but the communist government in Tirana, the capital, are more than happy to cooperate with their red brothers in Belgrade to be an integral Socialist Republic within Yugoslavia.\n\n-Yugoslavia also begins talks in early 1946 to integrate with the People's Republic of Bulgaria. Talks go slow, but when offered control over the Western Outlands, Bulgaria joins as a Socialist Republic alongside Albania by August. Despite the cooperation, Bulgarian officials are angered when a province of theirs is reorganized by Belgrade to be under control and governance of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia within Yugoslavia, but by then it is too late to matter in Sophia.\n\n-By the end of the year, Belgrade's territorial reorganization within its borders is complete when Kosovo is divided between the newly integrated Albania and Socialist Republic of Serbia, as well as Vojvodina being created as a separate Socialist Republic, equal to the others in the Yugoslav union. Many of the socialist governments in the southern part of the growing country have mixed emotions over the loss and gains of lands but with Soviet backing in Belgrade and the opportunity to grow with their communist Slav comrades, dissent is quickly dissolved.\n\n-With the acquisition of Albania and Bulgaria, their militaries are absorbed into Yugoslav People's Army but integration is slowed with language barriers, confusion of who is now in command of some units, and redeployment of forces within other Yugoslav military districts. It may take a little time before these armies are successfully worked into the greater Yugoslav military forces.\n\n-Soviet-Yugoslav relations grow closer as Belgrade honorarily gives various Soviet leaders and commanders Order of the People's Hero and the Order of Freedom awards, the highest in the southern Slav state has to offer. A week long \"victory parade\" is held on the one year anniversary of the end of WW2 in Europe, both to celebrate the success of Yugoslavia in the war as well as showcase it's new and growing military force within Europe.\n\n-By the mid summer, rebuilding of the country ravaged by war begins to take off, but funds are drying up quick and by the end of 1946, reconstruction is slowed almost to a snail's pace. Socialist leaders are disappointed their grand plans of rebuilding are all but halted.\n\n-One part of the rebuilding process that does go successfully well is the construction of large chemical plants throughout Yugoslavia. Foreign officials question the intent of these plants, but Belgrade officials happily showcase new, premium fertilizers made to increase production in the agriculture sector. Foreign officials then quit inquiring as the smell is oppressive and begin to wonder if the plants are simply warehouses full of horses being fed laxatives.\n\nTeddyBeer - Kuomintang [Chinese Nationalist Party]\n\nCapital City: N/A\n\nLeading Political Party: Kuomintang [Chinese Nationalist Party] (Right-Wing)\n\n-With Japanese occupation finally over, the Kuomintang settle down in the cities and coastline they control and take in account of their situation. Finding wide-spread support for their opponents, the Communist Party of China, Chiang Kai-shek begins a program to help rebuild rural villages destroyed by the war. While funds are limited, aid from abroad and reconstruction of the cities help win some support of the countryside closes to Nationalist control, but much further away from the cities sees limited success.\n\n-Analyzing the failures to repulse the Japanese on their own and win against the communists prior to the invasion, the Kuomintang leaders find corruption in their organization and officer corps as a leading cause of their failures. Massive overhauls are done in the command structure of the army and the civilian political side, though Chiang Kai-shek is still in absolute control. A new branch of the Kuomintang is founded, the National Zhong Commission, to root out political, military and civil corruption. While they have much work to do and achieve little in the way of actually ridding corruption, several highly publicized trials give the people hope and a little trust to the nationalists.\n\n-To prevent further foreign invasion and stay on the defensive from possible communist attacks, the nationalist military command begins tinkering with landmines and how they can be improved. Due to years of warfare, and one military officer gaining an idea after stepping on a loose nail, decent developments are made.\n\n[Seed Eater] - Communist Party of China\n\nCapital City: N/A\n\nLeading Political Party: Communist Party of China (Far-Left)\n\n-Expecting a complete renewal of the Chinese civil war with the nationalists the moment Japanese troops leave the mainland, the Chinese Red Army prepares defenses and fortifications of the territories they control. Troops and command are on high alert throughout early 1946, but as the year passes into late Spring and summer, they realize the nationalist forces aren't making moves against them. Many troops become bored while sitting in foxholes and trenches and some pass the time with snowball fights in the early winter.\n\n-Mao and the rest of the party leadership spend many hours planning and outlining plans to defend the territories they have while taking in account what resources they own, prepping battle plans and tactics when the civil war renews but these pages of strategy end up gathering dust by the end of the year while party finds more time to put toward rallying peasant and worker support in light of the surprising, if not uneasy, peace with the nationalists.\n\nSatansick - Kingdom of the Netherlands\n\nCapital City: Amsterdam\n\nLeading Political Party: Catholic People's Party (Centrist)\n\n-From the ashes of the second World War, the Netherlands has made economic growth and reconstruction it's number one priority. Whaling is encouraged by the Dutch government to provide its people with food and fat, resulting in Dutch ships being seen as far north as Spitsbergen's coast searching the seas. Meats taken from these trips are quickly put into the new rationing food stamp system the Dutch implement to prevent nation wide famine.\n\n-After joining NATO, Amsterdam utilizes American funds to rebuild as quickly as it gets deposited into their checking accounts. Large oil refineries pop up along the coast to quickly refine all oil imports. Much of the refined product is used by the Dutch, but due to the destruction of Germany, the Netherlands make an easy buck at the expense of its old occupier's desperate need for fuel.\n\n-Hoping to create its own supply of oil to refine rather than solely relying on imports, expeditions into the North Sea discover large reserves under the waves. Plans to exploit these wells are drawn up by the end of the year while the British government grows concerned over a possible Dutch monopoly in the region.\n\n-During the war, the Dutch military was completely destroyed. While economic growth is Amsterdam's priority, large funds from America's loans are diverted to rebuilding the army and navy, with an eye on reclaiming its colonies in Asia. Though many Dutch just want to move on with their lives having just been through the greatest war in history, the recruitment programs see many volunteers from the unemployed youth. Coastal towns often see these new recruits practicing beach assaults again and again.\n\n-The Netherlands also reaches out abroad to improve its military situation, asking the United Kingdom for aid in holding the Dutch East Indies. Stretched thin by the war, the British give limited help to their neighbor, offering to hold what troops they have occupying there for a while and promising some material support but will not actively engage the rebels on the islands. Luckily, the Dutch see great cooperation with the locals in the Maluku Islands, some even handing over rebel sympathizers to Dutch authorities.\n\n-Many Dutch have been left homeless due to the destruction of the war and the government quickly seeks solutions to this issue before they lose a large chunk of their potential workforce to immigration. Any houses devoid of tenants for a certain period is seized by the government and redistributed to homeless families with very low or absent rent bills. The program sees so much success that families are often being caught living in windmills at the government's expense. For those who can't find a house to live in despite the program, the Netherlands starts a massive rebuilding program focused solely on large apartment buildings throughout the nation that by the end of year has the first families easily moving into the new buildings. This program has the side benefit of giving jobs to those within said families as well.\n\n-In one of the biggest diplomatic events of the year besides the formation of NATO, the Dutch invite Britain, France, Belgium, and Luxembourg to work out a free trade deal and common market for steel and coal. After a month of hashing out the details in Amsterdam, the European Coal and Steel Association is formed, with Dutch Prime Minister Louis Beel saying, \"Our goals is to make another European war materially impossible while providing economic growth to all\". Those invited join, save for the British who opt to maintain an observer status to avoid being drawn into some sort of supranational entity.\n\n-Medical staff in Amsterdam are now able to finally to begin freely studying medicine without the dire need of a war. Having observed the great use of penicillin in casualties and the large quantities needed in a conflict, Dutch doctors begin toying with ways of synthesizing it. Work is slow, but by the end of the year breakthroughs are thought to have been made and staff feel confident to have a test batch by the end of 1947 if not sooner.\n\n-Having witnessed the effectiveness of napalm during the war in the Pacific by American forces, the Dutch begin studying ways to improve it. In October 1946, testing on condemned buildings begin with a new experimental form, dubbed Napalm B. Military officials are quite pleased with its development and order mass production of the deadly chemical.\n\nMilkdairy - Union of Soviet Socialist Republics\n\nCapital City: Moscow\n\nLeading Political Party: Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Far-Left)\n\n-With the war in Europe over, the Soviet Union swings its focus into other regions of the globe. A soviet envoy is sent to Turkey, a nation historically at odds with its northern neighbor, to hash out a premeditate peace agreement. The Turks are hesitant at first, but being surrounded by communist forces in the east, the Balkans and Greece, staying on the USSR's good side seems like a decent idea and the Treaty of Mutual Respect is signed.\n\n-An envoy is also sent to Saudi Arabia, but they refuse to allow the delegation to even land the plane in their country, forcing them to turn back and refuel Iraq.\n\n-In February of 1946, Soviet forces occupying Iran begin to \"help\" set up a provisional government within their occupation zone. The provisional government, led by the Iranian Communist Party, immediately outlaws all other political parties and assumes absolute control. By September, Moscow is confident of the new Iranian government's capabilities to to rule the land and begin withdrawing Red Army troops from the region. The British are shocked and angry the Soviets breaking the agreement promising Iran full sovereignty of its original territory after the war and immediately helps the Shah annex Azerbaijan. The Socialist People's Republic of Iran (SPRI) settles in Tehran as its capital as the Shaw takes the city of Ahvaz in the southwest as his new throne. Tensions are high between what people soon start calling East Iran and West Iran. Western nations are worried about the Soviet's sphere of influencing all but touching into the Indian Ocean.\n\n-In a move that surprises communists as much as the west, the Soviet Union abolishes conscription. Much of the population is relieved that their sons and fathers won't be dragged off to war, but it's hard to gauge real public sentiment as the risk of being turned into a political prisoner in a gulag in Siberia is still quite real.\n\n-Massive industrialization continues throughout the country as it did in war time. By the end of 1946, some Soviet troops occupying eastern Europe are spotted with a new, advanced rifle. Sources say they're calling it the AK-47. A new, improved battle tank also starts production at the same time dubbed the T-55. Though its production is too late to be used against the Third Reich, Soviet military officials are confident in its uses against imperialist forces in future conflicts.\n\n-Wanting to keep its technological edge in the world, the Soviet Union begins massive training of technicians. Some are taught by former Nazi scientists, mostly against their will but still happy to be alive, and the number of Soviet scientists will soon be rising.\n\nSniperComZero - Kingdom of Egypt / Republic of Egypt\n\nCapital City: Cairo\n\nLeading Political Party: New Wafd Party (Centrist Right)\n\n-The new year sees the Egyptian Parliament passing an overwhelming support of the abolishment of the monarchy. King Farouk I is outraged by this but after massive protests in the streets of Cairo after a royal speech objecting to the measure, he flees into self-imposed exile and the Republic of Egypt is declared.\n\n-The republic then shifts focus to its struggling economy, hoping to literally exploit the land of its resources. Expeditions are sent out in search of new oil wells and mining options. By June, what little oil Egypt has begins to be sold off at an unusually high price to European nations. Governments in the north are somewhat annoyed at the expenses but will take any oil they can get their hands on at the moment to fuel rebuilding.\n\n-A uranium deposit is discovered at an undisclosed location and excavation soon begins of the material. Little is actually discovered but there's enough that by late December, Cairo offers bids to different governments to take purchase (I know you said you were going to sell it off, but you didn't say to whom and given the uses of this material, I'm going to hold off of selling it until it's specifically said).\n\n-Cairo sends out delegations to London to begin talks about British territory bordering Egypt. Knowing better than to ask about the Suez Canal, the Egyptians focus on Libyan territory and the Sudan. The British see Egyptian occupation of its Libyan administrative territories as an ease on their military burdens but the UK already has been working on a provisional government in Sudan, forcing South Sudan to merge with North Sudan's administration. The provisional government is interested in an Egyptian union, though, while its South Sudanese members vehemently object. By November 1946, Egyptian administrators take their British counterpart's seats in Libya while the local Libyan populace have a variety of opinions on the integration, both good and bad.\n\n-To its fellow Arab nations, Egypt offers to form a Pan-Islamic Association. Much of the middle east either objects to the offer or expresses strong hesitation to. Nationalists across the region grumble at the thought of a Islam-focused region while others see it as a refreshing start to the rebirth of Islam in the world.\n\n-The Egyptian military takes account of its current situation, both material stock and strategic situation. They find that their military has a lot of work to do in order to become a strong regional power but the potential is there. Though the Egyptian Republic isn't concerned about an immediate invasion by any other force in the world, just-in-case measures are planned out involve strategic retreats to military strong points.\n\n-With the expansion into Libya and the possible expansion into Sudan in the future, the Egyptian military begins development of a APC on tracks much like a tank. A simple enough design is made and field tests of what is being called the Anubis I begin in late 1946.\n\nNATO Members:\n\n-United States\n\n-United Kingdom\n\n-Netherlands\n\n-Belgium\n\n-France\n\n-Portugal\n\n-Denmark\n\n-Iceland\n\n-Norway\n\nEuropean Coal and Steel Association Members:\n\n-Netherlands\n\n-United Kingdom\n\n-Belgium\n\n-France\n\n-Luxembourg\n\n-Denmark\n\nWorld Issues for the world's leading powers:\n\n-What to do with Germany - Unification or division or partition?\n\n-What to do with Austria - Note that due to Austria's independence prior to Nazi annexation, it is treated as a liberated nation from the 3rd Reich as opposed to a conquered foe by world powers.\n\n-How to settle the Chinese civil war that can reignite at any moment\n\nPolitical Spectrum:\n\nFar Left - Left Wing - Centrist Left - Centrist - Centrist Right - Right Wing - Far Right\n\nNotes: Unless there is some kind of direct influence by a player nation, NPC nations will act as they historically did and wars between NPCs will erupt as they historically happened. Regarding NATO, I will NOT be making a NATO map again for a few turns. That map was waaay too time consuming. I've also decided to not implement crisis turns into the RP, mostly due to being new to GM'ing and the fact that if the Chinese Civil War breaks out, it'll technically have to be a crisis turn every turn until the conflict ends. Why is the ECSC now the ECSA? Because it was started prior to when it historically did, thus is a Point of Divergence in the RP's timeline. This will cause small ripples in historical accuracy that, while won't have any real impact on the game itself, will be different from real history (because I'm into that kind of shit).\n\nTurn 2: 1947[]\n\nPost link: https://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1477971&p=48418613&viewfull=1#post48418613\n\nWorld Events from January 1st, 1947 to December 31st, 1947:\n\n-The United Kingdom oversees the Partition of India, between India and Pakistan. Soon after, both newly independent nations break out in war with each other over the territory of Kashmir.\n\n-Greek communists forces seize the Central Greece province, cutting off royalists in the core mountains in spring of 1947 and then are besieged. The King of Greece disappears over a week, then turns up in the British protectorate of Cyprus. His fleeing from the country, though still claiming the monarchy is a great morale blow to the anti-communist forces.\n\n-Ammonium nitrate cargo of SS Grandcap explodes in Texas City, Texas leaving 552 dead and 3000 injured. It is the biggest non-nuclear explosion on earth since WW2.\n\n-In what began as a worker protest against the Korean provisional government in the island of Jeju, riots break out after Korean policemen attempting to quell the protest shoot and kill 2 protesters. The riots last for 2 months on the island, with some similar, smaller riots happening on the peninsula. The crack downs by the provisional government are brutal and effective, ending the violence but not before 3 US servicemen caught up in the riots are killed. The Korean Communist Party, headquartered in Seoul, launch a scything propaganda attack on the provisional government and the imperialist American forces.\n\n-Madagascar nationalists rebel against colonial French forces in May. As the war drags on through the year, it becomes bloodier and bloodier, stressing France with yet another colonial rebellion.\n\n-A communist coup in Romania seizes control of the nation and the King flees into self-imposed exile. A similar communist coup takes over Hungary and Czechoslovakia.\n\n-The Olympic Committee formally announces the winners of the 1952 Olympics will be held in Yugoslavia (winter) and Colombia (summer).\n\nPlayer Involved Conflicts:\n\n-Kingdom of Netherlands vs. Self-proclaimed Indonesian Republic (since March 1947)\n\n-Communist China vs. Nationalist China (since April 1947)\n\n-Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, Communist Greek forces vs. National/Royal Greek forces (since July 1947)\n\n-Democratic Republic of Vietnam vs. France (since November 1946)\n\nPlayer Events:\n\nNative Hunter - Republic of Colombia\n\nCapital City: Bogotá\n\nLeading Political Party: Colombian Conservative Party (Centrist-Right)\n\n-Changing its previous, subtle plan to entice vacationing American soldiers to join the Colombian military as trainers, Bogotá goes straight to the source - the US government - and works out a deal to send military advisers to the South American nation to begin mass training of its military forces, most of which coming from a paramilitary/militia background without formal experience. By December 1947, the Colombian military begins to take the shape of a modern and mighty military force.\n\n-Party paramilitary forces continue to shrink as the government entices even more of its members into the federal forces with a soldier bill mimicking it's northern neighbor's GI Bill of Rights. The remaining militia men are die-hard ideologues loyal to their beliefs and party, but are so few in number that in the event of a civil conflict, could not do much but prick at government forces.\n\n-Continuing with the previous year's infrastructure plans, numerous railroad and airports are build throughout the Colombian nation. Much of them are constructed quickly and with ease, some seeing use by the end of the year, transporting agricultural goods on the ground and tourists in the air.\n\n-To encourage economic growth, not only in their own country, but the region abroad, Bogotá opens talks to surrounding nations to form a free trade treaty in March. Their talks are fruitful and by July, the Caribbean Free Trade Union is formed with Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Costa Rica. Cuba shows some interest in joining in November while Peru snubs an offer of cooperation.\n\n-A handful of national universities are built in major cities corresponding to Colombia's national public schooling system being built. These universities are set to be filled with students from the nation's growing middle class by the next year, as well as students from abroad in a foreign exchange program.\n\n-In celebration of winning the summer Olympics of 1952, Colombian begins the construction of several football stadiums around the country for entertainment. A national football league is soon after established, with city teams popping up across the nation, which are soon followed by intense team rivalries.\n\n-Colombia embraces an open door policy toward international refugees from across the globe. Many left-wing members of government are happy with the move, though secretly grumble that the Conservative Party is stealing their wind. There is a catch, though, as refugees are required to find a job and eventually integrate into Colombian society but have a gracious 10 year period to do so.\n\n-Along with the open door policy on refugees, Colombia and Ecuador further improve their relations with an open door policy on immigration and migrant workers. The act is viewed as a major positive for both nation's economies as well as the CTFU's in general. Migrant workers are quickly hired by Colombian coffee plantations for mass production. Eventually, the high production of good coffee lets several small coffee companies form a conglomerate and produce the brand \"Bogotá's Best\" which quickly becomes popular in Colombia and abroad.\n\n-Bogotá also begins a humanitarian trend in Colombia, working with the Catholic Church to establish soup kitchens, homeless shelters, volunteering centers, medical clinics and relief funds. In return, the government offers the Catholic Church lands in the Andes Mountains to do as they will, such as build monasteries but the offer is turned down and ask that the lands be used to continue the humanitarian projects now being worked on.\n\n-Further innovations using electricity is made in the development of transistors, much like the Netherlands, and now with power-generating wind turbines.\n\nLoganIsAwesome - United States of America\n\nCapital City: Washington DC\n\nLeading Political Party: Republican Party (Centrist-Right)\n\n-In an attempt to extend the well-funded high way program, the US in January begin talks with Canada for it to begin its own as well as interconnect it with America. The Canadians, seeing the obvious mutual benefit, not just economically but militarily, begin immediately, though majority of the roads are made along the Canadian-US border where much of the population is, as well as up the Pacific coast into Alaska.\n\n-Meanwhile at home, infrastructure plans continue well as new hospitals and affordable housing is built across the nation. Some states bicker about over-sized federal government but mostly hushed with the interstate commerce clause is mentioned.\n\n-Though the newly elected Republican dominated Congress meets for the first time in Washington in March, President Truman is no where to be seen. Instead, he embarks on a national tour of the country to raise support for a Civil Rights bill and to end segregation in the South. Though some state governors in the south make rude remarks toward Truman and where he could shove such concepts, many African-Americans and poor white Americans attend his speeches en mass.\n\n-A new look at the American prison system is examined. Recalling the awful inhumanities of Nazi prisons, the US attempts to move toward a system more focused on rehabilitation. A successful bill is passed in Congress, but concession by the opposition was the staying of the death penalty as \"some evil men can't be helped\".\n\n-The US Air Force continues tinkering with jet engines and begin designing an fighter jet improved on the designs of the Bell P-59 Airacomet and the P-80 Shooting Star. By November 1947, the US reveals the flight trials of the newly dubbed F2H Banshee jet fighter.\n\n-On the ground, the Army begins focusing hard on armored warfare. It lays out a plan to have thousands and thousands of Pershing tanks while phasing out the Sherman. Even though contracts to build Pershings are made well into the 1950s, the Army already begins designing their next generation tank to phase out the Pershing. Outlines are made and drawn up, though it may be another year before a working prototype to tinker with is made.\n\n-After examining captured German camo uniforms and reexamining the Marine's \"Duck Hunter\" battle uniform, the Army begins designs on what they believe will absolutely conceal their soldiers from enemy sights until it's too late. A leafy-looking camo outfit is designed and begins to be general issue by December 1947.\n\n-To enhance the fighting ability of America's finest soldiers and no longer pressured by the extensive need to churn men into a quick meat grinder, an extended Basic Combat Training program is introduced, extending boot camp for all military branches to 4 months. This is to increase the men's morale, teamwork, and experience of which end the bullet comes out of in their weapons.\n\n-By the end of the year, inspired by Truman's words, many angry constituents write letters to their Congressmen explaining the evils of segregation. This gains some momentum in Congress with the Democratic Party gaining just enough votes from the majority Republicans to pass a Voter Right's Act, prohibiting any sort of racial discrimination of potential voters. Though the south is in uproar by this, talks of a civil rights bill reaches the ears of the media before the Congress goes on Christmas leave. Those in the south have mixed reactions of the news, with African Americans holding rallies and marches in support while KKK membership skyrockets. In Birmingham, the two crowds collide in a violent riot, quickly dubbed the Christmas Riots. Several African Americans are killed in the violence before police put an end to the insurrection from both sides.\n\nGriffster26 - Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia\n\nCapital City: Belgrade\n\nLeading Political Party: Communist Party of Yugoslavia (Far-Left)\n\n-As part of the 1947 peace accords with Italy and Allied Powers, Italy cedes the Slovene Littoral to Yugoslavian control, along with several minor islands along the Adriatic coast as well as recognition of Yugoslav dominion over Albania.\n\n-Yugoslav military officials lay out a full integration plan of Albanian and Bulgarian military forces into the greater Yugoslav armies and by mid summer, the last of the Bulgarian divisions finally find their place within their greater country.\n\n-Following the winning advances of communist forces in their southern neighbor, Belgrade officially recognizes the Communist Party of Greece as the legitimate government of Greece. This announcement comes only a few days after it is discovered the King of Greece has fled Athens to British Cyprus, further degrading reactionary forces' morale. In the months soon after, Yugoslav \"volunteer\" brigades are seen fighting along side their Greek compatriots assaulting the besieged forces in central Greece. By the end of the year, the combined forces are on the outskirts of Athens while many islands in the Aegean are captured by red forces. Though their king has essentially abandoned them, in a desperate act, the government in Athens formally declares war on Yugoslavia but even at this point the British are wary of giving continued support.\n\n-Communist Belgrade continues its domestic restructuring from 1946 by redistricting Pirin Macedonia to be under Bulgarian administration, Vojvodina into Serbia and creating a Hungarian Autonomous District in the north.\n\n-Much like its larger Slavic brother, Yugoslavia abolishes the state atheism program, allowing free worship of all faiths within the state.\n\n-To increase ease of communication between the different parts of Yugoslavia, a Serbo-Croatian language program is mandated within all school systems throughout the country.\n\n-Yugoslavia, despite its alliance to the USSR and Warsaw Pact, reaches out to western European nations and formalizes the mutual opening of embassies, though the British refuse due to Yugoslav participation in the Greek Civil War.\n\n-With the construction of chemical plants throughout the country, various new synthetic compound fertilizers are created and tested, though due to the nature of plant growth, testing continues into December of 1947 but with promising results.\n\n-Continued tinkering with German machine guns and eyes on the new Soviet AK-47, the Yugoslav military begins test designs of a new rifle that is much more light weight than the German gun used in the Second World War.\n\nMalos - Democratic Republic of Vietnam\n\nCapital City: Hanoi\n\nLeading Political Party: Viet Minh (Left Wing Nationalist)\n\n-Vietnamese troops maintain a defensive war against French colonial forces, retreating when necessary to avoid mass casualties while picking at easy targets that can be overrun.\n\n-Ho Chi Minh sends an open request of help to Western Europe and the United States to end French imperialism in Indochina.\n\n-In hopes of gaining western support, North Vietnamese troops end booby trapping where French soldiers may march to show a more humanitarian, conventional war despite the chance of losing the conflict.\n\n-In another move to gain western sympathy, Hanoi announces it will have national and free elections the moment the conflict ends so the independent people of Vietnam may freely choose its leadership, not be ruled over a possibly victorious rebel group.\n\n[Seed Eater] - Communist Party of China\n\nCapital City: N/A\n\nLeading Political Party: Communist Party of China (Far-Left)\n\n-As soon as the snow begins to melt in the early spring, the land of China erupts in war. Maoist forces, using Soviet, abandoned Japanese and eastern European arms along with a little help from communist Korean volunteers launch massive invasions into nationalist-held territory.\n\n-The assaults are preempted with days of hit-and-run tactics until a full siege begins, usually being successful.\n\n-By early summer of 1947, communist forces begin to siege the cities of Beijing and Tianjin by surrounding the cities and cutting off all outlets to the outside world hoping to starve the inhabitants into submission.\n\n-The same siege tactics are used against the cities of Qingdao and Yantai, which both fall within a week of each other in early August.\n\nSatansick - Kingdom of the Netherlands\n\nCapital City: Amsterdam\n\nLeading Political Party: Catholic People's Party (Centrist)\n\n-Taking note of Colombian scientists from the previous year, Dutch electronic engineers follow up with what they're now dubbing as the \"transistor\". Several prototypes have been designed with very promising experiments in their uses.\n\n-Remembering the German V2 rockets that flew over their nation to strike Britain in the second world war, the Netherlands creates and begins funding a small rocketry research department. Oversight is done by the military, of course, as the the use of rockets thus far have been a strictly military nature. Though the Dutch have to essentially start from scratch, they make great strides throughout the year with the program.\n\n-A joint Dutch-French diplomatic meeting takes place with Italian ministers in Rome outlying the southern European state's entrance into the European Coal & Steel Association. Everyone leaves with smiles on their faces as Italy joins in late summer of 1947 as Preliminary Entree Status State with full membership by 1949.\n\n-Amsterdam in early fall embraces a new economic regulation for its industries with capping labor wages when the production of goods stagnate. Many lower class Dutch are angry by the move while the factory owners step in line with the government and tell them to \"just work harder\" to see a pay raise.\n\n-Top brass begin forming a military special forces unit and ask for British and Australian help in training their forces. The joint effort is accepted, though the British are reluctant to teach the Dutch all of their secret craft of the SAS.\n\n-Much like with the UK, Amsterdam extends a hand out to France for joint military training. The deal is welcomed warmly, though actual training happens few and far between due to French colonial wars drain much of its manpower. The French, in kind, ask if any cooperation with such wars is possible for Dutch participation.\n\n-Speaking of colonial wars, the Dutch war to reclaim its East Indies dramatically heats up in the spring of 1947. Dutch planes airdrop thousands of pamphlets over Indonesian rebels on the island of Java giving orders and instructions to surrender. These are often used as toilet paper by the rebels, which a day later comes as a great use when the Netherlands launches a huge operation to quickly overtake Java and Sumatra. By early summer, the self-proclaimed capital of the Indonesian Republic - Yogyakarta - is half in ruins, but firmly under Dutch control.\n\n-Napalm B is used widely throughout the campaign, burning rebel, land and civilian alike in its path of destruction. Though its use encourages some Indonesians to fight harder and join the rebels, its military advantages continue to give Dutch troops the advance. In August of 1947, there are rebel rumors that President Sukarno of the Indonesian Republic was killed in some such attacks. A possible confirmation of his death is brought by a sudden and harsh counter-attack by Sumatran rebels into the province of South Sumatra. Natives of the Maluku Islands continue to show solidarity with Dutch officials in stopping the rebels.\n\n-To combat casualties, friendly or foe, the great use of Dutch synthetic penicillin sees its first field test with great results, saving many lives.\n\n-While the military wreaks havoc upon its enemy forces in rebel parts of the East Indies, other more peaceful and accepting islands of Dutch rule begin regular economic production again and ships carrying eastern goods are seen docking in Amsterdam by early autumn of 1947.\n\nMilkdairy - Union of Soviet Socialist Republics\n\nCapital City: Moscow\n\nLeading Political Party: Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Far-Left)\n\n-January of the new year starts off on a sober note for the USSR as newly appointed premier Nikita Krushchev announces to his fellow workers and peasants as well as to the greater world that the great leader of the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin, had died of a heart attack in his sleep. Socialist republics everywhere are in mourning for the man who liberated communism from imperialist reactionary forces of Germany just two years prior.\n\n-Kruschev immediately gets down to work on forming a Soviet Union unlike the cruel, unforgiving view Stalin held for his country with the abolishment of state atheism. Though the country remains strongly secular and churches, temples and mosques of the Soviet Union have no sway in government, the people of the country slowly begin re-attending sermons increasingly over the year as they realize they truly won't disappear in the night for doing so.\n\n-The new leader of the USSR, along with his Foreign Affairs Minister Molotov, take a tour of Eastern Europe meeting with the newly formed communist governments. They bring a message of communist unity as well as communist moderation, emphasizing not to turn into totalitarian dictatorships as Stalin had created. At the end of their tour, in Warsaw, the two create an alliance in Eastern Europe dubbed the Warsaw Pact and promise to give the European nations in the Soviet sphere a \"Molotov Plan\" deal much like the US's Marshall Plan but with communist overtones.\n\n-The Molotov Plan injects large funds into the eastern nation's economies, hoping to jumpstart industrialization in each nation on its own as opposed to sending all resources to the USSR for production.\n\n-After the Soviet abolishment of conscription the previous year, the Soviet government embarks on an enlistment enticement to keep their military strong with volunteer soldiers. Enlisting benefits are created as well as retirement packages for soldiers ending their tours in Eastern Europe. They also give pay raises to many veteran soldiers remaining in the forces as well as increasing the amount of vegetables in daily military rations. The Soviet soldier of 1947 could only have dreamed of such a life in the hard days of 1941. Soviet generals are also ordered to begin massive redesigns of the Soviet military force as a whole, knowing that the world is far different today than it was two years ago during the Second World War. These plans are designed to focus on better technical training of individual soldiers.\n\n-Sensing the instability of the Persian region, Molotov is sent to Ahvaz to meet the Shah. A week goes by without public announcement of the results when Molotov returns to Moscow. But in the next month, the Soviet Union ends all ties with the Socialist People's Republic of Iran which implodes on itself within a few days, allowing the territory to integrate back into a whole Iran. The Shah then announces a co-creation of the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan from both Iranian and Soviet territories, which while shares close ties with Moscow's party line, has open and friendly relations with its other neighbors.\n\n-Using captured Nazi technology (and probably the actual engineers from those projects too), the Soviet Union makes great advances into the field of jet aeronautics.\n\n-Soviet gunsmiths begin to tinker with AK-47s to design a fully operational machine gun. Few designs are found that could be workable, but party leaders are glad with the advances made none the less.\n\nSniperComZero - Republic of Egypt\n\nCapital City: Cairo\n\nLeading Political Party: New Wafd Party (Centrist Right)\n\n-Egypt begins the new year by quickly contracting companies to exploit the oil wealth in their newly acquired Libyan provinces. Preliminary expeditions show great results and by time August's beating sun shines over the land, several oil wells are being drilled. Production is expected to exponentially increase over time.\n\n-The New Wafd Party introduces a number of reform acts in government to combat corruption and nepotism, further strengthening republicanism in the former monarchist nation. The opposition believe this may just be a ploy to win voters in the next election, but if that's true then it sure as hell is working.\n\n-The Egyptian military continue trial runs of the Anubis 1 armored personnel carrier. It does quite well in the desert terrains and meets the expected speeds while under fire and heavy weight. Top brass immediately order the production of the APC and by October 1947, the first few roll out of the assembly line.\n\n-Diplomats are sent to Saudi Arabia, Baghdad, Amman, and Damascus to formulate a Pan-Islamic Association. Though Islamic in nature, it is a loose alliance with few hard strings attached to one another. Many religious conservatives in the nations are enticed and push their governments or kings to accept the invitation, which all eventually do through out 1947.\n\n-The Egyptian military know that their region and influence is small and so a small but well built weapon is needed for the common soldier. Basing off prototypes of the Jaroslav Holecek-designed Czech ZK 476, several small guns are designed. The generals pick the 26th one they see, and remember the Englishmen's alphabet, name it the \"Universal Z - Infantry Weapon\", or \"UZI\" for short.\n\nNATO Members (Blue):\n\n-United States\n\n-United Kingdom\n\n-Netherlands\n\n-Belgium\n\n-France\n\n-Portugal\n\n-Denmark\n\n-Iceland\n\n-Norway\n\nWarsaw Pact Members (Red):\n\n-USSR\n\n-Poland\n\n-Hungary\n\n-Yugoslavia\n\n-Romania\n\n-Azerbaijan\n\n-Czechoslovakia\n\n-East Germany\n\nPan-Islamic Association Members (Green):\n\n-Egypt\n\n-Saudi Arabia\n\n-Syria\n\n-Iraq\n\n-Jordan\n\nEuropean Coal and Steel Association Members:\n\n-Netherlands\n\n-United Kingdom\n\n-Belgium\n\n-France\n\n-Luxembourg\n\n-Denmark\n\n-Italy\n\nCaribbean Free Trade Union Members:\n\n-Colombia\n\n-Venezuela\n\n-Ecuador\n\n-Costa Rica\n\nPolitical Spectrum:\n\nFar Left - Left Wing - Centrist Left - Centrist - Centrist Right - Right Wing - Far Right\n\nTurn 3: 1948[]\n\nPost link: https://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1477971&p=48473520&viewfull=1#post48473520\n\nWorld Events from January 1st, 1948 to December 31st, 1948:\n\n-The United Kingdom continues the process of decolonization of its Asian territories, giving independence to Burma, Ceyon, and the Federation of Malaya while also backing the US in its protest against French continuance of the Indochina War. Burma and the Federation of Malaya immediately break out with communist insurgencies which are fought hard against with the new independent governments.\n\n-The Pakistani-Indian war for Kashmir ends in a stalemate, while later in the year India officially annexes the Hyderabad State in southern India.\n\n-The athletic company Puma is officially registered.\n\n-The French brutally destroy all resistance to their rule in Madagascar, mass executing rebel leaders and burning down sympathetic villages. It is revealed the French had embarked on an execution method of tying the hands and feet of prisoners then throwing them out of a plane flying over the ocean to drown lost at sea. The French colonial government is unapologetic for their actions as they now have solid control if the African island.\n\n-Italy has national elections in which the Italian Communist Party wins a sizable minority in government, though the Christian Democrat Party wins hold of Rome in the end.\n\n-As the conflict worsens in Palestine between Jewish and Arab militias, the British announce their unilateral withdraw from the territory. Within 4 hours of the last Englishman sailing off Palestine's beach, the Jewish militias declare the independent state of Israel while the Arabs almost immediately declare the Emirate of Palestine. The situation is made worse by the immediate invasion by Jordan and Syria with Iraqi military support. The Jews do quite well on the battlefield against the formal militaries of Syria and Jordan, but have a hard time fighting Arab rebels in the south. By November, the war ends with Palestine divided between the state of Israel and the lands conquered by Jordan and Iraq. Due to intense pressure by Egypt, the two Arab powers relinquish any land claim to what they've conquered and instead instate the Emirate of Palestine. By the end of the war, Israel is mostly victorious but remains solemn with the deaths of military commander Moshe Dayan and Haganah Chief of Staff Yisrael Galili. The Emirate of Palestine is automatically inducted into the PIA.\n\n-Costa Rica experiences a short civil war in which rebel military units seize power. They state their goal is to make a free constitutional government and begin the abolishment of the military throughout the rest of 1948.\n\n-Prime Minister of Iran Mohammad Mosaddegh calls for the auditing of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, who refuse. Parliament later in the year discuss nationalization of Iran's oil industry.\n\nPlayer Involved Conflicts:\n\n-Kingdom of Netherlands vs. Self-proclaimed Indonesian Republic (since March 1947)\n\n-Communist China vs. Nationalist China (since April 1947)\n\n-Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Pathet Lao vs. France, State of Vietnam (since December 1946)\n\nPlayer Events:\n\nNative Hunter - Republic of Colombia\n\nCapital City: Bogotá\n\nLeading Political Party: Colombian Conservative Party (Centrist-Right)\n\n-Importing P-51 Mustangs and Douglas A-26 Invaders from the United States, the Colombian military beefs up its air defenses. Its neighbors, particularly Peru and Venezuela, are ever so slightly anxious at Colombia's arms growth over the past few years, but Venezuela's concerns are quelled when an invitation to it and Ecuador to form a military alliance \"to protect each other from external and internal threats to our precious democracies\" is accepted by both.\n\n-Relations with the United States in the north grow closer with the Republic of Colombia as the US enters the Caribbean Free Trade Union and its mighty industrious economic power. The entrance of the US boots interests of Cuban politicians who join their island nation two months later to the trade agreement. With American access to the Panama Canal in the Trade Union, the economies of all included begin to climb, though some left wing groups bicker over the exploitation of the workers and land, despite the international connection between economies, resources and workers.\n\n-This is followed by Colombia's small entrance into NATO though few in Europe understand why a South American nation needs such military protection. Despite this, several United States Marine military advisers arrive in Colombia to aid in the development of the South American nation's military training programs.\n\n-Through the CTFU, Colombia lays out a plan to connect Bogotá, Quito, and Caracas with a super highway much like the German autobahn in May of 1948. Both governments agree and begin construction of their parts while Colombia's rail lines service the material supply to both its neighbors.\n\n-Continuing its active foreign policies, Colombia makes waves in the UN, first by establishing a World Humanitarian Coalition (WHC) UN organization which immediately sees support by the United Kingdom and Norway with the goal integrate international humanitarian efforts under one roof. This is immediately followed by Colombia's recognition of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam as an independent state from French administration. This is answered by a very angry speech by the French ambassador to the UN that is only somewhat cooled by America's recognition soon after. French-Colombian relations hit a historic low, and begin to blockade Vietnam from receiving Colombian shipments of medical supplies and coffee. In an event called the \"Tonkin Coffee Party\", a French cruiser that stopped a Colombian merchant ship is said to have dumped its cargo of several thousand pounds of premium Bogotá's Best straight into the ocean. Unfortunately, during the action several crates of rifles are found among the coffee exports. The crew of the ship deny any knowledge of the cargo and a week later, France ends all diplomatic relations with the Republic of Colombia.\n\n-Colombia's only response to the incident is passing the French Bean Subsidy Act, lowering taxes on coffee plantations. This sees an small increase of production over the year.\n\n-Hoping to turn its economy as green as a coffee leaf, Bogotá plans to build massive wind farms in the Andes provinces of the nation, some utilizing the newly developed 800 KVA wind turbine. Engineers guesstimate the project will be fully operationally powering large parts of the nation by 1952.\n\n-With continued eyes on the Andes, Bogotá outlines a plan to utilize the minerals underneath to diversify the economy from a mostly agricultural focus. Though safety is sometimes unconcerning to the companies attracted to investing in the exploits of the mountains, several large cavities are opened into the earth revealing promising veins of coal, nickel and zinc. With Colombia's invested future in wind technology, it is able to greatly export much of the coal to its neighbors, further boosting their economies with cheap electrical fuel.\n\n-In September, it is announced Bogotá has won the hosting of the 1952 Summer Olympics and plans out immediately outlined by the city to build what has been dubbed, \"El Ojo Del Mundo\" stadium on the outskirts of town. Though construction is planned to take place throughout 1949 and 1950, the groundbreaking for athlete's apartment complexes and tourist hotels are made by November of 48. The French consider boycotting, but no one really cares.\n\n-Toward the end of the year, Colombia's air force generals gaze out on the airstrips at all the new planes in their arsenal as they listen to the radio about Soviet and American engineers tinker with the new technology of jet engines and begin to wonder why can't they do that too. Though most of the work is based on what is public knowledge and mostly built from scrap, the military believes by the end of 1949 or 1950, they could have a working jet engine capable of being used by their planes and possibly sooner with foreign help.\n\nLoganIsAwesome - United States of America\n\nCapital City: Washington DC\n\nLeading Political Party: Republican Party (Centrist-Right)\n\n-The first week of January, 1948, witnesses the announcement of America's official withdraw from the Korean peninsula. By April, the last troop ship leaves for Japan or Hawaii and the ex-governing military staff of South Korea hand over a well-polished sword to the general staff of the newly independent Republic of Korea. It's a highly photographed event which many reporters, despite the continued presence of American forces elsewhere, highlight as part of an official end to the war in the Pacific. Official elections are held in later months in September, which vote overwhelmingly for democracy, basic rights, and capitalism. This results in a mighty grumble of the Korean Communist Party, of which is continuously seen less and less of in the south and more, across the border, in the North.\n\n-Continuing its pro-independence foreign policy, the United States surprisingly second's Colombia's appeal to the UN for the Democratic Republic of Vietnam be given independence from French rule. Charles de Gaulle in a public speech launches a scathing criticism of American interventionism in other's affairs, the irony of which is failed to be realized by many of his fellow Frenchmen. Though most nations plead no opinion on the matter and bypass any sort of vote in the UN, many Eastern Bloc nations are taking note of the division in the ranks of the west over such a small, backwater territory.\n\n-A subsidy package is passed in Congress giving tax breaks and such to automotive companies. In return for cheaper vehicles that \"the average Joe\" can afford, these companies benefit greatly from the US government.\n\n-The United States Air Corps is created as a separate entity from the United States Army and becomes highly organized. A large amount of funding to this new military branch goes into R&D, with a entire air-wing dedicated to experimental airplanes and jet technology. These men are highly trained, highly skilled, and above all, highly drilled.\n\n-The FCC funds the tinkering of making colored television. Some progress is made, though there's still quite a road ahead of them. Despite that, many Americans don't really take notice as there's fewer than a million televisions in American homes to begin with.\n\n-Truman spends a lengthy part of the State of the Union address in early 1948 talking about race relations in America, asking for public forums to be made to sort out the racial tensions that exploded the previous year. None such actually happen, especially in the South where many are uneasy about the federal government's involvement. South Carolina Governor Strom Thurmond is quoted of saying, \"I'll be damned to let that nigger-lover have a second term\", spawning his presidential candidacy announcement. Truman's campaign is mostly done through a tour of \"whistle stop speeches\" on the back of a touring train across the nation, though due to the racial issues brought up in the election, the crowds vary in size.\n\n-Despite the heavy focus on civil rights and Thurmond stealing the southern states of Georgia, South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Arkansas, Truman wins the presidency by a slim margin of 282 electoral votes.\n\n-With Truman's victory comes the establishment of a new division under the Department of Justice - the Civil Equality & Rights Division (CERD), that has a special cabinet spot with the President. This division outlines a plan for 1949 to have racial rallies across the states with the formation of a Equality Peace Corps throughout the states. This is meant with harsh criticism on both sides of the aisle and funding for the plan, which will be discussed in early 1949, is looking quite dismal already.\n\n-American officials in Washington and the CIA are embarrassed by the Soviet's publication of captured American spies in their homeland. Though it's a set back in international relations with the USSR, many Americans only regret that they were caught, not sent to begin with.\n\n-US Army engineers examine the Nazi's StG 44 assault rifle to possibly construct their own. Several designs are laid up but so far military commanders are indecisive of which to push through R&D.\n\n-America talks to both France and the United Kingdom on what to do with Germany. Both nations propose to the others their own separate plans. The United Kingdom proposes a plan to divide Germany between a \"North Germany\" and a \"South Germany\", with France annexing the Saarland. Soviet-occupied East Germany would hopefully integrate into North Germany, which would retain a limited trade union with its southern brother. Both would be demilitarized and neutral between the West and the Communists. Meanwhile, France proposes a separate plan to break up Germany entirely. A Republic of Bavaria and a Republic of Wuttenburg would be made in the south as France itself annexes large parts of the Saarland and lower Rhine region. In the north, a Republic of Westphalia and a Republic of Hannover would be created. The Soviet-occupied land would either become a Republic of Brandenburg or whatever the Soviets wish to do with it. The goal is to permanently destroy the chance of \"Germany\" becoming a threat to global peace for a third time. Both plans agree to unify Austria, whom all see more as another liberated nation rather than a defeated part of Germany.\n\nGriffster26 - Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia\n\nCapital City: Belgrade\n\nLeading Political Party: Communist Party of Yugoslavia (Far-Left)\n\n-With the aid of Yugoslav forces, the communist Greek rebels march onto the outskirts of Athens. Demoralized, exhausted and finding little international support, the royalists inside the city take up Belgrade's offer of absolute surrender. Communist forces occupy the rest of Greece, while the monarchy is formally dissolved and the People's Republic of Greece is officially declared a week later, with Nikos Zachariadis as its head. The former King of Greece exiles himself to London, United Kingdom along with any loyalist government leaders that can escape.\n\n-Witnessing the success of communist forces abroad in China, The People's Republic is the first nation to recognize them as the rightful government of all of China. Though in practice, it doesn't quite mean much until the Chinese civil war ends.\n\n-Later in the year, Tito liberalizes the far left nation by allowing the independent newspapers to run through the country. Though few actually pop in by the end of the year and the communist government still has firm control over the country, it helps give a legitimate view of Yugoslavia having western civil rights.\n\n-Belgrade prepares for the winter Olympics early much like Colombia, establishing venues around the city in preparation for the athletes and tourists.\n\n-Former members of the Ustasha, as well as any current underground members captured, are put on a show trial for treason against the state in Croatia. Most members are eventually sentenced either to death or extensive prison terms for their rebellious acts during World War II. Some of the newly independent newspapers point out the difference in treatment between those and Chetniks, but majority of the people in Yugoslavia are just happy to no longer be occupied by Axis powers.\n\n-The Yugoslav Air Force begins the development of jet technology, hoping to join the race for air supremacy in the \"jet age\" of airplanes. By the end of the year, schematics and a prototype of what is being called the Ikarus 451 is made.\n\n-Further development of synthetic fertilizers are made in Yugoslavia, though the death of two leading scientists in an accidental fertilizer plant explosion has set back some research. The cause of the explosion is determined to be from the failure of proper safety protocols, which is soon rectified for other chemical plants.\n\nMalos - Democratic Republic of Vietnam\n\nCapital City: Hanoi (French Occupied)\n\nLeading Political Party: Viet Minh (Left Wing Nationalist)\n\n-The Viet Minh government continues to play defensively throughout the war against the French war machine, especially after it had viciously put down a rebellion in Madagascar. Despite a troop surge and increased patrols, the French seem (and feel) that they making zero gains against their elusive enemy. The people around North Vietnam grow in support of the Viet Minh as reports of how well the Viet Minh armies treat their civilians and POWs alike, while there are rumors of the French torturing prisoners for information - or just for the sake of being a prisoner.\n\n-Hit and run tactics are used against the French forces, mostly against heavily armored positions that the Viet Minh are sure has no civilians nearby. While successful attacks are rare against such targets, the constant fear of ambush and assault at any moment by hidden Asians in the jungle make the common French soldier extremely anxious almost 24/7.\n\n-Though the Democratic Republic of Vietnam started the new year of 1948 as a theory of a nation, through the summer several nations such as the United States, Colombia and eventually Denmark and Norway call out to end the French intervention and officially recognize them as a state. The French, furious with such opposition from nations that conveniently have no colonies of their own, decide on a new strategy to fight the Viet Minh with the creation of the State of Vietnam. This state is recognized by France after its artificial creation and soon followed by the United Kingdom, though with the exception of those supporting what is now being called \"North Vietnam\", all other nations claim neutrality on the matter regarding the new \"South Vietnam\".\n\n-Viet Minh begin a public campaign denouncing French rule in all of Indochina, not just Vietnam and lay out a plan, over pirate radio to all who can hear, to create a \"Republic of Indochina\" after the war is over. The French respond with promises of making Cambodia and Laos \"associated states\" of France much like the State of Vietnam in the southern part of their colony. Reactions are mixed heavily in the rest of the territories as nationalists call for straight independence, leftists call for a united republic and centrists ask the French to continue with the creation of associated states. By the end of 1948, the political scene in Indochina becomes a quagmire of different factions throughout, some political while others slowly become paramilitary. The most prominent group supporting the Viet Minh and name themselves as a loose ally is a rebel group in Laos calling themselves \"Pathet Lao\".\n\n[Seed Eater] - Communist Party of China\n\nCapital City: N/A\n\nLeading Political Party: Communist Party of China (Far-Left)\n\n-The war in China heats up even further throughout the winter of 1948 with a huge surprise march against the nationalists toward the sea in the southeast. The assaults are met with constant retreats by the Kuomintang whom by May begin evacuating some forces to the islands of Formosa and Hainan, including the Republic's formal government. By July, the new borders begin to stabilize with help of nationalist uses of landmines near the coast, in some cases only a 50 miles from the ocean.\n\n-As the southern campaign slows down in pace, the communist army strikes north to enact a large encirclement strategy, forcing a complete cut off of Kuomintang forces for hundreds of miles off from the rest of the world. The initial campaign has great success but the nationalists fight harder to break out of the encirclement in early fall and as the snows of winter in 1948 begin to fall, launch a desperate ballyhoo to reconnect themselves to their southern forces.\n\n-Mao offers terms of surrender to Nationalist forces throughout both campaigns, which results in mixed success. At times, nationalist forces give up completely, sometimes they join, and other, fewer times, they shoot the messenger.\n\n-Foreign watchers of the conflict feel that it may be over quite soon.\n\nSatansick - Kingdom of the Netherlands\n\nCapital City: Amsterdam\n\nLeading Political Party: Labor Party (Centrist Left)\n\n-In April of 1948, the Netherlands purchases a British aircraft carrier and rebrands it the HNLMS Karel Doorman. It is subsequently sent to the south Pacific to participate in the Indonesian war, which it helps greatly with.\n\n-The new year brings fresh offensives from both sides in the Dutch East Indies, with the Netherlands giving an all out push on rebel forces in the island of Java. Harsh resistance is met in the first few days, but is quickly broken and the island is firmly secured by the Dutch within a month. The military then establishes a large military base in Jakarta to coordinate the final campaign against the so-called \"Indonesian Republic\" on the island of Sumatra.\n\n-In the final days of the battle for Jakarta, Dutch forces discover the body of Sutomo, the Indonesian military leader, in a bombed out warehouse that seems to have work as an impromptu command center. This is a huge morale boost for the Dutch troops in the war and a huge blow to Indonesian nationalism across all the islands.\n\n-Seeing as the war is almost won and many islands in the Pacific have been firmly secured by the military for quite some time, Amsterdam allows regional elections to be held in the Dutch East Indies. This boosts public morale just a little, proving that the Dutch are not simply conquerors and colonists once more. This is improved with the announcement that native Indonesians will be paid the same wages as their Dutch counterparts.\n\n-Meanwhile at home, the Dutch government expands the Schiphol airport at the capital to increase air traffic. By the end of the year, it becomes a major hub for air traffic in western Europe.\n\n-Dutch scientists take another look at selenium cells, which were discovered in the mid 1800s to able to convert light into electricity. Now that electricity is more common, these cells may have a renewed purpose.\n\n-The military's research department continues research with German V2 rockets and manage to build their own, Dutch version. Though the initial tests show they have a 50/50 chance of exploding on launch, it's a step forward.\n\n-The elections change the Dutch government to a Labor majority, with Willem Drees becoming Prime Minister. The new Labor government begins a new economic policy, which starts with reducing the value of the guilder by 30% to entice foreign investors to the Netherlands. As consumer goods have finally begun to rise, they also work out a plan to phase off of food stamps. These economic policies come as a positive as the world hits a minor postwar recession.\n\nMilkdairy - Union of Soviet Socialist Republics\n\nCapital City: Moscow\n\nLeading Political Party: Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Far-Left)\n\n-The USSR in March of 1948 begins a nation-building program. To compete with the United State's call to form a plan on Germany, the USSR just outright declares their occupational zone an independent Democratic Republic of Germany. Two months later, the USSR creates the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in Asia. Kim Il-Sung becomes its leader, though Soviet troops remain in the land and Soviet administration remains as oversight for the newly created communist state. Kim is bitter over the matter, but it's hard to do much about it when you have a superpower breathing down your neck.\n\n-Later in the year, the USSR in a surprise move by many, gives 'independence' to the Baltic states. Though all three already have their own communist government and unanimously vote to join the Warsaw Pact, it gives those people a new sense of direction and purpose, even if a communist one.\n\n-In an international surprise, the USSR announces it has actively caught American spies within the USSR. The Kremlin demonizes the US as a destroyer of friendship and a sinister nation, though it willingly - and very publicly - returns many of the few caught to American authorities in West Berlin.\n\n-Due to a international security thread that the Kremlin refuses to openly discuss, the Soviet Union begins to route large numbers of the Red Army into their fellow ally Romania. Bucharest warmly welcomes the troops who soon are garrisoned with their own across the country, but are worried and confused by the suddenly influx of troops.\n\n-Following the previous year's tinkering with the AK-47, Soviet generals settle on a design for an all-purpose machine gun, dubbed the PK Machine Gun. Manufacturing is quickly started and early units of the weapon are seen in several divisions. It excellently serves a double use as an infantry weapon as well as a vehicle-mounted gun.\n\n-After extensive trials, retrials, and testing, the Soviet military reveals their new weapon of the air - the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17. It is glorified as the most advanced jet aircraft of the age.\n\n-Khrushchev announces new social policies and government reforms to deal with the death of Stalin. What the west is dubbing as \"de-Stalinization\", its focus is to remove the Soviet economy from a forced-labor driven system, starting with the ending of the gulags.\n\nSniperComZero - Republic of Egypt\n\nCapital City: Cairo\n\nLeading Political Party: New Wafd Party (Centrist Right)\n\n-With final testing of the Egyptian APC \"Anubis I\" complete, the military orders thousands to be manufactured. Throughout the year, those built are spread out across various army units and begin training with them.\n\n-The Egyptian economy slowly takes off in 1948 with the exploitation of Libyan oil fields, creating revenue for the government and jobs for the people. This is a benefit as the world gets hit by a light postwar recession.\n\n-The Wafd Party leading the government in Cairo establishes a reform of the country's governmental structure in January 1948. The system is very much like the United States, with a federalized government on top of various state-provinces. Term limits for MPs are set, as well as for the Prime Minister. By July, it is announced national elections will be held at the beginning of 1949, which various parties begin to scramble for support. By late fall, though, it becomes clear that the Society of the Muslim Brothers is making vast gains in popularity.\n\n-Cairo implements a new set of religious laws for Egypt by building a hierarchy of citizens based on faith. Muslims are clearly at the top, very closely followed by Christians whom are given a sizable amount of freedoms very closely to Muslims. The very tiny Jewish population in Egypt also receives some benefits. Anyone who has either no confession or follows the Flying Spaghetti Monster is pressured to convert to Islam or face exile. Since there are very, very few in that last tier, it hardly goes noticed if anyone really left.\n\n-Egypt pressures those in the Pan-Islamic Association to adopt democracy as a government type. Syria modestly supports this as they are already a democracy, but the only Jordan has considerations for it following their dismal defeat in the Arab-Israeli War in which the people are unhappy with the government. Most Arab nations are not too happy with Egypt's lack of participation against Israel and pressure to drastically change government comes as a turn off to most.\n\n-Happy that they can now transport their troops quicker and easier, the Egyptian military staff looks for more weaponry designs for them, especially to compliment the Egyptian Uzi. Gunsmiths begin analyzing what they think is the best current rifle in the world - the AK 47 - and look to possible ways they can improve it.\n\n-The Egyptian military also seek to fully mechanize their armed forces with the beginning designs of a new main battle tank. The military makes gives the requirements that it have a 90mm main gun and light enough to be transported easily by trains. Mechanical engineers quickly draw up some schematics by the end of 1948.\n\nNATO Members (Blue):\n\n-United States\n\n-United Kingdom\n\n-Netherlands\n\n-Belgium\n\n-France\n\n-Portugal\n\n-Denmark\n\n-Iceland\n\n-Norway\n\n-Colombia\n\nWarsaw Pact Members (Red):\n\n-USSR\n\n-Poland\n\n-Hungary\n\n-Yugoslavia\n\n-Romania\n\n-Azerbaijan\n\n-Czechoslovakia\n\n-East Germany\n\nPan-Islamic Association Members (Green):\n\n-Egypt\n\n-Saudi Arabia\n\n-Syria\n\n-Iraq\n\n-Jordan\n\n-Palestine\n\nEuropean Coal and Steel Association Members:\n\n-Netherlands\n\n-United Kingdom\n\n-Belgium\n\n-France\n\n-Luxembourg\n\n-Denmark\n\n-Italy\n\nCaribbean Free Trade Union Members:\n\n-Colombia\n\n-Venezuela\n\n-Ecuador\n\n-Costa Rica\n\n-United States\n\n-Cuba\n\nPolitical Spectrum:\n\nFar Left - Left Wing - Centrist Left - Centrist - Centrist Right - Right Wing - Far Right\n\nNotes: On the map, diagonal lines represent territories that are being fought over at the end of the year, while horizontal lines represent territories that are militarily occupied but retain native governance.\n\nTurn 4: 1949[]\n\nPost link: https://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1477971&p=48525444&viewfull=1#post48525444\n\nWorld Events from January 1st, 1949 to December 31st, 1949:\n\n-Italy formally joins the European Coal & Steel Association in March of 1949.\n\n-A gas line explosion rocks Pyongyang, unfortunately killing much of the North Korean communist leadership - including Kim Il-Sung. The Soviet Red Army and KGB immediately investigate the explosion on behalf of their Korean comrades and foul play was determined. After some intensive interrogation techniques, several Koreans confess to an attempted coup with possible ties to South Korea and are executed later in the year.\n\n-A massive earthquake devastates central Ecuador near the city of Ambato. Thousands are injured or dead while thousands more are left homeless. This shakes up the economy of the Caribbean Free Trade Union.\n\n-Newfoundland officially joins the Canadian Confederation.\n\n-A military coup seizes control of Venezeula and ousts the elected government in late 1949. A junta is installed with Marcos Pérez Jiménez as the new man in charge, begins a campaign to inspire intense nationalism into the people and solidify military control of the country. Despite the change in government, they decided to remain in the CFTU.\n\n-With Costa Rica's civil war the previous year, Ecuador's major earthquake and Venezuela's government change, the Caribbean Free Trade Union's tied economy hits a rocky time in its early life and foreign investors are uncertain of its future.\n\n-De-Havilland Comet, the world's first commercial jet airliner, takes off in England.\n\n-The Shah of Iran survives an assassination attempt, which invigorates him to participate in politics more. Prime Minister Mossadegh wants him to \"reign, not rule\" instead and forms the National Front in response as the Shah establishes the Senate of Iran full of royalist supporters. The primary platform of the National Front soon becomes the nationalization of oil production in Iran.\n\n-Apartheid is made the official policy of National Party in South Africa.\n\n-The Democratic Republic of Greece pressures Great Britain to cede Cyprus to Greek control. London refuses starkly and sends the light cruiser HMS Newfoundland off Cyprus's coast.\n\n-The Syrian military takes over the country and dissolves the elected government in a bloodless coup. The people are mostly content with the move, after seeing their elected officials fail them in the Arab-Israeli War. The new military junta totes a leftist philosophy and withdraws itself from the Pan-Islamic Association after receiving Soviet support.\n\n-The UN's WHC, under the leadership of Colombia, passes a resolution condemning France's wars in Madagascar and Indochina. Many left-wing nations support the measure, along with a couple Nordic nations. France is less than pleased.\n\nPlayer Involved Conflicts:\n\n-Kingdom of Netherlands vs. Self-proclaimed Indonesian Republic (since March 1947)\n\n-People's Republic of China vs. Republic of China + United States (Limited) (since April 1947)\n\nPlayer Events:\n\nNative Hunter - Republic of Colombia\n\nCapital City: Bogotá\n\nLeading Political Party: Colombian Conservative Party (Centrist-Right)\n\n-The Colombian Navy in March receives a major funding boost and directs most of the money toward infrastructure. Several major cities along both coastlines begin construction of dry-docks and naval yards, with the huge number of construction projects boosting jobs in the coastal cities for some time. The navy hopes to lease much of these dry-docks for public and merchant use, hoping to make some extra revenue for the government as much as helping grow the economy.\n\n-Bogata launches a low-wage housing campaign for Colombia's poor. Subsidies are given to construction companies to build massive apartment buildings throughout the country while some money is put aside for hotels, encouraging use of them by both the poor and tourists. Some older conservative leaders mutter about \"go find a job first\" but most of the people of the nation are far from complaining.\n\n-And in another act to help the poor of Colombia, the labor party slips by the government a new food stamp program somewhat based on the Dutch post-war program to help get food to the needy.\n\n-To encourage secondary education and the advancement of science, Colombia launches a massive university program for the nation. Most educational funding goes into medical and science studies to bring Colombia up to date on the latest technological trends. The University of Bogata uses this money to further the study of plants and how they could biologically be improved.\n\n-Leading the CFTU, invitations are sent out to several nations around the Caribbean. This results in the dictator of the Dominican Republic, who is keen on funding his military even more, to join for the economic benefits. On the flip side, Honduras who just recently had one of the more democratic elections in its history, joins to help boost coffee exports and fund infrastructure projects.\n\n-The Colombian government begins to regulate the safety of mining in the nation as they encourage the growth of that industry. Some of the regulations scare off a couple foreign investors, but many of the industry's growing workforce is grateful for the new rules. To further mining industries in the region, Colombia works out a deal to lease mining operations in Ecuador under the CFTU. The same deal is offered to Peru, but is rejected.\n\n-A military alliance is offered to Brazil also and they accept some one-on-one free trade aspects of the diplomacy but refuse an outright military alliance just yet.\n\n-Colombia's biggest attempt at diplomacy in 1949 happens in late summer with the launch of the Union of South American Nations. It is an intergovernmental organization to help with diplomacy of South American countries, which first meets in Bogata in early October. Starting member nations include Colombia, Ecuador, Chile, Argentina, Bolivia and Brazil.\n\n-After great strides in jet research, the Colombian Air Force reveal in November what they're dubbing the Colombian F-86 Sabre jet fighter. Only a few are produced for testing, but it's already assumed it'll be the CAF's main fighter jet in the coming years.\n\n-With a number of capitalist projects developed by Bogata, the Communist Party of Colombia begins an expensive propaganda campaign to curb the \"exploitation\" of Colombia's workers and peasants.\n\nLoganIsAwesome - United States of America\n\nCapital City: Washington DC\n\nLeading Political Party: Republican Party (Centrist-Right)\n\n-The beginning of the year sees the official end of the American occupation of Japan. A ceremony is held in Tokyo where the military governors officially hand over control of the nation to the national government of Japan. Despite the ending of occupation, the United States leaves behind a modest military presence for defense of Japan, both internal and external. A month later, the Japanese parliament officially bans communist parties from the country's government.\n\n-The military presence in Japan is complimented with the construction of air fields and naval bases throughout the Pacific on islands the US annexed, most prominently in Okinawa. By time construction is mostly finished at the end of 1949, the US has a large strategic position in the Pacific Ocean.\n\n-Much of the larger highways of the US's interstate system are completed this year and progress seems to be a little head of schedule.\n\n-After much international discussion, France and the United Kingdom agree to merge their occupational zones of Germany into an independent country. On May 23rd, the Federal Republic of Germany is born and is quickly inducted into both NATO and the European Coal & Steel Association.\n\n-In March, the United States forms the National Administration for Space & Aeronautics (NASA) for the development of technological advancement. They're granted a gigantic budget by the US and given the goal of one day planting an American on the moon. Many former Nazi scientists are soon spotted on NASA's lab complexes developing large rocket engines.\n\n-American nuclear scientists begin what the War Department is calling \"Project Nautilus\" to build nuclear engines for naval vessels.\n\n-The FBI reveal the summaries of several large investigations into the KKK and make many prominent arrests of leading the organization's leading members. This blow to the already naturally shrinking organization feels like a deathblow to the remaining members. A couple state chapters completely dissolve while those in the deep south remain a shadow of their former selves.\n\n-The KKK arrests proceed Congress finally passing the American Equality Act, which bans discrimination against a person for their religion, race, gender, or sexual orientation.\n\n-The US Army works out prototype rifles with contracts to the small arms company ArmaLite, which produces the AR-5 and AR-10. The Army quickly adopts these weapons and orders large quantities so to spread use over the whole military. Despite these developments, the Pentagon pushes ArmaLite to continue producing advanced weapons.\n\n-Using islands annexed from Japan, the US Air Force begins limited operations against communist forces in China hoping to slow the advance of the red menace. Thousands and thousands of military hardware is shipped to Taiwan to support the nationalist forces. Some in Congress complain about the lack of declaration of war to begin such kinds of operations, but Truman is quoted of saying, \"It's not a war, it's a police action.\"\n\nGriffster26 - Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia\n\nCapital City: Belgrade\n\nLeading Political Party: Communist Party of Yugoslavia (Far-Left)\n\n-Yugoslav doctors begin experimenting with cell cultures to study the growth of cancer cells.\n\n-To prevent some population loss, Belgrade passes the \"Antisemitism Act\" to making discrimination against Jews illegal across the country. This gives the small Jewish population that had survived the Nazis some motivation to stay in the country. A memorial is build on the grounds of the Jasenovac concentration camp as a further sign of friendship to the Jewish people.\n\n-A statue of Stjepan Filipovic is built in Valjevo and he is declared a national hero.\n\n-King Peter II, the last king of Yugoslavia before his self-exilement is welcomed back to his country albeit not as a monarch. The offer is kindly refused and he continues to live in the USA.\n\n-Yugoslavia spends much of the spring strengthening ties with its southern neighbor, Greece, recognizing its communist government as the legitimate government of the nation and giving Greeks living in Yugoslavia special minority status. Where Greek friendship starts, Turkish friendship ends as Belgrade announces its recognition of Greek claims on Turkey's coast, alarming the Turkish government a great deal.\n\n-Athens and Belgrade also begin co-developing arms technology using the famous AK-47 as a model. By the end of the year, a Yugoslav M49 and Greek AT-49 are developed and orders for mass production is sent out to state-owned factories. With arms cooperation comes army cooperation as Greece's and Yugoslavia's armies coordinate a number of war games throughout the year. The intent is said to retrain the Greek army to full military capabilities after several years of civil war, but Turkey keeps a nervous eye on the developments all the same.\n\n-Though experiments with cell cultures are aimed at combating cancer, a side development using microbes is discovered that produces a better fertilizer from decaying organic material.\n\nMyBumBum - Republic of China\n\nCapital City: Taipei\n\nLeading Political Party: Kuomintang (Right-Wing)\n\n-Nationalist troops are pushed hard against the coastline of China in early 1949. With the encirclement and loss of their central Chinese territories, the Republic of China seems to be on its last leg until the massive arrival of American hardware and supplies reach nationalist hands. In some strategic locations, the US Air Force gives cover to retreating Kuomintang troops, allowing large numbers of soldiers to make it back to friendly lines.\n\n-The Republic's army receives thousands of American Sherman tanks and even more rifles which are immediately put to use by the ragged Chinese forces and by the end of 1949, the lines between communist and nationalist hold for the time being with Nationalists controlling a few major coastal cities in the north and a small portion of coastline in the south.\n\n-Many Chinese businessmen and loyalists to the Kuomintang are evacuated to Taiwan for their safety and secure their finances for the war effort. The Republic also begins printing fresh bills of money - the New Taiwan Dollar - to curb inflation that has wreaked havoc on nationalist funding over the past few years.\n\n-Corruption is continued to be cracked down on within the military, with the execution of some junior officers in August for what some are calling minor offenses. Some people are upset by the harsh reprisals of even the most minimal of crimes but others in the army see it as a necessity for the dire condition they are in for the war.\n\n-Using new American equipment, the Nationalist forces begin the extensive use of radio communications to strengthen the coordination of their military efforts. These greatly aid them in holding back the communists from pushing them into the sea.\n\n-The Kuomintang begin welding scrap metal to any vehicle on the mainland they can use in the war effort to supplement the new Sherman tanks, making hand-made APCs and lightly armored fighting vehicles.\n\n-Attempts to make improved flamethrowers are attempted but only minimal progress is made throughout the year as supplies are crucial for the war effort and not much is left for tinkering.\n\n[Seed Eater] - People's Republic of China\n\nCapital City: Beijing\n\nLeading Political Party: Communist Party of China (Far-Left)\n\n-As the winter snow thaws in early spring of 1949, the People's Liberation Army launches its final campaign against the Nationalist forces in China, closing encirclement and pressing on to secure the coastlines. By April, much of central China overrun by communist forces and in June, the last nationalist soldiers are on the coast, Taiwan and Hainan.\n\n-With victory nearing, Mao announces the establishment of the People's Republic of China with Beijing as its capital. Communist restructuring of the nation begins immediately with the collectivization of farms throughout the mainland and the creation of worker industry boards for the democratic management of factories. The PLA oversees some of these processes to insure their installment. Major nationalization of major industries are coordinated with this process as well as the appropriation of land.\n\n-The first major project for the PRC is the reconstruction of cities and towns devastated by years of war. This process ends up creating a massive amount of jobs for the homeless, unemployed and underemployed and the construction of large state-owned housing establishments throughout the country.\n\n-As PLA peacefully establishes control over China's western provinces, an envoy is sent to Turkestan to begin talks to integrate the nation into China proper. The leader of the communist central Asian nation, Ehmetjan Qasimi, rejects the invitation for a chance for Uyghurs to have independence.\n\n-Continuing its first steps into the international community, Mao begins shipping food and military supplies to the Viet Minh and North Korea, though the latter is watched closely by Soviet troops.\n\nSatansick - Kingdom of the Netherlands\n\nCapital City: Amsterdam\n\nLeading Political Party: Labor Party (Centrist Left)\n\n-The Dutch war in Indonesia comes to an end by May 1949 as the last of the rebel forces surrender in central Sumatra.\n\n-Netherlands's military design a hybrid fuel system, using liquid and solid fuels to help boost rocket power.

The air force is greatly expanded, especially with MiG-17s and a rigorous training for the pilots of such. As part of the reform program, the KGB recruits the top performing career soldiers in every branch of the military to form a special operations branch - Spentznazs - of the security service. The Air Force also receives funding to develop helicopters, a new dynamic in air transportation & war, to see if they can enlarge current carry load capacity.\n\n-On the civil front, the USSR relaxes some more tight controls over civilian life of the workers and peasants as part of its continued de-Stalinization program. Censorship, restrictions on speech, press and assembly are soon lightened from the Kremlin's tight control, though unlike Yugoslavia, no new independent newspapers really pop up mostly due to the Soviet people not really knowing what to do with freedoms many have never even experienced before.\n\n-Khrushchev also begins some domestic economic reforms, quietly letting in small forms of capitalism into the country.
