        "text": "Lawrence W. Woerner doesn’t have to look far to pinpoint when his passion for the University of Dayton started.\n\nA member of UD’s baseball team while a student, Woerner graduated in 1976, then co-founded MW de Montigny Woerner Limitada, a human resources and benefits consulting firm in Latin America.\n\nAfter selling his Brazil-based consulting firm to Mercer, the world’s largest human resources consulting firm, Woerner assumed a series of expanded roles for Mercer. He served on the firm’s executive committee, holding a series of global roles including chief human resources officer, chief administrative officer and global head of regions during the years before his retirement in 2012.\n\nBut he didn’t forget his alma mater. Inspired by his four years as a pitcher for the Flyers, Woerner and his wife, Rosemari, are long-time supporters of UD baseball. The team’s current home base, Woerner Field, is named after the couple. They have also made other significant gifts to other athletic projects, scholarships and the College of Arts and Sciences.\n\nHe has also served as a member of the advisory council for the University of Dayton’s College of Arts and Sciences, and was a University of Dayton board member for nine years, chairing the athletic committee during part of his time on the board.\n\nSpecial Service Award\n\nFor volunteer service to the University of Dayton\n\nThe Special Service Award is presented to an alumnus who has performed a special service or displayed exceptional diligence on behalf of the University of Dayton.\n\nSpecial Service awards are given for extended service or for successfully completing a special project or program on behalf of the University or the Alumni Association. To be eligible, a person must hold a degree from the University of Dayton.\n\nPast Recipients"
