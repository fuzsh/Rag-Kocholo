        "text": "Appendix 1: Data\n\nThis appendix first discusses the guiding philosophy of the GGDC/UNU-WIDER Economic Transformation Database (ETD) to ensure it meets requirements of consistency necessary for growth and productivity analysis. We then discuss the relation to other publicly available datasets, followed by a description of the construction of annual data on value added and employment for 2-digit manufacturing industries.\n\n1.1 Consistency Requirements\n\nGross VA in real and nominal prices is from the National Accounts (NA) published by the National Statistical Institutes (NSIs). Value added (VA) by sector is compiled according to the UN System of National Accounts (SNA). This system accounts for income from formal and informal activities. In addition, international comparability is high, in principle. However, NSIs frequently change their methodologies and conduct new surveys. The general approach is to start with GDP data for the most recent available benchmark years from the NA provided by the NSI or Central Bank. These data are typically compiled according to the 2008 SNA (UN 2008), but it varies by country, as some countries still follow the approaches outlined in the 1993 SNA (UN 1993). Historical NA series are subsequently linked to the benchmark year data. The linking procedure ensures that growth rates of individual series are retained while absolute levels are adjusted according to the most recent information and methods.\n\nVolume data are estimated separately from constructed series of nominal VA and price deflators. This has several advantages. In cases where price statistics are missing or inaccurate, price trends of the aggregate sector are representative of the underlying detailed sectors. It is more reasonable to make this assumption for price developments than for volume growth rates. In addition, this method allows information on price developments to be added from external sources, such as the consumer price index, when this is not available from primary sources.\n\nThe VA from real estate activities (ISIC rev. 4, industry L) consists of VA from rental activities and imputations of owner-occupied housing. The latter imputation is based on an equivalent rent approach and is part of the official estimation of GDP. Imputed income from dwellings does not have an employment equivalent and therefore is preferably excluded in productivity analyses. This is possible because real estate activities are separately reported in the ETD.\n\nEmployment in the ETD is defined as “all persons engaged,” thus including all paid employees, but also self-employed and family workers, with an age of 15 years and older. Hence, it aims to include formal and informal workers. Ideally, labor input is measured in hours worked, as differences in hours worked across sectors affect sectoral productivity gaps (Gollin et al. 2014; McCullough 2017). However, the data, insofar as they are available, are irregular and information on hours worked typically covers only the formal sector.\n\nEmployment information is typically not available from a country’s NA, as it is not part of the SNA. For most countries, population censuses are used as these ensure full coverage of the (formal and informal) working population and a reliable sectoral breakdown. However, population censuses are typically quinquennial or decennial and cannot be used to derive annual trends. Moreover, many developing countries had a census scheduled for 2019/2020, which could not be incorporated because of a lag in data dissemination. Several population censuses have also been postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nWhenever appropriate, population censuses are used to indicate absolute levels of employment, and labor force surveys (LFS) and establishment surveys are used to indicate trends in between. For countries where population census data are not used, nationally representative LFS are used as benchmarks instead. If employment series are not available to measure trends between benchmarks, the interpolation between benchmarks is based on the ILO model-based sectoral employment trends or the average trends in labor productivity between benchmark years for non-agricultural sectors. Employment in agriculture is interpolated between benchmarks using series of the economically active population in agriculture (see de Vries et al. 2021 for further information).\n\nHere, we provide one specific example of how we arrived at manufacturing employment estimates for Ethiopia. To start with, source data on manufacturing employment in Ethiopia provide conflicting information on levels and trends. The trend in manufacturing employment between the 2005 and 2013 national LFS suggests an annual manufacturing employment growth rate of 2.7%, which is lower than the population growth rate of 3.1% and total employment growth rate of 3.8% reported in the LFS for this period. Furthermore, the growth rate conflicts with other sources, which indicate higher growth rates of manufacturing employment. For example, data from the small-scale industry surveys for 2006 and 2014 suggest an annual growth rate of 14.6%. The data from the urban employment and unemployment survey for 2010 and 2014 give an annual growth rate of 10.3%, and the large and medium-scale manufacturing censuses for 2010–2015 give an annual growth rate of 15.3%. We follow the approach by Diao et al. (2021) to estimate recent levels and trends in manufacturing employment for Ethiopia. Namely, we combine manufacturing workers reported in the large and medium-scale manufacturing censuses (including temporary workers), non-food manufacturing workers from the small-scale industry survey (excluding seasonal workers), and urban and rural food manufacturing workers reported in the living standards measurement study surveys.\n\n1.2 Relation to Other Publicly Available Datasets\n\nSeveral alternative sectoral datasets are publicly available. The best known is the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI). Figures for VA in the WDI are based on national accounts data and therefore comparable to those in the ETD. For employment, recent editions of the WDI use ILO model-based estimates.\n\nThe measurement of sectoral employment in the ETD and the ILO model have several similarities, including the selection of available statistical sources to create inter-temporally consistent series and the use of nationally representative data sources. Yet, whereas the ETD prefers population censuses, the ILO model prioritizes LFS. Sometimes LFS are not nationally representative, but are biased toward urban agglomerations. It also matters whether an LFS is conducted during the dry or harvesting season. For example, the 2014 and 2018 LFS of Burkina Faso were conducted in the dry season. As a result, the employment share in agriculture drops from about 80% in 2006 to around 30% from 2014 onwards in the ILO model-based estimates. The ETD aims to avoid such unreliable series. Another major difference is the use of econometric imputation methods to fill blanks in the ILO model (see Klasen 2019 for a discussion).\n\nPerhaps most importantly, at the 19th International Conference of Labor Statisticians (ICLS) in 2013 it was decided to narrow the definition of the labor force to those who work for pay or profit (ICLS 2013). That revised definition of the labor force induces a downward effect on the level of agricultural employment, because farmers that mainly or exclusively produce for own use are no longer included in employment by the ILO model-based estimates (Gaddis et al. 2020; Klasen 2019).\n\nThe revised definition of the labor force by the ILO is problematic for several reasons (Klasen 2019). First, it will be difficult to obtain accurate and consistent time series of employment in developing countries where subsistence production is common. Second, it will result in breaks in the series. Third, it will create inconsistency between VA and employment. Production of agricultural goods for own use falls within the boundaries of the SNA and is therefore included in agricultural VA, even if workers are not reported by the ILO. Labor productivity suddenly shoots up as output is measured, but workers are not measured. Fourth, it results in misleading information on the sectoral distribution of employment (Gaddis et al. 2020). Subsistence farmers who mostly produce for subsistence, but outside the peak season undertake some non-agricultural activities will now be categorized according to these minor off-farm activities.\n\nCurrently it is not clear whether, how or for which countries and time periods the 19th ICLS standards have been implemented. This problem also applies to the time series of agricultural employment in the WDI, which directly derive from the ILO model-based estimates. The ETD aims to avoid these issues, as it includes subsistence production workers.\n\n1.3 Manufacturing Data for Registered Firms\n\nThe primary source for constructing the 2-digit manufacturing data is the UNIDO Industrial and Statistical Database (UNIDO INDSTATS 2, 2020). This is complemented with national accounts or industrial surveys from NSIs when there is no reliable benchmark or consistent series from the UNIDO INDSTATS 2. For example, Nigeria’s value added series from 1997 to 2018 is not available in UNIDO INDSTATS 2. To obtain a series for Nigeria, we use detailed industry trends from the rebased national accounts data. The general approach follows Pahl and Timmer (2020). The guiding principle is to ensure the data is consistent over time, across variables (employment and value added) and across countries.\n\nIn Pahl and Timmer (2020), missing data are treated as follows: First, all negative entries for all variables are set to missing. In the primary data (INDSTATS), zeros could appear when the industry is not sampled in the respective year or when there is no economic activity in that industry. To distinguish between these two, Pahl and Timmer (2020) treat zeros as missing (i) if an industry has a positive value in year 1, a zero in year 2, but a positive value in year 3, assuming that zero in between is a missing value. Again, zero values are treated as missing if (ii) industry records zeros at the beginning or end of time series but emerges from 0% to more than 5% of total manufacturing and vice versa, allowing for the possibility that industries emerge and vanish, only if the change is not beyond 5% of total manufacturing. This indicates a more considerable change in series from (or to) zero as missing information. Since our sample is mainly for developing countries where apart from the light industry (food processing and textile industries), the average share of other sectors is about 5%, treating zeros as missing if the share in year t − 1 or t + 1 is less than 5% of total manufacturing, would drop most missing observations or sectors. Therefore, we make treatment of zeros and missing information country- and sector-specific. For example, if the average share of a series of a specific industry is more than 10%, between 5 and 10% and below 5% then we treat zeros as missing if the industry emerges from zero to 5%, 1% and 0.2% of total manufacturing, respectively. Finally, observations are treated as missing if there is a positive value for other variables. For example, if there is a positive value for value added, but the employment variable is zero, we treat the zeros as missing information.\n\nWe fill in missing data using interpolation, extrapolation and backpolation as follows. We use value added in basic prices as a benchmark for value added series, then interpolate between benchmark years, backpolate from the last benchmark or extrapolate from the latest benchmark using growth trend from national accounts data if detailed industry series are available in national accounts data or industrial production survey. If there is no detailed industry data from national accounts or industrial production surveys, we use growth trends of total manufacturing value added from the INDSTATS. For employment series, we use the number of employees as benchmarks, then interpolate, extrapolate and backpolate using the growth trend of total manufacturing labor productivity trend. We express value added in constant prices following Schreyer (2002), where domestic industry deflator is the US industry deflator adjusted for domestic inflation in the manufacturing sector. The data cover 40 developing countries that are also in the ETD (Table 3). The data are disaggregated into 2-digit manufacturing industries (see Table 4). This results in data for value added (current and constant prices) and employment at the 2-digit ISIC Rev. 4 level from 1990 to 2018.\n\nAppendix 2: Additional Tables and Figures\n\nSee Fig. 5 and Tables 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n\nAppendix 3: A Comparison with Rodrik (2016)\n\nThe recent expansion in manufacturing employment, in particular in Sub-Saharan Africa, contrasts with findings of de-industrialization by Rodrik (2016). Why do the findings differ? First, the analysis in Rodrik (2016) is based on a longer panel dataset including pre-1990 observations. Second, Rodrik (2016) uses a smaller set of countries. Third, the ETD uses more recent national accounts data and new employment sources. Coverage of new (often small-scale manufacturing and services) activities tends to improve if new surveys and censuses are conducted. Hence, the findings could also differ due to data vintages.\n\nWe examine these potential explanations in Table 10. As before, the dependent variable is the manufacturing employment share. Regressions are estimated using (1). Only results of the decadal dummy for the 2010s are shown. Column (1) reproduces the baseline findings. In Column (2), observations before 1990 are included by extrapolating the ETD series backwards using the GGDC 10-sector database (10SD) and the Extended Africa Sector Database (EASD). In Column (3), the country sample is restricted to countries included in the 10SD used by Rodrik (2016). In Column (4), the time series for the 10SD countries are updated using trends from the ETD, hence retaining levels of economic activity reported in the 10SD.\n\nFirst, consider the comparison for Sub-Saharan Africa. Column (2) extends the sample by including observations pre-1990. This does not substantially change the baseline results. Next, note that 18 Sub-Saharan African countries are included in the ETD. Of these, 11 are included in the 10SD. Column (3) restricts the country sample to those in the 10SD. This results indicate a positive yet insignificant industrialization trend for Sub-Saharan Africa. It suggests that the results of Rodrik (2016) are sensitive to sample heterogeneity. Indeed, for several of the additional Sub-Saharan African countries in the ETD we observe industrialization. Some countries, such as Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Lesotho and Mozambique, experience industrialization patterns that significantly exceed the global average trend (discussed in Sect. 5). The inclusion of these countries in column 1 appears to drive the significant industrialization trend in the 2010s.\n\nColumn (4) reports results where the country sample is restricted, and in addition, the old 10SD levels are used. The coefficient of the 2010 decadal dummy for Sub-Saharan Africa now turns negative, as in Rodrik (2016). Indeed, the closer we move toward the data used by Rodrik (2016), the closer we get to reproduce his results. Once we also use the vintage of the control variables in Rodrik (2016), we find that the 2010s decadal dummy is − 0.018 and statistically significant at the 1% level (relative to the 1990s).\n\nFor Latin America, the inclusion of pre-1990 observations in column (2) reproduces the de-industrialization trend in Rodrik (2016). The sample of countries is comparable, the only difference being that Ecuador is included and Venezuela excluded from the ETD in comparison with the 10SD. Hence, the results in column (3) for the restricted country sample are comparable to the baseline in column (1). Using the 10SD levels in column (4), also only slightly alters the results. In line with the annual time trend reported in Fig. 3, de-industrialization appears as the typical pattern in Latin America.\n\nA comparison of the results for Asia is more difficult. This is because only a few (6 out of 14) developing Asian countries are in the 10SD used by Rodrik (2016). That is, long-run time series for many developing Asian countries in the ETD are not available, so the coefficient for developing Asia in column (2) is reported for completeness but difficult to interpret. It is only for these six developing Asian countries that we can extend the series backwards and do the analysis presented in column (2). This contrasts with the analysis for 14 countries included in column (1). Column (3) suggests that the results for developing Asia are also sensitive to country coverage, as the industrialization trend is insignificant in the smaller country set. The ETD includes several countries that have industrialized, such as Cambodia and Viet Nam, which appear to drive the significant industrialization trend shown in column (1). Finally, column (4) suggests that the use of 10SD levels is not driving the differences in results.\n\nRodrik (2016) showed that industrialization peaked at higher income levels in the pre-1990 period compared to the post-1990 period. We also explore shifts in the hump-shaped manufacturing curve here. Following Rodrik (2016), we run regressions similar to equation (1), which drop the decadal dummies and interact income and income-squared with post-1990, post-2000 or post-2010 dummies, respectively. Table 11 presents the results. Columns (1)–(3) report results using an extended dataset, namely (i) when observations before 1990 are included by extrapolating the ETD series backward using trends from the GGDC 10-sector database (10SD) and the Extended Africa Sector Database (EASD); and (ii) when advanced countries in the Rodrik (2016) sample are included by using employment data from EU KLEMS (van Ark and Jaeger 2017; Stehrer et al. 2019) and extrapolating backward using the 10SD. Column (4) reports regression results from using the ETD only. Results show significant interaction terms when 1990 is used as a breakpoint, consistent with Rodrik (2016). The magnitude and significance of the interaction terms weaken when we use 2000 in column (2) and in particular with 2010 as the breakpoint in columns (3) and (4)."
