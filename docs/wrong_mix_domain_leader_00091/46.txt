Willem Drees (5 July 1886 â€“ 14 May 1988) was a Dutch politician of the Labour Party (PvdA). He had a lengthy legislative career which culminated in his terms as Prime Minister of the Netherlands from 7 August 1948 until 22 December 1958.

After 1958, Drees retired from active politics, but remained a very active observer, publishing a substantial number of books and articles until the age of 97. He is praised by many as the most important Dutch politician after World War II for his important contributions and social reforms laws.

Willem Drees in The Hot War[]

Dutch Prime Minister Willem Drees and his Belgian counterpart Joseph Pholien were metaphorically screeching into President Truman's ears from either side, after America failed to prevent the Russians from destroying Antwerp, Belgium, with an atomic bomb in September 1951.[1]

While neither Prime Minister is named, they were in office at the Point of Divergence. World War III has progressed swiftly in a compact time frame, so it is likely they were still in office.
