Between 1940 and 1945 there were some 3,000 Dutch inmates interned at Buchenwald. Over 700 of them perished here, and hundreds more died in other concentration camps to which they had been deported.

Most were resistance fighters, whom the SS used for forced labour in the German weapons industry. There were also Dutch Jews deported to Buchenwald, but they were often sent on to other camps.

The Dutch were usually deported from police detention centres in Amersfoort, Schoorl, and Westerbork, which were under the administration of the commanding officer of the "Sicherheitspolizei" (security police). These centres were set up after the occupation of the Netherlands in 1940. The central administrative offices of the Sicherheitspolizei and its five branch offices employed some 700 people. These administrations organized the persecution of resistance groups, communists, and Jews.

A special group of Dutch inmates were the over 300 hostages held as leverage against the internment of Germans in the Dutch East Indies. Separated from the other inmates, they had their own accommodations (block 41). Among them was Willem Drees, at the time the chairman of the parliamentary group of the Social Democratic Workers' Party and later prime minister of the Netherlands. The hostages also included many members of the Dutch royal staff (private secretary, chamberlain, stable master).

At the end of the war, the Dutch inmates formed their own aid committee, which tried to support the other inmates. The Dutch were also active in the camp resistance efforts. One of the resistance members was the graphic designer Henri Pieck, who secretly made sketches of the horrifying situation in the camp.
