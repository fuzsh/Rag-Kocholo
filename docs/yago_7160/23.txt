Milena Dravic and Dragan Nikolic a movie connected them. They met on the set of Horoscope in 1969, and two years later, in the last days of December 1971, they got married during the filming of How Two Fools Loved.

"When I approached her, I had the impression that she was a girl from the area that I had known all my life. That's exactly its size. "He won me over with his immediacy and normalcy," said the late Dragan Nikolic.
