        "text": "The \"Topaz Driller\" platform is approaching Montenegrin territorial waters. We are waiting for it like the Cubans when in the fall of 1962 they were waiting for the ships of the USSR that were supposed to break through the American naval blockade of Cuba. So, he is full of apprehensions about what will come next. Environmental activists say: the flora and fauna of the Adriatic Sea will be destroyed, representatives of the Italian-Russian consortium \"Eni/Novatek\" who will carry out exploratory drilling and our Government say that everything is under control.\n\nI'm more inclined to believe the environmentalists.\n\nAnd I believe most in renewable energy sources. Bar and other towns on the coast have an average of more than 250 sunny days a year. They could supply the whole of Montenegro with solar energy. Like Morocco, which already draws 40 percent of its energy from sunlight.\n\n* * *\n\nI had intended to watch the last TV debate before the elections in Nikšić, but I gave up when I saw that only the presenter and the only participant wore a mask. I thought that this kind of arrogance, even some kind of arrogance, was a thing of the past...\n\n* * *\n\nThe prime minister, regardless of the fact that he is a learned man, cannot understand that he is the prime minister and that he is a public figure, the most public figure in this country. For now, he is absolved by one beautiful trait, unseen in Montenegrin politics - he knows how to apologize. In contrast, for example, to his predecessor, who never uttered that word, at least not on the domestic scene, ever since he said of the Italian mobsters that they were tourists who came on vacation to Montenegro, until when he did not stop heinous pursuit of a lady, but he \"came out\" or when, for example, he didn't tell the truth about his offshore company in Cyprus...\n\n* * *\n\nI was sorry that SDP is not in power. Because of the stability of the parliamentary majority and some balance that we need. I don't regret it anymore. It seems that SDP is where it belongs.\n\n* * *\n\nIt has always been a privilege to live in Bar. If only because of a walk by the sea, which in the age of corona is more healing than ever.\n\n\"Whoever was lucky enough to wake up in Bar this morning should not ask for anything more from life. More than that would be immodest.\"\n\nAnd from this quote, you can see that I never knew which was the starting point and which was the ending point of the most famous Yugoslav railroad...\n\n* * *\n\nI believe in the family and the institution called marriage. And I'm always saddened to hear that a marriage has ended in divorce. More and more people are getting divorced in these areas as well. They say that even the worst divorce is better than a bad marriage. Probably, but I also know that, in that case, the children are the biggest losers.\n\nAfter a long time, a married couple appeared who, in terms of acting skills, beauty and charisma, can stand alongside the famous married couples, whom we once admired, which consisted of Olivera and Rade Marković, and a slightly younger, Milena Dravić and Dragan Nikolic. They are Sloboda Mićalović and Vojin Ćetković. The first couple divorced, the second remained together until Prlet's death. I'm rooting for the third to resist all the temptations that await him in the time of evil and tabloids...\n\n* * *\n\nWhat do I remember from last year? Nothing. And from the previous one? A trip to America. Only travel stops time. That's why time under the corona passes quickly and without resistance. It rolls like a faceless mass and leaves devastation in its wake."
