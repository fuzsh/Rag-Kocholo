        "text": "Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic gave a warm welcome to the visiting Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Nikola Tesla Airport on Tuesday night local time.\n\nVucic, along with his wife Tamara Vucic, former Serbian President Tomislav Nikolic and his wife Dragica Nikolic, Serbian Parliament Speaker Ana Brnabic and Serbian Prime Minister Milos Vucevic, received Xi at the airport.\n\nXi is on a state visit to Serbia at the invitation of Vucic, and will then head for Hungary, the last stop of his six-day European tour.\n\nXi's visit to Serbia is his second visit to the country in eight years.\n\nSerbian president welcomes Xi at Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport\n\nChina's benchmark lending rate remains unchanged in August, the country's central bank announced on Tuesday.\n\nChina's one-year loan prime rate (LPR), a market-based benchmark lending rate, came in at 3.35 percent Tuesday, and the over-five-year LPR, on which many lenders base their mortgage rates, also remained unchanged from the previous reading of 3.85 percent, according to the National Interbank Funding Center.\n\nThe loan prime rate is calculated by the National Interbank Funding Center, based on quotes submitted by 20 commercial banks. The unchanged rate suggests confidence in market stability on the part of lenders.\n\nThe LPR underwent a major reform in 2019, aiming to enhance the role of the market in LPR quoting, improve the efficiency of interest rate transmission, and lower financing costs for the real economy.\n\nChina's loan prime rates remain unchanged in August"
