        "text": "The Capricious Girl, a comedy written by Kosta Trifković and directed by Nikola Zavišić, premiered on Tuesday, 14th May on the National Theatre’s Main Stage, two decades after it was produced the previous time.\n\nIn this well-known play from the nineteenth century, adapted in this version to be an intriguing and modern grotesque which does not adhere to customs and approach to this part of our drama heritage, Anastasia Anja Mandić interprets the leading role, Malčika, a girl ready to get married who cannot make her mind between several suitors.\n\n“We produced vaudeville, but a melancholic and dark one, about our character and abundant ‘choosing’ which lead us nowhere. The production is comical, but on a general level, it communicates metaphor, on behalf of all of us, and shows the extent of our lack of action in order to improve our lives. Although we find ourselves in the world of very comical characters, even caricatures, there is deep emptiness and sadness remaining after them, because they cannot make changes in their lives”, says Zavišić, who directed the play and was in charge of set design with Miraš Vuksanović and of lighting design with Miodrag Milivojevićem as well.\n\nSuna Kažić designed costumes, Sanja Lončar and Andrija Pavlović composed music and Damir Todorović designed stage movements.\n\nCreative Team:\n\nDirector: Nikola Zavišić\n\nDramaturge: Molina Udovički Fotez\n\nStage movements and creative consultant: Damir Todorović\n\nSet Designer: Miraš Vuksanović and Nikola Zavišić\n\nCostume Designer: Suna Kažić\n\nStage Speech Instructor: Ljiljana Mrkić Popović\n\nComposers: Sonja Lončar and Andrija Pavlović\n\nArt Director Of Video: Goran Balaban"
