They met on the set of Horoscope in 1969, and two years later, in the last days of December 1971, they got married during the filming of How Two Fools Loved.\n\n\"In Zvezdarska šuma, we filmed Dusko Radović's play - \"How Two Fools Loved Each Other\".

The meeting between Mayor Danela Arsovska and Prime Minister Hristijan Mickoski did not produce the desired results for the people of Skopje, and even after the meeting...\n\nInstead of JSP, Arsovska and VMRO-DPMNE will continue to \"drive\" the citizens Read More »"
