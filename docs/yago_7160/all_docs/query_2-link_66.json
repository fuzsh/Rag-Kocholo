        "text": "At the time of her death, Sophie was married to film producer Daniel Toscan du Plantier.\n\nWho is he? And how did they meet? Here's everything you know.\n\nWho is Daniel Toscan du Plantier?\n\nDaniel Toscan du Plantier was a French film producer.\n\nMore like this\n\nBetween 1975 and 1985, he was director-general of the Gaumont Film Company and from 1998, he was the president of Unifrance - an organisation for promoting French films.\n\nHis work includes the 1989 movie, The Cook, The Thief, His Wife And Her Lover.\n\nDaniel was 16 years Sophie's senior and while it's not public knowledge how the pair met, they both worked in French cinema.\n\nSpeaking of their relationship, Daniel previously said: \"We began to share a life and some years later, I married her.\"\n\nAfter Sophie's death, Daniel gave a heartfelt statement about his final moments with his wife, describing her as \"very dynamic\" and a \"young, impulsive woman\".\n\n\"In effect she was more than a tough character, with a strict moral code, who feared nothing,\" he said.\n\nSophie was Daniel's third wife after French actress Marie-Christine Barrault and Italian director and producer Francesca Comencini.\n\nDaniel remarried Melita Nikolic in 1998, and they had a son and daughter. He also has one son and one daughter with his first wife, and one son from his second marriage.\n\nIn 2001, Daniel died in Germany at the age of 61. His cause of death was given as a heart attack."
