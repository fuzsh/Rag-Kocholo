Evidence of infliction, by act or omission, of physical pain or suffering.\n\nP.1. Evidence of inflicting physical pain or suffering by acts of physical violence.\n\nP.1.1. Evidence of beating / hitting / kicking.\n\nA. Legal source/authority and evidence:\n\nProsecutor v. Enver Hadihasanović and Amir Kubura, Case No. IT-01-47-T, Judgement (TC), 15 March 2006, para. 1180 and 1279-1280:\n\n\"1180. All the Prosecution witnesses are consistent in stating that, throughout their detention in the Music School, they repeatedly underwent cruel treatment and lived in a permanent state of anxiety. Thus, upon their arrival at the School, the detainees were almost systematically kicked and beaten with rubber cable and wooden shovel handles by the soldiers and guards of the School before they were taken to the basement cell.2596 Witness XA recounts that upon his arrival he was hit on the head with a wooden stick when he was climbing the stairs and lost consciousness; when he came to, 15 to 20 7th Brigade soldiers were questioning him while continuing to hit him about the head, on the back and in the stomach, causing him to pass again out. He states that he was subjected to that treatment every day for eight days.2597 The beatings caused him to sustain two fractures of the skull.2598 Another witness recounts that after having lost and regained consciousness several times in the same circumstances, he was forced by a Muslim soldier to eat a military insignia after being threatened with having a rubber cable thrust down his throat if he did not do so.2599\"\n\n2596 P 398 (under seal), paras. 4-17; Kruno Rajić, T(F) p. 1797; P 401 (under seal), para. 10.\n\n2597 Witness XA, T(F) pp. 1430-1432 and 1434.\n\n2598 Witness XA, T(F) p. 1435.\n\n2599 P 398 (under seal), para. 13.\n\n\"1279. In view of the above evidence and in particular the testimony of persons who were detained at the former JNA Barracks in Travnik, the Chamber finds that cruel treatment was inflicted on civilians and prisoners of war held at the detention centre in the Barracks during the whole of the period at issue. It appears from the testimony, therefore, that detainees were beaten during the period material to the Indictment.2882 The detainees in question were beaten, sometimes for several hours, with various objects and kicked and punched.2883\n\n1280. The Chamber further finds that such beatings were carried out repeatedly. Witness Ivan Josipović was also beaten almost every evening during the first 50 days of his detention.2884 As for Kruno Bonić, it appears from the testimony that he was beaten on several occasions over a period of several months.2885\"\n\n2883 Ivan Josipović, T(F) pp. 2440-2441.\n\n2884 Ivan Josipović, T(F) pp. 2442-2443.\n\n2885 P 399 (under seal), para. 9; Ivan Josipović T(F) pp. 2450-2451.\n\nProsecutor v. Mile Mrkić et al., Case No. IT-95-13/1-T, Judgement (TC), 27 September 2007, para. 526-527:\n\n\"526. Turning next to the allegations of beatings in support of the charges of torture and cruel treatment, the Chamber refers to its earlier findings, that at the arrival of the prisoners of war at Ovćara, they were received by a large number of TO and paramilitary members of the Serb forces as well as some JNA troops. The buses were emptied one by one and the prisoners of war, apart from four, had to pass through a gauntlet of two rows of Serb soldiers, about 10 to 15 on each side, who were beating them severely as they passed through. The prisoners were beaten with a variety of implements including wooden sticks, rifle-butts, poles, chains and crutches. They were kicked and punched. One witness described the beatings in front of the hangar the following way:\n\nI don't know if the civilised world will be able to comprehend this. It is very difficult to describe this. You can't even see this in the movies, the beatings were terrible. People lost their teeth. There was so much blood, once we entered the hangar this straw was strewn on the floor and it was all covered in blood, it's hard to describe it. They were kicking, hitting, yelling, screaming[ ].\n\nIn effect, everyone but four, of the approximately 200 male prisoners from the five buses had to pass through the gauntlet and was heavily beaten. It is not clear from the evidence whether the two women were treated any differently. The soldiers were yelling \"Ustashas\" and were verbally abusing the prisoners going through the gauntlet.\n\n527. Further, as has been set out earlier in this Judgement, beatings by members of the Serb forces continued inside the hangar. The beatings were not isolated acts, they lasted for some hours during which the vast majority of the prisoners in the hangar was severely beaten. The Chamber refers to its earlier findings that many of the approximately 200 men from the Vukovar hospital were hit in many cases with implements such as iron rods and rifle-butts and kicked. Sinisa Glavasevic, Vlado (Vladimir) Dukic, Tomislav Baumgertner who was 16 or 17 at the time, Damir Kovaci, Damjan Samardzic and Kemal (]eman) Saiti are shown by the evidence to have been beaten particularly severely. According to one witness, 12 of the Serb soldiers descended on Sinisa Glavasevic and beat and kicked him badly. Damir Kovacic was kicked. Damjan Samardzic was punched and beaten by five or six soldiers so severely that for a long time he could not move. Kemal (]eman) Saiti was grabbed by the hair by a Serb paramilitary soldier and his head was violently banged several times against the concrete floor. These beatings were capable of inflicting serious pain and suffering and they indeed did so in many cases.\"\n\nProsecutor v. Idriz Balaj et al., Case No. IT-04-84-T, Judgement (TC), 3 April 2008, paras. 187-188:\n\n\"187. Based on the evidence, the Trial Chamber concludes that on 22 April 1998, Rosa Radoević, Novak Stijović, and Stania Radoević were stopped by armed KLA soldiers on the road in or near Poar/Pozhare. KLA soldiers subsequently took the three by car in the direction of Glođane/Gllogjan. At the entrance of Glođane/Gllogjan, Novak Stijović and Stania Radoević were kicked and beaten by a group of KLA soldiers with fists and rifle and pistol butts for a considerable amount of time. Novak Stijović fell to the ground and Stania Radoević was bleeding. The three were then taken inside a room in a nearby house and Stania Radoević was beaten and interrogated. Stania Radoević was sent out of the house on the condition that he would go to collect two guns. After some time Rosa Radoević and Novak Stijović were released. Stania Radoević retrieved one gun and then left for Dečani/De?an under the pretext of getting the other gun, but instead escaped and went to the local police station.\n\n188. The Trial Chamber is satisfied that the beating caused Novak Stijović and Stania Radoević serious physical suffering.[ ]\"\n\nProsecutor v. Dragan Nikolić, Case No. IT-94-2-A, Judgement (AC), 4 February 2005, para. 40:\n\n\"40. In light of the above, the Appeals Chamber considers that, while the Trial Chamber erroneously qualified the beatings underlying the crime of torture as having \"all of the making of de facto attempted murder\", it was reasonable to conclude, on the basis of the evidence before it, that \"due to (their( seriousness and particular viciousness\", the beatings underlying the crime of torture amounted to the \"highest level of torture\" as an aggravating factor. The relief sought by the Appellant was that the conclusion of the Trial Chamber at paragraph 213(v) \"should not have formed part of the aggravating factors and should be excised (and that( this excision goes to moderate the nature as a whole of the aggravating factors in the case.\"(89) Having determined that the Trial Chamber correctly concluded that the gravity of the beatings was to be taken into account as an aggravating factor in assessing the Appellants criminality for acts of torture, the Appeals Chamber does not consider that the excision of the Trial Chambers erroneous characterisation of the beatings as having all of the making of \"de facto attempted murder\" moderates the nature as a whole of the aggravating factors. Therefore, this part of the Appellants ground of appeal is dismissed.\"\n\n\"89. Appellant's Brief, para. 136.\"\n\nProsecutor v. Dragan Nikolić, Case No. IT-94-2-T, Judgement (TC), 18 December 2003, paras. 189, 192, 196, 200, 208, 213 (v):\n\n\"189. The Accused brutally and sadistically beat the detainees. He would kick and punch detainees and use weapons such as iron bars, axe handles, rifle butts, metal \"knuckles\", truncheons, rubber tubing with lead inside, lengths of wood and wooden bats to beat the detainees.261 The Accused even ignored his brother who would often plead with him to stop his criminal conduct by saying: \"Dont beat people, Dragan. They are to blame for nothing. Why are you doing this?\"262 The other detainees, including the children, observed the Accuseds criminal conduct and were afraid the same might happen to them.263\"\n\n\"261. Ibid. [Indictment], paras 8, 23, 27, 28, 31; Witness SU-202, T. 270.\n\n262. Witness SU-032, T. 283.\n\n263. Ibid., T. 278, 279.\"\n\n\"192. One of the most chilling aspects of the Accuseds behaviour was the enjoyment he derived from his acts. Witness SU-032 stated that the Accused \"enjoyed himself while he was beating people. I know firsthand that he enjoyed beating Arnaut Fikret. He used to beat him five times a day.\"266 When two of the victims passed out due to a beating, the Accused and other guards had buckets of water thrown on them to revive them.267 When detainees who were being beaten begged to be shot, the Accused would reply: \"A bullet is too expensive to be spent on a Muslim.\"268\"\n\n\"266. Witness SU-032, T. 279.\n\n267. Witness SU-202, T. 270. See infra para. 208.\n\n268. Witness SU-032, T. 279.\"\n\n\"196. On one occasion, Habiba Hadzic gave Fikret Arnaut276 some cookies because he had not been given any food. She did not see that Dragan Nikolic was at the door to the hangar. He walked up and crushed the biscuits with his boot, and he ordered her to go outside to the external toilet where he slapped her once then hit her with a rifle butt, knocking her out.277\"\n\n\"276. See supra subsection V. A. 2. (d) (i)\n\n277. Habiba Hadzic, T. 236-237; see supra para. 105.\"\n\n\"200. [ ] Many of the then detainees suffer to this day from the lasting not only physical effects of the treatment they received at the hands of the Accused or by his will. Witness SU-115 lost some of her teeth after having them kicked out at Susica and she \"still suffer[s] [the] consequences of the beating\"287 she received at the camp. Habiba Hadzic has constant pain in her elbow and is unable to take a bath without assistance due to a wound inflicted by the Accused with a rifle butt.288\"\n\n\"287. Exh. P1, Witness SU-115, para. 9.\n\n288. Habiba Hadzic, T. 239.\"\n\n\"208. The Trial Chamber is convinced that when detainees were beaten outside the hangar at the \"A-pole\" or when detainees were beaten or \"punished\" in the \"punishment corner\" of the hangar, all the detainees, from the very young to the elderly, knew what was happening, heard what was happening and were affected by it. Witness SU -202 testified how he was an eye witness to the beating and killing of Durmo Handzic and Asim Zildzic:\n\n\"296. Witness SU-202, T. 269-270.\"\n\n\"213. [ ] (v) Beatings were placed in the Indictment under the charge of torture. Due to the seriousness and particular viciousness of the beatings, the Trial Chamber considers this conduct as being at the highest level of torture, which has all of the making of de facto attempted murder.\"\n\nProsecutor v. Milan Simić, Case No. IT-95-9/2-T, Judgement (TC), 17 October 2002, para. 63:\n\n\"63. In relation to count 4, the Plea Agreement details the \"instruments\" used to beat the victims: the victims were beaten with fists, the leg of a chair, a rod or bar, the butt of a rifle, and were kicked, on various parts of their bodies and especially in the genitals. It further provides that the victims were forced to stand with their arms outstretched, and were ordered to stand with their legs apart in order to receive forceful kicks to their genitals.83\"\n\n\"83. Plea Agreement, para. 9(d).\"\n\nProsecutor v. Milorad Krnojelac, Case No. IT-97-25-T, Judgement (TC), 15 March 2002, paras. 231, 233, 240  242, 250, 255:\n\n\"231. Because of the significance of this event generally to other issues in the case, however, the Trial Chamber exceptionally records that it is satisfied that, on 8 July 1993, Ekrem Zekovic, a Muslim detainee, tried to escape from the KP Dom, but was re-captured the same day.624 As soon as he was brought back to the KP Dom, Zekovic was severely beaten by Milenko Burilo, a guard of the KP Dom.625 While he was being beaten, the Accused intervened to stop it.626 As they were walking away from the scene, Burilo continued to assault Zekovic in the presence of the Accused.627 The Accused denied that he saw Zekovic being beaten.628 The Trial Chamber does not accept the denial of the Accused on that point, nor does his evidence cause the Trial Chamber to have any reasonable doubt that the Zekovic was telling the truth. Zekovic was subsequently put in an isolation cell and then taken out at some point and beaten again with bare hands and with a chain by deputy warden Savo Todovic, in the presence of Boro Ivanovic.629 The Accused met with him and they had a conversation about his attempted escape.630 Zekovic was then returned to the cell and his hands and legs were tied to the floor with a metal ring. The next day, barely able to walk,631 he was taken to the courtyard where detainees had been assembled. He was then returned to the isolation cell where he spent 28 days. Seven days of that time were spent on the concrete cell floor, handcuffed at all times except for two occasions when he was taken out to be beaten again by the KP Dom guards on duty.632\n\n\"624.

The second time, he was taken away but not beaten (Ekrem Zekovic, T 3593-3594).\"\n\n\"233. The Trial Chamber is satisfied that, in the presence of the Accused,634 detainees were told by Todovic that, because of Zekovics escape, all food rations would be halved,635 and that work and medical treatment would be forbidden.636 This punishment actually lasted for at least ten days.637 All rooms were searched and medicines were seized. In addition, following the escape, several detainees, all work companions of Zekovic, were severely beaten by KP Dom guards as punishment for Zekovics escape or in order to obtain information about his whereabouts.638 The Accused denied having been aware of any punishment inflicted as a result of Zekovics escape.639 The Trial Chamber does not accept his evidence; nor did his evidence cause the Trial Chamber to have any reasonable doubt as to the truth of the Prosecution witnesses on this issue. FWS-73 was beaten and kicked with boots on the head and on his lower back so brutally that he continues to the present day to suffer from the consequences of his mistreatment.640 Furthermore, a group of detainees, including some of those who had been beaten, were locked in solitary confinement for varying periods of time.641 FWS-73 stayed in an isolation cell for 12 days.642\"\n\n\"634. See for example Ekrem Zekovic (T 3587-3588); FWS-250 (T 5066). The Accused himself conceded that he was present during Todovics speech (T 7684-7686).\n\n635. FWS-216 (T 3587).\n\n636.

The Trial Chamber is satisfied that, in June or July 1992,661 Nurko Nisic, Zulfo Veiz and Salem Bico were severely beaten by guards of the KP Dom, or by policemen from outside the KP Dom, who had been allowed by the guards to enter the KP Dom. Nisic was taken out to be beaten on at least two occasions while he was at the KP Dom.662 Several inmates saw the bruises on his face and body.663 Sometime in June or July 1992, he was taken from his room and his screams and the provocative remarks of those beating him were heard by other detainees.664 He was never seen again after that. The Trial Chamber is satisfied that, when beating him, the KP Dom guards or policemen from outside the KP Dom, intended to obtain from him a confession that he was somehow involved in military activities, or information to that effect.665 They may also have intended to punish him because they considered that his alleged military activities were somehow connected with the injury of a Serb soldier named or nicknamed \"Bota\".666 The Trial Chamber is not satisfied, however, that such an intention has been established beyond reasonable doubt. Nisic was beaten extremely severely.667 Despite his frailty due to mal-nourishment and mistreatment, he was given no medical assistance and he could not walk for several days following the beatings.668 The Trial Chamber is satisfied that the mental and physical pain inflicted upon Nisic by the guards of the KP Dom or policemen for the prohibited purpose which has been accepted amounted to torture within the meaning of Article 3 and Article 5(f) of the Statute.\"\n\n\"661.

See, however, the testimony of Risto Ivanovic who denied that Nurko Nisic was ever beaten while he was detained at the KP Dom (T 6175). This witness further claimed that nobody was ever beaten at the KP Dom and that no guard was ever involved in such mistreatment (T 6179). The Trial Chamber notes that Risto Ivanovic worked in shift at the KP Dom with two guards, Zoran Matovic and Milenko Burilo (T 6180); who have been mentioned repeatedly by Prosecution witnesses as being among the worst principal offenders of beatings (See par 273, infra concerning the finding of the Trial Chamber in respect of those two guards). The Trial Chamber does not accept the evidence of this witness on that point; nor does his evidence cause the Trial Chamber to have a reasonable doubt that the Prosecution witnesses were telling the truth.\n\n663.

The Trial Chamber is satisfied that, on an unknown date in the summer of 1992 but before the month of July, Salko Mandzo was mistaken for another detainee, interrogated and seriously beaten; he was hit with a bat, and cut on the face with a knife.680 Salko Mandzo lost consciousness as a result of a blow he received on his head. The fact that the KP Dom guards were mistaken about the identity of the victim does not detract from the conclusion that, when inflicting such severe physical pain, the guards did so with the intention of obtaining either a confession or information from him or the person they believed him to be.681 One Prosecution witness testified that Savo Todovic and the Accused walked in during the beating and said that they had been mistaken about the identity of the victim.682\"\n\n\"680.

[ ] In addition, on one particular occasion Hazim Delić and Esad Lando took him out of the Hangar and, while Delić walked over to his car parked around 10 metres away, Lando started kicking and hitting the victim with karate chops, which rendered him unconscious. [ ]\"\n\n\"972. Describing a later incident, the victim stated that Esad Landzo called him out of the Hangar, put a mask on his head to stop him from making noise and covered the front of the mask with a piece of white cloth to ensure that he could not see his tormentors. Mr. Landzo and several other persons then started beating him with a baseball bat The victim also testified that, on yet another occasion, Esad Landzo took him out of the Hangar, along with Branko Gotovac and his two sons, and beat them with a wooden plank, as well as placing a lit match underneath the victims thumb nail.\"\n\n\"994. Mirko Dordic testified before the Trial Chamber that, in the second part of June 1992, Esad Landzo, who was carrying a baseball bat at the time, took him out of Hangar 6 to another hangar. Mr. Landzo made him lean against a wall and asked him about the whereabouts of some hand grenades and pistols. When Mr. Dordic was unable to provide him with any information in respect of these items, Esad Landzo put a piece of metal in his mouth so that he could not make any noise and then started hitting him with the baseball bat on his legs and rib cage. This went on for a long time and Mr. Dordic fell down and fainted many times. When this occurred, Esad Landzo would make him stand once more and again start beating him. Ultimately, Mr. Landzo allowed Mr. Dordic to return to the Hangar. This beating was so severe that he could not get up unassisted and he remained immobile for quite some time. Subsequently, one of the other inmates of the Hangar told him that he had received about 200 to 250 blows.\"\n\nProsecutor v.

Thereafter, on the same evening, the Accused picked up Victim Z (Witness C) and took him to a forest in Gishyeshye Sector, where the Accused stepped on his face, causing his lips to bleed, and kept his foot on Victim Z's face while the Interahamwe Francois and the commune police officer Mugenzi beat him with the butt of their guns. Victim Z was tied to Victim Y with a piece of cloth by Mugenzi, which was used to choke him. Victim Z was also forced by Francois to beat Victim Y with a cudgel he was given. During this time, Victim Z was interrogated, but it is unclear who actually did the interrogation.\n\n412. Following the interrogation of Victim Y and Victim Z, the Accused picked up Victim V at a roadblock and took him, with Victim Y and Victim Z, to his house, which was searched by Interahamwe at the direction of the Accused. The Accused then told Victim V to raise his arms in the air and threatened to shoot him. In the presence of the Accused, Victim V was then beaten under interrogation by the Interahamwe Francois and the commune police officer Mugenzi with the butt of a rifle and a stick. Victim Z was beaten on the back with the blunt side of a machete.\n\n413. As a result of the beatings, Victim Y has trouble walking. Victim Z has scars on his back and continuing health problems. Victim V sustained a broken rib from the beatings.\"\n\n\"680. The Tribunal notes that the Accused himself participated in the beating of Victim Y by hitting her on the back with a club, and the beating of Victim Z by stepping on his face and holding his foot there while others beat him. It is alleged that he interrogated them but it is not specifically alleged in Paragraphs 21 and 23 of the Indictment that the Accused committed acts of physical violence. The Tribunal finds, however, that the allegations in the Indictment were sufficient notice to the Accused of the incidents in question, and that the exact role of the Accused in these incidents was a matter which was adjudicated at trial in accordance with the requirements of due process. For these reasons, the Tribunal finds that the Accused may be judged criminally responsible for his direct participation in these beatings, despite the absence of a specific allegation of direct participation by the Accused in the relevant paragraphs of the Indictment.\"\n\nSelmouni v.

Mr Selmouni was first questioned from 12.40 a.m. to 1.30 a.m. on 26 November 1991 by the police officers against whom he later made a complaint. Having been questioned and taken back to the court cells, Mr Selmouni had a dizzy spell. The court cell officers took him to the casualty department at Jean Verdier Hospital in Bondy at 3.15 a.m. The medical observations made by the casualty department read as follows:\n\n12. On 26 November 1991 the investigating judge extended police custody by forty-eight hours. Mr Selmouni was questioned from 4.40 p.m. to 5.10 p.m., at 7 p.m., from 8 p.m. to 8.15 p.m. and from 10.25 p.m. to 11.30 p.m. On the same day Mr Selmouni was examined by a Dr Aoustin, who made the following observations:\n\n13. On 27 November 1991 Mr Selmouni was questioned from 11 a.m. to 11.40 a.m. On examining him again, Dr Aoustin made the following notes:\n\n14. After being questioned from 9.30 a.m. to 10.15 a.m. on 28 November 1991, Mr Selmouni was again examined by Dr Aoustin, who noted on his medical certificate:\n\n15. At 11.30 a.m. on 29 November 1991 the applicant was examined by Dr Edery, a general practitioner. He drew up a certificate, at Mr Selmounis request, to the effect that Mr Selmouni claimed to have been assaulted. The certificate stated:\n\n17. On 2 December 1991 the applicant was examined by Dr Nicot from the medical department of Fleury-Mérogis Prison. In a medical certificate drawn up at Mr Selmounis request the doctor made the following observations:\n\n18. On 7 December 1991 Dr Garnier, the expert appointed by the investigating judge, examined the applicant at the prison. Mr Selmouni made the following statement to the doctor:\n\n19. The doctor noted in his report:\n\n20. The conclusion of the report is as follows:\n\n\"98. The Court finds that all the injuries recorded in the various medical certificates (see paragraphs 11-15 and 17-20 above) and the applicants statements regarding the ill-treatment to which he had been subjected while in police custody (see paragraphs 18 and 24 above) establish the existence of physical and  undoubtedly (notwithstanding the regrettable failure to order a psychological report on Mr Selmouni after the events complained of)  mental pain or suffering.\"\n\n\"102. The Court is satisfied that a large number of blows were inflicted on Mr Selmouni. Whatever a persons state of health, it can be presumed that such intensity of blows will cause substantial pain. Moreover, a blow does not automatically leave a visible mark on the body. However, it can be seen from Dr Garniers medical report of 7 December 1991 (see paragraphs 18-20 above) that the marks of the violence Mr Selmouni had endured covered almost all of his body.\"\n\nAydin v.

According to the applicant, she was later brought back to the room where she had been raped. She was beaten for about an hour by several persons who warned her not to report on what they had done to her.\"\n\n\"84. The applicant was also subjected to a series of particularly terrifying and humiliating experiences while in custody at the hands of the security forces at Derik gendarmerie headquarters having regard to her sex and youth and the circumstances under which she was held. She was detained over a period of three days during which she must have been in a constant state of physical pain and mental anguish brought on by the beatings administered to her during questioning and by the apprehension of what would happen to her next.\"\n\nMuteba v. Zaire, Communication No. 124/1982, Decision (Human Rights Committee), 29 April 1997, UN Doc. CCPR/C/22/D/124/1982, para.10.2:\n\n\"[ ] During the first nine days of detention he was interrogated and subjected to various forms of torture including beatings, electric shocks and mock executions. [ ]\"\n\n[B. Evidentiary comment:]\n\nP.1.2. Evidence of falanga.\n\nA. Legal source/authority and evidence:\n\nThe Greek Case, ECommHR Report, 1969, ECHR Ybk. 12, 499  500:\n\n\"5. In this connection the Commission finds two features common to many of the accounts of torture or ill-treatment: the use of falanga, and, in particular, its use in the washroom and the terrazza in Bouboulinas Street. Not all accounts of the washroom and the terrazza mention the same features, and there are sometimes errors. Thus some describe the small wall outside the washroom; the boiler, the sink with the metal id, and the back door in the washroom; and the notice on the stairs leading to the \"terrazza\": others do not mention them or say they did not notice them. In two cases, the number of rooms and doors in the building on the \"terrazza\" is wrongly described4.\n\n4. Tsirka and Korovessis; it should be noted that both were allegedly taken up at night-time. Vlassis, who gave evidence on the same day as Korovessis, but had been taken up in day-time, gave an accurate description.\n\n6. Falanga or bastinado has been a method of torture known for centuries. It is the beating of the feet with a wooden or metal stick or bar which, if skilfully done, breaks no bones, makes no skin lesions, and leaves no permanent and recognisable marks, but causes intense pain and swelling of the feet. The use of falanga has been described in a variety of situations: on a bench or chair or on a car seat; with or without shoes on. Sometimes water has been thrown over the feet and sometimes the victim has been made to run around between beatings. Victims have also been gagged.\n\n7. The Commission considers that the variety of situations in which falanga is described as being used, and the differences and errors of description of the washroom and \"terrazza\", far from putting in question the veracity and reality of the accounts, tend to confirm them. For it is natural that, where several witnesses describe the same place or incident, there will be variations and errors of detail: indeed it is the precise repetition of the same features which would be suspect and would point to fabrication.\n\n8. While falanga and severe beatings of all parts of the body are the commonest forms of torture or ill-treatment that appear in the evidence before the Sub-Commission, other forms have been described: for example, the application of electric shock, squeezing of the head in a vice, pulling out of hair from the head or pubic region, or kicking of the male genital organs, dripping water on the head, and intense noises to prevent sleep.\n\nFalanga has not only been the commonest form of torture or ill-treatment in the cases in which the Sub-Commission has been able to establish the facts to a substantial degree but also appears with great frequency in the further allegations raised in the proceedings with regards to other named detainees. The principal forms of alleged treatment  frequently several forms combined in one and the same case  are as follows in the two categories:\n\n5. This number includes 69 alleged cases  mostly mentioned in the list submitted by the witness Papagiannakis, Verbatim Record (Athens) IV, p. 1076, where torture has been alleged without further specification, it may therefore well include alleged cases of falanga.\n\n9. While it is an important feature of falanga that it generally leaves no enduring marks, beating of the feet may break bones, damage or destroy the nails, or cause skin lesions. The Sub-Commission was denied the opportunity of investigation cases where the breaking of bones6, and the destruction of nails7, were said to have taken place. There are witnesses who have specified to the Sub-Commission about the condition of the right ankle of Apostolos Dakos8.\"\n\n\"6. e.g. Margaritis, Reklitis; in theses cases the medical records were refused.\n\n7. e.g. Maria Kallerghi, Petropoulos, Kiaos; these persons were prevented from appearing before the Sub-Commission.\n\n8.

Mugenzi took her by the arm to the door and hit her on the head with the barrel of his rifle. Victim Y was then forcibly taken to the Accused, who ordered her to lie down. In the presence of the Accused, Victim Y was beaten by the communal police officer Mugenzi who stepped on her neck, pushed the butt of his rifle into her neck, and stomped on her At the mine, in the presence of the Accused[...] The others stomped on her as well.\"\n\n[B.

On one occasion, for instance, a military police officer ordered Franjo Rajić to hit his mentally handicapped son, Marko Rajić, and when Franjo Rajić refused to comply with the order, the police officer ordered another detainee to hit Franjo Rajić, which he did. However, because the military police officer considered that the blows were not hard enough, he began to hit a prisoner, who already had a broken arm, with a truncheon.2606\"\n\n2603 Kruno Rajić, T(F) p. 1800; P 401 (under seal), para. 15.\n\n2604 Kruno Rajić, T(F) p. 1800.\n\n2605 P 402 (under seal), para. 36.\n\n2606 Kruno Rajić, CFR pp.1805-1806.\n\n\"1502. Niko Petrović said that after the initial beatings a group of ten armed soldiers took the prisoners out of their cell and ordered them to beat one another. Petrović gave examples of how two brothers were ordered to slap each other in the face, and how he had to slap the person standing next to him. Since Petrović could not bring himself to do it, a member of the \"MOS\" hit him in the back with the butt of his rifle and ordered him to comply. The soldiers then ordered the prisoners to hit each other harder, this time in the stomach.3379 Niko Petrovićs testimony was corroborated by Marinko Marusić, who stated that he was the person Niko Petrović was ordered to beat during that incident. He added that they were ordered to beat one another on two separate occasions. First, they had to slap and punch one other, and each time the guards thought that the blows were not hard enough, they would beat the prisoners themselves.\"\n\nProsecutor v.

That being so, and contrary to what was said in paragraph 49 of the report, the measures in question were indeed forms of torture. The question of the threshold beyond which suffering could be considered severe had also been discussed in 1997, and in the view of many medical experts of the highest level of competence that threshold had been passed in all the cases in question.

The Chamber notes that in the English transcript, the Prosecutor refers to the Accused \"cutting off\" Rusanganwas limbs. According to that transcript, the witness used \"to cut off\" after initially using the more general verb \"to cut\". In contrast, the French transcript generally uses the general verb \"couper\" and only once uses the more specific verb \"amputer\". In order to clarify any discrepancy, the Chamber has reviewed the audio recording of the proceedings. The recording clearly indicates that both the Kinyarwanda interpreter and the witness speaking in Kinyarwanda consistently used the infinitive verb \"gutema\", which is consistent with the general verb \"to cut\" in English or \"couper\" in French.\"\n\n[B.

In addition, many witnesses heard by the Chamber referred to the disastrous detention conditions between April and June 1993. Accordingly, several witnesses concur in describing, each in their own manner, the food distributed to the detainees as consisting mainly of small amounts of bread or rice, together with vegetable soup sometimes. Some witnesses stated that detainees did not receive anything to eat for the first two days. The lack of sufficient and proper food weakened the detainees considerably: Kruno Rajić stated that he lost about 30 kilos during his detention, while another detainee stated that he lost 22 kilos.\"\n\n\"1681. Regarding the prevailing detention conditions at the School, all of the former detainees there who appeared before the Chamber complained of the shortage and poor quality of the food. According to two witnesses, on the first day or two in custody, the prisoners were denied food. Later, the approximately 250 to 280 detainees had to share a large pot of soup and a few loaves of bread.

But torture was not authorized even in emergency situations; Mr. Ghanimat had been permitted to sleep for about one hour in 24 over the course of 4 days, which from a medical point of view constituted torture. In another case brought before the High Court (HCJ 2210/96), the detainee had been kept awake for 39 hours followed by 5 hours' rest, then for 47 hours with 2 hours' rest, and then for 22 hours with 5 hours' rest, 47 hours with 5 hours' rest, 46 hours with 5 hours' rest, and finally 48 hours with 6 hours' rest.

The Chamber turns next to the allegations of deprivation of medical care which also support the charges of cruel treatment and torture in the Indictment. The evidence indicates that many of the prisoners taken from the hospital on 20 November 1991 had injuries for which they were being treated in the hospital or otherwise were injured before their death.1876 As has been noted elsewhere in this Judgement no medical care of any kind was provided to any of the prisoners, whether at the JNA barracks, or later at Ovcara.1877 In the circumstances of the present case, however, the Chamber is not persuaded that the acts of deprivation of medical care of those who had been previously injured, in and of themselves, were of the nature to cause severe or serious pain or suffering to amount to torture or cruel treatment. The Chamber would observe that the more seriously injured patients at Vukovar hospital were not included in this group of prisoners and that, both at the JNA barracks and at Ovcara, they were not held for any extended time. Further, in the Chambers view, while many prisoners received serious injuries at Ov~ara, in such cases the infliction of injuries and the failure to provide treatment for the injuries caused, is in reality the same behaviour. The deprivation of medical care in such cases is subsumed in the acts of mistreatment themselves.\"\n\nProsecutor v.

However, the Court deems it necessary to make one stipulation on the value of this testimony. The Commission argues that Mr. Suárez-Rosero was held incommunicado by the State from June 23 to July 28, 1992. If this were proven, it would necessarily imply that only Mr. Suárez-Rosero and the State would be aware of the treatment the former received during that period. Consequently, they would be the only ones entitled to present evidence on those conditions in the proceeding. In that regard, the Court has already established that\n\nIn accordance with this principle, since it has been proven (infra, para. 34(d)) that Mr. Suárez-Rosero was held incommunicado during the period indicated by the Commission, his testimony on the conditions of his incommunicado detention acquires a highly presumptive value, especially when one considers that the State declared that it \"could not confirm or guarantee anything\" relating to the treatment meted out to Mr. Suárez-Rosero during the time he was held incommunicado.\"[1]\n\nJohn Wight v.

Therefore, some of the victims were not found to have had their Article 5 rights violated despite the incommunicado nature of their detention. This is specifically confusing in light of the Courts emphasis on this type of isolation in the Surez Rosero and Loayza Tamayo cases which both concerned incommunicado detentions.\"\n\n\"25.

The Appeals Chamber is satisfied that the Trial Chambers analysis in this case was appropriate. In particular, the Appeals Chamber agrees that telling prisoners falsely that they will be executed, in a \"brutal context\" that makes the statement believable, can amount to wilfully causing great suffering. In addition, severe physical abuse in the course of interrogation, as was inflicted on Witnesses B, FF and AA, also generally amounts to wilfully causing great suffering, particularly when combined with acts designed to cause psychological torment, such as falsely informing a prisoner that his father had been killed or firing guns at prisoners so as to create an atmosphere of terror.\"\n\nProsecutor v.

The detainees were also subjected to serious attacks on human dignity. The prohibited treatment included beatings, the manner in which the detainees were physically restrained, and the display of the freshly severed heads of Momir Mitrovic and Predrag Knezevic. The 12 VRS detainees were taking no active part in hostilities at the time when the crime occurred.

As a preliminary point, the Trial Chamber considers that the two survivors of the Drina river incident, VG014 and VG032, were taking no active part in hostilities at the time of the incident. The evidence shows that both of them feared for their lives when Milan Lukic ordered them and the other detained men to move towards and line up along the Drina river. Milan Lukic had issued several threats that the men would be killed should they try to escape. Both witnesses testified to feeling that all hope was lost. In the Trial Chambers opinion, a reasonable inference from the extraordinarily fearful and stressful circumstances in which they were placed is that they endured mental suffering of sufficient gravity to meet the requirements of both Article 3 and Article 5(i) of the Statute.\"\n\nProsecutor v.

With regard to the search for Alexia, wife of Ntereye, the Chamber finds that at on the evening of 20 April 1994, the Accused went with two Interahamwe named Francois and Singuranayo and one communal police officer named Mugenzi to the house of Victim Y (Witness N), a [68] year old woman at the time She was then taken to Buguli, where the Accused made her lie down in front of the vehicle and threatened to run her over. At the mine, in the presence of the Accused, she was also threatened and interrogated by Mugenzi, who bound her arms and legs and stomped on her with his foot. The others stomped on her as well.\n\n410. Later that night, the Accused picked up Tabita (Victim W) and interrogated her also about the whereabouts of Alexia, the wife of Ntereye. She was then taken in the vehicle back to the mine. She was asked to get in front of the vehicle, and the Accused threatened to run her over and again interrogated her about the whereabouts of Alexia.\"\n\n\"412. Following the interrogation of Victim Y and Victim Z, the Accused picked up Victim V at a roadblock and took him, with Victim Y and Victim Z, to his house, which was searched by Interahamwe at the direction of the Accused. The Accused then told Victim V to raise his arms in the air and threatened to shoot him.\"\n\n\"678. The Tribunal notes that paragraph 16 of the Indictment alleges that the Accused threatened to kill the husband and child of Victim U. The factual finding of the Tribunal is that the Accused threatened to kill Victim U, not her husband and child. The Tribunal considers that the allegations set forth in the Indictment sufficiently informed the Accused, in accordance with the requirements of due process, of the charge against him. The material allegation is that he threatened Victim U. Whether the threat was against her life or the life of her immediate family is not legally significant in the Tribunal's view.\"\n\n[B.

The Trial Chamber is satisfied that Milan Lukics acts of robbing VG013, VG018, VG038, VG078, VG084, VG101 and Hasib Kurspahic of their valuables at gunpoint in Jusuf Memics house, and of placing VG013, VG018, VG038, VG084 and Hasib Kurspahic in Adem Omeragics house and setting the house on fire are of a gravity similar to the other offences listed under Articles 3 and 5 of the Statute. The Trial Chamber is also satisfied that Milan Lukics acts of shooting at the windows of Adem Omeragics house as VG013 and VG038 escaped through them, and of wounding VG013 in the process, are of a gravity similar to the other offences listed in these artickles\"\n\n\"975.

This was especially true for female detainees. Like all other detainees, they had to relieve themselves in front of all the others in the hangar in buckets placed near the hangar door.274 For example, Habiba Hadzic, was ordered by the Accused to wash and put cream on his feet for his personal refreshment.275\"\n\n\"274.

The parties do not contest that detainees in the three camps were subjected to torture as defined in the Tribunal jurisprudence. The Trial Chamber finds that many of the acts of beating or interrogating detainees and acts of humiliation and psychological abuses, as described in Part II of this Judgement, were committed with a specific intent to punish detainees suspected of participating in armed rebellion against Bosnian Serb forces and other acts were committed to obtain information or a confession. Virtually all acts of intentionally inflicting physical and mental violence were committed with an intent to intimidate, humiliate, and discriminate against non-Serb detainees.\n\n158. The Trial Chamber is satisfied that torture falling within the meaning of Articles 3 and 5 (torture and persecution) of the Statute was committed in the camp. Whether responsibility for torture can be imputed to each accused is a separate issue to be subsequently addressed.\"\n\n[B. Evidentiary comment:]\n\nP.9.1.

Not one single day and night at the camp passed by without Dragan Nikolic and other co-perpetrators committing barbarous acts.258 He played with the emotions of the inmates and tortured them with his words.

Next, as far as the first group of prisoners is concerned, the Chamber is convinced, on the basis of the depositions of Witnesses Z12 and Z13, that on several occasions the mujahedin threatened Witnesses Z12, Z13 and Zvonko Kukrić with physical injury and kicked them. The Chamber is also convinced that the mujahedin humiliated the detainees, whether by forcing them to tread on a rosary or by ordering Witness Z13 to simulate fellatio on Zvonko Kukrić without the latter exposing his genitals. Although that treatment was without any doubt dishonouring and painful, the Chamber is not convinced that the abuse was sufficiently serious to constitute cruel treatment within the meaning of Article 3 of the Statute.\"\n\nSelmouni v.

Damage to physical or mental health will be taken into account in assessing the gravity of the harm inflicted. The Trial Chamber notes that abuse amounting to torture need not necessarily involve physical injury, as mental harm is a prevalent form of inflicting torture. For instance, the mental suffering caused to an individual who is forced to watch severe mistreatment inflicted on a relative would rise to the level of gravity required under the crime of torture. Similarly, the Furundzija Trial Chamber found that being forced to watch serious sexual attacks inflicted on a female acquaintance was torture for the forced observer.309 [ ]\"\n\n\"309.

Noting, in particular, the extreme level of fear occasioned by the circumstances surrounding the event and the nature of the rape of Victim A, the Chamber finds that the perpetrator inflicted severe mental suffering sufficient to form the material element of torture. It is therefore unnecessary to determine whether this rape also inflicted severe physical pain or suffering, for which the Prosecutor only adduced evidence of the fact that non-consensual intercourse occurred.\"\n\nP.11.

Turning next to the conditions of detention at Ovcara, the Chamber observes that the prisoners from the hospital were kept under armed guard in the hangar at Ovcara from their arrival at between approximately 1330 and 1430 hours until late evening, some may even have still been alive and in the hangar until after midnight. Inside the hangar there were at least 200 prisoners from the hospital. Many were forced to lean against the wall with their arms held up and their legs spread. There was nothing in the hangar, only some hay at one end. The floor was concrete. The detainees were terribly frightened. It was apparent that something bad awaited them.The atmosphere was miserable.1863 Screams, moans, sobs, and cries for help were to be heard. A JNA officer who arrived at the hangar in the afternoon of 20 November 1991 described what he saw inside the hangar as \"mayhem.\" These conditions were such as to cause serious mental or physical suffering and they indeed did so.\"\n\nP.12.

He personally removed and returned women of all ages from the hangar, handing them over to men whom he knew would sexually abuse or rape them.271 Witness SU-032 believes had they resisted, they would have been liquidated.272 Witness SU-032 would have to agonize throughout the day, knowing what was to be her fate in the coming night.273\"\n\n\"271. Witness SU-032, T. 279-280: \"Dragan Nikolic took girls and women out of the hangar. In the evening, he would take girls out, and they would return in the morning, dishevelled, sad. They were not allowed to speak to the rest of us.[ ] But eventually each of them would confide in her sister or mother and tell them what had happened to them the previous night.[ ] You can imagine what happened to them. They were removed against their own will, and they were unable to resist. They could not defend themselves, and they had to do what they were told and ordered to do. They were forced to  and I dont know how to put it  to have intercourse with strangers or sometimes men they even knew. They had to do every single thing they were told to do\"; Witness SU-202, T. 273\n\n272. Witness SU-032, T. 280-281.\n\n273. Ibid., T. 281.\"\n\nProsecutor v. Dragoljub Kunarac et al., Cases No. IT-96-23-A and IT-96-23/1-A, Judgement (AC), 12 June 2002, paras. 139, 151, 185:\n\n\"139. The Respondent claims that the pain and suffering inflicted on FWS-50 through the Appellant Vukovics sexual acts was established. She asserts that, after leaving Foca, FWS-50 went to a physician who noted physiological and psychological symptoms resulting from rape, that she felt the need to go to a psychiatrist, and that she testified to having experienced suffering and pain when orally raped by Vukovic in Buk Bijela.\"\n\n\"151. Severe pain or suffering, as required by the definition of the crime of torture, can thus be said to be established once rape has been proved, since the act of rape necessarily implies such pain or suffering. The Appeals Chamber thus holds that the severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, of the victims cannot be challenged and that the Trial Chamber reasonably concluded that the pain or suffering was sufficient to characterise the acts of the Appellants as acts of torture.\"\n\n\"185. [ ] The physical pain, fear, anguish, uncertainty and humiliation to which the Appellants repeatedly subjected their victims elevate their acts to those of torture. These were not isolated instances. Rather, the deliberate and co-ordinated commission of rapes was carried out with breathtaking impunity over a long period of time. Nor did the age of the victims provide any protection from such acts. (Indeed, the Trial Chamber considered the youth of several of the victims as aggravating factors.) Whether rousted from their unquiet rest to endure the grim nightly ritual of selection or passed around in a vicious parody of processing at headquarters, the victims endured repeated rapes, implicating not only the offence of rape but also that of torture under Article 5 of the Statute. In the egregious circumstances of this case, the Appeals Chamber finds that all the elements of rape and torture are met. [ ]\"\n\nProsecutor v. Anto Furundija, Case No. IT-95-17/1-T, Judgement (TC), 10 December 1998, paras. 87  88, 163, 266:\n\n\"87. The attacks then moved on to Witness A: Accused B had warned Dugi, another soldier, not to hit her as he had \"other methods\" for women,118 methods which he then put to use. Accused B hit Witness A119 and forced her to perform oral sex on him. He raped her vaginally and anally, and made her lick his penis clean.120 Witness D was forced to watch these assaults and he testified that the accused was one of the soldiers outside the room.121 It appears to the Trial Chamber that the accused would have had to be in the vicinity of the door in order for Witness D to have seen him amidst the group of soldiers. Witness A categorically stated, in response to cross- examination, that the accused was present in the room: \"Yes, he was in the room. He watched me and Witness D and Accused B. He was inside the room . and we were all together inside\"122 and said that \"Furundzija was the person who interrogated and confronted me\".123 In Prosecution Exhibit P3, she stated that the accused was there all the time, \"because he was the one who was confronting me with Witness D\".124 In 1995, she stated that the accused \"was in the pantry questioning us as we were being beaten. He was there as Accused B forced me to have oral and vaginal sex with him. He did nothing to stop the beatings or the rapes\".125 Witness D testified that when he was taken out of the pantry, he saw the accused outside the doorway.126\n\n\"118.

Witness A continued to be sexually assaulted by Accused B until she collapsed in a state of exhaustion. This is demonstrated by the testimony of Witness A, and also by the evidence of Witness D, who having been returned to the Bungalow, heard a woman screaming from the direction of the Holiday Cottage and the name of Furundzija being called out. Later, a man whom Witness A recognised as Dragan Botic eventually took her upstairs to another room in the cottage.\"\n\n\"163. [ ] International case law,185 and the reports of the United Nations Special Rapporteur186 evince a momentum towards addressing, through legal process, the use of rape in the course of detention and interrogation as a means of torture and, therefore, as a violation of international law. Rape is resorted to either by the interrogator himself or by other persons associated with the interrogation of a detainee, as a means of punishing, intimidating, coercing or humiliating the victim, or obtaining information, or a confession, from the victim or a third person. In human rights law, in such situations the rape may amount to torture, as demonstrated by the finding of the European Court of Human Rights in Aydin187 and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in Meijia.188\"\n\n\"185. See e.g. Aksoy v. Turkey, Judgment of 18 Dec. 1996, Eur. Ct. H.R., Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI; Aydin v. Turkey, Judgment of 25 Sept. 1997, Eur.

[ ] Ms. Cecez was interrogated by Mr. Delic, who asked her about the whereabouts of her husband and slapped her. She was then taken to a second room with three men, including Mr. Delic. Hazim Delic who was in uniform and carrying a stick, then ordered her to take her clothes off. He then partially undressed her, put her face down on the bed and penetrated her vagina with his penis. He subsequently turned her over on to her back, took off the remainder of her clothes and again penetrated her vagina with his penis. During this time, Mr. Dzajic was lying on another bed in the same room and the other man present was standing guard at the door of the room. Mr. Delic told her that the reason she was there was her husband, and that she would not be there if he was. Later that evening Zdravko Mucić came to the room where she was being kept and asked about the whereabouts of her husband. He noticed her appearance and asked her whether anyone had touched her. She did not dare to say anything as Delic had instructed her not to do so. However Mr. Mucić \"could notice that I [Ms. Cecez] had been raped because there was a big trace of sperm left on the bed\". 903\n\n\"903. T. 496.\"\n\n938. The effect of this rape by Hazim Delic was expressed by Ms. Cecez, when she stated: \" he trampled on my pride and I will never be able to be the woman that I was\"904. Ms. Cecez lived in constant fear while she was in the prison-camp and was suicidal. Further, Ms. Cecez was subjected to multiple rapes on the third night of her detention in the prison-camp when she was transferred from Building B to a small room in Building A. After the third act of rape that evening she stated \"[i]t was difficult for me. I was a woman who only lived for one man and I was his all my life, and I think that I was just getting separated from my body at this time.\"905 In addition, she was subjected to a further rape in July 1992. As a result of her experiences in the prison-camp Ms. Cecez stated that \"[p]sychologically and physically I was completely worn out. They kill you psychologically.\" 906\"\n\n\"904. T. 494.\n\n905.
