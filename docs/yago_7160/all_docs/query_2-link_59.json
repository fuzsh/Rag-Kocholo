        "text": "The legendary actor Dragan Nikolic, he knew how to prepare only a few dishes, baked potatoes with bacon being his specialty.\n\nOur grandparents often ate this when they didn't have the means for anything else, and there was always potatoes and bacon, so in the past years this dish was a regular meal on Yugoslav country tables.\n\nThe famous actor usually prepared it in winter with beer, but in summer it is also a great meal that can be served for lunch or dinner.\n\nIngredients:\n\n- 3 potatoes\n\n– a little cream\n\n– 6 pieces of bacon\n\nPreparation:\n\nDo not peel the potatoes, just wash them well and cut them in half. Place them in a tray and bake at 200 degrees for about 15 minutes.\n\nThen take it out and put a piece of bacon over each potato, a little cream on top of each one and return to baking. If desired, you can also add ground red pepper.\n\nWhen it's done, add some more cream and serve with a cold beer."
