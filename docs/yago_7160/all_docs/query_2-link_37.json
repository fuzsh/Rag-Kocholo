        "text": "Steve's Priority Watchlist Project\n\nA Serbian comedy-drama to kick off the weekend. Maybe I should do this again!\n\nThe wonkiest road movie possibly ever made. A rickety old bus carries people and, later on, pigs, across a barely tracked countryside, encountering all manner of obstacles along the way. Some amusing, and some distinctly not - such as the approaching conflicts of the second World War.\n\nThis might be the weirdest takeaway from a film like this, but living in a city as I mostly have, I think I take for granted being able to get the bus. In countryside locations like this, there's one bus a day and it can take you absolutely miles. Not just 10 minutes down the road to Tesco and back. Reminds me of a time I went for a job interview in some village in Surrey, got the wrong bus afterwards, and it took me three and a half hours to get home.\n\nIt gives these people, all of whom are inevitably larger than life characters (always the whole point of a film like this) the chance to interact, conflict, flirt and charm. All the way a jobsworth bus conductor tells a married couple they can't get too handsy on his bus until he's seen their marriage certificates. It's frequently very funny, occasionally and unfortunately somewhat sexist, but also times its run for the more dramatic almost perfectly.\n\nIt means more when you've spent the time in the company of ordinary people trying to get back to their ordinary lives. I really need to watch a lot more eastern European cinema."
