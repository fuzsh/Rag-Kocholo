She never had minor or unimportant roles, and her talent always sought more. She was a star of Eu- ropean acting, as evidenced by the award for best actress she received at the Cannes Film Festival in 1980 for her role in Spe- cial Treatment, but also the best actress award she won at the Venice Film Festival for Jutro (she shared the award with Ljubi- Å¡a SamardÅ¾iÄ). Milena hung out with world stars like Milena DraviÄ has passed away in Belgrade just a week after turning 78. A light went out on the Serbian acting scene, and millions of admirers paid their respects to this actress who inscribed her name in the history of Yugoslav and Serbian film\n\nRobert de Niro, Ava Gardner, Clint East- wood and John Lennon. She dined often with Alfred Hitchcock, and she once gift- ed Liza Minnelli a pair of traditional Ser- bian opanka shoes. She refused an offer to pose for American Playboy, fearing the move would be too âfreeâ. Nevertheless, the meaning of her life was her love with actor Dragan NikoliÄ, who passed away in 2016. They met dur- ing shooting for the film Horoscope, they wed during a break in shooting for the film How Two Fools Loved Each Other, and they made the best TV show, Cheek to Cheek. Milena has now joined her dear Dragan and will be remembered eternally.\n\nMilena DraviÄ i Zoran RadmiloviÄ u TV seriji PriÄe iz NepriÄave Milena DraviÄ and Zoran RadmiloviÄ in the TV series âPriÄe iz NepriÄaveâ\n\n| 39"
