        "text": "He has been described as a tall slim figure with a nasal voice, a Serb in his mid-30's named Dragan Nikolic, and he appears to have displayed a singular brutality as the orchestrator of the proceedings at Susica, the Serbian concentration camp just outside this eastern Bosnian town.\n\nEach night throughout the summer of 1992, witnesses say, Mr. Nikolic would come into the barracks and point to men or read out a list of names. Shortly afterward, people inside the building would hear shooting. The men selected never returned. According to Pero Popovic, a former guard at the camp, they were generally lined up against an electricity pylon just outside the barracks and shot.\n\nZijad Zemic, who entered Susica on June 2 as one of the camp's first prisoners, said \"Nikolic and his cronies often seemed drunk. There was a deathly silence when they came in and we had to put our faces down. It did not seem like there was much of a system. They just came in drunk and pointed to people.\"\n\nSusica (pronounced sue-SEE-chah), where about 3,000 Muslims died and thousands more were imprisoned before exile, began its work in June 1992. Within a month, the pace of killing and expulsion of Muslims accelerated, and by the end of September, there were no Muslims left in Vlasenica and scant evidence of the savagery they had suffered.\n\nBut now, two years later, a Serbian guard at the camp and dozens of Muslim survivors have come forward to provide the first account of a camp's operation to be corroborated by both sides in the Bosnian war. Their convergent portrayals, conveyed in separate, independent interviews, establish Susica's function as the systematic elimination of Muslims from the area. Until now, full details of how such camps worked remained cloudy, their true nature repeatedly denied by the Serbs.\n\nMr. Popovic, the 36-year-old former guard, who deserted from the Bosnian Serb army in January 1993, made clear in three interviews with The New York Times that executions at the camp were a nightly occurrence and that a unit of the the Serbian-dominated Yugoslav Army opened the way for the \"cleansing\" of Vlasenica (pronounced vlah-seh-NEET-sah) by surrounding and disarming its Muslim population a few weeks before the camp opened.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
