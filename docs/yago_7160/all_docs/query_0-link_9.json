        "text": "\"Time flows, life passes, the years go by and here I am, I have been sitting for some time, resting. My Gaga has been gone for a year, and I have been sick for several months. I'm struggling. I look for an engagement, I do something, the phone rings often, I go out to meet people as much as I can ве I do the exercises I need with the therapist, I starve TV like never before, I only see my loved ones. \"It is important to work, work, work… Memories, memories…\", wrote the Yugoslav actress Milena Dravic a year after the death of her greatest love.\n\nDue to her professional reputation and great roles on the movie screen, Milena Dravic was extremely respected and appreciated all over the world, just like her greatest love, Dragan Nikolic - Gaga. No wonder they both lived for the film in the true sense of the word.\n\nThe charming actress and legend of the Yugoslav film was mostly talked about by her works, almost a hundred films in which she acted, which enabled her to be a star at foreign festivals, on whose red carpets walked only the brightest stars of the film.\n\nThe most beautiful actress of the former Yugoslavia, as she was often called, was friends with Alfred Hitchcock, Jack Nicholson, John Lennon, Yoko Ono and many others, and yet, all her acting achievements and impressive career path did not cause as much \"jealousy\" and wonder as her love with which she shared work, life and happiness for more than four decades.\n\nThey met in 1969 while filming the movie \"Horoscope\" by Bora Draskovic. By that time, Milena had already had two marriages behind her, with directors Puris Djordjevic and Vojislav Kokan Rakonjac, and was already a star in Yugoslavia.\n\nDragan Nikolic, on the other hand, was at the beginning of his career then.\n\nThey got married during the break of the filming of the play \"How two fools loved each other\" by Dusko Radovic.\n\n\"We filmed Dusko Radovic д's play\" How two fools loved each other \"in Zvezdarska Suma. When we finished at the registrar and became a married couple, we went to lunch. Then we went back to the Zvezdara Observatory and continued filming as if nothing had happened. \"We do not even have a photo from the wedding,\" Milena once said.\n\n\"I do not remember how I proposed to her anymore. \"It was probably something in two or three words, because I do not want him to talk too much,\" Dragan said in an interview, in which he answered the question why they did not have children:\n\n\"I think that not having children is a big disadvantage, not a flaw, but it is simply so. It gives us a chance to see all children as our own. We have our little granddaughter Iva. \"She made up for everything we did not have and our whole world revolves around her.\"\n\nAlthough Dragan, like Milena, often did not talk about their marriage, he made it clear that the struggle was what kept them together.\n\n\"There were a lot of things in the beginning. And love, and quarrels, and even more beautiful calming. But when people are public figures, then it has another dimension. Milena and I live fast and tumultuous, so I have no idea that so much time has passed and that we have been married for more than 40 years. Milena and I are the biggest and strongest critics of each other, both at work and in life. One must honestly say what one thinks and feels, because even a quarrel can bring something good. For a marriage that lasts four decades, there are more reasons to break up than to survive. But the easiest thing is to cut something, it is much harder to fight for the marriage to be preserved. \"Sometimes even a small quarrel can refresh the day,\" Dragan said.\n\nAnd in the illness that Dragan struggled with for two years, his Milena stood firmly by his side, because in the end, they only had each other. Four decades of love, understanding…\n\nAnd the movie? Just as they lived the film, they left everything to the film. All the property of Milena Dravic and Dragan Nikolic remained at the Cinematheque, the greatest love besides the one they felt for each other."
