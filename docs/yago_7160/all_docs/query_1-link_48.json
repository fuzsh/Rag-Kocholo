        "text": "Comedy and comic conventions offer the possibility for laughter as a therapeutic and liberating force, as well as provide reflections on the absurdity of the everyday through the use of humour and chaos. This paper examines how Balkan comedies during the state socialist period used traditional comic conventions to offer critiques of the political and social systems, through analysis of three films: Ciguli Miguli (Branko Marjanović, Yugoslavia, 1952, released in 1977), Koncert në vitin 1936 (Concert in 1936, Saimir Kumbaro, Albania, 1978), and Господин за един ден (King for a Day, Nikolay Volev, Bulgaria, 1983). Drawing on the stylistic and visual conventions of silent comedies, these films create a range of comic characters and situations: the misadventures of peasant Purko in King for a Day, the water fight between musicians in Ciguli Miguli, and the policeman’s mannerisms in Concert in 1936. Furthermore, some common characteristics inherent to the cinema of Balkan countries in this period will be identified, such as the struggle between the value system of tradition vs. modernity, civilisation vs. primitiveness, European-ness vs. Balkan-ness, suggesting that such Balkanist constructs which continue to feature in popular cinema in the recent period, did not disappear but were internalised by the communist ideologies.\n\nFollowing the demise of Yugoslavia and the subsequent wars and that followed in 1990s, Serbia was ostracized and unable to participate in the normalization process occurring in the region. Serbian cultural products responded to this dislocation and film was particularly useful in this expression as it provided a visual referent that could be consumed by large numbers of citizens. In these films, Serbian filmmakers continue a dialogue with the West that had effectively been silenced in other meaningful ways. In this article I analyze the films Wounds (Srdjan Dragojević, 1998), Bear Earth (Ljubiša Samardzić, 2003), One on One (Mladen Matičević, 2002), Absolute 100 (Srdan Golubović, 2001), and compare them to African- American films of the 1980s and 1990s Do the Right Thing (Spike Lee, 1989) He Got Game (Spike Lee, 1998) Straight out of Brooklyn (Mattie Rich, 1991) and Boyz in the Hood (John Singleton, 1991) as a source of origination. While superficially unlikely points for comparison, both African-American and Serbian films evoke the failure of democratic aspirations to include marginal groups. Simultaneously, their directors convey the need for said groups to reconfigure their hopes and identities from the dominant culture to their own paradigms and realities.\n\nRadical comedy liberates spectators from their compulsive attachments to volatile objects. In that spirit, modernist film theorists placed their hopes in the raucous, world-shattering laughter elicited by violent slapstick comedies to explode the crises of the present and their foothold in habituated perception. But what remains of laughter’s revolutionary modernist project in the twenty-first century? In this article, I rethink the concept of cine-genre to pursue tropes of uncanny, uncontrollable laughter that have proliferated across all genres of contemporary cinema. Conventional genre provides an aesthetic contract of solid expectations (brokered between audiences, media-makers, and producers) to sustain the hope for what’s possible through the repetition of what’s imaginable. But in times of escalating crisis, genre itself falls apart, spawning perverse hybrid mutations. Cinema, I argue, in its renewed capacity for dialectical ‘hybridity’ can give rise to radical forms of embodied perception and affective experience that slam the brakes on the nightmare of postmodern carnival and reveal new ways forward toward a less dystopian future.\n\nLiving in a social world, we experience feelings and react to others’ feelings as they appear to us. For instance, we have all smiled since we were babies. The first “genuine” social smile typically occurs sometime between weeks 6 and 8, as a response to recognizing someone very special: Mom or Dad (Kail, V., Robert & Cavanaugh, John C., 2019). We see, we are happy, we smile. We are born with the desire to be happy. Humankind has searched for different revelations of happiness, and this is how humour was born. From ancient times to the present day, humour has been an instrument of communication, a social behaviour that is an integral part of mass media and social interaction. Humour provides a reciprocal influence. It is a way to interpret information as well as a specific media that can be used to convey this information. What happens to the media once it is &quot;infected&quot; by humour? Does humour necessarily satisfy the need for entertainment? Can humour have a &quot;serious f...\n\nThis paper aims to investigate the body of Serbian horror film, which is slim in number of titles, but rich and diverse in their accomplishments. Looking at them from the standpoint of the body's role and presentation, new perspectives are opened for understanding the impressions of bleakness and doom which hang over most of these films. If body gothic may provide for temporary and imaginary escape or release from the constraints of embodiment via fantastic re-shapings, transformations or hybridisations, in Serbian horror films there is no transgression nor transformation – corporality seems inescapable while characters are constrained and doomed in vicious circles of repetition. More specifically: sexuality leads to damnation or is damnation itself in Djordje Kadijević's The She-Butterfly (Leptirica, 1973) and A Holy Place (Sveto mesto, 1990); there is no escape from the body and the autopsy, with which the film ends, reduces its protagonist to dead meat in GASP! aka The Backbone (Kičma, Vlatko Gilić, 1975); Variola Vera (Goran Marković, 1982) uses the smallpox disease as a metaphor for the unhealthy system of the socialist Yugoslavia and sees the virus as eternal, inescapable, constantly mutating; in The Life and Death of a Porno Gang (Život i smrt porno bande, Mladen Djordjević, 2009) there is no possibility for real, lasting emancipation: transgressive individualists' bodies are sold for fun and profit; finally, A Serbian Film (Srpski film, Srdjan Spasojević, 2010) presents its characters as literally and metaphorically raped from birth; it 1 Kontakt sa autorom: dejan@rue-morgue.com HUMANISTIKA · broj 1 · April 2017. godine"
