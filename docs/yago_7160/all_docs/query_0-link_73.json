        "text": "/\n\nDiplomirali ste na Äuvenoj akademiji Koefija u Ri- mu. Kako pamtite studentske dane? â Taj period je moÅ¾da i najviÅ¡e obeleÅ¾io ne samo mo- ju karijeru nego i Å¾ivot. Veoma mlad sam otiÅ¡ao u Itali- ju i tamo sam odrastao, stekao vaÅ¾na uverenja i estetske principe, pa moji roditelji znaju da u najpozitivnijem smi- slu kaÅ¾u da su me Latini pokvarili. Svaki povratak u Ita- liju je novo raÄanje jer se vraÄam prvoj Äeliji, od koje su nastale sve priÄe. A moj susret sa modom je bio poput velikog praska. Kao student odlazili ste u studije Diora i Valenti- na. Å ta ste tamo nauÄili? â To bi se danas zvalo vork Å¡opovi, a ranije se naziva- lo posete. U Dioru i Valentinu negovali su Äarobne zana- tlije, koje nisu sprovodile u delo samo neku ideju veÄ su od parÄeta tkanine i nekoliko zaÄinskih elemenata pra- vili nestvarne stvari koje su deo modne istorije. Ma koli- ko da se razlikujemo po trÅ¾iÅ¡tu i moguÄnostima, trudio sam se da ta iskustva prenesem u svoj atelje. Kako je izgledalo kreiranje prve kolekcije? â Prva ozbiljna priÄa desila se na Nedelji visoke mo- de u Rimu, davne 1992, kada je nas nekoliko studenata predstavljalo akademiju i svoje kolekcije. Inspiracija je bio Luj Äetrnaesti, kralj Sunce. Odjednom sam se suoÄio sa sudom javnosti, preÅ¡ao put od skice do revije i bio veo- ma zadovoljan jer sam neÅ¡to zavrÅ¡io. InaÄe, imam strah od nedovrÅ¡enog. SeÄam se i da je moj tata sedeo u smo- kingu u drugom redu i to je meni bilo veoma vaÅ¾no. Po- sle je sve iÅ¡lo svojim tokom. U aprilu ove godine predstavili ste se na 45. âPer- vol feÅ¡n vikuâ u Beogradu, i to modelom inspiri- sanim Milenom DraviÄ...\n\ngained important convictions and aesthetic principles, and my par- ents sometimes say in the most positive sense that theâLatinsâspoiled me. Every return to Italy is like being reborn, because I return to the rst cell from which all stories emerged. And my encounter with fash- ion was like a big bang. As a student, you went on placements at the studios of Dior and Valentino. What did you learn there? âThat would today be calledâworkshopsâ, while earlier it was called âvisitsâ. At Dior and Valentino they nurtured magical craftsmen who didnât only convert some idea into a creation, but rather used a piece of fabric and some spicy elements to create unbelievable things that have become part of fashion history. What was it like to create your rst collection? âThe rst serious story occurred at Haute Couture Week in Rome, way back in 1992, when a few of us students represented the acad- emy and our collections. The inspiration was Louis XIV, the Sun King. I suddenly found myself confronting the judgement of the public, passed the journey from sketches to show, and was very satised to have nished something. I generally have a fear of things being left unnished. I also remember that my dad sat in a tuxedo in the sec- ond row and that was very important to me. Afterwards, everything owed in its own way. This April saw you present yourself at the 45 th Pervol Fash- ion Week in Belgrade, and you did so with a model inspired by Milena DraviÄ... âDespite her acting prowess, she was alwaysâthat Milena DraviÄâ, and beside her was inevitably her husband Dragan NikoliÄ. When we received the theme, I decided that the model would be in the spirit of the showâCheek to cheekâ, which they presented together. Milena should be among the vanguard of our role models. I wouldnât want to sound sentimental, but she didnât only leave a great mark as an ac- tress, rather also as a person. The model that was worn on the catwalk by Olivera KovaÄeviÄ depicts a story about Milena. What secrets are hidden behind your other dresses? âEach dress has its own unique I.D. number. There are those that left the workshop without stress and appeared as though they de- manded a lot of time. There were also dresses that seemed to be made quickly, but behind which are days of work. Iâm really privileged to have my own people and together weâre some kind of strange fellowship. We understand each other on the y and resolve things quickly, even when we have to make a 154-piece topcoat. When we nished the job, I asked them where the pattern was for the coatâs cut, because we keep the patterns for all models. In unison they told me that theyâd thrown it away, so that it would never cross my mind for us to make something similar again [laughs].â How did you fall in love with fashion in the rst place? âI fell in love primarily with art, partly because of my family sur- roundings. My family wasnât vocationally orientated towards art, but in it there was always a need for that kind of spiritual nutrition. I rst graduated from graphic design school, and then headed in the direc- tion of fashion. It was a privilege for me to be able to study at one of the best fashion schools in the world and to experience fashion as a very inspirational and interesting eld. Iâve never been in love with fashion in the sense of manifestation. I fell in love with it as in artistic discipline.â You claim that women in Serbia have a gift for fashion, but al- so that there are men who follow fashion and depart from the expected. Arenât you in that group? âIâm a step away from wearing that uniform. During my studies, I liked to experiment, but I never wanted to go to any kind of extreme. And while I like to skip certain boundaries in my work, Iâve long since nailed down my style. Iâm a boring man in dark blue colours and my fa- vourite is always a shirt. My wife tells me she doesnât know how many of them I have, while my friends say they all look like one model.â\n\nNapravio je fascinantni mantil od Äak 154 dela He has made a fascinating 154-piece topcoat\n\n62 |"
