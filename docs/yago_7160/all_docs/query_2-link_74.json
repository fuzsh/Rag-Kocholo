        "text": "\"This is not a commemoration of the death of Dragan Nikolić. We invited his Milena to be with us tonight, she couldn't for health reasons, but she told us one detail. A few days before he went to his so-called death, Gaga told her: \"As soon as this is over, as soon as I get well, we're going to the sea.\" So this is Gaga's return to the sea. To stay with him, forever,\" said playwright Stevan Koprivica last night at a dinner dedicated to actor Dragan Nikolić.\n\nIt was a story about Dragan the actor, Lepa Gaga from Crveno Kst, Dragan from Rosa, with whom he went to Baošiće and Kostajnica, but his soul always remained at his captain's vantage point of the house in Rosa, a man who marked the Yugoslav cinematography, but also spartan with his Zodiac along and across Boka, thus becoming a permanent member of the bokonaut crew where only fanatics and lovers survive.\n\nDirector Branko Baletić, who worked with the great actor, spoke about the lesser-known quality of a man \"who made sure he didn't hurt anyone, who never raised his voice during the filming and who therefore had a calming effect on everyone who worked with him.\" \"Dragan Nikolić was a philosopher of nature, hence his great love for the sea, Rose and Ada, Sava,... Baletić asserted that Nikolić was a great worker and that the camera loved him.\n\nBaletić also spoke about how important the film \"Horoscope\" was for Nikolić, \"not only because it is a great achievement of a great theater and film director (Boro Drašković), but also because he met Milena Dravić during the filming of that movie.\" I think that they are the most important couple in Yugoslav culture, thanks to their attitudes, work, talent... Few people mention their true civic conviction\", said Baletic.\n\n\"Most people perceive Dragan Nikolić as an excellent film actor, somewhat forgetting how much he was an off-the-record and highly engaged theater drama actor,\" said the former director of the Tivat Cultural Center, Milena Radojević, and recalled the performances in which Dragan (Inominato) and his wife Milena Dravić (Bikeški D minor) acted, and Tivat Center produced. She remembers his enormous commitment to work and professionalism that served as an example to everyone, but also his nervousness before every performance, as an expression of his deep respect for the audience.\n\n\"I remember him as the most wonderful and noble theater partner and a perfect gentleman, an actor who treated everyone in the crew with respect,\" said actress Dubravka Drakić emotionally, talking about working together on the play Inominato. He was always full of respect and full of love for all the vulnerabilities of young novice actors, said Drakić.\n\nDuring the evening, selected inserts were shown from films in which Gaga performed unforgettable roles (When I'm Dead and White, Horoscope, National Class, Banović Strahinja... and theater plays Inominato.\n\nFor actors like Dragan Nikolić, there is no death, but a so-called death, because what he did in the theater, in the film and our friendships with him, are a pledge that he will stay with us\", said Koprivica."
