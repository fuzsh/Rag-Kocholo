        "text": "Three stories are set at the beginning, middle and the end of WW2. In all three of them the hero of the movie must witness the death of people he likes.\n\nSmall village in mountains of Dalmatinska Zagora is under total control of Andrija, local Party official. One day two members of secret police come to the village and everybody knows they are going to arrest somebody, but nobody knows whom.\n\nFollows Stevan Nikolic, \"Stiv\", petty criminal born in Belgrade, always problematic, enemy of country's regime, influenced by society and movies(for example Godard's, even the movie looks like \"Breathless\" a little bit and Godard is mentioned once in the movie) and his rise to power along with drugs, sex and with the help of local police.\n\nThe war has ended leaving a deep trace in people. Going through a different conflicts in the first days of peace - dealing with a former enemy's collaborators and executing traitors - a former soldier continues with killing even in peace. So, the war goes on, a struggle within himself and with the people around him.\n\nA love romance between older, respectable engineer that came in the industrial town to do some expert job and young hairdresser in whose house he stayed in and the consequences of that relationship, especially after young driver gets involved.\n\nThe winds of war has passed and left a permanent deformation of the human psyche. Two brothers returned after the liberation of their village who that is the whole burnt and deserted. They confessed to each other that the war, as trophies, bring tasers ammunition. In all this madness begins the game with a shooting that much love. They are joined by a German who is hiding behind the rocks after the destruction of the village. And in this insane game killed all three.\n\nOne night, after disastrous road accident, the eyewitnesses were claiming that they saw a woman behind the steering wheel. It was actually the four teenagers who have stolen Peugeot 404 to drive around for fun, but the girl who was with them left the car in the middle of highway. The boys have been chased by the police and they've crashed fatally. The police continues their intense search to find the fourth person.\n\nTom is a young guy from Zagreb, completely without money, trying to make films in Belgrade. He somehow manages to survive with a help of women. He doesn't believe in anybody, respects no one and is in constant conflict with the ruling system and order. After being left by a silly American girl, Tom binds with a woman whose husband is abroad. When she kicks him out, he moves in with her husband's sister, who later kills him in the attack of jealousy. All this is shown in the context of major historical events prior to 1968. with lots of archive footages of world leaders.\n\nIn a Serbian village on Christmas Day in 1943, the Chetniks accept two downed American pilots and give them hospitality. However, finding out that the Germans are looking for pilots, the Chetniks change attitude towards them, disarming and shutting them off, but the pilots were able to escape. Palming off the corpses of two other killed prisoners to the Germans, who have since captured the real pilots, the Chetniks make local people enraged, despite their captain's attempts to cover up this wrongdoing, done on a public holiday.\n\nThe story about Jimmy the Dingy, a young vagabond who works as a seasonal worker. Having been sacked from the job, his dreams are to become a singer. As most of the things in the Balkans happen, he is destined to failure.\n\nIdealistic young man supports the party and the new Yugoslavia's communist regime, but soon gets involved in various political and criminal machinations becoming more and more confused about what's right and what's wrong.\n\nA lonely man struggles to find the money for his ill sister's treatment while at the same time trying to escape his past and to make sense of the present.\n\nAn ex-soldier named Slobodan Antic, referred to by a friend as one of the last idealists, finds himself losing control over his own life when a man identical to him starts following him around, claiming to be a friend but behaving suspiciously. Before long his dealings with this doppelganger begin to cost him and his professional and romantic life grow more and more confused.\n\nAn ex-partisan and current political activist sets out to Styria region in Slovenia to buy out the wheat from peasants and convince them to form the farming collective. His ostensible success (based on blackmailing rather than convincing), as well as his love defeat, make him disturbed and he kills an innocent man while performing a social mission."
