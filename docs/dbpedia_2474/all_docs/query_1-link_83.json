        "text": "Rising Michigan rock band, Greta Van Fleet, continue to break Canadian radio records with their second single “Safari Song” which debuted at #18 on the active rock charts and hit #1 in just one month, maintaining the top spot for eight consecutive weeks and counting. This follows the success of band’s debut single “Highway Tune”, which set the record for most weeks at #1 for a debut single at rock radio. Great Van Fleet is the first act to have their first two singles simultaneously in the top 10 at rock radio for three weeks, another achievement for a debut band at rock radio.\n\nAfter a year of touring with plenty of sold-out shows across the world, Greta Van Fleet announce a number of headline dates on their 2018 North American tour, which will include the band’s Canadian concert debut, see details below. Tickets go on sale this Friday, February 23 at 10AM local time, log onto the band’s website for a full list of tour dates.\n\nSince the band burst on-to the scene with “Highway Tune” last year, Greta Van Fleet have been one of the most-buzzed about rock bands on the scene today; recently named as part of the\n\n“Emerging Artists” on Billboard and notable mention from Rolling Stone, Variety, Alternative Press and more. Back in November, Greta Van Fleet released their double EP From The Fires through Universal Music Canada, the country’s leading music company, which debuted at #1 on rock charts and has remained in the Top 10 overall album charts since.\n\nGreta Van Fleet is four young musicians, brothers Josh (vocals), Jake (guitar) and Sam (bass/keys) Kiszka, and best friend Danny Wagner (drums). They’re all from the tiny Michigan hamlet of Frankenmuth known for its family-style chicken dinners and the world’s largest Christmas store. All four were raised on their parents’ extensive vinyl collections (shared influences are Muddy Waters, Lightnin’ Hopkins, The Who, Jimi Hendrix), and were encouraged to be creative, daring and innovative. Each band member has killer musical chops and Josh has a voice that is simply jaw dropping. The band is making some of the most exciting, high-energy, sweaty, sexy rock’n’roll heard in a long time, and are bound and determined to bring real rock’n’roll back to the mainstream."
