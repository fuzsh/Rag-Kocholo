        "text": "Linda L. Carrell, 77, of Blue Springs, MO, passed away on Monday, March 1st, 2021 at her home. A celebration of Linda’s life will be held at a later date. Arrangements have been entrusted to Meyers Funeral Chapel in Blue Springs. Memories of Linda and words of comfort for her family may be shared at meyersfuneralchapel.com.\n\nLinda was born on October 19, 1943 in Kansas City, Kansas, the daughter of Richard J. Holt and Muretta (Geer) Holt. She graduated from Bonner Springs High School before earning her Associates degree. Linda later went on to work as a district secretary and dispatcher for Missouri Public Service, and administrative assistant for John Deere before retiring at the age of 63.\n\nLinda was a self-described introvert, avid gardener, dog lover, and cook. She loved every logic puzzle and crossword available from the Google Play Store, and all things Agatha Christie. She collected antique hat boxes, silver trays, horse riding memorabilia, books, moccasins, and dishes, and she was happiest walking the isles of the Home Goods store or any nursery in town. She loved her morning coffee, afternoon tea, and said often she never met a potato she didn’t like – and her mashed potatoes were the best. Her favorite mottos were, “Never look back, just keep going,” and, “Anything you can solve with money isn’t that big a problem”. She had a way of keeping things in perspective, even during the most challenging times in her life.\n\nLinda was a wonderful mother, and friend. She always encouraged anyone who wanted to make a change for the better. She used to say, “Everyone should reinvent themselves once and a while,” and she often did this in her own life.\n\nLinda was also an avid reader. Her love of reading brought on a love of writing, and her column, Echoes from the Past, was published weekly in The Odessan newspaper. Linda’s many columns, written every week without fail since 1990, reflected her witty take on everyday life, and always brought smiles to the faces of her readers. Writing was a labor of love for Linda.\n\nOne of Linda’s proudest accomplishments was writing and publishing a fictional mystery novel which she titled, Doctor, Lawyer, Indian Chief. She worked hard to use her experience with small towns and love of mysteries and humor to bring her characters and story to life.\n\nLinda also studied the Bible avidly in order to build her faith and delve more deeply into understanding the grace of God in her life. She made it a priority to develop a close relationship with Him. She was a great source of wisdom, and an encourager and teacher for others in this area, and was looking forward to being with the Father, and His son, when she passed.\n\nHer wit, wisdom, and calming presence will be greatly missed.\n\nSurvivors include her daughter, Chris Carrell of Independence, MO; son, Sam Carrell of Blue Springs, MO; sister, Mary Jo Van Fleet and husband Frank Van Fleet of Kansas City, KS; sister, Robin Kurtz of Tellico Plains TN; She was preceded in death by her parents."
