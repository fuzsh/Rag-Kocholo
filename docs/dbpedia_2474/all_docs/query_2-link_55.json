The play is a museum piece out of the ’30s, which Miller has never intellectually left, but the performances of Pat Hingle and Arthur Kennedy as sibling rivals blow away a little of the dust.\n\nJOE EGG. The juxtaposition of the horrifying and the hilarious forms part of the common round of existence—and of this startling play. British Writer Peter Nichols constructs a comedy of anguish, extracting laughter from the uncomic plight and blistering pain of two parents (Albert Finney and Zena Walker) whose ten-year-old daughter is a spastic.\n\nDARLING OF THE DAY is another of this season’s dead-as-the-dodo musicals. Weary of adulation, a famous painter assumes his deceased valet’s identity and achieves happiness with a pneumatic widow. As the painter, Vincent Price acts like a berserk semaphore and sings in a mauve whisper. As the widow, Patricia Routledge performs with a joyous professional authority lacking in the score and the show.\n\nPANTAGLEIZE is Michel de Ghelderode’s inventive celebration of the individual “unfit for anything except love, friendship and ardor,” and a condemnation of our “autodisintegrated age.” The APA production projects much of the excitement and magic typical of the Belgian playwright.\n\nTHE SHOWOFF. An unwelcome son-in-law crashes like a wayward meteor into the mundane sphere of the earthy Fisher household and sets it ablaze with his inflammatory manner. George Kelly’s 43-year-old comedy is revived by the APA.\n\nROSENCRANTZ AND GUILDENSTERN ARE DEAD. To Shakespeare, Hamlet’s university friends were nothing but functionaries, but to British Playwright Tom Stoppard, they are pawns in a weighted chess match —for which they cannot even decipher the rules. Brian Murray, John Wood and Paul Hecht provide spirited, sophisticated acting.\n\nOff Broadway\n\nYOUR OWN THING. Writer-Director Donald Driver mixes media and blends bits of the Bard with shreds of Hollywood folklore, shakes them up with high jinks and low camp, and comes out with an ingratiating rock musical version of Twelfth Night.\n\nTHE INDIAN WANTS THE BRONX. A new and gifted playwright, Israel Horovitz, has taken the tiger of violence that prowls the New York streets. and released it on the stage with terrifying veracity as two young punks savage an East Indian.\n\nRECORDS\n\nOrchestral\n\nMAHLER: THE NINE SYMPHONIES (Columbia; 15 LPs). Even at a price of $100 for the handsomely leather-bound set, this blockbuster has for weeks been listed as one of Billboard’s bestselling classical albums. As the apotheosis of romanticism, Gustav Mahler is very much in vogue, and the most flamboyant of his latter-day champions is Leonard Bernstein, who has been building up this treasury of recordings with the New York Philharmonic for seven years. No one can argue with the power and variety of Bernstein’s interpretations, but his gifts are most appropriate to the later symphonies, from the Fifth on, with their careening metaphysics, thorny textures and dramatic contradictions. Bernstein explains that Mahler is “roughhewn and epicene, subtle and blatant, refined, raw, objective, maudlin, brash, shy, grandiose, self-annihilating, confident, insecure.” Each symphony is also being released separately, and the Eighth, in particular, is not to be missed, as Bernstein masses his musical forces, in this case, the London Symphony Orchestra, for an impassioned yes to the whole cosmos.\n\nBEETHOVEN: THE NINE SYMPHONIES (RCA Victrola; 8 LPs). Another big package, but at the bargain price of $20. Not everyone agrees with Arturo Toscanini’s distinctly brisk, no-nonsense approach to Beethoven. About the heroic first movement of the Third Symphony, the maestro once dryly commented: “Some say this is Napoleon, some Hitler, some Mussolini. For me it is simply allegro con brio.” Still, Toscanini’s brio was like no one else’s, and the NBC Symphony strikes sparks as it builds to one peak of excitement after another, and then softly and precisely casts long incandescent arcs of melody. The recordings date mostly from the early ’50s, and are mono only.\n\nCINEMA\n\nPOOR COW. TV Director Kenneth Loach’s first film tells the story of a scruffy London slum dweller (Carol White) with humanity that is never sentimental and humor that never hurts.\n\nTHE JUNGLE BOOK. Walt Disney’s animated version of the Kipling children’s classic is thoroughly delightful and clearly aimed at the below-twelve market.\n\nTHE PRODUCERS. Zero Mostel as a Broad way producer caricatures Merrick not as David but Goliath in this often disjointed and inconsistent yet frequently uproariously funny film directed by Mel Brooks. THE GRADUATE. Director Mike Nichols doesn’t quite pull a Babbitt out of the hat in this sophomoronic film about the disillusioning encounters suffered by an idealist college grad (Dustin Hoffman) when he returns home to Los Angeles.\n\nBOOKS\n\nBest Reading\n\nDEATH IN LIFE: SURVIVORS OF HIROSHIMA, by Robert Jay Lifton. As he sifts the recollections of 75 persons who lived through the first atomic bombing, an American psychiatrist discerns the effects of large-scale disasters on behavior.\n\nTHE CODEBREAKERS, by David Kahn. More than 1,000 pages of cryptologic lore, including accounts of how ciphers changed the currents of history.\n\nTHE NEW AMERICAN COMMONWEALTH, by Louis Keren.

A shattering fictionalization of the futile 1831 Negro slave revolt in Virginia, based on the confession of the man who led it.\n\nBest Sellers\n\nFICTION\n\n1. Topaz, Uris (2 last week)\n\n2.
