        "text": "Career\n\nBorn in Oakland, California to Roy Van Fleet and Elizabeth \"Bessie\" Catherine (n√©e Gardner), Jo Van Fleet established herself as a notable dramatic actress on Broadway over several years, beginning in 1946 in Dorcas in A Winter\"s Tale, and played Regan in King Lear opposite Louis Calhern in 1950. After her success on the stage, director Elia Kazan brought her to Hollywood to work on screen. Kazan, who had directed her on stage in 1952\"s Flight to Egypt and 1953\"s Camino Real, cast her as Cathy Ames in his film adaptation of John Steinbeck\"s East of Eden (1955).\n\nThis was her film debut.\n\nHer subsequent film work was steady through 1960, and included such films as The Rose Tattoo (1955), I\"ll Cry Tomorrow (1955), The King and Four Queens (1956), and Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957). However, her career did not progress as she had hoped.\n\nHer friend and mentor, Kazan, once said \"Jo stagnated, and, since she knew it, was bitter. And as she became bitter, she become more difficult.\"\n\nHer later films included Wild River (1960) -- though only 46, Fleet would spend five hours every morning getting into her make-up and applying wrinkles to play the role of an 89-year-old matriarch -- Rodgers and Hammerstein\"s Cinderella (1965), as Paul Newman\"s mother in Cool Hand Luke (1967), and I Love You, Alice B. Toklas (1968).\n\nHer television work included Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Thriller, Bonanza and The Wild Wild West."
