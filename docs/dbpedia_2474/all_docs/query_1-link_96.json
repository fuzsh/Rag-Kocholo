        "text": "Anna’Dee Vanfleet was born August 4, 1957, to Willard and Doris Vanfleet. She passed away on August 30, 2021. Our Miss Anna’Dee had the permanent state of a 5-year old’s innocence. As part of that innocence, she had Janet, which she named every doll and every stuffed animal through her life. Anna’Dee was a proud and worthy member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day saints.\n\nYou could always find Anna’Dee smiling, laughing and enjoying life to the best of her ability. After her mother’s death Anna’Dee had another chance with having an earth-bound mother. She received 3 brand new moms who would never let her feel unloved or alone. On March 12, 2002, she was “adopted” by her siblings Marian Smith and Barbara Cates. Seven years later she was “adopted” by her niece Erin Lacey Cates. As the years went by it turned into the “Miss Anna Mom squad.”\n\nAnyone who saw the sparkle in her eyes new the things that brought that extra sparkle. She loved being a part of DUP, Riding Flex tram and trax, ALL holidays, going out to eat and big jewelry and head bands. She loved her Carnival Cruise trip and her big sense of style that included multiple layers of miss-matched clothing and her signature vest, because you never knew if it was going to snow on that 100-degree summer day. She loved wearing her face mask and doing her part to curve the virus even if she was just at home watching T.V. She also loved Volunteering at her great nieces Sadiey and Makenna Myler’s elementary. She would put books away, stamp them and have school lunch with her sister Barbara. She also loved doing crafts and being a part of those around her everyday life.\n\nOur Anna’Dee will be missed by all those left behind. We take comfort in knowing that Mama and Daddy came and got her hand and said it’s time to come home.\n\nAnna’Dee is preceded in death by her father Willard, her mother Doris and her sister Jeanne, along with Larry Smith (Marian Smith’s late husband), her nieces Vanda'Jo West and Valinda West, her nephews Ray Westover and Stirling Vanfleet.\n\nShe is survived by her siblings Doris’Lee (David) Westover, Marian Smith (her earthly mom), Mark (Linda) Vanfleet, Barbara (Hal) Cates, Vickie (Bill) Cates and Robert (Sol) Vanfleet. Anna’Dee had so many nieces and nephews, but a few that will always have a special place in her heart are Erin Lacey Cates (Joseph Arbon), Johnnie (Marcy) West, Vilisha (Walter) Watchman and Vennette (Clayton) Farr along with many great nieces and nephews and great-great nieces and nephews.\n\nThere will be a viewing held on Wednesday, September 8, 2021, from 6:00-8:00 p.m. at Larkin Mortuary- Riverton (3688 West 12600 South Riverton, Utah 84065) and a Graveside Service Thursday, September 9, 2021, at 11:00 a.m. at Elysian Burial Gardens (1075 East 4580 South Millcreek, Utah 84117)."
