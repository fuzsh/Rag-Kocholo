        "text": "American actress (1915–1996)\n\nJo Van Fleet (December 29, 1915[1] – June 10, 1996) was an American stage, film, and television actress. During her long career, which spanned over four decades, she often played characters much older than her actual age. Van Fleet won a Tony Award in 1954 for her performance in the Broadway production The Trip to Bountiful, and the next year she won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in East of Eden.[2]\n\nEarly life and training\n\n[edit]\n\nJosephine Kay Van Fleet/Catherin J VanFleet was born in 1915 in Oakland, California, the younger of two daughters of Michigan native Roy H. Van Fleet and Indiana native Elizabeth \"Bessie\" Catherine (née Gardner).[3][4] Her father Roy worked for the railroads, but died in 1919 of a streptococcus throat infection which was lanced, inadvertently spreading the disease throughout his body. Federal census records show that by age five Josephine, her 18-year-old sister Corinne, and their widowed mother were living in Oakland with Bessie's parents, Ralph and Mary Gardner.[5] To help support herself and her two daughters at her parents' home, Bessie worked as a \"sales lady\" in an Oakland dry goods store.[5]\n\nWhile she had an early interest in stage productions, \"Jo\" graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in 1936, focusing on a variety of subjects, and then spent several years as a high school teacher in Morro Bay, California. She continued her theatrical training in a graduate program at the College of the Pacific in Stockton, California.[6] She moved after her graduation from her masters program to New York City, where she continued her training with Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse.[6][7]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1944, Van Fleet began her professional stage career and immediately distinguished herself in the role of Miss Phipps in the production of Uncle Harry at the National Theatre in Washington, D.C.[8][9] Two years later, in New York, she distinguished herself as well on Broadway by her performances as Dorcas in Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale; and yet again, in 1950, as Regan opposite Louis Calhern in King Lear.[2] She won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play in 1954 for her portrayal of Jessie Mae Watts in Horton Foote's The Trip to Bountiful, costarring Lillian Gish and Eva Marie Saint.\n\nDespite her early successes on the stage, Van Fleet continued to refine her skills in the late 1940s and early 1950s by studying with Elia Kazan and Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio in New York.[8] Kazan in 1952 directed her in the play Flight to Egypt and the following year in Camino Real. In 1954 he encouraged her to work in films in Hollywood. There Kazan cast her in his screen adaptation of John Steinbeck's East of Eden (1955) for Warner Bros. In that production—her film debut—Van Fleet portrays Cathy Ames, the mother of James Dean's character.[2] Her performance, which was widely praised by critics, won her an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Her subsequent film work was steady through 1960 and included films such as The Rose Tattoo (1955), I'll Cry Tomorrow (1955), The King and Four Queens (1956), and Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957). Her career, however, did not progress as she had hoped. Her friend and mentor, Kazan, personally experienced her frustrations: \"'Jo stagnated, and, since she knew it, was bitter. And as she became bitter, she became more difficult.'\"[2] In an interview for the Los Angeles Times after her Oscar-winning performance in East of Eden, Van Fleet openly expressed her concerns \"about being typecast in tragic roles\".[8]\n\nIn 1958, Van Fleet was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for her performance in Look Homeward, Angel, in which she played the acquisitive mother of Anthony Perkins' character. Her later films included Wild River (1960), one of the productions in which she played a character far older than her actual age. Only age 44 at the time of Wild River, Van Fleet spent five hours every morning getting into make-up for her role as Ella, the 89-year-old matriarch of the Garth family.[2] Some of her other notable roles include the Wicked Stepmother in Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella (1965), Paul Newman's mother in Cool Hand Luke (1967), and Peter Sellers's mother I Love You, Alice B. Toklas (1968).\n\nVan Fleet's work on television included such series as Naked City, Thriller, Bonanza, The Wild Wild West, and Police Woman. Among her most emotionally charged dramatic performances on television is her portrayal of the bitter, explosive Mrs. Shrike in the 1956 episode \"Shopping for Death\" on Alfred Hitchcock Presents.[10]\n\nVan Fleet's final performance, a brief but \"delicious\" supporting turn in the 1986 TV adaptation of Saul Bellow's Seize the Day,[11] elicited this comment from Washington Post critic Tom Shales:\n\nJo Van Fleet, who seems even to walk and blink legendarily, has a tiny part and only two small scenes as Mrs. Einhorn, an old woman with two incontinent dachshunds, but what a piquant impression she makes.[12]\n\nPersonal life and death\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1946, Van Fleet married William G. Bales, whose career in modern dance included work as a performer, choreographer, professor at Bennington College, and the founding Dean of Dance at the State University of New York at Purchase, N. Y. They remained together until his death in 1990.[6] The couple had one child, Michael Bales.[13]\n\nIn February 1960, in recognition of her career in the motion-picture industry, as well as her work on stage and in television, Van Fleet was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[14] It is located at 7010 Hollywood Boulevard.[14] Politically, she was a Democrat, and in the 1952 United States presidential election she supported Adlai Stevenson.[15]\n\nVan Fleet died at age 80 from undisclosed causes in New York City at Jamaica Hospital in Queens. Her body was cremated and her ashes were returned to her family.[16]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1955 Max Liebman Spectaculars Aunt Dete Episode: \"Heidi\" Star Tonight Irene Rankin Episode: \"Concerning Death\" East of Eden Kate Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress\n\nNominated—BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles The Philco Television Playhouse Shirley Episode: \"A Business Proposition\" The Rose Tattoo Bessie I'll Cry Tomorrow Katie Roth 1956 Kraft Theatre Ma Episode: \"Snapfinger Creek\" The King and Four Queens Ma McDade Alfred Hitchcock Presents Mrs. Shrike Season 1 Episode 18: \"Shopping for Death\" 1957 Gunfight at the O.K.
