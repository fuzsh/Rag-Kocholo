        "text": "I knew for years Beatrice Sparks was a consummate liar, fraud, con artist, and general all-around terrible person, but this book made me hate her even more. There were so many shocking revelations, like how she lied to Avon Books about the CDC approving the medical content of It Happened to Nancy, threw a fit when she discovered Columbia University’s Go Ask Alice website and book (with honest, modern advice about sex, sexual health, relationships, mental health, drugs, etc.) because it was the radical opposite of her Molly Mormon POV, kept a scrapbook gleefully documenting the troubles befalling the innocent Barrett family after she turned their son Alden’s journal into a work of near-total fiction with a bizarre Satanic theme, and, most of all, how her most famous books launched two of the biggest moral panics of the late 20th century.\n\nMr. Emerson interweaves Dr. Fraud’s pre-stardom years and the explosive slush pile manuscript that became Go Ask Alice with the story of how drug use became such a moral panic, along with the history of LSD and the first trips of inadvertent inventor Albert Hofmann. In a tale as old as time, old-guard conservatives were morally outraged by a world they no longer understood and held complete, unquestioned control over, a world radically rebelling against the social norms of the Fifties (a decade that was truly an aberration in history caused by certain factors coming together, not the last gasp of how things had always been).\n\nDrugs have been a part of our lives for as long as we’ve been human, in various forms, but the WASP establishment only took serious notice and started trying to pass strict anti-drug laws when their kids were involved in crimes and suicides attributed (falsely or not) to drugs. A lot of the anti-drug rhetoric in the earlier 20th century, way before hippies and beatniks, was incredibly, openly, undeniably racist, since Mexican migrant workers and Black jazz musicians used pot, and they didn’t want their white and delightsome kids to copy that.\n\nTwo of these victims were 18-year-old Linda Fitzpatrick, who was murdered with her 21-year-old boyfriend in what was claimed to be a drug party gone wrong, and 20-year-old Diane Linkletter, the daughter of popular, happy-go-lucky media personality Art Linkletter, who killed herself by jumping out of a window.\n\nMr. Linkletter wanted someone, something to blame, and turned his ire on LSD, which Diane had taken before killing herself. He had a prior connection with Beatrice Sparks through the failed Family Advancement Institute (an MLM with inspirational lectures on records), and Dr. Fraud continued pitching ideas to his son Jack after FAI went south.\n\nNo trace of any drug was found in Diane’s autopsy, but her grieving father had already blasted the media with the drug connection, and now became even more fervently anti-drug. He perpetuated the urban legend about LSD staying in the body forever and causing random flashbacks. (Later, he changed his tack and promoted medical treatment and decriminalization of soft drugs.)\n\nArt Linkletter, 1912–2010\n\nThe world seemed to be going up in flames in the late Sixties, and the conservative backlash against the countercultural movement majorly amped up when Nixon won in a landslide. One of his pet causes was the War on Drugs, which treated all drugs equally, and enacted very severe penalties for any kind of perceived offence.\n\nNow the stage was set for Dr. Fraud to blast out her first morality play to great acclaim. She’d been trying and failing to become someone her entire life, and her chance seemed to be slipping away as she passed fifty. The anti-drug moral panic, which disseminated a lot of misinformation about drugs (which were largely limited to fairly harmless ones like pot, LSD, and uppers in the years before hard drugs like crack cocaine and meth got popular), was the perfect time and place for Go Ask Alice to succeed.\n\nMr. Emerson explores how the War on Drugs unfolded during the 1970s, and how the positive reception of Go Ask Alice, with barely anyone voicing any doubts about its true authorship, increased the moral panic even further. Meanwhile, Dr. Fraud was stewing about not having her name anywhere on the book, even as its discoverer or editor.\n\nThis swell of popularity also brought the book to the attention of censors, who were outraged their little suburban snowflakes were reading about drugs and sex. On the opposite end of the spectrum, many parents, publishers, and librarians defended the book as a very important tool for helping to keep young people off of drugs.\n\nAlice‘s popularity also led to a hit TV movie starring William Shatner, Andy Griffith, and Jamie Jackson. It was aired many, many times over the ensuing years, and won and was nominated for several awards.\n\nMr. Emerson then turns his attention to Alden Barrett, the troubled young man who wrote 21 of the 212 entries in Jay’s Journal. He was different from the rest of his family from an early age, and adolescence hit even harder, not least because he didn’t want to be a good little cookie-cutter, conformist, conservative, unquestioning Peter Priesthood in the heart of the Morridor. Alden had many issues with The Morg, and his parents at one point took the door off his room, stripped him almost naked, and made him write a detailed accounting of his sins and faults before he could have his door back.\n\nAlden also had problems with drugs, but he got clean and seemed committed to staying clean. During his junior year, he began dating a senior, Teresa Blain, and both sets of parents heartily disapproved of their love and seriousness.\n\nSadly, Alden took his own life on 13 March 1971, aged only sixteen, leaving behind his journal and lots of unanswered questions.\n\nIn 1977, Alden’s mother Marcella read an interview with Dr. Fraud, and felt she could do with Alden’s journal what she had done with Alice’s, helping hurting young people and showing them there’s another way. Instead, Dr. Fraud disgustingly used the Barretts and turned Alden’s story into a bizarre Satanic tale. They didn’t even know she’d published it until people told them about it.\n\nDr. Fraud couldn’t be arsed to change identifying details properly, and left some details as-is, like the name of a radio station. She also changed the names of three of Alden’s friends but used their real names for another group of pals. Thus, people in Pleasant Grove, Utah immediately figured it out.\n\nShortly before the release of Jay’s Journal, Dr. Fraud released VOICES, which was a complete bomb. Critics lambasted the unrealistic scenarios and language (plus the very offensive homophobia) and questioned whether Dr. Fraud had really interviewed over 1,000 runaways and gotten permission from their parents to use their stories.\n\nJay’s Journal, however, was a huge hit that more than made up for this ego bruising. Even more significantly, it created another moral panic, the great Satanic Panic of the Eighties and Nineties. Mr. Emerson goes into great detail about this horrifying social contagion that ruined so many lives with accusations of ritual Satanic abuse. So many people unquestioningly went along with these bizarre claims and the idea of recovered memories. Even Dungeons & Dragons was castigated as a Satanic influence destroying our youth and a strong sign of Devil worship.\n\nThe Barretts also suffered incredibly thanks to this disgusting con artist. When they finally met again in 1985, Dr. Fraud dared to deflect everything, treated them like the bad guys for not lovingly pile-driving their heads up her exploitative, lying ass, tone-deafly sang the praises of the book and how much positive impact it had, and even handed out book reviews like damn homework. She said they were in denial about Alden, even though she was the one who invented the Satanic story. Lying, lying monster!\n\nMr. and Mrs. Barrett eventually divorced, and Alden’s grave was desecrated and stolen several times. Morgbots believe in demons big-time, and they lapped up this tale of one of their own engaging in alleged Satanism and dark occult arts as 100% true.\n\nDr. Fraud published six more fake teen journals, and took a very condescending “Screw you, I do what I want!” attitude with editors when they dared suggest, e.g., teens would be scared off by an adult’s name on a book, or that a lot of things weren’t adding up in these supposed journals. When she pitched her next book, It Happened to Nancy, she began billing herself as a Ph.D. with a clinical adolescent psychology practice. In reality, she never had any college degrees, and only attended YBU for five months.\n\nPretending to be a psychologist, even on paper, is a crime in Utah. Her ass should’ve been in jail, not continuing to spew out more and more brazen garbage with herself written in as an all-conquering hero! The only reason her books had such light editing is because they were presented as real journals, not fictional manuscripts. They all read like first draft garbage of someone who needs an intense crash course in every single aspect of writing.\n\nPlus, the exact same voice, style, and linguistic quirks appear in each and every book. Her characters also all sound like 70-year-old conservative Mormons delivering holier than thou moral lectures, not modern teens with modern sensibilities. It’s shocking her editors never figured it out earlier.\n\nMr. Emerson ultimately cycles back to Go Ask Alice and whether the story was entirely the product of that old crank’s imagination, drawn from an actual diary, or inspired by someone she knew and then embellished.\n\nHe also reveals she was keeping a sick scrapbook of the Barretts’ misfortunes, gleefully recording every single second of their ruination. This old crank also couldn’t even forge properly, and made up every single “doctor” who endorsed her books. At the time of her death, one of her unfinished manuscripts was endorsed by more fake doctors.\n\nThe only things I disliked about this book were how casual and unprofessional the language often was (like frequent uses of the F-bomb), and how Mr. Emerson has no index or footnotes. Try saying your dissertation has no citations because everything is easily-verified public record or from private conversations! It’s particularly ironic in a book about an inveterate liar.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nVery surprisingly, I only just read Beatrice Sparks’s first and most famous fraud, Go Ask Alice, this year. I’m kind of disappointed I didn’t have a chance to read it before I found out it’s bad Mormon propaganda and not a real teen’s journal. Had I believed it was real, I’m sure I would’ve been just as creeped out and sucked in as when I read her second fraud, Jay’s Journal.\n\nI found out from Rick Emerson’s excellent book Unmask Alice that this book was instrumental in launching Nixon’s War on Drugs and came in the thick of a moral panic about white, bourgeois, suburban kids using drugs (versus the Black, Hispanic, poor, intellectual, artsy, and urban drug users the establishment cared less about). They only started giving a damn about drug use when it hit close to home.\n\nSince I believe in giving credit where credit is due and trying to find at least one good thing to say about everyone or everything, I will give very grudging praise to Dr. Fraud for making an attempt to try to sound like a real teen before Alice gets into drugs. The language isn’t really true to how a teen would talk or write, but the sentiments are very accurate to the adolescent experience. E.g., being upset at having to move in the middle of high school, separation from one’s closest friend, rejection by a crush, feeling fat and ugly, not fitting in at a new school.\n\nHowever, no real teen is that lovey-dovey with her parents, constantly proclaiming how dear, sweet, pwecious, wise, angelic, and perfect they are, nor do they tend to repeat words thrice for emphasis (over and over again!) or regularly break out show-off vocab words.\n\nDespite the title, the narrator’s name is never disclosed, and one line suggests it might be Carla. There’s also another character named Alice. However, I’m going to call her Alice for convenience.\n\nAlice starts keeping a journal shortly before her fifteenth birthday, and early on has a huge disappointment when her longtime crush Roger stands her up. However, she soon has an even more devastating dilemma on her hands when her dad is invited to be the dean of political science at a university in another state, which compels her to leave everything and everyone she knows.\n\nJust as Alice feared, when her family moves shortly after the new year (1969?) begins, she can’t find friends. Meanwhile her younger siblings, Tim and Alexandria, have no problem making lots of new friends. Alice, like too many other teen girls, is also convinced she’s fat and is trying to lose weight.\n\nIn May, Alice finally makes a friend, Beth Baum, whom she quickly becomes very close to. (Dr. Fraud’s total ignorance of Judaism is on full display in some of the entries about Beth, like claiming weddings can be cancelled if the groom thinks the bride doesn’t have a factory-sealed hymen, and insulting the importance of marrying within our people.) Alice and Beth are very upset when they have to part for the summer. Beth goes to camp, while Alice goes to stay by her grandma in her old city.\n\nOver the summer, Alice is thrilled to be invited to a party, where she gets a Coke spiked with LSD and has an amazing trip. Dr. Fraud’s complete ignorance about drugs rushes to the fore from this point on.\n\nAlice goes on for four pages about her first trip, which amazingly starts almost immediately and only lasts a few hours. On average, it takes 20 minutes to two hours for LSD to kick in, and most trips last 6–12 hours. You can’t go home with perfectly normal functions that soon! For a first trip, being closely monitored is particularly important.\n\nLSD also isn’t known to be addictive, nor is it a gateway drug. Hilariously, Alice immediately has an insatiable taste for every drug in existence, yet the last one she gets to is pot (the classic gateway drug). She also has sex for the first time while on acid a month later.\n\nWhen Beth returns from camp, Alice is upset she now has a boyfriend whom she’s spending all her time with, but not that upset, since she soon turns her attention to new BFF and fellow druggie Chris.\n\nAlice is soon selling acid to elementary school kids, and she and Chris spend almost all their time with new boyfriends Richie and Ted. When they catch Richie and Ted having sex with one another, they rat them out to the cops for being drug dealers and run away to San Francisco to avoid getting in trouble for squealling. (Dr. Fraud repeatedly pushes the POV that drugs cause homosexuality, and liberally uses homophobic slurs.)\n\nIn a total wish-fulfillment scenario, Alice and Chris are able to find great jobs at an upscale jewelry store soon after quitting their original crummy jobs, and then start their own boutique after less than a month. They meet lots of famous people, go to lavish parties, and do lots of drugs during this time.\n\nAlice decides she can’t handle San Francisco and its drug world, so she calls home and of course is immediately, unquestioningly, lovingly forgiven by her pwecious, pwecious, pwecious parents, who are thrilled to welcome her back in time for Christmas.\n\nThe honeymoon doesn’t last long, and Alice soon runs away again to get away from constantly being watched. During the ensuing months of homelessness, moving around from place to place, prostitution, and constantly being high, she journals on paper bags, napkins, scraps of paper, and single pieces of paper. Not only that, she amazingly keeps this ramshackle journal with her and in chronological order (albeit without any dates).\n\nA priest eventually helps Alice to realize she needs to get clean and go home, and calls her darling, sweet, endlessly forgiving Mommykins and Daddykins, who once again lovingly take her back without any questions or anger.\n\nAlice’s grandpap dies shortly after she returns, and she becomes obsessed with the image of maggots and worms crawling all over his corpse. She also has lots of problems with her former drug pals trying to suck her back in, who are as vengeful as mobsters going after an informant. Then her grandma dies, and both problems become even worse.\n\nI laughed out loud at the lame insults of the druggie “kids” (as Alice constantly calls her own peers, just like all of Dr. Fraud’s other narrators). Hardened druggies can do way better than “Miss Polly Pure,” “Miss Fink Mouth,” “Mary Pure,” and “Miss Super Fink Mouth, Miss Double Triple Fink Mouth.”\n\nAlice goes to babysit while she’s getting her life back in order, and ends up in hospital with bandaged hands and a head injury. She has no idea how she ended up there or hurt herself. Yet another miracle of miracles, she’s able to journal in hospital and with bulky gauze all over her hands! While she’s there, she continues hallucinating about the worms and maggots, who are now eating her.\n\nIt turns out someone somehow broke into the house where she was babysitting and planted acid-laced chocolate peanuts. Yes, that thing all druggies do when friends decide to go clean! Alice went nuts on acid and saw the worms and maggots on her grandpap and herself, and began banging her head against a wall and tearing out her hair.\n\nShe gets to take her journal with her when she’s transferred to a reformatory, where she befriends a 13-year-old named Babbie. Babbie started using drugs at age eleven, when a 32-year-old man gave some to her at the movies. By age twelve, she was prostituting. (And like all of the other troubled “kids” in Dr. Fraud’s books, her problems are attributed to the sin of divorced parents.)\n\nAlice finally gets out of the reformatory, committed to staying clean, and embarks on a happy new life ensconced back with her conservative bourgeois suburban family (depicted as the ideal, versus those icky countercultural urban liberals). She totally swears off her former “evil” ways, and now wants nothing more than to be a good little wifeykins for her very understanding boyfriend Joel. She also wants to be a youth social worker so she can scare other “kids” away from dope.\n\nAnd then she randomly dies three weeks after deciding to quit journalling. (It really pissed me off how Dr. Fraud implies journals are only for teens, since adults should discuss their problems with other people. That’s not the only reason to keep a journal, you stupid fraudster! Then again, The Morg highly discourages private lives.)\n\nThis book reads like a bad first draft of someone who never learnt how to write beyond a sixth grade level. It’s also full of Dr. Fraud’s trademarks, like repeating a word thrice for emphasis, calling peers “the kids,” and lovingly worshipping cartoonishly saintly parents. (And why can’t she be consistent with what Alice calls her parents? She even uses different names for them in successive entries, like Mama, Mom, and Mother, and Dad, Daddy, and Father!)\n\nThis is so clearly bad anti-drug propaganda that only got a publishing deal because it came out at the right time, backed by the right connections. At least Art Linkletter, who played an instrumental role in its creation, later advocated decriminalization of soft drugs and reform over jail. Beatrice Sparks maintained the same “All drugs bad! They lead to automatic ruin and death!” attitude to the end.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nWhen I tentatively began exploring Roger’s solo catalogue in 2002, I was quite nervous and expected the worst. Thanks to the loud voices of the older guys on my Who mailing lists, I was led to believe it was hit-or-miss at best and embarrassing garbage at worst. Of course, the consensus on my estrogen Who lists was much different. As proudly tomboyish and gender-defiant as I’ve always been, I can’t deny the experience and opinions of male and female Who fans are often radically divergent!\n\nI decided to sample Roger’s solo stuff because I was familiar with his voice and liked it very much. I had a general sense of what I’d be getting, despite how unreasonably nervous I used to be about trying anything new musically.\n\nRoger himself understood early on he’d probably never be a huge solo star, and approached it as a fun hobby to pass the time and keep singing when The Who weren’t touring or recording their own albums. He didn’t do much marketing for his solo work, and didn’t even tour by himself.\n\nAll that aside, however, his solo albums aren’t nearly as bad as they’ve gotten the reputation of. The whole point of going solo, for many artists, is to try something new and break away from the type of music they made with their bands. Most of Roger’s solo albums don’t have a Who-like sound because that’s not what he was going for!\n\nI will never understand so-called fans who whine and rant because a band or artist dared to experiment with a new style of music instead of spending their entire career constantly remaking their quintessentially greatest albums. No one is denying the strength and awesomeness of those records, but it would get really boring fast if all their songs sounded like mindless carbon copies. Many artists become one-hit wonders because their follow-up sounds way too much like that first big hit, and people laugh about it.\n\nRoger also understood most Who fans weren’t wild about his solo albums, and that he was targeting a different type of audience. The voice is the same, but the songs aren’t. If you can recognise and respect that, you’ll probably enjoy his solo catalogue a lot more.\n\nHearing the worst and subsequently having very low expectations also helped me to like most of his albums far more than I thought I would. They’re not nearly as bad as I was falsely led to believe.\n\nJust about everyone recommended McVicar first, since it’s a de facto Who album. Not only do Pete and John play and sing background vocals, but the songs also have a very Who-like feel. If you didn’t know this is a Roger solo album, you’d think it was The Who playing as The Who.\n\nAnother great place to start, or to go after McVicar, is Under a Raging Moon. It too has a very Who-like sound (which Roger was deliberately going for), and Pete even wrote the first track. As you might guess, the eponymous closing track is a tribute to Keith Moon.\n\nMy third-favourite album is One of the Boys, which was a hugely pleasant surprise. Every single song is a winner for me, and the album’s eclectic nature works for it instead of against it. Roger used a much wider group of songwriters than usual, so he wasn’t tied to just one style. This is perhaps his most criminally underrated album.\n\nI also adore Can’t Wait to See the Movie, which is a marvellous trip down memory lane for me as a proud Eighties kid. While it has those trademark synths that musically defined my childhood decade, it’s not exclusively welded to that era like some other Eighties albums.\n\nI couldn’t resist getting his eponymous 1973 début, since it was only $2 and Roger looks so beautiful and angelic on the cover. It makes no pretension of being timeless music or even a 5-star album, but it is a really fun listen. Not all music is meant to be serious and tailored to perfection. Sometimes you just want to kick back and listen to something lightweight, just as there are times you go for eating ice-cream and corn chips on the davenport instead of a five-course meal at a super-expensive restaurant.\n\nRocks in the Head is another fun romp, this time marked with the trademark style of the early Nineties. I only recently finally got acquainted with it, but it only took a few listens to start getting into it and really liking it.\n\nRide a Rock Horse is also a fun, rocking romp, but it’s never been one of my favourites. I appreciate and like it more now than I originally did, after listening to it again for the first time in many years, but it’s not what I’d personally recommend for someone just getting into his solo work. You always want to start with the strongest examples.\n\nParting Should Be Painless is his weakest solo effort, in my opinion. It’s not that the material is necessarily bad, just not presented in the strongest way. The individual songs would probably sound a lot better if they came up by themselves on the radio or a playlist, but they don’t work when collected on the same album. Even an album with a deliberately depressing theme should have more energy than this!\n\nIf you just want a sample of everything before committing to an entire album, you can try the greatest hits compilations Best Bits (1981), Best of Rockers & Ballads (1991), Martyrs & Madmen (1997), Anthology (1998), and Moonlighting: The Anthology (2005). Best Bits contains two previously-unreleased songs, “Treachery” and “Martyrs and Madmen” (#38 in the U.S.). “Say It Ain’t So, Joe” was also re-released and went to #41 in the U.S.\n\nRoger sings lead on some of the songs on the Lisztomania soundtrack, which is a fair bit better than the movie.\n\nIn 2014, Roger released Going Back Home, a collaborative album with guitarist Wilko Johnson (who was fighting pancreatic cancer at the time). Another new album, As Long As I Have You, came in 2018. I’ve heard a few of their songs on auto-generated Spotify playlists, but have yet to listen to either in entirety.\n\nI’m really glad I took a chance and gave Roger’s solo work a fair listen. While my preference will always be for The Who, followed closely by Pete’s solo work, there are a lot of treasures on Roger’s solo albums. They’re all worth multiple listens.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nImage used solely to illustrate subject for an album review, and consistent with Fair Use Doctrine\n\nThe soundtrack to McVicar, released June 1980, is widely considered Roger’s strongest solo album on account of it being a de facto Who album. Pete and John played on it (despite not being credited as The Who), which provides a very Who-like sound. While this is a very strong contender for the title of Roger’s best work on its own merit, it’s very telling that many people regard it so highly because the other guys are on it. These fans (frequently older guys, in my experience) dismiss Roger’s solo albums where he tried a very different style, as though he owed it to them to only ever make music sounding exactly like Who songs. Artists are allowed to try new things!\n\nMcVicar, in which Roger plays the title role, is based on the memoir McVicar by Himself, written by armed robber and prison escapee John McVicar (21 March 1940–6 September 2022). Roger was so fascinated by Mr. McVicar’s account of prison life, he bought the film rights to the book with the intention of acting in it. Many people also consider this Roger’s best film work.\n\nJohn McVicar began shoplifting and breaking into cars as a teen, and escaped a remand home for juvenile offenders in 1956, aged sixteen. He was sentenced to two years of borstal training (youth detention), and became an armed robber after his release. In 1964 he got in trouble with the law again and was sentenced to two years in prison.\n\nHe escaped custody while he and a dozen other guys were on their way back to HM Prison Parkhurst on the Isle of Wight after a dubious trial. The other escapees were soon discovered during a massive manhunt, but Mr. McVicar remained undetected and got in touch with gang boss Joey Pyle.\n\nMr. Pyle drove down to Portsmouth and took him as far as Dorking, where he attempted to evade a police roadblock. Mr. McVicar jumped out of the car and made a run for it before the cops could corner them in a cul-de-sac.\n\nJohn McVicar (far right) at the Cannes Film Festival with Roger and Adam Faith, May 1980; Copyright Daily Mirror (© Mirrorpix)\n\nMr. McVicar tried to rob an armoured security van while on the run and was busted by cops. More charges were put on him, and he was sentenced to another fifteen years, on top of the eight he was already serving. He was moved to HM Prison Durham, which he once more escaped.\n\nFor two years, he was at large in Blackheath, London, with his girlfriend Shirley Wilshire and their son Russell, who was born in 1965. During this time, he was dubbed Public Enemy Number One by Scotland Yard. When he was finally caught, he was forced to continue his 23-year sentence until being paroled in 1978.\n\nHe married Shirley in 1972, but they divorced before he was paroled. Russell followed in his footsteps and became an armed robber and prison escapee himself.\n\nHis 1980 memoir, which he also wrote the screenplay for, covers a few months of his time in prison instead of of his entire life up to that point. The first half of the film is set in Durham and focuses on the relationships between inmates and prison officials, his plotting to escape, and his successful break.\n\nThe second half depicts him on the run in London, during which he plans to start a new crime-free life in Canada with his family. This plan doesn’t come to fruition, however, as he can’t fund it without more crime. He’s busted by the cops after a so-called friend squeals.\n\nMr. McVicar returns to prison and has more years pasted onto his sentence. While behind bars, he studies for a bachelor’s degree in sociology and is later released.\n\nThe film première was at Rialto Cinema in London’s Leicester Square on 27 August 1980. It was produced by Bill Curbishley (The Who’s manager) and Roy Baird, and was nominated for Best Picture in 1981 at the International Mystery Film Festival of Cattolica.\n\nThe soundtrack reached #22 in the U.S., #39 in the U.K., #41 in The Netherlands, #44 in New Zealand, and #87 in Australia. Richard Evans designed the sleeve, and David James did the photography.\n\nTrack listing:\n\n“Bitter and Twisted” (written by Steve Swindells)\n\n“Just a Dream Away” (Russ Ballard)\n\n“Escape, Part One” (Jeff Wayne) (instrumental)\n\n“White City Lights” (Billy Nicholls and Jon Lind)\n\n“Free Me” (Russ Ballard) (#39 in the U.K.; #53 in the U.S.; #66 in Australia)\n\n“My Time Is Gonna Come” (Russ Ballard)\n\n“Waiting for a Friend” (Billy Nicholls) (#104 in the U.S.)\n\n“Escape, Part Two” (Jeff Wayne) (instrumental)\n\n“Without Your Love” (Billy Nicholls) (#20 in the U.S.; #55 in the U.K.)\n\n“McVicar” (Billy Nicholls)\n\nI love every single song on this album! It’s the perfect place to start with Roger’s solo work, since it sounds so much like a Who album and is such strong material on its own merits. A classic not to be missed.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nOne of the Boys, which I consider perhaps Roger Daltrey’s most criminally underrated solo album that deserved much better success, was recorded from November 1976–March 1977 at The Who’s Ramport Studios in London and Pathé Marconi Studios in Paris. Because of tax complications, the vocals had to be recorded in Paris instead of at home.\n\nThe album has a more eclectic sound and consistently high-quality material because Roger enlisted the help of a larger group of songwriters instead of just one or two main people with their own particular style. He also used a lot more musicians than on his previous two solo albums.\n\nFor the third time in a row, Roger’s cousin Graham Hughes designed and photographed the album art. The cover is modelled after René Magritte’s painting Not to Be Reproduced, which also depicts the subject reflected from the back instead of showing his face.\n\nRoger generously let students from a nearby technical school in the Battersea district film the London recording sessions for an educational project they were doing.\n\nRoger co-wrote three of the songs, his first time since “Here for More” in 1970 he’d done any songwriting. When he puts his mind to it, he’s more than capable of producing a nice tune. His musical calling, however, is obviously singing, which is where he’s chosen to focus his strengths and develop his talents.\n\nOne of the Boys was recorded during a six-month sabbatical from The Who, and Roger felt it would finally establish a coherent musical direction for himself as a solo artist. In a 1977 Rolling Stone interview, he said, “It’s always been difficult for me to do that up till now. I’ve always said that if I wanted to make a rock and roll album I’d do it with The Who, because that’s the finest rock and roll vehicle in the world. It would be pointless to do second-best to that. But there are all kinds of music The Who don’t touch.”\n\nIn that interview, Roger also admitted feeling overwhelmed and inhibited by Pete’s constant, excellent supply of songs, “but a solo album seemed a good opportunity to put my own material to the test.” His prior songs were “Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere” (single; co-written with Pete), “See My Way” (on A Quick One), “Early Morning Cold Taxi” (outtake from The Who Sell Out), and the abovementioned “Here for More” (B-side of “The Seeker”).\n\n“The Prisoner” was inspired by John McVicar, an armed robber and prison escapee whom Roger later portrayed in a 1980 biopic. Roger was so fascinated by his stories of prison life, he bought the film rights to Mr. McVicar’s memoir.\n\nTrack listing, with stars by the bonus tracks:\n\n“Parade” (written by Phillip Goodhand-Tait)\n\n“Single Man’s Dilemma” (Colin Blunstone)\n\n“Avenging Annie” (Andy Pratt) (#88 in the U.S.)\n\n“The Prisoner” (Roger, David Courtney, S.

It’s held up so well over time, and is hands-down one of Roger’s strongest, finest solo albums. Sadly, it wasn’t promoted well enough, and only achieved modest chart success (#45 in the U.K., #46 in the U.S., #80 in Australia). I’d highly recommend it as a great place to start exploring Roger’s solo work.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
