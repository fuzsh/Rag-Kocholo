        "text": "Vocalist Graham Bonnet (Rainbow, MSG, Alcatrazz, Impellitteri) has released a previously unheard album from 1975 as first part of newly launched Graham Bonnet Archive series. Graham Bonnet - Private i - The Archives Vol. One is now available on iTunes and all other major digital media outlets.\n\nBefore there was Rainbow, before there were the solo hits \"Warm Ride\", \"It's All Over Now\" and \"Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow\", Graham had written and recorded his first post-Marbles solo album. Sadly, this album never saw the light of day way back in 1975 for a number of reasons... However 40 years later this has changed.\n\nNewly remastered from the only still existing tape source, Private i contains 12 diverse tracks and shows a side of Graham's voice that many may have never heard.\n\nGraham recalls, \"Those sessions were great fun, and it was exciting to be recording for the first time my own compositions, we had some great people playing on the record, I recall Rick Wakeman was on one track, along with Phillip Goodhand-Tait, oh and my wife at the time (British actress) Adrienne Posta... I played alot of the instruments, as did my producer Kaplin Kaye/\"\n\nPrivate i : The Archives Vol. One tracklisting:\n\n\"Here Comes The Rain\"\n\n\"Snow On Hyde Park (What's This 'Ere Then)\"\n\n\"Private Eye\"\n\n\"Let Me Off This Time / Saturday's Over\"\n\n\"Back-Row In The Stalls\"\n\n\"She May Not Be Much To Look At (But She Sure Does Have A Heart)\"\n\n\"Am I Too Late Now? (Ade's Song)\"\n\n\"Mamma Mine\"\n\n\"Relaxae (Jazz Me)\"\n\n\"Don't Drink The Water\"\n\n\"Dreams (Out In A Forest)\"\n\n\"We're Free\"\n\nGraham Bonnet recently unveiled his new group, the Graham Bonnet Band.\n\nCurrently making preparations for a 2015 tour, the Graham Bonnet Band is a four-piece hard rock outfit that also features guitarist extraordinaire Conrado Pesinato and bassist Beth-Ami Heavenstone. The band will showcase many acclaimed songs spanning Bonnet's illustrious career, plus new compositions from the bandâ€™s forthcoming, as yet untitled, studio album.\n\nBonnet says, ''It has been a while since I last released a full length album, but this band is the perfect group of musicians to do just that. We also are planning on getting out there and performing live all over the world in 2015 and beyond. I am looking forward to seeing all my fans, and with the Graham Bonnet Band we will be playing the songs you all want to hear the way you know them, plus some of the new material we are currently working on, which fits in very well with the classic tracks!''"
