        "text": "The twentieth century saw a revival of interest in John Wesley as a theologian, but whereas the standard treatments of his theology have arranged his thought in the customary shape of Systematic Theologies, this article takes the shape of Wesley’s theology from the way he arranged and prioritized his doctrines pastorally in his Standard Sermons. This demonstrates that he began with the evangelical doctrine of the Reformation on Justification and the Atonement (focusing on Christ), understood regeneration and assurance in relation to the Holy Spirit, and saw the sovereign grace of God the Father as extending to ‘all his works’. The underlying structure is Trinitarian. His much misunderstood doctrine of ‘perfection’ was inherited from the Fathers and was his most creative contribution to Evangelical theology, but needs further development and clarification. 254 • EQ Thomas A. Noble sectarianism. It needs to be developed in a fully Trinitarian way so that the living experience of ‘real...\n\nWesley was the rock from which Methodism was hewn but is now widely disregarded and his debt to the early Church dismissed. But his contemporaries recognised this debt. By 'the early Church' he meant the first three centuries, and believed Constantine to be a disaster for the Church. Methodism, oppressed by the English Establishment, identified with the Church of the Martyrs as did the Celtic Church in its day, having been persuaded to do so by Victricius who greatly influenced St Ninian and St Patrick. Wesley appealed to the early Church in three areas: 1) His Theology which was based on the Fathers while accepting the Bible as supreme. He saw doctrine formulated after Nicaea as suspect e.g. on the Trinity. He rejected Augustine and the predestination theory of Calvin derived from Augustine, but approved of Pelagius, who was inspired by Origen, and his demand for Christian perfection. He rejected Luther's belief in salvation by faith alone in favour of the eastern Church's emphasis on sanctification and the monastic ideal of perfection which was supported by the Celtic Church. 2) Church Practices. These were consciously derived from the early Church. They were radical and offended the formal Church hierarchy but Wesley championed them and the role of the laity. He revived a lay apostolate and defended the miraculous charismata of the early Church. 3) The Ordained Ministry. Wesley's study of the early Church made him abandon his High Church belief in the need for episcopal ordination and adopt a largely Presbyterian form of Church governance. He adopted the early Church view, as did the Celtic Church, that presbyters and bishops were essentially the same order. In conclusion, Wesley's theology, his Church practices and his view of the clergy meant that Methodism was neither Protestant nor Catholic. He criticised both movements but in effect he adopted the best of them and so avoided a conflict between therm. Wesley remains the rock from which Methodism is hewn and the source of its DNA.\n\nMethodism is a religious movement that goes back to John Wesley in part and to Charles Wesley to some extent. As a consequence of these two brothers who witnessed the early expansion of revitalization against great opposition, the Methodism and Evangelical Revival developed in 1781-1791 and Methodism became a separate denomination. The profundity of the theological aspect of the mystery of Wesley's doctrinal and Mission-logical way of thought has never been completely recognized. A basic assumption here is that profound God personal experiences and formative theological perspectives constantly coexist and shape one another. Wesley recognized and comprehended this. He did not seek an experience of God without a substantive theological framework, nor did he fancy a simpler theological framework that was separate or separable from the aspect of experiencing God. He sought a religious context that conveyed this feeling and developed it. Online Survey method was used in the study to determine the significance of Wesleyan theology in modern African Methodism, the research aimed at theological experts and leaders from diverse African Methodist congregations, the convenience sampling approach was used in the study to choose a sample of 10 respondents from the intended population, the primary data was gathered using online questionnaires, which collected both qualitative and quantitative information from respondents. Secondary data on Wesleyan theology was obtained through the study's use of online publications and books, the material gathered served as the conceptual foundation for the significance of Wesleyan theology in modern African Methodism, which validated the findings. The study found startling developments in modern Methodist theology in the rethinking of John Wesley theology, by leading Methodist and Wesleyan theologians, who found his work to be educative, challenging and encouraging in their examination on theology. Such a comprehensive and intentional discussion by Wesleyan theologians is uncommon in this century, and far rarer in the previous century than is widely assumed. This study tries to incorporate the Wesleyan theology in unifying Methodism in Africa, as well as to examine and resolve many difficulties confronting Methodism in Africa, and to evoke it in awakening spirituality in contemporary African Methodism.\n\n1. Why did Wesley not opt for a respectable and cal m cademic life? Although Wesley oscillated between a contemplative life and an acti ve life, the latter characterized his existence. He and his brother were threatened by an int ernal and individualistic mystic but, after being advised by “a serious man”, he chose fo r a “social religion”, “the only religion the Bible knows”. Since then they understood that f aith can be “a comprehensive practice” and theology is better as “practical Christia nity”. The Wesleyan spirituality is essentially modern, and “life” is active life ( vita activa). It was the existential uneasiness that led him to a situation that could not be purely sat isfied neither by the academic life nor the contemplative life. Faith becomes a vital strug gle. It was not a question of intellectual dissatisfaction for him. According to Wesley, the i ssue touches the practical life, the concrete life, the life that needs to be transformed. This was a concern that went ag..."
