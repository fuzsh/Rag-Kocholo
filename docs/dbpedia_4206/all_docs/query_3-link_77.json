        "text": "author:\n\nArray\n\nJade interview with Marianne Segal\n\nJade released only one LP back in the early\n\n70s, which is now considered as one of the pillars of British folk music right up\n\nthere with Fairport Convention. Marianne Segal explained the whole story of Jade\n\nand project that she was involved with later in her career.\n\nThank\n\nyou for taking your time, Marianne. How did your musical path begin?\n\nHello, it’s a pleasure to be interviewed\n\nfor Psychedelic Baby Magazine.\n\nI was very interested in music from a very\n\nyoung age and I listened to the songs of the 50s & 60s era and was a\n\nparticular fan of the early Rolling Stones. In 1964 when I was around 16 years\n\nold, I saved up for my first guitar and was introduced to the sounds of Bob\n\nDylan by a fellow guitarist. On hearing\n\nDylan’s songs for the first time I was spurred on to learn to play and sing\n\nthese songs and this then introduced me to some of the traditional ballads\n\nrecorded by Joan Baez and then onto listening to other folk artists.\n\nAround this time some local friends were\n\nforming their first Band and they asked me to be their singer. It was just a fun situation, but it gave me\n\nthe experience of working with a group. Our drummer was Danny Kirwan. Danny\n\nwanted to learn the guitar and so borrowed mine. It was clear that he wanted to\n\nswitch from drums to guitar and he was such a natural player. We all went our separate ways, but an excited\n\nDanny came to see me at The Nags Head folk club in Battersea when Jade was just\n\nstarting out in 1970, to tell me he was joining Fleetwood Mac.\n\nI\n\nwent on to form a duo in 1966 with a guitarist, Malcolm Laws and we played in\n\nour first folk club. That night I was signed up for management by the club\n\norganisers, Dave Jones & Colin Deacon and became a regular singer at this\n\nclub – ‘The Nags Head’ in Battersea, London, a folk & blues club. I was\n\nfortunate to then meet and hear many fine artists play at this club over the\n\nmonths, such as Shirley Collins, Gerry Lockran, Dave & Toni Arthur, The\n\nBracken, Don Shepherd and so many others.\n\nDave & Colin then urged me to begin\n\nsongwriting and this was the push that got me writing in 1967.\n\nAfter working for a while in The Nags Head\n\nFolk Club as a regular weekly singer and also doing my first concert at\n\nBattersea Town Hall, London, with Alex Campbell and Black Cat Bones, I also\n\nbegan to get bookings in other folk clubs, spreading my wings a little further\n\nafield and this is how I then came to meet Dave Waite.\n\nMarianne’s first photo shoot ever at\n\nClapham Junction railway station, London\n\nWhere have you and Dave Waite met?\n\nWe met at a folk club called ‘The Anglers’\n\nin Teddington in Surrey in 1967. Dave talked to me after my set, expressing an\n\ninterest to work as a duo. This idea interested me, having previously worked as\n\na duo with Malcolm Laws. So Dave and I\n\npretty much began rehearsals immediately, sorting out a set of songs. Dave had\n\nmade records and had done radio and television, and had had a hit record with a\n\ngroup called, ‘The Countrymen’, so he had a very professional approach because\n\nof these experiences and he taught me a lot in the early days.\n\nDave & Marian 1968\n\nSo around 1968 you formed a folk duo. What was some of the repertoire and where\n\nand with who did you play?\n\nOur sound was a fusion of English and\n\nAmerican contemporary folk artists. We sang songs by Randy Newman, Bob Dylan, The\n\nIncredible String Band, Jacques Brel, Allan Sherman, Ralph Mc Tell, Phil Ochs,\n\nTom Paxton, Buffy Sainte Marie, Mimi & Richard Farina. I then began to include some of my own songs\n\nin our set and from there on, over the months we did mainly original songs with\n\na few covers. We then went with folk agent, Sandy Glennon who helped us\n\nestablish ourselves in the folk clubs all over the country.\n\nBecause of Dave’s previous connections from\n\nwork with The Countrymen, we did a lot of television and radio spots over a\n\nperiod of 2 years and worked with people such as, The Settlers, The Strawberry\n\nHill Boys ( later to become The Strawbs,) The Foggy Duo, Ian Matthew’s Southern\n\nComfort, Johnny Silvo, Alex Campbell.\n\nOther artists we worked with were, Ralph Mc Tell, Sandy Denny, Bert\n\nJansch, Cliff Aungier, Noel Murphy, Derek Brimstone, The Strawbs, Ian Mc Cann,\n\nJeremy Taylor. We also did a few spots\n\nfor ‘Country meets Folk’ for the BBC Radio.\n\nWhat would you say influenced you?\n\nI\n\nfeel that all of my contemporaries and influential recording artists of this\n\nera had some influence on me one way or another – all for different reasons. It\n\ncould be the cutting edge poetry of Bob Dylan songs, the feel the songs of\n\nRichard & Mimi Farina, the sound of the voice of Buffy Sainte Marie &\n\nher passionate, expressive, story telling songs, the intimacy created by Joni\n\nMitchell by her words & music, the soaring voices of Joan Baez and Judy\n\nCollins and also the writing of Tim Buckley, Tom Paxton – I feel I somehow took\n\na little something with me from everything I heard, or any live performances I\n\nsaw.\n\nThere was a whole batch of tapes uncovered that contained recordings by\n\nyou two, recorded while you were a duo between early summer 1968 and the\n\nsummer of 1970. This came out in 2004 titled ‘Paper Flowers’. Can you tell me,\n\nwhat’s the story behind these lost recordings?\n\nYes, some of this material was simply\n\nrecorded at home around one microphone onto a tape recorder and other tracks\n\nwere recorded in demo studios or master recordings.\n\nRichard Allen who had already contacted me\n\nin 2002 with an interest to re issue the Jade album ‘Fly on Strangewings’, also\n\nexpressed an interest to put out the earlier tracks of Dave and myself onto an\n\nalbum. So I transferred as many of the\n\nsongs as I could from the reel-to-reel tapes onto digital at RMS Studios.\n\nRichard chose the songs and the album was put together and called: ‘Paper\n\nFlowers’. Some of the reels had to be professionally baked before we could run\n\nthem, as they were deteriorating.\n\nI\n\nbelieve the reincarnation into Jade began in 1970, when you added a session\n\nmusician Rod Edwards and started working on your new project called “Fly\n\non Strangewings”. What’s the story behind it?\n\nYes, in late 1969, Dave and I were\n\nintroduced by our folk agent, Sandy Glennon to Jon Miller. Jon was already\n\nquite established in management, publishing and as a booking agent and was in\n\npartnership with Dick James who had previously signed up the Beatles for\n\npublishing. Their aim was to sign up new British acts and they signed up ‘Elton\n\nJohn & Bernie Taupin, Phillip Goodhand-Tait, Hookfoot and Edward Woodward.\n\nJon organized a demo recording session of some of my songs and from there I was\n\nsigned to Dick James Music for publishing and recording. The incarnation into a\n\nthree-piece called ‘Jade’ was inspired by Jon Miller (who had by now become our\n\nmanager.) Jon introduced us to his friend Rod Edwards who played Keyboards and\n\nbass. Rod was part of a duo called ‘Piccadilly Line’. Rod, Dave & I started\n\nrehearsals of the songs that were being considered for the album and we got\n\nready to go into the studio. The ‘Jade’ album, ‘Fly On Strangewings’ was then\n\nrecorded at Trident Studios In London in March of 1970. Things did move forward\n\npretty quickly at this stage.\n\nWhy did you decide to change your name\n\ninto Jade and did you have any concept in mind while recording this LP?\n\nJon Miller came up with the name ‘Jade’ for\n\nthe new trio. Regarding the ‘sound’ for\n\nthe album, Jon felt that Dave and I needed a heavier, more rock-based sound,\n\nmoving away from the acoustic harmony folk sound that we had. Using the original demo recordings that Dave\n\nand I had recently made as the starting place to go from, and with the addition\n\nof Rod’s keyboard’s and vocal harmonies things began to shape up into a new\n\nsound for us. Adding the session musicians that Jon had chosen for the\n\nrecordings, we began to get the rockier sound that Jon wanted on particular\n\ntracks. The musicians were, Pete Sears (Les Fleurs de Lys, Sam Gopal’s -Dream,\n\nSilver Metre, Jefferson Starship), Michael Rosen (Eclection), Pete York\n\n(Spencer Davis Group, Hardin & York), Clem Cattini (The Tornadoes, The Ivy\n\nLeague, Rumplestiltskin), Terry Cox (Pentangle), Mick Waller (Steampacket, Rod\n\nStewart, Silver Metre) and James Litherland (Colosseum, Mogul Thrash). There\n\nwas a lot of inspirational playing – affecting and adding to the concept as we\n\nwent along.\n\nWhat are perhaps some of the strongest\n\nmemories from producing and recording the LP?\n\nFor\n\nme, I would say the discipline – the early mornings – getting up to travel from\n\nsouth London to the studio and keeping the concentration and focus to achieve\n\nas much as I possibly could each day. I\n\nfelt that expectations were high, we had a set time booked to record the album\n\nand I wanted to achieve all that we hoped for in that time and come out with a\n\ngood result.\n\nJade recording the album at Trident 1970\n\nTrident Studios had a great atmosphere, I\n\nenjoyed working there. It was all new ground to me. I had only worked in small\n\ndemo studios before – so I was a bit in awe of my situation at first.\n\nMeeting and working with such great\n\nmusicians on the sessions. Other people dropped by the studio to see us – I\n\nremember John Martin and Doris Henderson.\n\nWe would appreciate if you could comment\n\neach song from the LP a bit.\n\nA1\n\nAmongst Anemones\n\nThis song reflects my love of the sea and\n\nmy love of nature which has always been strong in my life.\n\nA2\n\nRaven\n\nA song about a relationship that could not\n\nbe – sung from both of the would-be lover’s perspectives; so as if a two-way\n\nconversation.\n\nA3\n\nFly on Strangewings\n\nLiving and learning about life without the\n\nperson you would wish to be with – unable to share experiences together.\n\nA4\n\nMayfly\n\nThe\n\nmayfly only lives for only 24 hours after leaving the water in its previous\n\nlava state. I felt I should write a song about it.\n\nA5\n\nAlan’s Song\n\nA song about a dear friend who was killed\n\non his motorbike – we grew up together.\n\nA6\n\nBad Magic\n\nI cannot\n\nsay for sure how or why I wrote this song. I have always been interested in\n\nmystery and magic. This song was just ‘a happening’ at the time.\n\nB1\n\nClippership\n\nSitting on the tube traveling on my way to\n\none of the Jade recording sessions, I saw a painting of a Clipper Ship on the\n\ntube adverts. I wrote the song in my head on the way to the studio and later\n\nasked Jon Miller and Rod and Dave if we might include it on the album. We did\n\nneed an extra up-tempo track and so it was agreed.\n\nB2\n\nFive of Us\n\nFive of us stayed at a cottage in Norfolk\n\nin the UK. We were all around 16 years old. It turned out to be an exciting\n\ntime, a lot of freedom, fresh air and fun away from the city streets of London\n\nand it also included a little spooky happening which did seriously did fill us\n\nfull of fear.\n\nB3\n\nReflections on a Harbour Wall\n\nI wrote this song whilst visiting Hastings\n\nin Sussex UK. I sat against a wall looking overlooking the beach with my pencil\n\nand paper – Again, my love of the sea. I often think about the words to this\n\nsong now, as I walk the beach were I presently live.\n\nB4\n\nMrs. Adams\n\nThis is a story about an elderly friend\n\n& neighbour who had passed away. I was young and it was a significant time\n\nfor me.\n\nB5\n\nFly Me to the North\n\nI\n\nwrote ‘Fly Me to The North’ in the living room of my family home, one quiet\n\nSunday. It’s a personal letter, about wanting to escape. It was written at an\n\nearly point in my career. The song has since been covered by other recording\n\nartists including Rod McKuen, John and Mary from 10,000 Maniacs and the Back\n\nAlley Choir. Rod Mc Kuen acknowledged this song at The Royal Albert Hall during\n\nhis concert there. This was a very special moment in time for me.\n\nB6\n\nAway from the Family\n\nThis\n\nis a song about the fire of youth and wanting to get out into the world to\n\nexplore it.\n\nLater you were joined by John Wetton\n\nand went on a tour…\n\nYes,\n\nJohn Wetton came out to L.A. to join us for our booking at ‘The Troubadour’ in\n\nL.A. It was a spur of the moment decision instigated by Jon & John Wetton.\n\nThe set went well. Afterwards, Brian Wilson came back stage to see us and\n\nlater, Joni Mitchell and her manager came over to say hello.\n\nMarianne in New York 1971 playing with Jade\n\nat The Bitter End Club\n\nWhat’s the story about The Marianne Segal\n\nBand? You were active until 1975 and were quite unique with playing complete\n\nsets of contemporary songs and using electric instruments within the old-school\n\ntraditional folk club environment.\n\nYes,\n\nI believe we were initially somewhat unique playing in the folk clubs with\n\nelectric instruments in the early 1970s.\n\nAt first some of our audiences seemed shocked that we were bringing in\n\namps and drums, but we did always win them over with our music and were re\n\nbooked. We adjusted the sound level of our music to suit each small room, so it\n\nwasn’t too loud. I think that we were one of the first folk Bands to go\n\nelectric in these smaller folk clubs. I instigated this because I wanted the\n\nfolk-rock feel.\n\nDave Waite and I formed ‘The Marianne Segal\n\nBand’ very quickly after Jade broke up. We decided to carry on where we left\n\noff with Jade and advertised for a bass player and found Lee Oliphant from\n\nCanada. Colin Edmonds joined us for a while, playing percussion, then Dave\n\nMorris joined us on drums and as you say, we were active until around 1975.\n\nThis Band got on very well together, we were very close.\n\nJust as Dave and I, and then Jade, had\n\nbuilt up large audience followings, so did The Marianne Segal Band. We were\n\nalways working in the folk clubs and Universities and we also did a six week\n\ntelevision series with Sidney Carter. When Capitol Radio started out, we were\n\nbooked quite often for the all night live show with Robbie Barrish and Sarah\n\nWard. We did a small tour of clubs in Europe and also toured with Labbi Siffre\n\n& Peter Sarstedt in the UK.\n\nBy\n\n1975, some of the previous folk venues were closing down due to overall\n\naudiences not attending so much. There was a recession around this time and\n\npower cuts. Some clubs then began to run monthly instead of weekly and this\n\nmeant that fewer artists were booked at clubs, creating less opportunity for\n\ngigs overall. The work just wasn’t there\n\nas before and it was difficult for us to carry on financially without taking\n\nother work. We did take a residency at a pub in Battersea called the Swan, to\n\nhelp matters, but shortly after this we amicably said our goodbyes.\n\nWhat happened after that and what\n\ncurrently occupies your life?\n\nThis\n\nera from 1975 onwards was changeable, fragmented. It was never to be quite the\n\nsame as it had been before with Dave Waite and with Jade, or with the M.S.\n\nBand. I felt I was now ‘out on a limb’.\n\nI had no plans, no management and no Band, and initially I felt\n\nvulnerable and unprotected. Punk music was beginning to filter into mainstream\n\nand folk music was slipping under the radar.\n\nIn late 1975 I began to record demos with\n\nJulian Mendelsohn in a small studio in Fulham called Milner Sound. Julian\n\nwas/is such a talented engineer and producer who went on later to work with\n\nKate Bush & The Pet Shop Boys, Level 42 and many others. Julian helped me\n\nform a new Band which we rehearsed at this studio. It was difficult to get to\n\ngrips with this Band idea simply because we had such great musicians in it and\n\nthey all had to go off and tour or record with other main stream artists. So it\n\nnever settled into something tangible – but it was exciting. Some of the\n\nmusicians that were with us for a while were, Root Cartwright, Pete York, Andy\n\nSummers, Joe Gillingham, Eddie Hardin and Paul Karus, Simon Nicol, Eric\n\nDillon. We also recorded 3 rock tracks\n\nwith James Litherland, Billy Smith and John Dentith. They were very happy\n\ntimes. At a later stage after concentrating on recording new songs for a while,\n\nwe finally did form a Band of musicians who were very dedicated to staying\n\ntogether and rehearsing. These musicians were: Root Cartwright (Principle\n\nEdwards Magic Theatre), Dennis O’ Brien (keyboards), Simon Byrne (drums), Ian\n\nFordham (bass) and Dave Waite (guitar). We couldn’t get management to help us\n\nand I feel that I lost heart then and so just concentrated on writing and\n\nrecording. I also wrote specifically for other singers for a while – being\n\nasked to submit songs for Suzie Quatro and also songs for Kiki Dee. I did\n\nbacking vocals for other writers.\n\nDuring 1976 I signed to Jeff Wayne (War of\n\nthe Worlds, David Essex) for publishing and we did 3 recordings produced by\n\nJeff. Jeff wanted to get ‘The Four Tops’ for backing vocals on one of my\n\ntracks. He was then told about a group who were gigging in the north of England\n\ncalled, ‘The Real Thing’. They were not very well known at this time. He got\n\nthem down to record with us and from there Jeff worked further with them –\n\nlater of course they had hit records.\n\nDuring\n\n1976/77 I did vocals on quite a few television and radio jingles and I also did\n\na voice over on a T.V. film with David Essex.\n\nMy daughter was born in 1978 and I got a\n\nresidency in a local wine bar singing, enabling me to keep live work going\n\nwhilst having a young baby. In 1979\n\nJonathan Rowlands (publisher, record producer and manager) arranged some master\n\nrecordings at Sarm studios to record three songs of mine that he particularly\n\nliked. It was a great session with Dave Mattocks on drums, Julian Mendelsohn\n\nengineering and Neil Harrison Producing the tracks.\n\nJonathan Rowlands also introduced me to\n\nEugene Moule, a song writer and producer. Eugene\n\nand I then I did a quite a lot of recording\n\ntogether and some songwriting. I sang\n\nvocals for his songs and in turn he produced some recordings of my songs. It\n\nwas a keyboards – based sound as this was the early 1980’s. I was fortunate to\n\nrecord in Abbey Round studios with Eugene and Jonathan. In 1980 I had a single\n\ndeal with ‘Dave Dee Records’ (Dave of, Dave, Dozy, Mick and Titch.) I recorded\n\n2 tracks with Eugene Moule for this deal.\n\nI recorded these under the name of ‘Marianne Chase’. Zabadak Magazine\n\n(Ron Cooper) has a great history of Dave Dee’s productions.\n\nAround 1986 I met Graeme Taylor (Albion\n\nBand, The Home Service). We initially worked in a local Band together and later\n\nbegan recording together. This has continued on to date – work seems to bring\n\nus together every so often. We did some folk festivals and also worked with\n\n‘The Strawbs’. We got together with Laurie Harper from Pywackett and started\n\nsome rehearsals with a view to doing some gigs. I did a one-off gig with The\n\nHome Service at The Half Moon in Putney in 1994.\n\nMarianne, Graeme Taylor, Laurie Harper\n\nAround 1987 I did a one-off wine bar gig\n\nwith Root Cartwright (lead guitar) and Josh Kirby (bass) – I played piano and\n\nwe did rock numbers. Root and Josh enjoyed the gig and they suggested that we\n\nformed a Band. We had various drummers over the year we rehearsed, including\n\nRobbie France. It was a very, very exciting Band, but we couldn’t get\n\nmanagement and all of our equipment was stolen from the van. I think we just\n\ngave up. We lost the momentum. It happens!\n\nIn 1989 I was also introduced by Graeme\n\nTaylor to an English folk dance Band (The Aldbrickham Band, based in Reading I\n\nthe UK.) I did lead vocals for them for a musical which was based on the life\n\nof Vincent Van Gogh and to follow they then asked me to join them as their\n\nrhythm guitarist and singer at some of their bigger gigs. Twenty years later, I\n\nstill play a few gigs each year with them – we are all a close bunch really.\n\nIn 2003, I approached Richard Allen to help\n\nme get some bookings. The Aldbrickham Band was prepared to do live work with me\n\non a new project which would be the Jade material.\n\nMarianne with The Aldbrickham Band circa\n\n2000\n\nRichard felt that Jade\n\nshould reform! With the help of Richard Allen and Jon Miller, there was a Jade\n\nreunion in 2004 of the original Jade line-up and we did a one-off gig in\n\nLondon. James Litherland (who had played on the original Jade album) joined us,\n\nwith Mick Paul on bass, Michael Sanderson (Aldbrickham Band) on violin &\n\nvocals and Dave Morgan on drums. We had\n\nmany, new young fans in the audience who knew the songs on the album, which\n\nreally surprised me, as well as some of our older fans. In the audience was\n\nDerek Love, the very person who had introduced me to Bob Dylan recordings in\n\n1964.\n\nAlso at this time, 2004, Richard Allen had\n\nintroduced me to Michael Tyack from the Band, ‘Circulus’. Michael had been\n\ninspired by some of the songs on the Jade album and he asked me to do a track\n\nwith them on their new album, ‘The Lick on the Tip of an Envelope yet to be\n\nSent’ and chose one of my songs called, ‘Swallow’.\n\nJade reunion 2004\n\nIn\n\n2006 Michael Tyack and I began looking at some of my material in preparation\n\nfor a new solo album that I felt I wanted to make. So in 2007 we went ahead and\n\nrecorded it. The album featured Circulus and some other great musicians\n\nincluding Root Cartwright, Bill Steer, Amy May, Lo Polidoro & Mike Porter.\n\nI called the album, ‘The Gathering’ we recorded at RMS Studios in Norwood with\n\nAndy Le Vien and at Catt Studio in Surrey with Ian Catt. (Studios I’ve worked\n\nin over the last 20 years). We ran some instruments through valve amps to get\n\nthe 70s sound. This album was critically acclaimed by ‘Mojo magazine’.\n\nThere was some live work with Graeme Taylor\n\nin 2006 and also some recordings together.\n\nIn 2010 I put out an album of archive\n\ntracks called, ‘Gypsy Girl’.\n\nIn 2011, I was contacted by Judy Dyble\n\n(early Fairport) to let me know that she was putting one of my songs on her new\n\nalbum. It had been recorded in the 70s. It was a great surprise and a nice\n\nhappening.\n\nCurrently, I continue to write and am in\n\ntouch with various musician friends.\n\nAny future plans?\n\nYes, I’ll be meeting with Graeme Taylor\n\nwith a view to putting out an album of tracks we recorded over the years\n\ntogether. We may well do a couple of new recordings for this album.\n\nI will also be recording a track on The\n\nAldbrickham Band’s new album – a version of the traditional song, ‘The Water is\n\nWide’.\n\nI believe that there will be a re issue of\n\nthe Jade album this year and I plan to look into the archives tapes to find a\n\nbonus track for this.\n\nThanks again for taking your time.\n\nWould you like to send a message to our readers?\n\nYes, thank you for reading this article.\n\nWriting it gave me the opportunity to look back again in detail and I’ve\n\nenjoyed the journey – thank you.\n\nBest wishes, Marianne Segal\n\nInterview made by Klemen Breznikar/2013\n\n© Copyright\n\nhttp://psychedelicbaby.blogspot.com/2013"
