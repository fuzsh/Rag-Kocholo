        "text": "Musical artist\n\nPhillip Goodhand-Tait (born 3 January 1945)[1] is an English singer-songwriter, record producer and keyboard player.\n\nLife and career\n\n[edit]\n\nGoodhand-Tait was born in Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire.[1] Known as Phil Tait in his school years, his mother was a piano teacher and his father was involved in trade unions. Goodhand-Tait began his music career shortly after the family moved to Guildford, Surrey, in 1957. His first group, Phill Tone and the Vibrants, was renamed Phill and the Stormsville Shakers in 1961. The band included Paul Demers on drums, Ivor Shackleton on guitar, and Kirk Riddle on bass.[1]\n\nBy 1966, the same year the group released its first singles, the Stormsville Shakers's lineup included Tait, Riddle, Ian Jelfs on guitar, David Sherrington on tenor sax, and Alan Bunn on drums. That same year, Mel Collins was recruited on second tenor sax. In 1967, the band's name changed to Circus, releasing further singles sides. January 1969 saw Goodhand-Tait exit the group to pursue a solo career, leaving Jelfs, Collins, Riddle, and new drummer Chris Burrows to write, record and release the self-titled pop-jazz album Circus, after which they disbanded in 1970.\n\nGoodhand-Tait wrote and recorded songs that have been covered by Roger Daltrey (\"Oceans Away\", \"Parade\", and \"Leon\"), Euson (\"Leon\"), Gene Pitney (\"You Are\" and \"Oceans Away\"), Zoot Money (\"No One But You\"), and Love Affair (\"Bringing on Back the Good Times\", \"A Day Without Love\", \"Lincoln County\", \"One Road\" and \"Baby I Know\").[1]\n\nIn 1971, Goodhand-Tait wrote the soundtrack for the film Universal Soldier. In 1976, he played the harmonium on Chris De Burgh's album, Spanish Train and Other Stories.[2]\n\nGoodhand-Tait has also produced live albums by Magnum, Venom, Climax Blues Band, Kid Creole and the Coconuts and The Lords of the New Church.[1]\n\nIn 2021, Goodhand-Tait's DJM output was released on CD for the first time in the UK, after being out of print for many years. The box set, titled Gone Are The Songs of Yesterday and released by Cherry Red Records, includes Rehearsal, I Think I'll Write a Song, Songfall, and Phillip Goodhand-Tait as well as bonus material including singles, B-sides, and previously unreleased songs featured in Universal Soldier. The albums concurrently made their debut on streaming platforms such as Spotify.
