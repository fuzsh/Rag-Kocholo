Peggy Lee: Live in London is the title of the new 4-CD box set due on December 4 containing the soulful songstress' 1977 studio album Peggy; the concert album Live in London recorded at the famous Palladium on March 13, 1977; an entire disc of previously unreleased material including studio outtakes, rehearsal takes and the March 20 Palladium show; and a DVD of the\n\nI Know There's Gonna Be (Good Times): Ted's Big Summer '15 Wrap-Up!\n\nThe summer's winding down and so Ted Frank, our resident maven of all things eclectic, is looking back on his favorites from the past few months, from reissues to future classics of all genres! We hope you make some new discoveries as you enjoy the Labor Day weekend! As the boys of summer's mettle is currently being put to the test, here are some favorite releases - new and old - from the past couple of summer months that have staying power and could perfectly score those few remaining\n\nA Stroke Of Luck: Garbage Celebrates 20 Years With Deluxe, Expanded Reissues\n\nAlt-rock heroes Garbage are going \"20 Years Queer\" with a multi-tiered reissue of their 1995 debut album and an accompanying tour. Formed by Scottish vocalist Shirley Manson, guitarists Steve Marker and Duke Erikson and drummer Butch Vig (the latter also a producer best known for Nirvana's Nevermind), Garbage fused grunge, industrial and electronic influences for a sound that stood out on mid-'90s radio. Manson's distinctive vocals propelled \"Only Happy When It Rains,\" \"Queer\" and \"Stupid\n\nReview: \"Groove and Grind: Rare Soul '63-'73\"\n\nGot a few spare hours? You'll definitely want to put some time aside for a new box set that just might get you up and dancing... The four packed CDs comprising RockBeat Records' Groove and Grind: Rare Soul '63-'73 (ROC-CD-3255)- that's 112 songs, most of which have never previously appeared on CD - add up to one of the most exhaustive rare soul archives in the CD era, and one which you'll want to spend hours and hours exploring. As accompanied by a 112-page book with Bill Dahl's copious,\n\nWE HAVE OUR WINNERS: NICOLETTE LARSON \"LOTTA LOVE\" GIVEAWAY!\n\nCONGRATULATIONS!

Robert Lamm, Peter Cetera, Terry Kath, Danny Seraphine, Lee Loughnane, James Pankow and Walter Parazaider - released its first album on Columbia Records. 46 years and a total of 36 core albums later, the band simply known as Chicago is still intact with Lamm, Loughnane, Pankow and Parazaider. In the waning days of 1971, another band made its first appearance on records. America - the trio of Gerry Beckley, Dewey Bunnell and Dan Peek -\n\nRelease Round-Up: Week of August 28\n\nWelcome to New Release Friday and this week's Release Round-Up! Faces, You Can Make Me Dance, Sing or Anything (1970-1975) (Rhino) CD: Amazon U.S. / Amazon U.K. Vinyl: Amazon U.S. / Amazon U.K. This long-awaited 5-CD box set includes Faces' First Step (1970), Long Player (1971), A Nod Is as Good as a Wink...to a Blind Horse (1971), and Ooh La La (1973), and adds never-before-released bonus tracks to each album. The set is topped off with a bonus disc containing non-LP selections.\n\nOmnivore Uncovers The Lost Soul of Carl Hall\n\nEven the most diehard soul connoisseurs can be forgiven for not knowing the name of Carl Hall. After all, he left behind just a handful of singles on labels including Mercury, Loma, Atlantic and Columbia before focusing on a stage career. But thanks to Omnivore's recent release of You Don't Know Nothing About Love: The Loma/Atlantic Recordings 1967-1972, it's highly unlikely that you'll forget the name, and sound, of Carl Hall. Distinguished by both his intensity and his stratospheric vocal\n\nYou Oughta Know: Rhino Celebrates 20th Anniversary of Alanis Morissette's \"Jagged Little Pill\" with 4-CD Box\n\nThis October, Rhino is celebrating one of the biggest albums of the 1990s: Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill. To commemorate the album's 20th anniversary, a newly remastered 4-CD Collector's Edition and 2-CD Deluxe edition will be released on October 30. Alanis Morissette's first two albums did not indicate the direction her music would take for her biggest smash record. Released on MCA in her native Canada, 1991's Alanis and 1992's Now is the Time had critics comparing her to Debbie\n\nRelease Round-Up: Week of August 21\n\nWelcome to this week's Release Round-Up, packed with box sets, reissues, special collections, and more! The Isley Brothers, The RCA Victor and T-Neck Album Masters (Legacy) (Amazon U.S. / Amazon U.K.) Legacy has boxed up 23 discs of The Isley Brothers - featuring every one of the group's RCA and T-Neck albums released between 1959 and 1983, including one previously unreleased album and a total of 84 previously unissued or new-to-CD bonus tracks! Every track has been newly-remastered\n\nChristmas Joy: Real Gone Kicks off the Holidays with Four Seasons and More in October\n\nIt may be hard to believe, but the holiday season will be here sooner than we think! To prove that point, Real Gone Music is getting Christmas started early with its October slate of releases featuring five yuletide gems along with three titles good for year-round enjoyment. This batch of Christmas classics kicks off with the 4 Seasons' The 4 Seasons Greetings, continuing Real Gone's series of mono Seasons reissues which began in September. Next, you've got holiday tunes from crooner and\n\nLet's Go Disco: Big Break Gets Down With MFSB's \"Universal Love\"\n\nBig Break Records is letting the love come through - Universal Love, that is! - with its new reissue of the third album from Philadelphia International Records' inimitable house band, MFSB. The only mystery about the 1975 album is how this No. 2 R&B smash (and respectable No. 44 Pop success, as well) has avoided compact disc release after all these years. Happily, it follows 1972's MFSB and 1973's Love is the Message into Big Break's catalogue in a newly-expanded and remastered\n\nIt's Clobberin' Time! Ace Unearths Gems From Motown's Fantastic Four\n\nLast weekend, The Fantastic Four - the super-powered Reed Richards, Susan Storm, Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm - returned to the big screen, ultimately to disappoint fans. But Ace Records' Kent label has another group of the same name in the spotlight - and this one is bound to thrill! Joe Pruitt, Ralph Pruitt, Toby Childs and James Epps made their debut as The Fantastic Four in 1966 on Detroit's Ric-Tic label, notching a series of R&B and Pop hits (including 1967's No. 6 R&B/No. 63 Pop\n\nPaint With All the Colors of the Wind: Latest Disney Legacy Collection Release Features \"Pocahontas\"\n\nThis past Friday, Walt Disney Records continued its Legacy Collection series. Like the most last release, Toy Story, it celebrates a film marking its 20th anniversary: 1995's Pocahontas. The new 2-CD set features the entire score along with several demos and alternate versions of songs. Pocahontas, Disney's 33rd animated film, was a departure from some of the films in the studio's past repertoire in that is was based on history and not a fairytale. The movie chronicles the story of Native\n\nReview: Simon and Garfunkel, \"The Complete Columbia Albums Collection\" and \"The Concert in Central Park\"\n\nWhen Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel took the stage on April 24, 2010 at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, it's doubtful that many in the audience knew they were witnessing the end of one chapter in the story of Simon & Garfunkel. That concert marked the final time that the famous duo have performed together to date, but over five years later, the specter of Simon & Garfunkel still looms large over both men. It's no surprise; the question of a reunion cropped up almost\n\nGet Ready to \"Groove and Grind\" on RockBeat's New \"Rare Soul\" Box Set\n\nHot on the heels of its recent Super Rare Doo Wop Box, RockBeat Records is turning its attention to another corner of the rhythm and blues world and further advancing into the 1960s with a new four-CD box set. Groove and Grind: Rare Soul 1963-1973, due in stores on Friday, August 18, is packed with 112 songs - the vast majority of which have never been reissued on CD! Groove and Grind, compiled by RockBeat's James Austin and annotated in its hardcover 127-page book by Bill Dahl, has divided\n\nReview: Various Artists, \"Here Today! The Songs of Brian Wilson\"\n\nThe title of Ace Records' recent collection is Here Today! The Songs of Brian Wilson, after one of those famous Wilson songs off The Beach Boys' 1966 Pet Sounds. But the fact of the matter is - as this enjoyably diverse set proves over the course of its 25 tracks - Brian Wilson's music is not only here today, but will be here for many tomorrows. Unlike Ace's 2003 volume Pet Projects: The Brian Wilson Productions, this anthology concentrates on Brian as songwriter. But there are a couple of\n\nCherry Red's él Label Revisits John Wayne Westerns, Brazil's Elis Regina\n\nCherry Red's él label continues to trawl through the annals of musical nostalgia for a recent pair of releases spotlighting a legendary team of actor and director, and a Brazilian music queen. John Ford/John Wayne: Western Classics celebrates the partnership between director Ford and star Wayne that survived, personally and professionally, for 50 years. Ford was already an established, successful director when he first met USC student Marion Morrison, at the time working a summer job at 20th\n\nChances Are: Legacy Celebrates Johnny Mathis' 80th With New Singles Box Set\n\nHere at Second Disc HQ, the music of Johnny Mathis is, needless to say, very special to us. Johnny inaugurated our Second Disc Records label with the release of Life is a Song Worth Singing: The Complete Thom Bell Sessions. Now, we're thrilled to announce that our friends at Columbia Records and Legacy Recordings are collecting four discs' worth of Mathis Magic on a new box set. On September 25, Columbia and Legacy will celebrate Mr. Mathis turning 80 years young with the release of Johnny\n\nOmnivore's Got The Knack! Three Reissues, Reviewed\n\n\"Pop is dead, bring a shovel!\" So proclaimed The Knack in the acerbic lyric to the opening track of 1998's \"comeback\" album Zoom. Of course, the song proved otherwise, as the years between 1991's Serious Fun and Zoom had been kind to the band, a.k.a. Doug Fieger (lead vocals/rhythm guitar), Prescott Niles (bass) and Berton Averre (lead guitar/keyboards/vocals). Omnivore Recordings has recently reissued Zoom and its follow-up, Normal as the Next Guy, along with 2001's Live from\n\nLet's Hang On! Real Gone Has Four Seasons, Texas Tornados, More in September\n\nWe've already told you about the two September releases from Second Disc Records and Real Gone Music - Wilson Pickett's The Complete RCA Studio Recordings and an expanded edition of Ricci Martin's all-star California rock classic Beached - but we know that you're going to be just as excited about the entire action-packed Real Gone slate! For starters, it's a line-up that's always in season - with new deluxe mono mini-sleeve editions of The 4 Seasons' first two albums for the first time ever\n\nReview: \"The Sound of Music: Original Soundtrack Recording\" on SACD\n\nRCA Victor expected the soundtrack album to 1965's big-screen musical The Sound of Music to be a juggernaut. The label backed the release with a $100,000.00 promotional campaign, and arranged for tie-ins at locales including the New York World's Fair. The release was joined on the label's roster by other albums of the already-famous Rodgers and Hammerstein score in styles from jazz (Gary Burton's The Groovy Sound of Music) to \"easy listening\" (The Living Strings' Music from The Sound of\n\nTake On Me: a-ha's \"Hunting High and Low\" Goes Super Deluxe With New Box Set\n\nIf you set your Wayback Machine to February 1, 2010, you'll find one of The Second Disc's earliest posts - the inaugural Reissue Theory column, dedicated to imagining a 25th anniversary multi-disc edition of a-ha's 1985 debut studio album Hunting High and Low. Well, good things do come to those who wait, because Warner Bros. and Rhino are finally delivering on such a project with the album's upcoming 30th anniversary box set! With 4 CDs and a DVD, this handily bests the 2010 double-CD edition.\n\nHappy in the Morning: Sony Masterworks Reissues Lauren Bacall, Mickey Rooney Musicals and More\n\nLast week, we told you about Masterworks Broadway's search for suggestions of cast albums to reissue on vinyl. This week, the label has just announced three new releases in their ongoing download/CD-R program. The first up on July 17 (this Friday) is the 1957 television cast of Pinocchio starring Mickey Rooney. This is not the Disney musical, but a version of the story featuring music by Alec Wilder and lyrics by William Engvick. It has only been available on CD before by public domain"
