Jack's mother, Mildred, gave birth to him at Newton-Wellesley Hospital, in an elevator. His father, John, was the president of the Doughnut Corporation of America. Lemmon's parents split up when he was 18 years old, but they never officially divorced. Jack studied at John Ward Elementary School and the Rivers School, and he was often ill during his childhood. By the time Lemmon was 10, he had undergone three operations on his ears, and by the age of 12, he had spent nearly two years in the hospital. He became interested in acting when he was 8 years old, and he began performing in school plays. Jack attended Rivers Country Day School and graduated from Phillips Andover Academy in 1943, then he enrolled at Harvard. While attending Harvard, he served as president of the Hasty Pudding Club, and since he was not allowed to act in stage productions due to academic probation, he sometimes acted onstage using pseudonyms like Timothy Orange. Lemmon joined the V-12 Navy College Training Program and briefly served as an ensign on the USS Lake Champlain during World War II, then he returned to Harvard and earned a War Service Sciences degree in 1947. He then studied acting with Uta Hagen at New York City's HB Studio.
