        "text": "Tributes flooded in yesterday for the man described as a stylishly versatile actor who was equally at home playing the zany clown or finding the emotional edge to portray an alcoholic or a dying man.\n\nWarren Gowan, his long-term friend and spokesman, announcing the actor's death at the University of Southern California's Norris cancer centre, said yesterday: ''He is one of the greatest actors in the history of the business. To say one word about him would be to say he's a beautiful person. It's an opinion that is shared by everybody who knew him.''\n\nLemmon died of complications from cancer on Wednesday night with his actress wife, Felicia Farr, their daughter Courtney, and his son Chris at his bedside.\n\nMichael Winner, the British director, a friend for 25 years, said: ''He had a style of acting which is totally absent from the screen today and will never be equalled. He was also the only man I have ever met who was amusing at all times.''\n\nVladimir Mirodan, the vice-principal of the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama and the director of its drama school, said Lemmon was an actor who inspired people.\n\nMr Mirodan said: ''He was a comic genius who was able to change his personality to suit all kinds of character roles. He had a huge emotional range from the zany clown to the touching, tear-inducing.\n\n''Acting is all about transformation. There are few actors who are able to transform themselves completely into the character they are portraying. But it is those actors who are marked as the greatest and Jack Lemmon was one of them.''\n\nThe Harvard-educated actor began in films with two stylish comedies and a musical. Then in 1955 his unique comedy style shone through as the hapless Ensign Pulver in Mister Roberts, a role that won Lemmon a supporting actor Oscar.\n\nHe received a best actor's one in 1973 for his intense portrayal in Save The Tiger of a clothing manufacturer trying desperately to save his business. Of his six other Oscar nominations for lead actor, only two were for comedies, four for dramas.\n\nLemmon was known for two great long-time screen collaborations - one with director Billy Wilder, the other with Walter Matthau, who died last July.\n\nWith Wilder, he made the classic Some Like It Hot, which also starred Marilyn Monroe and Tony Curtis, and The Apartment, with Shirley MacLaine.\n\nIt was Wilder who teamed Lemmon with Matthau in The Fortune Cookie in 1966. Then they famously starred in the 1968 film The Odd Couple, in which Lemmon played the fastidious ''neatnik'' to Matthau's total slob.\n\nIn 1993, they reunited to make the popular film Grumpy Old Men. In all, Lemmon made seven films with Wilder and eight with Matthau.\n\nJohn Uhler Lemmon III was born on February 8, 1925, in a hospital lift because his mother refused to leave a winning bridge hand. He had a case of jaundice, prompting a nurse to comment: ''My, look at the little yellow Lemmon.''\n\nOne critic said of him: ''What marks all the best work Lemmon has done are some trace elements of the man himself, some perceived truth that as clown or tragic figure, the persona within the character is likeable, decent, intelligent, vulnerable, worth knowing. Disorganised possibly, flawed almost certainly, but forever worth knowing.''"
