Her parents were of Russian Jewish and Romanian Jewish descent.\n\nFelicia appeared in several modeling photo shoots and advertisements during the 1950s and 1960s. Her earliest screen appearances date from the mid-1950s and included the Westerns Jubal (1956) and 3:10 to Yuma (1957), both starring Glenn Ford and The Last Wagon (1956) starring Richard Widmark.\n\nActor Lee Farr (who also made two guest appearances on Bonanza, first as Johnny Sims in \"The Deadly Ones\", then as Sam Torrance in \"The Running Man\") was her first husband, a marriage which produced a daughter, Denise Farr, who later became the wife of actor Don Gordon. Farr's second husband was film star Jack Lemmon; they married in 1962, while Lemmon was filming the comedy Irma La Douce in Paris, and remained married until his death in 2001. [1]\n\nFarr's later films include the bawdy Billy Wilder farce Kiss Me, Stupid (1964) with Dean Martin and Ray Walston as her husband, a role originally intended for Lemmon; Walter Matthau's daughter-in-law in Kotch (1971, Lemmon's only film as director); the Don Siegel bank-heist caper Charley Varrick (1973) with Matthau; plus more than 30 television series appearances on The Alfred Hitchcock Hour, Bonanza, Ben Casey, Burke's Law, and many others.\n\nDuring her marriage to Jack Lemmon, Farr gave birth to a daughter, Courtney, in 1966.[1] She is also the stepmother of Lemmon's son, actor and author Chris Lemmon.\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nFelicia Farr article at Wikipedia"
