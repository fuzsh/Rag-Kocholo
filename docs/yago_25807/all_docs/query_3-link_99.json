        "text": "The famous actor, Jack Lemmon, is related to us. Jack is a descendant of Alexis Lemmon, Sr., one of our ancestors. (In my first post on this blog, I featured Alexis Lemmon, Jr., a Revolutionary War soldier, who is buried in Shauck Cemetery. Alexis, Sr. is my sixth great grandfather and also was Jack’s sixth great grandfather.\n\nJohn Uhler “Jack” Lemmon III was born on February 8, 1925 and died on June 27, 2001. Lemmon was an eight time Academy Award nominee, with two wins. He starred in over 60 films, such as Some Like It Hot, The Apartment, Mister Roberts (for which he won the 1955 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor), Days of Wine and Roses, The Great Race, Irma la Douce, The Odd Couple and its sequel 30 years later, The Odd Couple II, (and other frequent collaborations with Odd Couple co-star Walter Matthau), Save the Tiger (for which he won the 1973 Academy Award for Best Actor), The Out-of-Towners, The China Syndrome, Missing (for which he won Best Actor at the 1982 Cannes Film Festival), Glengarry Glen Ross, Tuesdays with Morrie, Grumpy Old Men, and Grumpier Old Men.\n\nLemmon was born in a suburb of Boston. He was the only child of Mildred Burgess LaRue (née Noel) and John Uhler Lemmon, Jr., the president of a donut company. His paternal grandmother was from an Irish immigrant family. During his acceptance of his lifetime achievement award, he stated that he knew he wanted to be an actor from the age of eight. Lemmon graduated from Harvard. He served in the Navy on the aircraft carrier, Lake Champlain, during World War II.\n\nAfter college, Lemmon took up acting professionally, working on radio, television and Broadway. He studied acting and became enamored of the piano, learning to play it on his own. He could also play the harmonica, guitar, organ, and the double bass.\n\nHe was married twice and his son, Chris Lemmon, was also an actor. Lemmon was well-known for being an outstanding “celebrity” golfer, who frequently played in pro-am tournaments. He is buried in Westwood Village Memorial Park in Westwood, California, near his friend and frequent co-star, Walter Matthau."
