        "text": "JACK LEMMON, the two-time Oscar award-winning actor - best known for Save The Tiger, Mister Roberts, and The Apartment - died from a disease that will affect one in two of us - cancer.\n\nBy Chanel Georgina, Senior Reporter\n\nLink copied Bookmark\n\nThe important symptoms of bladder cancer to remember\n\nSpecifically dying from bladder cancer on June 27, 2001, the late Jack Lemmon suffered from a disease that causes 15 deaths each day in the UK, Cancer Research UK confirmed. At his bedside, as he passed away, was his wife Felicia – who he married in 1962 – and their daughter, and his son from a previous marriage. During his lifetime, Lemmon was considered a master of comedy and an extraordinaire at drama productions.\n\nThe star received eight Academy Award nominations, won two Primetime Emmy Awards, and took home the BAFTA Film Award three times.\n\nLemmon was destined to become a performer; he had been schooled on the New York stage and was president of Harvard University's prestigious theatrical group, the Hasty Pudding Club.\n\nDedicating his life's work to the big screen, fans were bereft when Lemmon's light went out at the age of 76.\n\nBladder cancer\n\nAs one of the 10 most common cancers in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, the disease costs the NHS £65million annually to treat, stated leading charity Action Bladder Cancer UK.\n\nREAD MORE: Heart disease: The activity done by millions of Brits makes the heart 'thicker and weaker'\n\nBladder cancer symptoms\n\nThree of the most common symptoms of bladder cancer are:\n\nBlood in the urine (even just once)\n\nRecurrent urinary infections\n\nUrgency or pain when passing urine, when no infection found on urine tests by the doctor\n\nExpanding on the symptoms, the charity said any blood in urine is \"usually bright red\".\n\nBut the colouring could even be \"rusty or dark brown\", and you might also see blood clots.\n\nDON'T MISS\n\n\"Symptoms in women can be trickier to notice,\" Action Bladder Cancer UK noted.\n\nAny unexplained bleeding, outside of a menstrual period, should be reported to your doctor.\n\nWhat causes bladder cancer\n\nThe NHS explains: \"Most cases of bladder cancer appear to be caused by exposure to harmful substances, which lead to abnormal changes in the bladder's cells over many years.\"\n\nTobacco smoke is a \"common\" culprit, estimated to cause one in three cases of bladder cancer.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\nLemmon smoked in his younger years, which could have contributed to his development of bladder cancer.\n\nThe grandfather – to Sydney, Christopher, and Jonathan – did not give up the unhealthy habit until the age of 60, The Washington Post reported.\n\nIf Lemmon continued to smoke past 60 years of age, he may not have survived for an additional 16 years.\n\nNo matter your age, or how many years you have smoked, it's always better for your health to quit.\n\nIf you would like support to quit smoking, you can speak to a local pharmacist for help.\n\nFurthermore, the NHS offers a free Stop Smoking Service, which you can access via your doctor surgery.\n\nTo keep on top of your health, it's advisable to have regular health check-ups and to report any worrisome symptoms to your doctor, including any signs of bladder cancer.\n\n\"The treatment options for bladder cancer largely depend on how advanced the cancer is,\" the NHS states.\n\nWatch Jack Lemmon in The Apartment, airing on Thursday, August 25 on BBC Four, 9.50pm."
