        "text": "Jack Lemmon (born February 8, 1925, Newton, Massachusetts, U.S.—died June 27, 2001, Los Angeles, California) was an American screen and stage actor who was adept at both comedy and drama and was noted for his portrayals of high-strung or neurotic characters in American films from the 1950s onward.\n\nLemmon attended Harvard University and was president of the school’s Hasty Pudding Club, an organization renowned for its annual satiric revues. He served in the U.S. Navy during World War II and graduated from Harvard in 1947, after which he moved to New York City. There he worked as a piano player and actor, taking roles in radio dramas and live television programs. He made his Broadway debut in a revival of the farce Room Service (1953). Although the production was unsuccessful, his performance led to a contract with Columbia Pictures the following year.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nLemmon’s first two film appearances were opposite Judy Holliday in It Should Happen to You and Phffft! (both 1954). His Academy Award-winning performance as Ensign Pulver in Mister Roberts (1955) firmly established him as one of the screen’s brightest new comic actors. He went on to deliver solid performances in other comedies, including My Sister Eileen (1955), Operation Mad Ball (1957), Bell, Book and Candle (1958), and It Happened to Jane (1959), all directed by Richard Quine.\n\nTwo films directed by Billy Wilder helped establish Lemmon as a major star. Some Like It Hot (1959), an American comedy classic, featured Lemmon as a jazz musician posing as a woman, and The Apartment (1960) reinforced the character type for which he became known, that of a tense, excitable, and baffled individual who painfully progresses to a deeper understanding of the world. He received Oscar nominations for both films, as well as for Days of Wine and Roses (1962), in which he gave a harrowing portrayal of an alcoholic advertising executive.\n\nWilder teamed Lemmon with Walter Matthau in The Fortune Cookie (1966), the first of many comedies for the pair. Their most famous teaming was in The Odd Couple (1968), based on Neil Simon’s stage hit. The film established the pattern for most of their appearances together, with a fussy neurotic (Lemmon) butting heads with a carefree scalawag (Matthau). Other Lemmon-Matthau films included The Front Page (1974), Buddy Buddy (1981), Grumpy Old Men (1993), Grumpier Old Men (1995), and The Odd Couple II (1998).\n\nIn 1970 Lemmon made his directorial debut with Kotch, starring Matthau, and he later won his second Oscar for his performance in Save the Tiger (1973). He appeared in two more Neil Simon comedies, The Out-of-Towners (1970) and The Prisoner of Second Avenue (1974), and garnered additional Oscar nominations for The China Syndrome (1979), Tribute (1980), and Missing (1982).\n\nAs he aged into character roles, Lemmon remained no less prolific. His acclaimed performances of later years included his portrayal of James Tyrone in Eugene O’Neill’s Long Day’s Journey into Night in both a stage revival (1986) and a television adaptation (1987); a down-and-out real estate salesman in Glengarry Glen Ross (1992); a smooth-talking con man in The Grass Harp (1995); and two TV renderings of classic American dramas, 12 Angry Men (1997) and Inherit the Wind (1999), both of which costarred George C. Scott. Lemmon also won an Emmy Award for his touching portrayal of a dying college professor in the television film Tuesdays with Morrie (1999).\n\nAmong Lemmon’s many honours were the American Film Institute’s Life Achievement Award in 1988, the Screen Actors Guild’s Life Achievement Award in 1990, and a Kennedy Center Honor in 1996."
