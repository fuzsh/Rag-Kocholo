        "text": "Council leaders insist they are committed to taking ownership of a town’s tallest building while delays continue.\n\nDarlington Borough Council said £2.5m had been earmarked to regenerate Northgate House into a mixed-use residential site.\n\nThe authority has faced several delays due to contractual issues with the current owners.\n\nThe council’s Labour leadership faced criticism from Conservative colleagues at a meeting on Thursday, who reiterated the need for the \"eyesore\" building to be demolished.\n\nNorthgate House closed 10 years ago, which prompted a series of proposals for its future.\n\nThe council first outlined plans to demolish the tower block in 2021, as part of a wider regeneration of the Northgate area of town.\n\nA new mixed-use residential and commercial gateway to the town is proposed for the site, the Local Democracy Reporting Service understands.\n\nThe council's hopes of quickly securing a Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO) were unsuccessful and officials recently admitted any progress soon was unlikely.\n\nAt the meeting on Thursday, Conservative councillor Jonathan Dulston said: “Have you been in the room with the current owners of Northgate House and been as direct with them as I have about the need for the building to be brought down?”\n\nResponding, cabinet member for economy, Chris McEwan, said he was confident of a positive resolution.\n\nHe said: “You will understand the complexity of this issue, and what I can say is the CPO is progressing but it needs a planning application, which is also progressing.\n\n\"We are committed to resolving this issue,\" Mr McEwan added."
