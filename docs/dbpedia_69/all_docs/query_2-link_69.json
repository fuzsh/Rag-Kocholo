        "text": "Darlington is riding on the crest of a wave after the announcement a year ago that the Treasury was relocating to the town as part of the levelling up agenda.\n\nIan Williams, chief executive of Darlington Borough Council, is keen to keep the momentum going, with seven government departments now planning to relocate between 1,300 and 1,700 staff to a “fantastic new campus.”\n\n“The announcement last March that the Treasury will relocate to Darlington has been a fantastic boost for the town,” says Ian.\n\n“The great majority of the jobs across seven government departments are going to new recruits, so there is a real opportunity for people in the North-East to enter a fantastic career.”\n\nSince the announcement a year ago, a wave of new developments has been approved across Darlington.\n\nIn October, a £105m redevelopment of Darlington Railway Station was approved, with Tees Valley Combined Authority, Darlington Borough Council, LNER and Network Rail coming together to deliver major improvements to the station.\n\nIan said: “I’m delighted to say we’ve been able to persuade the government and Network Rail to carry out those significant works on the station in the next couple of years. It is recognised that the station is a fantastic gateway into Darlington and the wider Tees Valley.”\n\nThe Central Park development is fast becoming a premier business location, comprising a mixture of residential, commercial and educational developments. Also nearing completion is a new Hybrid Incubation facility offering a mix of office and laboratory space, suitable for a range of SMEs.\n\n“The university already has two key buildings at Central Park and the college has its home there,” Ian says.\n\n“Across the town, we are seeing a lot of steelwork coming out of the ground and developments being completed.”\n\nMeanwhile, Darlington’s Centre for Process Innovation (CPI) has been in the news for its cutting-edge role in Covid vaccine research. But despite the success of the past year, the council and its many partners are not prepared to rest on their laurels.\n\n“We have got to build on that momentum,” he says. “You can’t stand still – as soon as you stand still, you go backwards.”\n\nAt the moment, that seems unlikely, as evidence abounds that people want to live in Darlington and be part of its success story.\n\nNew houses across 20 developments in the town are “selling like hot cakes” according to Ian, who adds that Darlington’s high street has also avoided the type of demise witnessed across other towns in the past couple of years.\n\n“The pressure has been on town centres and high streets and the problems on the high street have been further exacerbated by Covid,” Ian says.\n\n“But having more people wanting to live in your borough does mean you can develop a more independent retail sector, better nightlife and leisure.\n\n“All the positive announcements feed off one another and lead to more.”\n\nOn the back of this success, plans for town centre food and music festivals and an events programme are to be promoted through the Enjoy Darlington and #LoveDarlo brands.\n\nProviding two hours of free car parking also makes Darlington more attractive to out-of-town visitors.\n\nThe council has recently upgraded the marketplace and the town centre’s historic areas – the wynds and the little yards, Ian says, “were probably in need of some investment”.\n\n“We’ve been able to brighten and freshen them up,” he says.\n\n“The success of that has been more footfall in those areas and more independent retailers, restaurants and bars wanting to set up there.\n\n“There’s always empty property units on the high street, but what we are seeing is the smaller and medium-sized shops taking up these spaces quickly, with new people wanting to provide leisure, retail, restaurants and cafes.”\n\nIan acknowledges the borough needs to continue to support existing businesses if it is to grow.\n\nHousebuilding has not only had an important role in creating a vibrant town and a place where families can thrive but, Ian says, it is also attracting the next generation of skilled people that businesses need.\n\n“If you can’t supply the skills for the future, businesses won’t stay,” he says.\n\n“It’s all about creating a good home and a good job for people.\n\n“The best thing you can do for people’s long-term health and vitality is to give them a good home and a good job.”\n\nNow that the first Local Plan for Darlington since 1997 has been approved, Ian says further growth in a sustainable way is the only way forward.\n\n“We’ve got to move on, we’ve got to change and we’ve got to continue to grow. The approval of the Local Plan, which takes us to 2036, gives certainty to residents and developers.”\n\nIan adds that the council’s work with landowners to attract major private investment also “continues apace”.\n\nThe town already benefits from major employers that are well-established names, such as Cummins and the Student Loans Company, BT and DfE, to name just a few.\n\nIan says: “Around 4,000 businesses are registered in Darlington, representing a good mix of employers across many sectors.\n\n“Demand for office, manufacturing and logistics space is on the rise, as many businesses want to set up in Darlington. Darlington is acknowledged as a good place to live, work and play, with more and more businesses casting a discerning eye on what’s on offer. Darlington will only continue to grow and be successful.”"
