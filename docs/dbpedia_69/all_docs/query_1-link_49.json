        "text": "I INTRODUCTION\n\nDurham (county, England), county, north-eastern England, usually referred to as County Durham to distinguish it from the ancient cathedral city from which it derives its name, and which is the administrative and commercial centre of the county. County Durham exists both as an administrative county and as a ceremonial county. The administrative county is bordered on the north by Northumberland and the unitary authorities of Tyne and Wear metropolitan county; on the east by the North Sea; on the south-east by Darlington, Hartlepool, and Stockton-on-Tees unitary authorities; on the south by North Yorkshire; and on the west by Cumbria. The ceremonial county includes, in addition to the area of the administrative county, Darlington and Hartlepool unitary authorities, and part of Stockton-on-Tees unitary authority. The history of the emergence of County Durham’s present boundaries is complex. Under the 1974 local government reforms, the industrial regions of north-eastern and south-eastern County Durham were incorporated into the newly created counties of Tyne and Wear and Cleveland respectively.\n\nAs a result of the recommendations of the Local Government Commission, which was established under 1992 legislation to review local administration in England, Cleveland was abolished on April 1, 1996. It was replaced by four all-purpose, or unitary, authorities, including the boroughs of Hartlepool and Stockton-on-Tees. Following these administrative changes, Hartlepool and the area of Stockton-on-Tees north of the River Tees, which had formed part of the county before 1974, were deemed to form part of it again, although only for ceremonial and related purposes. On April 1, 1997, as a result of further recommendations by the Local Government Commission, the borough of Darlington, on the southern border with North Yorkshire, was separated from the administrative county. However, it also remains part of County Durham for ceremonial and related purposes (see Population and Administration below).\n\nThe rest of this article deals mainly with administrative County Durham, which now has a land area of 2,232 sq km (861 sq mi), compared with the pre-April 1997 area of 2,436 sq km (964 sq mi). The medieval prince-bishops of Durham wielded tremendous political power. Although this power was gradually eroded away, the historical importance of the see is reflected in the fact that the Bishop of Durham is one of the five Lords Spiritual of England who sit in the House of Lords, the upper house of Parliament. The county was formerly the site of Britain’s richest coalfield.\n\nII LAND AND RESOURCES\n\nCounty Durham consists chiefly of undulating lowlands, rising in the west to the North Pennines, part of the Pennine Hills; in the east is the limestone East Durham Plateau. The county is drained by two main rivers, the Wear in the north, and the Tees in the south. Both rise in the North Pennines, and as they descend form broad valleys, or dales, known as Teesdale and Weardale. The Durham Dales area forms part of the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Teesdale runs south-east as far as Barnard Castle, a historic market town. Thereafter it turns east, running through the lowlands that extend over most of the south of the county towards the North Sea. The National Trust owns several miles along the County Durham coastline, which, in 2001, was designated a Heritage Coast. The highly industrialized lower valley and estuary area of the Tees marked, until 1974, the boundary between County Durham and Yorkshire.\n\nHowever, these industrialized regions now form part of Darlington, Stockton-on-Tees, and Hartlepool unitary authorities. Weardale extends some 25 km (15 mi) east to Bishop Auckland, where the Wear turns sharply northward to Durham on its way to the coast at Sunderland, in Tyne and Wear metropolitan council area. The River Derwent flows along part of the northern border with Northumberland before taking a northerly course towards the Tyne. The western moorlands support sheep-grazing and forestry, with some cattle-farming in the valleys. Coal resources were formerly of prime importance to the economy of County Durham, but the industry has declined in recent years. Many of the seams have been exhausted. The climate of County Durham is cool, with an average annual rainfall in the region of 635 to 760 mm (25 to 30 in).\n\nIII POPULATION AND ADMINISTRATION\n\nThe population of County Durham (administrative county) is 493,470 (2001). The city of Durham has a population of about 87,725 (2001). It is the administrative, educational, and ecclesiastical centre of the county, and also the headquarters of the Durham Constabulary and the seat of the Crown Court. Other important towns include Bishop Auckland (1991, 23,154), Chester-le-Street (35,123), Seaham (22,130), Consett (20,148), Spennymoor (17,381), Stanley (18,905), Crook (8,246), and Barnard Castle (6,084), together with the new towns of Newton Aycliffe (25,085) and Peterlee (31,139), designed in 1947 and 1948 respectively to absorb population from the declining mining areas. Peterlee was named after a miners’ leader, Peter Lee. Until April 1, 1997, Darlington and its environs also formed part of the administrative county. On that date Darlington Borough Council became a unitary authority responsible for all local government services, including those previously provided by the county council. The new unitary authority forms part of the ceremonial county, however.\n\nIV EDUCATION\n\nThe Bishop of Durham was instrumental in the founding of the University of Durham (1832), and it has retained strong Church links, being a noted centre of religious education. The university has been reorganized several times (in 1908, in 1937, and in 1963); today, like the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, it is based on a collegiate system. On the south-eastern outskirts of the city is Durham College of Agriculture and Horticulture. Durham School was founded in 1414. Old-established girls’ schools include Polam Hall (1848) and Durham High School for Girls (1884).\n\nV PLACES OF INTEREST\n\nDurham city is the main focus of tourism in the county. The castle (begun 1072) and the cathedral (1093) stand side by side and form a World Heritage Site. The history of the city is portrayed at the Durham University Museum of Archaeology. Barnard Castle takes its name from the imposing Norman fortress around which it grew; extensive ruins of the fortress remain. Not far away is the medieval Raby Castle, once the home of the Nevill family, set in an 81-hectare (200-acre) deer park. Auckland Castle, in Bishop Auckland, was once the main country residence of the Prince Bishops and is now the official residence of the Bishop of Durham.\n\nCausey Arch, near Stanley, was built in 1725, and is the oldest railway bridge in the world still standing. The Bowes Museum in Upper Teesdale is a French-style chateau that contains one of the most significant private collections of art and antiques in Europe. Lewis Carroll grew up in Croft-on-Tees, North Yorkshire, near the boundary with County Durham, and was said to have written many poems in the area, including The Walrus and the Carpenter on Whitburn beach. High Force in Upper Teesdale is England’s highest waterfall. Along the coast, at Castle Eden Dene, there are very deep, wooded ravines; these have been designated a national nature reserve. County Durham has an abundance of country parks offering recreational facilities.\n\nThe county’s industrial and social history is also well recorded. Lead-mining was once important in the North Pennines, and a 19th-century lead mine at Killhope in Upper Weardale has been restored to provide an award-winning evocation of the landscape and life of the period; the mine’s great wheel, which once powered the crushing mill, is still working. Beamish open-air museum, north of Durham city, provides an experience of life from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including a former working mine and many period shops and houses. Although Darlington is no longer in the administrative county, the Darlington Railway Centre and Museum reflects the county’s long association with the railways.\n\nThe world’s first public steam railway service, opened by George Stephenson in 1825, ran between Darlington and Stockton-on-Tees; Darlington was later a leading manufacturing centre of rolling stock. Durham County Cricket Club is located at Chester-le-Street and the ground is sometimes host to international matches. Darlington FC plays in the Football League; the club’s new 25,000-seater stadium is on the eastern edge of Darlington. The team trains at the University of Durham’s playing fields complex in Durham, which is also host to the Great North Cross Country run. Middlesbrough FC also trains in County Durham, at Rockcliffe Park in Hurworth.\n\n;feature=relmfu\n\nVI ECONOMY\n\nEconomically the county was unimportant until the 19th century, when exploitation of the Durham coalfields (which had 200 pits) triggered rapid industrial growth, focused around iron and steel production and railway engineering. The economic depression between World Wars I and II marked the start of more than six decades of decline in the traditional heavy industries that had come to dominate the economy of the county. The Consett iron and steel works, one of the largest in the United Kingdom, closed in 1980. In 1945 the county was made part of the North-East Development Area, which had been set up to encourage the introduction of new and lighter industries to north-eastern England.\n\nFinancial incentives and the establishment of purpose-built industrial estates have helped attract a wide variety of companies, including firms from Japan and Korea. Industries today include light engineering, food processing, plastics-processing, pharmaceuticals, and clothing manufacture. The service sector is also growing and the high-tech sector is particularly strong, including electronics, biotechnology, information technology, and advanced materials. Hill-farming is the main agricultural activity in the west of the county. In the east, where the soil is more fertile, there is more intensive dairying and arable farming. Tourism yields a modest revenue.\n\nVII HISTORY\n\nMuch of County Durham’s history and the region’s early historical importance have been linked to its location near the English-Scottish border. During the Roman occupation of England, the region was a military outpost connected with Hadrian’s Wall. It subsequently became part of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria. William the Conqueror built Durham Castle in 1072 and in 1093 the cathedral (which took 40 years to build) was founded in honour of St Cuthbert. During the Middle Ages the region suffered greatly from the border warfare that raged between the Scots and the English. The prince-bishops of Durham rose to great importance at this period.\n\nGreat feudal lords as well as powerful clerics in the English Church, they were responsible for the defence of the region and enjoyed almost kingly powers, ruling Durham as an almost independent state, with their own coins, taxes, and courts. These lay privileges were only gradually taken from them after the Middle Ages; they were finally stopped in the 16th century by Henry VIII. The Bishop of Durham today plays a senior role in the Church of England."
