They also hold to account the Trust Board for its management of the Trust.\n\nThe Council of Governors has strong working links with the Trust Board. A joint meeting with the Board is held twice a year and Board directors attend relevant Council of Governors committees and participate in joint seminars.\n\nFoundation Trusts recruit members and, from these members, Governors are elected to represent the views of local service users and staff."
