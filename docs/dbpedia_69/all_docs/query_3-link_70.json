        "text": "A lifetime mortgage\n\nIf you have a home to sell, you may be able to use the proceeds to pay the deposit on a new property and take out a ‘lifetime mortgage’ to cover the rest of the cost.\n\nVisit the OneFamily website to read about Lifetime Mortgages\n\nBuying a ‘home for life’ plan\n\nBuying a ‘home for life plan’, or ‘lifetime lease’, gives you the right to live in a property until you (both in the case of couples) die or move to a care home. This might enable you to live somewhere you couldn’t otherwise afford.\n\nVisit the Homewise website to read about Lifetime Leases\n\nRetirement ‘villages’ are the best known and largest examples, typically providing between 100 and 300 homes, often a mix of apartments and bungalows, on a single site, along with restaurants, gyms, landscaped gardens, outdoor seating areas and indoor activity spaces. Generally the whole complex will be designed with attention to accessibility for residents with restricted mobility.\n\nBoth ownership and rental options are commonly available, as well as alternative ways of paying for the services on offer – including part deferring payment until a property is sold.\n\nDaily help, including personal care, is available on site and one or more meals are available daily in a dining room or restaurant. Additional facilities are also common – for example hairdressing salons, hobby rooms and gyms. Organised activities will focus on helping residents maintain their health and wellbeing.\n\nHousing-with-care developments run by housing associations and local authorities tend to be called ‘extra care’ or ‘independent living’ schemes, and explicitly seek to accommodate people who need daily help.\n\nThose run by private operators more often focus on lifestyle, with help and care services discretely available to buy if or when required.\n\nCare services offered to people in housing-with-care facilities are regulated, subject to periodic inspections and awarded grades. Wherever possible, Inspectorate reports and grades are accessible from the housing-with-care pages on this website.\n\nUnderstanding & finding a care home\n\nA care home is a residential setting where a number of older people live, usually in single rooms or hotel-style suites, because they need regular or continuous access to care.\n\nSome care homes are registered to provide personal care only, for example help with washing, dressing and giving medication. Others also provide nursing, and will have a nurse on duty twenty-four hours a day.\n\nWith a few exceptions, accommodation in a care home cannot be bought or rented like retirement housing. Think of them more like full-board hotel accommodation with 24 hour care available.\n\nAs with hotels, the cost of living in a care home varies widely according to its location, the size of your room or suite, and the facilities on offer. There is often a substantial difference between fees charged to those who can afford the costs themselves and those who receive help from their Local Authority. A majority of homes aim to cater for both, but some target only one or the other.\n\nCare homes are regulated by independent Inspectorates in each country of the UK, subject to periodic inspections and awarded quality grades. Inspectorate reports and grades are accessible from the care home pages on this website.\n\nMaking your home more age-friendly\n\nA challenge we all face as we get older is to think about where we live, and how it will work for us when we’re older. If you intend to ‘stay put’ where you are, then thinking and planning ahead makes sense.\n\nHome improvement Agencies (HIAs), also known as Care & Repair agencies, are local non-profit organisations set up to help older people think about, plan, finance and organise work on their homes. These services tackle smaller repair jobs, including installing safety & security devices. They are provided by many local Age UKs as well as other organisations.\n\nIf affording work to your home is an issue, Age UK’s factsheet Home improvements and repairs is a good read, as is OneFamily’s webpage How to fund home improvements.\n\nPractical help and support in your home\n\nOur home service directory provides information about a wide range of services for older people. Select one of the topics below to browse service in your area:\n\nFor guidance on how to find help at home, see:\n\nOur factsheet Living longer – remaining independent\n\nGetting out and about\n\nGetting older can make it more difficult to get around and do the things you used to do, or would like to do. But there are plenty of services that could help you.\n\nOur Home Services Directory offers information about:\n\nHOOP – Your Housing MoT test!\n\nOur Housing Options for Older People ‘app’ (HOOP) will help you think about different aspects of your home and how you live in it. It:\n\n• Will help you assess how well your present home suits you now, and may do so in the future;\n\n• Offers immediate suggestions for tacking any issues you identify;\n\n• Helps identify any further information you need about possible solutions or alternatives.\n\nEAC Advice\n\nOver the last 37 years, EAC provided a unique ‘housing options’ information and advice service to older people and their families.\n\nWe are doing all we can to make it possible to re-open EAC’s advice service. However we do recommend the following services which may be able to help you today:\n\n• Age UK national advice line on 0800 678 1602\n\n• Independent Age helpline on 0800 319 6789\n\n• Legal & General Care Concierge free helpline on 0800 086 8170\n\nOur offer to care home providers\n\nOur Care Home Directory is a free public service. It includes all 11,500 registered care homes in the UK that cater exclusively or primarily for older people. There is no charge whatsoever to appear in it, and we welcome a photo and descriptive text to enhance the presentation of your home(s).\n\nOur offer to information & advice agencies\n\nEAC sees itself, and this website, as one source of ‘housing options’ information and advice for older people and their families. But there are many other organisations providing valuable services, both locally and nationally.\n\nOf particular interest to us are local agencies that do what we can’t – that have detailed knowledge of local housing solutions, and offer telephone or face-to-face advice and support to their clients – alongside any website presence."
