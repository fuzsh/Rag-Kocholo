        "text": "Why this matters\n\nEveryone should be paid enough to live on.\n\nThe Real Living Wage is a voluntary rate employers can sign up to that is based on the real cost of living.\n\nThe current rates are £12.00 per hour, and £13.15 per hour in London.\n\nFind out more in our explainer about the Real Living Wage.\n\nWhy this matters\n\nEveryone gets sick sometimes. You should be able to take time off without worrying.\n\nAt a good job you should still get paid if you’re scheduled to work but can’t due to sickness. Your contract should say how many sick days you can take each year.\n\nThis is more than the legal minimum, which says you should only get paid if you are unwell for 4 full days. See Citizens Advice for more details.\n\nWhy this matters\n\nEveryone gets sick sometimes. You should be able to take time off when you need to.\n\nA good job should support you when you’re unwell and have systems in place that will allow you to take time off to recover when you need it.\n\nWhy this matters\n\nA good job means enjoying the place where you work.\n\nThe people you work with every day really matter. They can be the difference between a terrible day and a great one.\n\nIf you’d recommend your team to a friend, this shows that something’s going right.\n\nWhy this matters\n\nA good job should give you good training when you start, not just drop you in at the deep end.\n\nThis means that you’ll be happier and more productive from day one and shows that your employer values you.\n\nIt’s also very important if your job involves anything that could be dangerous. Good training from the outset keeps you and your team safe.\n\nWhy this matters\n\nA good job should help you progress at work, if you want to. That might be supporting you to get better at the job you currently have, learn something new, manage a team or take on more responsibilities.\n\nThis means you’ll be able to build on your skills and experience, and earn more money.\n\nWhy this matters\n\nAt a good job, the role of head office should be to support the people on the frontline serving customers.\n\nTo do that properly, the company’s owners or head office need to have a good understanding of what’s really happening on the frontline. This is especially important when a company owns multiple locations.\n\nWhy this matters\n\nAt a good job, there should be a supportive relationship between the people working on the frontline serving customers and the people who own the company or work in head office.\n\nYou should be kept informed about how the company is doing as a whole, both in good times and when things get tough for the business."
