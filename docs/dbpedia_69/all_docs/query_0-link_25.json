We’re led by an Elected Mayor and Cabinet and cover the seven local authority areas of County Durham, Gateshead, Newcastle, North Tyneside, Northumberland, South Tyneside and Sunderland.\n\nOur purpose is to champion the full potential of our region. Collaborating with our partners and local authorities, we’ll create a better way of life by connecting communities, giving people the skills to succeed, and improving wellbeing for all, so that the North East is recognised as an outstanding place to live, work, visit and invest."
