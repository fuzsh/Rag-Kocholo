        "text": "Town in County Durham, England\n\nThis article is about a town in England. For other uses, see Darlington (disambiguation).\n\nTown in England\n\nDarlington is a market and industrial town in County Durham, England. It is the main administrative centre of the unitary authority Borough of Darlington. The borough is a constituent member of the devolved Tees Valley area.[1]\n\nA tributary of the River Tees, to the south of the town, the River Skerne flows through the town. The town is near the Yorkshire Dales National Park, being 11 miles (18 km) from the park boundary near the town of Richmond. The town had a population of 107,800 [2] in the 2021 Census, classed as large.[3]\n\nIn the 19th century, establishment of the Stockton and Darlington Railway (the world's first permanent steam locomotive powered passenger railway) led to the town having an industrial and manufacturing economy.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nDarnton\n\n[edit]\n\nDarlington started as an Anglo-Saxon settlement. The name Darlington derives from the Anglo-Saxon Dearthington, which seemingly meant 'the settlement of Deornoth's people', but by Norman times the name had changed to Derlinton. During the 17th and 18th centuries, the town was usually known by the name of Darnton.[4]\n\nDarlington has a historic market area in the town centre. St Cuthbert's Church, built in 1183, is one of the most important early English churches in the north of England and is Grade I listed.[5] The oldest church in Darlington is St Andrew's Church, built around 1100 in Haughton-le-Skerne.\n\nWhen the author Daniel Defoe visited the town during the 18th century, he noted that it was eminent for \"good bleaching of linen, so that I have known cloth brought from Scotland to be bleached here\". However he also disparaged the town, writing that it had \"nothing remarkable but dirt.\" (roads would have typically been unpaved in the 18th century). [6]\n\nThe so-called \"Durham Ox\" came from Darlington (born in the early 19th century, this steer became renowned for its excellent proportions, which came to inform the standard for Shorthorn cattle).[4]\n\nVictorian era\n\n[edit]\n\nStivvies\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the early 19th century, Darlington remained a small market town.[7]\n\nThe Stockton and Darlington Railway ran steam locomotives designed for passengers and goods, built to a standard gauge, on a permanent main line with branches. On 27 September 1825, George Stephenson's engine, \"Locomotion No. 1\", travelled between Shildon and Stockton-on-Tees via Darlington, an event that was seen as ushering in the modern railway age.\n\nLater in the 19th century, the town became an important centre for railway manufacturing. An early railway works was the Hopetown Carriage Works (est. 1853), which supplied carriages and locomotives to the Stockton and Darlington Railway. The engineering firm of William and Alfred Kitching also manufactured locomotives there around this time. The town eventually developed three significant railway works. The largest of these was the main-line Darlington Works, whose main factory, the North Road Shops, opened in 1863 and remained in operation until 1966. A second works, Robert Stephenson & Co. (colloquially: \"Stivvies\"), moved to Darlington from Newcastle upon Tyne in 1902. It was renamed \"Robert Stephensons & Hawthorns\" in 1937, was absorbed by English Electric around 1960, and had closed by 1964. The third was Faverdale Wagon Works, which was established in 1923 and closed in 1962. In the 1950s, it was a UK pioneer in applying mass-production techniques to the manufacture of railway goods wagons.\n\nQuakers and the Echo\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the 19th century, Darlington Quaker families such as those of Pease and Backhouse emerged as major employers and philanthropists. Industrialist Joseph Pease gave Darlington its landmark clock tower in 1864.[8] The clock face was crafted by T. Cooke & Sons of York, and bells cast by John Warner & Sons of nearby Norton-on-Tees.[5] The bells are sisters to Big Ben.[citation needed]\n\nDarlington Mechanics Institute was opened in 1854 by Elizabeth Pease Nichol, who had donated towards its cost.[9] In 1853, South Park was laid out, over 91 acres (37 ha), with financial support from the Backhouse family.[10]\n\nArchitect Alfred Waterhouse, famous for work including London's Natural History Museum and Manchester Town Hall, designed Darlington's Grade II listed Old Town Hall and Market Hall, Darlington in 1860. Four years later he contributed Backhouse's Bank building that is, as of 2022 , a branch of Barclays bank.[5]\n\nDuring the period, George Gordon Hoskins was responsible for much of the town's architecture, designing buildings such as The King's Head Hotel.[citation needed]\n\nDarlington Free Library, a Grade II listed building in Crown Street, was built for £10,000 by Edward Pease. His daughter, Lady Lymington, opened the building on 23 October 1885 and presented it to the town council who agreed to operate it in perpetuity. As of 2022 it contains a library and \"centre for local studies\".[11][12]\n\nIn 1870, The Northern Echo newspaper launched.[13] Its most famous editor, William Thomas Stead, died on the Titanic. Facing the present Northern Echo building on Priestgate is the William Stead public house named for him.[14]\n\nWars\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1939, Darlington had the most cinema seats per capita in the United Kingdom.[5]\n\nOn the night of 13 January 1945, a Lancaster bomber piloted by Pilot Officer William Stuart McMullen of Canada was on a training exercise when one of its engines caught fire and it crashed on farmland near Lingfield Lane. McMullen heroically stayed at the controls while his crew parachuted to safety and directed the stricken aircraft away from the houses below. He was killed on impact. His heroism was honoured by renaming Lingfield Lane \"McMullen Road\" and erecting a memorial monument.[15][16]\n\nTornado and the brick train\n\n[edit]\n\nStarting in 1993, rail enthusiast group A1 Steam Locomotive Trust[17] worked on building an all-new steam locomotive, the first to be constructed since the 1960s. It was intended to be the 50th member of the long withdrawn LNER Peppercorn Class A1 engine, called Tornado and numbered 60163, from scratch in the 1853 former Stockton and Darlington Railway Carriage Works at Hopetown. Many of the original fleet had been built at Darlington locomotive works in the late 1940s. Tornado was completed in January 2008.\n\nTo commemorate the town's contribution to the railways, David Mach's 1997 work Train is located alongside the A66, close to the original Stockton–Darlington railway. It is a life-size brick sculpture of a steaming locomotive emerging from a tunnel, made from 185,000 Accrington Nori bricks. The work had a budget of £760,000.[18][19][20]\n\n21st century\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2001, Darlington became the first place in England to allow same-sex civil ceremonies[21] and as of 2022 , it hosts an annual Gay Pride Festival at venues across the town.[citation needed] A 2005 Darlington Borough Council project to pedestrianise areas of the town centre, this included some Victorian features along High Row.[22] In August 2008, a fire, in which nobody was killed, caused damage and weeks of closure until the damage fixed for several shops (including Woolworths). The King's Head Hotel was also affected with damage to the roof and 100 bedrooms, the hotel was able to reopen in 2012.[23][24]\n\nGovernance\n\n[edit]\n\nThere is one main tier of local government covering Darlington, at unitary authority level, being Darlington Borough Council. The council is a member of the Tees Valley Combined Authority, led by the directly elected Mayor of Tees Valley. Most of the built-up area of Darlington is an unparished area, although some outer parts of the urban area now extend into neighbouring parishes.[25] The council is based at Darlington Town Hall on Feethams in the centre of Darlington.[26]\n\nDarlington was an ancient parish. It was historically divided into four townships: Archdeacon Newton, Blackwell, Cockerton, and a Darlington township covering the town itself and adjoining areas. Such townships also became civil parishes in 1866.[27][28] A body of improvement commissioners was established in 1823 to provide infrastructure to the more built-up parts of the Darlington township.[29] The commissioners were superseded in 1850 when the whole Darlington township was made a local board district, governed by an elected local board.[30]\n\nThe local board was in turn replaced when Darlington was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1867. The borough boundaries were enlarged on several occasions, notably absorbing the Harrowgate Hill area from the parish of Haughton-le-Skerne in 1872, Cockerton in 1915, Haughton-le-Skerne in 1930 and Blackwell in 1967. In 1915 the borough was elevated to become a county borough, taking over county-level functions from Durham County Council.[31]\n\nThe borough was substantially enlarged in 1974 to take in most of the surrounding Darlington Rural District, such that the modern borough of Darlington covers both the town and a surrounding rural hinterland. The enlarged borough was also reconstituted as a non-metropolitan district as part of the 1974 reforms, with Durham County Council once more providing county-level services to the town.[32] The borough was made a unitary authority on 1 April 1997, regaining its independence from the county council. The borough remains part of County Durham for ceremonial purposes.[33][34]\n\nSince 2016 the council has been a member of the Tees Valley Combined Authority along with Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, Redcar and Cleveland and Stockton-on-Tees. Unlike Darlington, the other four districts in the combined authority had all been part of the short-lived county of Cleveland between 1974 and 1996.[35]\n\nAs of 2019 , the Member of Parliament (MP) for the Darlington constituency is Conservative Peter Gibson. Former members of parliament for the town include Jenny Chapman, Alan Milburn, the former Secretary of State for Health under the Tony Blair Labour government and Michael Fallon, who was Secretary of State for Defence under the David Cameron coalition government and Theresa May's Conservative government.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nDarlington is located in the south of County Durham close to the River Tees, which acts as the border between Durham and Yorkshire. Both the River Tees and River Skerne pass through the borough, the Skerne later joining the Tees which then flows east and into the North Sea. Due to river bifurcation at the Baydale Beck and Cocker Beck, which later flow into the Tees and Skerne respectively, much of the western side of Darlington forms a river island.\n\nAreas within the Borough\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the north are Harrowgate, Coatham Mundeville and Beaumont Hill and to the north-east are Whinfield and Haughton Le Skerne. To the east is the suburb of Eastbourne and Red Hall with Firthmoor and Skerne Park to the south. Situated in the west end are Hummersknott, Mowden and Blackwell. Finally, to the north-west are Branksome, Cockerton, Faverdale, The Denes, West Park, High Grange and Pierremont which is associated with the notable Henry Pease (MP).[36][37]\n\nDistance to other places\n\n[edit]\n\nPlace Distance Direction Relation Hartlepool 18 miles (29 km)[38] North East Combined Authority area Durham 17 miles (27 km)[39] North Historic county town and closest city Middlesbrough 13 miles (21 km)[40] East Combined Authority area Stockton-on-Tees 10 miles (16 km)[41] East Combined Authority area\n\nEconomy\n\n[edit]\n\nThe trend of regional gross value added of Darlington at current basic prices published (pp. 240–253) by the Office for National Statistics, with figures in £ millions.\n\nYear Regional Gross Value Added[a] Agricu­lture[b] Indust­ry[c] Servi­ces[d] 1995 1,115 8 377 729 2000 1,192 6 417 768 2003 1,538 6 561 971\n\nDarlington was un-industrial throughout the 20th century, with finance and manufacturing as the main elements of its economy.\n\nService Sector\n\n[edit]\n\nA major employer in the area is the English division of the Student Loans Company, Student Finance England, which is based at Lingfield Point and employs over 1,000 people.[42] Other large service sector companies with offices in the town include Darlington Building Society. Darlington Borough Council announced that the site for the DL1 complex, previously a car park for Darlington Town Hall, was also to be redeveloped to house riverside office space for the Department for Education to replace its previous office on the edge of the town in Mowden, in an effort to safeguard Darlington jobs. This was officially opened on 19 March 2015.[43] The Disclosure and Barring Service has a national office in the town.[44] Amazon UK operates a warehouse facility, which opened in early 2020, employing 1,300 full-time staff, one of the town's biggest employers.[citation needed]\n\nTelecommunication\n\n[edit]\n\nEE is the largest private sector employer in the town, with 2,500 staff. The company took over its operations from one of its predecessors, Orange Mobile.\n\nMorton Park\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Morton Park area of Darlington is currently undergoing a partial redevelopment, with areas of unused waste land being redeveloped into modern industrial and office space. Companies based in Morton Park and the surrounding area are Infoserve Ltd and vehicle rental company Northgate Vehicle Hire. Morrisons supermarket at Morton Park[45] opened in August 1995.\n\nOther commercial spaces in Darlington include North Road Industrial Estate, which includes a Morrisons supermarket;[46] Cleveland Trading Estate and Faverdale Industrial Estate. The council depot on Central Park is also to be redeveloped into commercial space.\n\nEngineering\n\n[edit]\n\nDarlington has a rich engineering heritage and several notable engineering firms established locally. Bridge building was particularly important in the town. Bridges built in Darlington span the River Nile and Amazon.[4]\n\nLocal engineering firms include:\n\nCummins has an engine building facility near Morton Park.[47]\n\nAMEC's industrial arm is headquartered in the town\n\nDarlington Forge Company originated in the town, c. 1967[48]\n\nWhessoe originated in Darlington.\n\nRetail and leisure\n\n[edit]\n\nAs an historic market town, a weekly outdoor market was held on the market square, which is one of the biggest in the country. An indoor market is located underneath the town clock on Prebend Row.\n\nThey are a number of shops in the area:\n\nPrebend Row also hosts the Cornmill Shopping centre[49]\n\nGrange Road and Skinnergate has a number of independent shops\n\nDuke Street houses art galleries and restaurants\n\nArgos, a UK retail company, has its largest warehouse distribution centre in the North of England located in Darlington. This centre is within the Faverdale Industrial Estate, North West of the town.\n\nIn November 2012, a deal was signed between Darlington Borough Council and developer Terrace Hill for a £30 million re-development of the site of the former Feethams bus depot. The proposal had an expected completion date of late 2014, though this did overrun with completion early 2016.[50]\n\nHospitals\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Darlington Memorial Hospital and Woodlands Hospital\n\nDarlington Memorial Hospital is on Hollyhurst Road,[51] in the corridor between Woodland Road and The Denes. The private Woodlands Hospital is at Morton Park.\n\nCulture and landmarks\n\n[edit]\n\nTheatre\n\n[edit]\n\nThe former Civic Theatre, now The Hippodrome, is a popular arts venue in the town, hosting a mix of musicals, dramas, plays and pantomimes.

It was usually held in September on the showground in South Park; but it has now moved to Ripon.[57]\n\nMosque\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Jamia Mosque and Islamic Society of Darlington is located in the North Lodge Terrace area of the town,[58][59] an area with a relatively high proportion of ethnic minority residents (39.2% of the population in that area, compared to a town average of 6.3%).[60] Constituted as a charity under UK law in 1982,[61] the mosque offers worship facilities, as well as Islamic education, and has its own telecommunications mast for calls to prayer.[62]\n\nChurches\n\n[edit]\n\nDarlington has a wide array of churches scattered around the town including the iconic and notable parish church of St Cuthbert's in the centre of town, with a towering spire and a grade I listed status. Other churches include Methodist, Baptist, Roman Catholic and Jehovah Witness places of worship, as well as Holy Trinity Church and the grade II listed St John the Evangelist Church which closed for worship in 2023.[63]\n\nTransport\n\n[edit]\n\nAir\n\n[edit]\n\nTeesside International Airport is five miles (eight kilometres) east of Darlington town centre and serves County Durham and North Yorkshire. The airport was known as Durham Tees Valley Airport from 2004 until mid-2019. It has flights to a few domestic locations across the UK and international flights to some locations in Europe. Many private or general aviation Flights use the airport. The airport has a Fire Training Centre which trains many airport firefighters.\n\nThe nearest large airports are Newcastle (42 miles (68 kilometres)) and Leeds Bradford (62 miles (100 kilometres)).\n\nRail\n\n[edit]\n\nLocal services run from North Road railway station, the town's original station. Darlington railway station lies on the East Coast Main Line and has regular services to London Kings Cross, Leeds City, Edinburgh Waverley, Manchester Piccadilly, Manchester Airport and Newcastle.\n\nDarlington railway station also serves as the mainline interchange for Middlesbrough station, which itself has few intercity services. Darlington also has access to the Tees Valley Line connecting all the main settlements along the River Tees, running from Bishop Auckland to Saltburn via Darlington, Stockton-on-Tees and Middlesbrough.\n\nDarlington railway station has a large Victorian clock tower which can be seen throughout large areas of the town.\n\nRoads\n\n[edit]\n\nDarlington is well connected to the North East's major trunk route, the A1(M), which bypasses the town to the west. It was completed in 1965, replacing the Great North Road route which is now known as the A167. The town is served by three closely-spaced junctions of the A1(M): Junctions 57 A66(M), 58 A68, and 59 A167. Junction 59 is the access exit for Darlington motorway services (Newton Park), with an onsite filling station, hotel and restaurant. Darlington is also close to other major trunk routes, including the A66 trans-Pennine route connecting Darlington to Stockton-on-Tees and the A19.\n\nThe £5.9 million five miles (eight kilometres) A66 Darlington eastern bypass opened on 25 November 1985. The Darlington Eastern Transport Corridor, linking the Central Park regeneration zone (Haughton Road) and Darlington town centre to a new roundabout on the A66, was opened in the summer of 2008.\n\nBus\n\n[edit]\n\nBus transport in the town is mostly provided by Arriva North East.\n\nStagecoach operated in the town until 2007, when it sold its operations to Arriva. Arriva services connect Darlington to neighbouring towns and cities such as Durham, Bishop Auckland, Richmond, Stockton, and Middlesbrough. Stagecoach returned to Darlington in 2023 following the decision by Arriva to end its service 12 from Hurworth to Middleton St. George and Teesside Airport. Stagecoach took over this service on 23 September 2023, renumbering it as route 6 (6A on Sundays) and extending it to Stockton via Eaglescliffe, Yarm and Ingleby Barwick.\n\nThere are also two smaller independent operators running services in the town, Dales & District and Hodgsons Buses.\n\nPavement\n\n[edit]\n\nDarlington was chosen by the Department for Transport as one of three national Sustainable Travel Demonstration Towns (together with Peterborough and Worcester) in 2004 and delivering a three-year research and marketing programme to promote sustainable travel choices under the brand name 'Local Motion'. It was also chosen as one of six cycling demonstration towns in October 2005, receiving £3 million worth of funding from the government and local council money.[64]\n\n2007 Town Centre Pedestrian Heart Project worth 10 million pounds, saw some of Darlington Town Centre modernised, with an emphasis on vehicles becoming less common in the centre and some roads pedestrianised completely. Other improvements were to cycling facilities and routes, and linking the town to the national cycle route network. Darlington is the only place to win both sustainable travel and cycling demonstration town status.[65]\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nMuseums and heritage\n\n[edit]\n\nThe town's main museum is Hopetown Darlington, sited near North Road railway station – it and Piercebridge Roman Fort near the town are run by the Darlington Museum Service.[66]\n\nInstitutions\n\n[edit]\n\nTeesside University opened a Darlington campus in 2011.

The club stemmed from the Darlington Foot Harriers who travelled in packs hunting hares. Some of the key members such as Thomas and Charles Mountford founded the club which went on to become one of the most notable clubs in the country and were known nationally for their great athletes.\n\nThe club celebrated its 125th year in 2016, with anniversary games held at Eastbourne Sports Complex and were also the first club in the UK who were granted a licence via England Athletics new systems whilst the country was coming out of the COVID19 situation.\n\nIn 2019 the club was awarded the Queen's Award for Voluntary Services (QAVS), which was created in 2002 to celebrate Queen Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee.

Equivalent to an MBE, this award (changed to KAVS since King Charles III came to the throne) is the highest award given to local voluntary groups in the UK. The club was also winner of the 2021 and 2022 Regional England Athletics North East Volunteering Club of the Year awards.\n\nIn 2015 the club also moved away from the 'D' vest which had been introduced in the late 1970's, initially moving to 'Darlington Harriers' before the new club logo which was introduced in 2018. The new logo shape is the DL postcode area, includes the towns landmarks in Joseph Pease's statue, the town clock and of course the brick train which represents the town's history in the rail industry.
