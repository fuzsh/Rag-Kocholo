        "text": "Freeths LLP‘s public sector practice is noted for its ’knowledge and expertise in the local government planning field‘, boasting a strong record of advice on procurement initiatives, section 106 agreements, planning inquiries, and compulsory purchase orders in connection with high-value residential and commercial development projects as well as urban regenerations. The practice maintains close relations with the likes of the Royal Borough of Greenwich and Reading Borough Council and, in addition to its planing expertise, is well-versed in contentious and non-contentious matters related to telecoms infrastructure. Birmingham-based planning and CPO expert Nathan Holden, who also has significant procurement experience, leads the practice. Bristol-based real estate lawyers Duncan Tringham, who is noted for his understanding of clean energy schemes, and Dan Cuthbert, who advises on property disputes, are also recommended, as is London infrastructure expert Robert Bruce."
