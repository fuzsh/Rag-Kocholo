        "text": "Devolution and local government reorganisation\n\nDevolution sees the government hand over decision-making powers to local political leaders and provide millions of pounds in funding to shape major policies and projects on a regional level.\n\nTo enable a devolution deal for York and North Yorkshire, the government stipulated that we had to replace the two-tier system of local government in North Yorkshire, made up of the former county council and seven district and borough authorities, with a single unitary authority.\n\nAs a result of this, North Yorkshire Council launched on 1 April 2023. City of York Council continued as a unitary authority.\n\nFollowing local government reorganisation, a 30-year devolution deal for York and North Yorkshire, with an investment fund of over Â£500 million, was announced in August 2022. This led to the launch of the York and North Yorkshire Combined Authority on 1 February 2024.\n\nElections for the first mayor of the combined authority took place on 2 May, you can find out more on our York and North Yorkshire Combined Authority mayoral election page.\n\nAbout the York and North Yorkshire Combined Authority\n\nA combined authority is where a group of councils work together across a larger area. The York and North Yorkshire Combined Authority has been created by the City of York Council and ourselves.\n\nThe York and North Yorkshire Combined Authority is a legally recognised, single body. Their role is to use some of the money and powers, that up to now have been held by central government, and work with local leaders and communities to invest in ways that will help to make York and North Yorkshire a better place for you to live, work and do business.\n\nOur council and City of York Council will continue as they are, working at a local level to deliver vital services for residents. The combined authority will deliver on a wider scale across both areas, working in partnership with the two unitary authorities to deliver the devolved investment."
