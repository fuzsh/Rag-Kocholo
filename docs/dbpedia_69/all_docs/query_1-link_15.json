        "text": "4.1. Local priorities and outcomes\n\nDarlington Borough Council is an ambitious organisation with a clear and powerful focus on economic growth. The vision for the place and the priorities attached to that are outlined in the Council Plan for 2020-23 and they resonate well with senior staff and public sector partners. A new Local Plan was adopted earlier this year which gives a strategic direction for the development of the Borough and the council has been successful in securing a number of funding interventions, including £23.3m from the Government’s Towns Fund Programme. The focus on economic growth has been successful in helping the council to attract new investment, jobs and housing growth in the Borough. The council has already delivered several high-profile ‘hard’ infrastructure projects such as the £1.78m bowling alley at the Dolphin Centre; the construction of Feethams House and Multi Story Car Park at a cost of £16m to provide Grade A office space; the DL1 leisure scheme that includes a cinema, hotel, restaurants and commercial premises; and £1.14m of improvements to the public realm around Darlington’s Railway station. Furthermore, significant notable private sector investments have taken place including a new Amazon fulfilment centre.\n\nGoing forward, there continues to be a big and exciting regeneration programme in the pipeline with schemes such as the £1.96m Linear Park project as part of the Town Deal, the Treasury Campus to accommodate 1,500 civil service positions, private rented residential units and affordable homes scheme in the town centre, the £7.7m Northern Echo and Library investment to support education and adult skills as well as new office space, and other such investments into town centre refurbishments. There are also exciting plans to celebrate the 200-year anniversary of the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 2025 which will see the Darlington Railway Heritage Quarter developed into a new internationally significant major visitor attraction and museum.\n\nThese schemes are all very positive and will transform the local economy and Darlington as a place. However, whilst the council has its council Plan where progress is reported every 6 months to Cabinet, what is not clearly coming out at present is an understanding of how all the projects fit into the bigger plans for Darlington and what outcomes they will bring to the area and its residents. There is, therefore, great scope to link this success in regenerating the place to the wider social and environmental objectives of the council such as tackling the challenges of deprivation, health inequality and climate change.\n\nSharpening the focus around ‘soft’ infrastructure and by making a stronger connection between ‘place’ and ‘people’ the council can create greater social value and demonstrate the tangible impact it is making on improving the quality of life and positively impacting on reducing health inequalities of local people. For example, investments in skills development, employment support, local and sustainable procurement, focused planning policies, etc should complement the investment and opportunities being created through new buildings and office spaces. Enabling local people to connect into those opportunities through clear pathways to new skills, jobs and business opportunities will ensure local jobs and business opportunities are more likely to be better accessible to local people. These are all key determinants of health that will improve over time the inequalities that currently exist.\n\nThere are some excellent examples of projects on the ground (for example, Northgate initiative, The Bread-and-Butter Thing, Healthy Town Initiative, an impressive events programme to increase town centre footfall, etc) which make the connection between strategy and delivery and between ‘place’ and ‘people’, but this needs to be done through a strategic framework to ensure that the whole council and its partners are making these connections on a systematic basis. Furthermore, the learning from these successful initiatives need to be embedded in revised council policies and the Levelling Up Darlington Plan.\n\nThe relationships between vision, strategy and benefits to local communities could be further strengthened by developing a ‘Darlington Story’ as part of the Levelling Up Darlington Plan to help local communities better understand what it is that the council and its partners are trying to achieve and how the investments will translate into local areas and into the lives of local communities. This story should then be communicated through simple messaging so that people can understand what their responsibilities to the Borough are and how they fit into its future.\n\nThis may require strengthening outcome targets and performance measures against ambitions to demonstrate how the vision, priorities and projects are delivering real outcomes for local communities. The Council currently has a comprehensive performance monitoring system in place with twice yearly reporting and scrutiny, but information is contained in large complex documents. Consideration should be given to how headline performance data on key performance measures and the delivery of Council priorities are presented in easy to digest format (such as a traffic light system that the Council has used previously) which Members, partners and residents can readily access, understand and easily see the difference the Council is making.\n\n4.2. Organisational and place leadership\n\nDarlington Borough Council is well led both politically and managerially. The relatively new Administration and senior executive team have gelled well and led the organisation through testing times whilst delivering good quality services during the pandemic.\n\nTogether, the Cabinet and senior executive team provide a powerful and clear focus on economic growth. It is using this to develop a wider place shaping agenda to help deliver the Levelling Up Darlington Plan. Developing a strong narrative about the future of Darlington and communicating this through clear and consistent messaging, engagement and communication with residents, businesses, and strategic partners will help to consolidate the Council’s place leadership role and secure sustained buy-in to its ambitions and priorities. This means promoting, sharing and agreeing with key stakeholders how the Borough is being developed, the kind of economy the Borough wants to foster, and the outcomes people can expect to see in the short, medium, and long terms. On the regional and sub-regional level, there are opportunities for the Council to maximise influence for Darlington by playing a fuller role through, for example, the development of the Integrated Care system across the North East and acting as a conduit between North Yorkshire and Durham and the Tees Valley. There is also an opportunity for the council to leverage resources and capacity from the Tees Valley Combined Authority by strengthening its role and engagement and working more closely to align its ambitions with those of the region. This kind of alignment can help to both influence investment decisions and position the Borough to benefit from them.\n\nThe Council has already delivered an impressive regeneration programme in the Borough and has very good relationships with its public sector partners through the Public Sector Executive Group, but its ambitions for sustainable economic growth going forward will require a much deeper relationship with some of the other key local strategic partners and the local community. This includes broadening and strengthening the Council’s strategic partnership working to include the business community, as well as the community and voluntary sector so that the capacity of all partners is being harnessed in delivering the ambitions for Darlington.\n\nThere is real appetite among the local business, community and voluntary sectors to work with the Council to co-produce solutions to local challenges, including engaging with local communities. This opportunity should be grasped.\n\nOverall, the Council delivers good standard of core services and is performing at or above average in many areas in comparison to other unitary councils. The latest OFSTED inspection into Children’s Services determined that “young people are benefiting from long-standing, trusting relationships with workers who are emotionally invested in them. Workers provide agile and tailored support which is adapted to care leavers’ individual circumstances. This relational approach is underpinned by very strong corporate parenting support, influence and investment. A comprehensive local offer, combined with a plethora of creative and generous opportunities from the wider council and its partners, is contributing to positive outcomes for care leavers”.\n\n4.3. Governance and culture\n\nDarlington is a well-run Council with all the necessary decision-making, governance and risk management arrangements in place. The Cabinet is providing political leadership and the Leader is supported by seven Cabinet Members with portfolios aligned to the priorities of the Council. The senior executive team provides strategic and managerial leadership with the Chief Executive supported by three Executive Directors leading a group of services. The senior executive team is supported by the Chief Officers’ Board consisting of Assistant Directors with service level responsibilities.\n\nThe Council feels like a passionate and creative place with committed and dedicated staff at all levels who are proud of working for Darlington. The peer team found Darlington Borough Council to be a very open and honest organisation that listens and acts upon feedback. The culture of the organisation is welcoming and engaging, and people are working together to get things done and deliver good quality services to their local communities. The energy, commitment and structured ways of working among Chief Officers’ Board is very impressive. The peer team would encourage these structured ways of working to be replicated at the middle manager levels too.\n\nOverall, there are good working relationships between Members and officers. Nevertheless, there is room to strengthen these by clarifying policy setting verses strategy/operational delivery expectations. Consideration could be given to a review on, for example:\n\nAn agreed approach for receiving, fielding and responding to Member enquiries with response times\n\nProducing all Member briefings on key issues to encourage engagement.\n\nAppropriate training and development for Members and officers in collaborative and joint working to support them working in their Wards. Elected Members at Darlington Borough Council are committed, engaged, and embedded in their local communities. This Member capacity can be further utilised by providing more structured support to them in their roles and meeting their skills and development needs. They have the capacity to provide active community leadership and become forceful ambassadors for the area. Similarly, staff (64.5% of whom live in Darlington) can also be very good local ambassadors who can be used effectively to send positive messages out into local communities and start making that link between what is being delivered on regeneration and the opportunities this presents to local communities. This capacity can be further maximised.\n\nOverview and scrutiny is provided through five Scrutiny Committees - mirroring Cabinet portfolios. There are structured work programmes for overview and scrutiny and the process is well supported by council officers. The overview and scrutiny structure in the Council provides a mechanism for enabling effective challenge; however, it is not clear how all Members can access it. Going forward, training on scrutiny and review should be refreshed to ensure more active engagement from a wider group of Members. The Council has a corporate equality policy which sets out a vision and framework to meet the public sector equality duty and has a dedicated equalities officer in post. Underpinning this is a group of advisors representing each service area to advise on equality impact assessments, highlighting emerging external and internal equality matters, and helping to identify solutions to problems.\n\nA bespoke equality and diversity training programme for staff and Members is being delivered to help ensure equality and diversity is considered when developing strategies, policies and operational procedures. The Council should build on these foundations to ensure that all groups benefit from not just investments in services but also the economy and access to education, training and good quality jobs – including those within the Council. Furthermore, because of the relatively small number of people from black and minority ethnic backgrounds in the Borough (probably with weak community support structures) there is potential for these groups to experience higher levels of vulnerabilities. The peer team would ask the Council to be mindful of this and put in place efforts to proactively reach out to people from these groups. No one should be left behind.\n\n4.4. Financial planning and management\n\nThe Council has robust financial planning and management, with all the associated risk management and safeguards, in place. It appears to have robust budget monitoring processes and generally manages spend within budget. Members receive regular and detailed reports on both the revenue budgets, the capital programme and progress on individual capital schemes. There is an organisational risk register and a functioning Audit Committee in place which provides the necessary challenge and assurance. However, the Committee’s status and profile should be raised to increase engagement in response to the recommendations in the Redmond Review.\n\nFinancially the Council seems reasonably secure and robust in relation to the local government sector as a whole. The Council currently has a healthy General Fund balance and has been increasing its General Fund earmarked reserves, to be utilised and be released over the life of the medium-term financial plan in the current council model to allow time for the positive financial impacts of the economic growth strategy to materialise.\n\nNevertheless, rapid inflation, increase in demand for social care services, greater economic uncertainty and the very recent intervention by Natural England on Nutrient Neutrality mean the Council, will need to review the assumptions of the Medium-Term Financial Plan to ensure that there is a sound understanding by all about the risks of whether the model materially changes and to understand the impact on the planned use of reserve.\n\nThis will require a greater emphasis on system-wide transformation working with partners based on priority outcomes, for example, supporting independent living for vulnerable adults to close any potential gaps. The positive experience of the implementation of Leeds’ Family Valued approach across Children’s Services and the lessons learned from this programme should be considered for application more broadly across the Council’s services to help harness assets in communities and reduce demand more generally.\n\nThe Council has a successful shared services partnership with Stockton Borough Council through Xentrall to deliver key back office transactional services. There is potential to explore further commerciality and organisational efficiencies alongside traditional approaches to deliver effective and productive resource management to build up greater financial resilience.\n\n4.5. Capacity for improvement\n\nDarlington Borough Council is in a good place and is using its resources, assets and capacity well. The positivity and commitment of staff provides a strong platform for continued improvements, and the progress already made with limited resources is impressive. Nevertheless, there is a huge agenda to deliver and opportunities to grasp which will make demands on its resources and staff capacity. Both these need to be utilised in the most creative ways.\n\nThe infectious enthusiasm of staff could be further harnessed by focusing more on active engagement, particularly on the Council’s plans for Levelling Up Darlington. Staff at all levels need to have a depth of understanding of what they Council is trying to achieve and how it will go about doing it. They need to be clear on what their responsibilities are and what role they can play within their service areas. They also need to be aware of the outcomes the Council is trying to achieve for the ‘place’ and ‘people’ so that they can use their creativity to help deliver these.\n\nThe peer team would therefore suggest that the Council maintain a comprehensive organisational development programme which should include paying more attention to internal staff communication, more cross-service and organisational working, elevating and sharing existing good practice, and developing creative solutions to support recruitment and retention. In addition, it should also explore scope for greater collaboration outside the organisation, for example, working with large employers around shared workforce planning. With the move of some staff from central government departments to working in Darlington, there is an opportunity to build further on the already strong links between the Council and those departments to ensure a greater level of understanding of what local authorities are facing, especially with treasury colleagues. Being in such a unique position could pose both an opportunity and a threat to the Council and so consideration needs to be given to building strong engagement as early as possible to explore the mutual benefits of having all public sector strands together. Furthermore, there could be some unique opportunities around staff recruitment and retention for both central and local government that could also improve mutual understanding and the peer team would encourage the Council to explore these.\n\nOther specific focus areas\n\nThe Council recognises that it needs to broaden its conversation with residents to improve engagement and communication. It already has a good range of external communication channels, including the ‘One Darlington’ magazine which is valued by residents and partners, and the Council’s presence on social media is improving. Nevertheless, more needs to be done to bring in a level of co-ordination and consistency to ensure that the right messages are reaching the right people at the right time in the most effective way.\n\nAt present there is a corporate communications and marketing team within the Council and an overarching ‘marketing, communications & engagement strategy’ has been drafted. In addition, there are several ‘communication staff’ dispersed throughout departments doing some impressive work in communicating and engaging with residents, staff and customers. However, not all of this is sighted, captured and promoted corporately nor is it clear how this work is co-ordinated and managed across departments.\n\nGiven Darlington’s strategy of inclusive growth and the opportunities this now presents for the town and the Council, it can no longer take a piecemeal approach to communication and marketing as the successful outcomes of its economic growth agenda depends very much on how the Borough is presented to residents, partners, visitors and potential investors; and how effectively they can place themselves in the changes taking place and the opportunities the Borough is offering. Furthermore, the town will be competing for investment, visitors, and people to live there - and the Council will be competing for a skilled workforce – so the need to tell a compelling Darlington story becomes all the more important.\n\nThe emerging ‘marketing, communication & engagement strategy’ provides an opportunity to take a more coordinated and systematic approach to this area of work and the peer team would encourage completing this as a priority. It also provides an opportunity to:\n\na) Review the communications and marketing resources across the Council to determine if they are being deployed in the most effective way to ensure co-ordination, consistency and corporate messaging.\n\nb) Boost internal Member and staff communication and engagement as part of the organisational development programme to ensure everyone understands their roles and responsibilities in delivering the vision and priorities of the Council. c) Develop a compelling narrative, with partners and local people, as to how economic growth brings benefits to residents and demonstrate how the Council is delivering on its vision for local people.\n\nd) Change external perceptions of Darlington as it has unique characteristics which place it apart from the rest of Tees Valley and the Council should consider how the Borough is marketed and promoted to a global audience, particularly to maximise the potential of the 200th anniversary of the Town’s rail heritage in 2025."
