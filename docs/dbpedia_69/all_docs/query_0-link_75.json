        "text": "Darlington town centre is diversifying. Lots of people already walk, wheel and cycle in the town centre, but in some places, routes could be improved.\n\nWe want to know what you think about the transport issues in the town centre and your ideas for making bus, walking, wheeling, and cycling journeys more attractive. This could include reviewing bus stops, improving signage, and delivering dedicated spaces for people walking, wheeling, and cycling. We have also started to think about an improvement to the cycle network at East Street and want to know what you think of our plans.\n\nDarlington town centre is an important destination for shoppers, workers, and visitors. Important locations in the vicinity of the town centre include Darlington Rail Station, Queen Elizabeth Sixth Form College, and Darlington Memorial Hospital. Other popular destinations are the Cornmill Shopping Centre, the Dolphin Centre, and the Darlington Hippodrome.\n\nDarlington is growing, with plans for new homes and jobs, including at West Park. At Beaumont Hill, 370 homes are also planned with a new primary school. Some homes have already been built at Berrymead Gardens and Coatham Vale. This means there will be more journeys in the future, making roads busier.\n\nOur vision for Darlington town centre\n\nFor an enlarged version of the map, please click here.\n\nDarlington Borough Council has ambitious plans to improve the town centre. Earlier this year, work was completed to transform Duke Street, adding a dedicated cycle lane and widening pavements to make it easier to walk, wheel and cycle. There are also plans to improve Skinnergate and Darlington’s yards and to create a pedestrian zone in Coniscliffe Road, using Government funding.\n\nWe want to add to these improvements to create a safer, convenient, and reliable network for all journeys in the town centre.\n\nCurrent transport issues in Darlington town centre\n\nWe want to improve the transport choices available. We think there are opportunities to make journeys in Darlington safer and more enjoyable, and empower more people to walk, wheel, cycle, or take the bus, especially for shorter trips.\n\nMany people already walk, wheel, cycle or catch the bus to the town centre. However, in some places improvements could be made. Buses travelling through the town centre need to follow the one-way route. While there is limited scope to update bus routes, kerb space and bus waiting areas in the town centre could be reviewed to ensure waiting areas are more attractive and conflicts are reduced. This could contribute to making bus journeys more attractive.\n\nLook at the issues and opportunities we have identified in Darlington town centre by clicking below. We have also started to think about how we can improve the cycle network at East Street, we are proposing to introduce a new crossing and safer route. Let us know what you think about our plan."
