It used to be North Yorkshire, then Cleveland, then Teesside, then Cleveland again (or something like this pattern). They still use \"Cleveland\" to give it a location, though. For example, 'Cleveland Police', 'BBC Radio Cleveland' etc. Some places use Teesside, though, such as 'Teesside Magistrates'. Middlesbrough is a messed up town anyway. It sucks!\n\nI'm saddened at the fact that, in a month, I have to venture back up there to live back at home since my university life will be over I want to stay in Manchester, but I have Â£300 to last me! VILE!\n\nMiddlesbrough is getting a lot better, though.\n\nEdit:\n\nHere is a list of all the unitary authorities in England, that is, towns or areas which aren't governed by a regional government. Link...\n\nAlthough Teesside seems to have been replaced by Tees Valley now. Is this an attempt to get away from the smog stained image of Teesside?"
