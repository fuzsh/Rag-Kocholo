        "text": "The next group of leaders in the city of Darlington were sworn into office at Tuesday night's ceremony at City Hall.\n\nMayor Curtis Boyd was recognized as he took on his second term.\n\nThe three at-large city council members who won November's election, Bryan Gardner, Angela McRavin, and John Milling, also claimed their seats with pride.\n\nMcRavin is the newly elected Darlington city councilwoman and said she is excited to honor her community.\n\nRELATED:\n\nI am looking forward to helping to bring some unity to our city and to our council. Government transparency is one thing I am really big on and making certain that are citizens are informed and that we keep them abreast of whatâ€™s going on in the city, and as well as being there voice.\n\nWith Mayor Boyd entering his second term he said he plans to work harder and thanked the city of Darlington for having his back through the entire process.\n\nTrusted officials were in attendance and gave prayers and words of encouragement to the all-city council members.\n\nBoyd said he has a lot in store for the city of Darlington, and informed community members some new projects may be completed by the end of 2024.\n\nWe have a master plan. We have multiple projects going on with the splash pad, the new sports complex along with the Blue Street ballfield being remodeled that should hopefully be done by the end of this year, along with a lot more infrastructure.\n\nThe next regular meeting of Darlington City Council will take place on Tuesday, Feb. 6."
