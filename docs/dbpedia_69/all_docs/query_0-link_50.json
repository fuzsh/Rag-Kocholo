        "text": "New government plans could lead to a housing boom in Darlington and County Durham, aiming to build 1.5 million new homes nationwide.\n\nLocal councils must now use standardised methods to assess and plan for housing needs, allowing reductions only in cases of substantial constraints.\n\nPrevious changes that had reduced housing supply will now be reversed, and priority will be given to developing brownfield and grey belt land in a move that Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner described as \"a radical plan to not only get the homes we desperately need, but also drive the growth, create jobs and breathe life back into towns and cities.\"\n\nData for North East authorities highlights an expected increase in housing needs.\n\nMost read\n\nMiddlesbrough: The Range set to come to Parkway Centre\n\nSmoggie Queens: Film crews set up at Egglescliffe School\n\nVaseline can be used to keep rats away from gardens\n\nUnlock unlimited local news for just £6 for 6 months today.

Over recent years, an average of 8,466.32 homes annually have been constructed.\n\nSpecifically, County Durham's housing targets are expected to rise significantly from 1,128.80 to 2,209.65 homes/year. The authority is already building 1,572 homes annually.\n\nMeanwhile, Darlington sees an increase of target from 152.22 to 500.24 homes/year.\n\nCurrently in Darlington 512 homes are built on average per year, which is slightly higher than the Government's new target.\n\nLike Darlington, current housing development in Middlesbrough is already close to the new requirements.\n\nOther North East councils, such as Northumberland and South Tyneside must significantly boost their housing development to meet the proposed needs."
