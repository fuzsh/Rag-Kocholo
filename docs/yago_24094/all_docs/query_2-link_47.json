The gandharvas refer to a category of vyantaras gods which represents one of the four classes of celestial beings (devas). The gandharvas have a golden appearance according to the Digambaras and the Tumbaru tree is their caitya-vṛkṣa (sacred-tree). They have a blackish complexion and are beautiful in appearance, have excellent physiognomy, sweet voices and are adorned with crowns and neckalces according to the Śvetāmbaras.\n\nThe deities such as the Huhū are defined in ancient Jain cosmological texts such as the Saṃgrahaṇīratna in the Śvetāmbara tradition or the Tiloyapaṇṇati by Yativṛṣabha (5th century) in the Digambara tradition.\n\ncontext information\n\nJainism is an Indian religion of Dharma whose doctrine revolves around harmlessness (ahimsa) towards every living being. The two major branches (Digambara and Svetambara) of Jainism stimulate self-control (or, shramana, ‘self-reliance’) and spiritual development through a path of peace for the soul to progess to the ultimate goal.\n\nDiscover the meaning of huhu in the context of General definition from relevant books on Exotic India\n\nLanguages of India and abroad\n\nSanskrit dictionary\n\nSource: DDSA: The practical Sanskrit-English dictionary\n\nHuhu (हुहु) or Huhū (हुहू) or Hūhū (हूहू).—m.
