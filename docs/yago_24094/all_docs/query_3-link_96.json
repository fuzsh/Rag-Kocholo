        "text": "Advertisement\n\nThe King of Thailand yesterday made a rare public appearance at his cousin's funeral as he left the hospital where he has been staying for more than two years.\n\nKing Bhumibol Adulyadej, 84, ventured out in a wheelchair to bid farewell to Princess Bejaratana Rajasuda in an opulent cremation ceremony in Bangkok.\n\nThe world's longest reigning monarch wore the traditional white royal uniform and a black armband as he left Siriraj hospital, which he has rarely left since he was first admitted for a respiratory condition in September 2009.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nOpulent: The royal chariot bearing the urn of Princess Bejaratana Rajasuda Sirisobhabannavadi is pulled through Bangkok\n\nThe frail king appeared alongside his wife Queen Sirikit, with the couple lighting candles and incense at a special royal crematorium at the Sanam Luang ceremonial ground. He was due to return to hospital after the memorial service.\n\nMonks in saffron robes and high-ranking officials including Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra looked on as more than 200 men pulled a gilded teak chariot carrying the princess's remains in a golden urn.\n\nPrincess Bejaratana died from a blood infection at the age of 85 in July last year, and had lain in state at the Dusit Maha Prasart Throne Hall in the Grand Palace ever since.\n\nYesterday was declared a public holiday in memory of the princess, who was the only child of the late King Vajiravudh.\n\nFarewell: Thai officials pay last respects to the princess before unloading the urn from a carriage. The only child of King Vajiravudh (Rama VI) had been lying in state since she died in July 2011 at the age of 85"
