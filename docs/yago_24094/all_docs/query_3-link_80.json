        "text": "Formerly the site of John Sampson & Son department store during the reign of King Rama VI, this three-level neoclassical architecture is now home to the most comprehensive exhibition on His Majesty King Prajadhipok (Rama VII) and the modern history of Thai politics.\n\nThe Democracy Monument was erected on 24 June 1939—seven years to the day after the 1932 Siamese Revolution—to commemorate the political event that changed the face of Siam, and later Thailand. Located at the center of Ratchadamnoen Road, which was the most important avenue at the time, the monument was built in reference to a winning design by Poom Malakul. Its production was closely monitored by Italian-born artist, Silpa Bhirasi.\n\nPhayathai Palace was originally the recreational home of King Chulalongkorn Rama V. It later became the summer palace of his wife, Queen Saowabha, and later his son, King Vajiravudh Rama VI, who transformed the vacation home into a fancy Italian Renaissance-inspired villa. When King Vajiravudh moved to the palace in 1919, he installed a “miniature city” called Dusit Thani—a playground where the monarch and his entourage role-played as members of a civic state—on the massive space behind the main building.\n\nAlso called the Constitution Defense Monument, Laksi Monument was erected in Laksi Circle 1936 in remembrance of the soldiers who died in the 1933 Bowaradet Rebellion. But recently, the monument was secretly removed from its location and never re-installed. No one, not even the authorities, seems to know where it is.\n\nThe historic Ratchadamnoen Road is unarguably the most important passage in the old quarter of Bangkok. Commissioned by King Rama V following his 1897 European trip, it was styled after Champs Elysees in Paris and was meant to link the Grand Palace to the then new Dusit Palace. The long road has historically been the site of various demonstrations and rallies, including the 14 October 1973 uprising to the more recent pro-Thaksin rallies.\n\nThammasat University is the second oldest university in Thailand, founded by respected statesman and politician Pridi Banomyong on 27 June 1934 to instil legal and political knowledge within Thais following the Siamese Revolution. Thammasat is best known for its programs in law, economics, political sciences, and mass communications."
