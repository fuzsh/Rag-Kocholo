Recently  she has been pictured wearing Princess Bejaratana's emerald set  which comprises of a necklace and a brooch that can also be worn as a pendant. Princess Bejaratana was the only child of King Vajiravudh  Rama VI  and Princess Suvadhana. As far as I know she did not marry and did not have children of her own  so her jewelry probably reverted back to the main line after her death. It remains to be seen if more of her jewelry will be worn by the Noble Consort.      img src  https   i.imgur.com KPXGfGK.jpg  border 0    img src  https   i.imgur.com ipNSUeC.jpg  border 0    img src  https   i.imgur.com JBA7EBF.jpg  border 0",
