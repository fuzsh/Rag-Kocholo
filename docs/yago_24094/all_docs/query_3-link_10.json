        "text": "Prajadhipok, regnal name Rama VII, is the King of Siam, he is the seventh monarch from the House of Chakri.\n\nPrajadhipok was born on 8 November 1893 in Bangkok as Somdet Chaofa Prajadhipok Sakdidej (His Royal Highness Prince Prajadhipok Sakdidej) to King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) and his half sister-consort Queen Saovabha Phongsri. He was the youngest of seven children born to the couple and the king's second-youngest child, bring the 33rd and youngest of Chulalongkorn's sons. He ascended to the throne upon the death of Vajiravudh, his elder, full brother on 25 November 1925.\n\nBiography[]\n\nEarly life[]\n\nPrajadhipok is the youngest son of King Chulalongkorn (out of a total of 77) the seventh and last children to be born from the union between Chulalongkorn and his half sister-consort Saovabha Phongsri.\n\nUnlikely to succeed to the throne, Prince Prajadhipok chose to pursue a military career. Like many of the king's children, he was sent abroad to study, going to Eton College in 1906, then to the Woolwich Military Academy from which he graduated in 1913. He received a commission in the Royal Horse Artillery in the British Army based in Aldershot. In 1910 Chulalongkorn died and was succeeded by Prajadhipok's older brother, Crown Prince Vajiravudh, who became King Rama VI. Prince Prajadhipok was by then commissioned in both the British Army and the Royal Siamese Army. With the outbreak of the Weltkrieg and the declaration of Siamese neutrality, Vajiravudh ordered his younger brother to resign his British commission and return to Siam immediately, a great embarrassment to the prince, who wanted to serve with his men on the Western front. Once home, Prajadhipok became a high-ranking military official in Siam. In 1917 he was ordained temporarily as a monk, as was customary for most Buddhist Siamese men."
