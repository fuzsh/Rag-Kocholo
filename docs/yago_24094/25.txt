Noble Consort Sineenat has resumed royal duties after her pardon by the King. Recently, she has been pictured wearing Princess Bejaratana's emerald set, which comprises of a necklace and a brooch that can also be worn as a pendant. Princess Bejaratana was the only child of King Vajiravudh (Rama VI) and Princess Suvadhana. As far as I know she did not marry and did not have children of her own, so her jewelry probably reverted back to the main line after her death. It remains to be seen if more of her jewelry will be worn by the Noble Consort.
