In November 1957, mother and daughter moved back to Thailand. They bought a piece of land on Sukhumvit Road Soi 38, and build the Ruenruedi Villa Palace, which is still the home of the princess. Once the princess had settled into her new life in Thailand, she proceeded to undertake her Royal Duties representing the Thai Royal Family. Her special interests have been in connection to education, public health, Buddhism, the soldiers and police stationed at Thailand 's borders, and general public welfare.

Thailand's frail king makes rare public appearance at his cousin's funeral as 200 men pull her urn through Bangkok on royal chariot

The King of Thailand yesterday made a rare public appearance at his cousin's funeral as he left the hospital where he has been staying for more than two years. King Bhumibol Adulyadej, 84, ventured out in a wheelchair to bid farewell to Princess Bejaratana Rajasuda in an opulent cremation ceremony in Bangkok. The world's longest reigning monarch wore the traditional white royal uniform and a black armband as he left Siriraj hospital, which he has rarely left since he was first admitted for a respiratory condition in September 2009.
