        "text": "Evidently, it’s hoped that holiday goers and travellers will be packing their trusty Switch into their hand luggage, as it’s a curiously busy week for everyone’s favourite handheld hybrid.\n\nNintendo continues its monthly first-party drop with the Tantalus-developed 3DS remaster Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD. While reviews are mostly positive (the Metacritic currently sits at 78%) some critics were saddened by the lack of new content while the majority agreed that Luigi’s Mansion 3 is superior in every way. As conversions go though, it sounds like a polished package – the menus and HUDs have been redone to match the 1080p (docked) image quality. “It’s just a super-sharp, clean looking game from top to bottom,” said Eurogamer.\n\nHopefully, sales of Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD won’t prevent Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble from becoming a success. This is the first new Monkey Ball game in twelve years, and fans had to prove to SEGA that there’s a demand by purchasing the last couple of re-releases. The Metacritic is currently a respectable 77% with several reviews clocking in at 8/10. However, some critics suggest that expectations should be lowered – this isn’t an evolution of the franchise. VGC also noted performance issues and a “sparse” multiplayer mode.\n\nWe aren’t done with big name releases yet, as Ubisoft’s Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition is out now, first announced barely a week ago. Reviews are starting to go live, with reports that it’s a serviceable re-release, although it’s prone to stuttering and showing its age in a few areas. At £18 though, anyone who missed out on the original should certainly take a look. For the younger generation, BG&E was released during a busy Christmas period on the likes of PS2 and GameCube and never managed to find a foothold despite being praised.\n\nThen there’s Bandai-Namco’s anime tie-in SPY×ANYA: Operation Memories – a photography-based escapade with mini-games and fashion/dressing up elements – and a belated release of the tropical open-world adventure Tchia.\n\nAtari’s back too with their Sprint revival NeoSprint – a top-down racer with four player support, a track editor, and a campaign mode. Defunct Games reviewed it on their YouTube channel, and found much to enjoy.\n\nWe’ve reviewed a couple of new releases ourselves. Frogun ENCORE is a standalone spin-off of the 2022 PSone-style 3D platformer, offering a bunch of new stages and bosses, and some extra challenges. The difficulty level is perfectly pitched, becoming progressively tougher, and at around 3-4 hours it doesn’t overstay its welcome. It remains an ‘old skool’ affair though, with nothing groundbreaking to offer. Go Go Jump!! meanwhile provides a bunch of jumping-based challenges, each requiring memorisation and timing skills. There’s a story and hub world to tie it together, plus Survival and Challenge modes. It looks nice too, with vibrant cartoony visuals.\n\nOther releases for this week include the pixel art top-down adventure Nocturnal Visitors – the first in a series, with the sequel already underway – an EGGCONSOLE release of the obscure racing/shooter hybrid Topple Zip, and the innovative looking FROGUE – a roguelike with bullet hell and platforming elements that’s also, somehow, turn based. There’s only one thing indie developers love more than cats, and that’s frogs.\n\nNew Switch eShop releases\n\nLuigi’s Mansion 2 HD – £49.99\n\nJoin the faint-of-heart hero Luigi on a spooky quest in Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD for Nintendo Switch.
