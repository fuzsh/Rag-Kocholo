        "text": "I have a mixed history with Polish studio Flying Wild Hog’s action games. I loved their debut title Hard Reset, which was an excellent entry in the “run-backwards-and-shoot” genre popularized by stuff like Serious Sam and Painkiller. I thought that Shadow Warrior was both a fun follow-up and a clever reboot of a wildly offensive and stupid game from the nineties.\n\nShadow Warrior 2 is where they really hit their stride — and where they may have peaked. It added a much larger world, a huge collection of weapons, randomly generated elements for replayability, and full co-op support alongside some of the fastest and most enjoyable combat ever in a first person shooter. It was an excessive sequel in the best possible way, and the bespoke engine powering it helped it to look incredible in spite of a modest production budget."
