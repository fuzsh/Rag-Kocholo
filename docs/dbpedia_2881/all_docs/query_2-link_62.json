        "text": "If you’ve been been waiting for news on the Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition you don’t have to wait much longer. Ubisoft announced via social media that more information on the game is coming on Thursday, June 20 as part of the Limited Run Games Showcase.\n\nThe showcase starts at 2pm ET on Thursday.\n\n“Looks like Uncle Pey’j has a message to share with you all… See you at the Limited Run Games Showcase on June 20th at 2pm EST for more news about Beyond Good & Evil – 20th Anniversary Edition,” Ubisoft said.\n\nRecently, the game’s trophies appeared online. It also came after early versions of the game were accidentally shared with players. The game is expected to launch sometime in 2024.\n\n“Swoop into the marvelous world of Hillys as action-reporter Jade to investigate the mysterious DomZ alien attacks alongside colorful characters, like her adoptive uncle Pey’j or the valiant Double H,” the game’s description reads.\n\n“Armed with her daï-jo and faithful camera, Jade’s adventure will get you to freely explore Hillys, combat creatures large and small, infiltrate dangerous areas, solve enigmatic puzzles, play addictive mini-games, race the best hovercraft pilots, and take pictures of the whole experience.”\n\nAs far as Beyond Good & Evil 2, that game remains in limbo with no update from Ubisoft in recent years. The last we learned about the game was that its studio went through shakeups with the game’s development struggling.\n\nAre you excited to see more of Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition?
