        "text": "I'd say very few people love that game. And if you got the impression that it was some massively popular thing, even with a niche audience at the time, then I'd say that it's just because this saga of its supposed sequel, and whether or not it was happening, have been going on for so long that people have just automatically grouped it together with the rest of the long time no-shows like Shenmue 3 and the like.\n\nFrom what I remember it was resonably hyped before its release, (mostly focused on the \"emotion\" in its story telling I want to say, but not 100% sure ) only to come out to mediocre reviews and low sales. I didn't pick it up myself right away but played it resonably close to its original release.\n\nLow points that I recall were simple puzzles in short and linear dungeons, shallow combat and annoying stealth sections. The high points were the varied and charming look of all the characters and their dialogue, collecting pictures of things was fun, the backing track to a racing mini game was quirky and weird, and I want to say that your hovercraft controlled well enough to make those sections and mini-games enjoyable.\n\nThe game's got a whole spiritualism + the world is a melting pot of different cultures and people of different races and walks of life in a near future setting and also there are humanoid animals angle going on too, which is...cool?\n\nIt's a cool game that I sorta like, but I also find the idea that time will forgive its faults because the rumor of a sequel have hung around for long enough to give the name legend status a bit off-putting.\n\nAs a kid there was a tonne of variety in a fun world. You didn't know what was coming next and the game kept you engaged as you never knew when you'd have a chance to get a pearl (for upgrades) or have a new photo opportunity! I wanted to go everywhere and do everything as it got me things!\n\nThe main character Jade is cool. She's looking after a bunch of orphans and scraping by as an independent reporter. You want her to succeed. There's a lot of jerks who are heroes in video games. It's refreshing to like a person you play as. The characters care about each other too.\n\nIt has a very memorable soundtrack and with action, stealth, light puzzles, racing, exploration, photography, mini games and even space battles nothing out stayed it's welcome at the time. Maybe that mini game with the shark...\n\nAt the time is key. And I could totally see why someone who was older and more discerning would see that none of the things the game did was great. You can totally pick apart all of the elements for not being great!\n\nHowever, when ya mama won go, dere a place ya shud naw, Mammago's garage! It has the best garage of all time. There needs to be more Caribbean rhinos in games!\n\nThe longer time passes the memories get better while playing the game probably gets worse!\n\n@rebel_scum said:\n\nPlay Brutal Legend instead, its way better and a similar type of game.\n\nBrutal Legend may be better than BGE (that's a matter of taste I guess) but they are not at all similar types of game. I mean I guess they're both third person and sort of open world (BL much more then BGE) but otherwise they have very little in common.\n\nI only played some of BGE, and only on the Xbox 360 version, but I definitely 'got' what people loved about it. The music and aesthetics are fantastic. The characters are charming. The game is sort of zeldaish in both combat and world design (over world and dungeons) and there's just a ton of charm.\n\nThe photography was also very cool.\n\nThe one downside, depending on your preferences, is the stealth. I will admit that I am not much of a stealth gamer and it did turn me off, but it wasn't poorly done and if you're into stealth the whole package would be very appealing.\n\nIt's one of those games I always mean to get back to (and would start from the beginning) and with a sequel in the works I just might actually do that.\n\nI only remember the ending and the beginning and some stealth. The beginning to me was very strong, first time running around the overworld was fun. While I don't know for sure, for me it was sort of Reverse Golden Eye Syndrome, as in I didn't have consoles at the time and this was an experience on the PC which was kind of unique, an analogue to Windwaker maybe. By the same token people who had played things like Windwaker and Pokemon snap might be quick to dismiss it.\n\nI think they did a lot of interesting stuff with the 3rd person action adventure game, but probably the sum was greater than each individual part.\n\nI also remember this emblematic song that plays in a bar.\n\nLoading Video...\n\nIf you wanted Zelda but not Zelda, I guess this was as good as you got it until Okami came out. You'd think it was this amazing game from the cult following, but it came out after Wind Waker and isn't half the game that is, in neither quality nor content. I picked it up when I got a ps2 for the first time during the wii era to see what I missed, and the best thing about it is that awesome soundtrack(dancing with domz is on my phone right now) and some pretty good characters (there are only two main ones total, I'd say, Jade and the pig. It's not a long game).\n\nI wish it didn't end on a cliffhanger.\n\nLike some others here, I'm not sure I like the historical narrative being changed to BG&E being a poorly received game that some people liked for some reason (ala Deadly Premonition). I remember very vividly that BG&E was something of a critical darling, was on countliss lists of \"games you should be playing\", and its low sales were seen as a failure of the game buying public rather than of the game. Something more like Okami or Psychonauts.\n\nAs to why people liked it, I can only offer that it has an assload of personality and styyyle. Interesting likeable characters, great music, an original setting, and a diverse set of gameplay mechanics. The gameplay was flawed then and its flaws have not gotten any less noticeable today, but it has always been just a cool fucking game.\n\nI don't have an astounding answer it's just a good game, the world is a fun place to see, gameplay is simple and not really overly challenging, upgrading the hovercraft is a fun way to build up to the final levels, i guess it's worth remembering that at the time games were either trying to start the grey/brown realism era, or were kid friendly platformers trying to survive on high powered hardware. Beyond Good & Evil came along and had a stylish and vibrant world to explore, while mixing up gameplay so it wasn't just another basic platformer, it had a bit of depth to its systems, to make a mistake in certain situations was dangerous and it was up to the player to find objectives through exploration.\n\nAgain, i don't think it's mind blowing or a piece of genius art, but it was definitely unique at the time and deserves some praise.\n\nIf you like games of the time i recommend playing it yourself, it has a lot of vocal haters which tend to put people off playing it.\n\nRemember when it came free with cheese?\n\nI played it when the HD edition came out on 360. It has really clunky camera controls (which can be particularly annoying for a game with stealth elements). But the combat and platforming is solid, if nothing spectacular, and it's absolutely bubbling over with character. It's bright and colourful and has a great soundtrack (see \"Propaganda\" that was posted earlier) and the whole experience was very memorable, to me at least.\n\nIt feels like a game that's very easy to love because of its striking art style and character designs. The actual mechanics were perhaps a little lacking, but that's something which is likely easier to fix for a second game than a lack of character or a boring setting - which is probably why so many people were eager to see them take another shot at it.\n\nI agree with the answer you've chosen as the best answer TC, but I'd also like to talk up the world's charm as well. I played it on the GC about 5 years ago.\n\nWhat I liked so much about Beyond Good and Evil was that the character relations seemed so authentic. The game starts out in an orphanage where the two characters Jade (human woman) and Pey'j (pig man) looks after young children of many different races that have had their parents pass away due to the antagonists (the Domz) attacks on the planet. So it starts immediately grabbed me due to this noble sort of motivations from the main characters. After that, it becomes more about the conspiracy around who the Domz really are.\n\nI'd agree with the claims that the game-play being monotonous in terms of puzzle solving and stealth. (See this ol' one by none other than Jeff Gerstmann, http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/beyond-good-and-evil-review/1900-6085013/).\n\nIn closing, it was a varied game with sub-par, forgettable game-play (that controlled well) that also had a deeply interesting narrative with characters that acted in a way that was more multi-dimensional than typical video game protagonists."
