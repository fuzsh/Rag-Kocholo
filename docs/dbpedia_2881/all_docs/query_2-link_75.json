Can't wait for this and would be sick if they drop some BG&E2 references in this as well.\n\nSanTheSly\n\nThe San Symphony Project\n\nSep 2, 2019\n\n7,053\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nNov 28, 2023\n\n#48\n\nI always liked the opening of this game, but abandoned it an hour or two in. Finally played through the PC port back in 2019 or so, and I thought it was a little underwhelming when all was said and done.\n\nThere's a lot of charm, and I'm happy there's a remaster and easier way to play this coming seemingly very soon. I just don't think time will be as kind to BG&E1 as people would like it to be. Expecting a lot of takes along the lines of \"this isn't as good as I remember, sadly\"."
