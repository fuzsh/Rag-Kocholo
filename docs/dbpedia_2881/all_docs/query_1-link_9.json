        "text": "Michel Ancel is a name you may or may not know. Rayman, on the other hand, is a name that any gamer should know, and know well. The legless/armless/neckless hero took the world by storm in the early days of the Playstation, and continued to do so on just about every platform available. But good things must come to an end at some point, and after Rayman 2, series creator Michel Ancel abandoned the limb-lacking creature and started development on his latest masterpiece, Beyond Good and Evil.\n\nBeyond Good and Evil: a clever title on the search for truth, or a clever play on Nietzsche's book and his thoughts about the dangers in the pursuit of philosophical and scientific truth? Perhaps both. Set on the water-covered world of Hyllis, Beyond Good and Evil tells the story of Jade, an unassuming Hyllian who gets herself wrapped up in twisted tale of machination.\n\nWhen Hyllis is suddenly attacked by a mysterious alien race, Jade collapses in exhaustion from trying to defend her planet, and begins to have disturbing visions and dreams. After the planet is saved and the public is assured that the threat has been terminated, a rebel force convinces Jade to question her trust for the government and its declaration that Hyllis is once again safe and habitable. So begins Jade's journey towards the ultimate truth and the untangling of a delicate web of conspiracy.\n\nAt its core, Beyond Good and Evil is a third-person adventure game with action and vehicles interludes thrown into the mix. From what we've seen and played, the ratio of on-foot traversal and vehicular transportation seems to be about even. On foot, Jade will have to earn money by taking pictures of the different animal species found on Hyllis. The fact that Hyllis' population is composed almost entirely of creatures that are half man, half beast makes the emphasis of the job not finding the creatures, but taking pictures that will be acceptable. Like other snapshot-taking games, composition and pose will factor into the value of each photograph. Once Jade's roll of film is finished, she can receive an upgrade for her camera that will aid her in future photo opps. For example, Jade's first upgrade is a zoom lens that will become invaluable later in the game, as some of the creatures may be off in the distance.\n\nJade's ride is none other than a land/sea hovercraft. One of the first missions that she must complete is to destroy a flying alien worm/snake that is attacking the planet. At the start, the hovercraft can shoot standard gunfire, but by collecting pearls, she can buy upgrade parts. We didn't get a chance to see what sort of upgrades will be available, but a better selection of weapons is almost guaranteed. Also, the hovercraft can be used in the racing mini-games to earn a little extra cash. What, did you think street racing wouldn't exist in alternate universes? Speaking of mini-games, Beyond Good and Evil will have its share of amusing distractions, including a fully playable air hockey game that is more fun than one would imagine.\n\nIn our limited playtime with Beyond Good and Evil, it was difficult to get a sense of how the story will progress, but we did see that periodically, Jade will receive emails that will help guide her in the right direction. Also, if Jade spends a good amount of time not doing what she's supposed to, voiced audio cues will suggest that she be on her way. Luckily, the voice acting in the game is quite good, so constant audio reminders are not as irritating as they are in other games.\n\nThough Jade is the main protagonist in Beyond Good and Evil, following right on here heels is Page, her adopted uncle that is more pig than he is man. Yes, you read that correctly: Jade's uncle is a walking, talking pig. Page must be kept alive at all times, so players will have to plan their attacks and movements more carefully, not forgetting to take Page into the equation. But he is not helpless, and worse, useless. In fact, at set times in the game, Jade can issue attack commands for Page. For example, during one of the early boss fights, Jade can command Page to butt-stomp the bosses head while she moves in for the kill. It's like co-op play, only with one player. It's this sort of varied gameplay that help BG&E differentiate itself from your everyday cookie-cutter 3d platformer.\n\nOne of the Rayman games' most distinguishing features is their lush graphics. You really felt as if you were watching an animated adventure, rather than playing the latest and greatest videogame. With Beyond Good and Evil, Ancel's high standard for visual flare is in full force. The environments are vast and, more importantly, feel solid. There's a sense of hustle and bustle around the city, just like real city. Capturing the \"living\" feeling is often a difficult task to take on, but it appears as if PG&E's \"Jade\" graphics engine is more than capable for the job. Also noteworthy are the character designs, and overall theme of the graphics. At times surreal and other times just plain kooky, watching PG&E is at times comparable to watching a Jean-Pierre Jeunet film that has Miyazaki as the character designer (is the pig a homage?). Hmm. Two French men? We sense conspiracyâ€¦\n\nIn development for the last three years, Beyond Good and Evil takes many familiar elements and concepts and creates its own unique mesh of storytelling and gameplay. Scheduled for release this holiday season on all major platforms, BG&E feels more like a work of art rather than a videogame. We'll have more details and impressions from the game as E3 continues.
