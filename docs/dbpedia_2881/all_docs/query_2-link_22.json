        "text": "Microsoft has listed the Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition on the Xbox Store ahead of an official announcement.\n\nThe updated release will feature 4K resolution at 60 FPS with “improved graphics, controls, and audio, along with brand-new autosave and cross-save features.” There will also be a new speedrun mode as well as updated achievements and new rewards for players.\n\n“Swoop into the marvelous world of Hillys as action-reporter Jade to investigate the mysterious DomZ alien attacks alongside colorful characters, like her adoptive uncle Pey’j or the valiant Double H,” the game’s description reads.\n\n“Armed with her daï-jo and faithful camera, Jade’s adventure will get you to freely explore Hillys, combat creatures large and small, infiltrate dangerous areas, solve enigmatic puzzles, play addictive mini-games, race the best hovercraft pilots, and take pictures of the whole experience.”\n\nThere’s no release date listed nor is the game available for purchase yet. However, that information should be coming sooner rather than later.\n\nBeyond Good & Evil 2 has been in development for over a decade, but remains in development limbo with no sign of a release."
