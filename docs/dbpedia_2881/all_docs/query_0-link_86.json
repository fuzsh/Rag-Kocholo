        "text": "GameCentral readers discuss their favourite, and least favourite mini-games, from lock-picking and hacking to Blitzball.\n\nThe discussion point for this weekend’s Inbox was suggested by reader Purple Ranger. In this context mini-game means any part of a larger game that has completely different gameplay to the rest of it. So it also includes shore-horned in stealth sections and unlockable extra games that are otherwise completely separate.\n\nAlthough the consensus was slightly against mini-games in general, particularly hacking, most people could name a favourite or two, with Final Fantasy X’s Blitzball and Beyond Good & Evil’s hovercraft sections being particularly popular.\n\nOne of many\n\nI don’t know what the best mini-game ever is, but I’m sure you’ll find it in the original Super Monkey Ball on the GameCube. Forget the single-player mode, the real fun is to be had from the excellent quartet of Monkey Golf, Bowling, Billiards and Target (even Race and Fight are pretty good). All could shame their full price equivalents.\n\nBowling (the tenpin kind) and Billiards essentially strip things back to fairly basic controls so that anyone can enjoy them. But they also add subtle controls altering spin, power and pace so that better players can find hidden depth and challenge themselves against some of the most ruthlessly perfect opponents ever. Golf is a perfect mix of luck and skill-based gameplay.\n\nAnd then there’s monkey target. Essentially a game where you ski jump and then glide to a series of point scoring targets, it quickly becomes a just-one-more-go masterpiece. The controls are perfectly weighted and the risk versus reward style power-ups mean even the best and worse players have a shot of winning.\n\nYou can pick up a copy on eBay now for a fiver. When you consider each could easily keep you going a dozen hours or more, that’s great value. Not bad for extras that were only added to flesh out a game for a retail release whose only previous claim to fame was a banana shaped arcade stick!\n\nandy_b720 (PSN ID)\n\nBest of the worst\n\nMy least favourite mini-game by a country mile was planet-scanning on Mass Effect 2. It is incredibly dull and also so out of context with one of the best games of the generation, meaning that you end up despising it even more. If I had to push for a ‘favourite’ (I use this term loosely) mini-game, then the best for me was probably Sky Stones on Skylanders, which I played with my son.\n\nI will be blunt in saying that I am not a fan of mini-games. I think this is purely because they are not implemented well in the majority of cases, either by being so different to the rest of the game that the ebb and flow is ruined, or because they are just not enjoyable.\n\nI do not think they need to even be included in games and rarely will a game be remembered for a great mini-game. Surely there will be multiple comments from games I have not thought of that will prove this last statement wrong, though…\n\nDom Rice\n\nDeath Tank is best tank\n\nOoh, favourite mini-games, I love this one!\n\nThe bonus multiplayer shifting-wall maze game from Rayman 2. Still one of the most addictive and engaging multiplayer games I’ve ever come across. Even the slightly glitchy nature of it seemed to add to the unpredictable fun!\n\nBeyond Good & Evil’s racing game, which blurred the line between mini-game and main game by requiring you to find a secret tunnel in the mini-game to progress in the main quest.\n\nDeath Tank. Hands down the best multiplayer game ever. Even beats Saturn Bomberman. It was a hidden game unlocked by owning two of the publisher Lobotomy’s Saturn games – Quake, Exhumed, or Duke Nukem – or alternatively by destroying all of the toilets in Duke Nukem!\n\nGetting a job as a forklift driver in Shenmue. Tedious, mundane and yet an essential part of the whole perfect experience of that game.\n\nWarioWare: Smooth Move’s five second stopwatch game. Good grief this one is epic. Whenever it came up (game choice was random) we all went silent, the tension and concentration palpable. Then all hell would break loose if someone managed to stop it on 5.00 dead…\n\nGreat Hot Topic!\n\nTim F\n\nE-mail your comments to: gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk\n\nCrafty extra\n\nFor me, the best mini-game is crafting in Final Fantasy XIV. Playing like a very abstracted turn-based strategy, involving getting your item to as high quality possible without breaking it, and extremely intuitive yet complex. I argue that it could be a game in and of itself. I got so hooked on it that I got my goldsmithing to the maximum level before my actual combat class, which resulted in some of the quests derping out and unlocking early. Whoops.\n\nHowever, the worst for me is any of the mini-games that block doors in any of the Ratchet & Clank games. The award for worst of the worst almost goes to the Infiltrator ones (Collect green things and avoid the one hit kill red things, extremely unforgiving later on), but the Pirate Jig doors. Okay, Insomniac, I get it. It was a near launch title (I think) and you wanted to show off the Sixaxis, but when you use it to do a bare bones follow-the-leader thing with one of the most lenient time limits ever, that’s when my intelligence starts to feel insulted.\n\nDarkSapphire\n\nGame sampler\n\nThe question as to whether mini-games add replay value or gameplay variety within your chosen genre is an interesting one. I have fond memories of the hovercraft racing games within Beyond Good & Evil because they are quite short and give an opportunity to try out another type of game, in my case for instance buying and enjoying Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed as opposed to my more regular choices.\n\nThere is however quite a difference when you are required to play a mini-game that you do not enjoy in order to make normal progress through the game rather than having it being optional, which in my case was Blitzball in Final Fantasy X.\n\nI am not generally drawn towards sports games as a rule, particularly something resembling football which I don’t follow, although the options and ability to recruit within the game suggests something rewarding if that is your thing. I must give the honourable mention to Chocobo Racing in Final Fantasy VII as I have never quite been able to get that cheesy music out of my head, and somehow it always helped to persuade to try again for other prizes!\n\nJoe 90\n\nPS: I am currently dying a lot playing Dark Souls, my compliments to Gill C./Zombiekicker and all others who recommended it.\n\nValue added\n\nI’m in favour of all mini-games that are optional to the core gameplay. If I’ve chosen to buy a platform game, then I probably shouldn’t be forced to win a road race to progress to the next level. But if races and other deviations from the game’s primary genre(s) are just a value added extra then their inclusion can only be a positive thing.\n\nMy favourite mini-games are the unlockable arcade machine in The Warriors (which recreates the main game as a Final Fight homage), and the hidden duck race in Shenmue II, which simply has to be seen to be believed.\n\nDynamite Headdy (@2Tweet2BeSour)\n\nMercenary attitude\n\nBetween them I think BioShock and Mass Effect 2 have got it sewn up in terms of worst mini-game (I’ve still no idea what BioWare were thinking with the planet-scanning nonsense) but in terms of ones I actually enjoyed I think the obvious winner is Resident Evil 4’s The Mercenaries. For me this is the point at which Resident Evil 4 just went from generally awesome to all-time-classic-that-will-never-be-beaten. And it hasn’t.\n\nIf you haven’t played it Mercenaries is a sort of time attack game where you have to kill as many zombies (or whatever they were called then Ganados or something) as possible in the short time. But not only was the game incredibly fun and addictive there was really a lot too it as well. There were multiple levels, multiple unlockable characters, and so many secrets and special tactics that it really did seem like a separate game in its own right.\n\nCapcom even released it that way on the 3DS and although that was probably pushing things a bit far I have to say I enjoyed it and didn’t feel ripped off.\n\nStation\n\nCatch up on every previous Games Inbox here\n\nThe legend of fishing\n\nIf anyone mentions the Gummi Ship from Kingdom Hearts I think I’ll loose faith in humanity (and no, being ‘better’ in the sequel doesn’t count – it was still awful). My favourite video game though is an old favourite that I also think few people will complain about: the fishing in Zelda: Ocarina Of Time.\n\nIt didn’t have anything to do with anything and you could’ve easily played the whole game and never touched it, but to this day I think I must’ve spent 10 or even 20 hours in total on it. And I’d never usually even consider playing a fishing game before.\n\nOf course that wasn’t 10 hours in a row but once the addiction sets in you just have to get a bigger fish, or try once more for the mystical Hylian Loach. Just a perfect little secret that is more fun than whole games in their entirety.\n\nVita-Man\n\nE-mail your comments to: gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk\n\nThe small print\n\nNew Inbox updates appear twice daily, every weekday morning and afternoon.
