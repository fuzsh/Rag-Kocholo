        "text": "GameCentral readers discuss their favourite, and least favourite mini-games, from lock-picking and hacking to Blitzball.\n\nThe discussion point for this weekend’s Inbox was suggested by reader Purple Ranger. In this context mini-game means any part of a larger game that has completely different gameplay to the rest of it. So it also includes shore-horned in stealth sections and unlockable extra games that are otherwise completely separate.\n\nAlthough the consensus was slightly against mini-games in general, particularly hacking, most people could name a favourite or two, with Final Fantasy X’s Blitzball and Beyond Good & Evil’s hovercraft sections being particularly popular.\n\nMini-Fantasy\n\nBack before the Final Fantasy series didn’t tarnish its name with a boring entry that spawned not one but two direct sequels of equal boringish-ness, they used to have some great mini-games: Blitzball on Final Fantasy X was a game in its own right and I sunk countless hours into making the Besaid Aurochs the dominant force of Spira’s Blitzball League (a pity they messed it up royally on Final Fantasy X-2), playing Mog’s House at the Golden Square on VII was curiously heart-warming, breeding chocobos on VII and IX was both a pleasant diversion from the game and richly rewarding, while Triple Triad on VIII and Tetra Master on IX were both loads of fun – Triple Triad being more fun than the game it was a part of.\n\nAs for the worst, there is a special place in R’lyeh reserved for the both mahjong and shogi in Yakuza 2. The rules are incomprehensible, you need a Japanese phrasebook to understand some of the tiles/pieces, and there is no way of guessing if you’re in a commanding position or are about to get soundly owned. But it’s safe to guess that your opponents are going to get the most fluky win in the next two or three moves – which means any hopes of getting 100% for the game are gone from the outset.\n\nTyler Zerstören\n\nPuppy love\n\nMy favourite mini-game is puppy-throwing from Earthworm Jim 2. They got chucked out a window by Psycrow, you had to catch/bounce them on a cushion over to the safety of Peter Puppy. If too many went splat he attacked you.\n\nMy most hated is QTEs they are nothing more then a mini-game, but if they don’t count then the stamina-increasing game in No More Heroes 2 with the stupid dumbbells you have to punch as they fly at you, while you’re on a treadmill if I recall.\n\nRyokoSparda\n\nMaxi-game\n\nGeometry Wars is surely the daddy of all mini-games isn’t it? A mini-game so fundamentally brilliant it turned into a monster mini-game that ruled Xbox Live Arcade. And to think it was initially included as an extra in the already rather excellent Project Gotham Racing games.\n\nThat’s an overload of brilliance that is. Why on earth aren’t Bizarre Creations still a functioning studio? Looking at Geometry Wars Retro Evolved and its sequel those developers were so talented.\n\nOn the flip side I’ve suffered loads of bad mini-games, but perhaps the most heartbreaking were those path puzzles in TimeSplitters: Future Perfect.\n\nInitially I loved shooting my way through the game’s single-player adventure. Cortez’s quest took me to many different times and places, the other characters were funny, the levels were fresh and inventive.\n\nBut then I reached the You Genius, U Genix level, and as far as I remember the player has to complete a double path puzzle against the clock. There may have been three path puzzles actually, it’s years since I’ve played the game and experienced its stressful torture.\n\nNeedless to say I never managed to complete the puzzles, got seriously annoyed and ended up disliking the game for that ill-conceived part of it.\n\nmsv858 (Twitter)\n\nE-mail your comments to: gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk\n\nBonus attack\n\nI am fairly indifferent to current mini-games. I can see why they are incorporated as it offers a change of pace but I also find most instantly forgettable.\n\nI used to like bonus stages, which are a dying breed in modern games. The Puppeteer (and possibly Donkey Kong Country Returns) are the only recent games I can picture seeing the words ‘Bonus Stage’ on the TV. These are OK but a long way from the greatness of the Sonic 2 tunnel runs.\n\nThe best mini-games I can think of come from the LittleBigPlanet series of games. These are usually quick score attack type challenges.\n\nI quite like the lock-picking in the Elder Scrolls games as it does a reasonable interpretation of actual lock-picking. I however, usually find the attempts to do hacking in science fiction games poor as I struggle to see how they relate to hacking. They just seem like a rubbish attempt at copying Elder Scrolls.\n\nThe worst mini-games I can think of are in Lollipop Chainsaw and try and recreate old 2D and Isometric C64/Spectrum platform games.\n\nPazJohnMitch\n\nDream distraction\n\nMy favourite mini-game is an oldie but was so unexpected that I can’t forget it. The game was Pyjamarama on the Spectrum. Controlling Wally, who’s dream world you are trapped in, you had to wander around his house trying to fix his alarm clock so that it could wake him from his nightmare. Easier said than done. Anyway, whilst wandering around his house there was a room that when entered started a bizarre Space Invaders game.\n\nWally walked back and forth firing knives and forks up at strange enemies such as roast chickens. And it was actually good fun too. Many times I headed straight into that room rather than playing the main game, bearing in mind this game had no save points or checkpoints so dying meant complete restarts. There’s been many other mini-games I’ve enjoyed but none have stood out as much or surprised me with their inclusion.\n\nOpt1mus76 (PSN ID)\n\n3D Sonic\n\nThe best is quite easy. And anybody who remembers this but doesn’t mention it is very clearly – and empirically – wrong. The blue sphere special stage from Sonic 3 way back on the Mega Drive. Of course, Sonic 2’s half-pipe is more iconic, but the blue sphere stages were more satisfying to play. For those of you have no clue what I’m going on about, Sonic or whoever your chosen character was would find themselves on some weird planetoid in a surreal realm – you’d see stars and galaxies in the sky above you.\n\nThe stages were pseudo-3D as you ran in to the screen, like in the Sonic 2 half-pipe. You could travel in the four major directions of the compass and you had to collect all the allotted blue spheres to collect a pretty, sparkly Chaos Emerald.\n\nBut there was a bit more to it than that. Because there were rings to collect, too. And if you could line the perimeter of various square formations that you found, they would yield more rings. And of course, there was a maximum number of rings to be got in each one. If you did, not only would you be awarded a continue in an already easy game, but the word ‘Perfect’ would briefly flash up once you got that final ring.\n\nBut be careful, because every blue sphere collected turns red. And you don’t want to touch those. They boot you out of the stage and you’ll have to try again another time. Unless, you create squares of blue spheres, in which case they all turn into rings and you are very happy. And as the stage drags on, the speed increases…\n\nI may not have done a great job selling that, but trust me, it is awesome. A game of quick thinking and risk versus reward that still satisfies when you get a perfect score to this day.\n\nAs for worst, well sadly there’s a lot of candidates there. The recent Saints Row IV had you doing all those irritating hacking mini-games just to unlock the door of a shop. But still, nothing can outdo a turret mini-game. Sly Cooper 2 had you do loads and they were never fun. Never. But worst of all, was the one in Dead Space. Just hateful. Gave up on the game after that. It was a poor man’s Resident Evil 4, anyway.\n\nDMR\n\nPS: That’s right! Who wants a piece, Dead Space fanboys?!\n\nBroken promises\n\n‎I think my ‎best mini-game has to be the Paint one found in the employment centres in Mystical Ninja on the SNES, especially in two-player mode. Almost like Snake, except you leave a perma-trail that you can’t cross, it always had me giggling, and itching for one more go. Cutting across your opponent when you ‘promise not to so we can see how high a score we can get’ was also hilarious.\n\nmandlecreed02\n\nCatch up on every previous Games Inbox here\n\nSoundly satisfying\n\nMy favourite mini-game, interesting! I know I had quite a thrill when getting tumblers to stay up in Elder Scrolls: Oblivion, especially given the fact that I was not particular at a high level of skill at lock-picking. So when doing the final thieves guild quest for an actual Elder Scroll somewhere in the Cyrodiil capital’s main government building the locks of the highest difficulty where everywhere, plus places all linked to this quest.\n\nI think one of the best things about mini-games is a satisfactory sound effect or effects being used to know you’re on the right track or a correct sequence of pathways has been achieved. Like the clinks in the lock pickings of Oblivion and getting a sequence of code correct in say the Mass Effect games like the second one.\n\nIt may have had it’s problems with some gamers but the first BioShock and it’s Pipe Mania type game to close down alarms and security devices was a fun game, especially when you got special perks to help make it easier for you if you decided to spend the currency of the game on it.\n\nI also liked the Deus Ex: Human Revolution hacking games of which is another type of skill advancer, and when you say trigger the security and have seconds to complete the hack or abort makes it a very fun and non-annoying mini-challenge.\n\nI think getting the happy medium is crucial in games and to make it the less irritating the better, which can be difficult if you’re in a frantic part of a game and a security device of some sorts or some door is blocking the progress forward of which can sap the exciting running, shooting or whatever and you end up cursing the screen cause of this infernal mini-game which is proving rather a problem.\n\nBut I for one can remember being entertained by them and it helps create another atmospheric part of an area in a level or setting, and is one of the total sum of its parts and makes a great addition to the gameplay.\n\nAlucard\n\nE-mail your comments to: gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk\n\nThe small print\n\nNew Inbox updates appear twice daily, every weekday morning and afternoon.
