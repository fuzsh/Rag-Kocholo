        "text": "90%No Platform Specified\n\nIt's easy enough to tally up Beyond Good & Evil's accomplishments in game play, level design, and outright eye candy, and declare it a success. But there's something more here to which all of these technical and design accomplishments are only a means to and end. You see, BG&E is one of those rare games that shines from all points with an unmistakable quality of intelligence and personality. It's in the sharp writing and excellent voice acting. It's in the constantly inventive yet believable world of Hyllis and in the story's intriguing twists and emotional impact. Or in little details, wonderfully presented: Pey'j and Jade leaping into an embrace after a big fight, or Jade's face registering pity and horror with the subtlest change of expression. It's one thing to create a game full of pretty graphics and big action; it's something else to give us a story worth caring about involving characters we believe in.\n\nUltimately, for all its similarities to Zelda, this is where Beyond Good & Evil finds its own ground. Not only does it avoid many of the frustrations of the games it draws from (and yes, that includes Zelda's flat story and tedious item-chasing), but it is pierced throughout with humor, intelligence, and humanity. While it's over a bit before you'd want it to be, Beyond Good & Evil tells its story with amazing pizzazz and polish. Even better, it's a story well worth telling.\n\nShareCompleted\n\nMrMii6\n\n90%Xbox\n\nIf Rayman is Michel Ancel's Mario, than Beyond Good and Evil is his Zelda.\n\nI really regret not playing this game earlier because it is fantastic. I loved the gameplay variety, the world, the characters, the art style and just the vibe of the game as a whole. Also, it has one of the neatest ways to input text I've ever seen in a game.\n\nThere's not much bad to say about it other than that it can be a bit confusing to navigate the world now and then. Some parts of the game are also a bit slow but that's not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nI played the XBOX version, which looks and runs great. At first I tried playing it on PC but it does not play well on modern hardware at all. I'd stick to the console versions.\n\nShareCompleted\n\nBaraz\n\n80%PC\n\n21h 30m Played\n\nFor an old game (2003), the visuals and animations are rather nice, even on a 1080p, and can work on Windows 10 without needing to tweak the files (unlike many old games on Steam).* As the new one should come out in the following years, and looks great, I wanted to experience the original.\n\nGameplay / Story (I give zero spoilers nor even a hint)\n\nYou play a young reporter and will investigate and search for various things ... I will not spoil. It is a nice heroic linear adventure, with a few optional minigames and side activities like races. Gameplay has both combat (melee and vehicles), and also stealth. There are many \"environmental puzzles\" like press the right button, notice how the guards move/turn to bypass, search for a the secret passage, etc. You will have one companion most of the times.\n\nOnly one thing is badly designed\n\nWhile moving in one direction, the camera is almost always aiming elsewhere and changing angles quickly, which made me dizzy quite often. All-around fine game, but the viewpoint of your character is very often set automatically in a direction chosen by the game, at lightning speed, and not always where you are aiming or heading. For example, it might pivot 180 degrees instantly to face an enemy while you are trying to move away. It was very confusing and I even was seasick often to the point of taking breaks (which I never feel in games).\n\nIn vehicles, I often switched to first person (camera is then fully controlled) to avoid feeling sick.\n\nTime\n\nAmong over 600 players polled on the web site HowLongToBeat, the average time is 11 hours, up to about 20 hours. I found and obtained *everything*, but it took me about 20 hours.\n\n* Technical (PC) tips\n\nIt works fine \"out-of-the-box\", but you can improve your experience with three very simple info...\n\na) The settings (resolution, keybinds, graphics, etc.) are not in-game, but done via an application in the game folder, called SettingsApplication.exe.\n\nb) Cap to 60 FPS (via SettingsApplications or GPU Control Panel). Higher FPS will desync cutscenes.\n\nc) For better visuals, with a modern GPU, set all the graphical compatiblity options ON (off means you remove certain graphic features to improve performance or compatiblity). The game's anti-aliasing also greatly improves the visuals. Turn some off *only* if you experience graphical issues. I found the visuals noticeably nicer with ALL the graphical features on (with a GTX 1660TI).\n\nd) To ensure stability, set the game exe to Windows XP SP3 compatiblity. I had zero crashes in over 20 hours.\n\n- Baraz on Steam :\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/baraz/recommended/15130"
