        "text": "Imagine Metal Gear Solid with tighter gameplay, a storyline which can hold your interest and avoid slipping into self-indulgent monlogue, gameplay which is consistent, interesting, and unique, great character design, near-perfect voice acting, boss battles that are gettable and challenging without being frustrating, mini-games that are both appealing and integrated into the environment and gameplay, and an ending that actually allows for some degree of ambiguity that doesn’t in any way impact its beauty.\n\nThe game also feels in many ways like Zelda: WW without the tedious sailing but with all the charm intact. The graphics shared the same imaginative charm, while allowing for a broader influence from classical design. Brilliant character growth management that encouraged exploration without forcing the player to accomplish every single goal in the game.\n\nFirst game I’ve actually finished in a long time. Wish I could play it again for the first time. In other words, highly recommended.\n\nI was going to post something almost the same - except that I haven’t quite finished it yet, so if you spoil, I murder you with pain. This is easily one of the nicest surprises of the year as far as I’m concerned.\n\n\"One thing I couldn’t really figure out from the reviews, what is the core gameplay like exactly? Is it stealth, action, platform, what? That was not quite clear. \"\n\nIt’s not. It’s basically a game in which you do ‘stuff’. There’s bits where you’re wandering around the city, parts where you’re using a hovercraft, taking photos of monsters a la Pokemon Snap…all sorts of little bits and pieces. Probably the closest is a modern Little Big Adventure, although that’s still grasping at straws. It’s one of those games that the nebulous term ‘action adventure’ is intended for.\n\nIt’s just exceptionally good. The graphics are beautiful, and the characters stunning - their rendering, scripts, voices and little touches (for instance, Pey’j waving when you turn the camera on him) are fantastic. The bosses are just the right side of satisfying. You have to thrash away to avoid dying, and they’re suitably tense, but basically designed for you to beat them. The exploration is fun, and backed up with tons of little details - like comments from your partner, or otherwise quiet segments suddenly being broken up by a monster attack.\n\nOh, and I want a soundtrack CD.\n\nI agree with your review. I rented/bought about 8 games this weekend, and BG&E was the last game I tried. I played it for 6 hours straight, more than any of the other games. At first I was thinking that it was borderline Dark Cloud 2 kiddiness, especially as John Tesh would play a few notes on the soundtrack, but within 30 minutes or so I was hooked.\n\nThe gameplay is sort of Dark Cloudish, but the combat is more fun. It doesn’t require the skill set of Prince of Persia to get around, but it still has a sense of adventure and fun just exploring. I haven’t played a lot of platform type games, so I’m not sure which games this is most similar to, but the game has just the right amount of fun and challenge. I love the artwork and atmosphere of the game. The characters are great and the storyline is just fine. The photography part of the game is a lot better than DC2, because the art work is just so much more appealing and the animals are pretty cool.\n\nI didn’t think of MGS as I was playing it though. I thought of Deus Ex 2, because that was another one of the games I rented over the weekend and gave a solid try. The difference between the two, other than the perspective and subject matter, was striking. Deus Ex is ugly and dark, the game play feels poorly done (the shooter parts are a joke in comparison with Rainbow 6 or BF1942), and the story is just so much boring rehash. BG&E on the other hand is a treasure to look at, has crisp gameplay, and a captivating tale. I can’t wait to get back playing and finish my infiltration of the evil soylent green factory.\n\nIt’s sort of all…think Zelda/MGish. However, the stealth is actually extremely well done, and there’s no annoying falling of ledges or jumping puzzles. There’s a great system of rewards in the game, and the whole thing is incredibly polished.\n\nThe game is, for lack of a better word, thoughtful. For instance, there’s a boss battle with multiple stages. First of all, if you die, the game doesn’t throw you back to the beginning of the battle, and you initiate the “stages” through moving your character (i.e. the game gives you a breather and a feeling of progression). Boss battles are usually when I quit a game…\n\nI also love the mechanic of popping the bad guys green tanks–it adds a whole level of strategy, esp. when you use it to distract their buddies. Interesting AI is quite often extremely artificial and contrived, but if you can put together a few interesting behaviors that mix well, you can have a real good time.\n\nI definitely dig the engine that Ubisoft is using, I think they’re going to get a lot of mileage out of it if these two games are examples. That said, I prefer POP to BGE, just because the gameplay and fluidity of the interface in the first drew me in and suddenly I found myself halfway through the game when I meant to just “try it out”. Not that they’re really meant to be compared, since they are quite different games.\n\nBGE looks beautiful, has a nice variety of gameplay elements, but I find the context-sensitive action stuff just turns it into a bit of a button-clicking adventure. I don’t really like difficult games, and normally would appreciate an easier game, but I think it might be too easy. Additionally, considering how consoley BGE is, it would have been nice if they had allowed gamepads on the PC version."
