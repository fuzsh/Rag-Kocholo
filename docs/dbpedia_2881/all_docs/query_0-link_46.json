        "text": "Yep, contains spoilers.\n\nOfftopic:\n\nWhen I was a child, I had that girl in class. No, there’s no love story around. We didn’t have anything in common, until one day I asked her about games. She told me about Beyond Good And Evil and how she loved taking pictures around but was stuck in a stealth level. I got very curious about it and periodically asked her about the in-game progress, but she eventually forsaken the game. We barely spoke again, but I got curious. I didn’t own a PlayStation but a Nintendo Gamecube and didn’t know that console has an own version, so I would have to wait like 10 years to play it on Steam.\n\nJust an ordinary day in Beyond Good And Evil\n\nBeyond Good And Evil surely brings a lot of memories: back when developers cared about stories, atmosphere and the immersion. Of course the game hasn’t the best of its generation, but the graphics are more than enough for its era: there’s plenty of colour, cities, the sea, the animals… It’s a full world ready to be explored.\n\nAs a “veteran gamer” I couldn’t help but to look down on the game, but it surprised me: got stuck in some parts, and farming the Pearls was way more difficult than I had expected. The bar mini-games gave me nightmares, with this song played in my brain every single day:\n\nFun fact: I’m Spanish and this isn’t my tongue lmao\n\nLet’s go deeper: gameplay? Gameplay!\n\nThe character controlling was decent: anything spectacular to point out. The combat, however, felt repetitive and a bit boring, even with the singular fights where we had to parry projectiles or smash enemies against electricity to blow them up. There wasn’t any combat power up I can remember, and it would have been amazing. Just like StarFox Adentures did: adding the skill of shooting with the staff or creating ground explosions.\n\nThe many dungeons of the game were genuinely built: mazes full of enemies, shortcuts, rewards hidden in corners… I only hated the one which depends on the ship too much. But the stealth parts are amazing: hidden in a shadow spot, setting up the camera to take a picture that will change the world’s opinion, feels cool, right? Sometimes it was pointless to put on a fight, so the feeling of insecurity was constantly around, forcing us to remember that the strongest isn’t always who has the best weapon.\n\nDisclaimer: I have beat Dark Souls and several difficult games, but this game’s final boss destroyed me mercilessly.\n\nTaking pictures in the game was, definitely, the most innovative feature of the experience. Getting paid for photographing different species felt amazing (As a game developer, I can tell exploration should always be rewarded). However, the photos ended becoming a job, due to the Pearl farming thing to progress in the game. In my opinion Beyond Good And Evil asks for too many pearls to advance, and as far as I know is the main reason most players stop playing.\n\nThe characters are lovable, like Pey’j or Double H, both with catchy phrases and temporal in-game partners. There also the “Chinese” merchant, and a bunch of forgettable people. Come on, who can’t like a partner that screams “Chili con carne” every time he attacks?\n\nDo Re Mi Fa\n\nSurprisingly the game has some damn good tracks, most of them funky as hell or just chilly (my cup of tea). I swear it was so random to visit the garage and jam at this happy song.\n\nBut the track I loved the most was definitely ‘Peace’. I can’t recall at which time of the game is playing, but even the Youtube extended version feels short when I have it playing on the background.\n\nSo, should you play it?\n\nIf you’re one of those: “nah, with those graphics I won’t” then surely you’re missing an opportunity to play one of those classic games that remain as a great experience. Taking your time to explore the sea, stopping by the city to gamble some money in exchange of pearls, completing your album of pictures and visiting the funky garage to upgrade your ship definitely was great for me.\n\nIf that wasn’t enough, remember that there’s the next game coming (it’s a prequel, right?) that will fill some holes which the plot left, waiting for the players who grew up to continue the adventure!"
