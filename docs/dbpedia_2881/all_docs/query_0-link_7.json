        "text": "The folks at Ubisoft are now renowned for the open worlds of their games and Beyond Good and Evil: 20th Anniversary Edition is next on its list. You might think that the first Assassin’s Creed laid down their blueprint for the Assassins, but Ubisoft’s signs in designing open worlds go back four years earlier. Beyond Good and Evil was one of the first Ubisoft games where we freely explored a virtual environment.\n\nOver twenty years later, we’ve had a chance to return to the imaginative world of Hillys through its second remastered edition (after the one in 2011). And I’m happy to say that this world is just as magical two decades later.\n\nBy today’s standards, the world of Beyond Good and Evil is minuscule, even empty. However, the remaster has polished it to the point where it looks better than I remember from the original game. Returning to Mamago Garage with the Rastafarian rhinos honestly felt like meeting old friends. It reminded me of simpler times when every possible thing didn’t have to entertain people, and themes like multiculturalism and racial diversity in games were everyday occurrences that no one pointed at as some conspiracy.\n\nI may have rushed this introduction, assuming everyone reading it knows what Beyond Good and Evil is. Given that the original game wasn’t a commercial success, chances are that’s the case. So here’s the obligatory paragraph explaining what it’s about.\n\nIf you are in the mood for something completely different, check out our V Rising review.\n\nThe Story of Beyond Good and Evil: 20th Anniversary Edition\n\nBeyond Good and Evil is a sci-fi action-adventure set in a world where certain animal species have acquired human characteristics and started living in a community with humans. One such community includes a girl named Jade and her “uncle” “Pey’j” Pey’jcky Pig, who helps Jade run an orphanage for children who lost their families in the war. Their planet, Hillys, is under siege by an alien species called DomZ, and they are protected by a military force called Alpha Section. Jade and Pey’j, In tough times, don’t stay from any job to survive, leading them to contact a secret group, the Iris Network, which reveals that something very suspicious is happening behind the scenes of the war.\n\nThe game has simple gameplay with a few welcome twists. You can freely move around the world between missions and side activities, which include photographing animals, participating in races, chasing bandits, and various mini-games. Jade operates a small ship equipped with weapons and boosters, which she can upgrade by collecting crystal balls obtained by completing challenges and tasks. In combat, Jade uses one weapon and has only two attacks, but she’s accompanied by another character, requiring occasional tandem attacks on enemies.\n\nThe Gameplay\n\nAs this is a remaster, the gameplay formula has remained untouched. Only a few control changes have been made, but two or three-button rearrangements aren’t significant. Luckily, the game is not updated in this aspect; it controls very well whether you’re using a gamepad or a mouse and keyboard combo.\n\nThe visual clarity is good, which PC players will particularly appreciate since the original 2003 version on Steam doesn’t support widescreen, while the GOG version supports widescreen but not controller play. Unfortunately, the remaster didn’t go further, so ultrawide resolutions aren’t supported.\n\nAlthough nothing significant has been added to the gameplay, almost nothing needed to be added. Occasionally, I reminded myself that this is a game from another time because, at no point does it throw an indicator on the screen showing where you need to go or what you need to interact with, and if you get stuck, you won’t want suggestions about what you need to do. However, everything in this game is very readable and logical, so there’s a need for such aids. This is a testament to well-designed gameplay.\n\nNothing needed to be added to the game, but a mini-map would be nice. Over time, you can acquire detectors for animal species and crystal balls that you collect around, but to use them, you have to open the map and manually turn them on each time (with every map opening). This is a bit tedious and could have been avoided by adding a mini-map or at least a compass (which already exists when you drive the ship in first-person view).\n\nThe Look and Feel\n\nOn the technical side, I have a complaint about the game still using only one save slot. They’ve added auto-save, which is useful, but we’re now in the era of memory cards, so there’s no reason to limit the number of save slots. It’s helpful that they’ve added the ability to skip cutscenes, but they could have also added the option to pause the game during these scenes.\n\nAs for new content, they’ve added a short piece of adventure where Jade searches for items left by Pey’j and ultimately receives a message from a character we didn’t see in the original game. This is an interesting addition primarily because it slightly expands the story in preparation for Beyond Good and Evil 2, which should happen… someday. Maybe. In any case, it’s motivation for fans to get this version of the game.\n\nI mentioned earlier that the game looks better than I remember. The remaster has done a fantastic job here. It retains that old-fashioned look that shows this is a game made 20 years ago, yet at times, it looks more than decent with high-resolution textures.\n\nThe most significant improvements are seen in the character models themselves. They look recognizable but even more charming. A prime example is Pey’j. Pey’jooks is more endearing than the 2011 HD remaster—perhaps due to his more rounded snout.\n\nThe Technical Details of Beyond Good and Evil: 20th Anniversary Edition\n\nHowever, despite the makeover, some parts of the game must be updated. This is most noticeable in the water texture—you spend much of the game on water. The water surface looks like a messy texture with a reflective effect added.\n\nTechnically, the PC version is executed solidly, though not perfectly. I noticed that the game always sets the wrong resolution whenever you change monitors, and at 165 Hz, I noticed constant stuttering until I put the Windows settings to 60 Hz. However, I later saw that you can adjust the framerate, not within the game but in the configuration file.\n\nThe music has been re-recorded in an orchestral arrangement for the remaster, and it definitely sounds great. However, if you listen closely, you’ll notice the difference from the old game, confirming how good the original music was. I still remember the idyllic tunes while cruising Hillys. This brings me to the following conclusion.\n\nBeyond Good and Evil was an unforgettable adventure, and although we can’t do it the same way today, it remains an exceptionally imaginative, well-designed, and entertaining game. Nowadays, it even serves as a useful respite from games overloaded with content, stretched out, taking longer than an hour to explain all their mechanics. I think it’s vital that this remaster exists—to remind us of different times and to prove that more straightforward ideas don’t mean less fun gameplay.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nThis is a game of indescribable charm, a title where we can genuinely describe the characters as iconic. Pey’j the pig isn’t constantly with you, but while he is, he makes the most of that time so that through his comments, you get a clear picture of a caring character who doesn’t shy away from risk but also knows caution. On the other hand, Jade doesn’t see herself as a hero but is willing and ready to do anything to help others.\n\nAt this moment, it’s uncertain whether we’ll see new stories with these characters (although Ubisoft has been assuring us for years that the next game is in development), and that’s why it’s good that Jade and Pey’j have been immortalized with a remaster that offers the best version of the game so far, even if there was potential for it to be even better. Whatever future awaits Jade and Pey’j, the 20th Anniversary Edition will be a pleasant reminder of the good old days.\n\nOn a scale of 1-10, we give this game an 8 out of 10!"
