        "text": "It seems as though the ESRB listing was correct and that the beloved GameCube game Beyond Good & Evil is receiving a special 20th-anniversary edition. A listing for the game, which includes updated textures, lighting, an additional treasure hunt story, and a making-of feature, appeared temporarily on the Xbox Store before being taken down. Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition will hopefully find its way onto the Nintendo Switch, although that has yet to be confirmed by Ubisoft. It sounds like an announcement is imminent.\n\n“Swoop into the marvelous world of Hillys as action-reporter Jade to investigate the mysterious DomZ alien attacks alongside colorful characters, like her adoptive uncle Pey’j or the valiant Double H.
