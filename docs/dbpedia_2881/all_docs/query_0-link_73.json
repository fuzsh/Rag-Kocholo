        "text": "Sony’s PlayStation 2 is one of the greatest gaming systems of all time. Not only has it sold more units than any other home or handheld console ever since it came out in the year 2000, but it also supports thousands of titles and arrived at a time when video games were becoming more complex, artistic, and immersive. If you were part of the generation that discovered video games through titles like Grand Theft Auto III and God of War, chances are the PS2 played a major role in your youth.\n\nSo what better way to walk down memory lane with this classic gamestation than making a list of the best PS2 games of all time? We are aware this can bring back some good and bad memories. We know some of these games might have resulted in a loss of some rather hefty yet “friendly” bet wages or some arguments that could have given our loved ones the steppin’. We hope we have all moved on from those moments since then and have nothing but fond memories to look back on. Here are our choices for the top 50 PlayStation 2 games of all time.\n\n50. 'Alien Hominid'\n\nPublisher: O3 Entertainment\n\nYear: 2004\n\nIt was brutally hard, but we loved the throwback side-scrolling gameplay and the cute, cartoony animation. Blasting through FBI and KGB agents has never been more fun.\n\n49. 'The Mark of Kri'\n\nPublisher: Sony Computer Entertainment\n\nYear: 2002\n\nSure, Mark of Kri featured plenty of delicious hacking and slashing, but it also delivered gorgeous 3D environments and encouraged exploration. This game was more than your everyday beat-em-up.\n\n48. 'Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3'\n\nPublisher: Neversoft\n\nYear: 2001\n\nTHPS3brought Tony Hawk’s franchise to another level. It didn’t fix what wasn’t broken – you could still play with a roster of pro skater legends and the soundtrack still slaps – but it added the revert and a new level of polish. This game is still in our rotation.\n\n47. 'Black'\n\nPublisher: EA\n\nYear: 2006\n\nFor fans of first-person shooters who enjoy wreaking havoc and reducing cities to rubble, Black is the game for you. It didn’t bring anything new to the FPS genre, but it’s an all-out assault on the senses.\n\n46. 'Dead to Rights'\n\nPublisher: Namco\n\nYear: 2002\n\nSure, it might have been a Max Payne rip-off, but we’re willing to look the other way. Dead to Rights delivered killer gun-fu action in a grimy inner-city underworld that we still enjoy revisiting.\n\n45. 'Final Fantasy XI'\n\nPublisher: Square Enix\n\nYear: 2004\n\nFinal Fantasy XI was an MMORPG (massive multiplayer online role-playing game, for the uninitiated) done right. Not only was it incredibly addictive, it also made waves as the first online title in the Final Fantasy series.\n\n44. 'Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter'\n\nPublisher: Capcom\n\nYear: 2003\n\nThis game was a major departure from the rest of the Breath of Fire series. Set in a claustrophobic subterranean world, it added mini-games and other unique features to the traditional RPG format.\n\n43. 'Maximo: Ghosts to Glory'\n\nPublisher: Capcom\n\nYear: 2002\n\nThis is an overall solid game. Part of the Ghosts ‘n Goblins universe, Maximo engages players from the jump and leads them through a fun, exciting quest to restore the title character’s ruined kingdom.\n\n42. 'TimeSplitters'\n\nPublisher: Eidos Interactive\n\nYear: 2000\n\nTimeSplitters is ambitious above all else. The story unfolds over 100 years through the eyes of 18 characters. The graphics are slick, the soundtrack shifts depending on the era you’re playing, and the action is frantic. Plus, there’s great multiplayer content.\n\n41. 'The Warriors'\n\nPublisher: Rockstar Games\n\nYear: 2005\n\nFirst things first: if you haven’t seen the movie The Warriors is based on, do that now. Next, dive headfirst into this gritty, bloody romp through a stylized 1970s New York gangland. Come out to plaayy-yyyy.\n\n40. 'Burnout 3: Takedown'\n\nPublisher: EA Games\n\nYear: 2004\n\nIt’s hard to top a game like Burnout 3 for pure, heart-stopping adrenaline. Is there anything more exhilarating than blasting through oncoming traffic at 200 mph? It doesn’t even matter if you win – the crashes are 90 percent of the fun.\n\n39. 'Rez'\n\nPublisher: Sega\n\nYear: 2002\n\nThis game is a trip. Set to pulsing electronica, the goal is to travel through the world’s computer network and save the AI core from an existential breakdown. It’s a story that makes more sense today than it did in 2002.\n\n38. 'Suikoden III'\n\nPublisher: Konami\n\nYear: 2002\n\nWith multiple main characters playable in an elaborate 3D world, Suikoden III was truly majestic and engrossing.\n\n37. 'Twisted Metal: Black'\n\nPublisher: Sony Computer Entertainment\n\nYear: 2001\n\nOne of the more unhinged entries on this list, Twisted Metal: Black is all about mayhem. Escaped patients from a mental institution compete in a no-holds-barred car-combat free-for-all. It’s a violent, but welcome, escape from reality.\n\n36. 'Odin Sphere'\n\nPublisher: Atlus\n\nYear: 2007\n\nWith more than 40 hours of gameplay, Odin Sphere is a game you can get lost in. The story is intricate, the setting is beautiful, and the 2D side-scrolling interface will appeal to nostalgic gamers.\n\n35. 'Dead or Alive 2'\n\nPublisher: Tecmo\n\nYear: 2000\n\nThere’s nothing like a rock-solid, straight-up fighting game for pure and simple fun. PS2 has a lot of them, but not many equal Dead or Alive 2’s combination of memorable characters (including several badass female fighters), wild battlefields, and A+ graphics.\n\n34. 'Manhunt'\n\nPublisher: Rockstar Games\n\nYear: 2003\n\nManhunt is remembered for its brutal violence, but it’s far from a one-dimensional game. The sound is spectacular and the pace is designed to build tension to an almost unbearable level. But, at the end of the day, it’s the violence that will keep you up at night.\n\n33. 'Viewtiful Joe'\n\nPublisher: Capcom\n\nYear: 2003\n\nThis lighthearted, cartoony side-scroller takes place in Movieland, where poor Joe’s girlfriend is being held captive. Viewtiful Joe recalls a simpler era of gaming, but it’s still stylish, fast-paced and fun.\n\n32. 'NBA Street Vol. 2'\n\nPublisher: EA Sports Big\n\nYear: 2003\n\nThis game checked a lot of boxes for basketball fans in the early 2000s. It put past and current NBA legends on some of America’s most revered streetball courts, toned down the laws of gravity, and replaced fundamentals with crossovers ripped straight from the AND1 mixtapes. This game desperately needs a reboot in the 2020s.\n\n31. 'Virtua Fighter 4: Evolution'\n\nPublisher: Sega\n\nYear: 2002\n\nIf VF4: Evolutionisn’t the best fighting game on PS2, it’s close. The game introduced new characters, new moves, better visuals, and demanded a level of expertise that made it tough for button mashers. Practice truly made perfect with this title.\n\n30. 'Devil May Cry'\n\nPublisher: Capcom\n\nYear: 2001\n\nThe hero of Devil May Cryis a half-human, half-devil named Dante who's the son of a dark knight and who's seeking revenge for the death of his mother and brother. He’s also a private investigator who fights with swords and handguns. If that doesn’t sum up how off the wall this game is, we don’t know what can.\n\n29. 'Disgaea: Hour of Darkness'\n\nPublisher: Nippon Ichi Software\n\nYear: 2003\n\nHour of Darkness combines tactical and strategy elements with a mischievous cast of characters to create an unorthodox RPG that can be played over and over. This is for the serious gamer looking for a unique challenge.\n\n28. 'Gran Turismo 4'\n\nPublisher: Sony Computer Entertainment\n\nYear: 2005\n\nWhereas games like Burnout revel in mayhem and carnage, Gran Turismo 4is all about precision. This is the holy grail of realistic driving simulators. Our only complaint? You can’t damage the vehicles.\n\n27. 'Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy'\n\nPublisher: Sony Computer Entertainment\n\nYear: 2001\n\nA rip-off of Banjo Kazooie? Maybe, but it doesn’t matter: The Precursor Legacy is a smooth and fun gaming experience, with zero loading screens, beautiful graphics, and a sprawling environment to explore.\n\n26. 'Psychonauts'\n\nPublisher: Majesco Entertainment\n\nYear: 2005\n\nThis game was criminally overlooked. Psychonauts combines solid platforming gameplay with a strong storyline and surreal, whimsical environments. If you missed it in 2005, give it a try today.\n\n25. 'Bully'\n\nPublisher: Rockstar Games\n\nYear: 2006\n\nBully attracted a lot of criticism that it didn’t deserve. The game was more about standing up to bullies than promoting schoolyard violence, and the violence that it does depict is relatively tame by Rockstar’s standards.\n\n24. 'Beyond Good and Evil'\n\nPublisher: Ubisoft\n\nYear: 2003\n\nThis game didn’t get nearly as much love as it deserved. Beyond Good and Evil tells the story of a brave young photojournalist who sets out to expose corruption and bring the truth to light.\n\n23. 'Soulcalibur II'\n\nPublisher: Namco\n\nYear: 2003\n\nAnother classic fighting game, Soulcalibur II featured great graphics, solid audio, tons of missions, weapons, and strategies, and even introduced a few new characters. This is a well-executed fighting game on every level.\n\n22. 'Jak 3'\n\nPublisher: Sony Computer Entertainment\n\nYear: 2004\n\nJak 3 is a great action-adventure FPS with smooth animations, terrific graphics, and a host of new weapons and abilities. Simply put, this is the best game in the Jak series\n\n21. 'Katamari Damacy'\n\nPublisher: Namco\n\nYear: 2004\n\nThe premise of this game is simple: create as big a katamari as possible by rolling up everything around you. The bigger the katamari, the more objects you’ll be able to pick up. This game is shockingly addictive and surprisingly gratifying.\n\n20. 'Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves'\n\nPublisher: Sony Computer Entertainment\n\nYear: 2005\n\nLike the other games in this series, Sly 3 is all about stealth. Accessible to everybody but challenging enough to keep serious gamers intrigued, this is just a solid platforming game.\n\n19. 'Silent Hill 2'\n\nPublisher: Konami\n\nYear: 2001\n\nSilent Hill 2is a classic in the survival horror genre and the best game in the series. It’s designed for mature audiences, relying on atmosphere and surreal elements to build a truly terrifying gaming experience.\n\n18. 'Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening'\n\nPublisher: Capcom\n\nYear: 2005\n\nDante’s Awakening is a step up from earlier Devil May Cry games. It tells the story of its half-human, half-devil protagonist while delivering great weapons and smooth action throughout. This is a classic PS2 hack and slash game.\n\n17. 'Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time'\n\nPublisher: Ubisoft\n\nYear: 2003\n\nSands of Timehas everything an adventure gamer could ask for: frenetic action, beautiful graphics, gravity-defying animations, a magical environment, and the handy Dagger to give us another chance when we falter.\n\n16. 'God of War'\n\nPublisher: Sony Computer Entertainment\n\nYear: 2005\n\nThe action in this franchise is nothing short of brutal, and this game started it all. Challenge the gods in a series of escalating battles, and then take a break to solve some puzzles.\n\n15. 'Grand Theft Auto III'\n\nPublisher: Rockstar Games\n\nYear: 2001\n\nGTA IIIchanged the landscape of video games forever. It was a cultural milestone that launched generations of imitators. We can still find our way from Portland to Shoreside Vale without using the map.\n\n14. 'ESPN NFL 2K5'\n\nDeveloper: Visual Concepts\n\nYear: 2004\n\nThis was the last of the non-Madden football games, and for a while, it was considered the best NFL game of all time. Critics loved the graphics and deep gameplay; we loved that it shipped for under $20.\n\n13. 'Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4'\n\nDeveloper: Atlus\n\nYear: 2008\n\nPersona 4 was truly unique – some might even say weird. The game is equal parts murder mystery, high school drama, and RPG. Playing it successfully means balancing your part-time job with your mission to restore the calm in a peaceful Japanese village shattered by a series of brutal slayings.\n\n12. 'Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal'\n\nPublisher: Sony Computer Entertainment\n\nYear: 2004\n\nThe third and finest installment in the Ratchet & Clank series, Up Your Arsenal features planet-hopping action and a massive arsenal of weapons and upgrades.\n\n11. 'Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty'\n\nPublisher: Konami\n\nYear: 2001\n\nThis game takes itself way too seriously, but the quest to take down the Sons of Liberty is the epitome of quality action-adventure gaming.\n\n10. 'Resident Evil 4'\n\nPublisher: Capcom\n\nYear: 2005\n\nAnother spine-tingling survival horror entry, Resident Evil 4is polished and expansive. There are more than 25 hours of gameplay to this story, with challenges at every turn.\n\n9. 'Final Fantasy X'\n\nPublisher: Square Enix\n\nYear: 2001\n\nThis might be our favorite traditional RPG on the whole PS2 roster. The universe is incredible, and FFX was a big step forward for cinematic gaming.\n\n8. 'Grand Theft Auto: Vice City'\n\nPublisher: Rockstar Games\n\nYear: 2002\n\nThis game has it all. Vice City is gaudy, violent, funny, and engrossing. The weapons selection is huge, the missions range from grim to zany, and the setting is a ray of faded 1980s sunshine. It’s time to revisit Vice City.\n\n7. 'Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater'\n\nPublisher: Konami\n\nYear: 2004\n\nThis was a new high-water mark for stealth action gaming. The graphics were improved, the environments were alive, and the storyline kept us engaged from beginning to end. Snake Eaterwas the best game in the series until MGS4 was released.\n\n6. 'Ico'\n\nPublisher: Sony Computer Entertainment\n\nYear: 2001\n\nA stunning example of video game as art, Ico is all about atmosphere. The setting is haunting and mysterious, and the environmental graphics are flawless throughout. This game will literally leave you speechless.\n\n5. 'Okami'\n\nPublisher: Capcom\n\nYear: 2006\n\nThis beautiful game asks you to reclaim the world from a curse and make it livable for all creatures once again. That’s not exactly blockbuster material, and this game was criminally slept on. But those of us who played it emerged as better people.\n\n4. 'God of War II'\n\nPublisher: Sony Computer Entertainment\n\nYear: 2007\n\nGod of War was groundbreaking; God of War II took the franchise to another level entirely. The already-epic action was enhanced by new magic and new combat movies, and the improved graphics made the mythological setting even more epic.\n\n3. 'Kingdom Hearts'\n\nPublisher: Square Enix\n\nYear: 2002\n\nKingdom Hearts, which features Disney characters like Donald Duck, is a surprisingly sophisticated game that combines elements of action and role-playing and follows a complex, polished storyline. Don’t let the goofy cast fool you.\n\n2. 'Shadow of the Colossus'\n\nPublisher: Sony Computer Entertainment\n\nYear: 2005\n\nEasily one of the most beautiful games ever created, Shadow of the Colossus tells a sweeping, heartbreaking story about the power of love and the pain of death. We’re getting emotional just thinking about it. Play this with a box of tissues nearby.\n\n1. 'Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas'\n\nPublisher: Rockstar Games\n\nYear: 2004"
