        "text": "In the future, on the planet Hillys, the population suffers from constant attacks from the alien DomZ. The situation is gradually getting worse, as the rate of DomZ kidnapings increases. The Alpha Section forces, who are in charge of protecting citizens, seem to be completely ineffective, not even fighting the DomZ. In the midst of this situation, the secretive organization IRIS alleges that the Alpha Section is involved in a massive government conspiracy, and seeks to expose the truth through journalism.\n\nThe player controls a young reporter and photographer named Jade with her companions Pey'j and Double H. After experiencing first-hand a DomZ attack, she is contacted by IRIS, who recruits her as an action reporter. Jade is now tasked with infiltrating the Alpha Section, exposing the government conspiracy, and ultimately finding the truth for herself.\n\nBeyond Good & Evil is an action game with diverse gameplay. Much of the game is based on stealth and puzzles, but there are sequences of racing, shooting, combat, and platform action. Jade fights with her staff and also uses various abilities to execute long-ranged attacks and solve puzzles. Many of the puzzles require switching between the characters and using their special abilities; often it is necessary to coordinate the actions of two characters to achieve precise co-operation that leads to a puzzle's solution. Besides hostile areas with puzzles and enemies, there is also a city and other friendly areas to explore, where various items and gadgets can (and sometimes must) be bought. There are several mini-games and even an online ranking system (used by entering codes online after they are assigned in-game when the game is saved).\n\n1001 Video Games\n\nBeyond Good & Evil appears in the book 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die by General Editor Tony Mott.\n\nJade\n\nJade's character design is actually based on her French voice actress Emma De Caunes.\n\nNietzsche\n\nIn an interview on LadyGamers.com, Tyrone Miller explains how the game relates to Nietzsche:\n\nMany people assume that Beyond Good & Evil is a reference to the Friedrich Nietzsche book by the same name. Although you could probably make an argument – this game really has no connection to the German philosopher. As an action reporter, players need to investigate beyond the superficial facts of what is good and what is evil – which is dictated through government propaganda in the game. The player has to see what nobody else can see, what is hidden to the people of Hyllis. This theme is relevant to issues we face today – understanding the reasons behind the apparent facts.\n\nPromotional websites\n\nThe publishers registered the websites for both the iris network (www.irisnetwork.net) and the Hyllian gov. (www.hylliannews.com) both featuring promotional material and assorted stuff.\n\nSave games code\n\nAll the saved games in Beyond Good & Evil are marked with an \"Internet Code\". The purpose of this code is two-fold, first it enables you to go to the official website and check your ranking against all the other BG&E players in the world. Secondly, upon completion of the main game, you'll be able to use your saved game code on the official website and obtain instructions on how to go about obtaining missing MDisk #13 within the game.\n\nSoundtrack\n\nIn the Beginning\n\nDancing With Domz\n\nHome Sweet Home\n\nHyllian Suite\n\nMammago's Garage\n\nIsle de Noir\n\nMineshaft Madness\n\nSay Cheese, Fellas\n\nAkuda House Propaganda\n\nAncient Chinese Secrets\n\nDon't Fear the Reaper\n\nFear the Reaper\n\nFun and Mini-Games\n\nFunky Bar 100\n\nWhen Domz Attack\n\nSlaughterhouse Scramble\n\nSneaky Jade Suite\n\nOrganic Beauty\n\nViolent Jade Suite\n\nHeart of Darkness\n\nMetal Gear Domz\n\nSomething Completely Different\n\nBehind Enemy Lines\n\nFree Your Mind\n\nThoughtful Reflections\n\nEnfants Disparus\n\nAbove and Beyond\n\nUnacceptable Losses\n\nIn Hot Pursuit\n\nSins of the Father\n\nRedemption\n\nIn February 2004, Ubisoft released MP3s of Beyond Good & Evil soundtrack to NintendoInsider.com. These are still available for download, but as of April 2005, downloaders must register with the web site and go to the Members-Only Board to receive a frequently changing password.\n\nTitle\n\nAccording to Michel Ancel, the game was originally to be named Between Good & Evil, but the marketing department did not like that name, so it was changed to Beyond Good & Evil.\n\nThe original title I gave the game was Between Good & Evil (see my first logo included) - which the marketing department didn’t like back then. For me, the meaning of this title is that you are always in the middle of an internal and external conflict, based on our conception of good and evil. In this game and in our world, propaganda thinks in our place; tells us these are our enemies and these are our friends. When you go beyond the appearances, you discover your own truth. That’s the theme of the game and marketing finally accepted this title, and just replaced the between by beyond, which fits better with the vast universe and story.\n\nAwards\n\n4Players\n\n2003 – Best PC Action-Adventure Game of the Year\n\n2003 – Best Console Direction of the Year\n\n2003 – Best PC Music of the Year\n\n2003 – Best PC Direction of the Year\n\n2003 – Biggest PC Surprise of the Year\n\nEGM\n\nFebruary 2006 (Issue #200) - #171 out of 200 of the \"Greatest Games of Their Time\"\n\nGameSpy\n\n2003 – #3 Game of the Year\n\n2003 – #2 GameCube Game of the Year\n\nPC Powerplay (Germany)\n\nIssue 06/2005 - #8 Likeable Secondary Character (for Pey'j)\n\nInformation also contributed by Big John WV, Mark Ennis, Sciere, Terrence Bosky, WildKard, WindowsKiller and Zovni"
