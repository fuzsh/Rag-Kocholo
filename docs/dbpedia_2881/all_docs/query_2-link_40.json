        "text": "After plenty of rumours, genuine leaks (including an actual playable build of the game appearing on the Xbox Store) and only the most essential elements acknowledged by Ubisoft, Beyond Good & Evil’s 20th Anniversary Edition is finally, nearly here.\n\nUbisoft revealed a shiny new trailer for the game overnight during the Limited Run Games Showcase, which also happens to be its “Launch Trailer,” as the game is due to release next week on June 25th for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Switch and PC.\n\nThis new version of the classic adventure will present the game in up to 4K and 60FPS with big improvements including an autosave feature, cutscene skipping, wider controller and keyboard/mouse support, cross-save across platforms and more. There’ll be new content and features as well like a new Anniversary Gallery full of never-before-seen artworks and videos, exclusive anecdotes, and “secret unreleased content,” plus a re-orchestrated soundtrack, a Speedrun Mode and updated achievements.\n\nInterestingly, Ubisoft also says this version of the game will contain a new mission that supposedly reveals more about the narrative link to the long-gestating and still mysterious sequel, Beyond Good & Evil 2, which at least confirms the company is still working away at it.\n\nCheck out the Launch Trailer for Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition below:\n\nFrom Ubisoft:\n\nWELCOME TO SYSTEM 4\n\nDiscover Hillys, a wonderfully odd maritime planet with sparse islands and a quirky flora and fauna. The diverse and wide areas of this semi-open world are teaming with life, from the busy streets of its vibrant capital city to the hidden caves of dormant volcanoes\n\nA PIONEERING ACTION-ADVENTURE GAME\n\nArmed with a Daï-Jo and her faithful Camera, Jade’s adventure will get you to freely explore Hillys, combat creatures large and small, infiltrate dangerous areas, solve enigmatic puzzles, play addictive mini-games, race the best Hovercraft pilots, and take pictures of the whole experience!\n\nAN UPGRADED EXPERIENCE\n\nEnjoy the game in a whole new light thanks to improved graphics, remapped controls, and updated audio, including more than 15 pieces of the iconic soundtrack re-recorded by a live orchestra under the direct supervision of Christophe Héral!"
