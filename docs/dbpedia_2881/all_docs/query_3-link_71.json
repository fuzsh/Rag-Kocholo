        "text": "Ubisoft Labs has announced the particularly titled Captain Laserhawk: the G.A.M.E.\n\nBased on the animated TV series Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix, which was inspired by Ubisoft’s Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon game — also including IP from other Ubisoft games including Assassin’s Creed, Rainbow Six and Beyond Good and Evil — the game is set in an alternative universe in which the US has become a dystopian technocracy called Eden and Rayman is the face of the regime.\n\nLabelled a “transmedia gaming adventure where the community drives the narrative through innovative governance”, Captain Laserhawk: the G.A.M.E. will be underpinned by 10,000 Citizen ID NFTs, which gate early access to the game, as well as recording governance activity. They will also provide users with the ability to earn in-game currency and rewards.\n\nAnd as the story unfolds, the entire community will have the opportunity to influence the plot and participate in key decision-making moments by unlocking, creating, and sharing content.\n\nIn terms of actual gameplay, Captain Laserhawk: the G.A.M.E. will be a competitive top-down shooter, while its blockchain elements will be handled using Sequence’s tech, running on Arbitrum.\n\n“With Arbitrum’s supercharged blockchain infrastructure and Sequence’s full web3 stack as the foundation, Captain Laserhawk: the G.A.M.E. is poised to be a groundbreaking player-driven project,” commented Ubisoft Labs VP Nicolas Pouard.\n\n“Here, players can have fun and actively contribute to the lore and evolution of the game. Blockchain features empower us to give the community a real voice in shaping the story, gameplay, and even side experiences. This fosters transparency and shared creation, paving the way for a truly collaborative future for Captain Laserhawk.”"
