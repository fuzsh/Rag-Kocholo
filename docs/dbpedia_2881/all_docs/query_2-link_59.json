        "text": "UPDATE: Ubisoft has issued a comment on the early and accidental release of Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition, blaming it on a \"technical error\". Ubisoft also confirmed an early 2024 release window.\n\n\"Due to a technical error, an early development version of Beyond Good & Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition was recently released to some Ubisoft+ subscribers,\" a Ubisoft spokesperson told IGN. \"As we celebrate the 20th anniversary of Beyond Good & Evil, we're excited to share that the official launch is set for early 2024, and we look forward to sharing more with you in the new year.\"\n\nORIGINAL STORY: Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition has appeared again, this time on Microsoft’s Xbox store.\n\nThe unannounced game appeared on the Xbox store overnight with a raft of screenshots before Microsoft pulled the listing offline.\n\nThe internet noticed and splurged the details online, of course, including Wario64 on X/Twitter (below). According to the listing, the Anniversary Edition has 4K resolution and 60 frames per second performance, with “improved graphics, controls, and audio, along with brand-new autosave and cross-save features”. Apparently there’s a new speedrun mode, too, and updated achievements.\n\nHere’s the official blurb:\n\nSwoop into the marvelous world of Hillys as action-reporter Jade to investigate the mysterious DomZ alien attacks alongside colorful characters, like her adoptive uncle Pey’j or the valiant Double H.\n\nEmbark on this epic adventure in up to 4K, 60 fps with improved graphics, controls, and audio, along with brand-new autosave and cross-save features.\n\nEnjoy exclusive new rewards as you explore the planet and discover more about Jade’s past in a new treasure hunt throughout Hillys.\n\nPut your skills to the test thanks to the new speedrun mode and updated achievements, and learn more about the game’s development and secrets in the anniversary gallery!\n\nArmed with her daï-jo and faithful camera, Jade’s adventure will get you to freely explore Hillys, combat creatures large and small, infiltrate dangerous areas, solve enigmatic puzzles, play addictive mini-games, race the best hovercraft pilots, and take pictures of the whole experience.\n\nBe ready to dive into a trailblazing blend of action gameplay and thrilling emotional cutscenes!\n\nThis game leverages Smart Delivery allowing access to both the Xbox One title and the Xbox Series X and S title.\n\nUbisoft’s Beyond Good & Evil first launched on November 11, 2003, so we’ve skipped past the actual 20th anniversary. Still, it's likely an announcement and launch is imminent. IGN has asked Ubisoft for comment.\n\nIn August, the Electronic Software Ratings Board (ESRB) rated Beyond Good & Evil: 20th Anniversary Edition for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC, so a release is expected across all platforms.\n\nBeyond Good & Evil 2 was officially announced in 2017 and has been in the works in varying states of capacity ever since. It’s unclear when or if this game will see the light of day as updates from Ubisoft have been non-existent, and it's reportedly still in pre-production even after more than six years of development.\n\nIn IGN’s 9/10 Beyond Good & Evil review, we said: “While it's over a bit before you'd want it to be, Beyond Good & Evil tells its story with amazing pizzazz and polish. Even better, it's a story well worth telling.”\n\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
