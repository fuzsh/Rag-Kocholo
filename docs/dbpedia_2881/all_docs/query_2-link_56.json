        "text": "I think this is an error on their end. They said on the steam discussion forums there would be achievements, the steamdb backend shows that they enabled some flags for achievements, and I don't even see achievements in Ubisoft connect.\n\nEither way hope they fix it soon.\n\nGawd I hope you're right!\n\nIt doesn't use Steam Cloud, but still has cloud saves through Ubisoft Connect. Almlst all (if not all) Ubisoft game on Steam does this fyi.\n\nGood to know, I noticed this with PoP: The Lost Crown on PS5.\n\ni posted in the other (closed) thread, so once again:\n\nvisual mode on ps5 runs at 60 fps (so far). is there any reason to go with performance mode?\n\na warning:\n\ni just arrived at the black island and fought some of the thorax (?) and jellyfish enemies. both of them have a constant flicker effect applied to them, which triggered my photosensitivity. so, just a fair warning for everyone suffering from migraine/photo sensitivity.\n\ngame is unplayable for me and i can only hope that they patch this.\n\nI hear people talkign that the Switch version has a mandatory ubi soft account requirement, but that is not correct, right?\n\nI don't have a game but people complained for Avatar and PoP The Lost Crown. And BG&E now has Ubisoft Connect integration so chances that it doesn't require account are low.\n\nIt doesn't. I'm playing with the airplane mode turned on and it attempts to connect to Ubi servers but when it fails, it starts the game without having to create account/log in.\n\ni posted in the other (closed) thread, so once again:\n\nvisual mode on ps5 runs at 60 fps (so far). is there any reason to go with performance mode?\n\na warning:\n\ni just arrived at the black island and fought some of the thorax (?) and jellyfish enemies. both of them have a constant flicker effect applied to them, which triggered my photosensitivity. so, just a fair warning for everyone suffering from migraine/photo sensitivity.\n\ngame is unplayable for me and i can only hope that they patch this.\n\nYeah this is terrible, just reached this part. Definitely seems like a bug but needs to be fixed ASAP. I'm not photosensitive and it bothered me.\n\nShows up on the app for me.\n\nI had to search \"Beyond good\" to find it.\n\nBeen playing in Resolution mode and its mostly smooth with a few small hiccups at times. I'm quite happy with it though and am enjoying the game. Definitely worth playing if you haven't yet with the low asking price.\n\nYup, see it now. Have the controls been changed? i remember on PS2 the controls took some getting used to, was not as straightforward, kept me from getting the other remakes over the years.\n\nYeah it plays mostly like a modern game now with better camera control too.\n\nYes there is new controls, you can use original controls if you choose. I think they feel fine (new controls)\n\nCool. My mom put me on this game 20 years ago, she saw it in the store for a low price and just picked it up gave it to me when she got home. She would sit on the bed and watch me play, she aint around anymore but it will be nice to play this again, i remember it being a very good game.\n\nThe Switch port has a 30fps lock, which is somewhat disappointing as the original at least on GC and Xbox was locked to 60fps and was actually fairly good at reaching that (PS2 was also capped at 60 but had much more significant trouble reaching that). On top of that, Switch drops well below even 30 when things get busy. Especially when there's a lot of transparencies or particles being thrown around. While i'm not great at counting pixels, it looks like the resolution is sub 900p/1080p even when docked. Textures are also significantly lower resolution than the other versions and the reflections in bodies of water are also extremely low res and have very significant stairstepping on the edges of objects. The reflection surface also has a subtle flicker that I don't recall in the original game, but looks odd and unintentional.\n\nIn my opinion, the Switch port is pretty disappointing. The remaster does obviously look better than the original. Upgrades to the lighting are quite apparent as is texture resolution. And some model upgrades here and there. But it's still not a game that visually looks like it was made for the PS5 or even PS4. In fact, i'd say it looks more like a middle-step between the Xbox and Xbox 360 generation (outside of the other console and PC versions supporting much higher resolutions). Given what i've seen, I don't think the performance on Switch is acceptable. Nor the resolution if i'm being honest. I believe this could and should have been at least a 900p and mostly 60fps experience on Switch.\n\nGame is making my ROG Ally crash, with a need for a hard reboot. That's unfortunate.\n\nLooks like the PC version has a major issue with AMD chipsets. It also crashes on my UM780 XTX PC, both with the onboard graphics, and when I try using an attached dock with a 7600M GFX card.\n\nUbisoft seem to be aware, so a patch should be out shortly.\n\nWeird how it doesn't crash on the Steam Deck though. Must be a problem specific to Windows.\n\nGuess I gotta wait a day or two before I can dive into it then.\n\nthere's something very rushed about this release (on PC at least). Some main logo images on Steam and even Ubisoft's site are squished, Ubisoft Connect Challenges don't seem to unlock when you access the list in game but Ubi Connect displays them unlocking at seemingly random intervals along with taking screenshots on its own, the screenshot folder for the game doesn't even have the game name - it's called Test_R, and the game doesn't even show up among your recently played games on Ubisoft Connect.\n\nThe song is called Spanish bar if I am not mistaken\n\nI honestly don't know where that name came from and why so many people use. It's only officially been called \"Fun and Mini Games\" (I uploaded the OST to youtube 16 years ago)\n\nI'm gonna have this Propaganda song stuck in my head all night, I just know it\n\nEDIT: So interestingly, despite there only being one local manual save slot, you can upload up to five saves online. It lets you upload your manual save or the autosaves. You have to press down on the d-pad, go to the settings icon, and then go into the online saves menu.\n\nEDIT 2: I got a couple of Ubisoft challenges done, but none of them seemed to actually unlock even though the pop-ups for them appeared in-game?"
