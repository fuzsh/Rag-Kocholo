        "text": "Metro GameCentral\n\nGameCentral\n\n7 / 10\n\nA mere remaster can't hide all the foibles of a 20-year-old game, but this is a well-crafted tribute to a classic PlayStation 2 era game, that has long deserved a proper sequel.\n\nRead full review\n\nBeyond Good & Evil: 20th Anniversary Edition is a remaster that few asked for, but it offers good technical improvements, adds new content and brings us a little closer to Beyond Good & Evil 2. If you have never played it you should give it a try and if you did, it never hurts to enjoy it again if you are a fan of the saga.\n\nReview in Spanish | Read full review\n\nTheSixthAxis\n\nSteve C\n\n9 / 10\n\nBeyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary really is the best way to play this classic cult title, bringing it up to date in terms of controls, resolutions and more. The underlying game may show its age at times, especially during the enforced stealth sections, but there is so much charm and character here that it deserves a whole new audience.\n\nRead full review\n\nBeyond Good & Evil: 20th Anniversary Edition takes one of Michel Ancel's best works and recaptures its multi-genre format at a very different time in gaming. Pure early millennium action in a great adventure that mixes mechanics to still feel as fresh and as powerful as it did almost 21 years ago. Ubisoft sets the stage for Beyond Good and Evil 2 with a powerful gallery full of content, a new Speed Run mode and a new mission in the final stretch that better explains the story of Jade and her nature.\n\nReview in Spanish | Read full review\n\nUbisoft dusts off its 2003 cult game for the second time with a successful Anniversary Edition. The game has never been a masterpiece, but it still entertains today as it did 21 years ago.\n\nReview in Italian | Read full review\n\nBeyond Good & Evil is an absolute classic, and the 20th Anniversary Edition makes it easier than ever to appreciate why. The characters are endearing, the visuals are mostly amazing, the music is incredible, and the gameplay is a ton of fun on top of all that. If this is your first time stepping into Jade's sneakers or your 20th, now has never been a better time to explore the beauty of Hillys.\n\nRead full review\n\nBeyond Good and Evil turns 20 and returns to our screens with the inevitable signs of time, which however have not totally spoiled the freshness of its gameplay, a still valid story and a cast among the best ever created by Ubisoft.\n\nReview in Italian | Read full review"
