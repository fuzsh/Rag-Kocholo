        "text": "Press Start also gave the Anniversary Edition a score of 8 out of 10, calling it a \"pleasing revival of a cult classic\":\n\n\"Beyond Good & Evil's 20th Anniversary Edition does a commendable job of freshening up an experience that had long aged out of its must-play status. Enhanced visuals that don't dull the original charm, welcome quality-of-life and control improvements and a nice smattering of extra content go a long way to making this a worthwhile revisit to Hillys.\"\n\nYouTube channel SwitchUp said the Switch version was an easy recommendation, awarding it 88%:\n\n\"I can forgive the gameplay for some of its more dated aspects, yes - some its animations feel well 20 years old, but there's so much excellent stuff here.\"\n\nThe Sixth Axis gave it 9 out of 10, summing up this new experience as the best way to play this classic:\n\n\"Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary really is the best way to play this classic cult title, bringing it up to date in terms of controls, resolutions and more. The underlying game may show its age at times, especially during the enforced stealth sections, but there is so much charm and character here that it deserves a whole new audience.\"\n\nAnd last of all, Metro gave the Anniversary Edition a slightly lower score of 7 out of 10 but still had high praise for the title:\n\n\"This is undoubtedly one of the best PlayStation 2 remasters ever made and quite the birthday present for Beyond Good & Evil fans (even if the 20th was technically last Christmas). The game definitely shows its age at times, but this remaster makes a compelling argument for why a sequel should happen. But even if it doesn’t, we’ll always have the original and this newly definitive version of it.\""
