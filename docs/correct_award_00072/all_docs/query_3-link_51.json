        "text": "Most people have learned about issues in the USA’s past through standard history courses. However, certain topics may seem out of reach until they are contextualized in an individual’s home state and seen through firsthand accounts. Child labor, the horrors of the prison system, and “insane” asylums are all topics that most people have basic understandings of. In this exhibit, we aim to display some of the more horrific elements of Maryland’s specific role in these industries and give students of our University a wider understanding of the state in which they study.\n\nLooking through archives is a critical step in discovering Maryland’s disturbing past. However, it is also important to acknowledge the gaps and lack of minority representation exhibited in the archives, therefore, accounts may be biased or have a one-sided view. Through lots of exploring, and searching we were able to uncover information regarding the treatment of groups in Maryland, and the terrible conditions that they faced. In order to create a society in which these injustices stop occurring, we must educate ourselves on what has been done wrong.\n\nContinue reading →\n\n“After having read and reread, sifted and tested the mass of information which came before us, I have come to the conclusion that Richard M. Nixon has, beyond a reasonable doubt, committed impeachable offenses which, in my judgment, are of sufficient magnitude that he should be removed from office. The evidence convinces me that my President has lied repeatedly, deceiving public officials and the American people.” ~Lawrence J. Hogan, July 23, 1974\n\nLawrence J. Hogan spoke these words in his speech, “Why I Will Vote for Impeachment,” before the House Judiciary Committee on July 23, 1974, four days before the House Judiciary Committee voted on the First Article of impeachment. As a member of the Judiciary Committee (1971-1974), Hogan was one of 38 committee members who presided over the formal hearings on the impeachment proceedings against President Richard M. Nixon for his questionable role in the Watergate scandal and other illegal activities. Hogan was the first Republican minority committee member to call for the impeachment of President Nixon and the only Republican to vote yes on all three articles of impeachment [1]. Hogan was also the father of Larry Hogan, Maryland’s 62nd Governor (2015-2023), and was a big inspiration for his son’s own journey and career in politics as they both navigated the challenging times to their respective eras.\n\n(“The 38 who weigh Nixon’s fate,” New York Times Magazine, April 28, 1974, Lawrence Joseph Hogan, Sr. papers, 0256-MDHC.)\n\nContinue reading →\n\nThe last post in this series was about “Searching Archival Collections”, so it may be strange that this one is about “Searching Digital Collections”, but it is important to note some differences. Even though you may see digital results in your search of archival collections, these are presented as the lowest priority in the results that are generated by your keyword search! This means you might miss them or would have to filter through other materials before you even see the digital material.\n\nSearching the archival collections makes all of our processed collections with finding aids discoverable. The Digital Collections provide access to only a portion of our holdings that has been digitized. This comprises of only a small part of our holdings (perhaps only 1-2% of our holdings on site!). We encourage you to use both in your research process to enjoy a robust research experience.\n\nSearching for digital content has many benefits including:\n\nAccessibility\n\nDistance learning\n\nGreat starting point for your research process\n\nSupplement research with visual and audio aides\n\nDeepen value of your research with richer context\n\nAlso unlike the archival collections, the digital collections are organized into different databases, depending on the material you are looking for. This video will cover how to search for non-audiovisual materials such as digitized student newspapers and yearbooks, photographs, maps and more.\n\nScotty Beland is a student in the Masters of Library and Information Sciences program and Student Assistant with the Instruction and Outreach team at UMD.\n\nThe Poet Laureate of Maryland is an honorary State position. The selected poet serves at the discretion of the Governor and provides public readings and special programs for the citizens of Maryland. In 1959 the Maryland General Assembly authorized the Governor to appoint a citizen of the State as Poet Laureate of Maryland. Originally the Poet Laureate served for three years however, some Poets Laureates have been reappointed. Vincent Godfrey Burns served the longest as Poet Laureate of Maryland for 17 years, followed by Stanley Plumly who served for 9 years.\n\nSpecial Collections and University Archives holds the personal papers of six of the ten Poets Laureate of Maryland. In the collection are the Vincent Godfrey Burns papers, who was Poet Laureate of Maryland from 1962 until his death in 1979; the Reed Whittemore papers, the Linda Pastan papers and the Roland Flint papers. Two forthcoming collections are the Michael Collier papers and the Stanley Plumly papers.\n\nExplore the Vincent Godfrey Burns papers finding aid.\n\nExplore the Reed Whittemore papers finding aid.\n\nExplore the Linda Pastan papers finding aid.\n\nExplore the Roland Flint papers finding aid.\n\nTo view any of the Maryland Poet Laureate collections visit the Maryland Room in Hornbake Library or if you have any questions, please contact us!\n\nWhat is a finding aid?\n\nA finding aid is a description of the contents of a collection, similar to a table of contents you would find in a book. A collection’s contents are often grouped logically and describe the group of items within each folder. You rarely find descriptions of the individual items within collections. Finding aids also contain information about the size and scope of collections. Additional contextual information may also be included.\n\nWilliam Faulkner (1897-1962) was an American author of novels, short stories, essays, poems, and dramatic works. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1949, and was a two-time recipient of the Pulitzer Prize. The University of Maryland’s William Faulkner papers represents an artificially assembled group of lesser-known writings by and about Faulkner in the form of manuscripts, correspondence, and clippings from literary journals, as well as items related to his life in Oxford, Mississippi, his work in Hollywood, and audio recordings of Faulkner reading his work.\n\nIn addition to archival material related to William Faulkner, Special Collections and University Archives hold several of Faulkner’s novels which can be found through the library catalog under the location Marylandia and Rare books.\n\nExplore the William Faulkner papers finding aid.\n\nTo view any items in the collection visit the Maryland Room in Hornbake Library or if you have any questions, please contact us!\n\nWhat is a finding aid?\n\nA finding aid is a description of the contents of a collection, similar to a table of contents you would find in a book.

After the death of his father, the family moved to New England, which provided the backdrop for Frost’s trademark regional poetry. Frost initially encountered difficulties in establishing himself as a published poet in American newspapers and literary journals. After little success in America, Frost and his family moved to England for three years, which proved to be more fertile publishing ground. By the time he returned to the United States in 1915, Frost had published two well-received full-length collections, A Boy’s Will (1913) and North of Boston (1914), which solidified his reputation on both continents. By the 1920s, he was the most celebrated poet in America. Frost was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for literature four times: for New Hampshire (1923), Collected Poems (1930), A Further Range (1936), and A Witness Tree (1942). Frost had the honor of participating in President John F. Kennedy’s inauguration ceremonies, 1961, by reading his poems “Dedication” and “The Gift Outright.” This collection includes manuscripts of “Closed for Good” and “The Middleness of the Road”; page proofs of the verse drama A Masque of Reason (1942) and galley proofs of Steeple Bush (1947); art work, photographs, correspondence, work papers, awards, sheet music, serials, and audio recordings of Frost. The collection is unprocessed, but a preliminary inventory is available.\n\nIn addition to archival material related to Robert Frost, Special Collections and University Archives also hold The Robert Frost Book Collection, a comprehensive collection of books by and about Robert Frost containing many works annotated by Frost. Included in the collection are boxed sets of custom Christmas cards and pamphlets designed and annotated by Frost.\n\nExplore the Robert Frost papers finding aid.\n\nExplore The Robert Frost Book Collection.\n\nTo view any items in the collection visit the Maryland Room in Hornbake Library or if you have any questions, please contact us!\n\nWhat is a finding aid?\n\nA finding aid is a description of the contents of a collection, similar to a table of contents you would find in a book.

In 1915, he married Vivienne (Vivien) Haigh-Wood. He was literary editor of the avant-garde magazine The Egoist. In the Spring 1917, he published his first book of poetry, Prufrock and Other Observations. In 1922, Eliot became editor of The Criterion. In June 1927, he was baptized into the Church of England, and, in November, became a British citizen. His religion then became a central component of his life and his poetry reflected this religious conversion. In 1948, Eliot received both the Order of Merit and the Nobel Prize for Literature. The collection includes correspondence; manuscripts and proofs of published Eliot literary works such as “Lines to a Persian Cat,” “In silent corridors of death,” and “The Love-Song of J. Arthur Prufrock;” galley proofs for plays and collections of poetry; manuscripts of Vivienne (Haigh-Wood) Eliot; serial publications with contributions by Eliot; newspaper clippings; a proof of a literary review of Eliot; manuscripts written by other individuals; programs and playbills.\n\nExplore the T.S.

Finding aids also contain information about the size and scope of collections. Additional contextual information may also be included.\n\nAt this point in this series we have discussed quite a bit of background material. Now we can shift gears to practical skills to use when searching archival collections!\n\nAs you may recall, archival research is a bit different from other types of research. Many researchers are familiar with Google’s search function or maybe even with searching library databases, and in some ways our archival collections search functions similarly. We often search our collections for keywords based on our research interests and what collections we have. Each library and archive will differ, but in our case, the results generated are based on algorithms and priorities that systems determine. While these systems can aid in searchability and discovery, it is important to understand that the first result is not necessarily the best result for your research.\n\nUnlike Google which will pull results from across the Internet, the results generated by our archival search functions depend solely on what is contained within our collections. These collection entries are indexed as machine-readable documents which can then by queried and then presented to the searcher based on “relevance” or “scoring” (Apache Solr, n. d.). Scoring is dependent on how documents are indexed and how the query was entered (Apache Lucene, 2013).\n\nThere are sophisticated tools in our search functions for refining your search. You can filter your results by date range, library, type, people or language, and there are a few ways to add additional search terms. Learn more about conducting archival searchers at the University of Maryland Special Collections and University Archives by watching the video below. Searching for some types of materials in our collections such as Rare Books and Digital Collections varies from this tutorial… stay tuned for more on that!\n\nScotty Beland is a student in the Masters of Library and Information Sciences program and Student Assistant with the Instruction and Outreach team at UMD."
