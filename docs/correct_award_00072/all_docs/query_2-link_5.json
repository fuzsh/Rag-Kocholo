        "text": "Award\n\n1949 Nobel Prize in LiteratureWilliam FaulknerDate\n\n10 November 1950 (announcement)\n\n10 December 1950\n\n(ceremony)\n\nLocationStockholm, SwedenPresented bySwedish AcademyFirst awarded1901WebsiteOfficial website\n\n← 1948 · Nobel Prize in Literature · 1950 →\n\nThe 1949 Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded the American author William Faulkner (1897–1962) \"for his powerful and artistically unique contribution to the modern American novel.\"[1] The prize was awarded the following year on October 1950. The Nobel Committee for Literature had decided that none of the nominations for 1949 met the criteria as outlined in the will of Alfred Nobel, and the prize was reserved until the following year.[1]\n\nLaureate[edit]\n\nMain article: William Faulkner\n\nWilliam Faulkner generally is regarded as one of the most significant American writers of all time. Faulkner wrote 13 novels and many short stories but started as a poet. With his breakthrough novel, The Sound and the Fury (1929), he began to use stream of consciousness to portray a character's flow of inner thoughts. His books often are told from the point of view of several characters and contain accurately rendered colloquialisms combined with long sentences full of imagery and language that is sometimes surreal. Among his other famous works include As I Lay Dying (1930), Light In August (1934) and Absalom! Absalom! (1936).[2][3]\n\nDeliberations[edit]\n\nNominations[edit]\n\nWilliam Faulkner was not nominated for the prize in 1949,[4] but he was nominated the following year and in 1950 the Swedish Academy decided to award Faulkner the Nobel Prize in Literature for 1949. Faulkner was nominated by Prince Wilhelm, Duke of Södermanland who became the president of the Swedish PEN Centre.[4] Faulkner had not been nominated for the prize before, making it a rare occasion when an author have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature the same year they were first nominated.[5]\n\nIn total, the Nobel Committee received 43 nominations for authors such as Benedetto Croce, Thornton Wilder, Winston Churchill (awarded in 1953), François Mauriac (awarded in 1952), Carl Sandburg, Georges Duhamel, and Pär Lagerkvist (awarded in 1951). 9 of the nominees were nominated first-time among them Albert Camus (awarded in 1957), Leonid Leonov, Enrique González Martínez, Alfonso Reyes, Taha Hussein, and Alberto Moravia. Three of the nominees were women: Marie Under, Henriette Charasson, and Dorothy Canfield Fisher.\n\nThe authors James Truslow Adams, Hervey Allen, Chairil Anwar, Rex Beach, Elsa Bernstein, Maurice Blondel, Jacques Copeau, Will Cuppy, Lucien Descaves, Ali Douagi, William Price Drury, Inés Echeverría Bello, Herbert Eulenberg, Martin Grabmann, Yaroslav Halan, Edmond Jaloux, Klaus Mann, Sarojini Naidu, Elin Pelin, Gustav Radbruch, Alexander Serafimovich, George Shiels, Elin Wägner, and Oton Župančič died in 1949 without having been nominated for the prize.\n\nOfficial list of nominees and their nominators for the prize No. Nominee Country Genre(s) Nominator(s) 1 Shmuel Yosef Agnon (1887–1970) Israel novel, short story Hugo Bergmann (1883–1975) 2 Mark Aldanov (1886–1957) Soviet Union\n\n(Ukraine)\n\nFrance biography, novel, essays, literary criticism Ivan Bunin (1870–1953) 3 Riccardo Bacchelli (1891–1985) Italy novel, drama, essays 4 Eugène Baie (1874–1964) Belgium law, essays Maurice Maeterlinck (1862–1949) 5 Albert Camus (1913–1960) France novel, short story, essays, philosophy, drama Hjalmar Gullberg (1898–1961) 6 Dorothy Canfield Fisher (1879–1958) United States novel, short story, pedagogy, essays David Baumgardt (1890–1963) 7 Hans Carossa (1878–1956) Germany poetry, autobiography, essays Henry Olsson (1896–1985) 8 Henriette Charasson (1884–1972) France poetry, essays, drama, novel, literary criticism, biography Serge Barrault (1887–1976) 9 Winston Churchill (1874–1965) United Kingdom history, essays, memoir\n\nNils Ahnlund (1889–1957)\n\nBirger Nerman (1888–1971)\n\n10 Benedetto Croce (1866–1952) Italy history, philosophy, law 11 Georges Duhamel (1884–1966) France novel, short story, poetry, drama, literary criticism\n\nMartin Lamm (1880–1950)\n\nHjalmar Hammarskjöld (1862–1953)\n\n12 Johan Falkberget (1879–1967) Norway novel, short story, essays\n\nRichard Beck (1897–1980)\n\nAndreas Hofgaard Winsnes (1889–1972)\n\n13 Enrique González Martínez (1871–1952) Mexico poetry Antonio Castro Leal (1896–1981) 14 Jacinto Grau Delgado (1877–1958) Spain drama, essays, short story, literary criticism Hjalmar Gullberg (1898–1961) 15 Taha Hussein (1889–1973) Egypt novel, short story, poetry, translation Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed (1872–1963)[a] 16 Pär Lagerkvist (1891–1974) Sweden poetry, novel, short story, drama Erik Ekelund (1897–1976) 17 Halldór Laxness (1902–1998) Iceland novel, short story, drama, poetry Jón Helgason (1899–1986) 18 Leonid Leonov (1899–1994) Soviet Union drama, novel, short story Valentin Kiparsky (1904–1983) 19 André Malraux (1901–1976) France novel, essays, literary criticism Martin Lamm (1880–1950) 20 François Mauriac (1885–1970) France novel, short story\n\nHenri Peyre (1901–1988)\n\nGustaf Hellström (1882–1953)\n\n21 Ramón Menéndez Pidal (1869–1968) Spain philology, history Gunnar Tilander (1894–1973) 22 Alberto Moravia (1907–1990) Italy novel, literary criticism, essays, drama Hjalmar Gullberg (1898–1961) 23 Charles Langbridge Morgan (1894–1958) United Kingdom drama, novel, essays, poetry Elias Wessén (1889–1981) 24 Seán O'Casey (1880–1964) Ireland drama, memoir Oscar Wieselgren (1886–1971) 25 Arnulf Øverland (1889–1968) Norway poetry, essays\n\nMartin Lamm (1880–1950)\n\nLorentz Eckhoff (1884–1974)\n\nHarry Fett (1875–1962)\n\n26 Boris Pasternak (1890–1960) Soviet Union poetry, novel, translation Maurice Bowra (1898–1971) 27 Alfonso Reyes Ochoa (1889–1959) Mexico philosophy, essays, novel, poetry Gabriela Mistral (1889–1957)[b] 28 Carl Sandburg (1878–1967) United States poetry, essays, biography Einar Tegen (1884–1965) 29 George Santayana (1863–1952) Spain\n\nUnited States philosophy, essays, poetry, novel Giuseppe Antonio Borgese (1882–1952) 30 Mikhail Sholokhov (1905–1984) Soviet Union novel Valentin Kiparsky (1904–1983) 31 Angelos Sikelianos (1884–1951) Greece poetry, drama Sigfrid Siwertz (1882–1970) 32 John Steinbeck (1902–1968) United States novel, short story, screenplay Henri Peyre (1901–1988) 33 Reinaldo Temprano Azcona (1911–1954) Spain essays Emilio Alarcos García (1895–1986) 34 Marie Under (1883–1980) Soviet Union\n\n(Estonia) poetry Hjalmar Hammarskjöld (1862–1953) 35 Thornton Wilder (1897–1975) United States drama, novel, short story Yngve Brilioth (1891–1959)\n\nPrize decision[edit]\n\nOn 3 November 1949 the Swedish Academy announced that no Nobel Prize in Literature would be awarded that year: \"No Nobel Prize in Literature will be awarded this year. And the justification, in short, is that none of this year's candidates has been able to gather the absolute majority required according to the statutes for the prize to be awarded. For the time being, two literature prizes are therefore at the Academy's disposal next year. In 1918 and 1935 the same measure was taken on the same grounds.”[6]\n\nThe Academy awarded the prize for 1949 the following year to William Faulkner, while Bertrand Russell was awarded the 1950 Nobel Prize in Literature.[7]\n\nAward ceremony speech[edit]\n\nIn his award ceremony speech on 10 December 1950, Gustaf Hellström, member of the Swedish Academy, said of Faulkner: \"As a probing psychologist he is the unrivalled master among all living British and American novelists. Neither do any of his colleagues possess his fantastic imaginative powers and his ability to create characters. His subhuman and superhuman figures, tragic or comic in a macabre way, emerge from his mind with a reality that few existing people – even those nearest to us – can give us\", \"Moreover – side by side with Joyce and perhaps even more so – Faulkner is the great experimentalist among twentieth-century novelists. Scarcely two of his novels are similar technically. It seems as if by this continuous renewal he wanted to achieve the increased breadth which his limited world, both in geography and in subject matter, cannot give him. The same desire to experiment is shown in his mastery, unrivalled among modern British and American novelists, of the richness of the English language, a richness derived from its different linguistic elements and the periodic changes in style – from the spirit of the Elizabethans down to the scanty but expressive vocabulary of the Negroes of the southern states.\"[8]\n\nAcceptance speech[edit]\n\nAt the banquet, Faulkner read his acceptance speech, which he ended with an affirmation of faith:\n\n\"I believe that man will not merely endure: he will prevail. He is immortal, not because he alone among creatures has an inexhaustible voice, but because he has a soul, a spirit capable of compassion and sacrifice and endurance.\"\n\nThe speech was later made available in print.[9]\n\nReactions[edit]\n\nThe choice of William Faulkner as the Nobel Prize Laureate was well received.[10] Faulkner himself at first refused to travel to Sweden to accept the award, but was persuaded by friends and his wife to travel. At the banquet in Stockholm on 10 December 1950 he held a memorable acceptance speech. Faulkner eventually gave away the prize money in scholarships and other bequests.[9]\n\nNotes[edit]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n[edit]"
