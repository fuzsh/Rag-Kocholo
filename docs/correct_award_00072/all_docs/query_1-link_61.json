It tells the story of Thomas Sutpen and his ruthless, single-minded attempt to forge a dynasty in Jefferson, Mississippi, in 1830. Although his grand design is ultimately destroyed by his own sons, a century later the figure of Sutpen continues to haunt young Quentin Compson, who is obsessed with his family legacy and that of the Old South. \"Faulkner's novels have the quality of being lived, absorbed, remembered rather than merely observed,\" noted Malcolm Cowley. \"Absalom, Absalom! is structurally the soundest of all the novels in the Yoknapatawpha series--and it gains power in retrospect.\" This edition follows the text of Absalom, Absalom! as corrected in 1986 under the direction of Faulkner expert Noel Polk and features a new Foreword by John Jeremiah Sullivan.\n\nAs I Lay Dying by William Faulkner; E. L. Doctorow (Foreword by)\n\nCall Number: GENERAL FAU\n\nISBN: 9780375504525\n\nSelected by the Modern Library as one of the 100 best novels of all time From the Modern Library's new set of beautifully repackaged hardcover classics by William Faulkner--also available are Snopes, The Sound and the Fury, Light in August, Absalom, Absalom!, and Selected Short Stories One of William Faulkner's finest novels, As I Lay Dying, originally published in 1930, remains a captivating and stylistically innovative work. The story revolves around a grim yet darkly humorous pilgrimage, as Addie Bundren's family sets out to fulfill her last wish: to be buried in her native Jefferson, Mississippi, far from the miserable backwater surroundings of her married life. Told through multiple voices, As I Lay Dying vividly brings to life Faulkner's imaginary South, one of literature's great invented landscapes, and is replete with the poignant, impoverished, violent, and hypnotically fascinating characters that were his trademark. Along with a new Foreword by E. L. Doctorow, this edition reproduces the corrected text of As I Lay Dying as established in 1985 by Faulkner expert Noel Polk.\n\nLight in August by William Faulkner\n\nCall Number: GENERAL FAU\n\nISBN: 9780679732266\n\n\"Read, read, read. Read everything--trash, classics, good and bad, and see how they do it. Just like a carpenter who works as an apprentice and studies the master. Read! You'll absorb it. Then write. If it is good, you'll find out. If it's not, throw it out the window.\" --William Faulkner Light in August, a novel about hopeful perseverance in the face of mortality, features some of Faulkner's most memorable characters: guileless, dauntless Lena Grove, in search of the father of her unborn child; Reverend Gail Hightower, who is plagued by visions of Confederate horsemen; and Joe Christmas, a desperate, enigmatic drifter consumed by his mixed ancestry.\n\nSelected Short Stories by William Faulkner\n\nCall Number: PS3511.A86 A6 1993\n\nISBN: 9780679424789\n\nFrom the Modern Library's new set of beautifully repackaged hardcover classics by William Faulkner--also available are Snopes, As I Lay Dying, The Sound and the Fury, Light in August, and Absalom, Absalom! William Faulkner was a master of the short story. Most of the pieces in this collection are drawn from the greatest period in his writing life, the fifteen or so years beginning in 1929, when he published The Sound and the Fury. They explore many of the themes found in the novels and feature characters of small-town Mississippi life that are uniquely Faulkner's. In \"A Rose for Emily,\" the first of his stories to appear in a national magazine, a straightforward, neighborly narrator relates a tale of love, betrayal, and murder. The vicious family of the Snopes trilogy turns up in \"Barn Burning,\" about a son's response to the activities of his arsonist father. And Jason and Caddy Compson, two other inhabitants of Faulkner's mythical Yoknapatawpha County, are witnesses to the terrorizing of a pregnant black laundress in \"That Evening Sun.\" These and the other stories gathered here attest to the fact that Faulkner is, as Ralph Ellison so aptly noted, \"the greatest artist the South has produced.\"\n\nThe Sound and the Fury by William Faulkner; Marilynne Robinson (Foreword by)\n\nCall Number: GENERAL FAU\n\nISBN: 9780679600176\n\nSelected by the Modern Library as one of the 100 best novels of all time From the Modern Library's new set of beautifully repackaged hardcover classics by William Faulkner--also available are Snopes, As I Lay Dying, Light in August, Absalom, Absalom!, and Selected Short Stories The Sound and the Fury, first published in 1929, is perhaps William Faulkner's greatest book. It was immediately praised for its innovative narrative technique, and comparisons were made with Joyce and Dostoyevsky, but it did not receive popular acclaim until the late forties, shortly before Faulkner received the Nobel Prize for Literature. The novel reveals the story of the disintegration of the Compson family, doomed inhabitants of Faulkner's mythical Yoknapatawpha County, through the interior monologues of the idiot Benjy and his brothers, Quentin and Jason. Featuring a new Foreword by Marilynne Robinson, this edition follows the text corrected in 1984 by Faulkner expert Noel Polk and corresponds as closely as possible to the author's original intentions. Included also is the Appendix that Faulkner wrote for The Portable Faulkner in 1946, which he called the \"key to the whole book.\"\n\nWilliam Faulkner: 'The Sound and the Fury' by Michael Cotsell\n\nCall Number: e-book\n\nISBN: 9781847600554\n\nThis study is intended both for first-time readers of The Sound and the Fury andsince it offers new scholarship and critical argument on Faulknerfor established critics and scholars. Chapter 1 provides some general context about Faulkners life and work in the American South and Yoknapatawpha County, and introduces the form and style of Faulkners novel. Chapter 2 provides a discussion of the contexts of Southern history and Faulkners family history. Chapter 3 is a discussion of the influences on Faulkner of Modernist literature and Modernist psychology and philosophy. Chapter 4 gives a close commentary on each of the novel's four narratives.\n\nWilliam Faulkner by Daniel J. Singal\n\nCall Number: e-book\n\nISBN: 9780807823552\n\nAmid all that has been published about William Faulkner, one subject--the nature of his thought--remains largely unexplored. But, as Daniel Singal's new intellectual biography reveals, we can learn much about Faulkner's art by relating it to the cultural and intellectual discourse of his era, and much about that era by coming to terms with his art. Through detailed analyses of individual texts, from the earliest poetry through Go Down, Moses, Singal traces Faulkner's attempt to liberate himself from the repressive Victorian culture in which he was raised by embracing the Modernist culture of the artistic avant-garde. To accommodate the conflicting demands of these two cultures, Singal shows, Faulkner created a complex and fluid structure of selfhood based on a set of dual identities--one, that of a Modernist author writing on the most daring and subversive issues of his day, and the other, that of a southern country gentleman loyal to the conservative mores of his community. Indeed, it is in the clash between these two selves, Singal argues, that one finds the key to making sense of Faulkner.\n\nVirginia Woolf and the Politics of Language by Judith Allen\n\nCall Number: e-book\n\nISBN: 9780748636754\n\n\"A passionate, political and provocative study\" Patricia Clements, Professor Emeritus, University of Alberta, and founding director of The Orlando Project Times Higher Education Magazine \"The distillation of many years of sparklingly erudite scholarship and continuing incisive debate, Judith Allen's book is essential reading for anyone concerned by current and disturbing ramifications of the politics of language and the language of politics in the modern world. She provides a generously open guide to many of Woolf's most influential essays as well as to her major manifestos, A Room of One's Ownand Three Guineas\" Dr Jane Goldman, Reader in English Literature, University of Glasgow \"Guided by Montaigne's trenchant question, 'What do I know?', Judith Allen shows how the lexicon of war in the twenty-first century can be revealed in all its lamentable 'truthiness' by paying attention to what Virginia Woolf's essays have to say about the power of language to transform our world. This is a book that makes refreshingly clear Woolf's deep political engagement with the urgent issues of war and peace.\" Mark Hussey, Editor, Woolf Studies Annual Judith Allen's timely study ranges from Michel de Montaigne to Jon Stewart, from the Northcliffe Press empire of World War I to Rupert Murdoch's current media empire, and explores the increasing influence of social media. Allen approaches Woolf as a theorist of language as well as a theorist of reading, and shows how her writing strategies - sometimes single, resonant words - function to express and enact her politics. Close readings of many essays, including 'Montaigne' and 'Craftsmanship', reveal how Woolf's complex arguments serve to awaken her readers to the complexities and power of language.\n\nModernism and Eugenics by Donald J. Childs\n\nCall Number: e-book\n\nISBN: 9780521806015\n\nIn Modernism and Eugenics, first published in 2001, Donald Childs shows how Virginia Woolf, T. S. Eliot and W. B. Yeats believed in eugenics, the science of race improvement and adapted this scientific discourse to the language and purposes of the modern imagination. Childs traces the impact of the eugenics movement on such modernist works as Mrs Dalloway, A Room of One's Own, The Waste Land and Yeats's late poetry and early plays. The language of eugenics moves, he claims, between public discourse and personal perspectives. It informs Woolf's theorization of woman's imagination; in Eliot's poetry, it pictures as a nightmare the myriad contemporary eugenical threats to humankind's biological and cultural future. And for Yeats, it becomes integral to his engagement with the occult and his commitment to Irish Nationalism. This is an interesting study of a controversial theme which reveals the centrality of eugenics in the life and work of several major modernist writers.\n\nExiles by James Joyce\n\nCall Number: PR6019 .O9 E9 2002\n\nISBN: 9780486424606\n\nOne of the most widely read novelists of the twentieth century, James Joyce is famed for his mastery of expression. His unprecedented exploration of the English language, in particular, has made him one of the most influential writers of modern times. This three-act play was first published in 1918; and like much of Joyce's other works, it is an imaginative reconstruction of his own life. In it, Richard Rowan, an Irish writer who has spent much time abroad, feels estranged from Irish society when he returns to Dublin. Focusing on the love entanglements between Rowan; his common-law wife, Bertha; and his friends, the story is requisite reading for devotees of this brilliant author.\n\nDeviant Modernism by Colleen Lamos\n\nCall Number: e-book\n\nISBN: 9780521624183\n\nThis original study re-evaluates central texts of the modernist canon - Eliot's early poetry including The Waste Land, Joyce's Ulysses and Proust's Remembrance of Things Past - by examining sexual energies and identifications in them that are typically regarded as perverse. According to modern cultural discourses and psychosexual categorizations, these deviant desires and identifications feminize men, or tend to render them homosexual. Colleen Lamos's analysis of the operations of gender and sexuality in these texts reveals conflicts, concerning the definition of masculine heterosexuality, which cut across the aesthetics of modernism. She argues that canonical male modernism, far from being a monolithic entity with a coherently conservative political agenda, is in fact the site of errant impulses and unresolved struggles. What emerges is a reconsideration of modernist literature as a whole, and a recognition of the heterogeneous forces which formed and deformed modernism.\n\nJames Joyce and the Exilic Imagination by Michael Patrick Gillespie\n\nCall Number: e-book\n\nISBN: 9780813060651\n\n\"As Gillespie combines national, geographical, and historical contexts with close readings of Joyce's works, the theme of exile takes on unexpected nuances, from spiritual displacements in Joyce's neglected play Exiles to the trials of dealing with a 'foreign' language in Finnegans Wake.\"--Margot Norris, editor of Dubliners \"Casts significant new light on Joyce's writings by bringing out memorable ways in which the literal experience of exile enabled Joyce to recast retrospectively the exilic quality of living in Ireland, not simply as alienation but as a mixture of rancor and affection that colors the lives in all his fiction.\"--John Paul Riquelme, editor of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man \"The argument is buttressed by numerous readings of crucial passages whose meaning becomes more ambiguous or indeterminate when Joyce's standing as an exile is taken into consideration. An important work of critical revaluation.\"--Patrick A. McCarthy, author of Ulysses: Portals of Discovery James Joyce left Dublin in 1904 in self-imposed exile. Though he never permanently returned to Ireland, he continued to characterize its capital city in his prose throughout the rest of his life. This volume elucidates the ways Joyce wrote about his homeland with conflicting bitterness and affection--a common ambivalence in expatriate authors, whose time in exile tends to reshape their creative approach to the world. Yet this duality has not been explored in Joyce's work until now. The first book to read Joyce's writing through the lens of exile studies, James Joyce and the Exilic Imagination challenges the tendency of scholars to stress the writer's negative view of Ireland. Instead, it showcases the often-overlooked range of emotional attitudes imbuing Joyce's work and argues that attentiveness to these oscillating perspectives is necessary for a full understanding of Joyce's canon.\n\nJames Joyce and the Mythology of Modernism by Daniel M. Shea\n\nCall Number: e-book\n\nISBN: 9783898215749\n\n\"James Joyce and the Mythology of Modernism\" examines anew how myth exists in Joyce's fiction. Using Joyce's idiosyncratic appropriation of the myths of Catholicism, this study explores how the rejected religion still acts as a foundational aesthetic for a new mythology of the Modern age starting with \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\" and maturing within \"Ulysses\". Like the mythopoets before him-Homer, Dante, Milton, Blake-Joyce consciously sets out to encapsulate his vision of a splintered and rapidly changing reality into a new aesthetic which alone is capable of successfully rendering the fullness of life in a meaningful way. Already reeling from the humanistic implications of an impersonal Newtonian universe, the Modern world now faced an Einsteinian one, a re-evaluation which includes Stephen's awakening from the \"nightmare\" of history, a re-definition of deity, and Bloom's urban identity. Written with both the experienced Joycean and the beginner in mind, this book tells how the Joycean myth is our own conception of the human being, and our place in the universe becomes (re)defined as definitively Modernist, yet still, through Molly Bloom's final affirmation, profoundly human.\n\nModernists at Odds by Matthew J. Kochis; Heather L. Lusty\n\nCall Number: e-book\n\nISBN: 9780813060477\n\n\"Challenges the unhelpful polarization of Lawrence and Joyce in much twentieth-century literary criticism and offers intriguing alternatives to what is surely a reductive approach to the achievements of both writers.\"--Fiona Becket, author of The Complete Critical Guide to D. H. Lawrence \"A groundbreaking collection. Sexuality, censorship, publishing, and rivalry are all treated with a fresh eye; cutting-edge archival research is brought to the fore; and new perspectives such as ecocriticism are among the many highlights.\"--Susan Mooney, author of The Artistic Censoring of Sexuality Modernism's most contentious rivals, James Joyce and D. H. Lawrence, were polar opposites--stylistically, personally, and professionally--yet their lives, works, and careers bear striking similarities. They shared the same literary agent, published in the same literary magazines, fought legal battles against censorship, and were both pirated by Samuel Roth. This is the first book to explore the resonances between the two writers, shattering the historical silence between Joyceans and Lawrentians. The parallels run deep between these epic figures of the literary canon, and this volume explores the classic modernist paradoxes shared by the two writers. Both were at once syncretists and shatterers, bourgeois cosmopolitans, prudish libertines, displaced nostalgists, and rebels against their native lands. Considering mutual themes such as gender, class, horseracing, nature, religion, exile, and modernism's fascination with Egyptology, these essays highlight the many intersections in the major novels and short fiction of Joyce and Lawrence. Modernists at Odds is a long overdue extended comparison of two of the most compelling writers of the twentieth century.\n\nParallaxes, on Virginia Woolf and James Joyce by Marco Canani; Sara Sullam\n\nCall Number: e-book\n\nISBN: 9781443856232\n\nBorrowed from optics, the concept of parallax identifies the apparently relative position of objects according to the lines of sight determined by the standpoint of the viewer. This concept proves particularly useful in opening new insights into the work of two major authors of Modernist literature: although coincidentally born and deceased in the same years (1882-1941), James Joyce and Virginia Woolf are seldom the object of a joint outlook. Such a watertight separation is witnessed by the scarcity of scholarly works concerned with the relationship between two authors who, on the other hand, often feature together in studies and anthologies on Modernism. Parallaxes fills this void by tackling the many implications of Woolf and Joyce's difficult - if not failed-encounter, and provides new perspectives on the connections between their work. The essays in the volume investigate the works of the two writers - seven decades after their death - from a variety of angles, both singularly and jointly, stimulating dialogue between scholars in both Woolf and Joyce studies.\n\nThe Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald; Matthew J. Bruccoli (Preface by)\n\nCall Number: GENERAL FIT\n\nISBN: 9780684830421\n\nThe exemplary novel of the Jazz Age, F. Scott Fitzgeralds' third book, The Great Gatsby (1925), stands as the supreme achievement of his career. T. S. Eliot read it three times and saw it as the \"first step\" American fiction had taken since Henry James; H. L. Mencken praised \"the charm and beauty of the writing,\" as well as Fitzgerald's sharp social sense; and Thomas Wolfe hailed it as Fitzgerald's \"best work\" thus far. The story of the fabulously wealthy Jay Gatsby and his love for the beautiful Daisy Buchanan, of lavish parties on Long Island at a time when, The New York Times remarked, \"gin was the national drink and sex the national obsession,\" it is an exquisitely crafted tale of America in the 1920s that resonates with the power of myth. A novel of lyrical beauty yet brutal realism, of magic, romance, and mysticism, The Great Gatsby is one of the great classics of twentieth-century literature. This is the definitive, textually accurate edition of The Great Gatsby, edited by Matthew J. Bruccoli and authorized by the estate of F. Scott Fitzgerald. The first edition of The Great Gatsby contained many errors resulting from Fitzgerald's extensive revisions and a rushed production schedule, and subsequent editions introduced further departures from the author's intentions. This critical edition draws on the manuscript and surviving proofs of the novel, along with Fitzgerald's later revisions and corrections, to restore the text to its original form. It is The Great Gatsby as Fitzgerald intended it.\n\nTender Is the Night by F. Scott Fitzgerald; Charles Scribner (Introduction by)\n\nCall Number: ROMANCE FIT\n\nISBN: 9780684801544\n\nPublished in 1934, Tender Is the Night was one of the most talked-about books of the year. \"It's amazing how excellent much of it is,\" Ernest Hemingway said to Maxwell Perkins. \"I will say now,\" John O'Hara wrote Fitzgerald, \"Tender Is the Night is in the early stages of being my favorite book, even more than This Side of Paradise.\" And Archibald MacLeish exclaimed: \"Great God, Scott...You are a fine writer. Believe it -- not me.\" Set on the French Riviera in the late 1920s, Tender Is the Night is the tragic romance of the young actress Rosemary Hoyt and the stylish American couple Dick and Nicole Diver. A brilliant young psychiatrist at the time of his marriage, Dick is both husband and doctor to Nicole, whose wealth goads him into a lifestyle not his own, and whose growing strength highlights Dick's harrowing demise. A profound study of the romantic concept of character -- lyrical, expansive, and hauntingly evocative -- Tender Is the Night, Mabel Dodge Luhan remarked, raised F. Scott Fitzgerald to the heights of \"a modern Orpheus.\"\n\nF. Scott Fitzgerald at Work by Horst H. Kruse\n\nCall Number: e-book\n\nISBN: 9780817318390\n\nF. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby occupies a preeminent place in American letters. Scholars have argued that Jay Gatsby is, in fact, the embodiment of American cultural and social aspiration. Though The Great Gatsby has been studied in detail since its publication, both readers and scholars have continued to speculate about Fitzgerald’s sources of inspiration. The essays in F. Scott Fitzgerald at Work examine fresh facts that illuminate the experiences and source materials upon which Fitzgerald based this quintessentially American masterpiece. They confirm author Horst Kruse’s view that Fitzgerald’s flights of fancy, even at their most spectacular, are firmly grounded in biographical experience as well as in the social, literary, and philosophical circumstances of his era. In the first essay, Kruse reconstructs the life story of the individual who allegedly inspired the character of Jay Gatsby: Max von Gerlach. Kruse recounts his journeys to various archives and libraries in the United States as well as in Germany to unearth new facts about the genesis of the Gatsby characters. In another journey, readers travel with Kruse to Long Island to explore its physical and moral geography in relation to Fitzgerald, specifically the role of certain elite Long Island families in the advancement of the \"science of eugenics” movement. The final two essays take Kruse across the globe to various destinations to consider the broader place of The Great Gatsby in American and international intellectual history. Replete with fascinating discoveries and insights, F. Scott Fitzgerald at Work both corrects previous assumptions about The Great Gatsby and deepens our appreciation and understanding of Fitzgerald's imagination.\n\nF. Scott Fitzgerald by Jackson R.

Gale\n\nCall Number: e-book\n\nISBN: 9780313301391\n\nF. Scott Fitzgerald is one of the most challenging authors of American literature. He is known internationally as the author of \"The Great Gatsby\" (1925), a twentieth-century literary classic studied by high school students and scholars alike. But Fitzgerald was an amazingly productive writer despite numerous personal and professional difficulties. From the beginning of his literary career with the publication of \"This Side of Paradise\" in 1920 to his death in 1940, he wrote 5 novels, roughly 180 short stories, numerous essays and reviews, much poetry, several plays, and some film scripts. Even when he wrote hastily and perhaps bleary-eyed, his works almost always exhibit the flashes of his genius. He is celebrated as a symbol of the Jazz Age and the Roaring Twenties, but beneath all the glitter for which his prose is famous, he warns of the dangers of personal recklessness and praises the redemptive power of love. Through hundreds of alphabetically arranged entries, this reference book provides complete coverage of Fitzgerald's life and writings. The volume begins with a chronology that traces his rise from obscurity to fame, his struggles with alcoholism, and his eventual financial downfall. The entries that follow give a full and detailed picture of Fitzgerald and his work. They present the essential action in Fitzgerald's novels, short stories, plays, and poems; identify all named fictional characters and indicate their significance; and give brief biographical information for Fitzgerald's family members, friends, and professional associates. Many of the entries include bibliographies which emphasize criticism published after 1990, and the volume closes with a general bibliography of the most important broad studies of Fitzgerald and his works. A thorough index and extensive cross references provide additional access to the wealth of information in this reference book and help make it a useful tool for a wide range of users.\n\nThe New Death by Pearl James\n\nCall Number: e-book\n\nISBN: 9780813934082\n\nAdopting the term \"new death,\" which was used to describe the unprecedented and horrific scale of death caused by the First World War, Pearl James uncovers several touchstones of American modernism that refer to and narrate traumatic death. The sense of paradox was pervasive: death was both sanctified and denied; notions of heroism were both essential and far-fetched; and civilians had opportunities to hear about the ugliness of death at the front but often preferred not to. By historicizing and analyzing the work of such writers as Willa Cather, Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and William Faulkner, the author shows how their novels reveal, conceal, refigure, and aestheticize the violent death of young men in the aftermath of the war. These writers, James argues, have much to say about how the First World War changed death's cultural meaning.\n\nA Farewell to Arms by Ernest Hemingway; Patrick Hemingway (Foreword by); Sean Hemingway (Introduction by)\n\nCall Number: GENERAL HEM\n\nISBN: 9781476764528\n\nThe definitive edition of the classic novel of love during wartime, featuring all of the alternate endings: “Fascinating…serves as an artifact of a bygone craft, with handwritten notes and long passages crossed out, giving readers a sense of an author’s process” (The New York Times). Written when Ernest Hemingway was thirty years old and lauded as the best American novel to emerge from World War I, A Farewell to Arms is the unforgettable story of an American ambulance driver on the Italian front and his passion for a beautiful English nurse. Set against the looming horrors of the battlefield—weary, demoralized men marching in the rain during the German attack on Caporetto; the profound struggle between loyalty and desertion—this gripping, semiautobiographical work captures the harsh realities of war and the pain of lovers caught in its inexorable sweep. Ernest Hemingway famously said that he rewrote the ending to A Farewell to Arms thirty-nine times to get the words right. This edition collects all of the alternative endings together for the first time, along with early drafts of other essential passages, offering new insight into Hemingway’s craft and creative process and the evolution of one of the greatest novels of the twentieth century. Featuring Hemingway’s own 1948 introduction to an illustrated reissue of the novel, a personal foreword by the author’s son Patrick Hemingway, and a new introduction by the author’s grandson Seán Hemingway, this edition of A Farewell to Arms is truly a celebration.\n\nRunning with the Bulls by Valerie Hemingway\n\nCall Number: PS3515.E37 Z54 2004\n\nISBN: 9780345467331\n\nSent to interview Ernest Hemingway while working as a reporter in Spain in 1959, Valerie Hemingway was quickly adopted by the literary figure. At the age of 19, a few months after their first meeting, Ernest asked Valerie to become his secretary, but she became more than an employee to this mythic man; she became a constant companion to him and his wife Mary, joining them to watch the bullfights Ernest loved in Pampalona, for long dinners and dancing in the streets of Bilboa, and month-long travels across the Spanish and French countryside.In 1960, Hemingway asked her to travel with him to Cuba, where he taught her to fish on his boat, the Pilar, where she typed draft after draft of 'A Moveable Feast', and Hemingway confessed to her his suicidal thoughts. Upon his death in 1961, Valerie accompanied Mary, Hemingway's widow, to Cuba to sort through the thousands of papers left untouched since his departure for Sun Valley months before. From 1966 until their divorce in 1987 Valerie was married to Hemingway's estranged son Gregory, whom she met at Hemingway's funeral. Valerie and Gregory had four children together, in addition to four from Gregory's two previous marriages.From lunches with Orson Wells to reading early drafts of Hemingway's manuscripts to being serenaded by Frank Sinatra in Spain, Valerie Hemingway was witness to nearly every moment of Hemingway's final two years. Now, with unprecedented access to his personal papers and photographs, Valerie Hemingway offers a unique glimpse into the final years of this literary genius.\n\nThe Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway by Ernest Hemingway (Preface by)\n\nCall Number: PS3515.E37 A6 1995\n\nISBN: 9780684803340\n\nAt the age of twenty-two, Ernest Hemingway wrote his first short story, \"Up in Michigan.\" Seventeen years and forty-eight titles later, he was the undisputed master of the short-story form and the leading American man of letters. The Short Stories, introduced here with a revealing preface by the author, chronicles Hemingway's development as a writer, from his earliest attempts in the chapbook Three Stories and Ten Poems, published in Paris in 1923, to his more mature accomplishments in Winner Take Nothing. Originally published in 1938 along with The Fifth Column, this collection premiered \"The Capital of the World\" and \"Old Man at the Bridge,\" which derive from Hemingway's experiences in Spain, as well as \"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber\" and \"The Snows of Kilimanjaro,\" which figure among the finest of Hemingway's short fictions.\n\nThe Sun Also Rises by Ernest Hemingway\n\nCall Number: GENERAL HEM\n\nISBN: 9780684830513\n\nThe quintessential novel of the Lost Generation,The Sun Also Rises is one of Ernest Hemingway’s masterpieces and a classic example of his spare but powerful writing style. A poignant look at the disillusionment and angst of the post-World War I generation, the novel introduces two of Hemingway’s most unforgettable characters: Jake Barnes and Lady Brett Ashley. The story follows the flamboyant Brett and the hapless Jake as they journey from the wild nightlife of 1920s Paris to the brutal bullfighting rings of Spain with a motley group of expatriates. First published in 1926, The Sun Also Rises helped establish Hemingway as one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century.\n\nFitzgerald and Hemingway by Scott Donaldson\n\nCall Number: e-book\n\nISBN: 9780231148177\n\nF. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway might have been contemporaries, but our understanding of their work often rests on simple differences. Hemingway wrestled with war, fraternity, and the violence of nature. Fitzgerald satirized money and class and the never-ending pursuit of a material tomorrow. Through the provocative arguments of Scott Donaldson, however, the affinities between these two authors become brilliantly clear. The result is a reorientation of how we read twentieth-century American literature. Known for his penetrating studies of Fitzgerald and Hemingway, Donaldson traces the creative genius of these authors and the surprising overlaps among their works. Fitzgerald and Hemingway both wrote fiction out of their experiences rather than about them. Therefore Donaldson pursues both biography and criticism in these essays, with a deep commitment to close reading. He traces the influence of celebrity culture on the legacies of both writers, matches an analysis of Hemingway's Spanish Civil War writings to a treatment of Fitzgerald's left-leaning tendencies, and contrasts the averted gaze in Hemingway's fiction with the role of possessions in The Great Gatsby. He devotes several essays to four novels, Gatsby, Tender Is the Night, The Sun Also Rises, and A Farewell to Arms, and others to lesser-known short stories. Based on years of research in the Fitzgerald and Hemingway archives and brimming with Donaldson's trademark wit and insight, this irresistible anthology moves the study of American literature in bold new directions.\n\nErnest Hemingway by Mark Cirino\n\nCall Number: e-book\n\nISBN: 9780299286545\n\nErnest Hemingway's groundbreaking prose style and examination of timeless themes made him one of the most important American writers of the twentieth century. Yet in Ernest Hemingway: Thought in Action, Mark Cirino observes, \"Literary criticism has accused Hemingway of many things but thinking too deeply is not one of them.\" Although much has been written about the author's love of action--hunting, fishing, drinking, bullfighting, boxing, travel, and the moveable feast--Cirino looks at Hemingway's focus on the modern mind, paralleling the interest in consciousness of such predecessors and contemporaries as Proust, Joyce, Woolf, Faulkner, and Henry James. Hemingway, Cirino demonstrates, probes the ways his character's minds respond when placed in urgent situations or when damaged by past traumas. In Cirino's analysis of Hemingway's work through this lens--including such celebrated classics as A Farewell to Arms, The Old Man and the Sea, and \"Big Two-Hearted River\" and less-appreciated works including Islands in the Stream and \"Because I Think Deeper\"--an entirely different Hemingway hero emerges: intelligent, introspective, and ruminative.\n\nModernity and Progress by Ronald Berman\n\nCall Number: e-book\n\nISBN: 9780817314682\n\nBreaks new critical ground by exploring philosophical and aesthetic issues germane to the writings of three major modern literary figures. In the 1920s and '30s, understandings of time, place, and civilization were subjected to a barrage of new conceptions. Ronald Berman probes the work of three writers who wrestled with one or more of these issues in ways of lasting significance. Hemingway, Fitzgerald, and Orwell all grappled with fluid notions of time: Hemingway’s absolute present, Fitzgerald’s obsession with what might be and what might have been, and Orwell’s concerns with progress. For these authors, progress is also tied to competing senses of place--for Fitzgerald, the North versus the South; for Hemingway, America versus Europe. At stake for each is an understanding of what constitutes true civilization in a post-war world. Berman discusses Hemingway’s deployment of language in tackling the problems of thinking and knowing. Berman follows this notion further in examining the indisputable impact upon Hemingway’s prose of Paul C#65533;zanne’s painting and the nature of perception. Finally, Berman considers the influence on Orwell of Aristotle and Freud’s ideas of civilization, translated by Orwell into the fabric of 1984 and other writings. Ronald Berman is Professor of English at the University of California at San Diego and past chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities. He is author of six books, including \"The Great Gatsby” and Fitzgerald’s World of Ideas and Fitzgerald-Wilson-Hemingway: Language and Experience.\n\nStudent Companion to Ernest Hemingway by Lisa Tyler\n\nCall Number: e-book\n\nISBN: 9780313310560\n\nThe fully-lived, yet tragically ended life of Ernest Hemingway has attracted nearly as much attention as his extensive canon of writings. This critical study introduces students to both the man and his fiction, exploring how Hemingway confronted in his own life the same moral issues that would later create thematic conflicts for the characters in his novels. In addition to the biographical chapter which focuses on the pivotal events in Hemingway's personal life, a literary heritage chapter overviews his professional developments, relating his distinctive style to his early years as a journalist. With clear concise analysis, students are guided through all of Hemingway's major works including The Sun Also Rises (1926), A Farewell to Arms (1929), For Whom the Bell Tolls (1940), and The Old Man and the Sea (1952). Full chapters are also devoted to examining his collections of short fiction, the African Stories, and the posthumous works. Each chapter carefully examines the major literary components of Hemingway's fiction with plot synopsis, analysis of character development, themes, settings, historical context, and stylistic features. Alternate critical readings are also given for each of the full length works. An extensive bibliography citing all of Hemingway's writings as well as biographical sources, general criticism, and contemporary reviews will help students understand the scope of Hemingway's contributions to American Literature.\n\nKafka's Social Discourse by Mark E. Blum\n\nCall Number: e-book\n\nISBN: 9781611460087\n\nThe first edition of this book was a first book for atomic spectroscopists to present the basic principles of experimental designs, optimization and multivariate regression. Multivariate regression is a valuable statistical method for handling complex problems (such as spectral and chemical interferences) which arise during atomic spectrometry. However, the technique is underused as most spectroscopists do not have time to study the often complex literature on the subject. This practical introduction uses conceptual explanations and worked examples to give readers a clear understanding of the technique. Mathematics is kept to a minimum but, when required, is kept at a basic level. Practical considerations, interpretations and troubleshooting are emphasized and literature surveys are included to guide the reader to further work. The same dataset is used for all chapters dealing with calibration to demonstrate the differences between the different methodologies. Readers will learn how to handle spectral and chemical interferences in atomic spectrometry in a new, more efficient and cost-effective way."
