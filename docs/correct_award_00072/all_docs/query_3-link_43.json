In fact, when he lived, there was no such thing as Americans.\n\nWhat awards did William Shakespeare win?\n\nThey did not have literary awards in Shakespeare's day like they do now. There were no Pulitzer Prizes or Nobel Prizes for Literature. The only kind of award Shakespeare got was a grant of a coat of arms, and that was in spite of his having the ungentlemanly occupation of a \"player\". Shakespeare was well-respected as a writer, as Francis Meres' Palladis Tamia testifies. But he won no awards for it."
