        "text": "William Faulkner's Biography\n\nWilliam Cuthbert Faulkner was born on September 25th, 1897, in New Albany, Mississippi. He belonged to an upper-middle-class family and was the oldest of four sons. His father, a treasurer for a railroad company, was named Murry Cuthbert Falkner, and his mother was Maud Butler. When William was a young child, the family moved to Oxford, Mississippi, and he would continue to live in the Mississippi town for most of his life.\n\nGrowing up in Mississippi, Faulkner was surrounded by stories of the Civil War, the Ku Klux Klan, and family history. These included stories about his great-grandfather, Colonel William Clark Falkner, who had been a Confederate hero. These stories and his Mississippi childhood had a significant influence on his writings.\n\nAnother early influence was Faulkner's mother, who loved to read and taught her sons to value education and literature.\n\nFaulkner worked hard in school as a young child, skipping the second grade. However, later in his school career, he was forced to repeat the eleventh and twelfth grades and did not ultimately graduate high school. Despite the lack of academic success, Faulkner remained independently interested in literature and the study of Mississippian history.\n\nDid you notice that the last name Faulkner is spelled Falkner in William's father's name? This is reportedly because of a typesetter's error in 1918, which introduced the extra letter. Unconcerned, William Faulkner adopted this new spelling.\n\nAs a young man, Faulkner began writing poetry and short stories. He met Mississippi attorney Phil Stone, a well-educated man who recognized Faulkner's talent and became his mentor. Stone helped Faulkner try unsuccessfully to publish some of his first short stories and introduced the young writer to literature that would become a life-long influence.\n\nIn 1918, William Faulkner joined the Royal Canadian Air Force, hoping to realize his dreams of flying. World War I ended before he completed training, however, leaving Faulkner to return to Mississippi full of stories of false combat. That next year, back home in Oxford, Faulkner enrolled in the University of Mississippi, but he dropped out after only three semesters.\n\nWilliam Faulkner Quotes\n\nMemory believes before knowing remembers. Believes longer than recollects, longer than knowing even wonders.\" —Light in August (1932)\n\nThis quote is the first line of Chapter 6 in Light in August. Here, the novel goes back in time to tell the story of five-year-old Joe Christmas growing up in an orphanage. It refers to the importance of memory and history in shaping Faulkner's characters. He writes about memories and impressions that are formed without conscious thought but have significant ramifications for an individual's core beliefs, influencing their character and actions for years to come. This phrase also highlights Faulkner's writing style, bending prose almost to the point of poetry.\n\nHe had a word, too. Love, he called it. But I had been used to words for a long time. I knew that that word was like the others: just a shape to fill a lack; that when the right time came, you wouldn't need a word for that any more than for pride or fear.\" —As I Lay Dying (1930)\n\nThis quote comes from Addie, the dead wife and mother in Faulkner's As I Lay Dying. Addie expresses the belief that words are inadequate or unnecessary because they are created by someone who has never experienced the thing that the word conveys. The person who experiences pride or fear or love doesn't need a word for it. Here, Addie refers to her husband, Anse, a man she was never able to love and to whose love she was indifferent.\n\nBecause Father said clocks slay time. He said time is dead as long as it is being clicked off by little wheels; only when the clock stops does time come to life.\" —The Sound and the Fury (1929)\n\nThis quote comes from the second chapter of The Sound and the Fury, narrated by Quentin, one of the Compson children. In the novel, Faulkner repeatedly questions our use and perception of time with the non-linear structure of his writing and also with the story itself. For example, the character Benjy has a mental disability and therefore has no concept of time. Quentin, on the other hand, is obsessed with the passage of time and continually wishes to stop time or live in the past.\n\nI believe that man will not merely endure: he will prevail. He is immortal, not because he alone among creatures has an inexhaustible voice, but because he has a soul, a spirit capable of compassion and sacrifice and endurance. The poet's, the writer's, duty is to write about these things. It is his privilege to help man endure by lifting his heart, by reminding him of the courage and honor and hope and pride and compassion and pity and sacrifice which have been the glory of his past. The poet's voice need not merely be the record of man, it can be one of the props, the pillars to help him endure and prevail.\" —Nobel Prize banquet speech (1950)\n\nThis quote comes from Faulkner's speech after being awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. Faulkner gave the speech during the start of the Cold War, and he spoke to the writer's role in society. The writer, and in particular the poet, does not exist solely to record the human experience but to contribute to it. Literature can uplift humanity by reflecting and reminding us of our merits.\n\nWilliam Faulkner - Key takeaways\n\nWilliam Cuthbert Faulkner was born on September 25, 1897, in New Albany, Mississippi.\n\nOxford, Mississippi, would become the inspiration for the fictional Yoknapatawpha County, where many of Faulkner's novels and short stories are set.\n\nFaulkner worked on films as a scriptwriter in Hollywood during the 30s, 40s, and 50s.\n\nSome of William Faulkner's most important novels include The Sound and the Fury (1929), As I Lay Dying (1930), and Light in August (1932).\n\nFaulkner was awarded the 1949 Nobel Prize for Literature.\n\nWilliam Faulkner died of a heart attack on July 6, 1962, when he was 64 years old.\n\n1Garrett, Jr., George P. \"An Examination of the Poetry of William Faulkner.\" The Princeton University Library Chronicle, vol. 18, no. 3, 1957.\n\n2Faulkner, William. \"The Art of Fiction.\" The Paris Review, issue 12, 1956."
