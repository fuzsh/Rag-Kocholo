The bylaws of the competition also require a specific minimum number of entries for each catgeory, with the the competition cancelled for any category that does not reach the required number of entries. Because of the specific problems caused by the pandemic and collateral issues, entries received in categories cancelled for lack of sufficient entries automatically will be entered in the 2023-24 competition.\n\nWho Can Enter?\n\nThe William Faulkner – William Wisdom Competition is open to all writers anywhere working in the English language. Although foreign residents are welcome to enter the competition, transportation to and from areas outside the continental United States is not paid the Society. For foreign residents selected as winners, the Society will pay transportation from one of these U. S. airports of entry: New York, NY, Washington, DC, Atlanta, GA, Miami, FL, Houston, TX, Chicago, IL or Dallas, TX.\n\nManuscript Requirements\n\nAll manuscripts entered must be unpublished works of fiction, non-fiction or poetry as of postmarked date of entry. Should a manuscript be published in any form after it is entered or should a contract or plans for publication be negotiated or announced during the competition period, the entry will not be disqualified. As a major goal of the Society and the competition is publication, however, the cash prize will be decreased by 33 per cent. A work will be considered previously published if more than 25 percent has been published in any form. Self published or on-demand works will be considered published, unless the author presents an official statement that less than 500 copies have been sold. Such manuscripts are not accepted in book format. If a self-published manuscript should win a category, the prize for the category will be decreased by one-third. Works from which brief sections have been excerpted for quotation in literary journals, news journals, broadsides will not be disqualified. Manuscripts published in their entirety on the Internet are considered published, regardless of where on the Internet a manuscript appears.\n\nAny suspected plagiarism discovered and confirmed will immediately disqualify a manuscript, regardless of when discovered, even if the plagiarism is discovered after a manuscript’s author has been notified that he or she is the winner. The work of finalists is examined carefully for lack of originality.\n\nPlease do not send us your collections and expect us to select one piece as the entry.\n\nPoets! Do not send us multiple poems and expect us to select one. Each entry is a single poem accompanied by a separate entry form and check for entry fee.\n\nElectronic entries will consist of attached material. Do not embed entry material in the body of the e-mail message.\n\nWinners\n\nOnly one cash and gold medal prize is offered in any category. For a winning work by\n\nco-authors, the cash prize is divided, not multiplied, although two medals would be awarded. We do not select ties. In 2018, the Society’s Board has voted and confirmed that there will be one winner, one runner-up for each category.\n\nBarring extraordinary circumstances, winners must be present in New Orleans at the Society’s annual meeting to receive their awards. Exceptions to this rule are solely in the discretion of the Executive Board of Directors of The Pirate’s Alley Faulkner Society. Examples of exceptions granted would be for illness, for a winner currently incarcerated, an unbreakable professional\n\nobligation.\n\nThe prize in each category is a published cash prize and a gold medal. Any enhancement of the prizes, such as travel and accommodations for out of town winners or manuscript critiques, is solely in the discretion of the Society and such enhancements depend solely on availability of revenues. In the event that revenues are available the Society will pay up to $500 for transportation (either airfare or mileage) and up to three nights in a hotel. Winners and other interested writers will have the opportunity to have work critiqued by an agent and an editor during the2023-24 Happy Birthday, Mr. Faulkner! weekend September 26-29. If, for any reason—including cancellation for reasons of approaching heavy weather—an awards gala is not possible, cash awards, and gold medals will be presented to winners by express delivery service.\n\nThe Society reserves the right to reject all finalists if the manuscripts are deemed to be deficient, not meeting the Society’s basic overall guideline for pre-round readers, “ready for publication with minor editing.” Preliminary judges rank a manuscript from one to ten. Any manuscript receiving a ranking of five or less will be eliminated from subsequent rounds. Only manuscripts receiving rankings of eight, nine, or ten will be considered for the ranking of finalist, with the possibility of being selected for Short List, winner, or runner-up.\n\nThe Society reserves the right to use any presentations made by authors at awards ceremonies for future promotion of the Society and for the benefit of its projects.\n\nTransportation within the continental United States and hotel accommodations for the awards event for out of town winners may be paid by the Society. Travel and hotel accommodations are not provided for winners who live in metropolitan New Orleans.\n\nThe Society does not make cash or gold medal awards to runners-up, short lists, other finalists, or semi-finalists. Free tuition registration for Happy Birthday, Mr. Faulkner, 2018— which include manuscript critiques by leading editors and agents—may be awarded to Runners-up.\n\nWe reserve one-time rights to publish the work of Winners and Runners-up in our on-line literary journal, The Double Dealer. Short List Finalists may request publication and we will consider their work. Currently, our web site for the journal, DoubleDealer.org, is down for reconstruction. We expect it to be up by mid-summer, 2018.\n\nFaulkner Society winners will be presented their awards during our Happy Birthday, Mr. Faulkner! Weekend.\n\nIMPORTANT\n\nNo refunds are issued for entry fees after our published deadline of June 30, 2024.\n\nPublication Rights\n\nAlthough the Pirate’s Alley Faulkner Society does not guarantee publication, the Society reserves the right to publish in its on-line journal, The Double Dealer, in news releases and in limited-edition booklets or broadsides, material selected as finalists in the competition. With regard to publishing, we reserve the right to publish excerpts of 1,500 to 2,500 words from winning novels, book-length narrative non-fiction, novellas, and novels-in-progress. Authors are allowed to select a stand-alone excerpt for these categories. We reserve the right to publish in their entirety short stories, essays, or poems. Authors are offered the opportunity to make changes, improvements, prior to publication in our journal. We have one-time rights for publication in the Society’s journal and a planned anthology: 30 Years of Winners (working title) The anthology would be a repeat of excerpts already published in our journal, along with short stories, essays, poems that are already published. The Society also publishes from time to time short excerpts of winning manuscripts of 250 to 500 words in features formatted specifically to use as an education resources for creative writing teachers. These features promote the author of such short excerpts and are accompanied by a photo and bio of the author. Reprints of such features are underwritten by Rosemary James and provided free to creative writing teachers. Estimated circulation of each of these lesson plans is not more than 500. The Society also has published limited-edition broadsides for gifts to sponsors and limited sales to offset the costs of printing. Estimated circulation of each such broadside is not more than 250 for our purposes with an extra 50 for each author. These are signed by the author and or visual artist and numbered. The Society’s earnings from such materials will be used for future literary prizes and for the Society’s educational projects. No honoraria are paid to authors, other than the cash prizes designated for winners of each category.\n\nSubmission of entry and required competition entry form constitutes the author’s contractual obligation for publication rights of finalist material as outlined above.\n\nEntry Fees\n\nFees offset some of the administrative costs of the competition, including deliveries to preliminary readers and judges; travel and housing expenses for out-of-town winners and judges; and gold medals awarded to winners.\n\nImportant\n\nWe no longer accept hard copies of manuscripts, so please do not send original hard copy manuscripts as they will not be returned. The Society is an all-volunteer operation and we cannot guarantee to correspond individually with each person entering the competition. If you wish to have confirmation of receipt of your manuscript, enclose a self-addressed, stamped postcard with entry form and check. The return of the postcard will be your confirmation.\n\nPlease do not attempt to send us entries by fax. We do not accept such entries. We no longer even have a fax!\n\nWinners in one competition year will not be eligible to win again in the same category. Work for different categories, however, will be accepted from previous winners. Entries rejected in one competition year will be eligible for re-entry in subsequent years with significant revisions if accompanied by a letter explaining briefly how the manuscript has been revised.\n\nAll winners will be named on our web site by September 25 of the competition year.\n\nHonor System\n\nThe competition is operated on the honor system. Should it become necessary to revoke a prize because rules are broken, all necessary costs will be borne by the offender. Should plagiarism be discovered after award of the prize, for instance, the offending winner will return cash prize and medal to the Society.\n\nJudging\n\nManuscripts are submitted blind for judging by professionals in the fields of editing, publishing, writing, and literary academics from major university English Departments.\n\nWe strongly suggest that authors have their work read by disinterested third parties for purposes of correcting spelling, grammar, and typographical mistakes, prior to finalizing entries. We also strongly suggest that authors give major attention to beginnings and endings, sense of place, character development, dialogue, transitions, and most especially narrative voice, as our experience has been that these are the areas which preliminary judges focus on when selecting work to progress to final rounds.\n\nAfter processing, entries are forwarded to preliminary judges for the first round review. The judging process is as follows:\n\nFirst Round Review. Preliminary judges review all manuscripts. If your manuscript is not eliminated in this round, it is re-read by different judges in a second round.\n\nSecond Round Review. If your manuscript is not eliminated in the second round of judging, you are designated a semi-finalist and your manuscript is read again.\n\nThird Round Review. If your manuscript is not eliminated in the third round of judging, you are designated a finalist and your manuscript is sent to to a new judge, who selects the Short List from the finalists.\n\nFourth Round. If your manuscript is selected for the Short List, it will be sent to the person designated as the final judge, who will select the winner and runner-up.\n\nPreliminary judges are anonymous. Final round judges are well known writers, editors, or agents.\n\nAnnouncements\n\nFinalists are announced as each category’s judging is completed. They will be posted by name of manuscript only on our web site, as judging is blind. At the same time, we will post semi-finalists by name of manuscript and name of author. We announce winners publicly at Faulkner for All. Winners will be alerted as soon as we know their names, however, and we will send out an e-mail to announce winners to all who entered and who provided an e-mail address. If you should change any of your contact information after entering, please notify us by e-mail with your new info. Information about winners also will be posted on this web site not later than October 31st.\n\nQuestions?\n\nWe prefer that you do not call us. Use the phone only as a last resort. We are an all-volunteer organization with no full-time paid staff. We, therefore, urge you to e-mail your questions. We do not accept material of any sort or queries by fax for the competition.\n\nE-Mail: faulkhouse@aol.com,\n\nSnail Mail: Faulkner – Wisdom Competition, 624 Pirate’s Alley, New Orleans, LA 70116-3233.\n\nPhone: (504) 491-8859\n\nRemember!\n\nDon’t forget to send your check and entry form together.
