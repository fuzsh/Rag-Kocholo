        "text": "William Cuthbert Faulkner (September 25, 1897– July 6, 1962) was an American writer and Nobel Prize laureate from Oxford, Mississippi . Faulkner wrote novels, short stories, a play, poetry, essays, and screenplays. He is primarily known for his novels and short stories set in the fictional Yoknapatawpha County, based on Lafayette County, Mississippi, where he spent most of his life.\n\nFaulkner is one of the most celebrated writers in American literature general ly and Southern literature specifically. Though his work was published as early as 1919, and largely during the 1920s and 1930s, Faulkner was relatively unknown until receiving the 1949 Nobel Prize in Literature, for which he became the only Mississippi born Nobel winner.\n\nTwo of his works, A Fable (1954) and his last novel The Reivers (1962), won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.\n\nIn 1998, the Modern Library ranked his 1929 novel The Sound and the Fury sixth on its list of the 100 best English language novels of the 20th century; also on the list were As I Lay Dying (1930) and Light in August (1932). Absalom, Absalom! (1936) is often included on similar lists."
