        "text": "William Faulkner\n\nOverview\n\nFaulkner is a prominent southern writer, who was part of the Modernist literary movement. He was a prolific author of novels, short stories, poems and plays for over 40 years, and much of his work was set in the South. His fiction covers issues of southern history, class, gender, race and slavery, and man’s relation with nature. Today he is considered one of the great American authors, having won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1950, two Pulitzer prizes, in addition to many other awards (Reuben, 2011).\n\nBiography\n\nBorn on September 25, 1897, in New Albany, and his family moved to Oxford, Mississippi when he around five years old. His father would work as a conductor on the railroad built by Faulkner's great grandfather, Colonel William Falkner the author of The White Rose of Memphis (Stein, 1956). This is where he spent most of his childhood. After dropping out of high school, and after being rejected by the U.S. Airforce (he was about 5 foot 5 inches tall,) he tried joined the Canadian Royal Flying Corps when he was 21. It is not clear whether he was ever inducted there, but he returned to Oxford less than 6 months later, where he attended the University of Mississippi for two years. After two years as the university postmaster, he left under suspicious circumstances. Faulkner then moved to New Orleans and started writing, where he was first published in experimental magazines. He wrote his first novel Soldier’s Pay after being encouraged by Sherwood Anderson (Stein, 1956). After Soldier's Pay was published, he toured Europe in 1925 for 6 months, but returned to Oxford. His first major work, Sartoris was published in 1929 (Perkins p. 1173). In 1929 Faulkner's childhood sweetheart Estelle divorced her first husband and they married in June, 1930. A year later, their first daughter died shortly after birth, but a second daughter Jill is born in 1933 (Reuben, 2011).\n\nWilliam Faulkner was a very private person, and until the mid 1930’s he was able to live quietly in his Rowan Oak estate in Lafayette County (Padgett). After he came back from Hollywood where he worked as a script writer, the local newspaper started writing about his literary accomplishments. This is when he started losing his valued privacy. “In September and October 1953, Life magazine published a two-part essay on Faulkner, against his wishes. The articles — “The Private World of William Faulkner” in September, and “The Man Behind the Faulkner Myth” in October — were written by Robert Coughlan, who had met Faulkner two years earlier trying to gather information for a Life magazine article that never materialized” (Padgett). Even though the articles were meant to applaud Faulkner’s work, they revealed many details of Faulkner’s private life. The revelation of so many details about his private life really distressed him. Soon after, Faulkner wound up in a sanitarium. It was one of many visits there due to his struggle with alcoholism. So many of the characters and settings for his writings were based upon his own life, so many thought it ironic that he would react in such a way. Faulkner died of a heart attack at the age of 65 on July 6, 1962, in Oxford, Mississippi (Reuben).\n\nCareer\n\nAfter Faulkner’s first major work, Sartoris, was published in 1929, Faulkner had a very prolific career. Faulkner's first widely read novel was Sanctuary which he would admit was made for money after his more popular works failed to earn enough money to sustain a living for his family (Stein, 1956). He gained fame for his novels about the fictional \"Yoknapatawpha County\" and its county seat of Jefferson. Faulkner patterned the county after the area around his hometown of Oxford, Miss. In these books, he explored southern history, economy, social values and morality (Polk, 2007).\n\nIn 1932, he traveled to California to work for MGM, 20th Century Fox and Universal Studios as a contract writer. He worked on many screenplays, including \"To Have and Have Not\" written by Hemingway in 1944 for Warner Brothers, and \"Barn Burning,\" one of his own highly-recognized short stories (Reuben).\n\nBetween 1927 and 1936, Faulkner published more than one major work a year (see Major Works below).\n\nIn 1948, Faulkner was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In November of 1950, the announcement that Faulkner had received the Nobel Prize was made. He also received the National Book Award for A Fable in March and the Pulitzer in May of 1955 (Reuben). Faulkner worked till the very end of his life. The Reivers was published a month before he died in 1962 and this final work won the Pulitzer a year later.\n\nLiterary Influences\n\nFaulkner was greatly influenced by the history of his family and the region in which he lived. When he was 17, Faulkner met Philip Stone, his first literary mentor. Stone had attended Ole Miss and Harvard, and was attending law school at Yale, when he took Faulkner under his wing. (Padgett) Faulkner’s early poems had impressed him and Stone help him submit his work to publishers. Stone also introduced Faulkner to James Joyce (one of the modernists who used stream-of consciousness style,) It was at the suggestion of Sherwood Anderson that Faulkner started to use his upbringing ( specifically the South) as a source of topics and to create his own style of writing (William Faulkner: 1897-1962).\n\nFaulkner’s prose was also influenced by French Symbolism. In Absalom! Absalom! Faulkner “attempts to use language in the same way as Stéphane Mallarmé had used it within his L'Après midi d'un faune (1876). \"Both works are an attempt to question the nature of reality and the individual subject's state of consciousness” (Judd, p. 21).\n\nOther literary influences on Faulkner's writing style included Charles Baudelaire, Algernon Charles Swinburne, A.E. Housman, and Francois Villon (Thomas, 2010).\n\nMany critics argue that Faulkner was influenced by Sigmund Freud’s theories, but Faulkner denied this.\n\nLiterary Movement\n\nA Modernist writer in the company of F. Scott Fitzgerald, Sherwood Anderson, and T. S. Eliot, Faulkner explored the themes of isolation and cultural displacement. Most scholars agree that the period started around 1900, and ended in 1945. “Modernist literature is characterized chiefly by a rejection of 19th-century traditions and of their consensus between author and reader” (Baldick, 2001).\n\nModernism is considered difficult to define clearly because the term encompasses a variety of specific artistic and philosophical movements including symbolism, futurism, surrealism, expressionism, imagism, and others . To break from the writing styles of the Victorian era, the Modernists experimented with new avant-garde styles and forms of poetry and prose. In addition to Faulkner and Eliot, other experimental writers included Ezra Pound, Virginia Woolf, and James Joyce.\n\nStyle and Form\n\nFaulkner used groundbreaking experimental literary techniques, which sometimes “simultaneously perplexed and challenged his audience” (William Faulkner: A Pathfinder, 2001). He created his own unique literary style which utilized:\n\nstream-of-consciousness thought, and character’s shift back and forth from conscious to unconscious thought\n\nmultiple narrators\n\nnon-sequential time shifts\n\nIn 1957, Faulkner said, \"it is men and women that matter, the characters. I don't write the stories. When the characters come alive, they write the stories themselves by behaving as they should\" (Inge, p. 151).\n\nFaulkner is also known for mingling humorous scenes into stories that deal with the dark side of humanity. “He is probably the only Nobel Prize-winning author who would imagine, let alone conjure, a poetic love scene in which a drooling idiot tries to woo and console an embarassed cow that just soiled him. As absurd as this scene is on its surface, Faulkner actually wants us to believe that not only is this love real and heartfelt, but also a romance for the ages” (William Faulkner: The Perfect Coen Brothers Hero).\n\nDominant Thematic Concerns\n\nSouthern community and social structure’s influence on person’s life, especially in the post-reconstruction South\n\nIn-depth objective observations of racism and racial identity, and sexism without moral “judgement or comment”\n\nImpact of slavery, economics, and politics on white and black poor\n\n“As Faulkner put it in his 1950 Nobel Prize acceptance speech, he is concerned mainly with the human heart in conflict with itself. The writer’s duty is to write about man’s soul and his capacity for endurance and compassion and sacrifice.” He stressed his faith in the human heart’s ability to triumph over the failings of the modern human condition: greed, injustice, fear, cowardice, and duplicity.”\n\n--(Baldwin, 2011)\n\n“I discovered that my own little postage stamp of native soil was worth writing about and that I would never live long enough to exhaust it.... It opened up a gold mine of other peoples, so I created a cosmos of my own. I can move these people around like God, not only in space but in time too. The fact that I have moved my characters around in time successfully, at least in my own estimation, proves to me my own theory that time is a fluid condition, which has no existence except in the momentary avatars of individual people. There is no such thing as was—only is. If was existed there would be no grief or sorrow.”\n\n--(Faulkner Interview with Jean Stein)\n\nSelected Works:\n\nThe Marble Faun (1924)\n\nSoldier's Pay (1926)\n\nMosquitores (1927)\n\nSartoris (1929)\n\nThe Sound And The Fury (1929)\n\nAs I Lay Dying (1930)\n\nThese 13 (1931)\n\nSanctuary (1931)\n\nLight In August (1932)\n\nA Green Bough, (1933)\n\nDr. Martino and other Stories (1934)\n\nPylon (1935)\n\nAbsalom, Absalom!

In fact, it isn't even past.”\n\n-William Faulkner\n\n“What makes a fool is an inability to take even his own good advice”\n\n-William Faulkner, Light in August\n\n“Love in the young requires as little of hope as of desire to feed upon”\n\n-William Faulkner, Light in August\n\n“That which is destroying the Church is not the outward groping of those within it nor the inward groping of those without, but the professionals who control it and who have removed the bells from its steeples”\n\n-William Faulkner, Light in August\n\n“People ... have tried to evoke God or devil to justify them in what their glands insisted upon”\n\n-William Faulkner, Absalom, Absalom!\n\n“Husband and wife did not need to speak words to one another, not just from the old habit of living together but because in that one long-ago instant at least out of the long and shabby stretch of their human lives, even though they knew at the time it wouldn't and couldn't last, they had touched and become as God when they voluntarily and in advance forgave one another for all that each knew the other could never be”\n\n-William Faulkner, Go Down, Moses\n\n“Purity is a negative state and therefore contrary to nature”\n\n-William Faulkner, The Sound and the Fury\n\n“It used to be I thought of death as a man something like Grandfather a friend of his a kind of private and particular friend like we used to think of Grandfather's desk not to touch it not even to talk loud in the room where it was”\n\n-William Faulkner, The Sound and the Fury\n\n“No battle is ever won ... victory is an illusion of philosophers and fools”\n\n-William Faulkner, The Sound and the Fury\n\nA man is the sum of his misfortunes.\n\n-William Faulkner, The Sound and the Fury\n\nReception--Legacy\n\nUntil the 1950’s, he received a mixed reception from readers and literary critics. They sometimes objected to controversial subject matter (violence, sexuality, and racism); complex and rhetorical sentence structure, and experimental literary techniques (stream of consciousness).\n\n“In creative genius, in the ability to construct a world of the imagination in which reality is more accessible than it is in the everyday actualitites of life, William Faulkner has few peers in modern literature” (Perkins, p. 1172).\n\n“In 1950 Faulkner received the Nobel Prize and at home, the National Book Award for his Collected Stories. The consequent reconsideration of Faulkner’s work as a whole after such honors, unsought and long overdue, brought about before his death, his general recognition as one of the greatest imaginative writers of the Western world during his half century” (Perkins p. 1174-1175).\n\nFaulkner's home Rowan Oak in Oxford, MS is now a museum that is open year-round. Rowan Oak was Faulkner's sanctuary for creating his stories which proved to be productive years for all of the works he would release during his time there (RowanOak.com).\n\nFurther Reading\n\nFor additional biographical information, literary commentary and analysis, geographical and historical context, and web sources:\n\n\"William Faulkner: A Pathfinder.\" Faulkner Pathfinder. 10 Dec. 2001.
