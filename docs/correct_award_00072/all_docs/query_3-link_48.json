        "meta_description": "It was the Nobel Prize for Literature (not peace) in 1949, for The Sound and the Fury. He was nominated the year before, immediately following the books first wide-scale publication, but controversy surrounding the novel lead the committee to grant the award instead to T.S. Eliot, before deciding the next year to commend Faulkner. The theme of Faulkner's acceptance speech may have led some people to think (or to recall incorrectly) that the prize was awarded for peace rather than for literature. Here is the famous peroration: It is easy enough to say that man is immortal because he will endure: that when the last ding-dong of doom has clanged and faded from the last worthless rock hanging tideless in the last red and dying evening, that even then there will still be one more sound: that of his puny inexhaustible voice, still talking. I refuse to accept this. I believe that man will not merely endure: he will prevail. He is immortal, not because he alone among creatures has an inexhaustible voice, but because he has a soul, a spirit capable of compassion and sacrifice and endurance. The poet's, the writer's, duty is to write about these things. It is his privilege to help man endure by lifting his heart, by reminding him of the courage and honor and hope and pride and compassion and pity and sacrifice which have been the glory of his past. The poet's voice need not merely be the record of man, it can be one of the props, the pillars to help him endure and prevail.",
