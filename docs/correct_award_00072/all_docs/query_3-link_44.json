        "text": "It was overlooked for the Booker prize and the US National Book Awards, but Joseph O'Neill's Netherland has finally picked up a prestigious literary gong in the form of the PEN/Faulkner award for fiction.\n\nO'Neill's tale of cricket in post-9/11 New York, which has been compared to The Great Gatsby, was picked by judges from more than 300 novels and story collections to take the prize, which was established with money donated by William Faulkner from his Nobel prize winnings and has been won in the past by Philip Roth and John Updike.\n\n\"No better mind has gone to work on where we are post-9/11,\" author and judge Lee Abbott told the Washington Post, saying that although he'd never watched a game of cricket, he'd \"love to see one in O'Neill's company - and he makes me feel that I did\".\n\nNetherland, which made the longlist for the Booker prize and was the bookies' favourite to win before it was snubbed for the shortlist, is narrated by a Dutch banker who tells the story of his life in New York, his friendship with the Gatsby-esque Chuck Ramkissoon who has grand ambitions for New York's cricketing scene, and how their lives are affected by the 2001 terrorist attacks. It was described by the New York Times as \"the wittiest, angriest, most exacting and most desolate work of fiction we've yet had about life in New York and London after the World Trade Centre fell\", while James Wood in the New Yorker called it \"one of the most remarkable post-colonial books I have ever read\".\n\nIt was picked by judges over fellow finalists Sarah Shun-Lien Bynum for her tale of a seventh grade teacher, Ms Hempel Chronicles; Susan Choi for her novel A Person of Interest, about a mail bomb which explodes at a university; Lush Life, Richard Price's story of two very different worlds in New York's Lower East Side; and Ron Rash's historical novel, Serena, about life in the North Carolina mountains in 1929. O'Neill will receive $15,000 (£10,500), with the shortlisted authors each taking home $5,000.\n\nO'Neill was born in Ireland and emigrated to Manhattan from London in 1998, where he lives – like Hans, the narrator of Netherland - at venerable bohemian roost the Chelsea Hotel. He had written two novels and a non-fiction book before Netherland hit the bestseller lists last year, and previously worked as a barrister until he decided to write full time."
