        "text": "Sentences like “And how the lions in your eyes are all dying” (5) or “But the Egyptians used honey / To preserve their vital organs” (8-9) are perfect uses of metaphors in the sense that they characterize the situation and give the reader a vivid understanding. The ‘lions dying in the eyes of the beholder’ is a way of saying that all the courage, confidence and fire they had burning inside of them before, is now vanishing. It leaves one feeling empty and self-conscious knowing that whoever betrayed them, whether it be lover, a friend or a family member, had the audacity to do it in the first place. Another striking phrase in the poem was when Weslowski referred to the Egyptians using honey to save their most important organs. In a literal sense, the heart is one of, if not, the most vital organs we, as humans, have; it’s what keeps us alive. Speaking in a non-literal sense, the heart is something everyone wants to protect because no one enjoys getting their heart broken. Unfortunately if the occasion arises, one may go to certain lengths to shield what self-dignity they have left, or what pieces of their heart is still there. Half way through, Weslowski speaks about mohawks on skateboards (12), tattoos underwater (13), becoming the bad weather (14-16) or the music (17-19), or even becoming an empty coffee cup (21), he is pinpointing how certain people cope and the varying coping\n\nThis piece is a simpler one based off of the concept that words are unfulfilling to the concepts they represent. In As I Lay Dying, Addie states that words are “just words.” Addie developed a disdain for words as she slowly got more cruel the longer she remained trapped in this family. In a certain passage from As I Lay Dying, Tull and some locals are talking with Cash about Cash’s broken leg. Faulkner gives us two different conversation one is boring and mundane and is the one that was actually spoken, while the other is rich in content and opinion, a much more interesting conversation to have, but is only the thoughts of the men. The words spoken were not the true thoughts of the men and the men hold back their thoughts because they are very\n\nEffectively, his deliberate use of syntax creates a structure in his essay which immerses the reader into the passage and allows his message to be conveyed. Often in the essay, he adopts compound-complex sentence structures to maximize his level of description and to fully establish the imagery he intends to create. Moreover, when he establishes depictions of action, motion, and speed, he creates considerably longer compound-complex sentences; using five or more clauses and at least one dash to thoroughly depict action, to eliminate any sense of pause, and to fully intrigue his readers. Such a usage of syntax is also parallel to when he writes that “...it was filled with motion, speed.” His lack of “and” but rather the word “speed” preceding a comma further represents the elimination of a sense of pause and his use of syntax in order to create a sense of speed and intensity. In the last paragraph, he continues his extensive use of compound-complex sentences and he suddenly slows down and ends his final part on shorter complex sentences.\n\nIn “Shitty First Drafts,” Anne Lamott illustrates the challenges and difficulties writers face while preparing to write their first drafts, by explaining many different examples and how to eliminate those issues and exceed into creating the “Shitty First Draft.” Anne Lamott’s use of figures of speech, narration, and audience appeals, teach the readers how to write their first draft. Lamott’s descriptive writing and use of details allows the readers to experience her struggles and compare that to themselves. “Even after I’d been doing this for years, panic would set in. I’d try to write a lead, but instead I’d write a couple of dreadful sentences, XX them out, try again, XX everything out, and then feel despair and worry settle on my chest like\n\nThe Nobel Prize for Literature was not rewarded to the deserving writer. You have awarded Bob Dylan the Nobel Prize for Literature on October 13, 2016 degrading dedicated writers around the world. After dropping out of college in the 1960’s to pursue an occupation in which he was already well known as the times “most loved folk poet”, he turned to singing and writing rock-type songs with anti war messages. Whether he did “create new poetic expressions within the great American tradition” he has not proven himself worthy of such a significant award. Such a legendary award offered to many other brilliant writers, should be received by someone who can and will continue to change the world. This award could help out developing writers, developing countries, and should not be handed out single handedly.\n\nAn anaphora is the deliberate repetition of a word or phrase at the beginning of several successive verses sentences or paragraphs used to emphasize a point of make it catchy. The anaphora is used in the speech to get the audience to remember what he was about to say. The repetition of phrases such as “I Have a Dream,” “Let freedom ring,” and “One hundred years later,” started off some of the most important sentences in the speech. In this speech it was the biggest key for Dr. King when he was speaking because it added a tone that would rally together the crowd in person, and the crowd listening at their homes. One anaphora that was used during this speech was the phrase “one hundred years later.” King used this when referring to how life has changed for African Americans, since the Gettysburg Address a century before. The statement that followed this phrase was about the struggles African Americans still face to that day. The second anaphora King used was “Now is the time,” the words that followed discussed how African Americans felt they have been treated. The remarks King made contrasted from the dark times of segregation to the good times of justice and equality for everyone. Perhaps one of the most famous phrases “I Have a Dream” is also an anaphora. Dr. King used I Have A Dream when he stated what he wanted to see for blacks and whites in the future. The final anaphora King used in his speech was “Let freedom ring.” King used this at the end of his speech when he called for equality for everyone across the nation. The anaphora was a very effective method in his I Have a Dream speech considering the anaphora I Have a Dream is recognizable\n\nFaulkner’s works consisted of many dark touchy topics such as war, racism, mental illness and suicide in all of books, short stories, William Faulkner wrote about almost every part of life, from something that could be absurd at his time, to something real like racism in the American South. Throughout his life, Faulkner was kind of a rebel, notorious for his confidence, drinking, and he would often make up stories about himself. Faulkner wrote from experience and as a person who lived in the south during times of racism, he wrote about a lot of things in the south. To be exact his specific genre or style in which he wrote in is what some call “southern gothic”. Southern gothic is a unique style of writing and only expressed by very few authors. These stories usually take place only in the south and have darkness to them. His stories would use irony to examine the values of the American south. Instead of solely trying to add suspense with the style it is also used to explore social issues and cultural character of the south. Which leads me to one of Faulkner’s first important novels “Sartoris”. In Sartoris Faulkner focuses on a family during the world war era in the south. In the book the Sartoris family is one of the more important families in Yoknapatawpha County where the book is set. The Old Colonel, John Sartoris, represents an old and dying out order dating back to the mid 1900’s. His world revolves around his plantation home, his slaves and his\n\nBleikasten concludes that Faulkner, like many of his contemporaneous authors, recognized the inability of language to express beauty, truth, and perhaps womanhood, and so could only explain by not explaining, narrate by not narrating, and write by not writing. I think one could additionally argue that this is why Faulkner does not “write” Caddy, or give her a voice, because language would (apparently) spoil her beauty (which I cannot help reading as an excuse). When Bleikasten insists that Faulkner’s “insistence on his failure was no pose,” I get frustrated with him, because I simply want to ask, “How do you know?”. I already have trouble taking Faulkner’s introductions seriously when he describes the development of The Sound and the Fury for they seem to include much idealization and dreamy hindsight."
