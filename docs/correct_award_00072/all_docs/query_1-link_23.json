Students are frequently mystified by this version of Faulkner and react with shame, anger, and dismissal. What if, instead, we read Faulkner in the varied print cultures of his cultural moment, particularly his engagements with popular forms? How, through this engagement with print culture, might our students draw connections between his cultural moment and their own?\n\nThis in-person workshop considers the pedagogical benefits of embracing “pulp” Faulkner in his varied modes of print—in popular magazines, pulp paperback reprints, sensationalist “modern” presses—and in conversation with various genres, including mysteries, “women’s fiction,” gangster novels, and sex paperbacks. We will use Faulkner and Print Culture as a grounding text and meet in the Faulkner Room of the Special Collections division of the J. D. Williams Library to look at Signet reprints and issues of the many magazines that published Faulkner’s short fiction, paying attention to surrounding advertisements, companion articles, and other contextual information. We will consider how this material might inform our own teaching of Faulkner and brainstorm lesson plans and assignments.\n\nParticipants will be emailed materials before the conference. In the workshop, we will engage in facilitated conversation and end with a general discussion about teaching strategies.\n\nTo register, go to the Google form at tinyurl.com/pulpfaulkner. Inquiries should be directed to Jaime Harker at jlharker@olemiss.edu.

Magic Lanterns is an immersive exhibit containing prints of astronomical and astrological imagery sourced from 1860s magic lantern slides from the Millington-Barnard Collection of Scientific Instruments. Magic lanterns, a predecessor of modern slide projectors, were used to swindle, entertain, and enchant their audiences for hundreds of years before the advent of moving pictures. Continued Artistry features Choctaw basket weaving, an important traditional artistry that has been practiced for centuries. Choctaw baskets were first created primarily for utilitarian use and came in myriad shapes and sizes to serve different functions. While production and common use has dwindled in the past century, Native weavers continue the tradition, passing their skill to the next generation. Most contemporary Choctaw basket weavers are still based in Mississippi.\n\nMuseum hours are 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Tuesday through Saturday.
