        "text": "I feel that this award was not made to me as a man, but to my work--a lifeÂ’s work in the agony and sweat of the human spirit, not for glory and least of all for profit, but to create out of the materials of the huhmn spirit something which did not exist before. So this award is only mine in trust. It will not be diffictul to find a dedication for the money part of it commensurate with the purpose and significance of its origin. But I would like to do the same with the acclaim too, by using this moment as a pinnacle from which I might be listened to by the young men and women already dedicated to the same anguish and travail, among whom is already that one who will some day stand here where I am standing.\n\nOur tragedy today is a general and universal physical fear so long sustained by now that we can even bear it. There ar no longer problems of the spirit. There is only the question: When will I be blown up? Because of this, the young man and woman writing today has forgotten the problems of the human heart in conflict with itself which alone can make good writing because only that is worth writing about, worth the agony and the sweat.\n\nHe must learn them again. He must teach himself that the basest of all things is to be afraid; and, teaching himself that, forget it forever, leaving no room in his workshop for anything but the old verities and truths of the heart, the old universal truths lacking which any story is ephemeral and doomed--love and honor and pity and pride and compassion and sacrifice. Until he does so, he labors under a curse. He writes not of love but of lust, of defeats in which nobody loses anything of value, of victories without hope and, worst of all, without pity or compassion. His griefs greive on no universal bones, leaving no scars. He writes not of the heart but of the glands."
