Pictured, I am receiving my award (and check) from Lynn Madden of the Union County Heritage Museum in New Albany, Mississippi, birthplace of William Faulkner. It was quite something to receive this top award from several dozen entries worldwide. I shared the stage with many accomplished and budding authors who won other awards for short stories, poetry, and one-act plays."
