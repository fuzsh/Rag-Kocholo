        "text": "Oxford, Mississippi is an amazing place to live.\n\nOxford is a cultural mecca of the South, a go-to spot for literature, fine arts, music, and cuisine. It offers a perfect mix of small-town and college-town life in a cosmopolitan setting. We are proud to be the hometown of William Faulker, the great American Southern writer, an Oxford native who grew up in Oxford and lived here much of his life.\n\nOxford’s rich history, small town charm and creative community make it an ideal place for students. Our nationally known bookstore, Square Books, draws literary talent from across the world to its readings and has become a center of culture and idea exchange. Oxford is also the home of innovative cuisine. Located within an hour of Memphis and within a half-day’s driving distance of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast, Oxford is a beautiful and friendly place that is consistently on lists of the best places to live in the United States.\n\nLocated 70 miles from Memphis and surrounded by the natural beauty of Northern Mississippi, Oxford boasts thriving music, art, and literary scenes along with great restaurants. University of Mississippi athletics provides many opportunities to watch and participate in sports—and one of the world’s best tailgating parties—at one of Architectural Digest’s Most Beautiful Colleges in America.\n\nWith everything Oxford offers, it’s no wonder USA Today names Oxford as one of the Top Six College Towns in the Nation.\n\nCome see why.\n\nFord Center for the Performing Arts\n\nOffering an assortment of Broadway shows, concerts, ballet, and more, the Ford Center is the area’s premier entertainment venue. The 1,174-seat center enriches the university and Oxford community by providing a variety of theatre and music productions, lectures, dance, and film."
