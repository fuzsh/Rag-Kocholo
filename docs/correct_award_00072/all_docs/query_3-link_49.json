        "text": "This story originally ran in the El Paso Times on March 19, 2013.\n\nEl Paso author Benjamin Alire Sáenz won the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction -- one of the most prestigious honors in literature -- for his collection of stories in \"Everything Begins and Ends at the Kentucky Club.\"\n\n\"This award allows me to keep my job for a while,\" Sáenz said jokingly Tuesday.\n\nHe paused, took a breath and said he considered his writing a gift for which he thanked his mother, his friends and \"everyone who has ever loved me, inspired me and believed in me.\"\n\nAnd he thanked the community in which he grew up.\n\n\"The borderland -- the frontera -- gave me words, gave me language, a point of view,\" he said, a slight quiver in his voice.\n\nThe award was announced Tuesday by the PEN/Faulkner Foundation, which gives the annual award named for renowned Nobel Prize author William Faulkner. The award carries a $15,000 prize and is considered the largest peer juried prize for fiction.\n\nSáenz is the first Hispanic writer to win the award since its inception in 1981.\n\nA poet and novelist, Sáenz was one of five finalists for this year's award. The other four are Amelia Gray for \"Threats,\" Laird Hunt for \"Kind One,\" T. Geronimo Johnson for \"Hold It 'Til It Hurts\" and Thomas Mallon for \"Watergate.\"\n\nSáenz and the finalists will be honored May 4 during the 33rd annual PEN/Faulkner Award Ceremony at the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C., where he will read from his winning book.\n\nThe award will prompt Sáenz to do something outside his comfort zone -- read his own published work.\n\n\"I never reread any of my books. Only when I give readings do I go back to what's been published,\" he said, and he added that this time he will have to thumb through the book to find the perfect selection.\n\nOverall, the judges considered more than 350 novels and short-story collections by American authors published in the U.S. in 2012, according to a news release from the foundation.\n\n\"Everything Begins and Ends at the Kentucky Club,\" published by El Paso's Cinco Puntos Press, is a collection of seven stories anchored at the well-known bar in Juárez just four blocks from the international bridge. The bar is the backdrop where the characters \"struggle with the impossible ambiguities of borders, whether they be sexual, emotional, national or economic,\" the release states.\n\n\"The author takes stunning care with language -- English, Spanish, and the languages of sunlight, daylight, dimlight, nightlight -- twisting and tumbling with the whispered language of the human heart,\" judge A.J. Verdelle wrote.\n\n\"Sáenz also devotes impressive attention to rendering communities on the borders of the United States and Mexico, on the boundaries of sensual and sexual expression, on the edge of despair, and on the cusp of redemption.\"\n\nAnother judge, Nelly Rosario, said the collective voices of the narrators in Sáenz' stories \"speak artlessly, as wisdom does, and ask us to listen for the borderless poetry of the spirit.\"\n\nSáenz is no stranger to awards. He has won a Wallace Stegner Fellowship in poetry, a Lannan Poetry Fellowship, and an American Book Award. His other literary work has previously won the Stonewall Book Award presented by the American Library Association's Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Round Table.\n\nHe has been a finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize and PEN Center's award for young adult fiction and has won numerous others.\n\n\"This is the biggest one of all,\" he said about the PEN/Faulkner Award.\n\nSáenz, 58, the fourth of seven children, was born in Old Picacho, N.M., near Las Cruces. He graduated from Las Cruces High School.\n\nHe entered the seminary in 1972 and was ordained a Catholic priest after completing his theological studies at the University of Louvain in Belgium. He left the priesthood three years later. Sáenz later earned a master's in creative writing from the University of Texas at El Paso. He began teaching in UTEP's creative writing program in 1993. He is now the chairman of the university's creative writing department.\n\nSáenz said he plans to continue writing about the damaged characters he brings to life and the borderland that often brings tears to his eyes.\n\n\"There's many more stories left in me,\" he said. \"The place where I live and will never leave has given me enough subject matter to last a lifetime.\"\n\nSáenz said every word, every poem and every story he writes has a little bit of himself in it.\n\n\"My characters are always damaged,\" he said. \"They're trying to be good people and they have a lot of flaws. Sometimes they make it; sometimes they don't.\"\n\nAsked whether he thinks he's made it, Sáenz grows quiet.\n\n\"I think many artists, many writers, say their art saved their life,\" Sáenz said in a near whisper. \"It's true for me.\"\n\nCindy Ramirez may be reached at cramirez@elpasotimes.com; 546-6151."
