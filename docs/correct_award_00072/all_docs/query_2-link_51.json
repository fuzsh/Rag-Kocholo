        "text": "William Faulkner, American author (1897-1962), received two Pulitzer prizes for literature, the Nobel Prize for Literature, and two National Book Awards. He was born in New Albany, Mississippi in 1897, and lived most of his life in Oxford, Mississippi. His first book, which he printed by hand, illustrated and bound while a student at the University of Mississippi in 1920, was “Marionettes.” Much of his early work was poetry, such as the romantic sonnet sequence, Helen: A Courtship. His novels set in the American South, frequently in his fictional Yoknapatawpha County, include The Sound and the Fury, As I Lay Dying and Absalom, Absalom! He died on July 6, 1962."
