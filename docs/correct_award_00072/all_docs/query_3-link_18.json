        "text": "The PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction\n\nThe most prestigious annual peer-juried literary prize in America\n\nThe PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction honors the best published works of fiction by American permanent residents in a calendar year. Three writers are chosen annually by the Board of Directors of the PEN/Faulkner Foundation to serve as judges, ensuring that our awards selection process is free of commercial influence. These judges select an initial longlist of ten books, followed by five finalists, and finally one winner as the “first among equals.” The author of the winning book receives a $15,000 prize. The authors of each of the other finalists receive $5,000. The Award is presented at an annual celebration of the year’s distinguished books and authors. This exquisite literary evening features introductions by the PEN/Faulkner Award judges, original presentations by the year’s PEN/Faulkner Award winner and four finalists, and a star-studded list of notable guests, including our PEN/Faulkner Literary Champion.\n\n2024 PEN/FAULKNER AWARD CELEBRATION\n\nAn Event to Remember for Contemporary Fiction Lovers\n\nOur 44th Annual PEN/Faulkner Award Celebration recently honored this year’s distinguished books and authors. This exquisite literary evening, held on May 2, 2024 at the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial Library, featured presentations by our judges; original readings by our winner Claire Jiménez, finalists Jamel Brinkley, Henry Hoke, Alice McDermott, and Colin Winnette; and a celebration of David Baldacci, our 2024 PEN/Faulkner Literary Champion.\n\nOur 2025 Judges\n\nBruce Holsinger\n\nDeesha Philyaw\n\nLuis Alberto Urrea\n\nSubmission Guidelines\n\nPublishers, literary agents, and authors may submit works of fiction (short story collections, novellas, or novels) published between January 1, 2024 and December 31, 2024. Our submission period opens July 1, 2024 and closes September 30, 2024. We encourage you to submit titles as early as possible. The judges’ reading process begins upon receipt.\n\nEligibility\n\nEach submission requires a $95 entry fee and must be submitted via our online submission platform. We no longer accept email submissions.\n\nAny books determined to be ineligible will still be subject to the $95 fee.\n\nIf the fee presents a significant financial hardship to an author submitting their own book, they may request a fee waiver by emailing Sarah Silberman (sarah@penfaulkner.org). Authors requesting a fee waiver are limited to one submission per submission period. We are unable to grant fee waivers before submissions open on July 1, 2024.\n\nPublishers and literary agents are not eligible for a fee waiver.\n\nAuthors must be living U.S. citizens or permanent residents. U.S. citizens living abroad are eligible.\n\nBooks must be published by commercial, university, or independent presses in the U.S. Books that are self-published, or published by presses that charge for production or editorial services, are not eligible.\n\nTranslation: a translation from another language into English by the author is eligible; a translation by someone other than the author is not.\n\nBooks published by current PEN/Faulkner board members are not eligible.\n\nReprints are not eligible.\n\nSubmission Process\n\nWe accept virtual submissions via our online submission platform only. Please submit an easy-to-read PDF (no watermarks over the body of the text) of the title.\n\nIf you have questions about eligibility, and want to ensure you’re not charged for an ineligible entry, please contact Sarah Silberman (sarah@penfaulkner.org).\n\n2024 Winner of the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction\n\n“I began writing this story a decade ago, a strange tale about the disappearance of a Puerto Rican girl from Staten Island and the women in her family who cannot stop looking for her. This novel is not only about a missing girl but also missing stories. I am so grateful to the PEN/Faulkner Foundation and the judges for honoring the voices of the Ramirez women, and I cannot wait to celebrate the extraordinary books of my fellow finalists at the award ceremony in May.”\n\n– Claire Jiménez, author of What Happened to Ruthy Ramirez\n\nPast Winners & Finalists\n\n2018\n\nWINNER:\n\nJoan Silber, Improvement\n\nFINALISTS:\n\nHernán Diaz, In The Distance\n\nSamantha Hunt, The Dark Dark\n\nAchy Obejas, The Tower of the Antilles\n\nJesmyn Ward, Sing, Unburied, Sing\n\n2017\n\nWINNER:\n\nImbolo Mbue, Behold the Dreamers\n\nFINALISTS:\n\nViet Dinh, After Disasters\n\nLouise Erdrich, LaRose\n\nGarth Greenwell, What Belongs to You\n\nSunil Yapa, Your Heart Is a Muscle the Size of a Fist\n\n2016\n\nWINNER:\n\nJames Hannaham, Delicious Foods\n\nFINALISTS:\n\nJulie Iromuanya, Mr. and Mrs. Doctor\n\nViet Thanh Nguyen, The Sympathizer\n\nElizabeth Tallent, Mendocino Fire\n\nLuis Alberto Urrea, The Water Museum\n\n2015\n\nWINNER:\n\nAtticus Lish, Preparation for the Next Life\n\nFINALISTS:\n\nJeffery Renard Allen, Song of the Shank\n\nJennifer Clement, Prayers for the Stolen\n\nEmily St. John Mandel, Station Eleven\n\nJenny Offill, Dept. of Speculation\n\n2014\n\nWINNER:\n\nKaren Joy Fowler, We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves\n\nFINALISTS:\n\nDaniel Alarcón, At Night We Walk in Circles\n\nPercival Everett, Percival Everett by Virgil Russell\n\nJoan Silber, Fools\n\nValerie Trueblood, Search Party: Stories of Rescue\n\n2013\n\nWINNER:\n\nBenjamin Alire Sáenz, Everything Begins & Ends at the Kentucky Club\n\nFINALISTS:\n\nAmelia Gray, Threats\n\nLaird Hunt, Kind One\n\nT.
