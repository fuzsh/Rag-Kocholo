        "text": "Frederick Douglass' Words Caught the Attention of Many - Including Slave Owners\n\n867 Words | 2 Pages\n\nLiterature is written in many ways and styles. During his time, Frederick Douglass’s works and speeches attracted many people’s attention. With the amount of works and speeches Douglass has given, it has influenced many others writers to express themselves more freely. Though Douglass lived a rigorous childhood, he still made it the best that he could, with the guidance and teaching of one of his slave owner’s wife he was able to read and write, thus allowing him to share his life stories and experiences. Douglass’s work today still remain of great impact and influence, allowing us to understand the reality of slavery, and thus inspiring many others to come out and share for others to understand.\n\nThe Glass Castle, by Jeannette Walls\n\n768 Words | 2 Pages\n\nOn December 10, 1950, in Stockholm, Sweden, one of the greatest literary minds of the twentieth century, William Faulkner, presented his acceptance speech for the Nobel Prize. If one reads in between the lines of this acceptance speech, they can detect a certain message – more of a cry or plead – aimed directly to adolescent authors and writers, and that message is to be the voice of your own generation; write about things with true importance. This also means that authors should include heart, soul, spirit, and raw, truthful emotion into their writing. “Love and honor and pity and pride and compassion and sacrifice” (Faulkner) should all be frequently embraced – it is the duty of authors to do so. If these young and adolescent authors ignore this message and duty, the already endangered state of literature will continue to diminish until its unfortunate extinction.\n\nElie Wiesel Speech Analysis\n\n1046 Words | 3 Pages\n\nElie Wiesel, a holocaust survivor, delivered The Nobel Peace Prize Acceptance Speech, in Oslo on December 10, 1986. He started his speech off by reciting the following prayer: \"Barukh atah Adonai …shehekhyanu vekiymanu vehigianu lazman hazeh\"—\"Blessed be Thou…for giving us life, for sustaining us, and for enabling us to reach this day.\" Then, after his speech, the people thanked him for everything he had done to help humankind make peace. With a profound sense of humility, he accepted this honor.\n\nWilliam Faulkner's Barn Burning\n\n1247 Words | 3 Pages\n\nWilliam Faulkner, recognized as one of the greatest writers of all time, once made a speech as he accepted his Nobel prize for writing in which he stated that a great piece of writing should contain the truths of the heart and the conflicts that arise over these truths. These truths were love, honor, pity, pride, compassion and sacrifice. Truly it would be hard to argue that a story without these truths would be considered even a good story let alone a great one. So the question brought forward is whether Faulkner uses his own truths of the heart to make his story \"Barn Burning.\" Clearly the answer to this question is yes; his use of the truths of the heart are prevalent\n\nResponse to the Film William Faulkner: a Life on Paper\n\n492 Words | 1 Pages\n\nWhile I was watching the documentary William Faulkner, a Life on Paper I found it striking how the different people that were interviewed talked about two different sides of the author William Faulkner. His daughters, Jill Faulkner Sommers and his stepdaughter, spoke mainly about his alcohol abuse and his moodiness whereas Faulkner’s contemporaries from Oxford underlined Faulkner’s generosity and kindness. The documentary shows Faulkner not only as father of Jill and his stepdaughter but also as a father figure for many others. He had to take care of several families at once. At one point Faulkner had seventeen dependents to provide for. Many of the people that were interviewed describe Faulkner as being very generous and always willing to help others even when he had almost nothing himself. One special example is his brother Dean who died in an airplane accident and because Faulkner had bought the plane he apparently felt guilty about the death of his brother for the rest of his life as his sister-in-law says in the interview.\n\nOld Verities and Truths of the Heart in Writing\n\n1303 Words | 3 Pages\n\nIn his Novel Prize Address, Faulkner states that an author must leave \"no room in his workshop for anything but the old verities and truths of the heart...love and honor and pity and pride and compassion and sacrifice.\" He accuses his younger contemporaries of ignoring these noble spiritual pillars while pondering the atomic doom of mankind with questions like, \"When will I be blown up?\" Such physical fears, far from conflicts of the heart, are what plague his bomb-obsessed contemporaries. Yet Faulkner stands, seemingly alone, in opposition to this weakness; he \"decline[s] to accept the end of man\" and in rebelling, fights for the old universal truths and the glories of the past. In classical style, he brushes away passing fears and fads, settling for nothing less than the \"problems of the human heart in conflict with itself.\" Nothing else is worth writing about and Faulkner's work is living proof.\n\nSouthern Innfluences In \"A ROSE For Emily\"\n\n668 Words | 2 Pages\n\nWilliam Faulkner was a twentieth century American author who won the Nobel Prize for Literature. Most famous for his novel The Sound and the Fury, Faulkner defines Southern literature. In his mythical county of Yaknapatawpha, Faulkner contrasted the past with the present era. The past was represented in Emily Grierson, Colonel Sartoris, the Board of Alderman, and the Negro servant. Homer Barron, the new Board of Alderman, and the new sheriff represented the present.\n\nAnalysis of Jim Valvano’s Arthur Ashe Award Acceptance Speech\n\n784 Words | 2 Pages\n\nJim Valvano was the head coach for the North Carolina State Wolfpack in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). In 1992, he was diagnosed with terminal cancer and as a result he created the V Foundation, whose raises money for cancer research. In 1993, Valvano won the Arthur Ashe Award for Courage at the ESPY’s. In his acceptance speech, Valvano effectively incorporates the three appeals of speech writing, but uses a strong ethos appeal to capture the audience. Through such a strong ethos appeal, Valvano makes himself worthy for the award he is receiving, which is the goal for any acceptance speech. Valvano’s speech is also effective because he uses four of the six parts of a speech, found in the Ad Herenium. In Valvano’s speech, exordium, narration, proof, and peroration are present. Since the purpose of this speech is not to get the hearers to donate, division (showing the difference between you and your opponent) and refutation (lowering your opponent’s arguments) are not needed. So let us go through Valvano’s speech to see the different parts where he makes his ethos appeal.\n\nFaulkner The Quintessential Southern Writer\n\n1185 Words | 3 Pages\n\nOn September 25, 1897 in New Albany, Mississippi, a son was born to Murry Cuthbert and Maud Butler Faulkner. This baby, born into a proud, genteel Southern family, would become a mischievous boy, an indifferent student, and drop out of school; yet “his mother’s faith in him was absolutely unshakable. When so many others easily and confidently pronounced her son a failure, she insisted that he was a genius and that the world would come to recognize that fact” (Zane). And she was right. Her son would become one of the most exalted American writers of the 20th century, winning the Nobel Prize for Literature and two Pulitzers during his lifetime. Her son was William Faulkner."
