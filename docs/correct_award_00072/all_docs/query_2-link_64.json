        "text": "American short story writer, novelist, best known for his Yoknapatawpha cycle, a comédie humaine of the American South, which started in 1929 with Sartoris / Flags in the Dust and completed with The Mansion ( 1959). William Faulkner was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1949. Faulkner's style is not very easy - in this he has connections to European literary modernism. His sentences are long and hypnotic, sometimes he withholds important details, or refers to people or events that the reader will not learn about until much later.\n\nFAULKNER: The writer's only responsibility is to his art. He will be completely ruthless if he is a good one. He has a dream. It anguishes him so much he must get rid of it. He has no peace until then. Everything goes by the board: honor, pride, decency, security, happiness, all, to get the book written. If a writer has to rob his mother, he will not hesitate; the \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\" is worth any number of old ladies.\n\nINTERVIEWER: The could the lack of security, happiness, honor, be an important factor in the artist's creativity?\n\nFAULKNER: No. They are important only to his peace and contentment, and art has nom concern with peace and contentment. ('William Faulkner,' New York City, early in 1956, Writers at Work: The Paris Review Interviews: First Series, edited, and with an introduction by Malcolm Cowley, Viking Press, 1958, p. 124)\n\nWilliam Faulkner was born in New Albany, Mississippi, the oldest of four sons of Murray Charles Faulkner and Maud (Butler) Faulkner. While he was still a child, the family settled in Oxford in north-central Mississippi. Most of his life Faulkner lived in this town, characterized by Victorian regularity and grid pattern of the streets.\n\nSince childhood, Faulker was interested in reading. With his brother Murray he shared a taste for comic novels. While still at school, Faulkner began to write poetry. At the Oxford High School he played quarterback on football team and suffered a broken nose. Some of his fellow students referred to him as \"quair,\" partly because of Faulkner's dandyish dress. Before graduating, he dropped his studies and worked briefly in his grandfather's bank.\n\nAfter he rejected from the army for being too short (5' 5''), Faulkner enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force. He had basic training in Toronto. In World War I, he served with the RAF, but did not see any action. The war was over before Faulker could make his first solo flight. This did not prevent him from telling that he was shot down in France.\n\nFaulkner studied literature at the University of Mississippi for a short time. He also wrote some poems and drew cartoons for the university's humor magazine, The Scream. \"I liked the cartoons better than the poetry,\" recalled later George W. Healy Jr., who edited the magazine. In 1920 Faulkner left the university without taking a degree. Years later, reflecting his accomplishment, he said in a letter, \"what an amazing gift I had: uneducated in every formal sense, without even very literate, let alone literary, companions, yet to have made the things I made. I don't know where it came from.\" (quoted in The Signifying Eye: Seeing Faulkner's Art by Candace Waid, The University of Georgia Press, 2013, p. 44)\n\nFaulkner moved to New York City, where he worked as a clerk in a bookstore, and then returned to Oxford. He supported himself as a postmaster at the University of Mississippi, but was fired for reading on the job. Then he drifted to New Orleans. Sherwood Anderson encouraged him to write fiction rather than poetry.\n\nIn July 1925 Faulkner sailed out of New Orleans for Genoa, Italy, and from there he traveled to Paris. During his four months stay, he visited the famous bookshop Shakespeare & Co., but didn't meet Sylvia Beach. Just to get a glimpse of James Joyce, he made a habit of hanging out at the Café Voltaire, frequented by the author. Faulker also toured the WWI battlefields and spent ten days hiking in England.\n\nThe early works of Faulkner bear witness to his reading of Keats, Tennyson, Swinburne, and the fin-de-siècle English poetry. His first book was The Marble Faun (1924), a collection of poems; it did not gain success. Following a hiatus in Paris, he published Soldier's Pay (1926). The novel centered on the return of a soldier, who has been physically and psychologically disabled in WW I. Mosquitoes (1927) was a satirical portrait of Bohemian life, artist and intellectuals, in New Orleans. Most of the book was written in the Gulf Coast resort of Pascagoula. Faulkner often worked outdoors early in the morning. His room was equipped with daybed, a chair and a table for his portable typewriter. His typewriters Faulkner bought used, and pounded them with two fingers until they were worn out. He favored Underwood Universal Portable.\n\nIn 1929 Faulkner wrote Sartoris, the first of fifteen novels set in Yoknapatawpha County, a fictional region of Mississippi - actually Yoknapatawpha was Lafayette County. The Chickasaw Indian term meant \"water passes slowly through flatlands.\" Sartoris was later reissued as Flags in the Dust (1973).\n\nThe Yoknapatawpha novels spanned the decades of economic decline from the American Civil War through the Depression. Racism, class division, family as both life force and curse, are the recurring themes along with recurring characters and places. Faulkner utilized various writing styles. The narrative could change from the traditional storytelling (Light in August) to series of snapshots (As I Lay Dying) or collage (The Sound and the Fury). Go Down, Moses (1942) was a short story cycle about Yoknapatawpha blacks and includes one of Faulkner's most frequently anthologized stories, 'The Bear', about a ritual hunt, standing as a symbol of accepting traditional cultural values.\n\nAbsalom, Absalom! is generally considered Faulkner's masterpiece. It recods a range of voices and vocabularies, all trying to unravel the mysteries of Thomas Sutpen's violent life. \"He has never been known to use a word that might send a reader to the dictionary,\" Faulkner famously said about Hemingway, but he praised The Old Man and the Sea in a short review in the literary journal Shenandoah: \"Time may show it to be the best single piece of any of us, I mean his and my contemporaries.\" (Faulkner and Hemingway: Biography of a Literary Rivalry by Joseph Fruscione, The Ohio State University Press, 2012, p. 185) From the early 1930s these two future Nobel laureates aware of each other. First they were competitive in their literary masculine performance, but at the end, it was all about the Nobel Prize. Hemingway's personal library included Absalom, Absalom! and a lot of other major novels by Faulkner, who had The Fifth Column, Green Hills of Africa, The Short Stories, and To Have and Have Not on his shelves at Rowan Oak.\n\nIn 1929 Faulkner married Estelle Oldham Franklin, his childhood sweetheart, who had divorced his first husband, a lawyer. Next year he purchased the traditional Southern pillared house in Oxford, which he named Rowan Oak. Architecture was important for the author - he obsessively restored his own house, named his books after buildings ('the mansion'), and depicted them carefully: \"It was a big, squarish frame house that had once been white, decorated with cupolas and spires and scrolled balconies in the heavily lightsome style of the seventies, set on what had once been our most select street.\" (from 'A Rose for Emily' (1930), in These Thirteen: Volume Two of the Collected Short Stories of William Faulkner, Chatto & Windus, 1963, p. 9)\n\nWith The Sound and the Fury (1929), his first masterwork, Faulkner gained national recognition as a writer with a distinctive voice. Its title originated from the famous lines in Shakespeare's play Macbeth: \"Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player, / That struts and frets his hour upon the stage, / And then is heard no more. It is a tale / Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, / Signifying nothing.\"\n\nWhile working at an electrical power station in a nightshift job, Faulkner wrote As I Lay Dying (1930), about the illness, death, and burial of Addie Bundren. The book consists of interior monologues, most of them spoken by members of the Bundren family. The deceased herself has one monologue; her dying wish is to be buried in her home town. Struggling through flood and fire the family carries her coffin to the graveyard in Jefferson, Mississippi. The journey is cursed. Cash, Addie's son, breaks his leg, Darl, another son, attempts to cremate his mother's body by setting fire to the barn, and Dewey Dell is raped in the cellar of a pharmacy. Addie is buried next to her father in the family plot. Darl's sanity dies with her mother and he is taken finally to an asylum. Anse, the father, appears with a woman, introducing her as the new Mrs Bundren.\n\nSanctuary (1931), dedicated to Sherwood Anderson for services rendered, was according to the author \"deliberately conceived to make money.\" In the story a young woman is raped by a murderer. She finds sanctuary in a brothel, but none of the sexual acts there is described in detail. Sanctuary was one of nine novel identified as obscene in the criminal proceedings in the Court of Quarter sessions in Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania. The other allegedly obscene novels were Harold Robbins's Never Love a Stranger, James T. Farrell's Studs Lonigan Trilogy, and A World I Never Made, Erskine Caldwell's God Little Acre, Calder Willingham's End as a Man, and Faulkner's Wild Palms.\n\nIn 1933 Faulkner started to take flying lessons and he bought his own plane. To support himself, Estelle, their three children, and some of the Oldhams, Faulker worked over the next 20 years in Hollywood on several screenplays, from Today We Live (1933) to Land of the Pharaos (1955). Hollywood provided him a reliable source of income.\n\nUnder contract to Twentieth Century-Fox, Faulkner produced five screenplays based on popular novels – Banjo on My Knee, The Last Slaver, Splinter Fleet, Drums Along the Mohawk and The Left Hand of God. The Road to Glory, co-written with Joel Sayre, was loosely adapted from a French war film, Les croix de bois (Wooded Crosses, 1932), made by Raymond Bernard and based on Roland Dorgelès's autobiographical novel from 1919.\n\nAt times, Faulkner called his Hollywood contracts his \"sojourn downriver,\" an analogy of being sold as a slave into the deepest South. (Student Companion to William Faulkner by John Dennis Anderson, 2007, p. 15) His own stories were for the conservative producers too daring: they dealt with rape, incest, suicide etc. Moreover, Faulkner had taste for experiment: he offered readers page-long sentences, and forcing them to hold in mind details and phrases that are meaningful only at the end of the story.\n\nBetween scriptwriting Faulkner published several novels. Pylon (1934) was a story of four adults and a child, who travel from air show to another. The book did not sell as well as Faulkner had hoped. Absalom, Absalom! focused on Thomas Sutpen's attempts to found a Southern dynasty in the 19th-century Mississippi. The Wild Palms (1939) was a story of the Snopes family, in which the character McCord is based on Ernest Hemingway and parallels A Farwell to Arms. Go Down Moses, and Other Stories (1942) contained 'The Bear,' one of his most celebrates pieces of short fiction.\n\nFaulkner lived at my house. He was fond of me, considered himself a member of the family. He was making $300 a week and he was starving on it. He was sending the money home. That was one the reasons why he stayed with me. He'd been drunk so often that no producer would hire him any more. But Warner Bros. hired him, and Warner boasted that he had the best writer in the world for \"peanuts.\" (The Thieves' Market: A.I. Bezzerides in Hollywood' by Lee Server, in The Big Book of Noir, edited by Ed Gorman, Lee Server and Martin H. Greenberg, Carroll & Graf Publishers, 1998, pp. 118-119)\n\nBy 1945, when Faulkner's novels were out of print, he moved again to Hollywood to write under contract movie scripts, mostly for director Howard Hawks, with whom he had befriended at MGM in the early 1930s. Hawks had read Faulkner's 1926 novel Soldier's Pay when it had just appeared and recommended it to his friends. Faulkner wrote for the director an adaptation from his short story 'Turn About'. Their first meeting ended in heavy drinking. \"Just a year apart in age, with Hawks the senior, both were reserved to the point of noncommunicativemess; Nunnally Johnson was astonished by the sight of the two of them just sitting together not saying a word. When they did talk, they did do slowly, in a drawling manner.\" (Howard Hawks: The Grey Fox of Hollywood by Todd McCarthy, Grove Press,1997, p. 177)\n\nFaulkner cooperated with Hawks among others in the films To Have and Have Not (1944), based freely on Ernest Hemingway's work, and The Big Sleep (1946), adapted from Raymond Chandler's novel. When Hemingway had turned down Hawk's offer to work with his own book, the director had said, \"I'll get Faulkner to do it; he can write better than you can anyway.\" (Ibid., p. 358)\n\nThe publication of The Portable Faulkner(1946), edited by Malcolm Cowley, rescued Faulkner from near-oblivion and launched his second period of success. However, Faulkner's physique and mental stamina were weakened by hard drinking. \"When I have one martini,\" he told a young actress, \"I feel bigger, wiser, taller. When I have a second, I feel superlative. When I have more, there's no holding me.\" (Faulkner: A Biography by Joseph Blotner, University of Mississippi Press, 2005, p. 227) Besides problems with alcohol, his wife's drug addiction and declining health shadowed his life. \"I will always believe that my first responsibility is to the artist, the work,\" he wrote in a letter. \"But there is a responsibility to the female child whose presence in the world I am accountable for.\" (William Faulkner and Joan Williams: The Romance of Two Writers by Lisa C. Hickman, foreword by Richard Bausch, McFarland & Company, 2006, p. 140) His daughter Jill later said that nothing about the marriage was right.\n\nHollywood was not the best place to take a refuge from domestic problems, because Faulkner also had there series of affairs, among others with Meta Carpenter Wilde, a script girl, who wrote a book about their relationship. Faulkner did not hide his fear and contempt of the city: \"Sometimes I think if I do one more treatment or screenplay, I'll lose whatever power I have as a writer,\" he told her. (Faulkner: A Biography, p 462)\n\nBefore receiving the Nobel Prize, Faulkner wrote in a letter to Malcolm Cowley that he did not want to leave a mark in history as \"a private individual\" but as the author of his work. ('Remembering William Faulkner's Address Upon Receiving the Nobel Prize for Literature' by Zbigniew Maszewski, Polish Journal for American Studies, October 2019) Faulkner published in 1951 Requiem for a Nun, and badly received magnum opus A Fable in 1954. The Town (1957) and The Mansion (1959) continued the story of the Snopes family, which he had begun in The Hamlet (1940).\n\nWith The Reivers (1962), set early in the 20th-century, Faulkner nostalgically revisited his childhood, and extends the world of Sanctuary. On June 17, 1962, Faulkner was thrown from a horse, and a few weeks later, on July 6, he died of a coronary occlusion. The New York Times (July 7, 1962) cited his critics in his obituary and stated that \"Mr. Faulkner's writings showed an obsession with murder, rape, incest, suicide, greed and general depravity that did not exist anywhere but in the author's mind\". Fourty-three years later, in his review of Jay Parini's book One Matchless Time: A Life of William Faulkner (2004) the Nobel writer J.M. Coetzee defined Faulkner not only as \"the most radical innovator in the annals of American fiction,\" but \"a writer to whom the avant-garde of Europe and Latin America would go to school.\" (The New York Review of Books, April 7, 2005)\n\nFor further reading: William Faulkner: His South by R.P.
