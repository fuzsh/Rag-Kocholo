        "text": "Abstract\n\nWilliam Faulkner’s short stories, like the rest of his oeuvre, are intertwined with the history of the South that they chronicle from the first settlers to the mid-twentieth century. At the same time these stories are among the most renowned works of the international modernist avant-garde. This chapter traces the interplay between local subject matter and avant-garde aesthetics in two of Faulkner’s most accomplished stories, “Dry September” (1931) and “Barn Burning” (1939). Following a brief introduction to Faulkner’s life and works, the essay addresses central topics and concerns in both stories, in particular their depiction of Southern racial and class tensions respectively. It examines the aesthetic strategies Faulkner employs in probing these tensions and concludes with a survey of critical readings of the stories from the New Criticism to the present.\n\nMüller, Timo. \"18 William Faulkner (1897–1962)\".
