Its central theme, as the author tells us, is that birds' nests are artistic creations: their construction and design consciously intended to be attractive not just as a safe and desirable place for the female to raise her brood, but also, like the bower-bird's bower which is decorated with carefully chosen flowers, leaves, and found objects, pleasing in a wholly non-utilitarian, 'artistic' way. We humans are not, she suggests, the only animals to be artists.\n\nThis is a difficult argument to maintain, since the purpose of the embellishments added to bowers and nests is still to attract a mate. However, many of the nests which Janine Burke describes are, indeed, superbly and skillfully crafted and are also beautiful objects for us to see and touch. Our definition of art, too, has changed radically in recent times. So, Burke bolsters her argument by comparing the creation of these nests to the creations of a number of different human artists in a number of different media. Robert Smithson's 'Spiral Jetty', an environmental sculpture made of rock in the Great Salt Lake, Utah, is one example she offers. Others, are the nest photography of Sharon Beals and the wild-life photography of Andy Rouse.\n\nThe problem, for me, is that this book is a rag-bag of information - or, maybe I should say a magpie collection of facts - related, often very remotely and sometimes not at all, to her argument. For example, after a perfectly legitimate description of the nesting skills of storks, we get a long passage about Karen Blixen's life and love, her home in Africa which is now a museum, and her affliction with syphilis, all because, it seems, the stork was her totem bird.\n\nBurke wrote at length about Blixen and other artists in her recent book Visions. In Nest, she reprises a great deal of this, drawing on what she has already written about, for example, Picasso, Frida Kahlo, Virginia Woolf and the Australian Aboriginal artist Emily Kame Kngwarreye. She also trawls the poetry collections for bird poems, coming up with work by Keats, Shelley, Hughes and Emily Dickinson. None of this, however, is really of help in proving that birds are conscious artists.\n\nBurke's descriptions of her own observations of nesting birds are interesting and sometimes - as with her experiences with her noisy neighbours, the Indian Miner birds - quite funny. But do we really need to know how insecure she felt about writing this book, or how she overcame her early hero-worship of an influential art critic to arrive at her own opinions about art?\n\nThis book is beautifully presented, a pleasure to look at and hold; and Burke, who is an art historian, writes fluently and well when she describes art. She could have made much more of the nests themselves, their creation, their individuality, their diversity and their beauty, but, to my mind, she got sidetracked too often to make this a satisfying book.\n\nUncle Yeshu, Messiah\n\nWilliam Harwood\n\nBookSurge Publishing\n\nc/o Amazon Digital Publishing\n\n1419657771, $23.99, www.Booksurge.com, www.Amazon.com\n\nG. Richard Bozarth\n\nReviewer\n\nUncle Yeshu, Messiah is the fourth novel by William Harwood, an Australian-born citizen of Canada, I have read. All have been enjoyable, but Yeshu attains a level of excellence the others failed to reach. I really enjoyed this novel, and it has nothing to do with the fact that I'm one of those Atheists who enjoy books that are guaranteed to upset religionists (in this case, Christians). This is an outstanding version of one of the Western culture's superb fiction stories. Yeshu is also a fine representative of that subgenre of fiction that tells the \"real\" stories that popular myths are based on.\n\nThe myth being exposed is the Jesus fairy tale told in the Bible's gospels. Because the subject of the myth evolved in less than a century from a Judaist Messiah to a pagan dying/resurrecting savior deity, Yeshu extends beyond the life and execution of Yahuwshua (\"Yeshu\" is an intimate diminutive) to cover developments in the communities that believed him to be the Messiah over the decades until the publication of the Gospel of John, which promoted Yeshu to godhood. To do this, the book is told as a memoir by one of Yeshu's nephews, who finished it at the age of 112. His purpose is to tell the truth about Yeshu and also about the evolution of the cults that were dedicated to Yeshu. As a Judaist relative who knew Yeshu lived and died a true Judaist believer, the nephew is particularly displeased by the pagan-style myths about Yeshu generated by the pagan-friendly cult Saul (better known as Paul) founded. His loony Uncle Yeshu presented as the Christian Jesus the Christ is an absurdity he wants to expose, which he makes clear near the end of his \"gospel/acts\" memoir (p. 286-287): \"I have shown you who and what my uncle Yeshu really was, and what the infidel Anointers have turned him into in the ninety-one years since his death\" (the long quote below explains the use of \"Anointers\" instead of \"Christians\").\n\nYeshu is a loony (a plus for any future cult leader) who also has the \"good\" fortune to conform to Isaiah's prophecy of a physically deformed, hideously ugly Messiah. His fate is sealed when he joins his family in getting baptized in the Jordan River by Yohanan the Immerser (another Messiah candidate in those Messiah-expecting days). When Yeshu is dunked (p. 46), he hallucinates the voice of Yahweh telling him, \"You are my beloved son. Today I have become your father.\" After that \"revelation\", Yeshu joins the club of Judaist Messiahs that have been doing business among the Jews ever since the Messiah theology became part of Judaism. The rest of Yeshu's story follows the same basic plot used in the first three gospels and presents a realistic secular version that very likely could have happened. This is the purpose of Yeshu, since Harwood wanted to write a historical novel that keeps as close to reality as fiction allows.\n\nSince keeping it as real as possible was one of Harwood's goals, there is a significant amount of authentic facts in Yeshu. A reader who has read Harwood's God, Jesus, And The Bible will be able to spot the nonfiction content easily, though it is absolutely not necessary to read GJB first in order to enjoy Yeshu (just like it isn't necessary to read Civil War history to enjoy Gone With The Wind). Since Harwood is a nontheist (the term he prefers over \"Atheist\") and not in any way an accommodationist, the facts contained in Yeshu are the kind that will not make Christians happy. This is my favorite (p. 212):\n\nRomans and Romanized Greeks have a perverted addiction to bathing, sometimes scrubbing their entire bodies as often as three or four times in a single week. After scrubbing, they are then anointed with olive oil by a skilled masseur, to give the body the smooth touch that distinguishes a patrician from a plebeian. Even in the rare instances that the khristos, the customer, is as committed as any Jewdean to the belief that carnal recreation should involve a man and a woman, the khristianos, the bathboy, is bound to be a catamite slave. In calling Yeshu Khristos, meaning \"the anointed,\" Saul had inadvertently given his Greek audience the impression that his dead king had been oiled - and fellated - in a public bathhouse. It was for that reason that the derogatory term, Anointers [Greek: Khristianoi], was first applied to Saul's infidel followers at Antioch. And not very long after that, the Anointers themselves started calling their religion Anointianity [Greek: Khristianismos], as if it were a title of honor.\n\nThe quote is also convenient for showing the one annoying fault of Yeshu: putting what should have been footnotes or endnotes in the text of the fiction. It is not a serious fault, but these boldface editorial insertions annoyed me because they are like speed bumps that keep jarring the smooth ride of the fiction. This style of editorial insertion worked very nicely in Harwood's excellent translation of the Bible, but is not a good technique for fiction.\n\nYeshu has added value in the form of two nonfiction essays that follow the novel: \"Was Jesus A Real Person From History?\" and \"Jesus' Deification: When And Why?\". The latter is fascinating and the former is very persuasive. Harwood argues that there was a real Jesus and that what can be called the secular parts of his biography in the Gospels is reliably accurate (which means his hypothesis justifies calling the Gospels historical fantasy fiction because the tales have historical and supernatural content). I am almost persuaded (however, what keeps me at almost is a discussion for a different venue).\n\nThe important message that I am delivering is that Uncle Yeshu, Messiah is an excellent reading experience. Even though the nephew writes from the perspective of a Judaist who scorns infidels like all good Judaists should, the mission the nephew is trying to accomplish is a Freethought one: debunking the ridiculous myths about his loony uncle that continued to get more ridiculous until finally he lived to see his uncle promoted to a deity by a cult that had ceased being any kind of Judaism. The result is an impious version of one of the best fiction stories produced by Western culture that will delight all Freethinkers, Secular Humanists, and Atheists/nontheists who are not radical accommodationists. Harwood deserves to be congratulated by everybody in the Freethought Movement for adding another wonderful book to Freethought's library!\n\nThe Wedding Gift\n\nKathleen Mckenna\n\nBell Bridge Books\n\nPO Box 300921, Memphis, TN 38130\n\nwww.BellBridgeBooks.com\n\n9781611940527 $14.95, www.amazon.com\n\nChasity Brewer\n\nReviewer\n\n'The Wedding Gift' is set in the small town of Dalton, Oklahoma. It tells the story of 17 years old, Leanne, who is the 'prettiest girl in town' and she is darn proud of it! She begins dating George Willets Jr. of Willets Petroleum. The Willets family is the richest family in town and Leanne's family the Worthier's are, well let's just said they are on the opposite side of the track as the Willets. This could be a really good thing considering the Willets are labeled as a 'terrible family'.\n\nSo when George asks Leanne to marry him, to his mother's horror, Leanne accepts, not because she loves him. No that was never the reason that she was with him to begin with if she's honest about it. However she did always imagine herself marrying a rich man and becoming rich and important. George makes her that as well as giving her all the materialistic things she could want. Including his big wedding gift to her a mansion that belonged to his aunt and uncle.\n\nOnly the story behind that mansion isn't so happily ever after. His Aunt Robina murdered all of her five children then her husband Roger and then herself. After that massacre everyone swore the house was haunted and no one have every lived in that house again. However who was Leanne to turn down a free mansion. So she gets over her initial fear and moves into the mansion. Then Robina's ghost starts visiting Leanne, in a lot of different places and things become a lot more complicated.\n\nOk so first let me begin by saying I loved the plot and background story of Robina and Roger. As well as all the secrets of the Willets family that begins to unravel as the story progresses.\n\nWith that said I had a few problems with the book. The language in this book was terrible. It took southern language to a new low. Part of my family is from the south and I can assure you none of them talk like that. I am sure some southerners would find it insulting even. It made the characters, especially Leanne sound about as smart as a box of rocks. I'm sorry to say this because I really liked the plot of this story and there is a lot of talent and good writing in this book just not in this portrayed southern dialogue. Even though I never considered Oklahoma southern, but then again I don't know too much about Dalton, Oklahoma.\n\nThe other thing that bothered me was how very vain Leanne is and how very little regard she has for anyone else's feeling or lives for that matter. In her eyes it's always about her, and she loves hearing people call her by her title, 'the prettiest girl in town'. She even marries a man she doesn't love and gets mad when she is referred to as a 'gold digger'! Well I would hate to be the one to inform her that she is! Hello, she doesn't love George and is only with him for the things he can give her. If that's not gold digging, I don't know what is.\n\nOverall Leanne's character put a damper on the story for me. I did like the history and the ghost story aspect of it though. There was talent in the writing and I didn't have to force myself through it. Overall I give it three stars and I would read another book by her to see what other stories she is capable of. She has peaked my interest.\n\nAnd There Was David-Kanza\n\nAlbert Russo\n\nwww.albertrusso.eu\n\nImago Press\n\n3710 East Edison, Tucson AZ 85716-2912\n\n9781935437437, $14.00 (pb), $17.95 (hc)\n\nDavid Alexander\n\nReviewer\n\nAnd There Was David-Kanza continues a cycle of fiction that has preoccupied author Albert Russo for decades, and which his perhaps best known work, Mixed Blood, tracks with in a clear line of progression. The novel begins in central Africa in the mid-1920s, where those of mixed racial ancestry occupied a social limbo between \"whites\" and \"coloreds.\" David-Kanza -- offspring of Daniel Sardo, friend of main character Sandro Romano-Livi, a Jewish immigrant from the island city of Rhodes, Greece, and Shumani, a Kishwali-speaking black African tribeswoman from the nearby province of Kivu -- is a character symbolic of the central themes of the narrative.\n\n\"David-Kanza\" is above all about a family's odyssey across geographical space, physical time and levels of consciousness, encompassing passages, rites and metamorphoses, that are structural, mental, economic, political, technological, and somehow, even of the stuff of synchronicity. This mixture of attributes affords the novel a secure place amid the cannon of fiction that arose from an earlier era colonialism, empire building and commercial exploitation in Africa, and elsewhere in the Third World.\n\nAfrica in particular underwent a series of metamorphoses that continues to the present day, generating violence as relentless friction generates light, sound and heat. Although the novel's setting shifts to the temperate Lombard region of Italy, to whose industrial center of Monza, the family repatriated beginning in 1959 due to violent civil unrest that followed in the wake of Congolese independence (and continued with Zimbabwe's and Zambia's creation from Southern and Northern Rhodesia in the early 1960s, and the later creation of Zaire in 1971, now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, or DRC), and finally to Brussels, Belgium, the transmission under the story's chassis is the family's African experience.\n\nStructurally \"David-Kanza\" uses the device of a tripartite narrative told by three of the story's principles -- paterfamilias Sandro Romano-Livi, matriarch Gloria Simpson, and finally David-Kanza himself -- based on the chance discovery of a diary kept by Sandro by the widowed Gloria upon his death. The stories overlap, to some extent, with Sandro's beginning the triune narrative, in which the experiences of other principal characters are also told. Chief among these characters are Astrid and Dalia, natural offspring of Sandro and Gloria, who, like his adoptive parents, embrace David (also called by the diminutive \"Daviko\") as a full member of the family. Such a plot structure has the advantage of presenting multiple points of view where events shared by all participants are narrated as seen through different pairs of eyes, and of clarifying and adding dimension to events that took place before, after, or concurrently with the first-person narrative's time-frame.\n\nThis storytelling approach is especially applicable here because the backgrounds of the three protagonists are considerably different. Sandro is an Italian Jew whose family had weathered persecutions following the First World War but who has fled Greece in the face of still greater persecutions as the Axis powers draw their net over the Romano-Livi's once relatively safe haven. Gloria is an Englishwoman from that well-mannered bastion of the three British classes that George Bernard Shaw once likened to a glass of beer -- froth at the top, dregs at the bottom, but excellent in the middle. Gloria is a \"proper\" English girl whose family's middle class values have lost none of their importance when transplanted to the eponymous Rhodesian capital city of Salisbury, Rhodesia, where she was born and raised, and from which, following a soured love affair, she came north to Elisabethville in the Belgian Congo on a spur-of-the-moment vacation trip that resulted in her meeting her future husband.\n\nDavid-Kanza -- partly as a result of a pact between his adoptive father and the birth mother's tribe to have the boy remain in the tribal village until he's undergone the traditional rites of manhood, and the European education and upbringing he receives when he's later adopted as a full-fledged member of the family along with the two natural children, both girls, who become his sisters in fact as well as name -- is in many ways the future, and a symbol of what post-colonial Africa ultimately became and is still becoming, albeit after considerable tribulations. But the backdrop of the dismal end-results of colonial control in the Belgian Congo in particular and in Africa in general can be likened to what happened later in totally different settings in widely separated areas of the world that include India and Yugoslavia. In both cases different religious and ethnic groups lived side-by-side until would-be and self-styled liberators rose to light the flames that led to spasmodic upheavals of violence and bloodshed.\n\nConsciously or otherwise, the thread of the world as a business arrangement, or of business transactions functioning as the central organizing principle of the world system, and of human existence within its confines, runs through the book's narrative. One of the book's messages clearly seems to say that intentions, good or evil, mean absolutely nothing. Those with a master plan for change coupled with an unbending will to implement that plan to the letter -- even for the good of this or that nation or for humanity itself -- are not merely sometimes tragically mistaken, they are always tragically mistaken.\n\nBut \"David-Kanza\" is as much about the power of love as it concerns the consequences of institutionalized prejudice, the Malthusian outcomes of colonialist politics and economics and the checkered fortunes of war. Love welds the Romano-Livi family together, despite the different cultures that fate, and Africa itself, have brought together to make it up. The family of David-Kanza too, is emblematic of what New York City Mayor David Dinkins, then blind to its irony, foresaw as a \"gorgeous mosaic\" for the metropolis' varied cultures. Nor is the novel a classic roman a clef, but it is certainly a mutlilevel message that declares unashamedly that when peoples are predisposed to live harmoniously with one another, wars of liberation, police actions, peacekeeping operations, humanitarian operations, and similar euphemisms which stand for invasion and occupation, can be rendered unnecessary.\n\nAnd so Albert Russo's \"David-Kanza\" is finally a novel less even about Africa than it is about civilization itself, for the magnetic poles of the novel are, on one hand, anarchy, versus culture on the other. It argues that civilization is an unstable compound, highly reactive to the acids and caustic reagents of war, business and politics, which shred its fibers and rip the bonds that hold it together. Russo seems to say that civilization is an organic process that's sustained by the goodwill of those individuals who make it up, that civilization is nourished by the mutual caring and understanding of its participants much in the manner of the Romano-Livi family and David-Kanza himself. We should all hope that the qualities exemplified by the family whose odyssey Albert Russo has chronicled across three generations through the magnifying lens of fiction, represents the future, and not merely the past.\n\nThe Tombstone Rose\n\nAnnie McKnight\n\nBreakaway Media (Tucson)\n\n0843946814, $3.99 via download\n\nDon Martin\n\nReviewer\n\nSome books you just can't put down. If you are a fan of historical western fiction The Tombstone Rose will be one of them. The story of a young singer in the west of the 1880's, it is densely packed with accurate historical facts. The story takes more twists and turns than any old-west stagecoach line. You never really know where the stagecoach will stop next, or even which stagecoach you are on.\n\nThe story concerns Charlotte Tate, a beautiful, young (18 year old) aspiring singer. She dreams of one day performing in New York City, and San Francisco, and she has the talent to do it. But for now she is stuck in dusty Tombstone. She is also in love with two men. The first is Morgan Earp, brother of Wyatt, and famous for his part in the Shootout at the OK Corral. The second is Jake Cottrell, an ordinary cowboy. Back in those days no respectable woman would date a cowboy, much less marry him.\n\nThe book breaks nicely into three sections. The first is a description of what life was like in 1880's Tombstone. It had been only a wide spot in the road, until silver was discovered there. Then it became a wild-west boom town. At it's height it had 110 saloons, about 30 houses of ill repute, and only 4 churches. It was not an easy place to live. There were two types of law. There was the town marshal, who really had no power, and the cowboys, who controlled the town and enforced their own law, usually at the point of a gun.\n\nThe second part of the book details Charlotte's attempt to become a known singer. She is hired as an entertainer at a local theater. She assumes this means she will sing. Actually the entertainment she will provide is as a \"bar girl\" who flirts with the men and keeps them buying drinks for her and themselves. She leaves that job for another theater. That one is essentially a bordello, with live entertainment. She does perform there, but the patrons don't care or even notice her because they are there for other reasons. At one point she is essentially kidnapped and sold into marriage to a man she has never met. She escapes, and joins a traveling entertainment troupe. She gets some fame, and becomes known as \"The Tombstone Rose.\"\n\nThe third part of the book describes Charlotte's life after she leaves the theater. She had made a wise investment in a silver mine, and the investment paid off handsomely. She finds herself independently wealthy. She decides to build her own theater, at which she will be the feature performer. But she slowly realizes being a performer is not what she really wanted all along. Plus, she has her love life to figure out. J. Carson Black writes this section with a lot of sensitivity and skill. You will come to know who Charlotte really is very well, and what motivates her.\n\nThe Tombstone Rose is the best historical fiction novel I've read in a long time. Loaded with facts and descriptions, it is very well researched. The stories of the Gunfight at the OK Corral and the devastating fire of 1883 are correctly told and accurate. The book will appeal to a wide range of readers. For the history buffs, there are plenty of historical details there to consider. For fans of western novels the book gives a very nice description of what life was really like in the \"wild west.\" But at it's core the book is a romance novel, so romance fans will find it enjoyable. I'd certainly recommend the book for anyone looking to do a bit of time travel, back to 130 years ago.\n\nThe Blind Side: Evolution of a Game\n\nMichael Lewis\n\nW.W. Norton & Company, Inc\n\n500 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10110\n\nhttp://books.wwnorton.com/books/index.aspx\n\n9780393330472, $13.95, www.amazon.com\n\nEsther\n\nReviewer\n\nThe story of Michael Oher is fascinating and almost unbelievable considering the fairy-tale like elements. A poor, unnoticed, black kid is adopted by a rich, white family, becomes a football phenom, gets into college, and goes in the first round of the NFL draft. It's a little hard to believe...\n\nOne of the best parts of this books is that it was written by a good author, Michael Lewis. Like Moneyball, Lewis takes something technical (the birth of the left tackle) and weaves it into a dynamic and interesting story. For those who are less into football and more into story, realize that there are large sections devoted to the evolution of the football game from a running one to a passing one. It's needed to provide a context for Michael Oher and the reason why he was such a big deal. For those more into football, the story does not detract from the discussion of football, the quarterback's blindside, the birth of the left tackle, and players ranging from Lawrence Taylor to Johnathan Ogden.\n\nA good book and an excellent blend of the game of football and an incredible human story.\n\nWings of Hope\n\nHillary E.

Dr. Sol Weinstein has an inoperable brain tumor and only three months to live. At twenty-seven, Julia's life in San Francisco has reached an impasse and she welcomes the chance to re-unite with a man who is more a legend to her than a father. He divorced her mother when she was five so she \"spent a lifetime flying between Lubbock, Texas, and La Guardia\", but she never really knew him. Soon after she arrives in New York, Julia realizes she might be in over her head. As though sensing her trepidation, Dr. Weinstein takes his daughter on a magical mystery tour of his past, including a memorable week in Lausanne for Julia and her father and a romantic weekend in Paris for Julia. Julia's narrative reads like a memoir as she reveals the intimacy of a father and daughter re-discovering one another as adults, warts and all. The bond that grows between Julia and Sol at the end of his life makes you believe you can make up for lost time. \"Wings of Hope\" is a bittersweet story that shows how life can be full of hope and surprise for those who let it in.\n\nBethany's Bookshelf\n\nCollege Prep 101, second edition\n\nLance A.

A successful farm family - husband, wife, daughter, and their boarding schoolteacher - was murdered, and the crime obscured through arson. The family's surviving son, Ray Pfanschmidt, was arrested on suspicion of murder. What came next was a lurid trial that spanned three courtrooms, peppered with talented attorneys, claims of rigged evidence, squabbles over the family's prodigous estate possibly being inherited by an alleged murderer, and much more. The rest of Ray's family was divided over whether he might be guilty, while his fiancee supported him. Lies Told Under Oath reconstructs the history of the (in)famous trial, verdict, and subsequent fallout, drawing upon trial transcripts, newspaper accounts, and more. A striking portrayal of true crime, Lies Told Under Oath unquestionably tells of witnesses who committed perjury - but were they witnesses for the prosecution, or the defense? Even today, the evidence of Ray's guilt or innocence is difficult to evaluate; Lies Told Under Oath renders as crystal clear a picture as historical records can give and leaves the reader to decide for himself or herself.

How many readers knew that?\n\nZombie Science displays sections like The Zombie Brain, Zombie Blood and Zombie Hunting technique\n\n(among many others). My favorite part of this section is when the author is introducing how zombies find us:\n\n\"Prevailing wisdom suggests that zombies do not simply stumble about without purpose but, instead, do everything in their power to relentlessly hunt and kill the living. To that end, their seemingly random power of movement when not actively stalking prey may more closely mirror that of many predators when locating food over great distances.\"\n\n--- Everything you ever wanted...by Matt Mogt, Page 60\n\nZombie Survival is next to share with you; Water to Drink, Protective Shelter, Food to Eat, Weapons of War and much more. Considering my love of clothing, it is only natural that I would be concerned with Zombie Survival Clothing. According to Mogt, there is one basic question that sums up the issue:\n\n\"If you were facing a deadly viral threat that could infect you with just a single drop of blood in your eye, don't you think you would at least wear sunglasses?\"\n\n---Everything you...Matt Mogt\n\nPage 123\n\nPopular Culture is the last and final section. Of concern here are things like why Zombies are so popular, Zombie Video Games, Zombie Literature, Zombie Organizations and The Wrong and Ridiculous. This section brings it all together for the reader.\n\n\"So don't trust what I say as fact. Don't blindly trust any published expert. Don't even trust yourself, as ego and bias can be deadly hazards.

Ellen's father, a distant, cold man who works long hours, expects the children to be in bed when he comes home, offering Ellen no counterbalance to what she perceives as a loveless existence. Into her life steps Ellen's grandmother, who died before Ellen was born, to become Ellen's confidante and role model. As Ellen grows up, her dysfunctional family fractures and Ellen is forced to act more mature than she is as she struggles to take care of others with only her grandmother to console her and offer advice. When things seem to be improving, a tragedy occurs, and only then is a secret about her dead grandmother revealed to Ellen.\n\nLissa Brown offers an intriguing look into the dynamics of a dysfunctional family circa the 1950s, told through the eyes of a young girl struggling to understand the reasons behind her parents' actions. Baby boomers most especially will identify with this book due to the author's skillful portrayal of the time and culture. Brown shows a great aptitude for describing scenes so realistic the reader will feel as if s/he has stepped back in time and become part of the story. The characters are well-developed and the story one that will stay with the reader long after the book is finished.\n\nGetting Personal\n\nDiane Amos\n\nThe Wild Rose Press\n\n9781601544384, $14.99 paperback, $0.99 Kindle ebook\n\nMonique St. Cyr writes obituaries for the local newspaper but dreams of being an investigative reporter. Monique has a big heart, sharing her home with abandoned pets and working as a volunteer at a veterinarian's office. Although Monique would like less interference from her meddling mother, that's hard to do since they share a duplex. If that isn't bad enough, Monique's mother, who writes erotic fiction, wants to use her as a resource for her next book about online dating. Monique has one big problem, though: she can't seem to stop fibbing and tells one whopper to her boss, who expects her to deliver on a promise for a big scoop about criminal activity within their city. So Monique pairs up with a wannabe private investigator which only leads to more trouble. To the rescue steps police officer Jake Dube and the chemistry between the two explodes. But this couple is headed for trouble. Monique wants to establish her career before settling down and having a family but Jake's ready for the white cottage and picket fence.\n\nDiane Amos pens a humorous and heartwarming story of a feisty yet klutzy woman who aspires to be a journalist and will do anything it takes to get there. Monique is a very likeable character and her propensity to veer outside the truth is humorous and fun. Her relationship with cop Jake Dube sizzles yet Amos has placed a barrier between the two concerning their present life choices which hopefully will resolve with future books. Regarding the ebook, irregular formatting was distracting to this reviewer, as were the grammatical errors (i.e. your instead of you're). Other than that, this is a fun introduction to what looks to be an engaging series.\n\nChristy Tillery French, Reviewer\n\nwww.about.me/christytilleryfrench\n\nClark's Bookshelf\n\nTrue Strength\n\nKevin Sorbo\n\nDaCapo Press\n\nc/o Perseus Books Group\n\n11 Cambridge Center, Cambridge, MA 02142\n\nwww.perseusbooksgroup.com\n\n9780306820366, $26.00, www.amazon.com\n\nMemoirs tend to chronicle the events that have taken place in a person's life from birth to the present day. Kevin Sorbo's \"True Strength\" is different because he starts his life over after having suffered three aneurisms at the age of 38. This is his story, which tells of the new fortitude he found in coping with illness that should have resolved itself after 3 to 8 months according to his doctors.\n\nThe journey he faced mirrored the best-known character he portrayed in \"Hercules: The Legendary Journeys. Kevin's ability to be normal challenged him for many years after nearly dying. He had to cover-up his disabilities during the filming of \"Hercules,\" as the contract with studio called for substantial financial gain after 100 episodes aired. The finances were not only important to him, but to the rest of those involved with the show. Fans were out of the loop with respect to how serious his health issues had become. Many scenes filmed showed Kevin sitting on a log and dubbing old footage along with stuntmen to keep the action moving. Those working with him were well aware of his limitations to work only very short periods and then having to rest.\n\nRecovery was very slow for Kevin, but this caused him to foment a new philosophy of life. He realized those things, which he truly enjoyed, were now outdated. He would have to find new outlets and a new style of living. His relationship with his wife Sam became stronger and his reliance upon another person replaced his being away on the golf course or traipsing around the world in furtherance of his career. Sam succinctly brought it to his attention during the recovery period by stating their marriage might have failed had it not been for his slowing down and paying more attention to home.\n\nWhenever people would ask Kevin how he was doing, he would always answer that everything was fine. In truth, he had headaches, dizziness, problems with balance, and generalized fatigue. He was not doing well at all, but the public and friends never knew this. Literally, he was a mess!\n\nThis book is really an inspiration to those who incur these same problems. It shows that with the will to go on, following the advice of doctors, and most importantly accepting support from significant others, \"True Strength\" emerges. This book is intended to give hope those who have encountered unforeseen ailments and need encouragement to overcome their frailties.\n\nThere is an upbeat conclusion to Kevin's journey as he describes his relationships with his children and the true meaning of family life. This is a four star book which is recommended to everyone.\n\nThe Lola Quartet\n\nEmily St. John Mandel\n\nUnbridled Books\n\n2000 Wadsworth Boulevard, #195\n\nLakewood, CO 80214\n\nwww.unbridledbooks.com\n\n9781609530792, $24.95, www.amazon.com\n\nWonders never cease when it comes to new authors and their writing styles. Emily St. John Mandel falls into this category with \"The Lola Quartet\" because her writing is fresh, clean, and extremely compelling.\n\nOne of the things you discover in this fictional account of one man's life is that as a reader your own high school days come alive. Friends long forgotten, parties, crushes, and of course graduation. Embarking on careers or further educational pursuits take precedence over continuing relationships with those people who were so important while you were taking classes.\n\nEmily has captured the spirit of the past and has mingled it with the present with remarkable precision. Characters ethnicity though never overtly discussed soon emerges that some are black and one is Asian. There is a mixture with a common thread and that is music. \"The Lola Quartet\" is a high school jazz group, which plays for their own enjoyment and that of fellow students. Their last 'concert' takes place in the bed of a pick-up truck when abruptly it ends with the members each going their own way.\n\nFlash forward to 10 years later and one of the members of the original players is no longer engaged in music, but instead is a journalist in New York City, far removed from his old hometown in Florida. His career apparently is solid and he has a bright future until he overtly makes his stories more interesting by creating interviews, which never took place. He is publicly disgraced and fired.\n\nReturning to his hometown Gavin Sasaki moves in with his sister Eilo and becomes employed in real estate. Eilo while handling a real estate foreclosure encounters a girl who is roughly 10 years old who looks like her brother! She takes a picture and shows it to her brother. This is where the happenstances begin as Gavin's quest to find the child who could have been his as her name is Chloe Montgomery. Ten years before his girlfriend Anna Montgomery disappeared and rumors were that she left because she was pregnant.\n\n\"The Lola Quartet\" sounds so far like a soap opera, but there is so much more involved. Gavin meets with one of the old members of the group who is now with the local police department. Detective Daniel continually misdirects Gavin by giving him wrong leads to follow and disguises his relationship with Anna and Chloe. Another member of the group, Jack, lives in a tent and is a failure in every sense of the word in real life.\n\nThroughout all this turmoil, Gavin cannot find his old girl friend and gain knowledge of the truth about his alleged daughter. Mandel has written an excellent imaginative book. This is her third novel, which follows on the heels of her second novel \"The Singers Gun\" that received the Indie Bookseller's Choice Award.\n\nDo not pick this book up and read the first few pages without expecting to spend a few hours getting into the story. This is a four star book which is highly recommended.\n\nThe Chalk Girl\n\nCarol O'Connell\n\nG. P. Putnam's Sons\n\n375 Hudson Street, New York, NY 10014\n\nwww.penguin.com\n\n9780399157745 $25.95, www.amazon.com\n\nNew York Times bestselling fiction writer, Carol O'Connell, is back with her 10th Mallory crime mystery, \"The Chalk Girl.\" This is a psychological thriller guaranteed to keep readers in suspense, when New York City detective Mallory sets out to unravel a complex story, which involves present and past murders seemingly related. Numerous characters emerge, all having their own twisted agendas. This is a tale of cold-blooded murder, revenge, and corruption among the political and social circles.\n\nThis story opens in New York's Central Park where a young redheaded girl, with elfin-like features joins a group of schoolchildren on a school outing. She is out of place. Her clothes are dirty and she had blood splattered on them. She was lost and muttering strange things about \"Uncle Red\" who turned into a tree and rats running all over and falling out of the sky.\n\nThe child had been snatched by pedophile, \"Uncle Red.\" Moreover, she was a witness to this murder in the Ramble area of the park. Authorities found three bodies hanging in the trees, bound and gagged. Coco, the elfin girl, was in danger and thusly secreted in a safe place.\n\nThe investigation takes off with Mallory and her partner detective Riker now looking for a murderer, they called the \"Hunger Artist.\" They believe these murders were connected to a couple of deaths 15 years ago in the Ramble when a wino was beaten to death and a young boy was hung up to die in a tree.\n\nThe detectives had some convoluted issues to solve, as a man, woman, or even a child could have committed these crimes! All records regarding the old cases were mishandled on purpose making the investigation even harder. Old buried secrets, schemes, and many cover-ups made it extremely difficult for the duo detectives generating numerous questions and getting few answers.\n\nMallory and Riker were relentless in their investigation, but they encountered many characters that were insanely keen in their quest to lead them astray. Money, madness, and murder are the plot! Chaos abounds.\n\nMost intriguing was each chapter beginning with a narration of past events slowly revealing what really happened years ago. It is compelling and O'Connell skillfully ties it all together at the conclusion. Hidden secrets explain who are \"The Chalk Girl\" and the narrator in this summation.\n\nYou will not forget this terrific thriller! A must read four-star novel.\n\nClark Issacs\n\nReviewer\n\nCrocco's Bookshelf\n\nClover Adams\n\nHoughton Mifflin Harcourt\n\n215 Park Avenue South, New York, NY 10003\n\nwww.hmhpub.com\n\n9780618873852, $26.00, www.amazon.com\n\nIn \"Clover Adams: A Gilded and Heartbreaking Life by Natalie Dykstra\", biographer Natalie Dykstra writes a well-written detailed biography of Marion (Clover) Adams. She was Henry Adams wife. Henry was President John Adams great-grandson and President John Quincy Adams grandson. The book is an enjoyable read rich in facts about the mysterious life of Clover Adams. The author includes the works of Henry Adams and the history of The Gilded Age.\n\nFor the time period, one would surmise Clover and Henry's marriage and life were appropriate. Both were educated coming from influential families. Although they married later in life than most for the era, they were able to share their love for the good things in life. Both were intelligent and good companions to one another. They never had children.\n\nHowever, as time went on, Clover felt unrest in her life and her marriage. She became desperate in many ways trying to figure out why she was unhappy. Henry was no help, as most men were not nurturing during that time, so Clover felt isolated in her depression. Clover only knew she felt sad, lonely, and unfulfilled. She tried to find something to make her happy and feel worthwhile so she took up photography. This was a double edged sword because it did help Clover feel better; however, it wasn't highly regarded as art. She took many photos and had her ups and downs during this time. She had a complicated family which at times added to her sadness, other times brought her happiness. She had a close relationship with her father. When he died, this was the beginning of the worst depression for Clover. She truly did not recover from his loss.\n\nSo while Clover was suffering, Henry was also depressed. At the same time she was losing members of her family and it all became too much for Clover. She committed suicide on December 6, 1885. She was 42 years old. What gave her hope was what ended up killing her. She drank the chemicals she used to develop her photographs.\n\nNatalie Dykstra suggests the answers to why Clover took her life may be seen in her photographs. Natalie's extensive research includes Clover's notebook, letters, and family papers. From this research Natalie was able to describe to her readers Clover's daily life, her thoughts and feelings. It describes life in the 19th century.\n\nThe book contains 31 extraordinary photos. One is a photo of an untitled bronze statue named, \"Grief\" that marks the graves of Clover and Henry. It is located in Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington, D.C. It's sad, but people only know she was the wife of Henry Adams and that she killed herself.\n\nThanks to Natalie Dykstra, we know there was much more to Clover Adams\n\nA Song For My Mother\n\nKat Martin\n\nVanguard Press\n\nc/o Perseus Books Group\n\n11 Cambridge Center, Cambridge, MA 02142\n\nwww.vanguardpressbooks.com\n\n9781593156565, 14.99, www.amazon.com\n\nWhile picking up my books on hold at the library, A Song For My Mother was being displayed on a shelf above my books. It's a small book so I picked it up and read the book flap. Since it was a very short story I figured why not. It's not one I would have read if not for being displayed, so I took it home. I try to expand the genres I read.\n\nhe story was about a mother's love for her children. The mother in the story gets a chance to explain to her grown daughter why she made the choices she made when her daughter was young.\n\nAfter 12 years of not seeing or talking to her mom, and after hearing the reason why her mother made the choices she did, the daughter forgave her and everyone lived happily ever after.\n\nI assume readers finished the story feeling good that all is forgiven and a good life was lived by all. I did not have this feeling. I think the mother made the wrong choices. I'm not even sure I would forgive the mother. I understand her daughter's reason for leaving home and not communicating with her mother for 12 years.\n\nHowever, the story itself was touching and the characters fit the story. But to me it lacked substance so I looked at it from a different perspective as I always try to bring something positive from a book I didn't really enjoy. What I realized was Kat Martin's dialogue sounded effortless and spontaneous. It was literary genius.\n\nAs any aspiring writer does, I read to improve my writing skills. A Song For My Mother is a great book to improve writing dialogue. It's the perfect model to emulate.\n\nA writer may take classes, purchase writing books, and write daily to improve. I learn better reading books by authors who have mastered writing dialogue, along with taking classes, purchasing writing books, and writing daily!\n\nI recommend A Song For My Mother for readers who enjoy romance novels and feel good stories that have happy endings.\n\nFor aspiring writers, I recommend A Song For My Mother for its outstanding dialogue!\n\nMary Crocco, Reviewer\n\nmrcrocco.wordpress.com\n\nDaniel's Bookshelf\n\nKill Me If You Can\n\nJames Patterson & Marshall Karp\n\nGrand Central Publishing\n\nc/o Hachette Book Group\n\n237 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10017\n\n9780446571876 $14.99, www.grandcentralpublishing.com\n\nI mentioned before, I see James Patterson has so many different characters in his books which tell a story in sequel form or just stand alones. His book here is simply story telling and fast pace. I read his books when traveling, and I like them. I have spare time in between more intricate novels, that are more descriptive and detailed. I picked this book for that reason never knowing what to expect. He points out the other books he writes for are primarily for kids and the others are definitely adult ones.\n\nMatthew Bannon, who is a poor art student finds himself in a strange situation, trailing a violent killing of a man in the New York Grand Station. He discovers the man was dead from a gaping wound in his neck near a locker, and he finds a black leather bag full of small diamonds. He manages to get out of there in all the confusion of the chaotic attack between one man, and the one he finds dead by the locker. Two grenades are thrown with extremely loud explosions in a enclosed space, and the red smoke terrifies all in this enclosed space for a hundred feet. People running for their lives and the police called for evacuation. Matthew takes a cab claiming to be a doctor to vanish from the scene. Later on he envisions a worry free life with money with his new found girlfriend, Katherine Sanborne. However, he realizes his fate didn't go undiscovered by the owners of the diamonds. They won't stop until they reclaim them, and they want to give him their maximum revenge for his theft.\n\nNow the Russian syndicate is pressing the middleman for the diamonds, so their fate won't be without a deadly cost. So Vadim Chukov hires two different assassins to pursue Matthew, and he even offers a hefty price if one of them kills the other. This one is known as the Ghost who was one of the killers at the Grand Station. He was the one who killed the man Matthew had found near the locker. Walter Zelvas was an enforcer, who had outlived his usefulness for the international diamond syndicate. He became a victim of the Ghost in this high profile hit. Now the Ghost is supposedly on Bannon's trail along with the other assassin Chukov hired named Marta Krall. She not only gets this pursuit, but loves to torture her assignments along with accomplishing her mission. Bannon is on the run from both in his international travel for pleasure to enjoy the new found diamonds. He eventually find out the trip is going to be a wild adventure of the hunted pursued by those who are sent to get the diamonds. The premise of kill me if you can in this high octane thriller, is that the art student and his girlfriend will find out there will be no peace until the pursuers are eliminated.\n\nJames Patterson has sold the most book according to Guinness Records and has the most best sellers on the book trade. He is the most popular thriller writer today and he has three or four novels still to be released this year. Guilty Wives, 11th Hour, I, Michael Bennett, Confessions of a Murder Suspect, and Free Alex Cross are slated for March, May, July, September and October of 2012. My wife and I have plenty of Patterson novels to read along with many other books.\n\nKill Alex Cross\n\nJames Patterson\n\nLittle, Brown and Company\n\nc/o Hachette Book Group\n\n237 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10017\n\n9780316198738 $28.99, www.littlebrownandcompany.com\n\nI enjoy reading fast paced novels which are page turners. This novel is no exception with an interesting plot after reading the flap inside the jacket. I fluctuate between Michael Bennett and Alex Cross along with some of his stand alone thriller novels. I didn't hesitate to scoop up this copy at a library fund raiser, and I wasn't disappointed.\n\nAlex Cross is now faced with a huge political high profile problem, which he is partially involved in through a high speed chase on the Washington D. C. streets. It finds out that the crime victims U. S. President Coyle's son and daughter. The FBI take jurisdiction of the case and leave a bare offering to keep Cross a tidbit into the situation where information trickles down to him. He does what he can do on what hand the FBI leave him. It is learned that the real target of the kidnapped President's son and daughter is of a wider scope. The threats are discovered in the investigation by the team to include the assassinations of the entire succession up to the presidency.\n\nThe President's wife takes note of Cross in past endeavors of hostage situations, and she wants him included in the loop. While the search continues to seek and learn where the President's kids are hidden or if still alive, the terrorist threaten the water supply with a deadly contagion. The President's wife again pleads for Alex to find her children, and he has to make stressful decisions to find the kidnapper, and do battle with terrorist forces. Even with all his security clearances and assistance, his efforts seem to leave him with an impossible task. His last straw decision of desperation pits him to do something that is against everything he believes. The outcome for success is that important and needed in a time with so much at stake.\n\nJames Patterson releases plenty of novels using his different main characters every year, and has the most sales in the thriller genre to-date. His gross sales top the Guinness Records according to them. His next novel covering Alex Cross is Free Alex Cross due to be released in October 2012. After this novel, I will be looking forward to it.\n\nDaniel Allen\n\nReviewer\n\nGary's Bookshelf\n\nTerrified\n\nKevin O'Brien\n\nKensington Publishing Corp\n\n119 West 40th Street, New York, NY 10018\n\nwww.kensingtonbooks.com\n\n9780786021383, $9.99, www.amazon.com\n\nKevin O'Brien shows why he is at the top of the list of writers in the field of suspenseful tales with his newest novel, \"Terrified.\" Megan Keeler appeared to have died years ago and her husband was charged with her murder.

One of the tricks is to tell a story in as few words as possible but the author also has the same responsibility to readers to have a beginning, middle and an end that it has all led up to. \"Twisted Tales\" did so in only 66 words \"Flash Fiction\" doesn't because he is just using words and no real focal point.

He also shows how Kenny Baker who was R2D2 and he have a lot in common. \"My Favorite Giant\" has many positive lessons for all of us to learn to be more tolerant of anyone who is different. \"My Favorite Giant\" and \"Growing up Giant\" in their new editions have a much flashier look to them that adds to the enjoyment of both by two wonderful authors of children's books.\n\nWhirlwind\n\nJennifer R. Resetar\n\nIFWG Publishing\n\nhttp://ifwgpublishing.com\n\n9780615561219, $7.95, www.amazon.com\n\n\"Whirlwind\" begins with third grader Alex Johnson walking a short distance to school. Despite having a disability of cerebral palsy he does not let it get him down. Shortly into his walk he is approached by someone who calls his name even though Alex doesn't know him. Alex is told he is a super hero even though he has his disability. He is given a costume and will be known as Whirlwind, who will help others in their time of need. The story is interesting while showing that people with disabilities are the same as anyone else in the world, just a little different It also deals with how vicious others can be to each other and how intolerance is dealt with. \"Whirlwind\" is a great first of a series of kid's books that has interesting characters and many positive lessons to learn.\n\nBaseball Is This The Game Your Fathers Watched?\n\nJim Forbes\n\nLegacy Publishing Services Inc\n\n1883 Lee Road, Winter Park, Florida 32789\n\nwww.LegacyBookPublishing.com\n\n9781934449974, $16.95, www.amazon.com\n\nAnother baseball season is upon us and \"Baseball Is This The Game Your fathers Watched?\" is perfectly timed for any follower of the game.

Mental\n\nNeil McMahon\n\nHarper\n\nc/o HarperCollins\n\n10 E. 53rd St., NY, NY 10022\n\n9780061340789 $24.99, www.harpercollins.com\n\nIs there something in the air in LA? [Other than the usual, that is.] For something is suddenly causing unusual, and unusually aggressive, behavior, much of it lethal. Neil McMahon's new novel starts with three LA Times headlines, each a month apart: \"Bizarre Rampage Leaves Judge in Critical Condition;\" \"Accused Celeb Heiress in Pool Accident;\" and \"CalTech Tragedy Saddens, Disturbs,\" this last after a graduate student runs onto a freeway and is struck by more than one vehicle and killed. It appears that nearly 40 such incidents had been reported over the past year, with many more not having made the papers or other media. But when psychologist Tom Crandall's brother jumps from a Malibu cliff, although he survives the fall, things obviously become much more personal; Tom has to try to find out what is going on.\n\nA faculty adjunct at a two-year community college, Tom is one of four siblings, all in their thirties, from a prominent and wealthy family, one that could be described as dysfunctional at best. He soon discovers that another brother, Paul, is financing a movie being made by a brilliant, albeit bizarre, Swedish physicist. That film is described as \"a curious blend of elements, some traditional but modernized, and given a gloss of science that walked the edge of science fiction.\" That same description could be applied to this novel. Paul has rented out a family property for the making of the film, and when Tom visits the scene he, as the reader, is unprepared for what he finds there.\n\nFull disclosure here: otherworldly, or even semi-otherworldly, doings are generally outside my comfort zone, my suspension of disbelief too greatly taxed thereby. And my mental abilities [no pun on the title intended] do not stretch to the worlds of physics, astrophysics, nanotechnology, or even science fiction. Admittedly I expected the plot triggers here to be off-putting. But I hasten to add that they were not, and I found myself intrigued, and challenged, by what the author has done here. It is an interesting, at times fascinating, and suspense-filled, tale, and one I recommend.\n\nFourth Day\n\nZoe Sharp\n\nPegasus Books\n\n80 Broad St., NY, NY 10005\n\n9781605982755 $14.95, www.pegasusbooks.us\n\nFourth Day is the name of a once subversive organization formed in the 1960's and known for its cult-like origins, but claiming to work wonders especially with vulnerable adolescents [and others] with delinquency and drug addiction problems. It has more recently been headed by one Randall Bane, its new and charismatic leader suspected of having more sinister ambitions.\n\nThis newest in the series brings back Charlotte (\"Charlie\") Fox and her lover, Sean Meyer, a junior partner in Armstrong-Meyer, a \"close-protection\" [read \"bodyguard\"] organization, now tasked with retrieving a man who has been living within Fourth Day's grounds on its large real-estate holdings in Southern California. Their 'target,' Thomas Witney, had initially infiltrated the organization five years prior to get proof that Fourth Day was responsible for the death of his son, but for some reason never left. There is some question as to whether or not he will come willingly, but they are told that that is not to be an obstacle. When things go awry, Charlie volunteers to herself infiltrate the organization, with appropriate back-up. What she finds is unexpected, to Charlie and the reader.\n\nThis is a fast-paced and suspenseful novel, as Charlie, now 29 years old, is going through some difficult times, personally and professionally. She is nonetheless at the top of her game, and that is very good indeed. The plot races through to a stunning conclusion, which left me more anxious than ever to read the next installment in the series. Highly recommended. [The title, by the way, is a Biblical reference - Genesis to be precise - as well as having a double meaning in the final pages.]\n\nWild Thing\n\nJosh Bazell\n\nReagan Arthur Books\n\nc/o Hachette Book Group\n\n237 Park Ave., NY, NY 10017\n\n9780316032193 $25.99, www.HachetteBookGroup.com\n\nDr. Peter Brown, ne Pietro Brnwa [pronounced \"Browna\"], has become a doctor thanks to the Witness Protection Program in which he was placed several years before the story opens. [His nickname, \"Bearclaw,\" has its own backstory, at which one could never even begin to guess.] Pietro bears rather unusual tattoos, at least in combination: a snake staff on one shoulder, a Star of David on the other. I hasten to add that these are the words with which I opened my review of \"Beat the Reaper,\" the first, wonderful novel by Josh Bazell which introduced this most unique protagonist; there is little reference to his background in this, the second entry in the series, other than the fact that he was a hired killer who had murdered an impressive number of victims before and is still trying by any means to elude the attempts of his former employers to kill him. As the book opens, his present means of accomplishing this finds him working as a doctor on a cruise ship [not nearly as impressive or desirable a job as it might at first seem].\n\nWhen he is offered a substantial sum of money by a 'reclusive billionaire' to accompany, and safeguard, a gorgeous paleontologist on a trip into the Minnesota woods [and waters] to prove, or disprove, an urban legend, he quickly accepts. Whether or not the whole thing is a hoax - - well, there are several theories put forth, that being only one of them. Basically signing on for a twelve-day canoe trip, the various invited members of the group are seeking to find out if there is actually, as rumored, a Minnesota version of the Loch Ness monster, paying very handsomely for the privilege. This is a whacky, and very funny, tale and, be warned, if profanity disturbs you, this is not the book for you.\n\nNominally the plot is about the protagonist's attempt to somehow buy his way out of a mafia vendetta. The book is replete with footnotes, informative and often hilarious. The author concludes with a section titled \"Sources,\" about forty pages long, which perhaps gives a hint of what has preceded it, and is alone worth the price of the book, material referencing, e.g., critical events from the Reagan and Carter years, and outgrowths thereof, as well as those of the current President of the US; Dick Cheney's \"hunting\" incident; discussions of contemporaneous medical/health care issues, including meds prescribed for PTSD and other mental health disorders; corruption among politicians in all levels of government; decisions from the recent past by the US Supreme Court; environmental issues; many of these possibly polarizing but brilliantly set forth, which also describes the book as a whole. One thing is for certain: Very funny and profane as it might be, this is a book that is difficult to describe, but one that will make you laugh, and make you think, and it is recommended.\n\nEdge of Dark Water\n\nJoe R. Landsale\n\nMulholland Books\n\nc/o Hachette Book Group\n\n237 Park Ave., NY, NY 10017\n\n9780316188432 $25.99, www.mulhollandbooks.com\n\nThe reader is introduced to sixteen-year-old Sue Ellen and her family on the no-nonsense first page, when Daddy is 'fishing' - a chore that combines 'telephoning,' i.e., \"cranking that telephone to hot up the wire that went into the water to 'lectrocute the fish,' dynamiting them, and poisoning them with green walnuts. I might add, as does the author, that the dynamiting doesn't always work too well, as he attempted it one time when he was so drunk that some of his fingers got blown off.\n\nBy page eight, Sue Ellen, Daddy and her Uncle Gene, finishing up the fishing project, discover the body of her friend, May Lynn Baxter, at the bottom of the lake"
