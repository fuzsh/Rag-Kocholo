        "text": "In recent years Kremlin officials have frequently accused the West of conducting an \" information war \" against Russia. This paper engages with this topic in a novel way by applying the concept of anti-branding. In this context, anti-branding refers to a deliberate campaign by a state actor to tarnish the international image of a rival, thereby undermining that country's soft power. To understand whether Russia has indeed been subjected to such an operation, this study addresses the case study of the Sochi Olympics of 2014. Specifically, it asks whether Western media reporting of the Sochi Games was unjustifiably critical and whether there is any evidence of government orchestration. It provides answers by means of extensive content analysis of US media and public statements by US officials. In so doing, this paper provides an initial test of a new intellectual model of media analysis that has particular application to Russia.\n\nThe nature of the work-in-progress on Pierre de Coubertin’s intellectual writings, as emphasized by Norbert Müller in the epigraph of this essay, is today a challenge to his interpreters and critics. However, the multiple visions and the non-argumentative style of Coubertin’s writings were not so often regarded in the Baron’s texts on art and aesthetics in addition to what he eventually called “general culture”, which included sport. In my view, the interconnected conception of art-aesthetics-culture explicitly assumed by Coubertin was concerned to fixed external theories apart from his typical eclectic and continuous re-elaborations in terms of explanations and proposals.\n\nThe nature of the work-in-progress on Pierre de Coubertin’s intellectual writings, as emphasized by Norbert Müller in the epigraph of this essay, is today a challenge to his interpreters and critics.

From 2000 to 2006 various Australian cities have hosted or will host a variety of mega sporting events: the Olympic and Paralympic Games (Sydney, 2000), the Goodwill Games (Brisbane, 2001), the Gay Games (Sydney, 2002), the Rugby World Cup (Sydney, 2003), the Commonwealth Games (Melbourne, 2006). These events built on a long Australian tradition of hosting mega events particularly sporting ones. The list includes the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games, the 1938, 1962 and 1982 Commonwealth Games in Sydney, Perth and Brisbane respectively and the Brisbane World Expo of 1988. Australian cities compete with each other and with overseas cities to win bids for mega sporting events. No less than five cities — Adelaide, Brisbane, Darwin, Melbourne and Perth — expressed some interest in hosting the 2006 Commonwealth Games for instance, before Melbourne was chosen as the Australian candidate city. Melbourne then secured the right to host the Games after the only other contender, the New Zealand city of Wellington, withdrew its bid. This article examines three recent, and one future, mega sporting events in Australia: the Olympic Games, the Paralympic Games, the Gay Games and the Commonwealth Games. The four events are quite different in scale, status and international media coverage: the Olympic Games are at the pinnacle of world sporting festivals whereas the other three events have lesser status. The Paralympic Games have a strong emotional resonance but a relatively small commercial base. The Commonwealth Games and the Gay Games have lesser global outreach.\n\nThe classical formulations of Olympic ideology a century ago were founded in the worldview of modernism and its belief in rational, scientific progress. Current postmodern conditions and worldviews conflict with that original ideology and suggest a unity in the otherwise disparate aspects of change and conflict in the Olympic movement. The shift from aristocratic to commercial support, from upper-class to diverse participation, and from male European and American domination to female and global involvement all indicate diversification of the Olympics. Simultaneously, the huge growth of media technology and television rights fees have changed the Olympics. Conceptualizing the Olympics and these changes as postrnodem clarifies the relationship between the Olympics and broader sociocultural change; it also suggests new challenges for Olympic ideology."
