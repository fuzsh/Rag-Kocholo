        "text": "17 May - James Robert Hayes, husband to Chinese actress Ma Yashu, has denied rumours saying that he was once prosecuted for domestic violence.\n\nAs reported on Tencent, previously, a tabloid claimed that Hayes was abusive towards his ex-wife, and that he was previously prosecuted for his crime in the United States.\n\nIn a statement he released online on 15 May, Hayes clarified the rumours about him, saying that it was fake and that he has no family history of domestic violence.\n\n\"I have researched the source of this fake news, and from what I found, it came from a court record that has nothing to do with me,\" he said.\n\nHayes explained that the previous article quoted a court record from the state of Maine, USA, which he has never been to with his ex-wife. He also shared that the name of the spouse in the court record is different from the former Mrs. Hayes.\n\nHe stated that although the name of the husband in the record is similar, it is not his full name - adding that a court record would certainly include his full name if it's true he was the one involved in the case.\n\n\"Finally, the time recorded in the file was during the time my ex-wife was living in Germany while I have started living in Beijing - we would have been thousands of kilometres apart,\" he added.\n\nHayes blasted the responsible parties for releasing such a malicious slander.\n\nHe ended the post by saying, \"I talked to my ex-wife about this fake news, and she thought that the rumours were ridiculous and sad. So please, everyone. Enough with this rumour. Thank you for listening to me. Thank you for your trust in me. I wish everyone a peaceful life.\"\n\nCurrent wife Ma Yashu also shared the post online and write, \"I am rest assured by this blog post.\"\n\nHayes and Ma tied the knot in 2010, a year after the actress ended her marriage with actor Nicky Wu.\n\n(Photo source: mtime.cn)"
