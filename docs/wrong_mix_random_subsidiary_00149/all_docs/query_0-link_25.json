        "text": "Calabrino’s Case\n\nBy Richard P. Mroz\n\nThere are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.\n\n-Hamlet (1.5.167-8), Hamlet to Horatio\n\nWhen things appear hopeless and lost, look up, there will be a Greek pointing the way.\n\n-Historical wisdom\n\nChapter One\n\nThe Seas off Jamaica, 1719\n\nCaptain John Murdoch, sailing out of Kingston, Jamaica viewed the black flag with raised white arm insignia fluttering frantically against the blue Caribbean sky. Pirates! He slowly lowered the brass trimmed telescope to his side. The renegade sloop was under full sail, and approaching rapidly. Soon a shot would be fired across the bow signaling for him to stop or be fired upon. His small merchant was no match in speed or manpower for what was so dreadfully nearing. Pirate temperaments were notoriously fickle, but Captain Murdoch had to make a decision for his ship and those aboard. If the pirate was Calico Jack Rackham it would be just for the plunder. There, of course, would be the roughing up of the crew, damage, and had there been female passengers, rape. Any resistance would be met with death either mercifully quickly or any number of cruel slow tortures at the whim of the crew.\n\nCaptain Murdoch signaled the first mate to dip the colors as a sign that he would yield just as the water directly ahead exploded into a fountain. Without delay, the next order was to reef the sails. Soon the ship would be becalmed in an azure blue ocean, its only motion an undulation. He would risk exposing his neck to the attacker in hopes of mercy. It often worked with wild animals, but with man the instinct is not as strong as greed.\n\n“No resistance, d’ye hear me?”\n\nThe pirate ship was now close enough to read the name Providence printed in deep red on the hull. It was indeed Calico Jack’s ship. There was some hope for his crew.\n\n“No resistance, d’ye hear me?” The captain’s strong brogue rang out. “None or it’ll be your hide for sure, and maybe all our lives.” Murdoch spoke sternly to his crew and two passengers. “That there’s Calico Jack. He’ll be agiven us our lives for our valuables. No fight lads. Giv’em what he wants, and if we be lucky, we’ll be sailing back to Kingston a bit poorer, but with our skins.”\n\nThe men sullenly nodded their assent, but fear and resignation were obvious in the gritting of teeth, the deep sighs, the clenching of fists, and the stares that silently spoke of their wondering if they would live through what was about to happen.\n\nAs the Providence came about, Captain Murdoch noticed the slovenly crew in motley clothes, the ill-managed ship with debris on deck, and the hull that was filthy with green algae. Half-naked men leered into Murdoch’s ship, the Lady Valerie, greedily searching for females, rum and riches. Most carried a weapon: axe, dagger, or sword; a few had pistols; all of them needed a bath. The stench from the Providence seared the air with a nauseous, acidic odor of rancid bodies. Not even the gentle waft of tropical air could erase the foulness of the beast of prey.\n\nA sudden bump caused Captain Murdoch to lurch forward. The ships had touched. The pirates, spitting and cursing, came aboard like a squall pushing down any sailor who stood in their rush of lust. The Lady Valerie’s crew stood silently by, watching their ship that once was so tidily maintained, gets ransacked. A few of the pirates egged on some of the other crew trying to provoke a fight. Hoping for a kill, the mangy men of the Providence called the somber men cowards, women, and little boys.\n\nA bellowing voice from the pirate ship nearly stopped the increasing chaos. “No killing if there be no resistance. Ye hear? No killing!” It was Calico Jack at the stern of his vessel. He moved adroitly with his first mate at his side to the gunwales. As he\n\n“The first mate was… petite.”\n\nboarded the Lady Valerie, he glared about the maelstrom before him. “Where be the captain of this vessel?”\n\nNo one responded. Captain Murdoch, large of frame and slow of speech, finally spoke. “T’is me, Calico Jack. Captain John Murdoch out of Kingston, and I’ve told my crew not to resist. There’s not much of a manifest, but for it I ask ye to spare the lives of them aboard.”\n\nCalico nodded. “That be a fair bargain, but if any of your crew wishes to join us, he’ll be welcome.” He turned from the Captain, yelling out, “No killing on this here vessel unless I, Calico Jack, says so. Now lads, take what you wants and let’s be off afore some young sprat of King George decides to get heroic.” Laughter and the discord of rummaging filled the air.\n\nThe first mate of the Providence, petite for a pirate, walked past Murdoch, an axe at his side, a pistol in his hand. Captain Murdoch’s eyes followed the first mate as the pirate went to the door leading below, and to the sounds of glass being broken and hearty laughter.\n\nCalico noticed Murdoch’s attention. “Do you know the lad?”\n\n“Put down the axe.”\n\n“No. I was just thinking that your first mate looks mighty gentle for his profession, but I guess it don’t take much to pull a trigger.” Murdoch turned back to Calico, his face stern and resigned.\n\nCalico smiled. “That there mate’s not at all what ye think, Captain Murdoch, not at all.”\n\nBelow, one of the passengers tried to lock the door to his cabin, but two of the larger pirates broke it down driving the man to his cot as he clutched a small leather satchel.\n\n“No. Prende prego l’oro nel sachetto!” He spoke Italian pleading with them to take the gold he waved in front of them.\n\nThe two pirates were at first confused since neither one could speak Italian. One raised an axe. The man cringed still clutching his leather case. “Per l’amore del dio, non questo!” Tears rolled down his cheeks.\n\nThe first mate entered the room. “Put down the axe, Quince!” A high pitched voice pierced the chamber.\n\n“But he’s resistin.” The large pirate turned to the first mate protesting the order, “and Cap’n Calico says that…”\n\nThe first mate moved closer aiming his pistol at Quince’s head. “And I say put it down.”\n\nThe pirate backed away with caution as he wiped the drool from his mouth with the back of his hand. With a scowl on his grizzled face his blood-shot eyes viewed the mate with distain.\n\nThe first mate stepped forward to the Italian. “Give me that or Quince here will have your heart for supper.” He reached for the case.\n\n“Lascario solo. Non ho fatto niente a voi. Il contenuto di questo caso e piu prezioso dell’oro.” He tried to reason with his captors but no one understood him.\n\nAs the first mate reached for the satchel, the Italian, in an act of desperation, pushed against the chest of the invader with his right hand as his left pulled the case away. His hand slipped and slid past the chest, opening the shirt. His hand rested on the right breast of a female. His eyes, now wide in shock, moved from the breast to the mate’s eyes. The first mate was a woman. He gasped in disbelief.\n\n“Il mio dio. Che cosa e questo? Una donna! Misericordia, pirate della signoria! Poiche siete stati transforati da un uomo ad una donna, faccio transformare qualecosa in qui quella latti tutto. Riparmiarlo!” He tried to tell her of the contents and to spare his life as he pulled his hand away.\n\nThe first mate stunned by the bold move of the Italian leapt back in anger and instinctually she fired her pistol directly into his face. Blood splattered the wall, the bed, and their clothes.\n\nQuince hardly blinked at the scene. “So much for that, ye diego bastard. Now what’s in that case?” He grabbed the satchel and with a quick move of his dagger slit the handles, spilling the contents on the bed. The dead body of the Italian quivered once as Quince shoved it from the bed to the floor with his foot. “Nothin here but\n\n“Ye were… some quaen?”\n\nwritin.” He smiled sardonically. “He died for nothing but writin.” He laughed as he looked at the contents on the cot: a pair of reading glasses, a small cube of something soft, a few farthings worth practically nothing, a small container of dark powder, and a copper bound book written in a language unknown to him.\n\n“Nothin but writin and some powder for the face.” Quince kicked the dead body on the floor. “Ye were probably some quaen.” The pirate had no time for dead queers. He strode out of the room in search of serious plunder. The other pirate followed. The female looked about the room at the person she had killed, then scooped up the contents on the cot and placed them back in the satchel. “Why would a man die for such trivia?” thought the pirate. She saw a name embossed on the case: Senore Guiseppe Calabrino.\n\nNews of the killing reached Captain Murdoch almost instantly. He stared at Calico wondering if this might be the beginning of a massacre. “Captain Calico, you promised…” He began to protest.\n\nCalico waved him down, then shouted, “Quiet!” He fired his pistol into the air to get everyone’s attention. The action slowed then stopped as all looked to Calico. “No killing. That be a mortal order. So help me on your life, no more killing.” He looked around for the first mate for an explanation. “Now get your stuff aboard quickly, mates, or stay with the Lady Valerie. Any of ye who wishes an adventurous life with the Providence is welcome.” The action exploded into a frenzied seizure of anything movable.\n\n“What happened?” Calico motioned for his first mate to come to him.\n\nThe first mate silently walked past the two captains carrying the leather case. Once aboard the Providence she turned. “Do it to your sister, Calico. I did what I had to do, and I answer to no man for my actions, not even you. Piss!”\n\nCalico turned from her in anger, raised his other pistol into the air and fired. “Now get back to the Providence. I’ll be leaving now.”\n\nAs his men rapidly scurried aboard, Calico turned to the other captain. “I’m sorry, Captain Murdoch, about the killing. Ye know I don’t operate like that. They’ll be no more. Now take your ship back to Kingston and be thankful it was Calico ye met and not Vance.” Calico referred to Captain Charles Vance notorious for cutting out the hearts of men while they lived and feeding it to the members of the captured crew. With that, he turned and jumped nimbly back to his own ship.\n\n“Before ye leave, Captain,” Murdoch called out, “Who is that lad ye have as first?”\n\n“She’s no lad, Captain, but a lass.” Calico smiled devilishly.\n\nThe female stepped forward to the gunwale of the departing ship and exposed her breasts to the captain as well as the two crews. “The name’s Bonny, Anne Bonny. Don’t be forgettin it, Captain Murdoch. I’m the one who did the killing. Anne Bonny.” She covered her breasts and slowly turned away.\n\nThe two ships slowly moved apart. On the Providence there was singing, laughing, and a din of noise; aboard the Lady Valerie only stunned silence, relief, and a dead body. A warm breeze from the south caught the sails, and the stench of the Providence began to fade. Little did Captain Murdoch know that within the year Calico Jack, Anne Bonny and the crew of the Providence would stand trial in Kingston. All would be found guilty; all would hang except Anne.\n\nChapter Two The Opening\n\nRichard Morel paced slowly, patiently, and methodically between the front door of his herb shop on Shakespeare Street to a place where a hole had been made in what was once the wall between his residence-business and his newly acquired house next door. He waited for either the answering machine to click on or for his friend, Herman Praaze to pick up the phone. The workman, who had made the hole, rested against the wall in the middle of the plaster, drinking some coffee. He also waited to see if he would continue with the job or call it quits.\n\nMorel was a man of proper attire and guarded expression. Many had used the word ‘natty’ to describe him. He was a licensed acupuncturist, a qualified herbalist, and he liked his life simple – without the so-called benefits of wife and children. His was an orderly existence with morning walks along the harbor, afternoon tea, and evening concerts. It was his hope that in addition to his herb business, he could open a genuine tea shop with a choice of crumpets and various blends of exotic teas.\n\nShakespeare Street was one of the oldest streets in the oldest section of Baltimore known as Fells Point. Richard Morel’s house, built in 1700, was one of the oldest in Fells Point. To do any renovations required a painstaking procedure of getting the permission of three civic groups: the Maryland Historical Fellowship, the Preservation Group of Fell’s Prospect, and the East City Cooperative. After six months of discussions, assurances, and paperwork, all three had given permission for him to construct a doorway of no more than twenty-seven inches into the house next door, a house Richard had bought nearly a year previously wanting to fulfill his dreams. Everything had gone well until, in the midst of clearing the opening, which entailed dislodging the plaster, then removing each brick separately to be stored for possible sale to antiquarians, they discovered something in the wall. It was so placed and so imbedded in the mortar that its removal would involve making the opening sizably larger than the allowance of twenty-seven inches. Richard’s friend Herman was an architect. He would know what to do.\n\n“How in the deuce…it was me?”\n\n“Hello, Richard, it’s been some time since we talked.” Herman’s soft, mellow voice answered.\n\nMorel hesitated a moment. “How in the deuce did you know it was me? I could just as easily have been one of those cheeky sales people.”\n\n“I saw your name on the phone. Really, Richard, you need to enter the twenty-first century.” Herman sounded sarcastic.\n\n“Oh, I hadn’t thought of that.” Morel had the makings of a modern day Medievalist.\n\n“Well, Richard, it’s your call. I hope that nothing’s wrong.” Herman ignored Morel’s distain for pushy technology.\n\n“No, why do you ask?”\n\n“It wouldn’t happen to be anything to do with the doorway you’re building, would it? Twenty-seven inches is far too small for a gracious entrance. I would have insisted on at least thirty-two, and if they had declined, I say to heck with their petty rules. The house is yours.” The voice was firm and steady.\n\nMorel was flabbergasted. “But, how could you have known anything about this doorway and… I just now…” He stopped. “And, besides I don’t like scofflaws and that sort of…” He stopped again. “Be that as it may, when… er …I mean, I’d like for you to see the situation for yourself. That is if you don’t mind.”\n\n“I might just do that, Richard. I could see that you have probably found something in the wall.” Praaze kept his tone soft.\n\n“Herman,” Morel’s inflection rose to a higher tone as he tensed, “I know you’re clever, but honestly, how could you know about this problem?” Morel glanced at the hole then at the worker he was paying forty dollars an hour.\n\n“Take it easy, Richard. First of all I read in the paper that you had applied to do alterations to a house on Shakespeare that I knew you had bought about a year ago. The city is required to post notices like that. I also noticed the same type of renovation on your own domicile: a doorway. I called the Preservation Group and discovered that they grant permits for twenty-seven to thirty-two inches as a doorway. Knowing that you would not press for the larger number because it might seem confrontational, I assumed you’d accepted the lower figure. Now you suddenly call after several months silence. Why would my friend call me to do a simple doorway? There is no need of my skills unless you need something special – say an architectural loophole around the by-law, since you are not the sort to break the wall and break the law. I asked myself what could possibly be the problem. Since the wall was built in 1701, there would be no difficulties with pipes, wires or, for that matter, any serious structural impediments. What could I possibly assume but that you have inadvertently found something in the wall that you wish removed without violating some arbitrary figure foisted upon you by some quasi-legal bureaucracy. How am I doing?” Herman inhaled sharply through his nostrils making a wheezing noise.\n\nSilence.\n\n“Morel, are you there?” Herman questioned.\n\n“Yes, of course I’m here. You seem to have grasped the situation as usual, and with your logic, it all seems so simple now.” Morel sighed. “How soon can you get here?”\n\n“Don’t dismiss the worker. Perhaps in a half-hour,” Herman assured him.\n\n“Oh, for Pete’s sake, how did…?” Morel sounded frustrated.\n\n“Easy, Richard. You wouldn’t do the work yourself and I know you wouldn’t pay for two when you could get away with paying for one. See you soon, my friend, and could you make some tea for me?” Herman loved Earl Grey.\n\n“That is no problem.” Morel had a note of hope and cheer in his voice.\n\nChapter Three\n\nThe Contents\n\nHerman pulled into tiny Shakespeare Street with his wife Diane’s new Saab. His wife did not want him driving into the city with it but Herman’s car, the old Jaguar, was once again in the shop. Parking as usual would be a problem. A Buick station wagon, with the name ‘Lazerro Renovates’ on the door, was parked on Dallas Street in front of Morel’s corner store. Just as Herman made the turn onto Dallas, his friend stepped from his entrance waving for him to stop.\n\n“Herman, wait here. Mark, the carpenter, will move his car.” Morel motioned toward a thin man of thirty dressed in denim overalls. “He knows a place on Lancaster where he can park.” Richard stood next to the Saab and commented to Herman that the cavalry had arrived as Mark slowly drove off in the Buick.\n\nHerman smiled at his remark then cautiously pulled into the space. It would not fare well to scratch Diane’s pride and joy. Getting out of the car, Herman stretched noting the heavy gray clouds that threatened some precipitation. There was a coolness in the air that smelled of snow, but this was March and the forsythia had already shown its green and yellow melancholy: it would be an early spring. Aches ran up his back and to his side. Back problems: always back problems. Since turning sixty-two, he experienced more pains, and his six-foot frame had developed a slight paunch. His normally thin black hair was thinner and grayer. Herman’s squared jaw reflected his mother’s Slavic background, but his angular nose and gray eyes were his father’s Dutch ancestry. The name Praaze was of unknown origin. In recent times he had acquired a slight cough to clear his throat, and Herman walked a little slower.\n\n“The name… is of unknown origin.”\n\nMorel, who even on the warmest day wore a tie, greeted his friend with a smile. “Glad to see you again, Herman.” He extended his hand to shake. Morel took note of the changes in Herman, thinking that perhaps it was time for some herbs and some needle therapy.\n\nPraaze also took note of Morel’s slight limp, his newly grown thin mustache, and that his friend had taken to combing his hair in a pompadour. Two small indentions on the upper nostril spoke of glasses. “And the limp?” Herman nodded to Morel’s leg as they shook hands.\n\n“The smell of old dust…”\n\n“Oh that. Nothing but age I suppose, but that is not my problem.” Morel released Praaze’s hand as he motioned for him to enter his shop. Morel had moved his herbs to one side and the acupuncture table was folded in a corner to make room for the renovations. The smell of old dust permeated the place. Praaze could not suppress a cough.\n\n“That’s new, isn’t it?” Morel was concerned being sure that the cough could be related to the beginnings of a heart problem.\n\n“You mean the cough? I suppose that it is also due to age.” Praaze walked over to see what was being done on the wall. Jutting out of one side of the opening was about one inch of a leather case that was imbedded into the mortar and brick. Herman quietly viewed the scene moving gingerly among the tools and debris.\n\n“Well?” Morel followed his friend with his eyes.\n\n“Well, I’d say a cup of tea should come first, then some quick measurements.” Herman smiled. “No problem here. What say we just tear down the wall?” He knew the idea would be totally unacceptable to Morel.\n\n“What? Have you gone mad? Are you seriously suggesting that after all these months I’d just …”\n\nHerman interrupted his friend. “Of course not. What I am suggesting is that tea.”\n\nPraaze finished the Earl Grey in two hearty gulps, just as Mark came in the door. “You say twenty-seven inches?” Herman looked at the opening and addressed both of the men.\n\n“Yes, twenty-seven inches. No more, Mr. Praaze.” Morel remained seated.\n\n“Oh, but you’re wrong, Richard. You’ll need quite a bit more than that. Twenty-seven inches is the distance of the opening. You’ll need two support beams on either side and two flashing boards to finish it off, isn’t that right, Mark?” Herman turned abruptly to the carpenter, taking note that the man was staring at the briefcase as he nervously twisted a ring on his left hand.\n\n“That’s right, Mr. Morel.” Mark snapped from his concentration and addressed the person who was paying for his work. “Customarily you need a two by four for the support and a half-inch flashing.”\n\nHerman picked up a ruler. “So as a rule of thumb, we need two and a half inches on a side for a total of five beyond that twenty-seven, right, Mark?” Once again he addressed the carpenter. This time the man merely nodded.\n\n“However, we may need a larger support and a deeper flashing if an architect says so, right, Mark?” Herman walked to the opening.\n\n“Are you an architect, Mr….is it Praise?” Mark was now concentrated on Herman.\n\n“Close enough, and yes, I am an architect. I designed the Harbor Walk among other things.” Herman had a chance to look closer at the worker. He was young. He wanted to do well.\n\n“Then if you say so, we can support this as you please.” For the first time Mark smiled.\n\n“Two and a half is customary, not mandatory. Is there anything in the by-laws of this bogus group that specifically designates the size of the support or flash?” He asked both.\n\nMark and Morel looked at each other. . Mark only shrugged his shoulders as Morel sheepishly uttered, “No, I don’t think so.”\n\n“I could have a four inch support and a one inch flash, couldn’t I, Mark?” Herman smiled at the carpenter.\n\nMark smiled back and shook his head. “Unusual, but within reason. That would give you ten extra inches, if you’re willing to pay for the extra labor.” Mark unconsciously twisted his ring as he glanced over at Morel. A brief calculation revealed that the extra work would double his pay. He liked this guy Praise.\n\nMorel had also done the same calculations, and though he did not like the idea, he wondered about Herman’s intention.\n\n“However,” Herman stooped down to look at the edge of the case, “before we begin tearing down the wall, I believe we should make a small incision in the side of the leather case to see if we can determine what might be of interest in this thing.”\n\nMark’s smile turned sour knowing he could lose the bonus.\n\n“Wouldn’t the cut destroy the case as an historical artifact?” questioned Morel even as he opened a drawer to retrieve one of his sharpest knives.\n\n“More than likely. Is that top priority with you? Any buyer interested will…” Herman stopped. “I’m not really interested in the merchandising of this.” Herman noted Mark’s rapt interest in the discussion.\n\nThe cut along the side was easily done by Morel with parts of the leather more crumbling than being sliced. He finished his cut patiently as Herman brought up a light and a pair of tweezers. Methodically, Richard withdrew a scrolled paper tied with a red ribbon, a small rubbery item the size of a soap eraser, a pair of reading-glasses, and a small box approximately two inches by four inches. Inside the case there appeared to be several coins and a book with a green metal cover, perhaps copper.\n\n“Coins?” Mark expressed an interest. “What sort of coins? Are they gold?”\n\n“Patience, Mr. Lazerro.” Morel spoke to Mark although his back was toward him.\n\n“Remember Megrassus?” Herman alluded to a situation in which he and Morel had been involved in the uncovering of a mystery on the island of Crete.\n\n“Oh yes, but I certainly hope what is uncovered here will be more civil.” Morel donned a pair of rubber gloves as he glanced up to Herman.\n\nWith the skill of an acupuncturist, Morel extracted eight coins of varying size, placing them carefully on a cloth next to him.\n\nMark reached for one of them.\n\n“Mark!” Morel blurted out. “Until I say otherwise, please use rubber gloves.” He pointed to a box on the shelf.\n\nBoth Herman and Mark put on gloves then each lifted a coin to examine. All were small coins with denominations that read either farthing or half-penny. Two of them had no obvious amount. Perhaps they were tokens. All were dated between 1666 and 1714, and all were written in English.\n\n“Are they valuable?” Mark asked turning one on end, trying to read the miniscule print.\n\n“Spoken as my son Troy would speak,” Herman said. Troy, the reason for Herman going to Crete, was a happy capitalist and a committed Libertarian. Value meant money. “That remains to be seen.” Herman was above all interested in the book.\n\nAs Morel and Mark looked at the other objects, Herman studied the green cover which he had concluded was copper with patina. The symbols on the front raised more questions than they resolved. A dragon, perhaps originally red but now difficult to see due to the excess oxidation, was at the top middle of the cover. To the left of the dragon were flowers next to a scene of mountains. To the lower right of the dragon was an oak leaf with a cluster of three acorns. Herman rubbed the cover to detect more detail. Directly beneath the flowers was an hourglass, and beneath the acorns there appeared an image of a man running. Herman squinted. At the bottom to the lower right of the hourglass, and to the lower left of the runner was a large black bird. Were these icons that adorned the cover clues to the contents of this book of mystery or were they simply the fantasies of the author or were they designed to mislead? He would soon call his wife Diane so that she could research these. Her job at Bioquest involved investigating various herbs and their medicinal values. She was excellent at what she did and Herman had made use of those skills on more than one occasion.\n\nInside, the text was Latin, but the style was Shakespearean. Herman’s education had included being tutored at St. John’s where Latin and Greek were a must for success.\n\nMorel slid the red ribbon from the scroll gingerly then painstakingly he unrolled it. It cracked at several points, and at others there were small holes, but it was intact. It was in English but it too was Shakespearean in style. He began to read, struggling with the spelling, the rhetoric of a by-gone day, and an occasional blur.\n\nMark fiddled with the coins placing them in chronological order wondering about farthing and half-penny. He next picked up the small box. While the others were preoccupied with their reading, Mark unlatched the hook holding the top to the body and lifted the cover. Inside was some yellowish-brown powder, which he sniffed.\n\n“Yellowish-brown powder…”\n\n“Whew! Smells like a tomb.” Mark closed the lid.\n\nBoth Herman and Morel looked at Mark, a bit surprised that he had taken the liberty of opening the container without permission.\n\n“Perhaps it is someone’s ashes,” commented Herman.\n\nMark screwed his face in disgust.\n\n“Cute, Mr. Praaze,” Morel said, scrutinizing Mark over his half-glasses. “Mr. Lazerro, if you wish to remain in my employ, be so kind as not to disturb the contents that I wish to examine without you adding anything.” He smiled condescendingly.\n\nMark straightened. “Well, Mr. Morel, are we working on the wall, or what? I’m losing money waiting for you to make a decision.”\n\nMorel looked askance at Herman.\n\nPraaze took the cue. “Yes, Mark, we are! How wide is the opening now?”\n\nMark didn’t have to measure. “Twenty-seven inches like it has always been.”\n\n“Then cut the ten inches that we discussed earlier from the side that contains the case.” Herman said. “Richard, how deep would you estimate the case to be into the wall?”\n\n“About eighteen inches.” Morel put down the scroll.\n\nHerman looked at the piece of the case exposed. “About one inch exposed, plus ten more to cut. That makes eleven. So we would have about seven remaining in the wall. Close enough.” Herman rubbed his chin.\n\n“Then what?” asked Mark.\n\n“That, Mr. Lazerro, is our problem. Your problem is the wall.” Herman went back to the tea kettle. “Can you clear the wall by five this afternoon or do I hire someone else? Keep in mind you will be working for me, and I won’t pay more than twenty an hour.” Praaze put some fresh tea into the pot.\n\nMark knew he could not possibly get another job so late in the day, and he wanted to stay near the coins, but having the wall down by five was going to be serious work. “By five, you say?”\n\n“Five.” Praaze turned on the machine. “Twenty and all the tea you need.”\n\nMark looked at the wall, the contents of the case on the table, then at Herman. “Sure, why not?” How soon do I get some of that tea?”\n\nThe kettle hissed as the aroma of rich Earl Grey filled a waiting cup.\n\nChapter Four\n\nThe Times Heritage\n\n“John Hussiac!” The piercing voice of Joan Atwell called out from her office to the man in an oversized sweater chatting to a female colleague.\n\n“I’m the best you got”\n\n“I believe that Ms. Atwell, the toad face troll, wants to see you, John. Lucky you.” The colleague smirked. “See you at lunch.” She gently touched the man’s hand.\n\nJohn Hussiac turned to see his boss, hands on hips, waiting for him. He spoke quietly. “One day a house will fall on our Joan and all the Munchkins will be free.” He blurted out, “Coming, Mother.”\n\nJohn’s sarcasm was not appreciated by Ms. Atwell, editor of the Times Heritage. “Mr. Hussiac, I’m really looking for a good reason to fire you, so if you still have a need to keep eating, watch your step.” She pointed to a chair in her office. “There!”\n\nJohn walked slowly, virtually watching every step. As he passed his boss, he muttered, “I’m the best you got.”\n\n“Have, Mr. Hussiac, the verb is ‘have’ not ‘got’.” She missed the point. She walked around her desk to place it between them and sat at a large comfortable leather chair while John had the cheap, plastic folding one. “You would think that a person with your classic education would know his grammar. I know you’re supposedly smart, liberal arts major at Princeton, Rhodes Scholar and whatever else you put on your application that no one could read.”\n\n“It was in Latin,” John slumped in the chair. “I thought it would lend a touch of class; besides, I know my gran’ma.”\n\n“Latin. Right.” She glared at him. “John, the Times Heritage pays you to write in simple, plain English about historical items that would be interesting to our readers. You know, the origin of family names, wooden rails, life under sail…”\n\nJohn continued the litany. “Favorite corsets of 1800, the various smells of chamber pots, and of course the great discussions around the quilting circle. Would it be historical to write in Middle English?” He slowly stood and strolled to the window. “Ah, life in Flatland.” He took a pencil from his pocket, held it by the eraser and pointed at the ceiling. It looked cold outside.\n\nShe stared at him for several seconds. “And what does that comment about living in Flatland mean?” Joan was sensitive about her remarkably thin physique, and decidedly flat cheat.\n\n“I just broadcast, Ms. Atwell, I can’t answer for the reception.”\n\nShe tried to gauge the man before her, but she knew he was beyond her criteria.\n\nBefore she could speak, John continued. “I’m sure there was something you wanted when you so graciously bellowed my name across the room. Thank God I’m the only Hussiac in Highlandtown; otherwise we might be getting calls.” John slid his pencil back in his pocket.\n\n“John, shut up!” She adjusted herself in the seat as she mechanically leafed through some papers as bureaucrats love to do as a power image. Her voice was slow and formal. “As you undoubtedly know, anytime there is a renovation in the designated historical districts an application must be filed with the city establishing what and when work will be done.”\n\n“Yes, I do.” John sat.\n\n“Do what, Mr. Hussiac?” She eyed up the large curly haired man sitting in front of her.\n\n“Use simple…English.”\n\n“I do know about applications. I also know about the petty bureaucratic fascist of a decaying local government. I also know about quarks, Bushmill Whiskey, and why forty-two is important.”\n\nSilence.\n\n“Forty-two? Never mind, John, please don’t speak to me again for the remainder of the day. I’m getting a splitting headache from this conversation. Take this paper.” She handed it to him shaking her head. “On it is the name, Richard Morel, of Shakespeare Street. He has been given permission to build a doorway. Find out something about him. Ask him his plans or anything that someone out there would willingly part with thirty-five cents to read about. Use simple, modern English, John. When you’re done, say in five hundred words, put the story in this envelope and put it on my desk, say around this time tomorrow.” She handed him an envelope without looking at him. “Do you understand? Just nod, take the paper, and go.” She put her hand on her head. “As you leave, please send in your friend, ‘who doodles all the day’.” She waved him off wondering how anyone could have a name like Sally Wally.\n\nJohn slipped the paper in his pocket, already stuffed with miscellany including yesterday’s lunch wrappings. He sauntered to the door and stopped.\n\n“Not a word, John.” Joan stood.\n\nOnce again John withdrew his pencil and pointed to the ceiling and turned to go muttering the not even Spencer of Faire Queen could make this job romantic.\n\nJoan sat back down preparing to reprimand Sally’s insistence on drawing when she could be writing. She leaned back to organize her thoughts and saw a stain on the ceiling that looked strikingly like a huge hen. She was staring at this image when Sally came in.\n\n“Yes, mistress, has someone stolen one of your favorite potions?” She had a pencil in her ear.\n\nMs. Atwell quickly swallowed three aspirins.\n\nChapter Five\n\nThe Letter Revealed\n\nMark worked quietly and steadily on the wall, periodically stopping to make measurements and after wiping clean each brick, he placed it on a wooden palette. A bath of acid would be needed for any future sale.\n\nHerman made his call to Diane, asking her to do some research on the symbols on the copper cover of the manuscript he was attempting to translate. As Richard struggled with his letter, Herman picked up the container of powder and sniffed. Mark was right; it did smell of the tomb. On the inside cover of the container was the image of an eye above a truncated pyramid much like that found on a dollar bill. This icon was framed by a protractor and two five-pointed stars, an assortment of leaves, and of all things, a spider. ‘Perhaps,’ thought Herman, ‘this was an early symbol of the freemasons.’\n\n“Herman,” Morel had settled back in his favorite chair, “Would you care to hear this?”\n\n“Of course.” Herman put down the box.\n\nRichard readjusted his glasses. “Keep in mind that this letter is about three hundred years old, my Latin is thirty years old, and I’m not as young as I was.”\n\n“Noted.” Herman glanced over to Mark then back to Morel. “Would you care for some tea, Richard?”\n\nMorel thought a second. “As a matter of fact, yes. Two lumps, no milk.”\n\n“Would you prefer to give me the essence of it, or would a full reading be in order?” Herman poured water into the teapot.\n\n“I’m afraid it’s the full show.” He cleared his throat. “Here goes.”\n\n“To the reader of this scripte, may almitie God have his blessing on you. I hope there be within you some thought on what shuld be done with what you have founde.\n\nThe year of this scripte is 1745 in a place clept Fell’s Prospect nearing Baltimoretowne. I was borne in Eirland near Cork to a Mr. Cormac, attorney, and a local maide whofe name I shalle neuer knowe. Illegit I was. In disgrace because of me, mie father left Eirland and went he to the Carolinas in America where he proffered greatly. He raised me with the best of hearte and with financiall consideration.\n\nBut I was yunge, impetuious, and naturallie curious. I ignor’d his goode aduise and at thee age of sixeteene I married a Mr. Jms. Bonny. What a white liuer man he was to proue. I was justly disinherited and left to mine owne deuifes.\n\nMr. Bonny and mieselfe went to Kingston in Jaimaca where we mete the motely pirates that were to influence me into a lif of deprauitie. Here I met Pierrie, a goode friende he was, but he was more fonde of thee men then the ladies. Here I also met up with Chidly Bayard, a riche sort who tooke a liking to me tho I was stille wif to Bonny.\n\nI wuld have done faire by Chidly had I been able to controlle mie feelings. Mie strong head preuail’d and at a partee giu’n by Mr. Bayard to introduse me to polite companee, I struke a Dollie Tarwelle in the mouthe breaking two of her teethe. Polite or no, no one wille be aflandr’n mie backgrownde. After that evente, Chidly took to reproving me, then he left.\n\nAt furst I was greiu’d until I met Calico Jack Rackham. Exciting he was and aye bonnie handsom. It was Calico that got me to go pirating with him. Wee enjoied ourselfs mightily and it was on one of the raids I came into the possession of the leather casé that you nowe haue, and welcome to it you are. It had belong’d to a Me. Guifeppe Calabrino, an Italian, a man unjustly kill’d by me. I wuld haue toss’d it to the fishees, but there was something within miefelfe that said to keep it. If the man was so will’n to die for it, there must be something of importance. I left euerything as I founde it including the gold coins. I figure that the person who finds this shuld haue fomething for his labours.\n\n“What I thought was a miracle.”\n\nAs fate wuld haue it, we were caught by His Magestie’s ship, the Bristol, cap’t’d by one Jeremy Anderson, because the crewe of the Providence were lazy and drunke and wuld not fight. We were plac’d on trial in Kingston and founde guilty by Woodes Roger, Gov’ner. Include’d in our group was Calico and mie friend, Mary Reade. Mary and miefelfe were with child, so when the sentence was read alowd we plead’d our bodies. We were told we wuld be hang’d after their births but the reste of the crewe were hang’d that day. Mary, blesse her soule, died with feuer in that prisone.\n\nThen came what I thought was a miracle. Two men came into mie celle, unlock’d the door and faid I was to go to the harboure to meete a cap’t Greye of the shippe, the Balfoure. From there I’d be escort’d to Carolina. I learn’d that mie father had paid handsomlie for my escape, and that Woodes Roger had took a liking to mie. Fancie that!\n\nWhen mie childe was bourne it was dead. I chang’d mie name to Fulforth to protect mie father from further difgrace and I liv’d with him as a servent. That was in 1721. Once again fate enter’d mie lif’ in the forme of Michael Radcliffe, physician. After he made mie with childe, he left his wif, and we went to Norfolk to begin a new lif. I can stille see the looke on mie father’s face when I said mie farewelles. Such pain I will not forget, because how culd he object to a fervent leauing? Unknowne to Mr. Radcliffe, Norfolk was the place I had stor’d some tresure and this leathercase.\n\nOur furst childe was a girl who I clept Mary, after mie friend. We mov’d a bit to the north and west of Norfolk near a place call’d Fredr’ksbourg fince they had built a factory there, and men being what they are, there wuld be accidents for a doctor to fixe. Mr. Radcliffe was a goode man, fulle of work and concern.\n\n“You can almost hear her brogue.”\n\nI had mie furst sonne, Woodes, in 1724 and in 1726 we produc’d another sonne, Charles, whom I nam’d after a daring pirate, Charles Vane. Jo, our seconde girl and last childe came in 1729. Michael neuer knew that I made sure there were no more offspring. Mr. Radcliffe need’d more funds to support us, fo in 1741 we mov’d to this place on Shakespeare street in Fell’s Prospect. Those were wonderfulle times. The following yeare our daughter, Mary, married into a Jewish family from Amsterdam, whose name shalle remain secret. I want no interference in their liues. I can say they were shipbuilders. Michael was not ples’d but he saw that Mary lov’d Rachimel, and so it was.”\n\n“Jews in Fell’s Point in 1742?” Herman interrupted. “Interesting.” He cleared his throat.\n\nRichard stopped reading, took off his glasses and cleaned them with a small blue cloth. “This is tough to read. With that silly ‘s’ that looks like an ‘f’, it’s a wonder we call it English. You can almost hear her brogue in the way she writes.” Morel glanced over at Mark. “How are we doing, Mr. Lazerro?”\n\n“I assure you that my interest in this wall is far from casual.”\n\n“Fine, Mr. Morel, but I can tell you this; the wall was not done by a professional. No way.” He kept working as he talked.\n\nMorel nodded and brought up the letter to read when Herman stood and lowered the letter in Morel’s hand as he walked over to Mark. “Really? How so?”\n\nMark sat back. “Now, Mr. … it is Praass?”\n\n“Almost. With a ‘z’, but go on and tell me. I’ll add ten minutes to your time if that worries you.” Herman did not want to dilute the conversation.\n\n“Half-hour. I need a break,” Mark quickly bargained.\n\n“Done, and an espresso to boot, but I want details about this unprofessional job.” Herman sat.\n\n“I’ll get the coffee since I seem to have nothing else to do at this moment,” Morel called out.\n\nHerman turned his head. “Thank you, Richard and we will continue. I assure you that my interest in this wall is far from casual. Please continue, Mr. Lazerro.”\n\n“To begin with, there is a part of the wall that is different from the rest.” Here, Mark traced a section of the wall approximately 4 by 8 feet; a part that included the briefcase. “The bricks are the same but the mortar is not as good. We don’t even use this type of mortar today.”\n\n“Meaning?” Herman looked closely at the area.\n\n“Well, I’m not sure, but it seems the wall was originally built as part of the house…”\n\nHerman interrupted, “And this part was chipped out, the case placed in it, then the wall was rebuilt with the same bricks, but by people who did not have the skill of a professional mason. Is that it?”\n\nThe word mason surprised Mark who turned to stare at Praaze. “I didn’t say anything about masons, Mr. Praaze, you did.”\n\n“So I did, Mark, so I did, but would you agree?” Herman continued to study the wall.\n\nMark looked back to the wall. “Yes, I would.”\n\n“Would you say that the rebuilding was done at a much later date than the original wall?” Herman once more traced the fracture-line.\n\nMark turned his ring nervously. “Yes, but I’m not saying how long, only later and differently. You can see they used the same bricks that they took out.”\n\n“Yes, that I can see. I guess to save money.” Herman brushed one of the bricks.\n\n“It was done in a hurry. The bricks aren’t level as the others. The mortar is thrown about, and there was an attempt to tie-in the new with the old.” Mark pointed to some splatter on the wall, then to a poorly matched interface. “They could have meshed the two easily had they taken their time.” Once again Mark accented the area where a broken brick in his hand matched a broken brick in the wall. “Just a patch job using old materials.”\n\nHerman pulled at a piece of the leather case. It clung tenaciously to the mortar. The two materials were intricately married. Removing one of them removed the other. A piece of leather came out with hunks of mortar. “Does the mortar we use today cling like this?”\n\n“Mr. Praaze, if you let any mortar sit that long next to a porous thing like leather, they’re going to stick to each other.” Mark picked up a piece of the crumbled case.\n\n“How long do you think it would take for mortar to insinuate itself into leather?” Herman studied the piece in his hand.\n\n“Come again?” Mark looked confused.\n\n“I meant, how long do you think it would take for a piece of leather to absorb today’s mortar?”\n\n“A long time, Mr. Praaze. At least thirty or forty years. Maybe more. Why do you ask?” Mark leaned back wanting to get on with his job.\n\n“You wouldn’t do a job like this, would you?” Herman looked at Mark.\n\n“No, I would not.” Mark looked a bit irritated at the question.\n\n“If you had been asked to do this job to make it appear as the original, could you?”\n\n“It would be fairly easy if you gave me the original bricks. I can make old mortar and it would be very easy to tie-in. What wouldn’t be easy is having the mortar be part of the case as you see it is. Is that what you want when I’m done?” Mark liked the idea. It would be a handsome price.\n\n“No, Mark, I’m not asking that, only could you?” Herman rubbed his chin.\n\n“Sure can.”\n\n“You would never do a job of which you would not be proud, right?” Herman faced the man beside him.\n\nMark nodded.\n\n“And that is why you don’t like being rushed or commit yourself too quickly. You are the professional. You are the real mason. Is that it?” Herman placed his hand on Mark’s shoulder.\n\nMark nodded again, but did not smile.\n\n“How long have you been a Mason?” Herman lowered his hand.\n\nMark stared wide-eyed at Herman.\n\n“No need for all that secrecy, young man. You have been twisting that Mason’s ring all afternoon. I suspect you’d like to remove it to protect it since it is new to you, but your hand has swollen since you began working.” Herman stood.\n\nI’ve just been initiated, and I’m proud to be a Mason. No Mason would ever do a job like that. I also didn’t want to mess up the ring. I’m just not used to having a ring on my finger.” Mark felt an easing of an internal tension. “But, I’m not here to talk about being a Mason. Are you…?”\n\n“Not me, but there are others about who may very well be.” Herman glanced at Morel.\n\nMark also glanced at Morel just as the kettle hissed for another cup of tea.\n\n“However,” continued Herman, “I would refrain from getting into all of that until you have finished your job.”\n\nThey quickly downed their teas in silence, with Mark reappraising Morel. Mark returned to the wall, as Morel picked up the letter, but before reading asked, “Herman, may I ask what that was all about?”\n\n“I wanted to verify, at least to myself, the veracity of the letter’s age. I had not questioned its authenticity since the letter was in the wall that had been dated in the early 1700’s. When young Mark indicated that one part of the wall was different, the possibility of either fraud or misinformation entered the picture.” Herman sat back.\n\n“Fraud?” Morel peered over his glasses. He had never liked that word.\n\n“Yes. Someone for reasons unknown could have only recently broken the wall, written the letter in Shakespearean style, faked the coins, then replaced it all using the same old bricks.” Herman’s frown indicated he was bothered.\n\n“To what end? That’s a lot of effort to fake coins. You heard Mark. It would have to have been planned over thirty years ago for the mortar to have set properly. Really, Herman, this skeptical frame of mind has its limits.”\n\n“All of that is true. I am skeptical, but I am still not convinced of how genuine everything is. Everything could be faked.”\n\n“I’m a bit confused about your doubts.” Morel raised the letter. “Would you like to hear the rest of this? Perhaps something in it may be more assuring.” Morel took a sip of his tea staring at his friend.\n\n“If we are to resolve this conundrum, we must not have loose ends, and yes, I would very much like to hear this letter. This woman was a person of passion and it was her intuition that led us to enjoy this afternoon with tales of pirates. Press on.” Herman motioned for his friend to continue with one hand while he placed a finger of his other hand to his lips.\n\nMorel whetted his lips, read silently for a moment then read aloud. “Ah, yes, here we are; Mary has just married into a Jewish family from Amsterdam.”\n\n“Mie daughter, Mary, remain’d in Fell’s Prospect near Anne Street for nearlie a yeare. Wee saw a greate deale of each other, often shopp’ng the towne. Then she annownc’d she was going with Rachimel back to Amsterdam to be in the diamond bussiness. Mie Daughter wuld be riche, but I wuld be heartbrok’n for Id neuer see her again. Amfterdam wuld neuer be in the plans of one Michael Radcliffe.\n\nBe that as it maye, after she left we return’d to lif, and mie concerns were for the growing boys and mie darling, Jo. But I was not to be left alone. Fate enter’d mie lif in the forme of a Mr. Andre Foreneau, who had an accent. He came in Aprile of 1745. When he arriv’d at mie doore, Michael and the childr’n were not at home. I wuld haue dismiss’d him except he wore suche fine cloths; like a gentleman. Whan he told me he had knowne me as Anne Bonny, I was afear’d since I had tak’n pains to couer mie past. I was begui’d by him, fo we talk’d. His first question concerned Mr. Calabrino, which I naturallie denied. He asked about a person nam’d Di Lifle and Lafcarius and about those I did not need to lie for I had not heard of these.\n\nHe told me he was an alchemist, what euer that maye be, seeking the casé I had stolen. He was willing to pay greatly for it, and that others less friendly wuld be also looking for that satchell. He mention’d the names D’Efpagnet and Schneider, but there were others. He told me to be particularlie careful of the Freemasons and the Brothers of the Cross and Rose, but again, these meant nothing to me. He want’d me to destroy the thing if I did not giue it to him because it culd mean mie death or the death of members of mie familie saying it was like the Black Spot amoung pirates. I did not care for his threats so I told him to leaue.\n\nFor seueralle monthes nothing happen’d, then when shopping for herbes to cure mie Michael from a feuer I left Jo with him. The two lads were at their jobs. On mie return to the house the place was mightily disturb’d and mie darling Jo and mie husband were dead. Of course no one had heard any rukus.\n\nIf these murtherers had been looking for that dam-d café it was at mie friend’s house for keeping.\n\nI now fear’d for mieselfe as welle as mie childr’n’s lif. Again I was visit’d. This time a weeke later, and suche feare I had because this was a different man, a Greek by the name, I belieue he was called Filaleetis. He told me that the man responsible for mie man’s death and the death of Jo, a Mr. Jean D’Efpagnet, had been kill’d. I ask’d if he had knowne Mr. Foreneau and I was inform’d that he had died in France by the feuer. I wuld be safe for awhile but he encourag’d me to moue as soon as possible. Leaue no address and to change mie name he aduised. He told me very powerf’ll people were looking for that leather bagge. The Greek inform’d me that the secret in that bagge was beyond mie meagre comprehension, and if somehow I had discouer’d it, I’d be burn’d as a wicca. I want’d no parte of that. I told him that I did not haue the casé. He left unconuinc’d.\n\n“Well, quite a story.”\n\nWe shall leaue as soon as possible; as soon as mie sonnes burie this bagge in the eaft wall of oure house. To those that finde this euile thing, keep it. Be content. I was too afear’d to destroy it too afear’d to take it. We want no trouble, and only wish to live in peace. Signed this Christmas Day 1745, M. Anne Radcliffe\n\nMorel took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes. “Well, quite a story. How much do we believe?”\n\n“All is believable, but how much is truth is another matter. The point of the sons putting the case into the east wall increased the believability of the letter.” Herman took the letter from Morel. “I’d like to borrow this for a few days to let Diane have a look at some of the names, and I’d like to reread it. I want to verify the style.”\n\nHerman noticed that Mark had been listening to the story, often slowing his work to hear. “Mark!” Herman blurted out.\n\nMark twitched. “Yes, Mr. Praaze?”\n\n“Finished?”\n\n“Soon. That was an interesting story.” Mark had cleared around the case being careful of removing as much of the mortar as possible. “Mr. Morel, I think you should see this.”\n\nBoth Herman and Richard went over to where Mark was sitting on the floor. He pointed to a name on the leather bag: Senore Guiseppe Calabrino.\n\nChapter Six\n\nSome Unresolved Questions\n\nMorel closed the front door which had been opened to clear out some of the dust made by Mark in his effort to open the wall. “Getting down right chilly.” He looked at the gray skies becoming grayer. “It appears we may get some snow.” Richard shook his head and returned to work on the analysis of the brownish yellow powder.\n\nPraaze did not look up from his manuscript. “Spring tomorrow.” He cleared his throat. “Is there some way a window in the other house could be opened?” Herman detested a stuffy room.\n\n“Oh, of course.” Morel moved promptly past Mark and into the other house. “This way,” his voice sounded hollow in the empty room. “The dust will come this way.” Sound of a window being opened.\n\n“You know, Richard,” Herman finally looked up as his friend came back, “this Latin is not of the usual sort. Very stylized and contrived almost as if there is a code hidden within its structure. Certain words are not customarily used in syntax with others, and I have encountered many incidents on only the first page.” Herman leafed through the other pages. This drawing may be of some use to you, Richard.” He lifted the book so Morel could see.\n\nOn the page were eight circles connected by a series of lines and illustrated with strange symbols with a text of unknown origin. It looked Egyptian. (See Diagram).\n\n“They… change lead into gold?”\n\nMorel studied the drawing. “These appear to be alembics.” He pointed to the circles. “Strange, one usually finds these in the early experiments of the alchemists, you know – changing lead into gold and that sort of thing.”\n\n“Transmutation.” Herman spoke softly noticing that Mark was trying to hear them. “And do you understand any of the symbols next to the circles? Could they be alchemic signs?”\n\n“Some. This one, I believe, is mercury and this one is silver. Of course the triangles in the circles represent heat. The wavy lines could be water, but I would really need to study the rest.” He picked up the book to get a closer examination.\n\nHerman stood and drew Morel toward the door away from Mark. “Is there any indication of success?”\n\nMorel quickly looked up from the book. “Success? You mean did they actually change lead into gold? Really, Herman, I thought with your…”\n\nHerman coughed loudly, silencing his friend. “Richard, I’d appreciate more discretion.” He motioned with his eyes that Mark was intently eavesdropping.\n\nMorel glanced over toward Mark. “Herman, it is patently impossible. This you should know.” Morel added in a clear and slightly elevated tone so that Mark could hear, “Transmutation is impossible. You cannot change lead or any other element into gold. This drawing is a foolish attempt, and our science is beyond these juvenile pranks. Now, may I look at this, or do you wish to keep it to translate the Latin? That, I know, is beyond me.” Morel looked askance at Herman.\n\nHerman was fascinated by his friend’s adamant view on alchemy. “I’d like to keep it for a while. I have a friend who works at the local college in the Language Department.”\n\nThere was a knock at the front door. A large man with dark curly hair waited outside. He was dressed in clothes far too large for him, and around his neck was a bright green scarf.\n\nMorel opened the door after handing the book back to Herman. “Yes?”\n\n“I’m John Hussiac of the Times Heritage. My boss wants a story about your hole . I mean your door. She has a fixation about large openings. May I come in?” John’s accent had a Bronx flair. Without waiting for an answer, he stepped into the shop.\n\n“Well, Mr….” Morel could not remember the man’s name.\n\n“It rhymes with maniac.”\n\n“Hussiac. It rhymes with maniac.” John glanced over at Herman, nodded, and then noticed the doorway. “So that’s the hole. Big deal, I’ve seen hundreds of them. What’s the story? One big house instead of two little ones? A shop? Bowling alley? Or do you just like holes, like my boss?”\n\n“Mr. Hussiac,” Morel stepped back. “The story is a simple one. I wanted to expand my business so I needed a door. I wish it was larger, but I was granted a twenty-seven inch clearance. Tell your readers that…”\n\n“That hole is larger than twenty-seven inches.” John pointed at the opening. “You’d better fire your contractor.” John noticed the espresso maker. “I could use a cup about now.”\n\n“The coffee is not for sale, and as far as it being larger than the allowance, my architect said that more space was needed in order to trim. Twenty-seven inches is…” Morel was becoming frustrated so stopped to calm down.\n\nMark stopped working when he heard about firing the contractor. “They found those things inside the wall.” He pointed to the collection of coins, a pair of glasses, an eraser, and a letter on the table.\n\nJohn walked over to the menagerie. “You found some old coins inside the wall and you say this is a simple story. What else?”\n\nHerman sat back amused at the turn of events.\n\n“You will part these premises.”\n\n“That really isn’t yours to …” Morel moved instantly to the table to guard his find. He glanced menacingly at Mark.\n\n“Also, Mr. Hussiac, the powder over there.” Mark pointed to Morel’s lab. “And the copper book in Mr. Praaze’s hands. By the way, I’m the contractor who is doing the job. The name is Mark Edward Lazerro of Lazerro Renovates. Need the spelling?” Mark briskly flipped out a card and extended it to John.\n\n“Nope!” John put the card into his pocket without looking. “And what are you digging out of the wall? It looks like a leather bag.” “That’s it, a leather bag.” Mark went back to work.\n\n“Any of this going to the Historical Fellowship?” John pulled out a note pad and jotted some notes.\n\nBefore Morel could answer, Herman stood up. “My name is Herman Praaze. That’s P-r-a-a-z-e, and this is Richard Morel, M-o-r-e-l, and after I fix you a delicious espresso, e-s-p-r-e-s-s-o, which you will promptly drink, you will part these premises until you are invited back. These items belong to Mr. Morel, and until he has finished with them as he pleases, and has no further use of them, perhaps, if the price is right, the museum may have them.” Herman placed the book on his chair and went to the espresso machine.\n\nJohn picked up the book and began to open it.\n\n“The fact that a book was uncovered is your story. If you insist upon opening the book, that is your lawsuit. Do you understand me?” Herman called out.\n\nJohn, without a word, placed the book back. “So what do we have? Some old coins, some reading glasses, a rubber thing, some powder you’ve been fiddling with, a copper book I can’t see, and a letter which…”\n\nMorel finished his sentence, “you also can’t see.”\n\n“What’s the powder?” John eyed the lab.\n\n“I don’t know, Mr. Hussiac, I was trying to analyze it when I was rudely interrupted.” Morel was becoming sarcastic.\n\nThe phone chirped.\n\n“If you’ll excuse me, Hussiac, your coffee is done. Drink! Go!” Morel picked up the receiver. It was Diane who greeted him and immediately asked for her husband.\n\nJohn took the coffee from Herman who took the phone from Morel.\n\n“Yes, Diane, have you come up with anything? What? Your car? It’s fine.” Herman had not expected that question.\n\nThe others in the room heard a one-sided conversation.\n\n“Oh?”\n\n“Yes, a red dragon and…wait a minute.” Herman walked over to his chair and examined the book. “Okay. A red dragon is there.”\n\n“A black bird?”\n\n“What? Yes, it has a beak and it is facing left.”\n\n“An hourglass and a cluster of acorns. Good.”\n\n“Yes, I see the flowers on a mountain.”\n\n“That must be the running man.”\n\nHerman rubbed the book briskly, scrutinizing for details.\n\n“Yes, he has wings on his feet. So that’s Mercury.”\n\n“That I can’t see.”\n\n“Oh, on the back.” Herman turned the book over once again rubbing with effort.\n\n“No, I can’t see…wait…ah, yes! Here it is. A snake biting its tail; the Ourbouros. Good.”\n\n“Writing? I’m sorry but…”\n\nAt this point John had moved closer, getting a look at the copper cover. With a rapid movement, he dipped his finger in the coffee and wiped the back of the book near the symbol of the snake. Letters appeared.\n\nHerman pulled the book away. “Yes, Diane, there are letters. It read: en to pan. All is one. Does that help?”\n\nThere followed a long silence.\n\n“Really? Well, I have a few more names I’d like you to research if that’s possible.”\n\n“Great. Hold on and I’ll get them.” Herman motioned for Richard to hand him the letter.\n\nAs Herman scanned through the narrative selecting names and giving some in context in the letter, the others remained quiet but Hussiac was taking notes.\n\nA knock at the door surprised Richard who had been intensely studying the powder. He walked over to see a short, small-framed woman under a hooded jacket. Opening the door, Morel stepped back as the figure rushed past him.\n\n“That’s her real name?”\n\n“It’s freezing out there! The thin voice squeaked.\n\nJohn turned around. “Sally Wally, what are you doing here?”\n\n“The Beast from Twenty-thousand Fathoms told me to go with you.” She pulled down her hood to reveal rich red hair and green eyes.\n\nMorel closed the door. It was cold. “The Beast?”\n\n“Oh, that’s our affectionate name for our boss, Mr. Morel,” explained John.\n\n“Affectionate, eh?” Morel smiled.\n\n“This is Sally Wally, my oft-quoted sibyl,” John added.\n\n“That’s her real name?” Morel was still trying to evaluate what an oft-quoted sibyl was.\n\n“No, I’m really Igor Badenov sent here in obedience to my mistress’s orders to find body parts.” She spoke in a strange accent as she limped about the room pretending to have a hump on her back. Her one eye was closed; the other gazed madly into space.\n\nMorel stared in disbelief. “Would a cup of tea be of any help?”\n\nHerman hung up the phone. “Well, Richard, when you open the doors to the public, you must expect the public.”\n\n“I’d love some tea, Mr. Morel,” Sally said in a pleasant, civil tone as she straightened.\n\n“Delighted,” Morel smiled.\n\n“What are these?” John had one of the coins in his hand.\n\nHerman walked over to join John at the table. “As Mark said, we found them in the wall. You seem puzzled about them.”\n\nI collect coins. I know a few things.” He picked each one up, looked closely then returned it to the table. Mark watched John’s motions from a distance.\n\n“Anything about these particular coins?” Herman asked.\n\n“You’d better take them to a good dealer. These are…” John stopped and examined one with a squint and a frown.\n\n“Are what?” Herman picked one up.\n\n“Mr. Praaze, these are English farthings, half-pennies and tokens milled around 1700. It says so on the coin. On the reverse, there are symbols of a bow and arrow or a leg or a rose and crown or the bust of William. So far so good. This I would expect. The only problem is that these were made in copper or bronze or tin, never gold. Something is wrong here, but I could be wrong. Like I said, take it to a dealer. If they’re real, you got yourself a find to say nothing of a lot of money.” John put the coin back.\n\nSilence in the room.\n\nMark broke the silence. “Gold!”\n\nJohn rubbed one of the coins with intense fury. “There’s a covering of something over the gold, as if they were trying to disguise the gold, but it’s coming off. These are gold coins.”\n\nThe new fact changed the complexity of the find.\n\n“I bet there’s a real fascinating story behind this.” John held one of the coins close for inspection. “Why would anyone mint this low denomination in gold then cover it to look like it wasn’t?” He looked at each person in the room with a smile. “I’m not leaving this story to the wind. No way.”\n\nAgain there was silence in the room.\n\n“What did Diane have to say?” This time it was Morel who broke the silence.\n\n“I’d rather not say yet, Richard. Until she gets back to me, it’s all speculation.” Herman stared at the coins with renewed interest.\n\nA noise from the rear of the room drew everyone’s attention to Mark, who was holding the leather case in his hands. “It’s free.”\n\nWhen the case was held high for everyone’s inspection, the seams, rotted with age, broke and a coin fell to the floor making a sharp, ringing report. Mark picked it up, looked at it and handed it to Richard who had come over to see what Mark had done.\n\n“What is it, Richard?” Herman asked.\n\n“Another coin like the others.” Richard held it up between his thumb and forefinger.\n\nJohn moved closer to inspect the coin. “Not quite the same, Mr. Morel. It is a farthing, but this is half gold and half copper.\n\nMorel was confused.\n\n“Oh,” Hussiac mused, retrieving his note pad from his coat pocket with a flourish, “just a simple story here. Yep! Gold farthings from a case in the wall that’s over two hundred years old, half gold coins, mysterious phone calls to an unknown researcher, secret copper covered books written in enigmatic script, and a letter that is being sequestered. Yep, typical story. So typical I could get a typical Pulitzer for it.”\n\n“And it’s beginning to snow,” Sally enjoined from the door.\n\n“Snow!?” Mark called out. “Crap. My windows in the car are down, and it’s all the way over at Brown’s Wharf nearly four blocks from here.” With that, Mark got up. “Be back soon.”\n\n“You left your windows open on a public street?” asked Sally incredulously.\n\n“No, I’m in the back. My friend…” Mark shook his head. “Why am I explaining this to you? I got to go.” Mark charged out of the store, dropping the case on the floor. A small yellowish-white piece of paper jutted out of the same split from which the coin had fallen.\n\nHerman was first to notice, and as he picked it up, John paid attention. “What is that?”\n\n“Seems to be a letter.” Herman pulled it out completely, being careful of its age. Gingerly he opened it. “It’s in French.”\n\n“I read French,” John volunteered.\n\n“So do I.” Herman kept the letter.\n\n“As I do,” added Sally and Morel in unison.\n\n“Should I read it in French or English?” asked Herman as he studied the text.\n\nMorel, who knew only the basics responded, “English. I find it a more civil tongue.”\n\nSally stood at the door drinking her tea observing the falling snow. “I love the snow. It makes the city look clean and simple.”\n\nHussiac was about to make a slighting remark about English being civil, heard Sally’s comment then changed his mind. He thought that Sally was right in her terse observation about beauty; simplicity has a nobility of its own. He noticed her frizzy red hair, her freckles, and her Gaelic features. It was very different than his Middle Eastern traits. Sally was always the office girl, but now she appeared in this twilight more exotic and yes, more appealing. He felt drawn to her, protective.\n\n“Mr. Hussiac,” Herman pointedly intruded into John’s fantasy, “this might be interesting to you.”\n\nJohn broke from his trance with a jolt to face Praaze. “I’m with you, Mr. Praaze.”\n\n“This is a letter from Voltaire to a group of men in Philadelphia encouraging them to initiate a Freemason lodge.” Herman paraphrased what he had read to save time.\n\nMark entered just in time to here Herman’s comment, said nothing, and went silently to his job.\n\n“Freemasons?” John repeated. “You mean the Masons?”\n\n“Yes, I do, but the key question now is why should this Italian, Giuseppe Calabrino, have it on his possession near Jamaica?” Herman pondered the puzzle thinking how much would be resolved with Diane’s research.\n\n“What else is in the letter? I can see from here there’s got to be more.” John eyed the length. “Could you read it in translation?”\n\nHerman cleared his throat:\n\nTo the Friends of Liberty, greetings. Since the very beginnings of our society of Masons, our thoughts have always been in the advance of the rest of the world. I have waited here in the English colonies, near Philadelphia, waiting for men of good will to join our cause. Many are against us, especially the priests, the army, and the rich. We will not be stopped. Let them take the defensive. I write to encourage your efforts. Recently a letter has come to me written by a young man who is in Philadelphia. His name is Benjamin Franklin and though he is but thirteen years old, he voices our cause with dignity. The youth have joined our cause to rid ourselves of the Old Regime and make way for a new world order. Write soon. The trials of rebirth are rough but we cannot lose. Voltaire – seventeen August 1718\n\n“Did I say a Pulitzer?”\n\nHerman slowly lowered the letter. “My, my, my. Ben Franklin and Voltaire. Gold coins. Pirates. Secret Missions. Are any of us going to sleep tonight?”\n\n“Did I say a Pulitzer? This could get me to Stockholm.” John looked at Herman then Morel. He strolled to a large chair and slowly melted himself into it.\n\nThe phone chirped again. Herman thought it was most likely Diane so picked it up. It was.\n\n“Herman?” asked the voice.\n\n“Yes. Did you find out more on the names?”\n\n“Certainly,” came Diane’s assured response. “As I told you, most of the names are associated with alchemy.” Here Diane repeated each name giving a brief biography. “Everywhere I turned the line points back in time to Geber, then Khalid, then Zosimes, and eventually to an ancient Egyptian, Hermes Trismegistus, who scholars believe was really Imhotep, vizier to the pharaoh, Djoser, builder of the Step Pyramid.” Diane spoke clearly, but in rapid staccato.\n\n“Whoa, slow down, Diane.” Herman was jotting notes as fast as he could, attempting to piece together floating facts. He asked her to repeat a few names.\n\n“…over one hundred and fifty years…”\n\n“Herman, what are you involved in?” Diane sounded tired and slightly edgy.\n\n“I’m not sure, but I’m working on it.” Herman tried to comfort her. “You’ve been a big help to Richard, and I’ll be home as soon as possible. We’ll talk then.”\n\n“There is one name that you mentioned that has to be wrong.” Diane waited for Herman.\n\n“Which one?”\n\n“This person, Philalethes.” Diane hesitated so that Herman could recall. “Perhaps I have the spelling wrong, but if not, then for him to have spoken to Anne Bonny in 1745, like you say, he would have been over one hundred and fifty years old.”\n\n“Oh, well I’ll have to verify that.” Herman spoke falteringly.\n\n“You okay?” She sounded concerned.\n\n“Ah, yes.” Again there was a hesitation.\n\n“There are others in the room?” Diane was picking up the clues.\n\n“Yes, as a matter of fact there are.”\n\n“And you’d rather wait to see me?”\n\n“About this particular matter, yes,” Herman cleared his throat. “Have you got anything on the Freemasons, or the Brothers of the Rose and Cross, or the Carpocratians?”\n\n“Not yet, dearest one. You know I have salmon cooking. I’ll do a quickie on those names then I eat.” Diane had sent the ultimatum. “How soon are you coming home? You know we are expecting six inches tonight. Happy spring!”\n\n“You’re expecting six inches tonight?” Herman repeated.\n\nJohn, who had been listening to the one-sided conversation, wondered about the six inches, but noted it surreptitiously on his pad. He’d ask later, hoping it was not what he devilishly thought.\n\nHerman was about to hang up when he remembered. “Did you note anything on Calabrino?”\n\n“Not much except that he had something to do with the Italian Inquisition. I’ll try to find more. Now say good-bye.” Diane was determined to end the conversation and relax.\n\n“It was only a matter of time…”\n\n“Inquisition? That would be interesting. Good-bye, Diane. See you soon.” Herman slowly put down the phone thinking about Calabrino. There was something about him that didn’t match with the facts, at least not as they now stood revealed.\n\n“Well, that certainly was a display of esoterica.” John was the first to speak. “Are we to hear next of the Holy Grail?” He reviewed his notes. “Are you going to share anything with us?”\n\nHerman only shrugged and ignored his barbs. He was too intense on studying his own notes.\n\nJohn turned to Morel. “You know, Mr. Morel, there are people on these civic groups who would let you build a modern seventy story office building next door for a full disclosure of what’s going on here.\n\nMorel only nodded. “I’m sure they would.”\n\nAs the snow gently floated past the old lamp lights of Old Towne, as Fell’s Point was once called, the five inside had their last hot drinks of the evening. Outside, a dark hooded figure moved with panther-like stealth to the lighted window. There he paused to peer in, knowing that he could not be seen yet could see. The figure moved deeper into the shadows whispering to himself that it was only a matter of time before striking.\n\nChapter Seven\n\nA Hidden Letter\n\nIt was a wet snow, the sort that brings down power lines even as it artistically outlines the dark bare branches of winter trees. Herman drove carefully, knowing that Diane’s first question would concern her new Saab. He was thankful that the State Highway Administration had been taken by surprise by the sudden storm and had not yet sent out the salt trucks. There’d be slush sprayed on the car, but mercifully no corrosive chemicals.\n\nOn his arrival, the outside light was on and Herman could smell burning hickory; Diane had started a fire in the fireplace. He looked forward to the baked salmon then time to work on the translation.\n\nDiane greeted him at the entrance. “You have a smile, so I can assume that both you and the car are fine, right?” She closed the door waiting for an answer.\n\n“Both.” Herman gave his wife a hug. “The fire was a good idea, and the salmon smells delicious.”\n\nThe snow was falling when they finished the meal. Diane was as proud of her cooking as she was of her ability to hunt the internet. Diane didn’t surf or browse; she took accurate aim and fired for the kill. Oh, she took advantage of the occasional serendipity of the screen, but research for her had the seriousness of a lone hungry hunter. She pursued her prey until it was cornered; then came the coup de grace. Cooking was different; she was the leisurely artist; here she could express that other self that had been forced into exile. Years ago, Diane had placed the rebellious side of herself into the gulag of the subconscious. Recently, however, as she aged, those dissident thoughts began to emerge and Herman liked what he saw.\n\nOver the years, her blond hair had subtly grayed and some wrinkles had appeared about the eyes. She talked more of flowers, not as a medicine, but as marvels of a higher majesty.\n\n“I’ll clean up,” Herman volunteered. “You’ve done a great job on those names and with dinner. You need a break.”\n\n“I really don’t mind, but if you insist, I’ll track down the names that I starred.” She stood. “Oh, I forgot. I’ll need some time to finish this project on vibrational medicine I promised for Tom. Sorry.” There was sadness in her voice. Tom was her boss at Bioquest and although he was no martinet, he liked results that brought a profit. He enjoyed the gathering of knowledge, but the world had grown greedier and as for so many, joy had to be tempered by the imperium of the DOW.\n\nHerman quickly finished clearing and went to his study. He thought of how many architectural projects had been hatched in that sequestered chamber. He considered how life, be it of a baby or an idea, begins in the darkness of the womb or that of the skull. Plaques on the wall silently testified to his success, but now that he was retired, all of that was in the past. Outside his den, past the French doors was the pool. Herman had purposely left it uncovered since the winters were becoming milder, and this season proved to be no different, only two snows with the temperature only falling to twenty. The pool would survive and besides, he enjoyed sitting there at night, especially in the full moon and watching the moonlight on the water.\n\nHe turned on the brass desk lamp that emitted a soft glow, and then set the radio at the Hopkins station. Strands of a Bach fugue gently filled the room.\n\nHerman sat in the submissively soft leather chair, placed a Latin dictionary in front of him, and a cup of coffee to his right. The chamber was dim, cool, quiet, and ready.\n\nThe translating was awkward at first, but gradually the declensions gave way to familiarity. The writer was no slouch in intellect or expression. At one point Herman entertained the idea that the writer could be of English nobility, and that thought haunted the pages as Herman delved even deeper into the book’s mystery. The dictionary became increasingly crucial and though necessary, the lexicon was not sufficient. He was becoming lost in the woods of words, and needed a Virgil to guide him through this Inferno. His pons asinorum of understanding lay before him and he hesitated to cross.\n\nSo far as Herman could piece together, the contents of the manuscript were far older than the book since references were made to it, being a copy of many generations of copies of an original found by the Knights Templars in 1200, but now lost.\n\nIt seemed that these Knights Templars instead of protecting pilgrims on the way to the Holy Land, had spent nearly all of their time and energy on a project digging under the temple of Solomon. Supposedly, in addition to much wealth, they discovered twenty-four scrolls possessing forty-two books divided into seven sections. According to the author of the manuscript and Herman’s sophomoric interpretation, the books were originally written in hieroglyphics on an emerald tablet. Herman seriously questioned his translation at this point, but continued in his task hoping that more contextual clues would be of assistance. There was a reference to a town named Khemenu, which the Moslems renamed Al’Khemia. Since this sounded too close to alchemy, Herman knew there had to be gross errors in his work. He needed his friend Becky Townsend.\n\nOf the seven sections, only the last dealt with the divine mysteries. Here, Herman found the page so badly smeared and damaged that all he could comprehend was that the manuscript was this seventh part. If his translation was even remotely correct, it was an exciting find, but because of the increasing esoteric nature of the knowledge, the author was using uniquely fabricated words that would be known only to the initiates. Herman translated the words ‘resurrection’, ’transmutation,’ and ‘divine healing’. On one of the pages a diagram depicting circles and lines was illustrated in a language that was definitely not Latin or for that matter no other language he had ever seen.\n\nThe flow of the text was broken periodically by scratched-out words and, what seemed to Herman, as missing paragraphs or even a missing page. Perhaps the difficulty lay in the fact that he may not be as competent as the task required. Just when he began to think that he comprehended the author, there would be more omitted words, a skipped paragraph or a change to that mysterious code on the page of circles.\n\nHe needed a break. Herman closed the book and studied the symbols on the front cover. Black birds, an hourglass, and a winged Mercury. What have these to do with his life? Who put them there countless years ago? For what reason? Why in a briefcase carried by a mysterious Italian who was both Freemason and Inquisition? Voltaire? Ben Franklin? And now, English nobility?\n\nHe turned the ancient copper book to its reverse to observe the Ourbouros. Strange alchemical signs? Latin with secret codes? Transmutation? Was it all foolishness as Morel would have us think? Was this all a waste of time as Diane thought? Herman leaned back in the quiet of his sanctorum and conjured up images of pirates on the Spanish Main. He thought of the odd visitors to Anne Bonney’s house, who spoke of secret societies, and he contemplated a russet powder that smelled of the tomb. Finally he pushed the desk away and stood to stretch. His back was bothering him more than ever and Herman knew he’d have to see a chiropractor soon. He took three aspirins from the drawer and downed them with the cold coffee.\n\nLooking outside, Herman noticed that the snow had stopped and a crescent moon filled a clear night sky. A particularly bright star was near the moon and the air felt warm as he walked out to the pool. The snow was already melting and by the morning there would be hardly a trace of the fluke storm. Herman stood staring at the moon and its reflection in his pool and wondered if his own life was nothing more than a brief spring flurry or a passing ripple on an eddy of a vast restless sea. We come and go willy-nilly as snow upon the desert’s dusty face, lighting its hour or two and is gone. Yet, the stars endure. Even as nature unleashes its fury, above the clouds reside the eternal stars.\n\n“Herman?” Diane’s voice shattered Herman’s reverie, jolting his contemplation.\n\n“Yes?” Herman turned toward the lighted doorway.\n\nDiane came out. “I thought you’d want some tea. When I couldn’t find you I got concerned. Then I saw the open door.”\n\n“Needed some fresh air. That book is tough. I’ll need Becky Townsend to help.” He turned to face the moon. “Nice, isn’t it?” He didn’t like the sound of ‘nice’. It seemed too trivial for what he was feeling.\n\nDiane looked up and said nothing at first. She sniffed the air and tersely commented, “Spring.”\n\nThey stood quietly together taking in the crescent moon, listening to the chirps of spring frogs at Ridgely’s pond and the occasional bark of a distant dog. All were memories of his childhood. A lonely light moved slowly across the sky – a passenger jet heading west? A satellite?\n\nHerman gave his wife a hug and a gentle kiss. “I’d like that tea you offered.” Both turned toward the house. “How goes the research?” Herman knew that much of what he was doing would come to a grinding halt without her effort.\n\nThey entered the house with Herman closing the door.\n\n“There’s more to those symbols than I care to discover, but if you’re satisfied for the time being, I’d like to stop.” Diane sounded tired.\n\n“Perhaps it is a good idea to call it a night.” Herman agreed with her as they entered the kitchen.\n\n“As I said, nearly all the names are associated with alchemy in some way. There is a lot out there, especially in England about mystical chemistry and the like, but…” She stopped to get the sugar and milk ready. “I get the feeling that something unsaid lies just beneath the surface.”\n\n“Beneath the surface?”\n\n“Beneath the surface?” Herman repeated.\n\n“It all seems to start with this Hermes Trismegistus of Egypt. I know this is a repeat of some things I’ve said, but it helps me to review.” Diane rubbed the back of her neck glancing at the ceiling. “Well, this Hermes, they say, was probably a man by the name of Imhotep. He was a vizier to the pharaoh, Djoser; the one who built the step pyramid at Saqqara.” She leaned back against the counter and pushed her hair from her eyes. “Imhotep supposedly created writing and in the eyes of the ancients, he was divined as Thoth, one of the gods who would tally your rights and wrongs at judgment day.”\n\n“What’s his name again? This Hermes?” Herman felt uncomfortable like he had heard the name before. There was something nagging him. Something very old and very vulnerable haunted his consciousness.\n\n“Hermes Trismegistus.” Diane spoke slowly. “It means Hermes three times praised.” The teapot began to whistle so she turned to remove it from the fire and to pour for them.\n\nHerman felt shaky. “Diane, that sounds remarkably like my name.”\n\n“What? I was pouring the…” She squinted to look at her husband. “Herman, are you O.K.?”\n\nThere was a queasy twist to his stomach. He had not eaten much during the day and without warning, he felt exhausted. “I …said…it sounds a lot like my name.”\n\nDiane handed him his tea. “Drink this. It’ll perk you up a bit and please sit down before you fall down.”\n\nHerman went to the living room sipping his tea. It tasted right and comforting.\n\n“Now,” after she noticed Herman’s color returning to his face, “you said it sounded like your name.”\n\n“Yes.” Herman took another sip. “Hermes is like Herman, three times is the meaning of my middle name, Thrice; and you said praised, which sounds markedly like Praaze.” He relaxed into the chair as if some great weight had been removed.\n\nQuietly studying her husband, Diane at last leaned forward. “So it does. Herman T. Praaze, Hermes thrice praised. Think there is a connection? Do you think you are Imhotep reincarnated?”\n\nTears flowed from Herman. He was aghast by the swell of emotion that filled his consciousness. He felt very alive, very powerful. Whatever force which now made itself known was not to be denied. Images of ancient Egypt swarmed into a consciousness that was not prepared for such scenes. The smell of musk assailed his nostrils even as he experienced a warm African sun on his half-naked body. Before his eyes lay the wealth and power of the pharaohs of ancient Ptah. Mass corvees of brown-skinned slave labor moved, by the help of a whip, gigantic stones engraved in multicolored hieroglyphics. All were in the service of the pharaoh to build his monument to eternity. Mathematicians measured the land and the sky for the perfect place of the entombment, while priests of the many gods plied divinities for assistance in assuring that pharaoh, the living god on earth, would enjoy immortality.\n\nIn Herman’s mind, two men stood beside him to take notes and to execute orders. Herman knew he was trusted by the pharaoh, and that his word, though that of a mere mortal, became the word of Thoth. A warm breeze moved the silk curtain to his right, and to his left were canopic jars, sitting on a shelf, fully inscribed by his orders. Presently, they were empty, but soon they would house the remains of one of the sons of the gods.\n\n“Herman!” Diane shook him.\n\nHe recoiled from her touch as one would from an icy hand on warm flesh. “What!” He took a deep breath. Tears ran from his watery eyes, down his cheeks and onto his shirt. He held the tea firmly in his grasp.\n\n“Are you sure you are O.K? You seem to have gone off into your own world. You looked so intensive, yet had the largest smile I’ve ever seen. “Where were you?” Diane knelt beside the chair.\n\nHerman dryly swallowed then took a sip of cool tea. “I was an architect in a land far away and a long time ago.”\n\n“Architect?” Diane repeated. “As you are now?”\n\n“You obviously stirred some buried thoughts about me being this Imhotep, this Hermes of Egypt.” He took the last sip and smiled at her.\n\n“Dreams or memories?” Diane asked rhetorically as she returned to her seat. “You had me frightened for a moment.”\n\n“Perhaps it was something I saw in the movies.” Herman reflected a moment. “Strange how the two names are so close.” He sat up straight trying to break the mood. “Now, we have this Hermes and Imhotep. Same fellow. Now what?”\n\n“Are you sure you want to go on?” She finished her cool tea making a face of disapproval.\n\n“The seventh part is still missing…”\n\n“Absolutely. Did this Hermes write forty-two books divided into seven sections?” Herman recalled the manuscript.\n\nDiane was a bit surprised. “Why, yes, he did, and they say it was written on …”\n\n“An emerald tablet in the town of Khemenu, and it dealt with the power of alchemy.” Herman was feeling much better.\n\nDiane’s mouth opened in disbelief. “Why did you have me do all this research if all along you…”\n\n“The seventh part is still missing, right?” Herman smiled.\n\n“Right! And do you know why?” Diane tried to drink an empty cup.\n\nHerman turned toward her. “As a matter of fact, no.”\n\n“It was stolen.”\n\n“Stolen? I didn’t know that. By whom?” This was new to Herman.\n\n“By one of the priestesses of the Temple of Isis and her lover.” Diane looked smug.\n\n“That’s new.”\n\n“Good.”\n\nShe stood and went to the kitchen. “For a while I thought I had wasted three hours. As a point of fact, I feel, lately, that all this research is nothing but a waste of time.”\n\nHerman listened to her move about the kitchen, a sound that he had heard many times. What he had never heard was her questioning of the life of research.\n\n“Stolen from Khemenu?” Herman finally asked.\n\n“No, from the Library at Alexandria,” Diane called out from the other room.\n\n“What happened to it?”\n\nDiane walked briskly from the kitchen to her den without speaking then returned as the kettle did its hum. She put several papers in Herman’s hands and again without a word went to the kitchen. “I’d rather relax, have some more tea, then bake some old fashioned toll house cookies for a group at the office. Herman, this alchemy stuff is a little strange for me.” She emerged with a cup in her hand. “You know I love the hunt, but this is the first time the subject is hunting me. It lays traps, red herrings; then it turns on me. I’m just not comfortable with this. The real prey in this case is elusive. It offers a sacrifice to trick me, or even to appease me, while it scurries safely away under a bush. The quest seems endless and all that I’ve done is but the surface.” She smiled sadly. “I love you, but I need some time for myself. Okay?” Without waiting for a reply, Diane turned and left.\n\nHerman picked up the sheets realizing that everything she said was right, especially about her needing her own time. Much of what he read confirmed his translation. There seemed to be some connection between the seventh section and an alchemist named Zosimus of Panopolis, who taught Stephanos of Alexandria, who taught Morienius, the Hermit of Jerusalem, who taught Khalid a Moslem. Here the trail disappeared. Other names on the paper were starred with a comment. Ellis Artsan – associated with the Brothers of the Rose and Cross, Carpocratians – associated with James the brother of Jesus, E. Philalethes – dates are off, too old, Paul Lukas – Cabalist.\n\nHerman wondered about the coincidence that the reference to the missing section ended at about the same time as the beginning of the Crusades. Was it possible that Khalid, a Moslem, hid it under the Temple of Solomon for protection, only to be rediscovered by the Templars? Possible, yes; probable, big ‘if’.\n\nHe returned the cup to the sink while Diane happily busied herself with the cookies. “Are you done for the night in looking up these names?” He already knew the answer.\n\n“Yep! I’ll do a little more on the starred one then I wish you the best.” She smiled. “Honestly, Herman, it all seems so silly. I’m getting tired of all this stuff. I’d rather cook and bake and do simple practical things. Do you really mind?” Her eyes had a pleading quality that he had learned to read.\n\n“I’m delighted with what you’ve done. Real yeoman duty.” It was Herman’s turn to lean on the counter. “Ever since I’ve retired, I’m beginning to feel as you. Tend our own garden. That’s Voltaire’s advice in Candide.” Their eyes met; each smiled.\n\n“Enough!” Diane spoke out. “I’ve got cookies to tend to.” She waved him away.\n\nHerman settled in his den chair, looked at the book in front of him on the desk, and thought of calling his friend, Dr. Becky Townsend, who taught Latin at the college. He reached for the phone and casually noted the time: 11:45. He put the phone gently back. Picking up the book, Herman noticed something he had been too busy to observe until then. The back cover was minutely thicker than the front. At first he was ready to dismiss the difference as part of the binding; then he scrutinized. Over the years of aging and pressure, there occurred a small ridge along the bottom of the cover. Something was hidden in that back cover. ‘After all’ Herman thought, ‘wasn’t that letter of Calabrino hidden in the seam?’\n\n“With utmost care …”\n\nHerman pulled out one of his exacto knives and slid it along the bottom. He smiled thinking of Morel’s reaction if he were here. The note inside had to be extracted by a tweezers. The paper was delicate and brittle, but it slowly came out.\n\nWith utmost care Herman opened a letter that may not have been opened for over three hundred years. Parts were either obliterated or so badly smeared that guesses would be as important as reading. It was written, as the others, in Shakespearean English. The last line struck with particular potency and verified what he had suspected. The author identified himself as Sir Thomas Meautys, Secretary to Francis Bacon, Chancellor of England. Herman glanced through the pages not really reading for any comprehension, just for style. It was decidedly more formal and more educated than that of Anne Bonny. The possibility that the author was who he said he was increased dramatically.\n\nI__not____for I know not__________ound.\n\nYou have in your possession, dearest reader, a book of utmost import if all that I ________be true.\n\nMy discovery of this manuscript has come upon me in __ on into the hermetical science. All that I have read ________document was unc____’d by me is fantasmagoric. What is contained herein is as far beyond my science as science is __ superstition.\n\nMuch of the __ events of which I but men________b______f – is contained in the pages of this seventh book of Hermes. I have understood but a small portion of its secrets for I know not which ancient has written in their secret language, and what words ____under a __ a__ little, for there is but a passing reference to the use of the phrase ‘all seeing eye’.\n\nThe source ____ under rests on the works of Rees Ta’am, a scholar of Alexandria. He wrote according to my best calculations in the Year of our Lord 80 for he mentions the destruction of Jerusalem as being but a few years passing. Ta’am writes under the section of the history of Alexandria known as the Seraphim.\n\nHe has written of Jesus with ______ impressed, but not for reasons that we now worship. It is the time and manner of the scholar’s words that are most disturbing to me. It shall be disturbing for you if you read on.\n\nJesus according to Ta’am came with his parents to Egypt when he was two years of age to avoid Herod’s edict. Our Savior learned the ways of Egypt for eight years until Joseph was ready to return to Galilee.\n\nThere, Jesus became a carpenter keeping much to himself until his father’s death. He then returned to Egypt to continue his education, which his father had discouraged.\n\nOur Lord returned to Galilee after ten years to begin his ministry. Much of what is recorded as having taken place within the Gospels is not according to the truth of events. Ta’am has stated that the records were embellished by the passions of the day – most of which was ignorance.\n\nIn Egypt, he lived by the rule of chastity, poverty, and obedience as he learned more of the texts of Hermes. He proved to be a master of healing as well as a teacher of truth.\n\nUpon returning to Galilee, he was adored by the masses but slowly the Evil One swayed the fickle masses to revile him – he who had come to bring light, life and love. The people misunderstood his message and like so many before him who have borne the burden of brotherly love, he was killed.\n\n“Mark who wrote in secret…”\n\nHe was mourned more by strangers then by his own people. _________, the magi came from their desert homes of Persia to honor him as did the Carpacratians who wept in the shadows of the pyramids.\n\nThere was much confusion concerning the death and resurrection of this man Jesus, and in confusion is bred those who would wish simple answers to profound problems.\n\nSimple, but not true. Of all the followers of our Savior there was one, Mark, who wrote in secret what the master had spoken in private. It was this same Mark who went to Egypt with his gospel. The message was given to the Carpocratians and has remained there protected from the eyes of the world.\n\n(Here there is an extensive gap due to damaged paper.)\n\nNot by works nor by faith, but by grace we are ______.\n\n(Another gap.)\n\nThe flesh of Christ is the tree of life brought from the original garden for man. Each day we must partake of this bread.\n\n(More damage.)\n\n________ and that bread was kept by Thaddeus for it was the very body of our Savior.\n\n(More damage.)\n\n_ took the bread to Egypt, where it was (more damage) Thaddeus spoke of how that bread was to be made. Here is that secret. I will be with you always and there will be many among you who shall not die until I return in glory.\n\nThe secret of immortality is now known. That wisdom which the serpent had promised in the beginning is now here.\n\n(Extensive damage.)\n\nThis is the end of what I could understand of Ta’am’s work.\n\nFor myself I have taken this secret of this alchemy by stealth from the library of my patron, Sir Francis Bacon, for personal gain. May God forgive what I have done. I write this as a confession.\n\nThomas Meautys, 1621\n\nChapter Eight\n\nBecky Townsend\n\nHerman’s meeting with Becky Townsend at the college was delayed until he could do a rubbing of the copper covers and photocopy the contents; Becky would get the copies. He usually wouldn’t take such precautions, but the nature of the events had cast everything into the light of suspicion. Even the simple step of doing the rubbing proved revealing when, on placing a plain sheet of paper on the cover, Herman’s pencil uncovered a symbol neither he nor Diane had known. It was a “t” entwined by a snake, somewhat like a caduceus, and it was located just above the black bird at the bottom. In addition to that icon, the rubbing also made visible small lines connecting the other images. The entire configuration resembled a modified Kabbalah. On the reverse side there were no surprises, only the Oubouros, biting its tail with the Greek inscription, ‘All is One.’\n\nBecky’s office was small, cluttered, and smelled of a fragrance Herman did not like. It was the perfume used by the elderly to cover another odor even less pleasant. Since the room had no windows, that fragrance permeated everything. Becky sat at the computer transfixed to the screen, even though Herman had tapped twice on the open door. He had known Becky for about ten years, meeting her at one of the conferences the college sponsored on historic preservation projects, an effort Herman had strongly advocated among his fellow architects. Since that meeting, Becky’s once firm figure had become decidedly round, resembling the jolly monk, Friar Tuck. The similarity was even more striking when on rainy days she scurried to class with her favorite hooded gear.\n\n“Becky?” Herman finally called out to get her attention.\n\nShe looked up quickly, then back to the screen, then back to the waiting figure at the door. “Herman!” She adroitly hit some keys, turning her concentration to him. “You said 3:30, so I started on my project.\n\nHerman glanced at his watch. 4:15. “Sorry, there were some difficulties.”\n\nShe waved him in. “So what’s on your mind? You sounded so hush-hush on the phone.”\n\nThe smell was irritating Herman. “Let’s go to the cafeteria. I could use some coffee.” He stayed at the door.\n\nBecky glanced at the coffeepot in the corner of the room. “You’re right, that’s been sitting there too long. Sometimes I brew a pot to get rid of the smell in this room. I’m surprised you hadn’t noticed.”\n\n“Really? A smell, you say?”\n\n“Really? A smell, you say?” Herman sniffed. “Now that you mention it, there is the smell of stale coffee, a perfume of questionable quality, chocolate, the aroma of a deli, and a whiff of bowel, but that’s all.”\n\n“Bowel? Is that what it is? They’ve been working on the toilet upstairs. I wonder if that has anything to do with the odor? I’ve tried everything to get rid of that smell, including my aunt’s terrible perfume. Smells like a mortuary.” Becky crumbled up the paper that had held her sub and tosse"
