        "text": "Introduction\n\nLuke wrote that Jesus and his parents went to Jerusalem temple when he was twelve years old (Lk. 2:42). Apart from this, there is a very less information about his boyhood and adolescent period except Lucan short summary that Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and men (Lk.2:52). Scholars are not satisfied with this short and obscure summary for all those about 18 years. Those about 18 years, from his visit to temple and his public appearances that are completely (?) silent in the Gospels, is called the Lost Years of Jesus. As we will see below, Nicolas Notovitch, Russian traveller, discovered some manuscripts in the Buddhist monastery while he was in Leh, Ladakh in 1887 that tells the whereabouts of Jesus (he came to India and Tibet) during this silent period. Legend about Jesus in Tibet and Kashmir is also widely spoken of. Various books have been published on this issue. Since this topic becomes incomprehensible and unending, attempt is being made to find out the most probable answer taking the classical writers especially non-Christian writers and other writings concerning Jesus’ youth. A careful comparison between the eyewitnesses and the canonical Gospels is also carried out. In the meantime, Koran that talks about Jesus is intentionally skipped.\n\n1. Classical writers who did not write about Jesus’ youth\n\nNon-Christian writers in the early centuries are studied here. Most of them wrote to invalidate Jesus and the Jesus movement in their own times. Therefore, their writings can serve as good sources for our investigation. However, most of them did not write about Jesus’ youth. Robert E. Van Voorst‘s book, Jesus Outside the New Testament is very helpful for this study.\n\n1.1. Josephus (CE 37-100)\n\nFlavius Josephus was one of the Jewish leaders of the Jewish-Roman War (66-70 CE). Since his approach became Roman sided, his works, The Antiquities of the Jews and The Jewish War are unrivaled for studying the late Intertestamental period and the early New Testament times. There are two references of the name of Jesus in his book The Antiquities of the Jews. He writes, “Now there was about this time Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful to call him a man; for he was a doer of wonderful works-a teacher of such men as receive the truth with pleasure. He drew over to him both many of the Jews and many of the Gentiles. He was [the] Christ.”[1]\n\nUnlike other classical writers, Josephus was not aggressive to Jesus but did not write about his life other than this.\n\n1.2. Thallos: The Solar Eclipse at Jesus’ Death\n\nThallos[2] refuted the darkness that happened at Jesus’ death as miracle induced by God but merely the solar eclipse. In arguing against this, Sextus cited Thallos and criticized against him saying, “In the third (book) of his histories, Thallos calls this darkness an eclipse of the sun, which seems to me to be wrong (tou/to to. sko,toj e;kleiyin tou/ e`liou Qalloj avpokalei en tri,th tw/n i`storiw/n w`j evmoi. dokei/ avlogw,j).”[3]\n\nWe are apparently certain, in this level, that Thallos did not write about the early life (the silent period in the Bible) and after death of Jesus.\n\n1.3. Pliny the Younger: The Christ of Christian Worship\n\nGaius Plinius Caecilius Secundus (ca. 61-113 CE) was the nephew and adopted son of the writer Pliny the Elder (23–79 CE). He was a senator and a prominent lawyer in Rome. He published nine books of letters between 100 and 109 CE.[4]\n\nLetter 96[5] or 97[6] of Book 10 contains about Christians and the name of Christ. In this letter, Pliny reported to Emperor Trajan that he interrogated the accused Christians and threatened them. He learned that Christ was considered as divine and a prayer was addressed to HIM.[7] In his letter 97, he mentioned ‘Christian/Christianity’ 8 times and ‘Christ’ for three times. Emperor Trajan too, in response to Pliny, mentioned ‘Christian’ once in letter 98.\n\nAlmost like Thallos, we can say that Pliny the Younger is a non-Christian writer who severely denied Jesus/Christianity. In fact, he too did not write, despite his aggression against Christ and Christianity, any other information about historical Jesus, neither his childhood nor adolescence nor after death.\n\n1.4. Suetonius: The Instigator Chrestus\n\nThere is an unsolved debate about the decree of the Emperor Claudius (41–54), which can be dated to 49 CE or even earlier to 41 CE. According to text of Suetonius, Claudius expelled Jews from Rome “Since the Jews constantly made disturbances at the instigation of Chrestus.”[8] However, according to another text he did not expel them “but ordered them, while continuing their traditional mode of life, not to hold meetings.”[9] Because of these two opposing views, but discussing the same account, Romano Penna tried to harmonize it by suggesting that Claudius did not drive all the Jews from Rome, but only those involved in a riot, arguing that the statement of Acts 18:2 is an exaggeration.[10] Barnard assumes the words “at the instigation of Chrestus” refers to the troubles caused by the preaching of Christianity among the Jews.[11]\n\nEven though we are obliged to assume that this Chrestus means ‘Christ’ (Jesus), yet not more than this is found about the person and life of either Chrestus or Jesus/Christ. At best, the word ‘Christian’ is mentioned only once.[12]\n\n1.5. Tacitus: The Executed Christ\n\nCornelius Tacitus is one of the greatest Roman historians. He was probably born in 54 CE and died in c. 116 CE.[13] His book, The Annals[14] begins with the accession of Tiberius and ended with Nero’s death, which means it covers a period of about 54 years, starting from 14 CE to 68 CE. It can be considered that his Annals is his finest work and the best source of information about this mentioned period.[15]\n\nIn his Annals book 15, Tacitus thoroughly described about the ‘fire of Rome’ in the time of Nero. In 15:44, he reported that even after Roman gods (Vulcanus, Ceres, Proserpina and Juno) were propitiated, it was still believed that the fire of Rome was caused by an order. To divert this testimony, Nero accused of the Christians as the culprit. Tacitus writes,\n\nConsequently, to get rid of the report, Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judaea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome, where all things hideous and shameful form of every part of the world find their centre and become popular.[16]\n\nThis book too, like the other books we mentioned above, does not contain the historical Jesus but it is more detail and clearer than Suetonius’ report.\n\n1.6. Mara bar Serapion\n\nA 17th century manuscript written in Syriac, now in British Museum, is the only source we have about this. According to this manuscript, there was a man in around 73 CE[17] called Mara bar (son of) Serapion who wrote a letter in Syriac to his son Serapion. It is inferred that he was not a Christian as he failed to mention the name of Jesus/Christ. Voorst quotes,\n\nWhat else can we say, when the wise are forcibly dragged off by tyrants, their wisdom is captured by insults, and their minds are oppressed and without defense? What advantage did the Athenians gain by murdering Socrates, for which they were repaid with famine and pestilence? Or the people of Samos by the burning of Pythagoras, because their country was completely covered in sand in just one hour? Or the Jews [by killing] their wise king, because their kingdom was taken away at that very time? God justly repaid the wisdom of these three men: the Athenians died of famine; the Samians were completely overwhelmed by the sea; and the Jews, desolate and driven from their own kingdom, are scattered through every nation. Socrates is not dead, because of Plato; neither is Pythagoras, because of the statue of Juno; nor is the wise king, because of the new laws he laid down.[18]\n\nThough he did not mention the name yet it is understood that he meant Jesus. He pointed Socrates and Pythagoras who were wrongly killed. Similarly, Jesus was categorized among the wrongfully killed great people.[19] Up to this, we can say that Mara acknowledged Jesus’ righteousness as well as his death though he did not write about his life at all.\n\n1.7. Lucian of Samosata: The Crucified Sophist\n\nLucian[20] wrote about Christianity thrice in his book, Alexander the False Prophet but in a negative sense. Atheists and Epicureans are used in parallel to Christians.[21] Much of his reference about Christians and Jesus appear in his book, The Passing of Peregrinus. In this book, Lucian said that Peregrinus, alias Proteus was banished from the city of Rome because of murdering his father and contacted Christians in Palestine. Lucian writes, “Their first lawgiver persuaded them that they are all brothers of one another after they have transgressed once for all by denying the Greek gods and by worshipping that crucified sophist himself and living under his laws.” [22]\n\nAccording to Lucian, the crucified leader of Christians, that is Jesus, is a SOPHIST, which bears a bad sense.[23] In fact, this book (The Passing of Peregrinus) is a book to scorn Christians and Peregrinus personally as he converted and lived among them. Jesus is presented as a ‘crucified sophist’. Other than this his earthly life is not mentioned except as the one who introduced that cult.\n\nThe above classical writers and their works not only lack Jesus’ youth but also his life in general. Even when they mentioned, it is but for the derision of Jesus. Meanwhile we can say that if any strange behavior or black spot happened in his life they are the first people to pick it up and mock at Jesus and his followers. For instance, if Jesus went to India and Tibet and mastered Hindu and Buddhist teachings, then applied in the Jewish setting in Palestine, that would be nothing but religious syncretism, polluted by incredible magical healing powers. No opponents would miss this as their main aim was to annihilate Christianity and their teachings. Absence of this leads us to a conclusion that they did not come to know anything as such.\n\n2. Documents that have Jesus remained inside Palestine\n\nSince our survey is about Jesus’ whereabouts during the silent period/lost years we can leave no stone unturned. While we have not much help for our quest from the classical writings there are some other writings that tell about his location. The following sources tell us that Jesus was (during the silent/lost years) in Palestine.\n\n2.1. Toledot Yeshu\n\nThe Sefer Toledot Yeshu, “Book of the Life of Jesus,” is a Jewish retelling of the story of Jesus from an anti-Christian perspective. It seems that the pre-literary Toledoth Yeshu tradition was widespread especially for anti-Christian force. Newman claimed that Toledoth Yeshu is not a single composition even in a writing form.[24] Voorst claims that it was widely circulated in many versions inside the Jewish communities of Europe and the Middle East from at least the ninth century. This book served as a solidification of the Jews and as resistance to Christianity. In fact, the real origin of this book is absolutely uncertain.[25]\n\nThe Toledoth Yeshu/Jeschu says,\n\nIn the year of the world 4671, in the days of King Jannaeus, a great misfortune befel Israel. There arose at that tune a scape-grace, a wastrel and worthless fellow, of the fallen race of Judah, named Joseph Pandira. He was a well-built man, strong and handsome, but he spent his time in robbery and violence. His dwelling was at Bethlehem, in Juda, And there lived near him a widow with her daughter, whose name was Mirjam…the widow engaged Mirjam to an amiable, God-fearing youth, named Jochanan (John), a disciple of the Rabbi Simeon, son of Shetach (fl. B.C. 70); but he went away to Babylon, and she became the mother of Jeschu by Joseph Pandira. The child was named Joshua, after his uncle, and was given to the Rabbi Elchanan to be instructed in the Law. One day Jeschu, when a boy, passed before the Rabbi Simeon Ben Shetach and other members of the Sanhedrim without uncovering his head and bowing his knee. The elders were indignant. Three hundred trumpets were blown, and Jeschu was excommunicated and cast out of the Temple. Then he went away to Galilee, and spent there several years.[26]\n\nAccording to this book, Jeschu (Jesus) was often called as Fatherless due to his illegitimate father, Joseph Pandira.[27] How Jeschu (Jesus) gained his power (learning the unutterable/Ineffable Name of God that was engraved on the corner-stone in the Temple), his stoning to death on the eve of the Passover and of Sabbath, his body to be hung (but no tree could bear him and were always broken), how he was buried etc. are all interesting.\n\nThe Toledoth Yeshu/Jeschu seems to be of late date. Ernst Bammel put is as late middle age (14th to 16th century CE) while Newman is more generous to say that the Aramaic version of the Toledot Yeshu does not antedate the fourth century CE.[28] Baring-Gould too doubted the authenticity of it and assumed that The Toledoth Jeschu of Wagenseil was composed by a German Jew. He proposed 13th century CE as the date of writing.[29] If this is correct, then the historicity and credibility of this book, though it talks about the early life of Jesus as if he was in the Galilee is also seriously doubted.\n\n2.2. The Crucifixion: By an Eyewitness\n\nThe author of this document[30] strongly claimed that he had forgotten nothing what he saw with his own eyes.[31] According to The Crucifixion, Jesus was a member of the Essene community (Esseer) right from his infancy.[32] Joseph (his foster father) instructed him in knowledge and wisdom. Indeed, Joseph was not merely a carpenter but a man of great experience in life and deep devotion to the immortal truth. Jesus and John (the Baptist) grew up together and wandered the wildest parts of the mountain regions.[33] He and John the Baptist was admitted into the community in their years of early manhood. After that, he lived there in Galilee, and then he came to Jerusalem.[34] Both Jesus and John were given white robe (a sign of purity) and a trowel (a sign of labours of the brotherhood).[35] As Jesus and John grew rapidly in divine knowledge, they were admitted as the real members into the Order. The rule of the Order permitted the admitted member either to remain with the Brotherhood in secret labour and fellowship or to go out into the world to teach or heal. So, Jesus chose to go forth teaching while John chose to become a Terapeut or the elder.[36] Unlike the canonical Gospels, Jesus was not dead on the cross but survived due to the help of the author and Elder of the Esseers, Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus. But he later died not many days after crucifixion.\n\nIf this document is authentic, then this seems to me the hardest blow against Jesus Christ and the canonical Gospels. Almost all the miracles about resurrection are nullified. The dead of Jesus, angels seen by the tomb guards, the angels in the empty tomb, Jesus’ resurrection itself, his appearance to his disciples and road to Emaus, his appearance in the upper room, his ascension etc. are all, according to this EYEWITNESS, the result of confusion and hallucination! The author boldly claim that what the GOSPELS write about all these are not true but only hallucination.\n\nAccording to this document, Jesus was born and brought up among the Essenes. He did not go anywhere such as India or any other countries except Egypt where he was brought to Heliopolis by his parents.[37]\n\n2.3. Discrepancies between The Crucifixion and the Qumran manuscripts\n\nThe anonymous author of The Crucifixion claimed that he is the Esseer (one of the leaders of the Essene community). It is almost unanimous that the Essenes were settlers of Qumran as they secluded themselves from the main mass of the community. In 1946/47, good amount of manuscripts were discovered in Qumran caves that consist of many biblical scrolls as well as some manual of discipline of the community such as Community Rule (1QS) and Damascus Document (CD). When we compare the Qumran findings/manuscripts and The Crucifixion some discrepancies are found though we expect almost unlimited similarities, being the one and same community. Some of the important inconsistencies are:\n\n2.3.1. Kittim, according to the Qumran manuscript, is their arch enemies, that is, Romans.[38] It appears very frequently in the Qumran manuscripts (1QpHab 2:12 and many more). But Kittim is consistently not used to refer to the Romans in The Crucifixion (the term Romans is used for about four times). Though it is understood that there was a lapse of time between the early document writers and the Jesus’ contemporary Essenes yet as a radical group it is illogical that they would hastily abandon their former leaders’ attitude and thought form.\n\n2.3.2. The Elder (Terapeut) is the leader and high esteemed member of the brotherhood in The Crucifixion[39] while according to the Qumran manuscripts the priest is higher in rank than the elder (1QS 6:8).[40]\n\n2.3.3. According to The Crucifixion, celibacy is sternly demanded[41] while the discovery of the Qumran cemetery with the skeleton of women and children[42] showed that they seemed to practice marriage.[43] Josephus also said that they did not absolutely deny marriage.[44]\n\n2.3.4. Novices of Essene are given three items that signify purity-white robe/garment, pickaxe/trowel/hoe and apron.[45] Among these, only two, white robe and trowel/hoe are given both to Jesus and John, and there is no mention of an apron in The Crucifixion.[46]\n\nWe, therefore, assume that the anonymous author, in spite of his extensive knowledge about the Essenes and their lives, missed out some facts that backfire against him.\n\n2.4. Disagreements in The Crucifixion\n\nA careful investigation reveals that the author, as an eyewitness, claims absolute credibility but his emphasis sometimes pushes him into a trap. Some of them are:\n\n2.4.1. The author wrote that John the disciple knows how Jesus disappeared from the disciples in the so-called ascension. He, therefore, did not write about it. Likewise, Matthew. But the author claimed that this letter was written after 7 years of Jesus’ death.[47] It is every scholar’s unanimous findings that the canonical Gospels were not written at that time. Mark was also mentioned that he already wrote the gospel. But this cannot be taken as a fact. If this document is really historic then he should not know whether John or Mark wrote about their Gospels because they did not write that early.\n\n2.4.2. The reason why the Esseer did not try to save Jesus is that their rigid law prohibited them from interfering or taking active part in the councils or plans of the ruler of the land[48] while they immediately tried to liberate Joseph of Arimathea when he was arrested by Caiaphas.[49]\n\n2.4.3. The author believed in Jesus’ claim that he is the Son of God.[50] This is hard to believe because the Essenes are but the radical group that even accused the Jerusalem Jews (Pharisees or Sadducees or whoever) as impure. For such a fundamental sect, it is impossible to believe in someone who claims that he is the SON OF GOD.\n\nIt seems to me that The Crucifixion is but a later forgery, written very wisely by the Jews so that Jesus’ resurrection and ascension rumours/gospel would be invalidated because that news really deifies/glorifies their arch enemy Jesus. In this way, they seem to give credit to the Essenes but the true credit would go to the Jews as the nucleus of the Gospel (resurrection and ascension) is quashed.\n\n3. Manuscripts that have Jesus going elsewhere\n\nAccording to the documents we have discussed above, Jesus remained all the time in Palestine. There are some other writings that say Jesus going to other places during his youth. The places they stated are differed.\n\n3.1. Celsus: Christ the Magician\n\nCelsus[51] wrote about the background of Jesus, beginning with Mary’s thus,\n\n[b]orn in a certain Jewish village, of a poor woman of the country, who gained her subsistence by spinning, and who was turned out of doors by her husband, a carpenter by trade, because she was convicted of adultery; that after being driven away by her husband, and wandering about for a time, she disgracefully gave birth to Jesus, an illegitimate child, who having hired himself out as a servant in Egypt on account of his poverty, and having there acquired some miraculous powers, on which the Egyptians greatly pride themselves, returned to his own country, highly elated on account of them, and by means of these proclaimed himself a God.[52]\n\nAccording to Celsus, Jesus went to Egypt and learned magic.\n\n3.2. Response to Celsus\n\nCelsus accused of the Jews “worshipping angels, and are addicted to sorcery, in which Moses was their instructor” (Against Celsus 1:26). But this accusation, that was correctly refuted by Origen, is of baseless. It is no doubt only a prejudice against the Jews. There is no such OT or other reference in support of his stance/accusation. This reveals Celsus’ incomplete knowledge about Jews and Judaism, as well as Christianity. This too proves his prejudice against both the Jews in general and Christianity or Christ in particular.\n\nRegarding Jesus’ visit in Egypt, Origen quoted Plato’s Republic, Book 1:142 about how the Seriphian (a native of a very small and undistinguished island) reproached Themistocles[53] after became the celebrated one because of his military skill and shook the world, Jesus, despite his lowly atmosphere, could do the same.[54] This is Origen’s implicit argument that Jesus did not go and learn magic in Egypt.\n\n3.3. The Aquarian Gospel by Levi H. Dowling\n\nThis gospel is written by Levi H. Dowling (1844-1911).[55] According to the Aquarian Gospel, Ravanna, the royal prince of Orissa, India, took the child Jesus home (AG 21:1-17). The Brahmic priests welcomed their prince and the Jewish boy. Jesus was accepted as a pupil in the temple Jagannath and learned the Vedas and the Manic laws (AG 21:18f.). Jesus became friend of Sudras and Visyas (AG 23:1). He learned the Hindu art of healing, and became the pupil of Udraka, greatest of the Hindu healers (AG 23:3). As he was hated by the priests, he left Benares for Himalayas and stayed in the city of Kapivastu. He read the Vedas, the Avesta and the wisdom of Guatama (Levi 32:2).\n\nJesus went to Lhasa temple to read the ancient manuscripts (Levi 36:1, 6). But he did not teach there. When he finished his studies he went toward the west. At last he reached Leh in Ladakh, and was received by everyone. He abode in the monastery and taught there (36:10-12). He was four and twenty years (24 years?) of age when he entered Persia (38:1). Jesus left Persia and went to Chaldea, cradle land of Israel. He tarried for sometimes in Ur, the birthplace of Abraham (42:3, 4). He also visited Babylon (43:1), then he crossed Jordan and reached his native land and went to Nazareth (43:17). Soon he left his home again and went to Greece (44:2) and Egypt (47:1-17). He made his homeward to Jerusalem and to Galilee after these journeys (60:21).\n\nAccording to Levi, Jesus went to India and Tibet and many other places.\n\nOne thing which we must not overlook is that though this book is amazingly interesting yet it has no historical validity. The author, Levi, was born in 1844 and died in 1911. The date of completion of this Aquarian Gospel is also not known.[56] His biographer, his wife, Eva S. Dowling writes that he was carried away in spirit into the realm of akasha and received this Gospel through goddess of wisdom.[57] It is a sheer fact that he has no historical, scientific and documental foundation. His venerated personal background as son of a pastor and he himself a pastor[58] does not determine that his work is authentic. His spiritual trance and how he received the gospel are very impressive but this does not simply stand a chance for scientific quest.\n\n4. The Buddhist Issa scroll that says Jesus in India: three eyewitnesses\n\nThere are three people who claim to have seen the Buddhist manuscript about Jesus coming to India and Tibet: Nicolas Notovitch, Swami Abhedananda and Nicholas Roerich.\n\n4.1. Nicolas Notovitch\n\nThe first of them is Russian traveler and journalist Nicolas Notovitch. According to him, he started his journey to Kashmir on 14th October, 1887. After a long and challenging journey, he reached Leh, the capital city of Ladakh. Not far from Leh, was the so-called Himis Monastery which, according to Lamas, holds manuscripts that contain about the prophet Issa. Notovitch was told by the lama that the original scrolls brought from India to Nepal, and from Nepal to Tibet, relating to the life of Issa, are written in Pali language and were kept in Lhasa. A copy of it, that is, a translated version into Tibetan is also in Himis Convent/Monastery.[59]\n\nThough the chief Lama at Himis Monastery refused to show it to Notovitch at the beginning, he later (as he fell from the horse and broke his right leg below the knee, he was nursed in that convent) showed and read it out to him which was translated by his interpreter. According to Notovitch, the lama brought out two big books, the large leaves of which were of paper yellow with age, and from them he read the biography of Issa. He noted down in his travelling note-book as it was translated by his interpreter. He also said that that document was compiled under the form of isolated verses because of which, those verses sometimes have no connection or relation with each other.[60] He later arranged it into 14 chapters in which there are kind of verses in each chapter. It contains 244 verses. In this book, he put the text of the manuscript as The Life of Saint Issa: Best of the Sons of Men.[61] He first published it in French with the title La Vie inconnue de Jesus-Christ in 1894. It was translated into English in 1895.\n\n4.2. Swami Abhedananda\n\nSecond eyewitness of the manuscript is Swami Abhedananda, an apostle of Sri Ramakrishna Paramahansadev. He was one of Notovitch’s skeptics at the beginning. After he read Notovitch’s book, he himself went to Himis monastery on 4th October 1922 to verify if that manuscript is genuine. He claimed that he was also shown the manuscript from the shelf. The manuscript consists of fourteen chapters and two hundred twenty-four (224) couplets. He too got some portion of the manuscript translated by the lama who attended him.[62] His travel account was published as a book with the title Paribrajak Swami Abhedananda, which was again changed into Kashmir-O-Tibbate (Bengali). The current edition was published in 1987 with the caption Journey into Kashmir and Tibet. The verses which Swami Abhedananda writes in his book are no doubt the same with Notovitch’s notes. Abhedananda’s book contains four chapters (that is 44 verses/couplets).\n\n4.3. Nicholas Roerich\n\nThe third witness is the Russian archaeologist Nicholas Roerich who claimed to see the manuscript in 1925. His three books, Altai-Himalaya, Heart of Asia and Himalaya: A Monograph contain the manuscript mentioned above, as well as the legend about Issa. While he was in Leh, he heard the legend about Christ who arrived in India with a merchant’s caravan and how he continued to study the higher wisdom in Himalaya. In the midst of several versions, one agreement about that legend was that ‘during the time of his absence, Christ was in India and Asia’.[63] Roerich also took the evidence from the oral tradition that was still spoken in Ladak.[64] Unfortunately I could not get all the books of Nicholas Roerich especially Himalaya: A Monograph which he wrote with Frances R. Grant. His book, Altai-Himalaya contains the manuscript that is almost the same with Notovitch’s. But I want to emphasize that in this book, he did not mention if really saw the manuscript. Instead, he stated, “Let us hearken to the way in which they speak of Jesus in Asia: in the legends which have estimated antiquity of many centuries…”[65] This means his source is oral tradition only. Roerich continued to say the other version in which Jesus visited a temple near Lhasa and met with Meng-ste.[66] It is good to say that Mengtse, the Chinese priest, was centuries older than Jesus. I suppose either he or the local people came to know about the Aquarian Gospel account or Levi knew something about this and incorporated in his writing. The confusion of Jesus and Mengtse is too insensitive to compromise.\n\nIt can be said that there are three independent verifications of Jesus’ travels in Tibet. According to the Buddhist manuscript discovered by these people, Jesus, at the age of thirteen, came to India. This manuscript has a clear description about the adolescent period of Jesus that is not found in the canonical Gospels. Leaving the ministry and other stories about the Issa aside, the following is how the manuscript tells us.\n\n4.4. The Life of Saint Issa: Best of the Sons of Men\n\nNotovitch named the text of Issa in India as The Life of Saint Issa: Best of the Sons of Men. We can summarize that according to Notovitch’s manuscript, Jesus (Issa), at the age of fourteen (14), reached India (Sindh) along with the merchants (5:1) and lived among the Hindus and learned the Vedas and how to cure physical illness by means of prayers (5:3, 4). He moved around the holy cities for six years (5:5). He loved and served the Vaisyas and Sudras, the lower caste, particularly the Sudras (5:5ff.). He objected the Brahmins and Kshatriyas as they oppressed Sudras. As a result, they tried to kill him but the Sudras protected him (6:1). He then went to Nepal (the country of Gautamides-6:2) and learned Buddhist teaching (6:2). He learned Pali language and studied the scrolls of the Sutras (6:3). He perfected after six years (6:4). He then left Nepal and moved towards the west and preached on his way (6:6). He too visited Persia on his way to Palestine where he was not welcomed (8:1). He was twenty-nine (29) years old when he arrived at Israel (9:1).\n\nAs we mentioned above, the other two people who witnessed this manuscript are Swami Abhedananda and Nicholas Roerich. However, their discovery is not as long and fuller as Notovitch. The following table may be helpful to compare their findings. In the meantime, the Roerich’s verses, in his book, are not arranged like in Notovitch’s.[67] The following parallel arrangement (of Roerich) is extracted from the secondary source.[68]\n\nNicolas Notovitch Swami Abhedananda Nicholas Roerich 1:1-5 1:1-5 2:1-19 2:1-14 3:1-12 4:1-13 4:1-14 4:12-13 5:1-27 5:1-4 5:5-8, 10-11, 20-23, 25-27 6:1-16 6:1-2 7:1-18 7:4, 5, 9, 13-16 8:1-24 8:9, 13, 20-21 9:1-17 9:1, 5, 7-9, 16-17 10:1-21 10:3, 8, 9, 14, 21 11:1-15 11:4 12:1-21 12:1, 2, 8, 10-21 13:1-25 13:3, 5, 18, 22 14:1-11\n\nThere are seven (7) unnumbered and isolated verses in Abhedananda’s book yet they are similar to Notovitch’s 5:4; 6:2-4; 7:1; 8:1 and 9:1.[69] Apart from these verses, Abhedananda’s chapter 4 has 14 verses while Notivitch’s has only 13 verses. Though we say that the common verses are similar yet there are slight variations almost every verse may be due to different translators’ skill.\n\n5. Those who went to Himis monastery to prove but failed to achieve\n\n5.1. Holger Kersten\n\nKersten went to Hemis (Himis and Hemis are the same but different spelling according to sources) monastery in 1979 with the official letter from the 14th Dalai Lama. But he was informed by the chief lama of the monastery that the manuscript had already been looked for, but nothing could be found. He came to know that there is an old diary dating from the 19th century in the Moravian Church Mission in leh, in which the missionary and Tibetan scholar Dr. Karl Marx had mentioned Notovitch’s stay at the monastery in Hemis. But this too, he could not get it because it has disappeared three or four years before his visit.[70]\n\n5.2. Swami Prajnananda\n\nHe is swami Abhedananda’s disciple. In an interview with Richard Bock, Swami Prajnananda said that he himself tried to see the scrolls but there is nothing now. They have been removed. It is also not known who removed. The original Pali language in Marbour monastery in Lhasa, Tibet was also removed.[71]\n\n5.3. Professor Hassnain\n\nProfessor Hassnain was the director of the Kashmir Research Centre for Buddhist Studies. Holger Karsten reports his interview with him,\n\n[H]e managed during the past twenty-five years to discover about Jesus’ stay in India. But all his evidence-facts, implications, associations, apparent connections-could be taken as no more than contributing to a dubious, if not absurd, hypothesis unless it is also seen in the light of the most up-to-date research into the life of Jesus. The professor’s discoveries have first to be placed on a firm scientific footing, and the true origins and evidence of the teachings of Jesus revealed.[72]\n\n5.4. Paul Davids\n\nPaul Davids is a film producer and writer. He traversed various places making his crucial movie, Jesus in India. In his film, he interviewed many different people such as Prof. Elaine Pagels, Michael Hasemann (Vatican accredited journalist), head priest of Meenakshi Temple, Madurai, India, the (145th) Sankaracharya of Jaganath Temple, Puri, Monsignor Corrado Balducci (Apostolic Nuncio of the Vatican) and many more. He even visited Himis (Hemis) monastery of Ladakh. Though he saw many manuscripts in the archive, it was his misfortune that the head Lama left for Tibet in his boyhood that he had not returned for forty or fifty years. They could not open those archival books without his consent that are bounded. So, he does not have any documentary proof. However, according to one lama’s word, there was one American researcher who asked the Dalai Lama if he had seen something like that. The Dalai Lama claimed that he saw that subject matter and document in the library in Tibet as a boy. Finally, Paul Davids learned in a communication from his office that even the Dalai Lama does not know the existence of the ancient Buddhist documents that tells about Jesus in India. He (Dalai Lama) first learned from the question he was asked by others. Even he could not confirm that Notovitch and other saw and translated the ancient Buddhist documents. Still, Paul Davids believed that the document existed because there are many witnesses who saw the document which Notovitch saw.[73]\n\n5.5. J. Archibald Douglas\n\nArchibald Douglas, Professor, Government College, Agra personally went to Himis monastery and carried out his mission to prove if Notovitch was true. The detail of it is discussed below.\n\n6. arguments for the issa manuscript and their arguments\n\n6.1. Madam Caspari\n\nIn 1939, Madam Caspari, a Swiss musician and professor of music pedagogy and her husband, led by a renowned Mrs. Clarence Gasque, went to Mount Kailas near Tibet. When they were at Himis, Mrs. Gasque and Mrs. Caspari were approached by the librarian of the convent with two other monks. They were carrying three manuscripts. The librarian presented Mrs. Gasque the parchment leaves and with great reverence said, “These books say your Jesus was here.”[74]\n\n6.2. Mossa and Issa in Islam\n\nNotovitch’s Tibetan document bears the names ‘Mossa and Issa’ that are Islamic terms for Moses and Jesus. Claiming Notovitch’s ignorance of Islam, Alan Jacobs happily picks up these two names as a proof that they are unlikely to have been invented by Notovitch. He simply discovered what are existed there.[75]\n\n6.3. The Aquarian Gospel\n\nAlan Jacobs takes the Aquarian Gospel as one of the evidences for Jesus’ journey to India and Tibet.[76]\n\n6.4. The Adventure of a Lady in Tartary, Thibet, China and Kashmir\n\nHolger Kersten too is well prepared to readily accept the Jesus’ journey to India and Tibet. This can be seen from his unproved quotations. He quoted ‘a certain Mrs. Harvey described the Tibetan texts that mention Jesus in her book The Adventure of a Lady in Tartary, Thibet, China and Kashmir, which appeared in 1853.’ He categorized Mrs. Harvey as one who saw the manuscript with her own eyes.[77] Alan Jacobs wrote that he went through this book carefully and could find no such record. He further commented that Kersten, as he did his research in Germany, did not have access to the book but relied on other writers.[78] This can mean that Mrs. Harvey cannot be categorized as the eyewitness.\n\n6.5. In the World’s Attick\n\nKersten quoted Lady Henrietta Merrick’s book In the World’s Attick (1921) in which she writes, ‘In Leh is the legend of Christ who is called “Issa”, and it is said that the monastery at Hemis holds precious documents fifteen hundred years old which tell of the days that he passed in Leh, where he was joyously received and where he preached.’[79] According to Kersten, she is also one of the eyewitnesses of the manuscript. Alan Jacobs’ effort here is noteworthy. He found the only known copy of this book in the British Library and verified that the book does not contain any record that she actually had seen the manuscript except Lady Merrick did indeed visit Hemis monastery.[80]\n\n6.6. Absence of Evidence is not Evidence of Absence\n\nKersten too read Professor Douglas’ annihilation of Notovitch’s writings and concluded that his (Douglas) failure to see the writings discovered by Notovitch certainly does not prove that the writings never existed.[81]\n\n6.7. Swami Nirmalananda Giri[82]\n\nAccording to him, “In India the masters initiated Jesus into yoga and the highest spiritual life, giving him the spiritual name “Isha,” which means Lord, Master, or Ruler, a descriptive title often applied to God. It is also a title of Shiva…In Benares Jesus engaged in intense study of the spiritual texts of Sanatana Dharma, especially the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita–which he later quoted in his discourses in Israel.”[83] Swami Nirmalananda Giri makes use of the above sources which we have discussed as his only sources. We can say that he willingly accepts those findings as the fact. To be precise, this is also not a proof rather it is a belief.\n\n6.8. Elaine Pagels, Professor of Princeton University\n\nProf. Elaine Pagels’ statement is always quoted as she says, “It’s certainly possible that some people say that Jesus had travelled to India. We cannot rule out this possibility because we just don’t know.”[84] Though she did not straightforwardly say that Jesus went, yet her ambiguous statement is always taken as if she implicitly affirmed it.\n\n6.9. Jesus is reported to follow the caravan of merchants to India as there was a very active commercial exchange/trade between India and Egypt through Palestine.[85] It is probable that Jesus would be able to join bands of merchants as there really was a foreign trade between India and Palestine[86] not only between Egypt and India.\n\n7. arguments against the issa document of Jesus in India\n\nNot very long after Notovitch published his book there came up strong criticism against it. Among them are Max Muller and Archibald Doughlas. They not only criticized against his writings but annihilated himself and his writings.\n\n7.1. F. Max Müller\n\nOne of the earliest and strongest repudiation came from Max Müller, the Oxford professor. In his writing “The Alleged Sojourn of Christ in India,” in The Nineteenth Century, he accused Notovitch as inventing “not only the whole of this Vie inconnue de Jésus-Christ, but the whole of his journey to Ladakh.”[87] Müller doubted his travel and claimed, from the careful inquiry done by others that ‘No one has been taken into the Seminary for the past fifty years with a broken leg! There is no Life of Christ there at all!’[88] Müller, taking Notovitch as a gentleman who would not lie, assumed that the Buddhist monks must be ‘wags’ and were joking to him. To him, Notovitch was having a subjective thinking and was prepared to discover the life of Jesus among the Buddhist. He simply saw the manuscript, and was solely dependent on the interpreter.[89]\n\nMüller claimed that they possessed excellent catalogues of manuscripts and books of the Buddhists in Tibet and in China: the Kandjur and the Tandjur. The Kandjur consists of 108 large volumes, while the Tandjur consists of 225 volumes. The Issa account is not found in these catalogues. This absence led Müller seriously doubted against the so-called manuscript because if the manuscript was as old as it was claimed (composed in the first century CE) it would certainly be in these catalogues. He strongly accused of him as ‘of a disgraceful fraud’.[90] Though Müller accused the lamas in Himis monastery as hoaxing Notovitch in his earlier work, he, after Archibald Douglas’ investigation, was soften. He apologized to the lamas of Himis monastery and changed his version by saying, “He [Notovitch] was not hoaxed, but he tried to hoax us.”[91]\n\n7.2 Archibald Douglas\n\nThe other scholar who refuted Notovitch is J. Archibald Douglas, Professor, Government College, Agra. He personally went to Himis monastery and investigated the manuscript. After his investigation, he wrote an article in The Nineteenth Century, “The Chief Lama of Himis on the Alleged ‘Unknown Life of Christ’” in 1896. In this article, he said that he went to Ladakh, following the route taken by Notovitch to learn if Nototivich’s account was true. Unlike Notovitch, he easily gained accessed into the Himis monastery, staying there for few days enjoying the hospitality of the chief lama, who, according to Notovitch, nursed him due to his injury. Douglas claimed that he was open minded without any biased mind. After a careful investigation, Douglas found that several European gentlemen visited the Himis Monastery during 1887, 1888. He also reflected on Max Müller’s suspicion if he did really visit Leh saying that he was treated by the medical officer of Leh Hospital, Dr. Karl Marks, when suffering not from a broken leg, but from toothache.[92]\n\nDouglas was assisted by Shahmwell Joldan, retired postmaster of Ladakh. The extract from Notovitch’s book was translated to the lama and Douglas claimed that he understood thoroughly and at the end, they made that document sealed with the signature by both parties. The interview clearly says that Notovitch is wrong. No such document is there and no sahib is allowed to be copy or translate from their manuscripts.[93]\n\nDouglas, unlike Müller, does not want to doubt the lamas as ‘cunning hoax’ at the expense of the reputation of Notovitch. He rather labels Notovitch’s findings as ‘highly improbable’. His (Notovitch) bold defence for his book in the preface of the English edition, for Douglas, still ‘does not contain a single additional argument in favour of the authenticity of the Life of Issa.’[94] According to Douglas, there is no such manuscript.\n\n7.3. Hadhrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad\n\nGhulam Ahmad (1835-1908) is the founder of the worldwide Ahmadiyya Muslim Jamaat. His book, Jesus in India is the English version of his Urdu treatise, Masih Hindustan Mein. He found many similar titles[95] and life incidents[96] between Jesus and Gautama Buddha. To Ghulam Ahmad, though Buddhism as a religion is much older than Christianity, ‘Buddha resembles those of the life of Jesus.’[97] He says, “The same titles which Jesus ascribes to himself in the Gospels, have been ascribed to Buddha in the Buddhistic scripture which were compiled much later.”[98] He also explained the reason why there are many resemblances between Jesus and Buddha. The Buddhists, according to Ghulam Ahmad, claim that Jesus became acquainted with the Buddhism and Buddha’s life in the course of his journeys in India, and incorporated in his teaching in Palestine and plagiarized the teaching and titles of Buddha. Ghulam Ahmad strongly opposed this and argues that this is no more than a dishonest fabrication. In his argument, he says that Jesus did not come to India before crucifixion but only after crucifixion.[99] He made a stance that the life of Buddha was not recorded till the time of Jesus. They mixed the life and teaching of both Buddha and Jesus and ascribed to Buddha and such details were added to their literature only after Jesus’ visit, which is also after the crucifixion.[100]\n\nIn spite of his audacious argument, his standpoint is not shared by Buddhist scholars. It is understood that Gautama Buddha’s speeches, sayings, discourses and conversations were transmitted through oral tradition through a succession of teachers. Though the language which the Buddha himself spoke seems to be Magadhi,[101] yet the Buddhist literature is preserved mainly in Pali, Buddhist Sanskrit and pure Sanskrit. Among these languages, Pali is the earliest. The originals of some of these texts are lost. But they are preserved in Tibetan and Chinese translations.[102] There were four councils to settle the controversies about the Buddha’s teachings in about 483 BCE, 383 BCE, during the reign of Asoka (273-232 BCE) and in 106 BCE,[103] during the reign of Vaṭṭagamani Abhaya.[104] Though the resolutions of the earlier councils were made orally, yet the fourth council canonized the Tipiṭaka[105], that is, the whole Buddhist canonical literature is reduced in a written form (Vinaya Piṭaka, Sutta Piṭaka and Abhidhamma Piṭaka).[106] Sinhalese Buddhist tradition tells us that the Buddha’s teachings were written down in 89-77 BCE.[107] The Pali canon became virtually closed, as it was kept in a written form by the middle or end of the first century BCE.[108] This means that the written form was found at about first century BCE. However, Prof. Ranabir Chakravarti believed that the famous grammatical treatise, the Ashtadhyayi of Panini was existed as a text in the fifth century BCE.[109] It is also good to note that the Buddhist literature that we have today came from monasteries outside India, in Sri Lanka, Burma, Siam and Nepal. The original Sanskrit manuscripts found in central Asia, Gilgit and Tibet were written in about 5th to 6th century CE or may be bit earlier.[110] From this view point, Ghulam Ahmad seems to be the loser.\n\nThere are some other books that scorn Notovitch and his findings. One of the strongest is H. Louis Fader who wrote The Issa Tale That Will Not Die: Nicholas Notovitch and His Fraudulent Gospel (2003).\n\n8. Critical analysis of the issa scroll of himis monastery\n\n8.1. Correlation between the Gospels and the Issa scroll\n\nThere are numerous correlations between the Issa scroll and the Gospels in spite of the briefness. Some of the most important similarities are listed below:\n\n8.1.1. Issa’s mission to the poor and the oppressed (to the Sudras-Issa 5:5, 10, poor, weak-Issa 5:27) and Jesus’ good news to the poor and oppressed (Lk. 4:18; 6:20f. etc.) are similar.[111]\n\n8.1.2. Woe pronouncement is seen though in the context of idol worship (Issa 7:9) while Jesus pronounced ‘woe’ to the religious leaders and authorities: Pharisees, Scribes and lawyers (Mt. 23:13-29; Lk. 11:42-52) because of their blind legalism and hypocrisy.\n\n8.1.3. Theology of neighbourhood (Issa 7:15) and Jesus’ parable of the Good Samaritan (Lk. 10:30-37) are analogous.\n\n8.1.4. Jesus’ attitude on women (Issa 12:8-17) is extra-ordinary. This might be fuller than the canonical Gospels’ accounts. Jesus, in contrast to the existing cultural stigma, made women his friends. One of his close associates and disciples is woman, Mary Magdalene. He even protected the prostitute from the mob who tried to stone her. He not only protected her, but also counteracted against the people who considered themselves to be righteous by letting them know that they were the sinners (Jn. 8:3-11).\n\n8.1.5. “As the sick need physicians” (Issa 12:5) is parallel with Mk. 2:17; Lk. 5:31 (Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.)\n\n8.1.6. Issa’s teaching on “There cannot be a family without a head, and there cannot be order in a people without a Caesar, whom ye should implicitly obey…” (Issa 12:1-3) and Jesus’ saying of ‘Give therefore to the emperor the things that are the emperor’s, and to God the things that are God’s’ (Mt. 22:21; Mk. 12:17; Lk. 20:25) are parallel.\n\n8.1.7. Human heart is the true temple of God (Issa 9:11). This is parallel with Paul’s theology in 1 Cor. 6:19; 2 Cor. 6:16.\n\n8.2. Contradiction between the Canonical Gospels and the Issa Scroll\n\nWe do not point out the differences between the Issa scroll and the Gospels in general (as there are plenty) but only some apparently similar accounts though contradicting each other. In fact, there are numerous contradictions between them. Some of the most outstanding points are picked up as under.\n\n8.2.1 According to the Issa scroll, Jewish leaders were innocent in the passion of Jesus[112] while in the Gospels Pilate knew it was out of envy only the Jews handed Jesus over to him (Mt. 27:18; Mk. 15:10).\n\n8.2.2 Jesus was a saint in the eyes of the priests[113] but in the Gospels, the high priest accused of him as a ‘blasphemer’ (Mt. 26:65). The chief priests also accused Jesus of many things (Mk. 15:3). He was also accused of stirring up people all over Judea (Lk. 23:5). The teachers of the law and the chief priests looked a way to arrest him (Lk. 20:19).\n\n8.2.3 Pilate was responsible/the main culprit in Issa scroll for the suffering and death of Issa (Issa 13:23). Contrary to this, Pilate, in the Gospels, did not find any crime committed by Jesus and wanted to free him (Mt. 27:23; Mk. 15:14; Lk. 23:4, 14, 16, 20, 22; Jn. 19:4, 6, 12).\n\n8.2.4 Priests washed their hands in the Issa scroll (Issa 12:25) while it was Pilate who washed his hand in the Gospels (Mt. 27:24).\n\n8.2.5 It was Pilate who spied Jesus in the Issa scroll (Issa 11:4; 13:3) but it was the teachers of the law and the chief priests who sent spies to catch Jesus (Lk. 20:20). They not only sent spies but also the Pharisees and the teachers of the law were looking for a reason closely to accuse him (Lk. 6:7).\n\n8.2.6 Pilate plotted against Jesus with the false witness in the Issa scroll (Issa 12:1; 13:21) while it was the priests who produced false witnesses in the Gospels (Mt. 26:60).\n\n8.2.7 Jesus was born normal but Brahma incarnated in him (divine child-Issa 4:7, 8). But one of the main messages of the Gospels is the virgin and supernatural birth of Jesus from the Holy Spirit (Mt. 1:20, 23, 25; Lk. 1:34, 35). This means that right before birth, Jesus is supernatural and divine. According to John, Jesus is God incarnated (Jn. 1:1, 14).\n\n8.2.8 According to the Issa scroll, God alone is eternal and pre-existent. Even Issa does not share the co-eternity or pre-existence (Issa 5:16). But Jesus in the Gospels is presented as coeternal/pre-existent with the Father (Jn. 1:1; 8:56-58).\n\n8.2.9 The Issa scroll does not depict father-son relationship between Jesus and the Father/God (Issa 5:11). Issa maintains no personal but collective relationship with God (Issa 8:6) while Jesus in the Gospels addresses God as his personal father (Mt. 10:32, 16:17; Jn. 17:11; 20:17 and many other).\n\n8.2.10 One of the main confrontations of Issa is idol worship (Issa 6:15, 16) while Jesus mostly confronts Pharisees, Sadducees, teachers of the law etc. in their hypocrisy, but not idol worship.\n\n8.2.11 No resurrection and appearances to his disciples are mentioned in the Issa scroll (cf. Issa 14:3) while the canonical Gospels are fully equipped with these.\n\n8.2.12 Though this is outside the Gospels, yet it is worth to mention that Moses was the son of Pharaoh according to Issa scroll (Issa 2:7; Abhedananda 2:7) but biblical accounts make it clear that he was adopted by Pharaoh’s daughter as her son (Ex. 2:10; Heb. 11:24). His biological parents are Amram and Jochebed (Ex. 6:20).\n\n8.3 Criticism Against Notovitch’s Book\n\nThis is not a book review on Notovitch’s book as a travelogue; rather we specifically take his manuscript (The Life of Saint Issa: Best of the Sons of Men) and resume on Issa’s account.\n\n8.3.1. Notovitch claims that Issa’s account was written during the first years following the death of Issa while Gospels were written lately. The information is extracted from the eyewitness and contemporaries, which is more reliable than the canonical Gospels.[114] It is irrational and unreasonable to think that not even by his immediate disciples but others, that too are from far away would write all the details about it, that too immediately after his death.\n\n8.3.2. Notovitch tried to explain that the childhood, youth and education of Jesus was not written by the evangelists due to ignorance or negligence because of the long gap.[115]\n\nThe first answer (ignorance) is ruled out by Jesus’ infancy narratives found in the first two chapters of Matthew and Luke. Those who knew his infancy in detail cannot be ignorant of his youth. At least Luke would have investigated it if it is unknown to him because such a long gap should not be sidelined had any big and significant incidents occurred. The birth narrative of Jesus is written because it is a must-write incident because of several reasons:\n\n8.3.2.1. To identify John the Baptist from Jesus as both of them shared miraculous birth.\n\n8.3.2.2. To identify Jesus as the Messiah but not John since people began to think that the latter might be the Messiah. The infancy narrative clearly shows that John, though great, is but the forerunner of Jesus.\n\n8.3.2.3. Matthew tried to show his audience about Jesus’ legal Davidic lineage through infancy narrative.\n\n8.3.2.4. It also attempts to convey that Jesus is the messiah for all, the lowest (shepherd) and the elite people (wise men from the east) in order to break the Jewish exclusivism.\n\nThe second answer (negligence because of the long gap) is closer to the truth though still missed. It can be negligence but not because of the long gap. The gap is not long enough to forget his youth if significant things happened. Had Jesus been to India or Tibet and came across such wonderful and interesting experiences the Evangelist would either proudly write or intentionally hide it since Jesus would have enlightenment from the so-called PAGANS which the opponent Jews would never accept. If this is true then the Evangelist should keep quiet, but his opponents would have written it somewhere in attacking Jesus and the Jesus movement. But such is not seen, as we have discussed above. After leaving all the improbable proposals aside, the remainder is that this period is not mentioned because no significant incidents took place during this period.\n\n8.3.3. Notovitch was confused between John the Baptist and Jesus. He thought that Jesus was in the desert till the day of his public appearance (Lk. 1:80) but actually it was John the Baptist.[116]\n\n8.3.4. Notovitch believed in the good relationship between the Jewish leaders and Jesus. He asserted that the Jewish leaders not only allow him to enter into the temple but out of favour they entertained Jesus even to preach. To Notovitch, this is a sign of the Jewish leaders’ welcome to Jesus.[117] This can be right at the first glimpse. But in the Jewish custom any Jewish man was permitted to come forward to read the scripture and preach in the synagogue.[118] The synagogue leader made appointment for this assignment.[119] We have to know that that incident seems to be Jesus’ first sermon in the synagogue of Nazareth,[120] which also means the beginning of his ministry (before there was a wide gap between them). Jesus preached not because the priests favoured him but because being a Jewish adult man he is permitted to do so (as it is his custom to attend synagogue on Sabbath day (Lk. 4:16). In the canonical Gospels, there are several places where we find confrontations between the Jewish leaders and Jesus.\n\n8.4. Contradictions among the So-called Three Witnesses (Notovitch, Abhedananda and Roerich)\n\nThese three persons (Notovitch, Abhedananda and Roerich) claimed that they saw the manuscript. However, there is one fact-none of them to read the manuscript because tey did not know Tibetan. They simply saw and were completely dependent on the interpreter. May be because of this or due to some other reasons, there are some inconsistencies among their writings. Some of them are:\n\n8.4.1. According to Roerich, the Issa scroll was 1500 years old[121] while Notovitch claimed that the scroll was written during the first years following the death of Issa.[122]\n\n8.4.2. According to Abhedananda, Notovitch was nursed for one and half month[123] while Notovitch said that he was recovered within three days.[124] He mentioned his stay as a ‘short sojourn.’[125]\n\n8.4.3. According to Notovitch, the lama in Himis monastery said that the name Issa is very much respected among the Buddhists but he is only known by the chief lamas, who have read the scrolls relating to his life.[126] The priest also said, “The people (in Tibet) are not even aware that he ever existed. Only the principal lamas, who know of him through having studied the scrolls in which his life is related, are familiar with his name.[127] In the meantime, Roerich said that several Ladakh Buddhists knew about Jesus. Not only this, there are several versions of the legend that says Jesus came to India with a merchant’s caravan.[128] He also said that though the local people did not know about the “published book but they know the legend and with deep reverence they speak of Issa.”[129] There is but one option: either Notovitch or Roerich or the lama or the people of Ladakh is/are wrong. To think that the lamas of Himis Monastery were unaware of people’s knowledge of the Issa legend (though they never saw the scroll) is incredible. But all of them cannot be right because of this serious disagreement.\n\n8.4.4. Notovitch claimed that the document was compiled under the form of isolated verses because of which, those verses sometimes have no connection or relation with each other.[130] But Abhedananda said that the manuscript which the lama took from the shelf consists of fourteen chapters and two hundred twenty-four couplets (as if there is a clear and distinct portion of the Issa account, but not sparsely divided). He got some portion of the manuscript translated with the help of the lama attending on him.[131]\n\n8.4.5. If Notovitch’s claim that the verses are isolated and distributed somewhere is correct, then several massive resemblances in the three books are very much surprising.\n\n8.4.6. Abhedananda claimed that the manuscript consists of 224 verses (couplets) and he got only 44 verses while Notovitch got 244 verses (more than what Abhedananda, is spite of his less collection, without doubt claims it).\n\n8.5. Criticism against Abhedananda’s Manuscript\n\nAbhedananda said that there are 14 chapters with 224 couplets but he got only some portion of it.[132] In fact, Swami Abhedananda, while in America came across Notovitch’s book The Unknown Life of Jesus Christ and straight away returned to India to start his journey to Tibet to see if Notovitch was true.[133] If he was indeed motivated by Notovitch and set out immediately in search of it, and if at all he really found out the manuscript (which he could say 14 chapters and 224 verses), why did not he try to get all, but not only some of them?\n\n9. Evaluation and conclusion\n\nA summary of findings after the above discussions and comparative studies is still lengthy and more conclusive.\n\n9.1. We are well informed now that the classical writers we have mentioned above disliked Christianity and severely despised of it. It is a known fact that the then political rulers were Romans. The imperial representatives on each and every colony had good and fast mutual communication at that time (for instance Pliny the Younger and Emperor Trajan by means of letters). In fact, there were no big hindrances concerning communication within the empire (especially within the shadow of Pax Romana). In Roman law any religion was illegal or unauthorized outside its country of origin, though this was not enforced unless there was anti-social behavior.[134] According to this, Judaism was a legal/authorized or officially recognized religion. At the early stage, Christianity was also under the umbrella of Judaism as the first generation Christians were Jews. However, the Jewish leaders became very aggressive to the apostles and towards the movement itself. There came a big chaos within Judaism inside and outside Palestine. The trouble reached far and wide, even Rome.[135] The Jewish leaders and Roman officials tried their utmost abilities to annihilate and eradicate the Christian leaders by means of physical persecutions, literary annihilation such as scorning the person and works of Jesus, his legitimacy as of Davidic lineage was doubted, his birth was repudiated, his miraculous acts and ministry were ridiculed. Had he gone to any other places and achieved any other wisdoms or magical skills that are unacceptable to the rigid and conservative Jewish tradition, it would have certainly been reaching the knowledge of these classical writers. It is a must that either these classical writers whom we mentioned or Jesus’ contemporaries or any of the early writers who were against Jesus and Christianity would have mentioned it. Other than Celsus (Egypt), none of them writes anything about Jesus’ sojourn to any other places.\n\n9.2. Max Müller denied the credibility of Notovitch and his findings as his mentioned catalogues of the Buddhist text, Kanjur and Tanjur do not contain the Issa account. According to Müller, the Kanjur (Kandjur) consists of 108 large volumes and Tanjur (Tandjur) consists of 225 volumes, and these catalogues do not contain the Issa account.[136] So, he rejected the authenticity. Bapat, though he does not relate his writing to Müller and his criticism against Notovitch, strengthen Müller’s point. According to Bapat, there are, in Tibet, more than 4566 Buddhist texts, that are divided into two groups: Bkah hgyur, popularly called Kanjur consisting of 1108 texts and Bstan-hgyur popularly called Tanjur, consisting of 3458 texts.[137] It seems that these manuscripts do not contain the Issa manuscript. Notovitch did not deny its absence both in the Tanjur and Kanjur because if it were there, his discovery would be neither a curious nor a rare one.[138] In my observation, even if that Issa scroll did exist, it must not be in those catalogues as the canon of the Buddhist sacred literature was virtually closed in the first century BCE.[139] This implicitly means that it would certainly be an isolated manuscript. Further, it is all about the first century CE account that is too late to be included in the Buddhist canon of sacred literature. In the meantime, the question is not about the authority of the manuscript (whether it is within the canon or outside canon), but whether the manuscript is really existed or the authenticity/historicity of the manuscript is in question.\n\n9.3. Not only the existence but also the exaltation of Jesus both in the Koran and the New Testament is a transparent fact between Islam and Christianity. There has never been a controversy about the existence of a text too. If Issa or Jesus is mentioned as one of the greatest Buddhas, then in which sacred text do we find? Does it mean that it is found only in some isolated texts? If it does exist, even in an isolated text that is not accessible from public, it would absolutely be publicised rather than hiding it. It has been learnt that the legend about Issa is widespread in Ladakh and Tibet. It is unlikely that the lamas still conceal the proof of the legend to public while it is secretly revealed only to three people (know that it is hidden to others except to these three).\n\n9.4. There is an assumption that the Gospel writers intentionally concealed the adolescent period of Jesus and his sojourn to India and Tibet. One question should be asked concerning this: are the youth/early manhood of biblical key figures traced? We have to always know that the Bible is not a pure historical book; rather it is a salvation historical book. Thus, it is known that the youth of not many OT and NT figures are traced. For instances:\n\n9.4.1. Abraham: There is nothing at all about his early other than his marriage with Sarai, and then his response to God’s call from Haran (Gen. 11:29-12:1).\n\n9.4.2. Isaac: Isaac’s birth (Gen. 21:1-7) and Ishmael’s offence to him (Gen. 21:9) are seen. Apart from this, there is only one episode about the childhood of Isaac (22:1-19). Here, he is seen as a lad who could carry a load of wood. So, he is not only a small boy.[140] But this episode too has more emphasis on God’s test to Abraham’s faith than Isaac’s youth.\n\n9.4.3. Jakob: We see a comparison of the two brothers, Esau and Jacob in Gen. 25:27 “When the boys grew up, Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field, while Jacob was a quiet man, living in tents.” Other than this, Jacob’s childhood is not mentioned except when he bested his brother to sell his birthright with the stew (Gen. 25:29-34).\n\nThus, even these three figures (the Patriarchs-the Jewish pride) were not extensively traced especially about their youths.\n\n9.4.4. Moses: Very little is known about Moses’ youth except ‘the child (Moses) grew older and became Pharaoh’s daughter’s son (Ex. 2:10) and went out where his own people were working as slaves’ (Ex. 2:11). It is strange that the NT gives better information about his youth that says’ “So Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was powerful in his words and deeds (Acts 7:22). No more than this is found about his youth.\n\n9.4.5. Samuel: Samuel, son of Hannah the once barren, was dedicated to the priest Eli by his mother in the service of God (1 Sam. 1:28) and remained with him (1 Sam. 2:11). A very similar fashion with Jesus childhood description is also found for Samuel, “Now the boy Samuel continued to grow both in stature and in favor with the LORD and with the people” (1 Sam. 2:26). He was called by God as a boy (1 Sam. 3:2-14). 1 Sam. 3:19 says he grew up and the LORD was with him. The next appearance is in 1 Sam. 7:2, that seems to be after twenty. He was seen as a leader at that time (1 Sam. 7:6). Even the last judge and prophet of Israel, Samuel’s youth is dealt as brief as this much.\n\n9.4.6. David: David, as a boy, was tending his sheep (1 Sam. 16:11), he was anointed as a boy (1 Sam. 16:13), he played his lyre for King Saul (1 Sam. 16:23) and became his armour bearer (1 Sam. 16:21), he fought against Goliath and killed him (1 Sam. 17:40-51), he became very close to Jonathan, son of King Saul (1 Sam. 18:1ff.). We can say that he is one of the OT figures whose youth is dealt at the longest.\n\n9.4.7. Elijah: Elijah, the 9th century prophet from Tishbe of Gilead is one of the greatest prophets of the Old Testament. When his name appeared first, it is seen that he brought God’s word to King Ahab about the drought (1 Kgs. 17:1). None of his earlier period is reported.\n\n9.4.8. John the Baptist: John’s birth is too miraculous (Lk. 1:8-25, 57-66) that everyone who heard this wondered about it, asking, “’What then will this child become?’ For, indeed, the hand of the Lord was with him” (Lk. 1:66). But the next account that follows is, “The child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness until the day he appeared publicly to Israel” (Lk. 1:80). This is again followed by his ministry in the wilderness (Lk. 3:2ff.). Other than these, we do not have further detail about his youth.\n\n9.4.9. Paul: Paul was born in Tarsus of Cicilia and is a citizen of it. It seems (though not certain) that he was brought up in Jerusalem, educated at the feet of Gamaliel (Acts 9:11; 21:39; 22:3). Other than these, we have no more information about his early life.\n\nWe can, with ease, resolve that the above instances are the key figures of the Bible yet their youths are not dealt at length because no significant events took place except David’s anointment and victory over Goliath, as these are the greatest landmarks in the history of Israel. In this regard, Prof. Anthony Tambasco’s word is very wise as he says, “Jesus’ travel to India is based purely on the legend. And the reason why Gospels don’t tell us about these hidden years is because they did not consider the particular activities of those years as significant.”[141]\n\n9.5. I share Prof. K. P. Aleaz’s word, “There is no proof that Jesus came to India before his ministry or after his death. Those who say he came after his death, want to disprove his death and resurrection. Those who say he came before his ministry want to prove he received Indian wisdom. If he received we Indians should be proud of it,”[142] especially his last sentence. When Saul (Paul), after the Damascus road incident, went to Arabia (Gal. 1:17) he did not mention where he actually went[143] and what did he do there. Whatever is the reason, neither his fellow workers nor his opponents nor the present day Christians have any uncomfortable feeling. Similarly, even if Jesus came to India and learned or taught there, I do not really feel awful; instead, it would be a pride for us. But I am not persuaded by all the so-called literary proofs or legends especially when we compare with the improbabilities. We should not be mesmerized by the legends or feeling or desire to have Jesus brought up in our land. Putting all the arguments for and against on the scale, the improbability is much weightier and urges us to believe that Jesus did not come to India during his silent period (save post crucifixion exile to Kashmir for the other research).\n\n9.6. Luke states, “After three days they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. And all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers” (Lk. 2:46-47). Jesus was 12 years old at this time. His knowledge and wisdom really amazed the teachers in the temple. We can impeccably assume that the questions and answers they were exchanging would be Jewish legal concern. Having such wisdom and background that forged him (save the divine knowledge), it is of no need to go to either Tibet or India or Egypt what they regarded as profane lands (cf. Ps. 127) to be enlightened only to come back to Palestine and minister there (learning in one context but applied in the other context). Jesus, in his (Palestinian) ministry, confronted the then social evils that are socially, religiously and culturally legitimized. He confronted legalism and reinterpreted the scripture and traditions. His concern is always the Israelite oral and written traditions. What we find is all about the new view of the existing socio-religio-cultural life of Israelites but not the infusion of Buddhism or Hinduism and the so-called new learning thereof. Common ethical teachings that are found can be found in almost every religious teaching. That cannot be taken as the basis of origin.\n\n9.7. Jesus in Palestine\n\nWe come into conclusion that not only there were sufficient times to go to India and Tibet during his silent period, but also there is no harm if he did come to India or elsewhere. However, the manuscript is highly dubious in its existence as even the present Dalai Lama does not know it. Even if it does exist, the historicity and authenticity is seriously doubted. Notovitch and Roerich, even Abhedananda were conclusive in its antiquity based on nothing at all. Only thing is they were utterly prejudiced to accept it. There is no more accessible manuscript, no scientific proof, and no literal understanding of the manuscript even by the so-called eyewitness (they were completely dependent on the translators). Everything becomes very doubtful. We have also mentioned numerous similarities and dissimilarities between the manuscript and the Gospel accounts. There are also many discrepancies in their findings. Therefore, it is hard to admit even if we are open-minded towards the Issa account.\n\nAmong many reliable arguments some of the most striking standpoints that suggest Jesus’ stay in Palestine are discussed below. The canonical Gospel accounts are taken here since it has always been said that the Gospels are completely silent.\n\n9.7.1. Indeed there is no problem at all if Jesus came to India since sufficient time and space are there during the silent period. It was not uncommon during those days to traverse different places for preaching/teaching (for instance, Paul and cynic preachers). If Jesus really came to India and Tibet and taught there during these long period (about 17 years, that is more than fivefold of his ministry in Palestine), it should occupy at least some space in the canonical Gospels. There is no reason for the Evangelists to miss it out especially for Luke as he did proper investigation and research “carefully from the very first” (Lk. 1:3). Jesus did not commit any crime (according to the Issa scroll and legend) to conceal it. Rather, it is decisive that there is no such occasion to write.\n\n9.7.2. While he was in Nazareth, his hometown, people did not believe in him for they knew him too well. They asked, “Is not this the carpenter?” (Mark 6:3). If we take the Issa scroll account literally, this indicates that the last moment the people saw Jesus was about 17 years ago while he was a twelve-year-old boy. By that time, he should be a carpenter because when he appeared again he was no longer a carpenter. Rather, he was a teacher/preacher. Otherwise people should not address him as a carpenter. Meanwhile, who would call a twelve-year-old boy ‘carpenter’? The Nazareth people’s word implies that they knew this man very evidently as a carpenter. Since they knew and saw him as their fellow villager they could not believe in him. If he was away for those about 17 years, then they would have expected at least some wisdom from him as he might achieve one from the places he visited or where he was brought up. But their offence against Jesus explicitly tells us that he grew up with them.\n\n9.7.3. Looking into Jesus’ mastery of the Jewish legal concern it is less likely if Jesus was brought up in India and Tibet. Though he was amazingly well versed with it at the age of twelve (Lk. 2:46f.) yet he was overwhelmed, according to the Issa manuscript, by all the Hindu and Buddhist sacred writings for more than the years he spent in Palestine (in his early childhood). He should be more familiar to the Hindu and Buddhist teachings than the Jewish teachings. But this is not found in the written documents we have (the Gospels).\n\n9.7.4. The Jews were asking themselves, “How does this man have such learning, when he has never been taught?” (Jn 7:15). They were astonished. The thought provoking point here is not the Jewish astonishment how did Jesus learn while he was not taught, but on Jewish’ perception. It is obvious that such knowledge possessed by Jesus can be expected only from the learned and experienced Rabis but not from a young man like Jesus. If Jesus was enlightened from outside (India or Tibet), then we can expect response about the origin of his teaching either from him (directly in response to the crowd but he did not say) or from the crowd or from the Evangelist. One thing is noticeable, either the crowd or the Evangelist was unaware of Jesus’ long absence from Palestine.\n\n9.7.5. Church Father Justin Martyr (CE 110-165), in his Dialogue with Trypho says,\n\n[f]or even at His birth He was in possession of His power; and as he grew up like all other men, by using the fitting means, He assigned its own [requirements] to each development, and was sustained by all kinds of nourishment, and waited for thirty years, more or less, until John appeared before Him as the herald of His approach, and preceded Him in the way of baptism.”\n\n[H]e was in the habit of working as a carpenter when among men, making ploughs and yokes; by which He taught the symbols of righteousness and an active life.[144]\n\nIt is understood that not much time elapsed between Jesus and Justin Martyr. So we can assume that he would have found not only reliable literary sources but also trustworthy oral tradition about Jesus and the Jesus movement. According to him Jesus did not go elsewhere but born and brought up in Palestine like other people and was making ploughs and yokes.\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nThe Life of Saint Issa: Best of the Sons of Men\n\n4:5-A marvellous child was born in the land of Israel[145]\n\n4:12-13-Then Issa secretly absented himself from his father’s house; left Jerusalem, and, in a train of merchants, journeyed toward the Sindh, with the object of perfecting himself in the knowledge of the word of God and the study of the laws of the great Buddhas.\n\n5:1-5-In his fourteenth year, young Issa, the Blessed One, came this side of the Sindh and settled among the Aryas, in the country beloved by God. Fame spread the name of the marvellous youth along the northern Sindh, and when he came through the country of the five streams and Radjipoutan, the devotees of the god Djaïne asked him to stay among them. But he left the deluded worshippers of Djaïne and went to Djagguernat, in the country of Orsis, where repose the mortal remains of Vyassa-Krishna, and where the white priests of Brahma welcomed him joyfully. They taught him to read and to understand the Vedas, to cure physical ills by means of prayers, to teach and to expound the sacred Scriptures, to drive out evil desires from man and make him again in the likeness of God. He spent six years in Djagguernat, in Radjagriha, in Benares, and in other holy cities. The common people loved Issa, for he lived in peace with the Vaisyas and the Sudras, to whom he taught the Holy Scriptures.\n\n6:1-5-The white priests and the warriors (Brahmins and Ksahtriyas), who had learned of Issa’s discourse to the Sudras, resolved upon his death, and sent their servants to find the young teacher and slay him. But Issa, warned by the Sudras of his danger, left by night Djagguernat, gained the mountain, and settled in the country of the Gautamides, where the great Buddha Sakya-Muni came to the world, among a people who worshipped the only and sublime Brahma. When the just Issa had acquired the Pali language, he applied himself to the study of the sacred scrolls of the Sutras. After six years of study, Issa, whom the Buddha had elected to spread his holy word, could perfectly expound the sacred scrolls. He then left Nepaul and the Himalaya mountains, descended into the valley of Radjipoutan and directed his steps toward the West.\n\n8:1-The countries round about were filled with the renown of Issa’s preachings, and when he came unto Persia, the priests grew afraid and forbade the people hearing him;\n\n9:1-Issa–whom the Creator had selected to recall to the worship of the true God, men sunk in sin–was twenty-nine years old when he arrived in the land of Israel.\n\nBibliography\n\nBooks\n\nAbhedananda, Swami.
