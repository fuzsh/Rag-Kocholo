        "text": "We found ourselves in a new Italian restaurant over the weekend and had a great time. It was during brunch so they handed us a brunch menu to look over. Though I ordered something else for myself, what caught my eye was something fun-sounding on the kid's menu -- Pancake Spaghetti. Well, sure, I'll have to order that, too, just to see it.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, I present to you the Pancake Spaghetti.\n\nYou can find this at Enzo Italian Restaurant in Moses Lake, WA.\n\nWhen I first read Pancake Spaghetti I figured it would just be a funnel cake, which wouldn't be the worst thing ever. In fact, it'd be very welcome. This, however, was different than that.\n\nIt seemed like they used their griddle and created long, thin strips of pancake and presented it in a bowl with fresh cream and sliced strawberries. It was a fun experience. I'm sure even more fun if you had children.\n\nThe rest of the food we ordered was amazing. I suppose I could share that as well.\n\nSpaghetti and meatball. That's right, singular, just one meatball but it was huge.\n\nOne of my kids ordered these sweet cream ricotta pancakes.\n\nWe also had to try the 'crostini di ricotta' which was ricotta & prosciutto stuffed french toast and was, as you can imagine, amazing. The potatoes were a huge hit at our table, too.\n\nIf you find yourself in Moses Lake, stop by Enzo. I'm looking forward to trying other items on the menu later.\n\nAnd if you do go in to dine in, marvel at their black toilets. Not that toilets are something to really talk about around a meal, but they were a topic of conversation when we were here. They're amazing!\n\nKEEP LOOKING: See What 50 of America's Most 'Pupular' Dog Breeds Look Like as Puppies\n\nLOOK: The least obedient dog breeds\n\nLOOK: Famous Historic Homes in Every State\n\nREAD ON: See the States Where People Live the Longest\n\nStacker used data from the 2020 County Health Rankings to rank every state's average life expectancy from lowest to highest.
