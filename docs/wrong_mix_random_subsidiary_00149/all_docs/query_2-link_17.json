Morreale is a cultural historian of the thirteenth- and fourteenth-century Italian peninsula whose interests in medieval French-language writing extend to the Crusader States and beyond. Laura received an MA in Medieval Studies from Fordham in 1996 and a PhD in History from Fordham in 2004. She was the Associate Director at the Center for Medieval Studies from 2012 until 2018, during which time she initiated several digital projects, such as the French of Italy and French of Outremer websites and associated web-based studies, including the Oxford Outremer Map and Exploring Place in the French of Italy.

Among other efforts, Laura is currently working with the Center for Medieval Studies and Fordham University Library to design the Digital Documentation Process, a standardized citation and documentation system for born-digital projects, and has undertaken a new research initiative focused on the concept of Italy in the age of the comune.\n\nLaurel Ann Wilson is a historian of dress and fashion in the Middle Ages.

Her publications (under the name Caroline Smith) include Crusading in the Age of Joinville (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2006) and translations of ‘The Conquest of Constantinople’ by Geoffrey of Villehardouin and ‘The Life of Saint Louis’ by John of Joinville in Chronicles of the Crusades (London: Penguin, 2008).
