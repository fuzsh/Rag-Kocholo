        "text": "Saitan! The Devil Takes The Wheel Of Car Rental in Harrisburg!\n\nOn Saturday, June 3rd, 2017, I decided to join my fellow Kenyans and friends of Kenya for a Madaraka (Self Rule) Day celebration in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, slightly more than 100 miles away from Philadelphia and an easy 2 hour drive. Nostalgic about Kenya and not to be outdone by the Kenyans in Kenya celebrating Madaraka Day on June 1, the Kenyans in Harrisburg host this Madaraka Day celebration on the first Saturday of June each year.\n\nPeople dusted off their Kenyan t-shirts, hats, bracelets, Maasai belts and Safari Boots in an attempt to recreate and replicate the Kenyan experience thousands of miles away from home. I had donned my favorite rubber tire sandals, the ‘akala’ or ‘nginyîra’! During the day, there was a celebration at a local park that revolved around the ‘nyama choma’, roast meat. A Kenyan party isn’t a party without choice goat meat, beef and chicken skewered over hot coals on a grill. There was a lot of ‘finger-licking good’ Kenyan food that was prepared by the gracious Kenyan ladies, including ‘ugali’ (cornmeal) gîtheri/mûthokoi/nyoyo (corn and beans mixture) rice, chapati (similar to naan, or tortilla if you can even call it that) and other delicacies which you would find at a wedding or celebration hosted in Kenya. The Ugali was quite plentiful, a paradox especially considering the high ‘unga’ (cornmeal flour) prices in Kenya where ‘ugali’ has, almost overnight, changed from a staple food that is eaten by the hoi polloi, regular folks, the ma-sufferer, to a delicacy. Luckily, the price of cornmeal flour hasn’t shot through the roof here in the good old US.\n\nThe weather ‘cooperated’ and there was nary a cloud in the sky. For the first time, I saw some lads change into their Kenyan t-shirts immediately after their arrival at the park. After president Trump came into power, people are being cautious and trying to blend in by not wearing t-shirts that overtly scream ‘foreigner’ while driving on the roadways. As to whether this fear is misplaced, that is a story for another day.\n\nThe daytime celebrations continued without a hitch and as the sun settled in, people started inquiring about the ‘after party’ where the Kenyans would continue with the celebrations. Some tough decisions were being made then. A local Harrisburg lad, having reassured an out of town lad, months in advance, that he would act as host throughout the weekend, was seen and heard reneging on his promise by attempting to abruptly change plans and cruelly hand over his guest to another lad who obviously had no clue about the switch! Lads and lasses needed to shower and freshen up for the carousing later on. People needed to be at the right level of inebriation before going into the pricey after hours establishment.\n\nAfter deals were struck, new hosts found, liquor stores visited for ‘mzinga’ aka hard liquor and everyone freshened up, lads and lasses were amped up and proceeded to the after party for round 2. The party was at a private club and once the Kenyans came in, the party started in earnest. I was requested to sign an iron-clad agreement not to reveal the goings on in that party failing which I was going to be fined a prized he-goat. At $200 per he-goat, their secrets are safe with me. What happens in Harrisburg stays in Harrisburg. Suffice it to say that, as usual, the preferred beer of choice for Kenyans, Heineken, promptly ran out. Club owners hosting Kenyans should be advised by the promoters to stock up their bar with copious amounts of Heineken to satisfy the demands of thirsty Kenyans! The party was ‘lit’ or ‘turnt up’, or as Rankaddah aka Ule Mukamba sings in his hit song ‘call on 999’, ‘ngoma ni mwaki mwaki, kiliviti!’ People were ‘kuya tu celemblate’ ing and ‘tukunde’ ing while taking ‘mboto’, celebrating and sipping while taking photos, with great fervor!\n\nOnce the party was ‘over’ or as is customary with Kenyan parties everywhere other than in Kenya, ‘abruptly cut short’ at 3.00 am, the MC warned the party goers of police traps similar to alco-blow checkpoints back in the 254 (Kenya) and lads and lasses reluctantly left the establishment and spilled over to the parking lot, all eyes and ears out for the next course of action. The night was still young and hadn’t even begun. Remember, these same lads and lasses had been awake for most of the day at the park and were still looking for more action. Kenyans can easily ace the ‘no sleep’ challenge held by the high and mighty US Navy Seals! These are the crème de la crème of naval officers! These tough naval officers sometimes stay for up to 36 hours without sleep while executing dangerous and secret military missions. In fact, the Seals would be no match for the Kenyans. If you want to know the temerity of Kenyans regarding sleeplessness, all you need to do is attend the International Rugby Sevens held annually in Las Vegas, Nevada where the Kenyan rugby team is almost always in contention! Some lads have been known to watch the early morning games, watch all afternoon games, go and shower in the evening and attend the customary parties on the Las Vegas strip, go to the after-party at Planet Hollywood aka PH and then leave PH for the early morning games. When do these sleep-deprived lads (and some lasses) sleep? Navy Seals, over to you!\n\nLads who were hosting after after parties were having their phones ring off the hook and addresses were being keyed into GPSs for the ‘mpaka che’, that is, ‘until dawn’ rendezvous! The art of negotiations came into play again where one lad, locked out of the after-after party activities, told the potential after-after party host, ‘mzito, acha zako, niko na chupa mbili za mzinga kwa ndae na wale wasupa ni mimi nimewaleta!’ (Boss, stop playing, I have 2 big bottles of the finest liquor in the car and those lasses over there are accompanying me’) Just like that, the operative words ‘open sesame’ were pronounced and the lad hosting the after-after party readily gave out his address. ‘Hao wasupa wasikose!’ (Those lasses had better turn up!’) the host lad chuckled!\n\nAs for me, that Saturday morning, I had ‘told myself’ that I would come to Harrisburg for the day, attend the night party, sleep for 2-3 hours, and after catching the conventional 2-3 hour power nap, drive back to Philadelphia. On Saturday morning, I had rented a car to go to Harrisburg so that I would have trouble-free driving. Or so I thought. I have coaxed and cajoled my jalopy to far flung states, from Maine to Georgia but I didn’t want to take a chance this time. It had given me some brake trouble the day before and I had a project that needed to be completed on Sunday. I would then snooze on Sunday afternoon before waking up just in time for game 2 of the rematch of the NBA finals between the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State warriors. These finals were going to be explosive, ‘mwaki mwaki, kiliviti!’\n\nThe rental company was called ‘Rent a wreck of Philadelphia’! No, you didn’t hear that wrong! Maybe the ominous (and quirky) business name should have been a red flag, a harbinger of things to come! The rental was a ‘decent’ silver Ford Focus, supposedly. I later on learned that it was a 2012 model with ‘only’ 76,000 miles on it. That’s a seven year old car! Maybe too ‘old’ to be in a car rental fleet. ‘Philly rent a wreck’ had decent reviews on the Yelp website/app and since everything is completed online, I was attracted to the no-hassle booking which I like. As I painfully discovered later on, sometimes, human contact is necessary!\n\nSome friends of mine, 2 lads and 1 lass, heard that I was going back to Philadelphia and asked me if they could hitch a ride to a place called Lebanon, PA on my way back. This is not the country Lebanon of the infamous Hezbollah militia! Unlike its dangerous namesake, Lebanon PA is a quaint idyllic town a half-hour away from Harrisburg. They assured me that they lived just off the highway. I didn’t mind the company and I agreed to be the designated driver.\n\nI had driven the 114 miles from Philadelphia to Harrisburg with no problems and driven around Harrisburg with no problems. We drove to 2 houses which had promised ‘after-after parties’ but since the 2 hour journey to Philadelphia beckoned, we decided to start the journey just before 5.00 am. I figured that, I had enough time to drop the rental off, due at 8.30 am or thereabouts Sunday morning. I started the car for the long drive back and the car drove smoothly out of the housing development, like it had done since I picked it up in Philadelphia. However, just before I got onto the Highway (I-283) I heard a noise. When you have owned and driven jalopies your entire life, those rife with the old car smell, you know that car noises are not good, especially noisy, grinding ones. In fact, they are very bad and usually signify some greater misfortune that will befall you soon! The noise evoked an uncanny feeling of déjà vu where a jalopy quits on a highway in the middle of nowhere at an ungodly hour. A grinding noise makes you wonder how much money you have in your bank account as you will need to replace the jalopy soon! Have you ever noticed that when you are going through car (or any other) trouble, you never have any money in your account to solve the problem? This is usually a very tristful period! Masaibu ya (trials and tribulations of a) ma-sufferer! The car’s automatic transmission didn’t seem to be shifting right. I pulled over. The 2 lads were deep in la-la land but the one lass was wide awake and very worried by the awry turn of events. Seeing the predicament I was in, she started dishing out pieces of advice in rapid succession with a sliver of panic in her voice (“stop and start the car”, “are you sure the car is in ‘Drive’ and not 1-2?”, etc etc) I complied with all her requests, no questions asked but the car still sputtered and jerked the same!\n\nAs I was reminiscing about the whole experience, I remembered the fervent prayers that Kenyan people, both in Kenya and in the diaspora, would offer before a trip, for journey mercies. They would pray for the cars and the drivers and passengers and roads and ask that the cars be cloaked with the blood of the Lamb and have no mechanical issues whatsoever and deliver the passengers safely to their destination. In my hurry, I forgot to pray about the journey so as to be granted journey mercies by the Man Above! Was that the reason behind my fate?\n\nAfter I started the car after two minutes of rest, hoping to ‘reset’ the car’s computer, I decided to go onto the highway, hoping for a change in fortunes. Alas, the car continued jerking, this time more furiously. The lass was now getting antsy and garrulous and from the rear view mirror I could see an unmistakable moue on her worrisome face! The lads, shaken out of deep slumber by the Ford Focus transmission, eased in and out of consciousness. The effects of the long night were getting to them. The rental car on the I-83 highway jounced uncontrollably and I decided to pull over at the closest rest area. I decided to call the rental company number. The company numbers all went to voice mail. It’s a small rental car company and it was early Sunday morning! I called their roadside assistance number and the roadside assistance representative told me that if I was not covered for roadside assistance, I would have to pay for it out of pocket. I had declined all extra charges, including the roadside assistance option, while signing the car rental agreement. Why would I need roadside assistance for a mechanically sound rental, I had asked myself before renting the car? The roadside assistance is for non-mechanical issues anyway and this issue was definitely mechanical, as mechanical as it gets! The fine print in these contracts is virulent like the Lernaean Hydra, the serpentine water monster in Greek mythology! When one head is cut off, two heads grow in its place!\n\nIf I was alone in the car, I wouldn’t have been worried one bit. I would have chalked the experience to bad luck and absorbed the accompanying results with no issues at all. As a ma-sufferer, I have been in numerous car predicaments and I have always managed to weasel myself out of the situation. However, I had additional passengers who made the issue more complicated than usual. Ford cars are notorious for their reliability issues and people have in the past coined words using ‘Ford’ as an acronym that describes their dodginess, such as ‘Found On Road Dead’ or ‘Fix Or Repair Daily’ and I painfully joined the bandwagon of drivers who had suffered this fate of ‘Found On Road Dead.’ Ford had supposedly improved on their dependability issues and claimed that their horrible reputation was a thing of the past. After this experience, I beg to differ! Any confidence I had of Ford cars was eviscerated from my mind after this incident! If you ever purchase any Ford car after reading this and it breaks down on you later, you’ll only have yourself to blame!\n\nThe car was moving, albeit slowly and in floundering motions that one would only experience in a scary roller-coaster. You are definitely familiar with the grinding, rattling noise I am talking about if you, a ghetto yute (youth) of yesteryear, ever had the unfortunate mishap of riding in a Ford (oh no, not Ford again!) ‘matatu’ (passenger van/minibus) to Lunga Lunga in Nairobi. How these ramshackle matatus even passed the supposedly rigorous Kenyan Public Service Vehicle (PSV) inspection baffles me! The driver always welded a long, heavy metal rod that he would use to knock the engine back to its senses if the matatu decided to stall on the road, much like a jockey’s leather whip! I decided that I had to get to Philadelphia but I would use the back roads, where the speed limits were lower and the rental car would be moving close to the posted speed limits instead of getting into the highway and being at the risk of inconveniencing or worse, coming too close for comfort to a 18 wheeler Mack truck or two! I also had to drop the hitchhikers to Lebanon. I changed my GPS map settings to ‘avoid highways and tolls’ and off I went, flashers on (driving on ‘d’ ‘drive’ but the car felt like it’s on ‘2’ or ‘S’ on the transmission) quickly exiting the highway at the next highway exit with a few 18 wheelers barreling hard behind me!\n\nI dropped off the lass at her place in Lebanon at about 8.00 am, the same exact time the rental was supposed to be in Philadelphia. She was very relieved to be finally home and wished me all the best in resolving my predicament. I hobbled to the next address on my Ford Focus rental and dropped off the next lad. The other lad realized that he would be better off in Philadelphia as he was heading to a place called Easton, PA. (on the Pennsylvania -New Jersey border) He intended to save his friend a trip to Harrisburg from Lebanon later on in the day. I figured that, since I was in car trouble anyway, I might as well keep his company, as anything, like encountering excited members of the Aryan Brotherhood or the Ku Klux Klan, could happen in the rural back roads on Pennsylvania, where Trump voters voted for him 100%! These ‘Kaburus’ (colonialists) didn’t take any chances in the 2016 elections!\n\nThe ‘check engine’ light soon came on, as if I hadn’t realized that there was something wrong with the car all along prior to that. ‘No biggie’, I told myself. For many ma-sufferer, myself included, a permanent check engine light is a permanent fixture on the vehicles we own, ‘assuring’ you that things are not too bad, that at least the car has the same usual problems and no new ones! It’s like a allergy sufferer who knows that they have an allergy but go on with their normal lives as long as they avoid the causes of the allergy. In fact, when it goes off, then you become worried as you know that something other than the usual wear and tear is taking place! When the ‘check engine’ light blinks on your dashboard, then you know you have run out of luck! A few minutes later, the ‘transmission overheating’ light came on and warned me to stop. This pricked up my ears. I had never seen this light before! This Ford was truly a lemon, the kind of car only a sadistic and unscrupulous used car salesman would offload on you! I pulled over at a restaurant parking lot to allow the transmission to cool and in the meantime, decided to catch a 1 hour nap as I was now getting exhausted.\n\nAt 10.00 am, 1 hour later, I begrudgingly woke up. We got back into the rural roads and trudged along. We were now passing horse buggy country. We saw a number of horse buggies which were being used by Amish families. Dressed in their Sunday best, the Amish families were riding to their respective churches. Maybe I should have hired a horse for this trip, I mused. Horses don’t have transmission problems, do they? Just a bale of hay, dangling a juicy carrot in front of the horse and a bucket of water and off you trot to your destination!\n\nIn rural Pennsylvania, drivers are very patient. I had my flashers on but no one other than the occasional impatient driver was passing me. We laughed at the long lines that were forming behind us. I think they understood that we are in car trouble. I knew this driver courtesy would end when we got to the mean streets of Philadelphia!\n\nWe stopped for gas at a gas station. An old white man with a long beard strode towards me. He was dressed in khakis, cowboy hat, suspenders and some well worn boots. Just like a leading villain character in a cowboy western movie. This ‘msakhulu’ (old man) looked like he had attended all Trump rallies within a 400 mile radius, belligerently chanting ‘lock her up’ and ‘build that wall’! He looked like he had pushed that election voting button twice! In these parts of Pennsylvania, Trump won by a landslide! You would have thought that the results represented rural Alabama! The map was completely red. They came out to vote for Trump almost to a man, like voters in Bondo for Raila Odinga (Kenya’s opposition leader, former prime minister and 2017 presidential candidate) or Gatundu for Uhuru Kenyatta! (Kenyan president) The tyranny of numbers was at play here! It was ‘kûrangîra ûthamaki’ (protecting the king/crown) US edition! The only song on heavy rotation here, similar to Onyi Jalamo’s song ‘NASA Tibim’ was ‘Trump Tibim, Trump tialala!’ The old man was either the owner or gas attendant, or both. He came to the driver’s side and asked me in a somewhat irritated voice, ‘what can I do for you?’ I answered him back and let him know that I needed gas. I gave him my bank card and my zip code and he ambled to the gas pump. ‘The card has been declined’, he sort of retorted. I knew I had money in my bank account but this day was turning into those kinds of days where everything goes wrong! Did he shoot me a dirty look? Fortunately, my friend and co-driver had some cash with him and salvaged the situation. ‘Darn Obama supporters’ he probably muttered under his breath!\n\nSoon thereafter, we stopped over at a Dunkin’ Donuts shop for a much needed bathroom break and buy a soda in the process. As we exited the car, a Caucasian man we met at the parking lot asked me, ‘where are you from originally?’ This question puzzled me as he had not heard us speak prior to that. I said ‘Kenya’. ‘Jambo rafiki,’ (hello friend) he greeted us! I said ‘jambo’ to him too. He said, ‘najua kidogo tu, kwaheri!’ (I can only speak a few words, goodbye!) and he promptly drove off. How did he know we were Kenyan? He definitely had been to Kenya before and lived there, I surmised. I wondered whether it was my/our unique features that had stood out. Maybe it was time to lighten my skin, or ‘toa tint’ (‘remove’ the tint) as it is known in Kenya. I could probably blend in with a lighter skin tone! A few months back, a lad coming back from Kenya brought me some Kenyan made soaps which I have been using nostalgically. There is nothing like the manly smell of Lifebuoy body soap! Maybe I should have sent him to get me a bar of cake soap, which is talked about in hushed tones in ‘toa tint’ circles as the soap that will make you lighter than Michael Jackson, the 2000s Michael Jackson, not the 1960s one! However, I decided that ‘kutoa tint’ was not worth it. This was after I saw the disastrous results on one lad known as Khaligraph Jones! This lad, also known as Brian Ouko or ‘Ndugu Omolo’ decided to lighten his skin tone a shade or three. This JaKayole (man from Kayole) has a more American twang than a hardcore Brooklyn born and raised rap artist! He had unsuccessfully tried to get the light skin tone of ‘General Defao’, the Congolese maestro but he is instead looking like ‘Bozi Boziana’, another Congolese maestro, who is a tone or two darker than Defao! This lad had not been briefed well by experts in the skin complexion/tone change field and had lightened his face but forgot to lighten his hands too. His face has a Huddah Monroe (Kenyan socialite) tone but his hands look like Akothee’s hands! (Kenyan lady singer) His knuckles look like those of a seasoned coal miner! He attempted to explain it away on TV by claiming that his new skin tone was due to drinking mineral water, living and eating well and having facials. If this was the criteria for getting a lighter skin tone, how come people like Eddie Murphy, Wesley Snipes, Morris Chestnut, Idris Elba, Djimon Hounsou, Michael Jordan and other chocolate complexioned gentlemen didn’t have lighter skin complexions after having lived well and drank mineral water?\n\nHe should have got advice from Vera Sidika, the voluptuous Kenyan socialite cum video vixen! She clearly bleached every inch of her body, based on the salacious nudes that her Nigerian ex-boyfriend released and were (and still are) doing the rounds on Kenyan social media and WhatsApp! This cowardly ‘oga’ (Nigerian ‘master’) proved that hell hath no fury than a Naija (Nigerian) scorned! By the way, who ‘pulled it off’ better? Vera Sidika or Amber Rose? I am team Vera Sidika any day!\n\nWe then entered Dunkin’ Donuts, bought a soda each and the Indian lady asked us, ‘where are you from?’ It seemed like asking someone their national origin was the norm in rural Pennsylvania. They probably can spot a foreigner or outsider a mile away. I said ‘Kenya’ for the second time in a span of 2 minutes. ‘Where?’ she asked again, looking confused. I asked her, ‘Do you know where Barack Obama’s father is from? Kenya!’ She blushed and said ‘yes’ meekly. That has always been my ace card. If someone doesn’t know where I am from or doesn’t recognize Kenya, I name-drop the Obama name! It works every time! That Fanta orange felt so refreshing!\n\nWhile driving through rural Pennsylvania at between 30-40 miles per hour, I saw a phone call at 11.43 am. Lately, I have been getting a lot of ‘bot calls’ from con artists claiming that ‘you owe the IRS thousands of dollars,’ so I don’t pick up unknown numbers anymore. The scam artists rarely leave voice messages. This caller called twice and left a voice message. And a text message.\n\nAt 12.00 noon, we approached the Philadelphia suburbs. The ‘transmission overheating’ light came back on and we decided to stop so that the car could cool down once again. During the ‘transmission cooling’ break, I decided to check my phone to find out who was calling and texting. It was\n\nthe ‘Philly rent a wreck’ owner! She wanted to know what was up with the rental. I called her back and told her of the predicament I was facing. She apologized for the inconvenience. She quickly asked me to open up the hood and look for the transmission oil dipstick. ‘It might need more transmission fluid’, she said. I almost laughed out loud but held my horses! This wasn’t a problem that would be solved by adding transmission fluid! This was a ‘replace transmission’ problem, if not worse! I had turned from car renter to auto mechanic. I looked for the dipstick for a while but couldn’t find any. She then quickly informed me that she had googled the engine of the particular rental we had and it has an electric transmission engine and has no dipstick! She informed me that that’s why they, as a company, were getting away from Ford cars for their fleets. A tad too late for this insightful information, I sighed!\n\nThe car rental company owner urged me to drive the car slowly and let her know when the car was back at the rental parking lot and wished me a safe ride. She promised to refund all the rental fees due to the inconvenience. I guess every cloud has a silver lining. I wondered if the car rental company owner was only (or should I say mostly) concerned about her car, and not my well being and safety…\n\nIt was past 1.00 pm and we were hungry, really hungry. We hadn’t eaten anything since the Kenyan Madaraka day feast the previous day and the hunger pangs were gnawing. After texting the person whose project I was undertaking and telling him that I was having some rental car trouble and would be way late for our meeting, we decided to go to an African restaurant at the request of my co-driver who had weathered the long jerky drive with me. After having fish and plantain, I dropped him off at the bus station for him to catch the bus. Once I dropped him off, I decided that the car rental return would have to wait and I needed to complete my overdue Sunday project. I decided to instead drive to the project venue using back roads and the rental car continued lurching, sometimes uncontrollably. A short trip that would have taken 20 minutes took an entire hour! Once I arrived at my project destination, the dashboard looked like a Christmas tree due to all the lights that were on! I shut the car off and went to complete my project.\n\nAbout 4 or so hours later, I was finally and thankfully done with my project and it was time to return the rental. It was approaching 8.00 pm and the much awaited game 2 of the NBA finals between the Warriors and the Cavaliers was about to be televised live. I grated my teeth, knowing full well that the rental car would run slowly towards the car rental return offices. I went into the car and started it. ‘Chogiogiogio, vroom.’ I put the transmission in reverse, then put the transmission in drive and then got ready for the agonizing jerky journey back. I pulled out of the driveway, ready to get onto the road. Amazingly, there were no noises! The transmission was working perfectly. It was shifting gears smoothly like it was off the factory lot! It was as if the 12 hour nightmare that the rental car had taken me through was fictional! After the car had dragged me through all those trials and tribulations, the transmission had finally decided to stop acting up! I was however not sold by the new developments. I figured that the transmission would act up once the car was on the road. However the car continued driving perfectly! I was in shock and disbelief! No way! How? Why now? Did someone make a voodoo doll of my rental car and had finally stopped torturing and pricking the car doll with needles? I decided to gamble and take the car to the highway, the fastest route to the car rental return offices. The car drove normally at 60 miles per hour! It was gliding effortlessly over the tarmac, nyweeeeeee! The car had teased me with a broken transmission for most of my return trip and then this! Saitan! They say that the devil is a liar but he also has a wicked sense of humor. For those who come from Central Kenya, when the devil has decided to spend some time with you and put your life in turmoil, we say ‘daimono anjagagîtie ta mbîya îrî kînya!’ (The devil has decided to make my life tumultuous like a mouse in an African cooking pot!) I returned the car to the car rental place and got into their drop-off shuttle. LeBron and Cleveland was just about to battle Kevin Durant and Golden State. I started watching the game on my phone, grateful at least that the nightmare was finally over!\n\nI wondered if there was any lesson/s to be learned from my mostly unfortunate car rental experience. Should I have gone with a reputable car rental company? Not rent from a company known as ‘Philadelphia rent a wreck.’ Insisted on a foreign car brand whose chances of leaving me on the road would be minimal as compared to the locally manufactured car? Purchased roadside assistance? Used my jalopy to go to Harrisburg? How was I to know that the transmission would act up and then stop acting up at the conclusion of the rental? Well, that folks, is what fate is all about!\n\nI vowed to myself that I would never rent a Ford ever after this nightmare. Exactly 2 weeks later, I found myself in Seattle where I was slated to run a marathon. I got to the Avis car hire station and the gentleman greeted me warmly. “Mr ‘I can’t pronounce your name’, your car is at the parking lot down the elevator. It is a silver Ford Focus!!!” I said a quick prayer for journey mercies…\n\nMatumbo Na Kafirifiri\n\n*Disclaimer. All names used in this dossier are fictional and do not depict any living or dead persons. Parental Advisory. Material may contain adult themes and abusive language.\n\nThe prolific Kenyan novelist Ngugi Wa Thiong’o in one of his numerous critically acclaimed and award winning books astutely wrote that, ‘a man without food is like a radio without batteries’. Food is very important to a man. As an extrapolation, to a man, the best cooking is his mother’s cooking, no matter where he travels or how well traveled and/or exposed to the world he is. After furiously suckling on his mother’s breasts as a baby, the semi-solid and later on, solid food that his mother feeds him is the first real connection that he has of this world, the first thing that is etched on his mind. You have seen babies and toddlers use their mouths to taste everything on sight as they explore and discover their world. When you see some of these grown men, for example, amongst others, Donald Trump, Kabogo aka ‘Kafogothary’, Waititu, (instant justice styro hiyo hiyo) Sonko and Keter (of the Gilgil weigh station ‘matapaka’ fame) spitting fire and brimstone, you would never imagine that they were once helpless babies that suckled on their mother’s breasts. In ‘Things Fall Apart’, Chinua Achebe scribed that, ‘looking at the king’s mouth, one would think he never sucked at his mother’s breast’. Food signifies comfort, which signifies security. That is why people binge on food when they are feeling bad about something in an attempt to erase the bad feeling! Chocolate and a feel-good movie on Netflix anyone? So engraved in his brain (and DNA) is this cooking by his mother that nothing erases this taste or memory of food. Some may argue that it’s not the same thing but the Japanese have a name for it, a sixth sense of sorts, ‘umami’!\n\nUmami can be loosely translated as a ‘sweet savory taste’ that is different from and a fifth addition to the four tastes of food, sweetness, sourness, saltiness and bitterness. Umami is the taste that a millionaire ‘feels’ or experiences when he or she ravenously tears into a slice of platinum Kobe beef from Japan, where the spoiled cows are fed on the best grass, given bottled beer to relax, hand massaged by ninja-like Japanese farmers and even have classical music played to them to enable them eventually produce the best marbled beef! How one can give a cow expensive bottled beer instead of drinking it himself or herself is a concept a Kenyan would never understand, but these are the perfectionist Japanese! To add insult to injury, I hear these farmers from the Land Of The Rising Sun give these cows a true stout, Guinness! An Irishman would shudder at this very thought of his national pride and joy being quaffed mindlessly by a cow! The poor bovine, feeling good about drinking beer, listening to Beethoven, Mozart and Bach and getting massaged, happily skips away in the fields of the Hyōgo Prefecture, singing, or is it mooing ‘I’m so dirunk baiby’ like Kristoff and Gabu, as it fattens up only to be inevitably felled by the butcher’s cleaver! ‘Wembe ni ule ule!’ (The blade is always the same!) The same Japanese also hype up ‘umami’ by selling incredulously thin slices of raw fish wrapped in seaweed and a few grains of rice and put a 1000% markup on it by calling it ‘sushi’! Can you imagine a Kenyan farmer in Kieni, Nyeri county giving his cows prized ‘muratina’ to drink? Wasting alcohol on cows is sheer madness I tell you! The only time I have seen cows, or rather bulls being given alcohol is in Luhya-land where the bulls engaged in the bullfights in Kakamega are given an optimum amount of ‘busaa’ – a traditional fermented alcoholic drink- (and some whisper, maybe it is common knowledge, that the busaa is laced with bhang – marijuana) to give them the courage to fearlessly gore each other, as they are egged on by people dancing to the catchy and effusive sounds of the ‘isukuti’ drums! Now, that’s good use of alcohol! No wonder those bullfights are legendary! An already angry bull infused with busaa and bhang is menacingly feisty like Kakamega senator Bonny Khalwale!\n\nThat ‘umami’ is what, as a lady searching for, or aiming to keep a man, you should be keenly concerned about! Let me explain…\n\nMany men in Kenya grew up in relatively modest surroundings. Most of them were ‘ma-sufferer’, the hoi polloi. Dirty little boys with patched shorts and torn shoes (if they were lucky enough to own a pair) that were ‘laughing’ (and badly needed to be sewn back by a cobbler) after being endlessly used to play football (soccer to my American folk) with a football/soccer ball made out of plastic bags (paper bags) and tied up with sisal or nylon strings. They happily raced each other up and down the hills and plains, carefree, with thick or runny mucus running down their noses and mouths. A sorry plight to see and behold, so you would think, but unbridled joy was in the air! They went to modest schools and their parents worked modest jobs and their earnings were modest. At the end of the day, the food brought to the table was not palatial but modest. A vegetable diet was cheaper than a carnivorous diet and many meals in Kenyan homes consisted of ugali (maize meal/cornmeal) and sukuma wiki. (Kale) This was interspersed with days where maize (corn) and beans dominated the dinner table. Eating beans everyday meant that you passed gas every day! That is why Kenyans are experts in passing gas; silently! Therefore, as ‘bad’ as those meals seemed to those young boys then and as much as they aspired to dig their milk teeth into well done sirloin steaks every evening, they subsisted on a mostly vegan diet by circumstance, not by choice. With the benefit of hindsight, a vegan diet was the best thing that could have happened to them as it staved off the various diseases caused by eating meat, if vegans are to be believed. Some of these vegetables these boys ate are now known as ‘superfoods’, for example ‘sukuma wiki’, (kale) sweet potatoes and onions.\n\nAfter eating maize and beans all month, end month would draw nigh. The parents of the youngsters would get paid and for a few days, maybe a full week, meat, like a list A celebrity, would make a brief cameo appearance into the diet. The first day would consist of one or two small prime choice cuts but, as the rent, school fees, payments to the local shops and kiosks (‘mama mboga’ and ‘mama pima’) for debts incurred by goods taken on credit and other expenses gobbled up the little earnings, back to vegetables it was. Therefore, the parents got clever and creative. Just like the enslaved Black people in the Americas for centuries had cobbled together pieces of meat thrown away by their masters and made what is now known as soul food, adventurous Kenyans bought ‘matumbo’ or tripe to sneak in some sort of meat into the diet. Back in the day, some communities used the cow, goat or sheep intestines to make ‘mutura’ or ‘blood sausage’ and still do upto this day. Originally, I imagine that the butchers probably threw the innards of the cow away but decided to start selling them as they realized that the cow intestines were insanely popular! The cow intestines, green after holding the cow’s cud, found their way into Kenyan kitchens and kitchenettes and what was hitherto eaten secretly became popular and later even found its way into local and mainstream Kenyan restaurants. ‘Matumbo’ could be bought cheaper than regular meat and it was therefore used to bridge the gap between the end of the month when you could eat ‘real’ meat and the rest of the vegan days. So, ‘matumbo’ was a delicacy, not eaten daily but eaten often enough to be etched in memory as a delicacy. So, subconsciously, the love of ‘matumbo’ began. It was somehow within reach, like a down-to-earth pretty village girl who goes to a boarding school during the school term or semester and comes home for holidays every now and then who you could talk to. ‘Matumbo’ is tough and chewy in its raw and semi-cooked state and for some, has a bitter taste. Therefore, ingenious ways had to be sought out to make the ‘matumbo’ palatable, and/or even delicious, after it was cut into small pieces. This is where the chillies, or ‘kafirifiri’, come in. The ‘matumbo’ needed to be cooked well to lose some of its chewy and rubbery texture. Not all of it, just some. It also needed to be spiced up to mask some of its intense intestine or gamey flavor. So, young boys, from Mandera to Magadi, from Malaba to Malindi, from Mbita to Mtwapa craved and enjoyed this delicacy. It is the one true meal that crosses community lines and cannot be pinned to a particular community. ‘Uhunye’ and ‘Agwambo’ (Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga, Kenya’s current president and opposition leader respectively) can partake of ‘matumbo’ and ‘kafirifiri’ respectively without asking why they are not being served their indigenous food!\n\nIf, as a man, you go to Mombasa in search of work, you may just be lovestruck and you shall be subjected to a dangerous trifecta of biriani, whippy lovemaking and jinn! This phenomenon is known as ‘Hadija hapendi’! As people are accusing you of being ensnared by the diabolical jinn, you’ll be filling your stomach with, in addition to the biriani, (Indian mixed rice dish with spices, rice and meat and/or vegetables) the lovely dishes of mahamri (African donuts cooked with coconut oil) na kitoweo cha mchuzi uliopikwa na kitunguu saumu, (and stew cooked with garlic) pilau or wali wa nazi (coconut rice) and fish slathered in coconut oil! These women ‘throw it down’! Envious and jittery women from upcountry, ‘wake wa bara’ retort that that is the work of evil, powerful, demonic jinn. It must be jinn that make their men rush home from work instead of going to bars straight into the hands of barmaids and women of the night, they ruefully muse. However, if they observed keenly, there are a couple of differences in the food presented to their respective husbands. There is also the small issue of being welcomed home with open arms and a smile after laboring hard, scorched by the hot sun and almost asphyxiated by the humid air at the Kenya Ports Authority warehouses, with the sweet relaxing words of ‘mume wangu, karibu nyumbani. Pole kwa kazi’ spoken in the rich alluring accent of ‘Kiswahili cha Mvita’ -Kiswahili from the place called Mvita- (My husband, welcome home and ‘sorry’ for working/being worked hard’) Another forgotten issue is the hot bucket of water, ‘Lifebuoy’ soap and pumice stone waiting for the man to clean himself off of the layer of cement dust of Bamburi Cement! One husband is arriving to the inviting aroma of pilau rice, rich brown in color with curried stew, whilst the other one is arriving home to rice as white as the sheets at Coast General Hospital or the Ku Klux Klan! The stew has been boiled and the one or two pieces of meat are swimming alone and uneasily amongst a litany of disintegrated potatoes (or what is left of them after hard boiling) like a black #blacklivesmatter protestor in a Trump political rally in Alabama! How can a lass complain that she needs her life spiced up and doesn’t have or add any single spice ingredient into the food she prepares for her darling?! In addition, the upcountry women are notorious for not minding matters of the bedroom and just laying down there, missionary style, also known as ‘kifo cha mende’. The Mombasa woman knows better and puts the moves seen in ‘Taarabu’ music to good use, bending and gyrating her ‘fundamendoz’ or ‘nyash’ or behind rhythmically, as if following the captivating beat of a Miji Kenda drummer! Chini kwa chini, juu kwa juu! (Down down, up, up!) Those two shall be inseparable, ‘kama chanda na pete! (Like a finger and ring!) So, upcountry women, it is not jinn that makes men stick to coastal women. The devil is in the details!\n\nDr. Noah Wekesa, a full-blooded Bukusu, a man from the community where an elder is buried sitting down, married a white woman of his stature and station in life. Their marriage brought forth Paul Wekesa, the former accomplished Kenyan tennis player. He lived in the leafy suburbs of Nairobi and was (and still is) an accomplished veterinary doctor and politician. To assist with the children, he brought a young damsel, not quite sixteen, from the outskirts of Webuye to assist with household chores. What better plan than to have a maid from ‘litala’ or ‘olukongo’, the village, one who understands the Bukusu customs. After a while, something happened. Maybe the hitherto disheveled girl who previously used to bathe in Nzoia River with bar soap, started showering in a marble tiled bathroom, lathering her ‘elidako’ or posterior with the lady of the house’s ‘Cussons Imperial Leather’ soap, maybe ‘Rexona’. She probably discovered the scintillating oils of ‘Lady Gay’ or probably learned how to ‘toa tint’ or lighten ones’ skin tone a shade or two or even ten by using ‘Clear Tone’, maybe ‘Ambi’. Maybe she started using the wife’s ‘Yolanda’ perfume, maybe started wearing some of her employer’s dresses when she wasn’t around. Maybe it is the pressure of an African man to have an African wife. The reasons remain moot. The doctor’s marriage was in disarray! The cause; he was having relations with his house girl! As Grammy winning crooner Seal scornfully and bluntly puts it with regard to his former flame/wife Heidi Klum, Dr Wekesa was fornicating with the help! Khandi! Wow! This is probably the ‘worst’ kind of betrayal by a philandering spouse. If a questionnaire existed of ranking the worst form of cheating, this would rank at the very bottom, (or is it the very top?) probably labeled ‘not at all satisfied’ or ‘disgusting’ with one star!!! Even Arnold Schwarzenegger fornicated with the help!Fornicate with someone else, not with the lowly help!!! His house girl was now the madam of the huge mansion! She was the Oga (or it it Oga-ress) at the top! Having come home to the sparse and occasional western cooking from his white wife, the house help had whipped him his favorite dishes that nostalgically reminded him of his youth as he ran up and down the Malakisi Falls and was called to lunch and supper by his mum! The simple but all important ritual of serving the man his favorite food had resulted in the unthinkable! The overthrowing by an African house help of a white wife! This is a feat that few mistresses are able to accomplish. ‘Clandes’ or clandestine lovers, dream of that day when they rise up from number 2 (or 3 or 4) to number 1! Okot p’Bitek in his well written, world famous narrative poem book, ‘Song Of Lawino’, describes how Lawino’s husband, Ocol, the son of the tribal leader of their Acoli (Acholi) community has taken another wife, Clementine, who is educated and acts European. Ocol shuns Lawino, his first wife, in favour of Clementine. Ocol is also said to be fascinated with the culture of the European colonialists and is enchanted by his ‘sophisticated’ wife who couldn’t work in the village. I think the Bukusu, just like Ocol, have a thing for these ‘sophisticated’ foreign women, or maybe the prowess of the Bukusu stands out. Remember the captivating love story of ‘My Bukusu darling’? Timothy Khamala did the unimaginable and wooed and seduced the kama sutra out of Sarika Patel, an Indian lady. It was one on one between him and the Indian seductress, ‘omundu khu mundu’! In the beginning, everything was blissful. The Luhya man ate roti, palak paneer and channa dal but after a while craved for mrenda, (jute leaves) obusuma (corn/maize meal) and ingokho! (chicken) Maybe the Indian lady was vegetarian and was asking the Bukusu man to turn vegan. Asking a Luhya man to abandon eating ‘ingokho’ is like asking the Pope to become Hindu! Namaste, Not! The Indian lady forgot the cardinal rule of a man! A man’s heart is through his stomach. Cooking spicy curry and naan was not the answer! Not long term anyway. After all, this food was foreign to him. The novelty wore off and he craved his ‘omushenye’, (a mixture of boiled beans and boiled sweet potatoes) ‘omunyobo’ (fine mashed roasted monkey nuts) and ‘amabere amasatse’. (sour milk) Telling a full blooded man about filet mignon is an exercise in futility; you might as well be saying ‘fill me with minyoo’!\n\nRemember the movie Ratatouille? It’s a cartoon/animated movie but as you know, these animated movies can afford to be brutally honest without being shackled by political correctness. The movie depicts France’s top restaurant critic, Anton Ego, eating ratatouille soup created by Remy the rat which brings back to the astonished Ego memories of his mother’s cooking as a young boy and rocked him to the core!\n\nThe Vietnamese eat various insects as a delicacy, including the feared hairy tarantula! During the Vietnam war, food was scarce and the locals turned to eating insects for sustenance and sometimes survival. The war has ended and has been over for decades but their tastes adjusted and they eat these insects as a delicacy. So, out of necessity and survival, a habit, a food ‘invention’ is born.\n\nIf you are a sufferer who went to Gikambura primary school in Kiambu cownty, sorry, county or Onjiko in Kisumu county, there are certain meals you partook out of necessity. A Kikuyu man clad in a ‘Godfather’ cowboy hat, Savco brand jeans and cowboy boots can have numerous plots of land scattered countrywide in Lamu, Limuru, Lodwar and Lokichoggio but if he ate boiled beans, maize and potatoes as a naughty little rascal, the man shall want to sit down once in a while and eat the overcooked boiled beans, maize and potatoes, just like dear Mama made them.\n\nLook at hayati (the late) Mutula Kilonzo. This ‘mutumia’, man, kept a whole range of carnivores and had two cheetahs called ‘Ocampo’ and ‘Mutula’ in his Kwa Kyelu ranch and three lions, ‘Mutula’, ‘Nduku’ and ‘Sis’! You know you’ve made it when you name a lion and cheetah after yourself! He fed them real meat and spent a fortune, (allegedly Kshs 700,000, about US$ 7,000 a month!) thus negating the act of ‘nyemelearing’, stealthy stalking of prey, by the lions. These lions were well fed. They did not need to escape their enclosure in search of food like the poor lions that were unfortunately roaming in the streets of Nairobi and were shot by Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) park rangers. Amongst the lions shot recently was a lion called ‘Mohawk’ who was an international attraction, not quite as famous as Cecil the lion in Zimbabwe but he had a black mane. So, a famously wealthy politician keeps lions in his farm/ranch and feeds them good meat. There is an ironic fateful twist; but alas, rumor has it that he was felled by a deadly concoction of ‘muthokoi’ (meal made from de-husked maize/corn) and viagra! His boyhood instincts had kicked in and he just needed a ‘muthokoi’ fix! This was to be his undoing! Had he eaten meat like fellow senior citizens do, or as his lions did, then he would not have succumbed. Note to all viagra users; don’t use viagra with ‘muthokoi’, ‘githeri’ and meals laden with lots of maize/corn and beans. I think there is a chemical in these beans and maize/corn that doesn’t work well with viagra!\n\nA man from the Lakeside shall demand fish with the head and more importantly, the eye, intact. Serving a descendant of the Jok a Jok, Jok Awiny or Jok Amolo fish without a head is reasons for an urgent referendum! We have seen Luo men having got a bachelors degree from Makerere in Uganda, a Masters from Oxford in the UK and to crown it all, a PHD from Harvard University in the US, bellow out in impeccable Queen’s English as he requests, more like demands, for his favorite ‘mbuta’, (Nile Perch fish) ‘kuon bel’ (ugali, corn/maize meal made with brown millet) and ‘athola’, (roast beef) to be washed down with expensive tots of Hennessy or Jameson, those drinks which rappers and hip hop artists brag about in their songs and videos!\n\nThe Kenyan ladies who are getting coy with Nigerian men in a callous and brazen attempt to ‘chop’ their dubiously earned Naira and dollars, are learning quickly that an Igbo man needs to eat his fufu (cassava meal) and egusi soup. (yellowish soup based on melon seeds) Serving him exotic Kenyan cuisine works for a while but the man is more interested in eating fufu than he is in eating ugali! Even an expansive and callipygian derrière and the extraordinary bleaching of the skin shall not save the Kenyan ladies from the chopping block once the Naija man is done chopping them. If these foods keep missing from the menu, then the confused lady will eventually keep missing from his life! All that is needed is a clever replacement that can familiarize themselves with a Nigerian chopping board to cook these dishes!\n\nA certain Wambui Wamae Kamiru has struck a lottery jackpot by marrying her darling, aka ‘kihiki understanding’, Bob Collymore aka Bob Call Me More! (Or is it Bob Con Me More!) Ka-Ching! Imagine the hordes of dejected women in Nairobi, wondering how a ‘sponsor’ creme de la creme had escaped! ‘Aliponyoka’! Imagine a sponsor of Collymore’s magnitude, the top Kenyan corporate glad-hander! It had to be a ‘msapere’ lady, a woman from the slopes (srippery sropes) who could pull out such a heist! Heist of the century! From Kirinyaga to boot! Only a woman from (the former) Central Province could ensnare and snag the wealthiest and most eligible ‘bachelor’ in Kenya! These ladies ‘ni moto wa kuotea mbali’, ‘fire whose heat is enjoyed from afar and not close’! Even CORD principal and Bungoma Senator Wetang’ula can bear witness to these Wangu Wa Makeris! ‘Weta’ is the first Bukusu on record to be beaten by a woman! His wife, Ann Waceke Ngugi Wetang’ula ‘Nyerified’ him, that is pummeled him at their Karen home until he sought refuge in Lang’ata police station and recorded a police statement. Ali-nyekhwa! Luhyas take beatings very seriously! Wakoli wa Bwifoli, doyen of Luhya politics, has thundered that Wetang’ula had better kiss his dreams of living and governing in State House, Nairobi goodbye, as a Luhya man cannot be taken seriously and thus cannot lead the country as president after being beaten by a woman! Clearly, Wakoli wa Bwifoli hasn’t encountered a Nyeri woman!\n\nBack to the new Mrs. Collymore; that lady has done all the necessary mathematical, psychological and physiological calculations that pertain to that marriage! Collymore thought he had won her over but he had the ‘joker’ card, she had the ‘ace’ card. ‘Alikuwa amekachora!’ She has calculated that, despite what I assume is a tightly knit airtight pre-nup, hobnobbing as Mrs Collymore was well worth the effort! Apart from free airtime and unlimited ‘bundles’ of data, a cashload of Mpesa and a few differently colored Range Rover luxury SUVs to match her differently colored daily outfits, imagine the (sponsoring of, legally this time) mansions, condos, first class plane and yacht/cruise ship rides, shopping in the glamorous exquisite designer shops in Milan, Dubai and Los Angeles, wining and dining in the world’s finest restaurants and so on and so forth! There are many salacious and scandalous stories flying around concerning (former) Ms Kamiru’s first marriage, the alleged abandonment of her children, (Kikuyu women never abandon their children, so people are alleging that she doesn’t want to bring the little brats into her new home as baggage! Ahem!) an alleged abusive husband who was initially being spoiled by gifts allegedly bought by Collymore himself and the alleged ‘nyemelearing’ (stalking) by the CEO himself! Collymore was also married to a white woman in the UK and they have a daughter. As to whether both Kamiru and Collymore had ended their relationships to their respective spouses before tangoing with each other, no one really knows! Kumbe (so) Bob Collymore was a team ‘Mafisi’ member, (unashamed skirt-chaser) roaming freely without paying hefty roaming charges?! Please do tell, how can you, as an ordinary man, compete with probably Kenya’s wealthiest CEO? As Chinua Achebe wrote in ‘Things Fall Apart’ Okonkwo told a man who had no titles that ‘this is a meeting for men’. Unfortunately, Ms. Kamiru’s former husband, Joseph Kinyua cruelly realized that he was powerless against the behemoth Collymore! Poor him! The Swahili have a proverb that states ‘mwenye nguvu mpishe.’ (Pave way for the strong one.)\n\nThis story deserves another blog by itself but I’ll stick to the issue at hand; food. This bourgeois CEO has proclaimed that he doesn’t like Kenyan food, much to the chagrin of Kenyans! So, Mrs Collymore, please don’t stress yourself ‘ukipiganisha masufuria’, clanking the pots and pans together cooking ‘mukimo’ (meal made from mashed potatoes with green vegetables) ‘irio’ (mashed dry beans and potatoes) and ‘njahi’ (black beans with potatoes) As you can see, no Kikuyu meal is complete without potatoes! He seems to like Indian food, spicy stuff that was made by his grandmother in his native Guyana and later on by his mother in London. If you don’t cook Indian and Asian cuisine bii (madam) Kamiru, Bobby Collymore shall go offline faster than you can say ‘mteja’ (customer) and all you shall hear is a busy signal! I wish the newlywed couple all the best and I hope none of them shall roam from now henceforth and shall stick to their home network!\n\nIf you have seen Kenyans go back to Kenya for holidays in December, the ‘summer bunnies’, wearing the latest NFL, NBA, EPL and Baseball sports gear after having flipped burgers and washed dead bodies in the western world all year, need to feel good about themselves, momentarily run away from their sorrows and wipe off the dust of fast food joints, hospitals and morgues! You will realize that, despite their temporary opulence and the need to show off their dollars and Euros to all and sundry whilst boosting the Kenyan economy, they cannot resist to partake in the ritual that is ‘chips mwitu’ (street french fries) and ‘mayai gonga’!(street fried eggs) Back in the day, not too long ago, (it still happens up to today) after exiting the clubs in Kenya in the ungodly hours of 5, 6 or 7 am, especially Florida 2000, there were mobile/traveling chefs who whipped up a salacious and delicious meal of ‘chips mwitu’ and ‘mayai gonga’.These chips may or may not have been fried with oil pried or siphoned off a transformer! Maybe that’s why they tasted so electrifying! They had a certain zing to them! Finger-licking good! How one decides to steal oil from a live electric transformer transmitting thousands of volts is something I’ll never understand. It is a sure death warrant, similar to jumping out of a plane in the sky without a parachute! I would rather join the devilish illuminati than climb up there! There were no ‘Kanjo’ (Nairobi City Council) ‘askaris’ (guards/attendants) or inspectors to harass and scatter these mobile chefs. I suspect that someone in Nairobi City Hall had his or her hands greased to turn a blind eye to the ‘illegal’ cooking going on. Be that as it may, as a Kenyan living in Kenya, there were usually no side effects when you ate the ‘chips mwitu’ and ‘mayai gonga’.\n\nHowever, once you came to the ‘ndayathipora’ (diaspora) aka ‘majuu’ aka the West, the tough enzymes that prevented you from getting sick were cleaned out of your system and left you as vulnerable as a Nairobian face to face with a runaway lion! So, these ‘summer bunnies’ know that they shall get a serious bout of diarrhea when they eat the ‘chips mwitu’ and ‘mayai gonga’ but they do it nevertheless. It is the nostalgia they are after! The carefree days when you could go clubbing for days with no sleep and nary a headache! As long as you have ‘Eno’ fruit salt stomach relief medication with you, you are set. Talking of enzymes, for those Kenyans who live in the diaspora and are scared of biochemical warfare especially when the crazed terrorists release anthrax spores into the atmosphere, do not worry! If you have eaten meat in Kenya, you have probably eaten meat that has been affected by anthrax. Anthrax is a disease that is very common amongst cows in Kenya. The cow dies a painful death as it foams in the mouth. A cow is worth a lot of money, especially when alive, as it supplies a steady supply of milk to supplement the farmers’ income. So, a dead cow with anthrax is a nightmare. Veterinary standards demand that the cow be buried immediately in a deep hole to prevent the spreading of this contagious disease to other livestock. However, a farmer whose beloved ‘nyameni’ cow has died shall be desperate enough to collude with the local butcher named Kamau to collect the carcass late at night and have it skinned and presented as ‘nyama fresh’ the next day at the local butchery in Kiamaiko! The restaurants may also use it as a condiment for ‘boiro’, where meat and vegetables are boiled incessantly until they develop into a gooey like substance till the anthrax spores disappear. So, fellow immigrants, don’t worry. When anthrax is dispersed into the atmosphere as an attempt at chemical warfare, only the strong will survive. Strong immigrants, having been ‘vaccinated’ by eating a lot of anthrax infected meat, shall be walking proudly in the anthrax filled streets of New York, London and/or Sydney as locals succumb to the anthrax! Is that not how vaccines work?\n\nDon’t get me wrong. I know that, nowadays, everyone is busy and no one has time to do anything. Roles have also been reversed. Men are cooking more than ever, sometimes more than women themselves. However, just like you probably need to go to the gym to keep the stubborn pounds from permanently clinging onto your skeletal figure that previously survived on one large carb-free meal a day, you need to set some time to whip your man his favorite boyhood meal. Even though it is once a week or once a month, you have to keep the fire burning!\n\nHow dare I write such a stupid, condescending article full of Muhammad Ali braggadocio? Don’t shoot the messenger! Let’s turn the tables around… As a lady, do you love receiving flowers from your significant other? What about a ring on that finger? Priceless, right? The more expensive, the better, sio, right? The larger the rock, the higher the carats, the louder the ululation! Flowers, chocolate and diamonds is a conspiracy theory I tell you! Out to fleece men of their hard-earned cash! Flowers, which have been grown in cool conditions or in green houses somewhere, in fertile land which could have been better used to grow food that can be eaten by humans and feed the ever-growing global human population, wilt and wither in a few days. Chocolate is an attempt by the poor to eat (or drink) stuff that was only previously accessible to the rich. The bourgeoisie used to call it the ‘nectar of the gods’ and drank the imported chocolate from imported china from China! Diamonds are a recent clever marketing ploy by a company called De Beers, which, after finding a huge reserve of diamonds and gold in South Africa a century or two ago, came up with this heinous idea that a man should use one month’s salary/wage or a four week paycheck (maybe 2 or more months) to buy a golden ring topped with a diamond for his beloved fiancée! This engagement ring fallacy didn’t exist 300 years ago. If a man wanted a woman, all he did was declare loudly and in some communities, plant a spear at the doorstep of the ‘manyatta’ (hut) to signify he was serious about marrying the lady! Talking of lions, the manly thing to do was to kill a lion and bring its skin and head as a trophy to the smitten lass who would accompany you to your ‘manyatta’! As a lady, would you spend one month’s salary/four week paycheck on a man? Your silence answers that question. (The exception is the lady who has, in the words of the sassy and controversial Nation newspaper writer Njoki Chege, been ‘d*ckmatized’ by a man, a sexual bewitchment of sorts!)\n\nThe mining of diamonds by poor black African men in South Africa, whose proceeds are used to finance the social debauchery of the white upper class, in Africa, is one of the greatest con-jobs and ironies of mankind! Many of these men come from Lesotho and Swaziland (another irony or ironies, countries inside a country) where hordes of able bodied men leave their wives and children behind to mine diamonds, as their respective Kings enjoy their royal shenanigans by plucking (and sometimes forcefully abducting) virgin maidens in their respective annual reed dances. After tunneling deep in caves and shafts that even the proverbial canary cannot survive in, they dig and jackhammer their poor bodies into an early grave, their lungs full of soot, their bodies physically and psychologically broken beyond repair. If they are lucky to escape death in the mines, they are not usually lucky enough to escape death via lung failure. Remember the blood diamonds from West Africa, in both Sierra Leone and Liberia? The raping of Africa’s resources was done under the aegis of a civil war, with witty diamond peddlers exchanging diamonds for weapons. The people engaged in genocide as the diamonds were transported to jeweler shops in the western world to be adorned by unsuspecting maidens! I have even seen a stroke of genius, where they make chocolate-filled diamonds! It doesn’t even make sense. But men do it anyway. The rules have been set. Refuse to cater for your girl with chocolate, flowers or a 10 carat diamond and invoke the fury of the lady who is keeping up with the Joneses!\n\n‘Matumbo’ and ‘kafirifiri’ is a relatively simple meal to make. Go to the store and buy tripe, ‘matumbo’. In the stores in the West, they have thoroughly cleaned the ‘matumbo’ and the matumbo is white in color, not the green the Kenyans are used to! A little ingenuity is needed to turn the white ‘matumbo’ green, just like the man was used to having. You can soak them in chopped kale (sukuma wiki) and a little water for 24 hours to give them that green look. Once they have turned green, then it’s time for the magic to begin. There are many recipes in the internet but this one from kaluhikitchens.com takes the cake and has been tried and tested by yours truly and successful lasses everywhere who gush about and are in awe of its man-retaining abilities!\n\n⁃ Cut the ‘matumbo’/tripe into small pieces, add some water and put them to boil on a jiko or in a slow cooker/ crock pot. The longer they boil, the more tender they shall be.\n\n⁃ Once the water has reduced, add some more, together with 3/4 cup of milk (milk is optional) and fresh whole chillies. The milk absorbs some of the smell and makes them softer. You can even soak the matumbo in milk before boiling if you have the time. The chilli will add its flavor to the tripe and it will be mild.\n\n⁃ If you prefer more heat, chop up your chilli and then add it. Depending on how ‘hot’ or mild you like your chili, you can use jalapeño peppers for more heat or regular green or red peppers for very mild or no heat at all.\n\n⁃ The second round boiling with the milk and the chilli is the the most important step in building a flavor profile for this dish.\n\n⁃ cloves of garlic\n\n⁃ 1/2 kg of boiled tripe\n\n⁃ 4 tomatoes, roughly chopped\n\n⁃ Fresh coriander, finely chopped\n\n⁃ 1 1/2 tablespoon of ‘Royco’ brand or ‘Goya’ brand all spice mix\n\n⁃ 1 large red onion, diced\n\n⁃ Pound or grind your garlic cloves into a paste. Dice your onions and put these two in a ‘sufuria’ (pot) with some heated oil. Add some salt and let these saute until the are soft.\n\n⁃ Add your tomatoes and let this simmer for about 5 minutes until the are all soft. Then add your chilli infused boiled ‘matumbo’ and mix it in. Let them simmer for about 2 minutes then add your royco/Goya all spice mix.

I remembered the ‘wise’ words of the black yoga pants lady who had assuaged me into suing the owners of ‘Sheila’, the bitch that had crossed the road without a leash, causing the accident. Before suing, I wrote a demand letter to the dog owner for $1,700, the cost of repairing the car according to the quote I had received from the auto body repair shop. He ignored the demand letter and exactly 32 days later, I went to the district court and paid about $70 and wrote out a complaint and sued the dog owner. I attached a copy of the quote. I was very broke and $70 was a lot of money for me at the time but I was desperate enough to try. A few people dissuaded me from suing and wondered if I could even get a penny from the dog owner.\n\nA week or so later, I received a call from someone who introduced himself as a representative of the dog owner’s home insurance company. He let me know that he had been assigned to my case. He needed to take pictures of the car so as to assess the damage that I had claimed had happened. We met a day later and he took pictures of the car. There was a dent from a previous accident from the previous owner but I did not see the need to point that out. Once he had taken enough pictures, he told me that he would submit the pictures to the claims department and see ‘what they could do’.\n\nA week or so later, the representative called. He gave me some good news. The insurance company had agreed to settle the issue out of court and had written me a check for $1,648! I could not believe it! Just like that! I thanked him profusely for his efforts and he promised me that the check would be mailed to my address in 3 to 5 business days. Once I hung up the phone, I danced a happy dance. I needed to be patient as being a Kenyan had made me wary of insurance agents, especially when paying out claims! Every day in the news, there were stories of those buggers sending checks (cheques back in the 254) that bounced or they never sent them at all! Two days later, I got an envelope in the mail. It was the check all right. All $1,648 of it! I could not believe my eyes. I dashed to the bank to ascertain its authenticity and once the check went through, I was elated. My bank account was probably startled by the huge amount as it had been teetering on the brink of the world of overdrafts since I got to the U.S. Essentially, I was merely acting as a conduit between my employer and my usual creditors, my landlord and my school accountant. I never got to ‘touch’ the money or enjoy it. The ‘standing orders’ I had between me and my creditors saw to it. I had never been the recipient of such a large amount in my life. I had to plan carefully. This was a lot of money and I had heard of stories of lads who had ‘made it rain’ by visiting brothels of ill repute and tucking a few crispy notes into the ng*thas of dancers and/or strippers and I was not about to fall into that trap. I also had arrears in school to pay ( I always had school fees arrears) and I decided to fix the car just to get it back on the road and use the rest to pay off the always mounting school arrears.\n\nThe Hyundai was back on the road. Some patchwork was done to it to legalize it via the state inspection and I decided to buff off some of the most visible scratches myself. However, it did not quite feel right after the accident. One of the CV joints was slightly bent after the accident and it prematurely wore out the tires. This forced me to become bosom buddies with used tire salesmen as I could not afford new tires at that time. However, there was something wretched about buying the used tires. They never lasted. They always went flat after four or so months. ‘It’s because these are old tires. They suffer from winter rot. The microscopic cracks slowly release the air in the tire. You are better off buying a new tire’, my roommate informed me. A new tire cost $80 or more and a used one cost $25. So, I decided to gamble with the used tire but I kept on losing.\n\nIn addition, the thingamajigger had another problem. Whenever it rained, some of the water seeped into the car, leaving the car carpet wet. If not mopped and shampooed immediately, it would leave a putrid, moldy smell. Despite these quirks that I had learnt to easily overlook, I had no problem with the car. It was my daily driver and never failed me. When I showed the car off to people, or rather, when people spotted me driving, or parking the car far away from shinier, newer cars, they tried hard not to laugh or snicker and told me that everyone buys a ‘junk car’ when they first land in the land of Abraham Lincoln. The thingamajigger was no junk car, I defended the Hyundai. It went wherever I went to, hardly got stuck in the snow and seeped gas like a well mannered socialite sipping expensive wine. I loved it!\n\nOne day, I was getting off class and a lass with an ass asked me how I managed to get back and forth. I told her that I had a compact car. She asked if I could give her a ride home, or a ‘lift’ as we called it in Kenya. When she saw my beloved thingamajigger, she was crestfallen. The dents, scratches and faded paint did not make for an ideal looking car. Like the gentleman I am, I held the squeaky passenger door open and she entered the car like a condemned woman walking towards the guillotine! She sat in the car as if the car itself held her hostage. I overlooked her facial expression and body language nuances and cranked the car to life. We started moving and she decided to roll the window down. However, once the window was rolled down, it did not go up unless extreme pressure and patience was applied. And just like I thought would happen, the lass wanted to roll the window up after our speed increased slightly. ‘You mean this window does not go up?’ she asked? ‘Yes, I need to stop the car so that I can push it back up.’ My reply drew a sneer from the now discombobulated belle, who seemed to want out but did not know how. I stopped the car and rolled the window up. I grunted as I pushed the window up but this got her more disgruntled. ‘We’ll use my window as ventilation’, I helpfully added. The car drove fine but this lass was like the princess in the fairy tale ‘The princess and the pea’ by Hans Christian Andersen, who felt the pea right through the 20 mattresses and 20 featherbeds. She felt everything that was wrong with the car and complained about everything. ‘How many miles does the car have?’ the diva inquired. ‘Around 102,000 miles. The car drives well. It looks like the engine is just being broken in…’ I joked. ‘It’s time for the car to go to the car graveyard, too many miles’, she interjected, ignoring my appalling attempt at a joke. She had to be kidding. This car ran like a champ. ‘What’s that noise, I feel like I can hear the road beneath me!’ This statement from her confused me. Maybe the car did not have the best sound deadening material out there. As long as you did not see the road beneath you, you would be alright, I figured. As fate would have it, it started drizzling. I needed to use the air conditioner to defog the car for clear visibility. The car’s air conditioner didn’t work. It blew hot air towards us. Maybe the hot air was ruining her makeup (and mood) as she looked flustered. Her face was twisted into a rictus of pure revulsion! This cleared up the foggy windows but prompted yet another question from the sassy lass. ‘The a/c doesn’t work?’ she asked the obvious. ‘No, I probably need to add some freon soon…’ I started to explain. ‘This car is something!’ she retorted nonchalantly. Luckily, we arrived at her destination and immediately we stopped, she tried to open the passenger door latch so that she would disembark, more like flee. ‘I need to open it from the outside, something is wrong with the latch’, I sheepishly explained. I ran over to the other side and opened the door from the outside. She half jumped out half ran and said a heartless thank you as she fled from the evil thingamajigger! I wondered how someone who did not even own a vehicle herself could be so critical. Suffice it to say that she never asked for a ‘lift’ again!\n\nThe spring semester was done and school was out. The weather got hotter and I realized why a working air conditioner in the car was a good thing. I had always heard of ‘summer’ but no one had told me that it gets this hot in the U.S. I had arrived in the country the previous year at the end of summer, so I did not experience the ‘proper’ intense summer heat. ‘Summer heat, summer rain’, sang JT Taylor in his song ‘Long Hot Summer Night’. There was hardly any ‘summer breeze’ that the Isley Brothers sang about, to cool down the Sahara-like temperatures. You could fry an egg in a minute on a hot day. It wasn’t the heat so much as the humidity! The Americans say ‘it’s the humidity stupid!’ I used to think that Mombasa, a Kenyan coastal city was humid but the humidity in the U.S was something else. You would take a shower and start sweating as you were shutting the shower faucets off! As soon as you got outside the house, you were drenched in sweat, wondering why you even bothered to take a shower in the first place! I had to buy one or two wife-beaters and a towel to wipe the sweat off the brow of my face, amongst other places. I was working like a maniac to make as much money as possible for the next semester, desperately trying to make hay while the sun literally shone.\n\nI picked up another job to help me amass the requisite funds for the school accounts office. Boy did I work. My other ‘summer job’ consisted of assembling carnival equipment. Slides, swings, Ferris wheels, bumper cars, that sort of thing. This job was hard! I may have had acrophobia before starting the job but my fear of heights was cured when, on the first day, as a tenderfoot, I was forced to climb up a tall Ferris wheel and latch up the metal pieces. These pieces were heavy, greasy, had sharp corners and needed to be installed quickly. Despite wearing gloves, my hands were singed by the scorching metal pieces made hot by the sun! These carnivals travelled from town to town, city to city and they were in a city for a week at a time. They therefore had to be assembled quickly in readiness for the start of the carnival and disassembled quickly for transportation to the next carnival. Once the carnival commenced, we were at the gate checking the tickets. At the end of the carnival, usually on Saturday or Sunday night, it was ‘tear down’ time! Huge Ferris wheels were taken apart in hours and packed into trailers, ready for the next stop. Once the trailers arrived at the next town, it was time to set the equipment up again! In Kenya, this menial job was disparagingly referred to as ‘kazi ya mkono’, ‘work using one’s hands’ or ‘kazi ya mjengo’, ‘construction work’ I was a ‘mtu wa mjengo’, ‘construction worker’. As I toiled in 90 plus degree heat and 100% humidity, I recalled the unfortunate workers who used to walk from their homes to work in Nairobi, usually to the Industrial Area factories or construction sites in the suburbs and back every day and work backbreaking jobs! I now understood what these chaps were going through! I juggled the jobs with dexterity and what you may consider to be madness! I was working 7 days a week. I reminisced about the good old days in Nairobi when the weekend would start on an exhilarating Friday evening and end on a high note on Sunday evening/night. I saw why Kenyans in America rarely went out. They were chasing the elusive dollar! I was rushing from one job to another, assembling equipment, rushing home for a 3-5 hour nap and doing it all over again! I remember driving home one day and sort of dozing behind the wheel. The small rumble strips on the edge of the highway promptly woke me up. I was surviving on coffee, lots of Chinese takeout and prayers! All summer long, I traversed various towns assembling equipment and letting eager teenagers and families and children into the carnival rides. It was a brutal way of life but I had to adopt a Panglossian way of thinking to survive and dredge through the rocky terrain that was my life. When things were ‘thick’ or ‘elephant’, not going well, I always reminded myself of the song ‘Don’t worry, be happy’ by Bobby McFerrin.\n\nThe carnival continued its way to upstate New York and I could not follow them there due to distance. Despite the backbreaking work, I had saved enough money to pay for some school, buy books and keep afloat. School fees gobbled up all my summer earnings.\n\nAs time went by, I felt that it was time to upgrade the car. I had put in more money into the car and it was running great. However, it seemed like everyone around me had a better car! I tried not to think about keeping up with the Joneses but when a friend of mine gave me a ride in his air conditioned car, It felt good and I wondered if I could ever drive a car that did not feel like an oven inside! I had asked a mechanic for a quote to fix the air conditioner and he had alerted me that as a failsafe measure, older cars usually required the whole replacement of the entire air conditioning system, which would be $1,900 for my car! A co-worker of mine had seen how I meticulously maintained the car and wanted to buy a car for her mother so that she could get around, as her mother’s car had been grounded due to too many mechanical problems. We discussed the price and the lady offered me $US 1,000, which was the Kelly Blue Book value of the Hyundai! I was thrilled as I had paid only $500! It was time to start shopping for another car, I told myself.\n\nOnce again, just like the time I was shopping for a car the first time round, I was short of money. The cars I wanted simply cost too much money. The cars that were within my budget were similar in style to the thingamajigger and my heart was set for an upgrade. A friend of mine warned me about selling a car that had no major problems and I listened to him for a while. ‘A car with no mechanical problems is like a good wife or girlfriend. Never get rid of it!’ he advised. However, the desire to upgrade outweighed the desire to live within my means. Another American friend suggested a car auction. He persuaded me to try and visit the auction in Philadelphia. ‘Man, you can get a good ride for cheap. Just got a Jeep from there!’ He truly had a Jeep SUV and this piqued my interest. ‘If you have 2 to 3 thousand, you can get a good ride bro!’ I wanted to believe him but I was wary of cars from the auction. I had heard of horror stories from people who had bought cars from the car auction and lived to regret the purchase. The auctioneers were unscrupulous snake oil salesmen who sold cars that were past their ‘drive’ date to vulnerable, unsuspecting and desperate individuals! Some of these cars were in such bad shape that they could not run off the auction ramp and had to be pushed away. I had also been warned about buying an American made car. ‘These cars don’t last. They are always breaking down. In fact, Ford means found on road daily or found on road dead!’, my friend quipped. He recommended that I buy a foreign car, preferably a Japanese car. ‘Japanese cars never break down. Remember, limit yourself to a Toyota, Nissan or Honda, nothing else!’ I assured him that I would not buy an American car.\n\nHowever, like a moth drawn to a flame, I decided to attend the auction ‘just to see’. I had also seen a chap purchase a car for about $500, fix a small problem and then have a trouble free car for a while. Buying a car at the auction was like rolling dice at the casino. Sometimes you won but as the truism always asserts, the house always wins.\n\nIf you can recall the Moi days in Kenya, former president Moi would attend an annual goat auction in Baringo county where goats and other animals would be auctioned, usually on Christmas Eve, to commemorate the festive Christmas season. Usually, the president won most, if not all of the auctions, leading some to silently wonder whether it was a real auction or a public relations exercise. But then again, it would be foolhardy to bid against a powerful and monied president. The auctioneer was none other than a boisterous funnyman called Ezekiel Bargetuny. The late Bargetuny was a farceur who spoke fast and usually ended his auction with the words with ‘na hiyo imeenda na mtukufu rais, makofi kwake!’ ‘and that (group of animals) has been bought by his excellency the president, let’s give him a round of applause!’\n\nThe auctioneers in the auctions in the U.S spoke twice as fast as Ezekiel Bargetuny, as if they had inadvertently swallowed some hot gruel and they were trying to get it out of their mouths! ‘Prraaap prraap prraap a 2002 Ford Expedition prraap 89,000 miles prraap good condition prraap one owner prraap won’t last!’ You had to strain your ears and tune them properly to catch anything he or she was saying! ‘Prraap prraap sold to the gentleman in prraap prraap for $5,000!’ He would hit the gavel like a judge bellowing for order to be restored in the courtroom!\n\nSo, I stood there, eyeing the cars that passed by. Suddenly, I caught a glimpse of a reddish Chrysler. This Chrysler was fully loaded! It had a moonroof, excellent radio and CD system with a disc changer, leatherette seats, power windows and doors and all those things that make a car salesman drool as they explain to a potential car buyer about the extra options that serve to inflate his or her markup and thus, commissions and profits. I had quite a few reservations about the buying an American car. I had been warned by my friend of the horror stories. However, the Japanese cars that were on auction were simply outside my budget. People vigorously bid on them and the prices escaped my short financial tentacles.\n\n‘$2,000. Perfect Chrysler prraaap prraaap prraaap fully loaded. Ride in style prraaap prraaap made in Detriot!’ I saw a chap raise his hand. ‘Okay, let’s do this, $2,100 prraaap prraaap…’ I could not tell who was bidding or at what price the bid was currently on in the cacophony of noises. The car driver opened the hood and revved the engine. I inched closer to the engine and saw a good looking engine that purred like a well fed Persian cat. No noises at all. ‘Engine is great, no issues, shall go for another 100,000 miles these Chryslers prraaap prraaap…’ Once the engine was revved, folks who were not interested in the car suddenly seemed interested. ‘$2,500 for the beauty, don’t let anyone else take it home prraaap prraaap can’t get it anywhere for this price prraaap prraaap!’\n\nMy adrenaline kicked in. This car was good. It was an American car but it was not a Ford. Chryslers were not bad, or were they? The engine sounded perfect and it was in relatively decent interior shape. With such a car, I would not park it far away from the entrance in shame. Lasses would hop in with no reservations. It would mingle with the shinier newer cars. ‘Does the air conditioner work?’ I asked the driver. ‘Ice cold air prraaap prraaap colder than the Alaskan winter prraaap prraaap!’ It was as if the auctioneer had heard my question. The driver turned the air conditioner on and I put my fingers next to the vent. The car blew ice cold air! I needed this car and I needed it now! I raised my hand, not too certain if I was making the right decision.\n\n‘Sold for $2,600 to the gentleman in the red t-shirt!’ the auctioneer gleefully shouted and banged his gavel. I was the proud owner of a fully loaded Chrysler…\n\nThe Thingamajigger Gets Into An Accident And Other Stories… (Part II)\n\n*Disclaimer.

Material may contain adult themes and abusive language.\n\n*Please read part I of the blog (choose from the menu) if you haven’t already done so that you may get the gist of the story.\n\nAfter Kilonzi’s funeral, his still shell-shocked relatives had to act as hosts of numerous mechanics and other visiting mourners from Nairobi. The pastor took the opportunity to conduct a mini-harambee. (funds drive) ‘Toa ndugu, toa dada, kile ulicho nacho, bwana anakuona mpaka rohoni mwako.’ ‘Give (generously) brother, give (generously) sister, what you have, God is seeing you (in body) and is seeing what is in your heart.’ A ‘chondo’ or sisal basket was passed along and everyone generously dug into their pockets to donate funds to Kilonzi’s widow and young children.\n\nIt got dark and the mechanics who had come for the funeral wanted to explore the nightlife of Kithyoko after giving their brother a memorable send off. Locals told them that people of means such as them would usually go to the town of Matuu, where there was quite a bit of nightlife, unlike Kithyoko which was a rather small town. So, a local ‘matatu’, minivan a Peugeot 404, was quickly hired to ferry the mourners turned merrymakers! This matatu was the kind where the passengers faced each other during the trip. They were commonly referred to as ‘seven a side’ or ‘where have I seen you before?’ This ‘matatu’ had many stickers on it that summarized life’s trials and tribulations, mocking life and celebrating it at the same time. One of the stickers had a funny message. ‘Unajifanya ng’ombe ukamuliwe na nani?’ ‘Why are you acting cow-like, who is going to milk you?’ I watched in amazement as the 404 pickup, packed to capacity, sped off to Ndallas hotel, Matuu!\n\nThe rest of us who were either underage or not willing to participate in the debauchery that Matuu had to offer, remained behind and we were served a meal of ‘muthokoi’, maize/corn and beans. Some ‘lessos’, large pieces of cloth that have printed beautiful sayings in Kiswahili, were laid on the ground of one of the houses, whose furniture had been removed to make way for the visiting multitude of people.\n\nAt around 5.00 am, we heard shouts emanating from outside. The inebriated mechanics, or rather, most of them, had just been dropped off by the Peugeot 404 pickup. Someone made the mistake of asking them to hush as there were many people already asleep but this only amped up the drunk mechanics, who started shouting loudly. They staggered and crawled into the already overfilled house and dropped themselves on any unoccupied space on the ground they could find. The furore lasted for a while as one or two of the revelers were singing Kamba songs which could only be labeled as ‘vile and dirty’! Half asleep, I could hear the word ‘ngiti’, dog, interspersed in between choruses.\n\nIn the early morning, everyone was woken up by the family members. Breakfast was being served and ‘strungi’, black tea (without sugar or milk) and a slice of bread was offered to the mourners. Many of the adults who had stayed behind shot dirty looks at the mechanics, who had interrupted and disrupted everyone else from their sleep during their loud reentry. ‘Pombe ni shetani!’ ‘Alcohol is the devil!’, one lady brazenly remarked! The drunk mechanics looked too disappointed at the minuscule amount of breakfast being offered, especially since they had been imbibing for the better part of the night and needed a solid meal to take care of their hunger pangs.\n\nAfter breakfast, everyone spoke in hushed tones about the events of yesternight. The mechanics were regaling us with tales of just how wonderful the night was at Ndallas hotel, Matuu and how their arrival caused a near-stampede at Ndallas. When they got to Ndallas hotel, they wanted to know if there were any lovely Kamba maidens that could join them for company. The ‘matatu’ driver asked for a couple of minutes. He could go get some lasses but needed more money for petrol/gas. ‘The driver was very annoying, asking for money at every opportunity and yet he had seen us contributing money at the funeral!’ complained one mechanic. Anyway, since the place was reminiscent of a ‘bull dance’ with only males present, the mechanics obliged.\n\nAbout 45 minutes later, according to the mechanics, the ‘matatu’ came back full of Kamba maidens. The near-stampede commenced! The mechanics and lasses to jostled and angled for the best man or woman they fancied and once everyone was paired up, the games begun! Copious amounts of alcohol flowed freely, despite the fact that the prices in Ndallas hotel were slightly higher than those in other bars in Matuu. ‘Nyama choma’, roast meat was also in abundant supply as the mechanics temporarily forgot the grease and oil that they were accustomed to. The music of the late Kakai Kilonzo was on heavy rotation, thumping out of the speakers! The mechanics danced vigorously to ‘kilunda’ music, which felt better with a sexy lass close to you! Since they were immaculately dressed, the maidens had a hard time believing that they were mere lowly mechanics. As long as they were from Nairobi, where earnings were high, that was all that mattered!\n\nThere comes a time when there is a certain itch that needs to be scratched and the time had drawn nigh. As the night wore on, some mechanics had decided to spend the night with some of the maidens and the thin line between maidens out to have a good time and twilight girls trying to make a killing, was getting blurry every time a bottle of beer was opened. However, some of the revelers had run into a small problem, of the monetary kind. The activities of the day had drained many of them of money and the partaking of drinks and meats was lowering the already depleted amounts that the mechanics had brought with them from Nairobi. There was intense haggling as some people bargained for the pleasures of the flesh. The mechanics who had brought extra cash were the winners in Ndallas; not only were they commandeering the lasses, they were actually surreptitiously lending money to their mates with a promise to pay with interest!\n\nSome mechanics disappeared with some maidens into the streets of Matuu. They gave strict instructions to the other mechanics to tell the driver of one of the minivans that were to transport the visiting mourners back to Nairobi the next day, actually, in a few hours time, to pass by Matuu on their way back to Nairobi. They gave an exact time for them to be picked up.\n\nAfter breakfast, the minivans from Nairobi came to ferry the mourners. The mechanics bid farewell to Kilonzi’s widow, who looked hopelessly out of place in the environs of Kithyoko, like a fish out of water. Fate had dealt her a cruel card and she seemed destined to her fate as a small scale farmer in Kithyoko. Her children looked dazed and confused, especially the young one who cried uncontrollably despite being soothed by his sobbing mother. It was a melancholic sight to behold.\n\nThe minivan I was traveling in passed by Matuu to pick up the libidinous men who had spent the night with the wanton women. The mechanics in the minivan were full of mirth upon the entrance of the lecherous men for their successful exploits in this the land of Syokimau. ‘Ndume!’, ‘bull’, they applauded their counterparts. One of the chaps who got onto the minivan had a rather sordid tale. He enthralled everyone by telling them that he had been taught an unforgettable lesson in Matuu. When he went to copulate with the damsel who he had met at Ndallas, all was well until the damsel demanded consideration, compensation for the Matuu romp. The chap naturally reached for his trousers to complete the transaction but alas, there was nothing in his wallet. It was as empty as a bird’s nest in December. With a scowl on his face, he said that he immediately sobered up as he had foolishly carried most of his monthly pay ‘in case of an emergency’. He told the now irritated lady that he did not have any money and must have dropped the money somewhere, maybe, no, most likely in the hotel. He requested that they go to the hotel and ask the attendants there. ‘Wewe, unataka kutoroka na pesa yangu, hebu wacha mchezo!’ ‘You want to run away with my money, quit playing!’ He reassured her that there must have been some mistake as he indeed did have money with him when he had left Ndallas hotel. ‘Unanichukulia kama mimi ni mtoto! Ngoja niite marafiki zangu ndiyo utajua mimi sio mtoto wa kuchezewa!’ ‘You are taking me for a little child? Let me call my friends so that you can know that I am not a child to be played around with!’ He tried to dissuade her to no avail. She let out a scream and yelled out ‘huyu ameniibia!”He has stolen from me!’ No sooner had she yelled than help arrived in the form of two mean looking hefty women and one man who carried a simi sword. ‘Wewe mshezi, umetoka Nairobi na hutaki kulipa?’ ‘You fool, you have come from Nairobi and you don’t want to pay?’ At that time, he was too disoriented to ask himself how three total strangers knew that he was from Nairobi. He tried to explain to the crowd of four that he had somehow lost his money in Ndallas hotel and if they wanted to, they could accompany him to the hotel so that they could see if a Good Samaritan had collected the wallet. The crew were having none of it. ‘Tumewazoea nyinyi! Mnakuja kuharibu wasichana wetu na hata hamwezi sema asante baada ya kujiburudisha! Kwenda huko!’ ‘We are used to people like you! You are spoiling our girls and you can’t even say thank you to her after enjoying yourself! Go away!’ He then winced as he explained how the women rained slaps on him as the man watched, with his hand in close proximity to the handle of the simi sword, just in case he felt the need to escape! ‘I have not been beaten by any woman since my mother spanked me as a young boy!’, he reminisced! ‘Umekula vya bwerere! Toka hapa na usirudi. Tusikuone hapa tena!’, You have ‘eaten’ free things! Get out of here and don’t come back. Let’s not see you here again!’ the 2 women roared! He put on his pair of trousers and bolted like a gazelle being chased by a predatory lion. He went back to Ndallas hotel, Matuu and explained his situation to the hotel receptionist. She curtly told him that she was working the day shift and had nothing to do with last night’s shift. She coldly added that no one had left anything in their lost and found section, let alone money. He waited impatiently for the ‘matatu’ to arrive.\n\nHe narrated his story and before he could finish, a fellow mechanic cut him short. ‘Those were conmen and con women. They were in the ruse together!’ He stated. People looked at him in shock. ‘But how could the money have disappeared? I was in the room the entire time. I did not leave and she was with me the entire time’, he added. ‘Those people are clever! When you take off your trousers, did the girl ask you to hang them on the bathroom door?’ The mechanic asked. The randy mechanic answered in the affirmative. ‘That’s where they get you. They either have someone under the bed who waits until you go to the bathroom and then they take your wallet or they fish the trouser from the bathroom hanger, remove the money and return the pair of trousers at the exact spot you hanged it at. The receptionists and workers in those lodgings are in on the act too and act as lookouts and witnesses for the crooks!’ the other mechanic added. He rued the night he had come to Matuu and said that he had been alert the whole time. ‘Hiyo lazima ilikuwa ni kamuti’ ‘that must be ‘kamuti’, witchcraft’, he shook his head in dismay. ‘Wewe, wacha kuharibia WaKamba jina, kwani kila kitu ni kamuti? Hawa ni matapeli. Kila mahali kuna matapeli bwana!’ ‘You, stop spoiling the name of we the Kamba people. Does everything have to be attributed to witchcraft? Those were conmen and women. There are con artists everywhere!’ another mechanic castigated him. He agreed and realized that he had fallen to one of the intricate con games practiced by men and women. ‘Sikujua hii miujiza imefika Matuu’, ‘I didn’t know this trickery had reached Matuu’, he admitted. All this time, the storytelling had been going on in my presence. Someone then realized that I was a young boy in the presence of men and this information was not appropriate for my youthful consumption. This was one of the exceptions to the proverb laid out in Chinua Achebe’s ‘Things Fall Apart’, if a child washed his hands, he could eat with kings. ‘Nyinyi watu mnaharibu tabia za huyu mvulana hapa. Pimeni maneno yenu!’ ‘You fellows are teaching the small boy bad habits. Limit your words!’ a mechanic scolded the others. As a boy, I was eagerly absorbing the mechanic’s misfortunes like a sponge, ready to tell my peers in school about my trip to Machakos, the funeral and the accompanying shenanigans! So, naturally, I was not pleased when the mechanics started censoring the juicy tidbits. The minivans sped towards Nairobi and this time, they seemed to be moving faster than they had been the previous trip. They were driving neck to neck with the ‘miraa’, khat pickup truck drivers who were ferrying the coveted shrub to the airports in Nairobi.\n\nI remember a mechanic asking why the khat was ferried by road, instead of getting airplanes to fly to various airstrips in Meru, where most of the khat was grown and transport it via air from Meru to Nairobi or Mombasa or anywhere where the khat was in demand. One of the passengers had a ready answer. The process involved in landing a small plane, loading it and clearing it for take-off was too time consuming. He said that the airplane option had been tried in Meru before. The Meru khat farmers were initially excited at the thought of ferrying their perishable khat by airplane. They thought that it would cut into the traveling time from Meru to Nairobi. They waited with enthusiasm as the plane showed up in the horizon. Ululations rent the air! The plane did not land immediately. It circled the airstrip like a vulture trying to circle a carcass. After circling the airstrip in what seemed to be an eternity, it was cleared for landing. When it landed, there was an airport employee who was marshaling the plane in order to safely direct it to the hanger. He waved his hands with items that looked like table-tennis rackets and marshaled the plane for another agonizing couple of minutes. Once he was done with the marshaling, it was time to load the miraa, khat. One major difference between the airplane and pickup truck is that the pickup truck could be overloaded with bales of khat to the brim. In fact, khat pickup trucks had an empty tire tied to the bottom of the lowest rear bumper to cushion it from bumpy rides due to overloading as they sped t"
