18 Nov â€“ After her manager denied that she is still receiving alimony from Nicky Wu, Chinese actress Ma Yashu decided to address the rumours personally and expressed her thoughts on the relationship between ex-husband Nicky Wu and his "Bu Bu Jing Qing" co-star Cecilia Liu.

According to Now News website, the 38-year-old actress recently lamented on Weibo, saying, "I only found out about Nicky's relationship from the news. And once again, I am painted as a bad person. The nightmare is still not over even though it has been a few years already."

"Ever since our divorce, I have been portrayed as the villain and netizens threw vicious words at me. There are many reasons for a couple to split. It's difficult and we have no need to explain it to people. For former partners, it is most respectable to keep silent and no longer be in contact."

Ma, who filed for divorce from Nicky in 2009 after three years of marriage, has since married Australian executive, James Robert Hayes, and is currently pregnant with his child.

"I am due to give birth next month, and I can't live with these kinds of rumours that will affect my baby and my family," said the actress, and stressed that she had never taken any money from Nicky after the divorce.

She continued, "We have loved each other before, even during the most trying times. When we broke up, we should each find our own happiness. Thanks to "Bu Bu Jing Qing", [Nicky's] luck has turned around!"

"I wish that they will love each other and be happy together!" added the actress.
