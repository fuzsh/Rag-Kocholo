Protestant denominations arrived in the Philippines in 1898, after the United States took control of the Philippines from Spain, first with United States Army chaplains and then within months civilian missionaries.

Protestants makes up nearly 11% of the Filipino population.[1] They include a wide variety of Pentecostal, Evangelical and independent churches. Some denominations were founded locally.
