        "text": "- Advertisement -\n\nThe congregation of Central United Methodist Church (CUMC) is\n\ncelebrating its 125th founding anniversary this month of March as the first Protestant church in the Philippines located along T.M. Kalaw\n\nStreet, Ermita, Manila. It was established on March 5, 1899, during\n\nthe American Occupation when it was originally named Central Methodist Episcopal Church. It was referred to as “The American Church” or the first ever “English-speaking Church“ in the Philippines.\n\nThe anniversary program is inspired by a theme, “Celebrating 125 Years of Methodism: In Continuous Pursuit of Great Commission”, that will be celebrated on March 17, 2024, as the culminating Sunday at 9:00 AM with lawyer Felipe L. Gozon, chairman of GMA Network Inc., delivering the spiritual message for the 125th founding anniversary of CUMC.\n\nThis was the same church where Gozon received the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws (Honoris Causa) on March 20, 2022 from the Wesleyan University Philippines (WUP). Past recipients of this honorary degree were former president Fidel Ramos, Justice Reynato Puno, Methodist Bishop Emerito Nacpil, and other accomplished persons in government, academia, religion, and business.\n\nGozon is the current chairman and adviser of the board of GMA Network Inc, one of the largest media conglomerates in the Philippines. He recently retired as CEO of GMA Network last Dec. 31, 2023, after making the network the number one TV station in the Philippines. Gozon is a man of faith who attends worship services with his family in a Protestant church in Manila.\n\nCUMC kicked off its anniversary celebration with an out-of-town Family Day at Torres Farm and Resort, Naic Cavite last Feb. 17, 2024, and will continue in the next succeeding weekends. On\n\nMarch 8, the church’s Outreach team will head north to Anda,\n\nPangasinan for their medical and dental mission in partnership with\n\nDr. Nicanor D. Montoya Foundation.\n\nOn March 10, CUMC will have its International Women’s Sunday to\n\ncelebrate International Women’s Day, an annual global holiday to give\n\nhonor to all the women that will feature prominent women as guest\n\nspeakers to deliver spiritual messages in all worship services.\n\nDuring this year’s celebration, CUMC will go full blast in its\n\nfundraising campaign for the ongoing construction of the multi-purpose\n\nbuilding which just started late last year. It is a 4 story building\n\nto add space to its church’s ongoing ministerial work on feeding and\n\nsheltering the street people within the community, a meeting venue for\n\njob applicants including OFWs and seamen nearby, a facility for\n\nmedical missions, a repository of donations for calamity affected\n\nareas and other charitable activities.\n\nThis fundraising campaign shall have its Thanksgiving Dinner to be\n\nheld at the Philippine Christian University Auditorium on May 25. It\n\nwill be a musical dinner that will feature the homegrown talents of\n\nCUMC. Aside from its ongoing celebrations, the church will provide a\n\nbazaar on the church lawn which includes the sale of food and snacks,\n\nagricultural products, and souvenir items. Proceeds from the bazaar\n\nshall go to the church’s ministry fund."
