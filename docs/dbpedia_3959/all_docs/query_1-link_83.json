        "text": "This book is about religious women’s contributions to others’ salvation in seventeenth and eighteenth century Spanish America and the Philippines, a subject that has been little studied in previous research. In this investigation, special emphasis is put on aspects of the colonial gender relations that have bearing on the intricate relationships between the apostolic and contemplative forms of religious life as presented in colonial texts by and about these women. The majority of them were nuns, who lived a life in enclosure, a fact that in a most concrete way constrained the physical mobility normally seen as a presupposition for apostolic endeavours. Despite the constrictions of space and agency that were related to their female gender, many women in the Spanish colonial empire, whether nuns or other contemplatives, were said to have functions in the missionary enterprise. As a consequence of their love of God and neighbour, they felt a vocation for missionary work, they prayed and suffered for the salvation of others, they taught and counselled people who came to them with their religious and moral queries, and some claimed that they were transported in spirit to the mission frontiers where they carried out similar work as the male missionaries, albeit in a supernatural way.\n\nVarious colonial experiences in Asia have shaped the social, political as well as religious landscape in Asia. The Philippines, long dominated by Western colonial powers—more than three hundred years under Spain and almost fifty under the United States—became the only Christian country in Asia with more than ninety percent of the total Catholic population in Asia. When the U.S. took over the colonial domination after Spain, various U.S. colonial and postcolonial influences were introduced and their political, economical and social systems penetrated into the Philippines (Goda, 1999, 2003; Hunchcroft, 2000; Abinales and Amoroso, 2005; Hidalgo and Patajo-Legasto, 2005; Go and Foster, 2005). And Protestant denominations based on U.S. have been operated their missions into the country through over a century. With the social, political as well as religious influx of foreign and Christian influences within Philippine context, the Philippines seemed to be a good place to examine the modern...\n\nThis paper asks a familiar question--what is the relationship among religion, empire and revolution?--but does so within a specific context, the American colonial Philippines. It examines the early writings of the most celebrated Filipino Jesuit intellectual, Fr. Horacio de la Costa, SJ (1916-1977), best known for his magisterial book, The Jesuits in the Philippines, 1581-1768 published in 1961, based on his doctoral dissertation at Harvard. But while only 23, however, Fr. De la Costa wrote The Light Cavalry on the even of the Japanese invasion in 1941--a sweeping and polemical account of the Jesuit mission in the Philippines from the Order’s return in 1859. Largely ignored among scholars of Philippine and Church histories alike, it offers a set of wide-ranging reflections on colonialism and Christianity from the latter half of the Spanish period through the Revolution and US occupation. Reading it closely, one gets a sense of how Catholic, specifically Jesuit, pedagogical practices in the 1930s were mobilized for a kind of religious war aimed at engaging the “Masonic” contaminations of the Revolution, the Protestant power of American imperialism, and the “irreligious” corruptions of the Commonwealth. Feeling besieged by the “pagan” secularism of the colonial public schools, Fr. de la Costa fashioned a history that was at once counter-colonial and cosmopolitan, steeped in the conservative elitism of his milieu.\n\nThis paper examines the content of studies and publications on women which have been undertaken in the Philippines since the early twentieth century. These studies may be dassified as belonging to the following periods: ( 1) the period of the first feminist struggle (1905-1937);(2) th&lt;&#39; post-war ycars(l940l970); (3) the Development Decade the &#39;70s; and (4) the new decade of feminism the &#39;80s. An analysis of the patterns and trends in these materials concerning the status, views and actions of the F ilipina indicates the following: first. the conc(.•rns of women as women arc emphasized by writers of the first and second feminist decades. while those in the other periods deal with gender issues in relation to eithc..~r more general social science concerns. or in tem1s of social dt!veloprnent goaJs; second. education is considcrc&#39;&lt;i to be a potent factor in enlarging the perspectives of women about themselves; third, by-and-large, the average Filipina considers ho..."
