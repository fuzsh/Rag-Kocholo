        "text": "My first encounter with the Southern Baptists of the Northern Philippines came in 1997. During a preliminary visit to establish a direction for my research, I found myself in Baguio City, a large urban center known as the “Gateway to the Cordillera,” the rugged mountains of the north, home to the numerically small but anthropologically well-known minority ethnic groups of the upland Philippines.1 I had hoped to do my research on indigenous Christianity (specifically Anglicanism) among one of these groups, but after a long, tortuous ride to the village of Sagada, I found the circumstances different than I had anticipated. I had been told that the Anglicans of that region were working out an “indigenous liturgy” and reworking the Anglican Book of Common Prayer to reflect mountain culture. It seemed a wonderful opportunity to get in on the ground floor in order to study the dynamics of change within a Christian denomination in a particular non-Western setting. What I found, however, was a long-term vision in the form of a 10-year plan (in its early stages) to rewrite the Book, which at this point seemed to be a discussion among the leadership (based in Manila) rather than anything closely involving the laity and their everyday experience of faith. I returned to Baguio somewhat concerned about the possibilities of developing the kind of project where I could encounter the Person-in-the-Pew engaged in interpreting and (re)imagining her Christian identity in light of what she understands her culture/context to be."
