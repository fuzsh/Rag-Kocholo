        "text": "Philippine Independent Church\n\nchurch, Philippines\n\nSpanish:\n\nIglesia Filipina Independiente\n\nAlso called:\n\nAglipayan Church\n\nDate:\n\n1902 - present\n\nPhilippine Independent Church, independent church organized in 1902 after the Philippine revolution of 1896–98 as a protest against the Spanish clergy’s control of the Roman Catholic Church. Cofounders of the church were Isabelo de los Reyes y Florentino, author, labour leader, and senator, who was imprisoned during the revolution for his criticism of Spanish clergy and government officials in the Philippines, and Gregorio Aglipay y Labayán, a Philippine Roman Catholic priest who was excommunicated in 1899 for his activities on behalf of the revolution. Aglipay accepted de los Reyes’ request that he serve as supreme bishop of the new church in 1903, a position he held until his death in 1940.\n\nThe church continued to follow Roman Catholic forms of worship, but for many years doctrine was strongly influenced by Unitarianism. A schism developed in 1946, and a unitarian faction left the church. Under Isabelo de los Reyes, Jr., elected bishop in 1946, the church adopted in 1947 a new declaration of faith and articles of religion that were Trinitarian. The Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States consecrated three bishops of the Philippine Independent Church in 1948, and the two churches entered into a close association. In 1961 the church was accepted into full communion with the Church of England and the Old Catholic churches.\n\nIn the late 20th century membership was 1,400,000."
