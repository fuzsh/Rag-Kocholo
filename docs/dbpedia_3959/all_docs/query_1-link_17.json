        "text": "The American occupation of the Philippines began in war against Spain but quickly became one of the United States’ most overt and then most forgotten experiments in colonial rule outside the Western Hemisphere. This paper illustrates the importance of religious arguments as justifications for actions taken by various parties during the Philippine-American War, highlighting especially how Spanish and American attitudes differed in religious preference but shared the same basis in pre-Enlightenment views on civilization. Operating on the basis that even the islands’ Catholic majority was insufficiently Christian, some Americans like McKinley and Taft portrayed the occupation as both a mission of “uplift” and a stepping stone to greater Protestant presence in mainland China. Filipino revolutionaries held much more diverse views reflecting their vastly different backgrounds, including European-educated ilustrados; syncretic and animist practitioners throughout the islands; breakaway sects like the Iglesia Filipina Independiente; and Muslim-majority polities in Mindanao and Sulu.\n\nVarious colonial experiences in Asia have shaped the social, political as well as religious landscape in Asia. The Philippines, long dominated by Western colonial powers—more than three hundred years under Spain and almost fifty under the United States—became the only Christian country in Asia with more than ninety percent of the total Catholic population in Asia. When the U.S. took over the colonial domination after Spain, various U.S. colonial and postcolonial influences were introduced and their political, economical and social systems penetrated into the Philippines (Goda, 1999, 2003; Hunchcroft, 2000; Abinales and Amoroso, 2005; Hidalgo and Patajo-Legasto, 2005; Go and Foster, 2005). And Protestant denominations based on U.S. have been operated their missions into the country through over a century. With the social, political as well as religious influx of foreign and Christian influences within Philippine context, the Philippines seemed to be a good place to examine the modern...\n\nThis paper asks a familiar question--what is the relationship among religion, empire and revolution?--but does so within a specific context, the American colonial Philippines. It examines the early writings of the most celebrated Filipino Jesuit intellectual, Fr. Horacio de la Costa, SJ (1916-1977), best known for his magisterial book, The Jesuits in the Philippines, 1581-1768 published in 1961, based on his doctoral dissertation at Harvard. But while only 23, however, Fr. De la Costa wrote The Light Cavalry on the even of the Japanese invasion in 1941--a sweeping and polemical account of the Jesuit mission in the Philippines from the Order’s return in 1859. Largely ignored among scholars of Philippine and Church histories alike, it offers a set of wide-ranging reflections on colonialism and Christianity from the latter half of the Spanish period through the Revolution and US occupation. Reading it closely, one gets a sense of how Catholic, specifically Jesuit, pedagogical practices in the 1930s were mobilized for a kind of religious war aimed at engaging the “Masonic” contaminations of the Revolution, the Protestant power of American imperialism, and the “irreligious” corruptions of the Commonwealth. Feeling besieged by the “pagan” secularism of the colonial public schools, Fr. de la Costa fashioned a history that was at once counter-colonial and cosmopolitan, steeped in the conservative elitism of his milieu.\n\nEthnography, as a scientific method of describing people, played a significant role in the policy of integration undertaken by the newly established American colonial government as regards the non-Christian population of the Philippines in the early 1900s. Such an assertion requires an interrogation of the colonial institution, the Bureau of Non-Christian Tribes, which was tasked, among other things, to conduct \"special investigation\" of the different ethnic groups (\"pagans\" and \"Mohammedans\") living in the far-flung areas of the archipelago. This paper underscores the politics of ethnological research of the Bureau, and critiques its methodology using David Prescott Barrows' guidelines for fieldworkers as a lens through which to examine the conduct of research. It analyzes the implications of the racialized methodology for the colonial policy of the United States towards the Philippines, and attempts to explore how such investigation, with the colonial knowledge that it produced, was translated into the native discourse.\n\nSpanish conquest in the New World has two sides, evangelization, and colonization. The former was carried by the missionaries who were heavily influenced by Bartolome de Las Casa and Vitoria, while the latter by conquistadores, the defenders of the conquest. Early missionaries fought for the dignity of the Indios where they clashed with the motives of the conquistadores to exploit human resources. The problematic part was they have to work under the Spanish crown where their point of contact was also their area for friction. When they arrived in the Philippines, that social solidarity and dynamics of social relation continued where it became complex due to the involvement of various groups including the natives and their leaders, the religious orders, and most of all the Spanish Royal Court that had the history of having a heart for the Indians. King Philip II created a space for debates within his agenda of social conscience. Using Durkheim’s structuralist-functionalist approach, h..."
