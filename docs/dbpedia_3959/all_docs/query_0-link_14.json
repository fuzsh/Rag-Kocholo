        "text": "Roman Catholics account for 78.8 percent of the household population\n\n1. Of the 108,667,043 household population in 2020, nearly four fifths or 85,645,362 persons (78.8%) reported Roman Catholic as their religious affiliation. It was followed by Islam with 6,981,710 persons (6.4%), and Iglesia ni Cristo with 2,806,524 persons (2.6%). In 2015, these were also the top three religious affiliations in the country. Completing the top ten religious affiliations in 2020 are Seventh Day Adventist, and Aglipay (0.8% each); Iglesia Filipina Independiente (0.6%); Bible Baptist Church (0.5%); and United Church of Christ in the Philippines, Jehovah’s Witness, and Church of Christ (0.4% each). (Figure 1 and Table 1)\n\nBicol Region has the highest proportion of household population with Roman Catholic as religion\n\n2. Of the 17 regions in the country, Region V - Bicol Region posted the highest proportion of Roman Catholics, comprising 93.5 percent of its household population. It was followed by Region VIII - Eastern Visayas with 92.3 percent, and Region VII - Central Visayas with 90.5 percent. Except for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), which posted the lowest proportion of Roman Catholics at 5.3 percent, the proportion of Roman Catholics in the rest of the regions exceeded 50.0 percent – ranging from 54.1 percent in Region XII - SOCCSKSARGEN to 89.2 percent in Region IV-A - CALABARZON. (Table 2)\n\nCity of Mandaue posts the highest proportion of Roman Catholics among the highly urbanized cities\n\n3.

(Table 3)\n\nAlbay leads the provinces with the highest proportion of Roman Catholics\n\n4. Among the provinces in the country, Albay had the highest proportion of household population who reported Roman Catholic as their religious affiliation with 1.32 million persons or 96.2 percent of the 1.37 million household population in the province. It was followed by Catanduanes (95.6%) and Eastern Samar (95.3%). Fourteen other provinces posted proportions higher than 90.0 percent. (Table 4)\n\n5. In terms of number, the top three provinces with the highest number of Roman Catholics were Cebu (excluding its three HUCs) with 3.14 million persons, Batangas with 2.72 million persons, and Camarines Sur with 1.92 million persons. (Table 4)\n\nAbout 91 in every 100 residents in BARMM have Islam as religion\n\n6. Islam was the most predominant religion in BARMM, accounting for 4.49 million persons or 90.9 percent of the 4.94 million household population in the region. It was followed by Region IX - Zamboanga Peninsula with 18.2 percent, SOCCSKSARGEN with 15.8 percent, Region X - Northern Mindanao with 8.5 percent, and Region XI - Davao Region and MIMAROPA Region with 3.5 percent each. On the other hand, Region XIII - Caraga, which is also in Mindanao, registered a proportion of Islam of only 0.5 percent. The rest of the regions posted proportions ranging from 0.1 percent each in Bicol and Region VI - Western Visayas to 1.3 percent in the NCR. (Figure 2 and Table 5)\n\nTawi-Tawi has the highest proportion of Islam among the provinces\n\n7.
