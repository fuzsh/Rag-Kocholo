        "text": "by Karen Claire C. Garcia, Maria Mikaela S. Montales, Mary Rahnee Faye L. Negros, Nina An Kayla D. Resurreccion, & Marielle Bernice R. Samson\n\nMusic. The stark difference between Catholicism and Born Again is easily underscored by the kinds of music played within the respective churches of said religious denominations. And for us Filipinos who often find ourselves growing up as Catholics, the way by which Born Again Christians worship behind the microphone dumbfounds us, that at times, one cannot deny feeling envious of it. The upbeat drums echoing the beats of the hearts of the Christians, when compared to liturgical songs of the Catholics which most devout could not muster a vocal cord for, is heaven and hell. But this isn’t everything there is to Catholicism and Born Again. Both denominations worship the same God, read the same Bible, build churches, and yet, are distinct. What could one have to convince a budding faithful of not choosing the other?\n\nThe presence of Born Again Christians in the Philippines is especially an interesting case. Provided that the country is culturally predominantly Catholic, the increasing number of evangelicals in the country (Tan 2015) poses a unique trend, especially that in 2013, a survey by Social Weather Stations (SWS) found that one in every 11 Filipino Catholics, or 9.2 percent are pondering over leaving the Catholic church (Tubeza 2013).\n\nIn this paper, we will discuss our experience of visiting Proclaim His Name Christian Fellowship, interacting with its people, and joining the worship of Born Again Christians. Seeing that most in our group are Catholics, we viewed this as an opportunity to better understand the condition of Christian faith in the country and how Filipinos associate with their chosen religious denomination. We will also focus on the church’s ministry on teaching children, who are yet to be baptized into the Born Again Christian faith. As volunteers to their ministry, we were very much involved by joining in the games, singing songs, drawing art, and sitting with the children. Through this immersion process, we intend to gain understanding regarding the practices and beliefs of Born Again Christians through their ministration of the children rooted in their faith.\n\nFaith in numbers\n\nThe Philippines is comprised of Roman Catholics at 80.58 percent as of an official record by the Philippine government in 2018 (Philippine Statistics Authority 2018). Filipinos who profess to the Evangelical faith or are recognized as part of the Philippine Council of Evangelical Churches rank third at 2.68 percent, while non-Roman Catholics and Protestants at fifth, make up 1.16 percent of the Philippine population (Philippine Statistics Authority 2018). Truly, just by looking at these numbers, Filipinos whose religious affiliation is tied to Roman Catholicism dominate the country at present.\n\nFilipinos express their Roman Catholic faith and find communion not only during church masses on Sundays, but as well as in school and at work. In most public schools and Catholic-affiliated private schools, students are taught of religious practices, such as praying the rosary and attending the holy mass to enrich one’s faith and love for God. Similarly, offices in the Philippines encourage religious expression, particularly Catholic prayers like the Hail Mary, the Angelus, and Our Father.\n\nThe dominance of Roman Catholicism in the Philippines as opposed to other religious denominations suggests the significant role it plays in the country. Along with this is hegemony perpetuated by the former that can influence the course of national issues, where decisions on social and even political matters may serve the values and beliefs set by Church leaders.\n\nNonetheless, though relatively small in number, the reach of non-Roman Catholic faith in the Philippines, with churches and schools for their faith believers, allow Filipinos of different religious affiliations to live and proclaim their faith openly. A case is that of the Evangelicals and Protestants whose community of churches continues to grow and flourish.\n\nAlthough similar in beliefs, the Evangelicals and Protestants occupy different spaces of faith in churches in the Philippines. The Protestant denomination makes up an estimate of 4 percent (including other Protestant-faiths) of the population “and includes a wide variety of Pentecostal, Evangelical, and independent Churches” (Harvard Divinity School n.d.). Notably, another similarity between Evangelical and Protestantism involves their claim on the Born Again Christian faith. However, Born Again Christians affiliate more to Protestantism.\n\nThe Principles of the Born Again Faith\n\nThe foundation of the Born Again Christian faith is John 3:3: “Jesus replied, ‘Very truly I tell you, no one can see the Kingdom of God unless they are born again” (Philippine Bible Society 2010:118). As far as this religious denomination if concerned, being “born again” refers not to the physical resurrection that Jesus Christ experienced, but rather, it speaks of a “being born again […] in a spiritual realm and is experienced by people who receive Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior” (Trimingham 2017). A distinguishing practice that Filipino Born Again Christians do is Baptism with the Holy Spirit by immersing their entire body in water. Christians, in general, not just Born Agains, believe Baptism to be a sacred act. This is because their believe that, according to their scripture in Acts 1:5 and 2:1-4, the incarnated Christ, the center of their faith, was baptized by John the Baptist to fully receive the Lord. This is further extended by Mark 1:9-11 and Corinthians 15:42-49, verses from their scriptures, where they believe that through the Baptism in John, “Jesus was born again as a spiritual son of God,” and as God’s son, the “assurance of everlasting life” awaits him in heaven (Philippine Bible Society 2010:1120;1286-1287). The Born Again Christian faith is grounded on the personal relationship with Christ.\n\nWhat is Proclaim His Name Christian Fellowship?\n\nThe Proclaim His Name Christian Fellowship (PCF) is a Born Again Christian-baptized Church established in the Philippines by Filipino pastors, whose mission is “to glorify God by helping fulfill the great commission through spiritual multiplication” (Proclaim His Name Christian Fellowship 2014).\n\nPCF had their first worship, as an established group, on 5 November 2006 at Campus Crusade for Christ, having only about fifty members. The PCF was formally established and registered on 28 November 2006, headed by the late Rev. Clement E. Guillermo, the former Pastoral leader of the Church with a few other of his Pastor friends. On 1 June 2008, the Church permanently moved to Scout Madrinan corner, Scout Tobias.\n\nUpon moving to their present location, the Church leaders started to have Sunday services weekly and Bible study sessions daily. The Church started to hold special sessions for adult women, adult men, married couples, young adults, teens or youth, and children. The Church members were encouraged to participate and be part of a ministry within the Church, such as the women’s ministry, men’s ministry, the couple’s ministry, young adult’s ministry, youth ministry, praise and worship ministry, children’s ministry, discipleship and training ministry, membership, greeters and ushering ministry, and, evangelism ministry. These programs provided the members with a unique way of listening to and spreading the word of the Lord.\n\nWilling Suspension of (Dis)belief\n\nThe absence of traffic on a Sunday morning was very unlikely of the convoluted Katipunan. Arriving at the church earlier than expected contributed to the tension we were already feeling from waking up early in the morning on a weekend and the idea of surprise we were about to witness as we step in the grounds of an unfamiliar faith. As we reached the place, as unnoticeable as the time we spent traveling, we were immediately met with a feeling of belongingness and kindness. We were received warmly by Tito Topher, our informant, ushering us inside the church. At the threshold of PCF, we met more people and were welcomed by the good mornings of the children who were assigned to hand out flyers containing the program of the day’s worship.\n\nInside the church, the atmosphere was soothingly peaceful and well-conditioned. The place was composed of vibrant white walls and filled of rows of black plastic chairs set from the near front where a stage is placed, up to the very back of the room. In front was a projector screen that flashed a reminder on the upcoming Christmas party of the fellowship’s men’s ministry. This, among other decorations such as the parol and wreaths. It was clear that the church was making preparations for Christmas.\n\nNotably as well, in front were carefully arranged instruments: a drum set, two electric guitars, two bass guitars, and a keyboard. Inside the worship room, we noticed how technologically-equipped the place was: a pair of stereos, microphones and microphone stands near the stage, a projector hanged at the ceiling, a dedicated desktop screen for people on stage to view during worship services, and a boxed facility room for monitoring and keeping track of technicalities. But that was everything there is. There were no statues, symbols, or images of characters that depict the faith of the fellowship.\n\nWe decided to sit at the very back of the room. Silent and still taking in what had transpired so far, we had waited for about thirty minutes—early for the first worship ceremony of the day. For the duration we’ve spent on waiting, members of the Christian fellowship began entering the room: greeting them with a sound “Good morning, po,” each new face welcomed as with uniform handshakes. Seemingly, this was how they welcome guests into the church. The members welcomed us kindly, expressing how glad they were to have new faces to join them in their worship. We also shook hands with the pastor and some leaders of the worship of the church. As we were seated near the mouth of the room, we were easily seen by more members of the fellowship who did not fail to equally greet us with the same welcoming warmth.\n\nDuring the short meet and greet, we were able to introduce ourselves as observers to some leaders of the church’s worship service. We were also asked of what religion we subscribe to, to which most of us replied, “Roman Catholic[ism].” Despite the differences between the denominations of our faith, we were encouragingly welcomed by the leaders to participate and join, to sing and worship with them. Tita Rhodora, the administration head who we were also in contact with, introduced herself and welcomed us for coming to their church. She expressed how very delighted she was that we were going to join them for their service worship and wished us a blessed service. This invitation was gratefully regarded by the group. However, at these inviting words of the leaders, we slightly felt uncertain and awkward, doubtful of whether we should participate or not. Some of us were under the impression of whether this was religiously legal, a prerogative, or generally “okay” as Born Agains and Catholics worship the same God.\n\nSomething we did not expect, however, was the need to sign a guest form. We were given forms to fill out, which our informant explained as a standard procedure for guests of the PCF church. At first, the group was hesitant in answering the forms because we were not informed of the procedure. In the end, we reached a consensus that this was part of gaining entrée into the church and securing trust from the members. We wanted to express that we were willing to take part in their practices and that we respect their faith. The form contained the following information: name, age, sex, birthday, email, cellphone number, status, occupation, religion, prayer intentions, and the number of times we’ve attended a Sunday service. We were most hesitant to answer the last two questions as, going to place, we failed to keep in mind that we would be one way or another asked to participate in their faith despite religious affiliations. Essentially, the feeling of uncertainty during said moments was akin to the feeling of fear, of not knowing what we were expected to do during the service. We were ruled over a sense of normlessness, a loss of direction, that we were used to having in our own churches. Moreover, according to Tito Topher, the rationale behind PCF asking its guests regarding the frequency of guest visits is that those who were able to attend service for more than the third time would be considered as a regular PCF churchgoer.\n\nUpon completing the forms, we were given sticker name tags. We were particularly asked to stick them where they would be visible. And yet again, we were first uncertain whether we wanted to openly display our names, but as guests, we felt the need to respectfully comply. Later into the day, we also realized how the need for name tags was a way for the fellowship to openly welcome the guests. After all, since the morning we arrived at PCF, the value of familial belongingness was stark obvious.\n\nBefore the service, we met other pastors, who introduced themselves to us as Pastor Al and Pastor Bernie. Tito Topher mediated the conversation, introducing us as students from Ateneo de Manila University, and that Nina among us, was his niece.\n\nUpon hearing this, we were grateful that Pastor Al set a happy mood, jokingly exclaiming that we must be happy as our school won against the University of Santo Tomas (UST) UAAP basketball league. Pastor Bernie, on the other hand, posed several queries: he asked us what made us want to attend their Church, to which we answered, “We wanted to immerse ourselves in the experience of different faiths,” where we study, and come from. We were also thankful for Pastor Bernie, as his engaging and approachable disposition made us feel more at ease amidst the overwhelming number of unfamiliar people greeting us.\n\nA few minutes before the service started, Pastor Bernie encouraged us to occupy the seats in front. We originally planned to sit at the very back so we could observe what was happening during the worship service. We were nonetheless forced to comply as Tito Topher, Tita Rhodora, and Pastor Bernie persistently showed signs of joy of seeing us being able to occupy the front seats. We assumed that they wanted us to immerse in the worship experience by offering us the best seats in the room.\n\nNot long, the room was filled with people who were catching up with each other. Some were even standing up by the sides and the aisles between the chairs as they happily conversed with their “mga kapatid.” Everyone seemed to know everyone. The common topic of conversation was about work, family, friends, businesses, and for a few, their plans for Christmas. The room that was once silent and empty, turned into one that was festive and filled with joyful-dispositioned people who were all smiles and warmth.\n\nSeated in front, feeling awkward and still uncertain, the service finally began with the pastor and women leaders taking the stage and introducing themselves. After which, worship songs filled the room, which were led by Praise and Worship Ministry (the official church band) and the pastors. According to our key informant, the church was comprised of musically-inclined people. The church is known by many other Christian churches for their singing and impressive band instrument playing. The members are known to speak of the gospel through the language of poetry and song.\n\nDuring the first song, the pastor encouraged everyone to stand up and join in the singing. We obliged to this invitation, although we remained feeling uneasy. To guide guests and members who may not be familiar with the songs, lyric videos meticulously prepared by the church were displayed. And although we were not entirely convinced of what we were doing, we gradually dwelled into the jive, feeling the festivity of the worship, and joining everyone who participated in the worship.\n\nAfter a round of three songs, Pastor Al stepped in front to deliver his sermon. In his sermon, which was akin to personal sharing, Pastor Al would occasionally interact with his audience. He shared stories and testimonies which his audience can relate to. He would often joke around and attempt to communicate with the younger members of the fellowship by mentioning colloquial millennial-emergent and pop-culture terminologies like Netflix, Facebook, Twitter, and selfie. Experiencing a Born Again worship service for the first time, the interactivity and casual atmosphere of said worship were the most distinct and comparable features we’ve noticed to liturgical worships of the Catholic faith. In the middle of the worship service however, some of us, despite the welcoming air of the room, felt somehow disturbed. The sensation can better be described as “shock.” Some of us expressed how it felt like participating in a cult, although its moral and ethical aspects were clearly righteous. It is interesting to point out how despite the family-like disposition of the fellowship, a sense of unbelongingness exacerbates the feeling of unfamiliarity.\n\nAs a culmination of the service, a closing prayer was led by Pastor Jerome who asked from the audience their prayer intentions. This was followed by a display of birthday greetings and announcements for the church’s events and activities. Right after this, we were surprised that a guest list was also displayed showing our names to the fellowship. We were unsure of what to do when our names were called, but some of the members sitting beside us cued us to stand up to allow acquaintanceship with the audience. As we stood up, we felt a bit embarrassed as the fellowship clapped; some even approached us to shake our hands.\n\nFive minutes after, Tito Topher called us and ushered us to the back of the room. We were briefly introduced to two girls and were led to the second floor of the church. Along the way, we were introduced to a few heads of the church. We were greeted by “beso–beso­” with some of the women and firmly shook hands with the others. At this specific instance, we especially felt even more the welcoming disposition of the church; they seemed eager to see new faces. Once we were led to a small room, the two girls introduced themselves and divided the group into two. They gave us a small yellow booklet and a letter with our names written on it. We underwent a 30-minute session, where we were debriefed on what we experienced and felt during the Sunday service. They also briefly taught us of the beliefs and doctrines of their faith. Learning that they were of the same age as us, we began feeling comfortable towards them. During this session as well, we were given snacks by the church heads. Significantly, in the session, we learned briefly about what they, the Born Again Christians, believed in, allowing us to differentiate our faith with theirs. Furthermore, through this session, we learned that unlike Catholics, they did not have images of God and Christ, nor did they have the wooden cross that symbolized the crucifixion.\n\nOne of the two girls, Ate Bea, also shared her personal experience of conversion from the Catholic faith into becoming a Born Again Christian. She emphasized how she witnessed a beautiful personal relationship with Jesus Christ through the Born Again Christian Faith. Also during this time, it cannot be denied that we also felt tensed as we felt that by being taught of the doctrines of the Born Again Christian faith, we were seemingly being converted, especially that after the session, we were asked if we would come back next Sunday, to which we do not know how to reply.\n\nFor the entirety of our initial involvement in PCF, we realized the importance of mustering the ability to suspend one’s belief, of one’s faith in the face of other faith denominations. The enterprise of faith, and more so religion, demand the value of respect and acceptance towards the varying spiritual needs of a person. One must shed her idea of what is alone the ultimate faith in order to understand the permutations of other faiths. The sensations of awkwardness, uncertainty, and normlessness which we experienced throughout the worship service proves the diversity of human experiences with the spiritual world.\n\nGaining entrée into the field filled us with surprising and heart-warming moments. In retrospect, those who knew of our intent for visiting showed the same warmth and welcoming disposition everyone else in the fellowship (who did not know about it) showed. It can be said that our experience as participants and observers of what the fellowship is close to honesty. The only moments our roles as observers were seen to influence the field were when the church leaders and pastors seemingly displayed interest and awareness of our visit to the place. They also seemed to prioritize what we should be doing, or where we should sit.\n\nIt is through such an experience that we were first integrated into the Born Again community. This experience helped us in contextualizing the community and gaining understanding on the unique spiritual life of the Born Agains that clearly influenced the way they interact with people.\n\nYet to be Born Again\n\nThe Church hosts two separate, simultaneous Sunday schools for children. This ministration involves a group of students from certain age groups and a teacher who teaches life lessons that can be taken from the teachings of their church. These children are yet to be introduced and converted into the Born Again Christian faith One group range from ages four to seven and the other from ages eight to twelve. We were divided into two groups, one for the younger-aged children, and the other for the older ones.\n\nTeaching the Little Ones\n\nPrior to the session, we learned from Ate Jermaine that the church teaches all kinds of children. The Sunday school class is not exclusive to regular members of the church but is more importantly open to street children. She informed us that when the child shows interest about hearing the word of God, PCF and its members would happily accept them with open arms, including them in the PCF family. To brief us, Ate Jermaine told us that the street children follow a routine: they attend a Bible study for the Children’s Ministry and sleep at the church overnight. The following morning, the children would eat breakfast with the pastors and attend the morning service at 8:30 AM. This was a regular thing at the church and the members donate money for their food whenever they seek refuge.\n\nAt the very beginning of the class, we were asked to arrange the small plastic chairs for the children to sit on. We sat at the side of the room where we could observe the children and how the teacher interacts with them. Ate Jermaine introduced herself to us and us to the children. The children that day, contrary to what Ate Jermaine has warned us, were questioningly quiet. She also informed us of a student with ADHD who would often need to start clamoring to rest oneself. But that day, he did not stand out from the rest of the quiet kids. Noticing this, she told us that the children were usually makulit and pasaway but because we were there, they were not as active and noisy. We tried to greet the kids, but they would avoid eye contact with us or even leave the room.\n\nAs we volunteered to help in the Sunday school, we were given small tasks such as sticking papers together and helping Ate Jermaine set up the classroom. At the other side of the room, we saw a whiteboard where the works of the children were posted: their drawings, coloring activities, cutouts, prayers, and the like. Almost all of which were related to understanding one’s faith. The drawings also looked like characters from stories in the Bible. The cutouts were of a plant with a handwritten prayer taped below it that says, “I am a plant and I grow because of God’s love.” At the corner of the room, were shelves of materials that are used for the class. In front was a TV hanged on the wall, where the children could watch videos and read lyrics during singing activities. Near the TV was a piece of paper, taped on the wall, containing the schedule of activities: song, activity, lesson, prayer, snack time. The room was really like any other classroom.\n\nAkin to the worship we attend, the class session started with a Christian song (“He’s Got the Whole World in His Hands”). To interact with the children, Ate Jermaine asked all of us to stand up, form a circle, sing along, and dance with her. To immerse ourselves in the activity, we joined the children: we joined in the small circle holding hands with the children. The children had lots of fun as they sang the song and jumped along the circle. As the activity finished, we found ourselves closer with the children. They showed signs that they were more comfortable with us joining them in the room. As soon as the song ended, we helped fixed the chairs into their original places, helped Ate Jermaine sit the children, and listened to her lesson for the day.\n\nIn the Sunday school, according to our key informant and Ate Jermaine, they make use of songs to help the children learn more about God instead of using traditional approaches i.e. Bible reading, scripture reading, memorizing formulated prayers, and joining the adult’s service. It is also through music that children are motivated to participate; they enjoy singing a lot despite not knowing (for some) what they were singing about. For this reason, Ate Jermaine makes sure that she dedicates time in explaining the meaning of the song.\n\nFurther into the Sunday class, the class was divided into two groups. The children were then asked to draw their favorite food—vegetables, fruit, or snack. During the activity, we joined the children in their drawing, interacting with and asking them of their favorite food. To conclude the activity, Ate Jermaine asked the class to identify if what they’ve drawn is either healthy or not. Most of the students were able to distinguish healthy food from junk food. After the activity, she played a video animation that would introduce the lesson for the day. We noticed that the children were very engrossed with the cartoon that when the teacher would pause the video to explain something, the children would get impatient and ask the teacher to play the video. At the end of the session, we saw how using the video was an appropriate way to get the attention of the kids and wrap up the lesson.\n\nTowards the end of the lesson, after Ate Jermaine prepared snacks, we were tasked to hand it over to the children after they prayed. We were informed that every session, Ate Jermaine asks someone from the class to lead and read the prayer for the day. Since no one volunteered that day, she chose the eldest from the class because he knew how to read. For the others to participate, Ate Jeramine asked them to repeat after her and their prayer leader. We joined in the prayer, following the grateful language used in said conversation with God. As in every Born Again faith, the prayer was mostly about thanking God and being appreciative of His blessings and gifts. After the prayer, the children excitedly lined up to receive their snacks, thanking us as they exited the room where their parents were waiting for them.\n\nTeaching the Older Kids\n\nThe class was comprised of nine children, six girls, and three boys. Two of the older boys were more talkative, active, and participated a lot during the discussion, while the younger ones were more docile. There was one instructor about the same age as us who led the session. She is a UP student and leads the Sunday school session only once a month. To begin, she informed us that there was a different instructor every session and each of them had different ways of teaching the kids. Hers was in a form of game that we thought made the lesson more engaging for the children.\n\nBefore the session began, we placed six plastic chairs around the table and waited for the children to come. The instructor was also in the room and was setting up the projector that she would use for the discussion. After about fifteen minutes, the children arrived happy and energized. They greeted their instructor and engaged in conversations among themselves. The atmosphere was very warm and buzzing with an innocent and childlike energy. The instructor then flashed on the screen the activities that will be done within the session and asked for a volunteer in the group to lead the prayer. An older boy in a purple shirt raised his hand and was called to the front to lead the opening prayer. After this, the session commenced.\n\nThe lesson taught that day was obedience. After the prayer, she began asking the group how they would define obedience. The children were very active and some of their answers range from, “It’s when you listen to your parents,” to “Following God’s teachings.” She then started the game called “Are you Smart?” wherein she gave the children a sheet of white bond paper each and asked them to fold it into four, using the creases as boundaries for four drawings she would ask them to do. For this game, since the lesson was about obedience, she challenged the kids by describing the shapes to the children verbally and asking them to get and draw the correct image at the end of the game. For the first round, the image that she wanted the kids to draw was a house. She told them to draw a square, a triangle on top of that square, a vertical rectangle inside the square, and then two circles inside the square. During the game there were a lot of questions, confused reactions, and clarifications, but at the end, some children were nonetheless able to draw a house. The instructor then followed up the next instruction: who would want to pass the instructions to the other kids. The first kid to raise his hand was the same kid who led the opening prayer. The same instructions were followed throughout the duration of the game.\n\nAfter the game, the instructor proceeded to connecting the concept of obedience to the game and to the story of Saul. She asked the class to read the story written in the slides aloud and explained the moral of the story. The children were a bit quieter and listened more attentively this time to what the instructor discussed. After this, she then asked questions on how the concept of obedience can be applied in real life; she also asked the class what they learned in the session. Some of the answers of the kids were to listen to God’s word, obey God and one’s parents, and to listen to instructions. The instructor then asked the group who would do the closing prayer, for which a little girl volunteered, and thus officially ending the Sunday school session.\n\nStaying inside the room and conversing with one another and their instructor, the children were served snacks after the class session. We saw some of the older boys gathering around an iPad, playing, while some of the younger kids were discussing the game they just played looking really ecstatic. The kid in the purple shirt was kind enough to approach us at our seat where we sat to observe and asked us our names and the reason why we were there. He offered us some milk and biscuits which we humbly gave back to him by saying we’re fine.\n\nAfter the kids left the room, we helped the instructor fix the chairs and arrange the tables. Finally, we went to visit our other members who were observing the Sunday school session of the younger age group.\n\nAs we met with the other members of our group, Ate Jermaine made sure that we were able to get everything we need for our observation. Ate Jermaine also served as an informant for the Sunday school. After informing her that we’re all set, we parted ways and met with Tito Topher. Back at the worship room, we met more members of the church, and decided to spend some time with them.\n\nComparing the Catholic Faith with the Born Again Christian Faith\n\nWhat clothes to wear is often an issue in the Catholic church. We are asked to be conservative, to be simple, or yet, to “dress well.” And rather than becoming more inclusive especially towards the poor who are incapable of “presenting themselves well,” and a home for sinners to repent, the Catholic church imposes the need to appear “clean” and “proper” inside the church. As this continues to be problematic for Catholicism, the way people dress in PCF is easily what we’ve noticed first. In general, the people of PCF dress considerably more formal than Catholics attending church masses. For instance, as observed, it was common among men to wear dress shirt and slacks in the event. Women on the other hand, wore blouse and pants, while some wore dresses. The children conformed to such a prescription as they were probably dressed by their parents. Worried that some codes such as this one is present in PCF, we also planned wearing pants on the day of the observation to blend in with the crowd.\n\nAnother point of contention are the kinds of worship conducted and songs sang in Born Again churches. Said denomination uses songs to worship and thus invests in it by providing a full range of musical instruments. The worship service which we encountered were composed of consecutive songs which are unlikely of Catholic masses. In Catholic masses, the songs are punctuated with anecdotes from the priest. Also, unlike Catholic worship, the people of Born Again sing without the accompaniment of a choir. Worship in the Catholic sense is more on sermon, while Born Again worship is more on singing.\n\nOur observation also suggests that Born Again Christian faith is progressive in some respects. During worship sessions, women can also lead, unlike Catholic masses where nuns and laywomen are only there to provide assistance to the priest. In PCF, its female members are part of a group of said Christian fellowship that aims to foster women empowerment.\n\nMoreover, the Born Again Christian faith as exemplified by PCF is dynamic when it comes to providing evangelization through outreach programs. In PCF, children are housed in the church and are taught every Sunday in PCF’s Sunday school. This kind of evangelization is not an isolated case for the Catholic faith, but Catholic churches do not often go through the same evangelical persistence.\n\nThere are also no statues, symbols, and icons used in Born Again churches. As opposed to the Catholic faith, Born Again rituals are the worship itself, songs which bring people towards a sense of transcendence that allows them to experience their faith. In the Born Again faith, believers invest in one another.\n\nAbove all, the members of PCF know one another and consider their church as family. Even guests to the church, as we have experienced, are immediately accommodated with such a disposition. For instance, they use collective terms on a frequent basis (e.g. we), as if treating everyone as part of their faith. In the Catholic church, unless one is part of the church’s activities and organizations, it is not frequent that we see one establish a sense of rapport equal to that of the Born Again churches.\n\nBeing Born Again\n\nGiven this opportunity to observe and participate in this worship service, we were able to begin understanding the intricacies and nuances of the permutations of the Christian faith. Enlightened with the nature of the Born Again faith, we are met with the realization that as much as faith is social, it is also personal.\n\nBeing immersed in the activities in PCF, we realized how the emergence of their faith denomination has not only bridged connections which are especially familial but has also created a unique culture that is true and exclusive to their faith. A culture that is unique entirely, it is embodied by the way they shake our hands, treat each other as family, talk with one another, their sense of fashion, and most importantly, the values and advocacies which they uphold.\n\nIn the same vein, as we went deeper into the worship, praying session, and Sunday school activity, the Born Again faith has introduced to us the personal aspect of their faith manifested through the decision of each of their devotee to be part of PCF. The Born Again Christians whom we have met, boast of the personal relationship they have with God—a shared value shared by all Born Again Christians, thereby leading to the creation of a collective faith.\n\nThe sought-after personal relationship with God, in the grand scheme of things, reflects the idea of how there is no absolute faith; there is no one way of expressing our faith towards a higher being. And while religions exist to prove that faith can be social, the different experiences of the human person as to how they view their faith asserts the personal aspect of believing, of faith that is unique to every person.\n\nOur experience with PCF more so proves one thing: that the belief in a higher being, beyond being social and personal, is a natural human condition. It is a natural human recourse towards perceiving reality, a means of attempting to understand the world one moves in.\n\nProvided these realizations, as we look into our visit to a Born Again church, we think in hindsight of what this implies. Knowing that the Philippines is predominantly Catholic, most Filipinos are seemingly born into the Catholic faith without much prerogative and choice to know which faith to choose. It is almost always assumed that every Filipino is Catholic. Nevertheless, amidst this dominance of said faith, persist other faith enterprises such as the Born Again Christian faith. The presence of the Born Again Christian faith, while small-scale, asserts the inevitable diversity of faith. The episodes of normlessness in the face of the Born Again Christian worship, uncertainty, doubt, and unsettling sensation of being converted into another faith which we experienced during the visit to PCF, explain how we are as humans are aware of diversity of faith and of which faith we choose to hinge on. That in this situation where our faith is being challenged, we are more so convinced of and our values queried on why we subscribe to the faith we have now.\n\nOne can also say that the diversity of faiths or even religions allows people to understand each other’s differences. By allowing and being capable to accept and honor the diversity of faiths, we come to regard the nature of faith as both a personal human experience and a phenomenon of today’s world that aims to cater the way people cope with understanding the world they are part of. But above all, as our faith is becoming more and more of a personal, natural human experience, it also learns to reflect our own values, or better yet, becomes an outlet for us to enact our values. Just like what PCF is doing, their sense of a fulfilling relationship with the Lord drives and similarly allows them to practice good works such as helping children without barriers.\n\nAs much as the presence of non-Roman Catholic religious denominations in the country such as the Born Again Christian faith emphasizes the personal and human aspect of faith, it similarly challenges how Filipinos are culturally born into a religion—a seemingly barrier to a human experience of personally choosing to witness a transcendental being. The variety of faith denominations in the country as represented by the emergence of the Born Again Christian faith reminds us how our faith, as personal as it can be as a fundamental human experience, calls to us the possibility of being born again.\n\nAnswers to Separate Questions:\n\n1. What insights were gained from participation compared to just observing?\n\nParticipation in the Sunday school sessions and the events prior and following them provided avenues for learning using a wider range of personal faculties compared to just observing. It involves actively communicating, conforming, and learning from the context and the people in it. Participation provides individuals with a wider range of information that cannot be obtained by observing, such as feedback on the experience of doing a series of activities provided a certain context.\n\nFor instance, during the service worship, we had to actively participate in their practices. As such, we conformed to our surroundings and copied their responses towards the service. We stood up when everybody stood up, sat down when everyone sat down, and we clapped when all clapped. Through such an experience were we more attentive and attuned to the way we move and how we responded. By just observing, we would have felt excluded from the practices and from the people we were observing. Participation made us stand out less and feel a sense of belonging in the community, through shared practices.\n\nIn the service debriefing after the fellowship, we had to read some passages and Bible verses. We also had to tell them about our thoughts on the passages, since they were expecting us to say something. Through active participation, we were able to question some of the teachings and provide our own opinion on such matters. We were able to understand their faith and beliefs.\n\nEssentially, through participation, we felt that we were honestly experiencing what our observation units are experiencing.\n\n2. What did having a key informant add to your understanding?\n\nOur key informant made us understand the Born Again Christian faith and their practices, particularly the culture in PCF. Having a key informant confirmed and corrected some of our initial observations. Through our informant, we were debriefed of the experience we had, explaining some of the practices or beliefs that were not that clear, thus helping us to avoid assumptions on sensitive matters such as faith and religion. To cite, the group had to fill out a guest form during the activity and felt particularly afraid about it. However, during the debriefing, our key informant told us that it was just for them to keep track of the monthly visitors of the Church. Without clarifying such, we would have kept our assumption that they were going to keep our contact information (and probably send us messages) which were not part of completing an observation at PCF.\n\n3. What was learned from participant observation at this event that a questionnaire or interview about it might miss?\n\nIn the process of attempting to obtain information from individuals through the usage of questionnaires or interviews, there may be information these individuals might choose to omit or alter for the purpose of trying to meet the implicit and explicit expectations of researchers. Moreover, in observations, individuals will be able to notice subtle details that cannot otherwise be observed in questionnaires or interviews. Examples of the said details are sensory details (stimuli that involve sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch).\n\nQuestionnaires and interviews answer questions at face value but can never truly provide implications to such. As we have experienced the service worship, questionnaires and interviews could never accurately explain, in detail, intricacies of their practices—the expression of the people, the way we saw how people think, etc. To cite our experience, we were able to take note of how the pastor lectured and his attempt to engage with his younger audience, and how they would respond back. Through participant observation, we were able to implicate the strategy of the church regarding the inclusion of younger members.\n\n4. For what purposes might a questionnaire or interview be better than participant observation?\n\nParticipant observation requires the researchers to situate themselves in the culture they are observing. Through immersion, they are able to understand more thoroughly, the community they are observing by living and experiencing the everyday realities of its members. Although participant observation, in theory, would provide a comprehensive and detailed report on the phenomenon being observed, the analyses are empirical, implied, and are based on how the researchers interpret it. Questionnaires and interviews would provide us with a subjective information from the participants themselves (thus also objective) and what they think of their faith. And inasmuch as we were able to understand the Born Again faith through immersing ourselves in their practices, perhaps we could have understood their faith more if we had an opportunity for survey and interviews with the members of the church. Through interviews or surveys with different kinds of members in the church, we could understand their individual faith and see how it plays in the larger narrative of the Born Again Christian faith. Furthermore, through conducting such methods to the children observed (Sunday school), we might have understood what they understand or know about their faith and what they learned that day.\n\nQuestionnaires and interviews may provide us with accurate numerical data on the demographics of the members of the church, their faith, their level of satisfaction relative to their church attendance, how regular they go to church, and much more.\n\n5. What insights did you gain about the contemporary world from the event that you observed and participated in?\n\nWe learned that religion is very important in the Philippines. We hear the phrase “the Philippines is predominantly Roman Catholic” a lot and tend to characterize the Philippines as homogeneously a nation of people who practice Catholicism. The immersion experience made us realize the reality of religions in the country that are of non-Roman Catholics because they do exist and practice their faith regularly. It made us understand, really, the differences of faith and practices of such. Although both religions believe in God and Jesus Christ, they pray to and practice their worship in distinct ways.\n\nThe immersion experience allowed us to see the different cultures around us and the possibility of such. There is no right way to praise God, nor is there a right way to know and understand Him. Every culture is distinct, just like how every religion and faith is. It is all in a matter of how one interprets the reality they are faced with. The contemporary world is filled with different realities and different interpretations of such. Just like the PCF church, their belief in God and Jesus Christ and their practices are but an interpretation of a wide number of beliefs and practices of the same beings.\n\nThe contemporary world consists of varied entities. The same applies to people, who are among the entities of this society. They do, say, and believe in different things. There are certain thoughts, words, and actions that people who do, say, and believe certain things do not expect from others who do not share the same way of life. However, these same people are also capable of understanding each other despite the differences. They are very much capable of compromising accordingly. In fact, these are what allow people to learn and develop to be better individuals in the near and distant future. These are what sustain societies in this world for centuries.\n\n6. What SocSc12 concepts tackled in class can be applied to analyze your activity?\n\nA relevant topic discussed could be “Religion, Magic, and Worldview.” Through our immersion in the community, we were able to see very clearly and understand the faith of the Filipino Born Again Christians and their faith directed towards God and Jesus Christ. It is not just about religion, and what it says in the documents, but rather a personal relationship with the Father and His Son (as stated by the key informant). During the small group debriefing sessions, Ate Bea told us that it is inherently human to question existence and find (answers and) comfort in religion, which is a structured institution of beliefs and practices. She said that we direct our questions of existence and being towards God whom we cannot understand.\n\nWe may also apply “Gender and Sexuality.” In most churches, the ones who lead the services or masses are usually male pastors, but in PCF, the church and its members provide women the opportunity to lead. Not just in services, but as well as in charity events, Christmas parties, fundraising events, birthdays, baptisms, recollections, retreats, and Bible study sessions. Furthermore, the women in this church are empowered through the Women’s Ministry, which seeks to encourage active participation and leadership opportunities for women of all ages. They also organize seminars, talks, and rallies that support and uphold the rights of women.\n\nWe also seek to analyze the immersion experience through the lesson of “Family and Kinship.” In relation to “Religion, Magic, and Worldview,” strengthened by their belief and love for their faith in God and Jesus Christ, they see and recognize each member of the church as their family. Family-related terms were often used, such as Tita, Tito, Lola, Lolo, Ate, Kuya, Kapatid. Such an intimacy, through the use of familial words, express their closeness and relation to each other. The Filipino culture of the value of family is also manifested in this church and how they treat their kapatids.\n\nIn “Language and Communication,” we were able to see how the members of the community relate to each other through the use of language. At times, we felt excluded and lost because the church members shared a particular language with each other, brought about by their experiences in the church. Even with their use of simple expressions such as “sa kabilang room” or “sa kwarto sa taas,” we did not know where those rooms were unlike regular Church members who do and understood the statements immediately. They also have nicknames for each other and signs and symbols for certain actions or responses. Such as during the service where the members, through repeated service experience, know when to stand up and when to actively and appropriately participate in the service.\n\nReferences\n\nHarvard Divinity School. n.d. “Protestant Christianity in the Philippines.” Retrieved November 30, 2019 (https://rlp.hds.harvard.edu/faq/protestant-christianity-philippines).\n\nPhilippine Bible Society. 2010.
