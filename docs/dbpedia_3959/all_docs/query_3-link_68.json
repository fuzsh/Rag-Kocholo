Our hearts break for the millions of children who suffer from lack of resources, but we rejoice because there is hope.\n\nWe at Compassion know that the transformative power of Christ’s love is not bound by nationality or economic status. Unified by this conviction, our increasingly diverse staff uses our talents and experience to serve more than 2.2 million children in 29 countries. We’re excited for you to join our ministry!"
