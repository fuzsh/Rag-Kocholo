Iâm building a house that will hopefully be done in 3 months I have 5 workers at 10$ a day. They just built a house in Kalibo for a doctor and have good references. Iâll be there vlogging and working alongside them every day. If you look at my wifeâs channel you can see videos of her parents house and my western guests. When you are married in the Philippines you also have a stake in the house. The law has been change also I believe to allow inheritance of the property even if you are a foreign citizen. I donât expect any problems. Anything I spend here I can afford to lose anyway.\n\nQuote History\n\nOriginally Posted By tsg68:\n\nBut in my case married the Princess of Ngaraard, Palau....Ulimang Clan....bitch tried poisoning me off when I found out the 13yr old daughter wasnt mine.....\n\nCrazy slut was just trying to protect her political status in her country.\n\nPalau Supreme Court Case CA15-009....I got the entire Palau Council of Chiefâs to strip that bitches Queen status....case pending.\n\nBoth the mother in law...former Queen and her Brother the Clan Chief...dropped fukn dead....kinda sent US Federal Agents after them....try poisoning me off you fuckers\n\nHer Uncle was Elias Camsek Chin....Palau Senate President....killed his fuckin career....when Colonel Whelan of the 36th Mission Support Group on Guam killed himself when his wife wanted a divorce after she found out he was fuckin my wife.....\n\nCrazy fukn brown skinned people\n\nView Quote\n\nGOT DAMN..\n\nAnd here i thought i get shitfaced and write some crazy shit on here.\n\nThat's a SOBERING post Brother !\n\nQuote History\n\nOriginally Posted By barbcue:\n\nGOT DAMN..\n\nAnd here i thought i get shitfaced and write some crazy shit on here.\n\nThat's a SOBERING post Brother !\n\nView Quote View All Quotes\n\nView All Quotes\n\nQuote History\n\nOriginally Posted By barbcue:\n\nOriginally Posted By tsg68:\n\nBut in my case married the Princess of Ngaraard, Palau....Ulimang Clan....bitch tried poisoning me off when I found out the 13yr old daughter wasnt mine.....\n\nCrazy slut was just trying to protect her political status in her country.\n\nPalau Supreme Court Case CA15-009....I got the entire Palau Council of Chiefâs to strip that bitches Queen status....case pending.\n\nBoth the mother in law...former Queen and her Brother the Clan Chief...dropped fukn dead....kinda sent US Federal Agents after them....try poisoning me off you fuckers\n\nHer Uncle was Elias Camsek Chin....Palau Senate President....killed his fuckin career....when Colonel Whelan of the 36th Mission Support Group on Guam killed himself when his wife wanted a divorce after she found out he was fuckin my wife.....\n\nCrazy fukn brown skinned people\n\nGOT DAMN..\n\nAnd here i thought i get shitfaced and write some crazy shit on here.\n\nThat's a SOBERING post Brother !\n\nIâm pretty sure that was a real story but itâs 10 years or so old and the people of Palau have little in common with the Filipino people.\n\nQuote History\n\nOriginally Posted By Frontiercowboy:\n\nShe is everything I ever dreamed of in a woman. As far as making a living here I can stay for years with my savings and investments. I'll probably return to America next year if Trump wins if not I'll take a foreign job. I have several business ideas to develop here in the Philippines but I'm not counting on them working out.\n\nView Quote\n\nBe sure to do the research if you plan on working there.\n\nI believe it is like here in Thailand where you can not do a job that a local is capable of doing.\n\nCongrats and welcome to the ex-pat life."
