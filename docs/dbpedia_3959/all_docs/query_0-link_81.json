Following revival practices and doctrines as they made their way into the islands behind the American military and alongside the larger colonial project, Oconer re-narrates a tired and simplistic one-way story of western religious imperialism into a stirring drama of pan-Pacific ‘Holy Spirit revival.’ Tracing the movement and subsequent reconstructions of holiness thought, practice, and performance through revivals in India that spread to the Philippines, Oconer provides a full and convincing portrayal of Filipino intellectual, emotional, and institutional engagement with the religious offerings of the missionaries. This culto Pentecostal, which Oconer argues opened the space for Filipino participation in the global Pentecostal healing movement in the 1950s, became the kernel for the development of Filipino Methodist identities, practices, and schisms.\"\n\n—Morris L. Davis, Associate Professor at Drew University\n\nFor those who have kept the flames of renewal alive among the people called Methodists in the Philippines\n\nThe most successful innovation in the Philippines has been the Methodist revival because it has so perfectly fitted the psychology of the people. They find the passion and drive of Methodism almost irresistible. A revival breaks out . . . a sense of joy witnesses to the presence of the Holy Spirit; the impassioned preacher sweeps across the heart strings of his hearers, with no attempt at logical order, but with every effort to convict of sin and to portray salvation in such beautiful terms that unsaved men and women and children will be wooed to the altar in quest of it.\n\n—Frank C. Laubach, The People of the Philippines\n\nForeword\n\nA good case study can open vistas for research that can transform one’s understanding of the subject. Such is the case study of Luther Oconer on Methodism in the Philippines. Many histories of churches are institutional studies, focusing on the development of structures. Others are sociological. Often the beginnings of a church are precisely defined in the historiography and few questions asked. The work of Oconer is so much more. It is a multivalent study that takes all of these aspects into account, including theology, international politics, and the structures of religious belief.\n\nBeginning with a situation in which Oconer and others found themselves censored by leaders of their church, he examined the situation synchronically and diachronically. The results of his research are important for World Christianity, Methodism generally, and specifically for the development of Methodism in the Philippines and other regions of Asia. The volume provides a carefully documented situation in which the networks and influences of the global Radical Holiness traditions struggled with the birth from within it of a more radical religious tradition, Pentecostalism.\n\nLuther Oconer is singularly qualified to undertake the study. He is an ordained elder in the Pampanga Philippines Annual Conference of The United Methodist Church. Oconer studied at Mapúa Institute of Technology (BS 1993) and Wesley Divinity School (MDiv 2001), which is part of Wesleyan University in Cabanatuan City, Philippines. He continued his studies at Drew University (MPhil 2006 and PhD 2009). He was personally involved in the situations that led to the case study and had access to the other principal actors for his research. He has already established himself as an authority on the history of Methodism in the Philippines. This work demonstrates that the breadth of his expertise goes far beyond the history of Methodism in the Philippines to Methodism in the rest of Asia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\n\nThe central question with which Oconer deals is the origin of Pentecostal Methodism in the Philippines. It has often puzzled observers that religious traditions with roots in North America and Europe share liturgical styles and theological emphases with Pentecostals while not being generally recognized as Pentecostal. This happens despite the fact that the churches to which they are related in North America and Europe are anything but Pentecostal in liturgy and theology. Thus, many churches that are nominally Methodist, Presbyterian, Baptist, Lutheran, Anglican, and Catholic can be observed to share Pentecostal liturgies and theological foci. Luther Oconer has the distinction of demonstrating that for the Methodists in the Philippines, this is due to the Radical Holiness tradition, a tradition which has been little studied.\n\nRadical Holiness was a self-designation and a self-identifying code for the radicalized Holiness movements that grew out of Methodism and other denominations in the post-Civil War period. The main hermeneutical shift was to move from the Gospels as normative for church life, as Wesley and the Methodists had assumed, to insisting that the book of the Acts of the Apostles, especially the first two chapters, presented a normative and ideal vision for spirituality, church life, and mission. Hence, the identifier Pentecost or Pentecostal churches that became popular from the early 1890s, famously led by Richard Reader Harris in the United Kingdom and Samuel A. Keen in the United States was supported by publisher and God’s Bible School founder, Martin Wells Knapp. These Radical Holiness movements, and the leadership in them, reached across denominational, ethnic, gender, and class lines. They were quite open, initially, to theological experimentation. As versions of Methodist ideas about spirituality (sanctification or theosis) were introduced into diverse religious traditions, ideas alien to Methodism (faith healing, premillennialism, inerrancy, Darbyist dispensationalism) were adapted by groups with a Methodist heritage.\n\nSimultaneous to this, fissures over the nature of the Methodist/Holiness Movement doctrine of sanctification or baptism of the Holy Spirit were developing. In England, after Wesley there had been a less enthusiastic approach to sanctification fostered by Jabez Bunting and Richard Watson, and there were similar developments in the United States. In both the United States and the United Kingdom this paralleled Methodist upward mobility, less involvement with the poor and less enthusiasm in worship. Renewed appeals for attention to sanctification in British Methodism (and other British churches) were little influenced by the perfectionistic theologies of sanctification developed at Oberlin and promoted by Charles Finney and Asa Mahan. In the United States, the more vigorous renewed calls for attention to sanctification were shaped by Oberlin perfectionism.\n\nHowever, within the missionary community, changes in Methodist and Radical Holiness theology were beginning to happen. William Arthur, William Boardman, Bishop William Taylor, John Hunt, Thomas Champness, and later Bishop James Thoburn realized that cultural structures around the world were different from those of the United States and the United Kingdom, and that a different understanding of and presentation of Radical Holiness ideas on holiness were needed. The thinking and preaching of these missionary theologians resulted in a tradition that might be described as global holiness. The ideas would, with some intellectual shifts, be institutionalized (indigenized) in European Holiness movements, for example, in the United Kingdom (Keswick) and in Germany in the Gemeinschaftsbewegung. European Holiness movements rarely combined the more exuberantly enthusiastic liturgical styles of their North American religious cousins with this tradition of global holiness that would become popularized by the Keswick Convention. Despite their evolving perspectives on holiness, all of these thinkers and mission leaders remained in good standing in the Radical Holiness movements.\n\nHowever, in many areas of the world these two interrelated streams, the Radical Holiness movements and the global holiness intertwined to become part of the fabric of World Christianity. Thanks to this volume, it becomes clear how this happened in the Philippines! For that, we owe Luther Oconer a debt of gratitude. It is to be hoped that this research encourages others to reexamine the traditional scholarship on the Radical Holiness, Pentecostal, and Methodist movements.\n\nDavid Bundy\n\nAssociate Director, Manchester Wesley Research Centre, Nazarene Theological College, and Research Professor for World Christian Studies, New York Theological Seminary\n\nPreface\n\nThis book grew out of a desire to learn more about John Wesley that dates back to my time as a youth leader in my home church in the Philippines. This passion has set me off on a journey of discovery that eventually brought me to the Wesleyan and Methodist Studies program at Drew University fifteen years ago. As my understanding of Wesley’s vision for the Christian life deepened, I began to focus my attention on his teachings on sanctification and the ways by which they influenced the rise of the Holiness movement in the United States. This movement provided a fertile seedbed for the emergence of modern Pentecostalism and helped shape missionary thought and practice in foreign fields at the turn of the twentieth century.\n\nHence, this book explores how holiness spirituality, with its varied forms and expressions, influenced Methodist missions in the Philippines. This inquiry led me to sieve through volumes of conference journals, official records, memoirs, and manuscripts piecing together the spiritual culture of early Philippine Methodism. The process has enabled me to uncover the significance of culto Pentecostal (Pentecostal meeting) revivalism in the development of Methodism in the Philippines, which became the subject of my doctoral project at Drew. Culto Pentecostal revivals were not mere footnotes to the history of Wesley’s spiritual descendants in the Philippines but key to discerning how Filipino Methodist identity developed. This study therefore endeavors to offer a rich and nuanced retelling of the early history of Methodism in the Philippines by using culto Pentecostal revivalism as a lens. It is also my hope that it will deepen our understanding of Methodism in the Philippines and advance our knowledge of American Methodist mission history.\n\nI am deeply indebted to my United Theological Seminary family—the faculty, staff and students—for their constant support during the course of this project. David Watson and Scott Kisker were the first ones to motivate me to get this study published. Andrew Park, Tom Dozeman, Peter Bellini, and Justus Hunter have served as conversation partners during the various stages of the project. Chad Clark assisted in the preparation of the manuscript and edited my drafts. I deeply appreciate his attention to detail and editorial expertise. Zeppellin Canlas also assisted my family in so many ways so that I could be away for research. I am also grateful to our board of trustees for the much-needed sabbatical that allowed me to finish this book.\n\nSince the book has been initially conceived as a doctoral project, I also owe a debt of gratitude to my former mentors and colleagues at Drew. Donald Dayton provided early inspiration on the subject through his lectures and writings on the Holiness and Pentecostal movements. I pay special tribute to his Theological Roots of Pentecostalism for introducing me to the fourfold gospel as a framework for understanding these two movements. My dissertation committee also deserves special mention. Morris Davis, Jesse Todd, and L. Dale Patterson provided guidance and valuable insights that sustained and saw the completion of the project. Methodist Librarian Chris Anderson provided resources as he was working on his research and, recently, granted permission to feature some images from the Methodist Library Image Collection. Kevin Newburg and Patrick Eby served as sounding boards throughout the course of the project.\n\nI also appreciate the connections and resources made available to me through the Wesley Seminars at Duke University (2006 and 2016) and Asbury Theological Seminary (2013). I am very grateful to notable Wesley scholars Randy Maddox, Richard Heitzenrater, and Kenneth Collins for the opportunity to participate and learn from these two seminars. Other specialists who provided valuable insights include Floyd Cunningham of the Asia Pacific Nazarene Theological Seminary in the Philippines, William Kostlevy of the Brethren Historical Library and Archives and David Bundy of the Manchester Wesley Research Centre. I extend my deep appreciation to David for writing the Foreword.\n\nFor the many important discoveries made during research, I thank all the librarians, archivists, and staff at all the repositories I have visited. These include the United Methodist Archives, the Drew Methodist Library, the Drew Library, the Duke Divinity School Library, the Duke Bridwell Library, the American Bible Society Archives, the Syracuse University George Arent Library, the Asbury University Archives, and the Asbury Theological Seminary B. L. Fisher Library. Mark Shenise and Frances Lyons-Bristol, associate archivists at the United Methodist Church Archives, deserve special mention for the many ways they have assisted me with my research. Louis Sechehay and Kathy Juliano of Drew Library’s Inter-Library Loan diligently fulfilled my dozens of requests for rare Philippine Methodists materials from other libraries. Suzanne Gehring, head of archives and special collections, and Hannah Armour, assistant archivist, at the Asbury University Kinlaw Library generously provided me some of the images used in this book.\n\nI also commend a number of individuals for their assistance. The late David Candelaria graciously granted me an interview in his home in Taytay in May 2005. Esther Javier, the daughter of Ruben Candelaria and wife of the late Eleazar Javier, and Bishop Jesse Candelaria, the son of David, shared significant insights about their fathers. Julie Dizon provided documents pertaining to the history of the Philippine Assemblies of God, Inc., a group founded by Ruben in 1966. Jay Yamomo sent me unpublished research from the Institute for Studies in Asian Church and Culture (ISAAC) on Philippine Protestantism and Filipino religious culture. My uncle, Pol Galvez, a renowned artist and former cartoonist with the Manila Bulletin, selflessly devoted his time to draw illustrations for this book. Rita E. Owen, the granddaughter of Philippine missionaries William and Edna Teeter, was gracious to share photos from her family’s collection.\n\nI can also never thank Patria Agustin Smith and her husband Paul enough for their extravagant kindness to my family that dates back to our time at Drew. Their generosity has allowed me to feature a number of rare images from the United Methodist Church Archives’ Mission Photograph Collection. My appreciation also extends to many friends in the Philippines including Bishops Solito Toquero, Daniel Arichea, Pedro Torio, Rodolfo Juan, and Ciriaco Francisco for their unwavering support during the various stages of my ministerial career and my calling to the academic ministry. My friends from the Pampanga Philippines Annual Conference and Aldersgate Renewal Ministries Philippines, whose names are just too many to enumerate, for praying for me and providing inspiration to finish the task.\n\nMy loved ones also deserve special commendation. My parents supported me during the most difficult years in graduate school. My father passed away in April 2014. I regret that he will never see this book. My mother spent six months in Dayton to help us with the kids in the midst of my wife’s intense studies and as I worked on this book. I also thank Jose Padang, my father-in-law, and my siblings, Lester, Lemuel, and Lesley, for the countless manifestations of encouragement they have sent my way. Last, but not the least, I am deeply grateful for my wife, Marion, and our children, Ilana and Wesley. Marion served as an associate during my research trips by helping me sort material and scan hundreds of pages. Our children, on the other hand, kept me grounded throughout the writing process by constantly reminding me about what matters most in life. The book is better because of them.\n\nAbbreviations\n\nABS American Bible Society\n\nBFC Badley Family Collection.

Apparently, their troubles had begun a few days earlier when the District Superintendent was appalled to find emotional outbursts and other unusual occurrences at a joint revival gathering they had organized in one of their churches. Featuring a number of reputed Pentecostal preachers from Manila, and attended mostly by young people, the event also agitated a band of local Methodists who were repulsed by what they felt were acts of desecration to their church. After a quick deliberation, the committee found the three guilty of the chargeable offense: dissemination of doctrines contrary to the established standards of the doctrine of The United Methodist Church. ¹ They recommended that the pastor who hosted the event be expelled from the ministry and the other two be withheld from entering seminary until rehabilitated. Nevertheless, at the annual conference weeks later, before their case was to be deliberated upon by the Conference board of ordained ministry, the bishop and his cabinet intervened. As a compromise, he separated the three by assigning them in three different districts. Since then, all three have been ordained elders in the UMC and have served in different capacities within the denomination. One of them is the author of this book.\n\nUnbeknownst to me at that time, the event that summer was but a microcosm of a larger phenomenon within Methodism throughout most of the second half of its existence in the Philippines. There have been many instances of Pentecostal-related controversies, which rattled the denomination in varying degrees throughout the years. The first and, perhaps, the most turbulent and publicized of all was the one that took place in 1954 involving two prominent Methodist ministers: Ruben V. Candelaria, district superintendent of the Manila District, and his cousin David M. Candelaria, pastor of Taytay Methodist Church. Ruben became the pioneering Filipino pastor of the newly established Bethel Temple, the first church built by the Assemblies of God (hereafter AG) in the City of Manila. David, on the other hand, led half of his congregants in Taytay to form an independent full gospel Methodist congregation. This church would eventually figure prominently in the growth of the Charismatic movement in the Philippines in the years that followed.\n\nWhile small compared to the two major schisms that had rocked Philippine Methodism decades earlier,² the Candelaria defection, nevertheless, served not only as a significant milestone in the history of the denomination but also as a harbinger of things to come. For years to this day, Filipino Methodists continue to grapple with similar tensions and defections, though to a lesser degree, wrought by a persistent Pentecostal influence creeping within their churches.³ The emergence of the Aldersgate United Methodist Renewal Fellowship harkens back to this Pentecostal impulse, for example. Launched in 1992 by a group of UMC ministers and laypersons, the movement attracts about a thousand Filipino United Methodists to its annual Aldersgate Conference in Baguio City. Questions raised regarding Aldersgate’s teachings and relationship with the UMC shortly after its founding led Bishop Emerito P. Nacpil of the Manila Episcopal Area to issue a circular on 19 August 1993, to not oppose the charismatic movement within our United Methodist constituency.⁴ Though the movement has increasingly attained mainstream acceptance in recent years, it continues to spark new tensions that either leave churches divided over issues pertaining to liturgy and practice or result in the exodus of individuals or small pockets of Charismatic Methodists to join or form independent Charismatic groups. For example, in 2001, Hiram Pangilinan, a highly popular United Methodist minister known for his healing and deliverance ministries, led about a hundred lay persons, mostly young people, to form what is now known as Church So Blessed, which is now a network of more than fifty churches spread throughout the country.⁵"
